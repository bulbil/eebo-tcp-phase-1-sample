            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            AN OVERTHROW
BY W. Fulke Doctor of Diuinitie, and
Master of Pembroke hall in Cambridge: to
the feeble Fortresse of Popish faith receiued
from ROME, and lately aduaunced
by THOMAS STAPLETON
Student in Diuinitie.
            
               THOMAS STAPLETON student
in Diuinitie, translated the 5. Bookes
of Bedes historie of y• English Church
into the English toung, before which
historie, it pleased him to set a table
of 45. differences, betweene the Primitiue
faith of England, continued almost a thousand
yeares, and the late pretended faith of the Protestants,
all which we will consider in order.
            First are fiue Apostolicall markes found in their
preachers, and wanting (as he saith) in ours.
            1 Augustine (whome he calleth their Apostle) shewed
the token of his Apostleship, in all patience, signes, and wonders,
Bed. 2. lib. 1. c. 30. &amp; 31. l. 2. c. 2. Miracles in confirmation
of their doctrine, Protestantes haue yet wrought none.
            I aunswere, Peter, Paul, Matthewe, Iames, Iohn, &amp;c.
are Apostles to vs, sent not from Gregorie of Rome,
but by Christ him selfe, out of Iewrie, y• signe of whose
Apostleship, being shewed in all patience, signes, and
wonders, and our doctrine being the same which we
haue receiued of their writings, needeth no other confirmation
of miracles, to be wrought by vs. If Augustine
sent from Gregorie a man, haue planted any humane
traditions, and confirmed them by li
                  •
               ing signes
and miracles, as a forerunner of Antichrist, which was
euen immediatly after his time to be openly shewed,
or if by subtill practice miracles haue bene feigned to
haue bene done by him, and reported by a credulous

man Bede, it hurteth not our cause:Gal. Mon. seeing other writers
report him to haue bene both a proud and a cruell
man. And yet we receiue all that doctrine which he
taught, agreeable to the doctrine of the Apostles of
Christ: what so euer he taught beside, we are not to receiue
it, of an Angell from heauen, much lesse of Augustine
from Rome.
            2 Their Apostles tendered vnitie, labouring to reduce the
Britaines to the vnitie of Christes Church. Nothing is more notorious
in Protestantes then their infamous dissention.
            Augustine in deede laboured to bring the Britons
in subiection to himselfe and to the Church of Rome,
which argueth no desire to Christian vnitie, but fauoureth
of Antichristian ambition and tyrannie, as his cruell
threatening executed vpon them, did shewe sufficiently.
            The dissention of the Protestants is not in articles of
faith: nor such, but that they are all brethren, that vnfeignedly
professe the doctrine of saluation: although
they dissent in the matter of the sacrament, in orders,
rytes, and ceremonies.
            3 Their Apostles were sent by an ordinarie vocation,
Protestantes haue preached without vocation or sending at all,
such as the Church of Christ requireth.
            They were sent by Pope Gregorie, who had none
ordinarie authoritie to send Apostles or preachers into
foreigne countries. Wherfore if they had any sending,
it was extraordinarie: of charitie, and not of office. The
Protestants that first preached in these last dayes, had
likewise extraordinaire calling. But if the calling of
the Papistes may be counted a lawfull calling: they
were called of the Popish Church to be preachers and
teachers, before they knewe or preached the trueth of
the Gospell.
            4 Their preaching was of God by Gamaliels reason, bicause
their doctrine continued 900. yeares, whereas the Protestantes
faith is already chaunged from Lutherane to Sacramentarie,
in lesse then 20. yeares.
            
               
This reason of Gamaliel would proue Mahometes
enterprise to be of God, bicause it hath likewise continued
900. yeares: &amp; yet it is false, that the Popish faith
hath had so long continuance. For the Papistes are departed
as from many other points of doctrine, so euen
from that of the Lords supper, which Augustine planted
among the Saxons, vnto carnall presence and transubstantiation,
the contrarie of which were taught by
Augustine, as appeareth by the publique Saxon Homely,
lately translated into English, and imprinted.
The diuersitie of opinions concerning the sacrament,
maketh no alteration of faith in them that agree in al
other necessarie articles. Besides that, it is most false
which he saith, that Luther of the Protestants is counted
a very Papist.
            5 Their Apostles taught such a faith, as putteth thinges;
by the beleefe and practise whereof, we may be saued. The faith
of the Protestants, is a deniall of Popish faith, and hath no affirma
                  •
               iue
doctrine, but that which Papistes had before.
            The Protestantes faith affirmeth, that a man is iustified
by it only. That the sacrifice of Christes death
is our onely propitiatorie sacrifice. That Christ is our
onely mediatour of redemption and intercession &amp;c.
Generally it affirmeth what so euer the Scripture teacheth,
and denieth the contrarie.
            Then followe 39. differences in doctrine.
            6 Their Apostles saide Masse; which the Protestantes
abhorre.
            The Popish Masse was not then all made, therefore
they could not say it. They ministred y• communion,
which Bede and other writers called Missa, they saide
no priuate Masse, such as the Papistes nowe defend.
            7 In the Masse is an externall sacrifice; offered to GOD
the father, the blessed body and bloud of Christ him selfe. lib. 5.
cap. 22. This doctrine is expresly reported. This seemeth blasphemie
to the Protestantes.
            The wordes of Bede, according to M. Stapletons
owne translation, are these, out of the Epislte of Ceolfride

to Naitan king of the Pictes. All Christian
Churches throughout the whole world (which al ioyned
together make but one Catholike Church) should
prepare bread and wine, for the mysterie of the flesh &amp;
precious bloud of that immaculat lambe, which tooke
away the sinnes of the world, &amp; when all lessons, prayers,
rytes, and ceremonies vsed in the solemne feast of
Easter, were done, should offer the same to God the father,
in hope of their redemption to come. Here is no
sacrifice of the body and bloud of Christ, but of bread
and wine for the mysterie thereof: no sacrifice propitiatorie
for sinnes, but of thankesgiuing, and remembrance
of the propitiation made by the lambe himselfe,
in hope of eternall redemption. No oblation by
by the priest only, but by the whole Church, and euery
member thereof, as was the oblation of the Paschall
lambe, wherevnto he compareth this sacrifice, interpreting
those wordes of Exod. 12. Euery man shal take
a lambe according to their families and housholdes, &amp;
offer him in sacrifice at the euening. That is to say,
(saith Ceolfride) all Christian Churches &amp;c. as before.
By which wordes it is manifest, that the Papistes nowe
adayes, are departed euen from that faith of the sacrament
and sacrifice thereof, that Augustine brought
from Rome.
            8 This sacrifice is taught to be propitiatorie: lib. 4. c. 22.
which Protestants abhorre.
            There is no mention of propitiatorie sacrifice in
that chapter, but there is told a tale of a prisoner, that
was loosed from his bonds, so oft as his brother which
was a Priest, saide Masse for his soule, supposing
he had bene slaine in battel: by which many were persuaded,
that the wholesome blessed sacrifice, was effectuous
to the euerlasting redemption and ransoming
both of soul and body. So were they worthie to be deceiued
that would build a doctrine without the word
of God, vpon the vncertaine report of men, who either
deuised this tale as being false, or else if it were so,

could not discerne the illusions of Sathan, seeking to
mainteine an errour, contrarie to the glorie of Christ.
            9 Confession of sinnes made to the priest, lib. 4. cap. 25. &amp;
27. This sacrament of the Protestantes is abolished.
            In neither of these chapters is mentioned the Popish
auricular confession, as a sacrament necessarie to saluation.
In the 25. mention is made of one, which being
troubled with conscience of an haynous sinne, came
to a learned priest to aske counsell of remedie, and
shewed what his offence was. In the 27. chapter it is
expresly saide, that all the people did openly declare
vnto S. Cutbert in confession, the things that they had
done. Such confession as either of both these were, the
Protestants haue not abolished, although they number
not confession among the sacraments.
            10 Satisfaction and penance for sinne enioyned, appeareth
lib. 4. cap. 25. which the Protestants court admitteth not.
            There is no word of satisfaction for his sinnes, but
of fasting and prayers, as fruites of repentance, wherevnto
he was first exhorted by the priest, according to
his power and abilitie, but he not content herewith,
vrged the priest to appoint him a certaine time of fasting,
for a whole weeke together, to whose infirmitie
the priest somwhat yelding, willed him to fast two
or three dayes in a weeke, vntill he returned to giue
him farther aduice. Euery man may see broad difference
betwixt this counsel and Popish satisfaction and penance.
            11 Merite of good workes in this storie is eftsoones iustified.
lib. 4. cap. 14. &amp; 15. which the Protestants count preiudidiciall
to Gods glorie.
            In the 14. chapter there is no mention of the merite
of good workes, but that after the brethren had fasted
and prayed, God deliuered them of the pestilence. We
neuer denied, but that God regardeth our praier and
fasting, though not as meritorious, but as our obedience
which he requireth of vs, and saueth vs onely for
his mercy sake. The 15. chapter scarse toucheth any

matter of religion, and therefore I knowe not what he
meaneth to quote it, except it be a error of y• Printer.
            12 Intercession of Saints, Protectants abhorre the practise,
whereof appeareth lib. 1. cap. 20. &amp; lib. 4. cop. 14.
            In the former place Beda supposeth, that God gaue
the Britaines victorie at the intercession of S. Albane,
but where learned he this kinde of intercession, out of
the holy scriptures?
            In the latter place a boy being sicke of the plague,
reporteth, that God would cease the plague, at the intercession
of S. Oswald: as the Apostles Peter and Paul
declared to him in a vision. But seeing the Apostles
haue taught no such doctrine in their writings, they
haue admonished vs to beware of such fantasticall visions.
Gal. 1. 2 Thessa. 2.
            13 The Clergie of their primitiue Church after holy orders
taken, doe not marrie, lib. 1. cap. 27. Nowe after holy orders
and vowe to the contrarie, priestes doe marrie.
            The Counsell of Gregorie to Augustine is this. If
there be any among the Cleargie out of holy orders,
which can not liue chast, they shall take wiues. These
wordes cōmaund some of the Cleargie to take wiues,
they forbid not the rest to marrie. For what shall they
that are in holy orders doe, if they can not liue chast?
Againe, the histories are plentifull that Priestes were
married in England three or foure hundreth yeares
after Augustine.
            14 In their primitiue Church the vow of chastitie was thought
godly and practised: now they are counted damnable &amp; broken.
            Such vowes as were made without consideration of
mens abilitie to performe them, are iustly accounted
rash and presumptuous. Such is the vowe of virginitie
in a great many, which our sauiour Christ affirmeth to
be a rare gift, not in euery mans power. As for the
vowe of chastitie, if any were made by Popishe
priestes, it was oftener broken before the restoring of
true knowledge, then since. Whose incontinencie hath
infected the world with whoredome and vncleannesse.
            
               
15 Such Monkes and virgines liued in cloysters, in obedience
and pouertie, which are ouerthrowne of Protestants as a
damnable estate.
            The horrible abuse of Cloystrall life, hath caused
the subuersion of them, beside their errours, superstition
and idolatrie.
            16 Prayer for the dead, Dirige ouer night, and Requiem
Masse in the morning, was an accustomed manner, lib. 3. cap. 2.
lib. 4 cap. 21. which the Protestants count to be abhomination.
            Praier for the dead is an older errour then Popish
religion. But Dirige and Requiem Masse had an other
meaning, lib. 3. cap. 2. then the Papistes haue now, for
there it is saide. In the selfe same place the religious
men of Hagustalden Church, haue nowe of long time
bene accustomed to come euery yeare, the eue and the
day that the same king Oswald was afterward slaine,
to keepe Diriges there for his soule, and in the morning,
after Psalmes being saide solemnely, to offer for
him the sacrifice of holy oblation. You must vnderstand,
that this Oswald was of them that so did, taken
for an holy martyr, and therfore these Psalmodies and
sacrifices were of thanksgiuing for the rest of his soul:
not of propitiation for his sinnes, as the Papistes account
them. lib. 4. cap. 21. there is nothing to the matter
in hand, but in the next chapter following, is the
tale of him that was loosed from his fetters by saying
of Masse, by the relation whereof, and not by the word
of God, many beganne to thinke the sacrifice of the
Masse profitable for the dead.
            17 Reseruation of the sacrament thought no superstition,
lib. 4. cap. 24. nowe counted prophanation of the sacrament.
            Reseruation was an older errour then Poperie, yet
contrarie to the commaundement of Christ: Take ye,
and eate ye.
            18 Houseling before death vsed, as necessarie for all true
Christians, lib. 4. cap. 3. &amp; 24. Protestants vnder pretence of a
Communion, doe nowe wickedly bereaue Christian folke of it.
            These chapters shewe that it was vsed, but not that

it was vsed as necessarie. The Communion of the ficke
is also vsed of vs. Neither can M. Stapleton proue, that
it was then ministred to the sicke person alone, as is vsed
among them. But in the 24. chapter of the 4. booke
it may be gathered, that as many as were present with
the partie, receiued with him, bicause there was a mutuall
demaund of his being in charitie with them, and
they with him.
            19 Consecrating of Monkes and Nunnes by the handes of
the Bishop, a practised solemnitie in their primitiue Church,
lib. 4. cap. 19. &amp; 23. which Protestantes by the libertie of their
Gospell laugh and scorne at.
            Chap. 19. it is saide, that Wilfride gaue to Ethelrede
the vaile and habite of a Nunne, and cap. 23. that one
Hein tooke the vowe &amp; habite of a Nunne, being blessed
and consecrated by Bishop Aidan. In those elder
times, no virgine was suffered to professe virginitie, but
by the iudgement of the Bishop, who was not onely a
minister of the ceremonie of profession, but also a
iudge of the expedience and lawfulnesse of the vowe,
so that the vowe of virginitie was moderated and kept
within more tollerable boūds, then is vsed of the Papistes.
            20. Commemoration of Saints at Masse time, lib. 4. cap. 14
&amp; 18. such commemorations in the Protestants Communion
are excluded, as superstitious and vnlawfull.
            Chap. 14. it it saide vpon the report of a boyes vision,
And therefore let them say Masses, and giue thanks
that their praier is heard, and also for the memorie of
the same king Oswald, which somtime gouerned their
nation. Admitting this vision to be true, here is but
Masse and memorie of thankesgiuing: in the 18. chap.
is nothing to any such purpose. In the Communion of
our Church is a thankesgiuing, with Angels, Archangels,
and all the glorious companie of heauen, although
we make no speciall mention of any one Saint
by name.
            21 Pilgrimage to holy places, especially to Rome, a much

waitie matter of all estates, lib. 4. cap. 3. &amp; 23. &amp; lib. 5. cap. 7.
Nothing soundeth more prophane and barbarous in the eares
of Protestants.
            In the first of these places, there is mention of pilgrimage
into Ireland, not for y• holinesse of the place.
but for the wholsome instruction that then was there.
For it seemeth by the storie in many places, that Ireland
(although not subiect to y• See of Rome) was thē
replenished with godly learned men, of whome men
sought out of Britaine, to be informed in religion.
Peregrination to Rome was vsed of superstition, and
opinion of great learning to be had from thence. Yet
was there no pilgrimage to images, nor to Rome, so
filthie a sinke of all abhominations, as it hath bene
since those dayes.
            22 Of the reliques of holy men, of reuerence vsed towards
them, and miracles wrought by them, the historie is ful. Nothing
is more vile in the sight of Protestantes, then such deuotion of
Christians.
            Such superstition and credulitie of the former age,
is iustly misliked of vs, but the idolatrie and forging
of reliques, which is too common among the Papists,
is rightly detested of vs.
            23 Blessing with the signe of the Crosse, accounted no superstition,
lib. 4. cap. 24. &amp; lib. 5. cap. 2. In the deuotion of the
Protestants is esteemed magike.
            Signing with the signe of the Crosse, which sometime
against the Gentiles was an indifferent ceremonie:
vsed of the Papistes for an ordinarie forme of blessing,
is both superstitious and idolatrous.
            24 Solemnitie of buriall Protestantes despise, whereas it
was the deuotion of their primitiue Church, to be buried in monasteries,
Churches, and chappels.
            Honourable buriall of the Saintes bodies, which
were the temples of the holy Ghost, and are laide vp
in hope of a glorious resurrection, Protestantes despise
not. Yet were the first Archbishops of Canturburie
buried in a Porch beside the Church, lib. 2. cap. 3.

There was no buriall place appointed in the Monasterie
of Berking, vntil by a light it was reuealed, as
the historie saith, lib. 4. cap. 7. but with time superstition
on of buriall grewe, yet nothing comparable in that
age to the superstition of Papists of these latter times.
There was no buriall in S. Frances Coule, nor after
the Popish solemnitie.
            25 Benediction of the Bishop as superiour to the people,
was vsed, which Protestants scorne at, lib. 4. cap. 11.
            The Protestantes allowe benediction of the Bishop
in the name of God, as the superiour, although they
iustly deride the Popish maner of blessing, by cutting
the aire with crosses: neither is there any such blessing
spoken of in the chapter by him cited.
            26 The seruice of the Church was at the first planting of
their faith in the Latine and learned tongue, lib. 1. cap. 29. lib. 4.
cap. 18. which the Protestants haue altered.
            There is no such thing to be proued in the first
place, nor any thing sounding the way, but only this,
that Gregorie sent into England to Augustine many
bookes, of which it is a Popish consequence to gather,
that they were bookes of Latine seruice. In the latter
it is declared, that Iohn ye Chaunter of Rome, brought
from thence the order of singing, and reading: and put
many things in writing, which pertained to the celebration
of high feastes and holidayes, for the whole
compasse of the yeare. But this being almost an hundreth
yeres after the cōming of Augustine, it appeareth
the Church of England had no such Latine seruice before.
For Gregorie willed Augustine to gather out of
euery Church, what ceremonies he thought expedient
for the English Church, and bound him not to the orders
or seruice of the Church of Rome. And it may
be gathered, that long after there was no certain forme
of administration of the sacramentes put in writing &amp;
generally receiued; but that the priestes which then
were learned, ordered the same according to their discretion,
for their chiefe labour was in preaching and

instructing. For Beda reporteth vpon the credite of one
which liued in his time, and was Abbot of Wye, Herebald
by name, that he being in great extremitie and
daunger of death, by falling from an horse, S. Iohn of
Beuerlaye the Bishop, that was his master, asked him
whether he knewe without all scruple or doubt, that
he was baptized or no, to whome hee aunswered, that
he certainely knewe that he was baptized, and tolde
the priestes name that baptized him. To whome the
Bishop replied, saying: If you were baptized of him,
doubtlesse you were not well baptized: for I knowe
him well, and am right well assured, that when he was
made priest, he could not for his dulheaded wit, learn,
neither to instruct nor to baptize. And for that cause I
haue streightly charged him, not to presume to that
ministerie which he could not do accordingly. By this
it may be gathered, that the forme of baptisme was
not set downe in writing, which euery dulheaded dogbolt
priest can reade, but that it was referred to the
learning of the minister which did instruct them that
were of age, and came to receiue baptisme. But this ignorant
priest whome S. Iohn of Beuerlay depriued of
his ministerie, could neither cathechise nor baptize: for
which cause, the yong man being cathechised againe,
and after he recouered of his fall, was baptized a newe,
as one that was not rightly baptized before. Moreouer,
lib. 4. cap. 24. Beda sheweth of one Cednom in the
Abbay of Hilda, to whome was giuen miraculously
the gift of Singing and making Hymnes for religion
in his mother tongue, of the creation of the world, and
all histories of the olde Testament, of the incarnation,
passion, resurrection, and ascention of Christ, &amp;c.
which by all likelihoode were vsed in the Churches.
And when Latine seruice was first vsed, it is not incredible,
but that the people did meetely well vnderstand
it, for the Latine tongue was in those days vnderstood
in most places of the Westerne Church. And Beda noteth
some especially which vnderstoode no language

but the Saxon. The interpreters which Augustine
brought out of Fraunce, do confirme this coniecture.
For the rude Latine tongue spoken in France, was better
vnderstood of the vulgar people, then that was spoken
at Rome and in Italie: for which cause, there was
a Canon made in the third Councel at Toures, that the
Homilies should be turned in rusticam Romanam linguam,
into the rude Latin tongue, that they might
more easily be vnderstoode of all men. Againe,
the Britaines and Pictes which conuerted the greatest
part of the Saxons, howe could they haue been vnderstood
preaching in Welsh, but that the vulgare Latine
tongue was a common language to them both. Finally,
the manifolde vses of diuers Churches, as Sarum,
Yorke, &amp;c. declare, that the Latine seruice was but lately
in comparison set downe, when knowledge decayed
both in the Priestes and the people.
            27 Protestants haue plucked downe altars, which they
had of olde time.
            They had altars, but standing in the middest of
the Church, as y• tables stood in the Primitiue Church.
            28 Altar clothes and vestments vsed of them, Protestants
admit not.
            A sorie ceremonie, in which no part of Christianitie
consisteth. The like I say of the 29. holy vessels, 30.
holy water, and 31. Ecclesiasticall censure, about which
there was no small adoe.
            32 Their primitiue Church was gouerned by Synodes of
the Clergie only, in determining controuersies of religion, which
Protestants haue called from thence vnto the Lay court onely.
            The latter part is a slaunder vpon the Protestantes,
the former part a lye vpon the auncient Saxons, for at
the Synode holden at Strenshalch,Vz. Whitby in Yorkshire. not only the kings
Oswine &amp; Alfride were present, but also king Oswine
did order the Synode, and in the end concluded the
matter in controuersie, lib. 3. cap. 25.
            33 The spirituall rulers of the primitiue Church were Bishops
and pastours duely consecrated, protestants haue no consecration,

no true Bishops at all.
            This is an other lewd slander against ye Protestants,
for they haue true Bishops, though not cōsecrated after
the Popish manner. Laurence the second Archbishop of
Canterburie, acknowledgeth the Ministers of ye Scots
and Britaines for Bishops, although they were not
subiect to the Church and See of Rome, lib. 2. cap. 4.
Aidanus, Finanus, Colmanus, are iudged of Beda for
true Bishops, although they were deuided from the
Church of Rome, and so are such Bishops as were ordeined
by them, for they conuerted the greatest part
of the Saxons vnto Christian faith: As Northumbrians,
Mertians, and East Saxons.
            34 Protestants haue brought the supreme gouernement of
the Church to the Lay authoritie: in the primitiue faith of our
countrie the Lay was subiect to the Bishop in spirituall causes.
            And so are they nowe in suche causes as they
were subiecte then. But that the supreame authoritie
was in the ciuill Magistrate at that time, it may
appeare by these reasons. First Pope Gregorie him self
calleth the Emperour Mauritius his souereigne Lord,
lib. 1. cap. 23. &amp; 28. &amp; 29. &amp; 30. and after him Pope Honorius
called Heraclius his souereigne Lord, lib. 2. 18.
King Sonwalch Preferred Agilbert and Wini to be Bishops,
afterward he deposed Wini, which for mony
bought for Wulfher king of Mercia the See of London,
lib. 3. cap. 7.
            Earcombert king of Kent, of his princely authoritie
purged his realme of idolatrie, and commaunded that
the fast of 40. dayes should be kept, lib. 3. cap. 8.
            King Oswine ordered the Synod at Strenshalch, li.
3. cap. 25. Oswine and Ecgbert kings, deliberate touching
the peacable gouernement of the Church, and by
the choice and consent of the Cleargie, did nominate
Wighard Archbishop of Canturburie, lib. 3. cap. 29.
            King Ecgfride deposed Bishop Wilfride, li. 4. ca. 12.
            Ost for at ye cōmandemēt of king Edilred was cōsecrated
by Wilfrid Bish. of ye Victians, li. 4. ca. 23. These

places of the historie shewe, that kings had chiefe authoritie
both ouer persons and causes Ecclesiasticall,
such as we nowe acknowledge our Princes to haue.
            35 The finall determination of spiritual causes rested in
the See Apostolike of Rome; which is nowe detested of protestantes.
            Although the See of Rome vsurped much in those
dayes, yet was not the authoritie thereof acknowledged
by the Churches of the Britaines, Irish, and Scots.
The Britaines before Augustines time sent not to
Rome, but vnto Fraunce for ayde against the Pelagian
heretikes. At Augustines comming and long after,
they refused to yelde obedience to the See of Rome;
yea among the Saxons them selues, Wilfrid deposed
by the king, and absolued by the Pope, could not be
restored, but by a Synod of his own countrie, li. 5. c. 20.
            36 Their faith and Apostles came from the See of Rome:
the protestant departeth there fro.
            The Protestantes are returned to the auncient faith
which was in this land before Augustine came from
Rome, which did not so much good in planting faith
where it was not, as in corrupting y• sinceritie of faith
where it was before he came.
            37 Their faith was first preached with crosse and procession,
Heresies first raged by throwing downe the crosse, and altering
the procession therewith.
            The Popish faith beganne with superstition, which
the Christian Catholikes haue iustly abolished.
            38 Their first Apostles were Monkes. The first preachers
of the protestants haue bene apostataes, as Luther, Oecolampadius,
Martyr, &amp;c.
            Nay, they haue returned from apostasie to the true
faith and religion of Christ. Augustine and the rest of
the Monkes of that time, differed much from the Popish
Monkes of the latter dayes. For they were learned
preachers, lib. 3. cap. 26. these idle loyterers: they
laboured with their handes, lib. 5. cap. 19. these liued of
the sweat of other mens browes. They made no such

vow but they might serue the common wealth, if they
were called thereto. Sigbard of a Monke was made
King, lib. 4. cap. 11. these professed them selues dead to
all honest trauell, either in the Church or common
wealth.
            39 The first impes of their faith, and schollers of the Apostles,
were holy mē. Luther confesseth his schollers to be worse
then they were vnder the Pope.
            There were hypocrits in those daies, also there were
incontinent Nunnes, lib. 4. cap. 25. And Beda confesseth,
that Aidane (which was no slaue of the Romish
See) was more holy, then y• Cleargie of his time, whose
deuotion was key colde. If Luther flattered not his
scholers, he is more to be commended, yet can not Stapleton
proue, that he speaketh so of all, but of some
carnall professours only.
            40 Their first preacher liued apostolically in voluntarie
pouertie. This Apostolicall perfection protestants that beare
them selues for the Apostles of England, neither practise them
selues, nor can abide in other.
            First it is a slaunder, that any Protestantes beare thē
selues for Apostles of England: secondly, let the world
iudge whether the preachers of the Gospel, come nearer
to the pouertie of the Apostles, then the Pope their
great Apostle of the Romish Church, with the rest of
the pillers of the same, the Cardinals, &amp;c.
            41 Their faith builded vp Monasteries and Churches,
protestants haue throwne downe many, erected none.
            The first Monasteries were Colledges of learned
preachers, and builded for that end. King Edilwald
builded a Monasterie, wherein he &amp; his people might
resort to heare the word of God, to pray, and to burie
their dead, lib. 3. cap. 23. The like practise was in the
Abbay of Hilda lib. 4. Ca. 23. From which vse seeing
they were of late degenerated into idlenesse and filthie
lustes, they were lawfully suppressed. And as
for building of Churches, where they lacke, Protestants
haue and do imploy their indeuour.

42 By the first Christians of their faith, God was serued
day and night, protestants haue abolished all seruice of God by
night, and done to the diuell a most acceptable sacrifice.
            Protestants haue abolished no seruice of GOD by
night, but such as was either impious or superstitious,
for they also serue God both day and night, euen with
publique praier, and exercise of hearing the word of
God preached.
            43 By the deuotion of the people, first imbracing their
faith, much voluntarie oblations were made to the Church, by
the rechlesse religion of the Protestantes due oblations are denied
to the Church.
            Of them that be true professours of the Gospell,
both due oblations are paide, and much voluntarie
oblations also, for the maintenance of the preachers,
for reliefe of the poore, the straunges and captiues, &amp;c.
            44 Princes endued the Church with possessions and reuenues.
The lewde loosenesse of the Protestants hath stirred princes
to take from the Churches possessions so giuen.
            Nay, the pride, couetousnesse, and luxuriousnesse of
Popish Cleargie, haue moued them to do that is done
in that behalfe.
            45 Last of all, their faith reduced the Scottishmen liuing
in schisme, to the vnitie of the Catholike Church. This late alteration
hath moued them from vnitie to schisme.
            Nay, their superstition at length corrupted the sinceritie
of faith in the Britaines and Scots, and from the
vnitie of ye Catholike Church of Christ, brought them
vnder the schismaticall faction of the See of Rome,
from which they are nowe againe returned with vs,
God be thanked, to the vnitie of Christes true Catholike
and Apostolike Church.
            These differences which he hath either falsely obserued,
or else craftily collected out of the drosse and
dregges of that time, he promiseth to proue, to concurre
with the beliefe &amp; practise of the first 600. yeres,
in the second part of his feeble fortresse, which is easily
blowne ouer, with one word. Although some of

these corruptions haue bene receiued within the first
600. yeares, yet is he not able to proue, that they haue
bene from the beginning, and so continued all that
time, wherefore his Fortresse will doe them small
pleasure, to establish them for Christian truthes, which
haue had a later beginning then our Sauiour Christ
and his Apostles.
            But for as much as he hath gathered differences of
the first Church of the Saxons from ours, I haue also
gathered differences of the same from theirs at this
time, and let the readers iudge of both indifferently.
            1 The Church of English Saxons for 300. yeares
after Augustine, did beleeue bread and wine to remain
in the sacrament after consecration, which the Papists
denie, proued by a Sermon extant in the Saxon tong,
translated out of Latine by Aelfrike Archbishop of
Canturburie or Abbot of S. Albones, appointed to be
read vnto the people at Easter before they receiued the
Communion, also by two Epistles of ye same Aelfrike.
            2 The Church of English Saxons beleeued the
sacrament to be the body and bloud of Christe, not
carnally but spiritually, expressely denying as wel the
carnall presence as transubstantiation which the Papistes
holde Aelf. Serm. Pasc &amp; Ep.
            3 The Church of English Saxons did giue the
communion vnder both kinds vnto the people, which
the Papistes doe not, Aelf. Serm. Pasc &amp; Beda lib, 1. cap.
27. &amp; lib. 5. cap. 22.
            4 The Priestes of that time said no priuate Masse
on working dayes, but onely on holy dayes, which
therefore were called Masse dayes, Aelfr. Ser. Pasc. Popish
priestes euery day.
            5 The people did then communicate with the
priest, Beda lib. 2. cap. 5. The Popish priest eateth and
drinketh all alone.
            6 The English Saxon Church did celebrate Easter
with the olde Iewes in one faith, although they differ

from them in the kind of external sacraments: whereby
they affirmed the substance of the sacraments of
both the testaments to be all one, which the Papistes
denie. Aelfr. Serm. Pasc. &amp; Epist. Bed lib. 5. ca. 22.
            7 The sacrament of the Lordes Supper was not
then hanged vp to be worshipped nos caried in procession,
bicause they had not the opinion of carnal presence
which the Papistes haue, &amp;c.
            8 The English Saxons Church denied, that wicked
men receiued the body and bloud of Christ. Aelfr.
Serm. Pasc. The Papistes holde, that not onely wicked
men, but also brute beasts eate the body of Christ,
if they eate the externall sacrament thereof.
            9 The English Saxons allowed the Scriptures to
be read of the people in the Saxon tong, whereof Canutus
made a lawe, that all Christian men should diligently
search the lawe of God. The Papistes denie
the search of Gods lawe to all Christian men, that are
not of the Cleargie, or learned in the Latine tong.
            10 The English Saxons decreed in Synode after
Latine seruice preuailed, and the knowledge of Latine
decaied, that the priestes shuld say vnto the people on
Sundayes and holy dayes, the interpretation of that
Gospel in English. Aelfr. lib. Can. which the Papistes
neither do nor will suffer to be done.
            11 The English Saxons commaunded that al men
should be instructed by the Priestes to say the Lordes
praier, the Creede, &amp; the ten Commaundements in the

            12 The English Saxons decreed in Synode, and
king Canutus made a lawe, that the priestes should instruct
the people in the vnderstanding of the Lordes
praier, the Creede, &amp;c. vbi supra, which the Papistes altogether
neglect, affirming ignorance to be the mother
of deuotion.
            13 The worshipping of images, and the second

Councel of Nice that decreed the same, was accursed
of the Church of God in England and France, &amp; written
against by Alcuinus, in the name of the Church of
England and Fraunce. Math. West. Symeon Dunel.
Rog. Houed &amp;c. The Papistes defend both that idolatrous
Councel, and their wicked decree.
            14 The Priestes in the primitiue Saxon Church,
were married for three or foure hundreth yeares, witnesse
all histories of England, which the Papistes doe
not allowe.
            15 The vowe of chastitie was not exacted of them
that were made Priests, for the space of more then 400.
yeares after the ariuall of Augustine into Kent, which
decree was made by Lanfrancus in a Synode at Winchester,
Anno 1076.
            16 Notwithstanding this decree and many other,
both Priestes refused to make that vow, and kept their
wiues by the kings leaue. Gerard. Ebor Ep. ad Anselm.

            17 Lanfrancus decreed, that such priestes as had
wiues, should not be compelled to put them away, the
Papistes enforce Priestes to put away their wiues.
            18 The Popes yt were founders of ye English Saxon
church, acknowledged the Emperors to be their souereigne
Lordes. Bed. li. 1. cap. 23. lib. 2. cap. 18

might be cōsecrated in England, wtout trauelling

            20 Pope Gregorie exhorteth king Ethelbert to set
forth the faith of Christ to his subiectes, to forbid the
worship of idols, &amp;c. Bed. lib. 1. cap 32. The Papistes
would not haue the ciuill magistrate gouerne in Ecclesiasticall
causes.
            21 And least you should say (as M. Sander doth)
that the king was herein the Bishops Commissarie.
Earcombert king of Kent of his princely authoritie
purged his realme of idolatrie, and commaunded the
fast of 40. dayes to be kept. Bed. lib. 3. cap. 8. The Papistes

denie that a king may doe such things of his
princely authoritie.
            22 Kings in those times preferred men to Bishoprikes,
Bed. lib. 3 cap. 7. which the Papistes affirme to be
vnlawfull.
            23 Kings in those dayes deposed Bishops, as Senwalch
did Wini, Bed. li. 3. cap. 7. Ecgfrid deposed Wilfride,
lib. 4. ca. 12. which the Papists do not admit.
            24 King Ecgfride would not receiue Wilfrid being
restored by the Pope, Bed. lib. 4. cap. 13. &amp; lib. 5.
cap. 10. The Papistes count it blasphemie not to obey
the Popes decree.
            25 The same Wilfride being againe depriued by
means of king Aldfride, and being the second time absolued
by ye Pope, could not be restored to his Bishoprike.
but by a Synode of his owne Cleargie, Bed. lib. 5.
cap. 20. By which it appeareth, the Cleargie were not
then in perfect slauerie to the Pope.
            26 Kings in those dayes were present at Synodes,
and ordered them, and concluded in them as Oswine
did at Strenshalch, lib. 3. cap. 25.
            27 Archbishops were commaunded by Kings to
consecrate Bishops, as Wilfride was to consecrate Ostfor
at the commaundement of king Edilred, Bed li. 4.
cap. 23. Papistes denie Kings to haue souereigne authoritie
in ecclesiasticall causes.
            28 Priuileges of Monasteries sought at Rome, had
first the consent of the king vnto them, Bed. lib. 4. cap.
18. Papistes of later times seeke priuileges against the
kings will.
            29 Monkes in yt time were called to serue ye Cō
               mon
wealth, as Sighard a Monke was made king of ye
East Saxons, lib. 4. ca. 11. Papistes call such Apostataes.
            30 Monasteries were thē Colleges of learned mē
to furnish the Church with Ministers and Bishops, li. 4
ca. 23. Among Papists they be stals to feed idle bellies,
yt serue neither the Church nor the Common wealth.
            31 Studie of the Scriptures and hand labour was

the exercise of Monkes in those first and better times,
Bed. lib. 4. cap. 3. Idlenesse and vaine ceremonies is the
exercise of Popish Monkes.
            32 Monasteries were founded, that men might in
them heare the word of God, and pray. Bed. li. 3. ca. 23.
Popish Monasteries in latter times were builded only
to pray for mens soules, and to say Masses in them, &amp;c.
            33 Vpon Sundayes the people vsed ordinarily to
flocke to Churches and Monasteries to heare the word
of God. Bed. lib. 3. cap. 26. In popish Monasteries there
neither was nor is any ordinarie resort to heare the
word of God, nor any ordinarie preaching.
            34 The Monkes of that time were all learned
preachers, Bed. lib. 3. cap. 26. The Popish Monkes are
most vnlearned, and fewe preachers out of their dens.
            35 In those dayes euery Priest and Clearke was a
preacher, so that when any came to any towne, ye people
would resort to them to be taught of them. Bed.
lib. 4. cap. 16. The greatest number of Popish Priestes
in these latter dayes, are most ignorant Asses, and void
of all spirituall vnderstanding.
            36 Vnlearned Priestes were forbidden to serue in
the Church, Bed. lib. 5. cap. 6. in so much that S. Iohn of
Beuerley baptized againe a young man, which was
baptized of an vnlearned Priest. The Papistes allowe
vnlearned Priestes to baptise and say Masse, that can
not cathechise and instruct their hearers.
            37 Songes and Hymnes out of the holy Scriptures
were made meete for religion in the mother tongue.
Bed. lib. 4. cap. 24. Papistes can abide no songs of scripture
in the English tongue.
            38 Anchorets of that time laboured with their
handes, Bed. lib. 4. cap. 28. Popish Anchorets liue idly,
and labour not with their hands.
            39 Dirige and Masse was saide for Saint Oswaldes
soule, by which it is manifest, that they esteemed
the Masse to be a sacrifice of thankesgiuing. lib. 3.
cap. 2.
            
               
40 Bega a Nunne, after she sawe the soule of the
Abbesse Hilda carried into heauen, exhorted her sisters
to be occupied in prayers and Psalmes for her soule.
Whereby it appeareth that the doctrine of purgatory
was not yet confirmed among them. Lib. 4. ca. 23. Nothing
is so certainly defended among Papistes as purgatorie.
            41 Holy men fasted then with eating of milke,
as Egbert. Bed. lib. 3. ca. 27. and Cedda fasted lent with
egges and milk lib. 3. ca. 23. Papists of later times haue
vtterly forbidden all white meates in Lent and fasting
dayes.
            42 There was a Church of Christ in Britaine before
the comming of Augustine not subiect to the
see of Rome, which continued long after his comming
lib. 2. cap. 4. The Papistes account none Christians, but
such as be bondslaues to the see of Rome.
            43 Laurence the 2. Archbishop. of Canter. accompteth
the Bishops of the Scottes and Britaines for Bishops,
although they were not subiect to the see nor
Church of Rome. Bed lib. 3 cap. 4. The Papistes take
none for Bishops that be not vnder the see of Rome.
            44 The Churches of the Britaines were builded
after another forme then the Churches of the Romish
obedience Bed. lib. 3. cap. 4. The Papistes affirme there
were no Churches euer builded but in fashion and
vse of poperie.
            45 The Schottish Churche instructed from Ireland
obserued all such workes of deuotion as they
could finde in the Prophetes, Gospels, and Apostles
writings, and therefore of Bede and the Englishe
Church were acknowledged for Christians, although
they would not become members of the Churche of
Rome Bed. li. 3. ca. 4. The Papistes hold that there is no
saluation out of the Church of Rome; which is a newe
Church in England, in comparison of the elder that
was before Augustines time.
            46 Aidanus a preaching Bishop hauing no possessions,

labouring to fulfill all that was written in the
holy scriptures, the prophets and Apostles, shining in
miracles both in his life time and after his death, was
neuer subiect to the Church of Rome, yet accounted a
Saint of the Church in those dayes Bed. lib. 3. cap. 16.
The Papistes allowe no saintes but canonized by their
Pope.
            47 The exercise of Aidanus company both shorne
and lay men, was reading of the Scriptures and learning
of the Psalmes Bed. lib. 3. cap. 5. The exercise of
Popish Bishops servants is nothing lesse.
            48 The greatest parte of the English Saxons, were
converted to Christianitie, by the Britaines &amp; Scottes
that were no members of the Church of Rome. As all
the kingdome of Northumberland both Bernicians &amp;
Deires, were conuerted by Aidanus except a fewe persons
whom Paulmus the Romaine in long time had
gained. The whole kingdome of Mercia, which was
the greatest part of England, receiued the faith and
baptisme of Finanus the Scot the successour of Aidanus
Bed. lib. 3. cap. 21. The East Saxons by Cedda
that was also of the Scottishe ordering lib. 3. cap. 22.
The Papistes affirme that all our religion came from
Rome.
            49 Ceadda was consecrated by Wini bishop of
the West Saxons, assisted by two Britain Bishops that
were not subiect to the see of Rome, &amp; was neuerthelesse
accompted for a lawfull bishop Bed. lib 3. 28.
            50 Beda accounted Gregorie for the Apostle of
the Englishmen lib. 2. cap. 1. The Papistes nowe take
Augustine for their Apostle.
            I omit many other opinions and ordinances of that
age: as Augustine would haue none forced to religion,
that Wednesday should be fasting day. The bishop of
London should haue a pall as well as Yorke &amp;c.
wherein the Papistes differ from them that bragge of
nothing but antiquity, vniuersalitie and consent.
         
         
            
            AN OVERTHROW
of Stapletons Fortresse, or as he calleth
it himselfe, the piller
of Papistrie.
            The first Booke.
            
               CAP. I.
               AN introduction, declaring the necessitie of the matter to
be treated vpon,Stapleton. and the order which the auothour wil take
in treating thereof.
               OMitting the necessitie of the mater,Fulke. his order
which he promiseth to keepe is this. First he wil
proue, if he can, that Papistrie is the only true Christianitie.
This proposition he will followe by two principall
partes. In the former he will proue by authority
of Scriptures, and answering of the aduersaries obiections,
that the Church cannot possibly erre. Secondly
that this Church must be a knowne Church, that
no malignant Church can preuaile against it: that Papistrie
can be no schisme nor heresie. In the latter part
after a fewe reasonable demandes that protestantes
must not refuse to answere, putting the case that the
knowne Church of 900. yeares is a kinde of papistry,
he will proue that the faith of protestants is differing
from that was first planted among Englishe men in
more then fortie pointes, and that in all those pointes
of difference, he wil shew they agree with the first 600.
yeares, which he saith (but falsely) that protestants offer
to be tried by. For although the Bishop of Sarum
made challenge of many articles nowe holden of the
Papistes, not to be founde within the compasse of the
first 600. yeares, and therefore to be newe and false
doctrines, yet neither he, nor any protestant liuing,
or dead, did euer agree to receiue what doctrine so euer

was taught within the first sixe hundreth yeares.
But this I dare avowe, that what article of doctrine so
euer we do affirme, that same hath bene affirmed of the
godly fathers of the primitiue Church, what so euer
we denie, the same can not be proued to haue ben vniuersally
affirmed and receiued of all the godly fathers
by the space of the 600. yeares together.
            
            
               CAP. II.
               That protestantes doe condemne the vuiuersal Church of
Christ of these many hundreth yeares,Stapleton. and the reason of the
whole disputation following grounded therevpon.
               To prooue that the Protestants condemne the uniuersall
Church of Christ these many hundreth yeares,Fulke.
he alledgeth the sayinges of some Protestants, miserably
wrested from their meaning: that Latimer was
our Apostle, that Luther begat trueth, that the Gospel
doth arise in the first appearing of the Gospel, &amp;c: or
as though by these sayings &amp; such like they should deny,
that euer there had ben any Churche in the worlde
before these times, whereas euery childe may vnderstand,
they speake of the restitution of the truth of the
Gospel into the open sight of the world, in these latter
days. Likewise where some haue written, that the Pope
hath blinded the world these many hundreth yeares,
some say a thousand yeres, some 1200. some 900. some
500. &amp;c. And the Apologie affirmeth that Christ hath
saide: the Church should erre, he cauilleth that all the
Church for so many yeares is condemned of all error.
Whereas it is euident to them that will vnderstande
that although some erronious opinions haue preuailed,
&amp; in processe of time haue increased in the greatest
part of the Church, for many hundreth yeares, yet so
long as the only foundation of saluatiō was reteined,
the vniuersall Church of Christe so many hundreth
yeares is not condemned. But when Antichrist (the

mysterie of whose iniquitie wrought in the Apostles
time. 2. Thess. 2.) was openly shewed, and that apostasy
which the Apostle foresheweth, was fulfilled then and
from that time, whensoeuer it was, not the vniuersall
Church of Christ is condemned, but the general apopasie
of Antichrist is detected.
               
                  THE ARGVMENT WHEREVP-on
this first part of the vawmure of this
Fortresse is builded, is thus framed
by the builder
himselfe.
                  The knowen Church of Christ doth continew, and shall continue
alwayes,Stapleton. without interruption in the true and vpright
faith.
                  But papistrie was the onely knowne Church of Christ all these
nine hundreth yeares.
                  Ergo papistrie all these nine hundreth yeares hath continued
and shal continue alwayes euen to the worldes end without interruption
in the true and vpright faith.
                  This argument hath neuer a legge to stande vpon,Fulke.
for vnderstanding (as he doeth) the knowen Church,
to be that which is knowne to the world, to continue
without interruption: so knowne to the worlde, the
maior is false. For although the Church shall continue
alwayes without interruption, yet it shall not
continue alwayes so knowne, but, as in the dayes of
Elias, be hid from the outward viewe of men.
                  Againe, the minor, that Papistrie was the only knowen
Church, vnderstanding (as he doth) that it was only
reputed, taken, and acknowledged so to be, it is vtterly
false. For the Greeke &amp; Orientall Church, which
is not the Popish Church, hath beene reputed, taken,
and acknowledged to be the Church of Christ, by as
great a nomber of professors of Christianitie, as haue

acknowledged the Popish Church. So that where he
thinketh and saith, al his labour remaineth to proue ye
                     maior, you see that if he could proue it, yet al his labor
is lost. But to follow him in his maior, he deuydeth it
into two partes. The one, that the Church doeth alwayes
continue in a right faith. The other, that this
is a known Church. Both these he promiseth to proue
by Scripture. And the first truely he shall not neede:
but yet it followeth not, but that the church may erre
in some particuler points, not necessary to saluation,
although it continue in a right faith, concerning all
principall and necessarie articles.
               
            
            
               CAP. III.
               Euident proofes &amp; cleare demonstrations out of the Psalms,Stapleton.
that the Church of Christ must continue for euer without interruption,
sounde &amp; vpright.
               He is plentifull in prouing, that which needeth no proofe,Fulke.
that the Church of Christ shall continue alwayes:
and first out of the 88 Psalme, which he rehearseth
and interpreteth of the Church out of Augustine,
lest he should trust his owne iudgement, as he fantasieth,
that our preachers do, altogether refusing to
read interpreters. Wee affirme that the Church of
Christ hath and shall continue to the worldes ende,
but we deny, that the Popish Church is that, which
could not be before there was a Pope, before their heresies
were brought out of the bottomlesse pit, which
were not breathed vp all in 600. yeares after Christ, no
not in 1000 yeares after Christ, and some not almost
in 14. hundreth yeares after Christ, I meane the sacrilegious
taking away of the communion of the blood
of Christ from the people in the councell of Constance.
What impudencie is it of Papistes, to vrge
the perpetuall continuance of Christes Churche,
without interruption, and then to begin at 600. yeres
after Christ: and not to be able to shewe a perpetuall

course of all their doctrine, from Christ his Apostles
and the primitiue Church?
               But to proue that the church of Christ cannot possibly
(as Protestants wickedly do fable,) haue fayled
and perished these many hundreth yeares, he citeth
the 61. Psalme, with Augustines exposition thereupon.
But what Protestant so fableth M. Stapleton? you had
neede to make men of paper, to fight against the paper
walles of your fantasticall fortresse. The Papistes
when they cannot confute that we say, they wil beate
downe that we say not. How saye the Protestantes that
these 900. yeares and vpward, the Church hath perished: it
hath beene ouerwhelmed with Idolatrie and superstition? The
Protestants neuer sayde so M. Stapl. The Church hath
not perished, though the greatest part of the worlde
hath beene ouerwhelmed with idolatrie and superstition.
God can prouide for his chosen, that they shall
not be drowned, when all the worlde beside is ouerwhelmed.
Another testimonie to the like effect, and
with the like conclusion, he bringeth out of ye psal. 104
&amp; thereupon a pithy syllogisme. We proue the Catholike
Church by the continuance of Christianitie. The continuance of
Christianitie only in Papistry is cleare, ergo Papistry is only the
true Church of Christ. Nego tibi minorem M. Stepl. When
will you proue the continuance of Christianitie only
in Papistrie, when Papistrie began since Christ &amp; his
Apostles: and if you meane Christianitie, for the externall
profession of Christes religion: then will you
proue the Orientall Churches to be papistrie, which
defye the authoritie of your Pope?
               Last of all, out of the Psalm. 101. and Augustines
application of the same against the Donatistes, which
sayde that the church was perished out of al the wor
                     •
                  d
except Affrica where they were, he would compare the
Protestants to them, whereas in deede the Papistes are
more like to them. For they holding that there is no
Church of Christ but the Romish church, affirme in
effect as the Donatistes, that the Church of Christ for

many hundreth yeares hath perished out of all partes
of the world beside Europa, where onely &amp; yet not in
all partes thereof they haue borne the sway. Whatsoeuer
therefore Augustine writeth against the Donatistes,
for shutting vp the Church of Christ onely in
Affrica, may be rightly applyed to the Papistes, for restraining
it onely to a part of Europa. But contrary
to the Papistes and Donatistes, we affirme, that the Catholike
church of Christ is and hath beene, euen in the
most darke times of Antichristes kingdome, dispersed
throughout the whole world, nothing doubting, but
God, which preserued 7000. in one corner of Israel, not
much greater then some shyere of England, hath preserued
seuen thousand thousande, in all partes of the
wyde world, which neuer bowed their knees to the
Romish Baal, nor kissed him with their mouth.
            
            
               CAP. IIII.
               Proofes and testimonies one of the Prophet Esay,Stapleton. that the
Church of the Messias continueth for euer vnto the worlds end,
assisted alwayes by God himselfe.
               The testimonies of the perpetuitie of the Church
out of the Prophet Esay,Fulke. with the exposition of Hieronyme
vpon them, maketh nothing against vs, which
willingly acknowledge the same: But denye that
they perteine to the Popish Church, which had her beginning
long after Christe and his Apostles, and her
full tyranny confirmed more than 1000. yeares after
Christe. The same Hierome disputeth against the custome
of the particular Church of Rome, and appealeth
to the Church of all the worlde. 
                     Si auctoritas quaeritur,
orbis maior est vrbe, &amp;c. If authoritie be sought,
the world is greater then a citie. And againe: Quid
mihi profers vnius vrbis consuetudinem? What bringest
thou forth to mee the costome of one citie?  Euagr.
We stand for the Catholike Church of Christ dispersed
ouer all the world, against the particular, schismaticall,

hereticall, and Antichristian church of Rome,
which though shee haue inuaded by tyranny ouer a
great part of Europe, yet neuer did shee preuaile ouer
the whole Church throughout the world, not yet ouer
all Europe.
            
            
               CAP. V.
               The doctrine of Caluine touching the Church,Stapleton. is examined to
the touchstone of the holy Scriptures alledged: Wherein also is
treated and disputed, by what markes the Church may be known.
               First he confesseth that Caluine hath learnedly,
largely, and truely,Fulke. treated of the vnitie, authoritie, and
obedience of the Church. He affirmeth also, that he
acknowledgeth a visible Church in the worlde, whose
communion we ought to keepe, and of her to receiue
the spirituall foode of doctrine and sacraments, which
ought not to be forsaken for the euil life of the members
thereof. All this he commendeth and alloweth.
But herein he sheweth his malicious cauilling stomak,
that he supposeth Caluine to affirme, that the vniuersall
Church of Christ is visible, where he speaketh but
of particular congregations members of the whole,
which are visible, not to the world always, but to the
members of the same.
               The markes of the Church which Caluine sayeth
to be, true preaching of the worde of God, and due
administration of the sacraments, although he confesseth
them to be in the Church, yet he denyeth them
to be the markes of the Church. For the marke
must be better knowne then the thing whereof it is
a marke, but the Church is more euident then those
markes: ergo they be no true markes. The minor he
proueth by that which Caluine teacheth, that wee
must learne of the Church the true meaning of the
Scripture. But hereof it followeth not, that ye Church
is better known then these markes. For there is a farther

tryal which ought to be better known: by which
both are to be knowne: namely the worde of God,
whereunto wee must haue recourse, to trye whether
those things that are preached, are euen so in deede,
as the Thessalonians did, by the preaching of Paul &amp;
Barnabas, Act. 17. ver. 11. The vnmouable trueth is
to be sought in the Scriptures, what preaching or
Church agreeth with that trueth, is to be receiued &amp;
none other. And whereas he sayeth that Heretikes
challenge these markes as well as Catholiks, I grant
they do so, but no more do they challenge these
markes, then they challenge the Church to be on their
side, for there was neuer heresie, but they bragged as
much of the Church as of the trueth. Therefore the
Church is not more cleare then these markes, but
these marks tryed by ye worde of God, are more cleare
then the Church, which is therefore the Church because
it maintaineth true doctrin. The doctrine is not
true because the Church maintaineth it. The cause is
better known then the effect: for knowledge is to vnderstand
by causes.
               But M. Stapl. hath two better markes then Caluine
describeth. To wit: the vniuersalitie and communion
of all nations: The continuance and euerremaining
thereof among Christians. These markes
by no Logyke, can be causes of the Church, but adiuncts
vnto it, and therefore the worst arguments
that can be to knowe it by: euen such as the foolish
mans argument was, that knew his horse by the brydle.
But admitt these to be proper adiuncts of the
Church, yet shall not the popish Church be able to
prooue those to be her markes. For Popery neither
doth, neither euer did possesse all the worlde, except
a peece of Europe be all the world. The Church of
Christ is Catholike, although there were but three
of foure persons in all the worlde that mainteined
true doctrine, as there was not many when Christ &amp;
his Apostles and a fewe other were the onely Church

in all the world, and the Catholike Church, before
they were dispersed into many nations. For ye Church
is called Catholike or vniuersall, not because all
men or most men do pertaine vno it, but because all
that be members of Christ, howe many or howe fewe
so euer they be, and wheresoeuer they be, are members
of that Church But M. Stapl. sayth: The vniuersalitie
of the Church is a matter euident to the eye, &amp; therefore the
Catholike Church is alwayes visible. To this I answer, that
if the Catholike Church, or the vniuersalitie thereof,
were alwayes visible, or at any time visible, or the vniuersalitie
thereof euident to the eye: it should be no
article of faith: for faith is of such things as are not
seen with the eye, but beleued with the heart. Heb. 11.
ver. 1. We agree with Augustine against the Donatists,
that no heresie was in all countreys &amp; in all ages. For
Papistrie which is the greatest heresie &amp; apostasye, was
neuer in all countryes &amp; all ages. But if an heresie
were in all countries and ages, yet proueth it not it self
to be a Catholike trueth. Idolatrie hath beene in all
countries and ages, yet is it not thereby prooued to be
a Catholike trueth. The Church of Christe whereof
we are members, hath bene in al partes of the world,
and in all ages, though not alwayes not euer receiued
of the greatest part of men. And if this be a most cleare
and euident marke (as he saith) that no heretike can pretende
to be ioyned in communion with all Christian countries. The
Popish Church hath not this marke, which is not ioyned
in communion with the Greekes, Armenians,
Chaldeans, Aethiopians, and so many nations as at this
day, and since the Apostles times haue bene Christened
Countries.
               But nowe wee come to the seconde marke of the
Church. The continuance thereof from the beginning
to the ende of the worlde, which is in deede a
proper adiunct of the Church of Christe, not to be
found in any heresie, nor in papistry the greatest of all
heresies. But M. Stapleton, which cannot proue that

Papistrie hath continued alwayes, will argue vppon
that it hath continued a certeine time. The Church
(saith he) hath continued a certeine hundred yeares in that
faith and doctrine onely which Papistes do teache: But in
those very hundreth yeares, the Church neither could lacke,
neither coulde haue a wrong faith, or be seduced with damnable
doctrine. Therefore Papistes had all that time the true
faith, and their faith and doctrine is true, sound, and vpright.
The maior of this argument he affirmeth to be our
confession, which is nothing else but an impudent lye
of his owne confiction. For which of the Protestantes
euer confessed that the Church hath continued
so many hundreth yeares in that faith and doctrin
onely, which the Papistes teache? If he haue the
wit to drawe such confessions from vs, he may proue
what he list against vs. But he promiseth to proue
abundantly the continuance of Popish doctrine from
the beginning, which wee so stoutly denye. In the
meane time he returneth to Caluine, whome he chargeth
to haue learned his opinion and doctrine of the
Donatistes, concerning the markes of the Church.
Taking to witnesse the Ep. 48. of Augustine ad Vincentium,
where the Donatistes answered the argument
of vniuersalitie: that the Church was called
Catholike, Not because it did communicate with the whole
worlde, but because it obserued all Gods commaundementes &amp;
all his sacraments. But what a vaine quarell this is, he
him selfe doth sufficiently declare, when he bringeth
in Augustine immediatly, confessing the Church to
be called Catholike, because it holdeth that veritie
wholly and throughly, whereof euery heresie holdeth
a parte or peece onely, and addeth thereunto the cō
                  munication
with all nations: videlicet, that holde that
veritie wholly and throughly. And lest this might
seeme to be borrowed of the Donatistes onely, Augustine
him selfe affirmeth as much, de Genesi ad literam
imperfect. Cap. 1. Constitutam ab eo matrem ecclesiam,

                        〈◊〉
                      Catholica dicitur, ex eo quia vniuersaliter perfecta est, &amp;

in nullo claudicat, &amp; per totum orbem diffusa est. 
                  That by
him the Church is appointed our mother, which is
called Catholike, for that it is vniuersally perfect, &amp;
halteth in nothing, and is dispersed throughout the
whole worlde. Whereas Augustine requireth vniuersall
perfection in all true doctrine and administration
of the sacramentes with vniuersalitie, the
Papistes take vniuersalitie alone, which Augustine
neuer sayde nor taught, to be a sufficient note of the
Church.
               After this he chargeth Caluine to denye the perpetuall
continuance of the Church, because he sayde,
that the pure preaching of the worde hath vanished
away in certeine ages past, by which he meaneth
not (as this foolish cauiller taketh him, or rather mistaketh
him) that true preaching had vtterly perished
out of the whole worlde, but out of the Popish Synagog,
which in Europe boasted it selfe to be the
onely Church of Christe, when in the chiefe articles
of Christianitie, it derogated from the glorye of
Christ, and was subiect to the doctrine of the man
of sinne, the aduersary and enemy of Christ. And if
malice had not blinded him, he woulde haue so vnderstoode
Caluine, alledging his saying immediatly
after, wherein he confesseth, that the Church of
Christ neuer fayled out of the worlde. Whereupon
he demaundeth whether the Church of the Protestants
is that which hath neuer fayled? If wee saye,
it is, he demaundeth further, where those markes of
preaching and ministring of the sacraments haue
beene these many hundreth yeares? which question
he hopeth some disciple of Caluine will assoile him.
I aunswere those markes were to be seene in such
places, where the Churches were gathered, that had
separated them selues from the Church of Rome.
If he vrge mee further, to shewe him the particuler
places, let him resort to the booke of Actes and monumentes,
which it seemeth he hath read ouer. If

that will not satisfye him, by example of our Sauiour
Christ I will refell his vaine question with another
question: Where did those 7000. that GOD
preserued in the dayes of Elias, assemble for prayers,
preaching, and sacrifice. If he cannot tell, no more
am I bounde to shewe him in what particuler places
they preached and ministred the Sacramentes. And
therefore neither neede the Apologie to recant, nor
the Harborough be reuoked, nor M. Foxe call in his
booke, nor M. Nowell his reproofe. It will not
suffice a wrangling cauiller, an hundreth times to affirme,
that the Church hath alwayes continued, euen
when Papistrie moste preuailed, and euen vnder the
tyrannie and persecution of Papistrie: like as the
Church was among the idolatrous Baalites in the
dayes of Elyas, or among the wicked Iewes that persecuted
the Prophets. But hereto he replyeth, that
though the assemblies of the Iewes were no Churches,
yet their temple, sacrifices, ceremonies, lawe,
and doctrine was good. I aunswere, so much of
these as they reteyned according to Gods lawe, was
good, and so I confesse of the doctrine and sacramentes
of the Papistes. As Baptisme, concerning the
substance of the sacrament: the historicall faith of
the Trinitie: of the incarnation, passion, resurrection
of Christ, &amp;c. But if these and many more pieces
of trueth, might be sufficient to make them the
Church of Christ, many heretikes might challenge
the Church, which haue confessed &amp; practised a great
number of truthes, more then they, which erre but
in one article, as the Arrians, Pelagians, &amp;c. Where
as the Papistes erre in many: yea, in the whole doctrine
of iustification by faith, and the worship of
God. And therefore Papistrie is not onely a schisme,
errour, or heresie: But as Caluine out of Daniel 9.
and Paul, 2. Thessal. 2. rightly concludeth, an apostasie,
defection and antechristianitie, not abolishing,
but reteining the names of Christe, of the Gospell, &amp;

of the Church: but the true vertue, power, and
strength of the same, vtterly forsaking, denying, and
persecuting.
            
            
               CAP. VI.
               Other prophecyes alledged and discussed for the continuance
of Christes Churche,Stapleton. in a sounde and vpright faith.
               Diuerse textes of Scripture are cited,Fulke. some rightly,
some strangely applyed, to proue that wee deny not,
namely the perpetuall continuance of the Church of
Christ, in a sounde and right faith, in all matters necessary
to saluation. Vppon euery one of which, he
inferreth: howe could Christe forsake his Church
these 
                     •
                  00. yeares, as though wee saide that Christe
hath had no Church in the space of nine hundreth
yeares, which we neuer doubted of.
            
            
               CAP. VII.
               Proofes out of the Gospell,Stapleton, for the continuance of Christes
Church, in pure and vnspotted doctrine.
               When M. Stapleton commeth to proue that which
wee denye,Fulke. his proofes will be neither so plentifull,
nor so sufficient. His counterfait painted Fort must
haue puppets made to assaile it. The Church of
Christ concerning the substance of doctrine necessary
to saluation, shall continue pure and vnspotted, although
in other matters, shee may be deceiued, euen
as euery one of Gods elect, for whome our Sauiour
Christ prayeth, Iohn 17. which text M. Stapleton citeth
to proue the continuance of the Church. Wee
will neuer say, that hell gates haue preuailed against
the vniuersall Church of Christ, though they haue
preuailed against the see of Rome. Yet must wee
say, as the Scripture teacheth vs, that Antichrist shal
prevaile in the worlde, 2. Thessal. 2. One Scripture
is neuer contrary to another. Wee are challenged to

reade you out of the Scriptures, the breach, interruption,
and fayling of the Church of Christ so manye
hundreth yeares. As you vnderstand the breach and
fayling, for an vtter abolishing of the Church of
Christ out of the worlde: such breache and fayling,
as wee do not read it, so wee do not affirme it. But
that wee affirme, wee reade that in the latter dayes
some shall depart from the faith, attending to spirites
of errour in hypocrisie, &amp;c. whose markes are
to forbid marryage, and to abstaine from meates
which God hath created, &amp;c. 1. Tim. 4. Wee read,
that before the comming of Christe, shall be an apostasie,
and the man of sinne shalbee openly shewed,
which shall deceiue a great parte of the worlde, 2.
Thess. 2. We reade that the whore of Babylon, which
all auncient writers expound to be Rome, shall with
her sorcerie enchaunt &amp; make dronke all nations, &amp;c.
Apoc. This and much more we reade, to shewe what
your vniuersalitie is, and to take away the obiection
of our paucitie, and not appearing to the greatest part
of the worlde, at such time as it pleased God, for
the vnthankfulnesse of men, to send them the efficacie
of errour, to be deceiued, because they woulde
not receiue the trueth.
            
            
               CAP. VIII.
               To denye the continuance of the Church in a sound &amp; vpright
faith,Stapleton. is to defect the mysterie of Christes incarnation.
               This man hath great leasure, with store of ynke &amp;
paper,Fulke. that filleth so many chapters, which proofe of
that, which none of his aduersaries will denie Who al
with one mouth confesse, and cry out against him so
loud, that if he were not either deafe or dead, he might
heare: that as Christe the head continueth for euer,
so doeth the Church his bodye: but that the Popishe
Church at this time and many hundreth yeares before
this time is the body of Christe, the spouse of Christe,

the flocke of Christes sheepe, which is deuided from
Christ, which is an adulteresse from Christ, which heareth
not the voice of Christ: this we all denie, and this
you shal neuer be able to proue while the world standeth,
babble and scrible as long as you will.
            
            
               CAP. IX.
               That Protestants doe condemne the practise and beliefe of
the first 600. yeares in many thinges,Stapleton. no lesse then of this latter age.
               If Papistes doe allowe the practise and beleefe of
the first 600. yeares in all thinges,Fulke. they may iustly reproue
vs for refusing the same in some things. But if
they refuse the practise and beleefe of that age in many
things, bicause their Church, their iudge, doth now
practise and holde the contrarie: why should they require
vs to be bound to the practise and opinion of
those times in all things, when by Scriptures, the only
rule of trueth, with vs, we finde that they haue erred in
some things. But to leaue his impudent rayling and
lying, that we or any of vs, did euer offer to iustifie
what so euer was done or helde by godly men of the
first 600. yeares: let vs see what practise and beleefe he
chargeth vs to condemne.
               First (saith he) they not onely reproue certaine Fathers
for certaine errours, but in many pointes they
condemne all the Fathers, for common errours: as inuocation
of Saintes, and praier for the dead. And doe
not you Papistes, reproue the practise of al the Fathers,
&amp; Pope Innocent with them, not onely for ministring
the Communion to infants, but also for holding that
they be damned, except they receiue the Communion?
Augustim. Cont. duas ep. Pelag. ad Bonifac. lib. 2. cap. 4. Doe
you not reproue ye practise &amp; opinion of all y• Fathers,
for allowing mariage in the ministers of the Church,
which you vtterly condemne? What shall I say of the

Communion in both kindes, giuen to the lay people,
by consent of all antiquitie, of communicating with
the Priest, and many such like thinges: the practise
and beleefe whereof you vtterly refuse?
               But to returne to the examples of inuocation of
Saintes, which Stapleton saith, are cleare by all writers
of the first 600. yeares, rayling like a saucie marchant
at M. Iewell and M. Grindall, men whose learning
and godlinesse he may enuie, but will neuer attaine
vnto. What a bolde bayard is this, to affirme
that innocation of Saints is cleare by all writers of the
first 600. yeares, when no writer of 300. yeares after
Christ, hath any one iot either of practise or beleefe
to alow it? Epiphanius among the heresies of y• Caianes
counteth inuocation of Angels. Tom. 3. Haer. 3. The
other errour of praying for the dead is more auncient,
but yet it sprang first from the heresie of Montanus,
neither is there any writer auncienter then Tertullian
a Montanist, in whome any steppes of praier
for the dead are to be found. To these he adioyneth a
slaunder of Caluine, whome he affirmeth to teach, that
God is the cause and authour of euill: which how impudent
a lye it is, all they that haue read Caluine of
Predestination can testifie. The reseruation of the Sacrament
of the Lordes supper, Caluine confesseth to
haue bene an erronious practise of the ancient Church.
And what say you Papistes? was it not erronious to reserue
that which Christ commaunded to be eaten and
dronken? But you make no bones of Christes commaundement.
If it were not erronious, why was it
forbidden in diuers Councels?
               If you care not for that, yet thinke not to mocke ye
world with the auncient practise of reseruation, which
you your selues condemne. Will you suffer men and
women to carie home the sacrament and locke it in
their chestes? to hang it about their neckes, to receiue
it in their houses when they list? If you allowe not
these thinges which was the reseruation of auncient

times, you are twice impudent to charge vs for reprouing
that practise, which you your selues doe not admit
to be lawfull. But yet againe, he chargeth Caluine
to condemne the whole primitiue Church of Iewish
superstition, for saying the Fathers folowed rather the
Iewish manner of sacrificing, then the ordinance of
Christ in the Gospell. What a shamelesse beast is this,
to slander Caluine to condemne the whole primitiue
Church? when he speaketh only of the later and more
corrupt times, in which he sheweth their errour, but
condemneth not the Church.
               But nowe he will proue, that Protestantes hold sixe
heresies condemned within the first 500. yeares. The
first is iustification by faith only, condemned in Aerius
and Eunomius, August. Haer. 54. Epiph. Haer. 76. which
is a very shamelesse slaunder, for there is no such iustification
by faith onely condemned in them, as we
holde, which no man of the auncient Fathers more copiously
defendeth, then Augustine him selfe. The second
is also a most impudent lye, that to condemne
free will in man, to worke well, as we meane it, is an
heresie of ye Manichees &amp; Marcionistes: for both which
opinions as we holde them, Augustine him selfe shall
speake, 
                     Ep. 105. Sixto. Restat igitur vt ipsam fidem vnde omnis
iustitia sumit initium, propter quod dicitur ad ecclesiam in
Cantico canticorum: Venies, &amp; pertransies ab initio fidei, non humano,
quo isti extolluntur, tribuamus arbitrio, nec villis praecedentibus
meritis, quoniā inde incipiunt bona quaecun
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         sunt merita,
sed gratitū donum Dei esse fateamur, si gratiam veram,
id est, sine meritis cogitemus. Therefore it remaineth, that
we ascribe not faith it selfe (from whence all righteousnesse
taketh beginning, for which it is said vnto
the Church in the Balat of Balats, Thou shalt come &amp;
passe through from the beginning of faith) vnto mans
free will, whereof they are proude, nor to any merites
going before, for all good merites what so euer they
are, beginne from thence▪ but that we confesse it to be
the freely giuen gift of God, if we thinke o
                        •
                      true grace

which is without merites. Thus writeth Augustine against
the Pelagians, which mainteined free will to do
wel, and were counted heretikes therefore: the contrar
                     •
                  e
whereof Stapleton doth nowe count to be heresie
in vs. The third heresie imputed to Aerius, was the deniall
of praier for the dead, which neither Augustine,
nor Epiphanius that count it for an errour, can by the
word of God conuince to be so. The fourth is Iouiniaans
opinion▪ making marriage equall with virginitie,
which we doe not hold, but that in some respect virginitie
is preferred, as the Apostle teacheth, 1. Cor. 7. But
yt we exhort them to marrie which can not keepe their
vowe of continence, which rashly and presumptuously
they made, we are warranted by Epiphanius Contra Apostolicos,
Haer. 61. Hieronym. Ad Demetriadem. The fift,
that is, the contempt of fasting daies appointed by the
Church, we holde not with Aerius and Eustachius,
but cōtrariwise, that they are to be obserued, although
we make none account of the fasting daies appointed,
and superstitiously kept by the Popish Church. The
sixt, the superstition of Christians vsed at the tombes of
Martyrs, we condemne with Vigilantius and Augustine,
De moribus ecclesiae Catholicae lib. 1. cap. 34. Neither is
Vigilantius condemned of any man in his time, but
by the priuate iudgement of Hieronyme only.
               Nowe in howe many heresies the Papistes communicate
with the olde heretikes, I haue shewed before
in other treatises, which it were needlesse here to repeate.
            
            
               CAP. X.
               Obiections of Protestants to proue the Church may erre,Stapleton. by
the example and similitude of the olde lawe, aunswered and confuted.
               The obiection is onely this out of the Defence of
the trueth fol. 94. as he saith: The Church of the
Iewes lacked not Gods promises,Fulke succession of Bishops

and priestes, opinion of holynesse and austeritie of
life, knowledge of the lawe of God: And yet they erred,
why may we not thinke the like may be in this
our time. Both maior &amp; minor of this argument he saith
is false: for first they had not such promises as the
Church of Christ hath, of perpetuall continuance in
the trueth, bicause they were not appointed to continue
alwayes, wherein he bewraieth his grosse &amp; beastly
ignorance, that can not discerne betweene the nation
of the Iewes, and the Church of God among the
Iewes, which hath euen the same promises of euerlasting
continuance, that the Church of the Gentiles hath,
which is not an other Church from the Church of the
Iewes, but an accession and an addition vnto it. Howe
many promises of eternall continuance, be made in
the Prophetes to Israel, to Zion, to Ierusalem? Reade
Esa. ca. 60. 62. &amp; 63. among a number. The accōplishment
whereof, although it be seene in the Church gathered
of the Gentiles, yet who would be so impudent
to denie, that they pertaine principally to the Church
of Israel, as to the elder brother? But what striue we
further? when the Apostle to the Romanes, cap. 9. vers.
3. expresly affirmeth, that the promises pertaine to Israel,
euen as the adoption, the glorie, the couenants,
the giuing of the lawe, &amp;c. yet M. Stapleton thinketh
him selfe a sharpe disputer, when he obiecteth out of
the Epistle to the Hebrues, Heb. 8. that the testament
of Messias is established in more excellent promises,
bicause of ye new couenant out of Ieremie 31. as though
both the testaments did not pertaine to the Catholike
Church of Christ, as wel that of the Iewes, as this of ye
Gentiles. The newe Testament &amp; promises are better,
then that was made in Sinai, but the new testament of
Messias, pertaineth as much to the Church of ye Iewes,
as to the Church of ye Gentiles. Or els the Apostle had
laboured in vaine, writing to the Iewes, to drawe thē
from the ceremonies of the olde testament, to the couenant
of Messias, established onely in mercie and forgiuenesse

of their sinnes. Christ was the Lambe slaine
from the beginning of the world, whose redemption
pertained as much vnto the fathers that liued before
his incarnation, as vnto them that are borne sincer therfore
the promise of the eternitie of the Church, beginneth
not at the natiuitie of Christ, but at the beginning
of the world. So that for continuance and perpetuity
of Gods spirite with his Churche, without the
which it can not be the Church of God, the promises
from the beginning, haue bene the same that are now,
although according to Gods moste wise dispensation,
they haue bene more clearely reuealed in the latter
times, &amp; most clearely of all by Christ himselfe and
his Apostles.
               Now remaineth the minor to be proued. That the
Church of the Iewes hath erred. Which he denieth,
because the high priestes answered truely of the natiuitie
of Christ, &amp; because Caiphas prophecied vnwittingly
of the vertue of Christes death, then the which
nothing can be more blockish. They erred not in one
article, ergo they erred not at all. One of them spake
the trueth against his will in one point, ergo the synagogue
of the Iewes neuer erred. Againe he saith, the
whole synagogue, before the law of Christ took place,
in necessary knowledge of the lawe of Moyses did neuer
erre. For proofe whereof, more like a blocke then
a man, he bringeth such places of Scripture, as either
shew what the Priestes duty should be, but not affirme
what their knowledge was, or else prophesie a reformation
of the corrupt state of the Cleargie, from ignorance
to knowledge. As Ez. 44. The Priestes &amp; Leuites
shall teach my people. And Mal. 2. The lippes
of the Priest should kepe knowledge, and men should
require the law of his mouth. Agg. 2. Aske the priest
the Lawe. But what dronken Flemming of Douaie,
would reason thus? The Scribes and the Pharisees sate
in Moses chaire, therefore the Synagogue did either
neuer or not then erre. Our Sauiour Christ willed thē
                  
to be heard, while they spake out of Moses chaire, not
while they taught to worship God in vaine, preferring
their traditions before the commandement of God.
But who would spend any more time in reasoning against
such a one, as defendeth that the Scribes and the
Pharises did not erre, whose false doctrine cōcerning
adulterie, murther, swearing, the worship of God, not
onely the person, but also the qualitie of Messias and
his kingdome, our sauiour Christ him selfe so often &amp;
so sharply doth reproue. But the whole synagogue
(saith he) in necessary knowledge of the lawe of Moses
did neuer erre. If he vnderstand the whole synagogue
for euerie man, we confesse the same, and so we
say that the whole Church, that is all the elect, neither
in the first sixe hundreth, nor in the latter nine hundreth
yeares, did neuer erre in necessary knowledge
of the Gospel. But if you take the whole synagogue,
for the whole multitude that had the ordinary authority,
and did beare the outward face and countenance
of the Church, they haue erred before the comming
of Christ▪ Example in the whole synagogue, in the
dayes of Iosias, when the very booke of the lawe was
vnknowen vnto the Priestes, vntill it was found by occasion
of taking out of mony out of the temple, by
Hilchiah the priest. So that from the beginning of the
reigne of Manasse, vntill the 18. yeare of the reigne of
Iosias, which was almost 80. yeares, Idolatry openly,
preuailed in the temple of God, the whole synagogue,
that is, all in authority and countenance, embracing
the same, except a fewe poore Prophetes, that were
slaine for crying out against it. 2. King. 22. &amp; 2. Chro.
34. And such was the state of the Church in the most
corrupt times, continuing as then, but yet in persecution,
aduersity, and beeing vnknowen vnto the worlde,
except now and then God stirred vp some witnesse to
testifie his truth, which was slaine of the beast Apoc. 11.
Now concerning the childish sophisme, that although
it was not possible that the Church could erre, yet

it is not proued, that it hath erred, what shold I speake?
When the defender directly oppugneth that paradoxe
which the Papistes holde: namely, that the Churche
cannot erre. To conclude, while he walketh vnder a
cloude of the Church sanctified, and assisted by the holy
Ghost, defended by the presence of Christ, &amp;c. He
playeth bo peepe vnder a coverlet. For what so euer
promises are made to the faithfull spouse of Christe,
pertaine nothing at al to the Popish Church of Antichrist,
which is departed from the faith, carrying the
brandmarks of hypocrisie, in prohibition of marriage
and meates, so euident, that all the water in the sea can
not wash them out.
            
            
               CAP. XI.
               Obiections out of the News Testament moued and assoyled.Stapleton.
               
               The first obiection is the abhomination of desolation
standing in the holy place, that is the Church,
Matth. 24. He asketh where the defender hath learned
to expound this holy place of the Church? Forsooth
where M. Stapleton learned, that it may be vnderstood
of the temple at Ierusalem, where Pilate placed Caesars
image, or of the Image of Adriane. Namely, in Hierome,
vpon this text Matth. 24. which vnderstandeth
the abhomination of desolation to be Antichrist, of
whom Saint Paule speaketh, whom he denieth not, but
that he shal sit in the Church: his wordes are these.
De hoc &amp; Apostolus loquitur, quòd homo iniquitatis &amp; aduersarius
eleuandus sit contra omne quod dicitur Deus &amp; colitur:
ita ut audeat stare in templo Dei, &amp; ostendere quòd ipse sit Deus:
cuius aduentus secundum operationem satanae destruat eos,
&amp; ad Dei solitudinem redigat, qui se susceperint, Potest autem
simpliciter aut de Anti christo accipi, aut de imagine Caesaris,
&amp;c. Of this abhomination of desolation the Apostle
also speaketh, that the man of sinne, and the aduersary
shalbe lifted vp against all that is called God,

or worshipped: so that he dare stand in the temple of
God, and shewe himselfe as God: whose comming, according
to the working of Satan, may destroy them &amp;
bring them to solitarines frō God, which shal receiue
him: and it may either be taken simply of Antichriste,
or of the image of Caesar, &amp;c.
               
               Let him now reason with Hieronyme, howe the sacrifice
should ceasse after the ende of 62. weekes?
Although for my part, I thinke, the pollution of the
temple, whiche was a token of the desolation imminent,
was a figure of the corruption of the Church by
AntiChriste.
               The 2. obiection. S. Paul witnesseth that Antichrist
should sit in the temple of God, that is in the Church.
What of this? (saith he) will it followe that he hath
sitten there these 900. yeares? As though the defender
were to proue how long Antichrist should sit, and not
rather that the visible and outwarde multitude of the
Church should erre.
               Like madnes, shal I say, or impudence, he sheweth,
where he saith, the protestantes commonly name S.
Gregorie to be that Antichrist. Which I am sure he
neuer read nor heard any protestant affirme. But the
Pope cānot be Antichrist (saith he) because Antichrist
should then labour to extirpe the faith of Christe,
for the Pope hath called people from infidelitie
to Christianitie. That letteth not, but that he is Antichrist:
for the Pope calleth none but vnto the name of
Christianitie, vnder colour of which, he exerciseth tyranny,
otherwise he laboureth to extirpe the faith of
Christ, and to preferre himself before Christ, whose redemption,
he teacheth to take away onely the guilt of
sinne, whereas his pardon taketh away, both the paine
and the guilt of sinne.
               The thirde obiection is out of S. Peter, that in the
Church should be many masters and teachers of lyes:
But these (sayth he) shall not tarie 900. yeares, for
their destruction sleepeth not. A wise shift, as though

the Apostle gaue not a generall admonition, for the
Church in all ages, euen in that wherein he liued himselfe.
               The last is out of 1. Tim. 4. that in the latter dayes
such should come, which shall giue eare to the doctrine
of deuils, forbidding to marrie and eate suche
meates as God hath created to be receiued with
thanksgiuing. In this matter he professeth to be short,
as he hath no lust to tarrie being in that, wherein his
cauterized conscience is so galled. But he aunswereth
briefly, it was fulfilled in the Manichees, what then?
doth it followe that it is not fulfilled in the Papistes?
Doth the spirite speak euidently of the Manichees, an
obscure heresie, and not rather of the Apostasie of Antichrist,
whose hypocrisie should be cloaked by fained
chastity and fasting? No no, Master Stapleton, your
conscience although marked with a whot iron, yet
can not but inwardly confesse, that this prophesie perteyneth
especially to Papistrie, the greatest heresie
that euer was.
            
            
               CAP. XII.
               Other common obiections of protestantes, taken out of the
law,Stapleton. discussed and assoyled.
               The obiections are these: where was the outwarde
face of the Church in the time of Noe,Fulke. in the time of
the departing of the tenne tribes, in the dayes of Elias?
He aunswereth out of Augustine De vnitate ecclesiae against
the Donatistes, cap. 12. which made the same obiections,
that as these examples of fewnesse of the
Church are read in the Scriptures, so the Church to be
dispersed ouer all the world, is read in the same Scriptures,
and therfore it can not be restrained to the communion
of Donatus in Affirica.
               The like say we, (how of euer it pleaseth his malice
to slaunder vs) that the Church is and was these 1500.

yeares dispersed ouer the whole worlde, and therefore
can not be restrained to the faction or communion of
the Pope in a parte of Europe.
               Concerning the apostasie of the 10. tribes, he answereth,
that the Cleargie, vide licet the Priests and Leuites,
remained in sound religion, and many of the
people, so God hath his Church alwayes, which we denie
not. Yet in the dayes of Manasse, where can he
shewe me any Cleargie of the Iewes that continued
in sound religion? And yet I doubt not, but there
were some particular persons, for GOD had his
Churche among them euen then. But the outward
face of the Church, was all turned into idolatrie and
false worshipping of God. Where he saith; except the
Church had remained in Europe these 900. yeares, protestantes
should not haue had from whence to departe.
I answere, protestantes are not departed out of the
Church of Christ, but out of Babylon. And yet I acknowledge,
that there were members of Christes
Church dispersed, yea and Churches gathered also in
the time of deepest ignorance, in moste regions of
Europe, though not regarded, or condemned for heretikes,
in Calabria, in France, in England, in Bohemia.
Finally whereas he would seeme to repaire
the Popes losse in Europe, with the recouery of large
countries in the East, wise men may easily see, and
fooles also may laugh at it, howe vaine a bragge it is,
to boast of matters so farre of as none can beare witnesse
of, but himselfe, and such as he is.
            
            
               CAP. XIII.
               That the true Church of Christ,Stapleton. which continueth for euer,
is a visible and known Church, no priuie or secrete congregation.
               
                  
His name is Thomas forsooth, and therefore he
saith,Fulke. he will neuer beleeue, that there was any other
Church, but the Church of Rome, except he may so
see it, that he may point to it with his finger. But
gentle Thomas, our Sauiour Christ saith, blessed are
they that beleeue &amp; see not. If the catholike Church of
Christ might be seene at any time, it should be no article
of our faith, which is an euidence of thinges that
are not seene, Heb. 11. The members thereof, as seuerall
congregations, are seene, sometimes of many of
all sortes of men, sometimes of them onely, that are
true members of them, but Ierusalem which is aboue,
and is the mother of all the faithful, is not seene, but
with the eyes of faith. Therefore Thomas, if you wil
neuer beleeue the Catholike Church, except you see
it with your bodily eyes, you can neuer be any member
thereof.
               You alledge out of Esay 2. The hill of the house
of the Lord shal be prepared in the toppe of all hilles,
&amp;c. This is fulfilled in the calling of the Gentiles,
which haue not ceased to walke in the light of our
God▪ since they were first called, though not alwayes
in like numbers, not always in fauour with the powers
of the worlde, nor alwayes in sight of the blinde
worldlinges. And Christ is the light of the Gentiles,Es. 49.
vnto the vttermost partes of the earth, therefore not
vnto one part of Europe only, as you Popish Donatistes
do affirme. And the Apostles were the light of
the worlde to carrie the light of saluation vnto the
furthermost partes of the earth.Matth. 5. Es. 61. And their seede shalbe
knowen among the Gentiles, and their buddes among
the people. All that see them shall know them,
that they are the seede which the Lord hath blessed.
The Church of the Gentiles, confesseth the seede of
Abraham, which sometimes was obscure and knowen
to fewe, to be the blessed seede, and reioyceth that by
faith she is engraffed into the stocke of Abraham, to
be partaker of the same blessing.
               
                  
All this prooueth no light, sight, or knowledge
of a Church to be pointed at with vnfaithfull Thomas
his finger, but heauenly, spiritual, and to be discerned
by faith.
               
                  Againe when Esay sayeth: God hath prepared his
arme in the eyes of all nations, and all the endes of
the earth shal see the saluation of our God,
                  Es. 52. 
                  he meaneth
to the electe and chosen of all nations, to the
predestinate people. Not onely so sir Protestant: Why
so syr Papist? The Prophet sayeth further, Quibus non
est narratum, viderunt, &amp; qui non audiuerunt contemplati
sunt. Such as the Messias hath not beene preached vnto, yet
they haue seene. And such as haue not heard, haue yet beholden.
               
                  Ergo not the Electe onely: What then syr Papiste,
tagge and ragge, all the reprobate of al times:
is this your interpretation? But Thomas? I pray
you giue vs leaue to beleeue the interpretation of S.
Paule before you, who expoundeth it cleane contrary
to you. Romanes 15. ver. 20. Yea I enforced
my selfe to preach the Gospel, not where Christe was
named, least I should haue built on an other mans
foundation. But as it is written:Es. 52. To whome he was
not spoken of, they shal see, and they that hearde not
shall vnderstande. Loe Thomas, Saint Paule expoundeth
this text of them which had seene Christe
and knowen the Gospel, first, by his preaching, and
not of such as the Messias hath not bene preached to.
Therefore be no more vnfaithfull, but beleeue the
Catholike Church, though it can not be seene. Yet
will he not leaue the matter so, for Esay prophecyeth.
               That the Lorde would be a perpetuall light and
glory of his Church: That the sunne of the Churche
shal not goe downe any more, nor the moone vade,
because the Lord shal be her euerlasting light. Nations
shal walk in their light, and kings in the brightnesse

of her arising.
               Verily Thomas, though our bodily eyes can not
see this, yet doe wee moste constantly beleeue, that
it is fulfilled in the Churche as it was promised.
               But that the externall brightnesse of the Church is☜
not promised to bee in all ages alike, wee may
clearely see by this, that he saith: Kinges shal walke
in the brightnesse of thy rising vppe. For euerye
age of the Churche hath not had kinges to walke
in the brightnesse of her light.
               Let Thomas which will not beleeue the continuance
of our Churche, except it be so shewed that
hee may point at it with his finger: Let him I say
point out with his finger, what Kinges in euery age
for the space of the first three hundreth yeares, did
walke in the brightnesse of the Churches arising.
It will not serue him to name Algarus of Edessa,
or Lucius of Britaine. But he must shewe a continuall
succession of Kinges for all that time, or
if he can not, let him confesse, that the externall
glorie and brightnesse of the Church, is not in all
ages to be seene, as the spirituall magnificence and
light thereof is euerlasting.
               His nexte reason is, of the continuance of Pastours
and teachers in the Churche, which he imagineth
to haue fayled in our Church, for nine hundreth
yeares, but he is altogether deceiued. For
when the state of the Romishe Churche was growen
to be such a confuse Babylon, that it was necessary
for GODS people to goe out of it. Apoc.
Chap. 18. verse 4. Which came not to the full ripenesse
of iniquitie, vntill a thousande yeares after
Christe, GOD sent Pastours and teachers to his
Churche so departed out of Babylon, in these partes of
Europe, which continued by succession, euen vntill
GOD restored his Gospell into open light of the
worlde againe.
               
                  
Beside that a great number of Easterne Churches,
haue continued euen from the Apostles time vnto this
day, though not in soundnesse of all opinions, yet
in open profession of Christianitie, among whome
doubtlesse, some reteyned the foundation alwayes,
which were neuer obedient to the see of Rome, neither
partakers of a greate nomber of her horrible heresies,
so that if it were graunted, that the Churche
must alwayes be visible, yet the Papistes are neuer
the neare, to proue their faction to be the Church,
because the Greeke Church, for outward shewe of a
Churche, hath bene alwayes as notorious in the East,
as the Latine Church in the West.
               Finally, where Augustine sayeth (although vpon
a text wrongly interpreted) that the Churche is placed
in the sunne, that is, a manifest place of the worlde,
not in a corner, like the conuenticles of heretikes. He
meaneth not, that the Church is alwayes seene of all
men, but that it seeketh no corners or couerture of
darkenesse, as heretikes doe, to shrowd their falshoode
in: although in the time of persecution it be driuen
into streightes, and is content to be hidden from
the aduersaries thereof, except in some cases, where
the glorie of CHRISTE requireth an open confession.
               The same Augustine, would haue the Churche
to be known onely by the Scriptures De vnitate Ecclesiae.
Cap. 16. 
                  
                     Sed utrum ipst Ecclesiam teneant, non nisi
divinarum scripturarrum Canonicis libris ostendunt. But
whether they holde the Church, let them shewe by
none otherwayes, but by the Canonicall bookes
of the holy Scriptures. If the Papistes were able to
proue their doctrine by the scriptures, they would not
labour so muche for the title of the Church, which of
necessitie would followe them if they taught nothing
but that, and all that, which the holy Scriptures doe
teache.
            
            
               
               CAP. XIIII.
               Three reasons why the Church of Christ ought of necessitie
alwayes to be a cleare,Stapleton. euident, visible, and knowen Church. In
the seconde of which reasons a sensible disputation is made to
trie whether our countrie among other might possiblie haue attayned
to the right Faith without the helpe of a knowne Church,
in all this pretensed time of Papistrie.
               The first reason is, that except the Church and true
pastors thereof might be openly knowne,Fulke. the infidell
seeking for Christianitie shall come from paganisme
to heresie &amp;c. the grace and gift of Christ shoulde bee
vnprofitable as a riche treasure fast locked vp &amp;c.
which were inconuenient in many respects &amp;c. therefore
the Church must be openly knowne and euident
&amp;c. I aunswere: this reason sauoreth of Pelagianisme,
which is enimie to the grace of God, presupposing
that Infidels of their owne good motion, without the
grace of God, may seeke Christianitie. But if wee remember
what our Sauiour Christ saith: No man commeth
vnto me, except my father drawe him: Ioan. 6.
ver. 44. Wee must acknowledge, that as it is the onely
grace of God, that moueth in infidels a desire to seeke
Christ, so the same grace, and no outward appearance,
to be iudged by carnall reason, shall directe them,
whom he hath chosen to eternall life, among so many
sectes in the worlde, to finde, see, and acknowledge the
onely true Church, and piller of trueth, out of which
there is no saluation. Wherefore this reason hath no
grounde, but vppon a supposition of Pelagianisme,
that GOD hath onely reuealed his trueth vnto men
of the worlde, and lefte men to their owne reason to
find it out by external notes, such as Infidels not lightened
by Gods grace, by the light of naturall reason
may descerne.
               The seconde reason is, that it hath pleased God, that because
                  
The seconde reason is, that it hath pleased God, that because
faith leaneth vpon authoritie, and authoritie is strong
in a multitude, although in the primitiue Church by miracles &amp;
euident giftes of the holy ghost, the authoritie of a fewe drewe
whole countryes to the faith, yet miracles ceasing, to keepe the
Church alwayes in a knowen multitude, whose authoritie might
drawe the simple, persuade the learned, and keepe out the heretikes.
If this carnal reason were good, there were smal
or no vse of the scriptures at all. The authoritie of the
Church, and that alwayes knowne, might suffice for
all matters. But Augustine (saith hee) in his booke
de vxilitate credendi, ad Honoratum. Cap. 14. vseth this reason
to bring Honoratus from the Manichees to the
Catholikes, out of whome he citeth a long discourse
to this effect: That as the common multitude and
fame moueth a man to beleeue, that there was such a
one as Christ, and that his writings and scriptures are
to be credited, so of the head rulers of that multitude,
and not of any priuie and newe sect, such as the Manichees
was, he must learne the vnderstanding of this
booke and scriptures. This he taketh vppon him to
exemplifie, by the state of our countrey, at the firste
conuersion thereof by Augustine. Although this
carnal reason might haue some shew with Honoratꝰ,
a straunger from the Church, and one not lightened
with the spirite of God: yet howe vaine it is, being
applyed to the Papistes, you may easily see by this,
that since the Church of Rome hath been the Church
of Antichrist, as great a multitude, which might and
hath moued many infidels to receuie the profession
of Christianitie, hath beene seperated from it, as hath
cleaued to it. Put the case then of an infidell in the
East, which moued by the fame and consent of many
nations, hath thought well of Christ, hath giuen credite
to the Scriptures: to what head rulers shoulde
be resort for instruction in the Scriptures? to the rulers
of that multitude, by which he was first moued
to beleeue? then shoulde he neuer become a Papist:

For all the Patriarches of the East Church haue been
and are stil at vtter defyance with the Pope of Rome.
You see therefore by plaine demonstration, that this
reason holdeth no further then Augustines authoritie
extendeth: who in other places appealeth onely to
the Scriptures, and euen against the Manichees confesseth,
that the playne demonstration of the trueth
(which is to be founde in the holye Scriptures) is to
be preferred before the consent of nations, authoritie
of miracles, succession of Bishops, vniuersalitie, consent,
name of the Catholike Church, and whatsoeuer
can be taught beside, Contra Epist. Manich. quam vocant
fundamenti Cap. 4.
               The thirde reason, why the Church must alwayes
be a known multitude, is for keeping out of wolues
and heretikes, which must be, yt they which are tryed,
may be made manifest, which cannot bee in a secrete
congregation. Yes M. Stapleton, very well. The
Church was neuer so secrete, but it was knowne to
the members of it, which might vse the authoritie
thereof, for trying, auoyding, and excommunicating
of heretikes, according to the holye scriptures. But
euermore you do wilfully deceiue your selfe, when
you affirme that there was no Christians knowen in
the worlde by the space of 900. yeares but Papistes.
You cannot denye, but Brytannie, Scotlande, &amp; Irelande
had Christians at and since the comming of
Augustine, which were no Papistes, as by the history
of Beda is manifest. What should I here name so
many nations of Europe, Asia, and Africa? which yet
to this day continue in profession of Christianitie, &amp;
neuer were subiect to the tyrannye of the Romishe
byshop, and from whome the Romish byshop, with
his sect of Papistes, hath clearely departed many hundreth
yeares agoe. Wherefore, according to Augustines
sentence: the Catholike church is not a particuler
sect in Europe, but an vniuersall gathering of ye
dispersed ouer all the world,Cont. Faust. li. 13. Ca. 13. where God hath his elect

in all places. Or if you vnderstande the Church for a
visible multitude professing Christ, there is no reason
why the churches of the East, so many, so large, so ancient,
should be excluded, and the multitude of Papists
holding of one citie in Italy only, to be receiued.
            
            
               CAP. XV.
               A number of shamelesse shiftes and seely surmises,Stapleton. which Protestants haue inuented to establish their variable doctrine, and to confounde the authoritie of the Church.
               In deede a number of these which he rehearseth as
shamelesse shiftes, are shamelesse lies and impudent
slaunders, deuised by the diuell, to bring the trueth
in disdaine: but yet so openly proued to be false,Fulke. that
they neede no confutation. First he sayeth, that Luther
condemned all councels and fathers, yea, al learning
of Philosophy and humanitie, so that bookes
were burned, and common schooles ceased for certein
yeares in Germany, with other like monstrous lyes,
alledging for his author that beastly Apostata Staphylus.
This slaunder deserueth no aunswere, being
raysed by one shamelesse lyer against an hundreth
thousand witnesses.
               The seconde shift is, that Luther did afterwarde
receiue Philosophy, and bookes of humanitie, yea &amp;
diuines of▪ 500. or 600. yeares, and some Councels
also, with this perilous condition, so farre as they repugned
not to holy Scripture. This seemeth an vnreasonable
condition to Stapleton, who belike would
haue all gentylitie, and many heresies absolutely
receyed.
               The thirde: The fathers should not be admitted,
when they taught any thing beside the expresse scripture.
As worshipping of Images, praying to Saints,
&amp;c. which they had by tradition. If such things came
from the Apostles, why were they not written by

them, as well as such fathers of later time? yea, why
did the Apostles write that which is contrary to such
traditions?
               The fourth: The first 600. yeares they did admit, because
they knewe there was litle in them against them cleare &amp; open, because fewe bookes were writen in that time, and many
lost that were written. And yet there remaine more writen
in that time then a man can well reade ouer in
seuen yeares. Agayne cities being stuffed with heathen,
Iewes, and heretikes, euery mystery was not opened in pulpit,
nor committed to writing. These belike were greater mysteries
then the Apostles and Euangelistes haue committed
to writing. But I marueile howe they were
taught, if neither in pulpit nor in writing, belike in
secrete confession, but our Sauiour Christe woulde
haue his mysteries preached in the house toppes. Last
of all, for that many controuersies nowe in hand were neuer
heard of in those dayes. Therefore M. Iewell made his
challenge of the first 600. yeres, which Stapleton thinketh
he was not able to abyde by, and that M. Nowel
suspected no lesse, because he accounted it a very large
scope. But howe he hath abyden by it, is sufficiently
proued to the glory of the trueth, and the confusion
of Papistrie.
               The fifth: They reiect the latter 900. yeares, because
Paynims yelding to the faith, and heretikes to the Church, the
mysteries of our faith were more openly published in Pulpits
&amp; writings. It appeareth, and that in recordes of the
latter 900. yeares, that many old heretiks still remained
in the cities, beside the Iewes remaining vntil this
day, of which he made the fathers of the first 600
years so much afraide, for vttering the mysteries, a
                     •
                  
of Paynims and heretikes.
               The sixt: Some holde, that all the Church might erre for
a time. None euer helde that all the Church might
erre so farre, as that they fell away from Christ.
               The seuenth: Other said, there was a Church all this
900 yeares, but oppressed by the miscreants, being priuie and vnknowen.

This he sayth is vaine &amp; blasphemous, being against
holy Scripture and good reason, as he hath proued. What he
hath proued, you haue seene, and howe the Scripture
must be fulfilled, which prophecyeth of the comming
of Antichrist, and the apostasie of men from the faith:
which cannot be, if the Church should alwayes florish
in multitude &amp; externall appearing of visible glory.
               The eyght: That Protestants bookes haue beene lost.
               
               The ninth: Bookes of holy fathers haue beene corrupted.
               
               The tenth: False writings haue beene deuised and fathered
vpon the first Popes of Rome. All these he compteth
to be but suspitions &amp; surmises, which are yet so manifest
truthes, that euen Thomas the vnbeleeuing Apostle
without the iudgement of his senses, might
feale them with both his hands, and be satisfyed, although
Thomas the Apostata from God, and traytour
to his Prince &amp; countrey will neither see nor handle
them. But all these surmises he will ouerthrow with
supposing one case. If a man haue continued in possession,
and coulde bring recordes of his right from
William the Conquerour, and all his neighbours to
say for his quiet possession, without checke or nay, as
the Papistes can deduct the possession of their religiō
from 800. yeares, &amp;c. were it a good plee against such
a man to say: his recordes are false, his euidences forged,
his possession iniurious, &amp;c. without bringing
in any affirmatiue proofes, recordes, euidence, or witnesse,
&amp;c. I answere, it were no good plee. But firste I
denye, that you Papistes can bring such recordes, witnesse,
and possession of 900. yeares. And secondly, I
affirme that wee can bring good recordes, euidences,
and witnesse to the contrary. Wherefore this case
helpeth you nothing at all, as it is false that the religion
nowe called Papistry hath beene professed these
900. yeares, which I haue proued by more then 40.
differences, gathered out of the historie of Bede, and
other monuments of antiquitie.
            
            
               
               CAP. XVI.
               A note of countries and prouinces brought to the faith of
Christ from Paganisme,Stapleton. within the compasse of those latter
900 yeares.
               He beginneth with the conuersion of the English
Saxons and Britanie,Fulke. and so proceedeth to the conuersion
of diuers small nations in Germanie, and other
partes: last of all, he commeth to the conuersion of
many thousands in the Isle of Goa, testified by letters
of the Iesuites, al which he maketh to be conuerted into
one faith and religion of Papistrie. But that is false,
for I haue proued by many differences, that although
the first beginning of these 900. yeares was corrupt
in many thinges, yet was it not so corrupt as Papistrie,
nor agreeing with Papistes in many of their chiefe heresies
for 300. or 400. yeares after. Now touching such
as haue bene conuerted to plaine Poperie since yt time,
or by ye Iesuites in this time, if their monstrous reports
be credible, it proueth not yt they are of an Apostolike
spirit. The Scribes and Pharisees were zealous to make
Proselites to Iudaisme. The great and mightie nations
of the Gothes, Vandales, Hunnes, &amp;c. that ouerranne
the greatest part of the Romaine Empire, were conuerted
from Gentilitie by the Arrians, whose heresie
along time they helde, as all histories doe record. The
Nestorians conuerted great nations that yet continued
in their heresie. Photius the heretike conuerted the
Bulgarians. Finally, the Greeke Church hath conuerted
as many nations vnto their profession of Christianitie,
as the Romaines haue done to their Papistrie:
wherefore this argument of conuersion of nations
doeth no more proue Papistrie to be true Christianitie,
then it doth iustifie Iudaisme, Arrianisme, Nestorianisme,
Grecisme, which the Papistes count to be an heresie
as well as the other.
            
            
               
               CAP. XVII.
               Whether at any time the religion of Protestants haue conuerted
any infidels to the faith.Stapleton.
               
               The religion which we holde, whome he calleth
Protestantes,Fulke being the same which was deliuered by
Christ him selfe and his Apostles, hath conuerted all
nations of the world that euer were cōuerted, from infidelitie
to ye true faith and religion of Christ. Wherefore
it is a folish fantasie, that he requireth vs to shew
one countrie, citie, or man, conuerted within these
900. yeres. If Protestants could brag as well as the Iesuites,
they might boast of many thousands conuerted
by them in the new found lands of Gallia Antarctica,
and India, beside many Iewes that are knowne to be
turned to the Christian faith in this part of the world.
If in the time of persecution, when they had much ado
to saue their owne faith from deceiuing, and their liues
from crueltie, they had no leasure to trauell into Heathen
countries, to seeke the conuersion of infidels, no
wise man will maruell. The slaunderous reportes of
Villegagnon and the Iesuites are of as good credite, as
their persons are of honestie and soundnes of religion.
            
            
               CAP. XVIII.
               The argument of continuance of the knowne Church,Stapleton. is fortified
out of the most auncient and learned Fathers.
               The auncient and learned Fathers, neuer allowed any
continuance of the Catholike Church and faith, but
such as had their beginning at Christ &amp; his Apostles,
and not such as beganne fiue or sixe hundreth yeares
after Christ,Fulke. as all the testimonies which he cyteth, do
plainely proue vnto vs. First Augustine, Ep. 166. reproueth
the Donatistes. For that they would not acknowledge

the Church which Christ him selfe had planted,
and which had continued euen vntill that time. But it
pleaseth this man greatly, which Augustine writeth.
Cont. Ep. Parm. lib. 3. cap. 5. That there is no securitie of vnitie,
except the Church be declared out of the promises
of God, which as it is saide, being set vpon an hill
can not be hid, and therefore it is necessarie that it be
knowne to all parts of the earth. The knowne Church.
that Augustine speaketh of, is not the peculiar Church
of Rome, but the vniuersall Church of Christ dispersed
ouer all the world: which is in such sort knowne &amp;
seene, as the mountaine whereon it is builded, is knowen
and seene. But that mountaine is Christ, spoken of
in Daniel, which is not knowne or seene but by faith,
no more is the vniuersall Church of Christ knowne or
seene but by faith. And thus he writeth against the
Donatistes, which challenged the societie of the iust to
be only in Africa, whereon as also that the mountaine
in ye which ye Church is set, is Christ, August. writeth in
ye same chapter. 
                     Qui ergo nō vult sedere in concilio vanitatis,
non euanescat typho superbiae, quaerens conuenticula, iustorum totius
orbis vnitate separata, quae non potest inuenire. Iusti autem
sunt per vniuersam ciuitatem, quae abscondi non potest, quia supra
montem constituta est. Montem illum dico Dani
                           •
                        lis, in qu
                           •
                        
lapis ille praecisus sine manibus, creuit &amp; impleuit vniuersam
terram. Per totam igitur istam ciuitatem toto orbe diffusam, iusti
gemunt &amp; moerent, ob iniquitates quae sunt in medio eorum.
He therefore that will not sit in the councel of vanitie,
let him not vanish away in swelling of pride, seeking
the conuenticles of the iust, separated from the vnitie
of all the world, which he can not finde. Now the
iust are throughout the whole citie, which can not be
hid, bicause it is set vpon an hill. I meane, that hill of
Daniell, in which that stone being cut off without
handes increased, and filled the whole earth. Therfore
in al this citie dispersed ouer all the world, the iust doe
grone and mourne, for the iniquities which are in the
middest of them.
               
               
                  
Thus Augustine being rightly vnderstoode, maketh
altogether against the schismaticall Church of Rome,
which is not set vpon that mountaine which is inuisible
to the eye of the flesh, but seeketh the vtter ruine
of that citie which being builded on Christ, is known
in all partes of the world by faith.
               But Hieronyme saith much for the matter, Contra
Luciferianos. 
                  I could drie vp all the streames of thy propositions,
with the fame of the Church. And who douteth,
but where the Church is acknowledgeth to be, the
cleare doctrine thereof may stoppe the mouth of any
heretike which acknowledgeth it for the Church? The
same Hieronyme Ad Dam. mach. &amp; Oceanum de error▪
Orig. cur post &amp;c. writeth thus: Why after 400. yeares
labourest thou to teach vs which we knewe not before?
Why doest thou bring foorth that which Peter
and Paul would neuer teach? Euen vntill this day the
Christian world was without thes doctrine, I wil hold
that faith an olde man in which I was borne a childe.
A worthie saying of Hierome, which may be rightly
applied against the Papistes, which teach such doctrine,
as neither Peter nor Paul would euer teach, nor the
Christian world knewe for 600. yeares after Christe,
yea for almost a thousand yeares after Christ in many
pointes. The like force is in the saying of Gregorie
Nazianzen, against the Arrian, Ep. 2. ad Clidon. Si ante
hos triginti &amp;c. 
                  If our faith beganne but 30. yeares agoe,
when there are almost 400. yeares since Christe was
shewed, and the Gospell hath for so long space bene
in vaine, our faith also hath bene in vaine: and they
which haue giuen witnesse thereto, haue testifid in
vaine, so many and so worthie prelates in vaine haue
gouerned the people. This saying is verified of Christian
faith, which had cōtinued in the world sixe, seuen,
or eight hundreth yeares, before Papistrie in many
pointes began, Christ hath bene preached, and yet Papistrie
neuer heard of, yea what so euer doctrine had a
latter beginning then Christ and his Apostles, this father

condemneth of error. Euen as the same man writeth
in the other place by M. Stapl. cited, De Theod. li. 2.
                  
                     Vt haec praesidia omittam &amp;c.
                   To omit these helpes, yet it
should satisfie vs, that none of those which haue bene
inspired with the spirite of God, hath hitherto either
pronounced this sentence, or allowed it being vttered
by any other, and the doctrine of our church doth abhor
it. He braggeth not vpon the present opinion of ye
Church, but as the same hath alwayes bene allowed of
al the Apostles and their successors, and ye contrarie neuer
receiued. Therfore wheras Theodoret reporteth yt
that confession of the faith was admitted (in ye Councel
of Nice) which preuailed, &amp; was published throughout
ye world, he meaneth not yt the Fathers folowed either ye
multitude, or the cōmon opinion of men, which were
reputed for the Church in that time, but bicause ye same
confession had alwaies euen from the beginning, bene
receiued and continued in ye Church, as consonant &amp; agreeable
to ye word of God, by which the Church must
be tried to be ye true Church, &amp; wheras articles of faith
are not proued true, bicause they be helde by thē y• are
commonly taken to be of ye Church. To conclude: The
prescription of Tertullian against Hermogenes we do
willingly admit, &amp; offer to be tried therby: yt whether
of our religion or theirs is ye more auncient, yt vndoubtedly
must be truth. But thē ye prescriptiō of 900. yeres
wherof Stapl. so often &amp; so much doth cackle, will not
serue ye Papists, as they cannot prescribe scarse halfe so
long, for many of their opinions. For except we be able
to proue our religion, as auncient as the time of
Christ and his Apostles, we refuse not to be accounted
heretikes. If we teach nothing but that we can iustifie,
by manifest demonstration out of the holy Scriptures,
y• same also in the most principall points, being confirmed
with the testimonie of the auncient fathers of the
primitiue Church, the Papistes which accuse vs of heresie,
shall be found not onely to be heretikes, but blasphemers
of God, and slaunderers of his Saints.
            
            
               
               CAP. XIX.
               It is proued by three reasons or arguments deducted out of
holy Scripture,Stapleton. that all the time of Papistrie can be no schisme
on heresie, and therefore was true Christianitie.
               The first reason is this. No heresie or schisme is vniuersall.Fulke.
The faith of England these 900. yeares was vniuersall,
ergo, it was no schisme or heresie. The minor
which is false, he would proue by this reason. The
faith of England was the faith of France, Spaine, Italie,
Germanie, and of all other Christian countries, therefore
it was vniuersall. This antecedent is false, for beside
yt in England, Fraunce, Spaine, Italie, &amp;c. since the
Church of Rome ceased to be the Church of Christ,
there were alwayes true Christians, which yelded not
to Papistrie: as many regions as he hath named of the
East countrie, helde not the faith which was then openly
receiued in England, in many principall articles, &amp;
namely in that which they make to be ye chiefe of all, ye
article of the Popes supremacie and subiection to the
Church of Rome: therfore al Christened coūtries were
not of ye same faith of Papistrie these 900. yeres. He laboreth
like a wise man to proue yt no sect is vniuersal:
but that Poperie was vniuersall, it is sufficient for Papistes
to say, bicause they are neuer able to proue it.
               The second reason is, that no heresie is of long continuance
to preuaile ouer true beleeuers, to oppresse
the trueth, &amp;c. Papistrie hath continued these 900.
yeares, therefore Papistrie is no heresie. Although the
minor be not simply true, yet ye maior is vtterly false.
But he would proue the maior out of S. Paul, 2. Tim.
3. saying of such as should withstand the trueth, like
Iannes and Iambres, that they should not further preuaile,
for their foolishnesse shall be made knowne to
all men, euen as theirs was. Admit that this were
spoken of those which should forbid marriage and

meates which he would haue to be the Manichees, 1.
Tim. 4. as it is spoken of hypocrites, which shall be in
the Church to the end of the world, yet here is no
shortnesse of time prescribed for the continuance of
their errour, for he saide before, 2. Tim. 2. vers. 16. That
they shall increase vnto more vngodlinesse, and their
word shall fret as a canker. He meaneth therefore, that
they shall not long continue vnknowne, not to all
men, but to all faithfull and godly men, as the follie
of Iannes and Iambres was not made manifest to all
the Egyptians, but vnto the Israelites. Likewise, whereas
Peter saith, 2 Peter 2. That the destruction of false
Prophetes sleepeth not, he meaneth not, but that they
may haue by succession a long continuance in the
world, for he him selfe admonisheth vs, that we may
not count the Lordes delaying of iudgement to be
slacknesse, as Stapleton doth, if it should be deferred
900. yeares: for one day with the Lord is as a thousand
yeares, and a thousand yeares as one day. Heretikes
therfore shal haue a quicke iudgement, &amp; heresie shall
shortly haue an end: for that neither of both shal cōtinue
alway vncondemned. But that his maior proposition
is vtterly false, which is: No heresie is of long
continuance; I shewe by these instances. The heresie
of them that ioyned Circumcision with the Gospell, is
more then 1500. yeares olde, and yet it continueth in
Affrica among Aethiopians, as witnesseth Munster and
other writers of Geographie, as also the heresie of the
Nestorians, which is 1200. yeares olde, and yet continueth
among the Georgians. Finally, so auncient as
the full tyrannie of the Pope is, so auncient is the departure
of the Greeke and Easterne Churches from
him, which they count to be a schisme and heresie.
               The third reason: No heresie can continue and ouergrowe
the true Church, Papistrie hath continued,
Ergo: Papistrie is no heresie. The minor of this syllogisme
is false, for Papistrie hath not continued from
the time of Christe, but hath had her beginning long

since, and was not growne to a ripenesse of all her heresies
in more then a thousand yeares after Christ▪ as I
haue shewed in the table of differences. Therefore
what so euer he saith to proue the maior, is to no purpose,
when the minor is manifestly false.
            
            
               CAP. XX.
               The third reason of the former chapter,Stapleton. is fortified out of the
aunicient and learned Fathers.
               Nowe he taketh in hand a goodly piece of fortification,Fulke.
and like a worthie surueior of the Popes buildings,
he bestoweth great cost out of Hilarius, Chrysostome,
and Clemens Alexandrinus, for defence of
such a point, as none of his aduersaries would euer offer
to assaile. Nameley, the continuance of the Church,
and true religion, which can not be ouercome, not kept
downe by any tyrannie or heresie, but the more it is
persecuted and oppressed, the more it will flourish and
increase. And for this cause the true Church and faith
of Christ, although it haue bene long troden downe
and afflicted by the tyrannie of Antichrist, euen to
such time as God had appointed, that Antichrist shuld
rage in the world, for the sinnes thereof, and especially
for the contempt of the trueth, 2. Thess. 2. yet hath it in
the end preuailed, encreased, and flourished, and by no
craft or crueltie of Antichrist, could any longer be
suppressed or kept vnder. Let not Papistes therefore
bragge, that they haue preuailed so long, but let them
nowe behold their ouerthrow, by the increase of Gods
Church, and looke for their finall destruction, at the
glorious appearing of our Sauiour Christ. We doubt
not therefore, but determine with Augustine De vtilitate
credendi, to rest in ye bosome of that Church, which
from the seate of the Apostle, by consent of mankind,
hath continued by succession of Bishops, and hath obtained
the height of authoritie, all heretikes barking

about it, which partly by the iudgement of the people
partly by the grauitie of Councels, partly by the maiestie
of miracles haue bene condemned. But we vtterly
denie the Popish Church to be this Church, which
hath had no continuance of succession from the Apostles
seate, in faith and doctrine, though it claime neuer
so much the succession of persons and places: with
the Donatistes, Symon Magus, Martion, Eunomius,
and other heretikes, we haue nothing to doe. If trueth
in Aerius and Vigilantius was condemned for errour,
not by the scriptures, but by the tradition of men, such
condemnation can be no preiudice to them or their opinion,
when being called againe into iudgement,
they are found by sentence of Gods word, &amp; the iudgement
of the more ancient Fathers, to haue ben wrongfully
condemned. To conclude, Papistrie hath not preuailed
against the church of God, which hauing sought
by all meanes so long time to roote her out of the
earth, yet was neuer able to bring to passe her wicked
deuice, but that the Church of Christ, and the true religion
thereof, hath at last, in the sight of al men, gotten
the vpper hand, in despight of the Pope and Papistrie,
and all Papistes.
            
         
         
            
            THE SECOND part of the Fortresse.
            
               CAP. I.
               CErtaine demaundes to Protestantes,Stapleton. putting the case that
Papistes these many hundreth yeres haue liued in a wrong
faith: all which (the case so put) they ought of necessitie
to satisfie.
               WHat so euer the Protestantes can say for them
selues (as their credite is not great with him)
except they can proue one of his two demaūds,Fulke.
he thinketh no godly or wise man will regard any
thing they can say.
               The first demaund is, where, or vnder what Pope, or
Emperour, Papistrie beganne. I aunswere, Papistrie being
antichristianitie, the mysterie of that iniquitie began
euen in the time of the Apostles, 2. Thess. 2. Claudius
being Emperour of Rome, and so contiuned increasing
in Apostasie, vntill the time of Sigismund the
Emperour, who procured the Councel of Constance,
in which the lay people were robbed of the cup of the
Lordes bloud. Stapleton must beare with me, if I can
not name the Pope, bicause at that time there were no
lesse then three Popes at once, and no man then liuing,
but as he was affectionate to one of those three,
could determine which of them was Pope. This Stapleton,
though he haue a brasen face, will not denie.
He requireth vs further to shewe the complaint of other
Churches against Papistrie. First, for the beginning
of the mysterie of iniquitie S. Paul complaineth,
2. Thess. 2. And for the proceeding of that which was ye
chiefe point therof, namely the tyrannie of ye Bishop of
Rome, alwayes as it shewed it selfe, some there were
which complained of it. Victor is the first Bishop of
Rome, which discouered the hid mysterie of iniquitie,

in vsurping against his fellowe Bishops, in the time of
the Emperour Seuerus, against whome complained &amp;
sharply reproued him Irenaeus Bishop of Lyons, Polycrates,
and many other, Euseb. lib. 5. cap. 25. Afterward
in the dayes of Theodosius, Honorius, and Arcadius,
the Emperours, when the Bishops of Rome Innocentius,
Bonifacius, Zosimus, Anastasius, and Celestinus
vsurped more openly, in so much that they forged among
them a decree of the Councel of Nice, whereby
they claimed their authoritie, they were complained
of by the Bishops and Church of Africa in open Councel,
the forgerie detected, and decrees made, that none
in Africa should appeale to any Bishop ouer the Sea.
And that the Bishop of the first See should not be called
prince of Priestes, nor by any such name of pride,
but onely Bishop of the first See. Conc▪ Mileuit. c. 22. Conc.
Carth. 6. cap. 4. Conc. African c. 92. &amp; Ep. Concil. ad Bonifac.
&amp; Caelestinum.
               
               Afterward in the dayes of the Emperour Mauritius.
when Iohn of Constantinople vsurped the title of
vniuersall Bishop, as the forerunner of Antichrist, Gregorie
him selfe Bishop of Rome complained of him,
and pronounced that he was the forerunner of Antichrist:
Wherefore Stapleton lyeth shamefully, when
he saith, we make him the first Antichrist: for as I haue
testified before, although there was in him a superstitious
affection vnto ceremonies, and that he was infected
with certaine olde errours that had preuailed
before his time, yet bicause he helde the foundation
of saluation by Christ onely, and detested the vsurpation
of that Antichristian title, we account him for a
member of the true Church of Christ. But after him
when in the dayes of Phocas, Bonifacius by pride and
symonie, had vsurped the same Antichristian authoritie,
and procured that the Church of Rome should be
counted head of all Churches, he was complayned
of by the Church of Rauenna in Italie, which would
not acknowledge that Antichristian title, neyther

would submitte her selfe vnto the whore of Babylon
before the time of Donus the Pope, which was almoste
seuentie yeres after: that Maister Stapleton misnameth
Martianus in steede of Mauritius I will impute
it to no ignorance, although, if such a faulte escape
any of vs, we are by and by cried out vpon, to be
ignorant in all antiquity, &amp;c. Thus haue I aunswered
Maister Stapletons demaunde, concerning the
principall foundation and rocke of Papistrie, although
no necessitie, suche as hee supposeth, doeth
moue mee. For albeit the precise time of
the entring of any heresie can not be named, yet
it followeth not that the same heresie is a trueth
therefore.
               The second demaunde is: when, and by whome
Luther was called, when he begunne to preache the
Gospell? I aunswere, if calling of the Popishe
Churche be lawfull, as the Papistes will not denye,
Luther had suche ordinary calling, as the Churche
where he liued did allowe, for he was called to be
a publike teacher, before the Popes pardoner came
into Saxony, against whose moste impudent blasphemies
and shamelesse errours he first inueyghed, in
his publike sermons. Wherefore concerning his
vocation, the mouthes of Papistes ought to be stopped.
But Stapleton will not be so satisfied, for he
sayeth, that the Popish Churche would neuer call
him to preache against her selfe: that is not materiall:
the Popishe Churche gaue him such authority
as she had to preache, whiche he vsed first to seeke
her reformation, if she had bene reformable: but
when he sawe her oppose her selfe against the manifest
trueth, he had iust cause to departe from her,
vnto the Catholike Churche of CHRISTE.
               It sufficeth not Stapleton, that hee learned by the
Scriptures, that the Churche erred, bycause all heretikes
abuse the Scriptures, as thoughe there were

no certainty of trueth to be founde in the Scriptures,
which blasphemie derogateth all authoritie from the
holy Scriptures inspired of GOD, whiche the Apostle
sayeth to bee able to reprooue all errours,
that the man of GOD may be perfecte prepared to
all good workes. 2. Tim. 3. ver. 16. Againe, where
hee affirmeth that he had the interpretation of the
Scriptures from heauen, Stapleton vrgeth, that then
he must shewe some miracle, as if the ordinary inspiration
of Gods spirite, (without the which no man
can vnderstand any of Gods mysteries) of necessitie
requireth confirmation of miracles. But Luther
him selfe (he sayeth) requireth miracles of Muncer,
whiche boasted of Reuelation, and so ought we to
doe of Luther. No sir, Muncer boasted of an extraordinary
Reuelation, and taught a doctrine directly
contrary to the worde of GOD written, and
therefore the case is nothing lyke. After this hee
telleth a slaunderous fable out of that runnagate
Baldwine, of the conference at Poissie, that Beza
and Martyr could not agree, whether their calling
was ordinary or extraordinary: the conclusion whereof
was this, that Beza was ordeined of Caluine, and
Caluine as Beza sayde of none. Which how impudent
and shamelesse a lye it is, that Beza should reprote
of Caluine, it is manifest to all men, that
knowe the storie of that Churche, and citie of Geneua,
that Caluine was called and ordeyned by the
Churche there, when he was altogether vnwilling to
remaine in that Citie, but in a manner compelled by
the earnest obtestation of Farellus. Cal. in Praefa, in
Psalm. Beza in vita Caluini.
               
               And yet more monstruous is that lye, that Beza
should grant the rebellion that followed, to be a
signe of his vocation, when the worlde knoweth,
that the beginning of these ciuill warres▪ came altogether
from the Papistes, the Duke of Guise
giuing the occasion, by the Diuelishe slaughter

and buchery of Vassie. But to the principall matter
in question: that Luther and some other hauing an
extraordinary calling from God, to teach and reforme
the Church, need not to con
                     •
                  irme their calling by miracles,
when they teach nothing but that is confirmed
by manifest authoritie of holy Scriptures, in the consciences
of all men, that wilfully oppose not themselues
against the trueth, either y• they will not knowe
it, or that they will not obey it: It is euident, by so many
prophets, as God stirred vp, in the olde time, which
had no extraordinary calling of the Church, being not
of the tribe of Leui, yet being only interpreters of the
lawe, needed no signes or miracle to confirme their
calling.
               Our Sauiour Christ himselfe confirmeth the extraordinary
calling of the Scribes and Pharisees, when he
willeth them, to be heard sitting in Moses chaire, of
which yet a great number, and almost all, were no Leuites
nor Priestes, therefore had no ordinary calling.
               Yet Gregory himselfe in the history of Bede, at the
first planting of the particular Church in Englande,
alloweth extraordinary ordeyning of Bishops. Lib. 1.
Cap. 27.
               Wherefore if Luthers calling were altogether extraordinary,
(as Papistes can not say, except they deny
the calling of their owne Churche) he is not bound
to approue his calling by miracles, when his doctrine,
and all things in which hee departeth from
the Church of Rome, is proued true and agreeable to
the word of God.
               The third demaunde is, that we must shewe a succession
from the Apostles, as the Scripture witnesseth
the Churche to haue, and the auncient fathers exacted
of Heretikes.
               The Scripture requireth no succession of names,
persons or places, but of faith and doctrine, and

that wee prooue, when we approue our faith and doctrine
by the doctrine of the Apostles. Neither had☜
the fathers any other meaning in calling vpon newe
vpstart heresies for their succession, but of a succession
of doctrine, as well as of persons. Which is manifest
by Tertullian De praescript, 
                  
                     Ita per successiones
&amp;c. So comming downe by successions, from the
beginning that their first bishop haue for his authors,
and antecessours, one of the Apostles or Apostolike
men, but yet such a one as hath continued with the Apostles.
These wordes of Tertullian are manifest,
that succession of Bishoppes euen to the Apostles, helpeth
not, excepte there be a continuance in the doctrine
of the Apostles, whiche when the Papistes can
shewe, we will gladly yeld vnto them. In the meane
time, it is not the continual succession of persons in
any place, which teach contrary to their antecessours,
which haue taught in that place, that can carry away
the credite of the whole doctrine, and religion of
Christe.
            
            
               CAP. II.
               An Introduction to the proofes which followe in the seconde
part of this fortresse.Stapleton.
               
               Repeating what he fantasieth he hath fortified before,Fulke.
(which howe weake it is, I haue sufficiently discouered)
in this Chapter: hee promiseth first to declare
by diuerse sure and necessary tokens, whiche
protestantes doe lacke, that the faith then planted, was
a right faith: which in many principall pointes, we
doe not denye, but that it was a right faith.
               Secondly, repeating the difference in doctrine,
gouernement, ceremonies, course and consequence
of both the religions, he will prooue all that they

had differring from vs, partly by Scripture, and partly
by the faith of the first sixe hundreth yeares. To
which I replye. First, that what so euer was then
taught contrary to that we teache, for matter of faith,
can not be prooued by Scripture. Secondly, that
although some errours, which then were taught, may
be prooued to haue bene helde within the sixe hundreth
yeares, yet they can not bee prooued, to haue
bene helde alwayes, especially in the oldest times, and
therefore can make no preiudice against our cause,
which take not vppon vs to allowe all thinges that
were helde in sixe hundreth yeares, no more then the
Papistes themselues doe. Finally, I haue shewed as
many differences of that time from the Papistes, as he
is able to shewe of vs from them, and yet some of his
differences are impudent forgeries.
            
            
               CAP. III.
               Fiue apostolicall markes found in our Apostles,Stapleton. and wanting
in Protestantes, who must be our Apostles, if the other
were not.
               The Protestantes take not vppon them to be Apostles,Fulke.
but professours and teachers of the Apostolike
doctrine. And therefore they boast of no miracles,
which is with him the first note of Augustines Apostleship:
which miracles if they were testified to vs
by an Euangelist, we might well beleeue them: but
seeing they are written by a credulous man, yt recordeth
euery fable that was tolde him, we haue small
cause to credite them▪ Bedes history is no Gospell.
Beside that, ye bryttish histories vtterly deny those supposed
miracles, reporting Augustine to be a minister
of Sathan rather then of God.
               But admit that he did some of those things, as are reported
of him, it might please GOD in respecte of

Christian faith, which he planted among the English
nation, to woorke some miracles by him, and
yet not to allowe all thinges that he taught.
Shall not the very workers of iniquitie saye in that
daye: Lorde, wee haue wrought miracles in thy
name, Matth. 7. vers. 22. As for the miracle
supposed to bee done by Master Lane of Westchester,
whiche hee scorneth at, I see not, but
it is as good as the best done by Augustine, and
yet for mine owne parte, I thinke it was no miracle,
but a naturall worke, the mayde perhaps
being affected with the mother or some such like
disease.
               The lyes he telleth of Luther and Caluine, out
of that vngodly rascall Staphylus, I thinke not
worthy to be spoken of: although he make him
selfe witnesse of the one, and the other is a monstrous
inuention of Sathan, which being reported
to be done in a noble citie, and before so manye
witnesses, can finde none that had the brasen
face like Staphylus, to saye he sawe it. Which
making and louing of lyes, sheweth Papistes to
be the right begotten children of the diuell, the father
of lyes.
               The miracles reported by Master Foxe: the shamelesse
beast, when he cannot denye, being testified by
witnesses: aboue all exception he can make, affirmeth
to be esteemed of his owne fellowes, but as ciuile
things, and such as may happen by course of reason. I saye
not this as though I woulde haue our doctrine the
rather to be credited one iotte more for anye such
miracle, but to shewe the shamelesse dogged stomacke
of this Popishe slaunderer, which when hee
had none other aunswere to make as concerning
such miracles, forgeth that wee our selues denye all
such to haue beene miracles, which he is not able to
prooue, although he woulde burst for malice against
the trueth.
               
                  
The seconde marke and difference is, that there
was one heart of the beleeuers, Augustine &amp; his company
neuer disagreed. The Protestants are at great
variance among them selues, not for learnings sake,
as the Concurrents in Italye, nor vppon quirkes and subtilties, in matters indifferent, as the schoolemen
that holde positions; but vpon the weightiest articles
of our beleefe, as heretikes are wont to holde opinions.
               I answere, among them that haue departed from ye
Church of Rome vnto y• Church of Christ, there hath
beene some variance about the Lordes supper, but yet
in no greater matters, then hath beene betweene two
godly martyrs of the primitiue Church, Cornelius
of Rome, and Cyprian of Carthage, about baptisme,
although not handled with like modestie on the one
part, as was then of both: yea, no greater then as yet remaineth vndecided among the Papistes, touching
y• authoritie of the Pope and the Popish generall Councell,
although they all, like Pilate and Herode, the
Pharisees &amp; Saducees, can agree together to put Christ
to death, and to persecute the trueth. Finally, if in the
first restoring of the truth, some matters to some men
were not so apparant, what marueile? when your Augustine,
and ours also, as farre as he was Christes, was doubtfull and ignorant, euen in very small &amp; trifling
matters, which argued some dissention of opinion in
him and his monkes, or else those questions might
haue beene determined without sending to Rome, li.
1. Cap. 27. &amp;c.
               The thirde marke is an ordinarie vocation, which
Luther lacked. I denye that Augustine had an ordinarie
vocation to preach in Englande, or that the Bishop
of Rome hath any ordinary authoritie, to sende
Apostles into the countries of any Infidels: which if
he had, they should be the Bishop of Romes apostles,
and not the Apostles of Christ. For they be his apostles
which hath authoritie to send them. But if Augustine

had ordinary vocation by the Bishop of Rome,
why had not Luther ordinary vocatiō of that church,
which authorized him to preach. If you say he could
haue no ordinarye vocation, because he was an heretike,
I aunswere: It followeth not, for euen heretikes
haue had ordinary vocatiō: namely, so many bishops
and priestes of Rome, Alexandria, and other places,
as after their calling haue fallen into heresies. Wherfore
leaue his vocation, which against you is good ynough,
and trye his doctrine. If his doctrine be found
true, and agreeable to the worde of God, who hath
stirred him vp to discouer openly the heresies of Antichrist,
let not his doctrine be refused for his extraordinarie
calling. The slaunders and vnlearned conclusions
against Luther. I omit, as vnworthie any aunswer,
being either false lyes of Staphylus, or inconsequent
collections of Stapleton.
               The fourth Apostolicall marke, is the continuance
of 900. yeares, whereas the Protestants doctrine hath
continued but 30. yeares, or as the blockheaded Papist
scorneth at M. Haddon 30. yeeres except 6. with
Gamaliels counsell vpon the matter, which with this
Popish priest, is good diuinitie: If this Councell or
worke be of men, it will come to nought, &amp;c. whose
antecedent being true, the conclusion is stark naught.
To this I aunswere: I haue shewed by many differences,
that the religion brought in by Augustine, hath
not continued without alteration in many pointes,
these 900. yeares. And albeit it had, yet it is not therby
proued true, because diuerse heresies haue continued
much longer time, which are not thereby iustified,
as of the circumcisers, Nestorians, &amp;c. yea, Mahometisme,
hath continued 900. yeares, begon with
fained miracles, commended by Sergius a monke,
which had ordinary vocation to teache, continued
with great cōsent these 900. yeres, which are 4. of Stapletons
apostolik marks, &amp; also techeth many things
that before were vnknowen, which is the fifth marke.
               
                  
Whereas Protestants haue added nothing to the faith
of Christ, but taken many things away from it. I answere:
if Augustine with him brought in all trueth,
and besides that some errours, which haue encreased
in processe of time, thicke and threefolde, Protestants
were worthie of thankes for remouing the errours,
though they brought in no new matters of faith: as
he is thankes worthie, which weedeth a garden or
feelde, although he sowe no newe seedes therein. But
it is most vntrue, that Papistes had all trueth before
we discouered their errours, for the doctrine of iustification,
of the worship of God, of the vse of good
workes, and of the sacraments, was either almost or altogether
lacking in Popery, which by the doctrine of
the Gospell is restored. But now let vs see what Protestants
haue taken away. Forsooth: From the quicke,
from the dead, from faith, from the Church, from Saints,
from God. From the quicke: free will, state of perfection, and
all merite of good workes. Yea, sir Pelagian, the Scripture
sayeth: No quicke man shalbe iustified in the sight of
God, Psalm. 143. v. 2. which taketh away all that you
haue giuen him. From the dead: all prayer &amp; intercession
for them. When you can allow the dead these things
out of the Scripture, we will not denye it to them.
From the faith: an article of Christes discention into hell. A
lewd lye of a slaunderous Papist. From the Church, as
it is the whole bodye: fiue sacraments. Three more then
Christ instituted. The continuall assistance of Gods holy
spirite, promised by our Sauiour. A shamefull lye. And
the visible sight in this world assured vnto vs by holy scripture.
That Scripture is yet to shewe, whereby the Churche
should be promised alwayes to be in open sight of y•
greatest parte of the worlde. From the Church, as the
spirituall parte, they haue taken supreme gouernement in matters
Ecclesiasticall. None other then such as is against
the Scripture: Let euery soule submit it selfe to the
higher powers, Rom. 13. ver. 1. Authoritie of making that
which Christ had them to make in his last supper. If you saye

you make the body of Christ, in such sence as you affirme
the sacrament to be the bodye of Christe, Gods
cursse light on you. The doing of all that Christe
commaunded to be done in remembrance of him, we
take not away. The power of binding and loosing, with
most of the authoritie due vnto that estate and vocation. A
very slaunder. From the Church they take Altars, crosses,
Images, &amp;c. Because the temple of God hath nothing
to doe with Images, 2. Cor. 6. ver 16. From God him
selfe: an externall sacrifice, the true proper seruice due to
God onely, and continually, as Saint Augustine prooueth at
large De ciuitate Dei. A slaunder of Augustine which
lib. 10. Cap. 20. calleth the Lordes supper a sacrament
of the oblation of Christe, the onely singuler sacrifice,
so that nowe there remaineth no more sacrifice
for sinne: for by one sacrifice once offered, he hath
made perfect for euer those that are sanctified, Heb.
10. ver. 14. by which only sacrifice, there was forgiuenesse
of our sinnes, and where there is forgiuenesse of
sinnes, there is no more sacrifice for sinne, Heb. 10.
18. You see what sure and stedfast apostolike
markes these are, which are founde in Mahomet, as
much as in Augustine, so that if Augustine had not
the worde of God to warrant the principall partes of
the faith, which he preached in Englande, by these
fiue markes, he might neither be proued to bee
an Apostle, nor yet a true preacher.
            
            
               CAP. IIII.
               Differences in doctrine betweene the primitiue faith of
Englande,Stapleton. and the heresie of Protestants. And first of Masse,
of the propitiation thereof: of intercession of Saintes: of their
commemoration at Masse time: of confession of sinnes, and of
merite of good workes.
               
                  
Concerning the differences, I haue written alreadie
in answere to his table of differences.Fulke. Nowe must
we see how he proueth them by testimonye of y• firste
600. yeares. The first in this Chapter and sixth in
number, is the Masse, whose name he may in deede
finde within the compasse of 600. yeares, although otherwise
taken then it is of papistes, but yet frō Christ
vntill 400. yeares be complete, the name of Missa is
not founde in any auncient authenticall writer. And
therefore he beginneth with Ambrose in his Epistle
E. 33. which place you shall finde discussed in mine
aunswere to Heskins lib. 3. Cap. 32. letting you to vnderstande
by the way, that he citeth the wordes otherwise
then they be, and so doeth M. Heskins, and yet
neither of thē both as they be in Ambrose: by which
it appeareth, that neither of them both read them in
Ambrose. Stapleton citeth them thus: Missam facere
caepi: Dwum offerrem, nuntiatum est, &amp;c. I began to say Masse:
whyle I offred, worde was brought to me, &amp;c. Ambrose saith
somewhat otherwise. The next testimonies he citeth
are out of Augustine, Ser. 251. &amp; 237. de tempore, which
all learned men knowe to be none of Augustines, but
if they were, they be after 400. yeares beforesaide.
The next is Leo, Ep. 81. Cap. 2. which in mine answere
to Heskins before quoted, you shall finde handled at
large. After this followe the Canons of 7. or 8. councels
prouinciall, in which the name of Missa is found:
but all kept aboue 400. yeares after Christ, and therfore
proue not a perpetuall continuance of that name
from Christ vntill the first 600. yeares ended. Besides
that, the Masses so named were neither informe nor
matter, that which the popish Masse is. For, concerning
y• forme, it was patched together in many partes
long after the first 600. yeares, as their own Pontificall
and other histories witnesse. Concerning the matter,
it was not the Popish Masse, for that there was in it a
Communion, and the naturall bodye of Christe was
not offered therein, which within the first 600. yeares,

was not beleeued to be really and corporally in the
Sacrament.
               The seuenth difference is: that the Masse is a propitiatorie
sacrifice, and was so beleeued in the first 600. yeares.
Whereof he reporteth him to Cyprian, Ser. 5. De lapsis:
who sayth: The conscience of sinners is purged with
the sacrifice of the priest. But Cyprians words are not
so, he speaketh of them, which being fallen in time of
persecution, made hast to the communion without
dewe repentance, and publike satisfaction to y• church,
and prayer of the priestes made for their sinnes. 
                     Ante
exomologesin factam criminis, ante purgatam conscientiam
sacrificio &amp; manu sacerdotis: before confession of their
offence being made, before their conscience be purged
by sacrifice &amp; hand of the Priest, &amp;c. These words
do shewe, yt he meaneth none other purging of their
conscience by sacrifice, then by imposition of y• priests
hands, which can be no propitiatorie sacrifice, but the
sacrifice of prayer of the priest for them: as for y• sacrifice
of the Masse, there is no mention of it. Againe,
he reporteth him to Hierome. To. 1. in Iouinianum,
saying: The Priest to offer dayly for his owne sinnes, and the
people. Neither are Hieromes wordes as he citeth
them, but thus: 
                     Sacerdoti, cui semper pro populo offerenda
sunt sacrificia, semper orandum est. The Priest which must
always offer sacrifice for the people, must always pray.
Where is here the sacrifice propitiatorie of the Masse?
when Hyeronyme expoūdeth his sacrifice for prayer,
in the second parte of the same worke, saying that
Christ In typo sanguinis sui non obiulit aquam, sed vinum. 
                  In
the figure or type of his bloud offered not water but
wine. Both denyeth transubstantiation &amp; the carnall
presence, &amp; also expresseth, what manner of oblation
he meaneth, when he vseth the name of sacrifice, offering,
oblation, namely a sacrifice of thankesgiuing in
remembrance of Christes death. Thirdly he reporteth
himselfe to Ambrose, lib. 1. Offic. Cap. 48. who affirmeth:
Christ to be yet offered in the Church for the remission

of our sinnes. But the report of Ambrose is cleane against
him. 
                     Antè agnus offerebatur, offerebatur vitulus. Nūc
Christus offertur: sed offertur quasi homo, quasi recipiens passionem,
&amp; offert se ipse quasi sacerdos, vt peccata nostra remittat
Hîc in imagine, ibi in veritate, vbi apud parem pro
nobis quasi aduocatus interuenit. Before a lambe was offered,
a calfe was offered. Now Christ is offered: but
he is offered as a man, as suffering his passion, and he
offreth him selfe as a priest, that he may forgiue our
sinnes. Here in an image, there in trueth, where hee
maketh intercession for vs as an aduocate with the father.
What can be more euident against the sacrifice
of the Masse? then that he sayeth, Christe is offered
here in an image, not in trueth: he is offered by him
selfe, not by a popish priest: he is offered as a man suffering
his passion, therefore not in an vnbloudy sacrifice,
but in an image of his bloudie sacrifice.
               Fourthly, he reporteth him selfe to Gregorie Nazianzene
Orat. 1. in Iulianum, who sayeth, 
                  
                      that by the oblation
of this sacrifice we are made partakers of the passion of
Christ.
                   He speaketh not of the Masse, but thus he saith:

                     Mox incruenti sacrificii oblatione manus commaculat, per quod
nor Christo vnimur, nec non passionis ac diuinitatis eius participes
reddimur. Anon he defileth his handes with the
offring of the vnbloody sacrifice, by which wee are
vnited to Christ, and are made partakers of his passion
and diuinitie. He calleth the ministration of the
communion, the oblation of the vnbloudie sacrifice,
as the fathers of that time did speake vnproperly.
But else where he sheweth expressely, that the onely
sacrifice of Christes death, is a propitiatorie sacrifice,
and such as cannot be repeated. In sanct Pasc. Or. 4.

                     Magnum illud &amp; insacrificabile (vt ita dicam) sacrificium,
quod in prima natura legalibus intermixtum est hostiis, non
pro parua orbis parte, neque pro paucis, sed toto mundo purgationem
obtulit aeuiternam. That great and vnsacrificable
sacrifice (as I may call it) which in the first age
was set foorth by the sacrifices of the lawe, he offered

to be an eternall purgation not for a small parte of
the world, nor for a fewe, but for the whole world.
               
               His fift report out of the counterfait Epistle of
Alexander Bishop of Rome, I will not vouchsafe to
aunswere.
               His sixt reporter is Origen. Hom. 13. in Leuiticum, who
writeth of the commemoration that Christ commaunded in his
last supper to be done, that: Ista est commemoratio sola quae propitium
facit hominibus Deum. This is the onely commemoration
which purchaseth propititation and mercy of GOD to
men. Although here be neuer a worde of the sacrifice
of the Masse, yet howe shamefully he applyeth onely
to the commemoration of the last supper that
which Origen speaketh not of that onely, but of the
propitiation by faith in his bloud, you shall easily
see by Origens whole sentence, out of which he hath
gelded this patch: 
                     Sed parua satis &amp; tenuis est huiusmodi
intercessio.
Quantum enim profecit ad repropitiandun,
vbi vniuscuiusque tribus per panem fructus, per fructus opera
considerāda sunt? Sed si referantur haec ad mysterii magnitudinem,
inuenies commemorationem istam habere ingentis repropitiationis
effectum. Si redeas ad illum panem qui de coelo
descendit, &amp; dat huic mundo vitam: illum panem propositionis,
quem praeposuit Deus propitiationem per fidem in sanguine
eius: &amp; si respicias ad illam commemorationem de qua dicit
dominus: hoc facite in meam commemorationem: inuenies
quòd ista est commemoratio sola, quae propitium faciat hominibus
Deum. Speaking of the shewe breade of the
Lawe, he sayeth: But smal and little worth is such intercession.
For howe much hath it profited vnto propitiation,
where the fruit of euery tribe by bread, &amp; by
their fruit their works are to be cōsidered? But if these
things be referred to the greatnes of the misterie, thou
shalt find this commemoration to haue effect of great
propitiation. If thou returne to that bread which
came downe from heauen, and giueth life to the
world: that bread of proposition, which God hath set
forth to bee a propitiation by faith in his blood:

and if thou look vnto that commemoration, of which
the Lord sayeth: do this in remembrance of mee, thou
shalt finde that this is the onely cōmemoration which
maketh God merciful to men. Thus you see that Origen
taketh not the sacrament alone, but Christ and
faith in his blood, wherof the sacrament is a commemoration,
to be the only propitiation for our sinnes,
figured in the shew breade.
               His last man is Augustine, De ciuitate Dei, li. 22. Ca. 8.

                     Vir tribunitus Hesperius &amp;c. Hesperius a worshipful man
who is with vs, hath in his territorie of Fussala a piece
of ground called Cuber. In y• which place, vnderstanding
his house to be vexed with euil spirits, to y• great
affliction of his cattell and seruants, required in my
absence our priests, that some of them would go thither,
by whose prayers they might depart. One went
thither. He offered there the sacrifice of the bodye of
Christ, praying as much as he was able, that the same
vexation might cease. Incontinently through y• mercie
of God 
                        〈◊〉
                      ceased. Here is nothing but the name of
sacrifice, which the fathers then vsed vnproperly for y•
celebration of the communion. But that by merite of
that sacrifice, God was pacified to cast out those diuels.
Augustine sayeth not, but Stapleton absurdly gathereth.
For Augustine calleth the death of Christe the
singuler and onely true sacrifice. Cont. advers. leg. &amp;
proph. lib. 1, Cap. 18. Therefore the communion was vnproperly
a sacrifice, but of thanks giuing, as the same
Augustine writeth De fide ad Pet. Cap. 19 &amp; Cont. aduers. leg.
&amp; Proph. lib. 1. Cap. 20. Wherefore his Popish bragg
notwithstanding, here is neuer an ancient father within
the 600. yeares that acknowledgeth the propitiatorie
sacrifice of the Masse.
               The eight difference, is intercession of saints, which
Protestants abhorre. There is no man denyeth, but
that this errour preuailed within the time of the first
600. yeares, and namely in the later 300. years. For in
the first 300. there is nothing to be found, whereby it

may be gathered. Epiphanius accompteth inuocation
of Angels an heresie of the Caiani. Tom. 3. H. 38. And
although some shewe of inuocation of saints in the
later time may be excused by rethorical exornation, as
M. Grindall truely sayd, &amp; some prayers for the dead,
as yt of Ambrose for Theodosius, whome both he calleth
a perfect seruant of god, &amp; yet prayth fos his rest,
which agreeth not with popish prayers for them in
Purgatory: yet it is confessed yt this was one of y• spots
of that time, which being not proued by scripture, can
be nothing else but a superstition of men. What said
I? can it not be proued by scripture? beholde the learned
clerke M. Stapl. proueth it out of S. Peter, Ep. 2.
Ca. 1. I thinke it right as long as I am in this tabernacle,
to stirre you vp and admonish you, being certeine
that I shall shortly leaue this tabernacle, according
as our Lord Iesus Christ hath signified vnto me.
But I will endeuour also to haue you often after my death, that
you may remember these things. Here is a strange kind of
translation of these wordes of his owne Latine texte.

                     Dabo autem operam &amp; frequenter habere vos post obitū meū,
vt horum memoriam faciatis. But I will endeuour also yt
you may haue after my departure, whereby to make
remembrance of these things. For I wil neither trouble
him with the Greeke text, which perhaps he regardeth
not, nor with Erasmus translation, which are
without all ambiguitie. But I apeale to Grāmarians,
whether habere vos, in this place may be reasonably
construed, to haue you, or else be resolued by vt habeatis
vos, that you may haue. His collection is more
monstrous then his construction: for thus he addeth
immediatly after his translation. I aske here: How will S.
Petter after his death endeuour and procure, that the people
may remember his sayings? They will not, I dare say, say that
he will come in a vision, or by reuelation vnto them. What remaineth
then, but that he will further them with his good prayers?
And so doe the auncient Greeke Scholies expound this
place. And I aske here: Howe prooue you that S.

Peter after his death will endeuor &amp; procure for them?
O shamelesse corruption. S. Peter saith, that bicause he
hath not long to liue, he will not only put them in remembrance
liuing, but also leaue his Epistle, that it
may be a perpetuall admonition of them, euen after
he is deade. But the auncient Greeke Scholies (as he
saith) doe so expound it. Why are not those Scholies
set downe, and their antiquitie shewed to be within
the compasse of the first sixe hundreth yeares? In
deede Occumenius which liued about fiue hundreth
yeres last past, reporteth that some did wrest that text
vnto such a sense, but they which did simplie handle y•
words of S. Peter, did expound it as I haue done before.
               The 9. difference, is commemoration of Saintes at
Masse time. If you meane commemoration onely, as
I haue shewed before, we make it in our Communion,
and therefore this is no difference, but a lye of Master
Stapleton, for we say: Therefore with Angels and
Archangels, and all the holy companie of heauen, we
laude and magnifie &amp;c. Likewise in the Collectes
mention is made of the Apostles, whose memorie our
Church doth keepe. In deede, we vse no inuocation of
Saints, which was vsed within the latter 300. yeares, but
not to be proued in the first 300 yeares. Neither do we
thinke the honour of Saintes to be a dishonour to
God, but such honour as robbeth God of his glorie,
which he will not communicate with any creature.
But Augustine sheweth the memorie of Martyrs to be
kept of the Christian people, Ad excitandam imitationem,
&amp; vt merius eorum consocietur atque orationibus adi
                        •
                     uetur.
To stirre vp imitation, and that they may be ioyned in fellowship
of their merites, and helped with their praiers. The fellowship
of their merites, he meaneth to be made like
them in good workes. For he acknowledged no desert
of our good workes, but onely the mercy of God. It
is pitie that Iulian the Apostata had so great occasion
to charge the Christians with superstition of sepulchres,
whereof they had no ground in the Scriptures.

Although Cyrillus defendeth no superstition, but only
a reuerent estimation of the tombes of the Martyrs
for their vertues sake, after the example of the
heathen. Againe he saith, that the reliques of the dead
were not seene bare, and negligently cast vpon the
earth, but well laide vp: and hidden in the bosome of
their mother in the deapth of the earth, wherein they
differred not a little from the vsage of Papistes, about
their reliques. Cyrill. Contr. Iulian lib. 10. The pride of
Eustachius in contemning the publike Churches, ministring
in corners, we condemne with the Councel
of Gangra. Concerning the reading of the passions of
Martyrs in the Church, which he cauilleth that Master
Iewell left out in his replie to Doctor Harding, out
of the seuen and fourtie Canon of the Councel of Carthage
3. Bartholmewe Garizon confesseth, that it is
an addition, and without all such addition, the same
that M. Iewell requireth, that nothing be read in the
Church, but the canonicall bookes, as the 59. Canon of
the Councel of Laodicea.
               The 10. difference is of confession and penance, in
which he maketh two kinds, open confession &amp; priuate,
for the open confession vsed in the primitiue Church,
he bringeth many proofes out of Actes 19. Augustine,
Tertullian, Cyprian, the councel of Nice. Which need
not, for we graunt that it was vsed, &amp; we our selues according
to such discipline as our Church of England
hath, doe vse it, that publique and notorious offenders
make publique confession of their faultes, for satisfaction
of the congregation. But when this publique
confession was abused, he saith, that this practise of
the Church and the counsel of S. Iames, willing Christians
to confesse one before an other, was restrained to
the auricular confessiō of y• priest only. But neither he
sheweth when, nor by what authoritie the counsel of y•
the Apostle, and practise of the Church was thus altered.
He citeth an Epistle of Innocentius ad Decentium.
cap. 7. to proue, That particular confession was not first instituted

in the Councel of Latarane, as Caluine babbleth, but that
if a man were diseased, he should not tarrie for the time of
Easter, but Mox confiteri, be shriuen out of hand, which was not
done in the face of the Church, but priuatly in the chamber.
Whereas this Mox confiteri for all his shamelesse and
ignorant babling, is not at al in that chapter, which is
this. 
                     De poenitentibus verò, qui siue ex grauioribus commissis,
saue ex leuioribus panitentiam gerunt. si nulla interueniat aegritudo,
quinta feria ante Pascha eis remittēdum, Romanae ecclesiae
consuetudo demonstrat. Coetterùm de pondere aestimando
delictorum, sacerdotis est iudicare, vt attendat ad confessionem
poenitentis, &amp; ad fletus atque lachrymas corrigentis, ac nom iubere
dimitti, cùm viderit congruam satisfactionem. Sane, si quis
in aegritudinem inciderit, atque vsque ad desperationem deuenerit,
ei est ante tempus pasche relexandum ne de saeculo absque
communione discedat. Nowe concerning penitents, which
either for greater or smaller offences do penance, if no
sicknesse come betweene, the custome of the Church of
Rome sheweth, that they must be released the fifth
day before Easter. But as for esteeming their offences,
it is the priestes part to iudge, that he may giue heede
to the confession of him that repenteth, &amp; to the teares
and weeping of him that amendeth, and then to bid
him be dismissed, when he shall see conuenient satisfaction.
But truely if any man fall into sicknesse, and
that he be come euen to desperation, he must be released
before the time of Easter, that he depart not out of
the world without the Communion. Here is no word
of shriuing, for the cōfession was made publikely before
penance inioyned, and if in this case, of necessitie
there were confession in the chamber, it is not proued
to be auricular, nor common to all men without the
case of necessitie. That which he citeth afterward out
of Hierome in Eccles. cap. 10. is meant of asking counsel
of an afflicted conscience. For Innocentius that was after
Hieronyme, testifieth of the publike confession of
the Church. The rest also that he citeth out of Augustine
and Cyprian is plaine of open confession, and neuer

a word of auricular cōfession inioyned by Papists
vnder paine of damnation he can bring within the first
600. yeres. Wherefore I will helpe him. Sozomenus
lib. 7. cap. 16. sheweth, that in the Church of Constannople,
a Priest was appointed, which should heare confessions
of them that came to him, and inioyning penance,
should absolue them, but by Nestorius this order
of confession was taken away, bicause a certain noble
woman was corrupted in the Church by a Deacon.
Where also he sheweth, that the custome of Rome
was to do open penance, and not priuate. This writer
testifieth of priuate cōfession vsed and abolished within
the 600. yeares, but with infinite inconueniences instituted
a fresh in y• later Romish Councel of Latrane.
               The 11. difference is of the merite of good workes,
which he will proue by Scripture, first out of Ecclesiasticus
16. All mercy shall make place to euery man according
to the merite of his workes. Which is neither canonicall
scripture, nor rightly tāslated, for according to y• truth
of the Greeke it is thus. He wil giue place to al good
deeds, and euery one shal find according to his works.
The second text is 1. Pet 4. Charitie couereth the multitude
of sinnes. By which y• Apostle meaneth (as Salomon, out
of whose Prouerbes he citeth it) that euen as hatred
causeth brawling, and discouering of mens infirmities,
so charitie couereth and concealeth the multitude of
our brothers offences. This is nothing for merite. The
third place. 2. Pet. 1. When he biddeth vs to labour, to make
sure our vocation &amp; election by good workes. By which words
the Apostle willeth vs to confirme vnto our selues the
certaintie of our calling and election, (which is most
certaine to God,) by the necessarie effectes and fruites
of our election and calling, which are good workes,
not the cause, but the effect and end of our election.
He hath chosen vs that we might be holy Ephe. 1. not
bicause we were holy. His fourth text is, 2. Cor. 8. Let
your aboundance supplie their lacke, that their aboundance may
supplie your lacke also. Which I agree with him, and Theodoret

to be the communiō of Saints, but I denie that
the communion of Saints is of merites, but of graces
and benefites of God.
               The last text is Col. 1. S. Paul perfourmed in his flesh
such as lacked of the passions of Christ, that is, the effectes and
fruits therof, which was to suffer with Christ, for his body, which
is the Church, meaning that the Church and not he onely should
haue merite thereby. This blasphemie was farre from S.
Pauls meaning, who saith not, that he should merite any
thing which Christe had not merited, but that he
as a member, should suffer that which Christ had not
suffered, who suffered as the head for our eternall redemption,
and Paul as a member suffered to be made
conformable to the head, not to redeeme the Church,
but to giue testimonie to the Gospell of saluation, for
the edifying of the Church. Wherefore I wil conclude
with Ambrose ad Virgin. exhor. 
                  
                     Vnde mihi tantum meriti
est, cui indulgentia pro coronae est? Whence should I haue so
great merite, when mercy is my crown? and with Augustine
in Psal. 43. Quid dicturi sumus? merita nostra fecisse
vt nobis illa salus perpetua mitteretur à domino? absit: si
merita nostra aliquid facerent, ad damnationem nostram veniret.
What shall we say? that our merites haue caused
that this perpetual saluation should be sent to vs from
the Lord? God forbid. If our merites did any thing, it
should come to our damnation.
               
            
            
               CAP. V.
               Of the single life in the Cleargie,Stapleton. of the state of Virginite in
Nunnes, of Monkes and Friers, of the vowed profession of both.
               The 12. difference is the single life of the Cleargie.Fulke
                  He saith we reade expressely lib. 1. cap. 27. in Bedes historie,
that none of the Cleargie had wines that were within holy orders.
Howe expressely we reade, you shal heare the very
words of his own trāslatiō. And if there be any among
y• Cleargie out of holy orders, which cannot liue chast,
they shall take wiues, and haue their stipend allowed

them without. Here is no expresse words, that none of
the Cleargie that were within holy orders had wiues:
but a particular order for Augustine, and in respecte
that he was a Monk, not to haue his portion of the oblations
seuered frō his Cleargie, &amp; if any of his Cleargy
were married, so that he was not to liue in the College
among vnmarried men, that he should haue his
stipende allowed abroade. For the manner of the see
Apostolike was then, (as Gregory saith) whiche the
Papistes nowe obserue not, to giue commaundement
to such as be made bishops, that all maner of oblations
that are giuen, be diuided into 4. portions. And the
one thereof giuen to the Bishop toward his hospitality,
the other to the Cleargie, the third to the poore, the
fourth to the reparation of the Churches. So that there
is no rule for the Cleargie of other Bishops, yt were no
Monkes, but that they might marrie, if they could not
liue chaste, as wel within holy orders as without, &amp; so
was the practise of the Churche of England, more then
400. yeares after, vntil the decree of Lanfrancus. Anno
1076., who yet was more fauourable to them that had
wiues, then Stapleton, which would haue them put away.

                     Decretū est, vt nullus Canonicus vxorē habeat, Sacerdotū
verò in Castellis vel in vicis habitantium habentes vxores, non
cogantur ut dimittant: non habentes interdicantur, ut habeant.
Et deinceps caueant Episcopi, vt sacerdotes vel diacones non
praesumant ordinare, nisi prius profiteantur vt vxores non habeant.
It is decreed, yt no Canon may haue a wife. But
of Priestes dwelling in townes and villages, suche as
haue wiues, let them not be compelled to put them away.
But such as haue not, let them be forbidden to
haue. And from hencefoorth let Bishops take heede,
that they presume not to ordeine priestes or deacons,
excepte they doe first professe to haue no wiues.
               
               This decree prooueth that before this time, not
onely married men were ordeined priests, but also that
priestes after they were ordeined did take wiues. The
same is prooued by the woordes of the Epistle of

Gerardus, which was afterward Archb. of Yorke, vnto
Anselm Archb. of Canterbury. 
                     Cum ad ordines aliquos inuito,
dura ceruice renituntur, ne in ordinando castitatē profiteantur.
When I call any to orders, they resist with a
stiffe necke, that in taking order they doe not professe
chastitie. But nowe when this iolye fortifier
should proue the single life of all the Cleargie in the
first sixe hundreth yeares, he can bring nothing but
certaine decrees, that such as were promoted to priesthoode
vnmarried, should not after marrie, yet he
confesseth that there were many married men taken
vnto the order of priesthoode, but seldome, he saith, in
the Latine Church. Yet let vs see his authorities: first
Augustine lib. 2. cap. vlt. de adulter. in coniugis: sayth that
they were wont to bring example of the continencye
of Clearkes, to perswade men to absteine from adulterous
marriages. 
                     Solemus eis proponere etiam continentiam
clericorum, qui plerum
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         ad eandem sarcinam subcundam
capiuntur inviti, eam
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         susceptam vsque ad debitum finem Domino
iuuante producunt. We are wont to set before them
the continencie of Clearkes, which are oftentimes taken
against their willes to beare the same burthen, &amp;
when they haue taken it vppon them doe bring it to
the due end, the Lord assisting them. Of this he gathereth,
that the Cleargie in Saint Augustines dayes
refrained from wiues all the dayes of their life, which
as it is true of some, so it is vtterly false of all. Againe
the compulsion which he speaketh of, was not vnto
continencie, but vnto the ministerie, and in the ministery
not of necessitie of greater estimation. As the
words immediately following do declare. 
                     Dicimus ergo
eis, quid si &amp; vos ad hoc subeundum populorum violentia caperemini:
nonne susceptum castè custodiretis officium, repentè
conuersi ad impetrandas vires a Domino de quibus nunquam
anteà cogitastis? Sed illos inquiunt honor consolatur. Respondemu
                           •
                        ,
&amp; vobis aempliùs limor moderetur. Si enim hoc multi
Dei ministri repentè atque inopinatè impositum susceperunt,
sperantes se illustriùs in Christi haereditate fulgere, quanto magia

vos adulteria cauendo vivere debetis, metuentes non in regno
Dei minus lucere, sed in Gehennae ignibus ardere. We say
therefore vnto them. What if you also were taken by
the violence of the people to beare the same? Would
you not keepe chastely the office taken vpon you: being
sodenly turned, to obtaine of the Lorde suche
strength as before you neuer thought of? But the honour
(say they) doth comfort them. We answere. And
feare should more restraine you. For if many ministers
of God haue taken vpon them this thing beeing layde
vpon them sodenly and vnlooked for, hoping that
they shal shine more notably in the inheritaunce of
Christ: howe much more ought you to liue so as you
beware of adulterie, fearing not to shine lesse in the
kingdome of God, but to burne in the fiers of hell?
               
               Next he citeth a Canon ascribed to the Apostles, out
of Iustinian confirmed in the sixt generall councell
of Constantinople in Trullo. Ex coniugatis, &amp;c. Of suche
as come to the cleargie vnmarried and after wil marrie, we permit
that onely to the readers and singers. Neuerthelesse
he confesseth, that Zonoras expoundeth this so, that
if any refuse to liue chaste beeing asked at his orders
taken, he is permitted first to marrie, and then admitted
to the ministery. And the councell of Constantinople
in the same sixt Canon. 
                     Si quis autem eorum qui
in Clerum accedunt, velit lege matrimonii mutieri coniungi, antequam
Hypodiaconus vel Diaconus vel presbyter ordinetur,
hoc faciat. But if any of them whiche come into the
Cleargie, will be ioyned to a woman by the lawe of
matrimony, let him doe it before he be ordeyned Subdeacon,
Deacon or Priest. Where is nowe the necessitie
of single life in the Cleargie.
               After this he citeth the councell of Ancyra Can. 10.
which is cleane contrary to his purpose, if he had recited
it whole as he only taketh the tayle. The Canon
is this. 
                     Diaconi quicunque cùm ordinantur, si in ipsa
ordinatione protestati sunt dicentes, velle se habere vxores, nec
posse se continere, hi postea si ad nuptias venerint, maneant in

ministerio, proptereà quod his Episcopus licentiā dederit. Quicun
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                        
sanè tacuerunt &amp; susceperum manu
                           •
                         impositionem, professi
continentiam, si postea ad nuptia
                           •
                         venerint, a ministeria
cessare debebunt. Whoso euer when they are ordeyned
Deacons, if in the very time of their ordeyning,
they make protestation and say, that they will haue
wiues, &amp; that they can not conteyne, if these afterward
come to be married, let them remaine in the ministery,
because the Bishop hath giuen them licence. But truely
whosoeuer hath helde their peace, and receiued imposition
of handes, professing continence, if after they
marrie, ought to ceasse from the ministery. This
Canon sheweth, that it was lawfull for the Cleargie
beeing in holy orders to marrie, if they professed not
continence, to which profession none was bound, as
they are in Poperie.
               Againe if after profession they married, they were
not deuorced as Papistes vsed in Queene Maries time,
but commaunded to absteine from the ministerie.
               The last authoritie he citeth is out of the Synode
of Neocaesaria presbiter, &amp;c. A priest if he marrie a wife ought
to be deposed from his order. It followeth in the same Canon.
But if he committe fornication or adulterie, he
must be moreouer cast out of the Church, and driuen
to doe penance among lay men. This was a decree of
17. Bishops in the prouince of Paulus Polemoniaca,
and is to be vnderstoode of such a priest as professed
continencie. Whose marriage yet was not made voide,
but he put out of his office, whereas he that had committed
fornication, was put both out of the ministerie,
and of the Church, which seeing the Papistes obserue
not in their lecherous priestes, they haue small
right to vse this Canon, which yet bindeth none but
that prouince that made it.
               Nowe where he saith, it was a rare thing for the Cleargie
of the Latine Church to be married, Hierome no
friende to marriage, shall testifie the contrary, who
speaketh of it as of an ordinary matter. Eliguntur

mariti in sacerdotium, non nego, quia non sunt tanti virgines
quanti necessarii sunt Sacerdotes. 
                  Married men are chosen
vnto the Priesthood, I denye not, because there are
not so many virgines, as it is necessary there should
be priestes. And Oceano he confesseth that by the
doctrine of the Apostles, priestes might haue wiues,
complayning that in his time all other qualities of a
minister described by the Apostle were neglected,
onely the libertie of marriage looked vnto. Qui dixit
vnius vxoris virum, &amp;c. 
                  He that saide the husbande of
one wife, euen he commaunded that he should be vnreproueable,
sober, wise, comely, harberous, a teacher,
modest, not giuen to wine, no fighter, no quareller, not
couetous, no young nouice in the faith. Ad haec omnia
claudimus oculos, solas videmus vxores. At all these thinges
we shut our eyes, we see nothing but their wiues.
               
               Likewise in Aggeum Cap. 1. He inueygheth against
the rulers of the Churche, which building their carnal
house, prouiding for their children &amp; possessions,
neglected the building of the temple of God. Againe
in Epi. ad Eph. li. 3. Ca 6. He inueygheth against Bishops
and priests of his time, that broughtvp their children
in secular and prophane learning, peraduenture at
the charges of the Church. Yea diuers Popes haue ben
married men, for Pope Siluerius was sonne of Pope
Hormisda, as the very pontifical witnesseth: and Beda
sheweth lib. 2. cap. 1. that Pope Felix was great grandfather
to Pope Gregory.
               I will spende no more time in so cleare a matter.
Wherefore the single life required of necessitie in the
Cleargie, is not prooued within the 600. yeares so
often named.
               The thirteenth difference is, of the state of virginitie
in men and women. Such state protestantes acknowledge not,
but rather abhorre it, and persecute it. It is a mere slander,
for we honour virginitie that is not counterfet, in thē
that had made them selues chaste for the kingdome
of heauen. But when Master Stapleton will make

virginitie impossible to no man, he is directly contrary
to our Sauiour Christ. Non omnes &amp;c. all men can
not receiue this saying, but they to whome it is giuen;
Mat. 19. and to Saint Paule. 1. Cor. 7. Qui non conunet,
he that can not conteine, let him marrie. I confesse
also, that within the sixe hundreth yeares, there were
some Colleges of virgines, which differed as muche
from Popishe Nunnes, as many Popish Nunnes from
honest women. They liued not idly, as Popish Nunnes,
of their landes and reuenewes, but with spinning, and
making of cloth, they mainteined themselues, August.

                     ae Cap. 31. They liued continently,
or else they married. Popish Nunnes though they
liue neuer so incontinently, yet will they neuer marrie.

chastity, but such as is fayned chastity, and hath only a
name of chastitie Volentes esse in honore propter putatam apud

for the supposed exercise of chastitie among them,
when there is nothing lesse then chastitie.
               Concerning the rule of Augustine Ep. 109. praescribed
to the virgines that tumultuously and seditiously
would haue chaunged their gouernesse, if we
doe admitte it to be written by Saint Augustine,
yet it is not sufficient to authorize the superstitious
orders of Popish Nunnes. Among whom their habite
is not the least part of their superstition, which Augustine
in his virgines forbiddeth to be notable or differing
from other women. 
                     Non sit notabilis habitus vester,
nec affectetis vestibus placere, sed moribus. Let not your
apparell be such as may be noted or marked, neither
desire ye to please with garments, but with manners.
The like writeth Hierome concerning the apparell of
virgines of his time. Againe Saint Augustines virgines
were not bound to their Cloyster, but might departe,

if they liked not the seueritie of their rule, or else
were expulsed from thence. 
                     Conuicta secundum praeposuae
vel praesbyteri arbitrium debet emandatoriam sustinere vindictam,
quam si fortè recusauerit, &amp; siipsa non abscesserit, de
vestra societate proijciatur. She that is conuicted (but of
wanton lookes) according to the decree of the Gouernesse
or priest, ought to sustaine a punishment for
her amendment, which if she refuse to beare, and if she
her selfe depart not away, let her be caste cleane out
of your societie. If this rule were obserued, fewe Popish
Nunnes should be left in their Cloysters. Moreouer,
Saint Augustines virgins were commanded to vnderstand
what they did pray or sing, not one among
fortie of Popish Nunnes vnderstand their Popishe seruice
which they sing. 
                     Psalmis &amp; Hymnis cùm oratis Deū,
hoc versetur in corde, quod profertur in voce. When you
pray to God with Psalmes and Hymnes, let that be in
your heart which is pronounced in your voyce. These
and many other differences may be obserued whiche
are sufficient to confute Stapleton, which would make
his Popish Nunnes al one with ye virgins of the ancient
&amp; purer Church. But Eusebius out of Philo sheweth ye
euen in the Apostles time there were 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
Oratories and Monasteries of men &amp; women lib. 2. cap.
16. It is true ye Eusebius so iudgeth: but who so readeth
Philo his own writing shall plainly see y• he speaketh
rather of a sect of Iewes at Alexandria giuen to contēplatiō,
&amp; not of Christians. Beside this ye monasteryes
which he speaketh of were not Abbies, wherin they liued,
but only solitary places of study for a time. For
in them they had neither meate nor drink, as Philo expressely
affirmeth. To conclude, seing that in the scripture
we haue no commandement for virgins, we commend
them y• haue the gift, &amp; exhort them so to continue.
But seeing the gift is rare in our dayes, and the
examples of them that haue professed virginitie, and
liued abhominably, are too many, we thinke it neither
needful nor expedient, to set vp Colleges of virgines,

nor to exact any vowe of them, but to leaue them to
their conscience and liberty, which the holy Ghoste
hath giuen them.
               The fourteenth difference is of Monks and religious men,
as though none were religious, but Monkes. I confesse
they had within the sixe hundreth yeares, men that liued
a solitary life, called Monachi, Anachoreti, Fremitae
&amp;c. but no more lyke our Popish boares, liuing
in their frankes, then angels are like to diuels. Their
differences I haue shewed euen out of Bede in the table
of differences. But Stapleton saith, that the faultes
of a fewe ought not to haue caused subuertion of the
whole orders. I answere, they were so fewe that offended,
that they were almost all naught. And what be
the Monkes of Flaunders where he dwelleth at this
day? be they much reformed? Is not idlenes, drunkennesse,
brawling their greatest exercise, when they
be free from idolatrie and superstition? Howe many
learned men be in those Cloysters that are diligent
preachers, euen in the Popishe Churche? What
their chastity is God knoweth. But the Country speaketh
euil of them. In his title of the Chapter, he speaketh
of Friers, whereof I had great maruell to see his
impudency, that would promise to prooue them to
haue bene within the first sixe hundreth yeares, that
sprong not vp more then twelue hundreth yeares after
Christ. But in this section of the Chapter there
is no worde of them. Neither could the Popishe
Monkes themselues abide them, euer since their arising.
               The fifteenth difference is vowes of virginitie, both
in men and women, and here he bringeth in Friers in
the Diuels name, to be as auncient as S. Augustine,
Whose wordes he thus translateth in 1. Tom. 5. 
                     Nemo
ergo positus in Monasterio frater, dicat, recedo de Monasterio.
Therefore let no Frier placed in a Monastery, say, I
will departe out of the Monasterie &amp;c. 
                  This testimony
of Saint Augustine (he saith) may suffice to shewe that in the

Church of the first sixe hundreth yeares both Friers &amp; Nunnes
vowed virginitie &amp;c. Surely my lunges will not serue
me to crie loude ynough against the impudencie of
this shamelesse creature, that to abuse the ignoraunt,
translateth Frater, in S. Augustine, by ye Popish French-English
name of Frier, to make them beleeue, that the
Augustine friers were instituted by Saint Augustine,
which are not yet two hundreth yere olde. For about
the yeare of our Lorde one thousand foure hundreth
and sixe, this order of Friers vnder the name of Saint
Augustine, was first erected by one Redus Comes montis
granelli, and one Gualterus Marsus his coadiutor at Fesula
a Citie of Hetruria, confirmed by Gregory 12. one
of the two Popes, that then ruled the rost both togeher,
the one in Italy the other in France. Cronic. Cronicorum.
Herm. Sched.
               
               Nowe touching the vowe of virginitie made in
those auncient times, that it was not free to returne to
the worlde as both Erasmus and Polidore affirme,
whom he chargeth very fondly and ignorantly so to write. How
farre it did binde, you shall heare, first out of Epiphanius,
and then out of Hierome. Epiphanius contra Apost.
Haer. 61. lib. 2. To. 1. thus writeth.
               
                  
                     Melius est iraque vnum peccatum habere &amp; non plura.
Melius est lapsum a cursu palam sibi vxorem sumere secundum
legem, &amp; a virginitate multo tempore poenitentiam agere.
&amp; sic rursus ad Ecclesiam induci, v
                           •
                        lut qui mala operatus
est, velut lapsum &amp; fractum &amp; obligatione opus habentem:
&amp; non quotidie occultis iaculis sauciari ab improbitate quae a diabolo
ipsi infertur. Sic noui
                           •
                         Ecclesia praedicare. Haec sunt
sanationis medicamenta. Therefore it is better to haue
one sinne and not many. It is better for him whiche
is fallen from his course, openly to take him a wife,
according to the lawe, and to repent long time from
his virginitie, and so to bee brought againe vnto the
Church, as one that hath wrought euill, as one that is
fallen and broken, and hauing neede of binding vp,
and not to be daily wounded with secret dartes, which

of the deuill are caste against him. So knoweth the
Churche to preach, those be the medicines of healing.
               
               Saint Hierome ad Demetriadem writeth thus. 
                     Sanctum
virginum propositum &amp; Coelestis angelorum
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         familiae
gloriam, quarundam non bene se agentium nomen infamat.
Quibus aperte dicendum est, vt aut nubant si se non possunt
continere, aut contineant si nolunt nubere. The report of
some that behaue not themselues wel, slaundereth the
holy purpose of virgines, and the glorie of the heauenly
and Angelical familie. To whome it must be said
openly, that either they should marrie, if they can not
conteine, or else they should conteine, if they wil not
marrie. Wherfore by these two doctors iudgment, our
doctrine differeth not from the doctrine of the primitiue
Churche, within the sixe hundreth yeares after
Christe.

Of houseling before death, Of reseruation of the sacrament.

               The sixteenth difference is prayer for the dead,Fulke. with
dirige, and Masse in the morning, the fortification
thereof he leaueth, because it is done sufficiently by another,
he meaneth Maister Allen of purgatory, and
for the assault and battery of that peece, I also referre
the reader to my ouerthrowe of the same defence.
               The seuenteenth difference is solemnitie of Christian
buriall, which is vsed and allowed of vs so farre
as it is without superstition He alledgeth that Paulious
did write to Saint Augustine, from the sea
coastes of Italy to the sea costes of Affrica, to be fully

instructed, whether the holines of the place any thing
auayled the buriall of the body, &amp;c. But why did not
he send nearer home, to the Apostolike see of Rome,
the Pope whereof (or else you lye) can not erre? For
Augustine was not able to resolue him, who although
he suppose this benefite there may be, that the friends
of the body buried neare a martirs tombe, may be occasioned
thereby in remembring the place of his buriall,
to commend his soule to that Martyr, yet he can
not tell how the Saintes departed should know the requestes
of them that liue. Cap. 16. lib. De cura pro mortuis:
and except this occasion of praying for their soules,
he knoweth not what the holinesse of the place can
helpe them, wherein he differeth from Papistes,Cap. 2. that
thinke it a great matter of it selfe, to be buried in a
holy place, which of them for that purpose is exorcised
and hallowed.
               The 18. difference is: Houseling before death, which the sacramentaries
make to be of no necessitie, because they binde the
sinner to a number of other communicantes. If it be a matter
of necessitie, how is it with all infantes, how with many
that die sodenly, &amp;c. are all such damned? But he
sayeth, the practise of the primitiue Church proueth it
to be necessary, as in the example of Serapion Euseb.
lib, 6. cap. 44. and of Satyrus Saint Ambroses brother
In obitum Satyri, &amp;c. And is it euen so? Doeth the example
of one man that was excommunicated, and
could not be quiet vntill he had receiued the communion,
and of an other that neuer receiued it, nor was
baptised, prooue it necessary for all men? Yea (saith
Stapleton) who will reade onely but one Canon of the Nicene
councell, shal finde therein not only a generall commandement
for al Christendome, but also the auncient practise of the Church
before that time. And I say who so will reade not only
the whole Canon, but the very title thereof, shall
finde, that it was a remission only for excommunicated
persons. C

tradendo eis Communionem, &amp; cura &amp; probatio sit episcopi.
But concerning them which depart out of this bodye,
the rule of the auncient lawe shalbe obserued euen
nowe also, so that if perhaps any depart out of ye body,
he may not be defrauded of the necessary prouision
of his life. But if any being at the point of death
after he haue receiued the Communion, do recouer &amp;
liue, let him be among them that communicate in
prayer onely. Neuerthelesse, concerning all those
men that depart out of ye body, in deliuering to them
the communion, let both the charge and the tryal be
in the bishops discretion.
               
               This Canon was not made for all Christian men,
that at times of publike administration of the sacraments
might freely be partakers, but onely of such
as were excommunicated &amp; appointed a time of penance
for their tryall, before they should be admitted
to the Lordes supper: before which time, if they were
at the point of death, and the bishop allowed of their
repentance, this Canon prouideth, that they might
be receiued to the Communion, for their comfort:
but yet so; that if any did recouer and liue, they shuld
accomplish their time among the penitentes that was
before enioyned them. This thing being so apparant,
what shall wee saye of these English Louanistes, that
either they neuer read the bookes out of which they
cite their authorities, or else without all shame they
wrest them against their owne conscience?
               The 19. difference, is the reseruation of the sacrament,
wherein, as I confesse in some erronious kinde
of reseruation wee differ from some of the primitiue
Church, so they differed from Christ, which cōmaunded
it to be eaten and dronken. And it is manifest, yt
                  
their reseruation differed from the popish reseruation,
both in the manner and in the ende. But concerning
reseruation, I referre the reader to mine answere
to D. Heskins first booke Cap. 24. 25. 26. &amp; 27. where
you shall finde all his authorities discussed, except the
14. Canon of the Councell of Nice, out of which hee
alledgeth, that the Deacons might, 
                     absente Episcopo &amp;
presbitero proferre communionem &amp; comedere. In the absence
of the Bishop and priest, take out the communion
and receiue it. Whereby he sayeth, it is euident, that
it was reserued in the Churches, where the Deacons might
come to receiue it.
                   But I must admonish the reader, yt
these wordes which he citeth are an addition of Gratian
and the popish church, and are not in the true copies
in Greeke of that Councell, nor in the right Latine
translation, as euen Peter Crabb the Papist confesseth,
nor yet in the edition of Ruffinus. But such
draffe and dregges of falsifications, additions, detractions,
mutations, &amp;c. are good ynough for popishe
swyne.
               The 20. difference is blessing with the signe of the
Crosse: for fortification of which piece, he referreth
the reader to Martials treatise of the Crosse. And I to
M. Calfhils Aunswere, and my Reioynder.
               The 21. difference is benediction of the bishop,
which he sayeth is mocked at and reuiled by Protestantes.
But he sayeth vntruely: for although wee
may iustly deride the vaine ceremoniall casting of
crosses in the ayre of their bitesheepes rather then bishops,
with their two fingers, which is nothing else
but a ridiculous superstition, yet wee contemne not
the godly benediction of a Christian Bishop and pastour,
which vseth the same according to the word of
God. Therefore the examples of Nectarius which
desired the benediction of his Bishop Diodorus at his
departure, and Aurelius which blessed Augustine and
his company, after he had visited them, shewe no difference
of them from vs. And if Eudo
                     •
                  ia the Empresse

desired Chrisostome to blesse her sonne Theodosius
his godson. What did Chrysostome but pray for him,
and with him well in the name of the Lorde? And
how did Diodorus blesse Nectarius? And Aurelius
blesse Augustine and the rest, but by godly prayer
made to God for them? not with vaine, dombe &amp; idle
ceremonies after the Popish manner. So that the manner
of blessing of the auncient times, doeth rather
proue a difference of Papistes from them, then of vs
from them. And moreouer you may consider, how
to make vp a number of differences, what small matters
he is fayne to flye vnto, and euen such as he hath
no shewe of holde at all in the writers of the auncient
Church of 600. yeares after Christ, for them.
But onely to set a face of the matter, as though there
were nothing newe amongest them, when not onely
their ceremonies, but also many of the principall articles
of their doctrine, wherein they differ from vs,
were either not heard of in those ages, or else were
openly impugned by writers of those times. Onely
the dregges and refuse of the former age they retayne,
as prayer for the deade, inuocation of Saintes,
and a fewe other such matters.
            
            
               CAP. VII.
               Of pilgrimage and reliques,Stapleton. of Church seruice, of Altars,
of Church ornaments &amp; holy vessels, of the ecclesiasticall 
                     •
                  onsure,
and of holy water.
               The 22. difference is pilgrimage to holy places,Fulke.
especially to Rome. In deede we finde that peregrination
to Ierusalem was esteemed of many, and great
resort to Rome, of the wiser sort not for the holinesse
of the places, but for the frequence of godly &amp; learned
men then liuing in those places. Otherwise for
the holynesse of the place, S. Hierom ad Paulinum,
whether M. Sapleton sendeth vs, doth sufficiently declare

what was to be esteemed of it. 
                     Non Hierosolymis
fuisse, sed Hierosolymis bene vixisse laudandum est. It is
no praise to haue beene at Hierusalem, but to haue
liued well at Hierusalem. And speaking euen of our
owne countrye, he addeth. 
                     Et de Hierosolymis &amp; de Britannia
aequaliter patet aula coelestis. The court of heauen
is open equally, from Ierusalem and from Britain. Againe:
Beatus Hilarion cùm Palestinus esset &amp; in Palestina
viueret, vno tantùm die vidit Hierosolimam, vt nec contemnere
loca sancta propter vicinitatem, nec rursus dominum loco
claudere videretur. Blessed Hilarion when he was
a Palestine borne, and liued in Palestine, sawe Ierusalem
but one day only, that neither he might seeme
to contemne the holy places because of neerenesse,
nor againe to shut vp the Lorde in a place. And because
Master Stapleton maketh pilgrimage a matter
of faith, he sayth further: After hee hath shewed how
many excellent men neuer came at Ierusalem, &amp;c.

                     Quorsum inquies haec tam longo repetita principio? Videlicet
ne quicquam fidei tuae deesse putes, quia Hierosolymam non vidisti.
Thou wilt say, to what ende are these thinges
fetched from so long a beginning? verely, that thou
shouldest not thinke any thing to be wanting to thy
faith, because thou hast not seene Ierusalem. Thus
Hierome, albeit it was much vsed, yet iudged peregrination
vnto Ierusalem, to be a matter of small
importance.
               By Chrysostom sayeth, Hom. 5. de beato Iob: that
if strength of body did serue, &amp; that he were not letted
with the charge of his Church, he would haue trauelled
to Rome, to see the cheines wherewith Saint
Paul was bound. And this Stapleton wil warrant, to
haue beene done without superstition. I would faine
knowe howe he will discharge this saying of his in
the same homely, eyther of superstition, or of an
excessiue commendation. 
                     Si quis me coelo condonet omni,
vel ea qua pauli manus vinciebatur catena, illam ego
honore praeponerem. If any man coulde giue mee all

heauen, or else that chayne, wherewith Saint Paules
hande was bounde, I woulde preferre that chaine in
honour. Excuse this if you can, so it be not with a
rethoricall exornation, for ye you cannot abyde. Neuerthelesse,
the same Chrisostom sheweth, yt it was not
needefull for obtaining remissiō of finnes, to take in
hande any pilgrimage. 
                     In Epist. ad Phil. Hom. Non opus
est in longinqua peregrinando transire, nec ad remotissimas ire
nationes, non pericula, non labores tolerare, sed velle tantummodo.
There is no neede to go a pilgrimage into
farre countryes, nor to go to the furthest nations, nor
to suffer perils nor trauels, but onely to be willing.
Now let the wisedome of the Papistes take heede, as
he admonisheth the wisdome of the Protestantes, that
they charge not Chrysostome with the heresie of sola
fides, or licentious libertie, more then wee checke him
for superstition. The like of remission of sinnes,
without pilgrimage, he sayeth: Hom. de. Anima &amp; educatione
Samuelis, which is as contrary to y• draffe of popish
pilgrimage, as the peregrination vsed in this day
is out of vse with vs. For Papists were wont to make
pilgrimage a meritorious worke, and many had it in
penance persuaded by their ghostly father, they could
not otherwise haue remission of their sinnes, except
perhaps by a Popes pardon, with a commutation of
penance. Concerning the place of Augustine, which
he citeth Ep. 137. It proueth no ordinary pilgrimage
then in vse, but onely sheweth Augustines deuise in
a case of such doubt, as he coulde not finde out the
trueth betweene one that was accused and his accuser,
that it was not amisse they shuld both trauell to some
such place, where miracles are sayed to be wrought, if
happely there in such place, the trueth might be reuealed
by miracle.
               And yet I confesse not vrged by any thing Stapleton
sayth, that Augustine else where speaketh of peregrination
to Rome in Psal. 85. 
                     Quales isti principes
venerunt de Babylone? Principes credentes de saeculo,

principes venerunt ad vrbem Roman, quasi caput Babylonis,
non ierunt ad templum imperatoris, sed ad memoriam piscatoris.
What are these princes that came from Babylon?
Princes of the world that beleeue, the princes came to
Rome, as to the head of Babylon, they went not to the
temple of the Emperour, but to the memorie of a Fisher.
               
               To conclude, as there was vsed Peregrination to Ierusalem,
and other places to the memories of Martyrs,
so was there neuer any pilgrimage to images, which is
the greatest pilgrimage of Papistes, within the 600.
yeres mentioned, wherein Papists differ as much from
their practise, as we, and more also.
               The 23. difference is the reuerence of reliques, vsed
within the 600. yeres, as witnesseth Basil, Chrysostome
and other. The reliques or bodyes of the Saints we reuerence,
so farre as we haue any warrant out of the holy
Scriptures. Neither did those auncient fathers, (although
immoderate in that kinde of reuerence) yet
make idols of them, nor set them bare to be seene or
handled, and worshipped, but laide vp in the earth, as
I haue before shewed out of Cyrillus: Lib. 10. Contra Iulianum.
But what inconuenience grewe by that excessiue
esteeming of the dead bodyes of the Saints, Sozomenus
sheweth 
                     Li. 7. ca. 10. Pauli Constantinopolitani Episcopi
corpus in Ecclesia repositum est, id quod &amp; multos veritatis
ignaros, praesertim mulieres, ac plures è plebe, in eam opinionem
induxit, vt Apostolum Paulum ibi conditum esse putent.
The body of Paul, Bishop of Constantinople, was buried
in the Church, which thing brought many ignorant
of the trueth, especially women, and many of the
common people into this opinion, that they thinke
the Apostle Paul to be buried there. But whereas in the
end he wold haue vs restore so many holy reliques of
Abbeyes and Churches, as haue bene spoiled and prophaned,
it is needlesse, seeing the Papistes can make as
many when they list. Euen by the same cunning that
they make some of the Apostles to haue two or three

bodyes a piece, beside heades, armes, ribbes, and other
partes in infinite places, whereof he that will heare
more, let him reade Caluines booke of reliques, and
credite him but as a reporter of that, which all the
world is able to reproue him of, if he would wilfully
feigne any thing.
               The 24. difference is Alters, for proofe whereof he
bringeth Chrysostome, and Augustine, which speake
of Alters, whome also he confesseth to call the same
tables, but that neither in matter nor fourme, they
were like Popish Alters, but tables in deede made of
boordes, and remoueable, and standing in the middest
of the Church, I haue shewed sufficiently in mine aunswere
to Doctor Heskins, lib. 3. cap. 31. by which it is
proued, that the Papistes and not we, differ from the
primitiue Church in this point.
               The 25. difference is Latine seruice, which he would
proue out of Bede by the bookes that Gregorie sent to
Augustine, which could be none other but Latine. But howe
proue you that those bookes were seruice bookes?
or that if they were seruice bookes, thei were not translated
into the vulgare tongue? As for the fortification
of this piece, by the elder times he referreth vs to
Doctor Hardings proofe against Master Iewels challenge.
And to the same Bishops learned replie, doe I
referre the reader for ouerthrowe of the same feeble
fortresse of Harding.
               The 26. difference is of Alter clothes, Church vestments,
&amp;c. Such Alter clothes and such vestments as
Christ vsed in the celebration of the holy sacrament,
we thinke not onely to be sufficient, but also most
conuenient, for the administration of the same. Neuertheles,
if any other vestments, without superstitiō,
be appointed by lawful authoritie, we thinke no strife
or contention is to be raised for so small matters.
               But let vs see, of what antiquitie he will make the
holy vestments. First Tertullian Lib. de Monogam, maketh
mention of Infulas, the vpper garment of the

Priest. But he might vnderstand Tertullian (if he
were disposed) to vse that terme but in derision of
them, that when they would be proude against the
Cleargie, they alledged, that we are all Priestes, &amp;c.
but when we are called (saide he) to the same seueritie
of discipline with the Cleargie, deponimus infulas &amp;
pares sumus, we put off our Rochets, and we be priuate
men. This infula was the apparell of the Heathen
Priestes, to which he alludeth, when he scoffeth at
them, that in dignitie would be Priestes, but in discipline
Lay men. The Albe which is spoken of Con.
Carthag. 4. Can. 41. was nothing like your Popish Albe,
but a white garment, which was vsed in signe of
dignitie, and was forbidden of the Deacons to be
worne, but onely in time of the oblation and reading
Saint Iohns Petalum, if he could tell what to make of
it, he would not call it generally a pontificall vestment.
Saint Iohn was a poore Pontifex, to goe in
pontificalibus. The rich garment which Constantine
gaue to the Church of Ierusalem, if it had bene a cope,
(as he saith) it had bene an vnhandsome garment to
daunce in, as the storie saith, it came into the handes
of one that daunced in it. The admonition that he
giueth to such as sleepe in Church goodes, meaning
belike, such as haue their beddes garnished with olde
copes, were more meete to be made to some of his benefactours,
that sleepe in Abbeyes, and yet will not
awake out of them.
               To conclude, although there is some mention of
garmentes, applied specially for the vse of diuine seruice,
yet the Popish tragicall trumperie of this time,
differeth as much from them in forme and vse, as they
doe in time and age.
               The 27. difference is of holy vessels: such vessels as
are comely and decent for the ministration of the sacraments,
we haue without superstition, which beginning
to growe in the auncient times, the Fathers did
rather reproue then foster.

Gregorie Nazianzen, whome he citeth in his Oration
aduers. Arrianos, &amp; de se ipso, speaking of the ministring
vessels that might not be touched of many, meaneth
Allegorically of prophaning the mysteries of Christian
religion, alluding to the prophanation of the vessels
of the Iewish temple by Nabuzardan and Balthasar,
as his words doe plainely shewe. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
&amp;c. What ministring vessels not be touched of many,
haue I deliuered to the handes of the wicked, either
to Nabuzardan, or to Balthasar, which rioted wickedly
in holy things, and suffred punishment worthie
of his madnesse.
               Chrysostome reproued the preposterous superstition
of the people, which durst not touch the holy vessels,
but yet feared not to defile them selues with sinne,

                     In ep. ad Eph. H. 14. Non vides, &amp;c. Doest thou not see,
those holy vessels? Be they not alwaies vsed to one purpose?
Dare any man vse them to any other purpose?
Nowe art thou thy selfe more holy then these vessels,
and that by much. Why then doest thou pollute and
defile thy selfe? He hath forgotten Exuperius Bishop
of Tholosse, which caried the Lordes body in a wicker
basket, and his bloud in a glasse, when he maketh so
much adoe about holy vessels. Hier. ad Rusticum, Acacius
Bishop of Amida is commended for melting the vessels
of the Church of golde and siluer, to redeeme prisoners
from the Persians.
               The 28. difference, is the shauen crown
                     •
                   of Priestes,
for antiquitie whereof, he citeth Eusebius in Panegyric.
                  
                     Vos amici Dei sacerdotes lōgae talari veste &amp; corona insignes.
Ye friends of God, ye Priests seemly by your long
side garment and crowne. Verily he is worthy to be
shorne on his poll, with a number of crownes, that vnderstandeth
this of a shauen crowne. If nothing else
could haue driuen him from this dreame, at least he
should haue remēbred the solemne disputation whereof
he spake immediately before in Beda, li. 5. ca. 22. by

which it appeareth, that y• Greekes were shorne square,
and not round, and therefore Eusebius speaking to
Greeke Priestes, would neuer haue called their square
tonsure a crowne. But the wordes of Eusebius put all
out of doubt. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
&amp;c. O ye friendes and
Priestes of God, which are clothed with the holy long
garment, and the heauenly crowne of glorie, and with
the diuine vnction and the priestly robe of the holy
Ghost, &amp;c. Is there any blocke so senselesse, to thinke
that he called a shauen head the heauenly crowne of
glorie? Who seeth not, that in commendation of the
spirituall dignitie of the Ministers of the Church, he
alludeth to the Aaronicall attire of the Priestes of the
lawe?
               The next testimonie is out of the tripartite historie,
that Iulian the Apostata to counterfet religion, shore
him selfe to the hard eares, therefore religious men
were then shorne There is no doubt, but the Cleargie,
and such as professed sobrietie and modestie, vsed to
poll their heades, whereas the licentious multitude delighted
in long haires, which shearing or polling after
grewe to a ceremonie, &amp; from a ceremonie to a superstition:
but small mention of the ceremonie there is,
within the 600. yeares, and that toward the latter end
of them. But where he compareth the scoffing that the
Turke might make at the blessed passion of Christe,
with such pleasant railing as Protestantes vse against
their Friers coules, and shauen crownes, he sheweth in
what blasphemous estimation he hath such vile dung
of mens inuention, to compare it with the onely price
of our saluation.
               The 29. differēce is holy water, for antiquitie wherof
he alledgeth two myracles, the one out of Bede, li.
1. cap. 17. of Germanus, which with casting a fewe sprinkles
of water into the sea, in the name of the Trinitie,
assuaged a tempest. The other of Marcellus Bishop of

Apamea, which when the temple of Iupiter could not
be burned with fire, after praiers made, commaunded
water signed with the crosse, to be sprinkled on the
Alter, which done, the diuels departed, and the temple
was set on fire, &amp; burned. But these miracles wrought
by water, proue not an ordinarie vse of holy water in
the Church, in those times, as for the counterfet decree
of Alexander the fift Bishop of Rome, is a worthie witnesse
of such a worshipfull ceremonie. In the end of
this chapter, he inueigheth against a newe tricke, which
he saith, y• preachers haue to make their audience cry,
Amen. Cōparing it with the applause and clapping of
handes, vsed in the olde time, but misliked of godly fathers,
Chrysostome and Hierome. So that for the preacher
to pray to God, an
                     •
                   to giue God thankes, whereto
the people aunswereth 
                     ••
                  en, it is counted of Stapleton
a newe tricke, and yet it is an auncient, as S. Paul
1. Cor. 14. vers. 16. But to make such a loude lye, that
Sathan him selfe the father of lyes (I suppose) for his
credites sake would be ashamed to make, in his owne
person. Videlicet, that To teares, to lamenting or to bewayling
of their sinnes, no Protestant yet moueth his audience. It is an
olde trickes of a cankared stomaked Papist.
            
            
               CAP. VIII.
               Differences betweene the former faith of Catholikes,Stapleton.
and the late newes of Protestants, concerning the gouernement and rulers
of the Church.
               The 30. difference is Synodes of the Cleargie,Fulke. which
is a lewd and impudent slaunder, for we allowe them,
and vse them, as all the world knoweth: but (saith he)
no conclusion is made in them, but such as pleaseth
the Parleament. This is a false lye, for although no
constitution made in the conuocation, hath the force
of a lawe, except it be confirmed by Parleament, yet
many constitutions and Canons haue bene made, that

were neuer confirmed by Parleament.
               The 31. difference is imposition of handes, which is a
meere slaunder, for that cerimonie is vsed of vs in ordeining
of Ministers, likewise where he saith, that whē
all the Popish Bishops were deposed, there was none
to lay handes on the Bishops that should be newely
consecrated, it is vtterly false. For there was one of the
Popish Bishops that continued in his place, there were
also diuers that were consecrated Bishops in King Edwardes
time, and although there had bene but one in
that time of reformation, it had been sufficient by his
owne Gregories resolution, Bed. lib. 1. cap. 27. An other
example is Lib. 3. cap. 28. of Ceadda Archbishop of
Yorke, consecrated by Wini Bishop of the West Saxons
assisted by two Bryton Bishops, that were not subiect
to the see of Rome: Bicause at that time, there
was neuer a Bishop of the Romish faction in England
but this Wini, who was also a Simoniake, and bought
the Bishoprike of London for money. I speake not
this, as though in planting of the Church, where it
hath bene long time exiled, an extraordinarie forme
of ordaining were not sufficient, but to shewe that the
Papistes doe picke quarels, contrarie to their owne
pretended recordes of antiquitie, and Catholike religion.
               Where he inueigheth against the vnsufficiencie of
a number of our Ministers, which are come out of the
shop into the Cleargie, without giftes sufficient for
that calling, as I can not excuse them, nor their ordeiners,
so I dare be bolde to affirme, they are no worse
either in knowledge or conuersation, then the huge
rable of hedge Priestes of Poperie.
               The 32. difference, that such Bishops as were created
by the Archbishops of Canterburie and Yorke, were
created by the appointment of the Pope. This is a
shamelesse lye, for which he can bring no colour, either
out of the first sixe hundreth yeares, or out of
Bedes historie. Where he saith, If it can be shewed by any

historie, that at any time by the meere temporall authoritie
euer any Catholike Bishops were created, he d
                        •
                     re yelde and
graunt that ours are lawfull Bishops. For aunswere, that
Catholike Bishops of olde by as meere temporall authoritie
were created, as any are created among vs, I
referre him to Bede lib. 3. cap. 7. &amp; 29. lib. 4. cap. 23.
of Agilbert and Wini by authoritie of Sonwalch,
Wighard nominated by authoritie of Oswine and Egbert,
Ostfor consecrated at the commaundement of
king Edilred, beside Wini made Bishop of London for
money by Wulfher king of Mercia, which authoritie
he could not haue abused, except it had bene in him
lawfully to vse.
               The 33. difference is, that Princes had not the supreme
gouernement in ecclesiastical causes. For proofe
whereof, he alledgeth Gregorie Nazianzen, and Saint
Ambrose, both which speake not of chiefe authoritie,
but of knowledge of spirituall matters, which is not
to be sought ordinarily in Princes, but in the Cleargie.
Secondly, he citeth Caluine and Illyricus, which
do write against such ciuill Magistrates, as thinke by
their supremacie, they haue absolute authoritie to decree
what they wil in ye Church, wheras we in England
neuer attribute so much to the Princes authoritie, but
that we alwayes acknowledge it to be subiect to God
and his word. The Papistes right well vnderstand this
distinction, but it pleaseth them to vse this ambiguitie
of supreme authoritie, to abuse the ignorance of the
simple.
               The 34. difference is, that the Bishops and godly
men in matters of doubt counselled with the Pope of
Rome, so did the Pope of Rome with them, while there
was any modestie in him, so did Pope Sergius aske
counsel of poore Beda. Math. West. Nay, but Saint
Hierome so well learned, consulted with Pope Damasus,
which entred his See with the slaughter of sixtie
persons. I might aunswere, that Damasus also asked
counsell of Saint Hierome. So that in him which is

consulted, there is rather opinion of knowledge, then
of authoritie. But Hierome confesseth, that he will
not separate him selfe from the Church of Rome, &amp;c.
Ep. ad. Dam. 2. So long as the Church of Rome was
the Church of Christ, there was great cause he should
ioyne with it. But nowe is it ceased to be the spouse
of Christ, and is become an adulteresse, as the prophete
saith of Ierusalem, yea it is become Babylon, the mother
of all abhominations, and therefore that heauenly
voice commaundeth all Christians to depart out of
her. But concerning the Popes authoritie, I haue
aunswered at large to D. Sanders rocke of the Popish
Church.
               The 35. difference, but I knowe not howe it differeth,
is the Popes authoritie abolished, by whom Christianitie
was first in this land receiued. It is wel known,
that there was Christianitie before Gregorie sent Augustine,
not of Popelike authoritie, but of godly zeale
as it seemeth to winne the English nation to Christe.
After followeth a large complaint, for abolishing the
Popes authoritie, a Canon inuectiue against discentions
among vs, and slight fortification of the Popes authoritie,
for vnities sake, out of Hierome Cont. Iouinian.
&amp; Cyprian de simpl. prael. aunswered at large in the discouerie
of D. Sanders Rocke.
               The 36. difference, Augustine came first in presence
of the king, with a crosse of siluer, and an image
of Christ painted in a table. The Protestants beganne
with taking away the crosse, and altering the Letanie.
But this part is left vnfortified, except it be with a marginall
note, that Chrysostome vsed in Letanies, crosses
of siluer, and burning tapers. In deede I reade Chrysostome
had certaine candlestickes or cressets of siluer,
made in fourme of a crosse, to carie lightes vpon them,
in the night season, but not of any tapers burning by
day, &amp; caried before the crucifixe after the Popish maner.
Socr li. 6. ca. 8. but hereof ye may see more in mine
aunswere to Martials replie. Articl. 7.
               
                  
                  The 37. difference Augustine and his companie to the number
of fourtie were Monkes. The first preachers of this no faith
were runagate Monkes and Apostate Friers. Their learning,
godlinesse, and iust cause of departing out of those
Cloysters of vncleane birdes, is sufficiently testified
to the world.
               The 38. difference, the preachers which were traded vp by
them, were of a vertuous, lowly, simple, poore, and meeke conuersation.
Then were they very vnlike your Popish prelates.
But Luther complaineth, that his schollers
were more wicked, then vnder the pope. If some were
so, it followeth not that all are so. Againe, Beza solde
his benefice to two men, if he had no confessed it him
selfe, Stapleton might neuer haue knowne of it. Afterward
he raised rebellion for a signe of his vocation,
and persuaded Poltrot to murther the Duke of Guise,
or else Stapleton belyeth him. What Mallot and
Pieroreli were I knowe not, I doubt not, but they
were honester then many Popes haue bene. Knokes was a
Galley slaue three yeares. The more wicked those Papistes
which betrayed him into the Galley. The master
whereof was glad to be rid of him, bicause he neuer
had good successe, so long as he kept that holy
man in slauerie, whome also in daunger of tempest,
though an errant Papist, he would desire to commend
him and his Galley to God in his praiers. The eiection
of the Nobles from Zuicherland, is as truely imputed
to the Zuinglians by your authour Staphylus,
as al the rest of his slaunders and monstrous lyes are
to be credited, which was done by the Papistes in that
countrie, almost two hundreth yeares before Zuinglius
was borne. Christerne King of Denmarke, was
expelled his realme for his tyrannie, by all the states,
before they receiued the Gospell. Howe dutifull the
doing of the Protestants in Fraunce hath bene, let the
kinges owne actes of Pacification testifie, which alwayes
dischargeth them of rebellion, and acknowledgeth
all that they haue done, to haue bene done

in his seruice.
               The 39. difference, voluntarie pouertie in Augustine not
found in the first planters of this newe trim tram. A matter
worthie to be aunswered with a whim wham. It were
easie to shewe howe many haue forsaken great dignities
and liuings among the Papistes, to become poore
preachers of the Gospell.
            
            
               CAP. X.
               Differences concerning the consequences and effectes of the
first faith planted among vs,Stapleton. and of the pretensed faith of Protestantes.
               
                  The 40. difference, they that were conuerted,
                  Fulke. 
                  builded Churches
and Monasteries, Protestants pull downe Monasteries,
Churches, Chappels, Hospitals, and Almes houses, In the table
of differences, I haue shewed, howe much those Monasteries
then builded, differed from Popish Abbeyes:
&amp; where he chargeth Protestants with pulling downe
all Monasteries, he forgetteth that Cardinall Wolsee
by the Popes authoritie pulled downe the first in our
time that were suppressed, and that the Popish Cleargie
consented to the acte of suppression, which were
ye diuell rather then Protestants. For Hospitals and Almes
houses, it is a slaunder, except some priuate person
of couetousnesse hath ouerthrowne any. As for Churches
and Chappels builded by vs, so many as are necessarie,
it is apparant to the world. Almes houses and
Hospitalls by vs are erected, such as are none in Poperie.
The Vniuersities also are augmented, both in
buildings and reuenues, since the pulling downe of
Abbeyes.
               The 41. difference, in Monasteries, God God was serued
day and might with externall prayer at midnight. Although
rising at midnight ordinarily be an inconuenient
houre in many respectes, and therefore we haue no ordinarie
praier at that time, yet haue we earely in the

morning before it be day, in many places, exercise of
prayer and preaching, neither was it at midnight that
the nunnes of Berking sung their Lawdes &amp; Hymnes.
lib. 4. cap. 7. for it was after Matutines, which could not
be but in the morning, although early, &amp; before day.
               The 42. the deuotion of those christians brought in voluntary
oblations, which are now ceased, and due tithes grudged as.
               The voluntary oblations of the godly, are not now
wanting, where neede is.
               
                  The 43. the Princes &amp; higher power endewed the bishopriks
with landes, now they take them away. It was necessary when
they had none before, but were newly erected. If any
be now taken away, and sufficient left, it is not the matter
we regarde, but good proceeding of the Gospell: if
couetousnesse of any man procure from the Churche,
where it wanteth, they shall answere it and not we.
               
                  The 44. Ethelbert established Christianitie by lawes. Making
special statutes and decrees for the indemnitie and quiet possession
of the Churche goodes and of the Cleargie. Now no state is
more open to the oppression then the Cleargie. If Ethelbert
established Christianitie, by lawes, he did more then
Papistes would haue Princes to doe nowe. But if the
Cleargie be nowe oppressed, it is not for want of good
lawes, or good will in the prince &amp; higher powers
to defende it, but by occasion of a number of dissembling
Papistes, to whome execution of iustice in some
places is committed.
               
                  The 45. difference is vnitie them, where is discention now.
God be praysed, we consent in all articles necessary to
eternall saluation, and if the Scottes by our example
are come to the same vnity of faith with vs, it is the
Lordes worke, for whom we giue him harty thanks.
               The conclusion of this fantasticall Fortresse is an
exhortation to Papistes, not to dissemble their Papistry,
nor to communicate with vs, disswading them
by many examples of such as yeelded not to the persecution
of the Arrian heretikes.
               But seeing by the worde God, we can not be conuinced

of heresie, those examples make nothing aagainst
vs.
               And yet I wishe the Papistes (if it be not Gods will
to open their eyes that they may see the truth) yet to
giue ouer their dissembling, and openly to shew them
selues as they are. For whether their religion be
good or badde, dissembling and counterfetting
can not be
but euil.
               God be praysed.
            
         
         
            
            
            A REIOYNDER TO Iohn Martials reply against the answere of Maister Calfhill,
to the blasphemous treatise of the Crosse.
            By W. Fulke D. in diuinitie.
            
               To the Reader.
               
                  OF all the treatises sent ouer within
these twentie yeares from the Papists,
there is none in which appeareth lesse
learning and modesty, nor greater arrogance
and impudencie, then in this
one Booke of Martiall. Who, as he
tearmeth him selfe a Bacheler of Lawe, so more like a
wrangling petty fogger in the Lawe, then a sober Student
in Diuinitie, doth in a manner nothing else, but
cauil, quarel, and scolde. Which as it were an easie
matter to wype away with a sharpe answere, for him
that would bestowe his time therein: so I thinke it
for my parte neither needefull nor profitable. The
memory of that godly learned man Maister Doctor
Calfhill whome he abuseth, is written in the Booke of
the righteous, and shall not be afraide of any slaunderers
reporte. Omitting therefore all friuolous quarels,
I will onely endeuour to answere that whiche
hath in it any shewe of reason or argument to defende
the idolatry of the Papistes.
               In which matter also, as many thinges are the same
which are already satisfied in my confutation of Doctor
Sanders Booke of Images: so I will referre the
reader to those Chapters of that treatise, where he shal

finde y• which I hope shal suffice, for the ouerthrowe of
Idolatry. This reply, as the first treatise, is diuided into
ten articles, all which in order I will set downe, with
such titles, as he giueth vnto them. But first I must
say a fewe wordes concerning his request made to
the Bishop of London, and the rest of the superintendentes
of the newe Church, as it pleaseth him to call
them, and his preface to the reader. His request is, that
the Bishops should certifie him by some pamphlete
in printe, whether 61. articles which he hath gathered
out of Maister Calfhils booke, be the receyued
and approoued doctrine of the newe Churche of England,
able to be iustified by the worde of God, and the
Fathers, and Councels within sixe hundreth yeares
after Christ? How wise a man he is, in making this
request, I leaue to reasonable men to iudge.
               And touching the articles themselues, I aunswere,
that some of them be such, as the Church of England
doth holde and openly professe, as that Latine seruice,
Monkish vowes, the communion in one kinde, &amp;c. are
contrary to Gods worde, the other be particular affirmatiōs
of Maister Calfhil, which in such sense as he vttered
them, may be iustified for true, and yet perteyne
not to the whole Church to mainteine and defende, as
whether Helaena were superstitious in seeking ye crosse
at Ierusalem, whether Dionyse and Fabian were the
one suspected, the other infamed, &amp;c. beside that a
great number of them be so rent from the whole sentences
whereof they were partes, that they reteyne
not the meaning of the author, but serue to shewe the
impudencie of the cauiller. As that the counsels of
Christe in his Gospel, be ordinances of the Deuill, the
prayers of Christians a sacrifice of the deuill, the councell
of Elibeus was a generall councell, &amp;c. Wherfore
I will leaue this fond request, with all the rayling that
followeth there vppon, and come to the preface, to the
Reader. First he findeth himselfe greatly greeued, that
not only ancient fathers are by M. Calfhil discredited,

but also the holy crosse is likened to a gallowes, &amp;c.
which moued him to follow Salomons counsell, &amp; to
answer a foole according to his folly. After this he taketh
vpon him to cōfute M. Calfhils preface, in which
he proueth, yt no images should be in churches to any
vse of religion, because God forbiddeth them, Exo. 20.
&amp; Leuit. 19 in ye first table of religion. His reply standeth
only vpon those common foolishe distinctions of
Idols &amp; Images, of Latria &amp; Doulia, which are handled
more at large &amp; with greater shewe of learning
by D Sander in his booke of Images. Cap. 5. 6. 7. 8. whither
I refer ye reader for answer. Likewise, yt discourse
which he maketh, to proue yt an image of Christ is not
a lying image, is answered in ye same booke, Cap. 7.
The authoritie of Epiphanius, he deferreth to aunswer,
vnto ye 5. article. To Irenaeus he answereth, yt he
only reporteth, yt the Gnostike heretikes had ye image
of Iesus, but reproueth not yt fact. But he reproued
them only because they placed the image of Christ wt
the images of Plato, Pithagoras, &amp;c. vsed them as ye
Gentyles do. This were in deed a pretie exception for
a brabling lawyer to take: but a student in diuinitie
should vnderstand that Irenaeus in yt book &amp; Chapter
li. 1. Ca. 24. declareth no fact of ye heretiks yt was good,
but his declaration is a reproof. And so it is throughout
that whole booke conteining 35. Chapters.
               But he chargeth M. Calfhill for falsifying Augustine,
in sayng, that he alloweth M. Varro affirming
that religion is moste pure without images, first quarreling
at the quotation, which by errour of the Printer
is de ciuitate Dei, lib. 4. Cap. 3. where it should be Cap.
31. a meete quarrell for such a lawyer: secondly
shewing that the Latine is Castius obseruari sine simulachris
religionem, that religion woulde haue beene more purely
kept without Idols or fayned Images: as though there
be anye Images but fayned, and the worde Imago,
euen in their owne Latine translation of the Bible,
is indifferently taken for Idolum and simulachrum,
                  
and that in many places, Deut. 4. ver. 16. 4. Reg. 11. ver.
18, Sapient Cap. 13. &amp; 14. Esai. 40. ver. 18. &amp; 44. ver. 13.
Ezec. 7. vers. 20 where imagines &amp; simulachra are both
placed together Ezech. 16. Ca. 17. Amos. 5. ver. 23. wher
he sayeth, Imaginem idolorum, the image of your Idols:
and many other places declare, that this counterfait
distinction was not obserued, no not of the Latine
interpreter. As for his other logicall quiddity, wherin
he pleaseth him selfe not a little, that religio non suscipit
magis &amp; minus, sheweth that eyther his lawe is
better then his Logike, or else both are not worth a
strawe.
               Further he chargeth M. Calfehill for adding words
which are not founde in Augustine, where images are
placed in temples, in honourable sublimitie, &amp;c. These wordes
are founde in the Ep. 49 ad Deogratias: Cum hiis locantur
sedibus, honorabili sublimitate, vt a praecantibus atque
immolantibꝰ attendantur, when they are placed in these
seates, in honourable sublimitie, that they are looked
vpon by them that praye and offer, &amp;c. But Martiall
looked onely to the quotation, Ps. 36. &amp;113. Yet doeth
not M. Calfhill rehearse the wordes, but the iudgement
of Augustine, from which he doth nothing varie,
except Martiall will cauill at the wordes, images
in temples, where Augustine sayeth: Idola hiis sedibus,
Idoles in these seates, speaking of temples, in which
images were placed. But he speaketh (saith Martiall)
in the Psalmes, against the images of the heathen, and
not of the Christians. Then reade what he writeth
De moribus ecclesiae Catholicae, lib. 1. Cap. 34. &amp; de consensu
Euangelist. lib. 1. Cap. 10. where you shall finde his iudgement
of such images, as were made of Christians, to
be all one with those of the Gentiles. The iudgement
of other doctours, whome he nameth, you shall finde
aunswered in the 14. or 13. Chapter of Master Sanders
booke of Images. That the Iewes had no images in
their temple, he sayth, it is a Iewish and Turkish reason,
to proue that we should haue none. Much like ye
                  
priest that would not beleeue in Christe, if he knewe
that he were a Iewe. So wise he is, to compare the superstition
of the wicked Turkes, with the obseruation
of the lawe by the godly Iewes. Nay, hee is yet
more eloquent, and sheweth that the Protestantes are
like the Turkes, in condemning of images, in allowing
marriage after deuorce, &amp;c. as though we might
not acknowledge one God, lest we should be like the
Turkes and Iewes, nor honour vertue, nor dispraise
vice, because they do so, nor obey magistrates, nor
eat and drinke, because the Turkes and Iewes doe so.
O deepe learning of a lawyer diuine.
               That Images do not teach, he sayeth it is a position
more boldly aduouched, then wisely proued, &amp; then
quoteth Gregorie, Ep. 9. lib. 9. &amp;c. but he is deceiued, if
he thinke we holde, that images teach not: for we affirme
with the Prophet Abacuc, that they teache lyes,
Cap. 2. ver. 18. &amp; vanitie, Ier. 10. ver. 8.
               As for the story of Amadis the Goldsmith, and the
Epistle of Eleutherius fetched out of the guild hall in
London, as M. Calfhill maketh no great accompt of
them, so I passe them ouer, although Martiall would
haue men thinke, they be the strongest arguments the
Protestants haue, against the superstition of the crosse
and the vsurped tyrannie of the Pope.
               Finally, the excuse he maketh of his railing, by M.
Calfhils example, how honest it is, I referre to wise
men to consider. If M. Calfhill had passed the bondes
of modestie, it were small praise in Martiall to follow
him, yea, to passe him. But if M. Calfhill (as indifferent
men
                     •

termes of 
                     •
                  eate against Martials person, whatsoeuer
he hath spoken against his heresies, the continuall
scorning, both of M. Calfhils name and his person,
vsed so often in euery leafe of his reply, in the iudgement
of all reasonable persons, will cause Martiall to
be taken for a lawlesse wrangler, rather then a sober
and Christian lawyer.
            
            
               
               The first Article.
               This article hath no title, and in effect it hath no
matter.Fulke. For 13. leaues are spent about a needelesse &amp;
impertinent controuersie, of the Authoritie of ye holy
Scriptures, and of the Church of God, whereof the
one is the rule of faith, the other is the thing ruled
and directed thereby. Nowe whether ought to bee
ye Iudge, the rule, or the thing ruled, is the question.
The rule say wee, as the lawe: the Church, sayeth he,
as the Iusticier. And then we are at as great controuersie,
what or where the Church is. In effect, the cō
                  trouersie
commeth to this issue, whether he be a Iusticier,
or an iniusticier, which pronounceth sentence
contrary to the lawe. I would think that common
reason might decide these questions. That he which
giueth sentence against the lawe, may haue the name,
and occupy the place of a Iusticier, but a true Iusticier
he cannot be in deede. Right so, the Popish
Church, which condemneth the trueth for heresie,
hath vsurped as the Iudge, but in deede is a cruell
tyrant. But the controuersie is not of the worde, but
of the meaning, and where shall that be founde but
in the mouth of the Iudge (sayeth he?) if this were
true, I woulde neuer be a Bachiler of lawe, if I were
as Martiall, nor yet a doctor thereof, except it were
to deceiue poore clyantes for their money: if there
were not a sence or meaning of the lawe, which other
men might vnderstande as well as he that occupyeth
the place of the Iudge, that I might appeale
when I sawe he gaue wrong sentence. But let vs
briefely runne ouer his Achillean arguments.
               The Eunomians, Arrians, Eutychians, and
Maximus the heretike, reiected the testimonies of
the fathers, and the authoritie of the Church, and
appealed to Scriptures. So doeth manye

                     •
                   wrangling lawyer, to continue his fee from his

clyant, appeale when he hath no cause, but receyued
right sentence according to the lawe, ergo no appeale
is to be admitted. This is Martials lawe, or logyke,
I knowe not whether. But what was this Maximus
you name so often, Master Martial, that S. Augustine
writ against Could you reade your note booke
no better. Against Maximinus the Arrian he writeth
that neither of them both was to be holden by
the authoritie of Councels, the Nicen, or the Ariminense,
but by the authorities of the Scripture, lib. 3.
Cap. 4.
               But Tertullian would haue heretikes conuinced by
the authoritie of the Church, and not of the Scriptures.
Yea verely, but such heretikes as denyed certeine
scriptures, and peruerteth the rest by their false
interpretations. Such are the Protestantes, sayeth
Martial: for Luther denyeth the Epistle to the Hebrues,
the Apocalipse, the Epistle of S. Iames, and S.
Iude. But Luther is not all Protestants, neyther did
Luther alwayes or altogether denye them. Neither
do the Protestantes affirme anye thing in matters of
controuersie, in their interpretations, but the same is
affirmed by writers of the most auncient and pure
Church. Martiall obiecteth, that Christe sent not
his disciples alwayes to the Scriptures: but sometimes to
the figge tree, to the flowers of the fielde, to the fowles of the
ayre &amp;c. Paul alledgeth the heathen Poet, also customs &amp;
tradition. And we also vse similitudes of Gods creatures,
and alledge custome and condition, but so that
the scripture be the onely rule of trueth, whereto
whatsoeuer in the worlde agreeth, is true: whatsoeuer
disagreeth from it, is false. The traditions of the
Apostles,2. Th. 2. Luk. 10. 1. Io. 4. Mat. 18. which by their writings wee knowe to be
theirs, we reuerently receiue, not as mens traditions,
but as the doctrine of God, for wee heare them
euen as God. Also we heare the voice of the Church
admonishing vs, if we giue offence.
               Finally, ye Patriarks, Prophets, Apostles, Euāgelists,

Pastors,Ex
                        •
                     . 10. Ioel. 1. Eph. 4. and doctors, we all reuerence and heare, as the
messengers of God, but so that they approue vnto vs
their sayings out of the worde of God, and doctrine
of Christ. Likewise, we admit the writings of the fathers,
so farre as they agree with the writings of God,
and further to be credited they them selues required
not. The sayings of the doctors, that Martiall citeth,
for the credite of old writers, you shall finde satisfied
in mine answere to Hoskins, almost in order as
they be here set downe: for one Papist boroweth of
another, and fewe of them haue any thing of their
owne reading. The saying of Clemens is aunswered

                     •
                  course to the Apostolike
Churches, which reteine the doctrine of the
Apostles, against newe heresies, as also of Tertullian,
to the like effect, we acknowledge to be true, but seeing
the Church of Rome reteineth not the Apostolike
doctrine, at this day, we deny it to be an Apostolike
Church. Therefore as many as build vppon it,
or vpon any auncient writers wordes, which hath not
the holy scriptures for his warrant, as M. Cal. sayde,
buyldeth vpon an euill ground. For if an Angell from
heauen teach otherwise then the Apostles haue preached vnto
vs, be he accursed. Here the quarreling lawyer findeth
fault with his translation, because Euangelizauimus
may be referred, as well to the Disciples, as to ye
Apostles, so that ye Disciples preachings are to be credited
as well as ye Apostles, No doubt, if they preach
the doctrine of the Apostles, of which the controuersie
is, and not of the persons that preach it. But these
quarels, sir Bacheler, are more meete for the bomme
courtes, where perhaps you are a prating proctor, then
for the schooles of diuinitie. Wee are gone out, you
say, and that we confesse in our apologie. Yea, wee
are gone out of Babylon, but not out of the church of
God, but abyde in the doctrine of Christ. And you

are gone out of the Church of God, which remaine
in the synke of Rome, that is departed frō that which
was heard from the beginning, and was sacrosanctum
apud Apostolorum Ecclesias, moste holy in the Apostles
Churches.Tert. li. 4. cont. Mart. Math. 15. You cannot abyde to be charged with the
saying of Christ. They worship mee in vaine, that teache
the doctrine and precepts of men. First you saye, the Apostles
were men, whose traditions the Church must
receiue: yea sir, but they deliuered no doctrine of
their owne. Secondly, Christ speaketh of the Scribes &amp;
Pharisees, and their fonde traditions, and not of the Church
and her Catholike traditions and customes. And they be
Scribes and Pharisees, which euen in the Church,
teach a false worshipping of God, according to the
doctrines and traditions of men, disanulling the commaundements
of God, as the Popish teachers in their
doctrine of Images, communion in one kind, priuate
Masse, &amp;c.
               That Augustine framing a perfect preacher, willeth
him to conferre the places of Scripture together:
you say, it is a profounde conclusion, to inferre, that
he sendeth him not to doctours distinctions, censure
of the Church, Canons of the Popes, nor traditions
of the fathers: but onely to quyet and content him selfe
with the worde of God. And these last wordes you saye,
are not found in Augustine, de doct. Chr. Cap. 9. &amp; sequentibus,
as though Master Calfhil recited the words,
&amp; not the sense, for which he referreth you, not only
to that Chapter, but to the rest following, in al which
there is no mention of doctors distinctions, Popes
Canons, &amp;c. But this is an argument ab authoritate negatiuè.
Make as much and as little as you will of Augustines
authoritie, Master Calfhill hath rightly inferred
vppon Augustines iudgement, that if conference
of Scriptures wil make a perfect preacher, which you
graunt, he needeth neyther doctors distinctions, nor
Church censures, &amp;c. but may quyet and content
him selfe with the onely worde of God.
               
                  
But it would make an horse to breake his halter,
to see howe Martiall prooueth out of Augustine,
that God teacheth vs by men and not by Angels, and
that knowledge of the tongues and instructions of
men, is profitable for a preacher: yea, the consent of
moste of the Catholike Churches, and the interpretations
of learned men: as though all those were not
to be referred to the dewe conference of scriptures,
where onely resteth the substance of doctrine, and
the authoritie of faith, and not in doctours distinctions,
Church censures, Popes Canons &amp;c. which
haue no grounde in the Scriptures, or else be contrary
to them. Where Master Calfhill sheweth that
as before the newe testament was written, all things
were examined according to the wordes and Sermons
of the Apostles, so after the newe testament
was written, all thinges ought to be examined according
to their writings, because there is none other
testimonie of credite extant of their sermons &amp; writings.
Martiall replyeth out of Saint Augustine,
that wee haue many thinges by tradition, which are
not writen, which being vniuersally obserued, it were
madnesse to breake, Ep. 118. But Augustine speaketh
not of doctrine, but of ceremonyes or obseruations.
Out of Hierom ad Pam. he obiecteth that our
Creede is not written in the Scriptures, which is vtterly
false, although the fourme of the symbole be
not set downe, as wee rehearse it.
               Thirdly, out of Epiphanius contra Apostolic. li. 2.
Heres. 61. that wee must vse tradition, because all thinges
cannot be taken out of the holy Scriptures. Therefore the holy
Apostles deliuered certeine things in writing, and certeine
things in tradition, &amp;c. But they deliuered nothing
in tradition contrary to their writinges, neyther omitted
they to write any thing that was necessarie
for our saluation. The matter whereof Epiphanius
speaketh, is that it is a tradition of the Apostles,
that it is sinne to marry after virginitie decreed, and

yet he holdeth, that it is better to marrye after virginitie
decreed, then to burne, contrary to the doctrine
of the Papistes. But Martiall frankely graunteth,
that no doctour is to be credited against the Scripture
and the content of the whole Church. Yet where
Master Calfhill sayde, that no man in any age was
so perfect, that a certeine trueth was to be buylded
on him, bringing examples of Aaron and Peter, the
one the high Priest of the Iewes, the other affirmed
by the Papistes to be the same of the Christians.
               He quarreleth at his induction, because he sayeth not:
&amp; sic de singulis, where as his argument followeth
not of the fourme of induction, but of the place a
maiore ad minus.
               
               After this, (as he doeth nothing but cauill) hee
chargeth Master Calfhill for corrupting Saint Augustine
saying: Truth mee not, nor credite my writings,
&amp;c. Proem. lib. 3. de Trinit. For Saint Augustine
sayeth not: trust mee not. But he confesseth
that he sayeth: Do not addict thy selfe to my writings, as
to the Canonicall Scriptures. See what a corruption here
is, when Master Calfhill rendereth not the words, but
the meaning of Augustine.
               Againe, saint Basil (he sayeth) is vilely abused, because
Master Calfhill sayeth, Saint Basil setteth forth
by a proper similitude, with what iudgement the
fathers of the Church should be read. Conc. ad Adol.
wheras Basil speaketh of prophane writers. As though
Basils similitude may not serue to shewe howe both
should bee read, because he speaketh but of one
sorte.
               Likewise he cryeth out that Saint Hierome is not
truely alledged, because the Printer in the English
translation of Hieroms words hath omitted this word
not, which he hath set downe in the Latine. The
4. pretie persons he putteth vppon Master Calfhill,
as foolishe and childishe I omitt, onely the slaunderers
persons I will touche: In saying, that the

fathers declyned all from the simplicitie of the Gospell in ceremonies.
He chargeth M. Calfhill to be a slaunderer.
Because God hath not suffered all the fathers to
declyne, lest hell gates should haue preuailed against
his Church. Although M. Calfhill speake of those
fathers onely, whose writings are extant, yet the gates
of hell in ydle ceremonies, did but assault, they did
not preuaile against the Church. And these fathers
departed not from the Gospell, but declined from
the simplicitie thereof. But you Papistes haue departed
from the Gospell and doctrin of saluation, in setting
vp a newe sacrifice, in seeking iustification by
workes, in ouerthrowing the true and spiritual worship
of God. As for the two Iudges, the worde and
the spirite, he denyeth them, finding manye defectes
in the worde: As that it is sencelesse, dombe, deafe, not able
to prooue it selfe to be the worde of God, hauing no more
power to be Iudge and decide controuersies, then the booke
of statutes to put on my lorde chiefe Iustices robes, and to come
to the Kings bench, and giue sentence. I thinke there is no
Christian man, but abhorreth to reade these blasphemies.
But let vs see, whether the booke of statutes
(although it put on no robes) is not iudge, even
ouer my lorde chiefe Iustice him selfe, who is a minister
seruing to pronounce the lawe, not a King to
alter the lawe: for he him selfe must be obedient to
the lawe. Nowe in all controuersies that be de iure,
either the lawe is plaine to be vnderstoode, or it is
obscure: If it be plane, as that a felone must be
hanged, or the sonne must inherite his father, &amp;c.
the Iudge pronouncing the lawe with authoritie, and
execution following his sentence, brydleth the obstinate
person that will not obey the lawe, which he
knoweth as well as the Iudge. If the lawe be hard
to be vnderstoode, the Iudge must seeke the interpretation
thereof, according to the minde of the law-maker,
and not according to the his owne fantasie. So
that in all cases, the Iudge hath no authoritie ouer

the lawe, but vnder the lawe: so that if the giue
wrong sentence, both he and his sentence are to bee
iudged by lawe. Or else why doe you Martiall in
your ciuill lawe courtes, so often crye out, sit liber
iudex, let the booke be Iudge? If you will not allow
the booke of Gods law to be Iudge, euen ouer them
which haue authoritie as Iustices haue in the common
lawe, to pronounce it, and to declare it.
               The Spirite he refuseth to be Iudge, because it is inuisible,
secreate, vnknowen, vnable to be gone to, but in the
Church: therefore the Church is the Iudge, and neyther
the worde nor the Spirite. But the Spirite by his
owne substance incomprehensible, is by his effects
in the holy Scriptures visible, reuealed, knowen, and
able to be gone vnto, therefore a sufficient Iudge,
taking witnesse of the Scriptures, and bearing witnesse
vnto them. For that maiestie of trueth, that power
of working, that vniforme consent which is in
all the Scriptures inspired of God, maketh a wonderfull
difference of them from all writings of men
of all sortes.
               But let vs see Martials arguments against the Spirite
of God, to be iudge of the interpretation of the
Scriptures. Paul and Barnabas in the controuersie
of circumcision, went not to the word and Spirit, but
to the Apostles and Elders at Ierusalem. O blocke-head
and shamelesse asse. Paul and Barnabas doubted
not of the question, but sought the generally quiet
of the whole Church by consent of Councell.
But whether went the Apostles and Elders for decision
of the question? but to the worde and Spirite.
Reade Act. 15.
               Againe, he citeth Deuteronom. 17. that the people
in controuersies should resort to the priestes for iudgement:
but where should they fetche their iudgement,
but of the lawe of God? as it is in the same
place.
               Againe, Christ hath appointed Apostles, Euangelistes,

&amp;c. therefore it is not a generall precept, for
all men to trie, all men to iudge what doctrine they
receiue, bicause all be not Apostles, Euangelistes, &amp;c.
Then in vaine saide Christ to all men,Iames 5. 1. Iohn 4. Actes 17. search the scriptures,
in vaine the Apostles trie the spirites, neither
did the Boerheans well, that daily sought the Scriptures,
to see, if those things were so as the Apostles
taught.
               Martiall is to be pitied if he knowe no difference
betweene authoritie of publike teaching, and the triall
and examination of doctrine, whereof this pertaineth
to all men, the other to such onely as are called
thereto. But Martiall proceedeth to shewe, that
as GOD appointed one high Priest to the Iewes, to
avoide schismes, so he appointed Peter among the
Christians: and for this purpose he citeth diuers sentences
of the auncient Fathers, which all in order
almost, the reader shall finde cited and satisfied in
myne aunswere to Doctor Sanders booke of the rocke
of the Church Cap. 5. except one place of Tertullian
De pudicitia, which I maruell this Popish Lawyer
would alledge, being so contrarie to his purpose,
but that the poore man vnderstoode it not. Qualis
es &amp;c. What art thou ouerthrowing and changing the intention
of our Lorde, giuing this personally to Peter: Vpon thee
(saide he) I will builde my Church. If it were personally
saide to Peter, (Syr Bacheler) counsel with Baldus
and Bertholdus, whether it goe by succession to the
Pope or no? Which Tertullian denyeth to pertaine
to euery Elder of the Church, bicause it was spoken
personally to Peter.
               And nowe at the length beginneth he to come to
the argument of his booke, the signe of the crosse.
Which he saide was the fourth signification of the
word (Crosse) in Scripture, and calleth it the materiall
and mysticall signe of the crosse, which Master
Calfhill denieth to be once mentioned in Scripture,
in that sense that Martiall taketh it. Martiall repeateth

that which he had saide before, that Esaye cap. 49.
saith: I will set out myne signe on high to the people, which
Hierome vpon that place expoundeth to be the standard
of the crosse, that it may be fulfilled which is written, the
earth is full of his praise. Et iterum &amp;c. And againe. In all
the earth his name is wonderfull. Which wordes following
immediately, Martiall craftily suppresseth, and
falleth into a brabbling matter, that preaching which
Master Calfhill saide was this standard, is not the onely
standard or signe lifted vp by GOD for conuersion
of the Gentiles, but miracles and good examples of
life, &amp;c. Whereas the question is, whether the Popish
signe of the crosse, be the signe spoken by Esay and
Hierome. And the exposition added by Hierome,
sheweth plainely, that he meaneth not a red or blue
crosse banner, but the preaching of Christe crucified,
whereby the earth is filled with the praise of GOD,
and his name is wonderfull in all the earth. But Martiall
in the end concludeth, that it hath pleased the auncient
Fathers to appoint and ordeine the signe of the crosse, to
he one meane among many, by which the praise of GOD is set
foorth. Where he should haue proued, that the signe
of the crosse (as he taketh it) is mentioned in the scriptures.
Other cauils and slaunders not more false then
foolish, I will clearely omit, as I purposed in the beginning,
and followe onely such matter as is proper
to the question in controuersie, namely the signe of
the crosse.
               The second text, to proue that the signe of the crosse
is mentioned in the scripture, he citeth out of Iere. 4.
Lift vp a signe in Sion which; Hierome likewise expoundeth,
Lift vp the standard of the crosse in an high tower, that is,
in the height of the Church. Concerning this interpretation
of Hierome, how apt it is for the place, I will spend
no time with Master Martiall: onely this is sufficient
for the purpose, that Saint Hierome meaneth not
the crosse on the toppe of the steeple, but the passion

of Christ: whereto he exhorteth the people to runne
for aide as to a standard of comfort, against the enimie
that was comming vpon them.
               The third text is Matth. 24. The signe of the sonne
of man shall appeare in the cloudes: which diuers of
the olde writers expound to be the signe of the crosse.
Some to be Christ him selfe, as Chrysostome in Matt.
24. Hom. 49. Some to be the crosse it selfe on which he
dyed, as Chrysost in Matt. Hom. 77. and Theophilact.
in 24. Matth. Some other the passion or signe of the
crosse, as Hierome vpon that place: so that the Doctors
being in diuers opinions, &amp; speaking doutfully, there
is no certaintie of ye matter. That the signe of the sonne
of man is Christ him selfe, as Chrysostome rehearseth
some to haue thought in his time, is the most probable
opinion, bicause both Marke cap. 13. and Luke 21.
do seeme so to expound that signe of the sonne of man
in Matthewe. But Martiall is such a perillous Logician,
that he will admit nothing but necessarie consequences,
which we must be bolde to vrge and require
of him, for the mention of the signe of the crosse in
such varietie of Doctors opinions, and a matter so obscure.
               The fourth text is Ezechiel 9. the signe Thau set on
the foreheads of them that should be preserued from
destruction. But what argument or authoritie hath he
to proue, that this marke was the signe of the crosse?
None at all, onely he quarelleth after his manner, against
M. Calfhils reasons, which shewe it was not the
signe of the crosse, but an inward spirituall marke.
And least he should flee to the figure of the Samaritane
letter Thau, which Hierome saith in his time,
was somwat like a crosse. Hierome himselfe sheweth
that the Septuagintes, Aquila, and Symmachus translate
Thaua marke, as the word signifieth: only Theodotion,
left the Hebrue word vntranslated, which bicause
it is the name of the last Hebrue letter, diuers
thought to signifie Thorah, the lawe, whereof

they were obseruers that were so marked. Cyprian
also taketh it for a marke, without naming the letter
Thau. Contra demetrianum. Wherefore seeing here is nothing,
whereby the fashion of the marke may be gathered,
fondly doeth Martiall gather, that it was the
signe of the crosse.
               The fift text, is the marke commaunded to be set
vpon all Gods seruants in the Apoc. 7. which Martiall
out of Thomas Aquinas concludeth to be the signe of
of the crosse, but that is disproued by M. Calfhils three
reasons, which Martiall like an impudent wrangler,
will vnderstand onely of the place of Ezechiel. 1.
The spirite of life and faith is not giuen with the
signe of the crosse. 2. Which is not sufficient to discerne
the good from the badde. 3. But is receiued of
all sortes, therefore the seale spoken of in those places
is not the signe of the crosse.
               Martials crosse not being found in the holy Scriptures,
hath yet often remembrance among the auncient
Fathers, whome M. Calfhill doth iustly reproue
in this behalfe, so highly to extoll that signe, which
hath no ground in the word of God, either in contention
against the Gentiles that disdained it, or in aemulation
of the heretikes that first vsed it. For if all records
of ecclesiasticall antiquitie be sought, that are
authenticall, and not manifestly counterfeted, there
shall no mention be found of Martials crosse in the
fourth signification, before the superstition of the Valentinian
heretikes, which called the crosse, Horon, confirmatiuam
crucem, which Iraeneus lib. 1. ca. 1. doth speake
of. So doth Epiphanius Contra Valent. Haer. 31. But against
this reproofe of the olde writers, Martiall hath a plausible
common place to sporte him selfe, in which notwithstanding
euery wise man can see, howe fondly he
behaueth him selfe, to be patrone to them, which either
neede not his defence, where they write well, or
can not be iustified by him where they write amisse.
I will therefore passe ouer all such fruitlesse controuersies,

and keepe me onely to the argument. That
Chrysostome was immoderate somtimes in extolling
the signe of the crosse, and such like matters, either
Martial must confesse, or else excuse it by a rethorical
hyperbole: as where he saith of Saint Pauls chaine:

                     Si quis me coelo condonet omni, vel ea qua Pauli manus vinciebatur
catena illam ego honore praeponerem: If any man
could reward me with al heauen, or else with yt chaine
wherewith Pauls handes were bound, I would preferre
that chaine in honour. Such are many excessiue speaches
in Chrysostome, both of the signe of the crosse,
of the Lordes Supper, of Baptisme, and other thinges.
In Tertullians time the signe of the crosse was vsed among
Christians, to shewe them selues to be Christians,
against the Gentiles, if it were not a piece of Montanus
superstition.
               But whereas Martiall citeth Constantinus, for the
commendation of his crosse, he sheweth him selfe an
egregious ignorant person, both in antiquitie and in
the historie. For the signe which Constantine commended,
to be a healthfull signe and true token of vertue,
by which he deliuered the citie from tyrants, was
not the signe of the crosse, but the character of the
name of Christe, which was shewed to him from heauen,
with this inscription, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , in this GOD,
not in this signe, thou shalt ouercome.
               And least Martiall should cauill at the signe of the
crosse, named by Eusebius, De Vit. Const. lib. 1. you shall vnderstand, that he describeth the standard of Constantine
to haue bene a long speare, in the top whereof
a barre went ouerthwart like a crosse to hang the
banner vpon, which euen the Heathen Emperours
vsed. But in the banner was set foorth in golde and
precious stones that signe which Constantine did see,
which was the Greeke letter P, with the letter X, in the
middest thereof, after this manner, which is to be
seene in many hundrethes of auncient coynes, both

of Constantine, and other Christian Emperours which
is the Caracter of the name of Christ. Agreeing
with the wordes of Eusebius 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
By which you may see howe ridiculously Martiall
and the Papistes looke onely to the crosse staffe
vppon whiche the banner hanged, and see not the
very wholesome signe in deede, which was described
in the banner, namely in the name of Christ, by whom
Constantine had so glorious victories.
               But Martial omitting to speake of the crosse vsed
among the Heathen Priestes of Serapis, will discusse
Maister Calfhils two rules. The one: that whatsoeuer
is brought in vnder the cloake of good intent, is not
straightway allowable.
               To this he sayeth, that some thinges are brought
in by priuate men, without authoritie of the Pope, and
for priuate men he counteth the bishoppes of Spaine,
and Fraunce, in their prouincial councels: these binde
not generally, except the Pope allowe them: some
things are receiued by tradition &amp; custome generally
receyued vnaltred, such is the crosse: some are brought
in by tradition and custome, but not generally receyued,
as that infantes should receyue the communion,
&amp;c: such the crosse is not. But seeing he hath
not concluded the contradiction of Maister Calfhils
sixte rule, it standeth still vnmoueable. That some
things are brought in of a good intent, whiche are
not allowable.
               The seconde rule is: what so euer hath bene vpon
good occasion receiued once, must not necessarily be
reteyned still, but by aduice of Stephanus bishop of
Rome, if it be turned to superstition, be altered by
them that come after. These aftercōmers, saith Martiall,
are none other but the bishops of Rome his successours,
who as they made the lawe, so they must repeale
it. But Stephanus sayeth. Si nonnulli ex praedecessoribus
&amp; maioribus nostris fecerunt aliqua, Naming
not onely his praedecessours, but also his Elders,

wherefore he meaneth yt not onely his successours, but
also his after commers in euery particular Church, as
well as his successours in the Church of Rome, ought
to abolish with good authoritie such abused customs.
But Martiall wil not acknowledge that crossing hath
bred such inconueniences, yt the inward faith hath bene
vntaught, &amp; that the vertue hath ben giuen to yt signe,
which onely proceedeth from him which is signified.
For crossing was not the cause, but the negligence of
the Cleargie. As though there may not be many causes
of one thing. And if crossing were but an occasion
of such inconueniences, there were good cause to take
it away. Also he denyeth that they attribute the vertue
of the signe, without relation to the merites of Christes
passion: whereas M. Calfhil speaketh not of suche
shiftes as craftie Lawiers can make for their excuses,
but of the opinion of the ignorant people, who haue
thought without any further relation, that the signe of
the crosse was an holy, blessed, and wholesome thing.
And what do they that vse the example of Iulian, who
crossing himself of custome, and not with any relation
to Christe whome he despised, prooue what vertue
the signe of the crosse hath, when the diuels immediately
auoyded, do they not manifestly ascribe vertue,
to the signe without relation of the maker? Yea, sayth
Martial, but Christe gaue such vertue to that signe by
his death and passion. Shewe that out of the Scriptures,
and the controuersie is at an end.
               But Martial the Lawier, for the vertue of the crosse
citeth Martiall the Apostle, for so he will be called, &amp;
was as his cosin Martial the Lawier affirmeth, one of
of the 72. Disciples of Christ. But seeing hee and his
epistles haue slept seuen or eight hundreth yeares in a
corner, yt they were neuer heard of by Eusebius, Hierome,
Gennadius nor any other of those times, he commeth
to late nowe to challenge the name of an Apostle
or Disciple of Christe, whose name or writinges
in so many hundreth yeares no man hath registred.

But this argument is of authoritie negatiue, quod
Martiall. But what argument haue you so good to
prooue him authenticall, as this is probable to proue
him counterfet? Nay if we beleeue Martial, Maister
Calfhil hath falsified the Scripture, in saying, that no
man dare come neare, nor resist Leuiathan, and Behemoth
the deuils, for beside the quotation is false cap.
40. for 41. The Popishe translation hath not so, and
Christe his Apostles and faithfull doe resist the Diuel.
Yea sir but not with sworde nor speare, whereof he
speaketh, nor with your crosse, but with spirituall armour.
As for the errour of the quotation &amp; your translation,
euery childe may see how fonde a quarrel it is.
               The excuse that Maister Calfhill maketh for Damascen,
seeing Martial doth not allow, let him make a
better himselfe: for some of Damascens errours were
such as Martial himselfe and the Papistes will not allowe.
               
                  But Lactantius maketh the bloud of the pascal Lambe sprinkled
on the dore post, a figure of the crosse on mens foreheads.
That is false in your sense Maister Martiall, for he
speaketh allegorically of the spirituall impression of
of the bloud of Christe by faith, and that his wordes
declare, where he saith: that Christ is saluation To all
which haue written,
                  Lib. 4. cap. 26. De ver
                        •
                      sap. 
                  the signe of bloud, that is the signe of the
crosse, vpon which he shed his bloud on their foreheades.
But Christ is not saluation to all that haue your signe of
the crosse on their bodily foreheades. But whereas
Lactantius in the next Chapter saith, that deuils are
chased away both by the name of Christ, and by the
signe of his passion: if it pleased God in those times, by
such outward signes to confound his aduersaries, what
is that to defend the superstitious and erronious abuse
of those signes at this time?
               And here Martiall falleth into another brabble, for
mistaking his argument, which is not worth a strawe:
the end is, the crosse is like a sacrament, although that
it be not as good as a sacrament. But wherein it is like?

it hath neither institutiō nor element, nor promise, nor
effect, of a sacrament, then it is as like as an apple is like
an oyster. You say it is instituted by tradition. Proue yt
tradition to haue come from Christ, and his Apostles. I
haue shewed, it came from heretiks. Again God said to
Costantine In hoc signo vince. I haue shewed, that God
spake neither of a crosse, nor of a signe. And yet if he
had, it was but a particular vision authorizing no generall
obseruation. You say it may be a sacrament as
well as bread and wine whiche hath no promise: you
lie like an arrogant hypocrite. For bread and wine in
the vse of the Lordes Supper, hath as good promise, as
water in baptisme. Concerning the effect of the sacramentes,
and howe they be causes of grace, not as principall
efficients, but as instrumental meanes, by which
God vseth to worke in the faithfull, it were to begin
a newe matter, to stand in argument with you, which
doe nothing but wrangle, scoffe, and rayle in this argument,
as you doe in all the rest.
               Wherefore to returne to the crosse, Maister Calfhil
saith, that if there were such necessitie in the crosse
to fight against Sathan, the Apostles dealt not wisely
to omit such a necessary weapon.
               Martiall aunswereth, that neither he nor the Fathers
defende it as necessary. Well then, we haue gayned
thus much, that the crosse is a needelesse weapon
against the diuel. But if it had ben necessary, he saith,
it had bene none ouersight in the Apostles, which haue
in some epistles omitted more needefull matters.
               As though they were bound to speake of all matters
in euery Epistle. But of the vse of the crosse, they
neuer speake, no not where they instruct a Christian
man to fight against the Deuill, against whome it is
needefull to vse all weapons that be of any force. The
quarrell of altering Saint Peters wordes I omitte, as
childish. Maister Calfhill rehearseth his meaning, and
not his wordes.
               The other argument that followeth of heretikes

resembling Antichrist in denying, you shall finde answered
in my confutation of D. Sanders Rocke Cap.
18. in the eleuenth mark of an Antichristian. But Martial
is not content that his error in citing the 39. question
for the 38. of Athanasius Ad Antiochum should be
noted. In deede the errour of number is a smal matter,
but when a man will followe wilfully a corruption
for a truth, it cannot be excused. That diuels flie when
they see the crosse, is question 15. in the best reformed
printes, whatsoeuer Martiall doth followe. But to the
purpose, except Martial can declare vnto vs, with what
eyes the diuelles beholde the crosse, he shall haue
much a doe to perswade vs, that this author speaketh
of his signe of the crosse in this place. Otherwise I
doubt not but when diuels consider the conquest of
of Christ vpon the crosse they tremble and flee away,
and are miserably tormented, as Athanasius saith: but
not when so euer they see the crosse borne in procession,
or set vp in the market place, or pointed in the aire,
either by a superstitious Papist, or by a diuelish coniurer.
Saint Antonies councel, as great and as good as
you make him, may well be suspected, seeing it hath
no ground in the holy scriptures. That Chrysostome
aloweth signing with ye crosse in the body, is confessed:
but that he accounteth it an idle ceremony, where faith
in the crucified is not, Martial can not deny. Nor yet yt
faith in the death of Christ is sufficient without the
signe of the crosse in the body: yet wil he not graunt it
to be superfluous, but resembleth it to the incarnation
and passion of Christe, without whiche we might be
saued by the absolute power of God, to the vse of ministers,
good workes, &amp;c. Whereas we ought to say yt
all these thinges are necessary, because God hath so ordeyned
them, but the crossing of the body is no ordinance
of God, but of men.
               That Origine in cap. 6. Ad Rom. li. 6. speaketh not of
Martials crosse, but of the passion of Christ, the whole
cōtext of his words proueth, as M. Calfhil sheweth. But

Martiall replyeth that he saith: So great is the vertue
of the crosse of Christ, that if it be set before our eyes,
and faithfully reteyned in our minde, so that we looke
still vppon the death of Christe, with the eyes of our
minde, no concupiscence, &amp;c. can ouercome vs. These
words (saith he) proue two crosses, one before the eyes,
the other before the minde, but if he would shore vp
his eyes he might see, that Origen speaketh not of
the eyes of the body, but of the eyes of the minde. As
for the tantologie that he would auoyde, it may please
his wisedome to vnderstand, that the explaning of a
Metaphore, is not tantologie, or vaine repetition.
               That Cassiodorus, and Lactantius speake of the
signe of the crosse it is granted, but because they speak
of it beside the Booke of God, Maister Calfhill doth
well to disprooue their reasons, as where Cassiodore
compareth that signe of the crosse vpon the faithful,
to the Princes stampe on the coyne, the comparison
is naught, for the signe of the crosse which is vpon hypocrites,
sheweth them not to be Christes seruaunts.
Neither did Christ giue any such outwarde signe, by
which they should be knowen, that would professe to
be his seruantes, but baptisme. How good Christians
the Friers that are the greatest crossers be, I will not
stande to discusse, their hypocrisie is too well knowen
in the worlde.
               Againe where Lactantius ioyneth the signe of the
crosse with the name of Christ, to be of force to driue
away deuils, he doth as if a man should ioyne a strawe
with a speare to runne at tilt withall. For the name of
Christ is sufficient, and needeth none assistance of the
signe of the crosse to cast out deuils, where Christe
hath giuen that power and faith. Yet Martial obiecteth,
that the name of Christ was not sufficient to cast
out some kinde of deuils, as in example of the mans
sonne. Matt, 17. But it was not for want of the signe
of the crosse, but for want of faith, which must be obteyned
at the handes of God by prayer and fasting. He

would haue scripture, whereby the signe of the crosse
is forbidden to be vsed, as though euery indifferent
thing that may be abused, is expressed by name. To
make a signe or figure of the crosse, is an indifferent
thing, to make it for a defence against deuils, is a superstitious
thing, and forbidden by all such textes of
Scripture forbidde superstition, and confidence reposed
in any thing, sauing in God onely, by such meanes
as he hath appointed.
               That young nouices in the faith were crossed, before
they were baptised in Augustines time, it neede
to be no question: and yet it followeth not: that those
wordes of Augustine, which Martiall citeth, De Symb.
ad Catech. lib. 2. cap. 1. were spoken of the signing, but
of that which was signified by the signe, as Maister
Calfhil answereth. The rest of this article is spent in
friuolous quarrels, in which is no argument to vphold
the superstitious vse of the crosse, but that deuils are
afraide of it, as in the story of Iulian, and a Iewe, in
which God declared, what force it had Ex opere operato,
of the worke wrought euen without faith, but this he
maketh extraordinarie. A simple force that the Deuill
should seeme to flie from them, in whose heartes he
dwelled still. But Martiall would knowe, how Maister
Calfhill is assured that the Deuil did counterfet feare,
and was not afraide in deede. Verily I thinke there
neede to be no better reason giuen, then that in outward
appearance he pretended to flie from their bodily
presence, from whose heartes he departed not at all, or
rather for their wicked coniuring entired with greater
force. How little the diuel is afraide of the signe of
the crosse, where faith is not, the story of the seuen
sonnes of Sceua declareth Act. 19. where the Deuil being
coniured by the name of Iesus, whome Paule
preached, fel vpon the coniurers and tormented them:
vnlesse Martiall thinke it was because they lacked the
signe of the crosse, which would haue made them flie
away when the name of Iesus and Paule preuailed not

against thē. To conclude it cānot be denied, but diuers
of ye ancient fathers affirm more of ye signe of ye crosse,
then they can iustifie by the holy Scripture, and yet
they are abused oftentimes by Martial and such as he
is, as though they spake of the signe, when they had respect
onely to the death and passion of Christ, as before
is shewed, and more remaineth afterwarde to be
shewed.
            
            
               The second Article.
               That the crosse of Christ was prefigured in the law of nature,Martial.
foreshewen by the figures of Moses lawe, denounced by the prophetes,
and shewed from heauen in the time of grace.
               Maister Calfhil saide,Fulke. that the signe of the crosse
was neither prefigured in the lawe of nature, nor foreshewed
by the figures of Moses law, nor denounced by
the prophetes, nor shewed from heauen in the time of
grace, but the passion of Christ &amp; manner of his death.
Against whom commeth forth Martiall and offereth
to prooue, that the crosse whereon Christe died, was
prefigured, &amp;c. which is no contradiction of M. Calfhils
assertion. Although the fathers rather dallie in
trifling allegories, then soundly to prooue that the
crosse was prefigured in those places which he alledgeth:
as August. Contra Faust. lib. 12. cap. 34. that the two
stickes which the widowe of Sarepta gathered, did prefigure
the crosse whereon Christ died, not only by the
name of wood, but by the number of the stickes, Et de
5. heres. ad quod vult de. cap. 2. that Moses lifting vp his
handes to heauen, did prefigure the crosse whereby
Christ should redeeme the worlde: So saith Tertullian
and Augustine in diuers places. All which proue not
that the image or signe of the crosse, but that ye crosse
it selfe, whereon Christ died, was prefigured, whereof
we make no question, but it might be, seeing it was in
Gods determination that Christe should die on the

crosse: although we would wish sounder proofes then
these, for such prefiguration. Here would Martiall
excuse his ridiculous argument, because it is not in
mode and figure, but in deede it fayleth both in forme
and matter, for his minor is false, yt the signe of ye crosse
was prefigured by ye hands of Moses. As though there
were no difference between the crosse on which Christ
suffered, &amp; a superstitious signe of the crosse yt a Papist
maketh: Concerning the signe Thau in Ezechiel cap. 9.
I haue spoken sufficiently in the first article, that it was
not the figure of any letter like a crosse, but a marke
vnnamed, or described as Apo. 7. And wheras Hierome
saith, that the Samaritanes had a letter somewhat like
a crosse, it is not to be throught yt the Samaritanes had
the true forme of letters, and the Iewes lost it. Chrysostome
draweth it to the Greeke letter, and trifleth of
the number which the letter Tau signifieth: Tertulliā
is indifferent betweene the Latine latter and ye Greeke,
&amp; setteth this T for the marke of his forehead, differing
somewhat from our Popishe ✚,In Mark. H 14. adver. Mar. li. 30. for which cause
Martiall calleth the character of the Latine letter, Tau
saying Our Tau is a signe of the crosse. But of this marke
more. Art. 1. and in my answere to D. Sanders booke of
Images Cap. 13. or 12. Concerning the figure of ye crosse,
that was in the olde time in the idol Serapis, wherunto
he thinketh scorne to be sent for the antiquity of that
signe, he answereth out of Socrates, that it was there
set by the prouidence of God, as the inscription of the
altar in Athens, and among the Hyeroglyphical letters
of the Aegyptian priestes, signified life to come. But
this proueth no more ye superstitious vse therof, then ye
alter in Athens proueth, that we should set vp such altars,
and dedicate them to the vnknowen God. Next
followeth the brawle about the story of Constantines
crosse, which should be the figure of the crosse shewed
from heauen in the time of grace, wherein Martial noteth
no lesse then sixe contradictions &amp; foure lyes in,
in M. Calfhil, but of them let the reader iudge.
               
                  
The signe shewed, I haue prooued before, not to
haue bene Martials crosse, but the Character of the
name of Christ, and so doth Constantinus himselfe cal
it, speaking to Christe, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &amp;c.
Holding forth thy Character I haue ouercome, &amp;c.
meaning the standerd in which that Character was
imbrodered. But of this I haue spoken sufficient Art. 1.
and against D. Sanders booke of images cap. 13. Ar. or
after the errour of his print. After much wrangling
and brabbling about M. Calfhils principles, wherein
it were easie to displaye Martials follie, but that I
haue professed to omit such by matters, he cōmeth to
the signe of the crosse shewed to Iulian, &amp; marked in
his souldiers apparell: which if it were true, as Sozomenus
reporteth it, yet proueth it not yt the signe of the
crosse was shewed from heauen that it should be vsed
of Christians: and the lesse, because it was shewed to
none but Iewes, and forsakers of Christian religion, as
Maister Calfhill noteth: which might probably be
thought to be the marke of persecuters, rather then of
Christians. But seeing the Signe of the crosse hath
very often times appeared not onely in cloudes, but also
on mennes apparell, with diuers other sightes,
as Conradus Lycosthenes in his booke De Prodigijs
obserueth, whether the cause of those apparitions be
naturall, or supernaturall, or sometime perhaps artificiall,
the appearing of that signe from heauen doeth
no more argue an allowance of the Popish ceremonie
of crossing in religion, then the appearing of other
shapes and sightes in heauen, doe teache vs to frame ceremonies
of armour, of horsemen, of beastes, of trees,
of pillers, of circles, and such like, because the figures
of them haue ben shewed from heauē. So that hitherto
the signe of the crosse hath not bene prooued to haue
bene prefigured in the lawe of nature, nor of Moses,
neither denounced by the prophetes, nor vsed by the
Apostles, nor shewed from heauen to be a pattern of ye
allowance of superstitious crossing among ye Papistes.
            
            
               
               The thirde Article.
               That euery Church, Chappell, and Oratorie erected to the honour
and seruice of God,Martial. should haue the signe of the crosse.
               First it is to be remembred,Fulke. that for this position he
hath no shewe of the authoritie of the holy scriptures,
nor yet the testimony of any auncient writer, that any
Church, Chappell, or Oratory should haue any crosse
grauen or painted within it or vpon it for 500. yeares
after Christ. Eusebius describing diuerse Churches
builded in his time, sheweth no such necessary furniture
of a Christian Church, although, he set foorth euen
the fashion of the stalles or stooles where the ministers
should sit lib. 10. cap. 4.
               But Martial to haue shewe of antiquitie, beginneth
with a newe found olde doctour, called Abdias,
whose authoritie, seeing Maister Calfhill reiecteth as
a meere countefet, Martial spendeth certaine leaues in
quarrelling at some of his reasons, and the rest he passeth
ouer because he can say nothing against them.
But touching the credite of this Abdias, if any man be
not satisfied with M. Calfhils reasons. I referre him
further to the Bishop of Sarums booke against Harding.
Art 1. Diu. 5. p. 8.
               To speake of the vowe of virginitie supposed to be
made by the virgine Marie, it is impertinent to the
cause. It commeth somewhat nearer, that he defendeth
building of Churches in the honour of Saintes, because
some Churches of olde haue had the name of
Saintes. But Augustine saith of the Saintes. 
                     Quare honoramus
eos charitate, non seruitute, nec eis Templa construimus,
nolunt enim se sic honorari a nobis, quia nos ipsos cùm
boni simus, templa summi Deiesse nouerunt. Wherfore we honour
them with loue, not with seruice: Neither doe we
builde Churches to them, for they will not be so honoured
of vs, because they knowe that we our selues

when we are good, are ye temples of the highest God:
De vera religion. Ca. 55. Also Ep. 174. Pascentio He proueth
the holy ghost to be God, because he hath a temple.
Also Euch. ad Laurent. Cap. 56. The like iudgement
he hath de ciuis. Dei. li. 8. Cap. 27. &amp; li. 22. Ca. 10. shewing
that it is a diuine honor proper to God, to haue temples
erected to his honor, and declaring that ye Martyrs
churches were places set vp in their memorie, not
temples in their honour.
               But Martiall fynding nothing for the space of 500
yeares after Christ for his purpose, at length stumbleth
vpon a Canon of the prouinciall Councell of
Orleans in Fraunce: that No man should buyld a Church
before the Bishop came &amp; set vp a crosse. This canno made
in those dayes, sheweth yt churches before the making
therof were builded without a crosse, neither bindeth
it any, but such as build churches within the prouince
of Orleans. Beside that it may be doubted of the antiquitie
of the Canon, seeing it is not found in the recordes
of yt councell, but taken out of the Popes Canon
lawe, where is most counterfait stuffe. Beside that
it is not obserued among the Papists themselues, that
before any chuch, chappel, or Oratorie be buylded,
the bishop of the diocesse should come and make a
crosse there. The next Canon he citeth our of ye Councell
of Toures the 2. Vt corpus domini in altari, non in armario,
sed sub crucis titulo componatur, that the Lords body
be layde on the altar, not in a chest or almery, but
vnder the title of the crosse. But Martial doth english
it thus: That the body of our Lord consecrated vpon
The Altar, be not reposed and set in the reuestry, but
vnder the roode. He braggeth y• when he was Vsher
of Winchester schoole, he taught his Schollers ye true
signification of the Latine words.Pro Clu. But beside that hee
translateth Armarium a reuestrie,Pro Cel. which Tully vseth for
a place wherein money was kept,In Ant. which could not wel
be an open house, &amp; also maketh a manifest difference
betweene Armarium &amp; Sacrar
                        •••
                     , beside also that hee

calleth titulum crucis the roode, where findeth he in this
sentence the Latine worde for his English worde, consecrated?
But to the purpose of the crosse, this Canon
sheweth, that in old time they vsed to lay it otherwise
then vnder the title of the crosse, whether they meant
thereby the signe of the crosse, or these wordes, Iesus
Naz. rex Iudaeorum, which was the title of the crosse, as
they had in those dayes many ceremonies growne out
of vse, and therefore not vnderstood of vs.
               The third Councel is a Canon of the sixt generall
Councell at Constantinople in Trullo, which in the
margent he calleth the Councell of Chalcedon in
Trullo. Can. 73. which M. Calfhil could not finde in yt
Councel, because it is certeine, &amp; confessed by Geranza,
Martials author, that the sixt Councel of Constantinople
in Trullo made no ceremonies but of ye faith,
&amp; that these which he setteth forth, were made priuatly
by them long after in the dayes of Iustinian, therfore
they haue neither the authoritie of Canons, nor
be free from suspition of forgery. And yet the Canon
alledged, proueth not this article, for it only commā
                  deth
crosses that were made in the pauement to be put
out. Nay, sayth Martiall, the prohibition of the crosse
to be made on the ground, permitteth it to be made
in all other places. For a prohibition restrictiue of a thing
to be done in one place, is a lawfull permission for all other places,
which are not namely included in that prohibition. And
for this he referreth him selfe to ye iudgement of the
lawyers. But I thinke his lawe deceiueth him in this
point, as much as his diuinitie almost in euery point.
For if ye kings edict forbid swearing, fighting, brawling
in his court, I suppose he doeth not permit these
things as lawfull in al other places. The last Canon
which forbad ye laying of ye lords body in ye vestri, doth
not lawfully permit it to be layd in the belfry. The
captains prohibition, yt no man shal discharge his belly
within ye precinct of ye camp, is not a lawful permission
yt a soldiar may defile a church without ye campe.
               
                  
The lawe that forbiddeth the Princes image to be
made on the pauement, is not a lawfull permission
that the same may be set vppon the high altar, what
Martials lawe is in these cases, I knowe not, but my
reason serueth me not to allowe of those prohibitions
for lawfull permission. And where these Canon
makers saye: They did reuerence the liuely crosse with
minde, tongue, and sense. Martiall inferreth, that this
worde sense, declareth that they had a sensible crosse, to which
they might shewe their reuerence with their externall senser:
Which senses Martiall? their sight, their hearing, their
smelling, their tasting, or their feeling. Did you
teache your schollers at Winchester thus to interpret?
was it the image of the crosse, or the liuely crosse
that shewed them that sauing health, which they professe
to reuerence in worde and minde? And were
you went to conster Cum seeing, viuifica crux the liuing
crosse, ostenderit doth shewe. For thus you giue
mee example to play with you. And if one of your
boyes that learned Terence, had so construed, would you
not haue streight way asked him, Cuius modi &amp;
temporis oftenderit, if he had annswered, the Preterperfect
tense: you woulde haue demaunded, whether
doth, be the signe of that temps, or haue. If haue, then haue not you rightly translated Cum crux viuifica illud
sab
                        ••
                      are nobis ostenderit: Seeing the liuing crosse doeth
shewe vnto vs that healthfull thing. Wherefore to
leaue this trifling, the Canon is this: Seeing the
liuing crosse (that is to say the passion of Christ) hath
shewed vnto vs that sauing health, it behoueth vs to
employ all our studie, that we may giue vnto it, by
which we are saued from our olde fall, that honour
which is conuenient. Wherefore, giuing reuerence
vnto it with minde, speache, and vnderstanding. wee
commaund that the figures of the crosse which are
made of some in the ground and pauement, be vtterly
taken away, lest the trophee of our victorie be iniuried
by treading of those that passe ouer it.
               
               
                  
It is not without fraude, yt beside your false translation,
you haue omitted per quam ab antiquo lapsu seruati
sumus, lest euery popish woman might see, that the
Canon speaketh not of honour giuen to the image
of the crosse, whereby we are not saued, but to the
passion of Christ.
               But Martiall reiecteth the Councell of Constantinople
condemning images, as M. Calfhill doth the 2.
of Nice, allowing them. The best way then as Augustine
conncelleth ye heretike Maximinus, were to giue
ouer the hold of Councels on both sides, &amp; try ye matter
by the word of God.
               It is a fond quarrel yt he picketh to M. Calfhill, of ye
time when ye Eliberine councel was kept, if it be auncienter
then hee supposeth, it is of greater credite, for ye
latter times were more corrupt. And whereas he gi
                     •
                  
                  deth
at ye marriage of ministers, because in the 27. Canon
of yt Councel, the bishop or priest was forbidden
to haue any woman to dwell with him, but either his
sister or his daughter being a virgine &amp; professed to
God, he sheweth both his falshod &amp; his folly: his falshod,
for yt he translateth extraneam which is a strange
woman, no other woman. His folly, in seeing ye priests
daughter, he cannot see his wife but the 33. Canon cō
                  mandeth
them abstinence as from their wiues, &amp; begetting
of children. I answere, if ye Canon were not to
be vnderstood of a temporal abstinence, the generall
Councell of Nice decreed against it, as appeareth in
Socrat. lib. 1. Cap. 11.
               But touching the Canon against Images: Placuit,
we decree, that pictures ought not to be in the Church, lest that
which is worshipped &amp; adored, should be painted on the walles.
First he repeteth his principle of law, before set downe
for prohibition, y• pictures are only forbidden, &amp; not
other images: as though he y• forbiddeth wounding
permitteth murthering, beside that, they shuld be simple
images in which were no picture or painting. Secondly,
he saith, that pictures on walles only are forbidden,

but therin he lyeth, for they are generally
forbidden in ye church, ergo not in walles only. Thirdly
he saith, here is an euident proofe, that pictures were then
worshipped. For this argument followeth necessarily vpō these
words. That was worshipped, that was forbidden to be paynted
in the walles: but pictures were forbidden to be painted vpon
walles, ergo, pictures were worshipped. Answere M. Calfhill.
Who would haue thought y• an Vsher of Winchester
&amp; student in Louaine, that teacheth vs an old lawyers
poynt, would also teach vs a new Logike point, to cō
                  clude
affirmatiuely in ye second figure, &amp; yt all vpō particulers?
Answere M. Calf. quod Martial. Nay, answere
goose to such an argument. And reason who will any
longer with such an asse about this matter, for I will
harken to his law, seeing his Logike is no better. For
the better vnderstanding of a statute or a Canon diuerse circumstances
are to be considered. This was lawe ynough
to make him a bachiler. Well the circumstances
are these. The authors of this Canon were Catholike
&amp; wise bishops, the place Granata a citie in Spain,
which had then many infidels, that thought Christians
to commit idolatrie by hauing of Images. The
time when they feared persecution, as appeareth by
the 59 &amp; 60. Canon. But if we beleeue Garanza, your
author, it was about ye time of ye Nicene councel, when
no persecution could be feared; &amp; therfore your cause
which you make ye fourth circūstance, is forged, yt they
feared lest those images should haue ben despitefully
abused by ye Pagans, when they were fled: neither are
you able to proue it, &amp; therfore in ye end you cōclude,
it was but a synod of 19. Bishops, whose decre was vndone
by ye second Nicen general councel, ye Councel at
Frankford. &amp;c. That ye councel of Frankfort yt cōdemned
ye councel of Nice, he only denyeth yt it did so, but
answereth not ye authoritie cited by M. Calfhill. The
booke of Carolus Magnus against images he condē
                  neth
for a forged tale, although ancient writers make
mention of it, &amp; the style of the book doth argue ye it

was written in that time, if not by the Emperour, yet
by his appointment. But seeing he referreth vs to the
confutation of the Apologie fol. 328. I wil referre the
readers to the defence of the Apologie for the same
matter.
               After this, he spendeth certaine leaues, in defending
the credite of Irenee the idolatrous Empresse, and in
defacing those Emperours that were enimies to images,
wherein he hath the idolatrous historians fauourable,
not sparing to report what so euer their malicious
enimies could inuent, to slaunder them. But hereof
I haue written somewhat in myne aunswere to D.
Sanders booke of images cap. 4. or 3. &amp; cap. 15. or. 14.
               Nowe commeth in S. Ambrose extolling the crosse:
Ser. 56. As a Church cannot stand without a crosse, so a
ship is weake without a mast. For by and by the diuell
doth disquiet it, and the wind doth squat it, but when ye
signe of the crosse is set vp, by and by both the iniquitie
of the diuell is beaten backe, and the tempest of
wind is appeased. Here Martial triumpheth against M.
Calfhil, that the author speaketh not of a crosse beame
in the Church, but of the signe of the crosse. But he lyeth
shamefully, for this writer speaketh not of a materiall
Church, Chappel, or Oratorie, but of the congregation
of Christe, in which the crosse and passion of
Christ hath ye same force that the mast in a ship, which
is made after the figure of the crosse, and the plough
beame in tillage &amp;c. His other sentence Serm. 55. is yet
more plaine against him, 
                     Arbor enim quaedam in naui est
crux in ecclesia, quae inter totius saeculi blāda &amp; perniciosa naufragia
incolumis sola seruatur. In hac ergo naui quisquis aut arbori
crucis se religauerie, aut aures suas scripturit diuinis clauserit,
dulcem procellam luxuriae non timebit. For the crosse in
the Church is as it were a certaine tree in a ship, which
among ye flattring &amp; pernitious shipwracks of ye whole
world alone is preserued in safetie. In this ship therefore
who so euer shal either bind him selfe to y• tree of
the crosse, or stop his eares with the holy Scriptures,

he shall not feare the sweete storme of luxuriousnesse,
&amp;c. He alludeth to the fable of Vlysses which tyed
him selfe to the mast, and stopped his eares with waxe,
that he might not heare the song of the Mermaydes.
This sentence (whereof Martial durst cite but three or
foure wordes) declareth that his authour maketh nothing
for the title of this Article of erecting the crosse
in Churches, Chappels &amp;c. And yet when all is
done, I must confesse with the learned, that these Sermons
were not written by S. Ambrose, but by one Maximus
of latter time, Bishop either of Taurinum or
of Millain.
               Concerning the tale that you father vpon syr Ambrose
Caue, of an Island by Rhodes, and a rode there
where no anchor nor cable will holde the ship, vnlesse
the mariner make the signe of the crosse ouer ye place
where he casteth anchor: It may be, he reported it as a
fond persuasion of superstitious people, but I thinke
no that he gaue any credit to it. Poperie is full of such
tales. But why doe you charge M. Calfhil with a lye,
for saying that in the Popish catholike time, the churche
of Pauls was twise burned within 50. yeares space.
Marie, bicause it was not on Corpus Christie eue, nor the Communion
table was burned with al the foure yles within the compasse
of three or foure houres, therefore it was no the like plague.
But howe often hath the sacrament of the alter,
(your God) bene burned, when Churches were fiered?
Moe thinges, in which there is any diuersitie, shall be
like, by Martials logike or lawe, I can not tell whether
it is, by which he condemneth M. Calfhil for a lyer.
               Touching Lactantius, he reasoneth to and fro of
his authoritie him selfe, and yet chargeth M. Calfhil
for so doing. Our iudgement of Lactantius, as of all
olde writers is this, that what so euer they speake contrarie
to the trueth of the holy Scriptures, we may
boldly reiect it; what so euer they say agreeable vnto
them, we doe willingly admit it. The chiefe matter
touching this article, is this, that certaine verses are ascribed

to Lactantius, exhorting men to worship the
crosse, which verses M. Calfhil denieth to haue bene
written by Lactantius. First bicause S. Hierome in the
Catalogue of his works, maketh no mention of them:
but they might be vnknowne to Hierome, saith Martiall.
It is not like they could be vnknowne to Hierome,
and knowne to Martial. Secondly, bicause he
speaketh of Churches, that were scarsly builded in
Lactantius time, but Martial proueth, that Christians
had churches euen in the Apostles time, and euer since,
as though any man doth doubt of yt, but of such churches
as this versifier speaketh of. Thirdly, bicause the
doctrine of these verses, cōcerning images, is contrarie
to yt Lactantius taught, and was generally receiued in
his dayes. Martiall replyeth, that all which Lactantius
did write against images, was against the false images
of the heathen, and not against the holy images of the
Christians. But Christians in his time had no images as
holy, in any vse of religion, and his argumēts are generall
against all images in religion. Finally, it is also
manifest, that his versifier making a Poeticall prosopopeia,
induceth Christe hanging vpon the crosse, and
speaking to him that commeth into the Church, and
therfore no argument of crosse or image may be rightly
gathered out of the poeme, who so euer was the author.
For immediatly after this verse, Flecte genu, lignúmque
crucis venerabile adora, followeth: Flebilis innocuo terrámque
cruore madentem, Ore petens humilis, lachrymis suffunde
subortis. Bowe thy knee, worship the venerable wood of
ye crosse, And lamentably kissing with humble mouth
the earth which is moyst with myne innocent bloud,
wash it ouer with teares flowing out. By these verses
then Martial may as wel proue, that the Church floore
was moyst with the bloud of Christe, as that there was
a crosse in the Church.
               To Lactantius he ioineth Augustine, De Sanctis Hom.
19. saying. that Churches are dedicated with the signe
of the crosse, where he not onely chaunged the worde

                  charactere into mysterio, but also translated the worde
mysterio, by the signe: where he confesseth his fault, he
may be pardoned, but where he iustifieth mysterio and
sign
                        •
                     
                   to be all one, he sheweth him selfe as he is. But
howe will he persuade vs, that those Homilies de tempore
and de Sanctis, of which some one is ascribed to so
many authours, were either written by Augustine, or
by any of those times, the stile is so dissonant, that any
man learned, and of indifferent iudgement, will confesse.
Although it is not to be denyed, but the signe of
the crosse was superstitiously abused, even in the dayes
of Augustine, and long before Whereas Augustine reporteth
of a woman called Innocentia, which had a
canker healed in her brest by the signe of the crosse,
if it were a miracle, it proueth not, that euery Church,
Chappell, and Oratorie, should haue a crosse. Great
miracles were done by imposition of handes, yet it
followeth not therefore, that euery Church must haue
imposition of handes. Againe, not onely Cankers,
but also Fistulaes, tooth ache, and many other diseases
haue bene healed by charmes. And yet these
charmes are not iustifiable thereby, much lesse to be
brought into the Church, as wholesome ceremonies
and prayers.
               But albeit the crosse be no ordinarie meane, whereby
God vseth to conserue health (saith Martial) yet
may you not conclude, that he hath not ordained it
to remaine in the Church, for any remembrance of his
death and passion. For thinke you (saith he) he hath
left no more meanes but the preaching of his worde,
which euery one can heare? Yes, it hath pleased his maiestie
to ordaine by general Councels the signe of the
crosse, and images to be a meane to put vs in remembrance
of Christes death &amp;c. But seeing ye Church flourished
300. yeares without a general Councel, and neither
that general Councel which was first holden, not
three other which folowed, make mention of any such
matter, where was the ordinance of God by generall

Councels for the crosse? He will say it had the appointment
of the prelates of the Church. Which? and when?
euery idle ceremonie and vngodly heresie that preuailed
had ye prelates of the Church either for the authors
or for the approuers. But Christ committed to the prelates
(saith Martial) the charge and gouernment of his
Church. Yea syr, to feede them with his word, and not
with dombe signes and dead images, which things he
hath forbidden.
               Now come we to Paulinus Bish. of Nola, by whom
it appeareth that ye signe of the crosse was set vp 1100.
yeres agoe, in some churches: but the title of the Article
is, that it should be set vp in al Churches. But Martial
wil proue, that it was wel done by Paulinus, to set
vp the signe of the crosse in his Church, bicause he was an
holy and learned Bishop, and no Catholike Bishop or generall
councel did find fault with him: for whatsoeuer any holy &amp; learned
father did at any time, and was not controlled of any Catholike
father for his doing, was well done, and must be so taken. I
denye this maior, For Augustine was an holy and
learned Bishop, which did giue the Communion to
infants, and thought it necessarie for their euerlasting
saluation: neither was he controlled therefore,
yet did he not well, neither was his opinion true. And
where Martial taketh vpon him the defence of Paulinus,
in commending a woman that separated her selfe
from her husband vnder pretence of religion, he playeth
the prattling proctor, picking of quarels against
M. Calfhil, without all honestie or shame, For he feigneth
that the fault is alledged, for want of consent of
her husband, whereas such separation as he cōmendeth
wtout consent, is directly contrarie to the doctrine of ye
holy Ghost, 1. Cor. 7. v. 5. Likewise where M. Calfhil
nameth a booke that the Apostles wrote, Martial saith
it was but of Pauls Epistles: where he saith it was laide
vnto diseases, M. Martial saith it saued a man from
drowning, but of these quarels too much. Martiall
cōfesseth, that were a Doctor swarueth frō scripture,

no man ought to followe him. But if Paulinus swerued
not from Scripture, when he brought images into
the Church, we neede not doubt that any man swerued
from Scripture, seeing nothing is more plaine in all
the Scriptures, then forbidding of images and similitudes
of any thing to be made or had in any vse of
religion.
               Where M. Chlfhil aunswereth to the decree of Iustinian
(that no Church should be builded before the
place were consecrated, and a crosse set vp by the Bishop)
that this was a constitution of the externall pollicie,
Martial laboureth to proue that it was religious,
and yet at length graunteth that it was a matter of externall
policie, wherevpon I inferre, that it was not of
necessitie, and so the article is not proued thereby, that
euery church should &amp;c. But it commeth of great wisdome,
that he will defend the time of Iustinian from
ignorance and barbaritie, bicause the ciuill lawe was
then gathered, and a fewe learned men were found in
the whole world. All this notwithstanding, the Barbarians
had ouercome a great part of the Empire, and filled
the world with ignorance and barbarousnesse. Against
the decree of Valentinian and Theodosius cited
out of Crinitus, he hath many quarells. First against
Petrus Crinitus, who was as good a cleark as Martial,
Then at the Homily against images, where the Printer
calleth him Petrus Erinilus, yet againe ye Valentinian
not being writtē at large, is mistakē for Valens, where
it should be Valentinianus. And if Valens and Theodosius
had made such a l

suppresse it? When Eusebius was deade before any of
them were borne, it was a great ouerfight in Martials
iudgement, to suppresse in his storie a lawe made by
them, which liued neare an hundreth yeare after him,
so that belike he would haue Eusebius to write stories
of thinges to come. But concerning that lawe of Valentinianus
and Theodosius, you shall see more in
mine aunswere to D. Sanders booke of images. cap.

13. or 12. The rest of this chapter is spent in commending
the Church of Rome, whose custome it hath bene
(saith Martial) these twelue hundreth yeares, to set the
signe of the crosse in the Church, and Pope Pius the
fourth did it him selfe of late &amp;c. Concerning the
Church of Rome, so long as she continued in true religion,
and so far foorth as she mainteined the trueth,
as she was greatly commended of auncient writers,
whome Martiall nameth: so nowe it is to her greater
reproch and shame, earum laudum &amp; gloriae degenerem esse,
that she is growen out of kinde and desert of all such
prayses: as the Cleargie of Rome writing to Cyprian,
lib. 2. Epist. 7. To conclude, therefore, there is nothing
shewed to proue that euery Church, Chappel, or Oratorie
should haue a crosse, although in the latter and
more corrupt times of the Church, it is declared, that
some Churches had a crosse, and at length grewe to a
custome in those parts of the world, that euerie church
had one, and was thought necessarie that it should
haue one.
            
            
               The fourth Article.
               That the signe of the crosse was vsed in all sacraments &amp;c.Martial.
               
               That it hath bene vsed in the later declining times,Fulke.
we will not stande with Martiall, but that in the
best and purest age of the Church, by the Apostles and
their imediate successors it was vsed, or allowed before
the Valentinian heretikes, I affirme, that Martiall can
not proue by any auncient authenticall writer, betweene
the Apostles and Irenaeus. Wherefore Master
Calfhil aunswereth well, that the ceremonie once taken
vppe of good intent, being growen into so horrible
abuse, is iustly refused of vs. Martiall will knowe
what our vocation is, as though we were not able to
proue our calling both before God and men. Our Synodes
he refuseth, bicause no Councel can be kept

without the consent of the Bishop of Rome, in which
point as many of Papistes are against him, which
holde that euen a generall Councel may be kept to
depose an euill Pope, against his will: so he mistaketh
the Tripartite historie and Iulian Bishop of Rome,
where they speake of generall Councels and Synodes,
to determine of matters of faith, from which the Bishop
of Rome while he was a Bishop, was not to be
excluded, bicause those cases touch all Bishops, dreaming
that they speake of all Councels. But long after
their times, it was practised as lawfull, for Kinges and
Bishops of seuerall prouinces, to gather and holde prouincial
synods, for the state of their seueral Churches,
without the consent or knowledge of the Bishop of
Rome. In which some things haue bene determined against
the will of the Bishop of Rome, as in the councels
of Carthage and Affrike, and in generall Councels
also, as in that of Calcedon, Constantinople the 5. &amp; 6.
the Councels of Constans and Basil. But signing with
the crosse is a tradition of the Apostles, and so accounted
by S. Basil, therefore we ought not to forsake it
for any abuse (saith Martial. But howe will S. Basil persuade
vs of that, when we finde it not in their writings:
it is more safe therefore, to followe his counsell in his
short definitiōs q. 1. where he affirmeth, yt it is not lawfull
for any man to permit him selfe to doe or say any
thing without the testimonie of the holy scriptures.
And this we will hold euen with Basils good leaue, against
all pretended traditions of the Apostles what so
euer. We Knowe the Apostle willeth vs to hold the traditions,
either learned by his Epistles, or by his Sermōs.
But what he deliuered in his sermons, we can not
tell, but by his Epistles. Yes, saith Martial, the church
telleth you of ye signe of the crosse, but seeing ye church
telleth vs of other things, which are left and forsaken,
auouching them likewise to be traditions of the Apostles,
which ought not to haue ben so giuē ouer, if they
had ben Apostolike traditions in deed, we see no cause
why we may not refuse these, aswel as those, hauing no

ground of certaintie for apostolike traditions, but only
ye Apostolike writings. Tertullian coūteth ye tasting
of milke &amp; hony after baptisme, for an Apostolike tradition,
bicause it was a ceremonie in his time, as wel as
crossing, ye one was left long ago, why may not ye other
be forsakē yt hath no better ground, &amp; hath ben worse
abused? Concerning the tale of Probianus, which foloweth
next after this discourse, I wil referr the reader to
mine answere to D. Sand. booke against images, c1. 13.
or 12. after ye error of his print, where Calfhil thinketh
it not meete, yt should be restrained to that whereof
there is no precept in scripture, nor they them selues
yeld lawful cause, Marti. telleth him, yt he must be restrained,
if he will be good Christian. For there is no
precept in expresse scripture to beleue three persons &amp;
one God in ye blessed Trinitie, ye equalitie of substance
of Christ with his father in his godhead &amp;c. The pertual
virginitie of Marie, ye keping of ye Sunday, ye sacrament
receiuing fasting, ye baptisme of infants &amp;c. you
see what an Atheist he is, yt can find no more certaintie
in ye scriptures, for ye blessed Trinitie, then for S. Maries
virginitie: for the godhed of Christ, then for receiuing
ye Cōmunion before other meates. If Papistes haue no
ground to their faith out of the scriptures, yet we can
proue what so euer is necessarie for vs to beleeue. It he
dalie vpō ye word expresse scripture, either he answereth
not to ye same thing wherof he is demanded, or else he
knoweth not yt an argument rightly concluded out of
holy scripture, is as good as ye very words of ye scripture,
as when I say, if Peter beleued &amp; was baptized ergo, he
was saued, is as true, as these words, whosoeuer beleueth
&amp; is baptized, shall be saued. To ye second demand, whether
ye ancient fathers did attribute such vertue to the
wagging of a finger, yt the holy Ghost could be called
downe, &amp; ye diuell driuen away by it. Mart. answereth: it
is most euident, that as soone as praier is duly made, &amp; the signe
of the crosse made, the holy Ghost according to the promise of
Christ, commeth downe &amp; sanctifieth &amp;c. and the diuel is driuē
away. This is Mart. euidence, other reason he bringeth

If he referre the promise and comming of the holy
Ghost to prayer, he playeth the palterer, that being demanded
of the crosse, answereth of praier. Otherwise,
let him shewe what promise Christ hath made to the
signe of the crosse, or to prayer with the signe of the
crosse, more then without it. If he can not, you may
easily see his pouertie. To the thirde, whether they
would haue refused the Church and sacraments for
want of a crosse, He beleeueth verily they would not: for the
sacraments lacketh not the vertue if the signe of the crosse be omitted:
yet the fault is great when the tradition of the Apostles
is wilfully reiected. Whether it be like they deliuered any
needlesse or vnprofitable ceremonie, let wise men
iudge. After this, followeth a long and foolish dialogisme,
about the interpretation of Cyprians wordes.
What so euer the ministers of the sacraments be, what so euer
the handes are that dippe those that come to baptisme, what so
euer the brest is, out of which the holy wordes proceede, the authoritie
of operation giueth effect to all sacraments in the figure
of the crosse, and the name which is aboue all names, being
called vpon, by dispensers of the sacraments doth all. Martial
so scanneth these wordes, as though M. Calfhil
knewe not the difference betweene the power of
God, and the ministerie of man in the sacraments, whiche
Cyprian doth plainly distinguish in these wordes.
But to the purpose, Cyprian seemeth to make the figure
of the crosse a meane by which God worketh in
the sacraments. But in deede hee meaneth, that all sacraments
take their effect of the passion of Christ, as a
bare signe and token whereof they vsed the figure of
the crosse, and not as a meane whereby God worketh,
seeing it is confessed by Martial, that the sacraments if
the signe of the crosse be omitted lacke not their vertue. An other
foolish brable and vsherlike construing, he maketh
of Cyprians words, de baptismo Verborum solemnitas
&amp; sacri inuocatio nominis, &amp; signa attributa institutionibus
Apostolicis sacerdotum ministerijs visibile sacramentum celebrant.
For reprouing Master Calfhil for translating

                  signa attributa institutionibus apostolicis, signes attributed
to the institutions of the Apostles, he teacheth
him to conster signes attributed by the Apostolicall
institutions, through the ministerie of the priestes. Wherein I
maruell that such an auncient student, will nowe suffer
the word attributa, to goe without a datiue case,
which I thinke he would not haue done in his pettite
schoole at Winchester. But if I might be bolde vnder ye
correction of such a grounded grammarian, to conster
the lesson ouer againe, I would giue the Latine this
English. The solemnitie of wordes and inuocation of
the holy name, and the signes appointed by the institutions
of the Apostles, for the ministerie of the priestes,
doth make the visible sacramēt. And what be those
signes? By M. Martials leaue, the elements, as water,
breade and wine. But then M. Grindal (whom I laugh
to see this wise Dialogue maker, to bring in swearing,
once or twise in this deuised talke, as though out Bishops
vsed that veine, as commonly as Popish prelats)
M. Grindal I say, must send me to Saint Anthonies
schoole, bicause the elements of the sacraments be of
Christes owne institution, and not of his Apostles,
wherfore those signes must be other goodly ceremonies,
and the signe of the crosse must not be lest. But if
Martial euer were a scholler in that schoole, or any other
of any value, he might haue learned long agoe,
that institutio signifieth not onely the first beginning
of an ordinance, but also a teaching or doctrine: and so
doth Cyprian meane, that by the doctrine of the Apostles,
ye Priestes are appointed to vse those signes, which
if Martials Vshership will not admit, Cyprian in telling
what maketh ye visible sacramēt, hath left out the
principal part thereof, namely the element, and that
which in deede in it is onely visible, for the solemnitie
of wordes and inuocation are audible rather then
visible. But in this foolish Dialogue is cited Iustinus
Apol. 2. to proue that the olde Fathers vsed the signe
of the crosse, in all sacraments. Iustinus Martyr (saith he

in the place of M. Grindal) talking of the crosse, biddeth vs
viewe in our mindes, and consider with reason, all thinges that
are in the worlde, and see whether sine haec figura administrentur,
they may be done without this signe. How like it is that
M. G. shold say, Iustinus biddeth vs, when he biddeth ye
Gentiles, I leaue to speake of. But that he speaketh of
our sacramentes, how will Martiall prooue? When
both he speaketh to the Heathen, and of Heathenishe
customes and ceremonies, or els ciuill and naturall
matters. As of sayling, plowing, digging and all handie
craftes, whose tooles had some figure of the crosse,
in which the Gentiles did so fondely abhorre and
despise Christ for it. Whereas it was to be found euen
in the shape of man, in the trophees and standerdes of
their Emperour, in the consecration of their dead Emperours
images, whom they worshipped as Gods. For
which causes Iustinus thought it vnreasonable, that
they should contemne Christ for his crosses sake. But
of vsing the signe of the crosse in all sacramentes there
is no mention in Iustinus. That in Chrysostomes time
&amp; other more ancient fathers, ye signe of ye crosse was vsed
at the celebration of the sacramentes, M. Calfhil
granteth as a ceremonie, &amp; you confesse, It is but a ceremonie,
and that our sacramentes lacking the signe of the crosse,
and that vsual ceremonie be perfect notwithstanding. And
yet you exclaime against vs for omitting a needelesse
ceremonie, where we see it hath bene turned from that
indifferent vsage of the forefathers, into an idolatrous
custome &amp; opiniō of necessitie. The credite of Dionysiꝰ
for so ancient a scholler of S. Paul as you would make
him, it too much cracked by Erasmus to be cured by
Martial. Where M. Calfhil truly faith, &amp; you can not
deny, but he hath as good authoritie, for honie, mike,
wine, to be restored in baptisme, and the communion
to be giuen to children, as you haue for the crosse: you
aunswere, these were altered by the Church of Rome,
which hath authoritie so to do, ye crosse stil remaineth:
but marke what you say, were these traditions of the Apostles?

if you say no, ye like wil I say of the crosse, for ye
same authoritie cōmendeth thē al a like, for traditions
of the Apostles. Wel if they were traditions of ye Apostles
by the holy Ghost, which you hold to be of equal
authoritie wt yt scriptures, &amp; ye Church of Rome hath abolished
the one, why may she not abolish the other?
so yt your answer conteineth manifest blasphemie. To
fortifie your traditions, you alledge yt Iesus did many
thinges which are not written, &amp;c. but you leaue of yt
which foloweth, but these are written, yt you might be
leeue, &amp; in beleeuing haue eternal life. Io. 20. &amp; yet S.
Iohn speketh of miracles, not of ceremonies to be vsed
in baptisme, wherunto you apply it. But Iesus himself
saith, he hath many things to say that ye apostles could
not then beare, &amp;c. Ioan. 16. And you would know in
what worke of the Apostles those thinges are written,
yea you would haue the Chapter noted. Pleaseth it
you to looke your selfe in the Actes of the Apostles,
and in their Epistles, &amp;c. And you shall finde, that the
scriptures will instruct the man of God vnto all good
works, &amp; make him wise vnto saluation, if these wil not
serue your turn, seeke where you wil, &amp; find ye deuil &amp;
eternal damnatiō. But I pray you, could not ye apostles
beare yt hearing of the signe of the crosse, of salt, oyle,
spittle in baptisme, were these such harde lessons to
learn, or heauy to beare? if you think they were, I enuy
not vnto you so wise a thought. But you will teach vs
how we shal know, yt these are traditions of ye apostles,
to this inquire you answer, euen as we know ye gospels
&amp; epistles to be ye Canonical scriptures, by authoritie of
ye church, which you think sufficient for yt purpose. But
so do not we, for although we receiue the testimony of
ye Church, yet we haue greater authoritie out of ye scriptures
of ye old Testamēt, &amp; yt spirit by which they were
writē, being alwais ye same by which we are perswaded
yt ye gospels &amp; epistles are the holy scriptures. Againe ye
vniuersal Church of all times &amp; places giueth witnes
to those writings, so doeth it not to these traditions.
               
                  
Therefore we are neuer the neare to knowe Apostolical
traditions, by authoritie of the Popish church,
whiche ascribeth thinges manifestly contrary to the
worde of God and writinges of the Apostles, to Apostolike
traditions, as Images, halfe communion, priuate
Masse, &amp;c. After this brabbling of traditions, followeth
a long brawle about numbers, which the Papistes
do superstitiously obserue, and of the authoritie
of the seuentie interpreters, whose translation if it
were extant, no doubt but it were worthie of great reuerence,
but seeing these questions are fruitelesse, and
impertinent vnto the article, I wil clearely omit them:
Martial returning to proue that the signe of the crosse
was vsed in consecrating the body and bloud of Christ,
findeth himselfe greatly greeued, that M. Calfhil calleth
the Masse the sacrifice of the deuil, wherein be so
many good things, as the Collets, Gospel, epistle, Gloria
in Excelsis, &amp;c. by which reasō I might proue a diuelish
coniuration in which be so many names of God, and
good words, to be an holy peece of worke. Therfore it
is not many good parts abused to make a wicked thing
good, that can iustifie the Masse, which is an hurrible
blasphemie against the death and onely sacrifice of
Christ. But M. Calfhil doth not satisfie him, where he
citing out of Albertus Magnus, That Christ did blesse the
sacrament with a certeine signe of his hand, as Iacob laide his
hands on Iosephs sons, and Christ laid his hands vpon the children,
&amp; lifted vp his hands, &amp; blessed his Apostles, &amp;c. asketh
why we might not say Christ made a signe of ye crosse,
considering that Chrisostome, Augustine, and Euthymus
testifie, that in their time, the signe of ye crosse was
vsed in consecration, this question (he saith) is not soluted.
This is sone answered, because laying on of hands,
and lifting vp of handes, which be sometime vsed in
blessing, doth not proue a crossing with the finger:
of ones hand, as the Papistes vse, and because the Euangelistes
which describe all that he then saide or did for
vs to followe, make no mention of any such signe of

hand made by him in blessing. The long discourse
that followeth of blessing and giuing of thankes, is
needelesse, for we know and confesse, that as they somtimes
signifie all one thing, so they differ sometimes: &amp;
we confesse that the bread and wine in the Lords supper
were blessed, that is to say sanctified and consecrated
but not with any signe of hand, which is the mater
in question, but with the worde of God, and with
prayer: not onely as bodily meates, but as heauenly
and spirituall mysteries, to feede the soule. But it is a
sport to see, how Martiall when he hath prooued that
which was not in question, that the bread &amp; wine were
blessed &amp; sanctified by Christ, &amp; that they must nowe
be so consecrated by the Church, he runneth away with
the signe of the Crosse, whereof he hath brought no
proofe of the vse by Christ: saying, There must be consecration
by honouring the wordes of Christ, and calling vpon his
name, &amp; making the signe of the crosse, which maner of cōsecration
the Church learned of Christ, &amp; hath continued euer since:
so that we may boldly say with Albertus. He blest it with a certeine
signe of his hand. But I pray you sir, where learned
you this signe vsed by Christ? How proue you that it
hath bene vsed ever since? It is inough for Martiall to
say, that all the learning in English Doctours will neuer be able
to proue this assertion of his to be friuolous.
               
               But seeing he is so Greekish, to teach M. Calfhil to
conster Saint Paules wordes? 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &amp;c.
and findeth fault with him for giuing the aoristes the
signification of the present temps, let him looke in his
lexicon, where I weene al his Greeke is, how he will abide▪
by this saying: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  in Saint Matthew, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
in Saint Luke, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in Saint Paule, haue relation to the
bread and wine, and answere to the question whom or what▪
                  
seeing 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   is no verbe transitiue, although the
Christian writers, as Iustinus Martir, hath fayned a
passiue vnto it.
               Again in the saying of Chrysostom Ho. 24. in 1. Cor.
Cap. 10. where Martiall will haue vs marke that the

body of Christ is seeene vpon the altar, let him &amp; his
felowes marke, that if it be none otherwise there, then
as it is seene, it is present onely to the faith, by whose
eye it is seene.
               After this tedious treatise of bleassing and thankesgiuing,
he commeth to his olde petition or principle,
that the signing with the crosse is a tradition of the
Apostles: and angry he is, that he should be called on
to proue yt it is a tradition of the Apostles, whereof he
can finde no mention in Ecclesiastical writers before ye
Valentinian heretikes. And wheras Cyprian Ad Panpeium
calleth all traditions to the writings &amp; commandement
of the Apostles, he crieth out yt Cyprian is slandered,
because he him selfe alledgeth the tradition of
Christ for mingling of water with ye wine. If Cyprian
breake his own rule, who can excuse him? But if he had
ben vrged as much for the necessitie of water, as he was
for the necessitie of wine in ye sacrament, he wold haue
better considered of the matter. Frō this matter he descendeth
to proue the number of sacramentes to be
seuen, because matrimony is of some olde writers called
a sacrament, when they meane not a sacrament in yt
sense that baptisme is a sacrament, but generally a mistery.
And because M. Calfhil saith, that sacramentes
were signes ordeined of God to confirme our faith, he
wil proue yt we haue no sacraments at all, because baptisme
if it be ministred to men of yeares, confirmeth
not their faith, for they must haue their faith cōfirmed
before they be baptised, &amp; so must they that receiue ye
communion. But when infantes be baptised they haue
no faith but the faith of the Church, &amp; therefore their
faith can not be confirmed. Did you euer heare such a
filthy hogge grunt so beastly of the holy sacraments,
that they shold be no helps of our father. We beleue yt
infants, although they haue no faith whē they are baptised,
yet haue their faith cōfirmed by their baptisme euē
to their liues end. And yt they which come to ye Lordes

                     •
                  able wt a true faith in Gods promises, haue ye same cō
                  firmed

by the seale of his word which is that holy sacrament.
Martial calleth for scriptures. Among a thousand
texts, this one shal serue: Abrahā receiued yt signe
of circumcision, a seale of the righteousnes of faith,
which he had being vncircumcised, Rom. 4. v. 11. Tell
vs Martiall by thy lawe, wherefore a seale serueth, if
not for confirmation? But what should I talke with
them of faith, which as they haue none in the promises
of God, so they knowe not what in meaneth.
               To that reason of Master Calfhill, that Matrimonie
bath no promise of forgiuenesse of sinnes, he answereth,
denying that euery sacrament hath a promise
of forgiuenesse of sinnes annexed, and afterward he
asketh where hath the supper of our Lorde a promise
of remission of sinnes? for sinnes are forgiuen before
the sacrament be receiued. Is this ye diuinitie of Louaine?
is the holy supper auayleable neither for confirmation
of faith, nor to forgiuenesse of sinnes?
               Wherfore saith Christ of the cupp? This is my bloud
of the newe Testament which is shed for many vnto
forgiuenesse of sinnes. Nay (sayth Martiall) if there be a
remission of sines, then is it a sacrament propitiatorie, contrary
to your owne doctrine. Nothing the sooner, so long as
remission of sinnes be not tyed to the work wrought,
according to your heresie, but sealed vnto the faith of
the worthie receiuer. Likewise he quarrelleth against
that reason, that Matrimonie conferreth no grace,
which is easily proued by this, that Matrimony is
good being contracted among Gentyles &amp; heathen
persons. And whereas he bringeth in the blessing of
God to married persons, either they be such as pertein
to all men in general, &amp; so proue no grace of mariage
in ye church, or else to ye faithful only, &amp; so pertaine to
faith &amp; not to marriage: as yt the faithful woman shall
be saued by bringing forth of children. The questiō
of marriage after deuorcement, because it pertaineth
not to ye Crosse I wil not meddle with it, M. Calfhill
hath sayd more then Martial can answere.
               
                  
Touching the popish sacrament of penance, which
Martiall and not S. Hierome calleth the second table
after shipwracke. M. Calfhil hath likewise proued
effectually, that it is no sacrament of Christs Church:
Against which, Martiall bringeth nothing but certein
sentences of scripture, to proue how necessary repentance
is after men haue sinned, to obteine remission of
sinnes. Whereof S. Hierome speaketh, and not of Popish
penance, consisting of contrition, confession, and
satisfaction, with their blasphemous absolution.
               Concerning extreme vnction, that it is no perpetual
sacrament of the Church, it is plaine by scripture
because the gift of healing which was annexed vnto
ye annoynting of oyle, spoken of in S. Iames, hath long
agoe ceased: Wherefore it followeth, that the same
ceremonie of annoynting was temporall, euen as the
promise of bodily health that was ioyned to it, was
temporall. Finally, touching the Councel of Trent,
that hath allowed all these for sacraments, how lawfull
it was, whē he that was accused for heresie, should
be the onely Iudge, I thinke Martiall by his lawe
could discusse if he list. And as for the saueconduit
graunted to the Protestants, they haue learned by the
case of I. Hus and Hierom of Prage, to trust the faith
of Papistes, as much as they like their religion. To
conclude, there is nothing prooued in this article,
which pretended, that the crosse was alwayes vsed
in the sacraments. And it is confessed, that when it is
vsed, it is but a ceremonie, and such as the want therof
taketh not away the effect of the sacraments, wherfore
seeing the sacraments are perfect without it, they
are not to be condemned, which vpon good grounde
and sufficient authoritie haue refused it.
            
            
               The fifth Article.
               
                  That the Apostles &amp; fathers of the primitiue Church blessed
them selues with the signe of the crosse,
                  Martiall. 
                  &amp; councelled all

Christian men to do the same, and that in those dayes a crosse
was set vp in euery place conuenient for it.
               
               The first controuersie is of the signification of this
worde benedicere,
                  Fulke. which with Martiall is all one with
signare. For although he finde not in the olde writers,
benedicebant se signo crucis, they did blesse them selues
with the signe of the crosse, yet he findeth signabant se
signo crucis, they marked them selues with the signe of
the crosse, which is all one with him. But not so with
vs: for there was another vse of marking at the firste,
then for blessing. The Christians among the Pagans,
marked them selues with the signe of the crosse, in token
that they professed him that was crucified. Afterward
to put them selues in minde of the death of
Christ. These were tollerable vses of an indifferent
ceremonie. The opinion of blessing with the crosse,
as M. Calfhil sayeth, was taken (as the terme) from
superstitious olde women. And Martiall cannot denye,
but the terme of blessing in that sence, is a newe
signification of the worde, and therefore not vsed of
the auncient fathers, which that he might obscure
with brabling, as his custome is, he repeateth his former
iangling of the significations of this worde benedicere,
and howe it sometime signifieth to blesse with
the handes, as when Christe blessed his Apostles and
the children. As though to vse a ceremonie of lifting
vp, or laying on of hands, when he blesseth, is to blesse
with a bare ceremonie of the handes, as they do with
their crosse. Nay, he sayeth, to blesse with the crosse
is as olde as Iacob, who with his handes acrosse blessed
Iosephs children. The Papistes are wise in their
generation, when they would not haue vnlearned mē
to reade the scriptures. For euerye childe of seuen
yeares age, reading the storie of Iacobs blessing, will
easely perceiue, yt his laying of his hands ouerthwart,
was not for any blessing with the crosse, but because
he was to lay his right hand vpon the yonger, and his

left vpon the elder, contrary to their fathers placing
of them, which would haue had his elder sonne preferred.
But seeing Martiall maketh himselfe so cunning
in the significations of benedicere, to blesse, which
he will not haue to say well, or pray for only, &amp;c. but
to sanctifie. Let him remember, that in his own sence,
the Apostle sayeth to the Hebrues, cap. 7. ver. 7. yt which
is lesse or inferior is blessed of the superior, by which
argument, he proueth Melchisedech to be greater
then Abraham. If then the Apostles and fathers did
blesse them selues with the signe of the crosse to sanctifie
themselues, I demaunde, whether the signe of ye
crosse was greater then the Apostles. For no man wil
saye that the Apostles were greater then themselues.
If it were not greater, then surely they were not blessed
by it Wherein also the fable of Abdias is conuinced,
which sayth of S. Paul: muniens se signo crucis,
arming himselfe with the signe of the crosse. was the signe
of the crosse stronger then S. Paul? for men arm them
selues with harnesse of defence, which is stronger then
them selues. Was not that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that vniuersal armour
or complete harnes, which he exhorteth other
men to put on as sufficient to withstande all the assaultes
of the diuell,Eph. 6. sufficient for him selfe without
the signe of the crosse But seing ye Apostle there describeth
ye whole armor of God, whereof the signe of ye
crosse is not piece. It is certaine, that it is no armour
meete for the defence of a Christian man: wherefore
your fabling Abdias, and counterfait Clement can
carry no credit with wise &amp; learned Christians. Nor
yet the examples of Antony, Martin, Donatus, &amp; Paula
reported of credible writers, yet no Euangelists, which
armed themselues with the signe of the crosse, doeth
either force or moue vs to imitatiō, further then they
had warrant for their doing out of the holy scriptures.
               Where M. Calfhill sayeth, that the diuel delighted
in the signe of the crosse, &amp; fayned him selfe to be afrayd

of it, that the heremit might runne to that sory
succour, and men put more affiance in it. He meaneth
that the diuel delighted in the superstitious opinion
of it: for otherwise he doth neither feare nor loue the
signe of the crosse of it selfe: for if it had beene so
terrible to the diuell as Martial and others do thinke,
Saint Paul would not haue left it out of the complet
harnes of God, whereby all the deceites &amp; fiery darts
of the diuell are withstood.
               And although the elder and better age vsed and receiued
that signe tolerably, yet considering the shamfull
abuse thereof, it ought now of right &amp; conscience
to be condemned, as M. Calfhill sayeth. But Martiall
wil none of that, for things good of their own nature,
must not be taken away not condemned for ye abuse.
Very true, but who will graunt him, that the signe of
the crosse is good of it selfe? It is as much as may be
borne, to grant it to be a thing indifferent. And wheras
Martial wil acknowledge none abuse of that signe,
what else should we say, but who is so blind as he yt
wil not see? Concerning the authoritie of the Epistle
of Epiphanius translated by S. Hierome, &amp; his fact in
rending a vaile wherein was painted an image, as it
were of Christ, or some saint, &amp;c. I will referre ye reader
to mine answere to D. Sanders booke of images,
Cap. 4. or according to the error of his print, Cap. 3.
where he shal see all Martials cauils shaken of, except
one, which I thinke no man euer espyed before this
wylye lawyer, and that is of the words, quasi, hauing
an image as it were of Christ or some saint, but not an
image of Christ or of some saint in deede, for then he
woulde not haue rent it, but perhaps in was an
image of Iupiter, or Hercules, &amp;c. But vnder correction
of Master Vsher, this is but a quasy argument
that is grounded vpon quasi, as though it should
signifie always a thing yt is not true, but as it were so &amp;
yet not so. For Cicero yt knew ye nature of ye word quasi
as wel as Martial, vseth it otherwise, Illos qui oīa incer
                        ••
                     
                     
dicunt, quasi desperatos aliquos relinquamus. As for them
that saye: all things are vncerteine let vs leaue, as mē
past hope. Wil Martiall say they were not past hope
in deede? S. Marke sayeth, that Christ did teache quasi
potestatem habens,
                  Mar. 1. as one that had authoritie, wil he say
he had not authoritie in deede.Iohn. 1. S. Iohn saith of Christ,
who haue seene his glory, quasi vnigeniti, as the glorye
of the onely begotten sonne of God. Let Martiall
saye with the Arrians, he was but quasi vnigenitus, as it
were the onely begotten sonne of God, and not he in
deede.
               Againe, he sayeth, Cùm fecisset quasi flagellum, when
he had made as it were a scourge, master Vsher will
conster it so, that was not a scourge in deede, because
he sayeth, as it were a scourge. But Martiall will still
vrge the fact of Paula in worshipping the crosse of
Christ, vntill it be shewed out of Epiphanius by better
euidence then yet is shewed, that he woulde haue
no crosse, no crucifixe, nor image in the Church. A mā
would thinke this were sufficient euidence, when hee
sayeth: Cùm ergo hoc vidissem in ecclesia Christi, contra authoritatem
scripturarum hominis pendere imaginem, &amp;c.
Wherefore, when I sawe this, that in the Church of
Christe did hang an image of a man, contrary to the
authoritie of the scriptures, I rent it, &amp;c. Further euidence
out of Epiphanius you may see in the place before
cited.
               Martiall would haue vs make a Kalender of Christian
men, that refused to blesse them selues with the
crosse, which were 
                     〈◊〉
                   infinite matter, seeing from the
Apostles vnto the Valentinian heretikes it is not read,
that any such estimation was of the crosse, yt it should
be any blessing or confirmation. Master Calfhils
rule, that we must liue not after examples but after
lawes, meaning, not followe what soeuer hath beene
done by good men, but whatsoeuer was well done,
according to the lawe of God, Martiall reiecteth vpō
vaine, foolish, and friuolous reasons, as that some examples

are to be followed, that the lawe serueth not
for a iust man, that custome must be followed where
lawe faileth, &amp;c. Beside that he slaundereth Luther, as
one that would haue all lawes and orders of Princes
put awaye. Againe, whereas M. Calfhill sheweth that
the fathers taught other things more oft &amp; more earnestly
then the vse of the crosse. As that it was a wickednesse
to fast on Sonday, or to pray on our knees,
beside the oblations on birthdayes, milke, and hony,
with the communion giuen to infants, &amp;c. Martiall
answereth, these are abrogated by the church: this is
not. But seing none of them hath ben in worse abuse
then this custome of crossing, this ought to be abrogated
of euery church, as well as those. But whereas
Martiall compareth the doctrine of S. Paul. 1. Cor. 11.
for couering or vncouering of men &amp; womens heads,
and the decree of ye Apostles for bloud and strangled,
Act. 15. with those abrogated customes, he doth verye
lewdly, for beside yt the authoritie of ye one is certeine,
the other vncerteine, &amp; of some forged: the doctrine
of S. Paul as he there deliuereth it, is perpetuall, &amp; the
decree of the Apostles was neuer ment of them, but to
be temporall, for auoiding offence of the Iewes. As
touching the credit of the olde writers who had all
their errors, we like well ye councell of Vincentius Lyrinensis,
yt we should stil haue recourse for triall, to ye
most ancient, in which we must needes accompt ye writings
of the Apostles, both of moste antiquitie and of
greatest authoritie. Wherefore seeing the manner of
blessing with the crosse is not found either in the writings
of the Apostles, or in the most auncient fathers,
Iustinus, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, by Vincentius
councel, we may iustly accompt it for a corrupt
custome, crept into the church, either by aemulation
of heretikes, or in contention against the Paganes. But
Martiall slaundereth vs, and the Apollogie of the
church of England, that the chiefe cause of our seperation
from the Church of Rome, was the euill life of

the gouernours thereof, and vainly spendeth time to
proue out of Ciprian, Augustine, and Caluine, that
for that cause wee ought not to separate our selues,
whereas we are departed out of Babylon, not so much
for the abhominable life thereof, as for the corrupt &amp;
false doctrine taught therein, by which it is shewed to
be ye Synagogue of sathan, &amp; not the church of Christ.
And here Martiall hudleth vp a nomber of quotations
for the authoritie of the Pope and of the church
of Rome, which seeing they haue beene all often
times answered, and by mee also in aunswere to D.
Saunders rocke, it were folly here to stand vpon thē.
               But he will not be counted a falsifier of Tertullian,
when of diuerse copyes and impressions he wilfully
chooseth the worst, that he might wring it to
his purpose, although the matter be not worth the
strife about it. For Tertullians iudgement of tradition
without scripture, in that place is corrupt: for Martiall
him selfe confesseth, that a tradition vnwritten
should be reasonable and agreable to the scriptures,
and so he saith, the tradition of blessing with ye crosse
is, because the Apostles by the holy ghoste deliuered
it. But who shall assure vs thereof? Tertullian &amp; Basil
are not sufficient warrant for so worthie a matter, seeing
S. Paul leaueth it out of the vniuersall armour of
God. But where M. Calfhill distinguisheth traditions
into some necessary, as necessarily inferred of the scripture,
some contrary to the worde, and some indifferent,
Martial like an impudent Asse, calleth on him
to shewe in what scripture, doctor, or councell he findeth
this distinction of traditions. As though a man
might not make a true distinction in disputation, but
the same must be founde in so many wordes, in scripture,
doctor, or councell, when he him selfe cannot deny,
but ye distinction is true, &amp; euery part to be founde
in ye scriptures, doctors &amp; councels. But the examples
please him not, for the couering of women, and their
silence in the church are taught in expresse words of

scripture, and therfore are not necessarily inferred of
scripture. Therefore there is one lye, quod Martiall. Who
would think such a block worthie of answere? which
thinketh a trueth may not be inferred of the expresse
words of scripture, when of nothing it can be better in
ferred. Againe, he calleth it another lye, yt S. Paul proueth
his tradition by ye scripture, for he bringeth no
text nor sentence of scripture to proue yt women shuld
be couered in the church. But Martiall doth not onely
belye M. Calfhill, but also slaunder S. Paul, seeing he
alledgeth out of Genesis, both yt the man is the image
&amp; glory of God, &amp; yt the woman was made for man.
               The examples of the second sort, as Latine seruice,
worshipping of images &amp;c. Martiall will not allowe,
but the scripture is plaine, to them that haue eyes, and
be not like the images whome they worship.
               Againe he liketh not that there should be any limitation
in obseruing traditions of the church in things
indifferent, as if cases of necessitie &amp; of offence might
not make a limitation without contempt of the churches
authoritie. But he will learne, in which kinde of
traditions we place the signing with ye crosse, &amp; ye rest
named by Basil. I aunswere, yt marking with the crosse
in some respect, as it was first vsed of ye old fathers, is
of the third kind, but as it is vsed of you Papists, for a
blessing &amp; sanctifying, of ye second kind. If it be tolde
him, yt the fathers builded some strawe &amp; wood as wel
as gold &amp; siluer, he saith those wordes were meant of
maners &amp; not of doctrine, wherin he sheweth himself
a profound student in S. Pauls Epistles. Yet if ye fathers
haue any priuate opinions, or yt some bastarde bookes
be intituled to them, yet wil he follow ye rule of S. Basil,
Hom. con. Sabel. Dominus, &amp;c. Our Lord hath so taught,
the Apostl
                        ••
                      haue preached, the fathers haue obserued, the martirs
haue confirmed, It shall suffice to say, I haue beene so
taught? I would he would or could follow this councel,
but he leaueth out al ye rest, &amp; taketh but the taile:
We haue been so taught.
               
               
                  
But if he will haue vs to allowe blessing with ye crosse,
let him begin with the head, and shewe where our
Lorde hath taught it, the Apostles preached it, and so
forth continue his gradation to the end. But hitherto
he hath beene hammering of tags to his two taglesse
pointes, as M. Calfhil nameth them, and now he
commeth to worke vpon his third point: that a crosse
was set vp in euery place. And firste he goeth to worke
with the authoritie of Martialis, one of the seuentie
two disciples of Christ, which was as surely a disciple
of Christ, as a kinsman of his. Of whose credite I haue
spoken before, &amp; therefore wil not here repeate it.
               Wheras he is accused of falsifying of Athanasius,
he coloureth the matter by following two or three
corrupt prints, wilfully refusing the true edition &amp;
best reformed according to ye moste auncient written
coppies. His leauing out of words material, which he
cannot excuse by the print, he defendeth by his written
coppie, and layeth the fault on the printer. Better
a badd excuse then none at all, lawyers haue manye
such shiftes.
               But the place is Quaestion. 16. ad Antioch. 
                  
                     Quare credentes
omnes ad crucis imaginem cruces facimus, lanceae verò
sanctae, aut arundinis, aut spongiae figuras nullas conficimus;
cum tamen haec tam sint sancta quàm ipsa crux? Responsio.
Figuram quidem Crucis ex duobus lignis compingentes conficimus,
vt si quis infidelium id in nobis reprehendat, quod veneremur
lignum, possimus duobus inter se disiunctis lignis, &amp;
crucis dirempta forma, ea tanquam in
                           •
                        ilia ligna reputare, &amp;
infideli persuadere▪ quod non colamus lignum, sed quòd crucis
typum veneremur: in lancea verò aut spongia vel arundine
nec facere hoc, nec ostendere possumus. Why do all wee
beleeuers make crosses after the image of the crosse,
but we make no figures of the holy speare, or of the
reede, or of the sponge, whereas yet these are as holy
as the crosse it selfe? The answere. Wee make in
deede the figure of the crosse by putting two pieces
of wood together, that if any of the infidels reprehende

that in vs that wee worship wood, wee may by
seperating the two pieces of wood and breaking the
forme of the crosse, accompt them as vnprofitable
pieces of wood, and persuade the infidell, that wee
worship not wood, but that wee worship the type of
the crosse: but in the speare, or sponge, or reede, we
can neither do not shewe this.
               
               Here Martiall obserueth, that all Christian men
made crosses, yet can he not proue that they did set
these crosses in the church: but that they vsed them
in other places, it appeareth by that they were made
so, as the infidels seeing them, they might be taken asunder.
But I will obserue, that seeing they made no
images of the reede, sponge, speare, &amp;c. they made no
images of Christes passion, which the Papistes accompt
so profitable.
               Secondly, Martiall vrgeth, that they worshipped
the type of the crosse, which Master Calfhill sayeth is
not the figure, but the thing represented by ye crosse.
And verily the Gentyles should haue as great cause to
reprehend them for worshipping the shape of a creature▪
as for worshipping the creature it selfe. Wherefore,
except Martiall will saye, the Christians made a
fonde excuse, let him not play the foole so magnifically,
in cauilling vppon Master Calfhils interpretation,
when he cannot otherwise reasonably defende
the authors meaning.
               Finally, let Martiall remember that the speare,
sponge, &amp; reede, be as holy as the crosse it self, &amp; therfore
in respect of no holynesse thereof the crosse was
made rather then the rest, but because the fourme
thereof being easily broken in two stickes, the Gentyles
might acknowledge, that the Christians made ye
crosse neither for the wood, nor for ye fashion, but for
a remēbrāce of Christ crucified, whō they worshiped.
               From the crosse he digres
                     •
                  eth a while to ye marriage
of vowed priests, complaining that Innocentius &amp;
Siricius, popes of Rome are slandered, where they are

saide to take marriage for a satisfying of lustes of the
flesh, where they speake only of the marriage of Priestes
that had vowed to liue vnmarried, which is false,
for they speake of Priestes that were married, lying
with their owne wiues. 
                     Plurimos enim sacerdotes atque Leuitas
post longa consecrationis suae tempora tam de coniugibus
proprijs quàm etiam de 
                           •
                        urpi coitu sobolem didicimus procreasse.
For we haue learned that many Priestes of Christe and
Leuites long time after their consecration haue begotten
children, as well of their owne wiues, as of filthie
copulation. Thus do they account both faultes alike.
Againe, the reasons they bring, are such as concerne
marriage generally: That they which be in the flesh
can not please God &amp;c. reade the Epistle of Syricius ad
Himeriū Tarraconen▪
                   &amp; Innocentius ad Victricium, which
are all one word for word, concerning this matter. But
where Martiall taketh vpon him to charge vs with a
statute in force against the marriage of Priests in Englād,
vnrepealed, he is miscōceiued. For we haue a clause
of a statute in force, that all marriages lawfull by the
lawes of God, shall be accounted lawfull by the lawes
of the realme. So long therefore as the marriage of
Priestes may be approued by the lawe of God, there is
no daunger in the lawe of the realme. Concerning the
filthie liues of the Popish Cleargie, it is needlesse to
speake, being so well knowne in the world, &amp; yet it is
not their wicked life that separateth vs from their Synagogue,
but their hereticall doctrine. But returning
againe to the crosse, he burdeneth M. Calfhil with a
lye, bicause he saide, that Martial hauing named houses,
markets, wildernesses, highwayes, seas, ships, Garments,
parlors, walles, windowes, armor, &amp;c. where the
crosse should be, nameth not the Church, whereas a
little before, he cited out of Chrysostome, that it was
vsed in the holy table at ye holy mysteries. But Chrysostome
saith not, that the crosse was erected, and set
vp or painted in any Church, although he say, the figure
thereof was vsed. Wherfore here is no lye proued.

Touching the saying cited out of Augustine Serm. 130.
de tempore, although the authoritie is not greatly to be
regarded of those Sermons, yet admit it were Augustines
in deede, M. Calfhil saith truly, that he speaketh
neither of Martials materiall nor mysticall crosse, but
of the death of Christ, and the crosse whereon he suffered,
as al the discourse of that Sermon declareth: Before
the crosse was a name of condemnation, nowe it is made a matter
of honour: before is stoode in damnation of a curse, nowe it is
set vp in occasion of saluation. This nowe Martiall would
either craftily or impudently referre to Augustines
time, which is spoken of the time of Christes passion,
when the crosse was set vp in occasion of saluation, and
not an idol therof in Augustines time.
               He complaineth, that to an other place of Augustine,
wherein mention is made of the signe of ye crosse,
nothing is saide, where nothing needeth, when it is cō
                  fessed,
that the signe of the crosse was vsed in his time.
And concerning Constantines crosse, we haue spoken
alreadie sufficiently. To conclude therefore, here is nothing
replied in this article, to proue that the Apostles
and Fathers of the first Church did blesse them selues
with the signe of the crosse, although the Fathers of
latter time vsed to marke them selues with that signe,
and counselled others so to doe. Neither is there any
thing but the forged newe found Martiales Epistle,
which is worse then nothing, to proue that the signe of
the crosse in the first age of the Church was vsed by
the Apostles, or their immediate successors before the
dayes of Valentinus the heretike.

               That diuers holy men and women got them little pieces of
the crosse,Martial. and inclosed them in gold, &amp;c.
               It is confessed,Fulke. that diuers made great account to
haue little pieces of the crosse, to inclose them in gold,

and hang them about them, but their superstition is
reproued both by Hieronyme and Chrysostome. To
Hierome Martial aunswereth, that he reproued not the
hauing of those pieces, but the confidence put in them,
as the Pharisees did in their Phylacteries hanged vpon
their bodies, and not printing the lawe in their harts.
Be it so, but what accounteth he the hauing of them?
euen the strayning of a Gnat, Culicem liquantes &amp; camelū
deglu
                        •
                     ientes lib. 4. cap. 23. But in other places (saith Martial) he wisheth him selfe to kisse the wood of the
crosse. Apol. 3. cont. Ruff. This was a small matter, and
yet it was more then hauing a little piece of the
crosse, for he speaketh of his visiting the places of the
death, buriall, and birth of Christ, in which he might
take more occasion of meditation vpon the mysteries
of our redemption. To Chrysostome, which counted
it impietie in certaine priestes, that hanged Gospells
about them, and pieces of the coat and haire of Christ,
he maketh like answere, alledging out of his Demostr.
ad Gentiles, that all the world desired to haue ye crosse,
and euery man coueted to haue a litle piece of it, &amp; to
inclose it in golde, &amp;c. and whereas M. Calfhil aunswereth,
that this was no praise of the parties, but a practise
of the time▪ Martial replyeth, that it was a praise
of the parties, repeating what Chrysostome doth write
in commendation of the signe of the crosse &amp;c. whereas
in deed Chrysostome speaking of the matter in question,
onely sheweth what was the affection of Christians
to the crosse, which was sometime the wood of
condemnation. Which affection, although in some it
were immoderate, yet Chrysostomes reason against
ye Gentiles, should not turne him to perpetuall shame,
(as Martial saith) for he proueth that Christ was God,
in that he had wrought so great a conuersion vnto the
faith, that no man was nowe ashamed of the signe of
the crosse, which before was a token of condemnation.
To conclude, where Martiall abuseth the wordes of
Christ: Haec oportet facere &amp;c. These things ought to

be done, the other not omtted, to proue that the fact of
hauing these pieces of the crosse, and inclosing them
in golde, was good, he must either bring the lawe of
God, as the Pharisees did for tything of Mynt and Anise,
or else we can not be persuaded that such estimation

               That a crosse was borne at the singing or saying of the Letanie,
&amp;c.Martial.
               
               That processions came not from Gentilitie to Christians,Fulke.
Martial will proue, bicause processions came
from tradition of ye Apostles, and that he proueth by a
saying of Leo, What so euer is retained of the Church into
custome of deuotion, commeth of the tradition of the Apostles,
and doctrine of the holy Ghost. So is procession &amp;c. but
the minor is false, for the Church of Christ, for many
hundreth yeares after Christe, knewe no processions.
But if processions came from the Gentiles, saith Martial,
shal we therefore condemne them? Haue we not ye
liberal sciences, &amp; many politike lawes from the Gentiles?
as though there were one reason of religion, and
politike laws or liberal artes: the one we are forbiddē
to learne of the Gentiles,Deut. 12. the other being the giftes of
God, we may take them euen from the Gentiles. Neither
doth Augustine against the Manichees, whome
Martial citeth lib. 20. cap. 23. Con. Faust. speake of any
heathenish ceremonies receiued in Christian religion,
but of such thinges▪ as we must haue common with
them, like the sunne and the ayre, as meate, drinke, apparel,
houses, &amp;c.
               Whether processions came from the Montanistes
or Arrians, certaine it is, they came not from Christe
nor his Apostles. Tertullian a Montanist maketh mē
                  tion
of certaine stations, but I suppose they were no
processions but standings. The miracle of water turned

into oyle, to serue for light in the Church, reported
by Eusebius, I maruell to what end Martial bringeth
foorth, and counteth that it was an hundreth
yeares before the heresie of Arrius. The Letanie or
supplication prescribed by the Councel of Ments,
Martial saith the Papistes do obserue, for they ride not
in the Rogationweeke, nor weare their copes. But how
obserue they, that the Canon commaundeth them, to
goe barefooted in sackcloth and ashes? The Councel
of Orleans anno. 515. calleth these Letanies rogations,
but of processiō or going abroad, it speaketh nothing.
S. Ambrose in deed is ancienter then this Councel, but
whether that Commentarie vpon the Epistles, that goeth
vnder his name, were of his writing, it is not agreed
among learned men, at least wise, there be diuers additions,
and the written copies varie. Besides that the

as some printed bookes haue, yet the very circumstance
of the place wil proue that it is the dayes of
a womans going foorth after her childbirth, and therfore
no procession after the crosse.
               And if Agapetus did not deuise processions first, as
M. Calfhil saith; your owne Canon law lyeth, and not
he, de cond. d. 1. Agapitus, as your author Garanza citeth

                  . ca. 8. sheweth, yt the Arrians at Constantinople began
a kind of processiō, with singing of Psalmes by course,
which Iohn Chrysostome, fearing least any godly men
should be seduced by them, tooke vp the same fashion,
&amp; so pasted the Arrians in number &amp; processu &amp; going
forward. For siluer standards of the crosse, with burning waxe

                        〈◊〉
                      went before them. This place sheweth, how godly
men tooke vpfond ceremonies in emulation of heretikes.
But nowe concerning these siluer standards in
forme of ye crosse, which Socrates li. 6. ca. 8. sheweth, did
serue to carie waxe candles or torches, burning vpon

them, to giue the people light in the night season, for
then their processions were in the night, Martiall is as
madde as a marche hare, that they should be counted
no better then candlestickes or cresset staues: and yet
when he hath prated what he can, for that principall
vse they serued, although it may be that Chrysostome
had some superstitious fantasie in the fourmes also of
the crosse, which he deuised to be as ye standerds for the
Catholike armie to followe: so the same crosse staues,
serued both for candlestickes and standerdes: how soeuer
it was, this procession differed much from our
Popish processions, in whiche idols are carried about,
and not as candlestickes, but candlesticks before them,
with candels light in the day time, &amp; not in the night.
               His surmise, that the siluer crosses were set in the
Church, because no place is mentioned where they
left them when they came home, is foolish. They had
common theaters and meeting places more meete for
seting vp of such candlebearing crosses, then ye Churches.
The quarrell of the foure lyes I passe ouer, let the
Reader compare both their Bookes, and iudge whether
Martiall haue handeled that storie with sinceritie.
               The councell Elibertine forbadde candels to be
lighted in the day time in the Churchyards, Ergo they
forbadde them not on the Lordes table, quod Martial.
But why then go you with torches and tapers into the
Churchyarde, both in procession and at burialles. And
seeing it was an Heathenishe custome to light them
in Churches, as well as in Churchyardes, they which
forbad the one would not haue alowed the other. But
you light them not as Heathē men, of whom Lactantius
speaketh, thinking God to be in darkenes, and to
haue neede of light. But Ad signu
                        •
                      latriae demonstrandum
to declare a signe of the high seruice that you owe to
God, If it be so, why light you them to saintes? yea to
images? the Gentils had as good excuses as you. Neuer
thelesse you are determined to kepe your lightes still,

as you haue record &amp; witnes out of Eusebius, Athanasius,
&amp;c. In deede there is great reason, because they had
candels light in the night you wil haue them in ye day:
but of light I wish the reader to look more in my refutation
of Rastals confutation, to ye 33. leafe of his book.
After this foloweth a vain discourse, to proue yt we are
heretiks, because we haue departed from the vnitie of
the Church, from the Cleargie, from the bishop of
Rome, &amp;c. Al which is false, for we haue not departed
from the church of Christ, which is ruled by his word,
nor from the Christian Cleargie, nor from any godly
Bishop of Rome, in any point in whiche he departed
not from the trueth: but we are gone out of Babylon,
we haue forsaken Antichriste, and all his merchantes,
that made sale of mens soules: our prayer in a knowen
tongue, our communion in both kindes, our reuerent
administration of the Lordes supper, haue the Scripture
for their warrant, and the primitiue Church for
their witnesse.
               His rayling vpon Luther, I will not deale withall,
God hath aduanced Luther as his poore witnesse aboue
the Pope, the proud antichrist, which maketh all
Papistes to spighte him. Concerning Iustinians constitution,
for crosses to be born at the singing of the Letanie,
it fauoureth of the corruption of his time. Such
godly constitutions as he made, as well in Ecclesiasticall
as politike matters, we esteeme as the good lawes
of a forreyne prince are to be regarded.
               And at length we come to Augustine the Monke,
which cōming from Rome, did more hurte in corrupting
true religion, then good in planting any religion:
And whereas Martiall saith, if our religion came from
Eleutherius, it came from Rome: although it were no
shame to confesse it came from Rome in those purer
times, yet Christian religion came to vs euen from
the Apostles, as witnesseth Gildas the Brittaine, being
planted here in the reigne of Tiberius the Emperour.
And as for Augustine, although the king Ethelbert

&amp; the people were well prepared before his comming,
by the Queene and the bishop that attended vpon her,
yet according to his zeale, he tooke some paines to
make the people receiue the doctrine of Christe, although
in behauiour he was proude, as Galfride writeth,
and Beda not altogether denieth, but that he seemed
so, and in ceremonies superstitious. So that the
doctrine of Christ which he taught, came from Ierusalem,
from whence the Gospel was first preached, his errours
and superstition came from Rome. That the bishops
of the Brittaines refused, both his authoritie and
ceremonies, it argueth that Christianitie was in this
land not subiect to the see of Rome. If they refused to
ioyne with Augustine in teaching the Saxons, it
might be not for that they enuied their saluation
which were their enemies, but because they would not
consent to ioyne in y• worke with him, which sought
to bring them into subiection. Concerning the cruel
murder of the Monks of Bangor in Augustines quarrell,
Galfride a Brittaine imputeth no small part of the
fault to Augustine. Bede a Saxon would haue him
cleare of it. But seeing the threatening of Augustine is
agreed vpon, and the slaughter followed, it is shrewde
euidence against him. That Augustines crosse, &amp; painted
table differeth from that the Papistes nowe vse in
procession, Martial counteth it not material, seeing afterward
they receyued other kinde of images from
Rome: and other kinde of Images were then vsed in
Churches, which yet were harde for him to proue, for
the Grecians to this day, receiue none but painted Images.
               The pretence that Maister Calfhil saith, Augustine
might haue to excuse him to feede the eyes of them
that neuer heard of Christ, with ye image of his death,
that lending their eares he might enstruct their hearts:
Martiall wil not admit, or if he did admit it, that it
followeth not, that they whiche haue not like pretence
may not vse like example. Whereas Maister

Calfhil doth neither absolutely affirme the pretence,
nor allowe it to be good.
               From this pretence he passeth into a defence of praiing
to Saintes, to iustifie the Popishe Letanie, Virgine
Marie pray for vs, which he denyeth to be idolatrous,
because some steppes, or shewe of invocation of Saints
are found in some olde writers. And calleth for Scripture
to proue it to be idolatrous, yet refuseth what soeuer
Luther, Caluine, or the Magdeburges haue sayde
against it. But by his fauour I wil vse one or two reasons
out of scripture to prooue it to be idolatrous, to
call vpon the virgine Marie, or any creature. Saint
Paule saith Rom. 10. ver. 14. How shall they call vpon
him in whom they haue not beleeued. By whiche
it is euident, that none ought, nor can in true faith be
called vpon, but he in whom we beleeue, and it is idolatrie
to beleeue in any but in God only, wherefore it
is idolatrie to call vpon Marie or any creature, but vppon
God only.
               Againe the Apostle 1. Tim. 2. ver. 5. saith there is but
one God, and one Mediatour of God and men, the man
Iesus Christe, where the Apostle speaketh not onely
of redemption, but of prayers, supplications, intercessions
&amp;c. which ouerthroweth your blinde distinction
of mediatour, of intercession, and redemption.
               For keeping the memorie of the deade, whiche
Lactantius counteth superstition, you thinke your
selues cleare of it, because Matthew, Peter, and Paule
&amp;c. are aliue in heauen. But you must remember,
that Christ sayeth: Abraham, Isaak, and Iacob, were
aliue to God, but in respect of men they are dead,
and therefore those memories are not excused of superstition,
according to Lactantius iudgement. Further
you say, the note, that the materiall crosse is no
ensigne of CHRISTE, hath simple proofe. But
in deede your assertion, that it should be an ensigne
of Christ, hath no proofe at all. The booke

of Carolus magnus against images, you imagine to
haue beene written by Caluine, or Illiricus, or some
other late protestant: but of the credite and antiquitie
thereof, I haue written againste Doctour Sanders
booke of Images Cap. vltimo. Also concerning the
second councel of Nice which Martiall citeth for procession
with the crosse. Cap 15. or 14.
               That God would not suffer the bones of Moses to
be translated, least they should haue bene matter of
idolatrie, he saith it is no cause, why translating of other
Saintes bodies should not be permitted. Because
God will haue mercie, vpon whome he will haue
mercie, and be gentle to whome it pleaseth him. Hath
not the pottemaker power to make one vessel to honour,
and another for reproch? May he not transferre Peters
bones, and let Moses alone? May he not make Paules body to
be honoured, and Iosephes obscured, Saint Stephans shrined,
and Samuels interred, I thinke you will not deny?
               
               These reasons to rehearse, it is a sufficient confutation
of them: But for the highe estimation of reliques,
Hierome is of his side, against Vigilantius,
whome he calleth a famous heretike. And yet no
man condemned him for an heretike but Hierome,
who rather rayleth on him then reasoneth againste
him. As for Eusebius, although he speake honourably
of the bones of Polycarpus, which the Christians
gathered and buried, as the partes of an holy
martyrs body, yet he nameth not any worshipping
of them, such as the Papistes vse. But Martial maketh
much a do that Maister Calfhil alloweth the excuse
which the Heathen men made, that they would
not deliuer the body of Policarpus, least the Christians
should leaue Christe, and beginne to worshippe
him: saying, it was the instinct of the deuill, to denie
his body &amp;c. and so to say.
               What then? Although they meant cruelly and
slaunderously against the true Christians, which could
neither forsake Christe nor worship any other. Yet

the same answere might be well made to superstitious
Papistes, who haue forsaken Christ and worship men,
yea dead bones, and them often not of godly men,
nor always of men. That Chrysostome was a great
admirer of reliques, I shewed before, in so much that
he would change the kingdome of heauen, for the
chaine that Saint Paule was bound withall, wherein
if he spake not excessiuely, let Martial follow him. We
esteeme the kingdome of heauen more then al the reliques
that euer were. And yet we alowe a reuerent
laying vp of the bodies &amp; bones of the Saints, so it be
without superstition and idolatrie, as was meant by
the ancient fathers, although the contrary followed of
their too much zeale and carefulnesse of such small
matters.
               To conclude, you haue heard what can be saide for
the antiquitie of processions, and bearing of the crosse
before them: whether it be an Apostolike tradition,
that was first deuised by Chrysostome in emulation
of heretikes, let the readers iudge.
            
            
               The eight Article.
               That many strange and wonderful miracles were wrought
by the signe of the crosse.Martial.
               
               If this article were granted in manner and fourme
as it is set downe and meant by the author:Fulke. namely,
that God by the signe of the crosse hath wrought miracles,
yet doeth it not followe, that the signe of the
crosse is nowe to be vsed of vs, nor that we should repose
any confidence therein. By the rodde of Moses
great miracles were wrought, yet was neither the
signe of that rod to be esteemed, nor hope of health to
be placed in it, nor the rodde it selfe to be worshipped.
               The Apostles by annointing with oyle,Marke. 6. did worke

great miracles, yet neither the signe of that annointing
is of vs to be vsed, nor the oyle to be worshipped:
wherefore if God to shewe the vertue of him that was
crucified, hath wrought miracles, by the crosse, or
signe thereof, it followeth not, that the signe is still to
be vsed, or the crosse honoured, but he that was crucified.
Whereas M. Calfhil saide, that miracles are
done by the deuil and his ministers, although Martial
cannot deny it, yet he saith it followeth not that all
miracles, or those of the crosse were done by the deuil.
Wheras M. Calfhils meaning is plaine, that we ought
not to beleeue all thinges that are commended to vs
by miracles, but to examine all doctrine by the word
of God, against which we must beleeue no miracles, no
prophets, no Angels, Gal. 1. But whereas Martial laboboureth
to proue, that miracles done by signe of the
crosse, were done by God, he should first haue proued
substantially, that miracles were done in deede by the
crosse, and after prooued, by what power they were
done. For we may not beleeue euery reporte of miracles,
especially when they are alledged to confirme
false doctrine. Let vs therefore consider the first miracle
which he rehearseth of the crosse of Christ, that
Helena found: if she found any, for Eusebius that
knew Helena, and speaketh much of her commendation,
and of her doinge at Hierusalem, as I take it,
would not haue concealed such a notable inuention,
if any such had bene, in his story, and therefore the
note in his Chronologie seemeth to bee a late addition.
But to the miracle, that the crosse was
discerned from the other two by a sicke Gentlewoman
vppon whome it was laide, wherevppon as
soone as it touched her, she recouered. This report of
Rustinus seemeth to be vncertaine, first because Ambrose
sayeth, the crosse was knowen by the title,
without speaking of any miracle: secondly, because
the reporte of other writers is, that the miracle was of
a dead woman, and some of two dead persons, wherof

to see more I referre the reader to mine answere to D.
Sanders booke of Images cap. 13. or 12. Concerning the
rest of the Miracles, reported by Paulinus, Epiphanius,
Augustine and others, let thē haue such credite as their
authors deserue, which is not to build faith or doctrine
vpon them, or their writinges, let it be that some were
true and wrought by God, yet followeth it not, that al
that haue bene since reported in the Popishe Legendes
were either true or not wrought by the deuil: whereabout
Martiall maketh much wrangling, but neither
affirmeth nor concludeth any thing vniuersally. None
vse more crossing then witches and coniurers, the deuil
seemeth to be afraide to come neare them, certaine
strange works are brought to passe by them Let Martial
affirme any vertue included in the crosse, or signe
thereof absolutely, &amp; then we may deale with him accordingly
For while he telleth vs what may be done
by faith &amp; ye signe of ye crosse, and what God hath done
by good men with that signe, it is nothing to the authorizing
of that signe, seeing the deuil by credulitie
in wicked men hath don the like by the same signe.
               And this is a true position of M. Calfhil, though
Martiall will not vnderstand it. That it is not a sufficient
proofe to make a thing good, or to shew it to be good, (because
he cauilleth like a calfe a
                        •
                      the worde of making▪) to say that
miracles were wrought by it. Martial asketh first, whether
the miracles of Christ were not a sufficient proofe of
his diuine power? Where he flyeth from the position,
which speaketh not of the principal efficient cause, out
of a ceremonie, a meane, or instrument. More pertinently
he asketh of the hemme of Christs coate. Saint
Paules napkins, whether they had not a vertue by his
body. I answere no. No more then Iudas lippes that
kissed Christe, and Peters shadowe, which could neither
be holy, nor efficient of any thing, because it was nothing
but the priuation of the light by comming betweene
of his body. So I say of coates, napkins, ashes of
Martyrs, and signe of the crosse, if any miracles were

done by meanes of them, they are not thereby holy,
neither haue they any vertue in them. The Lord hath
giuen vs a generall rule to examine all miracles, and
miracle workers, by the doctrine they teache. Deut. 13.
               
                  If there arise among you a prophet or dreamer of
dreames (and giue thee a signe or wonder, and y• signe,
&amp; the wonder which he hath told thee, come to passe)
if he say let vs goe after other Gods which thou hast
not knowen, and let vs serue them: thou shal not hearken
vnto the words of that prophet, or vnto that dreamer
of dreames: for the Lord your God proueth you,
to know whether you loue the Lord your God with al
your heart, and with all your soule. Ye shal walk after
the Lord your God and feare him, and kepe his cōmandements,
and hearken vnto his voyce, and ye shall serue
him, and cleaue vnto him. By this scripture we are
taught to examine all miracles, whether they tende to
the honour of the only true God and the maintenance
of his true worshippe according to his worde: whiche
Martiall him selfe in a manner confesseth: saying,
that miracles done by heretikes are not able to commende a
thing. But he findeth great fault with Maister Calfhil
for coupling the generation of a childe in adultery
or feeding by stollen breade, to be miracles, because
they be not extraordinarily miracles and yet he can
not deny but they be great wonders, and the reason
of the meanes is all one in both.
               Nowe let vs see howe he aunswereth those three
reasons of Maister Calfhils, why miracles make not
for the crosse. And first he aunswereth to a question,
Why the durt in the streete by whiche Christe wrought a miracle,
should not be honoured as well as the crosse on the altar?
He aunswereth because the crosse was an instrument
by which all the worlde was saued. So was Iudas, so
was Pilate. The second, He saith the crosse is a liuely representation
of Christes death. Nay a dombe and dead idoll
which is good for nothing. Abacuc. 2. The thirde
The crosse is effectuous euer since. A deed efficient.
               
                  
                  The crosse is commaunded of God to be made and vsed by
diuers Reuelations from heauen. Nay by the diuell from
hell, and yet if Angels from heauen had taught the
crosse to be made and vsed as another Gospell, as it is
accounted of the Papists, as great as circumcisiō was of
ye Iewes, not preached by the Apostles, not conteyned
in the Scriptures, we might safely accurse them.
               But now to the reasons: the first is: Why should not
such external meanes as Christ and his Apostles vsed, &amp; scripture
mentioneth, be had in administration, rather then the idle
deuice of man, of which there is no lawfull president. Martiall
answereth, the crosse is no idle deuise, but a tradition
of the Apostles, whereof they haue lawful presidentes.
But seeing no president is lawfull to builde our faith
vpon, but the holy scriptures, which the Papistes haue
not for their crosse, the reason standeth vntouched.
               The second reason, If miracles were done by the signe of
the crosse, yet not onely by it, therefore the crosse should not only
be magnified without the rest. Martial affirmeth that hee
would not haue the crosse magnified without the rest,
as prayer and faith. How doeth he then magnifie the
crosse in Iulians storie, which was without prayer and
faith?
               The third reason. If miracles were done by the crosse, yet
it should not be had in estimation, except all other thinges by
which miracles were wrought, as the he
                        •
                      of Christes garment,
the spitle and clay, the shadowe of Peter and napkins of Paule,
were likewise honoured and esteemed. Martial aunswereth,
this is but his assertion, for which he hath neither scripture,
councel, nor Doctor. As though an argument A
paribus, were not good except the conclusion were expressed
in Scriptur, doctor, or councel. Yet he replieth,
that the crosse is the principall meane, by which miracles
haue ben wrought. But the Scripture is against
that, for Christ wrought no miracle by the signe of y•
crosse. Nay I slander him, for he reasoneth not ad idem,
but the crosse is the cheefe and principal instrumente
of our redemption, yet not holier then the speare, the

reede, and the sponge, as Athanasius affirmeth Ad Antioch.
que. 16. But euen the hemme, the spettle, and clay, if
he had them, Martial would honor, worship &amp; esteeme
for his sake whose pretious body they touched. Then
let him worship the sunne that touched him with his
beams of light, or if that be too farre of, let him worship
Iudas lippes that kissed him, if he can come by
them. Concerning the person of Helena, I would wish
nothing to be spoken of her, but to her honour, except
in case where her honour should be an hinderance of
the honor of Christ. Martial to iustifie her in al things,
raileth vpon M. Calfhil, for charging her with superstition
as though he had bene the first yt had so written
of her, when it is reported of her that she was vs
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ad superstitionem
pia, deuout euen to superstition. And yet her
superstition, appeareth not so great in any thing, as in
this supposed inuention of the crosse.
               The varietie in time that is in the witnesses of the
inuention of the crosse, the blasphemous beast is not
ashamed to compare with the apparence of varietie
which is in the Euangelistes, where in deede there is
none, wheras this discord can not be reconciled. Yet
will he not haue the tale discredited for the discorde
in time, as though there were none other discorde.

                     tis euidenter euidently inough, would excuse the
matter, as though we knewe not what patet doeth
signifie, as well as Maister vsher of Winchester. That
a shippe would not carrie the peeces of the crosse that
are shewed in so many places, he counteth it an impudent
lye of Caluine, whome he rayleth vpon like a

ruffian, and slaundereth like a diuel. Yet Erasmus affirmeth
the same in his Peregrinat. relig. erg. And he
that will beleeue neither of them both, let him consider
beside so many whole crosses as are shewed in
steede of that one, and of great boardes yt are kept in
many places as part of it, so many thousand churches
&amp; Abbeys as either now shew or haue shewed chips &amp;
pieces of it, &amp; he shall not think their report to be in
credible. The talk of the nayles which were but three
at ye first, &amp; al bestowed at the time of ye inuention, yet
are now multiplyed to 13. or 14. which bewrayeth an
horrible impudencie in the Popish idolaters. Martiall
refuseth as impertinent, yet will he not confesse ye forgerie,
which is a token of a wicked &amp; diuelish conscience.
Where M. Calfhill sayeth that miracles were
not done by the crosse to establish a worshipping or
hauing of it, Martiall requireth proofe by scriptures,
Councels or Doctors. I reason thus a paribus out of
the scripture, myracles were done by oyle, shadowe, &amp;
other things, not to establish a worshipping or hauing
of them: the like reason is of myracles done by
the crosse. Beside that y• scripture is plentiful in challenging
all honour &amp; worship to the author, &amp; not to
the meanes or instruments. Peter and Iohn, meanes of
the healing of the lame man refused all honour and
worship in respect of his healing, Act. 3. vers. 12. yet
were they other manner of meanes then ye crosse euer
was in doing of myracles.
               That M. Calfhill sayeth, myracles teach vs not to
do the like, but to beleeue the like. Martiall sayeth,
they teach vs to do the like if we may: and he proueth
it by him that teacheth that almes couereth sinne, who
thereby teacheth to do almes, &amp;c. Thus the wise man
compareth miracles &amp; men together, facts &amp; doctrin;
act &amp; possibilitie, euen as right as a rammes horne.
But how shal we come by this power to worke miracles
by the signe of ye crosse? for to assay without assurance
of Gods power, is to tempt God. Therefore wee

may no more crosse vs against diuels, because God
hath sometime chased thē away by y• signe, then wee
may annoynt blind mens eyes with clay, to proue if
they will see after it, because Christ wrought a myracle
by y• meane, which as Martial saith, teacheth vs to
do the like if we may. What estimatiō Paulinus a superstitious
man had in his piece of the crosse, which
was perhaps a piece of another tree, then euer came in
Iewry. Wee haue not to followe him in his follye.
That myracles wrought of holy men by the signe of
the crosse, &amp;c. is not a sufficient reason to proue that ye
figne of the crosse should be had, kept, set vp, and honoured,
I haue alreadie proued out of the scripture by
ye like or equall, &amp; yet it is against reason, when we
deny your arguments whose consequence you ought
to proue, y• we should be driuē to proue that they follow
not. Where M. Calfhill sayeth, y• myracles onely
ought not, or may not cōmend a thing, you pick quarels
to him without cause, obiecting the miracles of
Christ, who tooke witnesse not only of his miracles,
but also of ye holy scriptures. When you haue vrged
the miracle done by ye signe of ye crosse out of Epiphanius,
as much as you can, yet proueth it not ye honouring
and setting vp of ye signe of ye crosse in these days,
as M. Calfhill telleth you, seing y• we liue not among
Turkes or Sarazens, y• we need to haue any such signe
whereby we might be knowen to be worshippers of
Christ. But you would faine learne, what if a Portingal
or one of ye new conuerted Ilāds of India, cōming
by chance into England, of which he neuer heard before,
&amp; seing neither images nor crosses in church nor
streate, how he should knowe in whome wee beleeue.
And I would learne of you, what skilleth it, if such a
man as neuer came here, nor euer by any likelyhood
shall come hither, yet supposed to be driuen on a
boarde out of India into Englande, what skilleth it I
say, if he know not in whom we beleue, and so depart
as wise as he came? What remedy but we must haue al

places filled with images &amp; crosses, for such a man to
knowe what we holde of, who shalbe neuer the better
thereby, nor the worse if he know not. But you think
that happily strangers of Greece, Cōstantinople, Iewry,
&amp; India, may come to our coastes, and therfore wee
ought to haue the signe of the crosse in churches, chapels,
&amp; high wayes, to signifie of whome we hold. We
haue not many such strangers, but when they arryue
we haue bookes of the holy scripture in Greeke, Hebrue,
Chaldee, Syrian, Arabike, Sclauonian tongues, in
which they may be instructed that are desirous to vnderstand
what religion we professe. The Lorde God
thought it sufficient to haue his lawe written vppon
great stones, at the entrance into the holy land, to let
all strangers knowe, both whome, &amp; after what manner
the people of Israell did honour and serue their
God. Deut. 27. 3. But as for images and pillers he vtterly
forbad them to set vp any for any vse of religion,

               What commoditie euery Christian man hath or may haue
by the signe of the Crosse.Martiall.
               
               Whereas M. Calfhil detesteth the Idolatrous councell
of Nice theFulke.. 2. by the example of Ambrose, who
abhorred the hereticall councell of Ariminum. Martiall
willing to iustifie yt rable of Idolators assembled
at Nice, wold shew great difference, not only between
the councels, but also betwene him &amp; Ambrose, saying
yt he was a catholike bishop acknowledging obedience
&amp; subiection to the Popes holynes. As though
the bishop of Rome in his time, either required such
obedience &amp; subiection, or y• Ambrose acknowledged
any. But concerning that assembly of Nice, and ye authoritie
thereof, how they determined contrary to the
worde of God, not onely in the matter of hauing and
worshipping of images, but also in other things, I referre

ye reader to mine answer vnto M. Sanders booke
of images, Cap. 15. or 14. Of all yt M. Calfhill saith against
that councel of Nice, Martial chooseth but one
saying of Germanus to defend, wherin he picketh two
quarels against M. Calfhil, one yt he should misvnderstand
the saying of Germanus, as though he meant yt
grace were dispensed by Images, where he sayth: an
image is a figuring of holy vertue &amp; dispensation of grace▪
                   But
if grace be not dispensed by images, whether Germanus
said so or no, I pray you, to what purpose are they
set vp in the churches? or what profit may a Christian
man haue by the signe of the crosse? when Martial denyeth
yt any grace is dispensed by images. The seconde
quarel he picketh is, yt M. Calfhill denyeth y• the vertues
of saints can be seen in their images, which could
not be seene in their persons. Martial sayth: this reason
condemneth the scripture as well as images, for the ynke
and paper hath no mynde or sense to hold the power of Christ,
&amp; vertue of the Apostles, more then images haue. As though
the scripture were nothing but ynke &amp; paper, or as
though yt all things y• may be learned &amp; vnderstood
by hearing, may be discerned by the eye, which conceiueth
only bodily shapes of things, &amp; cannot attain
to see faith, holines, vertue, &amp;c. wherof no images can
be made. When M. Calfhill sayeth: that the image
of Mars, or S. George, Venus, or the mother of Christ
cannot be discerned asunder. Martial hath nothing to
reply, but that we must not suppose to finde any images
among the Christians, but of Christ &amp; his saintes,
so that images be wise bookes, which cannot teache
their schollers what or whereof they are, but they
must learne of the common opinion how to esteeme of
them. That images be teachers of pride, auarice, wantonnesse,
&amp;c. as the Prophet sayeth: they are the doctrine
of vanitie &amp; lyes, Abac. 2. Martiall sayth blasphemously,
yt images giue no more occasion of vices,
then the holy scriptures, of which some wicked men
take occasion of dronkennes, whoredome, vsury, &amp;c.
               
                  
But seeing the scripture directly &amp; plainly condē
                  neth
al these &amp; other vices as occasion is giuē by thē,
howsoeuer any is taken by vngodly persons, whereas
images which teach no goodnes, but being gorgeously
&amp; whorishly decked with golde &amp; precious
stones, otherwise then the saintes delighted, euen as in
holy scripture they are counted as stumbling blocks,
so they teach men vainly affected, to delight in such
things, as they see to please the saints. But Martiall
sayeth, that gylded images make men thinke of the
ioyes of heauen. O ridiculous fantasie. They may
sooner make men thinke of the vanitie of the worlde,
to delight in it. But when the holy ghost by ye mouth
of his Prophets hath determined that images are the
doctrine of lying &amp; vanitie, it were lost labour to dispute
any longer what good thinges they can teache,
Ier. 10. ver. 8. Abac. 2. ver. 18.
               The examples of Ezechias, Iosias, &amp; Salomon, he
sayth are brought to no purpose against images amō
                  gest
Christians. As though it were more lawfull for
Christians, then for Israelites to commit idolatrie. But
y• Christians (saith he) direct their hearts, &amp; offer their
prayers to God, &amp; therfore there is no mistrust of idolatry
amongest them. Why Martiall? haue not ye Papistes
in England made &amp; do they not yet still in other
places make vowes to the images that are in such
a place and such a place. Do they not trauaile thither,
and offer vp both prayers and sacrifice of candels, money,
Iewels and other things vnto the Images? Haue
not your idols giuen aunswer? haue they not wagged
their heades and lips, &amp;c. O shamelesse dogges &amp; blasphemous
idolaters. The Lord so deal with you as you
know in your own consciences y• the ignorant people
haue made their prayers euen to the stockes &amp; stones,
thinking them to haue a life &amp; diuinitie in them: and
yet you say, there is no mistrust of idolatrie, lest you
should be driuen by exāple of Ezechias, to destroy &amp;
break your images, although otherwise they were not

against Gods cōmandment, but euen made by his appointment,
as ye brasen Serpent was. That fond quarell
of yours, that Salomon was not abused by images, but
by women, I leaue to women to laugh at your vanity,
when they reade, that by women he was brought to
be an idolater, and worshipper of images.
               And euery childe that readeth Chrysostome Hom.
54. in 8. Tom. can vnderstand, that although occasioned
by obstinate Iewes, yet he speaketh generally of al obstinat
minds, whether they be professors of Christianity,
or no. 
                     Animo desperato &amp;c. There is nothing worse thē
a desperate mind, although he see signes, although miracles
be wrought, yet he standeth still in the self same
frowardnesse. For an obstinate sinner that hath professed
Christianitie, is no more moued with miracles, and
the signe of the crosse, then a Iewe or Pharao was. It
hath more colour, but not more trueth, that Athanasius
ascribeth not all effectes of conuersion of wicked
men, &amp;c. wholy and solie to the faith of Christe, when
he saith, who hath done this, &amp;c. but the faith of Christ, and
signe of the crosse? Martial confesseth, that faith is able to
do it wtout the crosse, but y• God would haue y• signe of
the crosse common with faith: if ye aske in what scripture
God hath reuealed this will, he hath nothing to
say. Only he denieth, M. Calfhils exposition of Athanasius,
that the signe of ye crosse was ioined to faith, not
as a fellow worker, but as a witnesse &amp; signe of y• faith
against the Gentiles, bicause he hath neither scripture,
Doctor, nor Councel for it. Wherin he lieth shamefully,
for ye scripture shewing,Rom. 3. 
                        〈◊〉
                      28. y• faith onely as ye instrumēt
by which we apprehend Gods mercy &amp; our iustificatiō,
by which God purifieth our harts, sufficiently proueth,Act. 15. v. 9
that the signe of the crosse is no worker in these cases.
                Chrysostome speaking of our conuersion, &amp;c.
saith: 
                     Hom. 14. in Ep. ad Rom. Vnum hoc &amp;c. We haue
offered this one only gift of GOD, that we giue
credite to him, promising vs thinges to come, and
by this onely way we are saued. This Doctor ascribeth
all to faith, therefore nothing to the signe of

the crosse. Whether the Parisiens approue Erasmus his
censure it is not materiall, the censure is true, and approued
by as wise and well learned as they.
               Touching the next quarell, that Cyrillus acknowledgeth
it no fault of the Christians, to make the signe
of the crosse at their doores, it is very foolish, as all the
rest be, for although he defend it as a good deede, and
in his time tollerable, yet if any did worship the wood
of the crosse, as Iulian charged them, it was a fault,
which Cyrillus doth excuse and seeke to couer, but of
that matter you may reade more in mine aunswere to
D. Sanders booke of images, cap. 4. or 3. after the errour
of his print.
               That S. Basil alloweth images in Churches, he citeth
his sermon vpon Barlaa
                     •
                  , where he exhorteth
painters to set foorth the valiant conflictes of the martyr

of other Painters then eloquent Rhetoricians.
For immediately before he saith.

               The counterfet oration of Athanasius, brought in
the idolatrous Councel of Nice, we reiect as a matter
forged by heretikes and idolaters. The other Doctors
places, whome he quoteth, are all considered and aunswered
in seuerall places of mine aunswere to Doctor
Sanders booke of images before mentioned.
               Whether an image may be made of Christ, which is
both God and man, you shall finde it more at large
intreated, in my saide aunswere cap. 7. or 6.
               That the crosse in the time of Cyrillus had none

image vpon it, it is to be proued by this reason, 
                     〈◊〉
                  
Iulian would not haue omitted to obiect the worshipping
of images vnto Christians, which they condemned
in the Heathens, if any images had bene vpon
their crosses, which he charged them to haue worshipped.
Concerning the calling of Churches by the name
of Saints, we haue spoken alreadie.
               That S. Paul ioyneth not pictures with scriptures,
to be our instruction and comfort, it is an argument
of better force then Martiall hath wit to aunswere. For
if any such instruction, comfort, or commoditie had
any wayes come to Christians by pictures, he would
not haue written, that the scriptures are able to make
the man of God perfect, prepared to all good workes,

               The adoration and worship of the crosse allowed by the ancient
Fathers.Martiall.
               
               Martial thinketh it not reason,Fulke. that he should proue
the adoration of the crosse by some testimonie of
scripture, bicause God hath not so tied him selfe to the
written letter of the scripture, that nothing can be taken
for trueth, which is not written in scripture. But
God hath so tied vs to the written letter of the scripture,
that we are bound to beleeue nothing but that
which may be proued thereby. The baptisme by heretikes,
the baptisme of infants, the authoritie of the
Epistle to the Hebrues, of Saint Iames and Iude, and of
all the canonicall scriptures, haue proofe and approbation
out of the holy scriputres, and are not receiued
of vs by the onely tradition and authoritie of the
church, which yet we doe not refuse, when it is warranted
by the holy scriptures inspired of God.
               The auncient Fathers, Athanasius, Chrysostome, &amp;c.
were not exempted from the infirmitie of men, that
they could so order their termes, as no heretikes shuld

take occasion of error by them, when euen the termes
of holy scripture are often times abused by thē, cleane
contrarie to the meaning of the spirite, by which they
were written.
               But Martial like a proud foole, disdaineth to be called
to define adoration, bicause euery terme is not necessarie
to be defined. And yet I suppose he would claw
his poll twise, or euer he could make a true definition
of it, or a description either. At the least wise, seeing the
word of adoration is taken so many wayes: but that
he would walke vnder a cloud of ambiguitie, he shuld
haue expressed what manner of adoration he doeth
speake of. But he is content to take adoration for
bowing downe, prostrating, putting off the cap, &amp;c.
which he thinketh may be done to a sensllesse image,
as well as to the Queenes cloth of estate, her priuie
seale, &amp;c. as though there were no difference betweene
ciuil reuerence, and religious worship and yet I weene
no man doeth this honour to those senslesse things,
although he shewe reuerence to the Prince at the sight
of them. The second cōmandement, Exod. 20 he saith
toucheth not Popish images, more then politike images,
of Dragons, Eagles, Owles, &amp;c, in armes or other
pictures. So good a lawyer he is, that he can not interprete
the lawe according to the matter wherevpon it is
made, namely religiō, but fantasieth, that bicause images
out of the vse of religion be not forbidden to be
made by a lawe of religion, therefore they be not forbidden
to be made, no not in the vse of religion.
               The Prophets, he saith, cry out against the images of
Gentiles, and by his leaue, against the images of the Israelites
also. The image of the brasen Serpent was a figure
of Christ, and yet the Prophets condemned, and
Ezechias destroyed the worship of the brasen Serpent.
               For the examination of the sentence of Ambrose de

                     bitu Theodosij, I referre the reader, to mine aunswere to
D. Sander of images. cap. 13. or 12.
               Augustine in Ioan. T. 36. sheweth, howe reuerently ye
                  
crosse was esteemed of the Romaines, that now malefactors
were no more punished vpon it, least it should
be thought, they were honoured, if they s
                     •
                  ffered that
kinde of death, which our sauiour Christe died. As among
vs, if rascall theeues should be beheaded at the
Tower hill, where only honourable perso
                     •
                  ages vse to
suffer, it might be saide, they were honoued with that
kinde of execution. Herevpon Martial both foolishly
and lewdly dreameth, that if theeues had bene put to
death vpon the crosse, the people were likely to haue
honoured them for the crosses sake.
               Hierome saith, that Paula worshipped lying before ye
crosse, as though she had seene Christe hanging vpon ye
crosse, yet saith he not, that she worshipped the crosse.
Ambrose saith of Helena, that when she found ye crosse
she worshipped the king, &amp; not the tree, for that is an
heathenish error,De obis, &amp; a vanitie of vngodly persons. wherfore
if Hierome, or any other father should teach vs to
worship the crosse as an idol,Theod. we might well say to
him, auoyd Sathan. But Martial, least he should seeme
wearie of wrangling, scoffeth at M. Cal. for talking of
a wodden tree, as though the matter of a thing, might
not be named, but where there is difference of matter.
Why say we then an earthly or fleshly man, if we may
not say a woodden tree? by Martials philosophie, least
men should thinke we talke of watrie and fishy men.
I had not thought to haue named Martials terme of
Gentlemens recognisances, of Dragon, Eagles, &amp;c.
vsed in this Article, but that he is so captious, to take
exceptions to M. Cal. termes, himselfe being a lawier,
to trip in a terme of law. That seruice and worship do
so concur together, that the one can not be wtout the
other, Martial granteth, although he think M. Cal. can
bring no scripture, Doctor, nor Councel for it, when
he bringeth the saying of Christ. Matt 
                     •
                  . 4. But when
he inferreth that we must serue God only, therfore we
must worship God only. Mart. bringetl

                   instāce of ciuil
seruice, &amp; worship of parents. when our sauiour Christ

speaketh onely of religious worship, which the diuell
required to be giuen him, not as God, but as the distributer
of all the kingdomes of the world, vnder God.
               That Angels are inferiour to Christ, which worship
him,Heb. 1. and are not worshipped againe, Martiall saith, it is
an addition vnto S. Paul, bicause in all that Epistle we
are not forbidden to worship Angels, but where he
proued before, that God only is to be worshipped, and
the Angel refuseth to be worshipped of Iohn. Apoc.
19. vers. 10. 22. vers. 8. who was not so madd to worship
him as God, but as an excellent creature: what addition
can this be to the sense and meaning of the Apostle,
especially when he addeth immediately, that they
are all ministring spirites, appointed to minister for
them that shall inherite saluation. They are appointed
of God to serue, they are not set vppe to be serued and
worshipped. Their honour and delight is, that God only
may be serued and honoured.
               Out of Damascen, he excuseth their worshipping of
the crosse, for that they worship not ye matter, as wood,
copper, &amp;c. but the figure, as if it were lesle idolatrie to
worship an accident, then a substance.
               The honour which Peter refused to receiue of Cornelius,
was not such as became the minister of God, and
therefore was reproued by Peter, without counterfetting
of humilitie, the other examples that Martiall
bringeth of ciuill worship done vnto Dauid by Abigail,
and Nathan, be cleane out of the purpose.
               Concerning the worship of Angels, I haue spoken
immediately before. Martial slaundereth S. Iohn, that
he would haue worshipped the Angles as God. The
conclusion of this argument he thinketh worthy to be
hissed at, Angels may not be worshipped, ergo, much
lesle the crosse.
               What shall we say to such a Chrysippus, as alloweth
not the argument a maioribus? The obiection of the
Cherubims, ye brasen serpent, ye oxen, and other images
in the Temple, you shall finde answered, cap. 5. or. 4.

of my confutation of D. Sanders booke of images.
               The seuenteene authorities brought by M. Calfhil,
against the worshipping of images, Martiall will
aunswere if he can, and first he denieth, that Clemens
speaketh of crosses, crucifixe, &amp;c. but of the images of
the Gentiles. In deede in his dayes the true Christians
had no such images, that he should speake of them.
But consider his reasons, that he maketh against the
worshipping of heathenish images, and they serue also
to condemne the worship of Popish images. The fables
of the image of Christes face, that he gaue to Veronica,
and sent to Algarus, is good draffe for such
swine, as delight in idolatrie. But Martiall thinketh,
that as our eares call vpon vs to bowe our knees at the
name of Iesus, so doe the eyes at the sight of the crucifixe:
but he must vnderstand, that we worship not the
sound of the name of Iesus, rebounding in the ayre,
but the power, the maiestie and authoritie of Iesus, we
acknowledge and honor, not called vpon by the sound
of the name of Iesus, but by the voyc
                     •
                   of the Gospell,
to which the idol of the crucifixe hath no resemblance,
neither is it a lawfull meane, to strirre vp our remembrance,
bicause it is forbidden of God.
               Where Saint Paul saith, that Christ was described or
painted vnto the Galathians, we must either say, that
the passion of Christ was painted in a table, or else they
caried the image of the crosse of Christ rent and torne
in their mindes. If they might carrie an image in their mindes,
why might they not haue it faire painted in a table, speake
Master Calfe? aunswer if you can? O mightie Martiall,
withdrawe your grimme countenance a while, and
giue him leaue to gather his wittes together. First he
saith, that Saint Paul speaketh of neither of both your
images, but of the effect and fruite of the death of
Christe, which was so liuely described before them,
that they ought not to haue sought any thing more to
the sufficiencie of his redemption, and their saluation.
Secondly, although the sense of hearing be appointed

of God, Rom. 10. to instruct faith, yet he findeth not
the sense of seeing, and especially of images, which God
hath forbidden, admitted to be a mouer to Christian
deuotion or worship of God: and therefore there is
no like reason, that as the storie may be caried in remembrance,
so the image may be painted and set vp in
the Church to be worshipped.
               The iniunction of kneeling at the communion, intendeth
no worship of the breade and wine, more then
of the table, the cuppe, the booke, the deske, the wall,
&amp;c. before which the people kneele, and therefore it
hath nothing like to your kneeling before the crosse,
which is not only before it, but also to it, to worship it.
               But you thinke you haue an argument to choake
vs, of the ceremonie of swearing vpon a booke, seeing
swearing is a kinde of adoration. But syr, we sweare
not by the booke, as you Papistes doe, we call God only
to witnesse, the booke is but an externall indifferent
ceremonie, and that rather ciuill then ecclesiasticall,
whereas adoration of GOD by images, is prohibited
by Gods lawe. Againe, we giue no honour at
all to the booke, as you do to your images.
               That Clemens alloweth the honour giuen to man,
as to the image of GOD, we allowe very well, bicause
man is a true image of GOD, your blockes and
stockes be all false and counterfet images.
               To Clemens Alexandrinus, Irenaeus and Tertullian
he maketh the same aunswere, that they speake only
of heathenish images. The like he might say, where
they speake against adulteries, that they speake of the
adulteries of the Heathen, and not of Christians. And
the same to Cyprian, Origen, Arnobius, Lactantius, &amp;
Athanasius, bringing instance of the ciuill reuerence
done to the Princes seate, and to the Prince him selfe.
And wheras Arnobius saith expresly, &amp; absolutely we
worship no crosses, he expoundeth it, we worship them
not as Gods. Such expositions may auoyde all authorities.
The Gentiles which knewe the Christians worshipped

but one God, did not obiuct worshipping of
crosses vnto them as Gods.
               Against the authoritie of Lactar tius, he bringeth
in a verse falsely ascribed vnto him: Flecte genu lignumque
crucis venerabile adora, Bow the knee, and adore the
venerable wood of the crosse. If Martial allowe this
verse for authenticall authoritie, howe will he iustifie
that he saide before, they worshipped not the wood,
stone, metal of the crosse, but the figure or signe of it?
Against Athanasius he obtrudeth that counterfet sermon
of the image of Christe in Berisus, and once againe
vrgeth his forged question 39. ad Antiochū, which
is quest. 16. as we haue set it downe at large Articl. 5.
hauing in it no such wordes as he c
                     •
                  teth: Crucis figuram
ex duobus lignis componentes adoramus. We making a figure of
the crosse of two pieces of wood, doe ador
                        •
                      it. To Epiphanius,
he aunswereth, that he speaketh onely against women,
which offered sacrifice to ye vi
                     •
                  gine Marie, whereas
neither it was lawfull that women should offer sacrifice,
nor that Marie should be made a God. But in
deede Epiphanius speaketh against the adoration of
dead men, by images. 
                     Et mortui qui lem sunt qui adorantur
&amp;c. And they truely which are worshipped are deade,
but they bring in their images to be worshipped whiche
neuer liued, for they can not be dead which neuer
liued. He would haue Marie to be honoured, but not
with worshipping her image, for that were idolattie.
Martial hath two strong collections: if a woman may
not sacrifice, ergo, she may not be head of the Church,
as though it were necessarie, that the chiefe gouernour
of ye church should do sacrifice. The other, that women
may not offer externall sacrifice, ergo, there is an external
sacrifice that men may offer. As good as this, a woman
may not circumcise, therefore circumcision is in
vse to be done by men.
               To be short, Epiphanius calleth the heresie of ye Collyridiaus
that sacrificed to the virgine Marie Haeresis si
                        ••
                     lachrifica
an image making heresie. But least Martial

should seeme to be beaten cleane away from Epiphanius,
he citeth him De vitis prophet, alledging a prophecie
of Hieremie of the second comming of Christ,
which shold be Quando gentes vniuersae ligno supplicabunt,
when all nations shall make their supplications to woode.
Heere is either Martials signe of the crosse, or an Heathenish
errour commanded by the prophetes, he saith.
But if he will boaste of the authoritie of the ancient
Epiphanius, he must bring better stuffe then this fragment
De vita &amp; inter. Proph. Which following so many
Iewish fables, argueth the later Epiphanius the patrone
of Images to be ye author, rather then ye elder of
Cyprus. For this prophecie of Hieremie, euen as the
fable of the Arke swallowed of a stone, &amp;c. sauoureth
of Iewish vanitie: And yet if we should admit it as authenticall
and true, the sense should rather be, yt Christ
shal come when al nations shal be idolaters or wood-worshippers,
then when al nations should worship the
signe of the crosse, as Martiall supposeth. For Christ at
his second comming shall scarse finde faith. Therefore
infidelitie possessing the greatest part of ye world,
it is more like all nations should worship woodden
idols, then Christ by honoring the signe of his crosse.
               To Ambrose, denying that Helena worshipped the
wodde of the crosse, he opposeth a forged saying of
Ambrose, cited in the second councell of Nice, where
lying, forging, and false worshipping, did beare all the
sway. Concerning the true testimonie of Ambrose,
reade more in mine answere to D. Sanders booke of
images Cap. 13. or 12.
               To Hierome, not admitting ye ciuil honor vsed to be
giuen to the pillers &amp; images of the Emperours, much
lesse adoration of images in religion, he oppeseth his
saying in Psalm. 98. affirming that adoration of the
crosse is allowed by him, whereas that commentary
by learned and indifferent iudges, Erasmus &amp; Amerbachius,
is proued by many arguments to be none of
Hieronymes writing, but of one of much later time.
               
                  
Thus hath Martial against the true testimonies of
the fathers, nothing to oppose, but their counterfetted
authorities, and false inscribed writings. Concerning
Hieronymes adoration of the mangar and incunabula
the cradle of Christ, which Martial so often called the
swathling clothes, I haue aunswered before, yt he meaneth
no such adoration, as the Papistes giue vnto their
images, but a reuerent estimatiō, as of an ancient, holy
monumēt, wherin yet I wil not altogether excuse Hierome
of superstitious affectiō, as I wil not charge him
wt idolatrie. For Chrysostomes iudgment of worshipping
ye crosse, I refer the reader as before, to Cap. 13. or
12. of mine answere to D. Sand. booke of images. To
Claudius bishop of Taurino, that in al his Dioces forbad
the worship of the crosse, he aunswereth, Alphonsus
de Cactro counteth him for an heretike, &amp; Ionas bishop
of Orleans writeth against him. In deed Ionas writeth
against his ouerthrowing of Images, but he writeth al
so against ye adoration of Images. His words are these:

                     Lib. 1. De cultu imagin. Claudius praesul Ecclesiae Taurinensis,
&amp;c. Claudius bishop of the Church of Taurine sawe
his flocke (among other things which it did worthy
of reformation) to be giuen to the superstitious, yea
the pernicious worshipping of images, of which disease,
some of those partes are sicke of an olde rooted
custome, &amp;c. So that not onely Claudius, but also Ionas,
was directly contrary to this tenth article.
               
               Touching the brabling distinction of Latria &amp;
Daulia, I referre the reader to mine answere to Doctor
Sanders booke of images, Cap. 6. or 5. as also for that
noble argument that followeth, whereby he woulde
proue that Papistes cannot commit idolatrie.
               That M. Calfhill affirmeth outward profession to
be necessary for euery Christian man. Martiall saith,
he condemneth his doctrine of onely faith iustifying.
Ver
                     •
                  ly, a clubb is more meere then an argument, to
beate it into such an Asses head, that when we teache
that onely faith doth iustifie, we say not, that God requireth

nothing of a Christian man but faith onely.
Againe, who would vouch safe to answere his quarreling
of true faith, without confession? The ruler
                        •
                      beleeued,
but did not confesse, Iohn. 12. here was faith (quod Martiall)
but no confession. But who will graunt that here
was a true iustifying faith? Likewise this argument:
There is a corporall seruice of outwarde gesture due to God,
therefore it is no idolatrie to kneele before an image. And againe:
Protestants kneele before images in glasse windowes,
and holde vp their handes at Paules crosse, therefore they defile
their bodies with sacrilege. And if they excuse themselues
by their good intent, the same will serue the Papistes which adore
the image for that it representeth Christ or his saintes.
               
               But protestants adore no images, with any intent, thou
foolish aduocate of Idolaters, no more then Martiall
doth reuerence to a dogg, when he putteth of his cap,
or maketh curtesie in any house, where a dogge is before
him. And verily he sayeth, a man may as well be
suspected for idolatrie, if he bowe before any visible
creature, as if he kneele before an image. But not so
probably, as Martiall may be suspected to be out of
his wits, when he maketh such comparisons. The
Iewes were not onely suspected, but also affirmed by
the Gentyles to worship the clowdes &amp; the power of
heauen, because in prayer they looked vp to heauen:
Qui puras nubes, &amp; Coeli 
                        ••
                     men adorant, sayeth the Poet
of them. Wherefore by Martials comparison, they
might as wel haue prayed before images. And where
he sayeth, that Protestants condemne outward things
except hattes, beardes, barrell breeches, &amp;c. he sheweth
his vanitie. Our iudgement concerning outwarde
things that serue for order and comlinesse (being not
defyled with idolatrie and superstition) is sufficiently
knowen. What wee teach of fasting &amp; praying, vowing,
&amp;c. it were superfluous here to repeate, when publike
testimonies of our doctrine are daily giuen, both
in preaching and writing. And surely I am to blame
y• vouchsaue such vaine calumniating of any mention.

                  That not to bowe their knee to Baal is not a peculiar note
of Gods seruants, because other things are required in
Gods seruants, then to be free from idolatrie, it is a
foolish and more then childish quarrell. For in the
days of Elyas, that was a peculiar note to discern them
from idolaters, whom God had preserued both from
yelding to idolatrie in hart, &amp; also from d
                     •
                  ssembling
with outwarde gesture. But Martiall would learne
whether M. Calfhill kneeling downe before his father
to aske him blessing, did not commit idolatrie.
How often shall I tell him: he is an Asse that cannot
make a difference betweene ciuill honour and religious
worship. And once againe he must be answered,
why the people are suffered to sweare vpō a book,
with their cappes in their hands, rather then to kneele
before the crosse in doing of their adoration to God.
If he will be answered, I will tell him againe, partly
because it is against ciuil honestie that the people
should stande couered before the Iudge, partly because
they sweare by the name of God, whome they
ought to reuerence. But kneeling before a crosse to
worship it, is manifest idolatrie, and expressely forbidden
by the lawe of God. Thou sh
                     •
                  lt not bowe
downe to them nor worship them. The people are
not allowed to put off their cappes to the booke, neither
yet to sweare by the booke.
               When Martiall can proue, that it is lawfull for
Christians to worship images, then we will graunt, it
is vncharitable to iudge them idolaters that kneele
before them.
               But he will not graunt the crosse to be nothing in
that sense that Saint Paul sayeth, an Idoll is nothing,
because it is a representation of a thing that was, by
this reason the image of Iupiter, Hercules, Romulus,
which were men sometime, were no idols. The image
of the Sunne, of an Oxe, an Ape, a Catt, &amp;c. worshipped
of the Egyptians, were no Idols, neither was the
worshipping of them idolatrie. The questions to be

propounded in the Chauncery, I leaue to Martiall to
propounde him selfe. But where he sayeth, that no
euidence of any idolatrous fact in worshipping the
crosse can be shewed in true Christians, I agree with
him: but in Papistes, if he meane them, great euidence.
Who went a Pilgrimage to the roodes of Bostone,
Douercourt and Chester, were they not Papistes? who
made the roodes to sweate, to bleede, and to smell
sweete as D. Reade did with his roode of Becclys,
were they not Papistes? Finally, who sayeth &amp; singeth
to the Crucifix? Aue rex noster, &amp;c. All haile our
King: All haile, O crosse our onely hope, &amp;c. I doubt
not but the countrey of Christian men, wil iudge this
as good euidence for pulling downe the crosse, as Ezechias
had for destroying the brazen Serpent.
               It is Martials poore iudgement, when you see men
praying, they be Christian men: therefore they serue
God in spirite and truth: but afterward, he restrayneth
it to men that were baptised in Christ. Yet may they
be heretikes, and therfore no true worshippers of God.
But y• which he spake in way of humilitie, he will now
say stoutly: Sir when you see men, that is to say men that are
baptised, men that beleeue in God, praying yea before an image,
and holding vp their handes, and knocking their breastes, it is a
good consequent to say they be Christian men. Ergo they serue
God in spirite and trueth: and we may not iudge the contrary.
This argument holdeth of the place of stoutnesse. For
other consequence there is none in it, nor yet wittie
conueyance. For first when I see men, I must say, they
be men that are baptised, and beleeue in God. Whereas
by sight I can not perceiue that they are baptised, &amp;
yet if I know that they be baptised, I can not tell whether
they beleeue in God, as Christians, or as heretikes,
or whether they be hipocrites without faith. How shal
I then iudge them to be Christian men? Finally when
I see them do an open acte, contrary to Christian profession,
yet by Martials diuinitie, I may not iudge, but
that they be good Christians, and worship God in spirite

and truth. Euen as by his Canon law, I am taught,
that if I see a prieste embrasing of a woman, I must
iudge he doeth it for no harme, but to blesse her. To
be shorte. Martials good consequent, wil make him
confesse, that al the protestantes that holde vp their hands
at Paules crosse, and say Amen when the preacher her sayeth, God
confound the Papistes, (whereat he scoffeth) be Christian
men, and worship God in spirite and trueth. As for
their adoration of the crosse, he saith standeth as well
with the glorie of God, as our kneeling at the communion,
putting off our cappes to the cloth of estate,
to the Princes letters, bowing to the Princes
person, kissing of the booke, &amp;c. So that with him
thinges by God expressely forbidden, stande as well
with his glorie, as things by him commanded and permitted.
In the end, complayning that Maister Calfhill
hath not answered him to thirtie places out of the auncient
writers, whereof let the Readers when they haue
compared, iudge, he glorieth that his rayling &amp; slanderous
conclusion, is not dealt withall, but by silence,
which silence he taketh for a confession: but in deede
it is a sufficient confutation of such lies and slaunders
as haue no colour of trueth in them. Our Sauiour
Christ being called a Samaritan made none answer to
it. Socrates an Heathen man, kept silence when a varlet
railed on him, wherfore silence in such case as this,
is neither a confession, nor a conuiction. To conclude,
I will not altogether refuse, as Maister Calfhil doth, to
deale with So 
                        •
                     ewde an aduersarie as Martiall is, but I
would wishe that the Papistes for their credites sake,
would henceforward set forth a better champion for
their causes, or else helpe him with better weapons to
fight in their quarrel. For in this reply he doth
nothing in a maner, but either conster like
an Vsher, or quarrell like a
dogbolt Lawier.
               FINIS.
