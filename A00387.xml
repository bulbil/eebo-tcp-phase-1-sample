            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

In that he was god of god: he was lorde of all the world / and that not another sondry lorde from the father / lykewise as he is not a sondry god from the father. But after a certayne specyal and peculiar maner he is called the lorde of the electe and chosen / whom he hathe wonne and delyuered from the dominiō of Satan and hathe made them to hym a people of acquisition.i.

There is greate difference betwē the nature of man as it was fyrst created: and the same nature as it is after the fall of Adam.

or agreynge to the dignite of that persone / which was both god and man: orels which do exclude (as I sayde before) the fullnesse of grace. For neither dyd he receiue proclyuyte or redynes to do synne: no neither yet so much as power to synne: neither dyd he receyue or take vnto hym erroure or ignoraunce. And those incōmodytes / whiche he dyd receyue &amp; take vpon hym: he toke them on hym / not of the necessite of nature: but voluntarely for our sake / to make satisfaction for our offences / &amp; to suffre for that whiche we hadde trespased. DIS. Why dyd he chaunge the preposition here sayenge de spiritu sancto / er Maria virgine? MAG. The Grekes haue but one and the same preposition ex in both places: but the signification of this preposition is diuerse. All thynges are ex ipso et per ipsum (id est) of hym / and by hym: as of theyr authoure &amp; begynner. A pece or goblete is made ex auro (id est) of golde: as of the matter or stuffe / ex arbore nascitur arbor (id est) of one tree cometh another tree: by propagation of kynde.

That the holye ghoste toke one of the moste purest droppes of bloude out of the virgine Maries herte / and layde it downe into her matrice: and that hereof sodeynly was made the perfighte body of a man / soo smalle as is a lytle spyder whiche is but euen nowe cropen forthe from the egge: But yet with all the membres fulle fynyshed and perfyghte: and that in the

But this is sufficiente for vs / that he was ones in fleshe borne a very man / that he dyd veryly suffre passyon / that he hathe veryly

Other some agayn dyd fayne / that Christe hymselfe is in dede risen agayne / but yet that our bodyes shall neuer reuyue nor rise agayne whome saynte Paule dothe openly confute / gatherynge / that it dothe necessaryly folowe / i.

For lykewyse as he dyd suffre for our sakes / that we sholde be delyuered by hym from eternall deathe / euen so hathe he also rysen agayne for our sakes / that by hym we sholde gete and obtayne eternal lyfe.i. Cor. xv. He rose beynge the fyrste frute of them that slepe. But he that is the fyrst can not be alone / neither wyll the hede leue or forsake his membres.

Certayne men folowyng Ualentine for theyr authoure / do graunte and confesse the resurrection of the spirite and of the soule:Ualentine. but the resurrection of the bodyes they do denye / not withstondynge / that in Christe was shewed the example and paterne of our resurrection. Nowe he rose agayne whole / that is to saye both in body and soule. But what sholde a man stryue agaynste them / that doo denye the euidente scripture / and agreynge with it selfe in so many places? For nothynge hathe ben taughte more diligently of the Euangelystes: than the argumentes and proffes of the resurrection. And saynte Paule dothe not onely confirme the resurrection in euery place: but he dothe also describe the maner of the resurrection to the Corinthianes / and to the Thessalonianes.i. Cor. xv. i. Thessa. iiii. For as for the opinion of them / that were called ChiliasteChiliaste. (whiche dyd dreame / that by the space of a thousand yeres / after the risynge agayn of our bodyes / we shall enioye plentuosly in this world all suche maner pleasures / wherewith the bodyly senses are delyted and pleased) it is not worthy to be called an opinion / but raither a prodigiouse and a wondrefull



madde erroure. And as for all the cauillations whiche mānes witte dothe engendre / howe or by what meanes the same bodye / whiche hath ben so manye maner wayes chaunged from one thynge into another / can be restored agayne the very same in noumbre: these cauyllations (I saye) are shaken of and putte awaye by faythe and beleffe / by whiche we do beleue / that he is god / and that he is almyghty / whiche worketh all these thynges / &amp; that he is not subiecte vnder the lawes of nature: whiche dyd create and make nature. And what meruayle is it / yf he dothe restore the body of that thynge / that is: whiche dyd fyrste at the begynnynge make heuen and earth and aungelles all of nothynge. And seynge that we do dayly see soo many miracles in the workes of nature / as for exaūple / of a very lytle sede to ryse a great strong tree: and of a gressehoper nowe beynge olde / by castynge of his skynne to flye forthe a yonge one: &amp; of a Eruoa (id est) cankerworme redy to dye / to lepeforthe a lusty and a swyfte Papilionem .i. butterfly: why sholde ony thynge seme vnbeleueable / which / god that is almighty dothe worke contrary to the lawes and

So he whiche as touchyng his diuine nature:

Why is it called a secrete or priuyter



MAG. Because the commune sorte of the people was secluded and kept a part from the medlyng with those thynges. Albeit nowe a dayes many thynges are done openly / as whan the water of baptyme is consecrated and halowed. But these ceremonyes and also the wordes wherwith they are done / were hyd and kepte secrete from the people / and were taughte amonge the byshopes from one to another / to the entent that men shold haue the sacramentes in more reuerēce and worshyp. As soon as euer the bysshop made redy and was aboutward to consecrate the brede and the wyne: it was not laufull for any lay men to remayne and abyde within the grates or chauncelle. And a certayne Pope of Rome / whan he had aunswered somewhat to a certayne byshope (as I wene of Englande) demaundynge a certayne question concernyng the rytes and ceremonyes of the mysteries / he durste not put in wrytyng the wordes / with which the oyle is cōsecrated and halowed / leste peraduenture if the lettres had ben taken by the waye (which thyng chaūceth oftentymes) the secret myght happe to haue ben vttered and dysclosed. This



cause in dede is some maner cause. But yet the more true &amp; more alowed cause is this.

But as farre forth as the contempte and despysynge of god doth redounde to the hurte of the neyghboure: so farre forthe this precept



doth also appertayne to the loue of our neyghboure / lykewyse as also euery iniurie done against our neyghboure doth appertayne to the contumelte and dishonoure of god / for as muche as in hym is / that man doth hurte god / which settyng at nought his commaundement / dothe hurte his neyghboure / but he is more nere to blasphemie / which doth begyle his neyghboure / swearynge by the name of god: than he is that disceyueth hym with symple and playne wordes without an othe / for he abuseth to his owne lewed affection and desyre / bothe the honoure of goddes name: and also the religion and deuotion of his neyghboure / whiche by reason of the name of god beyng put to / doth beleue hym vpon his othe / and wolde not haue beleuyd hym without an othe. To the secounde doute I make this aūswere.To the seconde. The name of god spoken or pronounced of man / is a creature / neyther to that worde is the knee bowed: but to hym whome that voyce or worde dothe signifye and betoken. Now it is nothyng lyke of an ymage / for there is no peryl lest the voyce or word of a man shold be worshypped: but in ymages there is no ieopardye / because



certain philosophers haue taught that lykewyse as into a body beyng aptely made of nature / a sowle doth entre: euen so into an ymage proprely and connyngly made deuylles or wycked spirites do entre in. And it is necessary that god by some sygne or token be declared and sygnifyed / for and vnto whiche vse the speche of man was chefely and principally instituted and ordayned.To the thyrd doute. To the thyrde doute this aunswere take thou / that (after my mynd) those men / which done swere in theyr dronkennesse / or in theyr angre / or whiche for the entent to dysceyue or to hurt / done wyttyngly for sweare theyrselues: are rayther breakers of the fyrst precept and commaundement / than of the second / for such maner persones (as thou doste saye) eyther do not beleue that god is / or els they do beleue that he is dull and foolyshe / that he dothe not knowe what men done / or els they beleuen / that he is slepy and retcheles / that he doth not care what they done / or that he is euyll / so that he doth fauour vices / or els vnryghtuouse / that he dothe not ponyshe noughtynes. But those persons / which eyther of custome / or els without great cause / do willfully



swere / they do synne &amp; trespase agaynste this seconde cōmaundement. And that I maye aunswere somewhat also vnto the fourth doute.To the .iii

The same thynge hathe semed best to certayn approued doctoures of the churche. But with what coloure the custome may be excused of thē / that nowe euery where done swere well nere in euery matter or busynesse / let other men loke / but veryly me semeth that an othe can scantly be excused / but eyther by necessyte / or els by the grauite and wayghtynesse of the matter. By often othes / we doo learne to forsweare our selues &amp; to make false othes. I can not tell whether any man doo swere well / which swereth willingly.Nota. S Paule doth sweare / but not for a cloke or garment / nor for money / but for the honoure and glorie of ye gospell.

                  elte doth corrupte the symple mynde of a yong damoysell.

                     maundemēt. than newe preceptes / for if he that hurteth his neyghboure with false



wytnesse / doth it for loue of lucre and aduauntage: it appertayneth than to the vii. precepte of thefte. If he dothe it for hatred / than appertayneth it to the .v. precept of manslaughter. Now so great was the grosnes of that people of the Iewes / that they dyd beleue / that there was no manslaughter / but that whiche was done with an iron weapon or a staffe / and yet is the tong more noysom and hurtfull than any weapon of yerne and stele.The tong is more noysom thā any weapon. Neyther is it much amysse or agaynste reason / lykewyse as vnder the name of of manslaughter is comprehended all maner hurtynge of the neyghboure: euen so vnder the name and tytle of false wytnesse all maner hurte &amp; dammage to be contayned / which we do to our neyghboure by the meane of our tonge / but Moyses dyd put a notable &amp; a greate exaūple / for false wytnesse doth comprehende also periurie / for in the old tyme both the iudges were sworne that dyd examine and take knowlege of any matter / and the wytnesses also were sworne / that made aunswere.

Neyther is he any whytte lesse a robber or a thefe / which putteth his neyghboure from his goodes by corrupte iudgement or false wytnesse: than is he / yt spoyleth hym by open robberye. The mynde and purpose is al one. The wyll is all one / onely the instrumēt is chaunged. Upon this rocke done all those stryke theyr shyp which eyther by backe bytyng or flateryng / or by crafty counsaylles / or els by corrupt doctrine / done hurte his neyghboure / which thynges the more that they are contrarie vnto christiane charite: by so muche they doo come nerer vnto deadly synne.The .ix. and the .x. precept Exodi .xx. The other two preceptꝭ are put ioyntly both to gether. In Exodi in this wyse.
               ☞Thou shalt not desyre the house of thy neyghboure / neyther shalt thou desyre his wyfe / nor his seruaunt / nor his handemayde / nor his oxe / nor his asse / nor any of all the thynges that are his. In Deuterono. they are putte in this wyse. Thou shalte not desyre the wyfe of thy neyghboure / not his house / not his land / not his bondman not his hādmayde / not his oxe / not his asse / nor any of all the thynges yt do belong to hym / If thou do separate &amp; departe the concupiscence



&amp; desyre of the wyfe / from the concupiscence of the other possessions: than shall they be two commaundementes / of the whiche the foremore appertayneth to adulterie / the lattermore vnto thefte. D. What nedeth these two cō
                  maundementes? Doth not he that forbyd the an euyll dede: in so doynge forbyd also an euyll wyll &amp; an euyll desyre? MA. This thyng was done because of the rudenesse &amp; grosnesse of that people / whiche because there was no penaltye sette or appoynted by the lawe vnto a lewde and vngratious desyre: wolde els haue beleued / that that thyng had ben no synne afore god which is vnponished among men / not for that it is no synne: but for that mannes thought is moueable &amp; ofte tournynge / &amp; the dede may be proued / but the wyll is knowen onely to god.why the desyre of periurie &amp; of murdre were not expresly forbydden. D. But why was not concupiscence or desyre expresly mentioned and spoken of in the precept or commaundement that forbyddeth periurie and manslaughter? MA. There are some men that doo make aunswere in this wyse / that the affection &amp; the desyre of fleshely pleasure / &amp; the desyre of hauyng / that is to saye / lecherye &amp; couetousnes are more



inwardly roted in all men by nature: than are the desyre of periurie and manslaughter / for from these we do abhorre rather vnlesse it be so / that a violent desyre &amp; passion dothe oppresse the iudgement of nature. But the nation of the Iewes was more enclyned to vēgeaūce thā vnto fleshely luste / &amp; therfore it was permitted them to gyue a lettre of diuorcement.Deute. xxiiii. But as me semeth (that I may saye my mynde without any mannes grefe or displeasure) ConcupiscenceHow concupiscence is taken in these .ii. preceptes. here in this place doth not so much signifye what so euer maner desyre of another mannes wyfe or of another mānes possession / as it doth betoken the enforcement or endeuoure &amp; goyng about to do an euyll dede (Lykewyse as we are sayd in the Latyne tonge appetere aliquem insidus / not for that we haue hurt hym / but for that by worky

Neyther is euery thefte ponyshed with deathe / neyther euery endeuourment and attemptynge of adulterie / for men are not ponyshed / except they be taken in the dede doyng. But manslaughter committed is ponyshed with death / and the attemptyng of it / or ye goyng about to do it / draweth a man into daunger and peryll of iudgement. For this cause is concupiscence expresly forbyden in those thynges / in which the onely attemptyng is not ponyshed. Here I do see certayne men to haue laboured about this yt he myghte reduce all preceptes eyther byddyng or forbyddyng any thynge to be done vnto these .x. commayndementes afore reher

For after this maner there is made a confusion &amp; menglyng to gether of all the preceptes



all are comprehended vnder one precept and otherwhyles agayne one and the same are comprehended vnder dyuerse preceptꝭ. Besydes this seyng that these lawes were gyuen to the vplandyshe &amp; rude vnlearned people (and a law ought to be playne / clere / and open) how could the Iewes suspecte or deme / that vnder the name of adulterie is forbyden all mā

It is therfore after my mynd the more simple and playne way / to say / that these .x. commaundementes were gyuen to the intractable and stourdy people / as fyrst rudimētes or principles / that they shold not fall into all vices and synnes / but that from these fyrst principles and begynnynges they sholde profyte and goo foreward vnto the other preceptꝭ which are innumerable bothe in the lawe / and also in the ꝓphetes / and also in the prouerbes of Salomon / vntyll they myght come vnto the euangelicall perfection / wherof certayne both exaumples &amp; also counsayles and commaundementes are contayned also euen in the bokes of the
