            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAIESTIE, OVR GRATIOVS Soueraigne, IAMES by Gods mercifull prouidence of great Britaine, France and Ireland, the most potent and illustrious Monarch, and most deseruedly instiled, Defender of the true Catholike and Apostolike FAITH.
            
               IT is accounted of S.t 
               Augustine, (and not without cause) grande miraculum, a great and wonderfull miracle, ineruditos liberalibus disciplinis &amp;c. that the Apostles of our Sauiour, twelue poore men (fishermen, publicanes, and such like) neuer brought vp in learning, and in comparison of the gentile Philsophers, altogether vnlettered, not skilfull in Grammar, not armed with Logike, not swelling with eloquence and Rhetorike, should yet be able by the helpe of Christ, to entangle in the nets of

faith, in a manner the people of the whole world, and amongst the rest the very Philosophers themselues. For of them and their time was veryfied that of the Prophet,Psal. 19.4. Their sound is gon out into all lands, and their wordes vnto the ends of the world. Those people, that noe force or power of the Romanes (masters of the world) could bring to the obedience of the Roman lawes, although they subdued their persons, Scythians, Indians, Aethiopians, Parthians, Germans, and Britans (so speaketh Theodoret reckoning many other Nations beside) these same fishermen,De cur: Gr: affect: l: 9. vsing neither weapons nor souldiers, nor any other inforcinge meanes th

               n perswasions and the examples of their vertues, as especially of their patience of injuries and afflictions; induced notwithstanding to subject themselues vnto the lawe of a man done to death by the base, seruile, and most shamefull punishment of the crosse. A branch or limme of this miracle I haue taken vpon mee to describe, euen soe far forth as it concerneth this our Britaine, and haue presumed to offer the same vnto your Majestie; as an argument, if it were well handled, not vnworthy your consideration. For whereas this worke consisteth of two parts, being both narrations, one reporting the historie of our conuersion from Paganisme vnto Christian religion; the other containing a memoriall of the liues and actions of such as from time to time haue been the principall instruments of the propagation and continuance of that first plantation: It will lay open two poynts ministring matter of greate and most just glorie, both vnto your selfe and the Dominions ouer which God of his goodnesse hath placed you: the first, shewing, that heere the miracle aforesaid

had his first operation; as the second, that heere likewise it hath found the most effectuall operation.
            For first, it will appeare (that which Sabellicus hath well noted) how that Omnium Prouinciarum prima, Britannia, publicitùs Christi nomen recepit;Ennead: 7 lib: 5. In which respect it is worthylie called Primogenita ecclesiae, the first begoten daughter of the church of God: secondly, that the godly care and judicious choyce of your Majesty, hath afforded vnto our Church such Pastors both for pietie and learning, as neither can any age past in our country, nor any other country in the world at this present, be compared justly with vs, for abundance of Preachers of Gods truth, men indued with excellent learning, and moreouer by Godlinesse of life and good example confirminge what they teach; howsoeuer by the slaunderous mouthes as well of Puritanes as Papists, imputations are dayly cast vpon vs importing the contrary. In the former of these I haue the more willingly taken paynes, by inlarging that which heeretofore I haue written to that purpose somewhat more breefly th

               n were expedient; because I perceiue that diuers of late yeeres haue greatly endeuoured, to deduce the pedegree of our Christianitie from Rome, by making the Bishops thereof the first authors of the same. And heerein they haue been soe earnest, as well we might maruaile they should soe (incalescere in re frigida) but that one of them telleth vs in plaine tearmes,N: D: in hist: 3. conuers: we haue in that respect such an obligation to the See of Rome, as needs we must mayntaine that religion that is nowe taught and mayntained there by the Bishops of the same. Were the antecedent all true, we might not allow the consequence for good.

               Epist: 178. saith, that faith and religion sprang first from the Grecians. Heereupon may we in like sort conclude, that Tertullian was perswaded, wee ought euer to mantaine the doctrine taught in Ierusalem &amp; by the Bishops thereo

Augustine in the place before named, approued once for all, all such opinions as the Greeke Church should at any time happen to defend. Nowe although the consequence being so weake, the argument of it selfe falleth to the ground; yet, in as much as, going about to make good the antecedent (which is notoriously false) these men they cast a myst before our eyes in deprauing and falsifying the history of our Church: I haue thought good to indeuour, that the very truth in that behalfe may appeare, as by testimonies worthy credit and without exceptions I trust it shall. For the other poynt, concerning the vertues and sufficiency beyond all exception of those Prelates, our Church hath brought forth since the reformation of the same; I feare I haue dealt but too too modestlie, refusinge to yeelde to them their due prayses, least I should seeme to flatter men, that either in person, or by their neere friendes and

posterity are as it were yet present amongst vs. For

wanting, I haue thought it not amisse, to deliuer a breefe rehearsall of such of our English nation, as either were, or are reported to haue been Cardinalls of the Church of Rome. And to these I haue yeelded a place amongst our English Prelates; first because they were men for the most part very memorable, famous in their times, and endued with extraordirie gifts: Secondly to this intent, that where of late yeeres a great volume hath been published at Rome, by one Ciaconius, containing the liues of the Bishops and Cardinalls of the same, a worke (as it is pretended) of great perfection; it may appeare vnto the world, that there as well as elsewhere, some thinges glister which are not gold, many particulars being misreported concerning our Country-men; which may assure vs, the rest of that worke so highly esteemed, to be but eiusdem farinae; and in other parts as well as these, full fraught with the like vntruthes and errours. Now whereas by reason of a mischance in our coppy, and my absence, the Printer hath not been able to doe his duty so well, as that many thinges are not mistaken; I must earnestly intreate the Reader, to take notice of the corrections; the want whereof may greatly wrong both me and himselfe. That done, I trust these my labours shall find the like acceptance as my former did; the which I must commend vnto the mercie and goodnes of our gracious God, whose name be blessed and praised now and for euermore.

            A DISCOVRSE CONCERNING THE first conuersion of this Island of BRITAINE vnto Christian Religion.
            
               CHAP. I.
               
                  DIuers yéeres after the ascension of our Sauiour Christ into heauen, his Apostles continued at Ierusalem, as we may perceiue in the story of their 
                     Act. 8.1. Acts. But Iames being slaughtred by the sword of Herod, 
                  
                     Act. 12.2. and Peter appointed vnto the like paine (which by the miraculous assistance of God he escaped) being also persecuted of the Iewes with great malice and cruelty;
                     The Apostles d
                           •
                        sperse themselues.
                   they all (except only Iames, commonly called frater Domini, the brother of our Lord, because hée was his néere kinsman, who was left at Ierusalem, as Bishop and Gouernour of that Church) they all (I say) dispersed themselues amongst the gentiles. So saith 
                     Homil. 70. in Matth. c. 22. 
                  S. Chrysostome, Apostoli praedicauerunt Iudaeis, longo
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      temporis spatio caesi &amp; flagellati in Iudaea manentes; ac demum ab ipsis propulsi, in gentes profecti sunt. And this came to passe (as Baronius 
                  
                     Annal. to. 1. in anno Christi 44. probably deduceth) in the second yeare of Claudius the Emp. the year of Christ 44. although there want not some to affirme

                   (if happily they bee his) affirming how that the first Churches of Italy, France, Spaine, Africa, Sicilia and the Ilands that ly betwixt them, were founded by S. Peter, or such as he or his successours had ordained to the Ministery; whereof if we can conclude any thing in this case, it is that the British churches in the iudgement of Innocentius were founded neither by S. Peter, nor by either his schollers or successours. For it is manifest, that he intending to de

                  cipher vnto vs the particularity of those Churches, that the Apostle aforesayd had caused to be conuerted to the faith in the West part of the world, hath plainely excluded ours; that is neither any of those he hath by name set downe, nor any Island lying betwixt them. If the question had been concerning Sardinia or Corsica, Maioica, Minorca, Malta, or any other Island of the Mediterran sea (of such at least as do lie betwéen Europe and Africke) the conclusion had béene for the Jesuite; but our Britaine lying quite out of the compasse of Innocentius his limitation. I see no meanes to auoyd it, but that thereby we are vtterly excluded. For be sides that it is vnlikely, he would haue emitted by name to set down the same, being the most noble &amp; renowmed of all Islands thē known to our world, whē 
                  Sicile was not forgotten that cannot make the fifth part of Britain; if he had had any intent to draw vs within the bounds by him pitched, he

               Now therefore to passe vnto the third testimony, it consisteth of certaine words of Gildas,
                  
                     In initio Epistolae.
                   taken out (not of his Epistle de excidio Britanniae, as the Conuersioner falsly quoteth) but out of another discourse intituled Castigatio in Ecclesiasticum ordinem. The words are these. Sedem Petri Apostoli immundis pedibus vsurpantes, sed merito cupiditatis in Iudae traditoris pestilentem Cathodram desidentes. Wherein I sée not any more proofe that S. Peter preached Christ héere, then that Iudas the traytour preached against Christ else where, which I suppose is not to be shewen. The meaning of those words for my part I cannot conceiue to be other then this, that in abusing and prophaning so excellent and holy a function, immundis manibus sacra contrectando, they did rather represent and imitate Iudas that betrayed Christ, then Peter and the rest of the Apostles that faithfully preached him.
               Besides these before-mentioned testimonies, he offreth vs for proofe a monkish dreame taken out of Alredus Rieuallensis, and the bare assertion of one Gulielmus Eysengrenius a late writer; neither tone nor tother carrying with them any weight at all. Against all which, I will oppose two reasons, I thinke not so easie to be answered.
               The trauailes of the rest of the Apostles, being so diligently and particularly recorded by writers of al sorts (as before I haue related) how is it possible that this so important a worke of S. Peter (not the meanest of the Apostles) should finde mention no where, either in our particular Chronicles, or in the generall story of the Church, nor amongst any of the ancient writers, sauing onely at the hands of Metaphrastes, an authour not very ancient (for he liued about the yéere 900.) and moreouer so farre distant from our country (to wit at Constantinople) as he had not any such speciall opportunity to take notice of those antiquities concerning our Church; which so many other men very diligent collectours and excellently learned, dwelling as it were amongst vs, could neuer light vpon?
               Againe, whereas all that séeme perswaded of S. Peters comming into this Island (Baronius, Parsons, and the rest) assigne the particular time to be none other than that, when as all Iewes were cōmanded by a publique edict of Claudius the Emp. to depart

out of the City of Rome (the which thing is mentioned not only in the Scripture
                     Act. 18.2., but in many other

                   authors also) Metaphrastes (the Conuersioner his chiefe piller) affirmeth, that he failed immediately from Rome into Africke, where he founded the Church of Carthage, and left to gouerne the same Crescens his disciple, departing thence into Alexandria, of which Church he ordained Bishop S. Marke, and then from Alexandria tooke his iourney to Ierusalem. Héerunto accordeth Onuphrius in his notes vpon Platina, that making no mention of any trauaile of S. Peter at that time either Northward or Westward,
                     Ad vitam S. Petri.
                   sayth, Edicto Claudiano quo Iudaei pulsi sunt, Petrus Roma exire coactus, Hiesolymam reuersus est. And least we should thinke he might stay there but some short time and then passe westward againe, he addeth, Ibi cōcilio Apostolorū de abrogāda circūcisione, &amp; morti beatissimae virginis interfuit.
                  
                     Bellarmin to. 1. de Rom. Pont l. 2. c. 6. The same is likewise affirmed by Bellarmin who describeth the trauailes of S. Peter in this sort: Igitur ex Iudea, &amp;c. The 5. yeare after the passion of our Sauiour, Peter trauailed from out of Iury into Syria and setled himselfe at Antiochia, continued Bishop of that city allmost 7. yeares. Howbeit we are not to perswade our selues that in all the space he neuer parted from that place; for it is certaine that at that time hée ranged ouer all the countryes adioyning, Pontus, Asia, Galatia, Cappadocia, Bythinia. But the seuenth yeare after hée became Bish. of Antiochia (which was the 13 after the passion of our L.) hée returned to Hierusalem, &amp; béeing there apprehended of Herod was cast into prison in the dayes of swéete bread. Act. 12. But soone after, hée béeing deliuered by the Angell, the same yeare, (which was the 2. of the reigne of Claudius) hée came to Rome fixed now his seate or sea there, and held the same 25. yeares. Yet he remained not all the time at Rome, but after hée had preached 7. yeares there, hée returned to Hierusalem being expulsed out of Rome by Claudius together with all the Iewes that were then in Rome. And then a little after, when therfore (sayth hée) they which were at Antioch, heard how that Peter was come to Ierusalem, they sent vnto him Paule and Barnabas, and then was called together the Councell of Ierusalem: but Claudius being dead, Peter returned to Rome and there ended his life. Thus far Bellarmin. These things being considered, and search made

amongst such authors as are without exception; if we affirm that S. Peter was neuer further westward in Europe th

                  n Italy, I assure my selfe it will neuer bée disprooued.
               So, though we should account it a greate glory to our nation, to deriue the pedigrée of our spirituall linage, from so noble and excellent a father as S. Peter; yet reason of the one side, and want of authority on the other, enforceth vs to rest persuaded, that S. Peter neuer saw this Island.

                  Concerning S. Pauls being in our Britayn, the proofes are much more pregnant. In the same chapter where he saith of himselfe 
                     Rom: 15.16. that he had filled all nations with the Gospell of Christ as farre as Illyricum, he declareth his certayne purpose and determination of trauayling into Spayne, by twice mentioning the same. And in as much as after his deliuerance out of prison at Rome, in the 5. yeare of Nero, he liued many yeares at liberty; 
                     vers. 24.23.I see no reason why we should doubt but that he satisfyed that his so earnest a desire by making a iourney thither and spending some time there. Howbeit our Romanists, not induring to heare of any good to slowe from any other fountayn then their Rome, diuers of them mayntayne stifly that S. Paule neuer perfourmed the sayd voyage.

                  Ioseph of Arimathia was not onely driuen out of Ierusalem at the time of the generall dispersion of the disciples after the death of Stephen, but also

caryed to the sea side, and there put into a ship or boate without either sterne or tackle, together with Lazarus, Mary Magdalen, Martha, and others, and so turned loose into the sea; where they were protected by the powerfull goodnesse of God from the daunger of drowning, and brought safe vnto Marseilles in Fraunce, whence (saith this author) Ioseph sayled into Britayn and there ended his life.
               The occasion of which his Iourney hither, Freculphus Bishop of Lexouia that flourished A. 840. reporteth to be this,

                   that when Philip the Apostle (or as some thinke rather the Euangelist: for their actions are much confounded in histories) preaching Christ in Fraunce, had much to doe with the Druides who had their beginning and cheife Doctors in Britayn, in so much as no man was estéemed his crafts master amongst them, that had not spent some time there, as Caesar

De bello Gall. lib. 6. witnesseth; and vnderstanding that this our Island was seperated from Fraunce by a small cut of a few houres sayle: He thought good to send ouer hither 12. preachers, the chiefe whereof was Ioseph afore sayd; the which ariuing here the yeare of Christ 63. did their best indeuour for the conuersion of our Britaynes to the faith. The place where they principally setled themselues, was euen there where Glastonbury now standeth néere Welles, which being at that time &amp; long after, an Island all compassed about with lakes and standing water, was giuen vnto them by the King of those parts; beside wt 2. other Kings after him (as our histories moreouer reporte) gaue vnto each of those 12. a hyde of land, which now we commonly terme a plow land, in the country néere adioyning, and they are named to this day the 12. hydes of Glastonbury.
               
               In this Island (then called Auallon) Ioseph and his fellowes found meanes to build a Church or Chappell, and were the first beginners of that famous &amp; auncient monastery there yet partly standing, in which Ioseph, after the course of his life finished an. 76. and was buried,

That by some heretique the sayd custom should be brought in after the Gospell planted, hath no likelihood. Doctrine is much more easie to bee corrupted then discipline: the one is done, paulatim, by little and little, in corners, worketh most commonly vppon

But in discipline once established, there cannot bée the least alteration sine strepitu; none so simple but they take notice of it; and the wisest sort discerne, that it is much better to indure some inconuenience in that kinde, then to hazard the danger of change by innouation.
               Now although the contrary cannot appeare, but that Damianus and Faganus, first, and after them Germanus and Lupus might endeauour the alteration of this vsage concerning the obseruation of Easter, and we neuer heare any thing of the same; yet it is very probable, hauing their hands full enough otherwise, the matter being of no great importance, they would rather leaue it vnstirred, then by dealing with too many things at once, hazard the whole successe of their enterprise.

               It could not be denied vnto them, that the Churches of Asia founded by S. Iohn had béene wont to hold their Easter the fourtéenth day of the moone:
                     Luna. 14. yea and much deale did at that present, celebrating it after the same manner that our Scots and Britaines did; neither could Wilfride deny the same in the solemne disputation held about that matter at Strenaeshalch (now called Whitby in Yorke-shire) mencioned by Beda. Nay rather it is to be thought,

                   howsoeuer Honorius the Bishop of Rome (who séemeth to say so in Beda) might be falsly enformed; séeing it appeareth by the allegation of Colman, not denyed by the aduerse party, that it was practised by Columba and his successors for the space of 70. yeares before the time of the conference mentioned in the sayd Beda, and how long before that by other, no man is able to say. And theerefore except our aduersaries can shew vs when and where it was brought in other wise, we haue no reason but to thinke that it had his beginning amongst vs together with Christian religion it selfe.
               
                  In this point how the conuersioner behaueth himselfe, how bustly he searcheth and how gréedily he maketh aduantage of the least hold he can get, it is a world to sée. One while he will make Pelagius the heretique authour or that kinde of obseruation, or else his fellow Celestius; Another while, he sayes the Britons fell vpon it he can not tell how; and lastly he thinketh it probable that it was imparted vnto them by the Scottish nation of Ireland, or of the Isles Hebrides. Marry how they should come by it he cannot tel without the helpe of two or thrée peraduentures.
               If Pelagius or his fellow had béen authour of such an innouation, how can we thinke it possible that they which write against him should neuer mention the same, or that it should not be condemned amongst other their heresies?
               As for the conceipt of our deriuing that vsage from the Scots, it had béene much more probable to haue affirmed, that they had receiued it from vs. Palladius was not the first preacher of Christ in Scotland, as many make him. For if Christian religion were generally receiued i

And Ireland has vndoubtedly for his first Apostle, Patrike, a student of that worthy colledge of Auallon or Glastonburie. So that we must say and maintaine, Ioseph of Arimathaea the disciple of our Saui

All these things are deliuered either by our aduersaries themselues or by authours approoued by them, as hath béene partly shewed héeretofore, and heereafter by Gods grace more at la

But because amongst so many as write the history of K. Lucius there is no one that I haue met withal, who ioyneth with him in this report, and the times of their ayes agrée not; I passe it ouer as a matter very vnlikely if not impossible to be true, and therefore, vnworthy further regard.

Whether it were one and the same woman that S. Paule so mentioned and Martial in these verses praysed, and whether she were mother to Praxedes and Pudentiana two famous and godly virgins, I will not stande to dispute, as being little to the purpose we ha

               That her husbands name was Pudens, vnto whome Martials

               To write therfore that which for mine own part I am persuaded to be the truth in this matter; I should coniecture, first, the aforesaide tradition to be vtterly vaine and vntrue: Secondly, that Pudens and Claudia were two young persons, but faithfull Christians, and at that time vnmaried when S. Paul writ the second Epistle vnto Titus, which was in the last yeare of Nero, as all men suppose that I haue read except Baronius: Then that their religion was a meanes which did conciliare nuptias, did worke their coniunction in mariage; for (as S. Bernard saith) amor spiritualis citò transit in carualem, if happily we may call that carnall loue which aimeth but at holy Matrimony: And lastly, that they were maried in the latter end of Vespasian, or about the beginning of Domitian, &amp; continued together til the raigne of Nerua, vnder whom (if not sooner) it is euident that his 11. booke of Epigrams was published: Which being from the time we

                  Well howsoeuer it was with them, of these times we speak of I doubt not we may vse the words of Cassiodorus concerning a later age: Superstite adhuc Constantio, &amp;c. Constantius (Chlorus) yet raigning it was not counted vnlawfull (saith hée) for those to be Christians that dwelt beyond Italy and Fraunce,
                  
                     Tripartit: hist: l. 1. c. 7. as in Britaine or néere the Pireney mountaines and so to the Western Ocean. Wherby vndoubtedly it came to passe, that many professing Christ, not daring to abide néere vnto the heart of the Empire (as in Italy, Fraunce or some other of the néerest prouinces) made choice of our Britayne &amp; some other remote places (though then very barbarous) where to leade their liues in such sort, as they might enioy liberty of conscience.
               In the number of these, I may well suppose A. Rufus Pudens before mentioned to be one, who after the time of his mariage, trauailed to these Northern parts of the world as it is playne by these verses following

                     Atque erat in gelido plurimus ore Pudens.
                     Si mihi lanificae ducunt non pulla sorores,

By meanes of these kind, of men (adding their helps vnto the successors of Ioseph and his disciples) I suppose it came to passe that Lucius a King of this country,
                     King Lucius his conuersion.
                   was drawen to a liking of Christian religion: Concerning whose conuersion, I will endeuour to set downe, first the causes, secondly the manner, and thirdly the sequell and effect of the same.
               For the causes, besides them aboue mentioned I finde another

touched in Galf. Monumethensis, where hée saith Sernauerant mentem eius miracula quae tyrones Christi per diuersas nationes faciebant.

Aurelius the Emp: if not a fauourable affection toward Christians, yet a stay of their persecutions, when that, raine was procured for his thirsting host by the prayers of Christians, with thunder and lightning that destroyed the enemies; for which cause he not only honoured the legion which consisted of them with the name of Thaumaturgus (as you would say the lightning legion) but also gaue streight charge vpon payne of death throughout all his Empire,

                  Molanus doe both acknowledge it:) as I discerne not what we may account in them either auncient or true. The words of Beda are these: Anno ab incarnatione Domini, &amp;c. The yeere of Christs incarnation, 56. M. Ant. Verus, the fourtéenth Emperour from Augustus began his gouernment together with Aur: Commodus his brother. In whose time, Eleutherius a holy man, sitting Bishop of the Roman Church; Lucius a King of the Brittanes writ vnto him his letters, praying that by his appointment and direction, he might be made a Christian. And presently hee obtained the effect of his godly desire: from which time, the Brittanes, vntill the raigne of Diocletian, inuiolably held the true faith vncorrupted in peace and quietnesse. Thus much Beda.
               
               Concerning this matter, Vsuardus our neighbor that writ his Martyrology at ye commandement of Carolus Magnus, about ye yeare 800. hath nothing at all: but that which Baronius calleth ye true Romane Martyrologe, addeth further vnto that of Beda, that Eleuthersus sent into Brittane Damianus and Fugatius, who baptized the said King Lucius,
                  
                     In 7. Kal. Iun.

                        •
                     um fere populum, and in a manner all the people of the Land. The historie of Landaff, (commonly called the booke of S. Teilo) saith, (that

which Baronius also deliuereth) how that the messengers sent vnto Eleutherius, were named Eluanus and Meduinus: and that propter eloquentiā &amp; scientiam in sacris Scripturis, in regard of their eloquence and knowledge in the Scriptures, Eluanus was by the said Eleutherius consecrated a Bishop, and Meduinus appointed a Doctor or teacher.
               The Author of the booke called Antiquitates Britannicae, out of Capgraue, and Bale out of Leland; report, how that Medwin was by birth a Dutchman, but as for Eluan, he was a Brittane brought vp in the Colledge or Monastery of Auallon amongest the Disciples and successors of Ioseph of Arimathaea; and had dispersed through the wilde fields of Brittane those first seedes of the Gospell sowed by the said Ioseph.
               
               Whether Lucius were baptized by these men, or some other sent by Eleutherius, it is not easily to be discerned. The history of Landaff aforesaid with diuers other deliuer, that it was done by Eluan and Medwyn: But by most it is affirmed, how that Elutherius sent with these two before named, two other, to order the state of the Church, who had the honour of performing that office.
               The one of them is called by some Damianus, by other Duuanus, and by other againe Deruianus, Derunianus, Dimianus, Diuianus, and Donatianus. Neither is the agreement much better about the name of the other; who is sometimes termed Faganus, and sometimes Fugatius.
               
               Concerning the time also of this conuersion, there is much difference amongst writers: The history of Landaff saith it was anno 156. (in which yeare Galfr. Monumeth: saies, the saide King died.) Nauclerus also setteth downe the same time, and so doth a Manuscript containing a story in Latine (but without the Authors name) now remaining in my custody. Nennius reporteth the messengers aforesaid were sent to Rome the yeare 163. mary not to Eleutherius, but to Euaristus. Another ancient Chronicle of mine written in English (a large history but namelesse also,
                     In lib. de Antiq. Glast. Mō
                     
                  ) appoints for the time of this conuersion the year 164. W. of Malmsburie concerning this matter hath these words, Fluxerunt anni ab aduentu, &amp;c. From the comming of the disciples of S. Philip into Brittane vnto the time that Phaganus,
                  
and Deruuianus arriued héere, there passed 103. yeares, by which reckoning it must fall out, they came the yeere 165. Henricus de Erfordia sayes it was the yeare 169. Marianus Scotus 177. Bale 179. Polydore Virgill, 182. Baronius 183. The history of the Church of Rochester 185. Flores historiarum. 187. &amp; lastly Martinus Polonus (to trouble the reader with no more) the yeare of Christ, 188.
               Whensoeuer it was that this good Prince receiued the faith of Christ; so it fell out (our histories say) that not onely his wife and family accompanied him in that happy course, but Nobles also and commons, Priests and people, high and low, euen all the people of this land which we now call England: And that generally all their Idoles where then defaced; the temples of them conuerted into Churches for the seruice of God; the liuings of their idolatrous Priests appointed for the maintainance of the Priests of the Gospell, and that in stead of the 25. Flamines, or high Priests of their Idoles, there were ordained 25. Bishops; as also for 3. Archflamines 3. Archbishops, whereof one was seated at London, another at Yorke, and a third at Carlion in Monmonthshire.
               Now whereas many of these points are (and not without good cause) called into question; it shall not be amisse, to spend some time in debating &amp; discussing of the same. First it is made a doubt whether euer there could be any such King as Lucius or no.

                   speaking of Cogidunus a King of our Brittane it was Vetus ac in pridem recepta populi Romani consuetudo, vt haberet instrument a seruitutis &amp; Reges, An olde fashion and long since put in vre by the Romanes; to haue Kings the instruments of their tyranny.
               
               Asia minor, in a manner all, after Mithridates and Antiochus were ouerthrowen, was brought into the perfect forme of a Prouince: Yet long after that, some petty kings raigned in diuers parts of it. Hee that will take the paines to reade but one chapter of Iosephus,
                  
                     Antiq. lib. 18, cap. 11. shall find mention of no lesse than fiue Kings of so many seuerall places in Asia; to wit, of Sigerammes King of the Emifeni; of Archelaus king of Cappadocia, of Antiochus king of the Comageni; of Herod and Agrippa, the one brother, the other sonne to Agrippa King of the Iewes, the which were, one after the tother, kings of Chaleis; and lastly of Alexander king of Lesis in Cilicia, by the appointment of Vespasian: all which raigned, eyther in or after the time of Augustus.
               
               But this in this case I haue obserued, that vpon euery change the iurisdiction and authoritie lightly was some what diminished, and the precinct of the gouernment lissened by cautoning out the territory of the same into seuerall portions and quillets, till at last the name and memory of kingly gouernment was quite extinguished. Héereof wée haue an example in Herod the great king of the Iewes,
                     Ios Ant, Iud. l. 17. c. 17. a man so greatly in fauour wt 
                  Augustus, as he gaue him leaue by his last will and testament to bequeath his kingdome to whom hee list; which thing he did, appointing vnto the same Archelaus his sonne. Howbeit, he being dead, the said Augustus allowed vnto Archelaus only the tone halfe of that his Father possessed, denying vnto him the name &amp; title of king; and bestowed the other halfe vpon Philip and Antipas his brethren, (whom he made Tetrarchs) of the which two Philip dying shortly after, his portion was added to the gouernment of Syria.
               
               This and many other like examples perswade me,
                     Lucius but a petty King.
                   that Lucius was neuer king of all Brittane (so long after the conquest of the same) but rather happily of some principall thereof.

                  Tacitus in Agricola, and Suetonius in the life of Claudius, doe both mention Reges Britanniae, the Kings of the Brittanes. And so in my conceit doth Iuuenal in these wordes:

                     Excidet Aruiragus.
                  
Where in my vnderstanding hee séemeth to say, thou shalt take prisoner one king or another of the Brittanes, or else at the least Aruiragus shall bée throwne downe from his seat of gouernment. But my principall argument in this case is, that no man I suppose, is able to shew, by any monument 500. yeare old, that euer before the Romanes time, either Brittane, or so much as that part sometime (as they say) called Loegria,

               Another thing now that séemeth vnlikely to mee in the foresaid report concerning king Lucius, is, the multitude of Bishops

and Bishopricks that are said to be ordained at that time. In the counsell of Arles—which was the year 325. mention is made of one Restitutus a Brittane Bishop not intituled to any certaine See, but onely called Britanniarum Episcopus. And euen so likewise after him Fastidius is mentioned of Gennadius by the same stile.

                   Which being considered, together with the rare and seldom mention that we find of Brittish Bishops, whose antiquities I haue hunted after with all dilligence; I cannot but rest perswaded, that our Brittane had very few Bishops, vntill the comming ouer of Germanus and Lupus to suppresse the Pelagian heresie; concerning which matter, I thinke it uot amisse to ofter vnto the reader that which I find in our history of Landaff.
               
               
                  Ad haeresim Pelagianam confutandam, sanctus Germanus Episcopus &amp; Lupus, a Galliae antistitibus ad Britannos missi sunt. Saepe tamen ante missis legatis a Britannis adeos, implorantibus auxilium contratam execrabile periculum; quia prauae doctrinae haereticorum non acquiescebant, ne

                      tamen consundere valebant. Postquam praedictiseniores Pelagianam haeresim extirpauerant, Episcopos pluribus in locis Britannia consecrauerunt. Super omnes autem Britannos dextralis partis Britannia, beatum Dubritium, summum doctorema Rege &amp; ab omni parochia electum Archiepiscopum, consecrauerunt. Hac dignitate ei a a Germano &amp; Lupo data; constituerunt ei Episcopalem sedem concessu Mourici Regis, Principum, cleri &amp; populi, apud podium Lantaui in honore S. Petri Apostoli fundatans &amp; cum funbus istis &amp;c. To confute the Pelagian heresie, Saint German a Bishop and one Lupus, were sent into Brittane by the prelates of France, when as many times before the Brittanes had sent their messengers to craue aid against so execrable a danger; because neither they could like of the naughty doctrine of the heretiques, nor yet were able to ouerthrow the same. After the saide elders had rooted out the Pelagian heresie, they consecrased Bishops in many places of Brittane. Ouer all the Brittanes dwelling on the right side of Brittaine, they consecrated for Archbishops S. Dubritius, who was chosen for the supreame Doctor, by the King and all the Diocesse. This dignity beeing bestowed vpon him by Germanus and Lupus, they, with the consent of Mouric the King, the Nobility, Clergy and people, appointed his see to be at the manner of Lantaui, and founded the same there, to the

honour of S. Peter, bounding the territories thereof in this wise. &amp;c. This was about the yeare of Christ 430. about which time also (or somewhat later) Palladius (who is falsly said to haue béen the first Preacher vnto the Scottish nation) did first appoint Bishops and ordaine Bishopricks in Scotland,
                     Rer. Scotic. l. 5 Reg. 42. as Buchanan hath deliuered.
               Upon these testimonies, I reason thus; If before these times we had so many Bishops, Bishoprickes, and Archbishoprickes, how commeth it to passe, that in no monument whatsoeuer, we finde any name or mention of any Bishop of this land, sauing some few that (as we say) had their sée at London? and if so many sees had been furnished before, what occasion had Germanus and Lupus to consecrate so many Bishops as in the report of the history of Landaff before mentioned is related.

                  But there is nothing more absurd in this history, then the imagination of fitting the sees of Bishops and Archbishops according to the place and number of the Flamines forsooth, and Archflamines of the Pagans. A deuise so childish and ridiculous as I cannot but wonder that any man of learning and iudgment should approoue it: and yet I perceiue not any that haue gaine-saide it, before Master Doctor Su

               Of this number I account especially two, The one is Fenestella; whose testimony were very ancient, if hee were that historiographer whom Pliny 
                  
                     De sac. Rom. cap. 5. so often mentioneth. But hee died (as the said Pliny witnesseth Nat. hist. lib. 33. c. 11.) in the last yeare of Tiberius the Emperour: so that it could not be hee that writ the booke now extant De Magistratibus sacerdotijs

                     estes sunt. It is sufficiently to bo proued (saith he) that as amongst vs there is difference betwéen the degrées of our Priests, as Bishops, Archbishops, Cardinals, Patriarchs and Metropolitans; so, likewise there was difference betweene the Flamines, Protoflamines, &amp; Archflamines of the

Gentils. But al men know, yt it was many a yéer after the death of Tiberius, before diuers of these titles were heard of amongest Christians. By which, as also, for that hee citeth in diuers places A. Gellius, who liued a hundred yeares after the death of Tiberius; it is manifest, that hee is some later counterfeit that is author of the Fenestella that we haue.
               But to say no more of the man, his opinion (whatsoeuer hée were) is manifestly false. No man I dare affirm is able to shew out of any ancient writer or other authentical monument, yt euer there was any such office amongst the Gentiles as Archiflamen or Protoflamen. Look who list in that volume of ancient inscriptions published of late by Gruterus. Scaliger and other: He may there finde oftentimes mentioned Flamen for a man, and Flaminica for a woman Priest; but of Archflamen, Protoflamen or any other like, altum silentium.
               
               Now, to leaue Fenestella; the other defender of this conceit, is Gratian, whom I do

               For beside (as before I haue alleaged) not so much as the name of Archflamen or Protoflamen is to be foūd in any author or monument of credit before his time; it is manifest, that diuers cities had many Colledges of Priests &amp; consequently many Flamens.

               Yea it séemeth also (to note by the way) that another Temple was then likewise built vnto all the Empresses consecrated after their death. For amongst a number of ancient inscriptions to be seene in the booke before mentioned, (where we find memoriall of diuers women, priests of seuerall wiues, daughters, and sisters of Emperours, whom before that time these God-makers had registred amongst the numbers of their Goddesses,) there is one, wherin one Vsia is termed a Priest, diuarum (and I suppose it is to be vnderstood Augustarum) the copy wheof is as followeth.

               Upon this occasion it came to passe, that there was no place of any reckoning in the Romane Empire which was vnfurnished of his temple dedicate to the city of Rome and diuis Augg. which must haue their colledge of Priests and so their Flamine; as by the great number of olde inscriptions daily to be séene, and witnessing the same, it may appeare. And then lightly they had also their temple for some one of the Emperours or other, as Camalodunum had of Claudius, which in like sort had as the other, their Flamine &amp;c.
                     Tacit. Annal. 14. Now whereas the same cities they had also temples built before vnto other gods; Carleon for example had one of Diana, London another of Diana likewise, which by testimony of authenticall monuments is cléerely to be proued: so that one and the same city had for the most part many Flamines, and namely Rome not so few I wéene as 100. how is it possible I pray you, that there should be any manner of proportion at all betwéene our Bishops and their Flamines; they hauing diuers Flamines to almost euery towne, and wee one Bishop not so much as for euery whole shire? and so much for that matter.
               It is time for me now to say somewhat of a certaine Epistle written (as we finde deliuered) by Eleutherius Bishop of Rome vnto King Lucius. The copy of which Epistle was first found (for ought I can discerne) in an old Chronicle entituled Brut

So that, the cause of reformation in both kindes being one and the selfe same, I sée no reason why we should not thinke, that the remedy of both was likewise sought at once. And true it is, that the authour of the booke called Antiquitates Britannicae, affirmeth, how that Eluan and Medwin made the foresayd motion for the Roman lawes at their being with Eleutherius before the baptisme of Lucius and then receiued answer. So doth Mr. Fox: And the reuerend father of happy memory Bishop Iewell séemeth to be of the same opinion. Yet because the authours of our great Chronicle (Holinshead and the rest) deliuer, not only yt this motion was made after the Baptisme of Lucius; but also

A King hath his name of ruling and not of hauing a realme. You shall bee a King while you rule well; but if you doe otherwise, the name of a King shall not remaine with you, and you shall loose it, which God forbid. The almighty God grant you so to rule the realme of Brittane, that you may raigne with him for euer whose Vicar you be in the Realme.

               The time was, when the noble and victorious King, Henry the second submitted himselfe vnto the correction of the monkes of Canterburis;

               Well, whatsoeuer be the opinion of N. D. the conuersioner in this case, or of his Masters at Rome, that will needs be the successor of Eleutherius; wee will say with Eleutherius (that which in déedes as well as in wordes they denye, howsoeuer they cloake it) how that our Princes in their seuerall dominions, they are the Vicars &amp; Lieutenants immediate of God, subiect vnto none other but God himselfe; &amp; that therefore if ought be amisse in them, we ought to vse no other weapons in dealing with them but our tongues, namely and especially in praying for them, saying with an ancient Father, arma Christianorum

               Now to procéede in our story, it is recorded by most of our writers (in a manner all) that King Lucius hauing founded many Churches, and afforded vnto them many possessions, with great priuiledges; be at the last departed this life in peace and was buried at Glocester, the 14. yeare after his Baptism as some say; the tenth as other, and againe (as some other will haue it) the fourth. Whereby it may appeare, how greatly they are deceiued that affirme,
                     R. Vitus.
                   how King Lucius after a certaine space forsaking his kingdome, became a Cleargy man, and preaching the Gospell in diuers countries of France and Germany, suffred martyrdome at last at a place called Curiac.
               
               When and wheresoeuer he died, great cause haue we with al thankfulnes to celebrate the memory of this excellēt Prince: by whom God did not onely bl
                     •
                  sse this land with the knowledge of his truth, but in such sort did it, as thereby hee hath purchased vnto the same the title of primogenita Ecclesia the most auncient and first-begotten of all the Churches in the world,
                     Sabellic: Enn: 7. lib: 5. for that (as Sabellicus hath well noted) although Christ was preached elsewhere priuately in many other nations long before; yet, omnium proninciarum prima Britannia, publicitus Christi nomen recepit; Of all nations it was the first that with publique approbation of Prince and state receiued the profession of Christian Religion; which also it retained in great sincerity, for the space of 100. yeares, to witte, vntill the time of Dioclesian that cruell persecutour, who began his raigne the yeare 288.
               Now by yt which hath béene before deliuered,
                     Brittane hitherto no way obliged to the Sec of Rome.
                   it may sufficiently appeare vnto the indifferent reader, how little our country of Brittane hath béene hitherto beholding vnto the sée of Rome. For whether it were Simon Zelotes, or S. Paul, that brought hither ye first light of the Gospell; yea were it S. Peter (which could not possibly be, as before hath béene shewn and proued) In as much as they were all Apostles, who at once receiued their commission of him vnto whom was giuen all power both in heauen and in earth,
                     Mat. 28.19. in these wordes, Goe

                  n of the Romanes (for as S. Paul witnesseth, hee was appointed the Apostle of the circumcision) I sée not how wee are any thing at all obliged vnto the sée of Rome,
                     Gal. 27. &amp;. 9. or vnto any Bishop of the same for any thing by them done amongst vs.
               As for Ioseph of Arimathea, for whose historie the testimonies are so pregnant as no man mee thinkes heereafter should greatly doubt of the same, it appeareth not that euer he was at Rome in his life; nay rather the contrary appeareth, &amp; that hée receiued directions for his preaching and discipline; either in the councell of the Apostles gathered at Ierusalem, or else of Saint Philip the Apostle in France.
               
               Concerning King Lucius, I discerne not but the Sée of Rome is more beholding vnto vs than we vnto it. Here hee was conuerted in his owne Country: but he was contented, peraduenture (for it is questionable) to affoorde vnto the Bishoppe of Rome, the honour of baptizing of him and his company. For there is no doubt to be made, that at their handes (if he were not) hee might haue béen baptized, that were the instruments of his conuersion. But what shall I say? humanitus aliquid passus est: Hée tho

                  ght happily it would be some little glory vnto him, and a countenance also to the action, to fetch them that might séeme to bee the authors of his designe from Rome, the seat

                   yea and also happily, the vpholders of his Crowne and authority regall. The men that were sent from Rome, were vtterly ignorant of the British language, and so could not possibly preach any thing themselues, but were faine to commit that office altogether vnto other, to wit, especially, to Eluan &amp; Medwin. And what is all this to the Sée of Rome? Surely, hitherunto we sée little cause to acknowledge ourselues any thing at all obliged therunto. The Story following will yéeld some better colour of these néedles exprobrations; wherein notwithstanding, the truth by Gods grace shall plainely and ingenuously be acknowledged.

                  Beda and other that succéeded him haue affoorded vs much more light, which I shall gladly make vse of. Now therefore to procéed, you shall vnderstand that amongest diuers terrible persecutions wherewith our Churches heere in Brittane were shaken at sundry times vnder Dioclesian and other tyrants; the most gréeuous of all others was that of the Saxons, who being Pagans and worshippers of Idoles, expelled, not onely Christian religion, but the followers also of the same into a corner of this Island, to wit, Wales &amp; Cornewall, whereby it came to passe, that all the rest of our England was quite ouerwhelmed with the waues of Paganisme and Idolatry. True it is yt many of the Brittanes remained here after the conquest of the Saxons: William of Malmsbury testifieth the same:
                     De Regib. l. 1. Of some hee saith, In eius verba volentes concessere, speaking of Cerdic King of the West Saxons, they were content to submit themselues vnto him. And againe of other reliquos in sidem acceptos, placidae quietis gratia mulcebant: hauing receiued their submission for peace and quietnes sake, they made much of them.
               But these wee are to presume were of the basest of the people, and so kept vnder by perpetuall seruitude, as it was impossible for them to maintaine any exercise of religion in anie

publicke manner. Yet priuately no doubt, many of them, they not onely in secret serued God, and kept a good conscience, but vsed their talent in seeking to draw some of the Saxons vnto the faith of Christ. This partly appeareth in Offa that (as Munster reporteth) being an English-man and of the bloud royall (it seemeth hee was sonne vnto Athelfride King of the Bernicians) was a very good Christian,
                     Munster in Cosmogr.
                   trauelled into Germanie, and there the yeare 601. layed the first foundation of the monastery of Schuttern.
               
               It is manifest also by the letters of S. Gregorie vnto the King and Queene of France, that there were many amongst the Saxons well inclined in religion, that complained of the negligence of the Frenchmen their neighbours, in affoording them instructers and teachers, which it séemeth they greatlie desired.
                     Greg. in Regist. c. 158. ad Theodoricū &amp; Theodebertum Reges
                   For thus he writeth to the King; Peruenit ad nos, &amp;c. Wee are informed, that the English nation by the mercie of GOD is become desirous to bee conuerted vnto the faith of Christ; but that the Priests of your neighbourhood do neglect to satisfie their desire, or so much as to increase the same by any good exhortations.

                   Againe to the Queene thus, Indicamus, &amp;c. We certifie you, that the English nation (God permitting it) is willing to become Christian; but that the Clergy of their neighbourhood, extend not their pastorall care vnto them. But this negligence of theirs, it pleased God at last in his good time to s

                  pply, by the meanes and occasion that now I shall declare vnto you; and to replant againe Christian Religion in this Realme, where heeretofore, vntill the comming of the Saxons, it had so many yeares flourished.
               
                  
                     Io. Diac. in vita S. Greg. lib. 1. cap. 21.It chanced vpon a time, S. Gregory (beeing then a priuate man) to espye certaine beautifull children to bee sould in the stréetes of Rome; and vnderstanding they were Pagans, asked of what country they were? it was answered, they were Angles or Englishmen. Well may they bee called Angles (quoth hee) for they looke like Angels. Demaunding then of what Prouince they were; it was saide they were of Deira: God grant (saith hee) they may be De ira Dei eruti, deliuered from the wrath of God and made partakers of his mercies by Christ. He procéeded yet further, and asked how the King of

that Co
                     •
                  ntry was called; Understanding his name was Aella, Alleluia (quoth he) must needes be sung in those partes in prayse of the true God. Hereupon hee went presently vnto Pelagius the second, that was then Bishoppe of Rome, desiring him to send Preachers into Brittaine, offering himselfe to be one; and obtaining his request, tooke his iourney toward England. He was scarsely thrée dayes iourney on his way, when at the importunity of the Romanes (who would not endure the losse of so worthy a man) hee was called backe.
               Not long after it fell out, that Pelagius dying, this good man, Gregory, was chosen Bishop of Rome in his place. He mindfull then of his former enterprise, presently tooke order for the sending of Preachers into this land, for the conuersion of the same; and the sooner, for that (as before I said) the dayly complaints of certaine good Saxons, concerning the carelesnesse of the French Clergy in that behalfe, did greatly prouoke him thereunto. The man that he made choice of for performance of this great work, was one Augustine a Monke of greater vertue than learning; although as a mortall man he was not without his vices, and namely, such, as the now aspiring Sée of Rome (from whence he came) was likely to infuse into him, as anon (by Gods grace) shall further bee declared. Unto him were adioyned for assistants 40. other, that should accompany him in this voyage, and helpe him in the worke he was appointed vnto. They, being now well onward on their way, enquired of the State of the Country, and manner of the people vnto whom they went; and vnderstood so much of their barbarous and fierce rudenesse, as they in a manner, all vtterly renounced procéeding any further in the voyage, and as it were compelled Augustine to poste backe to Rome, there to craue licence of returne.
               Saint Gregory much grieued with this message, writ his letters vnto them, vsing many reasons to perswade them, in any wise to goe forward; whereunto at last they yéelded. Hée writ also vnto the Kng and Quéene of France, and to diuers Bishoppes, to shew vnto them what kindnesse they might in their passage; which thing they did abundantly, not onely in welcome and entertainment, but also in adioyning vnto their

company diuers French men to be their interpreters; whereby it séemeth, the French tong, and the English at that time were much alike; as well they might bee, the Franks and Saxons, being both, people of Germany, and hauing seated themselues much about one time; the one in France some 130 yeare, the other in Britaine, 150. yéeres then past.
               
                  Augustine and his associates landed in the Isle of Thanet the yéere 596. (as most affirme, but as some account 597.) which was the yeare (as histories deliuer) in which Mahomet was borne.
                     Florant. Wigorne.
                   There raigned at that time in Kent Ethelbert, the fifth King of the Saxon race; whose dominions, though he bare the title of Kent onely, were extended Northward as farre as the riuer of Humber. He had vnto his wife at that time, a daughter of Clotharius the first of that name, King of France, named Berta; who being a Christian, and born of Christian parents, was permitted by her husband, the exercise of her Religion, and had attending vpon her for her Chaplaine, one Luidhard a Bishop with diuers other Christian seruants; And there was allowed vnto them a certain Church built heretofore by the Romanes, dedicate vnto S. Martin, and standing néere the walles of the City of Canterbury, where they vsed to pray, preach, and administer the Sacraments; whereby (no doubt) many of the Saxons were dayly wonne vnto Christ, and Ethelbert the King well prepared to entertaine the motion which Augustine and his Assistants made afterwards vnto him. In regard thereof, Capgraue saith,
                     In vita Aug.
                   that the saide Luidhardus was praecursor &amp; ianitor venturie Augustini, the forerunner &amp; porter to giue Augustine entrance when he should come: and againe, that, parauit ei viam &amp; ingressum, he prepared him a way and entrance. And surely so it may well séeme by his first welcome and entertainement.
               When Augustine vpon his arriuall sent to the King to let him vnderstand that he was come from Rome, and that hée &amp; his company had brought with them such doctrine as should bring him and his (if they receyued the same) to enioy euerlasting happinesse in heauen after this life past: he presentlie commanded that they should be well entertained, and all necessaries

prouided for them, &amp; wished them to attend a while; saying
                     •
                   that euen shortly they should haue audience.
               It was not long after, before the King came himselfe in person into the saide Isle; where hee tooke order, these men should be brought before him, not into any house, but (forsooth) to preuent sorcery, in a place appointed for that purpose, in the open fields. So thither they came, in an equipage somewhat strange; one carrying aloft a Crosse of siluer before them, another hauing a Table containing the picture of our Sauiour, and all singing of the Letanie.
               Being come, they were all willed, first to sit downe, and then to declare their errand: which being deliuered, they receiued of the king this gentle and courteous answere; that their pains in comming so far to séeke his good, hee tooke in very good part, although he could not without note of leuity and rashnes, sodainely forsake the religion left vnto him by his ancesters, to receiue an vncertains nouelty. He therefore would be so far from giuing them cause of griefe or discontentment, as that they should not onely finde kinde entertainement at his hands, but haue all ample liberty and licence to preach &amp; teach the doctrine they had so greatly commended.

                   appointed them a dwelling in the City of Canterbury, where by their preaching (as well in deedes, and good example of life as of words) the same being confirmed by certaine miracles, (as Beda reporteth), they wonne dayly many vnto Christ, and in the end amongst other, the King himselfe, who thereupon gaue them a faire house at Stablegate within the City aforesaide, and assigned a liberall portion of possessions for maintenance of them in the same.
               The matter being thus farre forward, Augustine thought good to steppe into France, where he caused himselfe to be consecrated a Bishoppe, of Etherius Archbishop of Arles, by the name of Episcopus Anglorum.
               
               This narration is taken in a manner altogether out of Beda. And whosoeuer shall duely consider of the same,

                   by Augustine would haue brought forth any great haruest, himselfe being a man very vnlearned (as his simple questions proposed vnto Saint Gregory 
                  
                     Beda lib. 1. cap. 28. doe sufficiently shew) and the rest of his company (wee may presume) much more ignorant.
               Yet we will not greatly grudge him the name of Apostolus Anglorum, the Apostle of Englishmen, so it bée but rightly vnderstoode. For we deny not but he was sent, marry by whome by Gregory, that had no more authority here then himselfe; &amp; therefore he was not able to say as Saint Paul the Apostle,

We deny not but he was sent hither to preach vnto the nation of the English; but a great (I thinke we may say far the greatest) part of England, remained in the darkenesse of their infidelity, many yéeres after he was dead. For by 
                     Beda lib. 2. c. 9. &amp; 4. c. 13. lib. 2. c. 15. 
                  Paulinus the Gospell was first preached in the North of England, anno, 625. by Wilfride in the South, 681. by Foelix in Norfolke and those parts, 630. and so by other elsewhere at other times. We deny not but he was sent to preach Christ and his Religion: but it is manifest, he preached also himself; like a curst cow throwing downe with his heele, much of the good milke that before he had giuen, as anon we shall haue occasion to shew.
               Presently vpon the returne of Augustine out of France, two of his company (Lawrence and Peter) were sent vnto Rome, to aduertise Gregory of their good successe, by whom, at their comming backe, he sent vnto Augustine an Archiepiscopall Pall, certaine bookes, Church ornaments, and other necessaries. He sent also by them presents vnto the King, &amp; writ diuers letters, some gratulatory to the King, some vnto Augustine, exhorting him to diligence in his calling, and to

take héede, lest the miracles which for the conuersion of this people, God wrought by him (diuers it is said hée wrought) should lift him vp into a proud and high conceit of his owne worth: and lastly, others vnto the Archbishoppe of Arles, to thanke him for his good aide and assistance yeelded to these men in this businesse.
               
                  Augustine in the meane time had obtained of the King an other Church in the middest of the City, built likewise heretofore by the Romanes, and dedicated the same vnto our Sauiour Christ. Soone after, this good King gaue vnto him also his owne Pallace, and chiefe seat of his kingdome, remouing himselfe vnto Rheaculfe
                  
                     •
                   called by the Romanes Regulbium, now Reculuer: And lastly, he laied the foundation of a goodly Monastery which he dedicated to Saint Peter and S. Paul, knowne afterwardes by the name of S. Augustines.
               
               These things being thus ordered, hee made shew of endeuouring a concord and agréement betwéene the Saxons &amp; the Britons; but his intent was, to establish his owne throne, and to inlarge the bounds of his Prouince, by bringing Wales vnder his iurisdiction, wheras they had an Archbishop of their owne, and might not in policy submit themselues to him, that was to liue a subiect to a forraine Prince, more likely to bée a foe th
                     •
                  n a friend.
               Yet thus,
                     Beda lib. 2. c. 2 and in this sort he deals with them. Hee procured by the meanes of king Ethelbert, a certaine méeting of diuers British Bishops, &amp; other the principal of their Clergy, at a certain place called afterward vpō that occasion, Augustines oake, being in Wiccia or Worcestershire, vpon the confines of the Country of the West Saxons. There by perswasions, intreaties, threates, and all manner of meanes he endeuoured to draw them to an entire conformity with the Church of Rome, that had then admitted diuers corruptions, and much fallen from the purity of former times, whereas the Britons had continued still in the same tenor of pure 
                     Grex Domini rectum ordinem tenebat Galfr. Menum. l. 11. cap. 12. doctrine which they had receyued in the first infancy of the Church. But his answere was short and peremptory, that they might not submit themselues vnto him, hauing an Archbishop of their own; that the doctrine and discipline of their Church they had receiued

from the Apostles of Christ, neyther would they change the same for any mans pleasure whatsoeuer.
               
                  Augustine notwithstanding not discouraged with this repulse, procured yet another meeting, to which many more of the Brittaines repayred then vnto the first: For it was saide there were there 7. Bishoppes, to wit, of Hereford, of Landaffe, of Paterne, of Bangor, of Saint A
                        ••
                     aph, of the VViccians, and of Morgan. There were there also many other Clergy men, and Monkes, especially out of that famous Monastery of Bannachor néere Chester, in which there liued at that time aboue 2000. Monkes, whose Abbot or gouernour Dinot was there present at this conuenticle.
               Some time before this assembly, certaine of the Brittanes thought good to aske counsell of a certaine Anchorite whom they estéemed greatly of for his holinesse, and to know of him whether hee thought it best for them to yéeld vnto the directions of Augustine or no. He aduised them, if hee were a man of God, to take the course hee shewed, and to follow the same. And when they asked how they should discerne whether hée were such a one or no; hee pronounced this saying of our Sauiour, Take my yoke vpon you, and learne of mee; for I am meeke and humble of heart:
                  
                     Matth. 11.29. If therefore (saith he) this same Augustine bee a méeke and humble minded man
                     •
                   it is a great presumption that he beareth the yoke of Christ and offreth the same vnto you: But if he be stout and proud, he is not of God you may be bold. This therefore (quoth he) is my aduice, haue a care that he and his company be first in the place where you méete: If then you being the greater number, he rise not to do you reuerence, but despise you; despise you also him and his counsell.
               
                  Augustine therefore first entred the place, with his banner and his crosse, with singing, procession, and great pompe; and when the Brittane Bishops came in, neuer mooued to rise or saluted them at all. This they taking very ill, gainsaid him in euery thing, exhorting one another not to yeeld a iote vnto him by any means.
                     Beda vbis.
                   For say they, si modo nobis assargere noluit; quanto magis si eisubdi c

much more when we haue once submitted ourselues to his iurisdiction, will he despise vs, and set vs at nought?
               
               With this repulse Austin was so much moued, as he could not forbeare immediately to breath out threats against the poore Brittanes, telling them that they which refused to bée at peace with their friends, should shortly find war and enemies; and that they should finde temporall death by the swords of them, at whose hands they would not receiue the offer of euerlasting life.
               How well he seconded these words by déedes, let it appeare by the words of Thomas Gray that writ a Chronicle in french now well néere 300. yeares since. Aust

               An other olde Chronicle reporteth, that Ethelbert béeing incensed as aforesaid by Augustine, he sent to Elfred king of Northumberland to come and helpe him to distresse the Britons of Wales; that Augustine the Archbishop of Canterburie met them at

                     ail, who being afraid of the other two Kinges, fled away and left his Country, which they parted betweene them. Afterward (saith hée) they went towards Wales, which the Britons heting of, sent men to them in their shirts &amp; barefoot to aske mercy; but they were so cruell, they had of them no pitty at all. Whereby it appeareth, that the said Austin was not onely author and perswader of this slaughter, but also present, and an actor in the same, which our conuersioner cannot endure by any meanes to heare of.
               Well I know, that diuers affirme, Austin died the yeare 603. whereas this warre was made two yéers after that time.
                     Lib. 2. c. 2. in fine cap.
                   And Beda (as now we haue him) séemeth to confirm the same. For talking of the foresaid slaughter, and how it was foretold by Augustine (as before I haue declared) he addeth, quamuis ipso (Augustino) iam multo ante tempore ad coelestia regna translato, as though long before that warre, Austin had died. Howbeit

it appeareth manifestly, that those words are fraudulently thrust in. For the olde Saxon copies (whereof diuers are to bee séene) haue no such thing. Againe, it appeareth that Augustine was aliue, and confirmed a Charter made by King Ethelbert, the yéere, 605. which was two yéeres after the warre. And diuers do witnesse he died after that, some the yéere 611. and other (as namely Mat

               Whensoeuer it was, a great ouerthrow they receiued vpon this occasion, wherein they lost, beside an infinite number of Souldiers &amp; men of Arms, a great many Monks (no lesse then 1200.) that neuer fought against the enemy at all, but onely by prayer:

               This action vndoubtedly sauoureth strongly of that ambitious humour, wherewith Rome hath euer béene déeply tainted, and that now waxing weake, and lesse hopefull in the temporall state, began to creepe into the Spiritualty. Gregory an humble &amp; vertuous man, suppressed the same in himselfe and other what he might; and the rather happily, because the title of supremacy which afterwards his Successors arrogated to themselues, was vsurped by the Patriarkes of Constantinople; against which, how bitterly Gregory inneigheth, it shall not be amisse a little to consider; that it may appeare vnto the Reader, how true it is which the conuersioner and his fellowes stand so confidently vpon, that Saint Gregory, and so his Disciple Augustine our Apostle (as they call him) was iust of the same Religion that now is maintayned, in Rome.

               This Augustine was a man of excéeding tall stature, well fauoured, of a very amiable countenance. His body was buried first without doores, néere to the Church of his Monastery, because the Church was not yet finished, but afterwards was remoued into the North porch of the said Church, in which place all the bodies of the Archbishops following were laid vntill Theodor, who was first buried in the Church, because the porch was full.

                  Thus much concerning the first conuersion of this Country to Christian Religion, and Augustine the first Archbishop of the Metropolitan See of Canterbury.
               
            
         
         
            
            THE ARCHBISHOPS OF CANTERBVRIE.
            
               1. Augustine.
               
                  BY that which hath béene before deliuered, it appeareth, that Augustine was the first Archbishoppe of Canterbury,
                  596. concerning whom I neede not any further to discourse.
            
            
               2. Laurence.
               SAint Augustine before his death had appointed to succéede him,611. one Laurence a Romane borne, a very godly and well learned man, whom Ciaconius in the life of Saint Gregory, séemeth to make a Priest, Cardinall in titulo S. Siluestri in Exquilijs, tt: Equirij Archipresbyter. But the name of Cardinall God wot is of a far later date. This Laurence tooke great paines not onely with his owne charge, but also in labouring to reduce the Britons of Wales, the Scots &amp; Irishmen to o

                  e consent in matters of religion. It is likely his diligence might haue done good, but that he was disturbed by the death of that good King Ethelbert. Eadbald his sonne succéeded him in the Kingdom, who being a vitions young man, was not ashamed to marry the wife of his late deceased father. This and other

enormities, when Lawrence like a good Iohn Baptist, doubted not to

                  eprehend him for, he first began to fall out with him, and afterwards, euen with Christian Religion; which a while hee seemed to like of well enough, but now at last vtterly renounced. The people (as commonly it commeth to passe) fol
                  
                     •
                  owing the example of their King, they likewise returned to the filthy vomit of their abominable idolatry; although the Archbishoppe like a good Pastor ceased not by earnest exhortations and what other meanes possibly he might, to stay them from this horrible relapse. Perceiuing at last that his wordes did no good, but rather incited the King to a more desperate hatred of him and religion: He determined to follow Mellitus and Iustus into France, that (as anon you shall haue occasion to reade) were lately banished by the wicked sons of good Sebert King of the East Saxons. Tho night before the day of his intended departure, hee caused his bed to be made in the very Church of his Monastery; where after many teares and sighes, he recommended vnto God the miserable state of his poore Church, and so fell a sléepe. It séemed vnto him (saith Beda) that S. Peter came vnto him and first expostulated the matter with him, after chid and reprehended him sharpely for purposing to forsake the Church committed vnto him; and lastly, whipped his naked body so terribly, as when hee waked, finding it more then a dreame, all his body was gore-blood. Hee went immediately vnto the King; shewing him his wounds, and together related vnto him the occasion of them. This strooke such a terror into the King, as by and by hée renounced his idols, put away his incestuous wife, caused himselfe to be baptized, aud for a farther testimony and assurance of his vnfained conuersion, builded a Church in the monastery of S. Peter, and dedicated the same vnto the blessed virgine. Laurence very ioyfull of this alteration, sent presently for Mellitus and Iustus into France; who comming vnto him, one of them (Iustus) Bishop of Rochester, hee returned vnto his old charge
                     •
                   the other he retained with him, hoping to finde meanes, hee also might be restored to his Sée againe. In the mean time, euen the same yéere that King Eadbalde became a Christian, himself (I mean Laurence) died, to wit, Feb. 3. 619 (as Bale deliuereth) and was buried beside Augustine his predecessor.
            
            
               
               3. Mellitus.
               AT what time the Britaines refused to ioyne with Augustine in preaching of Christ,619. he writ vnto Saint Gregory, certifying him, that the haruest here was great, but the labourers very few; and therefore requested him to appoint some that might assist him in this worke of the Lord. He did so; and sent vnto him Mellitus an Abbot of Rome, Iustus, Paulinus, Rufinianus and others, who arriued in England the yéere 601. To leaue the rest vnto their owne places, Mellitus about thrée yéeres after was consecrate by him Bishop of London, where King Ethelbert built a goodly church and dedicated the same vnto S. Paul. The fourth yéere of his consecration he went to Rome to confer with Boniface the Pope about diuers things, and was by him honourably intertained. A yéere or two after his returne died both Ethelbert King of Kent, and Sebert (that vnder him ruled the East Saxons) vnto whose iurisdiction London appertained. This Sebert left behinde him thrée wicked sonnes, that being neuer baptized, came notwithstanding one day vnto the Church at Communion time, and asked the Bishoppe what he meant that he deliuered not of that same fine bread vnto them as hée was wont to doe vnto their father Saba, and did yet vnto the rest of the people. He answered, that if they would be washed in the water of life as he was and the rest of the people there present; then would he deliuer vnto them of this bread also, but otherwise, neither was it lawfull for him to deliuer, nor them to receiue it. This notwithstanding they would haue enforced him; and when they could not preuaile, were so enraged, as they expelled him their dominion, hardly holding their hands from doing him violence at that time. He béeing thus exiled, went first vnto Laurence the Archbishop of Canterbury, and finding him in little better case than himselfe was at London, departed into France together with Iustus Bishoppe of Rochester. Being sent for soone after by Laurence (as aboue said) it happened the same yéere that the saide Laurence died, and he was appointed to succéede him. Hee was a man of great birth, but of greater mind, excéeding carefull of

his charge, despising the world, and neuer caring for any thing but heauen and heauenly things. Hauing béene sicke a long time, he died at last of the gowt, Apr. 24. ann. 624. &amp; was buried beside his predecessor.
            
            
               4. Iustus.
               
                  624.
                  IVstus (of whom I haue before spoken somewhat) was taken from Rochester to supply the place of Mellitus after his decease; wherein hauing trauelled painfully the space of 10. yéeres, (Malmsbury saith but 3.) he departed this life, Neuemb. 10. anno 634. and was buried in the porch aboue mentioned.
            
            
               5. Honorius.
               
                  634.After the death of Iustus, Honorius was made Archbishop, a very reuerend man: He was a Roman born, very learned, and sometimes a Disciple of Saint Gregory. He was consecrate at Lincolne by Paulinus Archbishoppe of Yorke. He receiued a Pall from Rome with letters, wherein authority was giuen to him and the other Archbishop, whensoeuer either of them did fail, to consecrate another in his place without posting to Rome. This man appointed diuers Bishops to diuers Countries, as in their seuerall places God willing shall be more at large declared: He also diuided his prouince into parishes, that so he might appoint particular Ministers to particular congregations; and hauing sate Archbishoppe almost 20. yéeres (W. Malmsbury saith 26) died the last day of February; or (as some deliuer) of September, the yéere, 653. He was buried amongst his predecessors.
            
            
               6. Deus-dedit, or Adeodatus.
               
                  655,THe Sée was void after Honorius died the space of 18. moneths. An Englishman or Saxon called sometimes Frithona (famous for his learning and other vertues) was then elected Archbishop, and after that named Deus dedit. He was consecrate by Ithamar Bishoppe of Rochester, (Yorke

being then without an Archbishoppe:) and died the last day of Iune (or as Westminster hath) Iuly 14. 664. hauing attended that charge carefully about the space of 6. yéeres, the very same day (saith H. Huntington) that Ercombert the King of Kent dyed. He was the first Englishman that was Archbishop, and the last Archbishop that was buried in the Church porch of Saint Augustines.
               
            
            
               7. Theodorus.
               ONe Wigardus an Englishman,668. an ancient and learned Priest, was chosen to succéede Deus-dedit, and sent to Rome for consecration with letters commendatorie from Egebert King of Kent, and Oswy King of Northumberland, who also sent presents of great value vnto Vitalianus that was then Pope. It chanced hée came to Rome at a time when the plague was very hote there; &amp; died of the same, as did also almost al his company that came with him. The Pope vnderstanding the Sée had stood long voide, and carefull to sée it furnished, made choice of one Adrian an Abbot of Italy, but borne in Africke, a graue man and very learned. Hee would not bée perswaded to take so great a charge vpon him; but being importuned thereunto, hée promised to finde out a man that should bée of greater both learning and yeeres then himselfe, and in all other respects very fitte for the place. Hée was familiarly acquainted with one Theodore a Grecian borne in Tharsus of Cilicia, Saint Paules country; a man well séen in all kinde of good learning, and 66. yéeres of age. Vitalianus notwithstanding refused to allow of him, except the other would promise to goe into England with him also. Hée was content, 
                     〈◊〉
                   and at his comming thither was made Abbot of S. Augustines. Theodore then was consecrate Archbishop, April 1. 668. when the Sée had béene voide almost fowre yéeres. In May following, they set forward towards England. They had many lets by the way, and got not thither in a yéere and a halfe. They brought with them great store of bookes both Gréeke and Latine, whereof some remaine yet to bée séene at this day, as namely a Homer (so faire and exquisitely written, as no print in the

world yet extant is thought to bée comparable to it eyther for truth or beauty) and diuers other. Unto this man all the British Bishoppes and generally all Britaine yéelded obedience, and vnder him conformed themselues in all things vnto the rites and discipline of the Church of Rome. Hée was a very stout and rigorous man, exercising the authority of his place so peremptorily, as many thinke it a great blot vnto him. How hee tooke vpon him to place and displace diuers Bishops at his pleasure, as Wilfride, Cedda and other, sée in the beginning of Yorke. In his time were held two Synods, one at Hereford (the Canons whereof you may sée in Beda, lib. 4 cap. 5.) the other at Clyff beside Rochester, in which hée procured all the Prelates there assembled to set downe their opinions touching the heresie of Eunches, wherewith his countrimen the Grecians were much infected: They all detested it, and gaue their approbation of those fiue famous generall Councels, of Nice, of Ephesus, of Chalcedon, and the two first of Constantinople. Neuer before this time had England so happy dayes, nor so many learned men as vnder him, and a little after. Amongst a great number of other, these were of his bréeding, Beda, Saint Iohn of Beuerley, Alcu
                        •
                     nus, and Tobias Bishop of Rochester, all excellent and very famous men. He erected (as some say) a kinde of schoole or Uniuersity at Créekelade, or rather Gréekeslade in Wiltshire, so called of the Grecians that taught and studied there. These men soone after remoouing thence, are supposed to haue laide the foundations of our Uniuersity of Oxford. Hée left sundry monuments of his learning in writing behinde him, and appointed many Bishoppes in diuers parts of this land. Hauing continued Archbishop 22. yéeres, he died September 29. anno 690. being 88

                  res of age, vntill which time, hée would often say, he thought he should liue, for that in a dream it had beene so signified vnto him many yéeres before. A little before his death he sent for Wilfride Archbishop of Yorke, &amp; Erkenwald Bishoppe of London, and confessing himselfe vnto them; acknowledged that he had done Wilfride great wrong, insomuch as, there was no one thing that lay so hard vpon his conscience as that, and therefore with teares besought him to forgiue him, and to pray for him. He was buried within

the Church of Saint Augustines Abbey, because the porch was full before, all his predecessors (sixe in number) being buried there. In memory of them, were composed and engrauen in marble these verses that follow,

               8. Brithwald.
               ALmost two yéeres the See was voide after the death of Theodore;
                  692. 
                  Brithwald Abbot of Reculuer which standeth vpon the mouth of the riuer Gentad, and before that, a Monke of Glastenbury, was then elect, Iuly, 1. anno. 692. &amp; consecrate by Godwyn the Metropolitan of Wales, or of France rather as Beda reporteth. The yeer following, May 30. he tooke possession of this his Bishopricke. He was a man very well learned both in Diuinity and otherwise, but not comparable vnto Theodore his predecessor. Hee bare a hard hand vpon Wilfride Archbishop of Yorke, as Theodore had done before him, and caused his second banishment, or at least was some meanes of it. He was coniured by the Pope, who turned him about, and dealt so with him by letters, as he made him more earnest for him then euer he had beene against him. No Archbishop euer continued so long in this See as he, either before or since his time. He sate 38. yeares and a halfe. Dying then, Ianuary 9. 731. hee was buried at Saint Augustines with his Predecessors.
            
            
               9. Tatwyn.
               THe same yeare in which Birhtwald died, succeeded Tatwyn, otherwise called Cadwyn and Scadwyn,
                  732 being cons: Iune 10. following. He was borne in Mercia. A man very religious, and no lesse learned. Soon after his consecration there arose a great controuersie betweene him and the Archbishop of Yorke about the Primary. Wherein Tatwyn preuailed, hauing

trauelled to Rome in person and receiued his Pall there. He sute thrée yeeres, dyed Iuly, 30. 734. and was buried at Canterbery. Unto this mans time Beda (who died the same yeare) deduceth 
                     •
                  his history, the most ancient that England hath worthy any credite.
            
            
               10. Nothelmus.
               
                  736.
                  HEnry Huntingdon affirmeth one Egbright to haue succeeded Tatwyn: I haue not found him mentioned elsewhere: and therefore to follow the report of the greater number, I will omit him and passe vnto Nothelm. He was born at London.

                  Beda acknowledgeth himselfe much beholding to this man for diuers things which vpon his report he inserted into his Ecclesiasticall story. He receiued his Pall at Rome, anno 736. dyed October 17. 741. and was buried at Canterbury.
            
            
               11. Cuthbert or Cudbrict.
               
                  742.
                  CVthbert an Englishman of great parentage, being Bishop of Hereford, the yeare 742. was translated to Canterbury. Fiue yeares after, to wit, 747. by the counsell of Boniface Bishop of Mentz, he called a conuocation at Cliff beside Rochester, to reforme the manifold enormities wherewith the Church of England at that time was ouergrowne. Our Kinges forsaking the company of their own wiues, in those dayes delighted altogether in harlots, which were for the most part Nunnes. Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis. The rest of the Nobility therefore following their example, trode also the same trace. The Bishops likewise, and other of the Clergy that should haue béen a means of reforming these faults in others, were themselues no lesse faulty; spending their times eyther in contentions and brabbles, or else in luxurie and voluptuousnesse, hauing no care of study, and seldome, or neuer preaching. Whereby it came to passe that the whole land was ouerwhelmed with a most darke and palpable mist of ignorance, and polluted with all kinde of wickednesse and impietie in all sorts of people.

                  Cuthbert therfore endeuouring (like a good Pastor) by the reformation of these things to turne away the wrath of God which séemed to hang ouer this land, and to threaten those plagues which shortly after fell vpon it when the Danes inuaded the same: gathered together his Cleargy at the place before mentioned, and there after long consultation, caused certaine Canons to bee decréede which are to bée séene at large elsewhere. Amongest the rest, by one, all the Cleargy were required to read to their parishioners the Lords prayer and the Créede in the English tongue. This man obtained from the Pope a dispensation for making of cemiteries or Churchyards within townes and citties, whereas vntill his time, within the wals none were buried. He also procured Eadbert king of Kent to command, that the bodies of Archbishops deceased héereafter should not be buried at S. Augustines (as héeretofo
                     •
                  e) but at Christchurch: And that hee might put his monkes of Christ Church as it were in possession of this priuiledge; he took order his death should bée concealed vntill his funerals were ended. Hee died ann. 758. and was buried according to his owne desire in Christchurch, or (as one reporteth) in a little Church néere adioyning, which he had built and dedicated vnto Saint Iohn Baptist; meaning to settle his consistorie there, and to make it a place of buriall for himselfe and his successors. This Church many yéeres after was consumed with fire, together with Christchurch it selfe, and a great part of the monasterie. Christchurch was afterward re-edified by Lanfranke.
               
            
            
               12. Bregwyn.
               
                  BRegwyn was borne of

                   Noble parentage amongest the Saxons of Germany,759 whence hée trauelled into England for the 
                     •
                  ncrease of knowledge, beeing yet very yoong. After the death of Cuthbert, in regard of his modesty, integrity and great learning, choice was made of him as the fittest man to succéed, and so he was consecrated vpon Michaelmas day 759. He tooke euen the like course for his buriall as his predecessor had done. He sate onely 3. yeares. and died Aug. 24.762.

                  764THe monks of S. Augustines taking it very hainously to haue the buriall of their Archbishops discontinued from them; began to make their complaint vnto the Pope. Now though Christchurch-men had no great reason to doubt of the Pope, who had confirmed vnto them this priuiledge at the sute of Bregwyn; yet to make the matter the more sure, they determined to elect Lambert Abbot of Saint Augustines for their Archbishop, assuring themselues hée would now bee as earnest a defender of their liberties; as he had héertofore béene an oppugner in the behalfe of S. Augustins. In his time Offa King of Mercia erected a new Archbishopricke at Litch
                     ••
                  eld, and obtained of the Pope authority for Eadulfus Bishop there to gouerne the Diocesses of Worcester, Legecester, Siduacester, Hereford, Helmham and Dunwich. So that Canterbury had left vnto him for his Prouince onely these, London, Winchester, Rochester, and Sherborne. Some say that Lambert consented vnto this alteration; others report that hée spared no cost to reduce things to their oulde estate. Hee sate manie yéeres, and perceauing his ende to approach, tooke order to bée buried in Saint Augustines, infringing by that meanes the grants and priuiledges of the monks of Christchurch, obtained for the burial of the Archbishops amongst them. He dyed Aug. 12. 790. and was very honourably enterred in the Chapter-house of Saint Augustines.

                  AThelard was first Abbot of Malmesbury, then Bishop of Winchester and lastly consecrated Archbishop: Iuly. 21. 793. A man of great vertue and excellently learned. Offa soone after this being dead, together with his sonne Egfride; Athelard made earnest sute vnto Kenulfe the son of Cuthbert, then King of Mercia that he would restore vnto the Sée of Canterburie, the reuenues and iurisdiction taken from it wrongfully by Offa: Héereunto Kenulfus without much adoe readily assented, as also Leo the third then Pope. Unto whom hee trauelled

in person about that businesse. Hee sate about an eight or nine yéeres, as most report; Malmsbury (to whom I giue credit in that behalfe) saith 13: and dying the yéere 806. was buried in Christ Church to the great discontentment of the monks of S. Augustines.

                  CElnoth that is said to haue béene Deane of the Church of Canterburie,832 succéeded Theologild and continued Archbishop 38. yeares, died anno 870. as most deliuer. William Malmsbury allotteth vnto him onely 41. moneths. His time was excéeding troublesome by reason of the continuall inuasions of the Danes: yet no memorie remaineth of any action of his in so long space of so memorable a time. He died anno 870. and lieth buried in Christchurch in Canterbury.
            
            
               18. Athelredus.
               
                  AThelredus a great diuine,871 sometimes a monke of Christ Church in Canterbury, and then Bishop of Winchester, was Archbishop after Celnoth 18. yéeres. In his time all the monasteries of England, were destroyed by the Danes; so as,

for the space of 90. yeares after, monkerie ceased throughout the realme; yea in the North parts there was not séen

               19. Plegmund.
               
                  889
                  PLegmund the most excellent learned man of his time was borne in the kingdome of Mercia. In his youth hée first dedicated himselfe vnto a solitarie life and liued an Hermite in the Island of Chester, which of him (as it should seeme) was woont to be called Plegmundsham. Hee was taken thence to teach Alfred that was afterward king of England. Being chosen Archbishop, he trauelled to Rome in person, and was there consecrate. Soone after his returne (to requite belike the curtesie hee had found there) hee tooke great paines in collecting the almes of al men well disposed through the land, which the king sent together with much treasure of his owne vnto the Pope by Athelmus Bishop of Winchester, appointing a certaine portion of the same to bee conueied vnto Ierusalem. Marianus then Pope, a little before had gratified the King diuers waies: He had granted immunity of tribute vnto the Saxons schoole at Rome, and sent sundry presents vnto him; namely (amongst other things) a péece of wood that was (as hee would make the King beléeue) part of the crosse vpon which our Sauiour suffered death. By this contribution his kindnesse was sufficiently requited. The most memorable action of this Archbishop is, that the yéere 905. he consecrated seuen Bishops in one day. By reason of continuall wars, all the prouince of the West Saxons had béene without any Bishop seuen yeares: Which Formosus the Pope imputing vnto the negligence of the King, sent out an excommunication against him. Hee therefore caused Plegmund the Archbishop to call a conuocation, wherein it was ordered, that

                  n, insomuch as, they disinherited their sonne Odo for kéeping company with Christians. He therfore forsaking his country, betooke himselfe to the seruice of a noble man in the Court of King Edward the older named Ethelelm; who perceiuing in him a great forwardnes &amp; excellency of wit, set him to schoole, where he profited excéedingly. He was not baptised till he was

come euen vnto mans estate. Soone after his baptisme, by the Councell of his Lord and Master hee entered into orders and became a Deacon; in which office he continued preaching very painefully, vntill at last he was made Priest. Some report that he serued in the warres, some while vnder King Edward before he came a Cleargy man; and it is not vnlikely. For after he was Bishop he was thrise in the field, and did his prince notable seruice. He was preferred to the Bishopricke of Wiltshire (the See whereof was then seated at Ramsbury) by the speciall fauour of King Athelstan the yéere 920. King Athelstan being dead, Edmund his brother (that succéeded) fauouring him no lesse th
                     •
                  n his brother had done; vpon the death of Wlfhelm, procured him to bee chosen Archbishop. A great while Odo refused (because hée was no monke) to take that charge vpon him; saying, that neuer any man had held that place hitherto but he was a monke. Therein he was deceiued. For Nothelmus and two or thrée other before him were secular priests, and not monks. But he resolute in this errour, &amp; leath to breake the dance, was perswaded first to become a monke of Floriake in France; and that done, accepted of the election. He continued Archbishop 24. yéeres, in great fauour and authority vnder diuers Princes, Edmund, Edward, Athelstan, and Eadred. Towards the latter end of his time, Edwyn a yoong Gentleman obtained the Crowne, with whom hée had very ill agreement. He
                     •
                   caused him to bee diuorced from his Queenz some say for consanguinity, some alleage other resons. He excommunicated his Concubines, &amp; causing one of them whom the King doted vnreasonably vpon, to bee fetcht out of the Court by violence, burnt her in the forehead with a hote yron, and banished her into Ireland. These things exasperated the King much against him: But hee was taken away by death soone after, and so deliuered from all feare of the Kings displeasure. He was buried on the south side of the high altar, in a tombe built somewhat after the forme of a Pyramis. I take it to be the tombe of touchstone standing in the grate néer the steps that lend vp to S. Thomas Chappell. After his death (which happened the yéere 958.) Elsinus Bishop of Winchester (that could neuer breake Odo in his life time) by bribery and corrupt meanes obtained election vnto Canterbury, and

comming thither, spurned at his tombe despitefully, vsing these spéeches, now at last (quoth he) thou art dead old dotard, and much against thy will hast left thy place vnto a man woorthier of it th

                  n thy selfe. Our stories report, that the next night Odo appéered vnto him in his sleepe, threatning a speedy and fearefull vengeance of this insolency. According vnto which prediction it fell out, that trauelling to Rome for his pall, vpon the Alpes he was so oprressed with cold, as hee was constrained to put his féete wherewith hee had so contumeliously disgraced his deceased predecessor, into the bollies of his horses, &amp; yet at last to die for cold. Brithelm Bishop of Wels was then chosen Archbishop, a vertuous and méeke man, but not very fit for gouernment: In regard whereof, King Edgar intreated him, and hee easily condiscended, to abide still at his old charge.
            
            
               23. Dunstan.
               WIth the approbation of all men Dunstan Bishop of London was then elected to this Metropoliticall Sée.961 Of whom I know not how to write, that which is deliuered of him is so infinite. But I will hould my selfe within my determined bounds, and send the Reader that is desirous to heare more of him vnto other histories. Hee was borne in Somersetshire of good parentage: his Fathers name was Herstan, and his mothers Kinedcid. He was brought vp for the most part in the Abbey of Glastonbury, where beside other good learning he was also taught to sing, play vpon instruments, to paint and carue, in all which he prooued very excellent. From thence he went vnto Athelm Archbishop of Canterbury his vncle, who commended him vnto the King; And he partly for the good parts he saw in him, partly also for that hee was néere of kinne vnto him, made very much of him. So he liued in the Court a while, till for a certaine miracle (as the monks call it, which was then imputed to Coniuration) with much disgrace he was driuen out of the Court. After this he betook himselfe vnto the seruice of Elphege Bishop of Winchester, another vnkle of his, who perswaded him continually to become a monke. Hee could not heare of that side in

any wise, till vpon a time falling dangerously 
                     •
                  icke, and thinking his disease a plague sent of God for his backwardnesse in that holy course where to his vncle directed him, in greate hast professed himselfe a monke. This done, and hauing recouered his health, hee went to his first nurse Glastonbury, leading there (in outward shew at least) an excéeding strait life. King Edward hearing great fame of his holinesse, sent for him vnto the Court; where he liued in very diuers reputation, sometimes iudged too familiar with faire women, sometimes accounted a coniurer, but for the most part admired as a most holy and vertuous man. Under two princes, Edmund and Eldred (with whom he was most gracious) he ruled all things at his pleasure. Edwyn the sonne of king Edmund that succéeded Eldred, could in no wise brooke him. Some say it was because Dunstan was forward in reprehending the kings vices; as namely, that when the king rising from the feast of his coronation
                     •
                   went immediately to his chamber, where a certaine beautifull Concubine attended his comming; Dunstan that had gotten some inkling of the businesse hee went about, followed him boldly, and forced him not onely to leaue that enterprise for that time, but also to forsweare th
                     •
                   company of that woman. But the vndoubted ground of this dislike was this. Dunstan had so bewitched the former kings with the loue of monkery, as they not onely tooke violently from married Priests their liuings to e
                     •
                  ect monasteries, but also spent very lauishly of their owne treasures, which they should rather haue imployed in resisting the common enimy both of God and their country the Dane. King Edwyn perceiuing all the wealth of the land to bee crept into monasteries, not onely restrained to bestow more vpon them, but recalled diuers of these prodigall gifts his predecessours had made; and when the monks refused to render them at his demaund, hée became a very bitter persecutor of them, and their patrons. Dunstane therefore séeing nothing before him at home but daunger and continuall disgrace, got him away into France, and there liued in banishment the space of a yéere. In the meane time King Edwyn by the rebellion of his subiects (at the instigation it is likely of our monks, and their fauourers) was depriued both of his life and kingdome. Edgar that succéeded, warned by

his brothers example, was content to eurry fauour with them, and to that purpose restored whatsoeuer was taken from them; and not onely called home Dunstan, but promoted him, first vnto the Bishopricke of Worcester, soone after of London, and lastly hauing béene but two yéeres at London, to the Archbishopricke of Canterburie. In that place he continued 27. yéeres, applying all his endeuours to the enriching of monkes and monasteries inhabited by them, persecuting and hunting maried Priests euery where out of their liuing. He died at last May 19. 988. and was long after canonised a Saint.
            
            
               24. Ethelgar.
               AFter Dunstan succéeded Aethelgar sometimes a Monke of Glastonbury;988 afterward Abbot of the newe abbey of Winchester; then Bishop of Seolsey, and lastly made Archbishop of Canterbury 989. He continued in that Sée only one yéere and thrée moneths: Dying then hee was buried in his owne Church. Some say that hée put out Monkes from his Church, and brought in secular Priests in their roomes.
            
            
               25. Siricius.
               
                  SIricius of a monke of Glastonbury was made Abbot of S. Augustine in Canterbury by Dunstan,
                  989 and by his meanes preferred to the Bishopricke of Winchester (as one saith) but it was of Wiltshire or Wilton, and not Winchester. Ethelgar being dead, he bacame Archbishop the yéere 989. Hée is blamed much in our histories for perswading to buy peace of the Danes with 10000. pounds. He sate fower yeares, died 993. and was buried at Canterbury.
            
            
               26. Aluricius alias Alfricus.
               
                  ALuricius was also brought vp at Glastonbury,993 and succéeded Siricius first at Wilton in the Bishopricke there,

then at Canterbury. He died an. 1006. and was buried first at Abingdon, but was afterward remooued to Canterbury. This man in the catalogue of Malmsbury is omitted.
            
            
               27. Elphege.
               
                  1006
                  ELphege was borne of great parentage, and spent his yoonger yeeres in the monastery of Hirst, where hée first entred into religion. After his departure thence he became Prior of Glanstonbury (as Malmsbury saith) which place after a season he left and gaue himselfe to a very straite kinde of life at Bathe, for which he was so much admired (the rather because he was a gentleman of great linnage) as many went about to imitate him, and ioyning themselues to him, made him their gouernour by the name of an Abbot. Hauing liued so a certain space, he was called to the Bishoprick of Winchester the yéere 984. There he continued 12. yéers, &amp; the yeer 1006. was remooued to Canterbury. He was a man of woonderfull abstinence, neuer eating, drinking or sléeping more th

                  n necessitie compelled him; spending his time altogether either in praier, study or other necessary businesse. So that what with preaching and example of holy life he conuerted many vnto Christ. The yeere 1012. it happened the Danes to bee disappointed of certaine tribute which they claimed as due vnto them: For want whereof they spoiled and burnt the citty and Church of Canterbury. The monks and people thereof, men, women and children they tithed; putting nine to the sword, and letting go a tenth onely: So for 804. that were suffered to escape, 7236. went to the pot. As for the Archbishop, they kept him in prison s

                     •
                  ortune they were little and little in a manner all consumed very shortly after. The body of Elphege was first buried in Saint Pauls Church in London, afterward carried to Canterbury, by the commandement of King Knute and there enterred. Hee was made a Saint and allowed the 19. day of Aprill for celebration of his memory.
            
            
               
               28. Liunig alias Lifwing.
               
                  LIunig surnamed Eistan was first Bishop of Wells,1013 and translated to Canterbury soon after the death of Elphege. His time was very troublesome, by reason of the continual inuasion o
                     •
                   the Danes. Besides many other calamities, he endured seuen moneths imprisonment at their hands; from which being deliuered, he departed into voluntary exile, and bewailed there the misery of his country, vntill such time as King Swanus being dead and Ethelred returning, all troubles were appeased. So it pleased God to suffer him at last to ende his daies in peace the yeare 1020. when hee had béene Archbishop about 7. yeares.
            
            
               29. Agelnothus alias Aethelnotus.
               
                  AGelnothus surnamed The Good,
                  1020 was the sonne of an Earle called Agelmare, and is said to haue béene Deane of Christchurch in Canterbury, which at that time was replenished for the most part with canons wearing the habite &amp; garments of monkes, but in profession and manner of life differing much from them. Therefore when as in that same terrible tithing of the Danes mentioned in the life of Elphege al the monkes were slaine except onely foure; the canons that were now the greater number, gaue vnto their gouernour the name of Deane. From this place Agelnoth was taken to be Archbishop. Malmsbury saith he was sometimes a monke of Glastonbury, and therfore procured from king Knute a confirmation of the olde priuiledges of that Abbey, the charter whereof he exemplifieth De reg. 1. c. 11. Going to Rome to fetch his pal, he bought (as one reporteth) an arme of that blessed Father S. Augustine Bishop of Hippo for an hundred talents of siluer &amp; a talent of gold, and bestowed it vpon the Church of Couentry. He sustained great paines and cost in repairing his church and monastery destroyed and burnt by the Danes, and by his good aduise directed king Knute (that fauoured him exceedingly) vnto many honourable enterprises. Hee died at last hauing sate Archbishop 17. yéeres and vpward, October 29. an. 1038.
            
            
               
               30. Eadsin.
               
                  1038
                  EAdsin was a secular Priest, and first Chapleine vnto King Harold, who preferred him to the Bishopricke of Winchester. Thence hee was remoued to Canterburie soone after the death of Agelnoth. Hée continued Archbishop almost 12. yéeres: All which time he was so oppressed with sicknesse, as hee could not attend his pastorall charge, but was faine to commit the same to another: and hee made choice of one Siward, Abbot of Abingdon, whom he termed sometimes Vicarium suum, sometimes Chorepiscopum, and somtimes Archiepiscopi vices moderantem. Hee discharged not his duty according to the trust reposed in him: For hée abused much not onely his authority, but also the goods, yea and person also of the Archbishop that committed the same vnto him. In regard whereof, though Eadsinus besought the King and other about him very earnestly, that hée might succéede him, (not knowing belike how ill he was vsed so well as they) yet they would not condescend thereunto: but bestowed vpon him the Bishopricke of Rochester. Henry Huntingdon saith hee was consecrated Archbishop, and Florent Wig: saith hee died some little space before Eadsin. But they are both mistaken I thinke. As for Edsinus himselfe, certaine it is, he departed this life October 28. 1050. was buried in his owne Church, and after his death made a Saint.
            
            
               31. Robert, surnamed Gemeticensis.
               
                  1050
                  RObert a Norman succéeded by the fauour of King Edward the Confessor, with whom hée became acquainted, at what time hée was exiled into Normandy. Hee preferred him first vnto London, and then presently after the death of Eadsin vnto Canterbury. This man is saide to haue laid the first foundation of the Normanes conquest in England, perswading ye king to make Duke William his heir; wherunto when the King had condescended, himselfe became the mesenger of this good tidings vnto the Duke, taking Harold with

him; peraduenture to that purpose, that hee might so hamper him with an oath (as indeed hee did) and so barre him from all possibility of the kingdome. This oath Harold afterward broke; but he spedde thereafter, loosing his life and ill-gotten kingdom both together. The Arcbishop now assuring himselfe of the fauour not onely of the King present, but of him also that was to succéede: could not indure that any should beare so great sway as himselfe in Court, and therefore fell to deuising how hée might ouerthrow Emma the Kings mother, who onely séemed to ouertop him. He began therefore to beat in
                     •
                  to the Kings head (that was a milde and soft-natured Prince) how hard a hand his mother had held vpon him when he liued in Normandy; how likely it was that his brother came to his death by the practise of her and Earle Godwyn; and lastly that she vsed the company of Alwyn Bishop of Winchester, somwhat more familiarly th
                     •
                  n was for her honour. The King somewhat too rashly crediting these tales without any further examination or debating of the matter, seased vpon all his mothers goods, and committed her to prison in the Nunry of Warwell; vanished Earle Godwyn and his sons; and commanded Alwyn vpon paine of death not to come forth of the gates of Winchester. The Quéen made the best friends shée could to be called to her answere: But the Archbishop so possessed the king, as other tryall of her innocency might not be allowed th
                     •
                  n this. She must walke ouer nine plowshares red hot in the midst of the Cathedrall Church of Winchester. If either she performed not this kind of purgation, or were found any thing at all hurt, she and the Bishop both should bée estéemed guilty: If otherwise, the Archbishop was content to submit himselfe to such punishment as they should haue endured. To make short, the Quéene led betwéene two Bishops in open sight of all the people, performed (as all our histories report) this hard kind of purgation, and so acquitted her selfe and Alwyn the Bishop of these crimes obiected. The king then greatly bewailing the wrong done to his mother, asked her forgiuenes vpon his knées, restored both her and the Bishop vnto their goods and former places; and lastly (to make some satisfaction for his fault committed) would needes bee whipped by the hands of the Bishops there present, and receiuing

thrée stripes of his mother, was by her cléerely forgiuen, and the wrong promised for euer héereafter to bée forgotten. Emma now and the Bishop to shew themselues thank
                     •
                  full vnto God for his miraculous deliuerance, for a perpetuall memoriall of the same, gaue each of them vnto the monastery of S.

Now to returne vnto the Archbishop; he doubting of the successe of this matter, vnder pretence of sicknesse held himselfe at Douer; &amp; assoone as hee heard how the world went, well knowing England would prooue too hot for him, hée got him ouer into his owne Country to the Abbey of Gemetica where hée was brought vp, and there ouercome (it is like with shame &amp; sorrow) within a short time after ended his daies, and was buried in the Monastery aforesaid, hauing béene Archbishop about the space of two yéer

               32. Stigand.
               
                  1052.
                  STigand was Chaplaine vnto King Edward the Confessor, and preferred by him first vnto the Bishopricke of the East Saxons and Helmham 1043. and after vnto Winchester the yéere 1047. Hée was a man stout and wise enough, but very vnlearned (as in a manner all the Bishops were of those times) and vnreasonable couetous. Perceiuing the King highly displeased with Robert the Archbishop, hée thrust himselfe into his roome (not expecting either his death, depriuation or other auoydence) without any performance of vsuall ceremonies. And whether it were that hee mistrusted his title to Canterbury, or inexcusable couetousnesse I cannot tell; certaine it is, that he kept Winchester also together with Canterbury, euen vntill a little before his death hee was forced to forgoe them both. Many times hee was cited vnto Rome about it; but by gifts, delayes and one meanes or other hee droue it off, neuer beeing able to procure his pall thence so long as King Edward liued. William the Conquerour

hauing slaine king Harold in the field, all England yéelded presently vnto his obedience, except onely Kentishmen, who following the counsell of Stigand and Egelsin the Abbot of S. Augustines, gathered al their forces together at Swanscombe néere Grauesend, and there attended the comming of the King (who doubted of no such matter) euery man holding a gréene bough in his hand; whereby it came to passe that hee was in the middest of them before he dreamed of any such businesse toward. Hee was greatly amazed at the first, till hée was giuen to vnderstand by Stigand, there was no hurt meant vnto him, so that hee would graunt vnto that country their ancient liberties, and suffer them to bee gouerned by their former customes and lawes, called then and till this day Gauelkind. These things hee easily yéelded vnto, vpon this armed intercession, and afterward very honourably performed: But hée conceiued so profound a displeasure against Stigand for it as he neuer ceased till hee had reuenged it with the others destruction. A while he gaue him very good countenance, calling him Father, meeting him vpon the way when hee vnderstood of his repaire toward him, and affoording him all kind of gracious and fauourable vsage both in wordes and behauiour: but it lasted not long. The first signe of his hidden rancour and hatred toward him was, that hée would not suffer himselfe to bee crowned by him, but made choice of Aldred Archbishop of Yorke: for which hee alleadged other reasons, as that hee had not yet receiued his pall, &amp;c. But the matter was, hee was loth in that action to acknowledge him for Archbishop. Soone after his coronation, hée departed into Normandy carrying with him Stigand and many English nobles, vnder pretence to doe them honour: But in truth hee stoode in doubt least in his absence they should practise somewhat against him: And namely Stigand he knew to bee a man of a haughty spirite, subtle, rich, gracious and of great power in his Country. Presently vpon his returne, certaine Cardinalls arriued in England, sent from the Pope as Legates to redresse (as they saide) certaine enormities and abuses of the English Clergy. Stigand by and by perceiuing himselfe to bee the marke that was specially shot at, hid himselfe a while in Scotland with Alexander Bishop of Lincolne, and

after in the Isle of Ely. At last perceiuing a conuocation to be called at Winchester, he came thither and besought the King in regard of his owne honour, and the promise made vnto him at Swanscombe (which was, not to bee offended with him or any other for their attempt at that time) to saue him from the calamity hee saw growing toward him, which hee could not impute vnto any thing so probably, as his vndeserued displeasure. The king answered him with very gentle words, that hee was so farre from endeuouring to take any reuenge of that or any other matter, as hée loued him, and wished hee knew how to protect him from the daunger imminent: But that which was to bee done at that time, must bée done by the Popes authority, which hee might not countermand. So do what he could, hee was depriued of his liuings by these legates. The causes alleaged against him were these; First, that he had held Canterbury and Winchester both together (which was no very strange thing; for Saint Oswald had long before held Worcester with Yorke, and S. Dunstan Worcester with London.) Secondly, that hee had inuaded the Sée of Canterbury, Robert the Archbishop beeing yet aliue vndepriued; And lastly that he presumed to vse the pall of his predecessor Robert left at Canterbury, and had neuer receiued any pall but of Pope Benedict, at what time hee stood excommunicate for simony and other like crimes. In the same conuocation many other Prelates were depriued of their promotions as Agelmare Bishop of Helmham brother vnto Stigand, diuers Abbots and men of meaner places. All which was done by the procurement of the King, that was desirous to place his countrymen in the roomes of the depriued for the establishment of his new-gotten kingdome. Poore Stigand being thus depriued, as though he had not yet harme enough, was also clapt vp presently in prison within the Castell of Winchester, and very hardly vsed there, beeing scarcely allowed meate inough to hold life and soule together. That was thought to bee done to force him to confesse where his treasure lay, whereof being demaunded, hee protested with great oathes he had no mony at all; hoping belike so to procure his liberty the rather, and then to make himselfe merry with that he had laid vp against such a déere yéere. Hée died soone

after of sorrow and griefe of minde, or (as some report) of voluntary famine, 17. yéeres after he first obtained the Archbishopricke. After his death, a little key was found about his necke; the locke whereof being carefully sought out, shewed a nete or direction of infinite treasures hid vnder ground in diuers places. All that the King pursed in his owne coffers. The bones of this Archbishop lye entoombed at this day vpon the top of the north wall of the Presbytery of the Church of Winchester in a coffin of lead, vpon the north side whereof are written these words, Hic iacet Stigandus Archiepiscopus. He was depriued ann. 1069. and died within the compasse of the same yéere.

Through France hee came into Normandy, prouoked by the same, and great reports, hee had heard of Eluin, or Herlewin abbot of Becco. Upon the way thitherward, it was his hap to bee encountred with théeues that spoiled him of all hée had, bound him and threw him into a thicket; where hee might haue perished with cold and hunger, had not God sent some extraordinary company that way that loosed him, hauing la

                     •
                   after that, he was made Prior of Becco; whence in regard of his singular wisdome and great knowledge in all good learning (that those times could affoord) he was called by Duke William to be Abbot of S. Stephens in Cane, a monastery that the saide Duke had founded. Now Stigand being displaced in manner aboue rehearsed, the Conquerour well knowing how

much it behooued him to the establishment of his new erected throne in England, to haue a man wise and faithfull in that place
                     •
                   made a speciall choice of him, as one in all respectes most fitte and worthy; which being well knowne to all men, the Couent at the Kings first nomination readily chose him, the nobility and courtiers willingly assented, and receiued him with great applause, and lastly the Pope affoorded him his pall with extraordinary fauour. It is said, at his first comming the Pope rose vp vnto him and mette him, telling him he yeelded him that honour, not of duety, but in regard of his excellent learning, wherof he had heard great fame. Thomas Archbishop of Yorke was present the same time, together with Remigius Bishoppe of Dorchester. This Thomas had béene lately consecrated vnto Yorke by Lanfranke, and for a certaine time refused to make profession of obedience vnto the Sée of Canterbury, euen vntill by the commandement of the King he was enforced thereunto. Now whether it were discontentment and perswasion of a wrong, or else enuy at Lanfrankes eyther vertue or good fortune that moued him, hée presently beganne to make complaint vnto the Pope of a great iniury offered vnto his Sée, in the demaund of his profession. Lanfranke pleaded prescription for his right, and offered to make proofe of the same. The Pope therefore not willing to trouble himselfe any more with the matter, committed the hearing thereof vnto the king, who in the yéere 1072. iudged it for Canterbury. Sée more of this quarrell in Thomas of Yorke. Lanfranke himselfe was consecrated very solemnly at Canterbury, all the Bishoppes in England being present themselues, or by their Proctors, August, 29. or (as Hou

Almost 18. yéers he continued Archbishop, gouerning his charge laudably, and happily, till that about the end of his time, one action obscured his former prayses, and furthermore was the cause of many great calamities vnto him. It is thought that VVilliam the Conquerour left the Kingdome of England vnto his yonger sonne VVilliam Rufus, at the perswasion especially of this Archbishop, who the rather wisht well vnto the young Prince, because hee had béene brought vp vnder him in his childhoode. He is

blamed much for putting the eldest sonne Robert from that which might seeme in some sort due vnto him; and surely God blessed him not in that action. The King thus aduanced by him, fell out with him, and droue him out of the realme. The cause of this displeasure is diuersly reported: But most men agrée it was none other th
                     •
                  n this, that the King thought him a little too busie in exhorting him to vertue and godlinesse, and reprehending his manifold vices. Being thus banished, he trauailed to Rome, and wandred vp and down many countries, till at last (by what intercession I finde not) he was suffered to come home againe. Soone after his returne, hée fell sick of an ague, &amp; died of the same according to his own desire. For it is remembred he would often wish hée might take his end either by a flux or an ague, for that in those kind of infirmities men are woont to haue the vse both of spéech and memorie to the last cast. He deceased (as most write) Iun. 4. or (as Houeden, Florentius, Wigorn, and other deliuer) May 24. 1089. He was buried at Canterbury in his own Church, vnto which he was a great benefactor. He bestowed much vpon the fabrike and reparation of the same, built much housing for the Monkes (whose number he encreased from 30. to 140) restored the dignities and offices of olde belonging to the Monastery, and recouered vnto the same 25.

                  1093. W. Rufus. 7FOwer yéeres the Sée continued voide, after the death of Lanfranke, and the King pursed the profites thereof. In what good moode I know not, he which was wont to sell all other Ecclesiasticall promotions as it were by the drumme, bestowed this Archbishopricke fréely, vpon a most worthie man, Anselm Abbot of Becco. This Anselm was horne at Augusta a City of Burgundy standing at the foot of the Alpes. His fathers name was Gundulfe (a man of great account in his Country) and his mothers Hemeberg. He came vnto Becco of the like errand as Lanfranke had done, moued thereunto by the great fame of the said Lanfranke, and professed himselfe a Monk there in the 27. yéere of his age. Lanfranke being called away to Cane, hee was made Prior, and soone after Abbot; Eluin, or Herlewin, the old Abbot being dead. In that place he continued 15. yéers, &amp; then was earnestly requested by Hugh Earle of Chester lying bery sicke, to come into England vnto him to conferre with him, and to order certaine affaires of his. H
                     •
                  ther he came and had much honour done him euery where of all sorts of people. The King himselfe amongst the rest, beside many verball fauours, made offer vnto him of the Archbishopricke of Canterbury; verily hoping belike that a man giuen to Monasticall contemplation, &amp; not estéeming worldly pompe, would vndoubtedly haue refused the same: For it is certaine, that after Anselm had accepted the offer, pittying belike the spoil and desolation of the Church for want of a pastor; the King would faine haue retracted his gift, and perswaded him with many reasons to leaue it; shewing him how the burthen and trouble of the place was greater than hée should bée able to endure, a man that had spent his time within the wals of a Monastery, and not experienced in managing of great affaires. But he lost his labour: Anselm kept fast his hold, and was soone after consecrated by Walkelin Bishop of Winchester, or (as I finde also recorded) by Thomas Archbishop of Yorke, Decemb. 4. 1093. all the Bishops of the land that could possibly come, being present at that solemnity. Presently after his consecration, the king and he fell out. Not long

before, the king had throwne downe thirty churches to make his new forrest néere Winchester. This Anselm reprehended him sharpely for, and besought him to amend that and other faults; as namely his simony, his extortion, his cruelty, &amp;c. wherein hée dayly offended God grieuously, and greatly dishonoured himself. This admonition of his displeased the king very much; but his quarrell in shew was none other then this, that asking leaue to goe to Rome to fetch his pall, he had named Vrban Pope, whom the king as yet had not acknowledged for Pope; and for so doing, accused him of no lesse than high treason. After great stirre and much adoe between them about this matter, it was determined that all the abbots and Bishops of England should be called together to iudge of this controuersie. They met at Rochingham Castle; and the matter being proposed by the king, for feare or flattery they all assented vnto him, and forsooke their Archbishop, except onely Gundulphus Bishop of Rochester. A while hee endured to liue in continuall feare and disgrace, euen vntill hee was commanded out of the Realme by the king. Being at Douer ready to take ship, all his carriages were searcht, his goodes there and elsewhere soeuer taken from him and folde to the kings vse, his temporalties seased, and himselfe set a land in France in a manner naked. He trauelled presently to Lyons, and was sent for thence by the Pope. At his first comming to Rome, hée had all manner of fauour: But by that time the king with golden eloquence had informed him of the cause, his entertainement began to war colder. He determined therfore to haue returned to Lyons, but was stayed by the Pope; whose pleasure while hée was content to awaite a while longer, the Pope dyed. Soone after him, the King died also; being chanceably slaine by the glance of an arrow as hee was hunting in that forrest, for the making whereof, Anselm had reprehēded him. This king was a very vicious prince, conetous in getting, &amp; prodigal in spending, the most sacrilegious symonist that euer raigned in England. Reioycing in the gaine he made that way, he would oftē say, Panis Christi panis pinguis. His death as som report was miraculously signified vnto Anselme in France. A paper was put into the hands of one of his Chaplaines no man knew how, in which was found written,

                  Galielmus Rufus occisus est. Within a few dayes after, certaine word was brought of the tyrants death, and this notice taken as sent from heauen. Henry the first succeeded William Rufus in the kingdom, who presently called home Anselme, and restored him to his former place. The first thing he did at his returne, he called a conuocation at London, wherein he depriued many Prelates of great place for their seuerall offences, Guy Abbot of VVindham &amp; Eldwyn of Ramsey for symony; Geffry of Peterburgh, Haymo of Cherwell, and Egelrie of Middleton for not being in orders; Richard of Ely, &amp; Robert of S. Edmunds, all Abbots, for other enormities. Diuers canons were agréed vpō in the same conuocation too long to rehearse: Some of them tended to the restraining of Clergy men from marriage, which notwithstanding many married dayly, and many that came for orders refused vtterly to make profession of chastity, as wée may see reported by Girard Archbishop of Yorke in an Epistle written by him vnto Anselm in the end of S. Anselmes Epistles. The falling out also of Anselme with the King (which happened presently after) was a great weakening vnto these Canons. All the time that the Archbishop was absent (which was thrée yéeres) the King had disposed of all Bishoprickes that fell, at his pleasure, giuing inuestiture &amp; possession of them, by deliuery of the staffe &amp; the ring. And indéed the Princes in a manner of all Christendome, had taken this kinde of authority vnto themselues euery where about this time. Bishops thus appointed, demanded consecration of Anselm, which he vtterly denied vnto them, prosessing withall, that hee would neuer receiue, or repute them for Bishops that were already consecrated by other vpon such election; alleadging how it was lately forbidden in a Councell held by Pope Vrban the second, that any Clerke should take inuestiture of any spiritual preferment at the hand of any King, Prince or other lay man. The king vpon Anselms refusall, required Gerard Archbishoppe of Yorke, to giue these Bishoppes consecration; whereunto hee readily assented. But VVilliam Gifford nominated to Winchester stoode so in awe of Anselm, as that he durst not accept consecration at Gerards hands. This incensed the King wonderfully; so as presently hée commanded Giffards goods to

bée confiscate, and himselfe banished the Realme. Great adoo now there was about this matter throughout the realm; some defending the Kings right, others taking part with the Archbishop. In the end, the King doubting what might come of it, and being loath to giue occasion of tumult, considering that himselfe was a stranger borne, and that his father by force and much bloudshed, had not many yéeres since obtained the rule of this land: he determined to send an Ambassador to the Pope, together with the Archbishop, so to grow to some reasonable conclusion. The Pope (Paschalis 2.) would not yéelde one iot vnto the King: insomuch as, when the kings Ambassador William Warelwast (after Bishop of Exce
                     •
                  ter) saide hee knew the King would rather loose his crowne then this priuiledge; he answered, yea, let him loose his head also if hee will, while I liue he shall neuer appoint Bishop but I wil resist him what I may. So without doing any good, homeward they came. But the king vnderstanding before hand how the world went, sent a messenger to forbid Anselm entrance into the Realme, and presently seised all his goodes mooneable and vnmooueable into his hands. Three yéeres more hée spent in exile, all which time hée liued with Hugh Archbishoppe of Lyons. At last it pleased God to open this passage of his reconciliation to the King. Adela Countesse of Bloys, the Kings sister, fell dangerously sicke in those parts, where it chanced the Archbishop to abide. Hée went to visite her, and yéelded so great comfort vnto her in that time of her distresse, as recouering afterward, she neuer reased importuning her brother, vntill shee had wrought an agreement betweene them, the conditions whereof were these; First, that Anselme should be content to consecrate the Bishops already nominated by the king: And then that the king should renounce all right to such nomination or inuestiture for the time to come. These conditions were allowed by the Pope, and the Archbishop restored not onely to his place, but to all his goodes and fruites gathered in the time of his absence. Two yeeres hee liued after this his last returne: in which time he persecuted married Priests very extreamly. Dunstan, Oswald, Ethelwald, and other enemies to the marriage

of Clergy men, had onely expelled them out of Monasteries that had wiues: But Anselme vtterly forbidding them marriage, depriued them of their promotions that were married, con
                     •
                  iscated their goods vnto the Bishop of the Dioces, adiudged them and their wiues adulterers, and forced all that entred into orders to vow chastity. Halfe the Clergy of England at this time were either married men, or the sonnes of married Priests. The king therefore pittying the generality of this calamity, sought to protect them a while from Anselmes seuerity in this point: But he (I meane Anselm) was a little too resolute in all his determinations; in so much as hee might neuer bée perswaded to yéelde one iot in any thing he once intended. So, notwithstanding the Kings inclination to succour so many distressed poore families, the Canons of the Conuocation before mentioned were generally put in execution throughout England. About this time it hapned Gerard Archbishop of Yorke to decease, and a second Thomas to be elected for his successor. What adoo there was betweene him and Anselme about profession of obedience, and how it was ended, see in the history of the said Thomas. To make an end at last with this Archbishop, the yeere 1109. hee fell extreamely sicke at Saint Edmundsbury, and thence got him to Canterbury, where hee lay languishing a long time, and at last departed this life, Aprill 21. in the 16. yéere of his gouernment, and of his age 76. He was first buried at the heade of his predecessor Lanfranke, but remoued after to the east end of his Church of Canterbury (vpon the building and beautifying whereof, he had bestowed very much money.) And almost 400. yeeres after by the procurement of Iohn Moorton one of his successors was canonized a Saint. A man of great learning as his works yet extant testifie, whereof one entituled, Cur Deus homo, he writ in the Abbey of Telesin in Italy, while there hee waited the Popes leysure; An other, De processione Spiritûs Sancti, containeth principally the effect of a Sermon preached at the Councell of Barum, in the presence of certaine Grecian Prelates, whose Church hath long dissented from vs in opinion concerning that matter. As for the life and conuersation of Anselm, it was for integrity euen

admirable. That he was more peremptory in diuers of his resolutions th

                  dly notwithstanding these imperfections, hée was a good and holy man; and as worthy the honour of a Saint, I dare pronounce, as any that euer was Canonized by the Pope since his time. In fauour of him (to note that by the way) the Pope affoorded vnto his Sée this honour, that whereas the Archbishoppe of Canterbury was wont to sit next the Bishoppe of Saint Ruffine in all generall Councels, hereafter his place should be at the Popes right foot, and withall vsed these words, Includamus hunc in orbe nostro tanquam alterius orbis Papam

               THe King well remembring how troublesome the austerity of Anselme had béene vnto him,1114. Hen. 1.15. and knowing it greatly imported him to make choice of some quiet tractable man to succéede in that place; tooke fiue yéeres deliberation before hee would appoint any thereunto. April, 26. 1114. hée caused a Councell to bée called of all the chiefe Clergy men, and Nobility of the Realme, referring himselfe vnto them for the nomination of an Archbishoppe, but declaring that for his owne part hée liked best of one Farecius Abbot of Abingdon. They notwithstanding made choice of Ralfe Bishop of Rochester. This Ralfe or Rodolph was a Norman borne, a Monke first of the order of Saint Bennet, and a Disciple of Lanfrank in the Abbey of Cane. Then hee became Abbot of Say; and so continued, vntill that vpon disagréement betweene him and a Noble man of that Country Robert de Belesmo, waxing weary of that Country, he came into England; and hauing no place of abode, trauelled vp and downe from one Monastery to an other, till at last the Archbishop gaue him entertainement for a while, and then preferred him to the Bishopricke of Rochester,

whereunto hée was consecrate, Aug. 11. 1108. To Canterbury he was remoued in Iune, 1114. and had his pall very solemnely deliuered vnto him by Anselm Abbot of Saint Sabine, Ne

               36. William Corbell.
               
                  WIlliam Corbell or Corbois, was first a secular Priest, then a Monke of the order of Saint Benet,
                  1122. Hen. 1.23. and lastly Prior of Saint Sythes in Chiche. From thence he was taken to bée Archbishoppe of Canterbury, and the Popes Legate vpon Candlemas day, 1122. This man in the yéere 1126. called a Conuocation at Westminster, where Iohn de Crema the Popes Legate inueighed most bitterly against the marriage of Priests, and was the next night taken in bed with a common strumpet; for shame wherof he presently got him away, leauing all his businesse at sixe and seauen, neuer taking leaue of any body. In this Synode more Canons were yet made against the marriage of Clergy men; which notwithstanding, the Archbishoppe (that in déede was but a weake man) not able to restraine them of his time from taking wiues; prayed aide of the King, who eyther set them all to a yéerely pension (so many as were married) or els tooke some large summe of present money to beare with them. The yeare 1130. Christchurch in Canterbury (that had lately béen new built by Lanfranke, soone after fell downe (a great parte of it at least) and was by the industry of Eardulfe the Prior, quickly repayred) now I know not by what chance was all burnt and consumed with fire. This Archbishop found means to repaire it againe, and in Rogation wéeke the yéere following, did dedicate the same wonderfull solemnely in the presence of the King, the Quéene, Dauid king of Scots, &amp; a great number of the nobility of both Realms. K. Henry dying that did prefer him, he was content to betray his daughter Mawde the Empresse, and contrary to his oath to ioine with Stephen Earle of Bloys, whom he crowned with his owne handes; but with such feare and terror of conscience, as it is noted, that the consecrate host fell out of his hand in the middle of Masse, by reason of his trembling and fearefull amazednesse. Soone after he died, viz. the yéere 1136. hauing sate almost 14. yeares, and lyeth buried in his own Church, the particular place I finde not.
            
            
               
               37. Theobald.
               
                  1138. K. Steph. 4.IN a Conuocation held at London by the commandement of Albert Cardinall Bishop of Hostia the Popes Legate, Theobald was chosen Archbishop by the suffragan Bishops of his owne Prouince, and consecrate in the same Conuocation or Synode by the Legate afore named. He receiued his Pall at Rome of Innocentius the second who also indued him and his successors for euer with the title of Legatus natus. This Theobald was first a Benedictine monks, and then (til he was chosen Archbishop) Abbot of Becco. A man of no great learning but of so gentle &amp; swéet behauiour (being very wise withall) as he was greatly estéemed of high and low, kings, nobles and commons. With the Pope he had often much ado. One Syluester a man infamous for many notorious offences, was presented vnto the Abbotship of Saint Augustines in Canterbury, whom in respect of his knowne vnworthines the Archbishop refused to admit. But the Popes letters came so thicke and thréefolde in fauour of him, that after many delayes, excuses and allegations against him, at last hee was faine to receiue him. There was at the same time one Ieremy Prior of that Abbey, an olde acquaintance and friend of the Archbishops, whom notwithstanding (vpon some great occasion it is like) the Archbishop depriued and remoued from his place. In the behalfe of this man also, the Pope (who neuer was wont to faile where hée might be well paide for his paines) began to stickle and to enterpose his authority, restoring Ieremy to his place againe, till the cause might bée heard and determined before him. Whereat Theobald, though a milde man of nature, being excéedingly moued, in a great fury vowed hée would neuer exercise any Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction so long as Ieremy helde that roome. He therefore séeing the Archbishop so resolute against him, and fearing some great inconuenience, would fal vpon the monastery by means of this businesse, and to procure him the hatred of his owne company, vpon payment of 100. marks, was content to giue ouer his said preferment, &amp; liued a priuate Monke in the same house euer after. In the time of this trouble, S. Barnard writ

in his behalfe vnto Pope Innocentir. recommending vnto him both the man and his cause. It is his 111. Epistle. Now in the third yéere of his consecration, it happened a Councell was summoned at Rhemes, whereunto hee was called. Henry therefore Bishoppe of Winchester King Stephens brother (that by vertue of his power Legantyne had often contended with him, and euer opposed himselfe against him in the Popes behalfe) circumuented this good plaine meaning man in this sort. He dealt first with the Pope in no wise to dispense with his absence; and then with his brother the King to forbid his passage, and perforce to stay him at home. But such were those times, as it was safer then to offend the King then the Pope; and therefore hee resolued to go, and in no wise to giue the Pope such an aduantage, against whome hée had now twice opposed himselfe already dangerously. Go therefore he would, but all the difficulty was in getting passage. All the ports of England were laide for him; yet so cunningly he handled the matter, that ouer the seas hee got, and was at the Councell in good time. The King then following the aduice of his brother the Bishop of Winchester, seased vpon his goods and temporalities, and banished him the Realm. Hée like a tall fellow interdicted the king and the whole Realme, and taking aduantage of the time which was very troublesome, (notwithstanding the Kings commandement) came home, and liued in Norfolke, till by the intercession of certaine Bishops he was restored. Afterward he grew into great fauour with the King; and was the chiefe meanes of concluding that finall peace at Wallingforde betweene him and Maud the Empresse. In the yéere 1152. hée summoned a conuocation at London, where the King would haue constrained the Clergy to make Eustace his sonne King, to the disheriting and great iniury of Duke Henry the Empresses sonne. The intent was spied before, and letters procured from the Pope to forbid the Clergy to meddle in any such busines. This notwithstanding, the matter was earnestly followed in behalfe of the young Prince Eustace, insomuch as, when they perceiued it was not effected according to their desire, they shut the doores vpon the Clergy in the place where they were gathered together, and thought by force and threatening to

compell them before they should depart. The greater number seemed to yeelde; when Theobald stealing secretly out of the place, tooke his barge, and rowing downe the Thames, gotte him beyond sea, and so by his absence the Synode was dissolued. His goodes by and by were once more confiscate, and his temporalties seased into the Kings hands. But in a short time after King Stephen died, and Henry Duke of Normandy, surnamed Fitz-Empresse succéeded, who restored him immediately to all his possessions againe. Under him he passed the rest of his dayes quietly in great fauour and estimation. Hée departed this life the yéere 1160. when hée had sate Archbishoppe two and twenty yéeres. Perceyuing his end to approach, hee made his Will, and gaue all his goods vnto the poore, or other like go

               38. Thomas Becket.
               
                  1161. Hen. 2.8.SInce the Conquest neuer any Englishman obtained this Archbishoppericke before Thomas Becket. He was borne in London, his fathers name was Gilbert a Marchant, his mother was a stranger borne in Syria, He was first taught and brought vp during the time of his childhoode by the Prior of Merton, and séeming towardly, was sent to the Uniuersities of Oxford and Paris: Hauing there attained some more learning, and also the knowledge of the French tongue, hée returned, and became an officer in some Court about London; it is saide, he was a Iustice; Stow in his Suruay of London, deliuereth that he was the Sheriffes Clarke: but waxing soon weary of that kind of life, he found meanes to get into the seruice of Theobald the Archbishop, who quickly espying his manifold good parts, loued him entirely, and sent him into Italy, at Bononia to study the Canon law, lest there might bee any thing wanting in him requisite in a Common wealths man, for the managing wherof he discerned him thē very fit &amp; likely. Upon his returne thence, it should séeme hee repayred to Oxford, where Gul. Worcestrensis saith, he proceeded Doctor of Law. After which, in short time hee was preferred by the

Archbishop vnto the Archdeaconry of Canterbury, the Prouostship of Beuerley and the parsonages of Bromfield, and S. Mary hill, a Prebend in Paules, and another in the Church of Lincolne. The Archbishop then séeing himselfe sick &amp; weakly, which made him altogether vnable to looke throughly into the drifts and deuises of Courtiers (that in all ages séeke to prey vpon the Church, and euer néede some watchfull eye to ouerlooke their practises) commended Thomas Becket vnto the King so effectually, as hée was content first to receiue him into the number of his Chaplaines, then made him Chancellour of England, and loaded him with all kind of spirituall preferment. For Theobald being a wise man, well perceiued Becket to bée first so subtle and discréete, so painefull and industrious, as the King being yet young, he would surely possesse him altogether, and bee able to withstand any endeuours that might bee preiudiciall vnto the Church; And againe, hee could not doubt either of his faithfulnesse to him, or his stoutnesse in so good a cause, of which both hee had had long experience. In regard hereof, hée imployed all his endeauour, to plant a perfect liking of Thomas Becket in the mind of the King; wherein he prospered so well, as in a short time no man was so farre in the Kings bookes as he, nay no man could doe any thing in a maner with the King but he. For the maintaining of this his credite (saith one) he thought it good to relinquish and forsake by little and little all Priestly eyther behauiour or attire, to affect the pompe and brauery of the Court, to liue as other Courtiers, to fare daintily, to lie long in bed, to hawke, to hunt, to haue many followers, &amp;c. in so much as some sticked not to say, the Chancellor had forgotten he was an Archdeacon also, and blamed him for not liuing like a Clergy man. But by this meanes (saith hée) Thomas Becket was euer at the kings elbow, was partaker of all his counsels, &amp; either by notice giuen to the Archbishop, or some deuise of his owne otherwise, could and did stop any courses that might bée preiudiciall to the Church. Hauing continued thus in the office of Chancellor foure or fiue yeeres with the great fauour and liking of the King, it hapned Theobald the Archbishoppe to die. The king little thinking what a snake he nourished

in his bosome, determined by him to doo his vtmost endeuour for the aduancement of him (Thomas Becket) vnto the Archbishoppricke. Being therefore at that time in Normandy, he sent Richard Lucy a counsellor of speciall trust into England with charge to effect these two things; first to procure all the Nobles, and best of the Comminalty to sweare fealty vnto young Prince Henry his sonne, and then to cause the Monkes of Canterbury to elect Thomas his Chancellour Archbishoppe. The first he quickly brought to passe (the rather by the helpe of the Chancellour that was ioyned in Commission with him.) And in the second also hée bestirred himselfe so well, as he caused the whole Conuocation of the Clergy (a most authenticall kinde of election) to choose Thomas Becket for their Archbishoppe, no one man gainesaying it, except Gilbert Foliot Bishoppe of London. Hée was consecrate Archbishop vpon Whitsonday (béeing made Priest but iust the day before) by the Bishop of Winchester, anno 1162. béeing not yet full forty foure yéers of age. Presently after his consecration, hee altered all the whole course of his life, became so grave, so austere, and so deuout in all outward shew, as hée séemed quite another man. Also hee resigned his Chancellorship, certifying the king by letters, (who was then in Normandy) he could not serue the Church and the Court both at once. The King that euer hitherto thought to vse Thomas Becket as a Schoolemaster to instruct and inure his sonne in matters of state aud policy: was now very sorry that he had made him Archbishopp, séeing he threw off all care of temporall gouernment; and considering the hawtinesse of his spirits, sore doubted wherunto this strange dealing would grow at the last. Another thing the king greatly disliked in him was this; that being yet scarsely warme in his seate, he beganne to looke so narrowly into the state of the land belonging to his Sée, and to challenge with such extremity what soeuer might séem to pertaine vnto him, as he prouoked many of all sorts of people against him, who euery where exclaimed with open mouth, and made their complaints thicke and thréefold vnto the king, saying, that hauing some authority and more knowledge in the law; vnder colour of defendiug the rights of his Church she tooke

violently from euery man what hee li
                     •
                  t. But the maine quarrell betwixt the king and him was this: The Cleargy of those times bare themselues so bold vpon the priuiledges of the Church (whereby, in crimes neuer so hainous they claymed to be exempted from the iudgement of temporall Courts) as, daily infinite outrages were committed by Cleargy men, murthers, robberies, rapes, &amp;c. which temporall Iudges might not meddle withall; and in the spirituall Courts they were either not punished, or for the most part very lightly. For the amendment and preuention of this inconuenience in time to come, the king intended to publish a certaine declaration of the customes of England set downe long since by king Henry the first his gandfather, wherein this intollerable and licentious liberty of the Cle
                     •
                  rgy was somewhat restrained. And that it might not bee spurned at by any (the Archbishop especially he doubted) hée deuised to send this declaration 
                     •
                  nto the Pope, and to craue his allowance of the same. But the Archbishop hauing some inkling of the kings intent before hand, had so dealt with the Pope, as it was no sooner séene but it was straight reiected. Heerewith the king was so incensed, as after that time he bent himselfe altogether to the diminishing and breaking of all immunities and liberties of the Church. And the Archbishop was so farre from séeking to pacifie the kings displeasure
                     •
                   as daily hee prouoked him more and more. The particularities thereof to passe ouer, the king thought good to try whether hée could put in execu
                     •
                  ion the contents of the aforesaid declaration euen in despite of the Archbishop or no. He offered the same vnto all the Cleargy gathered together in a synode; who as if they had learned all one less
                     •
                  n, told the king seuerally in the same wor
                     •
                  ds, that they were content to allow it saluo ordine suo, so farre foorth as they might without preiudice of their owne coat and calling: Onely one man Hilary Bishop of Chichester was content to yéelde vnto it simpliciter and without condition, but was so baited and reuiled for his labour, as it is like hee often repented it. Yet so the matter was handled not long after, as first diuers other Bishops were content to yéelde vnto the king in this demaund, and at last euen the Archbishop himselfe with all his followers. So at a time appointed they met

at Clarindon, and there sware vnto the obseruation of the articles comprised in that declaration. This notwithstanding, soone after againe they disliking that they had done, got the Pope to assoile them of this oath. The Archbishop then, the chiefe procurer of this absolution, well assuring himselfe hée had so offended the king, as there was no abiding for him here, tooke shippe at Rumney, intending to auoid the realme, but missed of his purpose
                     •
                   for he was forced by a contrary wind to returne to land againe. Presently vpon this arriuall hee was apprehended and carried prisoner to Northampton (where the King then held a Councel) and was there accused of extortion, periury, treason, forgery, and many other crimes. His owne suffragan Bishops, though hee had appealed vnto the Pope, gaue sentence against him, and warranted the king they would make proofe of these accusations vnto the Pope. The next night after his condemnation, hee scaped away and once more hasted vnto the sea, committed himselfe very desperately vnto a little bad rotten fisher boat, and, accompanied only with thrée seruitors, crossed the sea, and got into the low Countries, and thence posted to the Pope at Senon, who placed him in the monastery of Pontiniar. While he there rested himselfe, he thundred out excommunications apace against all such as did obserue the articles contained in the declaration set foorth at Clarindon, whereunto himselfe had once sworn. The King as fast be stird himselfe in seasing all the goods and temporalties of the Archbishop into his hand. He sent also ambassadors vnto the Earle of Flanders, the French King and the Pope, praying them in no wise to foster or suffer him in their dominions; requesting moreouer of the Pope, that hee would confirme and allow of the declaration published at Clarindon. The Pope made an answere (though friuolous) saying his would consider of the matter. But the French K. (with whom the King of England had amity and a league of friendship at that time) hée thinking that this disagréement betwéene him and the Archbishop would bréed some stir in England, presently fell to inuading the King of Englands dominions and tooke by assault certaine holds of his in Normandy. The Archbishop also about the same time sent out particular excommunications against all the suffragan Bishops of his Prouince. The

King mightily offended with this excéeding boldnesse of the Archbishop, whereunto he well knew hee was hartned and animated by the Pope and the French King: be thought himselfe how by all meanes possible hée might vexe and gréeue him; First, because he knew he delighted much in the monastery of Pontiniac (which was an Abbey of Cistercian monkes) he signified to all the monkes of that order in his dominions, that he would banish them euery one, if they would not procure the Archbishop to be thrust out of that monastery; which for feare of so great calamity to so many men was effected. Then he also droue out of the realme, all his kinsfolks, friends and professed welwillers of whom he suspected him to be any way aided or comforted. Alexander the Pope, Thomas Beckets surest card, was ferited in much like sort the same time by Friderike Barbarossa the Emperor. The King therefore by the counsell of Gilbert Bishop of London determined to fayne in league with the Emperor, (if possibly hee might) that was a professed enemie both to the French King and the Pope. To his purpose hée sent two ambassadors vnto him, perswading him to deale with the Cardinals (Lucius the Antip
                     •
                  pe being then lately dead) to set vp another in his roome, to whom he promised al his dominions should yéeld obedience. The Pope hauing notice of this practise, began presently to quaile, sent the King word he would order all things betwéene the Archbishop and him, to his owne liking, &amp; that out of hand. Now it had happened a little before, that the Pope had granted vnto the Archbishop a very large licence of excommunicating whom he list in England; the King, the Quéene, and a very few other excepted. This authority he abused very intemperately at that time when these matters were thus in hammering betwéene the Pope and the King; insomuch as he had marred all if the Pope had not spéedily yéelded a reason thereof to the King. By this time the French king (the Popes onely Protector against the Emperour) began to spy that hee was much more cold in the defence of the Archbishop th
                     •
                  n hee had béene, and reprehended him sharply for it. The Pope therfore not knowing which way to turne himselfe; for the satifying of both those Potentates, (neither of which he could safely offend as things stood) he determined first to labour a reconciliation

betwéene them, and thou to make the French King a mediator for the Archbishop. This he effected, and brought the two kings together at Paris. Thither also came Thomas Becket: And sute beeing made vnto the king in his behalfe, that hée might returne, bee restored to his goods and reuenues arising in the time of his absence, &amp; lastly (vpon his humble submission) to the kings fauour; The king answered, that for the rest he was contented; but (saith he) the profits of his Archbishopricke since his banishment I cannot allow him, for that I haue already giuen them to others: Mary recompence I will make him for them to the liking either of the French king, or the Senate of Paris, or else of the students of the Uniuersity. Presently the Archbishop was called for, who falling downe vpon his knées, vsed these words, My Lord and Soueraign, I do hée
                     •
                  re commit vnto your owne iudgement the cause and Controuersie betwéene vs, so far foorth as I may, sauing the honor of Almighty God. The king much offended with that last exception (Saluo honore Dei) turned him about vnto the French king, and telling him how much hee had done for the Archbishop, and how he had vsed him, I am (quoth be at last) so well acquainted with the tricks of this fellow, that I cannot hope for any good dealing at his hands. Sée you not how he goeth about to delude me with this clause (sauing the honor of God?) For whatsoeuer shall displease him, hee will by and by alleadge to be preiudiciall to the honour of almighty God. But this I will say vnto you, whereas there haue béene kings of England many before me, wherof some were perad
                     •
                  enture of greater power than I, the most part farre lesse; and againe many Archbishops before this man holy and notable men: Look what duety was euer performed by the greatest Archbishop that ouer was to the weakest and simplest of my predecessors, let him yéeld me but that and it shall aboundantly content me. Héereunto the Archbishop answered cunningly and stoutly enough, that the times were altered, his predecessors which could not bring all things to passe at the first dash, were content to beare with many things, and that as men they fell and omitted their duety oftentimes; that which the Church had gotten, was by the constancy of good Prelates, whose example he would follow thus farre foorth, as, though he could not augment

the priuiledges of the Church in his time, yet he would neuer consent they should be diminished. This answere being heard, all men cried shame vpon him, and generally imputed the fault of these stirs vnto him. But this was the issue for that time, that they parted without reconciliation. The king doubting what might come of these broiles, caused his sonne Henry (that died soone after) to be crowned King in his owne lifetime, so to assure him of the succession. Afterwards comming into France againe, they were vpon the point of reconciliation, when the casting out of some such worde or another as before, marred all. At length the King and he were made friends; but his full restitution referred till hee had behaued himselfe quietly a while at Canterbury, which hée promised to do. But hee, was so farre from perfourming that promise, as hee sent into England before him diuers excommunications which the Pope had granted out long before, and committed to his discretion. Amongst other, the Archbishop of Yorke, the Bishop of London and Salisbury were named in them, together with so many as had béene doers in the coronation of the yoong king, which the Archbishop saide might not bee performed of any but by his appointment. The men thus strucken with this holy fire, hasted them ouer into Normandy to make their complaint vnto the King; who infinitely gréeued at this kinde of dealing, cursed the time that euer hee made him Archbishop, or restored him to his place againe, adding, it was his chance euer to doe for vnthankefull men, otherwise some or other would longere this haue made this proud Priest an example to all such troublesome perturbers of his realme and state. It happened amongest other, fower knights to be present at this spéech of the Kings; who gathered thereby, they should doe a déed very acceptable vnto him if they killed the Archbishop. Their names were Reynald Fitz-Vrse, Hugh de Mortuill, William de Tracy, and Richard Briton. In this meane time the Archbishop was come to Canterbury, and was receiued there with great ioy. Thence he went to London, and so to Woodstocke, where the yoong King then lay. But before hée could get to the Kings presence, word was brought him, the kings pleasure was hée should first go to Canterbury, and reuoke those excommunications

before hee the king would talke with him. So hée returned againe to Canterbury without séeing the King at all. Soone after his returne thither, the fowre Knights before mentioned arriued at Canterbury, to wit, vpon Innocents day. They comming vnto the Archbishop, told him the kings pleasure was, he should goe to his sonne and reuerently make offer of doing homage and fealty vnto him, for the Barony of his Archbishopricke; secondly, that hee should cause all the strangers he brought into the realme with him to be sworn to his obedience; and thirdly, that he should retreat those excommunications which he had caused to be denounced against such as were the instruments of the yoong kings coronation. To those demands hee a
                     •
                  swered, that neither the King nor any other mortall man should extort from him, or any of his by his consent, any vniust or vnreasonable oath. And as for the Bishops and other excommunicate concerning the Coronation, it was indéede (quoth he) a thing done in my behalfe and for an iniury offered to my Church: But it was the act of the Pope. If therefore they will sweare they shall bee ready to make mee amends at the Popes discretion, I will absolue them; otherwise not. And whatsoeuer you say, it was the kings pleasure, I should take my best course for the redresse of this abuse by ecclesiasticall authority. Many other wordes passed betwéene them the same time, they breathing out terrible threats, and hee continuing still the same man without yéelding one iote. At last the knights departed, giuing the monkes charge in the kings name, to sée the Archbishop foorth comming, and not to suffer him to escape away. At euening praier time the same day, they came suddenly into the Church, with their swords drawne, crying, Wheres the Traytor, Wheres the Traytor? The Archbishop who was then going vp the stepps toward the quire, hearing the noyse, turned backe vnto them, and euery one of the fower striking mainely at him, vpon the third or fourth greice of those steps was slaine. His body these knights had determined to haue cast into the sea, or else to haue hewen into a thousand pieces: but the Prior and the monkes doubting some such thing, buried it immediately in the vndercraft, whence shortly it was taken vp and laid in a most sumptuous shrine in the East end

of the Church. The Pope hearing of this massacre, excommunicated immediatly all that were either authors or consenters to the same. The king was faine to purge himselfe by oath, and yet could not be absolued before hee had done certaine strange penance; as first, that he should pray deuoutly at the tombe of this new Martyr; that he should be whipt in the chapter house, receiuing of euery monke one lash; that hee should maintaine 200. souldiers for the space of one yéere of Ierusalem; and lastly, reuoke the declaration published at Clarindon, that originally gaue the occasion of this murther. All this (such were these times) the king was faine to performe.
            
            
               39. Richard.
               IN the moneth of February,1171 Hen. 2.18. following the death of Thomas Becket (which was December 28. 1170.) one Robert Abbot of Becco was chosen Archbishop. But hee liking better a quiet life, chose rather to sit still where hee was, th

                  n to aduenture himselfe in a place subiect to the blasts of such terrible tempests as Thomas Becket was tossed withall. The king then dealt earnestly with the Couent of Canterbury to choose some mild

They followed his direction, and elected one Richard, a Benedictine Monke Prior of the Monastery of Saint Martins in Douer, who was presently allowed of the king and the Pope, and soone after consecrate. He was a man very liberall, gentle and passing wise. So he handled the matter, that in all his time he neuer was out, either with the Pope or the king. The Pope he entertained with often gifts and money; the Kings fauour hee retained by yéelding and conforming himselfe to his pleasure. This man continued Archbishop about the space of to

The olde quarrell chaunced to bee renued betwéene these two Archbishops concerning the Primacy; and one Hugocio the Popes Legate comming into England, both of them requested him to heare and iudge this controuersie betwéene

them. Upon this and other occasions, a Conuocation was summoned at Westminster, where was a stately throne prouided for the Legate. At ye tune appointed the Legate came and took his place, and the Archbishop of Canterbury sate him downe next vnto the Legate vpon the right hand. After this in came Roger Archbishop of Yorke and would néedes haue displaced Canterbury to fit aboue him: that, when the other would not suffer, he sate downe in his lap. The other Bishops present amazed at this strange behauiour of the Archbishop of Yorke, cried out all vpon him, the Archbishop of Canterburies men by violence drew the other out of his ill chosen place, threw him down, tare his robes almost from his backe, trode vpon him, beat him, and vsed him so despitefully, as the Legat, whether for shame or for doubt what might happen to himself in such a tumult, got him out and went his way. The Archbishop of Yorke all ragged as he was, bloudy and dusty went to the King; who first was exceeding angry, but when he heard the truth, laughed merrily at it and said hee was well enough serued. Much adoo there was long after at Rome about this &amp; the old controuersie; the end whereof at last was, that much mony was spent and neither party euer a whit the néerer. The end of this man is thus reported, how that beeing a sléepe at his mannor of Wrotham, there séemed to come vnto him a certaine terrible personage demanding of him who he was? whereunto when for feare the Archbishop answered nothing, Thou art he (quoth the other) that hast destroyed the goods of the Church, and I will destroy thée from off the earth: This hauing said, hee vanished away. In the morning betime the Archbishop got him vp, and taking his iourney toward Rochester, related this fearefull vision vnto a friend of his by the way. He had no sooner told the tale, but he was taken sodenly with a great cold &amp; stifnesse in his limmes, so that they had much adoo to get him so farre as Halling a house belonging to the Bishop of Rochester.

                   often done by both, as (in that which I haue before deliuered) you may perceiue. The King destrous to haue some honest quiet man, dealt

                  rst with the Couent; praying them to make choice of such a one as he might haue cause to like, and after made the same request vnto the Bishops. The Monkes (though mooued thereto) would in no wise ioyne with the Bishops, but perceiuing the Bishops began indéede to set foot into the matter, appealed to Rome. Much adoo there was there about it the space of nine moneths. At last the Bishops got a mandate wherein the Monkes and they were commaunded to ioyne together. The day of election was appointed; but the Monkes for curst heart would not come vnto it. So the Bishops procéeded, and make choice of Baldwin Bishop of Worcester. This election the monkes laboured mightily to disanul; professing, that they liked the man elect very well, but they must not indure such a president. The king therefore (who fauoured Baldwin excéedingly) wrought so with the one party and the other, as the Monkes were content to elect him, vpon condition he would renounce all benefit of his former election, and the Bishops themselues would confesse the same to be void and of no effect. All this was done, and he receiued into quiet and peaceable possession of this Metropoliticall sée. This Baldwin being a poore mans sonne, and borne in Excester; was first a schoolemaster, then entred into orders; and was preferred to an Archdeaconry, which promotion hee voluntarily resigned, and intending to forsake the worlde, became a Cistercian or white Monke. Heuing liued in the space of one whole yeare, hée was made Abbot of Ford in Deuonshire. From thence he was called to the Bishopricke of Worcester, consecrate thereunto the yéere 1181. translated to Canterbury in the end of the yéere 1184. and solemnely installed there May 19. 1185. béeing the first white Monk that

euer was Archbishop. Giraldus Cambr. describeth the person of the man in this sort. He was of complexion somwhat swarthy, his countenance simple and like a plaine meaning man; but very comely, his stature indifferent, well made of bodie, but slender timbred. For his maners, hee was modest and sober, of such abstinence, as same durst neuer stamp any sinister report vpon him, of few words, flow to anger, and very studious from his very childhood. The onely fault he findeth with him is, that he was too remisse and gentle in his gouernment, saying that he was Monachus melior quam Abbas, Episcopus &amp; Archiepiscopus: for which cause the Pope in a certain letter gréeted him thus: Vrbanus seruus seruorum Dei, Monacho seruentissimo, Abbati calido, Episcopo repido, Archiepiscopo remisso, salutem, &amp;c. It is a wonder that a man of this temper and disposition should be so much troubled as hee was: With the King hée alwaies agréed very well: But betwéene the Monkes of Canterbury and him there was much and continuall debate. The occasion thereof was this. The King greatly misliking the insolency of the Monkes, thought to wrest from them the preheminence of choosing the Archbishop in time to come by this deuice. Hee gaue direction vnto Baldwyn their Archbishop, to beginne the foundation of a Colledge at Mackington now called Saint Stephens, béeing distant from Canterbury about halfe a mile.

The ende of this foundation was none other th

                  bstinate and altogether wedded to their owne wils) to other men, in whom the King and the rest of the Bishops (as being their patrones) might challenge an interest. For the better execution of this plot, it was ordained, that this Colledge

should bée dedicated vnto Saint Thomas; who was now growen so famous throughout the world, as euery man thought himselfe happy that could do any thing to his honor. In regard héereof they made no doubt, but the Pope would soone be intreated to take from Christ (vnto whose name the monastery of Canterbury was consecrate) all priuiledge of election, and to confer the same with many other vpon Saint Thomas that famous martyr. The matter was now veri

That notwithstanding, on went the worke: The Church partly built was solemnly consecrate, and diuers secular Priests (such Saint Thomas himselfe was) instituted and installed into their prebends; when the monks that neuer linne laying on load by requests, gifts &amp; al manner of importunate sute to disturbe this platforme, procured the Pope to set downe an order, that this corporation should be dissolued, the buildings thereof rased and made euen to the ground. Such were the times, the Popes pleasure was an ineuitable necessity; it must be, and was performed. It happened then soone after that Vrban the Pope died, who was a great protector of the monkes cause, Gregory the sight succéeded, a man with whom Baldwyn might do very much. He determined therefore once more to set on foot his former deuise, but in another place. Hée procured of the Bishop and Couent of Rochester, for exchange of other land, a certaine quantity of ground at Lambhith; where the Archbishops pa

Thither he caused to be brought by water all the prouision of stones, timber, &amp;c. that was intended to the building of the Colledge at Hackington, and began the foundation of a goodly Church there, which hee liued not to finish. King Richard the first to expiate the fault of his rebellion and disobedience vnto his father, determined to carry a great power into the holy land. Baldwyn would néeds attend him thither, and did so. By preaching, counsell, liberall almes, and continuall example of a most vertuous life, he did great good there, vntill

While his pall was retching at Rome, considering how odions Baldwyn had beene to his Monkes of Canterbury, for not beeing a Monke as themselues were and in a manner all his predecessors had beene; hee went to Merton and there prof

The King returning, made him presently Lord Chauncelour, chiefe Iustice of England, and high gouernour of all his dominions immediately vnder him. So that being already Archbishop and the Popes Legate, he wanted no authority that was possible to be laid vpon him. Neuer was there any Cleargy man either before or after him of so great power, neuer any man vsed his authority more moderately. Yet he was much blamed (and peraduenture not vnworthily) and no lesse enuied for taking so many offices vpon him.

Hereupon the Pope presently enioyned him, without farther delay to resigne all his temporall offices; which he (how loath soeuer) was saine to doo. As for the matter of the Chappell, after it had hung long in the Popes court, the parties grew to a composition; that vpon condition it were pulled downe, it should be lawfull for the Archbishop to build another vpon a new foundation, to endue the same with an hundred pound a yéere reuenues and no more, and lastly to place in the same twenty Canons or Probendaries.

Then well knowing how hainously the king would take this matter, he writ letters vnto him swéetned with many gentle entreaties, large prayses of the new Archbishop, and seasoned now and then with some touches of doubtfull threatning if he should oppose himselfe against that was then done. This notwithstanding, the king in great indignation, banished all the Monks of Canterbury, seased vpon their goods and lands, and forbad Stephen Langton entrance into the realme. The Pope hearing of this, sent his mandate vnto thrée Bishops, William of London, Eustach of Ely, and Mauger of Worcesters; wherin hee willed them first

to admonish and perswade the King to restore the Monkes to their goods and places, and to giue the Archbishop possession of his temporalities by a day; then if he refused so to do, to interdict the whole realme. They durst not but obey, and finding the king resolute in his determination, at the time appointed, they published the Popes interdiction; and as well foreseeing the great trouble to come, as the present danger, got them out of the land, together with Ioceline Bishoppe of Bathe, and Gyles of Hereford. The king immediately seased all their goods and temporalties into his hands, and moreouer banished all the friends and kinsfolke of these Bishops, that were likely to yeeld them any comfort or reliefe. During the time of this interdict, all seruice ceased throughout the Realme, except onely Baptisme of children, auricular confession, and the administration of the Sacrament vnto such as lay vpon the point of death. The Pope seeing this course preuailed not, procéeded to a particular excommunication of the king, and not long after, depriued him by sentence of all regal authority; a thing till that time in no age euer heard of. All this while the King estéemed the Popes sword blunt and vnable to wound him, till at last he perceiued the French King ready to take aduantage of this sentence, and prouiding busily to inuade his dominions. His owne people also began to fall from him, and to doubt whom i

                   conscience they ought rather to follow, their owne naturall Prince or a forrain intruder; a strange and monstrous ignorance. Séeing therfore no other remedy, he was faine to yéeld; receiued the Archbishop, restored the other Bishops, the Monks and all the rest banished, vnto their goods and reuenues; and moreouer was content to resigne his crowne into the Popes hands, &amp; vpon restitution, to assure him by his letters pattents a yéerly pension of a thousand marks. This done, he thought all troubles at an end, when the worst of all was yet behinde: For he bare himselfe so bolde vpon the Popes fauour (which he had bought déerely) as he doubted not to oppresse diuers of his nobility, with many and continuall wrongs reuoking al former grants of priuiledges at his pleasure, vpon this point that he had receiued his kingdome from the Pope absolutely, frée from all entanglement of any priuiledges deriued from

the same. Hereupon the Barons rebelled, the Archb. taking their part, and when they doubted least they should not make their party good against the King, the Pope stucke so close vnto him; they procured Lewis the French kings eldest sonne to inuade the realme. Him together with the Archbishop and all the Barons, the Pope excommunicated. This great hurly burly was appeased sodainely by the kings death, who died some say, of care and sorrow, some of surfet; and some say, hee was poysoned by a Monke. His sonne Henry a Prince of ten years old was receiued to the kingdom, Lewis forsaken, &amp; the Barons vpon promise of obedience vnto their king, absolued by the Popes Legate. Clergy men were debarred a while from their absolution that they might compound for the same, which they were glad to doe. All things being thus quieted, this our Archbishop called a Conuocation at Osuey, wherein many things were decreede, to be seene for the most part among the prouinciall constitutions. Th

                  ther came a certaine young man that shewing the marks of wounds in his handes, feet and side, professed himselfe to be no lesse man then Iesus Christ. He brought also two women with him, whereof one tooke vpon her to be our Lady, the other Mary Magdalen. This counterfeit Christ, for his labour was worthily crucified, and forced to resemble him in the manner of his death, whose life and person hee had preposterously imitated, and sought to resemble. Soone after, he translated the bones of S. Thomas Becket from the place where they were first buried in the vndercrost, into a goodly sumptuous shrine. This was done wonderfull solemnly, the King and greatest part of the nobility of all the Realme being present. During the time of this ceremony, all passengers from London to Canterbury were allowed horsemeat at the Archbishops charge, who also caused vessels of wine to runne continually in di

               WIthin a few dayes after the death of Stephen Langton,
                  1229. Hen. 3.14. the Monks with the Kings licence procéeded to election, and made choice of one Walter de Hempsham, one of their owne company, and presented him vnto the King, who by the aduice of di

                  ers Prelates refused to allow of him. Which notwithstanding, he got him to Rome, hoping by one meanes or other to obtaine the Popes confirmation. The King hauing notice of his intent, sent thither the Bishop of Chester, to signifie that hée was a man very vnlearned, and moreouer infamous for his life and conuersation, as namely, that he had gotten diuers children vpon a certain Nunne, that his father was hanged for theft, and that himselfe had deserued the like punishment, by taking the part of the rebellious Barons. All this would not stay the Pope from giuing him confirmation, vntill the Kings Ambassadors had promised him a tenth of all spirituall promotions in England, to aide him in his wars against the Emperour. That being assured him, hée straight way pronounced the election voide, and by reason of the insufficiency of the elect, the right of nomination to be deuolued vnto himselfe; by vertue of which title he tooke vpon him at the Kings request to name vnto that See, Richard the Chancellor of Lincolne. The Author of Polychronicon calleth him M. Richard of Wethershed, the great Deane of London. This Richard was a man very well

learned, wise, graue, well spoken, and of good report, stout in defending the rights and liberties of the Church; and (which is not altogether to be neglected) of a goodly personage, tall, straight, and well fauoured. He was consecrate at Canterbury by Henry Bishop of Rochester, in the presence of the king and many of the nobility, Iune 10. 1229. being the first Archbishoppe of 44. now hauing possessed that Sée, who bare the Christian name of one of his predecessors. A little while he enioyed that honour, to witte, two yéer

                  e. Hubert was a man greatly fauoured by the king, for his long faithfull seruice vnto his father and himselfe; namely, for defending the Castle of Douer against Lewis the Frenchman, he made him Earle of Kent, and chiefe Iustice of England. He had entred vpō these lands. The Archbishop first complained of the wrong vnto the king, &amp; finding no remedy at his hands, excommunicated all the authors of this iniury (the king onely excepted) and got him to Rome. The king vnderstanding thereof, dispatched messengers thither also to hinder his procéedings there what might bee. The Pope notwithstanding delighted much with the eloquence, grauity, and excellent behauiour of the Archbishop, granted presently all his demands. Little ioy had he of this victory: Being thrée dayes iourney in his way homewards, hee fell sicke at the towne of Saint Gemma, and there died in the Friery, where also he was buried. It is reported that soone after his buriall, certaine théeues brake open his toombe, and thought to haue robbed him of his mysterrings, &amp;c. wherein (according to the manner of those times) he was buried; but that they claue so fast vnto him, as by no deuice they coulde take them from him. Beliue it as you list. It shall not bee amisse also to note how that in the time of this Archbishop, a great number of Italians had possessed themselus of the best benefices of England; which being much spited at; certaine madde fellowes tooke vpon them by force to thresh out their corn euery where, and giue it away vnto the poore; as also, to

rob and spoile them of their money and other goods. It was done so openly, and so boldly, as it was manifest that some great men were at one end of that businesse. The Italians after that time were not so eager vpon English benefices.
            
            
               Saint Edmund.
               THe Monkes of Canterbury by this time weary of contending with the King,1234. Hen. 3.19. soone after the death of the former Archbishoppe, chose of their owne accord Ralph Neuill Bishoppe of Chichester, and Chancellor of England; a man very wise and highly in fauour with the King, who liking well of this election, put him in possession of the temporalties by and by. The Pope being requested for his approbatation, chanced to enquire of Simon Langton Archdeacon of Canterbury brother vnto Stephen the late Archbishoppe, what maner of man this Ralfe Neuill should be, who told him that he was a hote fellow, stout, subtle, an old courtier, &amp; very gracious with the king; it was much to be doubted, therefore he would set the King and him together by the eares, &amp; cause him to deny the payment of that tribute granted vnto him by King Iohn. This was inough; without more adoo he willed the monks to choose another, neuer alleadging any matter of exception against him. So to a second election they procéeded, and chose one Iohn their Subprior: He went to Rome, and being examined by certaine Cardinals, was adiudged fitte inough for the place; yet the Pope misliked him for his age, and perswaded the good old man to forbeare to take vpon him so great a charge in his olde years. Hée yéelded; and therupon a third was elected, one Richard Blundy a student of Oxford. Him also the Pope refused, because for sooth he held two benefices contrary to the Canons, and because it was knowne he had borrowed a great summe of money of Peter Bishop of Winchester, wherewith it was thought he fedde well the Monks that chose him. The Pope then made request vnto such of the Monks as were at Rome, to chose Edmund Treasurer of Salisbury, a man very well known, and indéed famous for his vertue and great learning. They neither

durst deny the Popes request, nor would doo any thing in the matter, till they had vnderstoode the pleasure of their Prince, and conferred with the rest o

                   their brethren. He was content to take their silence for a sufficient election, &amp; without more adoo sent him the pall into England, little thinking of any such matter. Both the King and the Couent liking wel inough of the man, he was consecrate at Canterbury by Roger Bishop of London, April 2. 1234. He was borne (as some say) at London, and baptized in the same font Thomas Becket his predecessor had beene. But, other affirme more probably that he was borne at Abingdon in Bar

In their elder yeeres they forsooke each other by mutuall consent, and betooke themselues to a Monastical life. Edmund their sonne they caused to be brought vp in University Colledge at Oxford. Hauing attained vnto reasonable perfection in the knowledge of Diuinity (whereunto his study was chiefely directed) hee applyed himselfe to preaching, wherein hée tooke great paines; namely in the Counties of Oxford, Glocester, and Worcester, vntill such time as he was called to the Treasurership of Salisbury. Being consecrate Archbishoppe, hée presently fell into the Kinges displeasure, by opposing himselfe against the marriage of Elianor the kings sister with Simon Mountfort Earle of Leicester, because vpon the death of the Earle Marshall her first husband she had vowed chastity. To haue this vow dispensed withall, the king procured the Pope to send a Legate into England: his name was Otto a Cardinall. Him also this Archbishop offended; and that so grieuously, by reprehending his monstrous couetousnesse, his bribery and extortion, as euer after he sought to worke him all the mischiefe hée might. The Monkes of Rochester had presented vnto him the (Archbishoppe) one Richard de Wendouer, demaunding of him consecration vnto the Bishopricke of their Church; which he vtterly denied to affoorde, knowing the presented to bée a very vnlearned, and vnsufficient man. Hereupon the Monks appealed to Rome; which the Archbishoppe vnderstanding of, hasted him thither also. O

Being at Rome he had complained of many great abuses in England; and amongst the rest, of the long vac

The Pope seemed willing to redresse these things; and namely concerning that matter, set downe this order, that if any Cathedrall Church continued voide aboue sixe monethes, it should be lawfull for the Archbishop to conferre it where he list, as well as any smaller Benefice. The procuring of this order cost him a great summe of mony: Yet no sooner was his backe turned, but the Pope at the Kings request reuoked the same. Béeing thus continually vexed; thwarted and disgraced, he departed into voluntary exile; and there bewayling the misery of his country, spoiled and wasted by the tyranny of the Pope, spent the rest of his life in continuall teares. Through extreame griefe and sorrow, or (as some thinke) too much fasting, he fell first into a consumption, and after into a strange kinde of ague. Whereupon he thought good to remoue from the Abbey of Pontiniac in France, (where hée had layen euer since his comming out of England) vnto Soissy, and there departed this li

Within sixe yeeres after his death he was canonized a Saint by Innocentius, the fourth, who appointed the foresaide day of his death for euer to be kept holy in memory of him. Lewes the French King caused his body to bee translated to a more honourable place then it was first laide in, and bestowed a sumptuous shrine vpon him, couered with golde and siluer, and richly adorned with many precious stones.

                  1244 Hen. 3.19.THe Monks of Canterbury at the instance of the King elected then vnto the Archbishopricke, Boniface, the son of Peter Earle of Sauoy, and vncle vnto the Quéene: a man not greatly to bee commended

The King therefore doubting least the Pope would reiect him, caused in a manner all the Bishops &amp; Abbots of England to write their letters commendatory in his behalfe; and so sent him to Lyons, where he quickly obtained consecration at the Popes owne hands. At his first entrance into this Sée, he found the same indebted by the ouerlashing of his predecessors, to the value of 22. tho

By the same pretence also hee induced the Pope to graunt him in Commendam the Bishopricke of Ualentia in Prouence, and diuers other spirituall promotions. But he gaue himselfe to warring, and spent all hee could make in hyring of Souldiers. When therefore (notwithstanding all these helpes) the debt was little or no

The king a while spurned at this grant; but in the end halfe for feare of the Pope (of whom hee stoode in great awe) and partly by sute and intercession, he ratified &amp; allowed of the same. Hauing béene many yéeres absent, he returned into England, the yéere 1250. &amp; tooke vpon him to visite all his Prouince in some extraordinary manner.

Comming then to London, hée tooke a small occasion to deface the Bishoppe there with fowle and reproachfull spéeches; and being resisted by the Deane and Chapter of Paules (who had appealed from his Uisitation to the Pope) he made no more adoo but excommunicated them euery one. Going the next day about the same busines to the Priory of Saint Bartholomewes in Smithfield, hée was met very honourably by the Supprior and all the Couent in their coapes. Telling them by and by he came to visite them, one of the company answered him reuerently, hee was very welcome vnto them, but they were sorry hée came for that purpose, wherein they must disappoint him: They knew their Bishop (whose onely office it was) to bee a very sufficient man for his place, and so long they must not entertaine the Uisitation of any other.

By this time the Londoners were vp, &amp; taking the matter very hainously in the behalfe of their Bishop, whome this iniury did originally concern (as they thought) laid such wait for the Archbishop, as with much adoo he stole secretly to the Thames side, &amp; was conueied by a wherry prouided for him to Lambhith. If they could haue met with him, they had

surely hewen all to péeces. Hee was no sooner come home, but he thundered out his excommunications against not onely the whole Couent of Saint Bartholomew, but the Bishop of London also, as a fauourer of theirs. They all agreeing together, determined to send the Deane of Paules a graue and wise man to Rome, and by the letters of certaine Bishops (they knew the Pope would credite) to aduertise him of this strange disorder. The Archbishop vnderstanding hereof, followed thither apace, and entred Rome with great pompe; nothing doubting, but the King and Quéens letters which he had brought, his nobility and great lineage, or if all failed, his purse should beare him out in this matter well inough. But vnderstanding how odiously it was taken by all that heard it, and how hardly the Pope was informed against him; hee fell to entreaty of his aduersaries, the Deane of Paules and the rest, whom partly by faire promises, and partly by threates, at last he subdued and made them content to stay their complaint. That matter being so ended, he dealt earnestly with the Pope to ratifie the dooings of his Uisitation. The Bishops of his prouince vnderstanding thereof, &amp; knowing how great an inconuenience it would bee to them, and all their Clergy, they made a collection of two pence in the marke out of all spirituall promotions in the Prouince to be expended in sute of Law against the Archbishop. In the meane time the King had written his letters earnestly to the Pope in the Archbishops behalfe, which so inchanted him with partiality, as the Bishop of London vtterly despairing of any iustice, gaue ouer the matter in the plaine field: Onely thus much was obtained, that he, the Chapter of Paules, and the Couent of Saint Bartholomewes should be absolued frō their excommunication. Soone after this it hapned that the Archbishop, (the olde malice still boyling in his breast) taking a small aduantage, excommunicated againe the Deane and Chapter of Paules; the indignity whereof so moued all the Cleargy, as they tooke order to meete at Dunstable, and there laying their purses together, gathered the sum of foure thousand Marks, which they determined to bribe the Pope withall so he would deliuer them from the misery of this vnreasonable kinde of Uisitation. The Pope tooke their money

and promised them faire: And the Archbishoppe séeing no remedy but hee must Clauum clauo pellere, by taking the same course, féede him as well on the other side. Hee whose affection was euer wonte to bée measured according to his rewards, so diuided his fauour, as hée tooke not away from the Archbishoppe all authority of visiting; and yet so moderated the same with circumstances, as it was like to proue to

                   wherein he dealt at the first somewhat mildely, but soone falling to his ollde bias, caused euery where such stirs and tumults, as it was long after called by the name of the troublous Uisitation. At Lincolne hee fell out with the Chapter there (the Sée then being voide) about the gift of prebends and benefices which he challenged, &amp; had euer heretofore in the vacācy belonged vnto them. One William Lupus Archdeacon of Lincolne especially resisted him in this matter, and appealed vnto the Pope. This poore man he so vexed and hurried with his excommunications, and all manner of molestation hee could deuise, as at last he enforced him to hide himselfe, and to steale secretly to Rome; where he was so pittied, as the Pope was entreated not only to absolue him, but to protect him from the violence of Boniface, &amp; at last to iudge the controuersie of his side. So homewards hee got him with assured hope of restoring his church to her ancient priuiledge. But béeing worne out with continuall trauell and vexation which he had indured thrée yeers vpon the way he died. Now while he was abroad in the rest of his prouince, his Monks of Christ Church in Canterbury had procured of the Pope a Charter of immunity from all visitation.

money hée had scraped together in the same, hired a great number of Souldiers to rescue his brother Thomas, somtime Earle of Sauoy, that was kept in prison by the Citizens of Taurinum, who could not endure his tyranny. In this war he had the Popes Buls and excommunications at commandement to assist him: of which, hauing spent a great many, all his money, and no small number of his souldiers to no purpose, with shame and sorrow for his losse and disgrace, home he came. Toward the latter end of his time hee waxed more moderate, and applyed himselfe in some reasonable sort to the gouernment of his Church. The realm being filled with strā
                  gers of the kings blood by his mothers side, and their attendants, that still snatcht vp all places of preferment, especially ecclesiasticall: hee was content to ioyne with the rest of the Bishops in a request to the king, wherein hee besought him to haue some regard of his owne countrymen, among whom he might finde choice inough of wise, vertuous and learned then. The King taking this spéech of his in very euill parte, tolde him he was content to do as he wished him, and because saith hee, it is indéede great reason that I should fauour worthy men of my owne nation before any vnworthy stranger.

By this and diuers other manifest tokens perceiuing the kings mind to be alienated from him, and knowing himselfe very ill beloued of al the Commons &amp; Clergy in generall, waxing weary of England, he felled his woods, let leases, forced from his tenants and others what money he could possibly; &amp; hauing gathered great summes by one meanes or other, carried it all with him into Sauoy, whence he neuer meant to returne againe. He liued not long after his arriuall there, but deceased in the castle of Saint Helen, Iuly 18. 1270. after his first consecration, 26. yéeres, sixe monethes and sixteene dayes, and from the time of his first election nine and twenty yéeres.

in. He built a goodly Hospitall at Maidstone called the New works, and indued it with reuenues, vallued at the suppression in 159. l. 7. s. 10. d. (William Courtney long after translated the same into a Colledge of secular Priests.) And lastly, he finished that most stately hall at Canterbury with the buildings adioyning, which had onely béene begun by Hubert, and little or nothing continued by them that followed, but by him at last was throughly perfited.
            
            
               47. Robert Kilwardby.
               SOone after the death of Boniface,
                  1272 Hen. 3.56. the Couent of Canterbury by the license of the King, elected William Chillinden their Supprior to succéede him. The Pope tooke exceptions against him as an vnsufficient man for the place, &amp; ex plenitudine potestatis, thrust into the same one Robert Kilwardby. This Robert was a great Clarke, and left in writing behinde him many monuments of his learning; beeing an Englishman borne, but brought vp first in Oxford, and then afterwards in Paris; whence after hee had procéeded there Master of Arts, he returned, and became first a Frier Minor, and then Prouinciall of that order here. The monks that many times opposed themselues against their kings and lawfull Princes, durst not resist this intruder of the Popes sending; but to preserue their right of election, were content forsooth to choose him the Pope had before appointed them. He was consecrate February 26. 1272. béeing the first sunday in Lent, at what time the Prior of Canterbury demanded of him the summe of 3000. markes spent in the election of William Chillinden, which the Pope promised the next Archbishop should repay. But hée loath to disburse this money, began to picke holes in the Priors coate, and threatening to depriue him of his place, neuer linnd si

                  ting of him, till hee had intreated his Couent to abate 1300. of the 3000. Marks. In the first yéere of his consecration, hee renued the Statutes made by his Predecessors for his court of the Arches, and contracted them briefly into fiue Articles. Then shortly after he visited all his Prouince, and both the Uniuersities; in which he disputed excellently, and shewed

himselfe in diuers kinds of exercise. Toward the latter end of his time, he made a collection for the building of a Monastery for the Frier Minors in London. Men contributed so largely thereunto, (and he had the helpe of a certaine olde Tower which yéelded him stones without charge) as he finished the same with other mens mony, and was able to affoord the foundation for an other at Salisbury, as I finde deliuered: but that was for blacke Fryers. Hauing béene Archbishop about the space of sixe yéeres, hee was sent for to Rome by Pope Nicholas the third, and made Cardinall of Hostia, &amp; Bishop of Portua. He resigned then his Archbishopricke, &amp; getting him into Italy, within a few moneths after fell sick
                     •
                   and died (of poyson some say) at Uiterbium, where also he was buried.

                     •
                   But the Pope who had therfore promoted Robert Kilwardby, that he might place another in his room, such a one as he wold be sure should serue his turne at all times, perceiuing himselfe preuented in the election; thrust in ex plenitudine potestatis, in like sort as last time he had done, Iohn Peckham another Frier. Hée was borne of meane parentage in Sussex, spent his childhood in the Abbey of Lewes, was brought vp in Oxford (where he became a Frier) and succeeded Robert Kilwardby in the office of Prouinciall of their order. From Oxford he went to Paris to study Diuinity, and after a while to Lyons to get some knowledge in the Canon law; without the which, Diuinity was estéemed vnperfect in those daies. At Lyons he was chosen Canon or Prebendary of the Cathedrall Church; and by that meanes being furnished with allowance to trauell
                     •
                   for his encrease of his knowledge in the Canon law, hee went into Italy, &amp; visiting personally all the Uniuersities of Italy, came lastly to Rome. His rare learning being soon perceiued there, he was made by the Pope Auditor or chiefe Iudge of

his Pallace, and so continued till his preferment to Canterbury. He was consecrate the first Sunday in Lent, which fell vpon the sixt day of March 1278. Soone after his arriuall in England the Pope his Creator (as he called him) sent vnto him a mandate of making payment of 4000. markes vpon very short warning, or else assured him to bee spéedily excommunicate. It shall not bee amisse to set downe the wordes of his answere to this demaund; Ecce me creastis saith he, &amp;c. Behold you haue created me: And if the Creature cannot but desire naturally what perfection the Creator can yéeld, how can I but 
                     •
                  esort vnto you for succour in all my oppressions and calamities? I receiued of late certaine letters horrible to sée, and fearefull to heare, denouncing, that except I make payment of 4000. marks that I became indebted vnto certaine Merchants of Luca at Rome within the space of a moneth after Michaelmas next, I was to be excommunicate with bell, booke, and candle, and that excommunication to bee published in my Church, &amp;c. Then (to make short) hee declareth how his predecessour at his departure carried away all the mooueable goods belonging to the Sée, that Boniface had left all his houses very ruinous, that the King had taken vp before hand, one yéeres profite of his lands, that in the meane space hée was faine himselfe to liue vpon credit; and that to borrow to serue his necessary vses (the realme being so exhaust with continuall payments) it was excéeding hard. In regard héereof, hée besought him (whom onely in trueth the matter concerned, though merchants of Luca bore the name of this debt) to order the matter so, as he might bée allowed a yéeres day of paiment, which at last with much adoo was granted him by the sute of Robert Kilwardby his predecessor, who died (as before is rehearsed) soone after. The new Archbishop then became a suter vnto the Pope, that hee would cause to be restored vnto his Church fiue thousand markes; the value whereof, the said Robert had carried away with him of the goods belonging to his Sée. This he was so farre from obtaining, as by and by the Pope began to call vpon him againe very hastily for the 
                     •
                  ower thousand marks aboue mentioned, and so made him glad to holde his peace for that time, and yet to pay the money at his day. In the first yéere of his

consecratlon he sommoned a Conuocation at Lambhith, at what time the Archbishop of Yorke comming to London, caused his crosse to bee borne before him within the Prouince of Canterbury, which the Archbishop of Canterbury tooke to bée a great wrong vnto him &amp; his Sée. It had béene often in question héeretofore whether it might be done or no, and much adoo there had bin about it: therfore to redresse this abuse quickly &amp; good cheape, our Frier deuised this course to be taken. Hée caused proclamations to be made in all places where he vnderstood the other Archbishop meant to passe, in wt he commanded all men vnder paine of excommunication to afford no manner of intertainement, no not so much as bread, or drinke, vnto him or any of his company, so long as hee bare vp his crosse in that manner. So except he and his traine should starue, down must the Crosse there was no remedy. The Conuocation ended, he began a generall visitation of his whole prouince; and being destrous to know the state of euery Dioces, went himselfe in person to most of them, vsing great lenity and gentlenes euery where. For he was a man though very stately both in his gesture, gate, words, and all outward shew; yet of an exceeding méeke, facile and liberall mind: He took great paines in labouring a peace betwéene Edward the first, and Leolin prince of Wales; vnto whom hee went in person, and trauailed long with him, but altogether in vaine. Hee bare a very hard hand vpon the Iews, whose Sinagogues he commanded to be pulled downe to the ground throughout his Prouince. But the King was a meanes to stay the execution of that commandement so far foorth, as he would haue one Church allowed vnto them, in the city in wt with certain restraints they should practise their ceremonies. Unto double beneficed men &amp; non residents he was very hard. Diuers elected vnto Bishopricks hée reiected, hauing no other exception against them. Many hée compelled to reforme themselues according to the Canons in that behalfe; and some that refused to be conformable, he finally depriued. Adultery he was woont to punish very seuerely. Hée persecuted a Bishop terribly (his name is not deliuered) for keeping a Concubine. One Roger Ham a Priest, hée enioyned to three yéeres penance for fornication, requiring him to spend all that time in fasting, prayer, and pilgrimages to Rome,

Compostella, and Colon, and moreouer sequestred the fruits of his benefice during those thrée yéeres, appointing them to be giuen vnto the poore. Neither dealt hee thus with men of his owne coat onely. There was a certaine knight of Wiltshire called Sir Osborne Gifford; He had stollen two Nuns out of the Nunry of Wilton: which comming to the Archbishops eares, hee first excommunicated him, and after absolued vpon these conditions; first that hee should neuer after come within any Nunry, or in the company of a Nunne; then, that 3. Sundaies together hee should be whipped in the parish Church of Wilton, so likewise in the market and Church of Shaftsbury thrée other daies; that he should fast a certaine number of moneths, that he should not weare an shirt in thrée years; &amp; lastly, that he should not any more take vpon him the habite or title of a knight, but weare apparell of a russet colour, vntill hee had spent thrée yeares in the holy land. All this hee sware should be performed before he might haue absolution. If some of our Gentlemen were now and then thus serued, they would not be so wanton as they are. Thirtéene yéeres and almost a halfe this man continued Archbishop, holding all this while his prebend he had first at Lyons, which when diuers begged of him, he would answere, that hee might not in any wise spare it; for he looked euery day when being drouen out of England by the King (against whom indéed he often very boldly opposed himselfe) hee should haue no other home to take to. For the same cause belike, it was annexed vnto the Sée of Canterbury. Many succéeding Archbishops enioyed the same a long time after. He died very rich, and yet in his life time, founded at Wingham a Colledge valued when it was suppressed at 
                     •
                  ower score &amp; foure pounds of yéerly reuenues, and aduanced diuers of his kinred to great possessions, whose posterity haue continued in the state of Knights and Esquires euen vntill our time. Hée was buried in his owne Church, but in what particular place I finde not.
            
            
               
               49. Robert Winchelsey.
               
                  1294. Edw. 1.23.WHat countriman Robert Winchelsey should bee, no man deliuereth: But it is certaine hee first went to schoole at Canterbury, where hee was so admired for his towardlinesse, and loued for his gentle and modest behauiour (beeing also a very welfauoured childe) as many would take vpon them, euen then to prophecie that he should one day bée Archbishop of Canterbury. Being ripe for the Uniuersity, he was sent first to Merton Colledge in Oxford, then to Paris. There hee proceeded Master of art, and before his departure thence was chosen Rector of that Uniuersity. Hauing passed through that office (which séemeth to bee annuall) with great commendation of integrity and wisdome, hee returned into England; and comming to Oxford, gaue such proofe there of his extellent knowledge in all good learning by preaching, disputing, &amp;c. as they thought good to honour him with the degrée of a Doctor, and shortly after made him Chancellor of their Uniuersity. His gouernment there was such, as all men easily discerned him fit for a much higher place. Hee made many good and profitable statutes, and tooke away diuers fond and pernicious customes; to the great honor of the Uniuersity, and no lesse aduancement of good learning. His first spirituall promotion was a Prebend in Pauls Church and the Archdeaconry of Essex. His Archdeaconry he visited himselfe in person duely euery yéere, and did reside vpon his Prebend, preaching in that Cathedrall Church or some other place almost euery day. By reason héereof and his manifold good parts, hée grew so famous, as Peckham being dead, hee was straightway pointed out by the expectation of all men vnto the Archbishopricke. The monks therefore those him with the Kings very good liking and great applause of all men. It was his chance to come to Rome while Coelestinus was Pope, a good and vertuous man; but so simple, as Boniface that succéeded him could perswade him by counterfeiting the voice of an Angell through a trunke in the night, to resigne his Papacy and become an Heremit again, as before his election he had béene. Not onely this simple Heremite, but euen all the prelates

and Cardinals there, were amazed at his wonderfull rare learning, the like whereof (especially to bée ioyned with such discretion and wisedome) they well assured themselues was no where to be found. They were desirous therefore to haue made him a Cardinall, so to haue retained him amongest them: But he yéelding many reasons why hée might not bée spared at home, obtained at last consecration and hasted him vnto his charge. Upon the day of his inthronization, it is saide hée consecrated Bishop of Landaffe one Iohn Monemouth Doctor of Diuinity, and bestowed twenty benefices, ten of very good value vpon ten Doctors, and ten lesse vpon tenne Bachelers of Diuinity. The See being yet voide the king had caused a Conuocation to be summoned, in which hee required the one halfe of all Ecclesiasticall reuenues for one yéere toward the charge of his wars. This intollerable exaction the Cleargy not intending to yéeld vnto, sent the Deane of Paules William de Monfort with diuers other prelates vnto the King to craue pardon, and to shew how hard it were for them to yéeld to this demand. Being admitted vnto his presence, the Deane began his spéech, and after a few wordes fell downe suddenly starke dead. Herewith the king nothing mooued, sent a knight the next day vnto the Conuocation to know whether any of them durst withstand the King in this demand: if there bee any such (quoth hee) let him come foorth, that I may take order with him as a disturber of the Kings peace. So no man daring to gainesay it, the graunt passed for good. The Archbishop now comming home soone after, called another Synode, wherein his Cleargy complained much of the last exaction. The Archbishop told them it was more then they could iustifie that they had done, for that in the late Councell of Lyons it was decréede, no Cleargy man should pay any thing to any temporall magistrate without the Popes license: that therefore they now set downe for a canon to be kept héereafter inuiolably. At that time the King that had had so liberall allowance very lately, demaunded nothing. But within a yéere or two after hauing spent an infinite deale of money in the conquest of Scotland, he summoned a Parliament at Berwicke; wherein when the Temporalty contributed liberally toward the charge of that warre,

the Cleargy alleaging the aforesaid Canon, would grant no thing. The king would not take this for payment: And therefore presently hee tooke order, that all barnes of Cleargy men should bee locked vp: hée also made proclamation that from that time forward, all Cleargy men were excluded for vnder his protection, so that héereafter it should be lawful for any man to sue them, but they might not commence sute against any other. This constrained them to yéeld, and all submitted themselues to allowance of such a proportion as the King liked (it was a fist part of their reuenewes) except onely the Archbishop who would make no other answere vnto the king but this: Under God our vniuersall Lord, saith hee, wée haue two other Lords, a spirituall Lord the Pope, and a temporall Lord the king; and though we bee to obey both, yet rather the spirituall Lorde then the temporall. When therefore hee saw all the rest inclined to yéelde, vsing no other words then this, Saluet vnusquisque animam suam, hee rose vp and suddenly departed. For this contumacy the king caused all his goods to be seased into his hands, and made shew of greater displeasure. Shortly after, notwithstanding beeing to make warre in France, before his departure he thought good to receiue the Archbishop to fauour againe; but this his grace indured for a very little while. Presently vpon his returne, hée laide diuers treasons to his charge, as that he had dehorted his subiects in his absence from payment of their subsidies, that hee had conspired with diuers of his nobility to depriue him of his kingdome, and to crowne his sonne Edward, &amp;c. Whether the Archbishop were guilty of all the crimes obiected against him or no, I cannot tell. But certaine it is, that as guilty, he submitted himselfe to the kings mercy, and besought him for the same in most humble manner, or rather indéede deiected himselfe more basely, and lamented his case more passionately then became a man that were guiltlesse; much lesse a prelate that would be estéemed, graue, learned or wise. Notwithstanding this his submission, the King commenced a complaint against him at Rome, banished him the Realme, and seased vpon all his goods, mooueable and vnmooueable, forbidding all his subiects vpon great paine to foster him or yeeld him any manner of intertainement. Hee was in that case

hee must haue starued for want of sustenance, had not the monkes of Canterbury secretly taken him in and aduentured to yeeld him things necessary, till they found meanes to shift him beyond sea; which the King afterwards vnderstanding, seased vpon all their goods and lands, turned them all euen fowre score monkes a begging, forbad all men to harbour them, and kept them in that miserable state, till after a certaine space hee was content to restore them againe. These were the violent courses were taken by Princes in those daies: how happy are we that in all peace, liberty and assurance quietly enioy our owne, without great desert to the contrary? Two yéeres the Archbishop contin

                  ed in exile: In which time the king (Edward the first) died, and his sonne Edward the second that was to succéede, thinking it conuenient belike at his first entrance to shew all examples of Clemency, called him home by letters, and restored him to all his goods, euen euery peny of that which had béene receiued of his temporalties in his absence. Héereby it came to passe that he was the richest Archbishop of many that were, either before or after him; so that his trouble turned him to great good. In regard whereof, he was wont to say (Nihil nocebit aduersitas vbi nulla iniquitas dominatur) so often as he talked of his trouble and banishment. Hee was no sooner come home but a new danger encountred him, occasioned by his owne wonted boldnesse. The yong King by the counsell of Piers Gaueston (a wanton and vicious man, banished into Ireland by king Edward the first for corrupting his sonne) had committed the Bishop of Couentry to ward at Yorke: A conuocation beeing gathered, the Archbishop would not suffer any matter to bee debated in the house till the Bishop were set at liberty. This the king was content to beare withall at that time: &amp; afterward he so behaued himselfe, as there neuer grew any dislike betwéene them. So the rest of his age after his returne from banishment (which was sixe yéeres) hée passed in quietnesse, and great prosperity, and died at last at Otforde, May 11.13

                     •
                  nisher of sinne. He opposed himselfe against Piers Gaueston, the Spensers, and other corrupters of the young King very boldly,

He enforced Iohn Warren Earle of Surrey to forsweare the company of a certaine beautifull harlot, with the loue of whom hee was greatly bewitched. And afterwards when notwithstanding his oath he returned to her company againe and got children vpon her, he accused him to the Conuocation of adultery and periury both, and at last made him to leaue her. Such preferments as fell to his disposition, he euer bestowed vpon men of excellent learning; despising letters and requests of noble men, which he estéemed not a rush. Many poore schollars hee maintained at the Universities with liberall exhibition, and vnto all kinde of poore people was excéeding bountiful, insomuch as therein I thinke he excelled al the Archbishops that euer were, either before him or after him. Beside the daily fragments of his house, he gaue euery Friday and Sunday vnto euery begger that came to his doore a loafe of breade of a farthing price (which no doubt was bigger then our penny loafe now.) And there were vsually euery such almes day in time of dearth to the number of 5000. but in a plentifull 4000. and seldome or neuer vnder, which communibus annis amounted vnto 500. pound a yéere. Ouer and aboue this he vsed to giue euery great festiuall day 150. pence to so many poore people, to send daily meate, drinke and bread vnto such as by reason of age or sicknes were not able to fetch almes at his gate, and to send money, meate, apparell &amp;c. to such as he thought wanted the same, and were ashamed to beg. But of all other, hee was wont to take greatest compassion vpon those that by any misfortune were decaied and had fallen from wealth to poore estate. For these and other vertues, the common people would néedes estéeme him a Saint, and frequensed much the place of his burial: Therefore his tombe (which was situate beside the altar of S. Gregory néere the south wal) was afterwards pulled downe. His bookes, apparell, and other mooueables (which were but of very small value) he gaue all (such as they were) vnto his church of Canterbury.

                        •
                     . the monkes of Canterbury elected for his successor, one Thomas Cobham that was Deane of Salisbury, and Prebendary of Yorke
                     •
                   a man of such vertue and learning, as he was commonly called by the name of the good Clerke. The king (Edward the second) was destrous to preferre vnto that place Walter Reynolds Bishop of Worcester; whom hee fauoured singularly for the opinion he had of his assured fidelity and great wisedome. Before therefore that the said Thomas Cobham could get away to Rome, the king vnderstanding of his election, sent thither in all post hast, earnestly requesting the Pope to find meanes that this Walter might be made Archbishop. He glad of such an occasion to exercise the vtmost of his vsurped authority, without any more adoo, thrust in the saide Walter Reynolds into that Sée, pretending, that hee had reserued the gift of the Archbishopricke for that time vnto himselfe before it fel. Cobham a while stood vpon the right of his election; but perceauing to how little purpose it was to stirre with so mighty aduersaries as the Pope and the king both at once, was content to accept of the Bishopricke of Worcester which the other left. This Walter had béene a Courtier a long time, Chapleyne first vnto Edward the first, and Parson of Wimberton, then by Edward the second (whose Schoolemaster some say hée was) made Treasurer and Chancelour of England, and preferred to the Bishopricke of Worcester the yéere 1308. The buls of his translation were pubished in Bowe Church Ianuary 4. 1313. He receiued his pall February 17. following. and was installed with great pompe and solemnity Aprill 19. in the presence of the king the Quéene and many Nobles. The first thing he did after his comming to Canterbury was to take order by giuing pensions and diuers summes of money at Rome, that appeales made from him to the Court there should find no fauourable intertainment. Hée procured also eight seuerall Buls, containing so many great and extraordinary priuiledges. The first gaue him authority of visiting all his prouince, so as hee should haue procurations euery where,

and yet his charges borne; The second, to visite monasteri
                     •
                  , and all other exempt places; The third, to absolue and restore to their former state two hundred Cleargy men that had incurred irregularity; The fourth, to dispense with the Minoritie of a hundred Clearks, and enable them to take spirituall liuings; The fifth, to absolue a hundred of such as by striking any Cleargy man had fallen into the danger of excommunication; The sixth to grant for
                     •
                  y pluralities; The seuenth, to require the gift of any one dignity or spiritual promotion in any Church or Colledge where he should visite; The eighth, to grant pardon of a hundred daies in any place where hee should visite, preach, giue almes, or kéepe hospitality. Béeing thus armed, hee performed his visitation; trauelling himselfe in the same till by the Barons wars hee was hindered, and sent for vnto the Court by the king. That warre beeing ended, and execution done vpon diuers of the nobles that had rebelled: Adam Tarlton Bishop of Hereford was apprehended &amp; brought to the barre to be arraigned for the like fault. All the Bishops of England almost were then at London. The Archbishops of Canterbury, Yorke, and Dublin hearing of it, in great hast hied them thither, and hauing their crosses borne before them, entred the court, by violence tooke the prisoner from the barre; and carried him away with them. Much adoo there was about this matter a good while: and the stirre was not quite ended when the Queene rising against her husband, and setting vp her sonne to challenge the kingdome, at last procured him to be deposed. This our Archbishop then shewed himselfe a very weake man: He was content a while outwardly to stand with the King (as beside the common duty of a subiect, he was bound to doe by benefits receiued infinite) but first vnderhand hee aided the Quéene with great summes of money; and at last vtterly forsooke him, his lawfull prince, his master, his patrone that had aduanced him by so many degrées vnto an estate so honorable. It pleased God, that vnthankfull timorousnesse should be his destruction: By the Quéene aforesaid (of whom he stood so greatly in awe) hee was commaunded to consecrate one Iames Barkley elected Bishop of Excester. Hee did so, but for his labour was so threatned, taunted, and reuiled by the Pope, that said he had reserued the gift of that Bishoprike vnto

himselfe, as for gréefe and anger together he died, when he had sate Archbishop 13. yéeres, 9. moneths, and thrée wéekes. He was buried in the south wall of Christs church in Canterbury néere the Quier, where his tombe is yet to be seen, with an inscription which I haue reade long since, but I thinke is now defaced. This man was but meanely learned, yet very wise and of good gouernment, except when for feare and want of courage he neglected his dutie. He gaue vnto his Couent the Manour of Caldcote, and the wood of Thorlehot.

Canon of Chichester, Prebendary of Landaff, and Parson of Tunstal, a Kentish man borne, brought vp in Merton Colledge there, one very well learned (as learning went in those daies) was then elected by the monks, approoued by the king, &amp; affoorded consecration by the Pope at Auinion the yéere 1327. The first thing he did at his returne home was, that he excommunicated all the authors of the death of Walter Stapleton Bishop of Excester, as they had well deserued. Soone after, hee began to wrangle with his monkes of Canterbury about certaine land: They complained them vnto the Pope, who sent a Nuncio to Canterbury to heare and determine of this controuersie. Hee condemned the Archbishop in seuen hundred pound charges. After this, he began to visit his Prouince in like sort as his predecessors had done before him. The thē Bishop of Excester Iohn Graundson resisted him (for what cause I finde not) appealed to Rome, and would not suffer him so much as to enter into his Cathedrall Church, much lesse to visit in the same. These two repulses he took so tenderly, as beeing yet scarcely returned home, hee fell sicke and died, October 12. 1333. at Magfield. His body was conueighed to Canterbury, and laied in a marble tombe vpon the North side of Saint Anselms chappel. He sate Archbishop fiue yéeres and somewhat more.
            
            
               
               52. Iohn Stratford.
               
                  1333. Edw. 3.8.THe Pope (who now tooke vpon him to dispose of all Bishoprickes at his pleasure) was content at the Kings request to nominate vnto Canterbury (Uoide by the death of Simon Mepham) Iohn Stratford Bishop of Winchester. This Iohn Straford hauing long and to good purpose studied the Canon and ciuill Law, was called to the Archdeaconry of Lincolne. Being famous for his learning and good gouernment of that iurisdiction, Walter the Archbishoppe made him his principall Official and Deane of the Arches, and king Edward the second shortly after that, appointed him Secretary, and so one of his priuy counsell. It chaunced hee was Embassadour vnto the Pope at what time the Bishop of Winchester died; and hée at the request of Walter the Archbishop bestowed that Bishoprickke vnto this Iohn Stratford then present with him. This was done without the kings priuity, who desired to haue preferred vnto that place Robert Baldock his Chauncellor. Therefore taking it very ill, that either the one should giue, or the other dare to take it without his knowledge; hée was content to giue eare vnto Robert Baldock who plotted many deuises, a while how to keepe him from it, and after how to make him weary of it. Hee was consecrate vpon the Sunday called then Multae tribulat iustorum, which he thought boaded vnto him, how in the whole course of his life he should finde nothing but continuall trouble. It fell out according to that omino
                     •
                  s conceipt. Neuer I thinke any Archbishop, either before or after him, giuing so little cause, &amp; doing his indeuour to please, was more encombred with vn
                     •
                  eserued and often crosses. Hee had no sooner set foote into this Bishopricke of Winchester, but the king (who at that time was altogether ruled by the saide Robert Baldocke) caused all his goods to be seased, and his liuings to bée sequestred to his vse. Moreouer, hée caused him to bee summoned by a certaine strange kinde of writs to appeare I know not where; and when for feare hee was faine to hide himselfe, proclamation was made that no man should dare to harbour him, or giue him any kind of entertainement by meate, lodging,

or otherwise. Hauing endured these miseries the space of a yéere, he intreated the Archbishop to bee an intercessour vnto the King for him; who relating vnto him how dishonourable a thing it was for him to persecute a true subiect so terribly, both for an other mans fault, and an other mans pleasure too; hée was soone wonne to receiue the poore Bishop to his grace, and laid all the blame of that iniury vpon Robert Baldock. Being thus restored, he grew dayly more and more into the kings fauour, whom he serued both diligently and faithfully to the last hower. When all other forsooke him, euen Walter the Archbishop of whom hée had deserued so notably; this good Bishop would neuer bee allured vnto the contrary part by any meanes; in so much as, the Quéene and Roger Mortimer began to deuise how they might make him away. This he being certified of, hid himselfe, and was faine so to hold him selfe close a long time. In the ende, the king beeing dead, and all his fauourites or partakers either executed, or otherwise consumed; the Quéene and her sonne king Edward the third, well knowing they had nothing to lay against this man, but that hee was true and loyall to his Prince; they were content not onely to receiue him to their fauour, but also to make him Lord Chauncellor of England. Simon Mepham the Archbishop béeing then dead soone after, the king was also content to write earnestly vnto the Pope to preferre him vnto that Sée of Canterbury. Hée did so (as before I haue said.) And the monkes to make a vertue of necessity, they forsooth elected him also. About this time it happened that King Edward the third began to lay claime vnto the crowne of France; and passing the seas with a great power to iustifie his claime
                     •
                   hée thought good to commit the gouernment of the realme héere at home vnto the Archbishop. He beside other general promises of faithfulnes and diligence, in the charge deliuered vnto him, assured the King hee should want no money to expend in this exploit; whereunto all kind of people shewed themselues so willing to yéelde what helpe they possibly might, as he tooke vpon him to discerne, the king might command of them euen what he list. He was not deceiued in this coniecture: For no sooner was the King ouer the seas, but infinit sums of mony were collected with the

very good liking of all people. This mony (which men thought would haue maintained the charge of that war 2. or 3. yeares) the king being yoong and so easie to be either mistaken or deceiued, was spent in lesse then one yéere. The Archbishop maruelling thereat, aduised the king by letters, to remooue from him such as had had the disposing of his treasure; for that without imbesilling and falsehood, it was impossible so much money should be so soone consumed. The king on the other side, he put the Archbishop in minde of his promise, &amp; called vpon him continually for more money. Hee well knowing how hard it would bée to collect any reasonable summe so soone after so liberall contribution as had béene lately yéelded; fell to perswading the king to accept reasonable conditions, which hée heard the French King had offered him, and to come home. The king either was or seemed to be exceeding angry with this motion: yet knowing there was no remedy but hee must get him home, his mony being now spent, and his credit amongest the vsurers stretched to the highest pin; he told his souldiers on the one side that the Archb. had betraied him vnto the French king, who no doubt had hired him to detaine their pay in his hands; &amp; on the other side made his creditors beléeue that the Archb. had taken vpō him the discharge of al his debt, as hauing now gathered money sufficient for that purpose. So the discontentment of these people being either allaied, or cast vpon the Archbishop; it was deuised, that for the further countenāce of this plot, the king should step ouer into England sodainely, and cast into prison the Archbishop, together with the Bishop of Chichester the Chancelor, and the Bishop of Litchfield the Treasurer. To London he came secretly in a night, caught the two Bishops, and sent them to the Tower; but the Archbishop by méere chaunce was gone from Lambhith else whether the day before, and hauing some inkling afterwards, of that was meant vnto him, got him to Canterbury and there stood vpon his guard. A knight was sent vnto him to require him to make present payment of a certaine huge sum of money which the king said hee had taken vp of outlandish merchants vppon his (the Archbishops) credit, or else to get him ouer the seas immediately vnto them, and to yéelde them his body till the debt were satisfied, for that so the King had vndertaken hee should,

                  ated thereunto by his owne promise. Soone after, there came certaine messengers from the Duke of Brabant desiring to speake with the Archbishop, and when hée refused to confer with them, cited him by writings to make paiment of certaine great sums of money which they alleaged he ought to the Duke for money the king of England had receiued. This Citation they fixed vpon the high crosse at Canterbury with many ceremonies. Now the Archbishop perceiuing what a terrible tempest was growing toward him (for he was charged not only with the debt of many thousand pounds more then ouer he should be able to make, but with horrible treason, that might not onely take away his life, but make him odious in his life time, and infamous for euer with all posterity)
                     •
                   He wrote many letters vnto the king, wherein hee purged himselfe most cléerely of whatsoeuer was obiected, and prayed him not to command his repaire vnto his presence, vntill a parliament were assembled; wherein, if hee were to be charged with any crime, he vowed to offer himselfe vnto iustice. Understanding then that the king had written diuers discourses against him vnto the Bishop of London, the couent of Canterbury and others, to the intent they might be publike; for defence of his credit, hee thought it requisite to make his Apology in the pulpit, which he did, taking this for his text, Non pertimuit Principem, &amp; potentia nemo vicit illum, &amp;c. Eccles. 48. At last a Parliament was summoned, whereunto vpon safe conduct he came. He was not suffered to come into the parliament house before hee had answered to certaine crimes obiected against him in the court of the Exchequer. He went thither, and receiuing a copy of the articles, promised to make answere vnto them. The next day comming againe vnto the parliament, he was once more forbidden entrance. A great number of people flocking about him in the meane time, hee tould them how hée had béene summoned to the parliament, wherof he was a principal member; and now being come, was kept out by violence. But saith he (taking his crosse into his owne hand) I will not hence till I either bee suffered to come in or heare some cause alleaged why I should not. While he stood there, some of the company began to reuile him and to tell him hee had betraied the realme, &amp;c. Unto whom he answered thus, The curse of

                   also, be vpon the heads of them that inform the king so, Amen, Amen. In the mean time certaine noble men chanced to come out, whom he besought to request the King in his behalfe. By their meanes he was at last admitted into the house, and being charged with diuers hainous crimes, offered to purge himselfe of them; and if, they might be proued, to submit himselfe vnto iustice. Twelue men were chosen to examine this matter, viz. 4. prelates, the Bishops of London, Bath, Hereford &amp; Exceter; 4. Ea

                  les, Arundell, Salisbury, Huntington &amp; Suffolk; &amp; lastly 4. Barons. Henry Percy, Thomas Wake, Ralfe Basset, and Ralfe Neuill. Al this was but to make the Archbi. odious with the common people: A fault was committed; and the king willing the blame thereof should lye any where rather then vpon himselfe, made all this ado to bleare the peoples eyes. The matter neuer came to the hearing of these nobles: but was so handled, that the Archbishop vpon great sute and intreaty of in a maner the whole parliament, must bée pardoned all that was past, and receiued to fauour againe. After this, hée liued certaine yeeres quietly. Hauing béene Archbishop about 15. yéeres, he fell sicke at Magfield, and making his will (wherein he gaue all he had vnto his seruants) died there. He was butied in a goodly tombe of Alabaster on the south side of the high altar beside the steps of S. Dunstanes altar. Hee was a very gentle and mercifull man, rather too remisse then any way rigorous vnto offenders. His manner was thrise euery day to giue almes to 13. poore people; in the morning pence a péece; at 9. a clocke, bread, meat and pottage, and at noone againe euery one a loafe and a peny. He gaue vnto his Church of Canterbury a very sumptuous miter and certaine bookes. He assigned also vnto the same a pension of fiue pound out of the parsonages of Boughton and Preston appropriated vnto the Ab

               THe Pope at this time had so farre incroched vpon vs here in England,
                     Edw. 3.23. 1348. as he would seldome or neuer suffer any orderly election to take place, but bestow all Bishoprickes where it pleased him. The King (Edward the third) much discontented herewith, writ vnto him, very earnestly praying him, to forbeare his prouisions and reseruations, wherby he robbed patrones of their right and chapters of their elections: telling him, that the disposition of Bishoprickes belonged of olde vnto the king onely, that his progenitors at the sute of diuers Popes had giuen that their authority vnto Chapters; which if they vsed not, he assured him selfe, it deuolued againe vnto the first granter, which was the king. The copy of this letter is to bée séene in Thomas Walsingham and other. After the receit of this letter, the Pope would seldome or neuer take vpon him to giue any Bishopricke, but vnto such as the King made request for. But so, betwéene the King and the Pope, elections were altogether deluded, and made frustrate. And therfore Stratford being dead, wheras the Couent made choice of one Thomas Bradwardin to succéede him, the king writing somewhat earnestly to the Pope in fauour of Iohn Vfford, he was by and by pronounced Archbishop by the Popes Oracle, &amp; the other vtterly reiected. This Iohn Vfford was sonne vnto the Earl of Suffolke, brought vp in Cambridge, and made Doctor of Law there (saith Mathew Paker, howbeit it appeareth, that one Iohn Offord tooke that degrée at Oxford about these times) promoted first vnto the Deanery of Lincolne, then to the Chancellorshippe of England, and lastly the Archbishopricke. He neuer receiued eyther his pall, or consecration: Hauing expected the same the space of sixe monethes, he died in the time of that great plague, that (as Walsingham reporteth) consumed nine parts of the men through England, (scarce leauing a tenth aliue) Iune, the seuenth, 1548. His body without any pompe or wonted solemnity, was carried to Canterbury, and there secretlie buried by the North Wall, beside the wall of Thomas

Becket, at that place (if I mistake not) where we sée an olde woodden tombe néere to the toombe of Bishop Warham. He beganne to builde the Archbishops pallace at Maidstone, but died before he could bring it to any perfection. Now the foresaid Iohn Vfford being sodainely taken away, as before is declared, the Couent of Canterbury once more chose him the said Bradwardin, the King very willingly allowed of their choice; and the Pope hauing not yet heard of this their second election, of his own accord before any request made cast vpon him this dignity. Hardly shall you finde any Archbishoppe in any age to haue attained his place in better sort. He was consecrate at Auinion by one Bertrand a Cardinall in the Church of the Frier minors there. That Ceremony once performed, he hasted him home into England; where first doing his duety to the King, hee receiued of him immediately his temporalties with all fauour. From the Court he departed to Lambhith to rest himselfe after his long iourney. Lying there a while with the Bishoppe of Rochester, he fell sick and within fiue wéekes and fower dayes after his consecration died, so that he was neuer inthronized at all. He was buried in the Chappel of Saint Anselme toward the south wall. This man was borne at Hatfield in Sussex, and brought vp in the Uniuersity of Oxford, where hauing trauelled a long time in the study of good learning, he became one of the Proctors, the yeare 1325. and afterward procéeded Doctor of Diuinity. He was a good Mathematitian, a great Philosopher, and so excellent a Diuine, as he is commonly enstyled Doctor prosundus; which title that hee well inough deserued, diuers works of his not yet perished doe testifie. But aboue all he is especially to be commended for his sincerity of life and conuersation. Iohn Stratford the Archbishoppe in regard of these vertues commended him vnto that noble prince K. Edward the third, for his Confessor. In that office he behaued himself so, as he deserueth eternall memory for the same. He was wont to reprehend the King with great boldnes for such things as he saw amisse in him. In that long and painefull warre which the king had in France, he neuer would bee from him, but admonished him often secretly, and all his army in learned and most eloquent sermons publikely, to take

héede they waxed not proud and insolent because of the manifold victories God had sent them; but to be thankfull vnto him for them, and to haue a care to vse them moderatelie. Some there be that haue not doubted to ascribe that notable conquest rather to the vertue and holinesse of this man, the
                     •
                   to any other meanes eyther of prowesie or wisdome in other instruments of the same. Hee that might haue obtained of the king any preferment be would haue craued, was so farre from ambitious desire of promotion, as it was long before hée could bee perswaded to take a Prebend of Lincolne, when it was offered him, being before that Chancellor of Paules in London. It is certaine also that hee was elected vnto the Archbishopricke without his owne séeking, &amp; might easily haue made the king for him, if he had endeauoured it. When some men maruelled that the king should refuse him, and preferre any other before him; he answered he could very ill spare him, and he perceiued not hee was desirous to be spared.
            
            
               54 Simon Islip.
               
                  SImon Islip brought vp in Merton Colledge in Oxforde, being Doctor of law, became Canon of Paules,1349. Edw. 3.24. then Deane of the Arches; after that was chosen to be of the Priuy Councell of King Edward the third, first in the place of Secretary, and then kéeper to the Priuy Seale. Iohn Stratforde lying vppon his death bedde, foretolde hee should be Archbishoppe. It came to passe, within two yéeres after his death, though two other were serued before him. The Monks with the kings very good liking those him, and the Pope would not refuse him: yet being loath to ratifie the Monkes election, he reiected the same, and ex plenitudine potestatis bestowed the Archbishopricke vpon him. His buls were published in Bow Church, October, 4. 1349. and in the moneth of December following, hee was consecrate by the Bishop of London in Paules Church. Hee was inthronized secretly to saue charge. For he was a very frugal and sparing man, neuer estéeming pompe or outward brauery any thing at all. He was also very seuere. When he first visited his

owne Dioces, he depriued many clergy men of their liuings. He passed thorough the Diocesses of Rochester &amp; Chichester without kéeping any great adoo: So that euery one made account he was content to winke at the faults he espied. But they 
                     •
                  ound it otherwise. For he afterward called home vnto him the offenders, and there dealt so with them, as all men might assure themselues he would proue a very austere man in his gouernment. Iohn Synwel Bishop of Lincolne, standing in doubt of this asperity of his, with great cost procured a priuiledge from Rome to exempt himselfe from his authority and iurisdiction. But the Archbishop caused the same afterward to be reuoked. The Uniuersity of Oxford had presented vnto him the said Bishoppe of Lincolne (vnto whose iurisdiction Oxford then appertained) one William Palmori
                        •
                     
                   for their Chancellour, and prayed him to admit him. The Bishoppe (I know not for what cause) delayed his admission from time to time, and enforced the Uniuersity to complain of this hard dealing vnto the Archbishoppe. He presently set downe a day wherein hee enioyned the Bishoppe to admit this Chancellour, or else to render a reason of his refusall. At the time appointed, the Proctors of the Uniuersity were ready together with this William Palmorie to demaund admission: And when the Bishop of Lincolne came not (trusting belike to his priuiledge aforesaide) the Archbishoppe caused his Chancellour Iohn Carlton Deane of Wels to admit him, writte to the Uniuersity to receiue him, and cited the Bishoppe to answere before him for his contempt. Hée appealed to the Pope, would not come, and for his contumacy was interdicted. Much money was spent in this su
                     ••
                   afterwards at Rome. The end was, that the Archbishoppe preuailed, and the others priuiledge was by speciall order of the Pope revoked; who also granted vnto the Uniuersity at the same time, that the Chancellour hereafter should onely bee elected by the schollers themselues, and so presently authorized to gouerne them without the admission of any other. This conquest thus atchieued, hee entred 
                     •
                  e: into another combate in the same sand, I mean at Rome. Hee sued Andrew Vfford Archdeacon of Middlesex, the administrator of Iohn Vfford his predecessor, for

and recouered of him 1101. l. fiftéen shillinges two pence halfe penny farthing. That money he imployed in repayring the pallace at Canterbury. He pulled downe the manner house at Wrotham, and imployed the stones &amp; timber of the same in ending the building that Iohn Vfford his predecessor aforesaid had begun at Maidstone. Toward this and other charges he obtained of the Pope leaue to craue a contribution of foure pence out of euery Marke from all the Clergy of his Prouince. But his officers (whether of purpose, or peraduenture mistaking) demaunded and had a whole tenth. All this was within a yeáre or two of his first comming to the Archbishopricke; at which time also in a Parliament held at Westminster, the yéere 1350. the olde controuersie betwéene him and the Archbishoppe of Yorke, about hearing vp his Crosse in the Prouince of Canterbury beganne to be renewed, was compromitted vnto the hearing and iudgement of the king, who set downe a finall order for the same, viz. that the Archbishoppe of Yorke, should beare his Crosse in the others Prouince, yeelding all préeminence otherwise vnto Canterbury, but that in token of subiection, euery Archbishoppe at his entrance should offer an image of golde to the value of forty pound, at the shrine of Saint Thomas, the same to bee sent by some Knight or Doctor of the Law within the space of two monethes after his inthronization. Amongst the rest of his actions, I may not in any wise forget his Colledge of Canterbury, (which is now become a parcell of Christ Church in Oxford). Hee built it and endowed it with goo
                     •
                   possessions, appropriating vnto the same the parsonages of Pagham and Magfield. He graunted also vnto the Couent of Canterbury the Churches of Monkton and Estrey. It is worthy remembrance likewise, that when a certain Countesse of Kent after the Earle her husbands death had professed her selfe a Nunne, and hauing liued so certaine yéeres, suddenly married a certaine Knight named Eustace Abricourt contrary to her vow, and that secretly without asking of banes or dispensation; hee punished them seuerely for it, but suffered them to liue still together, and seuered them not. Amongst many good déedes, hee is blamed for

                  elling

After hée had béene Archbishop sixetéene years, foure monethes and twelue dayes, he died April 26. 1366. Riding to Magfield, his horse chaunced to cast him into a meiry poole. Wet as hée was, he fell asleepe at his comming thither, and waking found himselfe in a pals

He bequeathed vnto his church of Canterbury a thousand sheep, his vestments which were all cloth of golde, a very sumptuous coape and much plate, viz. 6. dozen of siluer dishes, sixe saltes, and foure goodly Basons all enchased with his Armes. He lyeth buried in the middle of the body of his Church of Canterbury, vnder a faire toombe of Marble inlaid with brasse, whereon is engrauen this Epitaph.

               AFter the decease of Simon Islip,
                  1366. Edw. 3.41. the Monkes of Canterbury chose William Edindon Bishoppe of Winchester for Archbishop, who refused the place, vsing (as the report goeth) this spéech: Canterbury is the higher racke, but Winchester is the better manger. The Pope then with the Kinges good liking, remooued to Canterbury Simon Langham Bishop of Ely and Treasurer of England. He was first a Monke of Westm. then Prior, and lastly Abbot there. Thence he was elected Bishop of London; but before he was consecrate thereunto, obtained Ely, where he continued fiue yéeres. He receiued his pall by the handes of the Bishop of Bathe, in Saint Nicholas Chappell at Westminster, Nouemb. 4. 1366. and was enthronized the Lady day following. He was Archbishop but a little while, viz. two yéeres or little more, and therefore did not many things very memorable. There was a great strife betwéene the Londoners and their Clergy about tything, which he thus composed; he tooke order that they should pay, their offrings, personall tithes, and then also for the rest a farthing of euery 10. s. rent. From Canterbury Colledge (which his predecessor had founded) he sequestred the fruites of the benefice of Pagham, and otherwise molested the schollers there, intending to displace them all, and to put in Monkes; which in the end hée brought to passe. Iohn Wickliffe was one of them that were so displaced, and had withstoode the Archbishop in this businesse with might and maine. By the Popes fauour and the Archbishops power, the Monks ouerbore Wickliffe and his fellowes. If then VVickliffe were angry with Pope, Archbishoppe, monks, and all, you cannot maruell. But to returne to our Archbishop, he sate here onely two yeares. For béeing made Cardinall of Saint Sixtus by Pope Vrban the fi

                  t, September 21. 1368. he left his Archbishopricke and went to Auinion; where shortly after he was made Bishoppe Cardinall of Preneste by Gregory the eleuenth, &amp; held diuers liuings in Commendam, as the Archdeaconry and Treasurership of Wels with other. He liued there in great estimation about

eight yéeres, and died Iuly 22. 1376. of the same disease his predecessor had done, viz. a palsie, wherewith hee was suddenly taken as he sate at dinner. He was buried first in the Church of the Carthusians (whose house he had founded) at Auinion: but after thrée yeares, his bones (by his owne appointment while he liued) were taken vp, &amp; buried a second time at Westminster, in a goodly toombe of alabaster. It is scarce credible that is reported of his wonderfull bounty and liberality to that Monastery, I meane Westminster. When he was first made Abbot, hee bestowed all that he had gathered together being Monke and Prior, in paying the debt of the house, which was to the value of two thousand and two hundred marks: he discharged it euery whit, and diuers other summes of money also, that particular Monks did owe: whom he tendred and cherished as his owne children, neuer taking any thing from them, but rather augmenting their portions out of that which was due to himselfe. Beeing Chancellour and Treasurer, he purchased diuers good peeces of land and gaue it vnto them. When hee went out of England, he left them books to the value of 830. pound, and copes, vestments, &amp;c. estéemed worth 437. pound. At his death hée bequeathed vnto them all his plate, prised at 2700. pound, &amp; all his debts any where due; they amounted vnto 3954. l. thritéen shillinge and foure pence. He also sent vnto the saide Monastery the summe of one thousand markes to buy

                  orty markes a yéere land, to increase the portions of foure monks that dayly should say Masse for the soules of himselfe and his parents. To say nothing of the Monastery which he built for the Carthusians at Auinion, the money that he bestowed only vpon the Abbey of Westminster one way or other, is reckoned by a Monke of the same to bee no lesse than 10800. l. They caused this Epitaph to be engrauen vpon his toombe,

               William Wittlesey.
               
                  SImon Islip was vncle vnto a young man named William Wittlesey,
                  1368 Edw. 3.43. whom he caused carefully to bee brought vp, &amp; directed vnto the study of the Canon law. Hauing at Oxford procéeded Doctor in that faculty, his vncle (that now was become Archb.) sent him to Rome, that there he might both solicite all his causes, and also get experience by séeing the practise of that Court. After he had stayed there a while, hée was called home and preferred by his vncle aforesaid, vnto the place of vicar generall, then to the Deanry of the Arches, the Archdeaconry of Huntingdon, the Parsonages of Croydon &amp; Clyff, and lastly, the Bishopricke of Rochester. From Rochester he was remoued to Worcester, (his vncle yet liuing and ioying much in this his aduancement) the yéere, 1363. From thence some say he was translated to London; but that I take to be mistaken. Simō Sudbury was Bishop of London before he came to Worcester, and so continued till that after his death he succéeded him in Canterbury. Thither this man was aduanced by the Popes onely authority presently after Simon Langham was made Cardinal, viz. the yéer 1368. At two seuerall synods hée preached in Latine very learnedlie; The latter of those sermons he could hardly end for sicknesse, wherewith he had béen so much troubled before, as for two yéers space he was faine to kéepe his chamber almost altogether. Not being able to resist the force of this tedious wearing disease any longer, he paid the debt of his mortality. Octob. 11. (or as T. Walsingham hath Iul. 5) 1374. hauing continued in this sée almost 7. yéers. He was buried ouer against his vncle betwéen two pillers, vnder a faire marble toomb inlaide

with brasse, which is lately defaced by tearing out the brasse; I remember that some sixetéen yéeres since I read the Epitaph engrauen vpon the same. This man procured the Uniuersity of Oxford to be exempt from the iurisdiction of the Bishop of Lincolne, and all authority of gouerning the same to be committed vnto the Chancellour and Proctors.
            
            
               57 Simon Sudbury.
               
                  1375. Edw. 3.50.PResently after the death of William Wittlesey, the Monkes of Canterbury elected for their Arcbishop a certaine Cardinall that was an Englishman born, but throughly Italianate, hauing lead his life in a manner altogether at Rome. I take it his name was Adam Easton. The King with this choice of theirs was so gréeuously offended, as hée determined to banish them (the Monks I meane) out of the Realme, and to confiscate their goods. Gregory the 11. that then was Pope, though he fauoured his Cardinall, to shielde the poore Monkes from the danger of such a tempest, was content to refuse this election, and to bestow the Archbishopricke by way of prouision vpon Simon Sudbury Bishoppe of London, whom he knew the King liked well inough. This Simon was the son of a Gentleman, named Nigellus Tibold, so that his true name was Simon Tibold: But he was borne at Sudbury a towne of Suffolke in the parish of S. George, and of that towne tooke his name, according to the manner of many Clergy men in those dayes. Hee was alwaies brought vp at schoole, and being yet very yong, was sent by his father beyond the seas to study the canon law, and hauing procéeded Doctor of that faculty, became houshold Chapleine vnto Pope Innocent, and one of the Iudges or Auditors of his Rota. The said Pope by way of prouision thrust him first into the Chancellorship of Salisbury, and then afterward
                     •
                   viz. the yéere, 1364. into the Bishopricke of London. He receiued the bulles of his translation thence, Iune 6. 1375. Two Synods or Conuocations were held in his time, at both which he preached in Latine in his own person. Sir yéers one month and ten dayes he gouerned the Sée of Canterbury laudably, and at last was most vnworthily slaine, or rather wickedly

murthered by a company of villanous Rebels. By the instigation of one Iohn Bal a seditious malecontent &amp; hypocritical preacher, the baser sort of the Commons arose in diuers parts of the realme, and intending to destroy all gentlemen, lawyers, cleargymen, and whosoeuer were of any account, eyther for their riches, linage or authority in the common welth came vp to London, appointing for their leaders, VVat Tyler, Iacke Straw, Iohn Lister, Robert Westbrom, &amp;c. The king vnderstanding of their comming, sent vnto them to know the cause of their repaire in so great numbers. They answered, they were to impart vnto him certaine matters greatly importing the state of the common wealth; which if he would vnderstand, he should spéedily resort vnto them. The king hauing receiued this saucy answere, began to consult with his friends whether he were best to goe to them or not. The greater number perswaded him to goe. But the Archbishop and Sir Robert Hales Treasurer of England, disswaded him saying, it was a thing not onely indigne and shamefull for a Prince to be commanded by such rascals, but also dangerous vnto his person to commit himselfe to a route of seditious people, that hauing once broken the ba
                     •
                  ds of all duty and alleageance, feared no more to violate the sacred maiesty of their annointed prince then to wrong their neighbours of farre meaner condition, of whom they had alreadie slaine, spoiled and robbed an infinite number; for which cause they thought it more safe for the king, more honourable and euery way more expedient, to gather some power together spéedily, and to set vpon them; who béeing yet vnprouided of armour, destitute of good leaders, and without all skill or experience of warlike affaires, would soone hee dispersed and ouerthrowne. This spéech of theirs (I know no
                     •
                   by what tell-tales) was carried vnto the rebels, who sware by and by they would haue off the heads of these cruell counsellers. So in all haste to the Tower they came, where the Court then lay; requiring with great outcries the Archbishop, and the saide sir Robert Hales to be deliuered vnto them. The Archbishop hauing heard seme inckling of their intent the day before, had spent all that night in prayer, and iust when they called for him, was saying of Masse in the Chappell of the

Tower. That ended, and hearing of their comming; Let v
                     •
                   now goe (saith he vnto his men) Surely it is best to die, séeing to liue it can be no pleasure. With that, in came these murtherous rebels crying, where is the Traitor? where is the Traitor? He answered, I am the Archbishop (whom I thinke you seeke) but no Traitor. With great violence then they drew him out of the chappell and carried him to the Tower-hill. Séeing there nothing but swords, and weapons, and hearing nothing but Kill, kill, away with the Traitor; Yet hee was not so amazed, but with great eloquence hée could go about to perswade them not to imbrue their hands in the bloud of their Archbishop, their chiefe pastor, that had neuer offended them to his knowledge, nor deserued so cruell a death at their handes
                     •
                   assuring them, that all the Realme would bée interdicted for it, that the fact must needs be punished first or last by the temporall law; &amp; lastly that though both these failed, God the iust iudge would reuenge it either in this, or the world to come, if not both. He was a man admirably wise, and exceeding well spoken. But these varlets were so eagerly bent, as the very songs of the Syrens would nothing haue moued them at all from their intended course. Seeing therefore nothing but death before his face, with a very chearefull countenance, and comfortable words, forgiuing the executioner (that scarce euer requested him so to do) he knéeled downe and yéelded himselfe vnto their fury. Once he was stricken in the necke so weakly, as that notwithstanding, he knéeled still vpright, and putting his hand vp to the wound, he vsed these words, a ha, it is the hand of God. Hée had not remoued his hand from the place whē a second stroke cut off his fingers ends, and felled him to the ground. After much adoe, hauing hacked and hewen his necke with eight blowes, they got off his head. This horrible murther was committed vpon Friday, Iune 14. 1381. all which day, and a part of the next, his body lay there headlesse, no man daring to offer it buriall: as for his head, they nayled his hood vpon it, and so fixing it vpon a po
                     •
                  le, set it on London Bridge. Sir Robert Hales and a great many of others that day tasted of the same cup the Archbishop had done. Thus ended this noble Prelate his dayes, who though he were very wise, learned,

eloquent, liberall, mercifull, and for his age and place reuerend, yet might it not deliuer him from the rage of this beast with many heads the multitude; then which being once incensed, there is no bruit beast more cruell, more outragious, more vnreasonable. How this monstrous tumult was appeased at the last, and the Authors of the same punished, according to their demerites, the Chronicles at large declare. Onely this I thinke fit to remember, that one Iohn Starling who boasted to haue beheaded him, within few dayes after lost his owne head for the same, as he had well deserued. The body of this our Archbishop, after all st
                     •
                  rres ended, was carried to Canterbury, and there honourably enterred vpon the South side of the Altar of S. Dunstan, a little aboue the toombe of Bishop Stratford. Being yet Bishop of London, he builded the vpper end of Saint Gregories church at Sudbury; and in the place where his fathers house stoode, founded a goodly Colledge, which he furnished with secular Clearkes and other Ministers. At the time of the suppression thereof, it was valued at one hundred twenty two poundes eightéene shillings lands by the yéere. After his translation to Canterbury, he built the West gate of the City, and all the wal from that gate vnto Norgate, commonly called

               58 William Courtney.
               SOone after the lamentable death of Simon Sudbury,
                  1138 Ric. 2.5. the Monkes of Canterbury elected for their Archbishoppe William Courtney Bishoppe of London, and the Pope knowing nothing of their election, about the same time bestowed the Archbishopricke vpon him by way of prouision. Hée was the sonne of Hugh Courtney Earle of Deuonshire, in his youth studied the Canon Law, and no sooner entred into orders, but hee was quickly loaded with spirituall liuing inough, as a Prebend in Wels, an other in Exceter, &amp; a third in Yorke, beside benefices with cure in now. The yéer 1369. he was consecrate Bishop of Hereford, sate there fiue yéers &amp; a halfe, and then remoued to London, at what time Simon

Sudbury was made Archbishop. Thomas Walsingham addeth to these former honours, that the yéere 1378 hée was made Cardinal, concerning which matter sée London. The Bulles of his trantiation to Canterbury were published in Christ church there Ianuary 9. 1381. Hauing then receiued his temporalties of the King, and done his homage, he went to Lambhith. Thither came vnto him a Monke sent from the Couent and Prior of Canterbury, to deliuer him his Crosse, which he did in the Chappell of Lambhith, vsing these wordes; Reuerend Father I am the messenger of the great King that doth require and commaund you to take on you the gouernement of his Church, to loue and defend the same. In token whereof I deliuer you this his ensigne. Soone after he receyued his Pall, and then being throughly setled, beganne his Metropoliticall Uisitation, which he entended to performe in euery Dioces of his Prouince. Hauing passed quietly through Rochester, Chichester, Bathe and Worceter
                     •
                   at Exceter he found some resistance, as well as Simon Mepham his predecessor had done. After the time of his first inhibition, he prorogued diuers times the day of his visitation; and when he had sat
                     •
                  , was not so hasty in graunting a relaxation of the inhibition as they would haue him. Hereby it came to passe that the Bishoppe and his Archdeacons were suspended from their iurisdiction longer, (as it séemed vnto them) then they ought, and not disposed to awaite the Archbishops pleasure any longer, rushed into their iurisdictions againe, his visitation nothing néere finished, commanding all men vpon paine of excommunication, to repaire vnto their wonted ordinaries for proofe of Wils, administrations, institutions, or any other such like occasions. This commandement published in many places of the Dioces, the Archbishop pronounced to be void; and required all men in these and the like cases to repaire vnto him, and none other. Herupon the Bishop appealed to Rome, and the Archbishop cited diuers of the Bishoppes officers to appeare before him. His Apparitor (named Peter Hill) had also in his bosome a citation for the Bishop himselfe. It happened that some of the Bishops followers, méeting this gentle Somner at Tapsham, beat him well &amp; thristily, and after forced

him to eate the citation, wax, paper and all. This fact was very preiudiciall to the Bishop of Exceters cause: For it incensed the king against him; insomuch as though a while hée did prosecute his appeale at Rome diligently, hee saw himselfe so ouerborne by the king, hee was like to doe no good at all, and therefore resolued to make his peace with the Archbishop vpon reasonable conditions which he easily obtained. But they that had abused his Apparator, were put to terrible pennance in diuers parts of the realme, and were faine to perform the same. One William Byd a Doctor of the Arches had giuen counsell vnto the Bishop in this cause: for so doing hée was displaced, and vpon that occasion an oathe was ordained of this Archbishop, that euery Aduocate of that Court shoulde take at his admission. This Uisitation ended, the Archbishop proceeded to the Dioces of Salisbury, where hee likewise found some resistance The Bishop there had procured a priuiledge from Pope Boniface (Vrban the 6 being lately dead) that it should not be lawfull for any Metropolitane to visite him or his Dioces by vertue of any authority granted from Pope Vrbane. The Archbishop (that was a great Lawyer) knew well inough he had power of himselfe, as béeing Metropolitane to visite without the Popes licence; and therefore procéeded boldly (notwithstanding that vaine priuilege) &amp; so canuased the Bishop with excommunications and ecclesiasticall censures, as he was faine to yéeld at last and cry peccaui. Since that time our Archbishop
                     •
                   haue visited quietly all Diocesses of their Prouince without resistance. Towarde the latter end of his time hee procured a licence of the Pope to gather foure pence of the pound in all Ecclesiasticall preferments within his Prouince. The Bishop of Lincolne refused to make this collection in his Dioces, and appealed vnto the Pope. That appeale yet depending, the Archbishoppe died Iuly 31. 1396. at Maidstone, when he had sate 12. yéers lacking one moneth. The old worke at Maidstone first built by Boniface his predecessor for an hospitall, he pulled downe and building it after a more stately manner, translated it into a Colledge of secular Priests, which at the time of the suppression was valued at one hundred thirty nine pounds seuē shillings Axe pence by the yéer. The church of Mepham quite

fallen downe, hee repaired againe and built certaine Almes houses neere it for the vse of poore people. In building and enlarging of his houses he bestowed much, especially vpon his Castle of S

Scarce was he warme in his seate, when by the kings displeasure he was dispossessed of the same. In the second yéere of his translation a Parliament was held at London. The King there accused the Duke of Glocester, the Earle of Arundell that was the Archbishops brother and diuers other of high treason. Now because Clergy men were forbidden by the Canons to be present at any triall or iudgement vpon life and death; the matter being once proposed, all the Bishops departed the house as their maner was in like eases. The Archbishop being absent vpon this occasion, was condemned together with his brother of high treason; for which his brother was presently executed, and hee commanded within fortie dayes to depart the realme vpon paine of death. Hée (thus

banished) got him to Rome, and found such fauour with the Pope, as first he was content to write earnestly vnto the king for his restitution; and when he could doe no good that way, he translated him to the Archbishopricke of S. Andrews in Scotland, intending to heape so much Ecclesiasticall liuing vpon him by benefices, &amp;c. in England, as hee should be able to liue in state honourable inough. The king vnderstanding of his intent, writ a maruellous sharpe letter vnto the Pope; telling him plainely he must repute him for his enemy, if he yéelded any manner of succour vnto him, whom hee knew well to hat
                     •
                   him deadly. That letter so wrought with the Pope, as after that time he neuer indeuoured to preferre him farther; &amp; moreouer, at the Kings request made Roger Walden (Deane of Yorke, and treasurer of England) Archbishop of Canterbury in his roome, who thereupon was consecrate, inthronised, held Synods and did all things belonging vnto that place the space of twoo yéeres. If happened in the meane time that the king (Richard the second) was deposed; or at least inforced to resigne his crowne vnto Henry Duke of Lancaster, that after possessed the same by the name of king Henry the fourth. Boniface the Pope vnderstanding then of the fal of king Richard pronounced the said Roger to be an intruder and vsurper of the Archbishopricke, and by his omnipotent buls restored Thomas Arundell vnto the same againe. As for Roger Walden that was now a Bishop without a Bishopricke (for Episcopatus is ordo, and so Character indelebilis) he liued in that state a while, till at last by the kind endeuour of the Archb. his charitable aduersary, hee was promoted vnto the Bishopricke of London, which he enioyed but a short time, being taken away by death within one yéere after. About a twelue moneth after the Archb. restitution, a conuocatiō was held at London, whither the K. sent the Earls of Northumberland and Westmerland, that told the Cleargy they came from the King, but not of that errand that Courtiers were wont to bee sent for to that place; they came not for money, but onely to signifie the kings hearty and fauourable good wil vnto them, and to request their daily praiers for him and the good estate of the Realme. This new broome with swéeping so cleane at the first, was so worne out vnto the stumpes, in a yéere of two, as not conten

with a bare tenth, the next conuocation after, he was very angry that a more liberal allowance was not made vnto him; and began to hearken vnto the sacrilegious motions of certain impious politicians, that intending to cast the burthen of all subsidies and other kind of tributes vpon the Cleargy, letted not to say openly in the parliament house, how the laity was not able to yeeld any thing to the Kings coffers, for that the cleargy had all the wealth of the land in their hands: And therefore the king must either take from them their temporalties, or else lay all the burthen vpon them that onely were able to beate it. The Archbishop (that was vndoubtedly a woorthy prelate, wise and very stout) rose vp and prooued by manifest arguments that the contributions of the Cleargy were after the proportion of their ability, much more liberall then the subsidies or other paiments of the temporalty in many respects. For (saith he) we pay the tenth of our liuings oftner then they pay fiftéenths, and though we serue not in the wars our selues, our seruants and tenants do; neither are we altogether idle, in as much as we pray daily for the king and the realme, as well in time of peace as warre. The prolocutor of the lower house of parliament at that time was a knight called Sir Iohn Clyen, that hauing béene a Cleargy man sometimes, without any dispensation forsooke the calling and became a soldier. This prophane Apostata was not ashamed to say, it was no matter for their praiers, so the king might haue their mony. I sée now (quoth the Archbishop) whither the fortune of this Realme tendeth, the prayers of the Church beeing despised, which should appease the wrath of God iustly kindled against vs by the daily monstrous iniquities of our age. Perceiuing then that the King (who at his first comming to the crowne had made many open and publike protestations of his loue to the Church, and his intent to defend and protect the same to the vtmost) that he I say began to hearken somewhat too patiently to these wicked motions; he turned him toward him, and making low ob

                  isance, humbly besought him, it would please his maiesty to remember those gracious and most honourable spéeches, wherin he had often signified his resolute determination of protecting the Church from all iniury, as also his oath taken to the same purpose at the time of his coronation, the daunger

and dishonour of breaking the same; and lastly, that hee should feare to offend him by whom Kings raigne, and before whose tribunall all princes and monarchs neuer so great must one day come to be iudged. The King séemed to be somewhat moued with these wordes, and desiring the Archbishop to take his place againe, well (quoth he) howsoeuer I doe otherwise I will leaue the Church in as good estate as I found it. The Archbishop then turning him about vnto the Proloquutor and certaine other knights of the lower house that accompanied him: You it was (saith he) and such as you are that perswaded the last king to take into his hande all such Celles in England as appertained vnto any religious houses of France or Normandy, assuring him it would so stuffe his coffers, as hée could not want in many yéeres after, and there is no question, but the land belonging to such celles was woorth an infinite summe of mony: Howbeit it is certaine and well inough knowne, that within one yéere after he had taken that course, he was not the value of halfe a marke the richer; and how he thriued afterward otherwise, I néede not tell you. After that time there were no other attempts against the Church in his daies. But the clergy were so terrified with that wauering doubtfulnesse of the king, as they durst not but graunt him a tenth euery yéere after; and though there were no other occasion, the Archbishop was faine to call a conuocation euen for that purpose. His end (being as some report it) was very miserable: his tongue swelled so big in his mouth, as he was able neither to eat, drink nor speak in many daies before his death, and died at last of hunger Febr. 20. 1413. when hee had sate one moneth aboue 17. yéeres.

                   Yet durst not this man consent vnto this election so made; but committed the matter vnto the Popes determination, who first pronounced the election of the monkes voide and then bestowed the Archbishopricke vpon him. This Henry Chichley was borne Highamferrys in Northamptonshire, brought vp in New Colledge in Oxford (where he proceeded Doctor of Law) and first preferred vnto the Chancellorship of Salisbury. Hauing béene imployed much in Embassages and other businesses of the king (wherein he euer behaued himselfe wisely and to the Kings great good liking) by his meanes hee was made first Bishop of S. Dauids, and then afterwards Archbi. by his sonne king Henry the fifth. He receiued his pall at the hands of the Bishop of Winchester, the 29. of Iuly. 1414. &amp; bought of the king the fruits of the vacacy (which was halfe a yeere) for sixe hundred markes.

For the towne of Highamferris where he was borne, he obtained and bestowed diuers important benefices, and in the same the yeare 1425. hee began at once the foundation of a goodly Colledge and a hospitall: the Colledge, for eight secular Priests fellowes, foure Clarkes, and sixe Queristers, which partly by him, partly by his executors, to wit his two brethren, was so endowed, as at the time of the sac

                  ilegious suppressing of the same, it was valewed at 156. pound and two shillings by the yeare. The hospital was for poore people, endowed likewise liberally. Those two foundations

finished, he began two other at Oxford; one called Bernard College suppressed by King Henry the eight, and renewed or newly founded by Sir Tho. White (who named it S. Iohns College) and All Soules College, which yet continueth in such state as he left the same, one of the fairest and séemliest of our Uniuersity. K. Henry the sixth gaue vnto that College at his request the lands of certaine priors aliens, to wit of 4. priories, of Albervery in Shropshire, Rumney in Kent, Languenith in Southwales, and Wodon Pinkney in Northamptonshire. This Archbishop moreouer bestowed much money in repairing the library at Canterbury, and then replenished the same with a number of goodly bookes: Hee gaue vnto his Church many rich ornaments and iewels of great price, and built a great part of the Tower called Oxford Tower in the the said Church. William Molash Prior there (that I may take any occasion to record so good a déede) the yéere 1430. furnished that Tower with a goodly bell remaining there to this day and knowne by the name of Bell Dunstan. The Diameter of that Bell at the lowest brim is two yards and somewhat more. But to returne to Henry Chichley, no Archbishop euer enioyed that honor so long as he did in 500. yeeres before him. He sate 29. yéeres, and dying Aprill 12. 1443. was laide in a very faire toombe built by him selfe in his life-time, standing vpon the North side of the Presbitery.

Waxing weary then of so painefull a place, hée resigned voluntarily the same. He sate Archbishop almost nine yeeres. Holding a conuocation at London the yeere 1452. he fell sicke, and thereupon departed to Maidstone, where shortly after hee died, viz. Iuly 6. Hée lieth buried at Canterbury in the place called the Martyrdome, vnder a flat marble stone, whereupon I find engrauen this Epitaph:

                   at Oxford in Merton Colledge; there then the Pope would not allow of the monkes election, but yet not daring to put any other into the place, of his owne good nature hee bestowed it vpon the same man that they had chosen. He receiued his crosse September 24. 1452. at London, and his pall the next day at Fulham, by the hands of Thomas Kemp the Bishop of London his nephew. Decem. 11. following he was inthronized with great pompe and solemnity. This Archbishop was borne at Wye in Kent: Being Doctor of Law he was made first Archdeacon of Durham, then Deane of the Arches and Uicar generall vnto the Archbishop. The yéere 1418. he was consecrate Bishop of Rochester, remoued thence to Chichester 1422. from Chichester to London the same yéere, and from London to Yorke 1425. Dec. 18. 1439. hee was made Cardinall of Saint Balbine, and afterwards being Archbishop of Canterbury was remooued to the title of S. Rufine. These his preferments one briefly expressed in this verse:

Hee continued not at Canterbury aboue a yéere and a halfe, but died a very olde man March 22. 1453. While hee was yet Archbishop of Yorke he conuerted the parish Church of Wye where he was borne into a colledge; in which he placed secular Priests to attend diuine seruice, and to teach the youth of the parish. Their gouernour was called a Prebendary. This colledge at the time of the suppression was valued at fowerscore and 13. pound two shillings by the yéere. His father and mother lye buried in the said Church with this Epitaph,

He granted the same absolutely, neuer making any kind of request or motion, for any man. Aprill 22. 1454. they elected Thomas Bourchier, Bishop of Ely. He was sonne vnto Henry Bourchier Earle of Essex, brought vp in Oxford (of which Uniuersitie he became Chauncellor anno 1434. and continued so thrée yeares) preferred first to the Deanry of S. Martins, then to the Bishopricke of Worcester, from whence the yéere 1443. he was translated to Ely.

                  flictions which that good king endured (Henry the 6.) he euer stuck fast to him, &amp; by no meanes would be drawne to forsake him when all the world in a manner betook them to his victorious aduersary. This so notable loyalty and faithfulnes king Edward himselfe honored so much in him, as king Henry being dead, he neuer ceased to allure him to his seruice, and hauing woone him, sware him of his Councell, and trusted him with his greatest secrets; assuring himselfe belike, that he that had béene so faithfull vnto his aduersary in so great aduersity,

would no doubt be as faithfull vnto him in the like case if occasion should serue. After many yéeres triall of him and diuers other preferments whereunto he aduanced him, he procured him to be elected vnto the Bishopricke of Ely, the yeere 1454. Not long after his consecration to that Sée, it hapned king Edward to die, who not reposing greater trust in any one then in this Bishop, made him one of his executors. The Duke of Yorke therefore his vnnaturall brother, intending by the destruction of his children to make a passage for himselfe vnto the Crowne, and knowing how watchfull an eye this man carried ouer them, as also how impossible it was to corrupt him and draw him to be a partner in his wicked consort

This Duke was the onely instrument of displacing the children of K. Edward from the crowne, &amp; procured the same to be most vniustly set vpon the head of their wicked vnkle the Duke of Yorke before mentioned, who was appointed protectour of them &amp; the realme, These lambs committed vnto the kéeping of such a wolfe, were soone deuoured, being not only despoyled of the rule and gouernment of the kingdome which descended vnto them by inheritance, but of their liues also, which were violently taken from them, by smoothering the poore innocent children betwéene fether beds.

How this deuice was debated betwéene the Duke and the Bishop, euery Chronicle reporteth. To let that passe, when the Bishop saw the Duke had waded so farre in the matter as step backe he could not, and séeing how he was able to do the Earle of Richmond better seruice elsewhere th

The yéere

Unto his kinsefolke and other friends hée gaue nothing as hauing preferred them sufficiently in his life time. His executors he bound by oath to maintaine sufficiently twenty poore schollers at Oxford, and ten at Cambridge for the space of twenty yéeres after his decease. Hee bestowed great summes in repairing and augmenting his houses at Knoll, Mayd stone, Alington parke, Charing, Ford, Lambith and Canterbury, and built while hée liued a sumptuous chappell in the vndercroft or vault which is vnder the quier. He lieth buried in the said chappell vnder a marble stone: Howbeit a goodly tombe is erected in memory of him vpon the south side of the chappell. See more of him in Ely.

himselfe the Earle of Warwicke, who was then so bee séene in the Tower safe enough; and Perkin Warbeck whom shee had taught to name him selfe Richard Duke of Yorke, that was certainly known to haue béen murthered by his wicked vncle long before. In this businesse hee behaued himselfe so wisely, as the king greatly commended him for the same, and the Bishoprick of London happening to be void soon after his return home, he procured him to be elected thereunto. He had not bin Bishop there two whole yéeres, when Henry Deane the Archbishop died, to whose place also by the Kings speciall indeuour he was aduanced. He was translated Nou. 29. &amp; inthrouised March 9. 1504. with wonderfull great solemnity. The day before his comming to Canterbury, the Duke of Buckingham that was his high steward, came thither attended with 7. score horse to sée all things in a readinesse. The said Duke had also the office of chiefe Butler, and therefore being vnable to do the duties of both, he deputed Sir George Bourchier vnto the Butlership. Himselfe tooke great paines to sée that nothing might be wanting requisite for the performance of this ceremony in most magnificent manner. The next day (which was Sunday) hee met the Archbishop ouer against S. Andrewes Church, and doing low obeysance vnto him, went before him to Christ church. At the great gate néere the market place, the Prior and Couent receiued him honourably and carried him to the Church (wh

With the Archbishop sate the Earle of Essex, the Bishop of Man, the Lord Aburgauenny, the Lord Brook, the Prior of Canterbury, and the Abbot of Saint Augustines. The Duke at his table was accompanied with the Lorde Clinton, Sir Edward

But to let passe these matters, and to come vnto his gouernement; all the time of K. Henry the seuenth (vnder whom hee liued Archbishop some thrée yeeres) he enioyed all manner of prosperity, being in so great fauour with his Princ
                     •
                  , as no man greater. He dying, and his sonne King Henry the eight succeeding, Cardinall Wolsey that was then but Almosner and Deane of Lincoln, diued so cunningly into the bosome of the yong king, as by and by he ouer topped the Archbishop, &amp; quickly wound him out of all authority. First, by the kings meanes hee got from him the Chauncellorship of England: Then being Cardinal, and the Popes Legate a latere by speciall commission, hee set vp a new court called Curia legatina; vnder colour whereof, he drew all manner of iurisdiction throughout England into his owne hands, and appointed Officials Registers, &amp;c. in euery Dioces, who tooke vp all causes, and suffered other officers (to whom the iurisdiction of right appertained) to sitte still without either regard or profit. This deiection of the Archbishop wherein men estéemed him for the time very vnhappy, fel out to his great good; the others immoderate greatnesse, was the cause of his destruction. At what time the King endeuoured to bee diuorced from his first wife M. Catherine
                  
                     •
                   she made choice of this our Archb. &amp; Nicholas West Bish. of Ely (two lawyers) &amp; of I. Fisher Bishop of Rochester, and Henry Standish Bi. of S. Assaph (Doctors of Diuinity) to assist and direct her in that sute: they did so, and behaued themselues in such sort, as neither the king had cause to bée offended with their ouerforwardnes, nor shee to blame their slacknes or negligence. But the Cardinal yt was ioined with Cardinal Campeius in commission, wherin they were authorised by ye Pope to examine the circumstances of that cause, he I say being more slack in his proceedings, then the K. expected he should, so incensed him yt said K. against him, as shortly

after he was content, first to take the aduantage of a Premunire against him, and then to cause him to bée arrested of high treason; whereof see more in Yorke. Soon after the Cardinals death, there was a Conuocation held, wherein the Cleargie was aduertised that they all had fallen into a premunire by yéelding vnto the Cardinals power legantiue, neuer allowed by the King: which allegations though diuers of them knew to be false inough, yet durst they not doe otherwise then to redéeme the penalty they were said to haue incurred with the payment of 118. thousand pounds, whereof the Prouince of Yorke should pay eighteene thousand, and Canterbury the rest, which was 100000. pounds. When this gift was to haue beene presented, they were certified that the king would not accept of the same, except they declared in a Canon that he was supreame head of the Church. Long this matter was hammering. But at last they agréede to giue vnto him this new title, and inserted the same into the instrument of their gift. In that Conuocation many Canons were made against Lutherans, and many motions for renouncing the Popes authority; wherein the greatest part being fearefull of resoluing either way, the Conuocation was often prorogued. After many adiournements it was once more put ouer from April till October 5. In which meane space the Archbishop died at Saint Stephens neere Canterbury, in the house of William Warham his kinsman, Archdeacon of Canterbury. That house at that time belonged vnto the Archdeaconry, but (by what sacrilegious meanes I know not) was long since nipped away from the same; so that the Archdeacon, except he be otherwise prouided for then by his Archdeaconry, is now houselesse. But to returne vnto our Archbishop, he was buried without any great funerall pompe, giuing mourning clothes onely to the poore, and laide in a little Chappell built by himselfe for the place of his buriall vpon the North side of the Martyrdome, and hath there a reasonable faire toomb

dilapidations against his executors. They were the Duke of Norfolke and the Lord Windsor. He continued Archbishop eight and twenty yeeres, and died Aug. 23. 1532.

                  Petrus Bembus an olde acquaintance of his, was become the Popes chief Secretary, who so commended him vnto his master, that shortly after hee was content to make him a Cardinall, perswading himselfe belike that hée would proue a good instrument for English matters as occasion should serue. And surely, if he regarded the worthines of the man, in respect of his manifold rare and excellent parts he could not lightly preferre any man lesse obnoxious to exceptions. For he was not onely very learned (which is better knowne then that it néedeth many words) but also of such modesty in outward behauiour, and integrity of life and conuersation, as he was of all men both loued and reuerenced. I know well that Pasquill played his parts with him, and fathered a brat or two vpon him, but without any probability at all. He was made Cardinal, May 22. 1536. The Pope employed him thē in diuers Ambassages vnto the Emperour and the French King, wherein he did his best endeauour to ioyne them against his owne Soueraigne the King of England; and not content therewith, hée dealt so busily with his letters amongst his friends in England, wherein hee dehorted them from the kings obedience, and all conformity vnto reformation, as it turned many of them to great trouble, &amp; amongst the rest cost his mother the Countesse of Salisbury, and his eldest brother the Uicount Mountacute their heads. It pleased not God that any of his platformes should take successe: And therefore partly malecontent, and partely also weary of the paines and continuall daunger

these ambassages forced him vnto, hee procured the Pope to make him Legate of of Uiterbio, where he determined to leade the rest of his life quietly; but hee was disappointed of his purpose. The Pope (Paul the third) summoned a Councell at Trent. Cardinall Poole and one or two other ioyned with him, must needs be his Uicegerents there. He for his part was nothing so resolute in matters of religion as men expected he would. In the question of iustification he professed to be on our side, and perswaded one Morell to be of his opinion, a learned Spaniard that lay in the same house he did, &amp; that was sent out of Spain of purpose to defend the Popes quarrel in disputation, wherein he was estéemed excellent. Soone after his returne from the Councell, it hapned the Pope to die. A great faction there was at that time in the Colledge of Cardinals, some taking part with the Emperour, and some with the French king: Cardinal Poole was altogether Imperiall. All that side and diuers that were indifferent gaue him their voices for the Papacy; whereunto whē they had elected him orderly he forsooth found fault with them for their rashnes, and perswaded them to take further deliberation in so great and weighty a matter. Heere of the French party taking aduantage, began to cry out, it was reason regard should be had of many French Cardinals and other that were absent, and could not possibly repaire vnto the election so soone; put them in minde also how the Emperour had lately sacked Rome as it were in iest, &amp; that it was much to bee feared if they elected any man that were altogether addicted vnto him it would bee a cause of great st
                     •
                  rres and trouble. One of their company then rising vp, began to take particular exceptions against Cardinall Poole, charging him with suspition of incontinency (whereof he alleadged some reasons, though peraduenture friuolous) as also with her
                     •
                  sie, for that he had reasoned for iustification by faith in the Councell of Trent, that he preferred Ant. Flaminius a knowne Protestant, and kept company much with him, as also with T
                        •
                     emelius, and other thought ill of that way; and lastly, that in the time he was Legate of Viterbio, he had been so slacke in persecuting of heretikes, vpon whom he seldome inflicted any punishment, but death vpon none. This accuser

was the Cardinall Caraffa, that afterward was Pope Paul the 4. an old acquaintance of Cardinall Pooles many yéeres, euen vntill such time, as that partaking in this factiō betwen the French and Spanish sundred them. Caraffa thought him selfe the likeliest of the French side, and in that respect was the rather induced in this sort to deface his olde friend, so to set vp himselfe. But he was vtterly deceiued in his expectation. Cardinall Poole cléered himselfe of all those suspicions absolutely, so that the next day (or rather I should say the night after the next day) the company were more resolute for him then they had béene before, and once more elected him Pope. Cardinall Farnesius the last Popes nephew was the mightiest of that canuasse. For so euer all Popes lightly take order, that some Cardinall of their kin shall strike a great stroke in the election of their successor, that hee may bee a meanes to shield the rest of his friends from that hard measure which successors are wont to meat

But he would not suffer him so to do, saying he wo

He was scarsely setled there, when newes came that king Edward was dead, and that his sister the Lady Mary had obtained the crowne; who was brought vp a great while vnder the Countesse his mother, by the especiall choise and direction of Quéene Katherine her mother. And many are of opinion that the Quéene committed her the rather vnto the tuition of the Countesse, for that shée wished some marriage betwéene one of her sonnes the

Now Cardinall Poole knowing the Quéene had a speciall affection vnto him for his learning, his nobilitie, but aboue all

                  nough, though elderly) longed sore homeward, not doubting a dispensation for his Clergy would soone bée obtained of the Pope in this case, if happily the Quéene should cast a fancy vnto him; and assuring himselfe that though hée missed of the crowne, hée should not faile of the Myter. Hée procured himselfe therefore to be appointed the Popes Legate, and to be dispatched into England with all spéed. The Emperour by this time had determined to endeauour a match betwéene his sonne Philip and Quéene Mary. Doubting therefore lest the presence of the Cardinall should disturbe his platforme, hee vsed many deuises to stop and hinder his passage, till such time as the marriage was indéede concluded. At last (but a day after the faire) ouer came this iolly Legate, reconciled the Realme of England to the Pope, caused the Archbishop of Canterbury to be depriued &amp; degraded, seating himselfe in his Sée, which things and many more are discoursed of him at large by Master Foxe, and therfore I passe them ouer. He was consecrate March 22. 1555. in the gray Friers church at Gréenewich. The Lady day following he receiued his pal in Bowchurch, where he made a drie and friuolous sermon touching the vse, profit, signification, and first institution of the pall, March, 31. he was installed by a Procter, one Robert Collins his commissary. While these thinge were a dooing, Cardinall Caraffa
                  
his ancient enemy became Pope. He presently discharged our Cardinall of his power Legantine, &amp; made one Frier Peto first a Cardinall, then his Legate, &amp; bestowed the Bishopricke of Salisbury vpon him. He alleaged against Cardinall Poole that he was vnworthy the honour of the Legate Apostolicall that would suffer the Quéene to proclaime warres against the French King; but the matter was, the old quarrels were not yet digested, &amp; this way he thought to pay him home. The quéene kept Frier Peto out of the Realme by force, vntill the Pope was reconciled vnto Cardinall Poole againe. Two yeere and almost eight moneths this man continued Archbishop. (In the yéere 1558. many old men fell into quartaine agues (a disease deadly and mortall vnto elderly folke.) Amongst the rest a quartane had seased vpon him, and brought him to a low ebbe, at what time newes brought of quéen

So the like hapned vnto him that befell vnto Deus dedit his predecessor, to end his dayes togither with his Prince. For as queene Mary and he, so Deus dedit and Ercombert king of Kent died in one &amp; the selfe same day. He procured in his life time the gift and patronage of 19. benefices from the queen vnto his See, which he no way else benefited, except by the building of a certaine gallery toward the east at Lambith, &amp; some few rooms adioyning. He purposed indeede to haue bestowed much cost vpon his pallace at Canterbury, but was preuented by death. Unto his Church of Canterbury hee gaue (as I finde noted) a payre of large candlestickes double guilt, a great crosse of siluer double guilt, a Censer with a shippe, and a spoone parcell guilt, a myter of siluer &amp; guilt set with pearle and stone, a Crosier staffe of siluer and guilt with a staffe in it, a crosse with a staffe for a crossebearer of siluer parcell guilt, two pontificall rings of gold set with saphyres, the borders whereof were set with turkyes, rubyes &amp; pearles; and lastly a holy water potte with a sprinkle of siluer parcell guilt. He was a man of indifferent stature, slender, well coloured, somewhat bread visaged, his eyes gray and cheereful, and his countenance milde. His good

                  1559 Eliz. 2.
                  MAthew Parker was borne at Norwich, August. 6. 1504. and brought vp by his mother (for his father died, he being but twelue yéeres of age) in the Uniuersity of Cambridge. He was first a Bible Clerke of Corpus Christi Colledge there, and afterwards fellow. His first preferment was the Deanry of Stoke, which he obtained by the fauour of Quéene Anne Bulleyne, whose Chaplaine hée was. That Colledge (though he resisted it what he might) was suppressed in the first yeere of King Edward the sixt. After the death of that noble Lady, king Henry her husband tooke him for his Chapleine, in which place he also serued king Edward his sonne. By these two Princes he was preferred vnto many other good Ecclesiasticall promotions, as a Prebend in Ely by king Henry the 8. the Mastership of Corpus Christi Colledge (where he was brought v
                     •
                  ) by the election of the fellowes, but commandement of the same king; and lastly the Deanry of Lincolne, with the prebend of Coldingham giuen him by king Edward the sixt. Besides these liuings hée had also the Parsonage of Landbeach foure miles from Cambridge by the gift of the Colledge, whereof he was Master. These liuings hee quietly enioyed the second yeare of Q. Mary, at what time for being married, hée was depriued and liued poorely all the time of her raigne. That terrible fire being extinguished that consumed so many zealous and learned men, and the Archbishopricke left voide by the death of Cardinall Poole, this Mathew Parker then Doctor of Diuinitie, sometime Deane of Lincolne, and Master of Corpus Christi Colledge in Cambridge (as aforesaid) was thought méetest for that high place and preferment. He was consecrate there unto December 17. 1559. by the Bishoppe that lately had béen of Bath, Exceter, Chichester &amp; Bedford,

This man was borne at Saint Bees in Cumberland, fellow first, then Master of Peabrooke Hall in Cambridge, of which Uniuersity he was for one yeere one of the Proctors. A while he was chaplaine vnto Master Rydley Bishop of London, who preferred him vnto the seruice of king Edward the sixt. In the end of which Kings raigne, there was an intent that the said Bishop shold haue bin remoued to Durham, &amp; it was thought that Master Gryndall should succéede him in London. But the death of that good king disturbed the progresse of this platforme, and in stead of the expected honourable aduancement, forced him to a voluntary exile in Germany, where he liued all the

There he safe almost sixe yéeres; &amp; as before is mentioned; was once more translated viz. to Canterbury. Two yéeres before his death he became blinde, and died at Croydon (where also he was buried on the south side of the Chancell) Iuly 6. 1583. béeing 64. yéeres of age, when he had continued Archbishop seuen yéeres and almost a halfe. In the place where hee was borne he founded a free Schoole, which he endowed with thirty pound land. To Quéenes Colledge in Oxford he gaue twenty pound land to maintaine a fellow and two schollers to bée taken out of his said Schoole: Hee gaue them also the greatest part of his books, and 87. ounces of plate, besides forty pound debt which he forgaue them. To Pembrooke Hall in Cambridge, hee gaue two and twenty pound land for the maintenance of a Gréeke lecter, of a fellow and two Schollers, to be likewise taken out of his Schoole. To them he also gaue some bookes, and forty ounces of plate. To Magdalen Colledge in Cambridge hee gaue fiue pound land for one fellow to bée taken from his Schoole: To Christs

Colledge there fiue and forty ounces of plate, To eight little Almeshouses in Croydon fifty pound to be bestowed in land for their reliefe: and lastly to the City of Canterbury an hundred pound of bée imployed vpon a stocke to set the poore on worke.

               AT what time Christian Religion was first publikely receiued in this Island, there were established in the same 28. Sées or Cathedrall Churches, whereof thrée were Archbishopricks, Yorke, whose prouince was Scotland, and the North of England; Caerlegion (now called Caerleon vpon Usk) to which the Churches of Wales were subiect; and lastly London that had iurisdiction ouer the rest of England. To speak of the Archbishops of London (with whom onely wee haue now to do) there is not any precise Catalogue or continuate history deliuered of them. Some I find mentioned sparsim in our histories; their names I will set downe, and the Reader must content himselfe with them.

That charge he attended painefully many yéeres. At last, building a Monastery in the North country called Lestinghen; the same was scarcely finished, when the infection of the plague beeing brought thither, tooke away not onely this Bishop the founder, but almost all his monkes that were now newly placed in the same. Of this man Beda writeth much in his Eccl: history Lib. 3. c. 22. &amp; 23. He died Octo. 26. 664. and was buried in the aforesaid Monastery of Lestinghen.

His owne patrimony he bestowed in building of two Monasteries; one for Monkes at Chertsey, another for Nunnes at Barking, making Edelburg his sister the first Abbesse there. Hee conuerted vnto the faith of Christ Sebba King of the East Saxons: Hee bestowed much vpon building in his Cathedrall Church of Saint Paul, increased greatly the reuenues of the same, and obtained for it of diuers Princes many notable and important priuiledges. Hauing sate 11. yéeres, he died about the yeere of our Lord 685. and after his death was honoured for a Saint. His body was layde in a very sumptuous shrine, which not many yéeres since stoode in the East part of the Church aboue the high Altar.

But the king displaced him, would not suffer him to be consecrate, and bestowed the same vpon one William that was a Norman (as his predecessor was) and came into the realme with Quéene Emma his (I meane the Confessors) mother. Within two yéeres after his preferment, at what time vpon the reconcilation of Earle Godwin with the king, all Normans of any sort were banished the realme; with much adoe, he, with Robert Archbish. of Canterbury, and Vlf, Bishop of Lincolne, got ouer into Normandy, so escaping imprisonment whereunto they were appointed. The other two died there; but William (saith Houeden) for his vertues was soone after recalled; and restored to his Bishopricke. Unto this man the city of London acknowledgeth it selfe greatly beholding, for that king William the Conqueror by his meanes and instant sute, granted vnto them all kind of liberties, in as ample manner as they enioyed them in the time of his predecessor. In thankfulnes héerof the Citizens haue caused to be engrauen this Epitaph vpon his graue (which is in the middle of the body of his Church.)

At the time of the suppression it was valued at 758. pound fiue shilling eight pence. Diuers times he was about to resigne his Bishoprick, that he might become a regular Canon in his owne new built Monastery; and that the rather, because beeing taken with a desperate irrecouerable palsy, he wel knew his time to be short: But he deferred so long the execution of this intent from day to day, that he was suprised by death before he could performe it, viz.

Misliking much the Archbishops pride &amp; obstinacy, he would often exhort him to humility in these words, Ad Zaccheum non diuertisset Dominus ni

                     comoro iam descendisset. Mat. Paris reporteth a strange thing of him (beléeue it if you list) that one night comming from the king, after long conference concerning the businesse betweene the king and the Archbishop: as he lay musing of those things in his bedde, a terrible and an vnknown voice sounded these words in his ears, O Gilberte Foliot, dum reuoluis tot &amp; tot, Deus tuus est Ascaroth. Taking it to be the deuil he answered boldly, Mentiris Daemon, Deus meus est Deus Sabaoth. At what time the King banished certaine fauorites of the Archbishop, that were Cleargy men, hee commaunded this Bishop to receiue the fruites of their liuings into his hand. For obeying the authority of his Prince heerein, the Archbishop excommunicated him. And presently vpon the slaughter of the said Archbishop, the Pope excommunicated him also; but affirming by oath he was not guilty of the murther, he was absolued. Hee died February 18. 1187. It seemeth hee was not onely wise, but (for those times) very learned; Hee writ diuers bookes mentioned by Bale. I finde in Polycraticus, a note concerning him, that

because it expresseth very well an humor vnto which mortal men are much subiect, I thinke not vnnecessary to offer vnto the Reader euen as I finde it. Venerabilis Pater, &amp;c. The reuerend father Gilbert Bishop of Hereford, would sometimes discourse vnto mee (saith he) a certaine guise of Cloyster men, the experience wherof he found in himselfe. When first he entred into the Monastery, hote with the fire newly kindled in him, hee was wont to blame very much the sluggishnesse of his gouernors. Being preferred himselfe, he was still moued with compassion toward his equals; but spared not his betters. Hee became first a Prior; taking part then with Priors, he would complaine of Abbots. Afterwards being made an Abbot, fauouring his fellow-Abbots, hee ceased not to reprehend Bishops. And lastly when he was a Bishop himselfe, he began to sée how much more easie a thing it is to find faults, than to mend them. I thinke not (saith hee) that this Bishop was to be estéemed enuious, but beeing a wise man, hee expressed pretily an affection, as it were naturally engraffed in euery man; and was the more willing to take that kinde of fault vpon himselfe, that he might be the better heard of others. Ioan. Sarisb. Polycrat. lib. 7. cap. 24. A very wise and reuerend Bishop now deceased, in my hearing hath often acknowledged the like humour in himselfe before his preferments, and therefore adiudged it the rather to be borne with all in other men.

In the latter end of his raign he found means to prefer him vnto the Bishoprike of Londō, wherunto he was consecrate Decemb. 31. 1189. Hee bestowed much vpon the building of his Church &amp; other edifices belonging to his Sée, sate there about 9. yéeres, &amp; died Septem. 10. 1198.

This Bishop was one of them that interdicted the whole realme, and excommunicated king Iohn by the commandement of the Pope. They all indured fiue yeeres banishment for their labours, (as elsewhere is more at large declared.) Against this man especially the King was much incensed, and in token of great displesure in the yeere 1211. threw downe to the ground his castle of Stortlord which William Conqueror had giuen vnto the Church. He resigned his Bishopricke Ianuary 26. 1221.

This our Fulco was a gentleman of a great house, but a second brother. After hee had entred orders, his elder brother and the onely sonne of that brother, died within the compasse of a yéer, leauing the inheritance vnto him. Our histories blame him for not beeing forward ynough in the cause of the Barons, that is for béeing too true vnto his Prince: Otherwise, they giue him the praise of a good man, a discréete and vigilant pastor. Questionlesse he was a man stout, and no lesse couragious than his predecessor. The yeere 1255. Rustandus the Popes legate held a conuocation at London, in which when

he went about to lay an importable exaction vpon the Cleargy (and it was knowen the King was hired to winke at it) this Bishop rose vp and openly professed that he would suffer his head to bee chopped off before hee would consent vnto so shamefull and vnreasonable oppression of the Church. Yea when the king stormed at this his resistance, and reuiled him saying, that neither hee nor any of his name was euer true vnto him, threatning moreouer that he would finde meanes to chastise him for it: In the presence of some that hee knew would tell the king of it, he sticked not to say (a spéech I confesse not commendable, but bold and couragious): My Bishoprike indéed, my myter and crosier, the king and the Pope may take away from mee (though vniustly) but my helmet and sword I hope they shall no

               ONe Thomas Langley was then elected Bishop,1404 Henr. 4.6. October 20. following. But the Pope little regarding this election, of his méere authority (according to his manner) bestowed this Bishopricke, December 10. 1404. vpon Roger Walden, that for a time had held the place and authority of Archbishop of Canterbury. Neuer had any man better experience of the variable vncertainty of worldly felicity then he. From the estate of a very poore man, he was suddenly raised to be Treasurer of England (hauing béene first Secretary to the king, Deane of Yorke, and Treasurer of the Towne of Calis) and then made Archbishop of Canterbury. That honor he enioyed not past two yéers, but he was remooued from the same, and forced to leade a priuate life a great while. At last being once more lift vp into a place of honor, he was not suffred to enioy the same any long time; within the compasse of a yéere after he was made Bishop of London, he died, and was buried in the Priory of S. Bartholmewes in Smithfield. Sée more of him in T. Arundell of Canterbury.

                  1407THe Pope had bestowed the Bishopricke of Bathe (by way of prouision) vpon Richard Clifford Archdeacon of Canterbury, the yeere 1401. But King Henry the fourth then newly come to the crowne, being very desirous of preferring another man to that place, assured him, he would neuer giue him possession of his temporalties, yet promised him his fauour in some other matter. Heereupon he was content to let go his hold, and begin a new sute for Worcester, which in the end of the same yeere he easily obtained. There he sate about sixe yeeres; and October 13. 1407. was translated to London. The yeere 1414. hee trauelled to the Counsell of Constance and preached in Latine before the Emperour, and other estates there assembled. In that Councell, the long schisme was ended, and Martin the fift, chosen the sole Pope. The Councel thinking it méete that thirty persons should be added to the Cardinals in this election, this Bishop was one of that number: In which also, there were that named him vnto the Papacy. Himselfe was the first that named the Cardinall Columna; who thereupon, the rest consenting, was immediately elected. He died Aug. 20. 1421. and lieth buried neere the place where the shrine of S. Erkenwald stood toward the South: to witte, hard by the monument of Sir Christofer Hatton.

            THE BISHOPPES OF VVINCHESTER.
            
               THe Cathedrall Church of Winchester (according to a report that I finde in an olde Manuscript) was first built and erected by K. Lucius, who abotlishing Paganisme, embraced Christ he first yéere of his raigne, about the yéere of our Lord, 180. and placing Monkes in the same, allotted for their maintenance large reuenues, which heretofore had belonged for the most part vnto the Flamines and other heathen Priests. This Church (as the same Author sayth) was hallowed and dedicated vnto the honour of our Sauiour, October 29. 189. by Faganus, and Damianus Bishops. About the space of 100. yéers, the Church of Christ had then peace in this land, viz. vntill the raigne of Dioclesian, who endeauouring to roote out Christian Religion, not onely killed the professors of the same, but also pulled down all Churches and Temples, any where consecrate vnto the exercise thereof. Amongest the rest, this of Winchester at that time went to wracke, the buildings thereof being ruinated,

and made euen with the ground, and the Monks and all the officers belonging vnto it, eyther slaine, or enforced to flye for the present time, and yet afterward to deny Christ. This happened Anno 289. Not long after the death of this cruell tyrant, to wit, the yéere, 309. the Church aforesaide was againe réedefled, and that with such wonderful forwardnesse and zeale, as within one yéere and thirty dayes, both it and all the edifices belonging vnto it (as Chambers, and other buildings, for the Monkes and officers) were quite finished in very séemely and conuenient manner. The 15. day of March following, it was againe hallowed and dedicated vnto the honor and memory of Amphibalus (that had suffered death for Christ in the late persecution) by Constans Bishop (as my Author saith) of Winchester, at the request of Deodatus Abbot of this new erected Monastery, 200. yéers and vpwards; it then continued in the same state, to witte, vntill the yéere, 519. at which time, Cerdicke the first King of the West Saxons, being a Pagan, conuerted the church into the Temple of Dagon (sayth the Manuscript aforesaid,) and eyther flow or chased away all the Monks and Ministers of the same. Thus much for the first foundatiō of this church, and the estate thereof, vntill the comming of the Saxons. Now let vs proceede vnto the discourse of the Bishops, that we finde successionely to haue sate in the same.

                  635THe Prouince or kingdome of the Gewisses or West Saxons, containing the West part of England, was gouerned along time by one Bishoppe, that was called the Bishop of the West Saxons. This Country after the Saxons inuaded the same, receiued first the faith of Christ in the time of King Kinigilsus, by the preaching of Byrinus first Bishop, who being a very zealous and denoue man, obtained leaue of Honorius the Pope of Rome to aduenture himselfe in preaching Christ vnto Insfidels. And his promise was, to trauell vuto the most sauage and barbarous people in the furthermost part of this Isle, that amongst them he might sow the séeds of the gespell; whereupon he was consecrated

Bishop by Asterius then Bishop of Genoa. But comming thither, and finding the Country of Gewisses, where he first arriued to be altogether Pagans, and without any knowledge of Christianity, he determined to go no farther to séeke that which euen there he had already met withall. It pleased God so to blesse his labors, that in a short time not only great numbers of the common people, and many of the nobles, but euen Kinigilsus the King himselfe beléeued in Christ, and tooke on them the badge and cogni

Oswald the king of Northumberland was present at what time Kinigilsus receiued this Sacrament, and was his Godfather, being afterwards to become his sonne by the marriage of his daughter. These two Kings appointed vnto Birinus the city of Dorchester for his Cathedrall Sée, where spending his time in preaching, and other pastorall offices (not without great and in

By the helpe of this good Prince he also was restored to his Kingdom againe. His father had pulled downe the Temple of Dagon (as beside the foresaid Manuscript certaine antiquities I haue séene at Winchester do report) and begunne the building of a very faire Church in Winchester, but was taken away by death before he could finish it, and for maintenance of the Ministers

of the same, had allotted all the Country round about within 7. mile of the City. This building Kenwalchus finished, and not onely ratified the foresaid gift of his father, but also himselfe bestowed vpon the same church the mannours of Downton, Alres

The King being giuen to vnderstand of his learning and painfulnesse, praied him to accept the pastoral charge of his country, wherunto he agréed and continued in the same a long time.

               4. Eleutherius.
               THe West Saxons were then a long time without a Bishoppe. In which meane space Kenwalchus perceiuing all things to goe against the haire with him, and nothing to prosper vnder his hand, but crosses and mischances to come thicke, one in the necke of another, (for so indeed it fell out with him, for the particularities whereof I refer the Reader to our Chronicles) he beganne to consider with himselfe, how that by neglecting Religion, he first lost his kingdome, and no sooner embraced Christ, but he was restored to his crown againe; and therefore perswaded himselfe, that his negligence in appointing a Pastor that might looke vnto the seruice of God, was the cause why his worldly affaires had no better successe. Hereupon he sent an ambassador into Franc
                     •
                   vnto Agilbert, to excuse the wrong heretofore done vnto him, and with all earnestnesse to perswade him to returne vnto his former charge there againe. This though Agilbert refused to doe, alleadging that he was bound by promise not to forsake the place he now held: yet that he might shew his readinesse to gratifie the King in what he might; he sent ouer with the Ambassadour a Priest named Elcutherius, his own nephew, that might (if so it pleased him) bee ordained Pastor and Bishop of that Country, testifying, that (for his owne part) he thought him not vnworthy of the place. Hee was honourably receyued of the King and his people, and at their request consecrate Bishop by Theodorus then Archbishop of Cant

               AFter Eleutherius succéeded Headda,
                  673. a very holy and vertuous man, but one that profited more his charge in example of good life and conuersation, then in often preaching vnto them: for (as it should séem) very learned hee was not. Yet (i

               HE dying after he had sate somwhat aboue thirty yéeres; it seemed good to Ina then King of the West Saxons,704. to diuide the Prouince into two parts; whereof the one hee committed vnto a kinsman of his owne called Aldelmus, commanding him to make Sherborne his See, and vnto the other was ordained Daniel; who following the steps of his predecessors, continued at Winchester. Hee was very learned and writ commendably diuers histories, as one concerning his owne Prouince, an other containing Austrialium Saxonum gesta, a. 3. de vita Ceddae Episcopi, and moreouer, de reb. vectae Insulae, and some other discourses. This man sate 43. yéeres, and at last perceiuing himselfe vnable to gouerne by reason of olde age, hee resigned his Bishopricke, an 744. West. and became a Monk a Meldune or Malmesbury, where he died the yéere, 745.

               ABout this time many (as Simon Dunelm, Henry Huntingdon, Rog. Houeden, and other) many I say, suppose Athelwulf or Athulf (that was king of the West Saxons twenty yéeres) to haue béene first Bishop of Winchester by the space of seuen yéers, which in my iudgement cannot well be true. Certaine it is, that béeing in orders, viz. a Subdeacon, and peraduenture elected Bishop, (for so sayth the Abbot of Geruaux, Io. Brampton) by the dispensation of the Pope, he was taken out of the monastery of Winchester to be king; and that is all I find of this matter worthy credit.
            
            
               18. Swithunus.
               AFter Helmstan succéeded (as it seemeth) Swithunus, the opinion of whose holines hath procured him the reputation of a Saint. How miraculously he made whole a basket of egges that were all broken, and some other thinges accounted miracles in our histories, who so list may reade in Matthew Westminster, in his report of the yéere 862. at what time Iuly 2. this Bishop died (&amp; according to his owne appointment) was buried in the churchyard: whatsoeuer his holines was, his learning questionles was great; in respect

whereof Egbert King of the West Saxons committed vnto his gouernment that same Ethelwolfe his yonger sonne that of a Subdeacon in the church of Winchester, was afterward made king, as before is declared. Some there be that say hee was Chancellour of England, wheras that office was not erected till after the Conquest.
            
            
               19. Adferthus.
               
                  863.
                  ADferthus succéeded him in this Bishoprick, a man (saith Florilegus) sufficiently lerned, and that a while discreetly and wisely gouerned this See. It séemeth he was translated to Canterbury, and is remembred in the stories of that Church, by the name of Athelredus.

                  DVmbertus the successor of Adferthus died in the yéere 879. and left his Bishopricke vnto Denewulsus.
               
            
            
               21. Denewulsus.
               
                  879.THis Denewulsus (as the fame goeth) was somtimes a hoggeheard, and dwelt in the place where the Abbey of Athel
                     ••
                  ey in Summersetshire was afterwards builded. It hapned at that time king Alfred (that famous king of the West Saxons) to bée so neere followed of the Danes (that sought nothing more than his life) as being abandoned of all his followers, he knew no better or more likely course for his safety, then (dissembling his estate) to deliuer himselfe for a while into the seruice of this hogheard, dwelling in a place (at that time) almost inaccessible for water, and so of very little or no resort. So long he continued there, as his master and dame were almost weary of his seruice, wherein he was not so ready as a man should that had had education accordingly. Of her it is particularly deliuered, that when the king let certain cakes burn that she had set him to toast, she reprehended him sharpely as an vnprofitable seruant in these words.

               At last it fell out, that the kings friends gathering themselues together, he ioyned himselfe vnto them, and his subiects (that now a great while thought him dead) resorted vnto him in so great numbers, as setting vpon the Danes, he ouerthrew them; and in a short time not only brought them vnder his obedience, but also reduced in a manner the whole Realme of England into one Monarchy. Hauing thus recouered the peaceable possession of his crown, hee was not vnmindfull of his old Master, in whom perceiuing an excellent sharpenes of wit, he caused him (though it were now late being a man growne) to study, and hauing obtained some competency of learning, he preferred him to the Bishopricke of Winchester. Moreouer, that he might shew himselfe thankfull vnto God aswell as man, in the place where this Hogheard dwell, he built a Monastery, the wals whereof are yet partly standing.

Edmund the elder, the occasion whereof is elsewhere set downe. Hée was a man highly estéemed of for his learning, but much more for his great vertue and holinesse. He sate a long time, and at last resigned, procuring one Brinstan to be his successor anno 931. the next yéere after he died, viz. 932.

At his first comming he expelled them out of the old Monastery to place monkes. In the yéere 867. the Danes had slaine all the monkes they could finde in Winchester. From which time, secular Priests inhabited the same (being authorised by the king so to doe) till that the yéere 971. a company of monkes were brought from Abingdon (of the Bishoppes olde acquaintance it is like) to shoulder them out of the doores. Not contented thus to haue replenished his owne Church with monks, hauing bought the Isle of Ely, he played the like rex in that Church (not yet Cathedral) turning along eight honest Priests into the worlde, with their wiues and children, to put in monkes And then at Thorney, hee built new, or at leastwise repaired, an olde monastery that had layen wast many yeares. I may not let passe one commendable action of this bishop, that in time of a great dearth, brake all the plate belonging to his Church, and gaue it to the poore; saying, that the Church might in good time heereafter again be prouided of ornaments necessary, but the poore perished for want of foode, could not be recouered.

Hee was Abbot of Peterborough, and hauing enioyed his deere bought preferment little more then one yeere, he was called from it by death. Euen so it fell out with Elsius for Canterbury, to make the old saying true, ill gotten goods seldome prosper. Kenulphus died anno. 1008.

                  BRithwold (whom Matth. Westm. and Fl. Wigorn séeme to call Ethelwold) was Bishop after Kenulphus. It is written of him, that one night being late at his prayers, hee chanced to thinke of the low ebbe of the bloud royall of England, which now was almost al consumed and brought to nothing. In the middest of this cogitation falling a sleepe, it séemed vnto him hee saw Saint Peter crowning young Prince Edward, that liued in exile at that time in Normandy, and furthermore, to shew how he should raigne 24. yeers, and die at last without issue. The Bishop then (as hee thought) asked him who should raigne next, whereunto this answere was made. The kingdome of England is Gods kingdome, and hee shall prouide a King for it. Some copies of Will. Malmsbury report this vision of Brithwold B: of Wilton, that died anno. 1044. And to say the truth, considering the times wherin both liued, I cannot but much incline to a perswasion that it was rather Brithwold of Wilton then of Winton: As for this man, he died the yéere 1015. Houeden deliuereth that one Alfigus Bishop of Winchester died the yeare 1032. and had for successor Elfwyn. But I estéeme it an error, because I find not elsewere any mention of the foresaid Alfigus. This man died the yéere 1015.

                  ALwyn that then succeeded; was of very great authoritie with Emma the Kings mother, who fauoured him so much, as many suspected them for liuing ill together. Robert
                  
the Archbishop of Canterbury acquainted the king with this rumor. Whereupon the king presently imprisoned Alwyn, &amp; dealt little better with his mother, with whom also he was otherwise offended for allowing him so scantly in time of his minority. Shee seemed to purge her selfe by miracle, effering to walke vpon nine plowshares red hot to prooue her innocency, which she is said to haue performed, and so was restored to the fauour of her sonne againe. Alwyn also was set at liberty; and Robert the Archbishop their accuser (whether for shame or feare I cannot tell) was glad to get him out of the realme. What else is to be deliuered of this Bishop, this his Epitaphe containeth.

                  STigand his successor was chaplaine vnto Edward the confessor,1047 and by him preferred to the Bishopricke of Elmham (whence that Sée was soone after remoued to Norwich) 1043. In the short time he stayed there (not past 4. yeeres) he had much adoo with one Grinketell, that by money found meanes to cast out Stigand and placed himselfe in that Bishopricke. Hee could not keepe his hold long: For Stigand quickly recouered it again, and held it til that the yéere 1047. he was translated to Winchester: from whence also he was remooued to Canterbury in the yéere 1052. But whether he mistrusted his title to Canterbury, Robert the former Archbishoppe beeing yet aliue, or that insatiable couetousnesse prouoked him thereunto, I cannot tell; hee retained still Winchester, notwithstanding his preferment to Canterbury: which was the cause of his vndoing at last. For the Conqueror who came into this realme while he was Archbishop, being desirous to place his owne countrimen in al roomes of

speciall authoritie; and besides hauing a priuate grudge at Stigand for forcing him to yeelde Kentish men their auncient liberties, whereof sée more in Canterbury) procured him to be depriued of both his Bishoprickes vpon this point, that he had contrary to the law held them both together. He lieth intoombed at Winchester with Wyni the first Bishop, inclosed (as it seemeth to mee) with him in the same coffin: vpon the North side thereof is written:

                     Hic iacet Stigandus Archiepiscopus.
                  
He was depriued an. 1069. and died a prisoner in the castle of Winchester shortly after.
            
            
               35. Walkelyn.
               
                  1070 W. Con. 5.SOone after the depriuation of Stigand, Walkelyn a Chaplaine of the kings was consecrate Bishop of Winchester, viz. ann. 1070. He fauoured not monkes, but displaced them where he might, and put in secular Priests in their roomes. Hee died Ianuary 3. 1097. So hée continued Bishop 27. yéeres. In his time, to wit, the yéere 1079. the Cathedrall church of Winchester that now standeth began first to be built.
            
            
               36. William Gifford.
               
                  1107 Hen. 1.8.AT this time, and how long before it is hard to say, lay Princes euery where tooke vpon them to bestow Bishoprickes, giuing inuestiture and possession of them by deliuering the ring and the croster. Pope Gregory the seuenth first withstood Henry the Emperour in this case, and made him at last glad to yeeld vnto canonical elections. King Henry the first taking vnto himselfe the like authority, placed diuers of his chaplaines in Bishoprickes (without election) commanding the Archbishop to consecrate them. Amongest diuers other, he appointed this William Gifford Bishop of Winchester, and required Anselme the Archbishop to giue him consecration, which Anselme vtterly refused to affoord, either vnto him or any other in the like case. The King sent then vnto Girard Archbishop of Yorke, whom hee found nothing

strange. But Giffard (saith Matthew Westminster) timens rigorem Sancti Anselmi, spreuit consecrationem eiuꝰ, stood so much in awe of Saint Anselme, as he durst not but reiect the offer of the others consecration. The king angry hitherto with the Archbishop onely, was now much more incensed against this Giffard, and in great displeasure banished him the realme. In the ende, the king and the Archbishoppe grew to this agréement, that the gifts of the king alreadye passed should bee ratified; and his clerkes nominated to Bishoprickes, haue consecration, vpon promise, that héereafter hee should not disturbe canonicall elections, but vtterly renounce his pretended priuiledge. So after much adoo, hee was consecrate, together with diuers other, an. 1107. Hee founded a Monastery for Cistercian monkes at Wauerly, and a Nunnery at Taunton, whereof the first valued at the suppression in 174. pound, eight shillings thrée pence ob. the other 438 pound, nine shillings ten pence. Moreouer he built the Bishop of Winchesters house in Southwarke, and was a large contributor toward the foundation of the monastery for regular Canons at S. Mary Oueries. Hee sate 21. yéeres, and dying Ianuary 25. 1128. was buried at Winchester in his owne Church: howbeit I se
                     •
                   no memoriall of him there at all.
            
            
               37. Henrie de Bloys.
               AFter the death of Giffard, the king found meanes to prefer vnto his Bishopricke a nephew of his owne Henrie de Bloys Abbot of Glastonbury,1229 Henr. 1.30. being the sonne of his sister Adela, by the Earle of Bloys. A man in regard of his manifold good parts fit and likely enough for the place. For hee was very wise and honest, (though through the mildnes and facility of his nature somwhat vnconstant) and for his learning, diuers of his writings yet extant doe shew it to bee aboue the ordinary pitch of those times. Amongst the rest it is not to be forgotten that he writ a history not yet perished concerning the finding of King Arthurs tombe at Glastonbury, at what time himselfe was Abbot there. Being Legate a latere when his vnkle king Henrie died, although hee with all

other Bishops of the land had sworne fealty vnto Maud the Empresse; yet the being absent in Normandy, the nobility &amp; people much estranged frō her in regard of her mariage which they misliked, and this Bishoppe doubting least some other stopping vp before her arriuall, the kingdome might bee rent away quight from his kinred and passe to some stranger; by vertue of his power Legatine he called a councel of the clergy (who swayed all in those dayes) and drawing Roger Bishop of Salisbury to his party, easily procured his brother Stephen Earle of Boloigne to bee elected King; and the rather because he made extraordinary protestation of defending the Church with all the rites and liberties of the same, to which purpose he was content to take a very straight oath. Howbeit, few yeeres passed before he so far foorth cast behinde him all remembrance of this oath, and the good offices done vnto him by the cleargy, as he seased vpon diuers castles belonging to the Bishops of Salisbury, Lincolne and Ely, spoyling them of whatsoeuer hee found in them, as in the life of Roger of Salisbury you may reade more at large. Whereupon this Bishop by vertue of his power Legatine, called a Councel at Winchester, whereunto the King himselfe was summoned. 
                     •
                  ow that matter was debated there betwéen the Legate and such as the king sent, is to be séene at large in W. of Malmsburie who liued in those dayes, and was an eye-witnesse of much of that which hee reporteth. The issue was no other then a delay for the present: The King would yeeld nothing, and the Legate durst not excommunicate him without the Popes priui
                     •
                  y. Yet the Bishop intending no meanes vnattempted to reduce his brother to that which he tooke to be the right way; taking the Archbishoppe and some other Bishops with him repared vnto him, and putting him in minde of the hath hee had taken; vpon their knees they humbly besought him that he would pitty the Church, his owne soule and his honour
                     •
                   and not to giue occasion of a breach or dissention betweene the kingdome in the Priesthood. Fayre words the King returned vnto them, leauing them in hope of some reasonable satisfaction; which how farre soorth he meant to performe it cannot appeare, because the Bishop of Salisbury of very griefe, (as it is supposed) shortly after died. This vnthankfulnes of his to the Church and Church men which

onely had set him, did so alienate them from him, and séemed so odious vnto most m
                     •
                  n in generall, as presently after the Empresse was able to make her party good against him, tooke him prisoner, and was receaued for Queene of the Legate and great part of the kingdome beside; as of the rest also in likelihood shee had beene, but that her base brother Robert Earle of Glocester (whose valour and wisedome was the principall means of her aduancement) being also taken prisoner by the Kings friends, they were faine to exchange the one for the other; by which meanes the king hauing regained his liberty, both sides were now set euen againe. The Legate then (nature no doubt working in him a desire of his brothers welfare, and pretending a commaundement from the Pope) addicted himselfe altogether to his party; yet so as in the ende hee willingly became a mediator for that peace which made an ende of the controuersie which had now held the land in a ciuill warre for 17. yéeres together. Eustace the kings eldest sonne being dead, it was agréed Stephen should hold the crown during his life, yong Prince Henrie the Empresses sonne should haue Normandy and be declared heyre apparant vnto the kingdome of England after him. In the meane space during the time of these hurliburlies, the city of Winchester was by the Bishops followers spoyled &amp; burnt, (for the greatest part) downe to the ground, together with the Nunry, the monastery of S. Grimbald, &amp; more then 20. other Churches, (some say 40.) This hapned vpon the 2. day of August. 1141. Soone after, by the same men the Nunry of Warwell was likewise spoyled &amp; burnt, &amp; the Bishop himself returning to Winc. took off from the crosse that was burnt in the new Monastery 500. l. of siluer, and 30. marks of gold, 3. crownes with so many seats or thrones of fiue Arabike gold, set with pretious stones. All this he put in his owne purse. Now concerning the monuments of his bounty &amp; liberality, you shall vnderstand, that he founded that worthy hospital of S. Crosse neere Winc. In which place some thing had beene built long before to some such good vse; but it was destroyed by the Danes, and quite ruinated, til he réedified it, or rather laid new foundations in the same place, an. 1132. 
                     •
                  endowed it with the reuenew it now hath. Hée also built the castell of Fernham, (destroyed afterward by king Henry the 3. but reedified

by the Bishops of Winchester) and much increased the meanes of the Nunry of Tatinton, founded by his last predecessor. He was a man as of great bloud, so of a great and high mind. He contended often with the Archbishop of Canterbury for superiority, vnder colour that he was the Popes legate a latere, and (as Matthew Parker deliuereth) a Cardinall. Matthew Westminster reporteth that hee obtained or Pope Lucius the title of an Archhishop, receiuing from him a pall and authority ouer seuen Churches, what they were he nameth not. Walsingham in his Ypodigma saith (which I take to be the truth) that the said Pope onely intended that course and was preuented by death. In the 42. yeare of his consecration he fel sick dangerously: whereof the K. Henry the second hearing, came to visit him: But he was so far from yeelding the king thanks for this great grace, as hee gaue him no looks but frowning, nor speeches 
                     •
                  ut very sharp and curst: reprehending him with very bitter words as the ca
                     •
                  ser of Thomas Beckéts death. Yet such was the great méekenes of this prince, as he not only tooke very patiently this reproofe, but long after thought much of the same. And surely no great maruell. The memory of a dying mans words abideth long: How much more of a Bishop, a graue, wise, and learned prelate? He departed this life August 6. 1171. where he was buried I find not.

                  1174 Henr. 2.21.AFter the death of the former Bishop, the See stood void 3. yeeres: many of her churches likewise at the same time stood long void. At last the yéere 1173, by the instance of two Cardinalls, the king graunted licence of frée election vnto them all. Unto Winchester was then chosen Richard Tocliue Archdeacon of Poytiers, by some called More, by other Richard de Iuelcester: Hee was consecrate at Lambith the yeere following, viz. 1174. together with three other Bishops, Geffery of Ely, Robert of Herford, and Iohn of Chichester: He died saith one Dec. 22. 1187. an other Dec. 21. 1188. and his Epitaph hath 1189. He lieth intombed in the north wall of the Presbytery, iust vnder Wina, where is ingrauen this that followeth.

               40. Peter de la Roche.
               ABout the end of the same yeere, one Petrus de rupib. being a knight,1204 Iohn 6. was consecrate Bishop of Winchester at Rome. A notable wise prelate, and of such authority vnder king Iohn first, and Henry the third after, as none greater in those times. Hee with two other Bishops, viz. Philip his countrey man of Durham (for they were both Pi
                     •
                  tauians) and Iohn Gray of Norwich, animated king Iohn to withstand the Popes excommunication: but they were all faine to cry peccaui at last. The yeere 1214. king Iohn made him chiefe iustice of England: the nobles of the realme grudging very much that a stranger borne, should rule ouer them. After the death of king Iohn, king Henrie beeing a childe, the realm was long gouerned almost altogether by this Bishop. For William Earle Marshall dying, hee was chosen in his roome Protector of the king and realme: And afterwards the King being growne to yeeres of discretion, relyed altogether vpon his counsell. He had a nephew (or as some say a sonne) named Peter d'Oriuall treasurer of England, in maruellous great fauour also with king Henrie. Yet as court fauours are variable; so were they often disgraced and often restored againe to the height of worldly happinesse, I meane the Princes great &amp; entire fauour. The yeere 1226. hee tooke his voyage

to the holy land, &amp; being absent 5. yéers, at his return was receiued with procession and all signes of great ioy. He died Iune 9. 1238. at Farnbam, when hee had sate Bishop the space of 34. yeeres, and was buried (according to his own appointment) very meanely and euen obscurely in his owne church. In his death (saith M Paris) the counsell of England receiued a great wound. What good soeuer hapned vnto the Church, either by peace or warre in the Holy land at the comming of the Emperour Fredericke, it is specially to be ascribed vnto the wisedome of this Bishop. Againe (saith he) when as discord between the Pope &amp; the Emperor threatned the destruction of the whole church; he was the speciall meanes of compounding a peace betweene them. Now of the religious houses he built, and beeing built enriched with reuenewes for their maintenance, these be the names; Edward

Hee made a worthy &amp; memorable will, giuing vnto euery of the asaid places, a huge summe of money: for the least that he gaue was vnto the house of S. Thomas of Acon, vnto which hee bequeathed 500. marks. All this notwithstanding, he left his Bishopricke very rich, his houses furnished, and his grounds ready stocked for successor. Thus much M.

               41. William de Raley.
               THe Sée being thus voide by the death of Peter de rupibus: the king (Henry the 3.) dealt very earnestly with the monks of Winchester,1243 Hen. 3.28. to choose in his place the Bishop elect of Ualentia, the Queenes vncle. But they were agreed vpon W. de Raley; Bishop of Norwitch, and tooke exceptions against the elect of Ualentia, calling him virum sanguinum. When the king heard of their intent, he was exceeding angry and made great hauocke of the Bishops temporalties, swearing, he would haue his will at last, or they should neuer haue Bishop. The monks then seeing him so obstinatly set against the Bishop of Norwitch, determined to altar their purpose, and were content to choose Ralfe Neuil Bishop of Chichester, the kings Chancellor; wherein they were so farre from contenting him, as hee was much more incensed against them then before; and not against them onely, but the new elect also; from whom immediately, hee tooke the great seale and gaue it to another. As for the election, not without great charges, he caused the same to be cassi
                     •
                  ed and made void at Rome. Much adoo there was, for the space of fiue or sixe yeeres about this matter. At last, the monkes seeing no end, and being resolued against the Ualentine; they proceeded to election againe, and chose according to their first determination, the Bishop of Norwich. This election was suddenly made and quickly confirmed at Rome. Yet the king ceased not to spurn at the same, commaunding the Mayor of Winchester to forbid the new Bishop entrance into his city, which he did, and was by him excommunicate for his labor, and the whole city interdicted. In the mean time, the Bishop felt the burthen of the Kings displeasure so heauy vpon him in England, as hee thought good to 
                     •
                  lie the realme. He got him into France, and was honourably receiued of the K. there. At last, by the intercession of Boniface the Archb. &amp; the Popes earnest letters to the King and the Quéene, he was restored to the kings fauor and obtained licence to returne, For recompence of this benefite and his fatherly care, the Bishop (saith Mat. Westm.) in thankefulnesse bestowed vpon the Pope 6000. markes

The payment of this money, and the charges of his trouble stucke so close vnto him, as though he liued very priuately, in all his life long, hee was neuer able to recouer himself out of debt. He died about the twentith day of September, 1249. at Tu

                   that I bee drawne vnto him like a traytor, that in many things haue beene a traytor vnto him. His seruants therefore by his commaundement drew him out of his bed vnto the place where the Priest was, and there with teares hee receiued the Sacrament, and spending much time in prayer, afterward, he so ended his life, when hee had beene Bishop about the space of sixe yeeres: for he was translated, ann. 1243. so that the Sée was voide fiue yéeres.
            
            
               42. Ethelmarus.
               THe King beeing certified of his death, sent immediatelie two of his Chaplaines to Winchester, to perswade the monkes to elect Ethelmarus the sonne of Hugh Earle of March, and Isabell the Quéene his mother; so that hee was halfe brother vnto the king; a man (saith M. Paris) in respect of his orders, yeeres, and learning, vtterly vnsufficient. By that time they had labored the matter the space of a fortnight the king himselfe came vnto Winchester, and in the Chapter house made a most earnest request in the behalfe of the same his brother. The monks too wel remēbring what great trouble &amp; sorrow they had endured for denying the kings last request; some of them beaten and sore wounded, many tormented with hunger, and laden with chaines, in long imprisonment, besides continuall charges, of sutes and trauell, and knowing wel they should haue no assistance at Rome, so long as the Kings purse was better then theirs: they resolued (though they knew the man most vnfit) to gratifie the king;

and so, no man daring to say no, with one consent he was elected. He had at that time other spirituall liuing equiualent in reuenue to the Archbishopricke of Canterbury, which that he might kéepe, and yet receiue all the profits of the Bishoprick of Winchester; he determned not to be consecrate at all, but to hold it by election, and so did indéede, for the space of 9. yéeres. In the meane time, he and the rest of his countrymen (with w

This fact and other like brought al the Pictauians into such hatred as the realme was ready to rise against them: which perceiuing, to auoid the tempest growing towards them, the yéere 1268. they all fled Ethelmar sent ouer for his treasure, wherof he had laid v

                  d to consent vnto their election, alledging his owne vnwoorthinesse for want of learning. The king was content to allow of him, conditionally, that some stay might be made for a time to sée whether his brother Ethelmar might

No man so forward as he in taking part with Isabel the Queene against her husband king Edward the second. Shee with her sonnes and army being at Oxford, this good Bishop stept vp into the pulpit, and there taking for his text these words (My head grieueth me) he made a long discourse to proue, that an euill head, not otherwise to be cured, must be

taken away. Hauing gotten the King into their power, he fearing least if the king at any time recouered his liberty and crowne againe, they might receiue condigne punishment; counselled the Queene to make him away. Whereunto she being as ready and willing, as he to haue it done, they writ certaine letters vnto the keepers of him (the olde King) signifying in couert tearms what they desired. They either not perfectly vnderstanding their meaning, or desirous to haue somewhat to shew for their discharge, pray them in expresse words to declare vnto them, whether they would haue them put the king to death or no.

I finde also recorded, that hee was wont to be called sometimes by the name of Long; and that (as it is probably supposed) for no other cause, but in regard of his stature, which they say was very tall. Hee was brought vp

In these places (hauing first passed the Rudiments of Grammer) hee studied Logicke, Geometry, Arithmetique, and the French tongue; but principally the Ciuill and Canon lawes. In all which as he profited exceedingly for the time he spent in thē; so there is no doubt hee would haue prooued so excellent as men are wont, that doe long and painfully imploy good wits to such purposes, had he not beene euen as it were violently drawen from them when his abode and continuance in the Uniuersity might seem most requisite. His Patrone and exhibitioner being appointed Constable of Winchester castle (an office of great importance in those dayes) he made choyce of this his yoong scholler to serue him as his clerke or secretary, &amp; so tooke him from the Uniuersity, when hee had as yet

By reason whereof he was often imployed in writing letters, yea and sometimes in messages also to the Court; not onely by his master, but by the Bishop, that a while vsed to borrow him of his master, and at the last drew him to his seruice.

It shall not be amisse to remember, how that hauing obtained diuers goodly promotions, which (in modesty peraduenture) hee acknowledged to haue receiued rather as rewardes of seruice, then in regard of any extraordinary desert otherwise; hee caused to be engrauen in Winchester Tower at Windsor, these words, (This made Wickham.)

In this greatnes of his authority, the king found two notable cōmodities, one, that without his care al things were ordered so well, as by a wise and trusty seruant they might; the other, that if any thing fell out amisse, wheresoeuer the fault were, hee had opporunity to cast all the blame vpon the Bishoppe of Winchester.

               THe Pope was now growne to that height of tyranny, that he not onely placed,1405 Hen. 4.5. but displaced Bishops at his pleasure. And his meanes to doe it, was by translating them to some other Bishopricke, peraduenture of lesse value and peraduenture nothing worth at all. So was Alex. Neuill perforce translated from Yorke to Saint Andrews in in Scotland, whence (wars being at that time between England and Scotland) he was sure neuer to receiue penny. And so he translated Iohn Buckingham from Lincolne to Lichfield, a Bishopricke not halfe so good. But he choosing rather to haue no bread, th

To his Bishopricke of Lincolne was then preferred Henrie Beaufort (sonne to Iohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, by Katherine Swinford) the yéere 1397. He was brought vp for the most part at Aken in Germany, where he studied the ciuill and canon law many yéeres (but spent much time also at Oxford) and comming home, was preferred to Lincolne very young.

King Henry the fift in the latter end of his raigne, by great and continuall warres, being waxen much behinde hand, and greatly indebted; began to cast a couetous eye vpon the goods of the Church, which at that time were growne to the full height; and there wa

                  ted not many that incited him vnto the spoile of the same. This wealthy Prelat (best knowne by the name of the rich Cardinall) supplyed his want out of his owne purse, to diuert him from that sacrilegious course, and lent him 20000. pound, a great deale of money in those dayes. He was also valiant and very wise. Pope Martin the fift, determining to make war vpon the Bohemians that had renounced

                   all obedience the Sée

of Rome, made this Cardinall his Legate into that country, and appointed such forces as he could make to be at his commandement. Toward the charges of this voiage, the Clergy of England gaue a tenth of all their promotions, and furnished out 4000. men and more. With this power he passed by France (doing there some seruice for his Prince and Country) into Bohemia, the yéere, 1429. There hée remayned certaine monethes, behauing himselfe very valiantly, till by the Pope he was discharged. In his youth he was wantonly giuen, and gate a base daughter named Iane vpon Alice the daughter of Richard Earle of Arundell. Her he
                     •
                   married after vnto Ed. Stradling or Easterling a knight of Glamorganshire. But this was done, before he entred into orders. Toward his latter end he imployed his time altogether either in matters of counsell and businesse of the common wealth, or the seruice of God and the Church committed vnto him. Amongst other good déedes it is remembred that he built an Hospitall in Winchester néere to Saint Crosses, which he presently endued with land to the value of 158. l. 13. s. 4. d. of yéerely rent, and moreouer, gaue vnto it the hospitall of S. Iohn de Fordingbridge. In it was to bée maintained, a Master, 2. Chaplaines, 35. poore men, and thrée women. He died Aprill 11. 1447. when hee had béene Bishop of Winchester 43. yéeres, and from the time of his first consecration fifty yéeres. Except Thomas Bourchier that was Bishoppe fifty one yeeres, I reade of no Englishman that euer enioyed that honour longer. Hée lieth buried in a reasonable stately toombe behinde the high Altar of his Church at Winchester toward the South. The inscription is much

Neither was he any thing at all deceiued in him; For the matter was followed with so great diligence &amp; industry, as in a very short time all things were dispatched according to the Earles desire, who soone after obtaining the kingdome, mindfull of the good seruice done him by Doctor Foxe, preferred him immediatly vnto the kéeping of the priuy seale made him Secretary &amp; one of his Councel, &amp; laid vpon him what spirituall liuing might possibly be procured him.

                  lind before he died. Wherby ghessing his end not to bee far off, he determined to make vnto himselfe friends of the vnrighteous Mammon, bestowing well his goodes while he liued. And first he was purposed to haue built a monastery vntill that consecring with Hugh Oldham Bishop of Exeter a very wise man: Hee was aduised by him rather to bestow his money vpon the foundation of some Colledge in one of the Uniuersities, which should bee more profitable vnto the common wealth, and more auaileable to the preseruation of his memory. As for Monasteries (quoth he) they haue more already, then they are like long to kéepe. So by the counsel of this wise Prelate (whose purse also was a great helpe to the finishing thereof) the colledge of Corpus Christi in Oxford was built, anno 1516, and endued by the said founder with possessions, to the yéerely value of 401. l. 8. s 11. d. Afterward in the yéere 1522. he bestowed the cost of building a faire frée schoole by the castle in Taunton (where the B. of Winchester hath a goodly Lordship) and conuenient housing néere it for the Schoolemaster to dwell in: the like he performed at Grantham also, in which place it is probable hee might bée borne: lastly, it is to be remembred, that he couered the quier of Winchester, the Presbytery and Isles adioyning with a goodly vault, and new glased all the windowes of that part of the Church. It is said also that he built the partition betweene the presbytery and the said Isle, causing the bones of such Princes and Prelates as had bane buried here and there dispersed about the church, to be remoued and placed in seemely monuments vpon the toppe of that new partition. Many other notable things no doubt he did which haue not come vnto my knowledge. He was brought vp in Pembrooke hall in Cambridge (vnto which house hee gaue certaine hangings) and died a very olde man, anno 1528. when he had worthily gouerned the church of Winchester the space of 27. yéeres. He lieth entombed vpon the south

side of the high altar in a monument, rather sumptuous then stately, of the same building with the partition.

For the extreame malice hee bare to our religion, hee not onely burnt many poore men, but wrought all the means his wily head could deuise to make away our late Soueraigne

Quéene Elizabeth: saying often, it was in vaine to strike off a few leaues or branches when the root remained whole. And surely in all reason his cursed policy must haue preuailed, if God had not touched the heart of Quéene Mary her sister with a very kind and naturall affection toward her: which notwithstanding, it is much to be doubted what he might haue wrought in time, had not God in mercy taken him away the more spéedily. He dyed at White-Hall, Nouember 12. 1555. of the goute, being (according to the common saying of men affected with that disease) very rich, leauing behind him 40000. markes in ready money (if Bale say true) beside much sumptuous houshold stuffe.

                  1109 Hen. 1.10.BY this time the reuenues of the monastery were grown to be very great. Their yeerely receipt was not so little as 1400. pound, which summe contained then more mettall, and would go farther in those daies then 6000. pound of our money. Of that 1400. pound, the Abbot allowed scarc

                     •
                   pretences for his ambition. He caused the king to be told, that the Dioces of Lincolne was too large for one mans gouernement: that Ely were a fit place for an Episcopall Sée, &amp;c. These reasons amplified with golden Rhetoricke, so perswaded the king, as he not only consented himselfe that this monastery should be conuerted into a Cathedrall Church, and the Abbot made a Bishop; but also procured the Pope to confirme and allow of the same. After that Richard the Abbot had with great paines and more cost, beaten this bush a great while, the bird that hee had so long and earnestly thirsted after, fell to another mans share. Himselfe was taken away by death when the matter was growen to good perfection and ready to bee finished. The Bishop of Lincolne a while hindred the proceeding of this busines; but his mouth was stopt with three Mannors which the king being liberall of another mans purse, was content to bestow vpon him, such as heeretofore belonged vnto the monastery of Ely, viz. Spaldwich; Bicklesworth, and Bokeden: these were giuen

to the Sée of Lyncolne in recompence of the losse the Bishop sustained by exempting of Cambridgshire from his iurisdiction: And that the reuenues of the new Bishop might notwithstanding this gift be no lesse then the Abbots were, but rather greater, they diuised to diminish the number of monks which were then 70. and to draw them down vnto 40. Richard the 11. and last Abbot being thus taken away when hee would most gladly haue liued: K.

                   vnto her, and endured much for her sake. See more héereof in the life of Roger Bishop of Salisbury. Notwithstanding those his great troubles, he found meanes to erect an hospitall for Regular Cannons, in that place where Saint Iohns Colledge in Cambridge

now standeth: the foundation of which house was afterwards twise altered, first by Hugh Norwald his successor, who placed therein a certaine number of schollers to cohabite with the Cannons, giuing allowance for their maintenance: and afterwards by Margaret Countesse of Richmond and Darby, who new built it, partly in her life time, and partly by her executors after her death, endowing it with (in a manner) all the reuenues it possesseth, and raising it vnto that beauty and perfection which now it hath. This man was Bishop 36. yeeres, and died the 29. day of May 1169. hauing long before séene the issue of his Lord and first patrone king Henry restored to the crowne in Henry the 2.

When the king tooke that his famous voyage to Hierusalem he made this Bishop (Chauncellor before) chiefe Iustice of the South part of England, and Protector of the Realme in his absence.

It is a true saying Magistratus indi

Officers appointed by the King himselfe he discharged; Geoffry Archbishop of Yorke the kings bastard brother, at his first arriuall in England after his consecration, he caused to be apprehended and drawne from the very Aulter of the Church of Saint Martins in Douer vnto prison. Iohn the Kings brother, and afterwards king him selfe, hée sought to kéepe vnder and disgrace by all meanes possible, beeing iealous (as hee saide) least the king dying without issue, hee should defraude

Now he that feared not to deale thus with the kings owne brother, no maruell if he vsed such of the nobility farre worse that in any sort opposed themselues against him.

Officers placed by the king hée said hée discharged, least the people being gréeued with so many gouernours would complain, that insteed of one king they now were constrained to obey many. What reason he yéelded of his dealing with Earle Iohn you heard before. Concerning the Arbishop of Yorke, he affirmed (and it was true) that the king before his departure, had not only forbidden him to set foote in England within 3. yeares after, but had bound him with an oath to that effect: Howbeit he offered to depose (as afterwards indeed he did) that hée neuer gaue direction for the apprehension of the Archbi. So saith Roger Houeden. As for his exactions he said they were but such as the maintenance and incredible charge of so great a warre as the king had then in hand required: and lastly, for a generall defence, he protested hee had not taken any course in these or any other matters of importance, for which he had not some particular direction from the king.

But before the publication of this election one Robert of Yorke was also chosen, who held the temporalties of the Bishopricke without consecration, and disposed of benefices that fell, and all things belonging to the Sée as Bishop, for the space of fiue yéeres. The Pope at last disanulling both these elections, conferred the Bishopricke, vpon Iohn Abbot of Fountney a iust &amp; vertuous man, who was consecrated March 8. 1219.

He was chaplaine vnto the king, a councellor of speciall credit with him, and (as the booke of Ely reporteth, I find it no where else) Chancellor of England. A goodly man of person, well spoken, very wise and learned in the lawes. Hee enioyed that preferment a small time. Beeing sent Ambassador into Spaine, hee died there vpon S.

perswade them thereunto But they proferring their owne knowledge before the kings commendations, the 13. day of Nouember, made choise of Hugh Balsam or de Bedesale (for so also I find him called) their Subprior, one (as they perswaded themselues) most fit for the place. Hereat the king being greatly displeased, refused to accept of their election, and caused the woods of the Bishopricke to bee cut downe, the parks to bee spoyled, and hauocke to be made of all things. Many times he vrged them to a new election, telling them it was not fit, that a place of that strength should be committed vnto a simple cloyster man, that had neuer beene acquainted with matters of state. The new elect therefore got him ouer the sea to Rome, hoping there to obtaine that which in England would not be affoorded him

This Adam was a man of great learning, and had written diuers bookes much commended. But he was a very aged man, and moreouer a frier minor and therefore one that had renounced the world, and all medling in worldly matters: which notwithstanding he followed gladly the directions of the Archbishop, and was well content to haue béene a Bishop before he died. As for Henrie Wingham the Chauncellor, it is said that he neuer stirred at all in the matter, but confessed them both more woorthy of the place then himselfe. It is said likewise, that the sute in his behalfe was first commenced by the king without his knowledge, and that when hee saw the king so earnest and deale so violently in it, hee went vnto him and humbly besought him to let alone the monkes in the course they had begun, and to cease farther solliciting of them by his armed and imperious requests: for (saith he) after inuocation of the name of God, the grace and direction of his holy spirit, they haue chosen a man more woorthy then my selfe; And God forbid that I should as it were inuade by force that noble Bishoprick, and vsurpe the ministery of the same, with a

                  ld not agree within themselues; one part (and the greater) made choyce of Iohn their Prior, the rest of Iohn Langton Chancellour of England. This election being examined before the Archbishoppe, and iudgement by him giuen for the Prior, the Chancellour appeales vnto the Pope, and trauelled to Rome in his owne person. The Prior bearing of his iourney, highed him after as fast as hee might, neither was hee long behind him, although many blocks were cast in his way. Being there, they were perswaded to resigne all their interest into the Popes hand. He then in fauour of the Couent set down this order, that they should be at liberty (Notwithstanding these elections) to choose againe, so they chose any one Abbot in England, except three, to wit, of Westminster, Bury and Saint Augustines: they belike were not in the Popes fauour. The Proctors of the couent they would not agree to this order, so fauourable for them. Wherfore the Pope being very angry, vpon his own absolute authority remoued Ralph Walpoole from Norwich vnto Ely, gaue Norwich vnto the Prior; and lest the Chancellor should altogether loose his labour, he made him Archdeacon of Canterbury in the place of Richard Feringes that was then appointed by him Archbishop of Dublyn This Ralfe Walpoole was consecrate Bishop of Norwich in the beginning of the yéere 1288. and sate there 11. yeeres.

But it is very like, his purse holpe him well in his sute: for it is remembred, that he came home indebted no lesse then the sum of 15000. l.

Edw. 3.19. being then chosen Bishop, his election was disanulled and pronounced voide by the Pope, Clement 5. who explenitudine potestatis, without any more adee, thrust into his place Thomas Lylde a Frier preacher, and caused him to bée consecrate at Auinion in the moneth of Iuly, 1344. Hée was a Doctor of Diuinity, brought vp in Cambridge, and much esteemed for his learning. He preached often with great commendation, and writ diuers works mentioned by Bale. Within a yéere or two before his death he endured great trouble and persecution by the means of the Lady Blanch Wake, a neer kinswoman of the Kings, the circumstance of which businesse it shall not be amisse briefly to set downe. This Lady had certaine lands neere vnto one or two of the Bishoppes houses, by reason of which neighbourhoode, many controuersies dayly arose between them concerning bounds and other such like matters. The Bishoppe was a rough and plaine man, hardly brooking such indignities as it is likely a woman of that Nobility, rich, and néere of kinne vnto the King, would bee ready inough to offer. By reason here of the Lady conceiued a deadly and inueterate malice against him: for wreaking whereof, shee awaited this oportunity. The Pope at the request of the King (or rather the Blacke Prince his sonne) had suffered one Robert Stretton to bee consecrate Bishoppe of Lichfield; a man in many respecte

The time being come when the matter was to be determined in the Assises at Huntington, the Lady found a meanes to hinder the Bishops proceedings by corrupting the officers, who denied him the copie of the former iudgement, without which nothing could be done. Beeing much grieued herewith, hee went vnto the King, and complained how he was oppressed; requesting him as hee was the guide, and

Some things the king laide to his charge he denied, and extenuated the rest what he might.

So he was condemned by Parliament, and this punishment laid vpon him, that hereafter he should neuer presume to come in the kings presence.

This the Bishop taking as an argument, that the Archbishop was fearefull to doe him iustice, for doubt of displeasing the King, he resolued to haue recourse vnto the Pope; to whom repayring, he declared all the circumstances

The Bishoppe of Lincolne was commanded to denounce this excommunication (which he did vnto his great trouble) and also, that if any of the excommunicate were dead, he should cause them to be digged out of their graues, and forbid them buriall in holy earth. This peremptory dealing of the Pope mooued the king vnto great choller: for diuers of those that were excommunicate, were persons of no small account; som of them of his Priuy Councell. Proclamation therfore was made throughout the Realme, that vpon paine of death, no man should hereafter be so hardy as to bring into the realme any kind of writing from the Popes Court. Some notwithstanding contrary to this prohibition, deliuered letters to the Bishoppe of Rochester (then Treasurer of England) from the Pope concerning this matter, and fearing the worst had armed themselues.

How bée it, some report, that order being taken by Parliament about this time for the ratifying of capitular elections, &amp; stopping the iniurious prouisions of the Pope, that this Thomas Arundell was chosen orderly, and consecrate at Otford by the Archbishop William Witlesey, April, 6. 1375.

Following thus his study, and profiting excéedingly therein, he grew very famous, and no maruell, for to sée a Gentleman of great lineage, hauing maintenance at will, to become very learned, especially in Diuinity, is in deede a wonder, and seldome seene.

He sate there but three yeeres and a halfe, and dying, August, 25 1505. was buried betwéene two pillers on the North side of the Presbytery, where wée see a very stately toombe of frée stone welt built. He was very liberall vnto the poore. His manner (they say) was, in trauelling to giue vnto euerie poore person that demanded Almes of him a péece of money, sixe pence at least; and le

Hee was made Bishoppe the yéere 1506. and enioyed that preferment eight yeeres and a halfe; of which time hee spent very little or none at Ely: But liued all the Summer time at Somersham, keeping company much there with a certaine woman in very offensiue manner; and all the winter he would bee with his brother in Darbishire. So drowned in pleasures, hee passed his time without doing any one thing worthy commendation or remembrance, and died in the beginning of the yeare 1515.

For abroad hee was often imployed in embassages to forraine Princes, and at home, after he had beene of the priuy Councell a while vnto King Edward the sixt of that name, he was made at last high Chancellor of England. Whether hee were more deere vnto his Prince for his singular wisedome, or more beloued of the commonalty for his integrity and abstinence, it is euen very hard to say.

Hee was consecrated Decem. 19. 1540. the yéere 1550. remooued to Norwich, and within fower yéeres after, by Quéene Mary hee was not onely aduanced vnto the Bishopricke of Ely, but also made of her priuy Councell. After her death, for resisting obstinately the reformation intended by Quéene Elizabeth; he was committed to the tower, and displaced from his Bishopricke by act of parliament. Hauing endured a time of imprisonment, neither very sharpe nor very long; his friends easily obtained licence; for him, and the late secretary Boxal, to liue in the Archbishops house, where they had also the company of Bishop Tunstall till inch time as he died. The Archbishoppe intreated them all most kindly, as considering no doubt the variablenes of this mutable world, how possible it was for God, that so lately had set him vp, to cast him down, as he had done those men. He liued in this sort the space of 10 yeres and vpwards, taking more pleasure (I assure my selfe) in this time of his imprisonment (for so some men will néeds estéeme it) then euer héeretofore in the middest and fullest streame of his highest honors.

                  1070 W. Con. 5.THe last Bishop of Dorchester and first of Lincolne, was Remigius, a monke of Feschamp the sonne of a Priest. Unto this man William the Conquerour (for diuers good seruices done vnto him) had promised long before, a Bishopricke in England, if it should please God to send him victory. He was as good as his word, and the yeere 1070. preferred him to Dorchester, voide by the death of the former Bishop. The consideration of this gift comming to the Popes eare, he would néeds adiudge it symony, and as a Symonist actually depriued him of his Bishopricke: But at the request of Lanfranke the Archbishop of Canterbury, he restored him to his ring and crosyer againe. Soone after his preferment, hée began to build at Dorchester, and intended great matters there. But order being taken in a Conuocation at London by the kings procurement, that Episcopall Sées euery where should be remoued from obscure townes to greater cities, he diuerted the course of his liberality from Dorchester to Lincolne. Lincolne at that time (saith William Malmsbury) was one of the most populous cities of England, of great resort and traffique both by sea and land. Remigius therefore thinking it a fit place for a Cathedrall Church, bought certaine ground vpon the top of the hill néere the castle then lately built by William the conquerour, and began the foundation of a goodly Church. The Archqishop of Yorke Thomas hearing of this designement, forbid him to proceede in that course, alleadging that Lincoln, Stow and Newarke were not onely of his Prouince and Dioces, but of the possessions of his Archbishopricke. This allegation, though friuolous, was an occasion of great charge vnto the Bishop, who was faine to worke the king to be a meanes of cleering that title, for which he gaue him (as saith Huntingdon) no lesse then 5000 pound. The fabrike of the Church beeing now finished, and 21. prebends founded in the same, all which hee furnished with Incumbents very wel esteemed of both for lea
                     •
                  ning and conuersation; He made great prouision for the dedication of this his new Church, procuring all the Bishops

of England by the kings authority to be summoned therunto. The rest came at the time appointed, which was May. 9. 1092. Onely Robert Bishop of Hereford absented himselfe, foreséeing by his skill in Astrology, that Remigius could not liue vnto the day prefixed, which also he foretold long before. It fell out (according vnto his prediction) that Re
                        •
                     igius died two daies before the time appointed for this great solemnity. Hee was buried in that his owne new built Church. This Remigius was a man, though of so high and noble a mind, yet so vnreasonable low of stature, as hardly he might attaine vnto the pitch and reputation of a dwarfe: So, as it seemed, nature had framed him in that sort; to shew how possible it was that an excellent minde might dwell in a deformed and miserable body. Besides this worthy foundation at Lincoln, he réedified the Church and Abbey at Stowe, as also the Abbey of Bardney. By his perswasion king William the conquerour erected the Abbeyes of Cane in Normandy, and Battell in Sussex vpon the very place where hee had ouerthrowne king Harold in battel, and so made a passage vnto the conquest of the whole land. Huntindon reporteth that he had béene accused of treason, but purged himselfe thereof by one of his men by walking vpon red-hote yron, and so was not onely acquitted, but restored to the kings fauour againe. The superstitious and credulous posterity ascribe diuers miracles vnto the holinesse of this Bishop, wrought (not in his life time
                     •
                   but) many years after his death. This is the report of Malmsbury (beside some other) concerning the foundation of this Church. And me thinks it were hard but he should know the truth, being a man that liued in those daies. Howbeit I hold it not fit to conceale, what I find in Matth. Paris touching the same matter. Where (saith he) before the conquest the Episcopall sée that is now at Lincolne being then at Dorchester; according vnto the demerits of the Bishop then gouerning, not onely he was depriued by the Pope, but the place it selfe also accursed; of so memorable an accident: after many yéeres there remained no memoriall, and so the country continued long without either Bishop or Bishopricke. At last it came to passe that Wil. Rufus hauing throwen downe many Churches in the new Forrest, &amp; becomming penitent,

for the same he determined in recompence thereof not onely to restore that noble Bishopricke to his former state, but to increase the same, and to remooue it to a more conuenient place. Wherefore hauing gotten, either by purchase or exchange, certaine land, from a noble man, one M. Gaunt, that came into England with his Father the Conqueror, and had the same bestowed vpon him for his seruice; Hee the saide William the second founded the Cathedral Church, which is now at Lincoln. Which being finished, he sent for two Cardinalls, who brought with them all ample authority from the Pope, for the ordering of that Church and Bishopricke; and calling together eight Archbishops beside 16. other Bishops, he caused the saide Church to be hallowed with exceeding great solemnity, secular Canons to be placed in the same and their rents and seuerall portions to be distinguished and set out, that vnder their Bishop and Deane they might liue in good sort, &amp;c. Thus farre Math. Paris, in his report of the yeare 1241. Where hee recordeth the history of a great contention betwéene the Bishop and the Chapter concerning iurisdiction. And this I thinke indeede was rather an allegation of the Chapter then the narration of any indifferent writer of former times. And therefore for mine owne part I giue no c

                  1092. Wi. Ruf. 6.IT happened soone after the death of Remigius, the King (William Rufus) to fall dangerously sick at Glocester: And thinking he should die, begā seriously to repent him of his dissolute &amp; vicious life forepassed: Especially, he shewed great griefe for his simony &amp; sacrilegious oppression of the Church and Cleargy men. In this good mood he bestowed the Archbishopricke of Cant. (hauing kept it void 4. yéeres) vpon Saint Anselm; &amp; Lincolne vpon Robert Bloet or Bluet his Chauncellor. When he recouered, he much repented his repentance wished they were in his hands againe, &amp; fell to his olde practises as busily as euer heeretofore. This Robert Bloet was a man passing wise, liberall, affable, curteous and very personable, but vnlearned, light of behauior, &amp; much giuen to lust. Bale reporteth hee had a sonne named Simon (base borne no

doubt) whom he made Deane of Lincolne. He dedicated his Church; bestowed very much in furnishing the same with ornaments requisite. Unto the 21. Prebends founded by his predecessor he added 21. more, and very largely endued) or as some deliuer, founded) the Abbey of Eynsham besides Oxford, vnto the which monastery hee remooued the monkes of Stow. Again he bestowed the mannor of Charlton vpon the monkes of Bermondsey, and gaue vnto the king 500, l. (as Stubbes saith 1000. or as H. Huntingdon hath 5000.) to cléere the title that the Archbishop of Yorke laide vnto the iurisdiction of his Sée. He was consecrate the yéere 1092. sate almost 30. yéers, and dich at last suddenly Ianuary 10. 1122. Riding by the kings side talking with him néere Woodstocke he shranke downe spéechlesse, and be

                  ROger that famous Bishop of Salisbury,1123. Hen. 1.25. was now so great a man with the K. (Henry the first) as being able to do with him what he list, he easily intreated him to bestow the Bishopricke of Lincolne vpon one Alexander his owne brothers sonne, a Normane borne, whome not long before he had made Archdeacon of Salisbury, and chiefe Iustice of England. Hee was consecrate at Canterbury Iulie 22. 1123. The next yeere after, his Cathedrall Church so lately built, and yet scarcely finished, was burnt and horribly desaced by casuall fire. He repayred it againe, and added vnto it a speciall ornament, a goodly vault of stone, which before

it had not, and therefore was the more subiect vnto 
                     ••
                  re. He also increased the number of his Prebends, and purchased vnto his church certaine mannors and other lands. But his chiefe delight was in building of castles, wherein he imitated his vncle the Bishop of Salisbury. This humor was the vndoing of them both. To leaue the other vnto his owne place, Alexander built a stately castle at Banbury, another at Newarke, and a third at Sleford. Newbrigensis reporteth that he also founded two monasteries, whereof one was Hauerholm for white Canons and Nunnes, valued at the suppression in 88. pound fiue shillings fiue pence, the other was S. Maries in Tame for white monks, valued at 256. pound, 13 shillings senen pence halfe penny, yéerely reuenue. His Castles were such eye-sores vnto king Stephen, as they prouoked him to picke a quarrell otherwise vnto the Bishops, to clappe them vp in prison (where the other died) and to bereaue them at once of these munitions and all their treasure, whereof they had hoorded vp great store. They that kept the castle of Newark refused to deliuer it at the kings summons, till such time as the Bishop intreated them to yéeld, signifying (and it was true indéede) that the king had sworne hée should neither eate nor drinke before hee had possession of the castle. Hereupon they set open the gates vnto the king, and then with much adoo hauing lyen by it certaine months, hee was at last released of his imprisonment. After that, perceiuing the vanity of his former course, hee gaue himselfe wholly to building and aduancing the state of his Church, performed that which before I haue expressed, and so made it simply the most beautiful Church of England at that time. Hee was twice at Rome, to witte, the yéeres 1142. and 1144. where he behaued himselfe so, as hee pleased both the king and the Pope very well. The first time hee was there, the Pope gaue him authority to call a conuocation as his Legate, and especially commended vnto him the redresse of certaine enormities; for the effecting whereof he caused diuers canons to be made thought very necessary for those times. A 3. iourney he made vnto the Pope, lying then in France, in the moneth of August 11.17. where, through immoderate

heat of the weather during the time of his trauel he fell sicke, and with much adoo getting home, not long after his returne died, hauing sate Bishop about the space of 24. yeares. I find in Henrie Huntingdon certaine verses written in commendation of him which I thinke not amisse heere to be inserted:

                   Being yet scarce warme in his seate, the Archbishopricke of Roan was offered vnto him, a place of much higher dignity, but of lesse Reuenues then Lincoln a great deale. See the power and force of ambition, that could prouoke this man, notably

couetous, to forsake riches, and content himselfe with a place of farre lesse wealth, but a little more honourable. Hee was translated to Rean the next yeere after his comming to Lincolne, viz. 1184.

               TWo yéeres after the departure of Walter to Roan,1186. Hen, 2.34. the See of Lincolne continued voide. Upon Saint Matthewes day 1186. one Hugh the first Prior of the Charterhouse monkes at Witteham in Sommersetshire was consecrate Bishop of the said Church. This Hugh (who by his integrity of life and conuersation, and the opinion of diuers myracles wrought by him, hath purchased vnto himselfe the honour and reputation of a Saint) was borne in a City of Burgundy, called Gratianopolis. By the aduise and direction of his Father, (who hauing buried his wife, had made himselfe a regular Cannon) hee also entered the same profession being yet very young: But waxing elder, he be took himselfe afterwards vnto the straight and seuere orders of the Carthusians or Charterhouse monkes (as we commonly call them.) In that kind of life he not only obserued al things requisite by the rule of their order, but so farre surmounted the same in performing much more then it required, as hee grew very famou

With much adoo he assented, and came ouer with the Bishop. The king (who for the opinion hee had of his holinesse, vsed often priuately to conferre with him) remembring how great wrong hee had done the Church of Lincolne in so long keeping it without a Bishop, determined to make amends by giuing them a good one at last, and procured this Hugh before he vnderstood of any such thing toward, to be elected Bishop of that Sée. Hée gouerned very stoutly and with great seuerity, yet so, as hée

was more reuerenced and loued then feared. His excommunications were very terrible vnto all men, and the rather, for that it was noted (as I find deliuered) some notable calamity otherwise did lightly follow them. His Church of Lincoln he caused to be all now built from the foundation, a great and memorable worke, and not possible to bee performed by him without infinite helpe. Moreouer, hee gaue v

The yeere 1200. he would néedes make a voyage to Carthusia the chiefe and originall house of their order. In his returne home, he fell sicke of a quartane ague at London and there died, Nouember. 17. 1200. His body was presently conueighed to Lincolne, and hapned to be brought thither, at a time, when king Iohn of England and William king of Scots were mette there, with an infinite number of the nobility of both realmes. The two kings, for the great reuerence they bare vnto his holinesse, would needs set their shoulders vnto the béere, and helped to carry his coarse from the gates of the City, vntill it came to the Church doore: There it was receiued by the Prelates, carried into the quire and the funerall rites being ended, buried in the body of the East part of the Church aboue the high Aulter; néere the aulter of Saint Iohn Baptist. The yéere 1220. he was Canonised at Rome, and his body being taken vp, October 7. 1282. was placed in a siluer shrine. Who so listeth to reade the miracles that are ascribed vnto him, may finde them in Matth. Paris that describeth his life at large in his report of the yéere 1200. Amongst many things omitted for breuity, I can not let passe one which I finde elsewhere deliuered concerning him, how that comming to God stow a house of Nunnes neere Oxford, and seeing a hearse in the middle of the quire couered with silke, &amp; tapers burning round about it, he asked who was buried there. Understanding then, it was that faire Rosamond the Concubine of K. Henry the second, who at her intreaty had done much for that house, and in regard of those fauours was affoorded that honour; Hee commaunded her body to be digged vp immediately, and buried

in the Churchyard; saying, it was a place a great deale too good for a harlot, and it should bee an example to other women to terrifie them from such a wicked and filthy kinde of life.

A man famous for his excellent learning and vertues otherwise. He was borne in Suffolke, of very meane, or rather base parentage, and had his education for a season in the Uniuersity of Oxford, vntill such time as (according vnto the manner of all students in those times) hée trauelled into France, partly to increase his knowledge in other learning, but especially to attaine the French tongue, which was then almost as common héere as the English. At his returne he was made Archdeacon of Leycester, and afterwards (as before is mentioned) Bishop of Lincolne. In his time, the tyranny of the Pope was now growne to the full height and ripenes. What for appeales vnto Rome &amp; bribes at Rome, no iurisdiction here could punish any fault neuer so hainous. No benefice or other preferment was likely to fal, but the Popes reseruation would take it vp before hand, and bestow it at last vpon some stranger (happily a childe) that would neuer come néere it all his life long. The yéere 1252. notice being taken of this matter, the spirituall promotions of strangers within this Realme were found to amount vnto the summe of 70000. marks by the yéer, wheras the kings yeerely reuenues at that time came not to the third part of that summe. At these and other intollerable abuses, he repining very much, thought good in person to go to Rome, &amp; acquaint the Pope with his grieues. He did so, was heard, and with fair promises dismissed. But whē at his return he found no maner of redresse of those things he complained of, he feared not to write vnto the Pope a very sharpe &amp; Satyrical letter, shewing how far he had degenerated from the holines of his predecessors, and exhorting him earnestly to reforme the monstrous enormities that flying from Rome, as from a corrupt and poysoned fountaine infected the whole Church. This Epistle (if any man desire to sée it) is to bée founde in Matth. Paris. The Pope hauing read it, grew into great choller, and breathing out many threats, intended some terrible

reuenge of this so intollerable a reproch (as hée tooke it) vntill such time as, one Gyles a Cardinall of Spain stepping vnto him, vsed these words; Holy father, it s

We shall doo well to remember, how certaine it is, quod scitur, quia aliquando Discessio est ventura, that there shall one day bee a departure, and let vs take heed that we giue not the occasion. My aduice therefore is, that wée bée content to winke at this matter, and euen let him alone. Some say his counsell was followed, and the matter passed ouer in silence. Howbeit it is also reported (and both may be true) that afterwards (vpon some new quarrell peraduenture) he was suspended at Rome, excommunicate, and horribly persecuted. Nay Bale affirmeth, that he was depriued by the said Pope, and another appointed to his Bishopricke to wit, one Albertus sometimes Archbishop of Prussia, that had been driuen out of Liuonia by the people of the country. Howsoeuer, certaine it is, that hée would neuer bée induced to obey any of these monstrous and vnreasonable bulls: Of which, discoursing sometimes with his familiars, hee would very confidently auouch, that the Pope was an Heretike, yea and Antichrist. So Matthew Paris deliuereth. Notwithstanding these broiles, he was a continuall and diligent Preacher, writ bookes to the number of almost 200. (the Catalogue whereof you may finde in Bale) and yet tooke infinite paines in attending matters of gouernement and iurisdiction, so farre forth as by the Pope hée was not hindred. He died at last at his mannour of Buckden, October 9. 1253. giuing all his bookes (an excellent Library) vnto the Frier Minors at Oxford. Hee lieth buried in the highest

South Isle of his Cathedrall Church, &amp; hath a goodly toombe of marble, with an image of brasse vpon it. The Pope not ceasing to persecute him after his death, was once of the mind to digge vp his body againe, vntill by the perswasion of some other his minde was altered. B

December 21. 1129. he was ordred Priest at Canterbury, and consecrate Bishop the day following: This man built a great part of the Church of Lichfield, increased the number of his prebends, fensed the towne of Lichfield with a ditch, and bestowed much vpon the castle there. No part of that Castle now standeth; only the ditch remayneth to bee séene, and the place where it stood, retaineth the name of Castle-field. He tooke vpon him the crosse at last,

went to Ierusalem, and died at Antioch. Aprill 16. 1148. I find that one Roger Bishop of Chester (so the Bishops of Lichfield were sometimes called) was founder of the monastery of Bilde was for Cistercian

Whether this Roger de Chriton were the author of these foundations or some other of those Rogers that succéeded him, I cannot say.

               THe yeare 1186. Hugh Nouaunt a Norman,1186. Hen. 2.33. but student sometimes in the vniuersity of Oxford, was consecrate Bishop of Lichfield. King Richard the first, being taken prisoner by the Archduke of Austrich; he ioyned with Iohn Earl of Mortayne the Kings brother that sought to dispossesse his said brother of the kingdome, for which afterward himselfe, and his friends, indured much trouble, the history whereof is related by R. Houeden, who saith he was fain to redéem the Kings fauour with the payment of 5000. markes. Of the King, before that time (as it séemes) hee bought the monastery of Couentry for 300. markes, intending to place secular Priests in the same. Thither hee came with a power of armed men the yeare 1190. and when the monkes would not giue place, inuading them with fine force, chased away some, beat and lamed other, spoyled their house, burnt their Charters and euidences, &amp;c. and then put in secular priests in their roomes. Bale reporteth that he could not cary this matter so cléere as that it cost him not some stripes: In the conflict himselfe was wounded, and that in the Church iust before the high altar. It séemeth he was a man learned, stout, and wise enough, but not so straight and carefull a censurer of his own manners and conuersation as hee should bee. No doubt our monkes (that were the onely writers of those times) speake no better of him then he deserues: yet for his religious and penitent end hee made they commende him much. Trauelling toward Rome, in his own country of Normandy he fell sicke, and perceiuing his end to approach, sent for diuers religious persons, vnto whom he acknowledged the loosenesse of his life, and with continuall teares greatly lamented the same, heartily requested them to pray for him, gaue al his money &amp; goods vnto the poore, and lastly put on a monks cowle, thereby thinking to make the monkes amends for all the trouble and vexation he had wrought them. Hee died at Beccumerhill, or (as Roger Houeden reporteth) at Betherleuin March 27 1199. and was buried at Cane in the 14. yéere of his troublesome gouernment. The yéere 1193. hee was robbed

of an infinite deale of treasure néere Canterbury trauelling toward king Richard that was then prisoner in Germany. And not long after, being banished the realme for taking part with king Iohn rebelling against his brother king Richard then prisoner in Germany, hee was faine to buy restitution vnto his place with the summe of 5000. markes.

                  ALexander de Sauensby (whom Bale calleth Alexander Wendocke) spent much time in diuers Uniuersities, as namely in Tholouse, Bonenia and others, in which he had the reputation of a great Philosopher, and a profound Diuine. He writ diuers workes wel estéemed of in times past. In them hee maketh report of certaine visions and strange apparitions he had seene scarce credible. He was consecrate at Rome vpon Easter day 1224. In his time a great controuersie

was raised betwéene the Monkes of Couentry, &amp; the Cannons of Lichfield, about the election of their Bishoppe, which euer since the remoouing of the Sée from Chester, had belonged vnto the Monkes. After the spending of much money vpon this suit in the Court of Rome, the matter was ordered there by definitiue sentence in this sort. It was agréed that they should chuse alternis vicibus, the monkes one time, and the Canons of Lichfield the next: But in all elections as well at Lichfield, as at Couentry, the Prior of Couentry was allowed to giue a voice, and it must be the first voice. Of this Bishop, the king (Henry the 3.) stood in great iealousie, by reason of the great familiarity that was betwéene him and the Earle Marshall that gallant rebell. Wherefore on a time, the King charged him as a party in the Earls conspiracy, which tended (as hee sayd) to the deposing and displacing of him from the Kingdome. To cleare himselfe from so hainous an imputation, he tooke no other course but this; hee put on immediately his Episcopall roabes, and solemnly accused all those that had but any thought of so wicked a practise. It was well accepted by the King, and gaue satisfaction. Concerning this man, it is also to bee remembred that hee was founder of a house for the Gray Friers, in the South west part of Lichfield, died at Andeuer, December 26, 1238. and was buried at Lichfield.

                  1240. Hen. 3.25. the Monkes of Couentry with the good liking of the Cannons of Lichfield, elected for their Bishop one William Raleigh. About the same time the Couent of Norwich (that Sée also being voyde) chose him likewise, and he accepting the second offer as the better of the two, left Lichfield. By reason hereof a new controuersie arose betwéene the Monkes of Couentry and the chapter of Lichfield, whether the turn of Co

hauing notice of the election, presently renounced the same.

This notwithstanding

                  Nicholas Fernham persisting in his refusal, both parties through the kings intercession were induced to consent vnto the choice of Hugh Pateshull Treasurer of Pauls, that had béene Treasurer, and was at that time Chancellour of England. Hee was sonne vnto Simon Pateshull sometime Lord chiefe Iustice of England. Hee was consecrate Iuly 1. 1241. Being yet in his best age and full strength, hee was taken away by vntimely death December 7. 1348. hauing sate not fully two yeeres. A man for his life and conuersation vnblameable and not vnlearned; yet misliked in our histories because in that little time he gouerned, he shewed himselfe more fauourable vnto his cannons of Lichfield, then the monkes of Couentry.

                  1245 Hen. 3.30.THe King now made earnest request for the election of Richard Abbot of Euesham and Kéeper of the great Seale. Some chose him: but the greater part agreed vpon a Monke that was Chaunter of Couentry.

                   the Popes fauour for his consecration, at what time hee was taken away by death in Riola a City of Gascoigne, hauing first resigned the custody of the great seale into the Kings hand. After his death, with consent of all parties there was chosen one William de Monte Pessulano, a vertuous and learned man: him also the king misliked. Once more they procéeded to election, &amp; by perswasion of Robert Grosthead Bishop of Lincolne, made choice of Robert de Weseham Dean of Lincolne, sometime a Franciscan Fryer of Oxford, a man very commendable (saith Mathew Paris) both for life and learning. There had béene much adoe in former times betwéene the Deanes and the Bishops of Lincolne. This Bishop thinking

the reason thereof to bee the greatnes of the Deanes liuing, endeauoured the more earnestly to prefer this man, that the Deantie beeing voyde, hee might somewhat weaken the same by disposing elsewhere the parsonage of Alysbery that heretofore belonged vnto it. This Roger Weseha

                   1245. before the king euer heard of any such thing toward. For they had concealed it from him of purpose, thinking if he might once get notice of it, the businesse was like neuer to be effected. Hauing sate about 11. yéeres, &amp; being now waxen old and very sickely, hee resigned his Bishopricke vpon Alhallowen day, 1269. Two yéeres after hee died of a palsie, whereof he had laine sicke a long time.

                  foorded consecration. This man was borne and brought vp altogether beyond the seas: By reason whereof hee was vtterly ignorant of the English tong. Being therefore called vpon to be resident vpon his Bishopricke, the yéere 1283. hee made that his excuse: but it might not serue his turne, Iohn Pechham Archb. of Canterbury, not onely forced him to residence, but reprehended him excéeding sharply for his neglect &amp; carelesnes of his charge. He sate long, and died a very olde man the yéere, 1295.
            
            
               47. Walter de Langton.

and became a Monke at Canterbury. Upon his refusal Walter Langton Treasurer of England was preferred thereunto and consecrate December 22. 1296. He liued in great authority vnder king Edward the first that fauoured him much. But his sonne Edward the second molested and disgraced him all that euer he might. His father the sayd Edward the first, dying in the North country, the young king commanded this Bishop to conduct his corpse vp to London, and when he had so done, for reward of his paines, hee caused sir Iohn Felton Constable of the Tower of arest him, seased vpon al his goods had imprisone
                     •

                     •
                  e time he had often reprehended the young Prince for his insolent and dissolute behauiour; which good admonitions he taking in euill part, wronged &amp; disgraced him many waies, namely one time, he brake down his parks, spoiled and droue away his déere, &amp;c. The Bishop complained of this outrage vnto the king his father, who being greatly displeased therwith, committed the Prince his sonne for certaine daies. And this was the cause of the grudge betwéen the yong king and him. About the same time (or I thinke a little sooner viz. 
                     •
                  he yéer 1301.) he was accused of certain hainous crimes before the Pope, and compelled to answer the accusation at Rome in his owne person. Though the proofes brought against him were either none or very slender; yet well knowing whom they had in hand (Noue
                        •
                     ant ipsum prae multis bouem valde pinguem, sayth Matth. Westm.) they were content to detaine him there so long, as it forced him to spend an infinite deale of money, and yet was neuer a whit the néerer in the end. For the Pope remitted the hearing of the cause to the Archbishoppe of Canter

                  ury, before whom hee purged himselfe Canonically and was adiudged cleere from those imputations layde vppon him. His accuser was a certaine Knight, that soone after committing a murther pleaded himselfe to bee a Cleargy man (although then married) hauing beene made a Deacon in his youth. Whereupon hee was committed to the Bishoppes prison (as the manner then was) and liuing there onely fiue dayes,

died miserably. Such is the end lightly of those men that delight in vexing and disgracing Gods Ministers. The tempests of those troubles being ourrblowne, the rest of his time this Bishop liued (for ought I finde) very quietly, and being happily dismissed from the Court, attended onely the gouernment of his charge. Unto his Church of Lichfield he was a wonderfull great benefactor. He laid the first foundation of the Lady chappell there, and at his death left order with his Executors for the full finishing of it. He compassed the cloyster of Lichfield with a stone wall, and bestowed a sumptuous shrine vpon S. Cedda his predecessor with two thousand pound charge. He ditched and walled all the Cathedrall church round about, made one gate of great strength and maiestie at the west part of the close, and another (but a lesse) on the south part. Hee builded the great bridge beyond the Uineyard at Lichfield, ann. 1310. He gaue his owne house or pallace vnto the Uicars for their dwelling, and built a new for himselfe at the East end of the close. He built also (or reedified at least being altogether decayed) the castle of Eccleshall, the Mannour place of Showbrough and Heywood, with the pallace by the Strand at London. He gaue vnto the high Altar at Lichfield one chalice, and two cruets of fine gold, worth twenty foure pounds, garnished about with precious stones to the value of 200. l. besides many copes and vestments of inestimable price. Hee bestowed vpon the Uicars a siluer cup of fiue marks weight, and a pension of twenty shillings by the yeere: And lastly, procured both vnto them and his Church many charters and notable priuiledges from the King. Hee died at London Nouember 16. 1321. and was buried in the Lady Chappell which he built.

A man very vnlearned and vtterly vnworthy so high a preferment in all respects. The Pope hauing notice of his insufficiency, by speciall mandate prohibited his consecration. Hereupon the new elect was faine to make repaire vnto Rome. The Pope himselfe examined him, but was so earnestly requested by the blacke Prince to fauour his sute, as, though he could not with any honesty allow of him, yet hée was content to leaue him to the approbation of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who would by no meanes yéeld to affoord him any testimonie of sufficiency. At last with much adoe, hee procured the Pope to authorise two other Bishops for the allowance or reiecting of him (who they were I cannot call to remembrance) and they by the exceeding great importunitie of the Prince admitted him to consecration, which hee receiued, September 26. 1360.

               2. Osmond.
               
                  OSmond being a knight, and a Norman by birth, came into England with King William the Conquerour. Hee had beene Captaine of Say in Normandy and by the foresaide king was made Chauncellor of England, Earle of Dorset, and after Hermans death, Bishop of Salisbury: he was a man well learned, and passing wise, in regard whereof hee was alwaies of the priuy councell and might seldome bée spared from the Court. He continued the building begun by his predecessor and at last finished the same, adding vnto it a library, which he furnished with many excellent books. This new Church at olde Salisbury was finished, and in an euill hower dedicated very solemnly by the foresaide Osmond together with Walkelin Bishop of winchester, &amp; Iohn of Bath the yeere 1092. In an euill houre I say; for the very next day after, ye steeple of the same was set on fire by lightning. That he afterwards repaired, and furnished his Church with all maner of ornaments. At last he departed this life Saturday, Decem. 3. 1099. and was buried in his owne Church His bones were after remoued to new Salisbury, where they now lye, in the middle of the Lady Chappell vnder a Marble

stone bearing this onely inscription ANNO. MXCIX. Aboue any thing I may not forget, that amongest diuers bookes he writ (as the life of Saint Adelme the first Bishop of Sherborne, not of S. Anselme who liued tenne yeares after him, as Baronius mistaking reporteth &amp;c.) hee was first Author of the ordinale secundum vsum Sarum. After his death he was canonised, and the aforesaid third day of December appointed for his holyday.

                  1107. Hen. 1.8.KIng Henry the first beeing yet a priuate man, &amp; seruing his brother in his wars in Normandy, it chaunced him and his troope to turne into a Church in the Suburbes of Cane to heare seruice. Roger that rich and mighty Bishop of Salisbury that was afterwards, attended the cure there at that time for some very poore salary. This crafty curate, well knowing how to fit the deuotion of souldiers, was so nimble at his businesse, as he had made an ende of his worke before some of the company were aware he had begunne. They all cryed out he was the fittest chaplaine for soldiers that might be found. Whereupon halfe in 
                     •
                  est, halfe in earnest, the yong Prince bid him follow him. He did so; and albeit he was in a manner altogether vnlearned, yet being verie crafty, in a short time he wound himselfe so fast into the Princes liking, as he employed him in most of his affairs. Whilest he remained a priuate man, hee had the managing of his money and houshold businesses, wherein hee did the Prince his Master such seruice (his meanes being then very small, and requiring carefull attendance) as hee gained a speciall trust with him euer after; in so much as, soone after his comming to the crowne, hauing preferred him to this Bishopricke, hee gaue him also the title of Iuslitiarius totius Angliae, and committed euer the whole gouernment of the Realme vnto him in his absence, which fell out to be very often, and sometime for the space of 3 or 4. yeares together. These employments gaue him opportunity, both to inrich himselfe, and to prefer his frinds euen as he listed. Hee had a sonne of his owne called Roger, surnamed Paupere-censu, whome hée made Chauncelour

of England. Hée had also two nephewes which hée made Bishops; Alexander of Lincolne, and Nigellus of Ely. This Nigellus likewise had a sonne called Richard Fitz-Neale, that long after became Bishop of London. For these so great benefits he proued not so thankfull to his Master as was to be expected. For he (King Henry the first) hauing lost his only sonne and apparant heire prince William, by misfortune vpon the sea; and hauing no issue lawfully begotten, left to inherit his kingdome but onely Mawde the Empresse: Hee I say thought good to take an oath of all the nobility, wherein they promised to yéelde obedience to her after his death as their soueraigne, and to none other. This 
                     〈◊〉
                   oath, though Roger our Bishop did not only take himselfe, but minister vnto the rest of the nobility, for that hee was chauncellor: yet notwithstanding, forgetting all duties of religion toward God, of thankefulnesse toward his patrone, and loyalty to his Prince; hee was the first man (the king being dead) that fell to plotting for the aduancement of Stephen vnto the kingdome, which by his perswasion hée first attempted, and much deale by his vngracious counsell at last obtained. At the time of king Henries death, it happened Maud the Empresse to be out of the realme in Normandy with her Father. Whereof Stephen Earle of Boloigne, taking aduantage, wrought so with this Bishop, &amp; the Bishop

                  o Winchester Stephens brother (that was then the Popes Legate) as they were content to set the crown vpon his head who otherwise then by a kind of election which they procured, had no colour of right vnto the same. For if they regarded neerenesse of bloud, not onely Maud and her sonne were neerer, but Theobald also Earle of Bloys that was Stephens elder brother. Howbeit these Cleargymen that bare all the sway in those times, desirous to continue their owne greatnesse, would néedes make choice of him; as perswaded belike, yt in bestowing the crown vpon such a one as had least reason to expect it, they should so farre oblige him vnto them, as in all likehood it must bée a meanes not onely to continue, but much to increase their greatnesse. As for the oath they had taken, this Bishop deuised an excuse, that

king Henry after the time they had sworne to his daughter, marrying her out of the Realme without their consent, had therein discharged them of that oath. Howsoeuer this allegation might bleare the eyes of men, it could not deceiue God

Stephen in the beginning of his raigne, to secure himselfe the better against forrain inuasions (as he thought) graunted frée license vnto all that would, to build castles in any part of the Realme; by vertue of which grant in a short time after, there were erected no lesse then 1117. new castles. But the Bishoppes (and this of Salisbury) farre outwent the nobility and all the rest in magnificence, strength, and number of their erections. To leaue the rest vnto their owne places, the most cost that this man bestowed, was vpon the Castle of the Deuises; the ruines whereof who so both yet view, will not meruaile if in those da

Somwhat then to excuse the vanity of this humor, he fell to repayring of his Church of olde Salisbury, which in a manner he built all a new. It is said also that he bestowed the foundation of two monasteries; but what they were I finde not. These Antidotes were of so small force against the poyson of enuy as there wanted not many to buzze daily into the Kings eares, that these castles no doubt were intended to intertaine the party of the Empresse his aduersary; and that it much behoued him to take them from the Priest, in whose hands to leaue them, were neither safe nor seemely. Others put him in minde of his owne wants, which might no way they said, be better supplied, then by ris

Whether it were feare, and a iealousie of the Bishops fidelity (which some deliuer,) or couetousnes &amp; a desire of possessing himselfe of his wealth, which others affirme; or happily both; certain it is, that violently he despoiled at once both of his treasure and his castles

this Bishop, to whom he owed euen the crowne he bare. Hauing lately obtaines diuers victories, against the Scots, against the Empresse, the French and others, and thinking his throne now sufficiently established; he presumed so far of his owne strength, as casting all regard of his old friend, behind him, he doubted not to take the course before mentioned; which was very like in the end to haue proued his ouerthrow, as in his history the Chronicles may shew you. At Oxford a councell is called by the King, whither the Bishops and especially ours of Salisbury must néeds come. He would faine haue excused himselfe by age and the indisposition of his body; but it might not serue his turne. Answer was made his experience was such in affaires of the Realme and such his knowne fidelity, as the king must not want his aduice, whereon he meant principally to rely. And true it is indéed that hitherunto the king was wholly ruled by him, insomuch as he gaue him for himselfe or his friend, whatsoeuer he would asks. One of his nephews he made Chancellor, another Treasurer, &amp; bestowed vpon himselfe the burrough of Malmsbury; and sometimes he would not sticke to say, let this man beg while he will, for a while, I will giue him halfe the kingdome rather than say him nay, and sooner shall he be weary of crauing th

                   I of grauting. Of late now he had somewhat withdrawne himselfe from the Court, pretending vnseruiceablenesse by reason of his debility and many yéeres. But the king it séems was disposed to haue it for an argument of alienation of his affectious, whereunto a great emulation grown betwéen him and Winchester the kings brother might giue some likelihood. And therefore vsing faire words as a baite to tell him into his net, seconding his kind messages with the like words, at their meeting, hee gaue him all gratious entertainment; but secretly tooke order (as it séemeth) that a querrell should be picked vnto some of his retinue. So when he least suspected any such matter, his people were set vpon by some of the kings officers, pretending that certain courtiers were by them disappointed of their lodgings. After a little resistance one or two of the Bishops men slaine and diuers wounded, the Bishops men fled, as did al

The Bishop of Salisbury being now very aged, partly peraduenture through griefe, but partly also by reason of so long abstinence, sel sicke of a quartane ague, wherewith he languished from that time (being the moneth of Iuly) vntill December following, and then died, rauing and taking on like a man distract of his wittes certaine dayes before his departure. There was found in that castell of his forty thousand markes of siluer ready coyned, beside gold, plate &amp; iewels of inestimable price. All that the king laide hands vpon; and with that money procured (as some deliuer) the marriage of his eldest sonne Eustace and Constantia the French Kings sister. The Bishops sonne was kept lon

After that, it seemeth vnto mee one Galfridus became Bishop of Sarum. But because my proofes are not pregnant, and diuers affirme Ioceline to be the next successor of Roger except that same Philip (whom no man reckoneth amongst the Bishops of this See) I will passe him ouer in silence.

About the year 1355. he sued William Montacute Earle of Salisbury with a writ of right for the castle of Salisbury. The Earle pleaded that he would defend his title by combat. Whereupon at a time appointed, the Bishop was faine to bring his Champion vnto the listes prouided for this purpose. He was cloathed all in white sauing that ouer the rest of his apparrell was cast the coat armour of the Bishop. After him came one with a staffe, and another with his target. The Earle likewise brought in his Champion much in like sort, and all things were now ready for them to go together, when vpon a sodain, by commandement of the Kings letters, the matter was staid for a time. Before the second meeting, the parties fell to agréement. The Bishop gaue vnto the Earle 2500. marks to leaue the castle with his apurtenances vnto him and his successors for euer. Beside this, he also recouered the chase of Beere, &amp; the castle of Sherborn which had béen detained from his Sée euer since K. Stephen tooke it violently from Roger his predecessor, for the space of 200. yéeres. Hee died the sixe and forty yéere of his consecration, Septemb. 4. 1375. and lieth buried vnder a faire marble stone in the middle of the quire néere the Bishops Sée. On the south side close by him lieth Bishop Iewell, who (as I haue heard) desired to lie beside him.

A certaine number of lewde persons, (tenants for the most part to this Bishop) intending to ioyne themselues to the rest of that crew, came to Edendon, where hée was then saying of Masse. What was their quarrell to him I finde not. But certaine it is, they drew him from the Altar in his albe with his stole about his necke to the toppe of an hill not farre off, and there as he kneeled on his knees praying, they cleft his head, spoiled him to the skinne, and renting his bloody shirt into a number of péeces, tooke euerie man a ragge to keepe for a monument of their worthy exploit.

When or how hée left his Bishopricke I finde not. The yeare 1585.

                     •
                  r with Aldred Archbishop of Yorke, and Walter Bishop of Hereford. At his returne, hee found the estate of his Church very miserable; Harald the Quéenes brother, that afterwards became for a while King of England, being yet a priuate man.
               
                  (Quid Dominifacient, audent qui talia serui?)
               
               Upon what occasion I know not, had spoiled the Church of all ornaments, chased away the Canons, and inuading al the possessions of the same, had conuerted them to his owne vse; so that the Canons remaining, which fled not for feare of this tyrant (they were onely fiue) they (I say) were faine to begge their bread. The Bishop complaining vnto the King of this outragious hauocke, found cold comfort at his hands: For, whether it were for fear of Haralds power or his wiues displeasure, he caused no restitution at all to be made. Onely the Queene was content to giue of her owne, Marke and Modesty vnto the Church. After the death of King Edward,

Giso was faine to flye the land, till such time as Harold the sacrilegious vsurper being vanquished and slaine, William the Conqueror was a meane to restore, not onely him to his place and country, but his Church also to all that the other had violently taken from it, except some small parcels that, (I know not by what meanes) had beene conueighed vnto the Monastery of Glocester. Yet in stead of them also, hee was pleased to bestow vpon the Church, the mannor of Yatton, with the Patronage of the benefice there; and moreouer caused one Ealsi to restore vnto ye same the mannor of Winsham, which long since had been alienated from it, by some sinister practise as it should seeme. Giso being thus setled, took great paines, in recouering such other things as had bin imbesilled from his Church, in procuring such things as seemed to be wanting, and charters of confirmation for the better assurance of what already they had: Namely, of one Arser a Courtier he found means to obtaine the mannors of Coomb-Nicolas, Woormister and Lytton. Then seeing the state of his Church so wel amended, he thought good to augment the number of his Canons, and for their better intertainement built them a cloyster, a hall, and a dorter or place for their lodging. Lastly hee appointed one Isaac by the name of a Prouost to be their gouernour. Hauing béene Bishop the space of 28. yéeres he departed this life, and was buried vppon the Northside of that place where the high altar then stood. I take his to be the highest of those olde tombes that lye vpon the outside of the quier toward the North.
            
            
               16. Iohn de Villula.
               HE that succéeded (Iohn de Villula) was a Frenchman,1088. Wil. Ru. 2. borne in Tours, &amp; a Phisition héeretofore by his prosession, or rather I should say an Empiricke; vsu, non literis medicus probatus, saith Malmsbury. Hee not content to doe nothing toward the amendment of ye state of his church, vsed al the meanes he might to impaire &amp; diminish the same. The cloyster and other buildings erected by Giso for his canons, he pulled downe, and in the place where they stood, built a pallace for himselfe &amp; his successors, forcing them to séek dwellings

abroad in the towne. But the greatest wrong of all other was, that neuer acquainting them with it, hee procured his Episcopall Sée, which hetherto had béen seated at Wels, to bee remooued to Bathe; and whereas all his predecessors had beene knowne by the names of the Bishops of Welles, he renouncing Welles, entituled himselfe Bishop of Bathe, which city he bought of the King for fiue hundreth markes, and founded in the same a monastery for the receipt of his new remooued Episcopall throne. This monastery was first built by Offa king of Mercia ann. 775. and beeing destroyed by the Danes (who burnt and razed to the ground almost all the monasteries of England) was afterwards an. 1010. réedified by Elphegus that at last was Archbishop of Canterbury His building stood no long time: For the yeere 1087. both it, and in a manner al the city was consumed and vtterly destroyed by fire; in such sort, as this Bishop building it a new from the ground, &amp; augmenting the reuenues (which before were little or nothing) vnto a competent proportion; may not vnworthily seeme to bee the founder and author of the same. Hee had scarcely (or indéed not) finished it, when being a very aged man, hee was taken away by death, to witte, Dec. 29. 1122. hauing sate 34. yéeres. He was buried in the Church himselfe had built.

He was also for a time Chauncelour of England vnder King Henry the first. Hauing continued héere 12. yeres, he died Aug. 16. 1135. and was buried at Bathe.

                  1136. Steph. 1.AFter him succéeded one Robert a monke of Lewes; borne in Normandy, but by parentage a Flemming. In the beginning of his time, to witte, Iuly 29. 1137 the Church of Bathe lately built by Iohn de Villula was againe

consumed by fire. He réedified it, and added whatsoeuer might seeme to haue béene left vnperfect by the other. In the stirres betweene Maud the Empresse and king Stephen, hée indured much trouble, beeing taken prisoner at Bathe and held in captiuity a long time by the king. The continuer of Florent. Wig. setteth downe the history thereof at large. After his deliuerance, he tooke great paines in labouring an agreement betweene the Churches of Wels &amp; Bathe who had now many yeeres contended which of them should bee honoured with the Episcopall Sée. At last with the good liking of both parties, he set downe this order, that the Bishops heereafter should be called, Bishops of Bath &amp; Wels; that each of them should by commission appoint electors (the See being void) by whose voyces the Bishop should bée chosen; and that he should be installed in both of these churches. Then, whereas a kinsman of Iohn de Villula being appointed by him Prouost, by vertue of that office had withdrawn and conuerted vnto his owne vse, in a manner all the reuenues of old, belonging to the canons, with great labour &amp; cost at last he procured, all that had appertained vnto them to bée restored againe. And to take away all occasion of the like vsurpation, he thought good to diuide the lands of the Church into two parts, whereof the one he assigned vnto the chapter in common; out of the rest he allotted to euery cannon a portion, by the name of a Prebend. He also it was that first constituted a Deane to be the President of the Chapter, and a Subdeane to supply his place in absence; a Chaunter to gouerne the quier, and a Subchaunter vnder him; a Chauncellour to instruct the yoonger sort of Canons; and lastly, a Treasurer to looke to the ornaments of the Church. The Subchauntership, together with the Prouostship an. 1547. were taken away and suppressed by act of Parliament, to patch vp a Deanry, the lands and reuenewes of the Deamy being deuoured by sacrilegious cormorants. Moreouer, and beyond all this, whereas our Church of Welles at this time was excéeding ruinous, and likely euery day to fall to the ground, he pulled downe a great part of it, and repaired it. At last he died, hauing sate 29. yeares, and 4. moneths, and was buried at Bathe.

At last Reginald Fitzioceline a Lumbard, sonne vnto Ioceline Bishop of Salisburie, and by his gift Archdeacon of Salisbury was appointed thereunto, being but 33. yeeres of age (or as one deliuereth but 24.) Hee was consecrate at S. Iohns in Sauoy by Richard Archbishop of Canterbury, as they returned from Rome together, where Richard himselfe had béene newly consecrate. This man by suite obtained for the Chapter of king Richard the first, at what time he set forward in his voyage toward the Holy land, the mannors of Curry, Wrentich and Hatch. He founded the Hospitall of Saint Iohns in Bath, valued at 22. pound, 19. shillings sixe pence halfepenny yearely rent, and certaine Prebends in the Church of Welles. Moreouer, he graunted vnto the city of Welles a corporation and many priuiledges which by his gift they enioy to this day. The yéere 1191. hee was translated to Canterbury. See more of him there.

                  1192. Ric. 1.4.KIng Richard the first being taken prisoner in Germany by Leopold Duke of Austria; The Emperor tooke order with him, that besides other conditions to be required of the King for his deliuerance; he should make him promise to preferre a kinsman of his (the Emperors) called Sauarike (then Archdeacon of Northampton) vnto the Bishopricke of Bath and Wels, and moreouer to annexe vnto the same Bishopricke the Abbotship of Glastonbury. For the better effecting of which purpose, Sauarike was content to returne vnto the king the possession of the City of Bath, which his predecessor Iohn de Villula had bought of K. William Rufus. These things being brought to passe according to his desire, he altered his stile and would needs bee called Bishop of Glastonbury. He was consecrate on Michaelmas day 1192. at Rome and returning into England by Germany, was there stayed

and left for an hostage, in assurance of paiment of the Kings ransome. After his deliuery, hee yet continued there a long time and became Chancellor of Burgundy vnder the Emperor, till that the yéere 1197. the Emperor falling sicke, (as Houeden deliuereth) he was sent by him into England, to release vnto the King all such monies, as yet remained vnpaid of that wrongfull &amp; vnconscionable ransome. The Emperor then dying before he could return, he thought good to remain here still vpon his charge. In 12. yeares that he sate Bishop, hee did not any thing memorable, 
                     •
                  xcept happily this may séeme worthy remembrance, that he impropriated the Parsonages of Ilmister and Longsutton, making them Prebends &amp; appointing the one of them alwaies to be allot
                     •
                  d vnto the Abbot of Muchelney, &amp; the other to the Abbot of Athelney, for the time being. The Prebend of Ilmister is vanished together with the Abbey of Muchelney: Longsutton parsonage by the piety of Queen Mary was restored to the church of Wells, and remaineth to this day a part of our possessions. This Bishop died August 8. 1205. and was buried at Bathe Concerning him and the great sums hee died indebted, who so list may reade somewhat in the Decretals of Greg. lib. 3. tit. 9. cap.

Their importunity gaue occasion of setting downe a decrée in the Court of Rome, Vacante sede, nihil in Episcopatu innouandum esse, That a Sée being void, nothing is to be altered in the state of the same. Before the end of the yéere. 1205. Ioceline a Canon of Wels borne also and brought vp in Welles (at leastwise as to me by diuers arguments it séemeth) was consecrate vnto this Sée at Reading. The Monkes of Glastonbury were by &amp; by doing with him; and after much contention preuailed, but so, as they were faine to buy their victory at a déere rate, allowing vnto the Bishopricke of Welles out of their possessions, the mannors of Winscombe, Pucklechurch, Blackford

                  ord, Buckland and Blackford. Soone after this composition made, hee was faine to flye the realme &amp; continued in banishment the space of fiue yéeres. The cause and manner thereof you may see in Stephen Langton of Canterbury. After his returne he gaue himselfe altogether to adorning and increasing the state of his Church. He founded diuers Prebends, impropriated diuers Parsonages to the behoofe of his Chapter, and gaue them the mannour of Winscombe. He allotted reasonable reuenewes to euery of the dignities, which before that time had small profite by their places. He appointed vicars to assist the Prebends in doing the seruice of the Church: and laide vnto the Bishopricke the mannors of Congresbury, Chedder and Axebridge. He also and Hugh Bishop of Lincoln, laying their purses together, founded the Hospitall of S. Iohns in Welles, which beeing suppressed by act of Parliament &amp; giuen to the Earle of Southampton, he exchanged it with Bishop Clarke for Dogmersfield. Moreouer in building hee bestowed inestimable sums of money. He built a stately Chappel in his Pallace at Wels, &amp; an other at Owky, as also many other edifices in the same houses: And lastly, the Church of Welles it selfe being now ready to fall to the ground, notwithstanding the great cost bestowed vpon it by Bishop Robert; he pulled downe the great east part of it, to witte, al the West end, built it a new from the very foundation, and hallowed or dedicated it October 23. 1239. Hauing continued in this Bishopricke 37. yeeres, he died at last Nouember 19. 1242. and was buried in the middle of the Quier that he had built, vnder a marble toomb of late yeers shamefully defaced.

                  1244. Hen. 3.29NOtwithstanding the composition lately made by Bishop Robert for the order of election, the monkes of Bathe refusing to ioyne with the Chapter of Welles, elected of themselues one Roger the Chaunter of Salisburie for Bishop, who (for that a kinsman of the Popes had the aduouson of his liuing) obtained easily consecration by the

Popes meanes September 11. 1244. After long suit in law betwéene the two Churches for the righting of this wrong; the end was, that Welles men must put vp the wrong, and they of Bathe yeeld assurance of performing the composition for the time to come; which was done accordinglie. The Bishop (by whose meanes this accord was made) not liuing long after, departed this life, Ianuary 13. 1247. hauing sate not past foure moneths aboue thrée yéeres. Hee onely of all the Bishops of this Church for the space of almost 600. yéers died within the compasse of 6. yeeres after his comming hither, which in so long space hath yet neuer happened to any other. Hée is the last of our Bishoppes that was buried at Bathe.

               THe Couent of Bath,1247. Hen. 3.32. accordlng to their promise, now at last ioyning with the Chapter of Wells, William Button, first Subdeans, and then Archdeacon of Welles, was with one consent elected. This man had much to do with the monkes of Glastonbury, concerning those lands which by composition they had yéelded to the Sée of Welles: And although the Bishop had sustained great charge in diuers of the kings seruices, namely and especially in trauelling into the furthermost part of Spaine about his affaires. Yet he fauoured altogether the part of the monkes, and gaue them his vttermost assistance in their suites. They were ended at last by the Bishops death, who deceased in the beginning of the yéer 1264. hauing first possessed his brethren and kinsfolks of all the principall places in our Church of Welles. For I finde that about this time, there was another William Button, his brothers sonne, Archdeacon of Welles, and after Bishop; one Richard Button Chaunter, Nicolas Button a brother of the Bishops Treasurer, Iohn Button another brother of his Prouost of Coomb and Parson of Ashbery, after whose death one Thomas Button succeeded in the Pronostship; and that one Thomas Button (whether the same man or no I can not tell) was first Archdeacon after William Button aforesaide, then Deane of Welles, and lastly, the yéere 1292. Bishop of

Exceter. This Thomas Button it was that for the soule of this William Button our Bishop, gaue to our church the bell commonly called the sermon bell, as in a French inscription vpon the same bell is yet to be seene.

A man so greatly accounted of for his holinesse (saith Matthew Paris) as when Robert Killwardby Archbishop of Canterbury had licence of the Pope to take consecration at the hand of any Catholike Bishop; he made choice of him, only in respect of his holines. He made many good statutes by which our Church is yet gouerned: Amongst other things hee ordained foure generall Chapter daies in the yeere, at which onely times, such things should be ordered as might pati moram. It were greatly to be wished, that all other Churches were to obserue the same order. He deceased in the moneth of Nouember 1274. Many superstitious people (especially such as were troubled with the tooth ake) were wont (euen of late yéeres) to frequent much the place of his buriall, beeing without the North side of the Quier, where we see a Marble stone, hauing a pontificall image grauen vpon it.

               IN the moneth of Ianuary following Robert Burnel Archdeacon of Yorke and Canon of Welles (son of Robert,
                  1274. Edw. 1.3. &amp; brother of Hugh, both Lords Burnell) was elected: A man of great power and authoity in those daies, being first Treasurer, then Chancellor of England and alwaies of the priuy counsail vnder K. Edward the first. That gaue him means of gathering great wealth, which hee imploied, partly in building his houses (as namely that goodly hall of the pallace at Welles, pulled downe some fifty yéeres since by Sir Iohn Gates, that for a iust reward of his sacriledge, soone after lost his head). But his principall care was, to inrich his brethren and kinred, whom he greatly aduanced. He was much imploied in Welch affaires, from which he could be so il spared, as the king was consent for a while to let him keep his court of Chauncery at Bristoll. Some there be suppose the castle of Acton-burnell in Shropshire to haue béene built by him, at what time he was occasioned to liue in those parts. Hee sate eight
                     •
                  ene yéeres, and lieth buried in the middle of the body of his Church, vnder a marble stone, somewhat below the pulpit.
            
            
               27. William de Marchia.
               THe same yéere that Burnell died,1293. Edw. 1.22. 
                  William de Marchia, then Treasurer of England succéeded, and was restored to the temporalties of this Sée March. 19. Edw. 1.21. I haue seene, amongst the records of our church of Welles, the copies of diuers letters vnto the Pope and Cardinals from the King, from diuers of the nobility and the cleargy of that Church, commending this man so far foorth for his holines, testified (as they write) by many miracles; as they intreated very earnestly for his Canonisation. I marnell much at it: For Matthew of Westminster and Polydor Virgil, complain grieuously of him, as the author of a hainous sacriledge, in causing the king to spoile all the Churches &amp; Monasteries of England, of such plate and mony as lay hoorded vp in them, for the paiment of his souldiers. It was Edward the first, a prince, that wanted neither wit to deuise, nor courage to execute such an exploit, and to lay the fault vpon another at last.

Yet likely enough it is, that such a fault stamped vpon him (how vndeseruedly soeuer) might bar him out of the Popes Calender, who otherwise was not wont to be ouer
                     •
                  dainty in affoording that kind of honour, where fees might be readily paid in for it. He sate ten yéeres, and lieth in toombed in the South wall neere the Cloister doore. In this mans time, the Chapter house was built, by the contribution of well disposed people; a stately and sumptuous worke.

                  WAlter Haselshaw, Deane of Welles, had his election approued by the Kings royall assent. Aug. 13. Edw. 1.30. He sate 9. yeares, and lieth buried vnder a huge marble, in the body of the Church toward the North, almost ouer against the pulpit. This Bishop made many statutes.
            
            
               29. Iohn Drokensford.

                  IOhn Drokensford kéeper of the kings Ward-robe succéeded being consecrated (as I finde) before, May. 17. Edw. 1.3. Following the steps of his predecessor Burnell, he bestowed somewhat in increasing the buildings and liberties of his Sée, but much more vpon his kinred. Hee had much contention with his Chapter (the story whereof is to be séene in the statute booke) sate 19 yéeres, and lieth buried vnder a reasonable séemely toombe of frée stone in the chappell of S. Katherine, which is vpon the right hand going toward the Lady chappell.

                  es) before the Pope had allowed of him. His approbation (saith Walsingham) cost him at last a huge sum of mony. This man is famous for the first foundatiō of our Uicars close in Wels. The memory of which benefit is to bee séene expressed in a

picture vpon the the wall at the foote of the hall-staires. In it the Uicars knéeling, seeme to request the Bishop in these words:

                     Pervicos positi villae, pater alme rogamus,
                     Vt simul vniti, te dante domos maneamus.
                     Disperst about the towne, we humbly pray,
                     Together, through thy bounty, dwell we may.
                  
He answereth them thus:

                     Vestra petunt merita, quod sint concessa petita,
                     Vt maneatis ita, loca fecimus hic stabilita.

               This picture being now almost worne out; at what time of late yéeres, the Uicars by the gracious fauour of her Maiesty had their reuenues confirmed to them, being in danger to bee spoyled of them by certaine sacrilegious cormorants; they likewise caused a picture of excellent workmanship to be drawen, containing a memorial of both the one and the other. These buildings being erected; toward the maintainance of some hospitality in them, hee gaue vnto that new Colledge, the mannor of Welsleigh, and allotted them twenty nobles yearly to be paid out of the vicarage of Chew. He built moreouer a house for the Queristers and their master: Hee built likewise the Church of Winscombe and the court-house at Clauerton, a great chamber at Euercrich; and much other odifices in other of his houses. His pallace of Wels he inclosed with an excéeding strong wall &amp; a large mote, into which he turned the riuer running hard by He gaue vnto his church many things, of which nothing now remaineth (I think) but a great chest bound with iron, in which the Chapter seale is kept. Lastly, it is to bée remembred, that with great cost hee procured the forrest of Mendip to be disparked. Hauing performed these and many other things deseruing perpetuall memory; hee departed this life at Wiuelescomb Aug. 14. 1363. hauing continued Bishop 34. yéeres. His body was buried before the high alter vnder a goodly monument of Alablaster, compassed about with grates of yron. About a 60.

yeeres since (for what cause I know not) it was remooued to the Northside of the presbytery, but lost his grates by the way. The image of Alabaster that lieth vpon it, is said to be very like him.

Hee impropred to the chapter of Welles the pasonage of Puklechurch, and gaue vnto them a certaine house, called the George, beside certain plate and Church ornaments to the value of 140, l. Moreouer, hee built a Colledge at Wells for fowertéen priests, at the end of the lane now called College-lane.

Hen. 4.2. was conferred by the Pope vpon Richard Clifford Archdeacon of Canterbury who being denied his temporalties by the king, was faine, notwithstanding the Popes prouisory Bulles, to giue place vnto Henry Bowet Doctor of law and Canon of Welles, that with the kings fauour was lawfully elect thereunto. See more hereof in Richard Clifford of London. To Welles he was consecrate Nouemb. 16. 1401. in Saint Pauls church in London, the king and all the Nobility being present; and was translated to Yorke December 1. 1407. as the records of Wells testifie. But the records of the Archbishop affirme Nic. Buckwith to haue béene translated to Wels in this mans place October the 5. the yeare aforesaide. The yeare before his tran

compasse of one yéere after he was first consecrat to London. This man being at the Counsell of Constance, was appointed one of those thirty persons that were ioyned with the Cardinalls in the election of Pope Martin the fifth. He built an almes-house vpon the Northside of S. Cuthberts Church, endowing it with good possessions for the reliefe of many poor persons: They were much increased afterwards by one Storthwayt, somewhat also by Bishop Bourne, and lately by the now Bishop D. Montague. So that now it maintaineth 24. poore people. He impropred vnto our Church the parsonage of Buckland Abbatis: Hee built our Library ouer the Cloysters, and a little Chappell for morrow masse ouer against the great pulpit. In that Chappell (built belike for the place of his buriall) he founded a Chauntry, and dying October 27. 1424. was there enterred.

Hee was a great benefactor to Lincolne Colledge in Oxford; and a great builder of his owne houses, vpon the repayring and beautifying of which, he spent first &amp; last (as himselfe professeth in his wil) 6000. markes. Perceiuing himselfe sickly and not like long to continue, hee made his will: &amp; doubting least K. Edward the fourth should make it void by picking some quarrel of treason vnto him; (a thing no doubt easie to be done, for that this bishop had beene alwaies a constant follower of the house of Lancaster) with great cost he procured from the saide king a confirmation of his wil, dated Nouember 3. 1464. In it he bequeathed to the Church of Wels 20, l. in mony, fower very sumptuous vestments, 400, l. to buy copes, a vessell for holy water of siluer waighing 10, l. Troy, a crosse of siluer parcell gilt of the same waight, a chaire for the Bishop to vse in the Church (which yet remaineth) and certaine cushions with other ornaments.

Henry had married; hee was carried but with the same humour that possessed Margaret Duchesse of Burgundy King Edwards owne sister, who set vp not onely this counterfeite, but after him also Perkin Warbecke, vsing all her possible meanes to displace King Henry, as esteeming the house of Yorke quite despoiled of the Kingdome, except some one of the issue male of that Family were seated in the same. But whatsoeuer the particular fault of this Bishop were, it séemeth, that hauing a guilty conscience, hee betooke himselfe vnto the Uniuersity of Oxford, as hoping that the priuiledges of the same might bee some shelter and defence vnto him. Whereof the King hauing aduertisement, sent vnto the Chancellour of the Uniuersity, one Edward Willoughby his Chaplaine, to require that the Bishop might bee deliuered vnto his officers, as being one, vnto whom (he being at the time no Student there) the priuiledges of the Uniuersity could not extend, so farre at least, as to protect him in a matter of treason, vnto which no priuiledge ought to yeeld any patrociny. After two or three refusals, at last by permission and conniuence of the Chancellour, he was arrested and committed prisoner to the castle of Windsor, to wit, in the moneth of October, 1487. where he lay and continued vntill his decease, which happened about Midsommer in the yeare 1491 He built that goodly Lady Chappell in the Cloysters, that was afterward pulled downe by Sir Iohn Gates, who destroyed also the great Hall of the Pallace, mentioned in Rob, B

He pulling down the olde Church of the Abbey of Bathe, began the foundation of a faire and sumptuous building, but at the time of his death left it very vnperfect. His successor bestowed some cost on it, and William Bird the last Prior there, endeuouring what hee might by himselfe, and other to sée it finished; had euen brought it to perfection, when the dissolution of the Abbey had almost ouerthrown what before was set vp. The couering of lead was taken away, and the whole fabricke like in few yeares to fall to the ground, but that it pleased God to stirre vp at seuerall times diuers good men (and especially the now Bishoppe) who out of a pious and ch

                  1505 Hen. 7.21.POpe Innocent the eight, hearing of a certain dangerous sedition raysed vp against Iames the third K. of Scots: thought good to send into Scotland one Hadrian de Castello, as a man for his wisdome and other good parts likelie to appease those tumults, hee béeing as farre as London on his way, was certified of the King of Scots death, whom his owne subiects had slaine in battell. So resting himselfe a while there, hee grew into acquaintance with Iohn Moorton Archbishop of Canterbury, who being much delighted with his learning, and discréete carriage; commended him so effectually vnto the King (Henry the seuenth) as he thought good to constitute him his Proctor for the dispatch of all his causes at Rome; where hee so well behaued himselfe, as the King at last in reward of his paines and fidelity, was a meanes of his preferment vnto the Bishopricke of Hereford first, the yéere 1503. and then, the yeere following, of this Sée. Pope Alexander the sixt in the meane time, a little before his translation hither, had made him Cardinal: being before that time the Popes generall Treasurer, and principall Secretary. In those places hauing gathered excéeding great wealth

                  Caesar Borgia the Popes sonne hoping to make a prey of the same, determined to poyson him, and accordingly prouided certaine slagons of poysoned wine to bee brought vnto the Cardinals vineyard, where the Pope had appointed to sup
                     •
                   giuing great charge vnto the messenger, that no body should meddle with the wine before himselfe came. Howbeit the Pope comming in very hote, and weary, sooner then hee was expected, and calling for drinke, when as yet no prouision was brought to the place; the messenger thinking the wine brought by him to bee but some excellent and choice stuffe reserued for the Popes own

cup, filled out of the same vnto him. While hée was yet drinking, in came his sonne, who not perceiuing the error, pledged his father The Pope (as being thirsty) tooke a great draught, and moreouer being very aged, died the next day. His sonne being yong, and happily not taking so much, applying also conuenient remedies, recouered; but lay sicke very long, which was the cause of his vtter ouerthrow at the last. Thus died that monster of his age Alexander the 6. And thus by his owne diuelish deuice came this Borgia to his destruction, whom Machiauel in his workes so much magnifieth. Guieciardine (that writeth this story) sayeth, that by the like practise, he and his Father had made away diuers other before that time as namely, the Cardinals of Capua and Mutina, men very louing and faithfull vnto them. At last it pleased God in this sort to serue them of their owne sauce, and to bring them into the pitte they had digged for other. Now to returne to Hadrian, he continued here 12. yeares, vntill that the yéere 1518. hee was depriued of this and all other promotions, and that vpon this occasion. A Cardinall of Rome called Alfonso Petruccio conspired with certaine other Cardinals, the death of Pope Leo 10. Amongst them, this our Hadrian was content to make one; moued thereunto, (as P. Iouius affirmeth) not by any grudge or priuate displeasure, but onely by an ambitious conceit, that surely hee should be Pope, if Leo were once dead. A certaine Witch or wise woman (as wee call them) hauing heretofore fore told him very strangely diuers things that had happened to himself &amp; other of his friendes: took vpon her to assure him, that after the death of Pope Leo, it should come to passe, that a certaine olde man named Hadrian, borne of meane parentage, preferred onely for his learning, wisdome

This conspiracy being come to the Popes knowledge; hee caused Cardinall Petruccius to bee apprehended, and shortly after executed. Comming then to the Consistory, hee openly signified, that hee was not ignorant, how diuers other Cardinals were to blame in that businesse, which so néerely concerning him, hee was neuerthelesse content fréely to giue pardon vnto so many as should then immediately confesse the fault. Hereupon Hadrian and some other falling downe vpon their knees, before him, acknowledged what they had done, and humbly besought him of mercy. Hee promised to bee as good as his word, and indeede so was. Howbeit Hadrian, eyther fearing the worst, or ashamed to shew his face, shortly after stale secretly away, and was neuer eyther séene or h

            THE BISHOPPES OF EXCETER. This discourse following is taken (for the most part) verbatim out of Master Iohn Hookers Catalogue of the Bishops of Exceter.
            
            
               THe countries of Deuonshire and Cornewall, after their conuersion vnto Christian Religion, were a while vnder the iurisdiction of the Bishoppe of the West Saxons, whose Sée was established at Dorchester. Afterwardes Winchester béeing appointed a Cathedrall See, about the yéere 660. All the West Country was allotted to the gouernement of the Bishop of that Church, and so continued vnder him till that the yéere 705. Sherborne was made a Cathedrall Church. Two hundred yéeres they were subiect vnto the Bishoppe of Sherborne, to witte, vntill the yéere 905. At what time Plegmund Archbishop of Canterbury, by the commandement of the King (as elsewhere I haue declared more at large) erected diuers new Sees, namely at Wels in Somersetshire one, in Cornewall another, &amp; a third in Deuonshire. The See of Athelstan the Bishoppe

of Cornewal, was for a while Saint Petrockes in Bodmyn, and afterwards Saint Germanes. Werstan Bishoppe of Deuonshire placed himselfe first at Lawton, but soon after remooued to Credyton, now called Kyrton: The successors of Athelstan in the Dioces of Cornwall (as I find) were th

            About the yeare 1040. (or soone after) Saint Peters church in Exceter was appointed the Sée for both Deuonshire, and Cornwall. And hath euer since that time so continued.
            NOw to come vnto the particular history of this Church you shall vnderstand, that amongst many religious houses erected heretofore in and about the City of Exceter, thrée there haue béene sometimes within the scite and circuite of that place, which now is called the close of S. Peters, The first of these was a house of Nunnes where the Deanes house and the Calender Hay or Uicars close doe now stand: The second was a Monastery for Monkes supposed to bée built by King Ethelred, the third sonne of King Ethelwolph, about the yeare 868. And the third was also for Monkes, to witte, of the Order of S. Benet, founded by King Athelstan, the yéere 932. therabout where the East parts of the church now called the Lady Chappell, standeth. Of this foundation thus one writeth.
            
               Hanc vrbē primus Rex Athelstanus, inpotestatem Anglorum effugatis Britonibus redactam, turribus muniuit &amp; muro ex quadratis lapidibus cinxit, ac antiquitus vocatum Muncketon, nunc Exeter vocari voluit; ac ibisedens, mansum quoddam dedit ad fundandum monasterium pro monachis

Deo &amp; Sancto Petro famulantibus. Now besides the great charges he was at in building: He gaue also sufficient lands and reuenues for their liuing, whereof Morkshut and Treasurers-beare, be yet remaining, and are appertaining to the Treasurer of the said Church. But after the time of K. Athelstane, the Danes with great hostility and cruelty hauing ouerrun this land, this City and Church was much infested and troubled: for with no lesse cruelty did the Danes pursue the Englishmen and Saxons, then did the Saxons before pursue the Britaines. And then the Monkes not able to endure the same, sted and forsooke their house, seeking places of refuge and better fafety And so was this Monastery left destitute, &amp; forsaken for sundry yeeres, vntill the time of King Edgar. He making a progresse into these West partes to visite Ordogarus Earle of Deuon. (whose daughter hee had married) came to this City, ann. 686. and pittying their distressed state, restored them their house &amp; liuelihoods: And appointed Sydemanus (who afterwards was Bishop) To bée their Abbot. After that, they continued together (although in great troubles) vntill the time of King Swanus the Dane. He with a great troupe and Army of his Danes came to this City, ann. 1019 besieged it, and at length hauing taken the same, spoyled, destroyed and burnt both City and Monastery. But yet shortly after it was againe restored: For King Canutus being aduertised of the great cruelties done by his Father Swanus; did at the request of one of his Dukes named Atheldredus, make restitution vnto Atheluoldus then Abbot, both of lands, liuings and priuiledges, as appeareth by his Charter, dated an. 1019. About 30. yeeres after this, K. Edward the Confessor comming to Exceter, by the aduise of Leophricus Bishop of Crediton, sometimes Lord Chancellour of England, and of his priuy Councel, partly for the better safety of the Bishop and his successors, and partly to prouide a more apt place for the Monks, translated the Bishops Sée from Credit
                  •
               n to Exceter, &amp; sent the Monks to Westminster. The Bishop then thus remooued from the old, and placed in the new: indoweth his new Sée with the lands and liuelihoodes of his former Church, pulled downe the two monasteries nere adioyning, the one of Nunnes, the other of

Monks, and addeth them to his owne Church. After Leophricus his successors following his example, did euerie of them for the most part indeuour the augmentation and increase of their Church, some in liuelyhoods, some in liberties and priuiledges, some in buildings, and some in one thing, some in another.
            
               ANno 1112. William Warwest the third Bishop of Exceter beganne to enlarge his Cathedrall church (which at that time was no bigger then that part which is called the Lady Chappell) and laied the foundation of that which is now the quier. Ann. 1235. or thereabouts. William Brewer Bishop appointed a Deane, whose name was Serlo, and a Chapter of fower and twenty prebendaries; Hee appropriated to the Deanrie Brampton and Coliton Rawleigh: For the Prebendaries he purchased lands, allotting to euery of them, the like portion of foure pound by the yeare. Anno 1284. Peter Quiuill Bishoppe, finding the Chauncel of his Church to be builded &amp; finished to his hands, built the lower part or body of his church from the quier westward: Hee also appointed a Chanter and a Subdeane in the Church: to the one he impropriated Painton and Cudleigh, and to the other the parsonage of Egloshalle in Cornwall. Moreouer he impropriated the Parsonage of Saint Newlin in Cornwall, &amp; of Stoke Gabriel in De

               onshire to the Chancellour of the Church, for reading of a Diuinity Lecture. Ann. 1340. Iohn Grandisson Bishop, did increase the length of his Church from the Font Westward, &amp; vaulted the roofe of the whole Church, so ending, and fully finishing the same.
            ABout the yeere of our Lord, 1450. Edmund Lacy began to build the Chapter house, and George Neuill finished it. The Cloisters were built by the Deane and Chapter.
            Hereby it appeareth, that from the first foundation of this church vnder K. Athelstane, vntill the time that Bishoppe Graundsone perfected the building thereof, it was aboue 400. yéeres, which notwithstanding, so vniformely the same is compact, as if by one and the same man it had béen plotted, begun, continued and ended.
         
         
            
            A Catalogue of the Bishops of Deuonshire.
            
               VVErstanus (called by some Adulphus) the first Bishop of Deuonshire was consecrated Bishop of this Dioces an 905. and had his Sée at Bishops Tawton. In the yeare following, viz. 906. hee died and was buried in his owne Church.
            
               PVtta after the death of Werstanus, was elected and consecrate Bishop, and had his Sée at Tawton. Hee taking his iourny towards Crediton to sée the king, (or as some say, Vffa the kings lieutenant) was by the said Vffas men slaine. Upon his death the See was remoued to Crediton.
            
               EAdulphus brother to Alsius Duke of Deuonshire and Cornewall, and founder of Launceston, was consecrated Bishop of Deuonshire, but installed at Crediton where he had his Sée, and continued Bishop 22. yeares. Hee died the yeare 932. and was buried in his owne Church. In his time K. Edward the elder, gaue vnto the Bishop of Crediton three mannors, to witte, Polton, Coeling and Lanwitham, &amp; that (as the history of the Church of Winchester reporteth) Vt inde singulis annis Visitaret gentem cornubiensem ad exprimendos corum errores: Nam antea in quantum potuerunt (saith the writer) Veritari resistebant, &amp; non decretis Apostolicis obediebant.
            
            
               EThelgarus an. 932. succéeded Eadulphus This Ethelgarus after he had béene Bishop ten years; he died and was buried in his owne Church.
            
               ALgarus an. 942. after Ethelgarus was constituted and installed Bishop at Crediton. And hauing beene Bishop about ten yeares died and was buried in his owne Church.
            
               
               ALfwoldus, as Matthew of Westminster writeth, was next Bishop after Algarus, and consecrated by the aduise of Dunstane ann. 952. He died 972. and was buried in his owne Church.
            
               ALwolfus safe nine yeares after Alfwoldus, and was buried in his owne Church.
            
               SYdemanus Abbot of S. Peters succéeded. In this man
                  •
                time the Danes ouercame and spoyled the whole countries of Deuonshire and Cornewall, burned the towne of Bodwyn, and the Cathedrall Church of Saint Petrokes, with the Bishops house. Whereupon the Bishops Sée was remooued from thence to Saint Germans, in which place it continued vntill the remoouing and vniting thereof vnto Crediton. Sydemannus anno. 977. died and was buried at Crediton in his owne Church.
            
               ALfredus (whom Dicetus calleth Alfricus) abbot of Malmesbury, was consecrated Bishop, and installed at Crediton. Hee was taken for a learned man, and wrote two bookes, the one intituled de rebus coenobij sui, and the other de rerum naturis. In his time King Etheldred endowed the Bishopricke of Saint Germans with lands, liberties, and priuileges. The Danes made a fresh inuasion vpon all Deuonshire and Cornewall, burned &amp; spoyled the Abbey of Ordolphus at Tauistorke, besieged Exceter, and being remooued from thence, were fought withall at Pynhow about 3. miles from the city and ouerthrowen. Alphredus after hee had béene Bishop about 9. yeeres, died an. 699. and was buried in his owne Church.
            
               ALwolfus (as Diocetus writeth) was the next Bishop. In his time Sweno king of Denmark by inticement of one Hugh then Earle of Deuonshire, came with a great host and besieged the city of Exceter, tooke it and burned it, and with great cruelty vsed the people, vntill in the end Almarus Earle of Deuonshire, and the gentlemen did yéelde &amp; submit themselues, and so obtained peace. This Alwolfus about the 15.

yéere of his Bishopricke 1030. died and was buried in his owne Church.

            THE BISHOPS OF EXCETER.
            
               THe first Bishop of Exceter, was Leofricus, a man (saith mine Authour) descended from the bloud and line of Butus, brought vp in Loreine, who was so well commended not only for his nobility, but much more for his wisedome and learning; that King Edward the Confessor had him in great fauour, and made him first one of the priuy Councell, then Chancelour of England, and lastly (the Bishopricke of this Dioces being void) he was preferred thereunto. By his means the Bishops Sée was remooued from Crediton to Exceter, the yéere 1049. (or thereabout) K. Edward the Confessor comming to Exceter, together with his Quéene; tooke order that the monks of S. Peters should be placed at Westminster (as before is mentioned) and remooued the Episcopall Sée from Crediton to this citie. It is remembred, that himselfe taking the Bishop by the right hand, and Ed

Hee made diuers statutes, and amongst other things, he ordained, that all his Canons or Prebendaries should lodge in one Chamber, and take their diet at one table. Hee appointed them likewise a steward that should prouide them victuals daily, and once in the yéere deliuered them new clothes. This kind of gouernment (saith William Malmesbury) hee learned in Lorrain
                  •
               , and it is (saith he) continued by the posterity, although by the corruption and luxury of our time somewhat altered and decaied. After that he had well and worthily ruled his Church and Diocesse, by the space of thrée and twenty yéeres, he ended his daies in peace Anno 1073. and was buried in the Cemitory or church-yard of his owne Church vnder a simple and a broken marble stone, which place by the sithence enlarging of his Church is now within the South Lower of the same, wherof of late Anno. 1568.

Hee first began to enlarge his Church (as aboue I haue mentioned) and obtained from the King Plympton, Brampton,

and Saint Stephens in Exceter. Brampton he gaue to his Cathedrall Church, and it was afterwards alotted vnto the Deane for a part of the corps of his Deanery. Saint Stephens with the Sée belonging to the same hee reserued to himselfe and his successors, who thereby are Barons and Lords in the Parliament. As for Plympton, hee gaue it vnto a Monastery which hee built there for regular Canons. In his latter daies he became blind: which imperfection notwithstanding, the king thought good to send him Embassador vnto Pope Paschalis the second, and hée dispatched the businesse commended vnto him, to the Kings great contentment. Not long after his returne; hauing small ioy of the world, he gaue ouer his Bishopricke &amp; became one of the regular Canons of his owne house at Plympton, where hee died 1127. and was buried, He was Bishop about 20. years.

others. He was estéemed also very deuout, holy, and a painfull Preacher. Matthew Paris in his report of the yeere 1161. telleth a long tale, of a certaine strange apparition or reuelation which happened vnto him in the countrey as hee visited his Dioces. He was a great aduersary of Thomas Becket. I maruell that any such thing might bee credibly reported of him.

Being returned home, and minding (as his predecessors had done) to leaue some good memoriall behind him, hee made a Deane, and constituted 24. Prebendaries within his Church. To the one he impropriated Brampton and Colyton Rawleigh; for the others he purchased so much land, as out whereof he assigned to euery prebendary lower pound by the yéere, and of these he ordained his chapter.

                Bishops men nothing regarding this prohibition, doe presse forwards to come ouer the water, and the others doe withstand so long, that in the end my Lords fryer is fallen into the water. The Bishop taketh this matter in such griefe, that a holy Fryer, a religious man, his owne chaplaine and confessor, should so vnreuerently be cast into the water, that he falleth out with the gentleman, and vpon what occasion I know not, he sueth him in the law, and so vexeth and tormenteth him, that in the end he was faine to yéeld himselfe to the Bishops deuotion, and séeketh all the waies he could to curry the Bishops good will, which he could not obtaine, vntill for redemption, hee had giuen and surrendred vp his patronage of Sowton, with a péece of land: All which the saide Bishop annexeth to his new Lordship.

He first began to enlarge and encrease his Church from the Channcell downewards, and layed the foundation thereof. In his time anno. 1285. Walter Lichlade the first Chaunter, was slaine in a morning as he came from the morning seruice then called the Mattens which was woont to be saide shortly after midnight; vpon which occasion the King came vnto this City, and kept his Christmas in the same, together with Elinor the Queene, and vpon diligent inquisition for the authors of the said murther, finding diuers culpable, he seuerely punished the same (as the Chronicles of Bruton report, but mistaking Oxon: for Exon:) causing Alfride the Maior of the city 4. other to be hanged, beside one Pikot and others that were long imprisoned for that offence. Moreouer an order was set downe for inclosing of the church yard, and building of certaine gates there, as appeareth by a composition betweene the Bishop and the citie, bearing date, in festo annuntiationis beatae Mariae, 1286. The king at the suite of the Earle of Hereford, (who at his being heere, was lodged in the house of the Gray Friers, which then was néere the house of Saint Nicholas) obtained of the Bishop, that they should bée remooued from thence to a more wholesome place without South gate; whereof after the 
                  •
               ings departure grew some controuersie, because the Bishop refused to performe his promise made to the king. This man also impropriated the parish of Saint Newlin, and the Parish of Stoke Gabriell, and vnited the same to the office of the Chauncellor of the Cathedrall Church; that the said Chauncellor

should continually read a lecture within the said Citie of Diuinity, or of the Decretals. In the eleuenth yéere of his Bishopricke he died, being choked in drinking of a Sirrope. and .1292. Hee was buried in the middle of the Lady Chappell. Upon his toombe is written, Petra tegit Petrum, nihil officiat sibi terrum. The Franciscanes or Gray Friers of this City, imputed his death to his hard dealing with them. For whereas hee had promised the King to prouide a conuenient place for them to build their house in, and had willed their warden, named Deodatus to séeke out and make inquiry for the same; yet notwithstanding when he had so done, because the same was within his Fée, swaruing from his said promise hee vtterly denied to performe the same, beeing disswaded by Peter Kenefield, a Dominicane or a blacke Frier, and Confessor vnto him the said Bishop: For he enuying the good successe of the Franciscanes, aduised the Bishop, in no wise to permit them to enioy the place which they had gotten. For (saith hee) as vnder colour of simplicity, they créepe into the harts of the people, and hinder vs poore Preachers from our gaines and liuings; so bee ye sure that if they put foote within your Liberties, they will in time find meanes to be exempted from out of your Liberty and iurisdiction. The Bishop being soone disswaded, vtterly forbiddeth them to build, or to do any thing within his Fée or liberty. About two yéeres after, the Bishop kept a great feast vpon the Sunday next before S. Francis day; And among others, Walter Winborne, one of the Kings chiefe Iustices of the bench, was inuited, who had béene present when the Bishop at the request of the King made promise to further and helpe the Franciscanes. He now in their behalfe, did put the Bishop in minde therof, and requested him to haue confideration both of his owne promise, and their distresse. The Bishop misliking this motion, waxed angry, and did not onely denye to yéelde thereunto, but wished himselfe to be choked what day soeuer he did consent vnto it. It fortuned that the same weeke, and vpon Saint Francis eue, the Bishop tooke a certaine Sirope to drinke, &amp; in too hasty swallowing thereof, his breath was stopped, and hee forthwith died. The Franciscanee hearing

thereof, made no little adoo about this matter, but blased it abroad, that Saint Francis wrought this miracle vpon the Bishop, because he was so hard against them.

She whether weary of her husband or prouoked by the insolency of the Spencers and other fauorites about the king; had long since determined to depose her husband from the kingdome, if possibly she might; and to set vp her sonne Prince Edward. Hauing therefore ridde away this Bishop, whose loyalty and faithfulnesse to his soueraign she well knew was vnmooueable; she began to put in practise the execution of this long plotted designement, &amp; in the ende (to be short) explored the same. While these matters were a brewing, it happened the king to take his iourney to Bristow; and he thought good to commit the gouernement and custody of the city of London to the fidelity of this Bishop. At what time therefore the Queene began to approach néere vnto the city with her power, he required the Maior to send vnto him the keies of the gates. The Commons (who altogether fauoured the Quéenes party) hearing this, and perceauing the Bishop purposed to withstand her; set vpon him violently, drew him into Cheapeside, and beheaded him there, together with Sir Richard Stapleton a Knight his, brother. Then they caried his body to his house without Templebar, (now called Essex house) &amp; buried it basely in a heape of land, in the backside of the same house. In this sorte did this worthy prelate loose his life, in defence of his Prince; and that by their meanes, who of all other, were bound in the strongest bands of duty &amp; alleageance to haue done as he did, I mean

This murther was committed Octob. 15. 1326. And his funerals were solemnised at Exceter March. 28. following. The yéere 1316. he erected two houses in Oxford for the better increase

Moreouer it is to be remembred, that he was a special benefactor vnto the hospitall of Saint Iohns in Exceter; to which he impropriated for the releeuing of certaine poore children, the Rectory or personage of Ernscombe.

After his returne home to his Bishopricke, hee spent his time altogether in adorning and beautifying of his Church, or building and erecting some good monument or other. He founded the Colledge of S. Mary Otrey, and endowed the same with great and goodly liuelihoods; Hee was a liberall Benefactor to the Uicars Chorall of his owne Church, as also to the Colledge of Glaseney in Peryn: he builded the two last Arches in the West end of his Church, vaulted the roofe of all the Church, and fully ended the buildings of the same.

Hee was alwaies very frugall, kept no more men or horses about him then necessary, and euer despised the vanity of al outward pomp. But this it was not that enabled him to performe these great works, and yet to leaue so much money behind him. He procured an order to be taken, that all Ecclesiasticall persons of his Diocesse, at the time of their deaths, should leaue and bequeath their goods to him, or to some other in trust towards his chargeable buildings, or otherwise to be bestowed in pios vsus at his discretion. This was the meanes whereby he grew to this infinite wealth &amp; riches. He died Iuly 15. 1369. hauing sate Bishop heere almost 42. yéeres, and was buried in a Chappell which he built in the wall of the West end of his Church. His funerals by his owne commaundement were performed without any manner of pompe or extraordinary solemnity.

He was a man very well learned, expert as wel in politick, gouernmēt, as ecclesiasticall matters, &amp; in both these respects greatly reuerenced and estéemed.

For which cause, at the parliament holden at Westminster in the tenth yéere of K. Richard the second, he was chosen to be one of the twelue Péeres of the Realme vnder the King. He was a benefactor to the callender hay of the Uicars chorall of his owne Church, supplied in buildings, and otherwise what his predecessors had left vndone, and hauing béen Bishop 24. yeeres, died at Clist the 3. of December, ann. 1394. and was buried in the North side of the body of his owne Church, in a little Chappell standing between two pillers.

A man of more deuotion then learning, somewhat rough in speech, but indeed and action friendly. Hee was carefull in the sauing and defending of his liberties, for which continuall sutes were betweene him and the Abbot of Tauestocke. He was also liberall to the Uicars Chorall of his Church, and reduced them to the keeping of Commons:

Towards the maintenance whereof, hee gaue them certaine reuenues, and impropriated vnto them the rectory of Cornwood. Albeit he were not very well learned, yet a great fauourer and a furtherer of learning hee was. Hee sounded a goodly free Schoole at Manchester.

He chanced to die excommunicate at the suite of the Abbot of Tauistocke, Iune 25. 1519. and might not bee buried vntill an absolution was procured from Rome.

                although he were wel reported of for his learning, yet better liked for his courtlike behauiour, which in the end turned not so much to his credite, as to the vtter ruine and spoile of the Church. For of two and twenty Lordships and Mannours which his Predecessers had left vnto him of a goodly yearely reuenew, hee left but 7. or 8. and them also leased out: And where hée found 14. houses well furnished, he left onely one house bare and without furniture, and yet charged with sundry fées and annuities. By these meanes this Bishopricke which sometimes was counted one of the best, is now become in temporall lands one of the meanest. Hee was a great fauourer

of learned men, and especially of Diuines, whom he preferred in his Church aboue others, Hée was very bounteous and liberall vnto all men, but especially vnto Courtiers, vnto his owne kindred and countrimen. He bestowed much also, as well paines as cost, in building Sutton Coltshuill, (the towne where hee was borne) in procuring the same to bee incorporate, and endeuouring to set vp the making of Kerfies there, all which proued to little purpose as I haue heard. In his time after the death of K. Henry the 8. there was an alteration of religion by K. Edward the 6. whereof ensued rebellion and a commotion in this Dioces, which in some part was imputed to this Bishop, because he lay farre from his Diocesse, and dwelled in his owne Country. Whereupon he resigned the Bishopricke into the Kings hands, after hee had béene Bishop about thirty yeares, and liued by the rents of the temporalty of the Bishopricke, which when he alienated he did reserue vnto himselfe for terme of his owne life.

               KIng William the first substituted his chaplain Arfastus in the place of Eglemarus, by whose aduise the See was

translated from Elmham to Thetford, a man very vnlearned, and of no extraordinary parts at all. William Malmsbury reporteth, that being Chaplaine to the Conquerour, who was then but Duke of Normandy, hee would needes make a iourney to Becco where Lanfranke was then Abbot, as also where Arfastus had beene a Monke, and well estéemed of for his learning, because that before Lanfrank

                   comming hee was Luscus inter Strabones amongst a number of drones méerely vnlearned, a little smattering of learning he had, made a faire shew. But now by this time by Lanfrankes meanes, that Monastery was become euen a very Uniuersity, flourishing with all knowledge of good letters. Hether Arfastus comming after a pompous and bragging manner, attended with a great troupe: Lanfranke who at the first blush, by and by espied the fellowes ignorance, caused an Abcee to be laide before him, ferociam hominis Italica facetia illudens. This ieast Arfastus so tooke to hearte, as hee neuer lynne till hee had caused the Duke to banish Lanfranke out of Normandy. Howbeit when Lanfranke came to take his leaue of the Duke, hapning to ride vpon a lame iade; the Duke fell into such a great laughter at the halting of his horse, as in that merry mood, by meanes of some friends hee was quickly reconciled to him againe.
            
            
               William Herbert last of Thetford, and first Bishoppe of Norwich.
               
                  VVIlliam surnamed Galfagus succéeded him in Thetford, A man very famous for his excellent learning. He was borne at Oxford. His father was Robertus de Losinge Abbot of Winchester. This Herbertus being Prior of the Monastery of Fiscanum in Normandy, came into England at the request of William Kufus, and liuing in the Court for a time, behaued himselfe in such sort, that hée was much fauoured of the king, and obtained diuers great preferments at his hands, whereby it came to passe, that within the space of thrée yéeres, he had so feathered his nest, as hée could buy for his father, the Abbacy of Winchester, and for

himselfe this Bishopricke, paying to the king for the same as it is reported the summe of 1900. l. For satisfaction of which Symony this pennance was enioyned him by Paschalis the Pope, that he should build certaine Churches and Monasteries as afterwards he did. Hee translated the Sée from Thetford to Norwich, &amp; built there the Cathedrall Church at his owne charges, laying the first stone of the foundation with his owne hands as this elogium declareth, which hee caused to bee engrauen vpon the wall: Hunc primum huius templi lapidem, dominus Herebertus posuit in nomine patris &amp; silij &amp; spiritus sancti, Amen. This Church he dedicated to the blessed Trinity, endowing it with great landes and possessions, bookes and all other necessaries. Hauing finished it according to his mind, he thē determined to build an house for himself (for as yet he had none in Norwich, the Sée béeing so lately remooued from Thetford) and therfore on the north side of the Church he founded a stately pallace. Againe, hee built fiue Churches; one ouer against the Cathedrall church on the other side of the riuer called S. Leonards, another at Norwich also, another at Elmham, a fourth at Linne, and a fift at Yarmouth. He departed this life, Iuly 22. in the yéere of our Lord, 1119.

In his time there was a dangerous sedition raysed betweene the Citizens of Norwich, &amp; the Monkes of the Cathedrall Church; the history whereof, is brieflie thus: In a Faire that was kept before the gates of the Priory, there hapned a fray, in which some seruants of the Couent flew certaine Citizens. A Iury being empannelled hereupon, found them guilty, and the officers tooke order for the apprehending of the murtherers if they might bee met withall. The Monkes greatly offended herewith, first excommunicated the Citizens, then shutting the gates, not onely prepared themselues to defence, but also beganne to offend the other, shooting at the passengers first, and afterward issuing out of their gates, killing diuers persons, and spoyling many houses. The Citizens greatly incensed herewith, fired the gates, entred the Monastery, and after a long conflict, a great number being slaine on both sides, preuailed, risled the Priory, and set fire on the same in diuers places at

once. This fire consumed not onely the celles and offices of the monks, but the almes house also, the stéeple and greatest part of the Cathedrall Church. The king hearing of this tumult (king Henry the third) with all speede posted thither, and caused diuers Citizens to bee hanged, drawne and quartered: Amongst the rest that were executed, a woman that flest carried fire to the gates was burned. The monkes for their part appealed to Rome, and so handled the matter, that they not onely escaped punishment, but also forced the Citizens to pay them 3000 markes, after 500. markes a yéer toward the reparation of their Church, and to present them with a Paxe of gold of seuen pound waight. This end was made by King Edward th

                  WIlliam Bateman Doctor of the Ciuill Law, a Cambridge man, borne at Norwich, and Archdeacon of the same, was next elected Bishop by the generall consent of the whole Couent: a stout man and of such courage as hee could not by any meanes be brought to Impaire and diminish the priuiledges or liberties of his Church, although hee were oftentimes by many of the nobility incited thereunto: alway to the vttermost of his power resisting and punishing the sacrilegious drifts of them, which attempted the same. Amongest the rest it is remembred, that the Lord Morly hauing killed certaine déere in one of his parkes, and ill intreated his keepers, he forced the noble man, to carry a burning Taper in his hand through the stréetes of Norwich vnto the high Altar.

Furthermore whereas the estate of his Bishopricke was very litigious before his time, he neuer rested, vntill hee had rid it from all strife and contention, obtaining also of Pope Clement all the fruits and reuenues of the vacant Churches in Norwich, which he left vnto his successors. He burlded Trinity hall in Cambridge, giuing certaine lands for the maintenance thereof. He founded also the hall of the Anunciation of our Lady, and bestowed one of the Uniuersity chests. And prouoking other men to imitate his good example; he perswaded one Gonwell to found another hal in the same vniuersity, which of late at the cost and charges of Iohn Caius a learned Phisition hath beene very much enlarged. At what time K. Edward the third laid claime first vnto the crowne of France, he made choice of this Bishop to informe the Pope of his title.

This Wulstan was borne at Hichenton in Warwickshire. His Father and Mother (whose names were Eatstan and Wulgeoue) long before their death seuered themselues by mutuall consent, and lead a Monasticall life: Then, as though heauen were not to be entred without a monks Cowle, they not only caused their sonne to be taught and brought vp in the Monastery of Peterborough, but also exhorted him earnestly (especially his Mother) in any wise to become a monke. Hee did so, followed their direction, &amp; professed himselfe a monk at Worceter vnder Brittegus his predecessor. He was by &amp; by much admired for the straight life heled; and for the opinion men had of his holinesse so estéemed, as no preferme might fall whereof he was capable, but immediately it was cast vpon him. He was first made Master of the children, then Chaunter and Treasurer of the Church, after Prior there, then Abbot of Glocester, and lastly Bishop of that Dioces. It is said, he refused obstinately to yeeld consent vnto his election a long time, protesting he had rather lay his head vpon a blocke to be chopt off, then to take so great a charge vpon him. No man

could perswade him to yéeld, vntill that one Wulsiu
                     •
                  
                an Anchorite reprehended him sharply for his backwardnes; assuring him, he offended God much in the same. His excuse was, want of learning: And certaine it is, that his defect that way, was so notable, as in the time of Wil. Conquerour (when all English Prelates were sifted to the branne) hée was called in question for insufficiency, and had beene depriued (as it is thought, at least wise) if hée had not beene found somewhat more sufficient then was expected. Hee was consecrate September 8. 1062. by Aldred Archbishop of Yorke, Stigand being then suspended. But that he might acquite himselfe from vsurpation of any right belonging to Canterbury, he not only required him to make his oath of profession vnto Canterbury, but also renounced all right of pretended iurisdiction vnto the Dioces of Worceter, acknowledging the same to belong not to Yorke (as some of his predecessors had affirmed) but to Canterbury, as to the Metropolitane of the same. Now to come vnto his gouernment, we are to remember especially two things memorable of him. One, the building of the Cathedrall Church, which he raised from the foundation. At what time it was come vnto such perfection, as that the monkes forsaking their olde habitation, betooke themselues vnto this new built; the other Fabrike whereof Oswald was Author, (as in Yorke you may read more at large) was pulled down. Which Wulstan séeing, burst o

               ontrariwise are double diligent in laying heaps of stones, so to frame a materiall Temple, but are too too negligent in setting forward the building of that liuely Temple the Church of God. The other thing that I determined to mention is, a notable testimony of his loyall fidelity vnto his Prince. All most all the Nobility of England rebelled against the king William Rulus the eight yéere of his raigne. Certaine of them, Roger
               
Earle of Mount-gomery, Barnard Newmarket, Roger Lacy, Ralfe Mortimer and other, attempted to take the City of Worceter. This Bishop, not onely resisted them, and by continuall exhortations in preaching and otherwise contained them in very dutifull obedience, but also arming such a number of people as the citty could affoord, caused them to sally out and set vpon the enemy, whom they discomfited, killing and taking a number of them prisoners. He died being welneere 90. yeares of age, 1095. Ianuary 19. which day afterwards (he being canonised) was made a holy day, &amp; appointed vnto the celebration of his memory. Hee was buried in his owne Church, néere to the place where K. Iohn was after buried. For I finde that the said K. vpon his death beb, desiring to be laid beside him was accordingly interred betwéene him and S. Oswald. How the Church being burnt his toombe onely escaped the violence of the fire, how hee appeared vnto his olde friend Robert Bishop of Hereford (being at Créeklade) at the hou

This man had so great affection vnto Westbury, a place néere Bristow, as hee not onely bestowed excéeding great cost vpon the Colledge there, and chose it for his place of buriall, but also intended (as I finde reported) to haue honoured it with a part of his Style, and to haue taken vpon him the name of the Bishop of Worceter and Westbury. There had beene an olde Colledge in that place long before: Hee pulled it downe, and in the new building enlarged it very much, compassing it about with a strong wall embatled, adding a faire gate with diuers towers (more like vnto a Castle then a Colledge) and lastly bestowed much good land for augmonting the reuenew of the same. One W. Canning that hauing beene fiue times Mayor of Bristow, in the latter end of his life became Deane of this Colledge, built the Church of Ratcliffe néere Bristow (a notable worke) and lieth buried in the same. But to return to our Bishop (who also built the Gatehouse at Hartlebury) hauing first resigned his Bishopricke, hee died at Bishops North wéeke, and was buried (as before said) at Westbury, where saith Iohn Rossus) hee is famous for his miracles.

Hée resigned (together with Doctor Shaxton Bishoppe of Salisbury) Iuly 1. and afterwardes, to witte, the sixteenth of October, 1555. sealed the doctrine which hee had long preached with his blood, ending his life in the fire: For the circumstances whereof, as also of his whole life and actions, I referre you to Master Foxe.

Mary 2. refused to returne. Whereupon his Bishopricke was bestowed vpon Master Latymer. Certaine it is, that hee subscribed to the Councell of Trent, by the name of Rich. Patus Wigorne Episc. Queene Mary lest shee should séeme to doe him wrong, hauing appointed Heath to the Archbishopricks of Yorke, restored him to Worceter.

               1056. Chaplaine vnto Duke Harald succéeded him. Mat. Westminster giueth this testimony of him, that he was vndoubtedly, Dei famulus, in omni religione perfectus, Ecclesiarum amator, pauperum recreator, viduarū &amp; orphanorum defensor, oppressorū subuersor, virginitatis possessor. Griffin King of Wales, hauing ouerthrown the forces of the Englishmen about two miles from Hereford, immediately assaulted the City, tooke it, slew the Bishop and seuen of the

Canons, they denied him entrance into the Church, &amp; held it against him; spoyled it of all the Reliques and ornaments that were portable, and lastly fixed both Church, City and all. This Bishop being yet starse warm in his eat, was thus slaine, Iune 16. 1056. when he had beene Bishop but onely twelue weekes and foure dayes.

He being translated thence to Yorke, Walter borne in Lorraine, and Chaplaine to Queen Edith, was consecrate at Rome by the Pope, the yéere 1060. His end was much more vnhappy then his predecessors. Hee chanced to fall in loue with a certaine comely woman that hee met in the stréet. A long time he contended with this vile and vnséemely affection; and he thought he had quenched the same

                when a small occasion renued it to his destruction. Hauing certaine linnen to cut out, this woman was commended to him for a very cunning Seamster. He sent for her, &amp; his olde flame of filthy desire easily kindling by this little sparke, hee found errands to send his men out of the way, while hee set vpon her, first with words, and they not preuailing by force. She resisted what shée might, but finding him too strong for her, thrust her shéeres into his belly, and gaue him his deaths wound. This W. Malmsbury telleth by hearesay of an vncertaine relation, adding moreouer, that the king being desirous it should be estéemed false, forbid the report of it. No other Historiographer liuing néere those times maketh any mention of this so memorable an accident, and therefore it is possible to be vntrue.

kind much admired in those daies. There was a great league of friendship betwéen him and Saint Wulstan, who certifyed him of his owne death in a dreame (as our stories report) called him to his buriall, and assured him he might not stay long after. It fell out true, for within halfe a yeere after the other, he deceased, Iune 26. 1095, Now he foresaw the death of Remigius Bishop of Lincolna by Astrology, and therefore refused to come to the dedication of his new Church, I haue related in Lincolne. He built his Church of Hereford anew, following the platforme of the Church of Aken or Aquisgraue, and lieth buried in the same, by the Northwall, a little aboue the Chappell of Bishop Stanbery, as the inscription (at leastwise) importeth. For my part I am perswaded, that he rather lieth in that toombe which is ascribed to Bishoppe Raynelm, for that the image of the same holdeth the figure of a Church in his hand, which mee thinkes argueth the builder of the Church to bee in that place enterred.

Hee was so farre from importuning him in this matter, as being now perswaded his election to be vnsufficient, he renounced the same, deliuering

                  WIlfride Archbishop of Yorke being banished by Egfride King of Northumberland (as in Yorke you may reade more at large) hee thought good to occupy his talent by preaching the worde of God amongst the South Saxons. Edilwalch the King of that countrey, a little before his comming
                  •
                had receiued the faith of Christ, by the perswasion of Wlfhere king of Mercia. He willing to increase his owne knowledge, and desirous that his subiects should be directed the way of saluation; made very much of Wilfride, and assigned him an habitation in Seolsey, a place all compassed about with the sea except one way. All that land, containing eighty seuen housholds, this king gaue vnto Wilfride for his maintenance. Hee built a monastery there, and established his Cathedrall Sée in the same. Now it pleased God so to blesse his labours, as in a short time, great numbers of the people being conuerted, embraced Christian religion: And a day being appointed for their Baptisme, they had no sooner receiued the same, but immediately it rained plentifully, the want whereof had caused a

and that so great, as not onely many died daily for hunger, but great numbers ioyning hand in hand forty or fifty in a company, threw themselues headlong into the sea, choosing rather to die than to endure that torment of hunger any longer. Thus it pleased God, at once to deliuer these men from temporall death by famine, and euerlasting destruction that their ignorance threatned vnto them. Neither was this all the good that Wilfride did vnto them. Their sea and riuers abounding with great store of good fish which they knew not how to take, he taught them to fish, &amp; caused great store of fish to be caught, wherewith many poore people were greatly relieued. Hauing staid fiue yeares there, he was called home in to his owne countrey againe, and restored to his Archbishopricke of Yorke.

               n his duety. Neither could hee euer be induced to forsake the saide Archbishop, vntill hee seemed to forsake his owne cause by

flying the country. After that, when the king was content to winke at the mariage of many Priests in the realme (vnto whome (I meane married Priests) the Archbishop was a grieuous and heauy aduersary) and receiued of them yearely a great summe of money for defending them against the austerity of the other, (to wit Anselme) this Bishop resisted the collection of that mony in his Dioces, calling it the tribute of fornication; and when (notwithstanding his resistance) it was paied, hee interdicted his owne Dioces, commaunding the Church-doores euery where to bee stopped vp with thornes. The king (a wise and gentle Prince, Henry the first) whether not vouchsafing to contend with him, or taking his well meaning in good part, was not onely content to pardon this disobedience, but also bestowed the money so gathered in his Dioces vpon him, saying it was a poore Bishopricke and néeded such helpes. And certaine it is, that before the comming of this man, it was indéede exceeding poore. Hee increased it wonderfully, and yet notwithstanding built his Cathedrall Church of Chichester from the ground. It was scarcely finished, when as May the fifth, 1114. it was quite defaced, and a great part of the city consumed with casuall fire. Hee found meanes to repaire it againe, beeing helped much with the liberality of the king and some other. This Bishop sate many yeares, (the certaine time I know not) and drawing toward his end, deliuered vnto the poore with his owne hands whatsoeuer he had in the world, leauing himselfe scarce clothes to couer him.

his Monks of Rochester, was long and continuall debate. By occasion whereof, hee tooke away from them all their mooueable goods, all the ornaments of their Church, their writings and euidences, yea and a great part of their landes, possessions and priuiledges. Wanting money to folow their suites against him, they were forced to coyne the siluer of S. Paulines shrine into money. These Controuersies were ended no otherwise then by his death, which hapned Iune, 24. 1214. But their hatred against him was so far from dying with him, as they would affoord him no manner of obsequies, but buried him most obscurely, or rather basely, without eyther ringing, singing, or any other manner of solemnity. The Hospitall at Strowde néere Rochester (called Neworke) was built, founded, and by him endowed with those possessions it now enioyeth, to wit, the value of fiftie two pound yéerely reuenue.

Within two yéeres after it happened that Richard the elect of Canterbury, Hugh of Ely and Roger of London, were to be consecrated. Ioceline Bishop of Wels challenged the performance of this Ceremony as due to him, for that he was the most ancient Bishop of the Prouince of Canterbury. But this Bishop of Rochester alleadged it belonged to this Sée (Canterbury being void) to consecrate al the Bishops of that Prouince. With much adoo, this agréement was made betwéene them, that Rochester should consecrate the Archbishop, &amp; Ioceline of Welles the other two. Another thing is remembred of this Bishop, scarse worthie the rehearsall, which yet I will not omit, to shew how apte men euen of the grauest sort were to be deceiued, &amp; deluded in those times. Preaching at Sittingborn before a great audience, at a time when he gaue generall orders, hee declared openly, that God had reuealed vnto him now thrée seuerall times, how that such a day the soules of King Richard the 1. Stephen Langton late Archbishop, and another Priest were

deliuered out of Purgatory, and no more soules that day but onely they thrée. He died February 24. 1235.

He was consecrate 1238. died 1250, and was buried in the Church of Westminster by the Kings speciall commandement, for that hee was accounted a very holy and vertuous man.

Boniface the Archbishoppe of Canterbury vsed this man hardly, inuading his possessions, &amp; violently taking from him without all right diuers things of olde belonging to his Sée.

            THE BISHOPPES OF OXFORD.
            
               ABout the yeare of our Lord 730. there liued a Duke of Oxford, (our histories term him so) called Didan or Didacus. He had a daugther of excellent beauty named Frideswyde, who though shée had many importunate suters, men of great wealth and nobility, yet desiring to serue God in such sort as she thought might bee most acceptable vnto him, would néeds dedicate her selfe vnto a sole and monasticall life. Amongest the rest of her wooers, there was one, a young Gentlemen of great power (some say hee was king of Leicester) whose name was Algarus. Hee not preuailing by intreaty, thought to vse force, and vpon a time, getting company about him, had almost seased vpon his desired pray: which he had so narrowly be set, as she had no way to escape his his hands, but by flying into a wood. Thither also he followed her, and that so neere, an leauing it, shee had much adoo to recouer Oxford. Perceiuing then that neither she was able to flye any further for wearinesse, nor yet to withstand him there, shée called vnto God for assistance against this importunate louer, who

thereupon (as the story saith) was miraculously stricken blind; And he continued in that case, till by her prayers he recouered his sight againe. Upon this occasion (saith William Malmsbury and the rest of our Histories) the Kings of England tooke a conceit, that it was not safe for any Prince to enter Oxford, in so much, as euery one, being loath to venture the triall of it in himselfe, it was euer auoided by them, till the time that King Henry the third prooued it altogether vaine by his owne experience. Howbeit it appeareth their report in that behalf to be vntrue, for that both before the conquest and after many kings repayred thether, as Burchardus, Almedus, Canutus, Harold, K. Stephen, Henry 1. and the second with some other. In this place, Didan, by the intreaty of his daughter, built a Monastery for Nunnes, and appointed her the Abbesse. It happened then about the yeare of grace 847. in the time of King Egelred, that certaine Danes flying into this Monastery to saue their liues from the bloudy cruelty of the English pursuing them; when otherwise they could not be gotten out, the Monastery was fired, and they all burnt in the same; But it was réedified shortly after by the same kng, and further enriched with diuers possessions. This notwithstanding, soone after it fell into wonderfull great decay, so as no body caring to inhabite the same, it was giuen by William the Conqueror vnto the Abbey of Abingdon for a Cell or remoouing house. They not greatly esteeming it, were content that Roger Bishop of Salisbury their Ordinary, should confirme it unto one Guimundus, Chaplaine vnto King Henry the first, a man wise, learned, and religious, that tooke vpon him to place Regular Channons in the same. Hee did so the yeare 1110. became Prior of this new (or rather renewed) Monastery himselfe, took other vnto him, repaired in very good sort the ruinous buildings, and by the fauour of King Henry the first recouered vnto it what lands soeuer had beene giuen héeretofore vnto the Nunnes. In this state then it continued, vntill that Cardinall Woolsey get licence for conuert it into a Colledge 1524. calling it by the name of the Cardinals Colledge. He leauing it vnperfect, King Henry the eight gaue it a foundation, the stile whereof hee first appointed to be Collegium Regis Henrici

octaui. But afterwards determining to place an Episcopall see at Oxford, and altering his purpose for Oseney (where once he had seated it, entitling the Church, Ecclesia, B. Mariae de Oseney) he translated that sée to the foresayd colledge; placing in it a Bishop, a Deane, eight prebendaries, a Quier, and other officers, besides a hundred students to bée maintained in the same, (of which number my selfe somtimes was one) and finally enstiled it, Ecclesia Christi, Cathedralis Oxon. ex fundatione Regis Henrici Octaui.

About fiue yeares after, to wit, an. 1546. it was remoued vnto Church, then commonly called the Cardinals colledge, and Osney suppressed. This Robert King beeing yet Abbot of Osney, was consecrate a titulary Bishop by the name of Episcopus Roanensis, which is a Sée in the Prouince of the Archbishopricke of Athens.

            THE BISHOPPES OF PETERBOROVGH.
            
               IN the middle of the riuer of Nen (which runneth by the south side of Peterborough) there is a whirlpoole of infinite depth, that by reason of springs continually arising there, in the coldest winter was yet neuer quite frozen ouer. This place in olde time was called Medeswel, &amp; the towne adioyning) taking name of it) Medeswell hamstead, or Medeshamstead.

but was taken away by the treachery of his wife before hée could bring it to any perfection. Wolpher his brother was so farre from endeuouring to finish this worke, as being an obstinate Pagan, he put to death Wolfal and Ruffyn, two of his owne sons, for no other cause then this, that they were Christians. Afterwards notwithstanding it pleased God so to tou

                became a good Paul, and in token of his griefe &amp; sorrow for his cruelty to his two sons, determined to build vp this Monastery in the most magnificent and stately manner he could deuise, which indéed he performed, being very much holpen in the same by the contribution of Ethelred his brother, as also of Kineburg, and Kineswith his sisters, who as (W. Malmsbury deliuereth) do ther
                  •
                lye buried. This Monastery he dedicated vnto S. Peter, and appointed one Saxulf (by whose perswasion he tooke in hand this worke) to be the first Abbot of the same. (He afterwards became Bishop of Lichfield.) Two hundred years after the first foundation, and somewhat more, it flourished in wealth, and great prosperity, to wit, vntill the comming of the Danes, who slew the Monkes, and vtterly destroyed all those sumptuous buildings erected by Wolpher. Hauing then layen desolate 109 yeares; Ethelwold Bishop of Winchester (a great Patron of Monkery) reedified it. He had begun a new foundation at Oundale in Northamptonshire, when by chance comming to this place, he thought good to omit that former and to bestow his cost héere. So he made a pa
                  •
               ish Church of his building at Oundale, and reedified this decayed Monastery of Medeshamstead. In digging vp some of the old foundation
                  •
               , it is remembred there were found stones of such huge greatnes, as eight yoke of Oren were scarce able to draw one of them away. King Edgar holy the Bishop much in this foundation, &amp; Aldulf that was Chauncellor vnto the said King, partly for deuotion, partly for malecontentment &amp; gréefe, that he had layen vpon his onely child and so stisled him in his sléepe, bestowed all his substance vpō it, and betaking himselfe vnto a Monasticall life, became Abbot there. After him Kenulsus another Abbot compassed this Monastery with a strong wall about, the yeare of our Lord 1000. And then saith W. Malmsbury) because it bare the

shew of a towne or burrough, it began to leaue the old name, and to be called altogether Burgh or Burrough; and sometimes (because it was dedicated vnto Saint Peter) Peterburrough. Through the liberality of diuers benefactors it grew to that greatnes of wealth and posse

In that state it continued in that fatall day of all our Monasteries, at what time it pleased King Henry the eight to conuert the same into a Cathedrall Church, and to imploy the reuenues vpon the maintenance of a Bishop, a Deane, sixe Prebendaries, and other Ministers necessary for the celebration of Diuine seruice. Northamptonshire and Rutlandshire were taken from Lincolne, and appointed the Dioces of this new erected Sée.

            THE BISHOPPES OF S. DAVIDS.
            
               THe Brittish histories doe all report that in this Island at the first planting of Christian Religion heere, there were established 28. Episcopall Sées (as in S. Aug. of Canterbury I haue before declared.) Of these 28.3. were Archbishopricks, London Yorke &amp; Carlegion or Carleon vpon Uske in Monmouthshire. At Carleon (which was then a great and populous City) in the time of K. Arthur, sate Dubritius the sonne of Eurdila a gentlewoman of great birth, but who was his Father it was neuer knowen. He was a man of excellent learning and singular integrity, in regard whereof, when first he had taken great paines many yeares, as well in teaching and reading vnto his schollers (whereof hee had a great number) as in preaching vnto the people; he was made Archbishop of all Wales, by Germanus &amp; Lupus two Bishops of France, that were intreated by Aurelius Ambrosius the king or ruler of Britaine, to come ouer and yéeld their best holpe for extinguishing the Pelagian heresie, that had then taken great roote in this Country. And they appointed his Sée to bee at Landaff, which soone after was remoued to Caerlegion vpon Usk in Monmouthshire. Aurelius Ambrosius beeing dead, hee crowned. Vther Pendragon, and afterward that great Arthur
               
king of this Island, and waxing olde, resigned his Bishoprick vnto Dauid a disciple of his. Hee died and was buried in the Isle of Enlhi, now called Bardsee (where hee ledde a solitary life many yeares) Nou. 14. anno 542. His bones were afterward remoued to Landaff by Vrbanus Bishop there, May 7. 1120 &amp; laid before the altar of our Lady toward the North.
            
               1. Saint Dauid.
               
                  DAuid before named, was vncle vnto king Arthur, and son of Xantus a Prince of Wales, begotten vpon one Melearia a Nunne. A man very learned, eloquent, and of incredible austerity, of life and conuersation. Hee was also very tall of stature, and of a comely personage. By his diligence, Pelagianisme was quite rooted out, and many earnest prosessors of the same conuerted vnto the trueth. With the consent of king Arthur, he remooued his Sée from Caerlegion to Menenia, which euer since of him is called of the Welch Twy Dewi, and of vs Saint Dauids. A place neither pleasant, fertile, or safe: For (as Giraldus Cambr. reporteth of it) it is neither furnished with wood, watered with riuers, beautified with medowes, nor inriched with any kinde of fruitfull soile; affoording plentifully nothing but rockes and barren hils, vehement winds and tempests, and lastly the dangers and iniuries whereunto solitary places n
                     •
                  ere the Sea are subiect by Pyrates and otherwise. It séemeth he misliked the frequency of people at Caerlegion, as a meanes to withdraw him from contemplation, whereunto that hée might hée more frée, hee made choice of this place for his Sée rather then for any fitnesse of the same otherwise. He sate long, to witte, 65. years, and died at last, ann. 642. (hauing first built 12. Monasteries in the Countrey thereabout) being now 146. yeares of age, as Bale out of the British histories reporteth. He was buried in his owne Cathedrall Church, and some 5. hundred yeares, after Canonised a Saint by Pope Calixtus the second. Many things are reported of him incredible, &amp; therefore not worth rehearsing, although I doubt not but God affoorded many miracles to the first infancy of our Church, neither therefore would I be so peremptory in derogating too much from such

reports, as we sée no reason why they may not bée true, Of him they say, that his birth was foretold 30. yéeres before hand, that he was alwayes attended by an Angell that kept him company, that hee bestowed vpon the waters at Bathe that extraordinary heat they haue,) and (to repeate no more, for this is much more then any discréet man wil belieue) that vpon a time preaching to a great multitude of people, at Breuy the plaine ground grew vp in their sight, and increased vnder his feet vnto a prety hillock.
            
            
               
                  After Saint Dauid sate successiuely these, as Giraldus setteth them downe.

               Of these foreuamed Bishops, vntill Sampson, there remaineth

little or no memoriall, but their names onely. In his time, the Sée of Saint Dauid had seuen Bishops Suffragans subiect vnto it (as the foresaid antiquity declareth) to wit, Exceter, Bathe, Hereford, Landaff, Bangor, Saint Assaph, and Fernes in Ireland. Roger Houeden (which I account more likely) reckoneth these, Landaffe, Lanpatern in Cardigan shire, Bangor, Saint Assaph, Chichester, Hereford &amp; Worceter. While he was Bishop it happened the people of all that Country were wonderfully vexed with the Iaundise, so as great numbers of them died dayly of that disease. By the importunity of his Clergy and Disciples, he was induced to flie the Country, and sayled into Britaine, where the Bishopricke of Dola being void, he was straight way elected vnto the same. Hee had brought thither with him the Archiepiscopall pall of Saint Dauid, and vsed it during his life, as did also his Successors there for many yéers, vntill they were compelled by the Pope, at the suite of the Arcbishop of Turon to leaue it, and make profession of obedience vnto him, as in former times. By this occasion it fel out that the successors of Sampson in Saint Dauids, what for want of their pall, or for pouerty or negligence, or by some other occasion, lost their title of Archbishop, and to this day neuer recouered the same. Howbeit they vsed all authoritie belonging to an Archbishop, by consecrating of other Bishops; &amp;c. Neither euer did they make profession of subiection vnto Canterbury vntill the time of Henry the 1. king of England, whereof we shall speake more hereafter. He died at Dola and was buried there.
               
                  After Sampson succeeded these:
                  26. Kucline.
                  
                  27. Rodherich, A Bishop of that name, dyed the yeare 961. as the Chronicle of Wales reporteth. If this bee the man he is misplaced.
                  28 Elguin.
                  
                  29 Lunuerd, or Lywarch.
                  
                  30 Nergu, or Vergw.
                  
                  31 Sulhidir, or Sulhidw. or Hubert died 942.
                  
                     32. Eneuris, or Euerus died, 944.
                  33. Morgeneu. This man (saith Giraldus) of all the Bishops of S. Dauids, presumed first to eate flesh which none of them had euer done before him. For punishment of which hainous offence, he supposeth it fell out that afterwards hee was murthered of Pirates; reporting withall, how that after his death hee appeared to a Bishop of Ireland, vsing thefe words; Quia carnes comedi, caro factus sum: For eating of flesh, I am now become nothing but flesh.
                  34 Nathan.

                  38 Eruyn, or Hernun, a godly and learned man, died ann. 1038.
                  39 Tramerin, or Carmerin, died 1055. hauing long gouerned the Dioces of Hereford vnder Ethelstan the Bishop who was blind 13. yeares before his death.

                  41 Bleithud. He died the yéere 1070.
                  42 Sulghein. Hee forsooke his Bishopricke, the yéere 1076.
                  43 Abraham. The yéere 1078 or thereabout, Saint Dauids was spoyled and destroyed by strangers, and Abraham the Bishop, what through griefe or sicknesse died. Whereupon Sulghein was constrained to resume his Bishopricke which notwithstanding he resigned againe about the yéere 1085. &amp; 1088. died being 80. yéeres of age, the godliest and wisest mā and the greatest Clerks in all Wales, so saith the Welch Chronicle of him.
                  44 After him a sonne of his called Rythmarch succéeded (as the Chronicle of Wales deliuereth) and died about the yéere 1100. the godliest, wisest, and greatest Clerke that had béene here in Wales many yéeres before sauing his Father (sayth the Chronicle) who had brought him vp, and a great number of learned Disciples.
                  
                     45 Wylfride. Hée died the yéere 1115. It séemeth the Welch Chronicle calleth him Griffri.
                  
                  46 Bernard, a Norman, Chaplaine vnto King Henry the first, and Chancellour to his Quéene, was consecrate by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Iuly 12. 1115. not chosen by the Clergie of Wales, (as hitherto had beene accustomed) but forced vpon them by the King of England; with whom this man being in great fauour, and presuming vpon the goodnesse of his cause, began to take on him the title of Archbishop, and had his Crosse sometimes in Wales carried before him. After long suite and much money spent betwéen him and the Archbishop of Canterbury, he had preuailed at the last (as Giraldus Cambr. séemeth perswaded) had not two suborned witnesses deposed a flat vntruth in the presence of the Pope. Giraldus afterward doubteth not confidently to pronounce that the power and wealth of the Archbishops of Canterbury hath ouerborn the poore Bishops of Saint Dauids in this matter without all right. This Bishop (sayeth Giraldus) was a man in some other respects prayse-worthy, but vnreasonable proud and ambitious, as most of the Englishmen were, that in those times were thrust into Welch Bishopricks. Againe, hée was a very euill husband vnto his Church, alienating diuers lands, and letting others for the tenth penny of that his predecessors made of them, so thinking to make a way by gratifying of Courtiers vnto some better Bishopricke in England. Hee was deceiued of his expectation: Hauing béene Bishop of Saint Dauids about the space of thirty thrée yéeres, hée died ann. 1148.
                  46 Dauid Fitz Gerald Archdeacon of Cardigan, Brother to Siluester Giraldus, that long a
                        •
                     ter succéeded him, died Bishop of Saint Dauids, 1176.
                  47 Peter or Piers, (so the Welch Chronicle calleth him) a Benedictine Monke, Prior of Wenlocke, was consecrate the same yéere. His Cathedrall Church dedicated vnto Saint Andrew and Saint Dauid, had béene often destroyed in former times by Danes and other Pirates, and in his time was almost quite ruinated: He bestowed much in reedifying

of the same, and may in some sort be said to haue built the Church which now standeth. How long he sate I finde not, Sept. 2. 1189. Hée was present at the Coronation of King Richard the first.
                  48 Geffry Prior of Lanthony, a Regular Canon, was preferred to this See by the meanes of Hubert Archbishop of Canterbury. He died the yéere 1198.

A very comely and personable man of body, and for his mind, witty, studious, vertuous, and well giuen; but a little too credulous, in beléeuing sucredible reports, and no lesse lauish in deliuering them. In his youth he trauelled ouer most part of Christendome. At Paris he read publikely in the English Colledge with great commendation. Returning home, hee grew into good estimation with King Henry the second, in whose seruice he spent ten yéeres, and in that space was imployed by him in many Ambassages. At last he bacame Secretary vnto Iohn the said Kings sonne; with whom hee went into Ireland, and being there, writ a description of the Country, as hee did also of England and Wales. In the Preface of his booke de Principis instructione, he complaines much of the Kings coldnesse, and manifold delayes in preferring him, as also of his vnhappinesse in being despised by the English for a Welchman, and not onely suspected, but hated by the Welch for an English man, as borne partly of English bloud, and now altogether Anglized by education and long continuance in England. Amongst other of his enuious aduersaries, one Wibertus a Cistercian Monke accused him of treason, of which hee well acquitted himselfe. His first preferments were the Archdeaconries of Brecknocke, and Saint Dauids. I fi

made challenge vnto the title of an Archbishop at Rome, as Bernard had done before him. How that controue

He liued till he was semewhat more then seuenty yéeres of age, and dying the yeare 1198. was buried in his owne Church. Of many bookes he writ, you may finde the Catalegue in Bale.

            THE BISHOPPES OF LANDAFF.
            
               THe Cathedrall Church of Landaff is reported to haue beene first built in the time of Lucius, aboute the yeare of Christ 180. But I perceiue not that any Bishop sate there before Dubritius, that by Germanus Bishop of Altisiodore, and Lupus of Trecasia (two Bishops of France) was first consecrate Archbishop of those parts, and sate sometimes at Carleon, sometimes at Landaff. Of the occasion of their double iourney into those parts (for they were twice here) and of Dubritius, whom former ages haue made a Saint, sée more in the beginning of Saint Dauids. So wée must account Saint Dubritius the first Bishop of Landaff; not that I deny any other to haue sate there before him, but because he is the first whose name is remembred: And it is probable he had no predecessors, because the memory of his successo
                  •
               s is so carefully preserued.
            
               2 Saint Teliau, alias Eliud, the second Bishop was borne of very noble parentage, at a place called Eccluis Gunnian, &amp; brought vp vnder Dubritius his predecessor, and Paulinus, together with Saint Dauid. There is a very ancient booke belonging to the church of Landaffe, commonly called Saint Telians booke, reporting the greatest part of that which I deliuer concerning this See. In it I finde a great discourse of a iourney he made to Ierusalem with S. Dauid and one Paternus, &amp; how he was there consecrate Bishop of Landaff. Soon after his cōming home, he was constrained by a strange disease raigning in those parts to flie into France, whence after seuen yeares, he returned againe, bringing home with him in thrée ships his Countrimen that had fled with him vpon the same occasion. Died at Llanteilio Uaur (as it séemeth.) To let passe a number of fabulous narrations concerning his miracles, I cannot omit one which I find mentioned in the Collect appointed for his holy day, how that after his death thrée places striuing for his body, Pennalum where his ance
                  •
               ters were buried, Lantolio Maur or Uaur where he died, and Landaffe his Sée
                  •
                after prayer to God, to appease this contention, in the place where they had left him there appeared sodainely thrée hearses with thrée bodies so like, as no man could discerne the right. So euery one taking one, they were all pleased: howbeit (saith the booke) by diuers miracles done at the place of his buriall at Landaffe, it appeareth that there the true body lyeth. In all our Records he is called Archbishop of Landaff.
            3 Oudoceus or Odoceus, succéeded Saint Telian. Hee was sonne vnto Budic King of little Brittaine, and Anaumed a sister of Saint Telian his predecessor. By the consent of the Kings and Comminalty of the whole Dioces he was elected and consecrate at Dorobomia. At his returne thence, Mou

                  c the king
                  •
                with his Quéene, sonnes and all the Nobility and Clergy of the Country, met him in procession, and bringing him into his Church, graunted vnto him these priuiledges to bée fine consule: also very nobly borne, &amp; after his death reputed a Saint as was his predecessor. He died the second of Iuly, the yéere I finde not.
            
               In the time of these 3. Bishops, the Church of Landaffe had many benefactors, whose liberalities I shall brieflie recite, but to so much the lesse purpose, because the names of the lands giuen, are in continuance of time changed in such sort, as now by these names for the most part wee can not discerne them. Thus much notwithstanding wee may perceiue, that if the Church at this time enioyed but the tenth part of that which hath first and last béene bestowed vpon it, it were one of the wealthiest Churches in Christendome (I suppose) whereas now it hath hardly sufficient to repayre it selfe; and the Bishopricke (who
                  •
               e landes till about the yeare were not seuered from those of the Cathedrall Church, the Bishoppe hauing the managing as well of the one as the other) it is now growne to that low ebbe, that diuers Benefices in the Diocesse yéelde more profit vnto their Incumbents, then that vnto the now Bishop.
            
               Tewdrick or Theodorike King of Morgannuc, aboute the year of our Lord 560. (as neere as I can ghesse) hauing resigned his Kingdome to Mowricke his sonne, and betaking himselfe to a solitary kind of life, as an Heremite: Upon occasion of an inuasion made by the Saxons vpon his Country, was taken out of his Cell, and forced to become the leader of an army against them. At Tintern neere the riuer of Wye, he met the enemy, and ioyning battell gaue him a great ouerthrow, but himselfe was mortally wounded; which when hee perceiued, hée hasted homeward, giuing direction vnto his sonne, that if hee died vpon the way, in the same place where he hapned to decease, a Church should be built, and his body buried in the same place. Within fiue miles of that place it was he departed, to wit, ouer against the fall of the riuer of Wye into Seuerne, where according to his desire before mentioned, was built the Church that of olde was called Merthir Tewdricke, as you you would say, the Martyrdome of Tewdricke, because he béeing slaine by Pagans, and in the defence of Christian Religion, was accounted a Martyr, and called (as to this day hee is) Saint Tewdricke. His

bones lie entoombed. Upon the North side of the saide Church. And his sonne not contented therewithall; gaue moreouer the lands and territory adiacent vnto the same to the Bishoppe, whose Successors in processe of time built a house there, to witte at Mertherne (or as now wee tearme it) Matherne, being the onely mansion house now left vnto him.

The Bishop of this Sée was then called Elguensis, Eluensis and Lanalwenses of the Riuer Elwy néere which it standeth, and this Kentigerne became the first Bishop of the same.

Bishoppe (Godfridus and Galfridus are often vsurped the one for the other) in vi obedientiae, to return home to his bishopricke, or else to resigne and forsake the same. For hee being compelled, paupertate &amp; infestatione Wallensium (saith he) to leaue the Countrey, found gratious and honourable intertainement at the hand of K.

In regard whereof, when the Archbishop pressed him to condiscend to the reasonable motion of his Cleargy, he was content to giue ouer his Bishopricke, in hope to retaine his Abbotship still. But therein hee was deceiued: for whether it were that the King intending the Abbey to another, directed his Cleargy at first to this course, so thinking to hound him thence, and driue him home to his Bishoprick, or else that he suffered him to hold the Abbotship onely vpon hope it should be an encouragement vnto him to do him faithfull seruice at his returne into Wales: No sooner had hée forgone the one by deliuering vp his King and Crosier to the Arch. but he presently thrust him out of the other also, by putting in a new Abbot.

Rossus and Bostonus Buriensis: But sure it was not the Popes fashion in those daies to fetch his Cardinels so far off, or to prefer vnto those places any but such as had spent much time in or néere to the Court of Rome. And if this report should be true, much I should maruell, that none of the writers of those times should mention the same. Euen so true vndoubtedly it was, as that one Robert was sometimes king of this realme, and that the same Galfridus was the Dominus fac-totum vnder him.

                  It séemeth then that one Reynerus succéeded. For in the yeare 1188. at which time Baldwyn Archbishop of Canterbury visited all Wales. Hee was Bishop (as Giraldus testifieth) who also reporteth of him, that before the comming of the said Archbishop, he perswaded many of his Diocesse to take on them the Crosse, to fight against the Saracens. This Bishop had a house at or néere vnto Oswestry (of olde called Oswaldcestre) where he much resided. Hee bestowed all the tithe hay and corne of Blanch Monastery and the Chappells thereunto belonging (wherewith were wont to bee maintained 12. secular Priests, that for the most part had their lawfull wiues) vpon the Monks of Shrewsbury, &amp; by the Popes authority expelled the said seculars. Hee gaue also halfe the tythes of Wrexham to the Abbey of Llangwest, commonly called Valle crucis, which in an. 1100. was founded by Mad
                        •
                     g ap Gryssith L of Brumfield. Hee liued till the yeare 1220. but how much longer I find not.
               
                  The yeare 1232. one Abraham died Bishop of this Church.
                     Abraham.
                   Hee confirmed the graunt of his predecessor vppon halfe the tythes of Wrexam, and moreouer bestowed vpon the saide Abbey of Valle Crucis, the other halfe also, anno 1227.
               The yeare 1235. Howel de Edneuet a Fryer,
                     Howell ap Edneuet.
                   became Bishoppe of Saint Assaph. In the yeare 1239. hee gaue to the Nunnes of Llanligan in Powys land; the tythe of the Rectory of Llanuayre in Caerenion, hee impropried also Langollen vnto the Abbey of Valley Crucis anno 1236. and the Rectory of Lanasaph, vnto the fabrike of the Cathedrall Church. Anno 1247. hee died at Oxford, and was there buried.
               
                  Anyanus was consecrate 1248.
                     Anianus 
                     
                        •
                     
                   Hee ended a great controuersie betweene Richard Bishop of Bangor, and Lleolin ap Gryffiyth Prince of Wales, The agréement beareth date at Rhydyrarw, anno 1261. Hee impropriated to the Nuns of Lanlligan the Rectory of Llanllwghayarn, ann. 1263. and anno 1265. the Rectory of Aberrew to the Abbey of Pole. He sate 17. or 18. yeares.
               After him the Sée was voide two yeares.
                     Anianus 2. Then succéeded an other of the same name, Anan de Sehonaw a Dominican Frier called commonly y braud du o Nanny. Anian the blacke Frier of Naney, who was consecrate in the church of Saint Mary Oueries, in October 1268. and attended K. Edward the first in his voyage out of the holy land, as Bale supposeth, and was his Confessor. To him and his Successors, Iohn Fitzallen Earle of Arundel, gaue certaine lande at S. Martins to the value of 100. acres &amp; somwhat more, paying therefore yeerely for euer one payre of guilt spurs at midsommer, with condition it should not bee lawfull for the Bishop or his successors to alienate the same, that graunt bare date apud Album Monasterium in crastino Paschae 1271. &amp; was afterward confirmed by Richard the sonne of the saide Iohn Fitzallen, who also gaue 44. acres of land more, together with the scite of the mannor and a house to the same belonging.

Betwéene this Bishop and the Abbot of Salop there was much contention, and a long suite at Rome about the placing of a Uicar in Blanch-Monastery (the tithe wherof his predecessor had giuen to the said Abbot.) The issue therof was, that the Abbot, for the quiet enioying of his tithes, was faine to passe all his lands in S. Martins vnto the Bishop. The like controuersie fell out betwéene him and the Abbey of Valle Crucis concerning the Uicarages of Llangollen, Wrexham, Ruabon, Chirke, Llansanffcayd and Landegla, the patronage of all which Churches by sentence of the Officiall of Canterbury, and the Abbot of Tallelechew the Popes Delegates, was adiudged vnto the Bishop and his Successors. He gaue two third parts of the title of Brineglwis to Valle Crucis: In regard whereof Llandegla was wholly restored to his patronage, in a suit against Thomas Cantilupe Bishop of Hereford, concerning the iurisdiction of the Territory of Horddor, hee had not so good successe as in the former. The said Thomas dying, Richard de Swinfield his next successor was content to compromit this matter to the arbitrement of Richard Bishop of London, who awarded the iurisdiction to Hereford, and the Bishops of Hereford to this day do hold the same. To this Bishop and his Successors for euer, Gruffith Vaughan ap Gruffith ap Madoc Lord of Yale, gaue the Lordship and Mannour of Llandegla. anno 1278. Hee the saide Anian was once minded to translate his Episcopall Sée from Lanelwy to Ruthlan (which is two miles off) in regard that Lanelwy was but a Countery village, where the Canons could not dwell in any safety, by reason of the continuall warres. King Edward the first promised ground to build a Church vpon there, and a thousand Markes toward the charges of building. And letters were written to Pope Martyn the fourth the yeare 1485. to craue his licence for this translation. What should be the impediment and let of procéeding according to this proiect, I cannot ghesse, except happily the Popes death, who deceased 1286. As for the Bishoppe he died the yeare of our Lorde 1292.

                   otherwise called Llewelin de Bromfeild, a Canon of Saint Assaph succéeded him, and was consecrate in Summer 1293. anno 1310. he gaue foure parts of the tythe of Lanelwy to the 4. Uicars Chorall, for seruing of the Cure infra 4. cruces, which so remaineth He impropried the rectories of Lansilin and Ruthlan to the Chapter, or rather confirmed and renued the impropriation thereof made by his predecessor Anian, for that the writings containing the grant thereof néere lost in time of the warres, as were also they that concerned Lanassaph, made for the fabrike of the Church, which hee likewise renued; in lieu thereof, making the portion of Corwen (which before was belonging to the fabrike) presentatiue. He made ordinances for singing, and other seruice of the Church, that yet stand in force. Hauing obtained licence of King Edward the 1. by his grant bearing date, October 12. an. regni sui, 22. to make his will, hee bequeathed much plate, bookes and ornaments to his Church, to the Canons, and to his Chaplaines, affoording also good Legacies to his seruants and other friends. Soone after which he died, to wit, the yeare 1313.
               
                  Dauid ap Blethin had the Kings royall assent vnto his election,

                   the yeare 1314. yet it seemes hee was not consecrate till the yeare 1319. and that hee died about Michaelmasse, Edward 3.19. For I finde that October 9. the yeare the King writ his letter to the Deane and Chapter of Saint Assaph, earnestly requiring them to elect for their Bishoppe, one Iohn of Lincolne a Frier Preacher, and Confessor to the Earle of Warrien.
               I finde reported in the Chronicle of Wales,
                     Ephraimi
                   that one Ephraim should die Bishoppe of Lanelwy the yeare 1332. If any such were about this time, it must needes bee somewhat later, I ghesse it might be mistaken for 1352.
               It appeareth then by a Record in the Tower,
                     Henry.
                   the first yeare of Richard the second, that one Henry was Bishop of Saint Assaph in the time of Edward the third, and it

séemeth hee should bee next predecessor to Iohn Treuor that followeth.
               
                  
                     Io. Treuor.
                  The said Ephraim and Henry (if there places bee not mistaken) sate so short a time, as they were not thought worthy the mentioning. For I finde in the Register of Simon Islip Archbishop of Canterbury, the examination of a witnesse taken in April 1357. where it is affirmed by one that tooke vpon him to know all the Bishops of Saint Assaph for a long time, how that Eynion Bishoppe of Saint Assaph died about thréescore yeeres then past, that Llewelin succeeded him, then Dauid, Iohn Treuaur, by whose death (sayeth hee) the Bishopricke aforesaid is now void. And true it is, that the yeare 1356, he died.

                  William de Spridlington Deane of Saint Assaph; was consecrate May 25. 1376. Before the time of this Bishop, the tenants of the Lordshippe of Lanelwy were to finde sixe labourers euery working day in the yeare to work in the quarry, called y Garreg goch (the red rocke) or such other works as they should bee appointed to, especially for the Cathedrall Church, and for euery default to pay foure pence to the vse of the said Church. But now vpon pretence that the Tenants were become sewer and poorer then they had beene, and that the sayd seruice and worke was not so needefull as in times past: This Bishoppe consented that in lieu of all that seruice, onely ten markes yeerely should bee accepted. This rent to this day is called ardreth y garreg goch, the rent of the redde rocke. But by what means I know not, it is now fallen from 10. marks to 10. Nobles. He died at Altmeledin in the ninth of Aprill, 1382.

Soone after his returne, to wit, the yeare 1404. he reuolted from the said kings obedience, and betooke him vnto the party of Owen Glendowr. Stow saith, this man was Bishop of S. Dauids, which cannot be. For certaine it is, ihat Guido de Mona was then Bishoppe of Saint Dauids. And these things that I haue set downe concerniug him, are deliuered of him by the name of Iohn Treuor Bishop of S. Assaph, in Th. Walsingham and others. The yeare 1406. it séemes he died.

                  NOt to say any thing of the manifold Testimonies of very credible authors who witnesse, that the Faith of Christ was receiued in diuers particular places of this Island presently after the asce
                     •
                  ision of Christ, or at least while the Apostles yet liued; it cannot he denied, but Elentherius Bishop of Rome at the request of Luciu then K. of Britaine, sent Damianus, Faganus and other learned Preachers to sow the seede of the Gospell here, about the yeare of our Lord 180 And it should seeme (which our histories also witnesse,) that God so farre foorth blessed their labours, that they not onely conuerted many to the faith of Christ themselues, but also left a posterity of other, which with like painefulnesse continued the same doctrin in this Island, till by diuers tyrants, they were in diuers places oppressed and consumed. Notwithstanding whether it were that the Church by them planted had many notable wanes and intermissions, or rather eclipses, in which

the light of heauenly doctrine was altogether darkened by great persecution, and so no Ecclesiasticall history preserued; or whether the same being preserued, was destroied by persecutors, scarcely any mention remaineth of any of their Bishops. Onely of London, there are remembred 15. Archbishops, and of Yorke 4. The first of these, and the first Archbishop that euer Yorke had, our histories say was one named Sampson, appointed by the foresaid king Lucius, the verity whereof I cannot but suspect in regard of the name. For I finde not that the names of the old Hebrewes or Christian Saints were yet in vse It is then also reported that Constantius Chlorus the Emperour appointed Taurinus Bishop of Eureux to be Archbishop there, as also that King Arthur made choice of one Pyrannus; and lastly that Tadiacus was the last Archbishop before the comming of the Saxons. Whē they had gotten possession of this Realme, the Britons (that were the old inhabitants) being drouen into a corner thereof (Wales and Cornewal) the rest of England was without any knowledge or inkling of the Gospell, vntill the comming of Saint Augustine. And after him a great while the North parts of this realme remained in the darknesse of their wonted ignorance, till God looking vpon them with the eye of his mercy, gaue this occasion of their conuersion. Edwyn King of Northumberland, was very desirous to marry Edilburge ye sister of Eabald king of Kent. She being not onely a Christian, but a very vertuous Lady; vtterly refused to match with him so long as he was a Pagan, but signified, that vpon condition hee would promise to become a Christian, shee would accept him for her husband. He answered, he could be very well content to do nothing in preiudice of her faith; and to suffer that not onely herselfe, but her seruants and traine should practise what religion they would: And professed with all that it vpon consideration and conference with wise men, Christian religion shold seem more holy and worthier of God then his owne, he would not refuse to embrace the same. Upon these conditions Edilburge was sent vnto him to be his Quéene. And least by keeping company with the Heathen people, she and those that went with her might in time be defiled with their Paganisme; it was thought conuenient to

send some learned and Godly man with her, that might not only instruct and admonish them daily, but also minister the Sacraments vnto them, yea, and preach the Gospell vnto Infidels. Paulinus a reuerend man was made choice of, whō they thought good to consecrate Archbishop of Yorke, which was done by Iustus Archbishop of Canterbury the 21. day of Iuly, in the yeare of our Lord 625. or as some account, 622. He mindful of his vocation, as soone as he came into the coū
                  try, laboured diligently to winne soules vnto Christ, but without any profit at all a great while:

                     Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis.
                  
               
               So long as the King remained obstinate, little good was to be done with the rest of the people. Him therfore he often exhorted to embrace Christ; and preuailed at last so farre with him, as hee promised to doe it, if it might please God to send him victory against Guichelm King of the West-Saxons, that had conspired his death. This victory beeing obtained according to his desire; He yet kept not promise, but delayed the matter, vnder pretence of perswading his Nobles first to bee content therewith; And longer still hee would haue delayed it, had not God by Paulinus put him in minde of a vision, hee had seene long since (as Beda reporteth) and it is this. Elfridus that raigned ouer the Northumbers next before him, sought nothing more then the death of this Edwin, to whom indeede the Crowne of right appertained. Hée therefore slying from his enemy, ranged vp and downe in many Countries, and that in the most secret manner hee might, till at last hee came vnto Redwald King of the East Angles, humbly beseeching him that hee would saue his life by sheelding him from Edilfrid his cruell enemy. The king bid him welcom, and promised to fulfill his request. Nothwithstanding which his promise, being offered a great summe of money by Edilfrid to betray him, and threatened with warre, if hee condescended not vnto him; he yeelded at last, and determined to gratists him therein, thogh contrary to his word and faith giuen. This resolution of the Kings being vnderstood by a companion of Edwins, he called him out of his bed late in the night, told him how the world went, and bid him shift for himselfe; whereunto hee

answered couragiously, that for his part hee would not first breake with the king; if the king estéemed so little of his honour as to sell it for money, better it was for him to dye by the appoitment of him that hee knew loued him (though hee loued money better) then by the appointment of his deadly enemy, whom by flying he well saw he could no longer auoid. Héereupon his companion departed from him, leauing him very pens

                  ue, sitting without doore vpon a stone. Soone after hée was gone, Edwyn espied one comming toward him that he knew not, who demanding of him why he sate there at that time of the night, other men being asléepe? What is that vnto you saith Edwyn whether I spend the night within doore or without? Héereunto the other answered, thinke not my friend that I am ignorant of thy sadnesse, &amp; the cause of thy present griefe, I know them very well: But tell me (quoth hee) what reward wouldest thou giue vnto him that should ridde thee of all this care and trouble, and perswade Redwald neither to hurt thee himselfe, nor to suffer other to doe it. When he promised to do any thing in the world that lay in his power to performe, the other added; what if hee should also promise thée the kingdome due vnto thée, and the ouerthrow of thine enemies that séeke thy life; yea and moreouer that thou shalt be the mightiest king, not onely of all thy progenitors, but of all the Saxons that euer were in this Isle? Hereunto he answered in effect as before, hée would doe his best to requite so great a benefit. Why then (quoth the other, and withall laid his hand vpon Edwyns head) when all these things shall come to passe, and that thou shalt be shewed a more excellent way to direct the course and maner of thy life, then euer was imparted vnto any of thy predecessors; Remember by this token (of laying my hand on thy head) to follow without delay the directions that shall bee giuen thee. This hauing saide, hée vanished away to the great woonder and astonishment of Edwyn, who had not sate there long; but his companion before mentioned, came running foorth vnto him with great ioy, and told him that Redwald by the perswasion of the Quéene had altered his determination, and was resolued (whatsoeuer came of it) to stand to his word, and to be true vnto him. To make short, God so mooued his

heart that he was not only content to defend Edwyn as heretofore; but also gathered suddenly a great army, and going in person against Edilfrid, he ouercame and slue him in the field: whereby it came to passe, that Edwyn with one consent of all his subiects was made king. Now this vision (saith Beda) God reuealed vnto Paulinus the Archbishop, who comming vnto Edwyn the king, at a time when he chanced to sit alone, deliberating with himselfe what religion it were best to follow; hee stept vnto him, and laying his right hand vpon his head, asked him if he knew that token? Presently the King forgetting all Prīncely maiesty, fell downe trembling at poore Paulinus feet, and said he knew it very well, in so much as, héereafter hee would follow his direction (for matters of Religion) in all things. The King beeing thus wonne vnto Christ, and hauing receiued his badge and cognisance by Baptisme; the rest of the nobility first, and then the commonalty gaue diligent eare vnto the Bishops preaching, and were conuerted daily in great numbers. It is said that for 36. daies together Paulinus the Archbishop neuer rested one moment, but either instructed the people by preaching that flocked continually about him; or else imparted Christ vnto them in Baptisme, which he ministred in the open fields and riuers, Churches being not yet built. King Edwin against the time of his owne Baptisme, had caused a little Church to bee erected of boords and timber in the City of Yorke, &amp; dedicated the same to S. Peter. Afterward hee laid the foundation of a very stately building round about the wooden Church, which (he being taken away by vntimely death) his successor Oswald finished. Sedwall king of Wales, and Penda of Mercia or Mid England came against this good king, and (God in his secret iudgement permitting the same) ouerthrew him in the field and slue him. The Country by reason héere of being full of trouble, Paulinus (that saw he might not with safety abide any longer there) sixe yeares after his comming thither, returned by water into Kent againe, and there was intreated to take on him the gouernment of the Sée of Rochester then void. Hee sate there 13. yeares, and October 10. 644. was called away to receiue the glorious reward of his blessed labours, 19. yeares, two moneths and 21. daies after his first

consecration: He ws a man of a tall stature (as Beda) describeth him) a little stooping, blacke-haired, leane-faced, his nose thinne and hooked, of a countenance both terrible and very reuerend. Hee was buried after his death in his Cathedrall Church of Rochester.
            
            
               2. Cedda.
               AFter the departure of Paulinus,
                  666 the Church of Yorke was twenty (some say thirty) yeares without a Pastor by reason of the continuall warres and other troubles that happened by the persecution of Pagans. Aidanus, Finnanus Colmanus and Tuda, succéeding one another in the Bishopricke of Lindisfarne, gouerned all Northumberland as well as they could during the time of this troublesome vacancy. At last Egfrid king of Northumberland appointed one Wilfride vnto the Sée of Yorke, sending him to Agelbert Bishop of Paris (sometime of Winchester) to receiue consecration of him; where Wilfrid staying very long, and not giuing any hope of spéedy returne, the same king enforced Cedda (a very holy man) without all right vnto the same to thrust himselfe into the place due to Wilfrid. Hauing carefully attended that charge not pertaining to him the space of three years, he was admonished by Theodorus Archbishop of Canterbury that he was not rightly and lawfully called to that Sée, whereupon he presently forsooke it, and was made by meanes of the same Theodorus Bishop of Lichfield.
            
            
               3. Wilfridus.
               THis Wilfrid was borne in the North Countrey of meane parentage.666 The time of his Childhood hee lost in his Fathers house, being vntaught vntill hee was fourteene yeares of age; at what time not sustaining the frowardnes of his stepmother, hee went abroad to seeke his fortune as they say. And first, he light vpon certaine Courtiers that had beene beholding vnto his Father for diuers curtesies. By them he was presented vnto the Quéene, as a child for wit and beauty not vnfit to do her seruice; Shee by questioning sound the

inclination of the boye, that hee was desirous to become a Scholler. Therefore shee sent him to one Cedda, that of a Councellor and Chamberlaine to the King, had become a Monke at Lindisfarne, whether it might not bee the man before mentioned, I discerne not. By him he was diligently instructed, and being very sharpe-witted, profited wonderfully vnder him. At that time there was a great contention in the Church about the obseruation of Easter; whereof this youth being desirous to bee fully informed, determined to goe to Rome, and study there a while. By meanes of Eanfled the Q. aforesaid, and Ercombert K. of kent, he was furnished for this voyage &amp; sent along with one or two other. In the way he fell acquainted with Wulsinus Archbishop of Lyons, who made very much of him, &amp; stayed him with him a time, to the great increase of his knowledge. Continuing then no long time at Rome, in his returne homeward, hee was ordered by the Archbishop of Lyons aforesaid, who also adopted him to be his sonne. Hee meant not to haue returned into his owne Countrey, but that this Archbishop was taken from him being murthered by Brunechildus the Quéene that had cruelly slaine 9. other Bishops before. Presently vpon his returne home, king Egfrid gaue him a house and maintenance, and many noblemen admiring much his learning and eloquence, bestowed diuers things vpon him; at last with great applause &amp; liking of al men, he was chosen Bishop, &amp; sent into France, where he was consecrate by 12. other Bishops: for he refused to take consecration at the hands of the Scottish bishops, that were counted schismatiques in not agréeing with the church of Rome concerning the time and obseruation of Easter. Beyond the seas he stayed somwhat longer then hee néeded, being delighted with the company of many learned men of that country: and when he would haue returned, by tempest of weather he was driuen into farre countries, where he wandred a long time. Coming home, and finding another man in his place, hee liued a while a priuate life. In which mean space he was often inuited by Wulfher king of Merceland vnto the Bishopricke of Lichfield. In the ende Cedda being remooued (as before is said) he setled himselfe at Yorke, and posted Cedda to Lichfield. Then, the first thing hee went

about was to finish his Cathedrall Church left vnperfect by Paulinus, and since his departure very much decaied (for the roofe was fallen, and the walles in many places ruinous) this his Church I say hee repaired, and finished, mending the walles, couering it with lead, glasing the windowes, and moreouer beautified the same with many goodly ornaments. He was so greatly beloued of al sorts of people for his gentlenes, affability &amp; liberality, as many men liuing, but more at their death (especially Cleargy men) would put their goods &amp; children into his hands; the one assuring themselues of a faithfull keeper, the other of a discréete and conscionable dispender. Hereby it came to passe that in short time hee became exceeding rich, hauing many seruitors to attend vpon him, and great store of plate, and other houshould-
                     •
                  tuffe very sumptuous. The report whereof comming to the eares of Theodore Archbishop of Canterbury: it put him in minde of the greatnesse of that Dioces and the ability of the Country to maintaine more Bishops. Wherefore hee went about to appoynt two or thrée other Bishops vnder him. Which when Wilfride obstinately refused, and the other ceased not to vrge very earnestly; he appealed vnto the Pope, and went vnto him in person. Some report (I thinke vntruly) that he went about to perswade the Quéene to forsake her husband, and betake her selfe to a monastery; and that the king being greatly displeased héerwith, first sought to diminish his authority by making more Bihops, and afterwards made diuers complaints vnto the Pope against him, séeking to haue him depriued. Whosoeuer caused it, certaine it is, that to the Pope he trauelled. In passing of the Sea, hee was driuen by a contrary winde into Frizia, and staied there all winter preaching the Gospell (neuer heard of in that country before) vnto the king and people, whom before his departure hee conuerted vnto Christ. The Pope was then at the Councell of Constance; where, both by him and his Councell it was ordered, that the state of the Bishopricke of Yorke should not be altered without Wilfrids owne consent. But Egfride the king so fauored Theodores deuise, as Wilfride at his returne perceiued wel, he must either yéeld vnto it or forsake the country Heerin methinks he was to blame: Not induring to take a repulse in a

matter he had trauelled so much in; He rather chose to leaue Bishopricke, country and all, and to liue in pouerty and exile. He went into Sussex, and there indeuouring to conuert the people of that country vnto the faith of Christ, became their first Bishop, and laid the foundations of a Cathedrall church, the Sée being afterward remooued to Chicester. Sée more heereof in Chicester. After ten yéeres banishment, K. Edfrid dying, Alfrid that succéeded him sent for Wilfride and desired him to returne to this Sée of Yorke: which hee did. But after fiue yéeres, the king fell out with him, and forced him to Rome againe. There purging himselfe of all the accusations laid against him by the king, he obtained the Popes letters in fauour of him; by meanes wherof, and intercession of many friends, with much ado, at last he was restored once more vnto his first charge; in which after this his last restitution, hee liued peaceably the space of fower yéeres, and died then, being seuenty sixe yéeres of age, October the twelfth the yéere 711. forty fiue yeeres after his first consecration. Hee was buried in the monastery of Rippon which himselfe built: The Church there being fallen downe for want of reparation, Odo Archbishop of Cant. remooued his bones to Cant. about the yéere 940. Many other things are at large reported of him by Beda, lib. 5. cap. 20 Amongst the rest his Epitaph there set downe I thought good to insert.

               4. Bosa.
               AFter the first departure of Wilfrid from Yorke, Theodore proceediug in his intended platforme, diuided his Dioces into 4. placing one Eata at Hagustald whom afterward he remooued to Lindisfarne (another of his new erections) appointing Tumbert to succéede him, in the Prouince of the Picts Trumwyn, and lastly in the ancient Sée of York Bosa. At the returne of Wilfrid, Bosa was faine to giue place as also Iohn that had succéeded Eata (dead in the mean time.) Wilfrid being expelled the second time, they were both restored.) Before then the second restitution of Wilfrid, Bosa died, and Iohn succéeded him. This Iohn, Wilfrid would not displace but contented himselfe in his latter time with the gouernment of Hagustald. Bosa hath the report of a very meeke and deuout man. He liued ten yeeres after his consecration, and dying, was the first Archbishop that was buried in York
            
            
               5 Iohn.
               THis Iohn (called afterward Saint Iohn of Beuerley,687) was a gentleman born of a very good house, and brought vp first vnder Hilda that famous Abbesse, then vnder Theodore the fifth Archbishop of Canterbury, who also preferred him to the Bishopricke of Hagustald; and was sometimes a student in the vniuersity of Oxford. He alwaies had a reputation of a wonderfull holy man, and Beda reporteth many miracles to bee done by him, lib. 5. cap. 2.3.4.5. and 6. as the curing of diuers folkes desperately sicke, by prayer; opening the mouth of a dumb man, &amp;c. which things either they were true. or Beda was much to blame: For hee not onely liued

in his time and Dioces. But knew him and receiued the order of priesthood at his hand. Waxing very old, and hauing béene a Bishop now 33. yéeres, 8. monethes and 13. dayes, with the consent of his Cleargy, hee resigned and procured another Wilfred his Chaplaine to be consecrate in his roome. After which he liued priuately at Beuerley, in the Colledge there built and founded by himselfe for Priests, &amp; dying the seuenth day of May, the yéere 721. was buried in the Porch of the Church belonging to that Colledge. In a Conuocation held at London the yéere 1416. the foresayd day of his death was appointed to be kept holy day yéerly in memorial of him. Amongst many priuiledges granted by diuers kings vnto the Colledge of Beuerley for his sake, it is remembred that king Athelstan made it a Sanctuary, and placed a certaine chayre of stone in the Church there, vpon which hee caused this inscription to be engrauen, Haec sedes lapidea dicitur Freedstooli. pacis Cathedra ad quam reus fugiendo perueniens, omni modā habet securitatem. This chaire of stone is called Fréedstoole, that is the stoole of fréedome, vnto which who so commeth, hath all manner of security.

This man by his owne wisedome and the authority of his brother, amended greatly the state of his Church and See; Hee procured the Archiepiscopall pall to bee restored to his Church againe, and erected a famous library in Yorke, (burnt downe to the ground in the time of K. Stephen) which he furnisht plentifully with an infinit number of excellent books. This Library is honorably mētioned by Flaccus Albinus or Alcuinus (somtime kéeper of the same, but then schoolemaster vnto Charles
                  
the great) in an Epistle to the Church of England in these words. Date mihi eruditionis libellos quales in patria mea Anglia per industriam magistri mei Egberti habui, &amp; remittam vobis aliquos ex pueris nostris vt excipiant inde necessaria &amp; reuchant in Franciam flores Britanniae, &amp; non sit tantum in Eboraco hortus conclusus, sed etiam in Turone emissiones Paradisi, &amp;c. Neither was this man only a fauourer of learning in others, but himselfe also was very learned, and writ many things, a Catalogue whereof you may see in Bale. He was buried at Yorke by his brother the king in the church Porch.

Hee deceased about the yeare of our Lord 900. or as Matthew Westminster hath it (whose computation I finde very vncertaine) 895. In his time the Danes made such hauocke in the North countrey, as a great while after the Archbishopricke was little worth, and was faine often times to be mended with the Commendam of Worceter.

For this treason deseruing a thousand deaths) he was onely committed to prison the yeare 952. and a yeare after enlarged againe. This is the report of William Malmesbury, Matthew Westminster saith, he was punished in this sort for killing diuers Citizens of Thetford in reuenge of the death of one Adelm an Abbot, whom they had slaine and murthered without cause: two yeares after his enlargement, he died vpon S.

He built there the church dedicated to the blessed Uirgin Mary, hard by the Church of Saint Peter, and placed monkes in the same; to the end that the priests of Saint Peters Church being continually disgraced by the people (that very much reuerenced the monkes) might become a weary of their places.

This man was the first founder of the Abbey of Ramsey in the Isle of Ely, &amp; a very liberall benefactor vnto the Abbey of Floriake where hee was brought vp; A great patrone of Monkes, and a terrible persecutor of married Priests, wherof there were many in those daies. He died at Worceter sodenly, hauing washed the feete of certaine poore men, (as daily hée accustomed) After which kneeling downe to pray, without any sicknesse precedent, hee gaue vp the Ghost. William Malm-bury (who reporteth this) addeth, that the day before his death, hee tolde diuers of his friends that he should die. He was very learned, &amp; left some testimonies thereof in writing, not yet perished: for the integrity also of his life &amp; conuersation, he was much reuerenced. The greatest fault I find in him is, that he was very earnest in setting forth that doctrine of Diuels that debarreth men of lawfull marriage. The time of his departure was February 27. an. 992. 32. yéeres after his first consecration, when he had enioyed Yorke twenty two yeares. He was buried at Worceter in the church himselfe had built. Many miracles are reported to haue béene done at his tombe, in regard whereof the posterity would néedes make him a Saint, and his next Successor bestowed a costly shrine vpon him.

This they say was done by Alfricus the Archbishops counsell. He bestowed much money vpon the Colledge of Beuerley, first in a new and sumptuous shrine for the body of S. Iohn his predecessor, &amp; then in purchasing lands to increase the reuenues thereof, viz. some at Milton, other at Holme, and againe at Frideiffhorp.

Edward me thinks should haue béene more precise. Hauing preuailed thus farre, he went to Rome for his pall, together with the Earle Tosti Brother to the Quéene, Giso after Bishop of Welles, and Walter of Hereford.

of his Prouince to an vniforme and séemely kind of habite. It is also recorded of him that hee was King Edwards Ambassadour in Germany for a whole yeere: and that the yere 1058. he made a voyage vnto Ierusalem, through Hungary, a thing that no Archbishop of this Realme (as Houeden noteth) did euer attempt before him: Not many yeeres after his returne King Edward the Confessor died,

William the Conquerour also refusing to receiue the Crowne at Stigands hands (whom hee called the vsurper of Canterbury) desired him to performe that solemnity, which hée did, requiring first an oath of him to defend the Church, minister iustice (and amongst other things) to vse Englishmen as fauourably as Normans. This oath it séemed vnto Aldred the king had broken, and therefore (like a couragious Prelate) hee stucke not to thunder out an excommunication against him, saying, that now worthily he had cursed, whom once vnworthily he had blessed. This bold prank being reported vnto the King, incensed him very much at first; but thinking better of it, he determined to giue faire words a while, and so sent some to entreat for his absolution. These messēgers came too late; for the Bishop being troubled much in mind after the performance of that action, and either amased with feare of what might happen after it, or ouercome with griefe and repentance of that he had done; neuer could be merry after, add so by conceit was cast into a di

No English man succeeded him in many yéeres after; And the Normans being odious vnto the people they gladly reprehended all their actions, &amp; comparing them with such English Bishops as they could remember, made most fauorable report of them. One thing also encreased his credite much: Vrsus Earle of Worceter had built a Castle

there to some preiudice of the monks, insomuch as the ditch of the said Castle empaired a little of the Church-yard. Aldred went vnto the Earle (hauing before admonished him to right the wrong) and hauing demanded of him whether it were done by his appointment (which he could not deny) looking stedfastly vpon him, hee vsed these wordes; Hightest thou Vrse? Haue thou Gods curse and mine, &amp; of all hallowed heades, except thou takest away this Castle; and know thou assuredly, that thy posterity shall not inherite the land and inheritance of Saint Mary. This his curse séemed to take effect; for Vrsus died soone after, and Roger his sonne a very small time enioying his fathers honour, lost the same and was faine to flie the realme for killing an officer of the Kings. Thus much for Aldred, who after his death was buried in his owne Church.

Hee was a man very learned, gentle both in countenance and words, of a very swéete and amiable behauiour, chaste and of a goodly personage, beeing in his youth beautifull, in his latter time well coloured, and his hayre, both head and beard as white as snow. At his first entrance he had somewhat to doe with Lanfranke Archbishop of Canterbury, vnto whom he would not make profession of obedience neuer (as he alleaged) before that time required. And indéed before the cōming of Wil. the Conquerour (saith one) the two Metropolitanes

of England, were not onely in authority, dignity and office, but also in number of suffragan Bishops equall. But at this time (saith he) they of Canterbury perswaded the new king, that Yorke ought to bee subiect vnto their Sée, and that it was for the good and safety of the King, that the church thereof should bee obedient principally vnto one, for that otherwise one might set the crowne vppon one mans head, and the other doe as much for some body else.

His Cannons dispersed abroad, he called home againe, and tooke order they should bee reasonably prouided for. Hée built them a hall &amp; a dorter, and appointed one of them to be the Prouost, and gouernour of the rest.

Hen: 1.2. and Chancellour of England (vnder William the Conquerour, and Rufus his sonne) hauing beene Bishop of Hereford no long time, hee was elected vnto Yorke, but obtained not confirmation a great while. For he refused to make profession of obedience vnto Canterbury, till being commanded by the Popes letters, hee performed the same. Hee sate Archbishop seuen yeeres, and almost sixe monethes, and May 21 died suddenly in his

garden at Southwell, at a time when no body was with him. Hee was a good benefactor vnto the Church of Yorke: for hee was a meanes vnto the King, the bestow the Church of Laxton vpon the Chapter, and himselfe hauing obtayned of him the Churches of Dryfield, Kilne, Pockington, Pickering, and Burgh, hee gaue them all likewise to the Chapter. This notwithstanding, after his death they would not suffer him (dying so suddenly) to bee buried within their Church (hardly in the Church-yard.) So he was laid at the entrance of the Church porch. But Thomas his Successor not induring that such an indignity should be offered vnto an Archbishop, remooued his bones into the Church afterward, and caused them to be honourably in toombed. He was a man of great learning, and for eloquence admirable, but somewhat too eager against maried Priests, whom by no meanes he could abide. Bale chargeth him with sorcery and coniuration, because forsooth, that after his death, there was found in his Chamber a Uolume of Firmicus, who writ of Astrologie indeed, but of coniuration nothing that euer I heard.

                  A Second Thomas succeeded, a Chaplaine of the Kings, nephew vnto the former Thomas, Sonne vnto Sampson Bishop of Worceter, and brother to Richard Bishop of Bayon. Hee was a very fat man of body, and yoong of yeeres, yet of so good parts and sufficiency, as being Prouost of Beuerley, hee was elected vnto the See of London, voide by the death of Mauritius, which election hee had scarce accepted, and approoued of, when he was called to Yorke. Euen as his Predecessor, hee was very loath to make his profession vnto Canterbury. Being required thereunto by Anselme the Archbishop: Hee made many excuses. Wherefore Anselme lying very sicke, and perceiuing his end to bee neere, writ vnto all the Bishops of England, commaunding them
                     •
                   not to consecrate him before hee had made his profession, laying a terrible curse and excommunication, vpon whomsoeuer should 
                     •
                  oe it. The King after Anselmes death commanded

the Bishop of Worceter (whose sonne the Elect was) to consecrate him: But the Bishop his father answered, that hée would not haue the curse of Father Anselme for any worldly good. So in the end being perswaded to yéeld, as other had done before him, consecration was affoorded vnto him, and performed by his Father Sampson the foresaid Bishop of Worceter (as some report by the Bishop of London) the 27 of Iune, 1108. This man erected two new Prebends in his Church of Yorke, hée placed Cannons regular at Hagulstad: hée gaue diuers parcels of land vnto the Colledge of Southwell, and purchased of the King the like liberties and priuiledges for them, that the Prebends of Yorke, Beuerley, and Rippon had. He sate little aboue fiue yéeres, and died (after a sort) a Martyr. Lying dangerously sicke, he was aduertised by the Physitians, the nature of his disease to be such, as if he vsed the company of a woman, he neede not doubt of his recouery: otherwise nothing was to be looked for but death. He chose rather to die, then to pollute so high and sacred a calling with so foule and hainous offence. So he ended his life Feb. 19. 1114. and was buried beside the former Thomas his vncle.
            
            
               28 Thurstan.
               
                  THomas the Archbishop being taken away (as before I haue declared) Thurstan a Cannon of Paules,1108 Hen: 1.10. and the Kings Chaplaine was chosen to succeed him. He when by no meanes hee could obtaine consecration of Ralph Archbishop of Canterbury, without making profession of subiection, renounced and forsooke the benefit of his election. Yet remembring himselfe at last, he went to Rome, to plead his cause before the Pope, and obtained letters to the King, and Archbishoppe of Canterbury in commendation of his cause. These letters preuayling nothing with the Archbishop that would bee wonne by no meanes, and Thurstan continuing as obstinate in his resolution: The See remained voide a long time. At last it fell out that a Councell was summoned to be held at Rhemes, Thurstan crauing leaue of the King to goe

thither, could not obtaine it before he had promised that hee would not receiue consecration there. Which promise notwithstanding, so well hée followed his businesse, that before the comming ouer of other English Bishoppes to the Councel, he was a Bishop ready consecrate as well as they, and that by the hand of the Pope himselfe. So he (and he only I thinke of all the Archbishops of York since the Conquest) neuer made profession of subiection to the Metropoliticall Sée of Canterbury. The king hearing of this dealing, was very greatly offended with Thurstan, and forbad him England. Neither could the Pope (meeting with the King at Gisors. and intreating for him) so pacifie his displeasure, as that hee would suffer him to returne. After fiue yeeres banishment, the Pope writ a very sharpe letter vnto the king, signifying that hee would excommunicate both him, and the Archbishop of Canterbury also, if Thurstan were any longer kept from his Sée and charge. Hereupon he was called home, and some after reconciled vnto the King. This man is much praysed first for his learning, then for his greate wisedome and discretion; and lastly, for his industry and diligence, his care and painfulnesse, in well gouerning the charge committed to him. Hee was a very kinde man to his Canons, vnto whom amongst other things, hee affoorded this priuiledge, that the yearely profit of their Prebends, being diuided into three parts, it should bee lawfull for any Canon to bequeath two parts of the yeare next ensuing his death, allotting the third vnto the fabricke, that is, toward the reparation of the Church. This order hee set downe not onely at Yorke, but at Beuerley also, at Southwell, at Rippon, and at Glocester; all which were Colledges founded by Archbishops of Yorke. Moreouer it is to bee remembred, that hée either founded a new, or renewed and repayred eight Monasteries. One of them was that of Fountaines for white Monks, valued at the suppression in 1173. l. 7. d. ob. yearely reuenew. In the latter end of his time, to wit, Iune 4. 1137, a lamentable chance befell his Church and City. By casuall fire Saint Peters Church in Yorke, Saint Maries without the walles, a hospitall of his owne building, and nine and thirty other churches were destroyed, and the whole city almost vtterly consumed.

The yéere following (to wit, 1148.) when as Dauid king of Scots entring our borders with a very great army, burnt and spoyled all the Country as farre as the riuer of Teyse: this Archbishop gathering together such power as hée was able to raise v

Howbeit Houeden saith, that at the battel hée was not himselfe present, being hindred by sicknesse. Hauing continued in that Sée sixe and twenty yéeres, from the time of his election, and being a very aged man, he determined to forsake the world, and become a Monke at Pontfract which he did, resigning his Bishopricke, Ianuary 15. 1140. His cowle was scarse warme vpon his backe when death appointed him the vse of another garment. Eleuen dayes after his resignation he died, viz. the fift of February, the yéere aforesaid.

               KIng Stephen had a kinsman named William (that was sonne vnto Emma his sister by Earle Herbert,
                  1142 Steph. 8. a man no lesse noble in mind and vertue, then stocke and lineage. He being Treasurer of Yorke, was now elected vnto the Archbishopricke, and hauing obtained consecration also, sent to Rome for his pall. His spéede there, was not so good as hee looked for: By some aduersaries many exceptions were taken against him, whereby it came to passe not onely his suite was put off and staid for that time, but also Proces awarded to admonish him to come thither in person to answere the accusations laied against him. At his comming to Rome, hée found his aduersaries many and mighty. And amongst the rest it is remembred that Saint Bernard then liuing was very earnest against him. Eugenius the Pope had béene brought vp in the Abbey of Clareuall vnder S. Barnard, together with Henry Murdac, whom Williams aduersaries had set vp to bée a suiter for his Archbishopricke. The Pope being thus carried away with the perswasion of his olde acquaintance, and some shew of matter, was content to depriue William, and to place Henry Murdac

in his roome, whom he caused to be consecrate presently, and sent him home into England with his Pall. King Stephen hearing this newes, was much grieued with the disgrace of his nephew, which all men iudged vndeserued. Therefore he stood vpon termes with the new Archbishoppe, and required him to sweare vnto him fealty in some extraordinary manner, and when hée denied, easily tooke occasion of displeasure against him. The townsmen of Yorke that loued William exceedingly for his gentlenesse and vertuous behauiour amongst them; hearing how the king was affected; refused to receiue Murdac into their City. For this resistance he suspended them: which notwithstanding, Eustach the kinges sonne, commanded seruice to bée said as at all other times was accustomed. By meanes hereof, as also by reason that the Kings officers were very terrible and heauy enimies vnto all that had laboured for the depriuation of William: seditions &amp; tumults were dayly raysed in the City, amongst which a certaine Archdeacon, a friend of the Archbishoppes was slaine. Two or thrée yéeres these stirs continued, till at last, the Kings wrath by meanes being appeased, Yorke men were content to receiue their Archbishop peaceably. Hée gouerned very austerely the space of ten yeares, died Octob. 14. 1153. at Sherborne, and was buried in his Cathedrall Church.

                     3. Stephen 18. betooke himselfe to the Monastery of Winchester, liuing much in the company of Henry the Bishoppe, that did first consecrate him. Now yée shall vnderstand, that a little before the death of Henry Murdac, Eugenius the Pope his olde companion, and Saint Bernard the Master of them both (for they had been his schollers) were taken out of this life. William then was greatly animated by his friends to make complaint vnto Anastasius the new Pope of the wrong heretofore done vnto him, and prouoked by their importunity, did so indéed, trauelling to Rome, in his

owne person. He had scarce commented his complaint, when newes was brought that H. Murdac also his olde aduersary was likewise departed this life. Following then the aduise of Gregory a Cardinall, a very politique and subtle fellow: without any great suite hée was restored vnto all his honors and had the pall deliuered vnto him. He was returned into England before Easter, which hee kept with his olde friend Henry the Bishop of Winchester. Hasting then home to his owne Church, he was met vpon the way by Robert the Dean and Osbert the Archdeacon of Yorke, who forbad him entrance in the Church, and appealed vnto Rome against him, which he little esteemed, but went forward notwithstanding. Al the rest of the Clergy and Commonalty receiued him with wonderfullioy. Pol. Virg. reporteth, that passing ouer the riuer beyond Pontfract, the number of the people that followed him to doo him honour, was so infinite, as the bridge being but of timber, brake euen iust as the Bishop was ouer, &amp; threw them all into the water. But the blessing and prayer of this holy man (he supposeth) preuailed so much with God, as they were all miraculously preserued from drowning. Into his City he was honourably receiued, and began a very mild and gentle gouernment, shewing no token of gall or malice toward his ancient and most bitter enemies, but hee was taken away by death before he could perform any great matter otherwise. Soone after Whitsontide hee fell sicke (as it séemed) of a kinde of ague, and within a day or two after departed this life. The common report is, that hee was poysoned in the challice at Masse. And so saith the Antheme appointed to bee sung vpon his holyday (for anon we shal haue him a Saint) wherein are contained these verses:

                     Eboracum praesul redit,
                     Pontis casus nullum laedit

Some (as namely Houeden) say that poyson was con
                     •
                  aied into the water, in which he should wash his hands at Masse time. But Newbrigensis confuteth both these opinions at large, lib. 1. cap. 26. Certaine it is, that not onely after his death, but also while he yet liued, in his sicknesse time, many suspected vehemently that he was poysoned. Insomuch as one of his Chaplaines aduised him to take some Antidotum or remedy against poyson, which he also did, as one affirmeth; but other say, he answered, quod antidotum humanum adijcere nollet diuino, that he would not adde the preseruatiue of the body vnto the preseruatiue of the soule, because forsooth he had then lately receiued the Sacrament. Howsoeuer it was, hee died very suddenly, his téeth waxing blacke a little before his death, and not without some other notes and significations of poyson. The time of his departure was, Iune. 8. 1154. After his death he was Canonized, and the day aforesaid, Iune 8. appointed vnto the celebration of his memory. Many miracles are said to haue béene wrought at his toombe in the Cathedrall Church of Yorke. Beléeue it that list, I cannot. To say no more, me thinks the man whose depriuation S Barnard procured, should not be worthy to be reputed a Saint, or like to worke miracles.

Steph. 19NO sooner was William dead, but Robert the Deane and Osbert the Archdeacon, laide plots for the election of Roger Archdeacon of Canterbury; and procuring the Archbishop and the Popes Legate to become suiters for him, with much adoo they induced the Chapter to choose him. Hee was consecrate by Anastasius the Pope, about the middle of Octob. 1154. This man is not gratious in our sto

                  ies, yet hee is confessed to haue béen very learned, well spoken,

passing wife and a great agmenter of the state of his Bishopricke, both in reuenues and buildings. The reason is, he fauoured not monkes, by whom in a manner all our histories are written. He was wont to say, that Thurstan neuer did a worse deede then in erecting the monastery of Fountney. And that it may appeare hee faigned not this mislike, you shall find in Newbridg. lib. 3. cap. 5. That a certaine religious man comming vnto him when hee lay vpon his death bed, requested him to confirme certaine graunts made vnto their house: to whom hée answered, you see my friend I am now vpon the point of death, it is no time to dissemble; I feare God, and in regard thereof refraine to satisfie your request; which I protest I cannot do with a good conscience; A strange doctrine in those daies; but béeing a wise man and learned, hee must néedes discerne, that the monkes of his time were so farre swarned and degenerate from the holinesse of those first excellent men of the primitiue Church, as they resembled rather any other kind of people, then those whom they pretended in profession to succéed. Those men (the monkes I meane) to be reuenged vpon him, hame stamped vpon him two notable faults, one, that he preferred whipping boyes vnto the chiefe dignities of the Church, wherein (were it true) no body can excuse him; The oth
                     •
                  r thing they lay to his charge is manifestly false; They say he was miserably couetous, and how doe they prooue it? Because forsooth hee left a certaine deale of ready money behinde him. Many wise men thinke him vnwise, that hauing ability, will not kéepe somewhat beside him whatsoeuer happen. He was sparing also; a happy world it were if all men were so: Bonus Seruatius facit bonum Bonifacium, (according to the Dutch Prouerbe.) A good

                  auer makes a well-doer. The trueth whereof in him notably appeared Hee built a new the Quier of the Cathedrall Church, and the vawtes of the same decaied with fire; As also his pallace in Yorke that was burnt down to the ground when the Cathedrall Church was so defaced. Againe he erected and built from the foundation, the Chappell of S. Sepulcre néere the pallace-gate vpon the North side of the Cathedrall Church, and impropriated 11. benefices (5. of his owne gift) to the maintenance of ministers in the same, viz.

a Sextane, 4. Priests, 4. Deacons, and 4. Subdeacons. All these things he performed, and many other of lesse moment, that the monkes find no fault with at all. He continued Archbishop 27. years, and being a very aged man, sickned at Lo

                  d, whether calling vnto him many Abbots, Priors, and other religious persons, by their aduice he bestowed his goods, deliuering out presently great summes of money to the vse of the poore, and other good purposes, as vnto the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rhemes and Roane, 500. pound a peece, and to almost euery Bishop of England and Normandy a certain portion. This done, he remoued to Yorke, (saith Houeden) other say to Sherborne, and there died vpon sunday Nou. 22. 1181. and was buried by Hugh Bishop of Durham in the middle of the Quire of the Canons regular which himselfe had built. Now whereas in his life-time he had procured Alexander the Pope to grant this priuiledge, that if any Cleergy-man died in his Prouince, and deliuered not his goods away by hand before his death, the Archbishop should haue the disposition of them; it pleased God that the same measure he meat vnto other, he should be serued withall himselfe. He left behind him (or had at least wise what time he sickned) 11000. pound in siluer, and 300. pound of gold, beside an infinite deale of plate, and sumptuous houshold-stuffe. All this (though hée had bestowed it (as aforesaid) the king notwithstanding seased vpon, and conuerted it to his owne vse, saying, it was no reason that his will should stand for good, that had disanulled the Testaments of so many other.

Ric. 1.3.THe Sée of Lincolne happening to be void by the death of Robert de Chisueto the yéere 1167. king Henry the second procured Geoffry his base sonne, a young tender delicate youth, yet Archdeacon of Lincolne, to bee elected to the Bishopricke. He content with the large reuenues of the same, made no hast to receiue consecration, as hauing more care of sheering the shéep, then féeding them, which he knew he might

do without consecration as well as with it. Seuen yeares he held the Bishopricke after that sort, and at length by the perswasion of his Father, desirous to haue his sonne neere about him (as some say) or perceiuing him vnfit to make a Cleargy man (as other say.) He resigned his interest in the Church of Lincolne, and got him to the Court, where he was made Lord Chancellor of England, &amp; held that office about 8. yeeres, viz. vntil the year 1189. at what time his Father died. Many Bishopricks at that time were void, &amp; had bin some of them a long season, as Yorke now 10. years, and Lincoln 17. K. Richard therefore vnderstanding the people murmured and grudged much at these long vacations, &amp; knowing also it imported him to sée his brother prouided for, he thought to stop 2. gaps with one bush, &amp; at once to furnish Yorke with an Archbi. and his brother with a liuing. So hee writ his letters to the Chapter of Yorke in his brothers behalfe, who (not without some difficulty) elected him. Hee was cons. at Tours in France, by William Archb. of Tours, in the moneth of Aug. 1191. Presently after his consecration, hee hied him ouer into England, although hee had taken an

                  ath when his brother King Richard began his voyage into the holy land, not to set foote in England within 3. yeares after. Presently therefore vpon his arriual, he was imprisoned William B. of Ely the Chancellor, being drawn from the very altar of S. Martins church in Douer; but hee was quickly set at liberty againe; This man prooued a better Bishop than was expected, gouerning his Prouince (if not somewhat too stoutly, according to the courage requisite in a man of so high birth and nobility) very wel &amp; commondably. He is praysed much for his temperance, sobernes &amp; grauity both of countenance &amp; behauiour. Al the time of his brother Richard he had much adoe with his Canons of Yorke who by complaints vnto the Pope and the K. troubled him much. Betwéene him and K. Iohn (who was his brother also) there was likewise much adoe. In the second yeare of his raigne, he commanded the Sheriffe of Yorkshire to sei

                  e vpon all the goods and lands of the Archb. and his seisure to returne into the exchequer, which was done accordingly: whereupon the saide Archbishop excommunicated, not ea

                  ly the Sheriffe that had done him this violence, but all those in generall

that were the authors of the same, and that had béene any meanes to stirre vp the kings indignation against them. The cause of this trouble is diuersly reported: some say, that he hindred the kings officers in gathring a kind o

                  xe through his Dioces; others, that he refused to saile into Normandy with him, when he went to make a marriage for his neece, and to conclude a league with the French King. Whether one of these were the cause, or both, or none, I cannot tell; But certaine it is, that one whole yeare his temporalties were detained from him, his mooueable goods neuer restored, and yet moreouer he was faine to pay a thousand pound sterling for his restitution. This was a greater wound then it might easily be cured. Sixe or 7. yeares after it brake out againe, to wit, an. 1207. King Iohn then beeing at Winchester required such of the Cleargy and nobility, as were there present to consent, that payment should be made vnto him, of the thirteenth shilling of all the mooueable goods in England; this motion no man gainesaid, but Geffry the Archbishop his brother. After this, whether it were he were guilty of some greater attempt, or that hee vnderstood, his brother to be grieuouslie offended with him for withstanding, this his desire; well perceiuing England was too hote for him, secretly hee auoided the Realme, excommunicating before his departure such of his iurisdiction, as either had paid the saide taxe, or should heereafter pay it. He liued then in banishment 5. years euen vntill hee was called to his long home by death, which was the yeare 1213. So he continued Archbishop somewhat more then 21 yeares.

In the meane space, Symon de Langton, brother vnto Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, was elected by the Chapter of Yorke. But king Iohn being latelye become tributary vnto the Church of Rome, easily found meanes to Cassire and disanull that election. If the old quarrell betwéene the Archbishop and him, stucke something in his stomacke, I maruell not: but he alleaged that he thought

it dangerous and very inconuenient the whole Church of England should bee ruled by two brethren; one at Canterbury in the South, and an other at Yorke in the North. Hee laboured then very earnestly to haue Walter Gray his Counsellor remooued from Worceter to Yorke. The Cannons there refused him for want of learning (as they said, albeit I find he spent some time in the Uniuersitie of Oxford,) but at last they were content to accept him, in regard (forsooth) of his singular temperance and chastitie: they seemed to be perswaded that hee had continued till that time a pure maide. The matter was they durst doe no other but yeelde, and then thought good to make a vertue of necessitie.

Paris. The yeare 1234 there was great dearth and scarcitie of corne, (and by reason that the dearth had continued then three yeares) mortalitie of people also, as well by pestilen

Amongst many rich men that were nothing mooued with compassion toward the poore daily perishing for want of releefe, this Archbishop is especially noted, that had fiue yeares corne in store and would not thresh it out. Being told at last by his officers, that it was much to bee feared, it was consumed by mice, or some other way much the worse for so long standing: hee bid them to deliuer it to the husbandmen that dwelt in his Mannors, vppon condition they should pay as much new corne for it after haruest. They intending to doe as hee commanded, went about to take downe a great mowe of corne hee had at Rippon. And first comming toward it, they saw the heads of many serpents, snakes, toads, and other venemous creatures peering out at the ends of the sheaues. This being tolde vnto the Archbishoppe, hee sent his steward, and diuers of good credit, to enquire the truth thereof: who seeing that which the other

had séene, enforced notwithstanding certaine poore men to goe vp into the top of it with ladders. They were scarcely vp, when they saw a blacke smoake rise out of the corne, and felt a most loathsome stinke, which compelled them with all haste possible to get them downe againe. Moreouer, they all heard an vnknowne voice saying vnto them, Let the corne alone; for the Archbishop and all he hath is the diuels possession. To make short they were saine to build a wall about it, and then to set it on f

Matthew Westminster commendeth the man greatly for his wisedome in gouernment and his loyall fidelitie vnto his Prince: and that hee deserued this commendation, I account it no slender proofe, that Queene Elianore (to whom her husband King Henry the third had committed the charge of the Realme trauelling into Fraunce) she (I say) hauing occasion to crosse the seas to con

It was in the yeere 1253. at what time he being a very aged man and sickly, was excéeding loth to take it vpon him. Hee sate Archbishop aboue nine and thirty yéeres, in which space he did many things to the good and benefit, both of his Sée and Church. The mannor of Thorpe hee purchased &amp; the Church of the same, both which he gaue in effect vnto his Sée, but verbo tenus vnto the Deane and Chapter; taking assurance of them, that they should alwaies graunt it ouer vnto the Archbishop for the time being.

He bought vnto his See the house now called White Hall (and heeretofore Yorke place.) Hubert de Burgo Earle of Kent built it, and gaue it vnto the Fryer preachers in

London, who sold it vnto this Archbishop. In the time of Cardinall Woolsies disgrace, the King required it of him; and he either for feare, or else hope of currying a little fauour with the King that way, yeelded by and by. As for this man hee died at last on May day 1255. and was buried in S. Peters Church.
            
            
               34 Sewall.
               WHen the King heard of his death,1259. Hen: 3.40. he determined not to suffer his place to be filled ouer hastily. All other Bishoprickes of England (saith he) haue been in my hands heretofore, but this neuer: Therefore I must be aduised how I let it passe out of my fingers. The Chapter after a conuenient space, made choise of Sewall their Deane that was brought vp in the Uniuersitie of Oxford, a man modest, vertuous and learned; being well seene not onely in Diuinitie, but in Law also and much other good learning. Diuers of his writings remaine and are remembred by Bale in his Centuries. Hee was a diligent hearer of Edmund of Abenden (after Archbishop of Canterbury, and canonized a Saint) at what time hee read the Diuinity lecture in Oxford. This Saint Edmund (as Matthew Paris reporteth) would often tell his scholler Sewall, that out of all question hee should die a Martyr. How farre foorth this prediction fell out true, you shall heare anon. Now the King not liking this speed of the Chapter-men, as not being for his profit, hindred the new elect what hee might; and for want of better matter, alleaged against him that hee was a bastard, and so by the Cannons vncapable of that honour. It was true enough, and how he salued that sore, I cannot tell: A dispensation belike from Rome (where all things were then to be had for money) tooke away that obstacle. I finde he was consecrate by the suffagran Bishops of his owne Prouince, Iuly 23. 1256. a yeare and almost three moneths, after the death of his predecessor. His Deanry being thus voide, the Pope tooke vpon him to bestow the same vpon one Iordan a stranger, that vnderstood not one woorde of English, and otherwise vtterly vnwoorthy of that goodly preferment. This Iordan, doubting least in taking possession

hee might happily bee resisted, 
                     •
                  ame into the Church of Yorke, at dinner-time, and inquiring of one (whom by chance hee found then at his prayers) which was the Deanes stall, caused two of his owne company to deliuer him possession thereof. This being done, though in hugger mugger, was quickly brought vnto the Archbishops eares; who grieued infinitely at the same, and sought by all meanes possible to disanull and make voide the Popes gift. The Cannons and Church-men were so amazed with this strange and extraordinary course (strange in those dayes, but afterwards too common) as they knew not what to doe or say. It séemed most absurd and detestable vnto them, that so high a dignitie, and an office of such importance, in place and authoritie next vnto the Archbishop, should bee conferred vpon a base, obscure and contemptible fellow. But they stood so in awe of the Popes tyrannie, whereunto the King had subiected, and as it were, prostrate himselfe, that they durst not make any profession of mislike. About the same time the Pope sent a commandement into England, that three hundred of the next benefices that fell should bee bestowed vpon certaine Italians that hee named; men ignorant of the English tongue, and though otherwise perhaps worthy the places appointed them (which is greatly to be doubted) yet in that respect most vnfit heere to haue cure of soules committed vnto them. In this iniurious course, our Sewall couragiously withstood him; and not onely by word and letter sharply reprehended the Pope, but also in déeds resisted this his tyrannie, vtterly refusing to admit either Iordan vnto the Deanry, or any other of his Italians to any other promotion in his Diocesse For his labour he was quickly suspended. Wherewith he was so little terrified, as that notwithstanding, hee stood still stoutly to his tackling, and yéelded not one inch. Iordan therefore, whether doubting of good successe, or wearied with trouble, or in regard that hee perceiued himselfe very odious in Yorke, resigned his Deanry, accepting a pension of a hundred markes out of it. This composition with Iordan, nothing appeased the Popes fury: determining belike to make him an example to other, hee first caused his crosse in contumelious manner to be taken from him, and soone after thundring out his greatest excommunication, causing

him to bee cursed throughout England with b

                  nite other vexations (sayth Matthew Paris) hée was much disgraced in the sight of the world; but became no doubt farre the more acceptable in the sight of God. So long he denied to bow his knées vnto this Baal, as ouercome with care, and not enduring those continuall molestations, he died at last hart-broken, much better deseruing the name of a Martyr, then many other to whom the Church of Rome hath afforded that title. Lying vpon his deathbed, &amp; perceiuing his end to approach, with watry eies looking stedfastly towards Heauen, in the bitternes of his soule he made this prayer, which I thinke not vnworthy in this place to be inserted: Lord Iesus Christ thou most iust iudge, from whose omnise

                   also he writ vnto the Pope a very effectuall, and pithy letter, wherein hee laied before him at large the miserable estate into which the tyranny of him and his predecessors had brought the Church; praying him to haue a care to mend what was amisse, &amp; to remember that Christ repeated vnto Peter thrice, Feed my sheepe; but not so much as once or halfe once bid him either to s

He did so, and was faine to redeeme the Kings fauour with 4000. marks. The indignation of a Prince is death (saith the Wise man.) And likely enough it is, that the griefe of his displeasure, and the trouble that ensued it, might soone cause some incurable disease that tooke him away. He died at Burton néere Beuerly, and was buried in his Cathedral Church, which with goodly building he had much augmented and beautified.

That place the Pope (vpon his consecration) gaue vnto a kinsman of his owne, that soone after died; but vpon his death bed he séemed greatly burthened in conscience for accepting a charge that he could affoord so little attendance vnto, and therefore besought the Pope that he would take a course the said proportion after his death might bee bestowed vpon some worthy man that might make amends for that which in his time had hetherto béene wanting. Héereupon the Pope presently after his kinsmans death, writ his letter to the Archbishop requiring him to appoint vnto that place some worthy Diuine that would vndertake alwaies to reside vpon it. He did so, and made choise of Gilbert Segraue that was after Bishop of London. In the meane space the King had written his letters in behalfe of one Iohn Bush his Secretary, and accepting no excuse or satisfaction, for not satisfying his desire therein, in great displeasure he tooke away from him thrée Baronies (as one saith I thinke he meaneth Mannors) appertaining of olde vnto his S

But it cost him 9500. markes beside the charge that he was at while hee lay in the Popes Court a suter. By reason of these immoderate expenses, he became so bare, that at his first returne into England he was faine to make two collections amongst his cleargy in one yeare; the first he called a beneuolence, the second an aide.

Diuers of the Nobility malecontent, tooke Armes against the king, caused many whom they misliked to be condemned by Parliament, some to death, some to prison, &amp;c. Amongst the rest, this Archbishop was accused to be one that abused the kings youth by flattery, and with whispering tales entised him against tho Nobility, and for this cause he was condemned to perpetuall prison, and appointed vnto the Castle of Rochester there to be kept. But he, foreseeing the tempest that grew toward him, fled out of the Realm. The Pope then (Vrbane the flit) whe

Howsoeuer it was meant, sure it fell out to be a very bad exchange for his part. Scotland at that time re

                  d obedience to the Antipope. By meanes whereof Vrbans gift

was not of sufficient force, to inuest him in Saint Andrewes and yet quite cut him off from York, at home. Hereby it came to passe, that hauing the reuenues, neither of the one, nor the other, for very want he was faine to become a parish Priest, and so liued three yeares at Louaine, euen vntill his death. He was banished the yéere, 1386. liued in exile almost fiue yeers, died 1391. and was buried in the church of the Frier Carmelites there. This man bestowed much cost in repayring the Castle of Cawod, building diuers towers, and other edifiees about the same.

                  ALexander Neuill being thus displaced vnder pretence of preferment to a new place; The Pope tooke vpon him to bestow Yorke; And least if he should aduance one to it, not greatly preferred before, the old incumbent might chaunce in time to recouer it from him againe; Hee thought good to bestow it so, as benefiting many hee might procure so many aduersaries vnto Neuill, wherof any one alone might hardly séeme able to withstand him, but all these together hee knew very well. To this end (or rather happily to gaine the more in the first fruits) hée called Thomas Arundell from Ely to Yorke, translated the Bishop of Durham to Ely, Bath to Durham, Salisbury to Bathe, and gaue Salisbury to Iohn Waltham the kings Chaplaine, a man very gracious with him, and Keeper of his Priuy Seale. This Thomas Arundell the yeere 1396. was remooued to Canterbury, the first that euer was translated from Yorke thither. While hée was at Yorke, he bestowed much in building vpon diuers of his houses, and vnto the Church he gaue, besides many rich ornaments, two great basons of siluer and gilt, two great Censers, two other basons of siluer, and two Crewettes. Hee gaue to the vse of the Uicars a siluer cup of great waight, &amp; a bowle of siluer very massiue and costly vnto the Canons. Being yet Bishop of Ely, hee was Lord Chancellour of England, and so continued till the yeare, 1396. at what time beeing remooued to Canterbury, hee gaue ouer immediately that office. In the meane while, the yeare 1393. being yet at

Yorke, it is remembred, that hée remooued all the Kinges Court from Westminster to Yorke, pretending a desire to punish the pride and presumption of the Londoners, who were then in great disgrace with the King, alleadging also peraduenture that those Courtes had beene helde there about fourescore yeares past, the space of seuen yeares together, as in T. Corbrldge I haue remembred. Howeit the Londoners affirmed, that whatsoeuer he pretended, he did it to no other end but to helpe his neighbors of Yorke. Whatsoeuer his purpose was, that nouelty continued a short time: For after a tearme or two the Courts were brought backe to their accustomed place.

                  RObert Waldby Bishop of Chichester succéeded Thomas Arundell in Yorke.1396. Ric. 2.20 Being yet a yong man, hee followed Edward the Blacke Prince into France, where he continued long a Student, and profited so much, as no man in the Uniuersity where he liued (Tholous being notwithstanding an Oxford man also) might be compared with him for all kind of learning. He was a good Linguist, very well seene in Philosophy, both naturall and morall, in Physicke, and the Canon Law also; very eloquent, an excellent Preacher, and esteemed so profound a Diuine, as hee was thought méete to be the professor of Diuinity, or Doctor of the Chaire in the said Uniuersity. For these his good gifts he was much fauoured of the Blacke Prince first, then of K. Richard his sonne: and by their fauour obtained first a Bishopricke in Gascoign, (as Bale reporteth) but by an Antiquity that I ha
                     •
                  e seene; it appeareth he was first Bishop of the Isle of Man, whose stile is Episcophs Sodorensis, &amp; his Epitaph saith, he was first praesul Adurensis. From that first preferment whatsoeuer it was, he was translated, a. 1387. to the Archbishoprick of Dublin in Ireland; thence to Chichester, 1395. &amp; the yeere following, became an Archbishop once more, viz. of Yorke. There he sate not fully 3. yéeres but he died May 29. 1397 and was buried in Westminster almost in the middle of the Chappell of S.

                     . and Treasurer of England vnder king Richard; yet obtained not this high promotion without desert, in regard of many good parts in him. For he was incomparably learned (saith Thomas Walsingham) of singular integrity for his life and conuersation, and (which is not altogether to bee neglected) of a goodly and amiable personage. He was brought vp in Cambridge (as Bale deliuereth, Gul. Monestriensis saith it was in Oxford) and procéeded there first Master of Arte, then Doctor of Law, thence he trauelled through France into Italy, and became an aduocate in the Popes Court, vntill that at last returning home he was made Lord Chancellour of England, in the 2. years of king Richard the second, but continued not aboue one yeare in that place, August 9. 1396. hee was consecrate Bishop of Couentry and Lichfield, managed that charge laudably, and is commended as well for his own priuate manners and behauiour, as his publike gouernment. His ende was vnhappy and very miserable. King Henry had lately deposed King Richard, by whome this man was preferred, and had caused his brother aforenamed the Earle of Wiltshire to be beheaded at Bristow. Whether it were desire to reuenge these wrongs done to his friends, or some other respect
                     •
                   I know not, certaine it is, that the yéere 1405 he ioined with the Earle of Northumberland, the Earle Marshall, the Lord Bardolph, and other in a conspiracy against King Henry. The Earle of Westmerland, and Iohn Duke of Lancaster, the kings sonne, were then in the North Country, when these men began to stirre, and gathering what forces they could, came against them. But finding the other too strong for them, they enquire of them in peaceable manner what their intent should be in taking Armes. The Archbishop answered, that he meant nothing but the good of the Realme,

as he would gladly certifie him, if he had secure and safe accesse vnto him. And therewithall shewed a writing, wherein he charged the now king with treason against his Soueraigne King Richard, oppression of the Church and Commonalty, whose Liberties he had sworne to defend, tyranny &amp; cruelty in putting to death the sayd king, many of the Nobility and great numbers of the Commons; with impiety and sacriledge in defrauding the Church of Rome of her rights; and lastly with euill gouernement, perfidiousnesse, periury, &amp; diuers other like hainous crimes, for which hee pronounced him excommunicate; requiring all men to ioyne with that company, whose endeauour should bee, but to reforme what was amisse; to feate and settle in the kingdome the right Heire; to establish peace in Wales and Ireland, and to free the Realme from the great and intollerable burthen of exactions, no longer to be endured. The Earle of Westmerland hauing read this writing, professed to allow of the enterprise, and praised it for honest and reasonable, insomuch as méeting with the Archbishop at a parly, after a very few speeches, they séemed to become friends, shaking hands together, and drinking to each other in sight of both their armies. The Archbishop now doubting of nothing suffered his men to disperse themselues for a time: But the Earle contrariwise waxed stronger and stronger

                   and at least seeing himselfe well able to deale with the Archbishop, came vpon him sodainely, and arrested him little thinking of any such matter. The king by this times was come Northward as farre as Pomfret. Thither the Archbishop and other prisoners arrested with him, were also brought, and carried with the king barke to Yorke againe (or as one deliuereth) to Thorpe, where Sir William Fulford, a knight learned in the Law, and another Iustice called Gascoyne, sitting on a high Stage in the Hall condemned him to bee beheaded Whether hee were tried by his Péeres or no I finde not: and much lesse can I pronounce, whether it be explorati

                  ed it; But first, whether he was a Péere of the Realme or no, I must refer my selfe to an Act, Edward
                  
3.25. where Bishops are tearmed Péeres of the land. And certaine it is, by the report of the Author of the Booke, entituled Antiquitates Britannicae that Iohn Stratford Archbishop of Canterbury, being shut out of the Parliament house, vpon the Kings displeasure, alleaged he was maior pars regni post Regem, &amp;c. and was not gaine-said. Then for the other point, there is an Act, that all and singular Lords of the Parliament for the offence in that Act mentioned shall bee tryed by their Péeres. And we haue an example where the said Iohn Stratford béeing accused by the King of diuers hai

                  ous crimes, was appointed to bée ordered by foure Bishops, foure Earles, and foure Barons. But to returne to my story, presently after the iudgement giuen the Archbishop was set vppon an ill-sauoured Iade, his face towards the horse taile, and carried with great scorne and shame to a field hard by, where his head lastly was stricken off; by a fellow that did his office very ill, not being able to dispatch him with lesse than fiue strokes. He was executed vpon Whitson munday, being the eight of Iune, 1405. and was buried in the East part of the new workes of his Church of Yorke; in which place, as also the field where hee died, certaine miracles are sayd to haue béene done, and are ascribed vnto his holinesse. It is deliuered also, that the king presently after his death was stricken with a leprosie. He was the first Bishop that I finde put to death by order of Law. No maruell if an execution so vnwoonted and extraordinary, performed in so odious and contumelious a manner, gaue occasion of many tales and rumours. Amongst the rest I finde a report laying an imputation vpon the posterity of the Iudges, who gaue sentence against him. I will not doe them the wrong to mention it. The Pope excommunicated the Authors of his death, but was easily entreated to absolue them againe.

                  1406. Hen. 4.8. The Pope had once placed in the same Robert Halam Chancellour of the Uniuesity of Oxford. But vnderstanding that the King was greatly displeased therewith, hee was content (according to the kings desire, to gratifie Henry Bowet then Bishoppe of Bathe with this preferment, and made Halam Bishoppe of Salisbury. This Henry Bowet was a Doctor of Law, and first a Cannon of Wels, had trauelled much in France and Italy, &amp; was preferred to Bath also at first by the King, who fauoured him much. Hee was consecrate to that Church, Nouember 16. 1401. and translated to Yorke, December first, 1406. About the yeere 1403 he was Treasurer of England the space of one yeere. He continued Archbishop almost 17. yéeres, in which time viz. the yéere 1417. it hapned that king Henry the 5, being absent &amp; busie in the conquest of France, the Scots came with a great power into the Realme, and besieged Barw

This Bishop was then a very aged man, and so impotent, as hée was able neither to goe nor ride, yet would hee néedes accompany his Countrimen that went against the Scots, &amp; caused his men to carrie him in a chaire, that so at least by words and exhortation he might doe his best, though he were not able to fight, nay not so much as to stand or goe. This man is said to bee the greatest housekeeper of any Archbishop that euer sate in Yorke before him. For proofe whereof it is alleadged, that he spent vsually in his house, of Claret wine onely 80. tuns. He departed this life at Cawood, Octob.

Many statutes and lawes had béene made to represse this tyrannicall dealing of the Pope. But his excommunications were such terrible bugs, as men durst rather offend the lawes of their country, then come within the compasse of his censures. Yet the Deane and Chapter of Yorke taking stomacke vnto them, vsed such aduantage as the Law would affoorde them, and by force kept out the new Archbishop from entring his Church. Much ado there was betwéen them. The euent was, that the Pope vnable to make good his gift, was saine to returne Fleming to Lincolne againe, and to translate Iohn Kempe Bishop of London, (a man better fauoured of the Deane and Chapter) to Yorke. This Iohn Kempe was first Bishop of Rochester (consecrate the yeere 1418.) remooued thence to Chichester 1422. from Chichester to London the same yéere, and from London to Yorke 1425. when the Sée had béene void 2. yeeres. At Yorke he continued almost 28. yeeres, and in his olde age, euen one yeare before his death, was content to remoue once more, viz. to Canterbury. The yeare 1449.

Hée sate iust 12. yeares, died at Southwell, September 20. and was buried in the Chappell of our Lady there, nigh to the Archbishops

pallace, 1464. He bestowed much cost in repayring the pallace of Yorke. About the latter end of his time, viz. the yéere 1464. the Minster of Yorke was burnt, I know not by what chance.

                  RIchard Neuill that great Earle of Warwicke,1466. Edw. 4.7. that set vp and pulled downe Kings at his pleasure, aduanced vnto great and high places George Neuill his brother, béeing yet but a very young man; that was sometimes Chancellour of the Uniuersity of Oxford, &amp; brought vp for a time in Baylioll Colledge there. By his meanes hée was consecrate Bishoppe of Oxceter, the 25. of Nouember, 1455. at what time hée was not fully twenty yeares of age. The yéere 1460. hée was made Lord Chancellour of England, the youngest Chancellour I thinke that euer was, eyther before or since his time. In that office hee continued till the yéere 1464. viz. vntill the marriage of K. Edward the 4. In which action, the king well knowing hée had giuen cause of offence vnto the Earle of Warwicke (for it was done whilest the Earle was Ambassadour in Fraunce, and busie in a Treaty for a match betwéene the King and the French Quéenes sister.) He thought it necessary to weaken him what hee might, and so first remooued this his brother from the office of Chancellour, and bestowed it vpon Robert Stillington Bishop of Bathe. Notwithstanding this alienation of the king from him, the yeare 1466. hée obtained the Archbishopricke of Yorke, and held the same, (but with great trouble) vntill his death. The discontentment of the dishonour done to the Earle by the kings marriage, sticking stil in his mind, &amp; hauing peraduenture continual occasions of new griefes, hée made a confederacy with his brethren to pull downe king Edward that had raigned now almost nine yéers, and to set vp king Henry the sixt again, who had lain in prison all that while. This indéed they performed partly by the helpe of George Duke of Clarence king Edwards brother. And it was the hap of this Archb. to take K. Edward prisoner, at Owlney in Northampton shire. He carried him thence first

to Warwicke castle, then to Middleham Castle in Yorkeshire But béeing of too good a nature to bée a good Iaylor, vsed him with such curtesie, suffering him to walke abroad, &amp; often to hunt with a few Kéepers to attend him, as (were it by the negligence, or vnfaithfulnesse of those that had the charge of him, I know not) away hée escaped, béeing met vpon a plain where he hunted by a troupe of his friends, &amp; wasted by them into a place of safety. Within halfe a yéere that K. Henry was restored to his crown again, K. Edward so handled the matter, as comming sodenly to London, &amp; entring the Bishops palace by a posterne gate, he surprised at once K. Henry &amp; the Archbishop that had not long before taken him. They were both carried thence to the Tower of London, where the good King was soon after pittifully murthered. But the Archbishop vpon the 4. of Iune following was set at liberty. About a yeare after his enlargement, he chanced to be with the King a hunting at Windsor, and vpon occasion of the sport they had seene there, made relation vnto the King of some extraordinary kind of game, wherewith he was wont to solace himself at a house he had built, and furnished very sumptuously, called the Moore in Hartfordshire. The king séeming desirous to be partaker of this sport, appointed a day when hee would come thither to hunt, aud make merry with him. Hereupon the Archbishop taking his leaue, got him home, and thinking to entertaine the king in the best manner it was possible for him, he sent for much plate that he had hid during the warres betwéene his brethren and the king, and borrowed also much of his friends. The Déere which the king hunted beeing thus brought into the toyle, the day before his appointed time. hée sent for the Archbishop, commanding him, all excuses set a part, to repayre presently vnto him being at Windsor. As soon as he came, he was arrested of treason; all his plate, money, and other moueable goods (to the value of 20000. l were seised vpon for the king, and himself a long space after was kept prisoner at Calis and Guisnes: during which time, the king tooke vnto himselfe the profites and temporalties of his Bishopricke. Amongst other things then taken from him, he had a Myter of inestimable value, by reason of many rich

                  ish of mind (as was thought) died at Blithlaw comming from Yorke. He was buried in the Minster there. In this mans time Sixtus the fourth made the Bishop of Saint Andrewes Priuate of all Scotland, and appointed twelue Bishops to be vnder him, that vntill that time were of the Prouince of Yorke. The Archbishop with stoode it what he might. But the Pope alleadging it was very vnfitte, that such a one should bee the Metropolitane of Scotland, as for the most part (by reason of warres) was an enemy vnto the same, ouerruled it, and would néedes haue it so.
               
                  The feast that was made at this mans installation, was exceeding great, and such as our age hath seldome (I will not say neuer) seene. And therefore I haue not thought it amisse to impart vnto the Reader an ancient note that I haue light vpon, describing the particulars of the same.

                  Lawrence Boothe, halfe brother vnto William Boothe George Neuils predecessor, succéeded them in the Sée of Yorke. He was first Master of Penbrooke Hall in Cambridge, consecrate Bishop of Durham, September 25. 1457. and twenty yéeres after, viz. the yeare 1477. remooued to Yorke. In August 1472. hee was made Lord Chancellour, and continued in that office two yéeres. This man bought the Manor of Batersey of one Nicolas Stanley, and built the house there, all which he gaue vnto his Sée. He died at Southwell the yéere 1480. when he had béen Archbishop thrée yéeres and nine monethes, and was buried beside his brother.

                  THamas Scot otherwise called Rotheram,
                  1480. Edw. 4.21. was borne at Rotheram in Yorkeshire, and according to the manner of religious persons in olde time, would néedes take his surname of the place where he was borne. Hauing such education as the Country could affoorde him, being now ripe for the Uniuersity, and towardly, was sent by his friendes vnto Cambridge, and was chosen first fellow of Kings Colledge, then Master of Pembrooke Hall, in which place hee continued till hee was called away by preferment. King Edward (whose Chaplaine he was) procured him first the Prouostship of Beuerley, made him kéeper of his Priuy Seale, and then Bishoppe of Rochester, the yeare 1467. Staying there scarce fowre yéers, he remooued to Lincolne, anno 1471. The yeare 1474. he was made Lord Chancellour, and continued

long in that office, euen vntill the raigne of Richard the vsurper, at what time (or a little before) hee deliuered the great Seale vnto the Quéene, and is blamed for committing it vnto her, of whom hee receiued it not, and had no right to require it. For which cause (as was alleadged) he was committed to the Tower by Richard the Duke of Yorke the Protector. But it is to be thought that hee was rather imprisoned indeed, to the entent that being knowne to be too true vnto R. Edward the yong king, he might not hinder the false Protectors trayterous designements. Being yet at Lincolne he bestowed great cost in building the goodly beautifull gate of the Schooles at Cambridge, the walkes on each side thereof, and the new Library that is at the East side of that building, which hee caused to be done of his owne charge, with some very little contribution of the Uniuersity, whereof hee was Chancellour. It was begun the yeare 1470. and quite finished, 1476. Hauing béeue at Lincolne nine yeares, hee was translated to Yorke, and enioyed that honour 20. yéeres la

promotions. Hee died of the plague, May 29. 1500. at Cawood, being 76 yeares of age, and was buried in the Northside of our Lady chappell in a marble toombe, which himselfe caused to bee built in his life time.

This man was a Gentleman borne, and (as I take it) a knights sonne; not preferred for any extraordinary great learning, (yet he was a Doctor of Law of Cambridge) but as it should seem in regard of ser

                  ice. He spent his time in a manner altogether either in temporall businesses (beeing a great courtier) or else in hunting, wherewith he was vnreasonably delighted. He built much at Cawood and Scroby, and maintained a great number of goodly tall fellowes to attend him. Before his time, it was alwaies the custome that the Archbishop at his installation should make a very magnificent and sumptuous feast. This custome for sauing a little money he brake and stole his installation by a deputy in secret manner. Hauing béene seuen yéere Archbishop, he died at Cawood, and tooke order that his body should be buried at Yorke, but his heart at Maklesfield in Cheshire where hee was borne, in a Chappell of his own building which he minded to haue made a Colledge, but death preuented him.

                  Henry vpon the perswasion of this man, (saith Ciaconius) was content to take the Popes part. For which seruice, the yeare 1511. in the Moneth of March, the Pope made him a Cardinall at S. Praxedis. Whether he stayd so long at Rome or made a second iourney thither I cannot tell: But certaine it is, that being there, the year 1514. he was poysoned by one Rinaldo de Modena an Italian Priest his steward, vpon malice and displeasure conceiued, for a blow his Master gaue him, as the saide Rinaldo (beeing executed for that fact) confessed at the time of his death. So P. Iouius reporteth. Hee died Iuly 14. and was buried there in the Church belonging to the English house, dedicated to the holy Trinitie.
            
            
               57 Thomas Woolsey.
               
                  1515. Hen. 8.7.THat famous Cardinall Thomas Woolsey (of whome wée are next to speake) was borne in Ipswich, beeing the sonne of a poore man, and (as I haue often heard) a butcher. He was sent to Oxford very young, and was brought vp there in Magdalene Colledge: being procéeded Master of Arts, he became schoolemaster of the Grammer schoole belonging to that Colledge, where he was first preferred by the Marques Dorset (to whose sons he was Tutor) vnto a benefice in Somersetshire called Limington. There one Sir Amyas Pawlet a knight of that countrey, did him a great disgrace, setting him in the 
                     ••
                  ockes, vpon little or no occasion as I haue heard. Of that iniury the knight much repented him afterward, at what time this poore scholler beeing aduanced to the high honour of Lord Chancellor, not only rebuked him sharply in words, but also made him dance attendance fiue or sixe yeares in London, vntill by great suit hee obtained license of departure. His Lord and Patrone the Marques dying, he saw himselfe without all likelihood of further preferment, especially if he should settle himselfe vpon his Benefice. Leauing it therefore and determining to séeke some better fortune, abroad in the world; hee happened to be entertained of an ancient knight called sir Iohn Naphaunt, who had an office of importance in Callis; wherein (beeing very aged

himselfe) he altogether imployed this Woolsey his chaplaine, vntill such time as weary of it, in regard of his owne weakenesse and impotency, hée gaue it ouer. But mindfull of his Chaplaines good seruice, he neuer left him vntil he had found meanes to make him the kings Chaplaine. Now was hee where he would be. Many times he was wont to say (as I haue heard) if he could once set but one foote in the Court, he would not doubt but attaine what he list. And to speake but the truth, it was not onely his good fortune that exalted him to that wonderful greatnesse, but much deale his owne industrie, and many extraordinary parts in him: He was mar

                  ellous wittie, well learned, faire spoken, and passing cunning in winning the hearts of those whose fauor hee affected. The first thing he endeuored (being now a Courtier) was to make himselfe knowne vnto such as were néerest about the king: and the man be specially followed, was Richard Foxe Bishop of Winchester
                     •
                   vpon whose Councell he saw the king did most relie. Hee soone perceiued what was in Woolsey, and at a time when the king bethought him of some witty fellow to dispatch certains affaires with the Emperor, mentioned him as a fit man. The king vpon his commendation, sent for this chaplaine, and committed the busines vnto him. The Emperor lay then in the Law Countries, whether Master Woolsey made such haste (winde and weather lauouring him) as within lesse then 4. daies after his dispatch, he was backe at the Court againe, hauing ordered all the kings businesses to his contentment. By this time, the king sawe him to be a man meet for imploiment, and determined heereafter to vse him. It was not long then before he preferred him to the Deanry of Lincolne, and a little before his death made him Almoner. That wise and excellent Prince being taken away, he soone crept so farre into the fauor of the young king, by applying himself to his humour; as he possessed him altogether, &amp; in a maner at the first dash was made one of his priuy Counsell. Being very eloquent &amp; well spoken, the rest of the Counsel vsed him many times as their Rese
                     •
                  endary to signifie their determinations vnto the king. He then hauing this opportunity of perceiuing the kings inclinatiō, followed euer

that course which hee saw him willing to haue taken, and aduaunced earnestly that part whereunto the King inclined, without respect vnto the matter otherwise. Againe, whereas the rest of the Counsell called oft vpon the King, to acquaint himselfe with matters of state, by resorting to the Counsell, and affoording his presence at their deliberations
                     •
                   hee would aduise him to follow his pleasures, and let Counsell matters alone to him, assuring him that at night hée should heare as much of him in one quarter of an houre, as if he had beene present all day at those tedious &amp; wearisome consultations. By this trick he won himselfe such authority with the king, as hee did euen what he lift a long time. No maruell now if what preferment soeuer fell, stood at his refusall. The King hauing taken Tourney, and banished the Bishop as addicted vnto the French party, gaue all the reuenues of the Bishopricke vnto him (Woolsey I meane). Within lesse than one yeare after, fell first Lincolne (whereunto hee was preferred the yeare 1514.) and then immediately after Yorke; which also was presently bestowed vpon him. Following the streame still of this good fortune, and thinking it best to take his time, he procured the Pope to make him first his Legate a Latere, and soone after (viz. Sept. 7. 1515) Cardinall. He handled the matter also in such sort with the King, as he was content to discharge the Archbishop of Canterbury from the office of Chauncellor and to bestow it vppon him. Then 
                     •
                  s though the Archbishopricke of Yorke and Chauncellorship of England were not sufficient for maintenance of a Cardinall, hee tooke also vnto him the Bishopricke of Bathe the yeare 1518. holding it and the Abbey of Saint Albons with diuers other ecclesiasticall liuings in Commendam. Fower years, and 7. moneths, hée held Bathe and then resigned it to take Durham. Durham also hee lastly gaue ouer the yeare 1529. in exchange for Winchester. Now you sée him at the highest. It was impossible this greatnesse should be able to beare his owne burthen. Presently after his acceptation of Winchester, he began to fall, and fell so fast, as if death had not happily staid him; hee had quickly fallen from much, to much lesse then nothing. The king vpon a displeasure (how iust God knoweth) discharged him sodainely from

the office of Chauncellour. His goods were all seased to the kings vse, and himselfe ready to hée attaint by Parliament, had not Thomas Cromwell (after Earle of Essex, then his seruant) taken great paines in defending him. When that course succéeded not, he was charged to haue fallen into a Premunire by exercising his power Leganti
                     •
                  e without the kings licence. Héereunto hée answered that hee had authority thereto from the King vnder his broad seale (as it was well enough knowen hée could prooue) though that amongst the rest of his writings were now in the hands of his enemies. But (quoth hée) I will neuer stand vpon that point. Whatsoeuer I haue, I haue it from the king; if it bée his pleasure to haue me in a Premunire, let it be so, I must and will be at his mercy. Almost halfe a yéere hée liued néere London to great penurie; one while at Asher (a house belonging to the Bishopricke of Winchester) and another while at Richmond; the which house, the King had lately giuen him in exchange for Hampton Court All which time, he had scarce a cuppe to drinke in, or a bed to lye in, but what was lent him; for his mooueables and houshold stuffe of inestimable valew, were all taken away to the Kings vse. At last hee was sent downe into Yorkeshire, and there liued all a summer in reasonable good sort. About the beginning of Nouember that yeare, which was 1536. the Earle of Northumberland arrested him of high treason, and tooke order to haue him brought vp to London: but he sel sicke by the way, and died in the Abbey of Leicester, (as it should séeme of a fluxe whereunto a continuall feauer was ioyned) when hée had béene sicke the space of 8. daies, viz. Nouember 29. 1530. hauing béene Archbishop 15. yeares, and being within foure moneths of 60. yeares of age. His last words are said to be these: If I had serued God as diligently as I haue done the king, he would not haue giuen mee ouer in my gray haires; but this is the iust reward that I must receiue for th

                   paines and study that I haue had, to doe him seruice, not regarding my seruice to God, so much as the satisfying of his pleasure. In his flourishing time, hée beganne the building of two most stately Colledges, one at Ipswich, the other at Oxford; and it is great pitty hee finished them not. Had they béne perfected, I thinke they

would haue beene two of the goodliest monuments of the world. And surely it were a wonder that any priuate man should take two such peeces of worke in hand at one time, whereof any one might séeme a great matter for a Prince to finish
                     •
                   had not his receits beene infinite, and his helps otherwise very great. I thinke verily (and am able to yeeld good reason of my surmise) that if one man had now in his hands the reuenues of all the Bishopricks and Deaneries also in England, his rents would not arise to so high a reckoning, as the yeerely receits of this Cardinall. Yet was it not his owne purse that gaue him courage to so great an enterprise: for his bounty was such as hee could not but spend all hee receiued. The number of his seruants daily attending in his house were well néere fower hundred, of which there were one Earle, nine Lords, a great number of Knights and Esquires. I reckon not all this while his seruants seruants, which it is thought grew to a farre greater number. Hee obtained leaue of the Pope to dissolue forty small monasteries; the spoile wherof furnished him principally for the building of his Colledges, but opened a gap withall to king Henry, to destroy all the rest, as soone after hee did. Before the building of this Colledge, he erected in the same Uniuersity seuen Lectures, as namely amongst the rest one for Diuinity read by Th. Brinknell; another for the Mathematikes, by one Lupset, and a third for Law by that famous Lud. Viues, to whom it pleased the King and Quéene to affoord audience, reading in the hall of Corpus Christi Colledge. These and the rest he determined by the aduice of D. Veysey Bishop afterward of Excetex to haue setled together (as Master Twyne deliuereth) in his new Colledge, allowing large stipends for them &amp; their successors for euer, as also maintainance for 200. st

                   in a place where one Sir Francis Askue of Linconshire dwelt, by whom he was much troubled and molested in lawe. Upon occasion of those suits he was faine to repaire to London, where being, he found meanes to become the Kings Chaplaine, and by his fauour obtained first the Bishopricke of Landaffe, and after the Archbishopricke of Yorke, and was appointed President of the Kings Councell for the North. It is remembred (&amp; I thinke it not vnworthy the mentioning) that the Knight before named happened to haue a suite before the Councell there, and doubted much of hard measure from the Archbishop, whose aduersary he had beene. But he remembring the rule of the Gospell, to doe good for euill, yéelded him al fauour that with Iustice he might; saying afterward merrily to his friends, he was much beholding to Sir Francis Askew; for that had not he béene, hée must haue liued an hedge Priest all the daies of his life. In the beginning of Quéen Mary he was committed to the tower, where he lay a yéere and a halfe, and was at last depriued, for being maried (as I take it.)

Soone after, to witte, the yeare 1553. he was translated to Yorke, and vpon the death of Stephen Gardner made L. Chancellor of England.

            THE BISHOPPES OF DVRHAM.
            
               1. Aidanus.
               
                  THe Noble and Uertuous Prince Oswald, hauing attained the kingdome of Northumberland the yéere 634. and desirous that his countrymen and subiects should not onely be gouerned by the sword for their temporall good, but also directed by the word and preaching of the Gospell to the euerlasting saluation of their soules, he sent his Embassador vnto his neighbors the Scots (amongst whom were then many godly &amp; wel learned preachers) requesting them to send vnto him some good man that might instruct his people in the faith and fear of Christ. To this his most reasonable request, they quickly condiscended; &amp; sent vnto him first a man, that doing his best endeauor a while amongst them, &amp; perceiuing he could doe no good, returned shortly into his owne country againe, complaining that they were a barbarous and vntractable people, amongst whom he had béene, and such as he thought he could not spend his time worse, then in seeking to instruct them, that seemed, neither desirous nor capable of

knowledge. They that sent him, very sorry for this tydings, &amp; consulting amongst themselues what course were now to be taken, it chanced one of them named Aidanus to vse these works. It séemeth to me (quoth he) that this our brother dealt somewhat too roughly with his vnlearned Auditors, not féeding them first with the milke of gentle words, and easie doctrine, according to the Councell of the Apostle, vntill such time as they were able to digest stronger meat: And this I take to bee the cause of the ill successe his preaching had amongst them. All the rest of the company thought it very probable which he had sayd, and these his words occasioning them to remember (besides his learning &amp; godlines) his notable discretion and knowen wisedome, they agreed all, that questionles no man was so likely to amend that fault, as he that had so quickly found and discerned it in the other; and so with one consent ordained him Bishop of Northumbers. This Aidanus an humble minded man a louer of silence and pouerty (saith William Malmsbury) auoiding of purpose the pomp &amp; frequencie of Yorke, chose 
                     •
                  or his See a little Island called Lindisfarne (now Holy Island) where he and diuers of his successors much deale lead their liues. He was Bishop seuentéene yéeres, during which time he neglected no duty of a good Pastor, trauelling vp and down the Country euen on foot to preach the Gospel, giuing whatsoeuer he could get vnto the poore, and by the example of his owne abstinency, chastity, sobriety and all manner of Episcopall vertues, instructing, aswell, as by word and doctrine. He departed this life August 31 anno. 651. for griefe (as it is supposed) of the death of King Oswald that was traiterously slaine 12. daies before. Beda maketh report of diuers miracles to bée done by him, which who so desireth to read, shall finde them and many things more concerning him Eccl. hist. lib. 3. c. 3.5.14.15.16. and 17.

                  FInnanus (sent likewise thither out of Scotland) was Bishop of Lindisfarne after Aidan the space of tenne yeares. Hée first built a Church for his Sée in the Island all of Timber, and couered it with réed. Hée had much to doe with one Conan and other about the obseruation of Easter, which they would haue had him to celebrate according to the manner of the Church of Rome. Hée would not be induced by any meanes to any alteration. Hée died the yeare 661.
            
            
               3. Colman.
               HIs successor Colman (a 
                     •
                   Scot also) was no lesse obstinate in the same matter. After many priuate conflicts, the yeare 664. this controuersie was discust in a solemne disputation before the king and all his nobles, who adiudged the victory vnto his aduersaries. The discourse of that disputation is set downe at large by Beda. lib. 3. cap. 25. Colman not induring the disgrace of this foyle, gaue ouer his Bishopricke and returned into Scotland againe.
            
            
               4. Tuda.
               AMongst diuers that came out of Scotland with Colman this Tuda was one, who hauing giuen proofe of his sufficiency for the place, by diligent preaching, and vertuous behauiour vnder Colman, vpon his departure was chosen to succéede him. Hée was content to reforme the obseruation of Easter, and to yéelde to some other things which had béene much stood vpon and controuerted betwéene the Scots and Saxous. Hauing béene Bishop scarce one whole yeare, hee died of the plague anno. 665.

               MAny of the Scots that came with Colman returning with him, the rest chose Eata for their Abbot, and liued at Mailros, which place King Oswyn gaue vnto them at the request of Colman. This Eata after the death of Tuda was chosen Bishop both of Lindisfarne and Hagustald, and gouerned them ioyntly the space of three yeares. After the end of which terme, he gaue ouer Hagustald vnto one Tumbert. But Tumbert being deposed by a Synode gathered at a place called Twiford, Cuthbert was elected vnto his See of Hagustald. Eata then perceiuing that Cuthbert had rather bee at Lindisfarne, tooke on him once more the gouernment of Hagustald, and resigned Lindisfarne vnto Cuthbert. This was the yeare 684. The yeare following it seemeth Eata died. For I find that one Iohn was then consecrate Bishop of Hagustald, after whom succeeded (to note that by the way).

Hector Boethius writeth hee was sometimes Bishop of Candida casa. After him succeeded in the foresaid Bishopricke of Hagustald these that follow.

               6 Saint Cuthbert.
               THis Cuthbert is said to be descended of the bloud royall of the kings of Ireland, being sonne of one Muriardach, and Sabina his wife, that was daughter vnto a king there. He was brought vp in the Abbey of Mailros, first vnder his predecessor Eata, and afterwards vnder Boisill, that succeeded Eata. After the death of Boisill, hee was made Abbot of that monastery, which hee ruled with great care and sincerity. And not content to looke vnto those onely, the gouernement of whom was especially committed vnto him; Hee vsed often to trauell into the country neere adioyning, sometimes on horsebacke, sometimes on soote, preaching diligently the worde of God, instructing the ignorant in the way of life, and sharply reprehending vice where hee saw cause. And his manner was to frequent especially, the most rude and barbarous places, to which hee thought no body else would resort, least the people there beeing altogether neglected, might perish for want of their spirituall foode. He was a very personable man, well spoken, and so mighty in perswading, as none that ouer he dealt withal was able to withstand the force of his words. Hauing continued this manner of life at Mailros many yeeres, at the importunate request of his old master Eata, he was content to leaue the place and to liue once more vnder him at Lindisfarne. But affecting much an Eremeticall and solitary life, he refused to liue with the rest of the monkes, and seated himselfe in the Island of Farne, a desert place 9. miles within the sea, hauing in it neither house nor water. Yet there hee made a shift to liue, labouring with his owne hands till he was chosen Bishop. A great while hee refused obstinately to forsake his solitary life, euen vntill the king himselfe comming ouer vnto him partly by force, &amp; partly by intreaty, induced him thereunto. So with much adoo he accepted consecration at last, and receiued the same at Yorke vpon Easter day, at the hand of Theodore Archbishop of Canterbury (6. other Bishops assisting him) the yeare 684. in the presence of king Egfride, and many of his nobles. After he had beene Bishop two yeares, he would needs resigne,

and returned to this Island againe, where soone after hee ended his life. The day of his departure (to wit March 20.) is consecrate vnto his memory. He was first buried at Lindisfarne, but afterwards remooued to Durham as hereafter shall be declared. The miracles that are ascribed vnto him and many ot

                     •
                   with réede) but the walls also, which were then of timber. He sate 10. yeares, and dying May the 6. 698. was buried beside, or rather vnder Saint Cuthbert his predecessor, whose body the monkes had now placed in a shryne aboue the pauement of the Church.

To him Beda writte a sharpe Epistle, reprehending him for remissenesse and carelesnes of his charge; which hee taking in good part, framed himselfe to some better diligence and besides some other writing, translated diuers parts of the Bible into the English or Saxon tongue. He died 721.

                  HIgbald sate twelue yéeres, and died anno 803. In his time the Danes often spoiled the Church and Monastery of Lindisfarne, so as the Bishop and Monks were faine to forsake it. Taking therefore the body of Saint Cutbert with them, they determined to seate themselues in Ireland, but being often driuen backe by tempest, so as attempting diuers times to crosse the seas, they could neuer land there, they gaue ouer that enterprise, and rested themselues, sometimes in one place, sometimes in an other, during the time of all these Bishops.

The yéere 995 (or néere thereabout, hee came to Durham, or rather (for so is the right name) Dunholme, which is compounded of two Saxon words, Dun, signifying a hill, and Holme an Island in a riuer. Before his comming thither it was a place wilde and not habitable beeing all a wood, full of thicke bushes and trées, sauing onely a little plaine vpon the top of the hill, that was wont to b

All the people, dwelling betwéene the riuers of Theise and Coqued, came then &amp; afforded most readily their best help vnto the building of a church there, neuer ceasing vntill in the time of this Bishop (who principally caused the same) it was quite finished. Hée was Schoolemaster vnto the children of K. Ethelred, Elfred, &amp; Edward that after raigned, and is commonly called Edward the Confessor. The king their father being driuen out of his kingdome by Swanus the Dane, the yeare 1013. he sent him with Emma his wife and his two sonnes before named vnto Richard Duke of Normandy their vncle. How soone the Bishop returned I know not, but I find that hee died within thrée yeeres after, to wit, the year 1017. hauing continued Bishop almost nine and twenty yéeres.

               THrée yéeres after the death of Aldwine the Sée remained void; by reason of the great troubles and continuall warres wherewith the Realme was vexed by the Daues. At the last, God sending a more peaceable time, the

Clergy of Durham determined to procéede vnto an election. As they were conferring about the businesse they had in hand it happened a certaine graue Priest to come into the place where they were gathered together, (and vnderstanding what they were about) to say merily vnto them, that they were best choose him. These words vsed by him in

Matthew Westminster addeth, (credite him as you list) that the Monks fasting thrée dayes &amp; praying vnto Saint Cuthbert to shew some token of his approbation or dislike of this election; there was a voyce heard out of his shrine (the Priest being at Masse) that thrée times named Edmund to the Bishopricke. He was elected the yéere 1020. but not consecrate in fiue yéeres after. He sate after the time of his consecration 23. yéeres, and dying of Glocester, anno 1048. was carried thence to his owne Church of Durham

Malmsbury) by continuall fasting and abundance of teares, washing away the guilt of his former misdeedes, he wanne vnto himselfe such reputation of holines as the place of his burial was much frequented after his death He died October 15. 1072. and (if I mistake him not for his brother, as many of our Writers doe, who confound the history of these men, and attribute diuers actions of the o

               THis Egelwyn was Bishoppe at the comming in of the Conquerour, against whom hee alwayes opposed himselfe. At the last séeing himselfe not able to withstand him, and fearing to bée too neare him, he forsooke Durham in the end of the yeare 1069, and carried his Clergy with him vnto the Church of Lindisfarne. But it was not long before they returned againe. The King hauing withdrawne his forces out of that Country, and the Bishop (belike) being taken into fauour, about the beginning of Lent the Church was furnished againe and the Bishop himselfe entred the same, April 6. within two yéeres after which time, whether it were the ancient hatred hee bore vnto the king that now reboiled in his stomacke, or a vaine hope of recouering the liberty of his country enthralled vnto the Normans, or offence taken at the unreasonable oppression of the same, and especially of Clergy men (as Stigand and diuers other that were depriued

of their Bishoprickes and other promotions): he ioyned with certaine English Noble men, in a flat rebellion, alledging at first that they feared imprisonment and hard measure, but indéed purposing to depose the king, &amp; set vp some Englishman. When things succéeded not according to their expectation, they were fain to hide themselues in woods and secret places, doing great spoile in the Country, till at last they tooke the Ile of Ely, which they defended against the Kings power a long space. In the meane time Egelwyn our Bishop tooke ship and departed (as Mat. Westminster sayth) into voluntary exile. But William Malmsbury chargeth him with piracy and robbery vpon the sea. He set his course, (as Stubs saith for Colon, but was forced by contrary winds to land in Scotland. Thence returning againe to Ely, in th

Wigorn deliuereth) for griefe and anger to take any sustenance: Howbeit other thinke his abstinence was of constraint, and that he gladly would haue eaten if he could haue gotten meate. It is said he was buried in Saint Nicholas Chappell at Westminster. But I thinke him mistaken in that point for his brother Agelricke.

He bought of the king the Earledome of Northumberland, and then making himselfe a secular Iudge, tooke vpon him to sit in the Court, and to determine all causes at his pleasure, dealing withal very corruptly, and taking still the course that might be most for his owne gaine. Hereupon he greatly enriched his coffers, but purchased vnto him selfe extreame hatred amongst the common people, which was his destruction in the end. There was a certaine gentleman of great account named Leulfus that married Algitha
                  
the daughter of Aldred sometime Earle of Northumbe
                     •
                  land, from whom the Lord Lumly that now liueth is lineally descended This Leulfus, to the end he might liue néer the Church in his latter time, and for very deuotion, came to Durham to dwell there, and kept company very much with the Bishop, who loued him entirely, for many good parts he saw in him, as namely, his wisedome in discerning, his equity in deciding, and his discretion in ordering and handling such causes as he committed vnto him; in which respect also he vsed him very familiarly, imployed him often, and gaue him what countenance he could. Now you shall vnderstand, that vnto the same Bishop belonged two men, vnto whom for the most part he committed the ordering of all his affaires; Leofwyn or Leobwyn his chaplaine whom hée trusted with all houshold matters, and Gilbert a kinsman of his owne that dealt in his causes of temporall gouernment. In these offices they behaued themselues so; as the Bishop had cause to commend their diligence, but to blame their rashnes and wilfulnes in many things. Which notwithstanding, he bare withall, either because their industry and care of his affaires, so blinded his eyes as he could not espy their misbehauiour otherwise, or else being loath to deiect them whom he had once aduanced, These men, and especially Leofwyn did greatly enuy the credite that Leulfus had gotten with the Bishop, and euery where opposed themselues against him, not onely in wordes, traducing his actions, but in deedes, also still thwarting and crossing his endeauours. Whereby it came to passe, that many iarres fell out between them. One day amongst the rest, a court being held in the presence of the Bishop, Leofwyn or Leobwyn (for so also I finde him called) according vnto his wonted manner, gaue Leulfus ill spéeches, which he not enduring to heare as heertofore he had done (furor sit saepius laesa patientia) answerd this salvey Chaplaine somewhat more roundly then hee had accustomed. Whereupon hee rose straight from the Court in great indignation (Leofwyn I meane) and calling Gilbert aside, with little adoe perswaded him to carry a certain number of armed men to the house where Leulfus lay, and in a night to kill him; which indéede hée performed with great

cruelty, murthering not onely the innocent gentleman himselfe, but also his seruants and whole houshold. The newes of this horrible and outragious cruelty, comming vnto the eares of the Bishop, amased him very much and suspecting it was done by the aduice of Leofwyn, turning him about vnto him. O Leofwyn saith he, thou hast already 
                     •
                  laine me by thy tongue. So not doubting it would breed much danger vnto him, he got him into his Castle, and presently dispatched messengers vnto the friends and kindred of Leulfus that was slaine; protesting that the fact was committed without his knowledge that he was maruellous sorry for it, and if any man suspected him, would be ready to submit himselfe to any order of law, whereby hee might cleare himselfe. Herewith they séemed to be satisfied; but for conclusion of a firme peace amongst them, it was thought sit they should meet and confer of the matter. They met at a place called Goates-head. The Bishop for his better safegard betooke himselfe vnto the Church with his company. The people (whereof an infinite number were gathered together) abode without. Messages a while passed betweene them, but the more the matter was debated (being very odious of itself) the more the people were incensed. At last it was told them how not only Leofwin but also Gilbert had been harboured in the Bishops house and affoorded countenance of him since the murther: which being once heard (and it was true enough) they all cried out, it was manifest that the Bishop was ye author of this fact. It is furthermore deliuered by Matthew Paris, that the Bishop not long before this, amongst many intollerable exactions layd vpon the Countrey by him, had commanded the summe of 400. l. to be leuied at this time That being also remembred, while as all the company stood in a mammering, doubting what course to take, one of some speciall regard among them stept vp, vsing these words, Short read, good read, slay ye the Bishop. Heereupon without more adoe they ran all vnto the Church, killed so many of the Bishops retinue as they found without doores, and with horrible noise and out cries bid him and his company to come out vnto them. Too late then hee repented that he had committed himselfe vnto the fury of adiscontented

multitude, with whom hee knew himselfe before that time nothing gracious. But to make the best of a badde match, and to try all meanes of ridding himselfe from the danger eminent, hee perswaded his kinsman Gilbert there present to goe foorth vnto them, if happily his death (which doubtlesse hée had well deserued) might satisfie their

                  y, and purchase safely vnto his Lord and Master. Gilbert was content, and issuing out, with diuers of the Bishops company, were all slaine except onely two English men seruants vnto the Bishop (all the rest were Normans) They being not yet pacified, he besought Leofwin (whose life he knew well was principally sought) to goe out also. But he vtterly re

and fetched away the Bishops body (which they found starke naked) and could hardly know it for the multitude of wounds; they carried it to their Monastery, from whence it was conuaied to Durham, and there buried on the south side of the Chapterhouse, but secretly for feare of the murtherers that roued vp and downe the Towne, and once assaulted the Castell: when they could not preuaile there, they dispersed themselues, and for thr most parte came to euill and vnhappy ends. The King in the mean time hearing of this tumult, sent his brother Odo Bishoppe of Bayon; with many of his Nobles, and a great army to take punishment of this murther

At this time the surnamed Odo tooke away from the Church of Durham certaine ornaments of great value, amongst which is especially remembred a certaine Crosser of inestimable price. In this Bishops dayes and by his endeauour, secular Clerks were displaced, and the Church of Durham replenished with Monks; the Pope, the King, and the Archbishop allowing this alteration.

                   Ianuary 3. following at Glocester, the King and almost all the Bishops of the Realme being present at that solemnity. The monks (whom he sauoured much, for hee expelled diuers married priests out of his Church of Durham, whom Walter was content to beare withall, and suffered onely Monkes there) they prayse him for a man of great wisdome, learning and vertue. Certaine it is, that he was very subtle, whereby (as also by the volubilitie of his tongue, which hée had passing ready at commandement) hée got very farre into the fauour of the king William the Conquerour, and afterward of his sonne William Rufus, vnder whom hée did euen what he list. Unto the latter of these hée prooued very vnthankefull, ioyning himselfe with Odo Bishoppe of Bayon in a rebellious conspiracy against him. The Rebels béeing ouerthrowne, he was faine for his safeguard to shut himselfe vp within the walles of Durham. The king hasting thither by greatiournies, besieged him, and after a short time had the towne yeelded by composition, wherein it was conditioned, that the Bishop and his company should depart in safety. So he got him beyond the seas, and liued in exile three yéeres, viz. vntill September 11. 1090. at what time the King comming to Durham, receyued him to grace, and restored him to his former dignity, that very day three yeares that he departed thence. After that time hée omitted nothing, whereby hée might curry fauour with the King, euer applying himselfe that way whither hée saw him to encline. In all the broile betwéen the king and Anselme, hée was the chiefe stirrer against the Archbishoppe, hoping belike, so to assure himselfe of the Kings fauour, and if Anselme should be displaced (which hée endeuoured) hee thought no man so likely then to succéede him as himselfe. But hée failed in both of these purposes; for the kings displeasure was his death. He was summoned to appeare before the King at Glocester, at a day, before which time (for griefe as it is thought) hée fell sicke. When hée appeared not, and it was tolde the king hée was sicke: he sware by Lukes face (that was his vsuall oath) he lied, hée did but counterfeit, and hée would haue him fetcht with a

vengeance. It appeared the excuse was true inough; for soone after; viz. the second of Ianuary, 1095. he died at Windsor, hauing beene Bishop 15. yéeres. This man pulling downe to the ground the Church of Durham, that Aldwinus had first built, began to erect another farre more magnificent but liued not to finish it. Himselfe Malcolme K. of Scots, and Turgot Prior of Durham, laied the first thrée stones, Iuly 30. or (as some deliuer, Aug. 11.) 1093. It is said, that lying vpon his death bed, and thought to be past memory (if not dead) diuers Prelates that were in his Chamber, conferred about the order of his funerals, and amongst other things appointed the place of his buriall to bée in the church vpon the building whereof hée had bestowed so much. The supposed dead man euerheard them, and gathering his forces together, made shift to breath out these wordes: God forbid (saith hée) that by my buriall you should preiudice the honor of Saint Cutbert, for reuerence of whome, neuer any of my predecessors would endure to bée laide there. Bury you me therefore in the Chapter house. It was performed accordingly: his body was conueighed from Glocester, where he died, vnto Durham, and on the North part of the chapter-house there solemnely interred ouer against Bishoppe Walcher, Turgott Bishoppe of Saint Andrewes in Scotland, and sometimes Prior of Durham, lying in the middle Isle betwéene them. Within a yeare or two after his first beeing Bishoppe, hée trauelled to Rome, and obtayned there licence of Pope Gregory the seuenth to bring the Monkes from Yarrow and Wermouth into the Cathedrall Church of Durham. Hée also bestowed vpon them, not onely Bookes and diuers Ornaments for the furnishing of their Church, but Landes and Reuenewes in sundry places: for the confirmation of all which gifts hée procured the Charter of William the Conquerour vnder Seale.

The King at last bestowed it vpon one Ranulf, rather for the seruice hée had done him, then for any speciall seruice he could hope hée would doo, eyther to God or his Church. For hée was a very wicked man, but such a one as had serued his turne notably: yet it is said the king was content to take of him a thousand poundes to inuest him in this Bishopricke. Hee was first Chaplaine vnto Maurice Bishoppe of London, of wel fauoured of him, but not so wel as that he would let him haue the Deanry falling voide, which he taking very ill, in a chafe left him, and (by what meanes I know not,) woonde himselfe into the Court. Béeing passing subtle and shrewde witted, faire spoken, and nothing scrupulous, but ready to do any thing for preferment; It was no hard matter for him to obtaine any thing of the King (William Rufus) a very corrupt and vicious Prince. His first praise was, to f

                  rme the vacācies of Abbotships &amp; Bishoprickes of the king, wherby he not onely enriched himselfe, but brought great summes of mony into the kings coffers that neuer were acquainted with that kinde of profite before. The king perceyuing him to be a 
                     •
                  it instrument for his purposes, imployed him dayly more and more, and at last made him chiefe gouernour of all his realm vnder him, so as hee had all that authority which now the Lord Treasurer, Chancellour, and diuers other officers haue diuided amongst them. For it seemes vnto me, that few of those offices were then so precisely distinguished, as soone after. This authority he abused very impudently, not caring whom hée offended, so he might enrich eyther the king or himselfe. Many times when the King gaue commandement for the leuying of a certaine summe of money amongst his subiects, he would require of the Commons twice so much, wherat the king being very well content, would laugh, and say that Ranulf was the onely man for his turne, who cared not whom he displeased, so he might please his master. It was impossible, but he should be very odious, both vnto the common

people and nobility also. And no maruell if many complaints were made vnto the King of him, against all which he shut his eares obstinately. When therefore that way succéeded not, some of those his discontented aduersaries determined to wreak their malice vpon him by killing him. They fained a message from the Bishop of London his old Master saying that he was very sicke and ready to depart the world, that he was wonderfull desirous to speake with him, and to the end he might make the better spéede, had sent him a barge to conueigh him vnto his house being then by the water side. He suspecting no fraud, went with them in great haft, attended onely by his Secretary, and some one or two other; they hauing him thus in their clutches, carried him not to the appoynted staires, but rowed still on (say what he would) till they came vnto a ship prouided for him, ready to set saile. As soon as he perceiued how he was entrapped, he cast away his ring or manuell seale, and after his great Seale (whether the broad Seale of England or no, I know not) into the riuer, least they might giue opportunity of forging false graunts and conueyances. Then he fell to intreating and perswading but all to no purpose, for they were determined he should dy, They had appointed two Mariners to dispatch him, either by knocking out his braines, or heauing him aliue ouer boorde, for doing whereof they were promised to haue his clothes. These executioners could not agrée vpon the diuision of this reward, for his gowne was better worth then all the rest of his apparell. While they were reasoning vpon that point, it pleased God to raise a terrible and fearefull tempest, such as they looked euery minute to die themselues, and therfore had no very good leasure to thinke of putting another man to death. Ranulf then omitting no opportunity of his deliuerance, like another Arion, by the musicke of his eloquence séeketh to alay their malice, and to disswade them from the execution of their bloody determination, laying diligentlie before them, the danger that was like to ensue vnto them by so cruell a murther which could not be hid, promising mountaines of gold if they saued his life; and lastly wishing them to consider, how God by raising this tempest, had threatned to reuenge his death, and had as it were set the image of his

vengeance before their eyes. Whether it were the feare of God or of man, or else the hope of reward that wrought with them, of such effect were these his perswasions, as first diuers of the company refused to be partakers of his murther; one of them then stept forth, &amp; vowed to defend him to his power, so as he would liue or die with him. And at length, his greatest enemies were so pacified, as Girald the authour of this conspiracy, was content to set him a land, and to conduct him to his owne house. But not trusting a reconciled foe, as soon as he had so done, he got him out of the realme, and durst neuer come in England after. So by one danger this man escaped another, and might wel say as Themistocles, when banished his country, he found better entertainment of his enemy the King of Persia, then he could haue giuen himselfe at home, Perijssem nisi perijssem, I had indéede béene vtterly vndone, had I not beene vpon the point to be vndone. Soone after his returne from this braue voyage, to wit, Iune 5. 1099. he was consecrate Bishop of Durham, in the Cathedrall Church of Saint Paul. He was scarse warme in his seate, when his Master the king beeing slaine by the glance of an arrow, as he was hunting, Henry his brother succeeded in the kingdome. This Prince not able to withstand the importunity of his Nobles, and the innumerable complaintes daily made against this our Bishoppe, clapt him vp in the Tower: But he so enchanted his kéepers with money and faire words, as they were content to let him goe, and to run away with him themselues. William of Malmesbury saith that he procured a Water-bearer, in his Tankerd to bring him a rope, by which hee slid downe from the wall to the ground, and so (although he hurt his arme, and galled his hands, to the bone) away hee escaped, getting himselfe into Normandy, where he arriued in the beginning of February 1101. There he neuer linne buzzing into the eares of Robert Duke of Normandy, telling him the kingdome of England was his by right, till hee pro

Hee raised the walles of the Body of his Church vnto the roofe, he translated the reliques of Saint Cuthbert into the new Church, and bestowed a shrine vpon him, hee compassed the City with a wall, he caused a number of houses to be pulled down that were néere the Church, and might haue béene either noysome vnto it, or dangerous by fire hapning among them: he continued diuers bankes along the riuer of Wers, with great charge he built the Castle of Norham vpon a stéepe hill néere the riuer of Twéed, the hospitall of Kepar, and the bridge of Frammoldgate. He was the first Founder of the Priory at Mottes

                  HVgh Pusar, Pudsey, or de Puteaco (for thus diuersly I find him called) Treasurer of Yorke and Archdeacon of Winchester, was elected vnto this Sée of Durham after the death of the foresaid William, rather in respect of his nobility and greatnesse of bloud, then of any speciall worthinesse otherwise. For king Stephen was vncle vnto him. Hée was very wise in ordering of temporall matters, and (considering hee was not learned) wonderfull eloquent, exceeding couetous, and as cunning in gathering money, as thirstie and desirous of it. Henry Murdac Archbishop of Yorke, not only refused to consecrate him himselfe, taking exceptions both against his want of yeeres and lightnes of behauiour, but also sent to Rome to haue a Caueat layd in against him there. Eugenius was Pope at that time, an old acquaintance of the Archbishops, who both were brought vp at Clarenall vnder S. Bernard. But such was the good hap of this new elect, as a little before his arriuall there, (I meane at Rome) Pope Eugenius was dead, and soone after came certain newes thither of the death of the Archbishop also. Anastasius that succeeded Eugenius, without much adoe affoorded him consecration, Dec. 30. 1153.

                   built two hospitals, one at Allerton, another called Sherburne at the east end of Durham.

Neubrigensis ascribeth this good worke, partly vnto other men, whom he enforced to become benefactors vnto this foundation, being loath to be at the whole charge himselfe. At what time King Richard made prouision for his iourny into the Holy land, he also tooke on

him the crosse, and vowed to be one of that company. The King vnderstanding that hee had prepared a great masse of money to carry with him, perswaded him to stay at home, and to af

                  oord him his money; which if he would doe, hee promised to make him Earle of Northumberland. The Bishop long since repenting the vow he had made, quickly condiscended to his offer, &amp; accepted the same. The King hauing created him an Earle, turned him about vnto the company, and laughing, sayd, hee had performed a wonderfull exploit; for (quoth he) of an old Bishop I haue made a yoong Earle. Now that he might haue some colourable excuse of not performing his how, he caused the King to alledge that he might not bee spared out of the realme in his absence: and to make this the more probable, giuing the king 1000. markes, he perswaded him with that kind of golden Rhetoricke to make him chiefe Iustice of England. The like Rhetorick it was that induced the Pope to dispence with his vow, vnto which the excuses before alledged made som way, but could neuer haue effected the busines without that helpe. At the returne of K. Richard from Hierusalem; he found him not so fauorable as he expected, and thinking that he grudged him his Earldome, resigned the same into his hands. After which, notwithstanding he loded him sore with many gréeuous exactions, wel knowing the Bishops bags to be notably stuft, for that he had offered him a great sum of mony for the redemption of his Earldome. The king therefore being beyond the seas, sent vnto him for his money as condiscending to his request. But the old Fo

Whereupon the king that knew how to vse him in his kind, writ letters vnto him full of reuerent and gracious spéeches, wishing him to bring vp his money to London, and there to receiue the gouernment of the whole realme which he would commit vnto him, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Being very ioyfull of this fauour, toward London he comes about Shrouetyde. Thinking then to take his farewell of flesh, hee surffeted vpon the way at Doncaster, and finding himselfe sicke, returned home to Houeden by boate where hee died March 3.

Being yet Treasurer of Yorke he begot thrée bastards, all sonnes; the first, borne of a gentlewoman of great blood, became a soldier; the second he made Archdeacon of Durham, and loaded him with many other ecclesiastical promotions, which he enioying but one yéere after his Fathers death, was also taken away himselfe. The third (whom the old Bishop loued most tenderly of all) by his Fathers great suit and no lesse expence, became Chauncellor to the French king.

The Couent thinking him vnworthy so high a preferment, chose one William Scot, Archdeacon of Worceter, a graue learned man, and the kings Chaplaine: Howbeit the king offended that his desire was not satisfied, refused in great displeasure to ratifie this election. And vnderstanding that they sent vnto Rome to intreate the Pope to put him in possession of that Sée; hée sent likewise his Ambassadors, the Bishop of Lichfield and the Prior of Lanthony to crosse and hinder that designement, which they easily performed. Within a yeare or two after, they chose (with the Kings good liking) Richard Poore Bishop of Salisbury, a notable man. He was first Deane of Salisbury, consecrate Bishop of Chichester the yéere 1215. translated thence to Salisbury 1217. and lastly to Durham 1228. Being Bishop of Chichester, he purchased vnto that Church Amport which he bought of the Church of Winchester. At Salisbury he is famous for remoouing his Sée from old Salisbury, to new Salisbury, where hee began the building of that stately Church. Sée more of him in Salisbury. He founded

a monastery of Nunnes called the Charnell at Tharent in Wiltshire, and gaue it vnto the Quéene, who chose that for the place of her buriall. Hée builded also an Hospitall for poore people, néere the Colledge of Uaulx in Salisbury. Comming to Durham, he had enough to doe to pay the huge debt of 40000. markes that Richard de Marisco left the landes of his Sée bound for. Hée was a man of rare learning in those times, and of notable integrity for his life and conuersation. A little before his death perceiuing his end to draw néere, hée caused the people to be called together, and going vp into the pulpit, made a very godly spéech vnto them, desiring them to marke well that his exhortation, for hee was now shortly to be taken from them. The next day he did the like, and bidding them farewell, prayed them if he had offended any to forgiue him and to pray for him. The third day he sent for all his particular acquaintance, called all his family and seruants before him, and distributed vnto them presently by hand, such summes of money as either hee ought, or was willing to bestow vpon them: which done, and hauing set euery thing in perfect order, hée tooke his leaue of his friends one after an other: and then falling to his prayers, when he came vnto these words (saith M. Paris) In pace in id ipsum dormiam &amp; requiescam, hée gaue vp the ghost. Hee died Aprill 15. 1237. and was buried in the Nunnery of Tharent which hee had founded.

A long time the monkes had laboured this sute for their Prior, and had spent much money in it. At last, perceiuing they stroue against the streame, they gaue it ouer, the elect himselfe himselfe first yéelding. Then chose they Nicholas de Farnham, one greatlie commended both for his manners and learning. This man spent his younger yéeres in Oxford, and hauing furnished himselfe there, with the grounds of all good learning especially Logike, and naturall Philosophy; hee trauelled beyond

the seas, and studied Phisicke at Paris and Bo

By the counsell of Otto the Legate, the Bishop of Carlile and other, the King entertained this man into his seruice, And first he was (as it séemeth vnto me) Esquire of his body, (custos corporis regij saith Matthew Paris,) then Physition to the Queene, and (she beeing yet very yoong) her instructer or directer in matters of manners and behauiour.

Which notwithstanding, he persisted in his former determination, telling them that he felt the burthen already so heauy of a Benefice or two which he had, as he was resolued neuer to accept any greater charge of soules.

In this mind he continued, till Robert Grosthead (that famous Bishop of Lincolne) reprehended him sharply for this his backwardnesse. Seest thou not (quoth he) how the monkes of

Durham, destitute of that comfort which a good pastor should yeeld them, intreat thee with teares to affoord the same vnto them, knowing well that if thou accept not the place, the King will immediatly thrust in some vnwoorthy stranger to their great greefe, and the no lesse dishonor of Almighty God? I adiure thee therefore by the bloud of Iesus Christ, that thou bee content to put thy necke vnder this yoke, and to imploy thy talent according to the occasion offered. Perswaded thus, with much ado

The K. very readily allowing their choice, hee was consecrate at Glocester, in the church of Saint Oswald, by the Archbishop of Yorke, Iune 9. 1241. in the presence of the K. Quéene, many Prelates, and other personages of honor. Hee was not more vnwilling to take this honourable burthen then ready and desirous to leaue the same. The yeare 1249. he obtained licence of the Pope to resigne this his Bishopricke, and about Candlemasse indéede gaue it ouer; reseruing onely vnto himselfe for his maintenance during his life, thrée Mannors, with the appurtenances, Houeden, Stocton, and Ensington. His successor began a little to wrangle with him about that reseruation, but could not infringe it. After hee had liued a priuate life the space of 8. yeares, giuing himselfe altogether to prayer and contemplation, about the beginning of February 1275. hée departed this world at Stocton. He that is desirous to reade more of this man in Matthew Paris hee shall find often mention of him, viz pag. 768. where he tells how by his meanes especially the K. was content to receiue into fauor Walter Marshall, and to giue him the Earldome of his brother lately deceased; againe, pag. 988. hee maketh a large report of a great controuersie betweene him and the Abbot of Saint Albones; and lastly pag. 847. an incredible tale of his miraculous recouery, being desperately sick of a dropsie ioined with other diseases.

They would in no sort condiscend to this request; but told him plainely (yet in as good tearmes as they could deuise) how that his brother was such a one, as they could not with a safe conscience commit so great a charge vnto him, beeing as yet very young and not indued with any competency of learning. The King answered, that hée would kéepe the temporalties eight or nine yeares in his hands, and by that time (quoth hée) hée will be old enough. He was not as good as his word; for I finde that one Walter de Kirkham was cons. the yéere following, held that place almost 11. yeares; and died in the moneth of August 1260.

                  RObert Stitchell Prior of Finkhall succéeded, and had restitution of his temporalties. Decem. 5. anno R. Henr. 3.45. Hée founded the Hospitall of Gritham, valued in the kings bookes at 97. pound, fixe shillings, thrée pence halfepennie. The king had seased vpon all the lands of Simon Mountford Earle of Leicester wheresoeuer. But whereas hée had something of good value in the Bishopricke of Durham, this Bishop chalenged it as eue vnto him by the Earles attainder, and at last recouering it from the King by law, imployed it in the erection of that hospitall. He sate fowertéene yéeres, and died August 4. 1274.

               41 Anthony Beake.
               BEfore the ende of that yeare,1283. Edw. 1.11. it séemeth Antony Beake was inuested in the Bishopricke of Durham, in which he so flourished, as (Cardinall Woolsey excepted) neuer I thinke any either of his predecessors or successors came néere him. He was wonderfull rich, not onely in ready money, but in lands also and temporall reuenues: For hee might dispend yéerely (besides that which belonged to his Myter) 5000. markes. Much of that he had of the Lord Ve
                        ••
                     y, who thinking so to conueigh it vnto his base sonne William (for that he had no other issue) passed it ouer to this Bishop in trust; which trust men say hee neuer answered. The Kings house at Eltham was part of that land. He built the house and gaue it vnto Elianor Quéene to King Edward the first, as also vnto the king the Castle of Sourton beside Yorke, which likewise he built. A man now of this extraordinary wealth must not content himselfe with ordinary titles: Therfore hee procured the Pope to make him Patriarke of Hierusalem, and obtained of the King the principality of the Isle of Man, which hée held during his life. The yeare 1294. beeing Embassador to the Emperor, the Archbishop of Yorke Iohn Roman (vpon what quarrell I know not) excommunicated him. It cost the Archb. 4000. markes fine and his life in the end. Hee died (as it is said for thought.) Sée more in Yorke. Great sturres there were betwéene this man and his Couent of Durham. He informed the Pope that the Prior there was a very simple and vnsufficient man to rule that house, and procured the gouernment thereof for all matters both spirituall and temporall to be committed vnto him. Héereupon he sent certaine officers to execute in his name that new obtained authority, which when they came to the monastery, were shut out of the gates and not suffered to enter. The Monkes appealed vnto the Pope, and alleadged, that the king also had required the hearing of these controuersies betwéen the Prior and the Bishop. This notwithstanding the Bishops officers made no more adoo, but excommunicated Prior, Monkes, and all, for not obeying their authority immediately. Herewith the king

greatly offended, caused these officers to be fined, and summoned the Bishoppe himselfe to appeare before him at a day appointed; before which time he gotte him to Rome, neuer acquainting the King with his determination. The King therefore seized into his hand the Bishoppes liberties, and appointed a new Chauncellor, new Iustices and other officers. He writ also vnto the Pope, in fauor of the Prior, who deliuering the kings letters himselfe, was adiudged a sober and discréete man, whatsoeuer the Bishop had reported of him. So hée was restored to his place againe, but died before hée could get home. During the time of the Bishops disgrace, amongst many other things wherein the liberties of the Bishopricke were infringed, it is specially to be remembred, that the king tooke from him diuers Castles, and lands forfait vnto him by Iohn Bayliol king of the Scots and other, (to wit Werk in Tiuidale, Perith and the Church of Simondbury, but Lewis Beaumont one of his successors recouered them againe by Law. These broyles ended, hee gaue himselfe very much to building. The ancient mannor place at Aukland hee did encastellate. Hee built the great hall there (in which are diuers pillers of blacke marble speckled with white) the great chamber likewise, &amp; many other roomes adioyning. He also erected that same goodly. Chappell there; and placed in the same a Deane and Prebendaries, allotting the quadrant in the West side of the Castle (built likewise by him) for their habitation. Hée built or repaired with great charges Barnard Castle, the Castles of Alnwike (part of the L. Vessyes lan

                  , which he sold afterward to H. Piercy) Gainfoorth, Cuncliff, Somerton, (which he gaue vnto the king) and the house at Eltham bestowed (as aforesaid) vpon the Quéene. Hee founded the priory of Aluingham in Linconshire, valued at the suppression, 141.15. s. yearely reuenue. And lastly, hee procured with great charge William sometimes Archbishop of Yorke to be Canonised a Saint at Rome. Hauing sate Bishop of Durham 28. yéeres, hee deceased at Eltham: March 28. 1311. and was buried in his owne Cathedrall Church. I finde it reported that he should haue founded a Colledge for a Deane and 7. prebendaries at Chester vpon the stréet which séemeth to be mistaken.

                  RIchard Kellow sate Bishop fiue yeares,1311 Edw. 2.5. in which short space he bestowed very much in building at Middleham, Storton, and Welhall. He died the yéere 1316.
            
            
               43 Lewes Beaumont.
               THe Couent then chose for their Bishoppe Henry Stamford,
                  1317 Edw. 2.11. Pryor of Finchall, and sent him to Rome to bée confirmed by the Pope. But before he could get thither, at the importunate suit of the kings of England and France, the Pope had giuen that Bishopricke vnto one Lewis Beaumont, a French man borne, and of the bloud royall there. Hee was 
                     •
                  ame of both his legges, and so vnlearned, that he could not read the bulles and other instruments of his consecration. When hee should haue pronounced this worde (Metropoliticae) not knowing what to make of it (though he had studied vpon it and laboured his lesson long before) after a little pause, Soyt purdit (saies he) let it goe for reade, and so passed it ouer. In like sort hee stumbled at in aenigmate.) When hee had fumbled about it a while, Par Saint Lowys (quoth he) iln'est pas curtois quiceste parolle ici escrit, that is, by Saint Lewis it was vngently done of him that writte this word heere. Not without great cause therefore the Pope was somewhat strait laced in admitting him. Hée obtained consecration so hardly, as in fowertéene yéers hée could scarce créepe out of dept. Riding to Durham to bée installed there, hée was robbed (together with two Cardinalls that were then in his company) vpon Wiglesden Moore néere Derlington. The captaines of this rout were named Gilbert Middleton and Walter Selby. Not content to take all the treasur
                     •
                   of the Cardinals, the Bishop, and their traine, they carried the Bishop prisoner to Morpeth, where they constrained him to pay a great ransom. Gilbert Middleton was soone after taken at his owne castle of Nitford, carried to London, and there drawen and hanged in the presence

of the Cardinals. After this, one Sir Goseline Deinuill and his brother Robert, came with a great company to diuers of the Bishop of Durhams houses in the habits of Fryers, and spoyled them, leauing nothing but bare wals, and did many other notable robberies, for which they (I meane the captaines and diuers of their company) were soone after hanged at Yorke. This Bishop stood very stoutly in defence of the liberties of his See, recouered diuers lands taken away from Anthony Beake his predecessor (as before is mentioned) and procured this sentence to be giuen in the behalf of his church, quod Episcopus Dunelmen. debet habere forisfacturas guerrarum intra libertates, lient Rex extra, that the Bishop of Durham is to haue the forfeitures of warre in as ample sort within his owne liberties as the king without. That which by some is attributed to Ranulf Flambard, I finde by other reported of this man, to wit, that it was he who compassed the city of Durham with a wall, certaine it is that he built a hall, kitchin, and chappell at Middleham. But before he could quite finish the chappell he did, to wit, September 22. or (as one deliuereth) September 28. 1333. He lieth buried before the high altar at Durham couered with a marble stone curiously wrought and inlayd with brasse prouided by himselfe in his life time.
            
            
               44 Richard de Bury.
               
                  1333. Edw. 3.7. IN great haste (but with no great good spéed) the Couent of Durham proceeded vnto the election of a new Bishop (the olde being yet scarcely buried) and they made choise of one of their owne company a monke of Durham. This election the Archbishop of Yorke confirmed; yea the matter grew so forward, as the same Archbishop was content to giue him consecration also. All this while the kings good will was not sought, no nor (which was a greater ouersight as the worlde then went) the Popes neither. The king therefore not onely refused to deliuer possession of the Temporalties vnto this elect, but also laboured the Pope, ex plenitudine potestatis to conf
                     •
                  rre the Bishopricke vpon a chaplaine of his named Richard de Bury, then Deane of Welles. Partly to pleasure the

one that requsted, partly to displeasure the other for not requesting, he did so, and commanded the Bishop of Winchester to consecrate him, which beeing performed at Chertsey soone after Christmas, the king presently inuested him in the temporalties belonging to that See. Now was the monke a Bishop without a Bishopricke. Hauing no other home hee was faine to returne to his cloyster, and there for very griefe (as it is to be supposed) within a few daies after died. This Richard de Bury was borne at Saint Edmunds-Bury in Suffolke, whence he tooke his surname; for he was the sonne of one sir Richard Angaruill knight. His father died leauing him very yoong, and committed him to the tuition of Iohn Willoughby a Priest, his Uncle, who brought him vp carefully, and that for the most part in the Uniuersity of Oxford. From thence hee was called to teach Edward of Windsor Prince of Wales. At what time the said Prince fledde into France with his mother, hee was principall receiuer of the kings reuenewes in Gascoigne. Their money failing, hee ayded them secretly with a great summe of that he had receiued for the king. It had almost cost him his life; he was so narrowly pursued by some of the kings friends that got vnderstanding of it, as he was glad to hide himselfe in a stéeple in Paris the space of seuen daies. King Edward the third his scholler being come to the crown, made him first his Coserer, then Treasurer of the Wardrobe, and kéeper of the priuy Seale. In this last office he continued fiue yeares; in which space hée was twice sent Ambassador vnto the Pope. The yeere 1333. he was made Deane of Wels, (a goodly prefermēt in those daies.) He had not enioied that place one whole yeere, when he was called vnto the Bishoprick of Durham, whereunto he was cons. Dec. 19. 1333. (not 1334. as some deliuer) in the presence of the king, the Quéene, Edward K. of Scotland, 2. Archbishops, 5, Bishops, 7. Earles, &amp; a number other noble personages both men and women. The yéere following he became Chancellor, and within two yéeres after that Treasurer of England. Being Bishop he was often implosed in ambassages of the greatest importance. What time of leisure he had, he spent either in prayer or conference with his Chaplaines (whereof he had many about him, and these

great learned men) or else in study, wherewith he was wonderfully delighted. Hee writ many things not yet perished, amongst the rest, in one worke which he called Philobiblos, he saith of himselfe, extatico quodam librorum amore potenter se abreptum. That he was mightily carried away, and euen beside himselfe with imm
                     •
                  derat loue of books, and desire of reading. And indéed his study was so well furnished, as it is thought hée had more bookes then all the Bishops in England beside. He was much delighted with the company and acquaintance of learned men. Many letters passed betwéen him, Francis Petrarke, &amp; diuers others then famous for learning. He had alwaies in his house (as before I haue said) many Chaplaines, all great Schollers: of which number were Th. Bradwardin, after Archb. of Canterbury, Rich. Fitzralph Archbishop of Armagh, Walter Burley, I. Mandut, Ro. Holcot &amp; R. Killington, Doctors of Diuinity; Richard Bintworth and Walter Segraue, the one afterward Bishop of London, the other of Chichester. His manner was at dinner and supper time to haue some good booke read vnto him; whereof he would disco
                     •
                  rse with his Chaplaines a great part of the day following, if busines interrupted not his course. He was very bountifull vnto the poore. Wéekely he bestowed for their releese 8. quarters of wheat made into bread, beside the offall &amp; fragments of his Tables. Riding betwéen Newcastle and Durham, he would giue 8. l. in alms, from Durham to Stocton, 5. l. from Durham to Aukland 5. marks, from Durham to Middleham 5. l. &amp;c. I finde it reported that he founded a Hall in Oxford, and indued it with some reuenues for the maintenance of Students in the same but I thinke it mistaken for that which was done by his next s

                  ccessor. Certain it is, that he notably furnished a library in that Uniuersity, and took order that the kéeping thereof should be committed vnto 5. schollers, 
                     •
                  o whom he made a certaine allowance for their labor. He also bestowed many sumptuous ornaments on his Church of Durham. Hauing continued Bishop there eleuen yeeres, &amp; almost 3. months, he departed this life at Aukland, Aprill 24. 1345. being 58. yéers of age. He lieth buried in the South Angle of his owne Church.
            
            
               
               45 Thomas Hatfield.
               THe Pope had now many yéeres taken vnto himselfe the authority of bestowing all Bishopricks:1345. Edw. 3.19. which the king &amp; nobility of this realme being much agréeued with all, made diuers Lawes and statutes to restore Churches and couents to the liberty of their ancient elections. When the king therfore had laboured a while in this matter; he being desirous of preferring this Hatsield his Secretary vnto Durham (a man that he knew the Pope might iustly except against; and peraduenture doubting the Couent would not chuse him) was content to request the Pope to giue it vnto him, and thereby opened a passage vnto him, wherby he entred into possession again of his wonted vsurpation. The Pope glad of this oportunity, without any regard or examination of his worthines, by and by accepted of him: And when some of the Cardinals tooke exceptions against him, saying that he was not onely a méere lay man, but a fellow of light behauior, and no way fit for that place: He answered, that if the King of England had requested him for an asse at that time he would not haue denied him. This man it was that built Durham colledge in Oxford &amp; purchased certaine lands vnto the same for the maintenance of such Monks of Durham as should be thought fit to study there. That Colledge is now called Trinity Colledge, so named by Sir Thomas Pope that bestowed a new foundation vpon the same. He built also Durham palace in London to receiue himselfe and his successours when they should haue occasion to repaire thither. He was consecrate the tenth of Iuly 1345. and died in the beginning of May 1381. So he sate Bishop sixe and thirty yeeres lacking only two months. Lastly he was a principall benefactor if not the founder of the Friery of Northallerton in Yorkshire, beeing for Carmelites or white Friers.

               56 Thomas Ruthall.
               
                  THomas Ruthall was borne in Cicester in Glocestershire and brought vp in Cambridge,1508. Hen. 7.24. where he procéeded Doctor of Law. He was preferred to the Bishopricke of Durham by King Henry the 7. after whose death he was made one of the Priuy councell vnto the yong king, Henry the 8. who estéemed greatly of him for his wisedome and learning, and imployed him often in ambassages, and other businesses of importance. Amongst the rest, it pleased the king one time to require him to set down his iudgement in writing concerning the estate of his Kingdome in generall, and particularly to enforme him in certaine things by him specified. This discourse the Bishop writ very carefully, and caused it to bee bound in Uelime guilt, &amp; otherwise adorned in the best maner. Now you shall vnderstand, how that it chanced him about the same time to set downe a note of his owne priuate estate; containing an inuentory not only of his vtensiles and houshold stuffe in euery of his houses, with their value, but also of his monies either owing vnto him, or deniers contans ready in his coffers, which amounted vnto an infinite treasure, no lesse then 100000. l. This account was written in a paper booke of the same fashion and binding that the other was, which was prouided for the king, whereby it happened, that the King sending Cardinall Wolsey for the other draught that he had so long before required of him, the Bishoppe mistaking, deliuered that which contained the report of his owne wealth and priuate estate. This the Cardinall soone espying, and willing to doe the Bishop a displeasure (for there had béen long and great emulation betwéen them)

deliuered it as he had receiued it vnto the king, shewing how the Bishoppe had very happily mistaken himselfe; For now (quoth hee) you see where you may at any time command a great masse of money if you need it. As soone as the Bishop vnderstood his owne error, the conceit therof touched him so neere, as within a very short space after he died. In his time the parish Church of Cicester was built for the greatest part: and he promised to contribute much therunto, but preuented by death, performed nothing Anne Aueling his aunt by the mothers side

He also raised from the foundation the goodly dining chamber at Aukland, &amp; dying before it might be finished, tooke order with one Stranguidge that was his administrator to perfect it. He deceased at London the yeere 1523. and lieth buried at Westminster almost ouer against the monument of K. Henry 3. in a very séemly toomb vpon which are these words to be read.

               IMmediately after the death of Bishop Ruthall, Cardinall Woolsey resigning Bathe (which he held in commendam with Yorke) took Durham in stead therof,1523. Hen. 8.15. and held the same about the space of seuen yéeres. In the latter end of the yéere, 1529. he gaue it ouer to haue Winchester, which he held little more then one yeere, and died Nouemb. 29. 1530. See more of him in Yorke.

Rather therefore should I gesse some other occas

He was a very rare &amp; admirable man, in whom I thinke no man will blame or reprehend any thing but his religion. There was scarse any kind of good learning in which he was not excellent. A very good Grecian, well séene in the Hebrew tong, a very eloquent Rhetorician, a passing skilfull Mathematician (famous especially for Arithmetiks, wherof hee writ a worke much esteemed) a great Lawyer (in that faculty hée proceedrd Doctor) and a profund Diuine, as diuers his workes yet extant doe very well testifie. But his greatest commendation of all is, that which I finde giuen him by Bale out of sir Thomas More, that, as there was no man more adorned with knowledge and good literature, no man more seuere and of greater integrity for his life and manners; so there was no man a more sweet &amp; pleasant companion, wi

He brought water thither with a conduit, whereas before time it was serued with well water. He made the gatehouse at Alnewike, and built the Tolebooth in the market of Durham, all of stone, with diuers edifices neare the hinder part of the said Tolboothe, which he gaue also to the City of Durham. Lastly, he repaired with great charge the third part of Tine-bridge. Hauing continued in this Sée the space of one and twenty yeares with great honour.

Queene Mary dying: for his contumacy &amp; disobedience vnto the Q. now deceased, he was iustly depriued of his Bishoprick in the month of Iul. 1559. He was then committed vnto the custody of the Archb. of Canterbury, who entertained him most kindly, and seemed very glad of his company. But he enioyed it a very litle while for within fower monthes after his depriuation, viz Nouember 18. following, being eighty fiue yeares of age, hee departed this life at Lambhith, where hee was

               Carlioll (a City no doubt of great antiquity) was wasted, and in a manner vtterly destroyed by the Danes about the yeare of our Lord 900. The yeare 1090. it happened the King of England (William Rufus) to passe that way into Scotland. Hee considering the naturall strength of the place, the pleasantnesse of the seate, the fertility of the soile, and the necessity of a fortification for defeuce of the Country thereabout; thought good to reedifie it, and according to this determination about thrée yéeres after, not onely raised againe the walles (then flat to the ground, in so much as great trées grew in the ruines of them) but also bestowed the building of a faire and strong Castle in the same, and then enpeopled it, at first with Dutchmen, (whom soone after hée remooued into Wales) and afterwards with Englishmen of the South parts, hée affoording many great and singular priuiledges vnto them The gouernment of this new e

This man beeing very rich, began to build in Carlile a goodly Church in the honor of the blessed Uirgine, intending to bestow vpon it such possessions as God had endowed him withall, for the maintenance of either Prebendaries, or some other kinde of religious persons in the same. But being taken away by death before the accomplishment of this so good a purpose. Adelwald or Athelwulf, the first Prior of Saint Oswald in Nostlis and Confessor vnto K.

Anselme (whom beeing dangerously sicke, he had sent for into Normandy to bée his ghostly Father) replenished it with monkes. About the same time (or a little before, to wit the yeare 1075.) Peter Bishop of Lichfield remooued his Sée thither. But his next successor Robert de Lymesey, forsaking Chester; made choice of Couentry, whence not long after the succeeding Bishops, returned again to Lichfield. King Henry the eight restored vnto this City that honor, and conuerting the Monastery aforesaid into a Cathedrall Church, erected a new Bishopricke there, appointed the Counties of Chester, Lancaster, and Richmond to be the Dioces of this new Sée, and the same to be estéemed in the Prouince of the Archbishop of Yorke.

               2 The next in time is one Vlricus or Odolricus (so Malmsbury calleth him) an Englishman (saith Ciaconius) that being Cardinall came into England as the Popes Legate anno. 1109. (Malms. Houeden, Florent Wigorn.) end not 1107. as Ciaconius; brought the Archiepiscopall pall vnto Thomas the yonger Archbishop of Yorke, and caused him to consecrate Turgod Prior of Durham vnto the Bishopricke of S. Andrewes in Scotland.
               3 Robert, surnamed by some Polen or Pulley, by other Bullen or Pulcy, was vndoubtedly our countriman, a man of great fame for learning in his time. Unto him the Uniuersity of Oxford is much beholding; for whereas in the raigne of King Harold it had béene so wasted and destroyed, as that for many yeares it lay desolate and forsaken of schollars, hée was a meanes so draw them thither againe, and leauing the Uniuersity of Paris, tooke great pains in reading, disputing and writing diuers learned bookes, whereby hee became so famous euen in forraine natious, as by Innocentius the second he was sent for to Rome, by Celestinus the second made a Cardinall, tt. S. Eusebij the year 1144. and by Lucius the second appointed the Popes Chauncellor. Hee died about the yeare of our Lord 1150. vide plura Twyne p. 108. and 225.
               4 Some two yeares after the preferment of Pulley, Nicolas Breakespeare was made Bishop Cardinall of Alba, and a while after, Pope. He was borne in Hartfordshire at Abbots Landley, neer vnto S. Albones, a yonger brother of the house of Breakespeare, and the son of one Robert, a married priest the which Robert waxing olde; and hauing lost his wife, became a monke in S. Albones, at what time his son Nicholas was yet but a tender youth, resorting vnto his Father for releese and maintenance, the olde man out of a superstitious conceipt, that the next way to heauen, was to renounce all ca

manner cast him off, willing him to try his fortune abroade, without expecting from him any manner of succour: wheras Saint Paul telleth vs, that he that is not carefull of his owne especially such as are of his owne houshold, is worse then an insidell. Hee beeing thus turned 
                     •
                  if to the wide world, without all meanes of liuelihood, choosing rather to beg any where then where hee was best knowne, got him into France, and trauelling through the country, found no intertainment, till he came to Ualentia in Prouince, where the Monkes of the Abbey of Saint Rusus, seeing him a beautifull and towardly child, witty, and for his age very industrious, tooke him in, and in processe of time not onely admitted him into their fraternity, but also chose him first Prior, and afterward Abbot hauing in the meane time by painefull study, attained much good learning. It was not long then before enuy or happily some misgouernment of his, bredde many differences betwéene him and his monkes, who accused him of many things vnto the Pope that then was, Eugenius the third. Hee, after examination of the cause, acquitted the Abbot, and reprehended sharply the monkes as froward and mutinous fellowes, charging them héereafter to yeeld vnto him as their gouernour, all dutifull obedience, which notwithstanding, after a little while they renewed their complaints. As before, so now the Abbot answered all their accusations, and that with such eloquence, discretion and modesty (saith my Author) as the Pope taking a great liking of the man, hee told his accusers they were vnworthy of him, and therefore willing him to séeke some other for his place with whom they might better agree; hee created him Bishop Cardinall of Alba. This was the yeare 1146. Soone after which time, vpon experience of his wisedome and great learning, hee sent him as his Legate into the countries of Denmark &amp; Norway, the inhabitants whereof, being then Pagans he conuerted vnto Christian religion. At his returne out of those parts. Anastasius the Pope, (who, Eugenius being dead, in the meane time, had succéeded him) together with his Cardinals, receiued him with great honor, much aprouing &amp; commending his doings. It happened then within a few moneths after his returne,

the said Pope died also, and this man also taking on him the name of Hadrian the 4. was chosen Pope in his roome. For his carriage in that place, how he brought vnder his entire obedience the citizens of Rome, endeuoring earnestly to shake off the Popes yoake of bondage, how hee suffered or rather compelled with intollerable insolency, Frederike Barbarossa the Emp. to hold his stirrop, &amp; what stirs were betwéen them afterward, I shall referre you vnto the stories of those times. This concerning him, I must not omitte, that he appointed the Abbot of S. Albones to be the first Abbot of England as S. Alban (to whom the Abbey was dedicated) was the Protomartyr or first Martyr of England. Hauing sate 4. yeares nine Moneths, he died at Anagnia. Septem. 1. 1159. being choaked by a flye in his drinke, as most affirme. Howbeit, Ciaconius saith, he died of a squinancy or anguina. Hee lieth buried in Saint Peters Church at Rome by his patrone Eugenius the third.
               5 One Ponticus Virunnius an Italian Pedanté (vppon what authority I know not) reporteth that Galfridus Monumethensis author of the Brittish history was a Cardinall of Rome. And Ciaconius affirmeth the same, citing for his authors in that behalfe, Leland, Ioan. Rossus and Bostonus Buriensis. It seemeth to be vntrue, as may partly bee gathered by those things that are noted of him by me in the Catalogue of the Bishops of S. Assaph, to which Church hee was cons. Bishop 1151. Sée more of him there.
               6 Bosa an Englishman (saith Bale) and (as another reporteth nephew vnto Pope Hadrian, was made a Cardinal and the Popes chamberlain in Decem 1155. His titles were first, SS. Cosmae &amp; Damiani; then S. Crucis in Ierusalem, afterward S. Pudentianae. Through his endeuor chiefly Alexander the third was chosen Pope by the voices of 19. Cardinalls, yet could not carry the matter so cleanly but that another Antipope was set vp against him, hauing 4. voices onely, vnder him the saide Alexander liued in great authority and fauour, and died about the yeare 1180.

The yeare 1219. hee was with Lewis the French King (afterward called Saint Lewis) at the taking of of Damiata in Egypt.

Ciaconius mentioneth him twice, once as being created by Honor: the 3. 1216. and afterward by the name of Rob. Vmmercot as preferred to the saide title in September 1231. Hee was a man (saith Matthew Paris) discretus &amp; circumspectus, omnibus amabilis merito, &amp; gratiosus, wherefore Pope Gregory the ninth being dead, he was thought the fittest man of all the College of Cardinalls to succéede him in the Papacy, and accordingly in all likelihood was to haue beene elected, but that some of that holy company, much scorning that any other then an Italian should sit in Peters chaire, caused him to be poysoned in the very Conclaue (as they call it) where the Cardinalls were assembled to make the election. This is the reporte of Thomas Eckleston in his history of the comming of Friers Minors into this Realm, as also of diuers others. Hee died insort as aforesaid, the yeare 1241.
               12 Matthew Paris in his report of the yeare 1247. maketh mention of an English Cardinall named Iohn, that when the Pope was in a great chase because King Henry the third withstood a certaine intollerable exaction of his, and threatned to doe great matters against him; sought by many effectuall reasons to diuert him from his intended course, and to asswage his fury; but to no purpose, till that at length the King for feare of his terrible thunderbolts was faine to yéeld. This man died at the Councell of Lyons the yeare 1274. Hee is mentioned as it séemeth of Ciaconius by the name of Ioannes Franciogia, that was (as hee saith) a Burgundian and ordained to the title S. Laur. in Lucina, and was at last Cardinall Bishop of Portua.

                     onius and the rest of our Writers say, hee was a French man, the sonne of a French Souldier named Grundarde. The truth I thinke to be that which Bale out of Bostonus Buriensis a man liuing in those times hath deliuered vs, to witte, that he was a French man borne, but the sonne of a certaine famous English Physitian, named also William Grisant, brought vp in Merton Colledge in Oxford. This Pope whether English or French, died the 19 of December, 1370.
               27 The first Cardinall created by the said Vrbanus was one they call Anglicus Grimaldi de Grisacco; and diuers suppose him also to haue beene an Englishman. Ciaconius and the rest acknowledge (that which Bale affirmeth, and I take it to bée a truth, how that he was the Popes brothers sonne, and so by descent English, although not by the place of his birth. Hee was first a Regular Cannon of S. Rufus by Ualentia, as Hadrian the fourth was, the Bishoppe of Auinion, Cardinall tt. S. Petri ad vincula, first &amp; after Bishop Cardinall of Abba. He died at Auinion, April 16. 1387 hauing held in Commendam many yeares the Deanry of York.
               28 About these times Bale supposeth Iohn Thoresby Archbishop of Yorke to haue béene created a Priest Cardinal tt. Saint Sabinae: and I beléeue it to bee true enough, although

that neither by Onuphrius nor Ciaconius hee is remembred, Sée more of him in Yorke.
               29 Simon Langhan Archbishoppe of Canterbury, was created a Priest Cardinall by the foresaid Vrban in Sept. 1368. and after preferred to be Bishoppe Cardinall of Preneste, by Greg. 11. Sée more of him in Cant.
               30 Adam Easton a Benedictine Monke of Norwich, born of meane parentage, and that (as it seemeth) in Herefordeshire, procéeded Doctor of Diuinity in Oxford, writ much, and was a man of great both wisdome and learning, well séene both in the Gréeke and Hebrew tongues, which considering the times wherein hée liued may seeme strange, onely for his worth, without any respect of fauour. He was created a Cardinall tt. S. Caeciliae, but by whom it is doubtfull: Some say it was by Vrban the sixt in his first yeare, other by Gregory 11. Howsoeuer, certaine it is, that an Antipope being set vp against Vrban by the name of Clement the 7. Vrban being forsaken of all his olde Cardinals, grew at last iealous of diuers of those that himselfe had preferred, and especially of such as were most eminent for their vertues. Therefore no lesse then seuen hee apprehended at one time, to wit, the second of Ianuary, 1285 (this Cardinall being one) and after torture and long imprisonment, sayling from Nuceria to Genua, he caused fiue of them to bee sowed into sackes, &amp; with barbarous cruelty to bee throwne into the sea. As for this man (whose good fortune it was to escape that washing, committed him to close prison, till that by the earnest entreaty of King Richard the second, he was allowed some more liberty; Marry his liuings were all taken from him. In that poore estate he continued about 5. yeares, euen all the time of Vrbans raign. His next Successor Bonifacius 9. set him quite at liberty

               31 More likely it is, (that which T. Walsingham affirmeth that William Courtney then B. of London, was also made Cardinall by the same Vrban, whereof sée more in London.

                  he one Henry for the other; whereof mee thinkes it may bee a sufficient argument that in the Epitaph engrauen vpon his toombe, where all his preferments are expressed, of his Cardinals hat there is no mention.
