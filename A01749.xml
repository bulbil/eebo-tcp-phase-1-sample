            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            GEORGE GASCOIGNE Esquire to the Reader.
            
               
                  EVery mā that is of iudgment, &amp; hath a reasonable disposition to the atteining of anie vertue, together with a discretion to vse the benefites of nature, will confesse, that we are by as great reason bounde to encourage and commend the industrie of the diligent, as to dispraise and punish the slouth or abuse of the negligent: For if princes doe not aswell rewarde and cherish the well deseruing subiecte, as their Iudges and Magistrates are readie to correct the offendour,

the Common Wealth might then quickly be depriued both of the one and the other: I meane that as fast as the sword of Iustice should weede out the one, so fast the scourg of ingratitude woulde chase out the other. And so thereby their dominions might (in the end) become naked and altogether vnfurnished.
            We see the good huswife is no lesse curious to decke her bees hiue, to rub and perfume it with sweete herbes, to couer and defend it from raine with clay and boordes, and to place it in the warme Sunshine safe from the Northerly blastes: then Shee is readie to wreck her malice on the drones, to smoke and smoulder them with Bunte and Brimstone,

to fray and chase them out by soudain noyse, and to kill them and caste them away, as vnprofitable members in her Microcosmos. Yea, and with melodie of Basons and Timbrils will shee welcome home her swarme, if at anye time they doe (waspishly) goe astray, &amp; yet at last retourne to their former abyding.
            Thus muche (gentle reader) I haue thought good (Allegorically) to write in the behalfe of the right worshipful &amp; my very frend S. Humfrey Gilbert Knight, the true authour of this little (yet profitable) Pamphlet, intituled A Discourse of a Discouerie for a newe passage to Cataia, &amp;c. In

whose Commendation I woulde fayne write asmuche as hee deserueth, were I not afrayde to bee condemned by him of flatterie: which blame (with my friendes) I vse not to deserue. But surely, ouer and besides that, hee is a gentleman wel and worshipfully borne and bredde, and well tryed to bee valiant in martiall affayres, wherby hee hath worthely beene constituted a Coronell and generall in places requisite, and hath with sufficiencie discharged the same, both in this Realme, and in forreigne Nations: hee is also indued with sundrie great gyftes of the minde, and generally well giuen to th' aduauncemente of knowledge

and vertue. All whiche good partes. I rather set downe constrained by the present occasion, then prompted by any vaine desire to currie fanoure with my friende: For his vertues are sufficient to praise themselues. And it shalbe a sufficient conclusion for my prayses, to wishe that our realme had store of suche Gentlemen.
            But as the good Gardener doth couer his tender herbes in winter, and cherishe them also in summer: so haue I thought my selfe bounden somewhat to say in the commendation of this present Treatise, and somewhat to answere vnto the obiections that might bee made by

such as list to cauill at euerie commendable enterprise.
            And surely I cannot chuse, but highly prayse the noble minde and courage of the Authour, who more respectinge the publique profit that might ensue by this Discouerie, then the delicate life of a Courtier, well countenanced and fauoured both by his Prince and all the Nobilitie, had prepared his owne bodie to abide the malice of the windes and waues, and was euen ready to haue perfourmed the voyage in proper person, if he had not beene by her Maiestie otherwise commanded and imployed in martiall affaires, aswell in Ireland, as sithence in other places.
            
               You must herewith vnderstand (good Reader) that the authour hauinge a worshipfull Knight to his brother, who abashed at this enterprise (aswell for that he himselfe had none issue, nor other heier whome he ment to bestow his lands vpon, but onely this Authour, and that this voyage then seemed strāg and had not beene commonly spoken of before, as also because it seemed vnpossible vnto the common capacities) did seeme partly to mislike his resolutions, &amp; to disuade him from the same: thereupon he wrote this Treatise vnto his saide Brother, both to excuse and cleare himselfe from the note of rashnesse, and also to set downe

such Authorities, reasons, and experiences, as had chiefly encouraged him vnto the same, as may appeare, by the letter next following, the which I haue here inserted for that purpose. And this was done about vij. yeares now past, sithence which time the originall copies of the same haue lien by the authour as one rather dreading to hazarde the Iudgements of curious perusers, then greedie of glorie by hasty publication.
            Now it happened that my self being one (amongst manie) beholding to the said S. Humfrey Gilbert for sundrie curtesies, did come to visit him in Winter last passed at his house in Limehowse, and

beeing verie bolde to demaunde of him howe he spente his time in this loytering vacation from martiall stratagemes, he curteously tooke me vp into his Studie, and there shewed me sundrie profitable and verie cōmendable exercises, which he had perfected painefully with his owne penne: And amongst the rest this present Discouerie. The which as well because it was not long, as also because I vnderstoode that M. Fourboiser (a kinsman of mine) did pretend to trauaile in the same Discouerie, I craued at the saide S. Humfreyes handes for two or three dayes to reade and to peruse. And bee verie friendly granted my request, but stil seming to doubt

that thereby the same might, contrarie to his former determination, be Imprinted.
            And to be plaine, when I had at good leasure perused it, &amp; therwithall conferred his allegations by the Tables of Ortelius, and by sundrie other Cosmographicall Mappes and Charts, I seemed in my simple iudgement not onely to like it singularly, but also thought it very meete (as the present occasion serueth) to giue it out in publike. Wherupon I haue (as you see) caused my friendes great trauaile, and mine owne greater presumption to be registred in print.
            But since I haue thus aduentured both his rebuke, and mine owne

reproofe, let me thus muche alledge in both our defences.
            
               
                  1 First it is but a Pamphlet &amp; no large discourse, &amp; therefore the more to be borne withall: since the faults (if any be) shalbe the fewer, because the volume is not great.
               
                  2 Also it was ment by th'autour, but as a priuate Letter vnto his Brother for his better satisfaction: and therefore his imperfections therein (if any were) are to be pardoned, since it is very likely that if he had ment to publish the same, he would with greater heede haue obserued and perused the worke in euerie parte.
               
                  3 Againe, it commeth foorth without his consent: So that he had

neither warning nor time to examine, nor yet to amende anie thing that were worthie misliking.
               
                  4 Furthermore it treateth of a matter whereof no man hath heretofore written particularly, nor shewed ani approued reason for the same. So that not onely his trauaile and paine are very commendable (who out of sundrie Authorities woulde gather one reasonable coniecture) but also the worke is not to be thought bareine, although it doe not fully prooue somuch as may be expected, since he that plougheth in a flintie fielde, speedeth well if he reape but an indifferent crop.
               
                  5 And last of all it is to bee considered, that of thinges vncertaine,

the greatest Clerke that euer was could write but probably.
            
            Herewithall, as I haue preposterously answered such obiections as might be made against it, So now let mee say that a great learned man (euen M. Dee) doth seeme very well to like of this Discouerie and doth much commende the Authour, the which he declareth in his Mathematical preface to th'english Euclide. I. refer thee (Reader) to peruse the same, and thinke it not strange though I be encouraged by so learned a fore leader, to set forth a thing whiche hee so well liked of.
            To conclude, whereas other Cosmographical workes doe but

shew vs things already knowen &amp; treated of, this Discouerie doeth tend to a very profitable and commendable practise of a thing to bee discouered. So that I thought it my part, both for great good will to the authour, and for publike perfourmance of a common duetie, to commend a little Bee somuch commē
               dable, to defend it from the stormes of obiections, with boords and clay of direct answers: To set it in the sunshine (as you see) and to ring it out with my best basons, for the better expressing of such ioye &amp; comfort, as I haue therein conceiued.
            All whiche, together with the frendly cōstructions of th'authours trauaile and my boldnes, I cōmend

(gentle reader) vnto thy curteous consideration, wishinge vnto thee, much profite by perusing this treatise, vnto the authour, much prayse according to his deserts, to my kinsman (who nowe attēpteth to proue the same discouery) happy returne, and to my selfe, some thankes and none ill will, for my presumption.
            So that the Authour being therby incouraged, may be the more willing hereafter to publishe some other well worthy which he hath in readinesse, and whereof hee hath made me alreadie an eyedwitnes. Farewell.

            ¶A LETTER OF SIR Humfrey Gilbert, Knight, sent to his Brother, Sir IOHN GILBERT, of Compton, in the Countie of Deuon Knight, concerning the discourse of this Discouerie.
            
               
                  SIR, YOV might iustly haue charged mee with an vnsetled head if I had at any time taken in hand, to discouer Vtopia, or any countrey fained by imagination: But Cataia is none such, it is a countrey, well knowen to be described and set foorth by all moderne Geographers, whose authoritie in this art (contrarie to all other) beareth

most credit, and the passage thereunto, by the Northwest from vs, through a sea which lieth on the Northside of Labrador, mencioned &amp; prooued, by no smal number of the most expert, and best learned amongst them. By whose authoritie, if I (amongest others) haue beene moued, to hope of that passage, who can iustly blame me? sith euerie man is best to be credited and beleeued,
                  Cuique in sua arte credendum est.
                in his owne professed art and science, wherin he doth most excell.
            And if I would not giue that credit, to those authours which they deserue, but were so wedded vnto my owne ignorance,

that neither the authoritie of learned Geographers, the reasons of wise Philosophers, nor the experience of painfull Trauellers, might persuade me to belieue a trueth: Then might I iustly be accompted selfe willed (which a learner ought chiefly to eschewe) holding for a Maxime, that, Discentem oportet credere. And knowing you to be one that may easily be induced to hearken, and yeelde to reason, I will briefly opē vnto you, some fewe of the grounds of mine opinion, to the ende you may the better vnderstād, that my hope of this discouerie and passage, was not so rashe, or foolishe, as

you heretofore haue deemed: but contrariwise, grounded vpon a very sure foundation, and that not vnaduisedly, but after long consideration &amp; great conferēce, had with such as I knew to be both wise, learned, and of great experience, as well touching this passage, as the wonderfull welth and commodities, which might, and would ensue thereby, it being once discouered: whose abundance of riches &amp; treasure, no man of learning, and iudgement doubteth, for that the countreys themselues, and their commodities, are apparantly knowen by sundrie mens experience.
            
               But as it is one thing to speak, and an other by reason to confirme, so I wil briefly do my indeuour to proue the same. And haue herewithall sent you, for your better vnderstandinge, a rough draught, of a vniuersall Map in the end of the boke, sufficiēt to explane the matter, with those names only in effect which are mencioned in this discourse: to the ende that by resorting to this general Mappe, &amp;c. finding without difficultie, euerie particular place mencioned herein, you may the better gather my meaning, and conceiue my reasons, alledged for the proofe of this passage, nowe in question:

which I wil proue three wayes.
            Al which, I haue diuided into seuerall chapters, which may fully deliuer vnto you the whol contents of this worke, by their seuerall titles: as followeth. Fare you well from my lodging the last of Iune, Anno D. 1566.

            To proue a passage by authoritie to be on the Northside of AMERICA, to goe to CATAIA, China, and the East India. &amp;c.
            
               
                  WHen I gaue my self to the studie of Geographie, after I had perused &amp; diligently scanned the descriptions of Europe, Asia, and Afrike, and conferred them with the Mappes and Globes both Antique &amp; Moderne: I came in time to the fourth part of the worlde, cōmonly called AMERICA, which by al descriptiōs I founde to be an Ilande enuironed round about with the Sea, hauing on the southside of it, the frete, or strayte of Magellan, on the West side Mare de sur, which Sea runneth towardes the North, separating it from the East parts of Asia, where the dominions of the Cataians are, On the East part our Weste Ocean, and on the Northside the sea that seuereth it frō 
               Grondland, thorow which Northern seas, the passage lyeth, which I take now in hande to discouer.
            
               Plato in Timeo, and in the Dialogue called Critias, discourseth of an incomparable

great Ilande, thē called Atlantis, being greater then all Affrik, and Asia, whiche laye Westward from the Straits of Gibraltar, Nauigable round aboute: affirming also that the Princes of Atlantis, did aswel enioye the gouernaunce of all Affrik, and the most part of Europe, as of Atlantis it selfe.
            Also to prooue Platoes opinion of this Ilande, and the inhabyting of it in aūcient tyme, by them of Europe, to be of the more credit: Marineus Siculus, in his Chronicle of Spayne, reporteth that there hath ben foūd by the Spaniardes, in the Golde Mynes of America, certeine peeces of Money, ingraued wt the Image of Augustus Caesar: which peeces were sent vnto the Pope, for a testimonie of the matter, by Iohn Rufus, Archebishop of Cosentinum.
            
            Moreouer, this was not onely thought of Plato, but by Marsilius Ficinus, an excellēt Florentine Philosopher, Crantor the Graecian, Proclus,
               
                  Proclus pag. 24.
                &amp; also Philo the famous Ievve, (as appeareth in his booke De Mundo, &amp; in the Cōmentaries vpon Plato) to be ouerflowen, and swallowed vp with water, by reason of a mightie Earthquake, and streamyng downe of the heauenly Fludgates.

The like whereof happened vnto some part of Italie, whē by the forciblenes of the Sea, called Superum, it cut of Cicilia from the Continent of Calabria,
               
                  Iustine Lib. 4.
                as appeareth in Iustine, in ye beginning of his fourth boke. Also there chaunced the like in Zelande a part of Flaunders.
            
            And also the cities of Pyrrha,
               
                  Plinie.
                and Antissa, aboute Meotis Palus, with the Citie Burys, in the Corynthian bosome, cōmonly called Sinus Corynthiacus, haue bene swallowed vp with the sea, and are not at this day to be discerned: By which accident, America grew to be vnknowen of long time, vnto vs of the later ages, and was lately discouered again, by Americus Vespucius, in the yere of our Lord, 1497. which some say to haue bene first discouered, by Christopherus Columbus, a Genuest. Anno. 1492.
            
            The same calamity hapned vnto this Isle of Atlantis 600. &amp; od yeres before Plato his time, which some of ye people of the southeast parts of ye world accompted as 9000. yeres: for the manner then was to recone the moone, her Period of the Zodiak for a yere, which is our vsuall moneth, depending a Luminari minore.
            
            So that in these our dayes there can no

other mayne or Ilande bee founde, or iudged to be parcell of this Atlantis, then those Westerne Ilandes, which beare now the name of AMERICA: counteruailing thereby the name of Atlantis, in the knowledge of our age.
            Then, if when no part of the said Atlantis was oppressed by water, &amp; earthquake, the coastes rounde about the same were nauigable: a far greater hope now remaineth of the same by the Northwest, seeing the most parte of it was,
                  A minore ad 
                        〈◊〉
                     .
                since that time, swalowed vp with water, which coulde not vtterly take away the olde deepes and chanels, but rather, be an occasion of the inlarging of the olde, and also an inforcing of a great many new: why then should we nowe doubte of our Northwest passage &amp; nauigation from Englande to India? &amp;c. seeing that Atlātis, now called AMERICA, was euer knowen to be an Ilande, and in those days nauigable round about, which by accesse of more water coulde not be diminished.
            Also Aristotle in his boke De Mundo, and the learned Germane, Simon Gryneus in his annotations vpon the same, saith that

the whole earth (meaning thereby as manifestly doth appeare, Asia, Afrik and Europe, being al the countreis then knowen) to be but on Ilande, cōpassed about with ye reach of the Sea Atlantine: which likewise approueth AMERICA to be an Iande, and in no parte adioyning to Asia, or the rest.
            Also many Auncient writers,
                  Strabo. lib. 15 as Strabo &amp; others, called both the Ocean sea (which lieth East of India) Atlanticū pelagus; and that Sea also on the west coasts of Spayne &amp; Afrik, Mare Atlanticum: the distance betweene which two coastes, is almost halfe the compasse of the earth.
            So that it is incredible, as by Plato appeareth manifestly, that the East Indian sea had the name Atlanticum pelagus, of the Mountaine Atlas in Afrik, or yet the Sea adioining to Afrik had name Oceanus Atlanticus, of the same mountaine: but yt those Seas and the mountaine Atlas, were so called of this great Ilande Atlantis, and that the one &amp; the other,
                  Valerius Anselmus in Catalogo annorum et principum, fol. 6. had their names for a memoriall of the mightie prince Atlas, sometime King therof, who was Iaphet youngest sonne to Noah, in whose time the

whole earth was diuided betwene the three bretherne, Sem. Cam, and Iaphet.
            
            
               
                  Genesis the 9. and 10.
               Wherefore I am of opinion that America by the Northwest, wilbe founde fauorable to this our enterprise, and am the rather imboldened to beleeue the same, for that I finde it not onely confirmed by Plato, Aristotle, and other auncient Philosophers: but also by al the best moderne Geographers, as (Gemma Frisius, Muristerus, Appianus, Hunterus, Costaldus, Guyzardinꝰ, Michael Tramesinus, Franciscus Demongenitus, Barnardus Puteanus, Andreas Vanasor, Tramontanus, Petrus Martyr, and also Hortelius) who doth coaste out in his generall Mappe (set out Anno 1569.) al ye coūtreys and capes, on the Northwestside of America, from Houchelaga to C. De Paramantia: describing likewise ye sea coasts of Cataia and Grondland, towardes any part of America, making both Grondland &amp; America, Ilands disioyned by a great sea, from any part of Asia.
            
            Al which learned men and painful trauellers haue affirmed, with one consent &amp; voice, that America was an Iland: &amp; yt there lyeth a great Sea betweene it, Cataia, and Grondland, by the which any man of our countrey, that wil giue the attempt,

may with smal danger passe to Cataia, the Moluccae, India, &amp; al other places in ye East, in much shorter time, then either the Spaniard, or Portingale doth, or may do, from the neerest parte of any of their countreis within Europe.
            
            What mooued these learned men to affirme thus much, I know not, or to what end so many &amp; sundrye trauellers,
                  We ought by reasons right to haue a reuerent opinion of worthy men.
                of both ages, haue allowed the same: But I coniecture that they would neuer haue so constantly affirmed, or notified their opinions therein to the world, if they had not had great good cause, and many probable reasons, to haue lead them thereunto.
            Now least you should make smal accompt of ancient writers or of their experiences, which trauelled long before our times, reconing their authority amongst fables of no importance: I haue for the better assurance of those proofes, set down some part of a discourse, writtē in the Saxon tongue, and translated into English by M. Nowel Seruaunte to Maister Secretarie Cecill,
               
                  Now Lord Burleighe &amp; highe Treasurer of England.
                wherein there is described a Nauigation, which one Ochther made, in the time of Kinge ALFRED, Kinge of Westsaxe

               Anno. 871. the wordes of which discourse were these:
                  A Nauigation, of one Ochther made in king Alfreds tyme.
                
               He sayled right North, hauing alvvayes the desert land on the Starborde, and on the Larbord, the mayne sea, cōtinueing his course, vntill he perceiued that the coaste bowed directly tovvardes the East, or else the Sea opened into the land he coulde not tel hovv far, vvhere he vvas compelled to staye, vntil he had a vvesterne vvinde, or somevvhat vpon the North, and sayled thence directly East, alongst the coast, so farre as he vvas able in foure dayes, vvhere he vvas againe inforced to tary, vntil he had a North vvind,
               
                  A perfect Description of our Muscouia voyage.
                
               because the coast there bowed directly towardes the South, or at least opened, he knew not how far into the land, so that he sayled thence along the coaste continually ful South, so farre as he could trauel in the space of fiue dayes, vvhere he discouered a mightie riuer, vvhiche opened farre into the lande, and in the entrye of this riuer he turned backe againe.
            
            Wherby it appeareth, that he went the verye same waye, that we now do yearely trade by S. Nicholas into Muscouia, whiche way no man in our age knewe,
                  By Sir HVGH WYLLOWBE, Knight, Chauncellor and borough.
                for certeintie to be sea, vntill it was since discouered by our English men, in the time of King Edvvarde the sixt: but thought before that

time that Grondlande had ioyned to Normoria Byarmia, and therfore was accompted a newe discouerie, being nothing so in deede, as by this discourse of Ochthets it appeareth.
            Neuertheles if any man shoulde haue takē this voiage in hand, by the incouragment of this onely author, he should haue beene thought but simple: consideringe that this Nauigation was writtē so many yeares past, in so barbarous a tongue by one onely obscure author, and yet wee in these our dayes finde by our owne experiences, his former reports to be true.
            How much more then, ought we to beleue this passage to Cataia to be, being verified by the opinions of all the best, both Antique, and Moderne Geographers, &amp; plainly set out in the best &amp; most allowed Mappes, Charts, Globes, Cosmographicall tables, and discourses, of this our age, and by the rest, not denyed, but left as a matter doubtfull.
            
               
               To proue by reason, a passage to be on the Northside of AMERICA: to goe to CATAIA, &amp;c, Cap. 2.
               
                  
                     FIrst, al seas are mainteined by the abundance of water, so that ye nerer the end, any Riuer, Baye or Hauē is, the shallower it waxeth, (although by some Occidental barre, it is somtime found otherwise) But the farther you saile West,
                     Experimented by our english fishers.
                   from Island, towards ye place, wher this fret is thought to be, the more deeper are the seas: which giueth vs good hope, of continuance of ye same sea, wt 
                  Mare de Sur, by some frete that lyeth betweene America, Grondlande, and Cataia.
               
               2 Also, if that America were not an Iland, but a part of the contīnent adioining to Asia, either the people which inhabite Mangia, Anian, and Quinzay, &amp;c being borderers vpon it, woulde before this time, haue made some roade into it: hoping to haue found some like cōmodities to their owne.
               
                  3 Or els the Scythians, and Tartarians, (which often times hertofore, haue sought far and nere,
                     Neede makes the olde wife to trotte.
                   for new seates, driuen thereunto, through the necessitie of their colde, and miserable countreys) would in al this time, haue found the way to America, &amp; entred ye same, had the passages bene neuer so strayte, or difficult: the countrie beeing so temperate, pleasaunte and fruitfull, in comparison of their owne. But there was neuer any such people found there, by any of the Spaniardes, Portingals, or Frenchemen, who firste discouered the Inlande of that Countrie: which Spaniardes, or Frenchemen, must then of necessitie, haue seene some one Ciuil man in America, consideringe how full of ciuil people Asia is: But they neuer sawe so muche as one token, or signe, that euer any man of the knowen part of the worlde, had beene there.
               4 Furthermore, it is to be thought, ye if by reason of mountains, or other craggy places, ye people neither of Cataia, or Tartarie could enter ye coūtrie of America, or they of America, haue entred Asia, if it were so ioyned: yet some one sauage, or wādring beast wold in so many yeres, haue passed into it: but there hath not at any time been found

any of ye beasts proper to Cataia, or Tartarie &amp;c. in America: nor of those proper to America, in Tartarie, Cataia, &amp;c. or ani part of Asia
               
               Which thing proueth America, not only to be one Iland, and in no part adioyning to Asia, But also that the people of those Countreyes, haue not had any traffyke with eache other.
               5 Moreouer, at the leaste some one of those painefull trauellors, which of purpose haue passed the Confines of both coū
                  treys, with intent only to discouer, would, (as it is most likely) haue gone from the one to the other: if there had bene any piece of lande, or Ismos, to haue ioyned thē together, or else haue declared some cause to the contrary.
               6 But neither Paulus venetus, who lyued, and dwelt a long time, in Cataia, euer came into America, and yet was at the Sea coastes of Mangia, ouer against it, where he was imbarked, and perfourmed a great Nauigation along those Seas: Neither yet Verarzanus, or Franciscus vasques de Coronado, who trauelled the North parte of America by lande, euer founde entrye from thēce by land, to Cataia, or any part of Asia.
               
               
                  7 Also it appeareth to be an Iland,
                  
                     
                        The Sea hath three motions

                   insomuche as the Sea runneth by nature circularly, from the East to the VVest, following the Diurnal motion of Primum Mobile, and carieth with it all inferiour bodies moueable, aswel celestial, as elemētal: which motion of ye waters, is most euidētly seene in the Sea, which lyeth on the Southside of Afrik, where the currant that runneth from the East to the VVest, is so strong (by reason of such motion) that the Portingales in ye voiages, Eastvvard to Callecute, in passing by Cap. De buona speranca, are enforced to make diuers courses, the currant there being so swift, as it striketh frō thence, all along VVestvvard, vpon the fret of Magellan, being distant frō thence, nere the fourth parte of the longitude of the earth: and not hauing free passage &amp; entrance, thorow that fret towardes the West, by reason of the narrownesse of the said straite of Magellan, it runneth to salue this wrong (Nature not yelding to accidē
                     tall restraintes) all along the Easterne coasts of America, Northvvardes, so farre as Cap. Fredo, beeing the farthest knowen place of the same continent, towardes the North: which is about, 4800. leagues, reconing therewithal the trending of the land.
               
                  8 So that this Currant, being continually mainteined with such force, as Iaques Cartier affirmeth it to be, who mette with the same being at Baccalaos, as he sailed alongst the coastes of America, then, either it must of necessitie, haue way to passe from Cap. Fredo, thorowe this frete, Westwarde towardes Cataia, being knowen to come so farre, onely to salue his former wronges, by the authoritie before named: or els it must needes strike ouer, vpon the coast of Island, Lappia, Finmarke, &amp; Norvvay, (which are East from the said place, about 360. Leagues) with greater force, then it did from Cap. de buona Speranca, vpon the fret of Magellan, or from the frete of Magellan to Cap. Fredo, vpon whiche coastes, Iaques Cartier mette with the same, considering the shortnes of the Cut, from the said C. Fredo, to Island, Lappia, &amp;c. And so the cause Efficient remaining,

                   it would haue continually followed along our coastes, through the narrowe seas, which it doth not, but is disgested about the North of Labrador, by some through passage there, thorow this fret.
               
                  
                     Conterenus.
                  The like course of the water, in some respect, happeneth in the Mediterrane Sea (as affirmeth Conterenꝰ) wheras the currant,

which cōmeth from Tanijs, &amp; the sea Euxinus, running along al the coasts of Greece, Italie, Fraunce, and Spaine, and not finding sufficient way out through Gibralter, by meanes of the straitnes of the fret, it runneth back againe, alongst the coasts of Barbarie, by Alexandria, Natolia, &amp;c.
               It may (peraduenture) be thought, that this course of the sea, doth sometime surcease, and therby impugne this principle, because it is not discerned all along the coast of America,
                  
                     An Obiection answered.
                   in such sort as Iaques Cartier found it: Whereunto I answere this: that albeit, in euerie parte of the Coaste of America, or els where, this Currant is not sensibly perceiued, yet, it hath euermore such like motion, either in the vppermost, or nethermost parte of the sea: as it may be proued true, if ye sinke a sayle by a couple of ropes,
                     The Sea doth euermore performe this circular motion, either in Suprema, or concaua superficiae aquae.
                   nere the ground, fastening to ye nethermost corners, two gun chābers, or other weights: by the driuing whereof you shal plainly perceiue, the course of the water, and Currant, running with such like course in the bottome.
               By the like experiment, you may finde the ordinarie motion of the sea, in the Ocean: how farre soeuer you be of the land.
               
                  9 Also there commeth another Currant frō out the Northeast from the Scythian Sea (as M. Iynkinson a man of rare vertue, great trauaile and experience, told me) which runneth Westwarde towardes Labrador, as the other did, which commeth from the South: so that both these Currants, must haue way thorowe this our frete, or else incounter together and runne contrary courses, in one line, but no suche conflictes of streames, or contrary courses are found about any parte of Labrador, or Terra noua, as witnesse our yerely fishers, and other saylers that way, but is there disgested, as aforesaid, and founde by the experience of Barnard de la Tore,
                  
                     Ex Nihilo, nihil sit.
                   to fall into Mare del Sur.
               
               
                  
                     One. and the self same place in the earth, may be both East and West in sundry respects: so that this Oriental motion of the water, is brought to be circular (without repugnancie) by the regular course of Primum Mobile.
                  10 Furthermore, the Currant in the great Ocean, coulde not haue beene mainteined to runne continually one way, from the beginning of the world, vnto this day had there not bene some thorow passage by the frete aforesaide, and so by circular motion, be brought againe to mainteine it selfe: For the Tides, and courses of the Sea, are maintained by their interchangeable motions: as freash riuers are by springes, by ebbing and flovving, by rarifaction and condensation.
               
               
                  So that it resteth not possible (so farre as my simple reason can comprehend) that this perpetual currant,
                     
                        The flowing is occasioned by reason that the heate of the moone boyleth, and maketh the water thinne by way of rarefaction.
                     
                     
                        And the ebbing cōmeth for want of that heate, which maketh the water to fal againe by way of condensation.
                     
                     
                        An experience to prooue the falling of this Currant, into Mare del Sur.
                     
                   can by any means be maintained, but only by continual reaccesse of the same water, which passeth thorow the fret, and is brought about thither againe, by suche Circular motion as aforesaid. And the certaine falling thereof by this fret, into Mare de sur, is proued by the testimonie and experience, of Barnarde del la Torre, who was sent frō 
                  P. del la Natiuita, to the Mulluccae, Anno. Dom. 1542. by cōmandement of Anthonie Mendoza, then Viceroy of Noua Hispania, which Barnarde, sayled 750. Leagues, on the Northside of the AEquator, and there mette with a currant, which came from the Northeast, and droue him backe againe to Tidore.
               
               Wherfore, this currant being proued to come from C. de buona Speranca, to the fret of Magellan, and wanting sufficient entrance there, by narrownes of the straite, is by ye necessitie of natures force, brought to Terra de Labrador, where Iaques Cartier met ye same, &amp; thēce certainly knowen, not to strike ouer vpon Island, Lappia, &amp;c. and founde by Barnarde de la Torre, in Mare del

Sur, on the backeside of America, therefore, this currant (hauing none other passage) must of necessitie, fall out thorow this our fret into Mare del Sur, &amp; so trending by the Mulluccae, China, and C. De buona, speranca, maintaineth itself by circular motiō which is all one in nature, with Motus ab Oriente in Occidentem.
               
               So that it seemeth, we haue now more occasion to doubt of our returne, thē whether there be a passage that way, yea or no: which doubt, hereafter shalbe sufficiently remoued. Wherefore, in mine opinion, reason it selfe, grounded vpon experience, assureth vs of this passage, if there were nothing els to put vs in hope thereof. But least these might not suffise, I haue added in this Chapiter followinge, some further proofe hereof, by the experience of such as haue passed some part of this discouerie: and in the next adioyning to that, the authoritie of those, whiche haue sayled wholy, thorowe euerie part thereof.

                     PAulus Venetus, who dwelt many yeres in Cataia, affirmed that he sailed, 1500 myles, vpon the coastes of Mangia, and Anian, towards the Northeast: alwayes finding the Seas open before him, not onely as farre as he went: but also as far as he could discerne.

                  1 First, as Gemma Frisius reciteth, there went from Europe, 3 brethren through this passage: whereof it tooke the name, of Fretum trium fratrum.

                     2 Also, Plinie affirmeth, out of Cornelius Nepos, (who wrote 57. yeres before Christ) that there were certain Indians driuen by tempest, vpon the coast of Germanie
                     
which were presented by ye King of Sueuia, vnto Quintus Metellus Celer, then Proconsul of Fraunce.
                  
                  3 And Plinie, vpon the same, saith that it is no maruel, though there be Sea by the North, where there is such abundance of moisture: which argueth, that he doubted not of a Nauigable passage that way, thorow which those Indians came.
                  4 And for the better profe, that the same authoritie of Cornelius Nepos, is not by me wrested, to prooue my opinion of the Northvvest passage: you shal finde the same affirmed more plainely in that behalfe,

                      by the excellent Geographer, Dominicus Marius Niger, who sheweth how many wayes the Indian Sea stretcheth it selfe, making in that place, recitall of certaine Indians, that were likewise driuen through the North Seas from India, vpon the coasts of Germanie, by great tempest, as they were sayling in trade of Merchandize.
                  5 Also, whiles Frederic Barbarossa raigned Emperour,
                     
                        Auouched by Franciscus Lopes de Gomar

                            in his historie of India.
                      
                     Anno D. 1160. there came certeine other Indians,vpon the coaste of Germanie.
                  
                  
                     6 Likewise, Othon, in the storie of the Gothes affirmeth, that in the time of the Germane Emperours, ther were, also certain Indians cast by force of weather, vpon the coast of the said Countrey: which foresaid Indians, coulde not possiblie haue come by the Southeast, Southwest, nor from any part of Afrik, or America, nor yet by the Northeast: therfore they came of necessity, by this our Northvvest passage.
               
            
            
               To prooue that these Indians aforenamed, came not by the Southeast, Southvvest, nor from any other part of Afrik, or America. Cap. 5.
               1 
                     FIrst, they coulde not come frō the Southvvest, by C. debuona Speranca, because ye roughnes of the Seas there, are such (occasioned by the Currants, and great windes, in that part) that the greatest Armados, the King of Portingale hath, cannot without great difficulty passe that way: muchlesse then a Canoa of India coulde

liue in those outragious Seas, without Shipwracke (beeing a vessell but of verie small burden) and haue conducted themselues to the place aforesaide, beeing men vnexpert in the Art of Nauigation.
               2 Also, it appeareth plainely, that they were not able, to come from alongest the coast of Afrik aforesaide, to those partes of Europe, because the winds do (for the most part) blow ther Easterlie, of from the shore, and the Currante running that way, in like sort, should haue driuen them VVestvvard, vpon some part of America, for such windes and Tydes, coulde neuer haue led thē from thence, to the said place where they were found, Nor yet could they haue come from any of the Countries aforesaid keeping the Seas alwayes without skilfull Mariners, to haue conducted them such like courses, as were necessarie, to perfourme such a voyage.
               3 Presupposing also, if they had bene driuē to the vvest (as they must haue beene cōming that way) then they should haue perished, wanting supplie of victuals, not hauing any place (once leauing the coaste of Afrik) vntil they came to America: nor

from America, vntil they arriued vpō some part of Europe, or the Ilandes adioyning to it, to haue refreshed themselues.
               4 Also, if (notwithstanding such impossibilities) they might haue recouered Germanie, by comming from India, by the Southeast, yet must they without al doubt, haue striken vpon some other part of Europe, before their arriual there, as the Iles of Madera, Portingal, Spaine, Fraunce, England, Ireland, &amp;c. which if they had done, it is not credible, that they should, or would haue departed, vndiscouered of the inhabitāts: but there was neuer found in these dayes, any such Ship or men, but onely vpon the coasts of Germanie, where they haue bene sundrie times, and in sundrie ages cast a land: Neither is it like, that they woulde haue committed themselues againe to Sea, if they had so arriued, not knowing wher they were, nor whither to haue gon.
               5 And by the Southvvest it is as vnposble, because the currant aforesaide,
                     Why the Indians coulde not come by the Southwest
                   which commeth from the East, striketh with such force vpon the fret of Magellan, and falleth with such swiftnes and furie; into Mare de Sur, that hardly any ship (but not possible

a Canoa, with such vnskilfull Mariners) can come into our vvesterne Ocean, thorow that fret, from the vvest Seas of America, as Magellans experience hathe partly taught vs.
               6 And further, to proue that these people, so arriuing vpō the coast of Germanie, were Indians,
                  
                     That the Indians coulde not be natiues either of Africa, or of America.
                   and not inhabiters of anye part, either of Africa, or America, it is manifest: because the Natiues both of Africa &amp; America, neither had, or haue, at this day (as is reported) other kinde of boates, thē such as do beare neither masts, nor sayls, (except onely vpon the Coastes of Barbarie and the Turks Shippes) but do carie themselues from place to place, neere the shore, by the ore onely.
            
            
               
               ¶To prooue that those Indians came not by the Northeast, &amp; that ther is no thorow Nauigable passage that way. Cap. 6.
               1 
                     IT is lykelie that there should be no thorowe passage by the Northeast, whereby to goe rounde about the world: because al seas (as aforesaide) are maintained by the abundance of water, waxing more shallow and shelffie towards the end, as we finde, it doth by experience, in Mare Glaciali, towards the East, which breedeth smal hope of any great continuance, of that Sea, to be Nauigable towardes the East, sufficient to sayle thereby, rounde about the worlde.

experience had of al the South parts of it shaweth) seeing that some of the inhabitants of this colde Climat (whose summer is to them an extreame winter) haue bene stroken to death,

               3 Furthermore, the pearcing colde of the grose thicke ayre so neere the Pole, will so stiffen and furre the sayles, and shippe tackling, that no Mariner can either hoise or strike them (as our experience farre nerer the South, then this passage is presupposed to be, hath taught vs) without the vse whereof no voyage can be perfourmed.
               4 Also, the ayre is so darkened, with continual mysts, and fogges, so neere the Pole, that no man can well see, either to guide his shippe, or direct his course.
               5 Also the compasse at such eleuation, doth verie sodenly varie: which thinges must of force, haue bene their destructions, although they had beene men of muche more skil then the Indians are.

Iynkinson affirmed vnto me) and therefore it followeth that this Northeast sea, receiuing increase but onely from the VVest, cannot possibly open to the maine Ocean, by the East.

               9 Furthermore, if there were any such sea at that eleuation, of like it should be alwayes frosen throughout (there being no tydes to hinder it) because the extreame coldnes of the ayre in the vppermost part, &amp; the extreame coldnes of the earth in the bottome, the sea there being but of small depth, whereby the one accidental coldnes doth meete with the other, and the sunne not hauinge their reflection so neere the Pole, but at verie blunt angles, it can neuer bee dissolued after it is frosen, notwithstandinge the great length of their day: for that the sunne hath no heate at al in his light, or beams, but proceding only

by an accidentall reflection, whiche there wanteth in effect.
               10 And yet if the sunne were of sufficient force in that eleuation, to preuaile against this Ise, yet must it be brokē before it can be dissolued, which cannot be but through the long continuance of the sunne aboue their Horizon, and by that time the summer woulde be so farre spent, and so great a darkenes and colde insue, that no man could be able to endure so colde, darke, and discomfortable a Nauigation, if it were possible for him then, and there to liue.
               11 Further, the Ise being once broken, it must of force, so driue with the windes and Tydes, that no ship can sayle in those Seas, seeing our 
                     ••
                  shers of Island, and the Nevve found Land, are subiect to daunger, thorowe the great Ilandes of Ise, whiche fleete in the Seas, (to the saylers great daunger) farre to the South of that presupposed Passage.
               12 And it cannot be, that this Northeast passage should be any nerer the South, then before recited, for then it shoulde cut of Ciremissi, and Turbi, Tartarij, with Vzesucani,

Chisani, and others from the Continent of Asia, which are knowen to be adioyning to Scythia, Tartaria, &amp;c. with the other part of the same Continent.
               And if there were any thorough passage by the Northeast, yet were it to small purpose for our traffike, because no shippe of great burden, can Nauigate in so shallowe a Sea: and shippes of small burden are very vnfit and vnprofitable, especially towardes the blusteringe North, to perfourme suche a voyage.
            
            
               
               To prooue that the Indians aforenamed, came onely by the Northvvest, which induceth a certeintie of our passage by experience. Cap. 7.
               
                  
                     IT is as likely, that they came by the Northvvest, as it is vnlikely that they should come, ether by the Southeast, Southvvest, Northeast, or from any other parte of Africa, or America, and therefore this Northvvest passage, hauing bene already so many wayes proued, by disprouing of the others, &amp;c. I shal the lesse nede in this place, to vse many wordes otherwise thē to conclude in this sort, That they came onely by the Northvvest from England: hauinge these many reasons to leade mee therunto.
               
                  1 Firste, the one halfe of the windes of the compasse, might bring them by the Northvvest, vearinge alwayes betweene two sheats, with which kinde of saylinge ye 
                     Indians are only acquainted, not hauing any vse of a bowe, line, or quarter winde,

without ye which no ship can possibly come either by the Southeast, Southwest, or Northeast, hauing so many sundrie capes to double, whereunto are required such chaunge and shift of windes.
                  2 And it seemeth likely, that they should come by the Northvvest, because the Coast whereon they were driuen, lay East from this our passage,
                        True, both in ventis obliquè flantibus as also, in ventis ex diametro spirantibus.
                      
                     And all windes, do naturally driue a Shippe to an opposite point, from vvhence it blovveth, not beeing otherwise guided by Art, which the Indians do vtterly want. And therefore it seemeth, that they came directly thorowe this our fret, which they might doe with one winde.
                  3 For if they had come by Cap. de buona Speranca, then must they (as aforesaid) haue fallen vpon the South partes of America.
                  
                  4 And if by the fret of Magellan, then vpon the coastes of Afrik, Spaine, Portingal, Fraunce, Ireland, or England.
                  
                  
                     5 And if by the Northeast, then vpon the coasts of Cerecinissi
                              •
                            Tartarij, Lappia, Island, Terra de Labrador, &amp;c. &amp; vpon these coasts, (aforesaid) they haue neuer bene found.
                     
                        So that by all likelyhood, they coulde neuer haue come, without shipwracke, vppon the coasts of Germanie, if they had first striken vpon the coastes of so manie countreys, wanting both Art and shipping, to make orderly discouerie: and altogether ignorant both in the Art of Nauigation, &amp; also of the Rockes, Flats, Sands, or Hauens of those parts of the world, which in most of these places are plentifull.
                  
                  
                     6 And further it seemeth very likely, that the inhabitants of the most parte of those countries, by which they must haue come, any other way besides, by the Northvvest, being for the most part Anthropophagi, or men eaters, woulde haue deuoured them, slaine them, or (at the leaste wise) kept them as wonders for the gaze.
                     So that it plainly appeareth, that those Indians (which, as you haue heard, in sundrie ages were driuen by tempest, vpon the shore of Germanie) came onely through our Northvvest passage.
                  
                  
                     7 Moreouer, the passage is certeinely prooued, by a Nauigation that a Portingal made, who passed thorow this fret: giuing

name to a Promontorie far within the same, calling it after his owne name, Promontoria Corterialis, neere adioyning vnto Polisacus fluui
                              •
                           s.
                     
                  
                  8 Also one Scolmus a Dane, entred and passed a great part thereof.
                  9 Also there was one Salua Terra, a Gentleman of Victoria, in Spaine, that came by chaunce out of the VVest Indians, into Ireland, Anno, 1568. who affirmed the Northvvest passage from vs to Cataia, constantly to be beleeued in America, Nauigable. And further said, in the presence of S. Henry Sidney (the Lord Deputie of Ireland) in my hearing, that a Frier of Mexico, called Andro Vrdaneta, more then viij. yeares, before his then comming into Ireland, tolde him there, that he came from Mare de Sur into Germanie, through this Northvvest passage, &amp; shewed Salua Terra (at that time beeing then with him in Mexico) a Sea Carde made by his owne experience, and trauel, in that voyage: wherin was plainly set downe and described, this Northwest passage: agreeing in al pointes with Hortelius Mappe.
               
               
                  And further, this Frier, tolde the King of Portingal, (as he returned by that countrey homewarde) that there was (of certaintie) suche a passage, Northvvest from England, and that he ment to publishe the same: which done, the King most earnestly desired him, not in any wise to disclose, or make the passage knowen to any Nation: For that (said the King) If England had knovvledge,
                  
                     The wordes of the King of Portingal, to Andro Vrdaneta a Frier, touchinge the concealing of this Northwest passage From Englād to Cataia.
                   
                  and experience thereof, it vvould greatly hinder both the King of Spaine, and me. This Frier (as Salua Terra reported) was the greatest Discouerer by sea, that hath bene in our age. Also Salua Terra, beinge perswaded, of this passage by the Frier Vrdaneta, and by the common opinion of the Spaniardes, inhabiting America, offered most willingly to accompanie me in this Discouerie: which of like hee woulde not haue done, if he had stoode in doubt thereof.
               And now as these moderne experiences, cannot be impugned: So, least it might be obiected, that these thinges (gathered out of auncient writers,
                     An Obiection
                   which wrote so many yeres past) might serue little to proue this passage, by the North of America, because both America and India, were to them then vtterly vnknowen to remoue this doubt,

let this suffise:
                     Aristotle. lib. de mundo, cap. secund.
                   That Aristotle, (who was 300. yeres before Christ) named Mare Indicum. Also Berosus
                  
                     Berosus lib. 5.
                   (who liued 330 yeres before Christ) hath these words, e Ganges in India. Also in the first Chapter of Hester be these words, In the dayes of Assuerus which ruled from India, to AEthiopia: which Assuerus liued 580 yeres before christ. Also Quintus Curtius (where he speaketh of the Conquests of Alexander) mēcioneth India. Also, Arianꝰ Philostratus, &amp; Sidrach in his discourses of the warres of the king of Bactria, &amp; of Garaab, who had the most part of India vnder his gouernmēt. Al which assureth vs, that both India, and Indians were knowen in those dayes.
               These things cōsidered, we may (in my opinion) not only assure our selues of this passage, by ye 
                  Northwest, but also yt it is nauigable, both to come &amp; goe, as hath beene proued in part &amp; in al, by the experience of diuers, as Sebastian Gabota, Corterialis, the three brethren aboue named, the Indians, and Vrdaneta the Frier of Mexico, &amp;c.
               
               And yet notwithstanding al which, there be some that haue a better hope of this passage to Cataia, by ye 
                  Northeast, then by ye 
                  vvest: whose reasons, with my seuerall answers, ensue in the Chapter following.
            
            
               
               Certaine reasons, alledged for the prouing of a passage by the Northeast, before the Queenes Maiestie, and certaine Lordes of the Counsell, with my seuerall answeres, then vsed to the same. Cap. 8.
               
                  
                     BEcause you may vnderstande, aswell those thinges alledged against me, as what doth serue for my purpose, I haue here added the reasons of a worthy Gentleman, and a great traueller, who conceiued a better hope of the passage to Cataia, from vs, to bee by the Northeast, then by the Northvvest: whom I haue not named in this place, because I seeke to impngne his opinions, as followeth.
               
                  
                     The Northwest Passage assented vnto.
                  He first said, that he thought not to the contrarie, but that there was a passage by the Northvvest, according to mine opinion: But assured he was, that there might be founde a Nauigable passage, by the Northeast from England, to go to al the

                  East partes of the worlde: which he endeuoured to prooue three wayes.
               The first was,
                     The first reason.
                   that he heard a fisherman of Tartaria say, in hunting the Morce, that he sayled very far towards the Southeast,
                  
                     The Morce, is a kinde of fish which the Tartarians do often hunt by water &amp; greatly seeke to kil
                   finding no ende of the Sea: whereby hee hoped a thorowe passage to bee that way.
               Whereunto I answered, that the Tartarians were a barbarous people,
                     The answere, or resolution.
                   and vtterly ignorant in the Art of Nauigation, not knowing the vse of the sea, Carde, cō
                  passe, or starre, which he confessed true: and therefore they coulde not (saide I) certainly know the Southeast, from the Northeast, in a wide sea, and a place vnknowen, from the sight of the land.
               Or if he sailed any thing nere the shore, yet he (being ignorant) might be deceiued by the doubling of many points &amp; Capes, and by the trending of the land: Albeit he kept continually alongst the shore.
               And further, it might be, that the poore fisherman through simplicitie, thought that there was nothing that way but sea,

because he saw no land: which proofe (vnder correction) giueth smal assurance of a Nauigable sea by the Northeast, to goe round about the worlde,
                     Visus no

                         obiecio.
                   
                  For that he iudged by the eye onely, seeinge wee in this out cleare ayre doe accompt 20 myles a ken at Sea.
               
                  
                     The second reason or allegation.
                  His second reason is, that there was a Vnicornes horne founde vpon the coaste of Tartaria, which could not come (saide he) thither, by any other meanes, then with the Tides, through some fret in the Northeast of Mare Glaciale, there being no Vnicorne in any parte of Asia, sauing in India, &amp; Cataia: which reason (in my simple iudgement) forceth as litle.
               First it is doubtful, whether those barbarous Tartarians doe know an Vnicorns horne,
                     The answere, or resolution.
                   ye, or no: and if it were one, yet it is not credible, that the sea could haue driuē it so farre, being of such nature that it will not swimme.
               Also the Tydes running to and froe, would haue driuen it as farre backe with the ebbe, as it brought it forwarde with the fludde.
               
                  There is also a beast called Asinus Indicus (whose horne most like it was) whiche hath but one horne,
                     Omne 
                           〈…〉
                         est idem.
                   like an Vnicorne, in his forehead, whereof there is great plentie, in al the North parts therevnto adioyning: as in Lappia, Noruegia, Finmarke, &amp;c. as Iacobus Zeiglerus writeth, in his historie of Scondia.
               
               And as Albertus saith,
                     Nulla ratio, ab Ambiguo ceri
                           •
                         sed 
                           〈◊〉
                        .
                   there is a fishe, which hath but one horne in his forehead like to an Vnicorne, and therfore it seemeth very doubtful, both from whence it came, and whether it were an Vnicornes horne, yea, or no.
               His thirde and last reason was,
                     The thirde and last reason or Assertion. Colmaxes are a people inhabiting the North part of Asia.
                   that there came a continual streame, or currant through Mare Glaciale, of such swiftnesse (as a Colmax tolde him) that if you cast any thing therin, it would presently be caried out of sight, towards the VVest.
               
               Wherunto I answered,
                     The answere, or resolution.
                   that there doth the like from Maeotis Palus, by Pontus Euxinus, Sinus, Bosphorus, and along the coaste of Graecia, &amp;c. As it is affirmed by Contarenus, and diuers others, that haue had experience of the same: and yet that sea, lieth

not open to any maine sea that way, but is maintained by fresshets, as by Tanijs, Danubius, &amp;c.
               
               In like maner is this currant in Mare Glaciale increased, and maintained, by the Volgo, the riuer Oby, &amp;c.
               
               Now as I haue here briefly recited the reasons alledged, to prooue a passage to Cataia, by the Northeast, with my seuerall answeres thereunto: so will I leaue it to your iudgement, to hope or dispaire of either, at your pleasure.
            
            
               
               ¶ How that the passage by the Northvvest, is more commodious for our traffik, then the other by the East: if there were any such. Cap. 9.
               1 
                     FIRST, by the Northeaste (if your windes doe not giue you a marueylous speedie, and luckie passage) you are in daunger (being so nere the Pole) to be benighted, almost the one halfe of the yeare, and what miserie and daunger that were, to liue so long comfortlesse, voyde of light, (if the colde killed you not) eche man of reason or vnderstanding may iudge.
               2 Also Mangia, Quingit, and the Mollucoae, are neerer vnto vs by the Northvvest, then by the Northeast, more then 2/5 parts which is almost by the halfe.
               3 Also wee may haue by the VVest, a yerely returne, it being at al times Nauigable, wheras you haue but six moneths, in the whole yere, to goe by the Northeast:
                  
the passage beinge at such eleuation, as it is formerly expressed, for it cannot be any neerer the South.
               
               4 Furthermore, it cannot be finished without diuers wintrings by the way, hauing no hauens in any temperate Climate, to harbour in ther. For it is as much as we can well sayle, from hence to S. Nicholas, in the trade of Muscouia, and return in the Nauigable season of the yeare, and frō 
                  S. Nicholas to Cerimissi Tartarij, which standeth at 80 degrees of the Septentrional latitude, it is at the least 400 Leagues, which amounteth scarce to the thirde part of the way, to the ende of your voyage by the Northeast.
               
               5 And yet after you haue doubled this Cape, if then there might be found a nauigable sea, to cary you Southeast, according to your desire, yet can you not winter conueniently, vntil you come to 60 degrees, &amp; to take vp one degree running Southeast, you must sayle 24 leagues ¾ which amounteth to 495 leagues.
               6 Furthermore, you may by the Northwest, saile thither with al Easterly winds, &amp; returne with any vvesterly windes, wheras

you must haue by the Northeast sundrie windes, &amp; those proper, accordinge to the lying of the coastes and capes, you shalbe inforced to double, which windes are not alwayes to be had, when they are looked for: wherby your iourney should be greatly prolonged, and hardly endured so nere the Pole. As we are taught by Sir Hugh VViloughbie, who was frosē to death far nerer the South.
               
               7 Moreouer, it is very doubtfull, whether we should long inioy that trade by ye 
                  Northeast, if there were any such passage that way, the cōmodities therof once knowen to the Muscouite, what priuelege soeuer he hath graunted, seeing policie with the Maze of excessiue gaine, to the enriching (so greatly) of himselfe and all his dominions, would persuade him to resume the same, hauing so great opportunitie, to vtter the commodities of those countreys by the Narue.
               
               But by the Northvvest, wee may safely trade without daunger, or anoyance, of any prince liuing, Christian, or heathen, it being out of al their trades.
               8 Also ye 
                  Queenes Maiesties dominions, are nerer the Northwest passage, them any

other great princes that might passe that way, and both in their going and returne, they must of necessitie succour themselues and their shippes, vpon some parte of the same, if any tempestious weather shoulde happen.
               Further, no Princes Nauie of the world, is able to encounter the Queenes Maiesties Nauie, as it is at this present: and yet it should be greatly increased, by the traffike ensuing vpon this discouerie, for it is the long voyages, that increase and maintaine great shipping.
               Now it seemeth necessarie, to declare what commodities would grow thereby, if al these things were, as we haue heretofore presupposed, &amp; thought them to be: which next adioyning are briefly declared.
            
            
               
               ¶ VVhat commodities woulde ensue, this passage once discouered. Cap. 10.
               1 
                     FIrst, it were the onely way for our princes, to possesse ye welth of all the East partes (as they tearme them) of the worlde, which is infinite: as appeareth by the experience of Alexander the great, in the time of his conquest of India, and other the East partes of the worlde, alledged by Quintus Curtius, which would be a great aduauncement to our Countrie, wonderfull inriching to our Prince, and vnspeakeable commodities to all the inhabitants of Europe.
               
               2 For through the shortnesse of the voyage, we should be able to sell all maner of Merchandize, brought from thence, far better cheape, then either the Portingal, or Spaniarde doth, or may doe: And further, share with the Portingal in the East, &amp; the Spaniarde in the VVest, by trading to any part of America, through Mare de Sur, wher they can no maner of way offend vs.
               
                  3 Also we may saile to diuers marueilous riche Countries, both Ciuil and others, out of both their iurisdictions, trades &amp; traffiks, where ther is to be foūd great aboundance of gold, siluer, precious stones, Cloth of golde, silkes, all maner of Spices, Grocery wares, and other kindes of Merchandize, of an inestimable price: which both the Spaniarde, and Portingal, through the length of their iourneys, can not well attaine vnto.
               4 Also we might inhabite some parte of those Countreys, and settle there suche needie people of our Countrie, which now trouble the common welth, and through want here at home, are inforced to commit outragious offences, whereby they are dayly consumed with the Gallowes.
               5 Moreouer, we might from all the aforesaid places, haue a yerely retourne, inhabiting for our staple some conuenient place of America, about Sierra Neuada, or some other part, wheras it shal seeme best for the shortening of the voyage.
               6 Beside the vttering of our Countrie commodities, which the Indians, &amp;c. much

esteeme: as appeareth in Hester where the pompe is expressed,
                     Hester. cap. 1.
                   of the great King of India, Assuerus, who matched the coloured clothes, wherewith his houses and tents, were apparelled, with golde and siluer, as part of his greatest treasure: not mencioning either veluets, silkes, cloth of golde, cloth of siluer, or suche like, being in those countreys most plentiful: wherby it plainly appeareth, in what great estimation, they woulde haue the clothes of this our countrey, so that there would be founde a farre better vent for them, by this means, then yet this realme euer had: and that without depending, either vpon Fraunce, Spaine, Flaunders, Portingal, Hamborovve, Emdem, or any other part of Europe.
               
               7 Also, hereby we shall increase, both our shippes, and mariners, without burdening of the state.
               8 And also haue occasion, to set poore mens children, to learne handie craftes, &amp; therby to make trifles and such like, which the Indians and those people doe muche esteeme: By reason whereof, there should be none occasion, to haue our countrey combred with loyterers, vagabonds, and such like idle persons.
               
                  All these commodities would growe, by following this our Discouerie, without iniurie done to any Christian prince, by crossing them in any of their vsed trades, whereby they might take any iust occasion of offence.
               Thus haue I briefly shewed you, some part of the groundes of mine opinion, trusting that you wil no longer iudge me fantastike in this matter: seeing I haue conceiued no hope of this voyage, but am persuaded thereunto, by the best Cosmographers of our age, the same being confirmed, both by reason and certaine experiences.
               Also this discouerie, hath bene diuers times heretofore by others, both offered attempted, and perfourmed.
               It hath bene offred by Stephen Gomes vnto Carolus the fifth Emperour, in the yere of our Lord God 1527. as Alphōso Vlloa testifieth, in ye story of Carolus life: who would haue set him forth in it (as the storie mencioneth) if ye great want of money, by reasō of his long warres, had not caused him to surcesse the same.
               
                  And the King of Portingal, fearing lest the Emperour woulde haue perseuered in this his enterprise, gaue him, to leaue the matter vnattempted,
                     This discouerie offered.
                   the sum of 350000 Crownes: and it is to be intended that the King of Portingal, would not haue giuen to the Emperour, such summes of money for egges in mooneshine.
               It hath bene attempted by Corterialis the Portingal,
                  
                     This discouerie attempted.
                   
                  Scolmus the Dane, and by Sebastian Gabota, in the time of King Henry the seuenth.
               And it hath beene perfourmed,
                     This discouerie perfourmed.
                   by the three brethren, the Indians aforesaide, and by Vrdaneta, the Frier of Mexico.
               
               Also diuers haue offered the like, vnto the Frenche King, who hath sent two or three times to haue discouered the same. The discouerers, spending &amp; consuming their victuals, in searching the gulfes, &amp; bayes, betweene Florida, and Terra de Labrador, whereby the Ise is broken to the after commers.
               So that the right way, may now easily be founde out, in short time: and that

with litle ioperdie and lesse expences.
               For America is discouered, so farre towards the North as Cape Fredo, which is at 62 degrees, and that part of Grondland next adioyning,
                     The labour of this discouerie shortened by other mens trauel.
                   is knowen to stand but at 72. So that we haue but 10 degrees, to sayle North and South, to put the worlde out of doubt hereof: and it is likely, that the King of Spaine, and the King of Portingal, would not haue sate out al this while, but that they are sure to possesse to themselues, all that trade they now vse, and feare to deale in this Discouerie, least the Queenes Maiestie, hauing so good opportunitie, and finding the commoditie, which thereby might ensue to the common welth: woulde cutte them of, and enioye the whole traffique to her selfe, and thereby the Spaniardes and Portingals, with their great charges,
                     Why the king of Spaine and Portingal would not perseuer in this discouerie.
                   should but beate the bushe, and other men catche the birds: which thinge they foreseeing, haue commaunded, that no Pylate of theirs, vpon payne of death, shoulde seeke to discouer to the Northvvest, or platte out in any sea carde, any thorowe passage that way, by the Northvvest.
               
               
                  Now, and if you wil indifferently, compare the hope that remaineth, to animate me to this enterprise, with those likelihoodes which Columbus alledged before Ferdinando, the King of Castilia, to prooue that there were such Ilands in the vvest Ocean, as were after, by him and others discouered, to the great commoditie of Spaine and all the worlde: you will thinke then this Northwest passage, to be most worthy trauell therein.
               For Columbus had none of the west Ilāds set forth vnto him, either in globe, or card, neither yet once mencioned of any writer, (Plato excepted, and the commentaries vpon the same) from 942 yeres before Christ, vntil that day.
               Moreouer, Columbus himself, had neither seene America or any other of the Ilands about it, neither vnderstoode he of them, by the report of any other that had seene thē, but onely cōforted himself with this hope, that the land had a beginninge, where the sea had an ending: For as touching that, which the Spaniards doe write of a Biscaine, which shuld haue taught hiī ye way thither, it is thought to be imagined of thē, to depriue

                  Columbus of his honour, beeing none of their countrey men, but a stranger borne.
               And if it were true of the Biscaine, yet did he but roue at the matter, or (at the least) gathered the knowledge of it, by coniectures onely.
               And albeit, my selfe haue not seene this passage, or any part thereof, but am ignorant of it as touching experience, (as Columbus was before his attempt made) yet haue I, both the report, relation, and authoritie, of diuers most credible mē, which haue both seene and passed through some, and euerie part of this discouerie: besides sundrie reasons, for my assurance thereof: all which Columbus wanted.
               These things considered, and indifferently wayed together, with the wonderful cōmodities which this discouerie may bring, especially to this realme of England: I must needes conclude with Hieronimus Fracastoriꝰ, &amp; diuers other learned mē, who said, that this discouerie hath beene reserued, for some noble Prince, or worthy mā, therby to make himselfe rich, &amp; the world happie: desiringe you to accept in good

part, this briefe and simple discourse, written in hast, which if I may perceiue, that it shal not sufficiently satisfie you in this behalfe, I will then imparte vnto you a large discourse, which I haue written only of this discouerie.
               And further, because it sufficeth not, onely to know that such a thing there is, without abilitie to perfourme the same, I wil at more leasure make you partaker, of another simple discourse of Nauigation, wherein I haue not a litle trauelled, to make my selfe as sufficient, to bring these things to effect, as I haue bene readie to offer my selfe therein.
               And therein I haue deuised to amende the errours of vsuall sea cardes, whose cō
                  mō fault is, to make the degrees of longitude, in euerie latitude, of one like bignes.
               And haue also deuised therein, a Spherical instrument, with a compasse of variation, for the perfect knowing of the longitude.
               And a precise order to prick the sea carde, together with certaine infallible rules for

the shortening of any discouerie, to know at the first entring of any fret, whether it lye open to the Ocean, more wayes then one, how farre soeuer the sea stretcheth it selfe, into the land.
               Desiring you hereafter, neuer to mislike with me, for the taking in hand of any laudable and honest enterprise, for if through pleasure or idlenes we purchase shame, ye pleasure vanisheth, but the shame remaineth for euer.
               And therefore to giue me leaue without offence, alwayes to liue and die in this minde,

                  That he is not vvorthie to liue at all, that for feare, or daunger of death, shunneth his countrey seruice, and his ovvne honour. seeing death is ineuitable, and the fame of vertue immortall. Wherfore in this behalfe, Mutare vel timere sperno.
               
            
            FINIS.
