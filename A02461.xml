            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            THE EPISTLE TO the Reader.
            
               IT hath bin (Christian Reader) in the chiefe of my deſires, to ſeeke the peace of this church &amp; kingdome in which wee liue: to that end, being called to ſpeak at a viſitation vnto my brethrē. I choſe to intreate of thoſe words in the Pſalme: O pray for the peace of Ieruſalem: let them proſper that loue her. In the vnfolding of which, according to that meaſure of grace, that God had giuen me; I ſought with all mildnes, to perſwade thoſe of my brethren (whoſe labours hath bin moſt fruitfull in the Lord) that for a Croſſe

and a Surpleſſe, they would not forſake the worke of their God, nor defraud the people of their charge, of that bleſſed comfort which by their preaching they once receaued. At this I aimed, and their vntimely ſilence (which after followed) I then greatly feared. Thus my loue to them, and the houſe of our God, imboldned me to ſpeak, that which Cartwright, Beza, and other of reuerend memory, before had deliuered: that it was better to vndergoe thoſe diſliked ceremonies, then for them to forſake their calling, to deſpiſe the flocke of Christ Ieſus, ouer which the holy Ghost had made them ouerſeers. For the queſtion then was not (as ſome cōceaued) what in thoſe ceremonies was conuenient; that was by our rulers before ouerruled: but what in this caſe, was for vs, and Gods Church moſt expedient: whether with them to continue, the

worke of our ministrie, or by our refuſing to yeeld cōformity to them, to betray the people of our charge, &amp; to neglect that holy functiō, vnto which God had called vs. This was the queſtion; to this, not only for the better ſatisfying of men, but of our God; wee were to anſwere. And although thou ſeemeſt to the world for thy excuſe, to lay the cauſe and blame of this thy ſilence vpon thy rulers; becauſe they will not permit to thee the exerciſe of thy miniſtrie, except thou ſubmit thy ſelf vnto thoſe their impoſed ceremonies: yet becauſe thou art to anſwere, not ſo much for thy rulers and their doings, as for thy ſelfe and thy doings vnto thy God; enter into the chamber of thy conſcience, there ſeriouſly conſider, whether (the Magiſtrate commāding theſe) it be better for thee, to forſake theſe together with thy miniſtrie; or with theſe, (although with thy diſtaſt

and ſome diſlike) to continue thy bleſſed labours in the croſſe of God. This is that, on which wee ſhould eſpecially looke, what vpon their command is beſt beſeeming vs to doe. O let Gods glory and the good of his Church, ſo farre as it may be, euer weigh with vs. I doubt not but that thou wilt ſay, ſo it ſhall euer be with thee: but yet thou replieſt, thou maieſt not doe euill that good may come thereof; that God will haue his glory ſought by ſuch meanes which he approueth: this that is impoſed is not that which God approueth, nay it is euil. This thing is in queſtiō, &amp; many (thou knoweſt) haue laboured to proue that they are not euil, that they are not ſuch which God hath diſallowed. I am not now to reaſō this matter, I refer thee vnto that which hath bin writen. Only now ſummō thy ſelf vnto the iuſtice ſeate of thine owne conſcience (and all preiudice and affection

ſet apart, all regard of men, &amp; reſpect of thy former ſpeeches and doings laid aſide) I pray thee, in that light that God hath giuen thee, anſwere to thine owne ſoule, whether theſe rites ſeeme to her to be ſimplie euill; or whether ſhee doth not repute them in a ſort indifferent. If vpon this ſummons, thy conſcience telleth thee that they are euill;
                  Rom. 14.1 I do not perſwade thee to ſinne againſt thy conſcience; to thee that reputest them to be euill, they are euill. Yet let not thy conſcience preiudice the liberty of thy Chriſtian brother, neither do thou condemne the perſons of other as euill and corrupt; which in their obedience to theſe, are not of the ſame mind and conſcience with thy ſelfe: for thou maieſt be deceaued, and God may ſhew his truth to them. Howſoeuer true muſt bee that oracle of truth,1. Cor. 1

enuieth not, loue doth not boaſt itſelf, is not puffed vp, diſdaineth not, ſeeketh not her owne, is not prouoked to anger, thinketh no euill. By our cognizance of loue, let it be knowne to whom we appertaine: let vs not forget of what ſpirit we are, but according to the rule of the Apoſtle, If it bee poſſible,

               as much as in vs lieth, let vs ſeek to haue peace with all men. For when wee ſeeke to depraue the writings and ſpeeches one of another, and to enforce another meaning in theſe then was intended, or the letter beareth: when our mouthes are full of raylings, and bitter ſpeakings, and our perſons are become vile one to another: when we make it our ſtudies by miſreports and falſe ſuggeſted ſlanders, to make one the other odious to the world, &amp; leaue in our writings remēbrances of our ſhame: where is that true loue, the very grace of

Christians, which with griefe remembreth her brothers falls, and ſeeketh to hide and couer his ſhame? Where is that ſpirit of Chriſt? of meekenes, patience and humility? by which, and not by fiery and reproachful ſpeakings, the world was first conuerted to the faith. Where is that true zeale of Gods glory? that tender care of the weake brethren? that deſire to ſtoppe the mouthes of the ſlaundering Papists, and ſcoffing Atheiſts? Alas theſe vnſeemely, galfull, and malice-ſhewing ſpeeches, as darke clouds obſcure the truth of Chriſts Goſpel; theſe as thorns in their eyes wound the conſciences of the weake, making them to thinke and ſay that ſuch bitter waters cannot flow from the profeſſors of Gods truth; theſe make Gath and Askalon of the vncircumciſed to reioyce, and giue great aduātage to their cloſe-followed cauſe. Theſe ſtirre vp our vnſeaſoned

affections, that whileſt wee ſeeke with contumelie to returne that was ill ſpoken, wee giue new occaſions to heare worſe. Theſe are not the weapons of our ſpirituall warfare, with which our Dauids men beloued of God, ſhould fight the battails of their Lord. Wherfore, ô my brethren, although wee cannot accord in one tune, and with that ſame mind acknowledge theſe impoſed ceremonies: yet let vs not forget the ſpirit, peace, and loue of Chriſtians; let vs not giue way to our haſtie affections: but rather let vs endeuour, to ſeeke the truth by ſuch meanes, and in ſuch a manner, as the word of truth preſcribeth: ſo will God giue a bleſsing to our endeuours, and we ſhall find after our long and many diſagreeings, Gods bleſſed peace and comfort in our ſoules. The which God giue vs in theſe our daies to ſee, to the good of his Church, and glory of his great name. Amen.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            A SERMON PRINCIpally entreating of the Croſſe in Baptiſme.
            
            
               Pſal. 122. verſ. 6.
               O pray for the peace of Jeruſalem: let them proſper that loue thee.
            
            
               AS the Apoſtle requireth of euery Chriſtian, that hee ſhould be readie to giue a reaſon of his faith: ſo is it expected that we of the miniſtrie ſhould of our doings, eſpecially ſince of vs many are hardly cenſured by ſome of our brethrē, &amp; not wel reported of many of the people, for yeelding our obediēce vnto thoſe, lōg ſince impoſed, but late exacted ceremonies. In regard wherof, as in my former Sermon, I ſpake vnto you of the lawful vſe of the white linnen garmēt, vſed by the auncient Fathers in the time of Diuine ſeruice in the Church:

ſo am I at this time according to my promiſe, to entreate of the lawfull vſe of the Croſſe, which on the baptiſed is impoſed. In the hādling of the which, that I may the more diſtinctly proceed; firſt I will ſhew vnto you, that ſince the Croſſe is no part of the ſubſtance of Baptiſme, that therefore they that are baptiſed with it, or without it, are in reſpect of the ſubſtance of Baptiſme, perfectly baptiſed. Secondly, that the ancient Fathers in their times, vſed to ſigne with the Croſſe them that were baptiſed. Thirdly, we will conſider of the reaſons, that moued the Fathers ſo to do. Fourthly, we will ſhew, that ſince there are two kinds of Croſſes (as the Schoole-men ſpeake) the one manent, the other tranſient; the one materiall, the other acreall, that ſomewhat in the Fathers times, but much more ſince they both haue been ſinfully abuſed, the one to Idolatrie, the other to ſuperſtition. Fifthly, that therefore they of our Fathers, and other reformed Churches did not ill, which haue wholy taken away the vſe

of the Croſſe, which in former ages was ſo ſinfully abuſed. Sixthly, that yet we of the miniſtrie well may, ſince by the gouernors of our Church it is impoſed, ſigne our baptiſed with the ſign of the Croſſe, as the Fathers did, ſo it be freed from ſuperſtition, the opinion of merit, and neceſſity. Laſtly, I will ſeeke to free my ſelfe from that vntrue imputation, with which the compiler of the abridgment of the Apologie of the Miniſters of Lincolne Dioceſſe,The abridgement of the Apologie of the Miniſters of Lincolne Dioces. pag. 25. to the Kings Maieſtie; amongſt many other reuerēd in their place, doth brand me, either for a dāgerous corrupter of the purity of doctrine, or a broacher of a Popiſh errors in that in my former Sermon vpon this text I ſaid, that Austine, to whom Gregory the great did write, was the conuerter of our Engliſh nation. Of theſe briefely, and firſt of the firſt.That the Croſſe is not of the ſubſtance of Baptiſme; therefore not abſolutely nece

            In the holy Sacrament of Baptiſme, ſome things are of the eſſence, ſubſtance, and being of Baptiſme (which if in Baptiſme they be wanting, then it is not, nor may well be called the Baptiſme

of Chriſt) as to be baptiſed with water, and to be baptiſed in the name of the Father, Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt: theſe Chriſt ordeined to be of the matter and forme of his Baptiſme, without which Chriſts Baptiſme can no more be ſaid to be, then an houſe without his forme &amp; matter, or a man without a ſoule and body. This Baſil acknowledged when to the queſtion whether it were a ſufficient Baptiſme to baptiſe in the name of the holy Ghoſt only,

                he anſwereth no: For (ſaith he) the tradition giuē in the liuing grace must continue immoueable, for he which hath freed our life from corruption, hath giuen vnto vs his regenerating power, which power hath a cauſe which cannot be expreſſed, hidden in this Sacrament; yet bringing health vnto our ſoules: wherefore to adde or to detract from it, is euen a fall from eternall life. Where marke to baptiſe in the name of the holy Ghoſt only, is not a ſufficient Baptiſme: ſecondly the tradition muſt continue immoueable: thirdly to adde or detract from it, is to fall away from

eternall life.Zanchius tra

                The ſame witneſſeth Zanchius, of our moderne writers moſt iudicious. If any be baptiſed in the name of the Father, leauing out and omitting the name of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt; the ſame is not ſigned with the Baptiſme of Christ: and then, as the ſaid Zanchius in another place ſpeaketh,Idem lib. 1. d

               He that is baptiſed with a Baptiſme not ordeined of God, as hee hath not the true outward ſigne of the Couenant, no more ſhal he enioy the thing it ſelfe, or the benefits of the Couenant; there is but one Baptiſme.
               
                  Epheſ. 4.5. That therefore is of the eſſence &amp; ſubſtance of Baptiſme, which Chriſt ordeined, vnto which nothing may bee added as part of the ſubſtance; nor from which nothing that is of the ſubſtance may bee detracted: for then it leaueth to be the Baptiſme of Chriſt, and it becommeth the Baptiſme of man, whoſe ſtampe it beareth.
            Other rites there are vſed in Baptiſme, which are not of the ſubſtance of Baptiſme, neither may they bee ſo reputed. Wherof ſome may be vſed in the Church of God, others may not.

Of the firſt ſort are, whether the baptiſed is to be dipped vnder the water, or to haue water powred or ſprinckled on; whether to bee thriſe dipped or once; whether to bee ſigned with the ſigne of the Croſſe, or not to be ſigned, and ſuch like of theſe rites, although ſome are rather to be vſed then other, and are in their nature to be preferred before the other, as ſundry Ierom. in E

               thou must not vnderstand that it is of the neceſſitie

of Baptiſme, that the baptiſed bee dipped; for Baptiſme may well be performed, either by the manner of powring or ſprinckling on water, especially when the custome of the Church approueth it, or there bee ſome neceſſitie in it, either for want of water, or weaknes of the baptiſed, or feeblenes in the Minister, not well able for to dippe the child. The truth of which may the better appeare, if wee attentiuely conſider,
                  Act. 2.4. how thoſe three thouſand in the ſtorie of the Acts were baptiſed, ſurely in probability of reaſon not by dipping vnder the water, but rather by powring or ſprinckling on of water.
            Other rites alſo there are, which although they be not of the Papiſts, reputed to bee of the ſubſtance of Baptiſme, but rather de ſolemnitate (for his better grace and credit,Joan. Pech

                that ſo the people might conceiue better, and more reuerētly of it) as exorciſing and blowing on the baptiſed, the giuing to him ſalt, the touching his noſe and eares with ſpittle, the anoynting of his breſt and ſhoulders, the oyling of the crown

of his head, the often croſſing, the giuing to him a white garment, a burning taper, and ſuch like. Yet becauſe theſe much haue corrupted the ſimple, pure, and naked inſtitution of Chriſt, &amp; made the people to haue in greater reuerence theſe deuiſed ceremonies, then Chriſts bleſſed Sacrament; ſuch ſuperſtitious fanſies of men, were worthily abandoned out of the Church, &amp; in the miniſtring of this Sacrament, not thought fit to be continued. And yet ſince many of the fauorits of Rome, haue not reputed theſe rites, to bee of the ſubſtance or neceſſity of Baptiſme, but that only which our Sauiour in his Goſpell inſtituted; declaring in many their writings, that there was a time when in Baptiſme theſe were not vſed, &amp; diuers times when theſe diuers rites were brought into the church; for they were not all borne and hatched in one day: it hath been the iudgement of the Church of God, that they which haue been baptiſed in the Church of Rome (notwithſtanding thoſe her many ſuperſtitiōs in this Sacrament vſed) haue

in reſpect of the ſubſtāce of Baptiſme, been truly baptiſed, and ought not againe to bee baptiſed of vs:Zanch. explicat. ni 5. cap. a

                ſo Zanchius, They do impiouſly and vnskilfully which either in the Church of Rome, or in our Churches (hee meaneth the reformed) do cauſe them that are rightly baptiſed, againe for to bee baptiſed. Thus then you ſee that the Croſſe in Baptiſme, is not of the ſubſtance of Baptiſme, for Chriſt remembreth it not in the inſtitution of Baptiſme, neither is it mentioned in the ſtory of the Actes, where yet many are ſaid to bee baptiſed: but added after as a conuenient rite. This therefore if any wanted, yet were they fully baptiſed, &amp; if any had it; yet then had they nothing more of the ſubſtance of Baptiſme, then the other: and therefore they both were rightly &amp; fully reputed to be baptiſed.

but a full Iury; not forced to ſpeake that which they neuer meant, but freely deliuering their owne meanings; nor ſpeaking at randome of the Croſſe in generall, but properly in particular of the Croſſe in Baptiſme; of whom the firſt is Baſil ſurnamed the Great, who ſeeking to proue that ſome rites were to be receaued from the tradition of the Apostles, which are not expreſſely ſet downe in the letter of the word, and yet then were in vſe in the Church of God;

                The ſecond is Iustin Martyr, who, to the queſtion why Chriſtians, when they prayed turned to the Eaſt, gaue for anſwere, becauſe that (in the opinion of men the Sun there riſing) was the more worthie part, as (ſaith he) with the right hand in the name of Christ

we conſigne thoſe that need this ſigne, becauſe it is more honorable then the left. Where marke 1. That the Miniſter did ſigne the baptiſed. 2. With the right hand. 3. That hee reputed this ſigne ſomewhat needfull. The third is Tertullian (whom Cyprian honored as his Maſter) he ſpeaking of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper ſaith, The fleſh is waſhed, that the ſoule may be clenſed;

               the fleſh is anoynted, that the ſoule may bee conſecrated; the fleſh is ſigned that the ſoule may be ſenſed; the fleſh is ſhadowed by the impoſition of hands, that the ſoule may be illightned by the ſpirit; the fleſh is fedde with the body and blood of Chriſt, that the ſoule may be ſatisfied with God. In which you may obſerue that the party that was baptiſed with water, was alſo ſigned with the ſigne of the Croſſe. The next is Origen, who in an exhortation he maketh to his hearers to liue a godly life, ſaith,Origen, in 38. homil. 2
                        •

my workes in Baptiſme, hath againe made himſelfe a ſeruant in my workes, and againe obeyeth my lawes. Where moſt plainely Origen ſheweth that the baptiſed in his time were ſigned with the ſigne of the Croſſe in their foreheads. About the ſame time Arnobius, reuerend amongſt the Chriſtians, &amp; of renown among the Gentiles, ſaith, Since Chriſt is riſen from the dead,

               and aſcended vp to heauen; wee his Apostles and Diſciples with all that beleeue, haue the ſigne of the Croſſe in good; ſo that our viſible and inuiſible enemies may ſee in our foreheads his ſigne, and bee aſhamed. In which we may obſerue that all that beleeued were ſigned in their foreheads with the ſigne of the Croſſe: ſecondlie that the Apoſtles, Diſciples, and all the faithfull reputed it as good: laſtly that by it the enemies of Chriſtianity ſince Chriſt was riſen and aſcended, were done to ſhame. The like witneſſeth zealous Cyprian, who ſheweth that they which were baptiſed in the Church, were offered to the Church by their gouernours,

               Hee cānot be holden of the ſecond death which, is ſigned with the ſigne (or myſtery) of the Croſſe. For the preaching of the Croſſe of Christs, is an argument that death is conquered. A little after: He cannot therfore bee holden of death, becauſe hee hath the ſigne that death is conquered for him. Where hee ſheweth that the baptiſed cannot be holden of the ſecond death (except they make themſelues vnworthy Chriſts merit; becauſe they haue

the Croſſe in Baptiſme, a ſigne that death is conquered for them. So Chryſostome hauing before ſpoken of the rites, vſe, fruits, and effects of Baptiſme, which it ſhould worke in the regenerate of God,

In which we may obſerue, firſt that this Croſſe is made by other, the Miniſter that baptiſeth: ſecondly that it was made in the foreheads of Chriſtians. Next vnto Hierome, and which liued with him in thoſe daies, is Auſtin, who ſpeaking to thoſe which were to be baptiſed,

               Iohn, he further ſaith.Idem tract. in Ioan. 118.
                
               The which ſigne of the Croſſe, except it bee made either vpon the foreheads of them that beleeue, or vpon the water, in which they are regenerated: nothing is orderly done. Where note that they that came to bee baptiſed, were ſigned with the ſign of the croſſe: ſecondly on their foreheads: thirdly that Austine did thinke that if this ſigne were wholy omitted, that all was not well done. The laſt of the twelue, &amp; lateſt in yeares is Gregory the Great, who briefely thus:Gregor. mag

               In the vpper dorepoſt of the houſe, we ſprinckle the blood of the Lambe; becauſe we carry the Croſſe of his Paſſion in our foreheads. Thus then by the verdict of theſe twelue moſt reuerend and renowned Fathers, you haue it found; that in their times and before, they that were baptiſed, were alſo at the ſame time ſigned in their foreheads with the ſigne of the Croſſe: this was then the practiſe of the Church,Vpon wha

                and this without the known contradiction and gain-ſaying of any, was then vſed. Now let vs in the third place conſider, by what reaſons theſe Fathers were

moued, to ſigne with the ſigne of the Croſſe, them that came to be baptiſed. Was it becauſe the Fathers thought, that the Apoſtles either by their enſample ſhewed, or word of mouth deliuered, that the baptiſed were ſo to be croſſed? Surely Baſil ſaid Baſil. de ſpi

               Augustine, that it was Christs Croſſe, which he would haue ſet in our foreheads; and thoſe reuerend Fathers by their verdict before giuen, ſhew, that in their ſeuerall Churches, and therefore by ſome probability of reaſon, generally in the whole Church of God (for it is vnlikly, that that which was vſed by them, was diſuſed by other) that the baptiſed were ſigned with the ſign of the croſſe. Now thoſe rites which are not expreſſely remembred in Scripture, and yet are in all the world obſerued, either were by the Apostles themſelues commended to the Church, or in ſome generall Councell concluded. But yet I dare not deliuer for a word of truth, that this was the mouing reaſon, which carried the Fathers

to ſigne their baptiſed with the ſigne of the Croſſe. What then? was it becauſe that in the Apoſtles times firſt, and after in the daies of theſe Fathers, many both of the Iewes and Gentiles (for amongſt many ſuch the ſmall nū
               ber of Chriſtiās were enforced to liue) reproachfully vpbrayding, that they put their truſt in him, which was hanged on the Croſſe; that the Fathers to ſhew to thoſe ſcorners, that that which they reproached as their ſhame, they reputed their glory, they ſigned their baptiſed with the ſigne of the Croſſe? So Austine ſpeaking to thoſe reproachers of the faith of Chriſtians:August. de v

               Wee do carry his ſigne in our foreheads, of which wee need not bee aſhamed, if we carry it alſo in our hearts. His ſign is the lowest ſtep of his humility. The wiſe men knew him by a Star, yet he would not haue the Star, but his Croſſe, to be his ſign in the foreheads of the faithfull. Thus then you ſee, the reaſon why principally the Fathers were moued, to ſigne their baptiſed with the ſigne of the Croſſe, and that in their foreheads, the

very ſeat of ſhame: that the Iew, Gentile, the vnfaithfull might vnderſtand, that Chriſtians were not aſhamed of their Chriſt that was crucified; but rather reputed his Croſſe, the very toppe and crowne of all their glory. Another reaſon there is, that whereas theſe Fathers ſaw, how hard a matter it was to make the meane of the people, to vnderſtād this myſtery of their ſaluation, and how prone the nature of mā is, not only to aſcribe to other, that which is only due to Chriſt; but euen alſo not to know, or knowing to forget, that which Chriſt had ſuffered for them; the Fathers ſigned their baptiſed with the ſigne of the Croſſe, that by this ſigne, they might bee remembred, to aſcribe the whole and ſumme of their ſaluation; not to the water in which they were baptiſed, nor vnto any other thing that they ſhould do, or is done to them, but vnto the only merit &amp; worth of Chriſts death and paſſion.

Thus the baptiſed at his Baptiſme, was not only asked whether hee did beleeue in Chriſt, but (that hee might the better know, from whence the good came he receaued by Chriſt) whether hee did beleeue in his Croſſe.

                So Chryſostome: The Paſſion of our Lord is the beginning and head of all our bliſſe, by which we liue, by which wee are: let vs therefore with a ioyfull mind, carry with vs the Croſſe of

Chriſt, as the crowne &amp; cauſe of all which maketh for our good. Thus then you ſee the reaſons, which moued thoſe auncient Fathers, to ſigne their baptiſed with the Croſſe; either becauſe they ſomewhat thought that the Apoſtles, either by their enſample, or word ſhewed, that the baptiſed were to bee ſigned with the Croſſe: or that they might ſhew to the Iewes and Gentiles, that they were not aſhamed of their Chriſt that was crucified: or that they might the better teach their hearers, to aſcribe the whole of their ſaluation, to the only merit and worth of Chriſts bitter death endured on the Croſſe. Theſe were the thoughts, and this the practiſe of that godly antiquity, whoſe piety and wiſedome as we cannot but reuerence; ſo let vs follow them in all peace and patience, well weighing the reaſons, that ſhould moue vs to abhor their pathes.

                for when their golden and gemmified Croſſe (which with them had ſtood couered from the time of Chriſts Paſſion, vntill the time ſuppoſed that he roſe) was once vncouered, then in their blind and deceiued deuotion, the people bare-foot, came creeping to it, ſaluting it, adoring it, offering to it, and humbly kiſſing the baſeſt parts of it, reputing this their Idolatrie, the greateſt worſhip they could do to Chriſt.
            Now as this materiall and manent Croſſe, was thus ſinfully abuſed to Idolatry: ſo was alſo the Croſſe aereall and tranſient fouly abuſed to ſuperſtition. For whē ſome of the Fathers, had ſomewhat largely ſpoken of the power of the Croſſe, as

Neither was this the error only of ſome of the people, but of the Fathers, ſome, (otherwiſe deuout and pious) did not only giue way to theſe ſuperſtitions of the people, but were in part the exhorters and furtherers of many, vnto this blind, needleſſe, and ſuperſtitious deuotion. So Chryſost. in Matth hom. 
               Chryſostome hauing ſpoken before of the Croſſe, inferreth: Wherfore in our parlers, &amp; on our walles, and on our windowes, yea and on our foreheads, and ſoules, with great care and ſtudie let vs ſet the Croſſe.

                by vertue of the Croſſe made, and words ſaid, the bread in that Sacrament was tranſubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ. Thus whereas at the firſt it was but once or ſeldome made, after it was often; whereas they ſigned to put the baptiſed in mind, that they ſhould not bee aſhamed to confeſſe Chriſt crucified, but ſhould in the merit of his Paſſiō place the cauſe of all their bliſſe: after they aſcribed the vertue

and holines to the outward ſigne, that without it, they thought nothing was ſanctified, nothing cōſecrated, nothing ſufficiently fenced, from the power and malice of the diuell. So great ſuperſtition &amp; will-worſhip fanſied by man, but not approued by God, did after follow &amp; accompany the Croſſe. Thus haue you heard that both theſe kinds of croſſes haue bin ſinfully abuſed, and by whom; &amp; that although the aereall Croſſe was rightly vſed by the Fathers at the firſt: yet that now they haue multiplied one into many, filling euerie place, and euery act, full of needleſſe and ſuperſtitious croſſes.
            Now it followeth that we ſhew vnto you,That the vſe of the Croſſe may bee diſuſed. that ſince the Croſſe hath been ſo foulie abuſed, that therefore they of our Fathers and other reformed churchers, did not ill which haue wholy abandoned the Croſſe, that in former ages hath been ſo ſinfully abuſed.2.

hūdred yeares: why may not with their praiſe, vpon the ſame reaſon of Idolatrie, Chriſtian Magiſtrates remoue out of the Church and houſes of God, thoſe croſſes &amp; crucifixes which were deuiſed and fanſied by man? Surely not ſo commaunded of God, as was the braſen Serpent.

is but a creature, neither is the diuine Godhead faſtned to an Image, as the Iew and Gentile thought, neither can it be ſhewed, that Chriſt would haue himſelfe in a Croſſe or Image to bee worſhipped. Wherfore our Rulers did well, by taking away the cauſes of the peoples error, to reduce them to the worſhip of the true and only God: and by defacing the Croſſes, with which the blinded world committed ſpiritual whoredome, to take away ye reproch of our faith, for which both Iew, Turke, &amp; well affected Chriſtians were offended with vs. This, in this very caſe Athanaſius approueth,

In like ſort, as the world may ſee, in our liturgy and Sacraments, and in the common vſe &amp; practiſe of the people, the aereall Croſſe in a manner is abandoned.

by the Gouernours of our Church, well may, as did the Fathers, notwithſtāding the contrary vſage of other Churches, ſigne our baptiſed with the ſigne of the Croſſe. For ſince the Fathers in their times, ſigned their baptiſed with the ſigne of the Croſſe, &amp; that vpon good and approued cauſes; why may not that which was lawfull for them, be lawfull for vs? keeping our ſelues within the ſame bounds and limits? Surely that, which the firſt and renowned Fathers, in all their ſeuerall Churches put in practiſe, as though it came from the Apoſtles themſelues, we cannot reiect as ſuperſtitious; or diſauow as vnlawfull and naught. Nay rather herein we ſuſpect our contrarying thoughts, &amp; ſuppoſe yt we may be deceaued, &amp; that they may (being nearer the times of Chriſt and his Apoſtles) in things of this nature better ſee the truth. Nay ſince the Croſſe is a rite meerely in the generall indifferent, ſince it may ſerue to decency and order, &amp; as a badge of our profeſſion: how may I or other of the like mind and conſcience with my ſelfe, in

this refuſe the order of our Church, vpon our priuate ſpleene and fanſies? let not him that vſeth it not, cōdemne him that vſeth it. If not to thee, yet to mee, except I would giue the lye vnto my cōſcience, it is indifferēt.

                  tonnes &amp; wil, to leaue out, or alter any rite or ceremony that is vſed in the Church. For although other Churches doe not vſe to baptiſe with the Croſſe, yet are we in things of this nature, to follow the rites and orders of the Church in which we liue, &amp; not the orders of thoſe to whom wee are not ſubiect, except we will become troublers of the peace of our Church, an offence vnto other, and cauſe other to be offēded with vs. The ſeueral Churches of God without blemiſh or derogation to other, may in theſe rites vſe their liberty according to the rule of Paul, as Chemniſius
               
in the ſame place ſpeaketh. And as Linwood inferred when in ſome Churches the baptiſed was dipped vnder the water, in ſome had water ſprinckled or powred on:Linwood de baptiſme. 
               that it was not of the neceſſity of Baptiſme that the child ſhould bee dipped: ſo maieſt thou, (in that ſome Churches doe ſigne the baptiſed with the ſigne of the Croſſe, others do not) hereby vnderſtand that the Church of God, doth not repute the Croſſe, to be of the neceſſity of Baptiſme. Yet doth the Church in which we liue, for order ſake, cōmand the vſe of the Croſſe vnto vs. Should we for this, forſake the people of our charge? and leaue the miniſtrie vnto which God hath called vs? by what warrant? this was not the coū
               ſell of Beza, Cartwright, and other impugners of this &amp; the like ceremonies; but rather to walke in our calling, and in patiēce to beare the burden of theſe diſlikes. If this had bin abſolutely euil, this they might not, nor would not haue perſwaded. And if they thought it lawfull, but not expedient nor conuenient; our Gouernours in their great

experience ſhould better know, what is fitting the ſtate of our Church than they. If they do not, as thou ſuppoſeſt, yet how maieſt thou leaue thy lawfull and needful duty, which God hath enioyned and requireth of thee, in that thou wilt not vndergoe with the good of many that which thou thinkeſt is not expedient? If thou farther ſaieſt, that the Croſſe hath bin moſt ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed, we ſay the ſame yet being freed from ſuperſtition and the opinion of merit, holines and neceſſity; why may it not be continued with vs, eſpecially ſince that which is vſed of vs, is far vnlike that which is vſed of the Papiſts? For they make the Croſſe in Baptiſme a needfull ceremonie; wee a conueniēt: they ſigne the baptiſed and the water oftē; we once: they put ſome religion and holines in the ſigne; wee put none: they croſſe the baptiſed before he receiueth his Chriſtendome; we after, and after he is receiued as a member in the Church: they to driue out the diuell, and by that ſigne to feare him from returning; wee that it might

be an honorable badge, to remember vs with all boldneſſe to confeſſe Chriſt crucified, and to repute the cauſe of all our happines, the merit of Chriſts Paſſion endured on the Croſſe. Well may therfore the Croſſe be vſed of vs, which hath been moſt ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed by them. And ſo much the rather, becauſe that by this ſigne thus remaining with vs, (ſince all other vſe of the croſſe is in no vſe with vs) wee may ſtop the mouthes of the ſlaundering Papiſts, which ſay that wee are enemies to Chriſt, and to his Croſſe: becauſe our Rulers haue broken downe his Crucifixes and Croſſes, and becauſe the people do not (as their Fathers did) ſigne themſelues with the ſign of the Croſſe. For this ſigne thus vſed in Baptiſme, ſheweth that wee are not enemies to Chriſt nor to his Croſſe, but to their Idolatry &amp; ſuperſtition. And although we do not liue among the Iewes and Pagans, which ſeeke to ſhame vs becauſe we put our truſt in him, that was hanged on a tree: by this Croſſe to ſhew them, that that which they reproch

wee repute our glory: yet ſince this is a doctrine needfull for all ſorts to learne, that not in the miniſter or water, but in the blood of Ieſus, they attaine the waſhing away and remiſſion of their ſinnes; ſince of this many of the people are very ignorant, not only by the word and Sacraments, the bleſſed meanes of God, but by this ſigne alſo the people may be remembred as thought the anciēt Fathers, that Chriſt died for them on the Croſſe.

               theſe I dare not reproue in thoſe Fathers, first becauſe the ſcope of the Fathers in thoſe rites was very good, to imprint in the minds of the faithfull the remembrance of Baptiſme. Secondly, becauſe in them was no ſuperſtition or opinion of neceſſity; and thirdly becauſe they were not ridiculous and fooliſh. Thus then you haue heard by the teſtimony of Beza, Bucer, Chemniſius, Zanchius, of whom ſome haue not the vſe of the Croſſe in their Baptiſme, that yet, it is lawfull for vs, to ſigne our baptiſed with the Croſſe, ſo that it be done purely without ſuperſtition, &amp; ſo that in it we do not place any holines, merit, or neceſſitie. Wherefore if there be any that ſcornfully reiecteth the iudgment of theſe auncient and moderne writers to them not I but Austin ſpeaketh:

                and to this not only our coūtry ſtories, but that which is recorded by ſtrangers, Testis veritatis temporum, Functius, Blondus, Carion, Diaconus de vita Gregory, with many other. Since therefore there are ſo many that giue witnes, that the Engliſh nation from Paganiſme to the profeſſion of Chriſt, was conuerted by this Austin ſent from Gregory, this is no popiſh error (as it is vntruly ſuggeſted) but an Engliſh truth. Nay I boldly ſpeake that the reprouer of this ſpeech, cannot proue by the teſtimony of any author either domeſtical or forren,

that the Engliſh in this Iland had publikly receaued the faith, before this Austins cōming to Ethelbert,

Thus then before this Austins time, there were in this Iland not only Chriſtians, but Chriſtian Biſhops (which did not fetch their Palles from Rome) but yet then among the Britaines, not Engliſh. For as then the name of Angli was not heard of in the Church of God. This is that Tertullian ſaith,

               the Brittiſh Iland which is placed not in this ſea, but in the very Ocean, hath felt the power of Gods word, there are Churches founded, there are Altars erected. This is that which Arnobius confeſſeth,Arnobius in Pſal. 138.
                that Gods word runneth ſo ſwiftly, that when ſo many thouſand of yeares, God was only knowne in Iuda; now within a few yeares, he is not vnknowen vnto the Indians on the East; nor yet to the Britaines on the West.

                   Arrian. This is that Athanaſius acknowledgeth, that in the great Coūcell at Sardica, by the command of the moſt religious Princes Constantius &amp; Constance, more then three hundred Biſhops by their verdicts acquitted him: amongst which were the Biſhops of Spaine, France, and Britany. This is that,Idem Epist. Jouinian. that he writeth to Iouinian; that he taught the ſame faith, which the Fathers aſſembled at Nicon did acknowledge, and vnto which all Churches, in all places gaue witneſſe; whether in Spain, Britany, France or Italy. To theſe I might adde ſundrie other, the authorities of the auncient Fathers Greeke and Latin; but by theſe you may vnderſtand,

that long before the time of Gregorie the Great, the faith of the Britaines, but not Engliſh (for of them in thoſe former times no mention is made) was famous amongſt all the Churches of God. Wherefore I would aduiſe thoſe my brethren, which are ſo ready to find fault with others, more aduiſedly to conſider of this and other their poſitions, before with ſo blacke a cole, they note their brethren for ſetters abroach of Popiſh errors. Now here that you may the better know in this cauſe, the difference betwixt the Papiſts &amp; our writers; you muſt briefely vnderſtand, that this is not queſtioned betwixt vs, whether Austin was the firſt that taught the Engliſh Chriſtianity in this Iland: all do acknowledge that Ethelbert was the firſt of the Saxon Kings, that heere was Chriſtened: neither was the Church of the Engliſh knowen to bee a member of Gods Church, before thoſe daies. Neither is it queſtioned betwixt vs, whether this Austin was the firſt that preached Chriſtianity in this Iland: for among

the Britaines Chriſtianity was many hundred yeares before. Their, and our records, and the mouth of antiquitie, commending the faith of the Britaines doth witneſſe the ſame. But this is in queſtion betwixt vs and them, as reuerend Fox in his ſecond booke of Actes and Monuments ſheweth, whether the Britaines and Chriſtians in this Iland, firſt receaued the faith from Rome, or elſe where. The which although I will not take vpon mee at this time to decide, yet vpon theſe reaſons (iudge you what I ſay) I thinke that the Britaines firſt receaued Chriſtianity, not from Rome, but from ſome other place. For although all antiquity doth acknowledge, which we cannot gain-ſay, that of the Britaines, Lucius was the firſt Chriſtened King: yet as Chriſts religion was long before in Rome, before the Emperours embraced it, and were baptiſed: ſo might Chriſtianity be long before in this Iland, before the Prince receaued it, and by his publike authority gaue countenance to it.Joan.

The which may ſeeme heerein the more probable, in that the Brittiſh Biſhops with whom the remembred Austin deſired further conference;

                Surely in the keeping of the feaſt of Eaſter, as the faſt on Saturday, they follow not the guiſe and cuſtome of the Church of Rome, but rather the Eaſt

                the ſecond Biſhop of Hieruſalem, the firſt founders of Chriſtian religion in this land. Thus then you ſee, in that Ioſeph of Arimathea was the firſt that firſt preached Chriſtianity in this Iland; in that the Brittiſh Biſhops would haue no fellowſhip with Auſtin, that came commended from the Sea of Rome; in that, in many rites and cuſtomes, the Chriſtians in this Iland, were different from the rites, cuſtomes, and vſages of the Church of Rome; and agreed in thē with the Eaſt Churches, and with that, which the Apoſtles and Ioſeph of Arimathea did therin, whileſt they liued: it may probably be preſumed, (ſince there is nothing of moment that makes to the contrary) that not from Rome, but from the Eaſt

Churches, the Britaines in this Iland, firſt receaued the faith. Now what remaineth, but that you fairely take, that which hath been ſpoken; that wee all, in all our cenſures, would ſuffer out zeale to bee guided with knowledge, knowledge to bee moderated with loue; that in our praiers, deſires, and beſt endeuours, with a good conſcience we would ſeeke for the peace of our Hieruſalem, the Church and kingdome in which wee liue: ſo ſhall wee proſper, &amp; it ſhal alwaies, whatſoeuer betide vs, go well with vs, Amen.
