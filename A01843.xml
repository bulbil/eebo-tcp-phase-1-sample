            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

bewayling hir former stubburnes, declared vnto him and master Cole, master Charke, and master Yong, that shée had giuen hir consent and procurement to hir husbandes death, through vnlawfull luste and liking that she had to Brown confessing hir sinfulnesse of life committed with him: and humbly submitting hirselfe to hir deserued punishment, besought them of spirituall comfort and councell, which thing they were glad to perceyue, and therevpon employed their trauell to do them good: and laboured very painfully to instruct them aright: for (God wote) they founde all the thrée prisoners very rawe and ignorant in all things perteyning to God &amp; to their soule health, yea and euen in the very principles of the Christen religion. Neuerthelesse through Gods good working with their labour, they recouered them out of Sathans kingdome vnto Christ, insomuch that besides their voluntary acknowledging of their late heinous fact, they also detested the former sinfulnesse of their life, and willingly yelded to the death which they had shunned, vttering such certaine tokens of their vnfayned repentance by all kinde of modestie &amp; méekenesse, as no greater could be deuised. For Mistresse Saunders the same day sent for

hir husbands brothers and their wiues and kinsfolke that were in the towne, whiche came vnto hir the day before hir death: in whose presence she knéeling mildely on hir knées, with abundance of sorrowful teares, desired them of forgiuenesse for bereuing them of their deare brother and friende: wherevnto master Saunders. the Lawyer in the name of them al answered, that as they were very sori

she had done none of all those thinges, but was vtterlie cleare bothe to God and the worlde of all suche manner of dealing. And then with like obeysance, turning hir

But otherwise, wheras in the time of hir seruice in his house, she had offended him, in neglecting or contemning hir duetie, she acknowledged hir fault, and besoughte him for Gods sake to forgiue hir: who very honorably, and

               he of them had done at their first comming to the place. Which done, they were all put in a readinesse by the Executioner, and at one instant (by drawing away the Cart wheron they stoode) were sent togither out of this worlde vnto God.
            And Browne also, a good while afore, during

the time of his imprisonment, cōming to a better minde than he had bene of in time paste, confessed that he had not héeretofore frequēted sermons, nor receiued the holy sacrament, nor vsed any calling vpon God priuate or publike, nor giuē him selfe to reading of holy Scripture, or any bookes of godlynesse: but had altogither followed the appetites and lustes of his sinfull flesh, euen with greedinesse and outragious contempt both of God and man. Neuerthelesse God was so good vnto him, and schooled him so well in that short time of imprisonment, as he cloased vp his life with a maruellous apparance of heartie repentance, constant trust in Gods mercy through Iesus Christ, and willingnesse to forsake this miserable worlde.
            Nowe remayneth to shewe what is to be gathered of this terrible example, and how we oughte to apply the same to our owne behoofe. First I note with S. Paule, that when men regarde not to knowe God, or not to honour him when they know him: God giueth them ouer to their own lustes, 
                  •…
               o as they runne on from sinne to sinne, and from mischiefe to mischiefe, to do suche things as are shamefull and odious, euen in the sight of the worlde, to their owne vnauoidable

perils. And when the measure of their iniquitie is filled vp, there is no way for them to escape the iustice of God, which they haue prouoked. Insomuche, that if they might eschue all bodily punishment: yet the very hell of their owne conscience would prosecute them, and the sting of their minde would be a continuall prison, torment, and torture to them, wheresoeuer they went. Agayne on the other side, we must marke the infinit greatnesse of Gods wisdome and mercy, who perceyuing the peruerse wilfulnesse of mans frowarde nature to sinning, suffreth men sometimes to runne so long vpon the bridle, till it séeme to themselues, that they may safely do what they liste, and to the worlde, that they be past recouerie vnto goodnesse: and yet in the end catching them in their chiefe pride, he rayseth them by their ouerthrow, amendeth them by their wickednesse, and reuiueth them by their death, in such wise blotting out the stayne of their former filthe, that their darknesse is turned into light, and their terrour to their comfort. Moreouer, when God bringeth such matters vpon the stage, vnto y• open face of the world: It is not to the intent that men should gaze and wonder at the persons, as byrdes do at

an Owle, not that they should delight them selues &amp; others with the fond &amp; perad

               o the inward cōsideration of our selues. Beholde, wee bée all made of the same moulde, printed with the same stampe, and indued with the same nature that the offenders are. We be the impes of the olde Adam, and the venim of sinne whiche he receiued from the olde serpent, is shedde into vs all, and woorketh effectually in vs all.
            Suche as the roote is, suche are the braunches, and the twiggs of a thorne or bramble can beare no grapes. That we stande, it is the benefite of Gods grace, and not the goodnesse of our nature, nor the strengthe of oure owne will. That they are falne, it was of frayltie: wherfrom we be no more priuiledged than they: and that shoulde we ouersoone perceiue by experience, if we wer left to our selues. He that looketh s

or reprocheth the kinred or ofspring with the fault of the auncester or alye, how greate so euer the same hath ben: sheweth himselfe not to haue any remorse of his owne sinnes, nor to remember that he him selfe also is a man: but (which thyng he woulde little thinke) he fully matcheth the crime of the misdoer, if he do not surmount it by his presumptuousnesse.
            When it was tolde oure Sauiour Chryst that Pylate had mingled the bloud of certain men with their owne sacrifise, what aunswere made hée? Did hée detest the offenders? did he declame against their dooings? Did he exaggerate the fault of the one, or the crueltie of the other? No. But framing and applying the example too the reformation of the hearer, suppose ye (sayd he) that those Galileans wer greater sinners than all the other Galileans, bycause they suffered such punishment? I tell you nay: but except ye repente, ye shall all likewise perish. Or think ye that those eightene vpon whom the toure in Silo fell, and slew them, were sinners aboue all y• dwelt in Hierusalem?

He hath shewed in some, what al of vs deserue, to prouoke vs al to repentance, that al of vs myght haue mercie at his hand, and shewe mercie one to an other, &amp; with one mouthe and one hearte glorifie his goodnesse. It is sayde by the Prophete Samuel, that disobedience is as the sinne of Witchcrafte. Lette euery of vs looke into himselfe (but first lette him put on the spectacles of Gods lawe, and carie the lyghte of Gods worde with him) and he shall sée suche a gulfe of disobedience in himselfe, as he maye well thinke there is none offender but himselfe. I say not this as a cloaker of offences, that white should not be called white, &amp; blacke:

            Finally, let al folkes both maried and vnmaried, learne hereby to possesse and kéepe their vessell in honestie and cleannesse. For if the knot betwene man and wife (whiche ought to be inseparable) be once broken, it is seldome or neuer knit again. And though it be, yet is not the wound so throughly healed, but there appéereth some skarre euer after. But if the sore rancle &amp; fester inwardly (as commonly it doth except the more grace of God be) in the end it bursteth forth to the destructiō or hurt of both parties, not lightly without great harme to others also besides themselues, as we sée by this example. For when the body which was dedicated to God to be his temple and the tab

open shame and daunger of temporall law: or into damnable destruction both of body soule, according as Salomon in his Prouerbes sayth, that the steps of a harlot leade downe vnto death, and hir feete perce euen vnto hell. Therefore good reader, so heare and reade this present example, as the same may turne to the bettering of thy state, and not to occasion of slaunder, nor to the hurt of thine owne conscience, nor to the offence of thy Christian brethren.

            Anne Saunders confession as she spake it at the place of execution.
            GOod people, I am come hither to die the deathe, wherevnto I am adiudged, as worthely &amp; as deseruedly as euer died any: I had a good husband, by whom I had manie children, with whom I liued in wealth, &amp; might haue done stil, had not the deuill kindled in my hearte, first the hellish firebrand of vnlawfull lust, &amp; afterward a murtherous intent to procure my saide husbande to be bereued of his life, which was also by my wicked meanes accomplished, as to the world is known. And as I woulde if he coulde heare me, if it might be, prostrate vpon the ground, at my husbands feete, aske mercy with plentiful teares of him, so that which I may &amp; I oughte to doe, I aske mercye of God, I aske mercie of all men and women of the world, whō by my deede &amp; example I haue offended: and especiallye I

bewaile my husbande, &amp; aske mecie of my childrē whōe I haue beraued of so good a father, I aske mercy of his kindred and frendes whome I haue hurt, &amp; of all my frends &amp; kindred, of whom I am abashed and ashamed: and beyng of my selfe vnworthy of pittie, yet I besech them all, &amp; you all, &amp; all the whole worlde euen for gods sake, and for our sauiour Christs sake to forgiue me. And I thank God with my whole harte, he hathe not suffered me to haue the reigne and bridle of sinning gyuen me at my will, to the daunger of my eternall damnatiō, but that he hath founde out my sin, &amp; brought me to punishment in this world, by his fatherly correctiō, to amend, to spare, and saue me in the world to come: &amp; I beseche him graunte me his heauenly grace, that all who do behold or shall heare of my death, maye by the example therof be frayed from like sinning. And I besech you all to pray for me and with me.
