            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            A TREATISE
TENDING TO CLEARE
THE DOCTRINE OF
IVSTIFICATION.
            Written by Io. FORBES, Paſtour of the Engliſh
Church at MIDDELBVRGH, for the inſtruction
of his flocke: And now publiſhed
by ſome of them for the good
of others.
            Bleſſed is he to whom the Lord imputeth not ſinne, Pſal. 32. 2.
            
            This is the name that they shall call him, The Lord
our righteouſnes, Ier. 33. 6.
            
            For God was in Christ reconciling the world to himſelfe, not
imputing to them their ſinnes, 2. Cor. 5. 19.
            
            For he made him who knew no ſinne to be ſinne for vs: that we might
be made the righteouſnes of God in him, 2. Cor. 5. 21.
            
            AT MIDDELBVRGH,
Printed by Richard Schilders, 1616.
         
         
            
            
            To his welbeloved in the Lord, the
faithfull of the English Church in MIDDELBVRGH,
whoſe love to the trueth hath entertained his
Miniſterie amongſt them, The Author wiſheth grace
to diſcerne, and in humilitie to embrace and cōſtantlie
to hold the truth in faith and love vnto eternall life.
            
               THE love of you, dearely
beloved, whom I have and
yet do ſerve in the Lord, ſtirred
by the earneſt and forward
deſire of ſome of you,
hath mooved me to alter my
former determination, of abſtayning
from all writing, eſpecially
during the preſent
eſtate of Gods Church, more
waſted and whithered, then watered, and builded in
grace, by ſuperfluitie of writing: I ever was loth to
put my hande to the penne, and raſhlie to adventure the
declaring of my minde, in ſo deepe myſteries: ſeeing ſo
many, by their inconſiderate forwardnes in writing, doe
darken the trueth, more then cleere it, and doe breed
contention, rather, then godly edifying. The ſight of
whoſe weaknes, ioyned with the conſcience of myne
owne inabilitie, as being in iudgement farre inferior, ſo
alſo in vttering by word, and expreſſing in writt, the conceptions

of my minde, fa
                  •
               re leſſe prompt and able, then
many who have ſo ſtumbled: hath made me afraide, to
medle in ſuch ſort, with the ſacred truth of God. Moreover,
in this contending age, I ſee and perceyve, that
anſwering of errours, doth more kindle then quench the
fire of endleſſe ſtrife: preſumption of knowledge, deceyving
the mindes of manie: and true humilitie, ſo neceſſarie
a vertue, for learning the myſteries of God, ſo farre
remoued from men, even otherwayes of excellent giftes,
that the moſt part, ſtriving in preiudged humor, more for
victorie, then truth: it is hard to finde, almoſt one, who in
this heate of contention, doth not in ſomething, more or
leſſe marre the ſoundnes of Gods truth. So dangerous a
thing it is to do any thing, in contentious manner, and
through vaine glorie, and not in that meeknes of minde,
whereby every man eſteemeth others better then him ſelfe.
Philip. 2. 3. and therefore wiſely doth the Apoſtle forbid oppoſitions
of ſcience, falſly ſo called, in the handling of Gods
truth:1. Tim. 6. 20. 2. as a thing which maketh both them which profeſſe
it, to erre concerning the faith: and alſo turnes others away
from the truth: and commandeth the ſervant of the
Lord,2 Tim 2. 24. 25. not to ſtrive, but being gentle toward all men, to inſtruct
thē with meeknes: and willeth thoſe that are ſtrong
in the faith, to receive vnto them, the weake in faith: but
not vnto cōtroverſies of diſputations,Rom. 14. 1. becauſe that doth
greatly harme ſuch as are weake: who thereby are caſt in
a greater doubtfulnes and vncertaintie of the maine foū
               dations.
For as a ſhip before one faire wind, is carried forward
in hir courſe, &amp; ſaffely brought to the havē: which
by contrary blaſtes, is not onely hindred, but greatly endangered,
if not drowned: even ſo the faith of the Saints,

which is to be promoved by the onely ſimple and ſound
breath of Gods mouth,1. Cor. 1. 10 in his faithfull ſervants, all both
minding &amp; ſpeaking one thing,Phil. 2. 2. muſt needes bee marveylouſly
hindred in many,Rom. 15. 6. and in many quite deſtroyed
by theſe ſo many contrarie doctrines, blowing every one
againſt another, and caſting the faith of the children of
God, vpon ſo many daungerous Rockes: and toſſing it
with ſo manie windes and waves, that it is no marvayle,
to ſee ſo many, make wofull ſhipwrackes. It were more
to the honour of God, and profit of the Saints, if the
Builders were more carefull of keeping vnitie in the
truth, in following the true paterne of holſome wordes,
in faith and love,2. Tim. 1. 13. which cannot bee condemned: then
curious in ſhewing their knowledge.Tit. 2. 8. And that all Paſtours,
did labour, after th'example of that Prince of Paſtours,
to lead his people by the ſtill waters: rather then
by the turbulent ſtreames of their fighting opinions, and
by ſtrange language, to divert the children of God, from
the waters of Shiloa, that runnes ſoftlie: which only are
able to refreſh the Cittie of God. In ſo doinge, they
ſhould not have ſinned, in quenching ſo many ſmoking
flaxes, and breaking ſo many bruſed reedes. I ſpeake
not againſt the faithfull labours of Chriſtes witneſſes:
cōtending with courage againſt the errors of the common
adverſarie, either within or without the houſe of
GOD: and oppoſing them ſelves, both in plaine ſimplicitie
of trueth, and moderate helpe of arte, to everie
corrupt doctrine. But my ſpeach is againſt our owne
inteſtine debates, ariſing not ſo much vpon any ſubſtantiall
contrarietie, as to much curioſitie of judgement,
whereas in one and the ſame pointe, they holding the

ſubſtance, doe contende for the ſhadowe. as is too manifeſt
in this ſame pointe, whereof I am by your Chriſtian
importunitie, forced to write touchinge the
Iuſtification of a ſinner before God. Wherein
even they who doe holde Chriſt, to bee our righteouſneſſe,
according to the word: doe yet notwithſtanding
greatly perturbe the peace of the Church, and deſtroye
the faith of many: and give matter of offence to all, in
ſtriving for the difference, which is in the meaſure, rather
thē in the matter of their faith. They that ſee more
deepely, by importune and vntimely forwardnes, renting
ſuch as are yet old bottells, with their new wine:
and they who are not come ſo farre in knowledge, in
vnadviſed temeritie, iudging and condempning that,
whereto as yet they themſelves have not attained. Both
fayling in the duetie of love: the one not contenting to
have their faith with them ſelves, vntill without hurte
and offence of others, they may imparte it to their edification,
and not to their deſtruction: the other ſorte, not
having learned in ſobrietie, to be wiſe according to the
meaſure of their owne faith, doe not admitt what more
the Lord reveyleth to others. as though the meaſure of
their faith and knowledge, ſhould bee the rule and limittes
of the ſpirit, to binde the whole Church, and
every man therein. And this woefull ſeed of contradiction
(while men are too much addicted to the vaine deceyte
of their owne reaſon) hath now at laſt, not onely
troubled the faith of the weake ones, but hath begunne,
to caſt darknes vpon the mindes, of ſome of the ſtrongeſt
ſorte. while they evaniſh in their owne reaſonings

about the trueth of God reveyled in the Goſpell: as did
the Gentiles, in that trueth which God made manifeſt
vnto them in the creatures.Rom.

                     •
                  . Theſe have bene the cauſes
of my vnwillingnes, to give any thing in write, and that
now, being overcome by your requeſt, I doe follow a
plaine maner of declaration of my minde, without contention
with anie, or direct diſputing againſt anie: as being
reſolved, to have no parte, in the noyſome wrangling,
of this contentious age. But as one deſirous to
walke honeſtlie, in all things: I endevour, to keepe mee
within the meaſure of my owne faith: and to benefitt
the Church of God, with that which he hath given me:
not hindring, nor envying that others, who have receyved
more, do more good in our common Lords worke.
Of whom (as hee who is onely able to give it) I moſt
humbly crave the gratious direction of his ſpirit, in this
and all my labours: with his bleſsing therevpon, to your
comfort, and theirs who ſhall have the vſe thereof. His
grace be with you. Middelburgh, 20. Iuly, 1615.

            A Treatiſe tending to
cleare the Doctrine of
Justification.
            
               CHAPTER I.
               
                  THE Evangeliſt Luke, willing
to make Theophilus, to acknowledge
the certaintie of thoſe
things, whereof he had bene inſtructed:
did ſearch out perfectly all
thinges, from the beginning: and
then did write vnto him, frō point
to point. According to whoſe example,
(for giuing the more full aſſurāce
to mindes deſirous of knowledge)
it ſhall not be amiſſe, being
to treat of the true nature of the Iuſtification of a ſinner, that we
firſt beginning at the very foundation, do ſhortlie ſpeak of thoſe
points, vpon the knowledge whereof, chieflie dependeth the
light and evidence of this matter.
               Amongſt divers others: there are foure principall groundes.
vpon the ſound knowledge▪ whereof, it evidently appeareth,
that the right conception, of the true nature of Gods ſaving benefits
in Chriſt, doeth chieflie depend.
               
                  
                  
                     The firſt is, The ſound knowledge of Gods Decree
or Predeſtination.
                  
                     The ſecond is, The knowledge of Chriſt, as Mediator
betwixt God and vs.
                  
                     The third is, The right order of the benefits imparted
vnto vs.
                  
                     The last is, The ſound knowledge of the ſpeciall
difference and diſtinction, of thoſe benefites amongſt
them ſelves.
               
               Theſe foure points haue ſuch affinitie one with another: and
the knowledge of each one ſo depēdeth vpō another, that hardlie
can any one of them be ſoundly knowne, without the ſound
knowledge of the reſt. For error in one, doth bring commonly,
if not continually, errour in all. Which is manifeſt, if we lay before
our eyes, the different opinions of men, touching this
point, which we haue in hande: in the which we ſhall evidentlie
perceyve, that as many mayne differences as are amongeſt
them, concerning the iuſtification of a ſinner: ſo many different
iudgements have they, touching Gods Decree, Chriſtes merite,
the order of Gods diſpenſation, and nature of the benefites diſpenſed.
For according to our miſtaking, or confounding, or
wrong placing of any of thoſe reſpectivelie, wee doe miſtake,
confound and order amiſſe, the benefites of God: in our conceyving,
ſpeaking, or writing of them. Wherefore it is more then
evident, that it is dangerous to erre in any of theſe foure: and
therefore before we come to the particular conſideration of the
benefite of our iuſtification, I doe eſteeme it firſt neceſſarie, that
for the clearing of the true nature thereof, wee lay ſome ſolide
goundes in our myndes, concerning the knowledge of theſe
foure pointes: ſo farre as in generall, is requiſite to preſerue vs

from errour in the particular conſideration of any one bleſſing
beſtowed vpon vs in CHRIST.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               FIRST then touching Gods Decree, the true nature thereof
cannot rightly be knowne, except beſides other thinges
therein to be conſidered, we ſpecially vnderſtand: Firſt,
what is the ſubſtāce of it: And ſecondly, what is the chief ground
and cauſe of it. Which two things doe principally teach vs how
to make a right reference of all Gods benefits vnto it, and of it
vnto them. and therefore they are chieflie to be marked of vs.
The matter or ſubſtance of Gods Decree, is two maner of wayes
conſidered in the Scriptures: Firſt more properly: which maner
in ſhew ſeemeth more ſtrict, and yet doth imply the largeſt ſenſe.
Secondly, in a more improper manner according to the conſequent
fruites and effects following neceſſarily vpon the proper
ſubſtance and nature of Gods Decree, whereby it is moſt properlie
deſcribed: which proper deſcription is chieflie to be perceyued
in thoſe places of ſcripture, where the ſpirit of God purpoſelie
ſets it downe, in the owne proper nature: expreſly diſtinguiſhing
it both from Gods purpoſe or foreknowledge going in
order before it, and from Gods election and remanent bleſſings
in the execution thereof following in order after it.
               Of theſe places there bee two principally to bee marked,
which being compared togither, do make vp the full and ſound
nature and deſcription of the Decree of God in ſo farre as it is reſtrayned
to the veſſels of honor, in which reſpect we ſpeake of it
in this treatiſe. The one place is in the firſt chap. to the Epheſ.
verſ. 5. The other is in the 8. chap. to the Rom. ver. 29. In the firſt
it is thus deſcribed, He hath predeſtinated vs vnto adoption through Ieſus
Christ in him ſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his owne will vnto the
prayſe of the glorie of his grace. And this is the moſt proper and moſt
perfect definition of Gods Decree, from the next and moſt proper
bleſſing vnto which we are predeſtinate, and wherevpon al
the reſt (from which the Decree of God in other places is more

improperly defined) do conſequently depend as neceſſarie effects
and adherents thereof. And this appeareth to bee manifeſt
by the other place, where it is thus deſcribed: Thoſe whom hee
knew before, he alſo praedestinated to be made like to the Image of his Sonne.
Which place compared with the former, doth ſhew evidentlie,
that in the former deſcription, conteyned in the firſt chap. to the
Ephe. all bleſſings wherein ſtādeth our cōformitie to the Image
of Chriſt, are ſuch neceſſarie conſequences of adoption and inſeparable
adherents thereof: that to be predeſtinate to adoption
includeth them all. And for this cauſe is it that ſometimes
the Decree of God is deſcribed from them, as namely from eternall
life, Act. 13. ver. 48. As many as were ordayned vnto eternall life, beleeved.
And from ſalvation, as 1. Theſſ. 5. 9. God hath not appointed vs
vnto wrath, but to the obtayning of ſalvation through our Lord Ieſus Christ,
&amp;c. And theſe we call more improper deſcriptions of Gods Decree,
becauſe they are taken from the fruites and effectes, or inſeparable
conſequences of that bleſſing wherevnto wee are ſaide
moſt properly to be predeſtinate, which is adoption, whereby
Gods Decree is moſt properly deſcribed, becauſe in Gods diſpenſation
to vsward it preſupponeth no preceeding benefite,
whereof it ſhould be the effect, but is the next ende wherevnto
God doth ordayne vs: and ſo the firſt bleſſing of God, which he
doth beſtow vpon vs in Chriſt: comprehending in it by neceſſarie
conſequence all the reſt: as inſeparable fruites and effectes
thereof: and therefore is it that in that other place, in the 8. to the
Rom. Gods Decree is deſcribed from the making of vs cōforme
to the Image of his Sonne: which alwayes preſupponeth the
making of vs ſonnes, in his ſonne, to goe before it.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               HAving now conſidered the places where the decree of
God is moſt properly deſcribed, wee are next out of them
to marke what is the ſubſtance of it, which is cleerly ſett
downe to conſiſt in three thinges.
               
                  
                  
                     The firſt is, The Perſons who are ordayned.
                  
                     The ſecond is, The thing wherevnto they are ordayned.
                  
                     The third is, The Meane whereby they are to receive
that wherevnto they are ordayned.
               
               Touching the perſons, they are deſcribed in the 8. Chap, to
the Rom. from Gods foreknowledge or purpoſe, where it is
ſaid, Thoſe whom he knew before, them alſo he predeſtinated: and therefore
is it that predeſtination is ſaid to be according to the purpoſe of
God, Ephe. 1. verſ. 11. And to the ſame effect election is ſaid to be
according to the foreknowledge of God, 1. Pet. 1. 1. and 2. And this is that
ſure foundation of God which never fayleth: as ſayeth the Apoſtle to Timoth.
the 2. Epiſt. chap. 2. v. 19. whereof alſo Iames ſpeaketh Act.
15. 18. as the ground of the calling of the Gentiles to the participation
of grace with the Iewes: when he ſayth, from the beginning
of the world God knoweth all his owne workes. Which two places,
lead vs to the conſideration of theſe two things: Firſt, that the
foreknowledge of God, or his purpoſe doth comprehend the determinate
and complete number of all that are predeſtinate, and
according thereto effectually called. Secondly, that thoſe who
are ſo called, that is according to Gods purpoſe or foreknowledge,
doe remayne ſure, and never can ſo fall away from grace
and from the trueth of God, that they ſhould erre frō the marke.
But heere it is not my purpoſe to ſpeake more of the perſons that
are ordayned: becauſe heereafter we wil have occaſion at greater
length to entreat of them.
               The ſecond thing in the ſubſtance of Gods Decree to be conſidered
of vs, is that wherevnto they are ordeyned, which by
the Apoſtle is called Adoption, that is ſonneſhip or filiation. When
he ſayeth, he hath predeſtinated vs vnto adoption: which benefire
implieth all the reſt, which conſiſt in theſe things whereof
we are made partakers in the ſonne of God: to make vs conforme
to his Image both in death and life, in ſuffering and reigning

with him. Which as we haue ſaid, appeareth evidently by
that other deſcription of predeſtinatiō ſet downe in the 8, chap.
to the Rom. where it is ſaid, that he hath predeſtinated vs to be
made like to the Image of his Sonne. Whereby it is evident that
the thing, whereto firſt and principally we are predeſtinate, is
to be ſonnes, by adoption: and ſecondarily in and vnder that
adoption, we are, by infallible conſequent, predeſtinate, to bee
made like vnto the only Sonne of God. For firſt we are made
Gods ſonnes in his ſonne: &amp; then we are made like Gods ſonne,
in his ſonne, for the conforming of vs vnto Chriſt, ſucceedeth
not only in order, but alſo in ſome reſpect, in time, vnto our being
ſonnes in him, according to that ſaying of Iohn, in his 1. Epiſt.
chap. 3. verſ. 2. We are now the ſonnes of God, but yet it is not made
manifeſt, what we ſhalbe: and we knowe that when hee shalbe made manifeſt,
we shalbe made like him, for we shall ſee him as he is. And to the
ſame effect ſpeakes the Apoſtle to the Coloſſians, chap. 3. verſ. 3.
and 4. ſaying, That we are dead, and that our life is hid with Christ in
God: and when Chriſt, who is our life, shall appeare, then shall we alſo appeare
with him in glorie.
               
               For this ground is to be well marked, that the likening of vs
who are made ſonnes in Chriſt, requireth neceſſarily, the manifeſtation
of Chriſt vnto vs, to goe before in the ſame bleſſings,
wherein we are to be made like vnto him. For as to make vs
ſonnes by adoption, requireth neceſſarily the revelation of Ieſus
Chriſt, as the ſonne of God vnto vs: ſo the conforming of vs
vnto him, either in death or life, requireth neceſſarily that he be
manifeſted to vs in his death and croſſe, and in his life and glorie.
Therefore doth Peter in his 1. Epiſt. chap. 1. verſ. 13. aſcribe
the bringing of all grace to vs, vnto the revelation of IESVS
Chriſt, ſaying: Truſt perfectly in that grace which is brought vnto you, in
the revelation of Ieſus Chriſt. And of this it commeth to paſſe, that in
this preſent life, we are in ſome meaſure made like vnto Chriſt,
in the communion of the benefites flowing from his death and
ſuffering, and his reſurrection from the death: becauſe he hath
alreadie appeared to vs in theſe things. But in this life, we are
not, neither ſhalbe made like vnto him in his glorie, which followeth

the reſurrection frō the dead: becauſe in that, we cannot
be made conforme vnto him; vntill that he appeare vnto vs againe,
in glorie. but we reſt in full aſſurance of it: becauſe of our
conformitie in his death, alreadie begunne. For as ſayth the Apoſtle
Rom. 6. 5. If we haue bene planted with him vnto the ſimilitude of
his death, we shall alſo be planted with him to the ſimilitude of his reſurrection.
And this aſſurance made the Apoſtle Paul, to labour above
all things, to know Chriſt, and the vertue of his reſurrection, and the fellowship
of his ſufferings, in being made conforme to his death, Phil. 3. 10.
becauſe as in the ſame place he declareth by that cōformitie, vnto
his death, he did know, that he ſhould attayne vnto the reſurrection
from the dead: that is, the glorious and immortall eſtate
in all perfection, which the Saints doe enioy, in the reſurrection
from the dead. In reſpect of this ground, it is, that firſt &amp; principally,
as we haue ſaid, we are predeſtinate vnto adoption, as
vnto that wherein Chriſt is firſt of all to be manifeſted vnto vs:
and in the communion whereof, is builded and grounded, our
communion with him, in all other things, wherein he is heereafter
to be revealed vnto vs: to this ende that we may bee made
like vnto him.
               This is one of the mayne pointes, chiefly to be marked, in
the conſideration of the ſubſtance of Gods Decree. Which not
being rightly conceyved, maketh that not onely the Decree of
God it ſelfe, is miſtaken by many: but alſo that the benefites of
God in Chriſt, are both wrongly defined, and ordered, and ſpecially
the benefite of Iuſtification: as heereafter wee will ſee
more cleerly.
            
            
               CHAPTER IIII
               THE third thing to bee marked in the ſubſtance of Gods
Decree, is the Meane, whereby we are to attayne vnto
that, wherevnto we are predeſtinate: that is, whereby
God hath ordayned vs, to be Adopted, which is Ieſus Chriſt, according
as the deſcription of predeſtination contayneth: when

it fayeth. That we are Predeſtinate to be adopted through Ieſus Chriſt. Of
which point for avoyding idle repetition, we will not ſpeake
much, vntill we come to the ſecond of theſe foure points: which
we haue propounded to be conſidered: becauſe vnto it, it properly
belongeth: onely theſe two things, we are to marke, by
the way: Firſt, that Ieſus Chriſt, is not the cauſe why, but the
Meane, whereby God doth ordayne vs to adoption. Which will
more clearly appeare, when we ſpeake of the cauſe, mooving
God to predeſtinate vs.
               The ſecond thing that we haue to marke, is, that all other ſecondary
Meanes, whereby in the Scriptures we are ſaid to be
made ſonnes, or iuſtified, &amp;c. as namely, the Goſpell preached,
the Sacramentes, &amp; faith: are no wayes to be eſteemed Meanes,
ſimply in reſpect of them ſelves, but only by relation, and reference
to Chriſt: in and by them revealed, offered, and receyved.
Which is moſt evident, by the deſcription aforeſaide of predeſtination:
in the which nothing ſaving Chriſt alone, is ſet downe
to be the Meane, whereby God ordayneth vs to be adopted: ſo
that it is not the word but Chriſt revealed by the word, neither
the Sacraments, but Chriſt ſignified by the Sacramentes, nor
faith, but Chriſt receyved by faith, which in proper ſenſe maketh
vs ſonnes, and iuſtifieth vs. They only by conſequence and
mediatly being ſaid in Scripture, to make vs ſonnes, and Iuſtifie
vs, &amp;c. becauſe they are the meanes, appointed of GOD,
whereby we atteyne vnto Chriſt, who is the onely proper and
immediate meane, whereby we are Adopted and Iuſtified, &amp;c.
Neither are they appointed mediate Meanes, abſolutely neceſſarie,
vnto our adoption and iuſtification: Chriſt onely being
the immediate and abſolute neceſſarie Meane, appointed of God
for the enioying of theſe bleſſings: as being the onely matter &amp;
ſubſtance of them, in him ſelfe. The word Sacraments and Faith
being in them ſelves, neither part nor portion of the Matter and
ſubſtance of theſe benefites, but onely the ſignes, or ſeales, or inſtrumentes of enioying him, who alone is the ſubſtance. And
that onely vnto ſuch, as are partakers of the outward diſpenſation
of the covenant. others who die before they either heare

faith preached, or are made partakers of the Sacraments, ſuch as
are many children of the faithfull, &amp; ſuch alſo as are called like
vnto the thiefe, in the laſt houre: being adopted of God, and iuſtified
through Chriſt, without them, and therefore, when in the
Scriptures, the ſpirit of God doth indifferently attribute our adoption,
iuſtification, ſalvation, &amp;c. vnto Chriſt, and vnto 
                     •
                  aith:
yet they are not of a like large extent, nor alike relatiue, in all
perſons adopted, iuſtified, and ſaved, &amp;c. For albeit actuall beleeving,
doth neceſſarily imply Chriſt: yet to be adopted and iuſtified
through Chriſt, doth not alwayes, in all perſons, neceſſarily
imply actuall beleeving: ſeeing that faith, commeth of hearing
the word preached: and therfore is to be reſtrayned to ſuch
as are by outward diſpenſation called: which all that are adopted,
and iuſtified, are not: for we are to diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe
two things: that is, to be partakers of the covenant, and to bee
partakers of the outward diſpenſatiō of the couenant: and therefore
when it pleaſeth God by outward diſpēſation, to call thoſe
who are within the covenant: theſe meanes are then neceſſarily
required vnto ſalvation. For we are bound to theſe outward
Meanes, when it pleaſeth God to vſe them towards vs, for our
calling: but God is no wayes bound to them, nor his grace in
Chriſt, but that he may freely, by his grace, without them, performe
his Decree through Ieſus Chriſt in vs: after the manner
knowne to him ſelfe: whoſe wayes are paſt finding out, els, if
thoſe meanes, were abſolutely neceſſarie in all, who are within
the covenant: then certainly the children of the faithfull,
who, according to the Scriptures, are within the covenant, dying
without externall diſpenſatiō of the covenant: ſhould, contrarie
to the ſcriptures, not be accounted holy.
               Of this it followeth, that whē it is ſaid in ſcripture, that without
faith it is vnpoſſible to pleaſe God: that wee are to vnderſtand
that ſaying, prudently, leaſt we fall in a dangerous error:
ſo as to eſteeme the children, of whom cōſiſteth the kingdome,
not to be acceptable to God: who notwithſtanding, are baptiſed,
as belonging to God in Chriſt▪ and heyres of that righteouſnes,
which is by faith: although they haue never heard ſaith
preached.
               
                  
Of all theſe things we may eaſily perceive, that ſeeing Chriſt,
who is the matter of our righteouſnes &amp; life, is not the cauſe why
but the Meane, whereby, God doth decree to adopt vs, &amp; iuſtifie
vs, &amp;c. that faith, which is no material but inſtrumental Meane,
can much leſſe be the cauſe why, but a meane, wherby, God doth
predeſtinate vs, to be adopted, iuſtified, and glorified: otherwiſe
faith, which is powerfull onely in reſpect of Chriſt: ſhould be of
greater reſpect, with God, then Chriſt himſelf: which were abominable
to thinke. In danger of which ſinne, many notwithſtā
                  ding
do fall: in defining, both Gods decree, and our iuſtification.
When as they diſtinguiſh not, firſt, betweene the thing which is
decreed, and the cauſe moving God to decree that which he decreed.
Secondly, whē they diſtinguiſh not, in the thing which is
decreed, that whervnto we are ordeyned, from the Meane, wherby
God doth ordayne to adopt vs. &amp; thirdly, whē in the meane,
they diſtinguiſh not, betwixt that, which is abſolutly neceſſarie,
in all within the covenant: frō thoſe things, which only are neceſſarie,
in ſuch, as not only are within the covenant, but alſo are
called by outward diſpenſation thereof: and which are not, ſubſtantial
partes of our righteouſnes, but accidentall meanes therof.
except we will ſay, that to be iuſtified by Chriſt, and by faith,
is one, and the ſame thing, in proper and not borrowed ſpeach.
which is impoſſible: except we hold that faith in proper and not
figurative ſpeach, doth ſignifie Chriſt.
               Theſe overſights, cauſe ſome to make faith the cauſe moving
God to predeſtinate vs to adoption, &amp;c. and others, to eſteeme
faith, not to be the Meane, and that inſtrumentall &amp; that in ſome
caſe only: but the very matter of our righteouſnes. and that not
in borrowed or figurative, but in ſimple and proper ſpeach. of
which matter we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak heereafter.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THis much being ſpoken, of the ſubſtance of the Decree. we
are next to conſider, what is the cauſe that moved God to
make this Decree. Where we are to obſerve, that we doe
not ſpeak of the final cauſe: which is the prayſe of the glorie of

Gods grace. neither yet of the Materiall cauſe, and that which in
the ſchooles is called cauſa procataretica, that is the formoſt after
the firſt, or after the beginning: which in the ſubſtance of Gods
Decree, we haue already declared, to be Chriſt. but the cauſe we
inquire of, is that, which in the ſchooles is called proegumena, that
is to ſay, which goeth before all cauſes, and doth leade, order, &amp;
guide al the reſt. Which the Apoſt. ſetteth down in theſe words:
according to the good pleaſure of his will. by which words, it is evident,
that nothing, either in Chriſt as Mediator, or in Man himſelf, or
any thing els, without God: but only Gods owne will in him
ſelfe, was the cauſe that did move God, to predeſtinate ſuch as
are predeſtinate, and to predeſtinate them vnto that wherevnto
they are predeſtinate, that is adoption: and to predeſtinate them
to be adopted, by no other Meane, except through Ieſus Chriſt
alone. ſo that both Gods action of decreeing, &amp; the perſons who
are predeſtinate, and the thing wherevnto they are predeſtinate,
&amp; the Meanes whereby they are predeſtinate, doth depend vpō
no cauſe without God, but vpon the cauſe that is in God him
ſelf: and vpon no cauſe in God him ſelfe, except only his will.
Which ſometimes is called in the ſcriptures his Mercie, his love,
his grace, his purpoſe, his gift, his good pleaſure and counſell of
his will. And for the clearer vnderſtanding of this point, we are
carefully to marke, theſe two phraſes, conteyned in the deſcription
of predeſtination. The firſt is, that God is ſaid to have predeſtinate
vs in him ſelfe. The ſeconde is, that he is ſaid to haue
predeſtinate vs according to the good pleaſure of his owne wil.
By the firſt of theſe ſayings, the ſpirit of God would teach vs,
that God went not without him ſelfe, neither conſulted with anie
thing but him ſelf, neither looked to any thing that was not
in him ſelf: when he did predeſtinate vs. and ſo cōſequently that
the Decree of God, or predeſtination, is an action of God, not in
Chriſt the Mediator, nor in vs that are his members, but in God
him ſelf. For the benefites of God towards Mankinde, and the
fruites of his love to the veſſels of honour, are clearely diſtinguiſhed
in ſcripture, in three degrees.
               The firſt is, of thoſe things, which God doth in him ſelfe. of
which kinde are, his purpoſe, foreknowledge &amp; predeſtination.
               
                  
The ſecond is, of thoſe things which he doth in Chriſt the Mediator.
of which kinde are our election, redemption, and bleſſing
of vs with all ſpirituall bleſſings, &amp;c.
               The third is, of thoſe thinges which he doeth in vs through
Chriſt. of which kinde are our adoption or calling, our iuſtification,
and ſanctification, and glorification, &amp;c.
               By the ſecond pharſe, the ſpirit of God would teach vs, that
albeit in God, there be many things ſet downe in ſcripture, to
be conſidered, as the fountaynes of Gods working: as namely
his infinite wiſedome, his omnipotent power, his infinite goodnes,
&amp;c. yet this action of predeſtinating vs to adoption, is only
attributed to the will of God. which limiteth the infinitenes,
both of his wiſedome, power, &amp; goodnes, in all his actions outward,
toward the creatures: both in their creation and government,
&amp; diſpenſation of all bleſſings towards vs, both bodily &amp;
ſpirituall. Heereby we may learne, that our bleſſednes, if wee
ſhall examine it, in the cauſe: doth ſurmount all reaſon, and all
the capacitie of the reaſon, of man and Angell: ſeeing it is builded
vpon no reaſon of any creature, or ground of reaſon in any
creature: but vpon the will of the Creator. which is not mooved,
directed, or ruled by any thing, that is in the creature, but by
it ſelfe alone: and is the rule of all reaſon, in the creature, and of
things done by the Creator, vnto the creature.
               This ſhall yet be more eaſily perceyved, if we ſhall ſeverally
conſider it, in thoſe three pointes of the ſubſtance of Gods Decree,
before mentioned: that is in the perſons predeſtinate, in the
thing whereto they are predeſtinate, and the Meane whereby.
               
                  Concerning the perſons: who can give a reaſon why Iacob
ſhould be beloved, and Eſau hated, before any of them, had
done either good or evill: except onely the Will of God?
as it is written. I will shew mercie to whom I will shew mercie: and will
haue compaſsion vpon whom I will haue compaſsiō, Exod. chap. 33. ver. 19.
Rom. chap. 9. ver. 15. And the ſpirit of the Lord, giving the reaſon,
why the Lord did ſet his loue vpon Iſraell, and did chooſe
them: doth remove all reſpectes, which can bee conſidered in
them. Firſt their number, Deut chap. 7. ſaying: The Lord thy God

hath choſen thee to be a precious people vnto him ſelfe above all people that are
vpon the earth: the Lord did not ſet his loue vpon you, nor chooſe you, becauſe
you were more in number, then any people, for you were the fewest of all people.
Secondly, he removeth their power and ſtrength, Deutero.
chap. 8. ſaying: Beware leaſt thou ſay in thy heart, My power and the
ſtrength of myne owne hande, hath prepared me this aboundance. And
thirdly, he remoueth their righteouſnes, Deut. chapt. 9. ſaying:
Speake not thou in thine heart, ſaying: For my righteouſnes, the Lord hath
brought me in to poſſeſſe this Land. And ſhortly after in the ſame chap.
Vnderſtand therefore, that the Lord thy God, giveth thee not, this good Lande
to poſſeſſe it, for thy righteouſnes, for thou art a ſtiffnecked people. Fourthlie,
he cleareth this ground moſt evidently in the 10. chapter of
Deutero. by removing all praerogative and reſpect of right, or
reaſon in reſpect of right, why the Lord ſhould haue choſen thē
aboue any other people, all people being alike belonging to the
Lord, ſaying: Behold heaven, and the heaven of heavens, is the Lord thy
Gods: and the earth, and all that therein is: notwithſtanding the Lord ſet his
delight in thy Fathers, to loue them, and did chooſe their ſeed after them, even
you, above all people, as appeareth this day.
               Moreover, the ſame point is yet further cleared by the Lord
him ſelfe in the Propheſie of Ezechiel, chap. 16. by removing all
reſpect of their worthines, or perfection, declaring their wretched
eſtate, in them ſelues, in filthines, and naturall corruption,
in the very tyme, when the Lord did chooſe them, ſaying: In thy
nativitie, when thou waſt borue, thy navell was not cut, &amp;c. And when I paſſed
by thee, I ſaw thee polluted in thy owne blood, and ſaide vnto thee: When
thou waſt in thy blood, thou shalt live, &amp;c.
               
               And this ground, is made cleare, by Chriſt him ſelfe, Math.
chap. 11. verſ. 25. 26. when he ſpeaketh of the perſons vpon whō
the Lord beſtoweth his grace, and of the reaſon moving him
thereto, ſaying: I thanke thee O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe
thou hast hid theſe things from the wiſe and men of vnderſtanding: and
hast opened them vnto babes, It is ſo Father, becauſe thy good pleaſure was
ſuch. Theſe wordes doe plainely teach vs, that the will of God
onely, without any reaſon in the creature: yea which is more,
contrarie to all reaſon that may ſeeme to bee in the creature, is

the cauſe of Gods mercy towards man. When the ſimple are preferred
to the wyſe: the weake, to the ſtrong: the poore, to the
rich: the vyle, to the honorable: and which is yet more ſtrange:
the ſicke, to the whole: and ſinners, to the righteous. Therefore
to conclude this point, we ſhall ſee ſufficiently the evidēce of it,
by comparing the firſt of Iohn. verſ. 13. with the firſt of Iames,
verſ. 18. in the 1. of Iohn it is ſaid, That the prerogative to bee the fonnes
of God, is given to thoſe who are borne, not of bloods, nor of the will of flesh, nor
of the will of man, but of God. And in Iames it is ſaid: That of his owne
will, God begate vs. Of which it appeareth evidently, that the perſons
who are ordayned vnto adoption, are pre deſtinate, choſen
and called: for no cauſe without God, either in Chriſt as Mediator,
or in them ſelves: but only of Gods free will, &amp; good pleaſure.
For it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth,
but in God, that ſheweth mercy, Rom. chap. 9. ver. 16.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               WE are next to conſider the ſame ground, in that wherevnto
we are ordayned: which is adoption: including
in it, our conformitie with Chriſt in righteouſnes, holines, life
and glory, &amp;c. of all which benefites, there is not one, which is
not the gift of God: and that of meere grace: according to his
wil &amp; good pleaſure. For albeit al bleſſings be in Chriſt: yet neither
he, nor any of thē in him, are given to vs, but according to
the wil of God. ſo that he is a Saviour &amp; Redeemer of none but
of ſuch as pleaſeth God of his good will: ſo that his death &amp; ſatisfaction
for ſinne, is not for any, nor imputed as righteouſnes.
vnto any, for any cauſe, either in Chriſt, or Man: but only to ſuch
as it is the wil of God to give it. therefore doeth the Apoſtle ſay,
Rom. chap. 11. ver. 7. that the Election hath obtayned it. to ſhew vs that
the cauſe of obtayning the promiſe, &amp; all bleſſings therein contayned,
dependeth neither vpon Chriſt as Mediator, nor vpon
Man, but vpon the Lords free choice: who giveth Chriſt, for whō
and to whom he will: and therefore is Chriſt him ſelf called the

gift of God, Iohn chap. 4. ver. 10. and Iohn chap. 3. ver. 16. becauſe
even he is given vnto vs of grace: according as the words
of Iohn declare manifeſtly ſaying: God ſo loved the world, that hee
gave his onely begotten Sonne. And although all power bee given
vnto Chriſt both in heaven and earth: yet in diſpenſing of life,
he is limited by the Fathers will. and therefore ſaith him ſelfe,
that al power is given him to this end, that he may give eternal
life, not to all, ſimply and indifferently: but to all, that the Father
hath given him. Iohn chap. 17. vers 2. And that becauſe ſuch
is the Fathers will: as Chriſt him ſelf witneſſeth, Ioh. cha. 6. ver.
39. This is the will of my Father that ſent me, that of all which hee hath given
me, I should looſe none. and the reaſon why hee reſtrayneth his diſpenſation of life vnto the Fathers will, whoſe will and pleaſure
is that he ſhould ſave only thoſe whom he had given vnto him,
is declared by Chriſt him ſelf in the verſe immediately preceeding,
ſaying: I am come downe from heaven, not that I should doe myne
owne will, but the will of him that ſent me. which wordes plainly teach
vs, that the diſpenſation of life, dependeth not vpon the will of
Chriſt as he is Mediator, much leſſe vpon the will of Man: but
only vpon the good wil &amp; pleaſure of God. And this is cleere in
all the bleſſings beſtowed vpon vs in Chriſt, &amp; of al the meanes
which God grants vs to bring vs to the communion of the bleſſings,
which all, are ſaid in ſcripture to be according to the will
of God: and to be given vs freely by grace: as namely the revelation
of the myſterie of godlines, Eph. chap. 1. ver. 9. &amp; preachers
to reveale it. Eph. cha. 3. ver▪ 7. &amp;c. and Gala. chap. 1. ver. 15. 16. alſo
the benefit of our calling, 2. to Timot. chap. 1. verſ. 9. alſo our
beleeving, and by faith aſſenting to the calling of God, 1. to the
Corint. cha. 12. ver. 9. 11. and Ephe. chap. 2. ver. 8. Phil. chap. 7.
ver. 29. and 2. chap. ver. 13. Rom. chap. 11. ver. 7. Ioh. chap. 6. ver.
36. 37. and 44. 45. and Math. chap. 11. verſ▪ 25. 26. and Mat. chapt.
chap. 13. ver. 11. Alſo the gift of perſeverance, 1. to the Corinthi.
chapt. 1. verſ. 8. 9. and Iohn chap. 10. verſes 28. 29. and 1. Epiſt.
of Iohn chapter. 2. verſ. 27. and chapter 3. verſ. 9. 1. to the Corinthians
chapter 15. verſ. 57. and 58. 1. epiſt. to the Theſſ. chap.
5. ver. 23. 24. and 2. epiſt. to the Theſſal. chapter 16. verſe 17.

and I eremy chap. 31. verſ. 32. 33. and chap. 32. ver. 40. &amp; ſo forth
of all the remanent benefites of God, and namely of our Iuſtification:
for we are iuſtified freely by grace. And therefore even
the righteouſnes of Chriſt whereby we are iuſtified, is ſaid to be
the gift, of God, &amp; that of free grace, Rom. chap. 5. verſ. 15. 16. 17.
For of whatſoever worth, vertue, &amp; value, the ſatisfaction made
by Chriſt be of in Gods ſight: far exceeding al vnworthines and
weaknes of all mankinde: yet it is no farther extended nor given
to any moe, but ſuch as is the good will &amp; pleaſure of God,
Neither is it contrarie vnto this, that all the bleſſings of God are
ſaid to be in Chriſt, and we ſaid to be bleſſed with all ſpirituall
bleſſings in him. For neither he nor they in him are made ours
for any cauſe, either in him, or vs: but onely by the will &amp; good
pleaſure of God, which is manifeſt by the ſaying of the Apoſtle,
Ephe. chap. 1. ver. 6. which is, That God by his grace hath freely made
vs acceptable to him ſelfe in his beloved Sonne. Which wordes doe evidently
witnes, that although GOD give vs no bleſſing but in
Chriſt, yet the cauſe moving God is only his owne grace and
good pleaſure: which excludes all other cauſe whatſoever, either
in Chriſt or in vs. Neither is this to be vnderſtood of the benefites
themſelves onely, but alſo of their meaſure: which alſo
dependeth wholy vpon the purpoſe and good pleaſure of Gods
will. Which is cleare by the ſpeech of Chriſt, in the 20. chapt. of
Math. ver. 23. And Marke, chap. 10. ver. 40. where he ſayeth: To ſit
at my right hande and at my left hande, is not myne to give: but to whom it is
prepared of my Father.
               
               Moreover, this is not onely to be vnderſtood of the bleſſinges
them ſelves, and of their meaſure: but alſo of all the circumſtances
concerning their diſpenſation. Which wholy depend vpon
the will of God: who hath aſſigned the ſeaſons, which were ordeyned
before: and the bounds of mens habitatiō, Act. chap. 17.
verſ. 26. And who hath put the times and ſeaſons in his owne power. Actes
chap. 1. verſ. 7. and hath appointed a day of grace to every one
that ſhalbe called. Hebr. chap. 3. ver. 13. and 15. and Hebr. chap.
4 verſ. 7. 8. and 9. ſo that the reaſon that one is called from the
wombe: another in his mid-age: another in the houre of his

death. why the Goſpell is ſalvation, firſt vnto the Iewes, and
next vnto the Gentiles: why Chriſt did come at ſuch a time: died
at ſuch a time: and the Gentiles not called till ſuch a time: is the
onlie appointmēt of Gods will, who, as ſaith the Apoſtle, Ephe.
chap. 1. verſ. 11. Doth all things according to the counſell of his owne will.
Thus it is manifeſt, that not onely the bleſſings in Chriſt, &amp; the
meaſure of them: but all circumſtances of theſe bleſſings, either
in reſpect of perſons, place, time, or maner, doe depend wholie
vpon the counſell of Gods will.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               IT reſteth now thirdly, that we trye the truth of this ſame
ground in the third point of the ſubſtance of Gods Decree,
that is in the Meane whereby we are predſtinate vnto adoption,
which is Ieſus Chriſt. of whom it is manifeſt in the Scriptures,
that he is the Meane of our happines by the ſame will of
God. as is evident by the Apoſtle, Coloſſ. chap. 1. verſ. 19. &amp; 20.
For it pleaſed the Father that in him should all fulnes dwell, and by him to reconcile
all things to him ſelfe, making peace by the blood of his croſſe. For firſt
there was no cauſe in Chriſt, why hee ſhould haue beene made
Man, and ſinne for Man. Secondly, there was no cauſe nor reaſon
in vs which could move the Father, to give him to the death
for vs: or which could move him, to become our brother, and to
lay down his life for vs, but as ſayth Iohn, cha. 10. verſ. 18. He receyved
this commandement from the Father to laye downe his life. And the
Apoſtle Peter Acts chap. 2. ver, 23. ſayeth plainly: That he was delivered
by the determinate counſell and foreknowledge of God. And the
ſcriptures doe witnes, Hebr. chap. 3. ver. 2. &amp; Hebr. chap. 5. ver.
5. that Chriſt did not take this office to him ſelfe to be either
King, Prieſt or Prophet of the houſe of God: but that the Father
did give it him. and as he receyved it from the Father, ſo doeth
he performe it, not according to his owne will, but according
to the will of the Father that ſent him. that is, hee layes downe
his life for none but ſuch as the Father willeth: that is the ſheep
which the Father giveth him: that he ſhould give them eternall

life, Ioh. chap. 10. 14. 15. 16. compared to Ioh. chap. 17. ver. 2. and
Eſay chap. 8. ver. 18. compared with Hebr. chap. 2. ver. 13. 14. and
15. 16. &amp; 17. neither doth he make interceſſion for any but for
ſuch as the Father had given him: but ſecludeth all who were
not given him of the Father from al benefite of his interceſſion,
and fruit of his death, Ioh. cha. 17. ver. 9. Thirdly, he manifeſteth
the name of God, and giveth the wordes and the glorie which
the Father hath given him, to no others, ſaving thoſe alone
whom the Father had given him. In the ſame chapter 6. verſ.
22. and 26. Fourthly, he giveth eternall life to none but ſuch
as the Father hath given him. Iohn chapter 6. verſes 37. 38.
and 39. And Iohn chapter 10. verſ. 26. 27. 28. 29. And Iohn
chapter 17. verſ. 2. for the worke which he performed on earth▪
the Father did give it him, that hee ſhould doe it: as he him ſelf
witneſſeth Iohn chapter 17. and verſe 4. Wherefore alſo in the
performing thereof, when the bitternes of that cuppe which
the Father had given him to drinke, maketh him in his agonie
to will, If it were poſſible that it might paſſe from him: He rangeth
his owne will in order, and ſubmitteth him ſelfe to the
will of his Father, ſaying: But not my will, but thy will be done.
Mathew chap. 26. verſ. 39. and 42. Of all which groundes it
evidently followeth, that what Chriſt is, as Mediatour: and
what he doeth, as Mediatour: and to whom he doth any thing,
by Mediaton and interceſſion, is all by the will and appointement
of GOD, according to his good pleaſure. Whoſe Decree,
and free election, according to his will, boundeth and limiteth
IESVS Chriſt the Mediatour, in his ſuffering, interceſſion, and
whole performance of his office, and diſpenſation of all bleſſings
vnto righteouſnes and life, as is cleare in the 11. chapt. to
the Romanes, verſes 5. and 7.
               Of all that is ſpoken, touching either the ſubſtance or cauſe of
Gods Decree: we may eaſilie perceyve, that the whole Decree
of God, in all the ſubſtance of it, dependeth vpon nothing but
onely vpon the will of God: ſo that he predeſtinates, becauſe
it is his will, and he predeſtinates ſo many and no moe, becauſe
it is his will. And hee predſtinates them to adoption, becauſe

it is his will. and he predeſtinates this adoption to be thorough
Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe it is his will.
               Whileſt men in humble reverence, doe not acknowledge
this, and acquieſce in it, as the trueth of this matter, they not
onely fall in blaſphemouſe errores againſt God: but involve
themſelves in the daunger of that curſe, pronounced by the
Prophet Eſay, chapt. 45. verſ. 10. Woe be to him that ſtriveth with
his Maker. Woe vnto him that ſayeth to his Father, what hast thou begotten?
Or to his Mother, What haſt thou brought foorth? Which ſurelie
they doe, which ſearch for a reaſon of this will of GOD, as
though the Lord could not be iuſt, in ordayning ſome vnto adoption,
and not others, vpon his onely will: but that ſome
cauſe there muſt be in the creatures of this difference of his will:
what is this elſe but to buyld the equitie of Gods doeings vpon
the creature, and not vpon God the Creator him ſelfe. making
things iuſt, not becauſe he willeth them, but becauſe he willeth
them according to that, which he findeth in the creature: and
which in the iudgement of man, ſeemeth to be a iuſt reaſon why
God ſhould doe ſo. even as though the Potter, of one &amp; the ſame
lumpe of clay, did not freely according to his owne will, make
one veſſel to honor, &amp; another to diſhonor, without any reſpect
of any worthines, or any reaſon whatſoever taken frō the clay.
Surely it is a wretched Divinitie which doth not ſimply acknow
ledge all things iuſt which God willeth: evē becauſe he willeth
thē: although they not only paſſe the capacitie, but alſo appeare
moſt cōtrary to humane reaſon. For, are not his iudgements vnſearchable,
&amp; his wayes paſt finding out? who thē ſhal finde out
the reaſon of his counſels, and declare the cauſes of his will? We
will conclude this point, with the ſaying of Auguſtin, touching
theſe mē, lib. pri. ca. 2. de Geneſ cont. Manich. They ſeeke to know the cauſes
of Gods will, when as the will of God it ſelfe, is the cauſe of all things that are:
for if the will of God have a cauſe: there is ſomething that goes before the will
of God, which is not lawfull to beleeve.
               
               The vſe we are to make hereof, in the doctrine of iuſtification,
is great: for firſt, heereby wee learne, that Gods Decree
is not buylded vppon our righteouſnes, as the cauſe thereof,

but by the contrarie, that our righteouſnes is builded vpon Gods
Decree. For God doeth not predeſtinate vs, becauſe of our righteouſnes:
but he maketh vs righteous, becauſe he hath predeſtinate
vs: ſo that whether our righteouſnes conſiſt in Chriſt and
his ſufferings, or as ſome doe thinke in workes, or as others doe
eſteeme in faith: yet it ſtill holdeth, that this righteouſnes, is never
the cauſe why God predeſtinateth vs. Secondly, wee learne
of this point: that whatſoever be our righteouſnes, we muſt goe
aboue our ſelves, &amp; aboue our righteouſnes, to ſearch the cauſe
why it is ours. For it is not any thing in vs, nor any thing in
that, that is our righteouſnes, but the will of God in God himſelfe,
which is the ground of our enioying it. Thirdly, we learne
heereby, that whatſoever we ſeclude from the Meanes of our
righteouſnes, iuſtification, and life, yet Chriſt can never be ſecluded.
ſeeing God Decrees, to doe all what he decrees: thorough
him alone. Thus much concerning the Decree of God,
and the nature thereof.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               NOW followeth the ſecond point: which ſtandeth in the
knowledge of Chriſt, as he is Mediatour. Whereof, becauſe
divers things have bene already ſpoken, we wil be
the ſhorter. The mayne point, chieflie to be conſidered in this
head, is this: that no man is made, that, vnto the which GOD
doth predeſtinate him, in him ſelfe and through him ſelfe, but
in and through another, which is IESVS Chriſt onely: who
being ordeyned of God, the Meane of al his mercie to Mākinde,
he commeth in, as Mediatour betweene God &amp; vs, in all things
decreed of God for vs: ſo, as we are to expect nothing of all that
is decreed concerning the veſſels of honour, whether it bee in
making of vs ſonnes, or making vs cōforme to the Image of his
Sonne, in righteouſnes and glorie: but only in and through Ieſus
Chriſt our Lord: in whom alone all the promiſes of God are
yea and amen. For he is the firſt borne among all the ſonnes of
God: and the beginning and firſt begotten of the dead: for it is

the Fathers will, that in all things hee have the praeeminence,
Rom. chap. 8. ver. 29. Col. chap. 1. ver. 18.
               Thus, albeit God in him ſelfe and of him ſelfe ordayne vs to
great dignitie and manifold vnſpeakeable bleſſings, yet this honour
doeth he reſerve vnto his only begotten ſonne, that of all
theſe bleſſings we ſhall enioye none, except in &amp; through him
onely: ſo that it is true that we are ordayned to nothing without
Chriſt: but not in that deceitfull ſenſe, whereby the mindes
of many are deluded: as though he were the cauſe why GOD
doth ordeyne vs to adoption. The Scripture teacheth vs farre otherwiſe:
diſtinguiſhing betwixt the cauſe why God decreeth
vs to adoption: and the cauſe why he ordeyneth vs to this adoption
through Chriſt onely. Setting downe the cauſe of the Decree,
to be his owne will &amp; good pleaſure in him ſelfe. And declaring
the cauſe, why he ordeyneth vs to be adopted through
Chriſt to be this, that Chriſt might be the firſt borne among manie
brethren: and that he might have the praeeminence in all
things: wherevpon it followeth, that albeit he be not the cauſe
why we are ordeyned to adoption, yet notwithſtanding ſeeing
it is Gods will to performe towards vs his gracious purpoſe and
good pleaſure of his wil, only in and through Chriſt, that of neceſſitie,
we muſt firſt enioy him, before we can enioy any thing,
of that that is decreed. And therefore it was the Fathers will
that in him ſhould all fulnes dwell, Coloſſ. chap. 1. verſ. 19. That
out of his fulnes, we all should receyve. Iohn chapt. 1. verſ. 16. And for
this ſame cauſe is it ſaid, That God hath made him wiſedome, righteouſnes,
ſanctification, and redemption, and that vnto vs, 1. Corinth. chapt. 1.
verſe 13.
               For whatſoever God hath made Ieſus Chriſt the Mediatour,
he hath made him that for our cauſe: ſo that the love of God to
vs and the good pleaſure of his wil towards vs, is the cauſe why
Chriſt is made of God the meane of our ſalvation. And therefore,
in the conſideration of Gods Decree, Chriſt as Mediatour,
commeth in order, after the conſideration of that wherevnto we
are ordayned: although in the executiō and performāce of Gods
Decree, Chriſt in vs muſt goe before all other things ordayned

for vs: for that is the nature of all Meanes, which are ſubordinate
to that, whereof they are appointed to be Meanes.
               Thus God firſt in order purpoſeth and decreeth what to doe
to vs: and ſecondly by what Meanes: but when hee performeth
his Decree, he firſt prepareth the Meanes: and then accompliſheth
thereby, his purpoſe and decree towardes vs. For if the
Lord had never ordayned vs, that are men, to bee made his
ſonnes: he had never ordayned his ſonne, to bee made a Man,
this is cleere by the Apoſtles ſpeech wherein he declareth the
cauſe why the ſonne of God, did take mans nature vpon him.
Hebr. chap. 2. ver. 14. ſaying: For aſmuch therefore, as the children were
partakers of flesh and blood, even he likewiſe tooke part with them: And
thereafter ſhewing the cauſe why not only he tooke our nature
                     •
                  
but alſo did take it with the ſame infirmities (ſinne only except)
wherewith our nature is indued, he vſeth theſe ſpeeches: For it
became him in all thinges to be made like to his brethren. Hebrewes chap.
2. verſ. 17. according to which grounde it is ſaide in another
place, That God ſent his Sonne in the flesh, in the ſimilitude of ſinnefull flesh,
Roman. chap. 8. verſ. 3. This point is evidently cleare by the
ſame Apoſtles ſpeech, Galath. chap. 4. verſes 4. and 5. when hee
ſheweth the ende wherefore God ſent his ſonne in the fleſh, ſaying:
VVhen the fulnes of tyme was come, God ſent foorth his owne Sonne,
made of a woman, &amp;c. that we might receyve the adoption. Letting vs
ſee that in Gods execution hee giveth vs the adoption to the
which he ordayned vs by the ſame Meane thorough the which
he ordayned to give it vs. Thus we may ſee evidently, that that
parte of Gods Decree, touching the Meane of our adoption:
doeth in order of Decreeing, depende vpon the former parte,
touching the adopting of vs: but in order of performing, the
ſending of Chriſt, made of a woman, and made vnder the Law,
and made righteouſnes, ſanctification, and redemption, &amp;c.
doth goe before our adoptiō. For he was not made the cauſe of
eternall ſalvation to his owne, till he was perfited, Hebr. chap.
5. verſ. 9. For which cauſe the Apoſtle ſayeth Hebr. chap. 2. verſ.
10. when hee gives the reaſon why he was made to taſte of

death: That Chriſt being to bring many children to glorie, it became him
for whom are all theſe things, and by whom are all theſe thinges, to perfite or
to conſecrate the Prince of their ſalvation, through afflictions.
               
               This ſhall be yet more cleare if wee conſider who it is that
is appointed the Meane, of our adoption, that is not the Father,
nor yet the holy Ghoſt, but the Sonne only. and that becauſe
hee onely is that, vnto the which wee are ordayned.
For this grounde we muſt holde: that what ſo ever wee are
made by grace: it muſt firſte bee in GOD him ſelfe: and
then made ours by our communion and fellowſhip with
GOD.
               Now this bleſſing of ſonne-ſhippe which is ordeyned vnto
vs, is no propertie of the Father, nor yet of the Holy Ghoſt,
but of the ſeconde perſon onely: who by that propertie is diſtinguiſhed,
both from the Father, and from the Holy Ghoſt:
and therefore although the Father and the Holy Ghoſt doe
with the Sonne, not onely ordeyne vs to adoption, but alſo
adopt vs: yet they neither ordeyne vs to adoption, neyther doe
adopt vs, through any, but the Sonne alone: for the Father and
the Holy Ghoſt are not the Sonne, neither can be, becauſe their
perſonall properties are incommunicable: howſoever their
naturall properties bee common: yea one and the ſame in all
three. becauſe the nature of all three is moſt ſimply one and the
ſame.
               Of which it commeth to paſſe, that we being adopted thorough
Chriſt: and ſo conſequently called to the communion
of Chriſt in that, which he is by ſubſiſting, that is ſonnes: wee
are alſo made partakers of the Divine nature, as ſayeth the Apoſtle
Peter. that is, we are made like to all three, in that which
they are by nature. for all three have but the ſelfe ſame common
nature and eſſence, albeit in ſubſiſting and perſonalitie,
none be that that the other is, and therefore none of them, except
the Sonne alone, can bee a meete Mediatour betwixt
GOD and vs in the worke of our adoption. For this office of
Mediation is not the office of the Divine nature: but of a
Divine perſon, that hath the Divine nature.
               
                  
For if it were the office of the Divine nature which is common
to all three alike: and as we have ſaid one and the ſame in all
three, ſurely it ſhould no leſſe belong to the Father, and to the
Holy Ghoſt, then to the Sonne: but as ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. to Timoth.
chap. 2. ver. 5. There is but one Mediatour betwixt God and Man,
that is the Man Christ Ieſus.
               
               But as every common nature is communicate to others by
their perſonall ſubſiſting, flowing from a perſon of that ſame
nature (for no nature hath any exiſting but by ſubſiſting) even
ſo we can not be made pertakers of the Divine nature, except
firſt we have our ſubſiſting from one that is of the ſame nature,
and from that perſon of that nature, which is that, in perſonalitie
and ſubſiſting, which we are ordayned to be: that is fonnes.
for we muſt be pertakers of the Divine nature, by ſubſiſting the
ſonnes of God, which cannot be naturally, neither in, nor thorough
our ſelves: therefore it is ordayned to be through Chriſt.
by making vs one with him, who by nature, is the onely Sonne
of God, that by our fellowſhip with him, through grace, in that
which he onely is by ſubſiſting, or perſonalitie: we only conſequently
by grace, be made pertakers of the Divine nature, in our
conformitie to the Image of God.
               For as among men nature doth not produce nature, but one
perſon by procreation of another perſon doth communicate the
ſame nature: even ſo in the Godhead, the nature produceth not
nature, elſe there ſhould be many Deities, &amp; ſo many Gods: but
a perſon produceth a perſon: and production of a perſon, carieth
with it, communion of nature: even ſo God doth firſt make vs
his children by adoption in Chriſt: in which reſpect he is ſaide
in the ſcriptures to beget vs: and we are ſaid to be borne of God:
which birth bringes with it the participation of the Divine nature.
               Thus we have to diſtinguiſh our communion and fellowſhip
with Chriſt: which God by his grace beſtowes vpon vs, in that
perſonall proprietie of his ſonne: whereby we are made members
of his bodie, fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones: that
is, the ſonnes of God, and brethrē of Chriſt: which is our adoption.

From that communion which foloweth herevpon, &amp; ſtandeth
in our participation of the Divine nature: whereby we are
made one with Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt. Thus by Gods
mercie, in calling vs to the felowſhip of Chriſt in his ſonne-ſhip:
the Father of Chriſt is made our Father, and his ſpirit our ſpirit,
and ſo conſequently the nature of all three communicated vnto
vs. And for this firſt vnion with Chriſt, which ſtandeth in the
communion of the dignitie of his ſonne-ſhip: all Gods children
are ſaid in the ſcriptures to be one, in Chriſt, Galath. chap. 3. ver.
28. And the whole body myſticall is ſaid to be but one, and is
called Chriſt, 1. Corinth. chap. 12. ver. 12. and for that cauſe, the
promiſe of God is ſaid to be made, to the ſeede, as to one, &amp; not
to the ſeedes, as to many, Galat. chap. 3. ver. 16. where we may
perceyve, the vnſpeakeable goodnes and infinite wiſedome of
God, in his Decree: Goodnes, in ordayning vs to be his ſonnes:
and Wiſedome, in ordayning him onely to be the meane of our
adoption, who in him ſelfe only is that which GOD ordayneth
vs to be. Of which it is manifeſt, that the Decree of our adoption,
goeth in order before all, not only other benefites in Chriſt,
but alſo before the ordayning of Chriſt him ſelfe, to be a Mediator.
For if this office of Mediation, did not hang and depend vpon
that, which we are ordeyned to be, ſurely the Father, or the
holy Ghoſt, ſhould no leſſe have bene Mediators, then the ſonne.
Beſides theſe things, it is alſo heereby manifeſt, that the benefite
of adoption, is the firſt of all benefites in Chriſt, and foundation
of all the reſt. For which cauſe it is that Gods Decree is moſt
properly defined from it: but of this we ſhall haue occaſion to
ſpeake hereafter.
               The vſe that we haue to make of this point, in the doctrine of
iuſtification, is: that ſeeing God, ordayneth vs to nothing, but
through Chriſt: our righteouſnes, can not conſiſt of any thing,
that is not in Chriſt: for as we are made all other thing, whatſoever
we are made, in him, ſo alſo are we made the righteouſnes
of God in him, 2. Corint. chap. 5. ver. 21. which ground wel marked,
doth cleare many errors: ſpecially thoſe, which are about

the matter of our righteouſnes. of which, it is a wonder, that ſuch
controverſies ſhould be among learned men. when as the Scripture
of God ſpeaketh plainely, that God hath made Chriſt, righteouſnes
vnto vs. 1 Corinth. chap. 1. verſ. 30. And that hee is, all
in all things. Coloſſ. chap. 3. verſ. 11. And that he filleth all, in
all things. Eph. chap. 1. verſ. 23. Wherevpon it followeth, that
neither, in whole, nor in part, can poſſibly our righteouſnes,
conſiſt in any thing, that is in our ſelves, nor yet in any other
thing without our ſelves, but in Chriſt only. And thus much
concerning the ſecond point.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE third thing, needfull to be knowne, for the right vnderſtanding
of the nature of Gods ſaving benefites is, the
order in the which they are Decreed, and accordinglie
diſpēſed vnto vs. In which point, I know there is great neede, of
circumſpect &amp; conſiderate dealing: becauſe, albeit in my iudgement,
the miſtaking of this point, bee no ſmall occaſion of the
errors, which are mantayned by many of great learning, as in other
things; ſo ſpeciallie in the point of iuſtification: yet, notwithſtanding
the ſpeaking againſt an error, by the moſt part
received: and almoſt contradicted by none: muſt needes at the
firſt, bee diſtaſtfull to many: except their mindes bee by grace
ſanctified, with a greater love of the truthe, then of themſelves.
The maine point which cleareth all, ſtandeth in this, whether
adoption or Iuſtification be in order firſt. The greater part, doe
holde that Iuſtification is firſt. ſo that firſt, we muſt bee iuſtified
in Chriſt, before wee be adopted to bee ſonnes. and therefore,
they devide reconciliation, which they make to comprehend
both: in Iuſtification, as the firſt part, and adoption as the ſecond.
But what inconvenience may aryſe vpon this opinion,
and what an open entry it maketh to many errors, we ſhall perceyve
by theſe things that follow.
               Some there bee, and thoſe but fewe: that holde the contrary

opinion: and doe rather point at it, then expreſly treate of it.
eſteeming Adoption, to be before Iuſtification: or rather to bee
as if it were the whole: and Iuſtification reconciliation &amp;c. to be
comprehended in it, as the parts thereof: or to follow vpon it,
as inſeperable accidents and infallible conſequences thereof:
or to bee nothing, except the way of Adoption. Which opinion
ſeemeth moſt to agree with the Scriptures.
               The ſpecial ground wherby the firſt of theſe opinions is maintayned,
is (beſides other places of Scripture) that ſaying which
is in Iohn chap. 1. verſ. 12. which is: as manie as receiued him to them he
gaue prerogative to bee the ſonnes of God, that is, to thoſe that beleeved in his
name. Vpon which place, they, who defend the former opinion,
ſeeme chieflie to rely. as though it did import, Iuſtification neceſſarilie
to goe before Adoption: becauſe that Chriſt, giveth
prerogative to be the ſonnes of God, to none, except ſuch as firſt
have received him, and have beleeved in his name.
               But before I either ſpeake of theſe opinions, or yet of this place
of Iohn: it ſhall bee firſt expedient, for the better ſatisfaction of
all mindes, to lay ſome groundes, vpon the knowledge whereof,
the light of this point dependeth much, in my iudgement.
               Beſides other grounds, there be five of greateſt conſequence
and moſt expedient to be knowne, for clearing our iudgement
in the knowledge of the order of Adoption and Iuſtification.
               The firſt is, the order of ſubſiſting in the bleſſed and eternall
Trinitie.
               The ſecond is, the diſtinct conſideration of the order of Gods
gracious love, in the three ſeverall obiects, in the which it is to
be conſidered.
               The third is, the order of our ſenſe and perception of the bleſſings
of God in our ſelves.
               The fourth is, the difference of extent and largenes, of one
benefite, in reſpect of another, amongſt themſelves, by mutuall
reference of one to another.
               The fiſt and laſt is: the conſideration of the covenant of grace,
which God hath made with man in Chriſt.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER X.
               THE firſt ground, is moſt neceſſarie to be knowne: not only
to the end that we may know God in him ſelfe aright:
but alſo, that we may know, his gracious working towards
vs aright. Wherein by the ſpeciall conſideration of the
Trinitie: three things are to be marked.
               Firſt, That every worke of grace, is the worke of all three.
               Secondly, That the order of their working, is according to
the order of their ſubſiſting: ſo that in every worke, the Father
is firſt, the Sonne ſecond, the holy Ghoſt third, in order of working.
               Thirdly, That in reſpect of theſe two former groundes, theſe
workes of grace, which according to the maner and order of
ſubſiſting, are moſt properly attributed to every perſon: according
as their maner of working doth chieflie ſhine and appeare
in every worke: are to be ordered, according to the order of the
perſons them ſelves. So that the actions, attributed to God the
Father, are in order firſt: the actions attributed to the ſonne, in
order ſeconde: and the actions attributed to the holy Ghoſt, in
order third. And this conſideration, of the order of Gods working,
is no more to be altered, then the nature of God it ſelfe: in
whom the vnitie of eſſence, is no more eſſentiall, then the Trinitie
of perſons.
               Theſe three pointes, are cleare in the ſcriptures of God. The
firſt: when one, and the ſelfe ſame worke, is ſometimes attributed
to the Father, ſometimes to the Sonne, and ſometimes to the
holy Ghoſt. to teach vs that not onely theſe three perſons, are
but one God in nature: but further, that what thinges the one
doth, the other doth alſo. according as Chriſt ſayeth: My Father
worketh vnto this time, and I alſo worke, Iohn chap. 5. ver. 17. And againe:
VVhatſoever things the Father doeth, the ſame things doth the Sonne.
likewiſe,
Ihon chap. 5. verſ. 19.
               The ſecond of theſe pointes, is likewiſe manifeſt in the ſcripture:
when in one and the ſame worke: The Father is made in

order of working, firſt: the Sonne, ſecond: and the holy Ghoſt,
third: according to the ſaying of Chriſt: The Sonne can doe nothing
of him ſelfe, except he ſee the Father working. Iohn chap. 5. ver. 19. And
againe, I doe nothing of my ſelf. as I heare I iudge. Ioh. cha. 5. ver. 30.
And againe: The thinges that I ſpeake, I ſpeake them ſo as the Father ſaid
vnto me, Iohn chap. 12. ver. 53. And againe, The Spirit he shall not
ſpeake of him ſelfe: but whatſoever he shall heare, he shall ſpeake. He shall
glorifie me, for he shall receyve of myne, and shew it vnto you. Iohn chapt.
16. verſes 13. and 14. By which ſpeeches, it is manifeſt, that as
the Father, ſubſiſteth in order firſt, and ſo in order poſſeſſeth life
before the Sonne: and the Sonne before the holy Ghoſt: even
ſo in operation of life and all good grace in vs: the Father in order
worketh before the Sonne, and the Sonne, before the Holy
Ghoſt. According to which order, we are taught in the ſcriptures,
to worſhip God, praying and giving thankes to the Father,
in the Sonne, by the holy Ghoſt. according to the order of
our acceſſe vnto God: which is vnto the Father, through the
Sonne by the Spirit, Ephe. chap. 2. verſ. 18. Drawing neare vnto
God, in our aſcending vp to him, according to the order of
his drawing neare vnto vs. that is, we aſcende by God, in God,
vnto God: who of him ſelfe, and in him ſelfe, and by him ſelfe,
worketh all grace in vs. of him ſelfe as the Father, in him ſelfe,
as the Sonne: and by him ſelfe, as the holy Ghoſt. For no man
hath any grace, either of him ſelfe, but of God alone, and that as
he is the Father: either in him ſelfe, but in God alone, and that
as he is the Sonne: either by him ſelfe, but by God alone, &amp; that
as he is the Holy Ghoſt.
               The third point, is likewiſe manifeſt in ſcripture. When as the
worke of creation, and of the firſt beeing and exiſting of all
thinges, be it either naturall or ſpirituall, is attributed vnto the
firſt perſon: of whom are all things and the worke of diſpenſation,
and redemption is attributed to the ſeconde perſon: in
whom onely we enioye all grace. And the worke of conſummation
and ſanctification is attributed to the holy Ghoſt. For
according to the diſtinction, that is inward, aryſing from the
inward properties, whereby theſe perſons are diſtinguiſhed:

there is alſo a diſtinction outward, in the workes of outwarde
diſpenſation: according to the terme in which is the beginning
of acting. Neither is this only to be conſidered, in the actions of
outward diſpenſation, towardes vs: but in the actions that are
inward in God himſelfe. according to which ground, Chriſt
acknowledgeth that the Father hath given him to have life in
himſelfe. Iohn chap. 6. verſ. 26. For albeit all operation of bleſſings
in vs, proceede from the nature and eſſence of God, as the
common beginning and terme in all three: yet notwithſtāding
thy are reſtrayned in reſpect of order, to one beginning: that is
to one of thoſe three perſons: according as in every worke, the
manner of every perſons working, either of, in, or by, doth moſt
cleerely ſhine.
               And as they are thus reſtrayned: ſo alſo they are in order
to bee conſidered. So that whatſoever workes of grace, are
chieflie attributed to the Father, muſt needes in order of diſpenſation
bee firſt. And what workes are chieflie attributed
to the Sonne, muſt needes in order bee ſecond. And the workes
chieflie attributed to the H. Ghoſt, muſt needes in order bee
third.
               Of this it will follow, that adoption being chiefly the action
of God the Father (for none ſave he who beares the perſon of a
Father can properly bee ſaid to adopt any to be Sonnes: for the
Father and the Sonne are relative) muſt in order goe before our
redemption, which is chiefly the action of the Sonne: for he only
dyed to redeeme vs: and he only bought vs by his blood vnto
God. Revel. chap. 5. verſ. 9.
               And ſeeing our Iuſtice or righteouſnes, conſiſteth in the action
of our redemption; for as ſayeth the Apoſtle Rom. chapter 3.
verſ. 24. we are iuſtified freelie by his grace through the redemption which is
in Chriſt Ieſus. Therefore it muſt follow, that iuſtification in order
of diſpenſation muſt follow adoption. For albeit all bleſſings be
beſtowed vpon vs of the Father, in the Sonne, in whom alone
wee are adopted iuſtified and glorified, &amp;c. Yet ſtill the former
reſpect of order muſt perpetually be kept.
               
                  
For which cauſe it is that in the Scriptures, the Decree of God
or his predeſtination, is defined from the benefite of adoption:
as the firſt and chiefeſt of all bleſſings: and the firſt fruite of the
love of God, in the firſt Perſon, that is the Father vnto Mankinde.
               And for this ſame cauſe is it that in the Scriptures wee are
ſaid firſt to bee the Fathers: and to bee given by him vnto the
Sonne: for as the Sonne hath nothing of himſelfe, but of the Father:
ſo he hath not vs of himſelfe but of the Father. Therefore
ſayeth he: Thyne they were and thou gaveſt them vnto me, Iohn chap. 17.
verſ. 6. And againe; Behold I and the Children whom God hath given mee.
Eſay. chap. 8. verſ. 18. and Hebr. chap. 2. verſ. 13.
               Thirdly it is for the ſame reſpect, that in the Scriptures the
firſt of all the workes of grace in vs, which is the bringing of vs
vnto Chriſt, is ſtill attributed vnto the Father: as his ſpeciall
worke. For no man commeth vnto the Sonne, but by the Father. Iohn
chapter 6. verſe 65. Neither can any man come to mee ſayeth
Chriſt, except the Father which hath ſent mee, drawe him. Iohn
chapter 6. verſ. 44. Vpon which worke, dependeth two other
principall workes of grace.
               The firſt is, our embracing and receyving of the Sonne: according
to the ſaying of Chriſt, All that the Father giveth mee, shall
come vnto mee. Iohn chapter 6. verſ. 37.
               The ſecond is, the infalliblenes of Chriſt his ſaving of vs. according
to his owne ſaying: This is the Fathers will that hath ſent mee:
that of all which hee hath given mee, I should looſe nothing: but should rayſe it
vp againe at the laſt daye. Iohn chapter 6. verſ. 39. For whatſoever
we have of Chriſt, whether it be righteouſnes, ſanctification or
life, &amp;c. it wholy dependeth, vpon this worke of the Father his
giving and bringing vs vnto him. For as the Sonne hath vs not
of himſelfe but of the Father; ſo he diſpenſeth nothing to vs of
himſelfe: neither is hee redeemer to vs of himſelfe, but according
to the will of the Father. For according to the order of the
perſons, ſo becomes God our God in order. And therfore according
to that order, are we baptized in the name of the Father,

of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt. God ſealing vs vnto himſelfe,
and his bleſſings vnto vs, according to the order that he is
our God: and in which he diſpenſeth his bleſſings vnto vs.
               Thus by this firſt ground it is manifeſt, that the benefite of
ſonne-ſhipp, (which is the proper worke of God, as he is the
Father) muſt in order be firſt of all. and next the benefite of freedome
and chriſtian libertie by redemption, and ſo conſequentlie
of righteouſnes, muſt be ſecond in order: ſeeing it is the work
of the Sonne. For If the Sonne make vs free, we shalbe free in deed, ſaith
Chriſt, Iohn, chap. 8. ver. 36. and that the worke of ſanctification
or glorification in the which it comprehended ſanctification,
muſt be third in order of diſpenſation: ſeeing it is the worke
of the Holy Ghoſt. And this order the Apoſtle plainly confirmeth,
in ſetting downe the order of Gods working, in the execution
and accompliſhing of his Decree, Rom. chap. 8. verſe 30.
ſaying: VVhom he predestinated, them alſo he hath called: and whom hee
hath called. them alſo he hath iuſtified: and whem he hath iuſtified, them hee
hath alſo glorified. The whole execution of Gods Decree beeing
compriſed in theſe three workes: our calling, our iuſtification,
and glorification: according to the number of the perſons and
order of their working. For (as we haue marked) two ſpeciall
bleſſings in Gods Decree or Predeſtination, are ordayned vnto
vs. The firſt and principall is our adoption, or making vs ſonnes
through Chriſt. according as is manifeſt by the definition of
predeſtination, ſet downe by the Apoſtle, Ephe. chap. 1. verſe 5.
The ſecond which is included and implyed in the firſt, is, The
making vs (now being ſonnes) to be like to the Image of the
Sonne of God. as is cleere by the definition of predeſtination ſet
downe by the Apoſtle, Rom. chapter 8. verſ. 29. Both theſe bleſſings
are accompliſhed in the execution of this Decree. The firſt
bleſſing which is adoption, is chieflie performed in our calling:
when as we are brought by the Father to the Sonne, and are given
vnto him, and haue it given vnto vs to come vnto him, that
is, to beleeve in him, or to receyve him: which are all one in effect.
The ſecond bleſſing which is the making of vs like to the
image of the Sōne of God, is performed in the other two points:

that is in our iuſtification and glorification. For the Image of
God, conſiſteth in righteouſnes and holines of truth: which begunne
in this life, is the beginning of our glorie, wherein wee
ſhall be perfited in the life to come.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE ſecond ground followeth, which conſiſteth in the beholding
of Gods ſaving grace, in the ſeveral obiects wherin
it is to be conſidered, which are three.
               The firſt is God himſelfe, in whom our life is hid, Colloſſ.
chap. 3. verſ. 3. Who is the Father of lightes, from whom every
good giving and perfect gift commeth downe to vs. lames cha.
1. verſ. 17. For our grouth in bleſſednes, is nothing els but A filling
of vs with a greater fulnes of God. Eph. chap. 3. verſ. 19. Vntill at laſt he be
all in all. 1. Corinth. chap. 15, verſ. 28.
               The ſecond obiect is Chriſt, God and Man, as Mediator betwixt
God and vs: in whom it pleaſed the Father that all fulnes should
dwell. Coll. chap. 1. verſ 19. and out of whoſe fulnes we all receive grace.
Iohn chap. 1. verſ. 16. therefore he is ſaid to fill all in all things. Eph.
chap. 1. verſ. 23. and to be the first borne amongſt many Bretheren. Romanes
chap. 8. verſ. 29. and to have the preeminence in all things. Coll.
chap, 1. verſ. 18. and to be the firſt fruites, 1 Corinth. chap. 15. ver. 23.
               The third obiect is our ſelves, who out of Chriſts fulnes have
received grace. For even in vs it may be ſeene what is the riches
of the glory of the inheritance of God: and what is the exceeding
greatnes of his power. Eph. chap. 1. verſ. 18. and 19.
               Thus our life and ſalvation, is firſt in God himſelfe, as in the
firſt fountaine, and in him it is ours, by the eternall purpoſe and
Decree of his good will and pleaſure.
               Secondly it is in Chriſt, as the Mediator betwixt God and vs:
to whom belongeth the birthright and all the bleſſings thereof:
and that not only in conſideration of his divine nature: in reſpect
whereof he alone is only Sonne and heyre of all things:
but alſo in conſideration of his humane nature, in the which by
perſonall vnion thereof, with his divine nature, hee is become

the Sonne of God and our Brother, and is made head both of
Men and Angells.
               Thirdly, life and ſalvation is in vs, who are in Chriſt: through
whom, as the appointed meane, we receive from God all ſaving
graces. for nothing cōmeth to vs from God immediatly, but mediatly,
through Chriſt: in whom only all the promiſes of God are yea
and amen. 2 Cor. cha. 1. ver. 20. And therefore the Decree of God is
firſt accompliſhed in him as our head and Prince of our ſalvation:
who muſt bring the reſt of his Fathers children vnto glory,
Heb. ch. 2. ver. 10. as being the firſt fruites of them that ſleepe, 1 Cor. cha.
15. ver. 20. and our forerunner vnto heaven, Hebr. chap. 6. verſ 20.
               Of this it is evident, that nothing of all Gods Decree is accō
                  pliſhed
in vs, vntil firſt it be accōpliſhed in Chriſt. And in whatſoever
order God performeth al things in him, in that ſame order
doth he alſo performe thē in vs: ſo that whatſoever bleſſing is firſt
accompliſhed by God in Chriſt the man, muſt needes be the firſt
in order, both in Gods Decree and diſpenſation towards vs.
               Now albeit in all theſe three obiects our happines bee to bee
conſidered: yet in none of them can we ſo cleerlie perceive it, as
in Chriſt: who is the only Image of the inviſible God. Colloſſ.
chap. 1. verſ. 14. in whom onely God is manifeſted. For all that
ever we are to ſee of God, either in this life, or in the life to come,
we are to ſee it only in Chriſt. for which cauſe the Miniſters of
the Goſpell, are ſaid to give the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God in the face of Ieſus Chriſt, 2 Cor. ch. 4. ver. 6. And as
God himſelfe, ſo alſo his grace is only to be ſeene in the Lord Ieſus.
Therfore ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Tim. c. 1. v. 9. 10. that the grace of
God which was given vs in Chriſt, before the world was, is now
made manifeſt by the appearing of our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt.
               And as touching our ſelves, whatſoever grace or glory commeth
vnto vs, by the ſight of the glory of God in the face of Ieſus
Chriſt: it is in vs but in part, which in him is fully. And many
things yet reſt vnaccompliſhed in vs, which are accompliſhed in
him. having in vs no other ſubſiſting, but that which faith giveth
them. Wherefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the glory wherewith
God hath crowned man, which yet we cannot ſee in our ſelves:
ſendeth vs to Ieſus, as to the cleereſt light, whereby to perceive

the accompliſhment of that which is written, touching man in
the 8. Pſalm. Hebr. ch. 2. verſ. 6. and for this cauſe ſaith Auguſtin,
that Chriſt himſelfe is the cleereſt light of predeſtination and
grace. Whoſe humane nature did by no preceeding merit either
of faith or workes, purchaſe that it ſhould be received in vnitie
of perſon by the Sonne of God: ſo that that Man, ſhould bee the
only Sonne of God: for Chriſt the Man as he is Man, is made the
Sonne of God of meere grace, who according to his divine nature
was from everlaſting the only begotten Sonne of God.
               Seeing therfore that in Chriſt, the cleereſt ſight of predeſti. and
grace is to be had: if we would know in what order God doth adopt
&amp; iuſtifie vs, we muſt firſt cōſider in what order God maketh
Chriſt adoption &amp; righteouſnes vnto vs. For if he make him our
brother in order, before he make him our redēption of righteouſnes:
thē ſurly our adoptiō in order muſt go before our iuſtificatiō.
               Concerning Chriſt, it is cleere in the Scripturs that it is ſo, whether
we reſpect Gods election before all time, or his performing
therof in time: for the one, that is the dignity of Chriſt, as man to
be the Son of God: is performed in the incarnatiō; the other wherby
he is made our righteouſnes: is therafter accompliſhed in his
ſuffring. For when the word was made fleſh, that fleſh in ſubſiſting
and perſonalitie, was made the Son of God: never having
frō the firſt moment of cōception, any ſubſiſting a part of it own,
but only that of the ſecond perſon of the Trinitie. beeing not ſo
much as cōceived by the H. Ghoſt in the wombe of Marie, but in
vnitie of perſon, with the eternal Son of God. Therfore iuſtly do
the Fathers call this benefit, gratiam Vnionis, that is, the grace of Vnion.
Thus in the very firſt action of Diſpenſation, toward the
Son of Marie, the grace of ſiliation ſhineth cleerely, before all other
grace. After which in order followeth the action of God,
making him our righteouſnes: when as he made him, now being
his Sonne in our nature, ſinne for vs, which he could not haue
bene made for vs, vntill firſt he was our brother. Like as we can
have no right to his redemption, except we firſt be his brethren.
For brotherhood is the foundation of redemption: in ſo farr
that according to the Lawe and Ordinance of God, Chriſt
can not offer vp him ſelfe a ranſome for any vnto God, but

ſuch as are his bretheren. Neither can any have part or portion
in his oblation, whoſe brother he is not. For hee that ſanctifieth and
they that are ſanctified are all of one, wherefore he is not ashamed to call them
Brethren. Hebr. chap. 2. verſ. 11.
               This ground is made manifeſt by the lawe of God: whereby
it is ordayned, that the firſt borne of every man and beaſt, that
is the male that firſt openeth the wombe: and the firſt ripe of all
fruites, ſhall be offered and conſecrate to the Lord: that in the
conſecration thereof, all the reſt comming of the ſame Wombe,
or being of the ſame Maſſe or Kinde, might likewiſe bee conſecrated
to God. For as ſayeth the Apoſtle, Rom. chap. 11. verſ. 16.
If the first fruites be holy, ſo is the whole lumpe. And this is that which
the Apoſtle will ſignifie, when hee ſayeth that Chriſt is the beginning
&amp; firſt be gotten of the dead, that in all things he might
have the preeminence, Coll. chap. 1. verſ. 18. Revel. chap. 1. ver.
5. As alſo when he ſayeth that Chriſt was made the firſt fruites
of them that ſleepe. 1 Corinth. chap. 1. verſ. 20. this ſame thing
doth the Apoſtle declare in the 8. to the Romanes. When hee
ſheweth the reaſon why God hath predeſtinate vs to bee made
like to the Image of his Sonne, which is, that he might bee the
firſt borne amongſt many Brethren. For his prerogative in birth,
is made manifeſt by this, that in his conſecration we are conſecrated,
according as ſayeth the Apoſtle, Hebr. chap. 10. verſ. 14.
with one offring hath he conſecrated for ever, thoſe that are ſanctified.
               
               Thus the very lawe of God doth teach vs, that as the firſt
borne Male did conſecrate all the reſt of the ſame wombe, that
is brethren begotten of the ſame parents, and no other: and every
firſt ripe fruite of every mans ground and in heritance did
conſecrate to God the remanent fruite of the ſame ground and
inheritance and no other: eaven ſo Ieſus Chriſt is conſecrate for
none but for his brethren, and none are conſecrate by him, who
are not brethren with him. For it is not his oblation that maketh
brotherhood, but it is brotherhood that maketh his oblation.
Wherevpon it muſt follow, that ſeeing Chriſt muſt firſt be our
Brother, before he redeeme vs, that we alſo muſt firſt be adopted,
before we bee iuſtified.
               
                  
This ſame the Lord would ſeeme to declare by the lawe of
redemption which he eſtabliſhed in Iſrael: whereby all right of
redemption, is given to the neereſt kinſman.
               As alſo by the law touching the prerogative of the firſt borne:
whereby he is made Lord amongſt his brethren, but amongſt
none other. by which it appeareth cleerly, that brotherhood is
both the ground and limitation of Chriſts office, both as Redeemer
and Head of the Church; and this ſame brotherhood is the
ground of all right that we can pretend vnto the death or life of
Ieſus Chriſt ourhead.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE third ground ſerving to cleere the order of the bleſſings
of God: is the difference betwixt the order of Gods
diſpenſation and our perception or ſenſe of his benefites.
For that is not alwayes formoſt in order of diſpenſation, which
is firſt perceyved by our ſenſe: for in our conception of Gods benefites,
we aſcend from the later in order, to the former. Gathering
the knowledge and certeintie of the bleſſings going before,
by the ſenſe and feeling of thoſe which follow after.
               Hereof we have many examples in Scripture. For as Chriſt
teacheth vs, it is with every man that is borne of the Spirit, as it
is with him, who heareth the ſound of the wind blowing, but
cannot tell whence it commeth, nor whither it goeth. Iohn cha.
3. verſ. 8. Thereby informing vs, that the man begotten of God,
knoweth neither from whom the working of the Spirit is, nor
yet what is the end of it at the firſt, vntill afterward, that the
effects following manifeſt both the Author, the worke, and the
end thereof. According to which Iohn ſayeth, 1 Epiſt. chapter 1.
verſ. 6. By this we know we have fellowſhip with God, becauſe
we walke in the light: and againe, by keeping his commandements,
we know that we know him, and yet ſurely wee muſt
have fellowſhip with him, and knowe him, before wee either
walke in the light, or keepe his commandements. So alſo by
confeſſing that Ieſus is the Sonne of God, we know that God

abideth in vs &amp; we in him, as ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, Ephe. chap.
1. ver. 15. yet God muſt be in vs by his ſpirit, &amp; we in him, before
we can give any ſuch confeſſion: for no man can doe ſo much as
call Ieſus Lord, but ſpeaking by the ſpirit, 1. Corint. chap. 12. ver.
3. Likewiſe it is ſaid, that we know that God loveth vs, becauſe
we love him: and yet as ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, we love him becauſe
he loveth vs firſt, 1. Epiſtle, chap. 4. verſ. 19. For the former
bleſſings lying in our heartes vnperceyved, are made manifeſt
vnto vs by theſe effects following. For as Iohn ſayeth, Heereby
do we perceyve Gods love to vs, by giving his ſonne for vs, 1. Epiſtle
chap. 4. ver. 9. For the love of God towardes vs, which did
goe before as the cauſe, is not perceyved of vs, but by the giving
of his ſonne for vs, as the effect following. And to this end is it,
that Peter 2. Epiſt, chap. 1. ver. 10. willeth vs by our ſucceeding
holines, as the fruite of our righteouſnes, to make our calling
and our election ſure.
               Thus wee ſee, that the bleſſinges of GOD are not at the
firſt perceyved of vs, in the order wherein they are diſpenſed.
For there is a cōtrarie courſe of order, betwixt the Lords diſpenſing
of his grace to vs in Chriſt, and of our perceyving of the
graces imparted vnto vs. for we aſcend vpward vnto God the
fountayne of all bleſſing, backe agayne by the ſame ſteps, by the
which he did deſcend firſt vnto vs. The ladder of God, reaching
from heaven vnto earth, doeth bring GOD downe to vs, from
the vpmoſt ſteppe to the loweſt: but it leadeth vs vpwarde to
God, from the loweſt to the vpmoſt. Therefore God doeth not
beginne in diſpenſation to vsward, where wee beginne according
to our apprehenſion, to rayſe our myndes vpwards, in the
collection of the benefites diſpenſed. But if we will rightlie
know how God hath made that ladder: we muſt beginne at the
vpmoſt, neareſt vnto God, &amp; ſteppe downe to the loweſt, where
firſt wee began to ſteppe vp vnto God. ſo ſhall we know the
right order of Gods diſpenſation towards vs.
               It may be probablie thought, that the negligent conſideration
of this point, maketh many to miſtake the right place of adoption.
For although we doe not thoroughly perceyve, neyther

have the cleere knowledge of our adoption, vntill the time that
we have remiſſion of ſinnes, and feele the peace of God, and
ioye of his Spirit in our heartes, and that confidence and boldneſſe
whereby we may crye Abba Father: yet it followeth not,
that theſe goe in order before our adoption.
               But even as our Iuſtification is thoroughly perceyved and
confirmed in vs, by our ſucceeding ſanctification (for hee that
doeth righteouſnes in righteous, Iohn firſt Epiſtle, chapter the
thirde, verſe 7.) eaven ſo our Adoption, is cleered and confirmed
vnto vs by our ſucceeding Iuſtification and fruites thereof.
For our Adoption hath the accompliſhment of it, partly in everie
one of the remanent bleſſings of God, and wholy, in the
ioynt and full accompliſhment of them all. Therefore are wee
ſaide ſtill in this life, to waite for our Adoption, Rom. chapt. 8.
verſ. 23. becauſe our Adoption is not fully finiſhed, vntill our
full redemption be performed. But more cleerely of this in the
next ground: which ſerveth to cleere both this third ground, and
the mayne point which we have in hande.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE fourth ground ſtandeth in the marking how every
benefite goeth above each other amongſt them ſelves, in
largenes of extent. for that benefite, which is comprehended
vnder another, muſt needes in order follow that which doth
comprehend it: and that which doth cōprehend all the reſt, muſt
needs in order go before them all. For things which are vniverſal
and general, go before things which are ſpeciall &amp; particular.
               Now amongſt the benefits of God, we finde in ſcripture, that redemptiō
is of very large extent: ſo that it doth cōprehend vnder
it, both our iuſtification &amp; glorification, for it is defined oftētymes
by both. Touching iuſtification it is cleere, when as redemptiō, is
defined ſo oft by remiſſiō of ſinnes: and we are ſaid to be iuſtified
freely through the redemption that is in Chriſt Ieſus, Ephe. cha.
1. ve. 7. and Rom. 3. 24. And as concerning glorification, Chriſt
expreſly calleth it our redemption, Luke chap. 21. ver. 28.
               
                  
As touching the reſt of the benefites, wee ſhall have occaſion
to ſpeake of them hereafter, and we will now only ſpeake of Adoption:
comparing it with Redemption: to try which is of
largeſt extent: for if it bee larger then Redemption: I thinke in
the iudgement of all men, it ſhall bee without contradiction
eſteemed, the firſt bleſſing of all: but eſpecially it ſhall be found
in order to go before Iuſtification: ſeeing that our righteouſnes,
is comprehended in our Redemption.
               For cleering this point, if we marke narrowly the Scriptures
of God, we ſhall ſee, that as our Redemption comprehendeth
vnder it, our Iuſtification, Sanctification and Glorification: ſo
our adoption comprehendeth vnder it our whole Redemption,
and all the parts thereof. which is manifeſt by three ſpeciall
reaſons.
               The firſt is, becauſe Adoption is extended by the Spirit of
God, to the laſt bleſſing, wherein ſtandeth the accompliſhment
of our Redemption, that is the redemption of our bodies: from
the which, as from a part, Adoption is deſcribed, Rom. chap. 8.
verſ. 23. and that becauſe our Adoption, is not fully accompliſhed,
but in the full accompliſhment of our Redemption. Therefore
ſayeth Iohn, 1 Epiſt. chap. 3. verſ. 2. That now we are the Sonnes
of God: but yet it hath not appeared what we ſhall be. Thereby declaring,
that eaven to our ſelves, the cleere and full ſight of our Adoption,
is not, nor ſhall not be given: vntill the day of the ſecond
appearing, of the Lord Ieſus: when all things Decreed ſhall be
finiſhed. Therefore that day, is called by the Spirit of God, the
day of the Revelation of the Sonnes of God, Rom. cha. 8. ver. 19.
Out of which place, it may evidently bee gathered, that our
whole Redemption and every part thereof, and eſpecially the
laſt part, is nothing els but a manifeſtation of our Sonne-ſhip or
Adoption. And therfore it muſt follow, that Iuſtification, which
is a part of Redemption, muſt ſerve to this ſame vſe in part, like
as the whole parts of Redemption fully accompliſhed,Iunius in amica colla. 
                        ••
                     m Armin. ſerve for
it in whole. And this is the cauſe, why by a moſt learned Divine,
Iuſtification and all ſubſequent benefits, are called Via Adoptionis,
that is the way whereby Adoption is performed.
               
                  
The ſecond reaſon is taken from that ground, which was
layed downe in the XI. chapter, by which it was cleared, that
Chriſt can redeeme none, but ſuch as are his brethren. For by
his conſecration, he was to bring none but childrē vnto glorie,
Hebr. chap. 2. ver. 17. and therefore it muſt follow, that Adoption
in order muſt goe before Iuſtification: ſeeing whatſoever
Chriſt doeth in the fleſh, he doth it wholy for his brethrens ſake.
ſo that our whole Redemption is the fruite of our Adoption, and
an infallible conſequence thereof.
               The third reaſon, is taken from the definition of Gods Decree
or Predeſtination: which vnder the benefit of Adoption alone,
comprehendeth all the bleſſings of God, and whatſoever GOD
of his eternall purpoſe hath ordayned vnto vs, for our full felicitie
in Chriſt. for by it alone, without mentioning any of the
reſt of the benefites in Chriſt, predeſtination is defined, Ephe.
chap. 1. verſ. 5. to ſhew vs, that it contayneth all vnder it, and is
of the largeſt extent of all: as being before all, in all, &amp; through
all the reſt. For then is an adopted ſonne, fully a ſonne, when
he enioyeth the full inheritance. and we know that to be adopted,
includeth and implyeth the enioying of the inheritance alwayes:
and therefore the Adoption of God muſt needes have
included vnder it our righteouſnes: ſeeing that righteouſnes is a
part of the inheritance, which is by faith, Heb. chap. 11. verſ. 7.
               It is true that Adoption is taken in two diverſe ſenſes, not
onely by Divines, but alſo by the Scriptures themſelves. But in
what ſenſe ſoever it bee taken, yet in reſpect of order, it is ever
firſt. For if we take it in that ſenſe, whereby the nature of Adoption
is thought moſt properly to be expreſſed, when it ſignifieth
a ſeverall bleſſing, diſtinguiſhed from all the reſt: then it is nothing
different, either from our eternall election in Chriſt, before
all time, or then our effectuall calling in time. Which is the
firſt action of God his gracious diſpenſation, preceeding our iuſtification:
as witneſſeth the Apoſtle, Rom. chap. 8. verſ. 30. and
it conſiſts in the bringing of vs vnto Chriſt, by the Father, and
ingrafting of vs by faith in him, as the Sonne of God: and by that
vnitie with him, making vs Sonnes: that we may bee likewiſe

heyres. But if we take Adoption in that more large ſenſe: wherein
it is taken in that foreſaid definition of Predeſtination; Wherby
it comprehendeth all the remanent bleſſings, from the firſt
to the laſt: then it partlie differeth from the reſt, and partly is
nothing els but the reſt. For in ſo farr as it concerneth our calling
or choſing in time, it is different from iuſtification and the
reſt, and goeth before them all: and the reſt muſt neceſſarily follow
it, as inſeparable adherents thereof. For whom hee calleht them
he iustifieth: and whom he iustifieth, them he glorifieth. Rom. chap. 8. verſ.
30. But as it concerneth the reſt of the benefites, it is nothing
different from them. Therefore it is deſcribed by them, as parts:
becauſe they are the full accompliſhment of it. In which ſenſe
as wee have ſaid before, they are called by ſome, the way of Adoption.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIIII.
               THE laſt ground for cleering this point, is the due conſideration
of the Covenant of God with Man. In the which,
two things are eſpecially to be marked.
               The firſt is, Thoſe to whom the Lord maketh his promiſe.
               The ſecond is, The promiſe it ſelf, which God maketh to them.
               Touching the firſt, the promiſe is not indefinitely made to all
men, but to Abraham and to his ſeed alone. For God hath ſaid,
he will be his God, and the God of his ſeed after him. Therefore
no man that is not of this ſeed, doth obtayne any part of the
promiſe: becauſe it is a benefite belonging to none, except to
the ſeed onely. Of which it is manifeſt that we muſt bee Abrahams
ſeed, before we have right to the promiſe.
               Now what is meant by the ſeed, the Apoſtle telleth vs, Gal.
chap. 3. verſ. 16. ſaying: he ſayeth not to the ſeeds as ſpeaking of many, but
vnto thy ſeede as of one, which is Chriſt. That is Chriſt myſtically
conſidered with his members: who all ſpirituallie ingraft in
him, make the body, whereof hee is the heade: as is manifeſt
by the Apoſtles ſpeech, 1 Corinth. chapter 12. verſ. 12. Nowe
we are made the ſeed, by our Adoption. For to be the ſeed of Abraham,
is to be the children of God, as is cleere by the Apoſtle,

Rom. chap. 9. where he ſaieth: Neither are they all children, becauſe
they are the children of Abraham, but in Iſaack shall thy ſeed bee called, that
is, they that are the children of the flesh, are not the children of God, but the
children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed. This ſame the Apoſtle
confirmeth Gallat. chapter 3. verſe 29. ſaying, And if yee be Chriſts,
then are yee Abrahams ſeed and heyres by promiſe. Of theſe things it followeth,
firſt, that to be of the ſeed and to be the children of God
and to be Chriſts, is all one thing.
               Secondly, that wee muſt be the children of God, that is of the
ſeed, before wee can enioy the promiſe. And ſo conſequently,
that we muſt be Adopted before we be iuſtified: ſeeing iuſtification
is a part of the promiſe, made vnto the ſeede: as is cleere by
the words of the Covenant. Ierem. chap. 31. and Hebr. chap. 8.
I will be mercifull to their vnrighteouſneſſe, and I will remember their ſinnes
and iniquities no more.
               
               This ground is yet more cleere, by the Apoſtles ſpeech, Rom.
chap. 9. where he anſwereth the doubt which might riſe, vpon
the reiection of the Iewes. videli. Whether GOD had fayled
in performing of his promiſe? ſeeing they were the ſeed of Abraham
which were reiected. The Apoſtle anſweres this, and
cleeres the conſtant truth and veritie of God, in performing his
promiſe vnto the ſeed, according to his Covenant: by defining
the ſeed aright: ſhewing that they are not accounted for the ſeed, becauſe
they are the children of Abraham, according to the flesh, but becauſe they
are children of the promiſe. In which diſcourſe, the Apoſtle layeth
thoſe as neceſſary and infallible grounds.
               Firſt, that we muſt be of the ſeed before wee claime the promiſe.
               Secondly, that beeing of the ſeed, wee muſt be partakers of the
promiſe. For otherwiſe God ſhould faile in his truth, and his
word ſhould be of none effect.
               Of which things we may perceyve, that the grace of God in
which ſtandeth our Adoption, by which wee are made of the
ſeed, muſt goe before all the graces contained in the promiſe,
which is made vnto the ſeed, ſeeing the beeing of the ſeed is the
ground and foundation of enioying the promiſe.
               
                  
This leades vs to the knowledge of another point, which
ſerves to cleare our iudgement touching this ſame ground. To
wit, in what order to place the fruites and effects of our faith.
Which, as we ſhall heare hereafter, is the effectuall inſtrument
of God, by the which all bleſſings are communicate vnto vs.
For in this life wee enioy no ſaving bleſſing but by faith onely:
for by it we embrace our Adoption, and are made the Sonnes of
God. As witneſſeth the Apoſtle, Galath. chap. 3. verſ. 26. ſaying:
ye are all the Sonnes of God by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and by faith we apprehend
our righteouſnes &amp; are iuſtified, Rom. c. 3. v. 28. Gal. c. 3.
v. 8. And ſo of all the reſt of the bleſſings. Thus both the parts of
the Covenant, are wrought &amp; effectuate in vs by God, through
faith. for by it wee are both made the ſeed, and doe obtaine the
promiſe: but as being the ſeed, muſt goe before the enioying of
the promiſe: even ſo that fruite of faith in Chriſt, whereby wee
are made the Sonnes of God, muſt in order of diſpenſation, goe
before that fruite of faith, whereby we are made that, which is
promiſed vnto the ſeed: and ſo conſequently by faith wee muſt
firſt be made Sonnes before we be made iuſt.
               Thus much touching theſe five grounds, which ſerves for
cleering the order of the bleſſing of God, diſpenſed vnto vs in
Chriſt. Which was the third of theſe foure points, which we laid
downe, as neceſſarie to leade vs to the knowledge of the right
nature of the ſaving benefites of God: and ſo perticularlie of Iuſtification.
So that it followeth, that wee ſhould enter to ſpeake
of the laſt of the foure, touching the difference of one benefite
from another: but firſt it ſhall not be amiſſe, to ſpeake ſomewhat
of that other opinion, which houldeth Iuſtification to bee in order
before Adoption: and to conſider the groundes wherevpon
it is buylded.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               THE grounds of any moment, which I have marked, whervpon
this opinion is buylded, are two. The firſt is: It is
thought an impoſſible thing, that God ſhould adopt vs before

he iuſtifie vs. Becauſe God cannot eſteem thoſe that are vniuſt,
to be his Sonns. And this is the cauſe apparantly, that makes
ſo many to put reconſiliation in the firſt place, and to divide it in
iuſtification, as the firſt part thereof, and Adoption as the laſt.
               
                  The other ground is taken out of the Scripture, eſpecially out
of that ſaying, which is in the 1. of Ioh. ver. 12. Where it is ſaid,
as many as receiued him, to them he gave prerogative to be the ſonnes of God,
even to them that beleeve in his name, which are borne, not of blood, nor of the
will of flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
               As concerning the firſt ground, although it ſeeme to have
great ſhew of trueth: yet it is moſt dangerous, if it be not rightly
conceived. For it may import ſo much as that the love of God
and his grace, is not free, and freelie beſtowed vpon vs: if ſo bee
it ſhould be builded vpon our Iuſtification: Which is contrarie
to the courſe of Gods trueth in Scriptures. Which ſheweth plainly
that God loved vs, even while yet wee were ſinners and vniuſt:
yea while wee were enemies, Romanes chapter 5. and
that when wee were polluted in our owne blood, hee did pittie
vs, and of his love did promiſe life vnto vs, and waſhed vs
with water, and purged away our blood from vs, and anoynted
vs with oyle, and decked vs with ornaments. Ezek. chap. 16.
Whereby it is evident, that our Iuſtification is not the cauſe why
God acknowledgeth vs to be his children: but by the contrarie,
his taking of vs to be his children, is rather the cauſe why hee
doth waſh away our filthines from vs, &amp; iuſtifieth vs. For ſeeing
the Lord loveth vs, before he iuſtifieth vs: there muſt bee ſome
ground of this love, before our Iuſtification: ſeeing he loveth vs
not, then as iuſt men: becauſe we are yet ſinners: and God doth
iuſtifie the vngodly. And no other ground can preceede in diſpenſation,
except our calling: which is nothing els in effect, but
our Adoption: or at leaſt, the firſt part and beginning of it. Which
is the firſt fruite of his love toward vs: by the which wee are
made of the ſeed, and ſo heyres of the promiſe of righteouſnes,
conforme to the reaſon of the Apoſtle Peter, Acts chap. 2. verſ.
39. Where he ſheweth that the promiſe belongeth to all that the
Lord our God ſhall call. Which calling, is nothing els but the

applying to vs in time of our eternall election in Chriſt before
all time: which election is nothing els but our Adoption. This
point is cleere if we conſider, who they are, whoſe filthines God
promiſeth to waſh away, Eſay. chap. 4. and to whom he promiſeth
to open the fountayne for ſinne and vncleanes, Zach. chap.
13. that is, to the Doughters of Ieruſalem, and to the houſe of
David, and inhabitants of Ieruſalem. Which in effect is as much
as to ſay: Thoſe who are the children of God, who are citizens
with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God. And this is that
which we ſaid before, that we muſt firſt be of the ſeed, before we
enioy any part or portion of the promiſe: and ſo conſequently
righteouſnes. For the love of God to his Sonne, as his Sonne,
being the only foūdation of Gods love vnto vs: it muſt follow
that the firſt ground of Gods love to vs in Chriſt, muſt be buylded
vpon our communion with him, in that which is the foundation
of all Gods love to vs: that is the Sonne-ſhip. For it is for
this cauſe, that it is ſaide in ſcripture, that Chriſt is the ſonne of
Gods love, and his beloved: and that God is ſaid to make vs acceptable
or beloved to him ſelfe, in that his beloved Sonne.
               Secondly, we ſhall perceyve the trueth heereof more cleerly,
if we conſider the grounds in Chriſt, wherevpon dependeth our
Adoption and iuſtification in him.
               Touching our Adoption, it muſt of neceſſitie be grounded,
neither vpon the Divine nature of Chriſt, nor ſimply vpon his
humane nature, neither vpon his Obedience and ſuffering in
that humane nature, now aſſumed: but onely vpon his perſonalitie
and ſubſiſting, whereby he is the Sonne of God. For
which cauſe our nature, which hee aſſumed, was taken by him,
in vnitie of ſubſiſting or perſon with his Divine nature. In that
perſonall vnitie of our nature aſſumed, with the ſonne of God,
laying the foundation of our Adoption, to bee the ſonnes of
GOD.
               As touching our Iuſtification, it is buylded vpon his obedience,
in giving him ſelfe to the death of the croſſe for vs: as it is
cleare throughout all the ſcriptures.
               Theſe groundes being conſidered, we have next to marke

in which of theſe two, is our communion by faith with Chriſt,
firſt in order accompliſhed: that is whether firſt by faith, we are
made partakers of his ſonne-ſhip, in being made one with him
as the ſonne of God: or whether firſt we be made partakers of his
obedience and death.
               In anſwering of this queſtion, I thinke there ſhall no man
be founde, who ſhall not agree, that we muſt by faith have fellowſhip
and communion with him ſelfe, as he is the Sonne of
God: before we can have communion and fellowſhip of his
ſufferings. For how can his death be our death, vntill firſt he
and we be one: ſeeing all vnitie and communion of his ſufferinges,
floweth from our communion and vnitie with himſelfe.
               Wherevpon it may eaſilie appeare, that if that ſaying of
thoſe learned and holy men bee not rightly vnderſtoode, it
may make many to caſt from them ſelves, the verie foundation
and grounde, wherevpon the aſſured confidence and knowledge
of their Iuſtification in Chriſt dependeth. For no man
can ever have hope, to have part in his death, that firſte doeth
not finde, that he hath parte in him ſelfe: for firſt we muſt bee
fleſhe of his fleſh, and bone of his bones, and he of ours, before
any thing that ever he hath done in the fleſh, be made ours.
Of which it followeth, that we muſt firſt be ſonnes, before we
be iuſtified.
               For as in earthly Mariage, Man and Woman are made one
fleſh, by coniunction of their bodies in one: and therevpon followeth
communion of all other things: even ſo in our ſpiritual
Mariage with Chriſt, we have no communion with him in any
thing that is his, vntill the time that firſt hee be ours and we be
his: ſo as he and we be but one. And this agreeth with the ſaying
of the Apoſtle, Gallath. chapter 3. verſ. 29. where hee ſayeth,
And if yee bee Chriſts, then are yee Abrahams ſeed and heyers, according
to the promiſe. Where the Apoſtle ſheweth, that our beeing
Chriſts, maketh vs the ſeed, that is, the childeren of God. And
that our beeing the ſeede, maketh vs heyres of the promiſe:
And ſo conſequently, of the righteouſnes, that is by faith.
               
                  
This ſame is evident by the Apoſtles ſpeech, Ephez. chapter 5.
Where hee exhorteth men to love their Wives, as Chriſt loved
his Church. Which love is declared in theſe effects, that hee did
give himſelfe for her, to this end that he might ſanctifie her, purifying
her by the waſhing of water, that he might make her to
himſelfe glorious, not having ſpot or wrincle, &amp;c. By which
place it is manifeſt, that the death of Chriſt and fruites thereof,
are the effects of his love, to thoſe that are nowe alreadie his
ſpouſe, and ioyned with him in that ſpiritual Vnitie, which is by
faith. And this we muſt acknowledge, except we will conſent
to that vile opinion, which overthroweth the foundation of all
religion: which is, that even in the intention and purpoſe of
God; Chriſt dyed equally and indifferently for every man alike.
That is, that he did give himſelfe to death, as well for thoſe that
periſh, as for the elect of God. Whereas this place of the Apoſtle,
ſheweth the direct contrarie: that he gave himſelfe only for his
Church. Which is cleere by the Apoſtles argument, wherevpon
he vrgeth the like love in husbands towards their wives, as was
in Chriſt towards his Church. For the analogie of love, is builded
vpon the analogie of Vnion. The force whereof is this: if
Chriſt ſo loved his Church, becauſe thoſe of his Church, are
members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones, ſo likewiſe
ought men to love their wives: becauſe they are one fleſh and
one body with their husbands. For as the Apoſtle requireth of
husbands towards their wives, more then that common love,
which they owe to all women: and that becauſe they are one
fleſh with their wives: but not with any other women: even
ſo he vrgeth it, from a like example in Chriſt: who beſide and
above that common love, which he carrieth to all fleſh: did in
greater meaſure declare his love to thoſe that were members of
his body, fleſh of his fleſh, and bones of his bones: in that he did
give himſelfe to death for them: to this end, that hee might
iuſtifie them. For as the bonde of Mariage, doth oblige the husband
to a particular and ſpeciall love to his wife, wherein he is
obliged to none other: even ſo the Lord Ieſus, did ſubmitt himſelfe
vnto the Fathers will, to lay downe his life for none, but

ſuch as were given him of the Father, and made members of his
body, and his ſpirituall ſpouſe.
               And if any will obiect, that this place of the Apoſtle is to be
vnderſtood of the order of Chriſt his doing, according to the eternall
purpoſe and Decree of God: and not according to the
Diſpenſation of God towards vs in tyme. It is eaſie to be anſwered:
that the order of God in both is one and the ſame. For as
the Lord doth particularly predeſtinate men, to Adoption, before
he give his Sonne to the death for their iuſtification; even
ſo in tyme, he doth Adopt vs, that is effectuallie call vs, &amp; bring
vs to his Sonne, and make vs one with him, before he iuſtifie
vs.
               Moreover, this ſhall yet be more manifeſt, if we ſhall marke
this one diſtinction of the fruites of faith. to wit, if we can diſcerne
betwixt the immediate fruite of faith, and the mediate
fruites. The mediate fruite we call that, which is wrought by
God in vs, even by the very working of faith in our heartes, together
and at once: and that is, our verie vnion and coniunction
with Chriſt. For by faith Chriſt dwelleth in our heartes: and
this is the worke whereby we are made the ſonnes of God. For
as ſayeth the Apoſtle: If we be Chriſtes, we are the ſeed, Gal. chapt. 3.
verſ. 29.
               The mediate fruites of faith I call thoſe, which by vertue of
this vnion, as the neceſſarie forerunning meane, faith produceth
in vs: ſuch as is our iuſtification, ſanctification, &amp;c. ſo that in
a manner, we can diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe benefites and our
faith: but more hardly betwixt our faith and Adoption: ſeeing
our abyding in Chriſt, and Chriſtes abyding in vs, is all one
thing with our beleeving in Chriſt.
               That ſaying therefore, of theſe learned Divines, that GOD
cannot acknowledge vs his ſonnes, before he iuſtifie vs: is not
ſimplie and abſolutelie to be vnderſtood: but by compariſon &amp;
relation: that is, becauſe God powreth in our heartes, after our
iuſtification, a more lively ſenſe of his love, and a cleerer ſight
of our Adoption, then we receyved in our calling. And this maner
of ſpeach the ſpirit of God vſeth familiarly in the ſcriptures:

which is comparatively to be vnderſtood. as Iohn chap. 7. verſ.
39. For the holy Ghoſt was not yet, becauſe Chriſt was not yet glorified: Which
is not to be vnderſtood, as though the holy Ghoſt had not bene
at all, but only that he was not in that meaſure that he was therafter
to be given. Likewiſe in that of Iohn ch. 16. Chriſt ſayeth,
touching his Diſciples: hetherto have ye asked nothing in my name:
which were great prophanes in vs, to vnderſtand ſimply of thoſe
holy men of God: who knew Chriſt to be the Chriſt, &amp; Sonne of
the living God: and who were directed in their prayers by the
ſpirit of God, who inditeth none, but in the name of Chriſt: albeit
more darkely and obſcurely manifeſted in our hartes, then
after the comming of the holy Ghoſt in greater meaſure.
               Even ſo it may bee iuſtly ſaide of our Adoption: that God
doeth not acknowledge vs his ſonnes before hee iuſtifieth vs:
becauſe that, which in ſmall meaſure and darkely was manifeſted
to vs, in our calling, is more fully and clearely revealed
in our Iuſtification. becauſe then the ſpirit of Adoption is
more aboundantly ſhed abroad in our heartes, for the ſealing
of our Adoption. For as we haue ſaide before, although our Adoption
be begunne in our Calling, before our Iuſtification:
yet hath it the clearer manifeſtation, and fuller accompliſhment,
in, and through all the reſt of the benefites following
our Calling. For as ſayth Iohn in his firſt Epiſtle, chapter
3. verſe. 2. VVe are now the ſonnes of GOD, but yet it is not made manifest,
what wee ſhall be. Therefore are we, who are already called,
Iuſtified and Sanctified, ſtill ſaide to wayte yet for our Adoption,
Rom. chapter 8. verſe 23.
               Not as though we were not already Adopted, but becauſe
our Adoption, is not fully accompliſhed, vntill our bodies bee
redeemed and fully glorified. So that with as good reaſon, wee
may ſaye, that God doth not acknowledge vs to be his ſonnes,
whyleſt our bodyes are yet vile and corruptible: ſeeing we muſt
Waite for our Adoption, vntill our bodyes be redeemed▪
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               THE ſecond ground wherevpon this opinion is builded, is,
the teſtimonie of Iohn. Which not the leſſe in my iudgemēt,

makes not much for it, if it be wel wayed. For it would appeare,
that that place is miſtaken by many: &amp; that eſpecially in three
things.
               The firſt is, in miſtaking the right ſenſe of that deſcription,
wherein the propertie of theſe, to whom Chriſt gives this benefite,
is ſet downe.
               The ſecond is, the miſtaking of the benefit it ſelf givē by Chriſt.
               The third is, the ground of both the former two: in not diſtinguiſhing
betwixt the Fathers part and the Sonnes, in that
worke of our Adoption.
               Touching the firſt. the deſcription of thoſe perſons, is ſet
downe three maner of wayes. I. Thoſe that receyved him. II.
Thoſe that did beleeve in his Name. III. Thoſe that are borne
of God.
               Of theſe three, the firſt two, are interpreted to ſignifie Iuſtification.
of which ſenſe, that place well marked, doth give no warrant,
ſeeing in ſcripture theſe phraſes, may as wel be interpreted
of Adoptiō, as of Iuſtificatiō. For as by faith in Chriſt, we are iuſtified,
ſo by faith in Chriſt, we are the ſonnes of God, Gal. 3. 26.
and therefore to reſtrayne beleeving in Chriſtes name, &amp; receyving
of him, vnto the benefit of iuſtificatiō, is an overſight which
eaſily may breed miſtaking of the true ſenſe, not onely of this
place, but divers other places of ſcripture. ſo they take it for granted,
which in it ſelf is queſtionable. Moreover, the place it ſelfe,
and the very words of this deſcription doe yeelde two ſufficient
arguments, to prove, that heere adoption by theſe phraſes, is rather
deſigned, then iuſtification. The firſt argument lieth in the
firſt wordes of the deſcription: which is, Thoſe that receyved
him. Which phraſe, is in the ſcripture ſtill meant of the worke of
the Fathers Calling of vs vnto the Sonne, and not of his iuſtifying
of vs in him. For no man (ſayeth Chriſt) can come vnto mee, except
the Father that hath ſent me, drawe him, Iohn chap. 6. ver. 34. Now
to come vnto Chriſt, &amp; to receive Chriſt, are both one. as is manifeſt
by Ioh. cha. 5. where that, wherwith in the 40. verſe Chriſt
chargeth the Iewes, vnder theſe words: (but you will not come vnto
me) is in the 43. verſe, interpreted by Chriſt him ſelfe, in theſe

wordes: And you receyved me not. For there is a great difference betwixt
theſe workes of the Father: to witt the bringing of vs to
the Sonne, or giving of vs vnto him, or making vs to receyve
him, which are all one, and the ſame thing: and the Fathers iuſtifying
of vs in the ſonne, whom now we have receyved. The
firſt is the proper worke of God calling vs▪ The other is the
worke of God, after our calling. Which evidētly appeares by the
ſpeech of Chriſt him ſelfe, Math. cha. 11. ver. 28. where firſt, he invites
vs to come vnto him, and then promiſeth to ſuch as doe
come, that he will give them reſt vnto their ſoules: for God iuſtifieth
none, who have not firſt receyved the ſonne. For who cā
be made the righteouſnes of God in Chriſt, who is not firſt ingrafted
in him. Now the firſt worke of faith, ſtandeth in our receyving
Chriſt, and making him to dwell in our heartes: in, and
through whom now receyved and poſſeſt by faith, the Lord
doth thereafter iuſtifie and glorifie vs. ſo to make a Man to be
iuſt, before he be a ſonne, is as much as to make an accident or
qualitie to be before or without a ſubiect: or to make a Man
wiſe, before he be a Man. and this ground the Apoſtle cleers by
his owne ſpeech, when he coūted all but dongue, that he might
gaine Chriſt, and be found in him: to this end, that he might not
haue his owne righteouſnes, but the righteouſnes which is by
the faith of Chriſt, Phil chap. 3. thereby playnelie he ſheweth vs,
that we muſt firſt gayne Chriſt and be found in him by faith, before
we can haue the righteouſnes that is by the faith of Chriſt.
ſo that to receyve Chriſt, and to be iuſtified in Chriſt, are in no
ſorte to be confounded: although they cannot be ſeparated.
For this is the principall cauſe, why Iuſtification and all remanent
bleſſings are attributed vnto faith: becauſe by faith onely,
we are made one with Chriſt, and ioyned vnto him, who onely
is the ſubſtance of all our bleſſings: as being made of God vnto vs
wiſedome righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption, 1. Corint. ahap. 1.
verſ. 30 Vpon which vnion with Chriſt, followeth our cōmunion
with him, both in death and life. For being once in him,
we can not but be pertakers of all bleſſings in him. And of this
worke of the Father, it is that the Evangeliſt ſpeaketh in this

place. which is the firſt worke of his gracious diſpenſatiō: when
as he maketh vs to beleeve in his onely ſonne. as is manifeſt by
the Evangeliſtes owne words, interpreting the firſt phraſe, that
is, Thoſe that receyved him: by theſe wordes, that is, Thoſe that beleeue
in his Name.
               
               The ſecond argument lieth in the third phraſe of this deſcription,
which is, Thoſe that are borne of God. By which wordes, both
the two former phraſes, that is thoſe that receyved him, &amp; thoſe
that beleeved in his Name, are, interpreted. thereby teaching
vs, that this worke is not the worke of Iuſtification, but of Adoption,
and of our receiving of Chriſt himſelfe by faith: that in
vnitie with him, we may be the Sonnes of God: and not our receiving
of his obedience by faith, vnto righteouſnes. For by
beeing borne of God, we are made the Sonnes of God. Which
birth, eſpecially is performed by the Father: when by his Spirit,
he brings vs vnto the Sōne, &amp; makes vs to receive him by faith
in our hearts: ſo making vs one with him. By which Vnitie alone,
it is, that we are made the Sonnes of God. For as the Vnitie
of Chriſts humane nature in ſubſiſting and perſonalitie, with
his divine nature, maketh that Ieſus Chriſt the Man, is the Sonne
of God: ſo our ſpirituall Vnitie by faith, with Ieſus Chriſt the
Sonne of God, makes vs alſo, to be the Sonnes of God.
               Thus it is plaine by the third phraſe, that the former two are
not rightly taken, when they are expounded of thoſe that are
iuſtified.
               If any man would expound this birth, not of our effectuall Adoption
it ſelfe, but of the preparation of vs therevnto, (as ſome
moſt learned and reverent Divines doe.) Yet never can it make
the former opinion true: for our beeing borne of God, in the
Scripturs can never be ſhowen, to be meant of our Iuſtification.
And if they take it for our Regeneration or Sanctification to the
obedience of God, then it will follow, that wrongly they make
Adoption to be a part of Reconciliation: If ſanctification which
is no part of Reconciliation, muſt goe before. For they them ſelues
acknowledge that Reconciliation hath but two parts: Iuſtification
and Adoption.
               
                  
Beſides: this diſtinction of Adoption, wil hardlie be warranted
by the 9. of the Romanes except men will make the Apoſtle
playnely to contradict himſelfe: who reſtrayneth the Adoptiō,
which he aſcribes to the Iewes, onely to the ſeed of Abrahā
according to the promiſe, and not according to the fleſh. Becauſe
otherwiſe, the trueth of God in his promiſe would have
failed. Which conſideration likewiſe appeareth evidently to deſtroy
that diſtinction of Adoption (albeit firſt deviſed by one of
the auncient Fathers) whereby one Adoption is made Adoption,
but by figure and reſemblance: the other in ſubſtance and
effect.
               But it ſeemeth that the ground of this opinion, (in ſome,
though not in all,) is buylded vpon this, that they eſteeme our
Righteouſnes to conſiſt in the very act of beleeving: which may
be more iuſtly ſaid of our Adoption, albeit in a circumſpect meaning.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               TOVCHING the benefite it ſelfe, which Chriſt beſtowes
vpon thoſe that receyve him: although we ſhould grant it
to be the ſame in ſenſe which they expound it to be: yet it
will never inferre, that in this place, To receyve Chriſt and beleeve
in his name, is to be vnderſtood of Iuſtification: but (according
as ſome of themſelves ſay) of the worke of God in making
vs to beleeve. Of the which followeth, the dignitie and prerogative
of being ſonnes: as the firſt and immediate fruite of faith,
in Ieſus Chriſt. In which ſenſe we denie not, but this place may
be commodiouſly interpreted: although it ſeemeth that the ſpirite
of God doth meane ſomewhat more. For vnderſtanding
whereof, we are firſt to conſider the third point, which we have
ſaid to be the ground of the miſtaking of this place: which ſtands
in the not diſtinguiſhing, betwixt the Fathers worke and the
Sonnes, in our Adoption: although in the ſame place, they bee
cleerely diſtinguiſhed by the Evangeliſt. Which overſight maketh
great confuſion in knowledge.
               
                  
For we are to vnderſtand, that although the three perſons of
the Trinitie, be neither in ſubſiſting nor working to bee ſeparated:
yet in both, they are ſtill to be diſtinguiſhed: and never to be
confounded: if ever we thinke to have a cleere and vnconfuſed
ſight, of theſe great workes of grace, which they performe in vs.
               Now in this place, the worke of the Father, and the worke of
the Sōne in our Adoption, are cleerely and diſtinctly ſet down.
Like as in other parts, the worke of the ſpirit, in the ſame Adoption,
is diſtinguiſhed from both: The worke of the Father, is our
Vnion with Chriſt: when he brings vs vnto him, and makes vs
to receive him, by beleeving in his name. And this is our comming
to the Sonne: Which is the proper worke of the Father.
For none can come vnto the Sonne, except the Father drawe him. And this
is the principall act of our Adoption: which moſt properly is to
be called Adoption: and as we have ſaid, conſiſteth chiefly in
our calling. For ſeeing moſt properly, it is the worke of the Father
to adopt: certayne it is, that our Adoption, moſt properly
muſt conſiſt in the action of the Father. For which cauſe, the Fathers
worke, in making vs to receyve the Sonne, that is to beleeve
in his name, is in this place expounded, by way of ſimilitude,
in a borrowed ſpeech, that is, to be borne of God. For the
begetting and working of faith in our hearts, is the chiefe and
principall part of our ſpirituall birth: beeing the roote &amp; ground
of all that followeth.
               The worke of the Sonne is next ſubioyned: which ſtands in
giving to thoſe who have receyved him, prerogative, or as ſome
do render the word, dignitie, as others authoritie, and as others
power to bee the Sonnes of God. Of all which ſignifications of
the word, there is none which doth not fitt this place: without
giving any advantage vnto the Papiſts, in their forged ſenſe of
the word power. Which benefite proceeding from the Sonne, is
alwayes to bee diſtinguiſhed in our Adoption, from our Vnion
and communion with him by faith: which is the worke of the
Father: vpon which, as the cauſe, dependeth the other as the effect:
for to thoſe, whom the Father doth give to the Sonne, to be
his brethren, and in vnitie with him, to be the Sonnes of God:

the ſonne doth give the prerogative, the dignitie, the authoritie
and the power belonging to the ſonnes of God. And this work
conſiſteth in the ſonnes bringing vs to the Father. For none can
come to the Father, but by the Sonne: for Chriſt ſuffred for vs,
that he might bring vs to God, 1. Pet. chap. 3. verſ. 18. And this
is that, which is ſo often ſpoken of in ſcriptures by Chriſt himſelfe:
that to thoſe whom the Father giveth him, to thoſe he giveth
eternall life: and that he giveth the glorie that the Father
hath given him, vnto thoſe that beleeve in him. For whatſoever
prerogative, dignitie, &amp;c. the Father hath given vnto the
Sonne, the ſame doth the Sonne impart to vs that are his brethren.
For the prerogatives and priviledges of ſonne-ſhip, appertayne
onely to Ieſus Chriſt, as the onely ſonne of God. and
therefore it belongeth to him alone, to communicate thoſe prerogatives,
to ſuch as the Father doth firſt by Adoption make his
brethren. For the prerogative of a ſonne, is a dignitie depēding,
not vpon the eſſence and nature of our Redeemer, but vpon his
ſubſiſting and perſonalitie. For as the prerogative of a father, is
proper to the firſt perſon: ſo the prerogative of a ſonne, is proper
to the ſecond perſon. and therefore, as we doe holde that to
adopt, is the prerogative of the firſt perſon, becauſe he onely is
the Father: ſo to communicate the prerogatives belonging to
thoſe who are adopted to bee children, is the prerogative of the
ſecond perſon, becauſe he only is the Sonne. And therefore is it
ſaid, if the Sonne make vs free, wee shall bee free indeed, Iohn chap. 8.
ver. 36. for freedome, is the prerogative of a Sonne, and not of a
ſervant. And therefore the whole libertie and freedom, bee it
from ignorance, Sathan, ſinne or death, which the ſaints enioy
in Chriſt, is called by the Apoſtle, the libertie of the Sonnes of
God. in which libertie is comprehended, both our wiſdome,
righteouſnes, ſanctification and redemption. Which prerogatives,
when we doe enioy them, then may we bouldly eſteeme
our ſelves the Sonnes of God. And this is that, which it ſeemes
the ſpirit of God doeth meane, when he ſayeth, that Chriſt doth
give vs the prerogative to be the Sonnes of God: that is, that he
beſtowes vpon vs ſuch priviledges and bleſſings, or ſuch authoritie

and power, over all our ſpirituall enemies, as may make
vs, not only to glorie in God the Father of Chriſt, as our God
and our Father: but alſo to carrie our ſelves in our whole converſation,
as becommeth the ſonnes of God. For we do eſteeme,
that to be adopted or made ſonnes, and to receyve prerogative
to be ſonnes, are two diſtinct benefites, of the two firſt perſons
of the Trinitie. For a man may bee a Sonne, and yet wante the
prerogative, dignitie, authoritie, and power of a Sonne. For as
ſaith the Apoſtle, Gallath. chap. 4. verſ. 1. 2. The heyre while hee is a
childe differeth nothing from a ſeruant, though he be Lord of all, but is vnder
Tutors and Governours. vntill the time appointed of the Father. Which cuſtome
of men, the Apoſtle applyeth to the Church of God. to
let vs know, that it is a thing to be conſidered in the children of
God, aſwell as in the children of men: ſo the overſight ſtandes
in the not diſtinguiſhing betwixt the being of a ſonne ſimply,
which comes by procreation and birth: and the being of a ſonne
in prerogative, dignitie, authoritie and power of a ſonne, which
comes by age and fulnes of time, appointed by the Father.
               For every child is a ſonne to his Father, as ſoone as he is borne:
yet longe after he receyveth not the prerogative of a ſonne: but
ſtill is in condition as a ſervant.
               But when the time appointed, for his freedome commeth: he,
who was before a ſonne by birth, but a ſervant in condition, becōmeth
to be a ſonne likewiſe by condition, aſwell as by birth:
when as the prerogative, or dignitie, or authoritie, or power, to
be a ſonne in eſtate, is given vnto him. And in this ſenſe is this
place to be vnderſtood, if it be rightly taken: that is, that vnto
them who were borne of the Father, and ſo which were ſonnes
by the Fathers begetting of them: Chriſt the ſonne did give prerogative,
or dignitie, or authoritie, or power, to be ſonnes in cō
                  dition
and ſtate. For as we have ſaid before, the benefit of being
ſonnes ſimply, by begetting, or birth, or by adoption, is the proper
worke of the Father: but to make vs ſonnes in the condition
and eſtate, belonging vnto ſonnes, is the proper worke of the
Sonne. For we have no boldnes to call the Father our Father,
nor have wee any acceſſe vnto him as vnto our Father, but

through Chriſt alone. Neither have we the libertie of the ſonnes
of God, from ſinne, either by righteouſnes or ſanctification: nor
any part of the glory of the ſonnes of God, but frō Chriſt alone:
in whom doth all fulnes dwell, and out of whoſe fulnes, we all
receyve: and by whom only we come vnto the Father. And this
diſtinction of theſe two works, of the Father, and of the Sonne,
ſhineth cleerly in the wordes of the Evangeliſt: when he ſayeth,
that Chriſt did give prerogative to bee the ſonnes of God, only
to thoſe who were borne of God: plainelie diſtinguiſhinge the
Fathers worke, in begetting vs to be his ſonnes, from the worke
of the ſonne in giving vs the prerogative to bee ſonnes. which
verifieth that to be a ſonne by birth, and to be a ſonne by prerogative,
are not to be taken in one ſenſe, nor for one benefite: but
for two diſtinct actions, of the firſt two perſons of the Trinitie.
Which the ſame Apoſtle Iohn ſeemeth playnly to confirme,
1. Epiſt. chap. 3. verſ. 1. 2. When he aſcribeth the benefite, of being
called the ſonnes of God, vnto the love of the Father, and the
benefite of the beeing that which the ſonnes of God are, in prerogative
and dignitie, vnto the Sonne: by whoſe appearing vnto
vs, wee are made that, which the ſonnes of God ſhould bee.
And therefore, in this life, according as hee hath appeared vnto
vs, by the Fathers worke in our calling, bringing vs vnto him,
illuminating our vnderſtandinge with the knowledge of him,
and by faith making vs one withhim: ſo have wee receyved the
prerogative to be the ſonnes of God, in righteouſnes and holines,
with freedome and boldneſſe to call his Father our Father:
but becauſe as yet he is not manifeſted vnto vs in all the prerogatives
of the ſonnes of God, therefore (although wee bee now,
both ſonnes by Adoption, and likewiſe in ſome meaſure by prerogative
and dignitie,) yet it is not fully manifeſted what wee
ſhall be: but when he ſhall appeare in glory, then ſhall wee appeare
like him, in all things. In which likenes either in parte, or
in whole, accompliſhed in vs, ſtandeth the prerogative of the
ſonnes of God. For cleering of which point, wee are to obſerve
that ſaying of the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. chap, 1. verſ. 30. For of him you are
in Chriſt Jeſus, who is made of God vnto vs, wiſedome, righteouſnes, ſanctification

and redemption. In theſe wordes two diſtinct actions, are attributed
vnto the Father, which muſt needes preceed in order, that
action of the Sonne, whereby he gives vs prerogative to be the
ſonnes of God.
               The firſt action of the Father is the making of Chriſt vnto vs,
wiſedome, righteouſnes, ſanctification and redemption: which
are indeed the prerogatives of the ſonnes of God.
               The ſecond action of the Father is, the making vs to bee in
Chriſt: to the end that we may bee pertakers of theſe bleſſings,
which Chriſt is made of the Father, vnto vs. Which action of
making vs to be in Chriſt, cannot be diſtinguiſhed from making
of vs ſonnes and Adopting of vs.
               Vpon which two workes of the Father, followeth the action
of the Sonne: who when we are by the Father, in him, hee maketh
vs pertakers of all his own prerogatives, dignities &amp; glory.
               And after this worke of the Sonne, followeth the action of
the holy Ghoſt: ſealing vp in our hearts, both our Adoption or
ſon-ſhip, and the prerogatives belonging to the ſonnes of God.
               Of this diſtinct conſideration, of the diſtinct working, of the
Father, Sonne and the Holy Ghoſt, it may eaſilie appeare, that
the worke of the Sonne, is miſtaken in this place, when it is interpreted
to be Adoption, or making of vs ſonnes ſimplie: wheras
it is to bee vnderſtood, of a benefite, ſucceeding our beeing
ſonnes by Adoption, which is already accompliſhed, when we
are begotten and borne of God the Father: after which, it is the
Sonnes parte, to make vs in condition and eſtate the ſonnes of
God: by communicating with vs, the prerogative, and dignitie,
and authoritie which is proper to the ſonnes of God.
               Thus fare have we thought good to ſpeake touching the order
of the benefits of God: in which point we have more largely inſiſted,
becauſe it is the ſpeciall ground, wherevpon ryſeth, not
only the overſight of good men, but alſo divers hereſies of wicked
men, in this age. And we have further labored to cleere that
place of Iohn, which moſt miſleades men in this matter: that
thereby it may be manifeſt, that by the Scriptures rightly vnderſtood,
Adoption goeth in order before Iuſtification.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               HAVING finiſhed the three firſt grounds, ſerving to cleere
the nature and order of the ſaving benefites of God: Now
it reſts that wee ſpeake of the laſt: which is touching the
ſpeciall diſtinction and difference of thoſe benefites amongſt
themſelves. In which point, leaving all other opinions, we wil
follow that which hath the greateſt warrand and cleereſt evidence,
in the truth of God: which only in all ſuch thinges, wee
are to follow, as our guide and informer.
               But before we beginne this point, there are three things needfull
to be conſidered of vs.
               The firſt is, the diverſe manners wherein the ſpirit ſpeaketh
of them in the Scriptures.
               The ſecond is, what things they have common, in which they
all agree and have no difference.
               The third is, the vſe that we are to make for our inſtruction of
the preceeding point.
               In theſe three things wee will be ſhorter perhaps, then their
nature requyreth, ſetting them downe in ſhort propoſitions.
               Touching the firſt, we are to marke that in the Scripture thoſe
benefites are ſet downe, two manner of wayes: that is, either
confuſedly, or then diſtinctlie.
               The confuſed manner of ſpeech, is likewiſe two fold.
               Firſt, when as in reſpect of the inſeparable coniunction of
theſe bleſſings, and preſence infallible of all the reſt, where one
is, beeing all lincked together, and every one imperting and
impleying, all the reſt: the Scripture putteth one for all.
               The ſecond manner is, when ſome one benefite, is putt for
another: and theſe two ſortes of ſpeeches are playne by theſe
places. Rom. chap. 8. verſ. 23. 2 Cor. chap. 5. verſ. 19. Eph. chap. 1.
verſ. 7. Col. chap. 1. verſ. 14. Rom. chap. 5, verſ. 9. 10. 11. &amp;c.
               The diſtinct manner of ſpeech is, when theſe benefites are
both in name and ſignification ſpecially diſtinguiſhed, one from
another: as namely, Rom. chap. 8. verſ. 30. 1 Cor. chap. 1. verſ. 30.
               
                  
This we thought good, firſt to marke, becauſe there is great
probabilitie, that in not conſideration of the ſpirites different
manner of ſpeaking, is the ſpeciall ground and cauſe, of many
mens miſtaking of the ſpeciall difference and true order, of theſe
ſaving benefites of God. As ſpeciallie, when Iuſtification and
Adoption are made partes of reconſiliation: which beeing properly
taken doeth in order, according to the Scriptures, ſucceed
to them both. As alſo when one benefite is defined, by the propertie
of another: which error many doe fall in. Wee are therefore
to take heed, that wee put a ſpeciall difference betwixt one
and the ſame benefite, according as it is vſed by the ſpirit of
God, in proper or improper manner of ſpeech: when either it is
put in the owne proper ſignification, or when it is put particularly,
for another benefite then it ſelfe, or generally for all.
               Touching the ſecond point, there be ſix ſpecial things, wherein
all the ſaving benefites of God agree.
               The firſt is in their originall, or efficient cauſe: which is God
alone: for he is the Father of lights, from whom commeth down
all good gifts and every perfect donation, Iam. chap. 1. verſ. 17.
This may be confirmed by particular teſtimonies of Scripture,
touching every particular benefite, as of Faith, Adoption, Iuſtification,
Peace or Reconciliation, Sanctification, Glorification,
and our whole Redemption. For they are neither bred in vs by
nature, nor acquired by our induſtrie, nor miniſtred by humane
education, but are all the gifts of God.
               The ſecond thing wherein they all agree, is the cauſe which
moueth God to give them: which is nothing but his grace and
good pleaſure. For none of them is obtayned by our deſert, or
meritt. For as, ſayeth the Apoſtle, 2 Tim. chap. 1. verſ. 9. God hath
ſaved vs and called vs with an holy calling not according to our workes, but
according to his owne purpoſe and grace. and this likewiſe is cleere by
particular teſtimonies of the Scriptures, touching every one of
theſe benefites.
               The third thing wherin they all agree, is the meanes, through
which God of his grace doth give them: which is Ieſus Chriſt
the Sonne: who is made of God vnto vs all theſe bleſſings: For

in him all fulnes dwelleth, and out of his fulnes, we all receive
grace. Which point alſo is moſt evident, throughout all the
Scriptures in everie particular benefite.
               The fourth thing wherein they all agree, is the inſtrument by
the which God maketh vs to apprehend them all in Chriſt,
which is Faith only.
               The fift thing wherein they all agree, is that they are inſeparable
one from another: ſo that none can have one of them, but
he muſt needs have all: for whom he calleth, them he Iuſtifieth,
and whom he Iuſtifieth them he glorifieth. Rom. chap. 8. verſ. 30
And as ſayeth the Apoſtle: by the grace of God which is given vs
in Chriſt Ieſus, we are made riche in him, in all gifts: 1 Cor. cha.
1. ver. 4. 5. And the ſame Apoſtle gives thankes to God, becauſe
he hath bleſſed vs with all bleſſings in Chriſt, Eph. ch. 1. ver. 3.
               The laſt thing wherein they all agree, is that they are never
taken away againe, from thoſe that receive them: For the gifts and
calling of God are without repentance: Rom. ch. 11. ver. 29. And whom
Chriſt loved, hee loveth to the end. Iohn chap. 13. verſ. 1.
               Now followeth the third thing to be conſidered of vs, which
is, touching the vſe ariſing vpon thoſe former 6. points, which
wee are to marke, for our right vnderſtanding of the nature of
Gods ſaving benefites: and this vſe is ſixe fould.
               The firſt is, that none of theſe bleſſings is in vs by nature, nor
from nature, nor any power or facultie in nature, but are all the
ſupernaturall gifts of God.
               The ſecond vſe is, that we are to acknowledge the good will
of God and his free grace, to bee the only cauſe moving God to
give theſe benefites. For by his grace he hath made vs freely accepted
in his beloved: ſo that even what in Chriſt hee gives vs,
he gives it freely of grace: ſo that all reſpects is removed, why
God ſhould beſtowe his bleſſings in Chriſt, except his owne
grace in himſelfe. Which we are carefully to marke, that we may
keepe our ſelves from the error of theſe, who confound either
the ſubordinate meane, through which, or the ſubordinate Inſtrument,
by which God beſtowes his bleſſings, with the cauſe
moving God to beſtow them: For although Chriſt be the meane

through which, &amp; faith be the inſtrument by which, God gives
all ſpirituall bleſſings, yet the cauſe moving him to give all, is
his grace. For hee gives Chriſt, and the righteouſnes that is in
him, and faith, freely, to whom he will, and withouldes them
from whom he will.
               Thus although the ſubordinate meanes, in and by which, God
diſpenſeth his bleſſings, are not to be ſeparate from his grace, yet
they are never to bee confounded with it: but even Chriſt himſelfe,
and all bleſſings in him, and the merit of his ſufferings, and
faith, by the which wee apprehend all, are ſtill to bee diſtinguiſhed
from the grace of God, which is the only cauſe, why eyther
Chriſt himſelfe, or the meritt of his ſuffrings, or faith to apprehend
it, is given vs of God. Therefore in Gods working, the
Scriptures ſtill ioyne theſe three together, to wit grace, Chriſt
and faith. Faith, as the inſtrument whereby we apprehend, and
Chriſt as the ſubiect in which wee apprehend the bleſſings of
God, and the grace of God, as the only cauſe moving God, both
to giue faith, and Chriſt by faith, and in Chriſt al theſe bleſſings.
So that it is a greevous ſinne againſt the grace of God (for the
prayſe of the glory whereof, the Lord doth beſtowe vpon vs all
ſpirituall bleſſings) when we ſpoyle it of this prayſe due to it alone:
by making any other thing to bee the moving cauſe why
God doth bleſſe vs. As likewiſe it is a great ſinne, when ſeparating
this grace, from the ſubordinate meanes, wee doe deſpiſe
the meanes, and turne the grace into wantonnes.
               The third vſe is, that no where, except in Chriſt alone, is
any of the ſaving bleſſings of God to bee found. And therefore it
never can be accompted to be Gods Adoption, Gods Righteouſnes,
Sanctificatian, Reconciliation or Redemption, which is
placed in any thing without Chriſt. Wherevpon it muſt follow
that they erre farre from the trueth, who place their righteouſnes,
either in their faith, or workes: or who place reconciliation,
in their owne ſatisfaction.
               For though Chriſt be the obiect of faith, yet it hath the being of
it, in mans hart: &amp; concerning works and our own ſatisfactions.

It is cleere that they are not in Chriſt: who notwithſtanding is
all in all things, and filleth all in all things.
               The fourth vſe is, that without faith, God by his grace, communicates
noe bleſſing in Chriſt, in ordinarie diſpenſation.
Therefore they muſt erre, who thinke that Chriſt and the bleſſings
of God in him, may be apprehended, by the externall bodily
action of man, in receyving the Sacraments: that is, as they
call it, by the very externall worke wrought. This likewiſe
teacheth vs, to perceive their error, who doe make Faith, which
is but the apprehending inſtrument, to bee the bleſſing it ſelfe,
thereby apprehended in Chriſt. Of which ſort they all are, who
place the matter of our righteouſnes, in the act of our beleeving.
               The fift vſe is, to teach vs to be wiſe, in iudging of our ſelves,
whether we be truly in the ſtate of grace or no: for he that is deſtitute
of any one of theſe ſaving bleſſings, he is deſtitute of them
all: whatſoever fooliſh confidence he have to the contrarie. For
as ſayeth the Apoſtle Peter, 2. Epi. chap. 1. verſ. 3. God through the
knowledge of him that hath called vs, hath given vnto vs al things, that appertayne
to life and Godlines: And therfore Iames ſheweth that it profits
nothing that a man ſay, he hath faith, if he have no workes. And
Iohn 1. Ep. cha. 2. verſ. 9. ſayeth, Hee that ſayeth he is in the light, and
hatetb his brother, is in darknes vntill this tyme. and chap. 3. verſ. 6. VVho
ſoever ſinneth, hath not ſeene Chriſt, neither hath knowen him.
               
               
                  The ſixt and laſt vſe is, to diſcover to vs the error of thoſe who
prophainly affirme, that the Saints effectually called, may fall
from grace: which is a blaſphemous denying of Gods faithfulnes,
his righteouſnes, and the ſtablenes of his counſell: vpon
which the Scriptures, ſo often build, the certayntie of the ſaints
perſevering vnto the end: Vpon his faithfulnes, 1. Cor. chap. 1.
ver 8. 9. who alſo shall confirme you vnto the end, for God is faithfull, by whō
ye are called. And 1. Theſſ. chap. 5. ver. 24. Faithfull is hee who calleth
you and will alſo doe it. vpon his righteouſnes. 2. Theſſ. chap. 1. verſ.
6. 7. For it is a righteous thing with God, to render to you which are troubled,
rest with vs in the revelation of the Lord Ieſus from heaven. And Heb. ch.
6. ver. 9. 10. But we perſwade our ſelves better things of you, and ſuch as accompanie
ſalvation, for God is not vnrighteous, &amp;c. and vpō the ſtablenes

of his counſell in the 17. and 18. verſes of the ſame chapter, ſaying:
Wherein God willing more aboundantly to shewe vnto the heires of promiſe
the vnchaingeablenes of his counſell, did binde himſelfe by an oth, that by
two immutable things, wherein it is impoſsible that God should lye, we might
have ſtrong conſolation, which have our refuge to lay holde vpon the hope,
that is layde before vs.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THvs having ſpoken of theſe 3. points: it followeth now
that we ſpeake of the particular difference, whereby the
bleſſings of God, are every one diſtinguiſhed frō another.
               The difference that is amongſt theſe benefites, is of two ſorts.
               The firſt is more general, depending vpon the different manner
that we enioy them.
               The ſecond is more particular, riſing vpon the particular nature
of every benefite.
               Touching the firſt, the benefites of God in Chriſt, are either
ſuch, as are made ours only by imputation and Gods gracious
accompt: the thing imputed, remayning ſtill in ſubſtance inherent
in Chriſt, and not in vs. for then they are ſuch, as (flowing
from the vertue of Chriſt) doe abide inherent in our ſoules and
bodyes eternally.
               Of the firſt ſort, are Adoption and Iuſtification, which never
can be ſaid properly, to be inherent in vs (Adoption, beeing taken
in the proper ſenſe, whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from the reſt:
&amp; not in that general ſenſe mentioned before) for Chriſt alone,
remayneth in himſelfe, the only Sonne of God, and only righteous
without ſinne: wee beeing ſonnes and righteous, never
by any inheſion of theſe bleſſings in vs, but only by the imputation
of that ſonne-ſhip and righteouſnes which is Chriſts alone,
vnto vs. Therefore the Scriptures, (touching theſe 2. benefites)
doeth ſpecially vſe this phraſe: to witt, that wee are the ſonnes
of God in him, and that we are made the righteouſnes of God in
him.
               Of the ſecond ſort, are theſe benefits, which neceſſarily follow,

vpon the two former: as being the end wherefore we are Adopted
and Iuſtified. and theſe be peace with God, or Reconciliation,
ioy in the holy Ghoſt, Sanctification and Glorification,
which is all one with Redemption: as it is taken in moſt particular
ſenſe. Which all are ſo given vs in Chriſt, that by the ſenſe
and feeling of them inherent in vs, they are made to vs, ſure tokens
of our effectual calling or Adoption &amp; Iuſtificatiō. Which
being bleſſings, not perceyved by any ſenſe of them ſelves, in
ſubſtance inherent in vs, are confirmed in vs by the others, as
infallible effectes following them.
               For which cauſe the Apoſtle Peter willeth vs by them, to
make our calling and election ſure. For in this are the children
of God knowne, and the children of the Divell: VVho ſoever doeth
not righteouſnes, is not of God, 1. Iohn 3. 10. And againe, Know yee, that
he that doeth righteouſly, is borne of him, 1. Iohn 2. 29. And againe, Hee
that doeth righteouſnes, is righteous, as he is righteous, 3. chap. verſ. 7.
               This difference, ſerveth both to cleare the order and nature
of the benefites of God. For theſe, which are ours by gracious
accompt, remayning ſtill inherent in Chriſt only, they are both
firſt in order, and are the grounds and ſubordinate cauſes of all
the reſt of the benefits, inheſively beſtowed vpon vs in Chriſt.
Therefore vnto theſe two, that is Adoption and Iuſtification, all
the reſt, are attributed, as effectes and infallible conſequences,
whyle it is ſaide: If wee bee ſonnes, then are we alſo heyres, Rom. cha.
8. ver. 17. And againe, Whoſoever is borne of God, ſinneth not, 1. Iohn
3. 9. And againe, The ſonne abideth in the houſe for ever. Iohn 8. 35.
ſo touching righteouſnes it is ſaide, The iust by faith shall live, Rom.
1. 17. And againe: Being iuſtified by faith, we haue peace towards God, &amp;
reioyce in the hope of the glory of God, Rom. 5. 1. 2. And againe: That, we
being iuſtified by his grace, should be made heires, &amp;c. Tit. 3. 7.
               The ſecond difference, ariſeth vpon the different nature of
the benefites: which appeare in the effectes of every one towardes
vs. Which effectes may generally bee reduced to two.
               The firſt is, the effect, of the making vs the ſonnes of
God. Which is moſt properly performed in vs in the bleſſing of
Adoption.
               
                  
The ſecond is, the making of vs like to the Image of the ſonne
of God. Which is performed by the reſt of the bleſſinges: that is
our Iuſtification, Sanctification, and Redemption. Which albeit
they ſerve to accompliſh our Adoption, by making vs to bee
the ſonnes of God by prerogative, dignitie, &amp;c. yet wee are
ſonnes, before they be accompliſhed in vs. For as ſaith Iohn, 1.
Epiſt. 3. 2. We are nowe the ſonnes of God, although it is not
manifeſt what we ſhall be.
               So this generall difference, of the nature of Gods benefites, is
carefully to be marked: that we may diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe
benefites, by the which we are properly made ſonnes, and ſo of
the ſeed: which onely is Adoption. And theſe benefites, by the
which, we enioye the promiſe, made vnto the ſeede: where by
we are not properlie ſaide to be made ſonnes, but onely in reſpect
of the condition and eſtate, belonging to the ſonnes. But
properly by them we are made like vnto the Image of the ſonne
of God.
               But although all theſe benefites agree in this pointe, and
they all ſerve to make vs like vnto the Image of the Sonne: yet
they differ in nature, every one from another, according to the
difference of theſe thinges, wherein they make vs like vnto the
Sonne of GOD. For by Iuſtification, the Lord makes vs righteous,
and without ſinne: as Chriſt is righteous, and without
ſinne. and reconcileth vs vnto him ſelfe, making vs one with
him ſelfe, as the ſonne is one with him. For peace or reconciliation
with God, is the effect and fruite of Iuſtification, as is
cleere Rom. chap. 5. 1. In which we have to obſerve, that as
the Father, by Adoption, maketh vs one with the ſonne: ſo by
Iuſtification, hee maketh vs one, with him ſelfe. Conforme
to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, 2. Corinth. chapt. 5. verſ. 19. For
God was in Chriſt, reconciling the worlde vnto him ſelfe: by not imputing
to them their ſinnes: therefore is our peace and reconciliation with
GOD, attributed vnto the Croſſe of Chriſt, by the which ſayeth the Apoſtle,
hee killeth hatred, Ephe. 2. 16. and alſo our libertie and
boldnes, to enter into the moſt holy place, is attributed vnto the
bloud of IESVS, Heb. 10. 19.
               
                  
Secondly, by ſanctification, the Lord makes vs like to his Son
by puritie, and holines of nature.
               Thirdly by redemption, as it is particularly taken for glorification,
the Lord makes vs like vnto his Sonne, in immortalitie,
glory▪ and power. This order and difference, of theſe benifites, is
cleere, 1 Cor. chap. 1. verſ. 30. where wiſdome, is put in the firſt
place: which, ſpecially anſweres to our calling, wherein conſiſteth
our Adoption. In the ſecond place, righteouſnes. In the
third, ſanctification: and in the fourth place, redemption. Which
place, is ſpecially to be marked: for the right knowledge, both
of the order and difference that is amongſt is benefites of God.
For in other places of Scripture, Redemption, as likewiſe Iuſtification,
and Reconciliation, are taken in a larger ſenſe: to ſignifie
the whole freedome of the ſonnes of God, and every parte
thereof in particular. And that becauſe all libertie, peace and reconciliation,
whatſoever is given vs of God, floweth from the
death of Chriſt: in the which ſtandeth our righteouſnes, peace
&amp; redemption. For which cauſe it is, that in the Scriptures, ſometymes
our Iuſtification is aſcribed to the death of Chriſt: ſometymes
our Sanctification: ſometymes our Reconciliation: and
ſometimes our Redemption. Becauſe, howſoever theſe bleſſings,
(as they are imparted vnto vs) differ both in order and nature:
yet they proceed all, from one fountayne: and are all comprehended,
only in that one oblation, of Ieſus Chriſt vpon the Croſſe.
               For cleering our iudgements therefore, in this point: we are
carefully to marke theſe two ſenſes, in the which, in the Scriptures,
Redemption, Iuſtification, and Reconciliation, and Sanctification
are taken.
               Sometymes they are taken, for the action of God in Chriſt
for his ſaints: when as God, was in Chriſt, reconciling the
world to himſelfe: according to that which hee had purpoſed in
Chriſt. which was, as ſayeth the Apoſtle, Eph. chap. 1. verſ. 10.
That in the fulnes of tyme, he would gather together all things in Chriſt Ieſus,
&amp; as ſayth the ſame Apoſtle, Coll. chap. 1. ver. 20. It pleaſed the Father
to reconcile all things to himſelfe, by him: making peace by the blood of
his croſſe.
               
               
                  
In this ſenſe, God at one tyme, by the only one oblation of
Ieſus Chriſt, in one worke, once performed, did eternally redeeme,
Iuſtifie, Sanctifie and Reconcill to himſelfe, all his ellect,
that ever were, is, or ſhall bee, vntill the end of the world. For
Chriſt bare all their perſons, vpon the Croſſe: and God did
lay vpon him, the iniquitie of them all: and did wound him, for
their tranſgreſſions, and breake him for their iniquities: and did
lay vpon him, the chaſtiſment of their peace. Eſa. 53. Therefore
ſayeth the Apoſtle, Heb. 10. that by that will of God we are ſanctified
even by the offringe of the body of Ieſus Chriſt once. And in the 9.
chap. 12. verſe, hee ſayeth that Christ by his owne bloud entered once in the
moſt holy place, and abtayned eternall redemption: and in that ſame Chapter
ver. 28. it is ſayd, that Chriſt was once offered, to take away the ſinnes of many.
               
               Now in this ſenſe, there is neither, difference of tyme, nor
order, nor diſtinction to be made: all beeing accompliſhed together
and at once: by one worke, of one man, Ieſus Chriſt the
Lord.
               Sometymes againe, they are taken for the worke of God in vs,
and toward vs: in his owne tyme applying that, which hee
wrough in Chriſt for vs, to every one of vs in particular: bringing
vs, by effectual calling, to the knowledge &amp; apprehenſion
by faith, of our Redemption, Iuſtification, and Reconciliation,
which God accompliſhed onely in that day of Chriſt, which
all the Fathers deſired to ſee: howſoever in divers ages, and
divers tymes, they bee applyed, by God, to theſe, whō then,
and in that day, by the death of his Sonne, he did Redeeme, Iuſtifie,
and Reconcile vnto him ſelfe. And in this ſenſe, we ſpeake
of theſe benefites, in this treatiſe: not as they were wrought by
God, in Chriſt, for vs: but as in the diſpenſation of God, they
are applied vnto vs, for whom Chriſt dyed. In which ſenſe the
Apoſtle ſpeakes of them, 1. Coll. 1. 21. 22. ſaying: And you alſo
which were in tyme paſt ſtraungers and enemies, having your mindes exerciſed
in evill workes, hath he now reconciled in that body of his flesh, by death.
               
               And in this ſenſe, it is, that both order and difference, is to be
marked amongſt theſe benefites. In conſideration whereof, how
ſo ever Adoption, and Iuſtification agree, in this, that they both

are benefites beſtowed by imputation, without inheſion in vs:
yet, as they differ in nature, ſo doe they in order: in reſpect of
the grounds, wherevpon they are builded, &amp; whence they flow.
For Adoption, neither dependeth vpon, nor floweth from the
death of Chriſt: But from his perſonall propertie, of beeing the
ſonne of God. whereas Iuſtification, dependeth vpon, &amp; floweth
from his ſuffering. and therefore as our cōmunion with him
in perſon goeth before our cōmunion with him in his ſuffrings,
ſo doth our Adoption, in order goe before our Iuſtification.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               HITHERTO have we ſpoken, of thoſe groundes, whereby
both the nature and order of Gods ſaving benefites, are
moſt cleerly knowen. So that by theſe things, which are
alreadie ſet downe, a modeſt minde, onely ſearching truth, and
abhorring contention, may ſufficiently knowe, what Iuſtification
before God, is. yet notwithſtanding, for the further contentement
of thoſe of weaker iudgement, we will ſpeake ſomething
more particularly of the benefite is ſelfe.
               For the clearer vnderſtanding whereof, and diſcovering of
the trueth, which now almoſt lyeth hid, by the manifold opinions
of men: it were needfull, that we ſhould ſpeake of divers
things: as namely, of God him ſelfe, what place he hath in that
worke. 2. of his grace. 3. of Chriſt and his obedience. 4. of faith.
5. of man him ſelfe, and of his workes. and laſtly of the Lawe
and of the Goſpell. For all theſe points are called in cōtroverſie:
and mens iudgements is divers concerning every one of them,
in the worke of Iuſtification: but to eſchew longſomnes, wee
will reduce all, that we are to ſpeake, into theſe few grounds.
               The firſt, ſhalbe touching the ſpecial divers and ſeverall
iudgements of men, concerning Iuſtification.
               The ſecond, ſhalbe touching the diſcuſſing of theſe pointes
controverted, which are of greateſt moment.
               The third, ſhalbe concerning the worke it ſelfe of Iuſtification:
according as it is ſet downe in the truth of God.
               
                  
And intreating of theſe three, we ſhall touch by the way, everie
one of theſe points mentioned. in doing whereof, if we ſhall
inſiſt ſomewhat more largely, then ſhall ſeeme expedient to riper
iudgements, yet we hope that heerein we ſhall eaſily be pardoned:
ſeeing we take this paynes, not for the inſtruction of
thoſe, that are of greater iudgement then our ſelfe, but for the
helpe and cōfort of the ſimpleſt ſorte. Who in this mayne point
of ſalvation, may (through the diverſitie of opinions) be brought
in danger of deſtruction. For ſeeing there is no hope of life to anie,
but ſuch as are iuſtified by the righteouſnes of God which
is by the faith of Chriſt: it muſt followe, that this Iuſtice being
taken away, and any other whatſoever put in the place thereof,
all ground and certeyntie of ſalvation, muſt needes bee alſo
taken away.
               To come then to the firſt point. there be foure principall different
opinions: beſide the opinion of Oſiander: which beeing
odious to all, we need not to ſpeake of.
               The firſt is of thoſe, who devide the worke of Iuſtification betwixt
God and man: Chriſts merit and mans merit: faith and
works: grace &amp; debt: the Law &amp; the Goſpell: but in divers reſpects
and conſiderations. For in reſpect of that, which they call
the firſt righteouſnes (which they eſteeme nothing but a preparation
of a man, to iuſtifie himſelf, by a formall righteouſnes infounded
in vs by grace). they give place to God, as the author &amp;
worker: and to his grace, as the cauſe moving him: and vnto
Chriſts ſufferings, as the cauſe meriting that grace: &amp; vnto faith
as the benefit in founded into vs by grace: and vnto the Goſpell,
as the inſtrument whereby this benefit is wrought in vs. Yet
with God &amp; his grace, they ioyne man in this worke: aſcribing
vnto him, freedome of will, ſo that God by his grace &amp; man in
his will concurre in the worke. God by his grace, helping mans
will to beleeve. But in reſpect of that, which they call the ſecond
righteouſnes, wherein they place the merit of eternall life, they
ſeclude God from beeing the Iuſtifier: and aſcribe iuſtification
to man him ſelfe. they ſeclude grace and eſtabliſh workes of
free will, they ſeclude Chriſt, and the merit of his obedience,

and place them ſelves and the merit of their owne workes. they
ſeclude beleeving, and eſtabliſh working: and for the Goſpell,
place the Law.
               The ſecond opinion is of thoſe, who in iuſtification, make
God to be the Iuſtifier, and that of his grace, and that by faith,
but as our worke, of our free will: yet not of the Law, but of
the Goſpel. ſecluding Chriſt and his obedience wholy from our
righteouſnes: as likewiſe the Law and the workes thereof. So
they give to God the worke of Iuſtifying: but the matter of their
righteouſnes, they wholy aſcribe to their owne worke and act
in beleeving. and place grace in nothing, but in Gods gracious
accepting of mans imperfect faith, in place of the perfect righteouſnes
of the Law. and attribute vnto the merit of Chriſtes obedience,
this gracious acceptation of our faith: as though hee had
dyed and ſuffered not for our Iuſtification, but to merit and obtayne
at Gods hande, that our owne worke of beleeving, ſhould
bee graciouſly accepted as perfect righteouſnes, albeit in it ſelfe
imperfect. and where they may ſeeme to agree with the papiſt
in aſſcribing righteouſnes to their owne working, they thinke
that they doe ſufficientlie purge them ſelves from that blott by
this ſubtill evaſion: that they doe not attribute their righteouſnes,
to a worke of the Lawe, but to a worke of the Goſpell.
               The third opinion, is of thoſe; who attribute the worke of
Iuſtification vnto God, but place their righteouſnes, partlie in
their faith, as their owne worke, and partly in the obedience of
Chriſt. and make two actions of God, in Iuſtifying. In the one
whereof, they give place vnto grace: in the other not. The firſt
action is the imputation of our imperfect faith, for righteouſnes.
and that by grace. The ſecond action is the imputatiō of Chriſts
perfect obedience, for the ſupplying of that, which is wanting
in our imperfect faith, for righteouſnes, and that by Iuſtice.
               All theſe three opinions, doe attribute Mans righteouſnes,
either wholy or in parte to his owne working, The firſt and laſt
doe ioyne grace &amp; merit together in Iuſtification. Which things
are moſt contrarie to the truth of God: whether the workes bee
of nature or of grace: of the Law, or of the Goſpell.
               
                  
The fourth and laſt opinion, is of thoſe, who attribute the
worke of Iuſtification to God alone: and placeth our righteouſnes
onely in Chriſtes obedience: and doe acknowledge ſaith to
be nothing but the applying and apprehending inſtrument of
Chriſtes obedience: and the Goſpell, to bee the inſtrument of
faith: and all to be of grace. becauſe God, giveth Chriſt, to bee
righteouſnes vnto vs, by grace: and imputes his obedience vnto
vs, by grace: and by grace, giveth vs faith, and vnto faith the
Goſpell. ſo that they attribute the whole prayſe of the Iuſtification
vnto God: and place the whole matter of righteouſnes, in
the obedience of Chriſt: ſecluding all workes of men, eyther of
the Lawe or of the Goſpell: and acknowledge the grace of God
to be the onely cauſe, moving God to iuſtifie vs, by Chriſtes obedience:
as likewiſe of the giving of vs faith, to apprehend it,
and this opinion only agreeth with the trueth.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               NOw we come to theſe things, wherein eſpecially ſtands
the chiefeſt controverſies, whereby the trueth of Iuſtification
is moſt darkened. which we will reduce all, to
theſe foure points.
               The firſt ſhalbe, touching the efficient cauſe of Iuſtification.
               The ſecond ſhalbe, touching the materiall cauſe of it.
               The third ſhalbe, touching the formall cauſe.
               The fourth ſhalbe, touching the ſubiect, that is iuſtified.
               Vnder theſe foure are comprehended the chiefe controverſies
touching this matter. For touching the finall cauſe, there is no
great diſagreement: therefore we have no need to ſpeake much
of it: yet notwithſtanding becauſe it ſerves to cleare that which
we have ſo much inſiſted in before, touching the order of Adoption
and Iuſtification, we will ſpeake ſomething thereof, after
the other foure.
               Firſt then, touching the efficient cauſe of Iuſtification, the
controverſie is only with the Papiſtes: for in this point, albeit
they agree with vs in parte, or rather in ſhew: yet they diſagree

from vs, in the chiefeſt ſubſtance of this queſtion. For wee ſaye,
that God onely doeth Iuſtifie: but they, albeit they graunt the
firſt Iuſtification to God in parte, yet they aſſcribe the ſecond Iuſtification
(wherein they place the merit of eternall life) wholy
to man him ſelfe. Now for diſcuſſing this controverſie, wee
have three thinges that may ſufficientlie cleare our iudgement
therein.
               The firſt is, the manner and forme of the Scripture phraſe,
touching the Iuſtification of a man.
               The ſecond is, the teſtimonie of the Scripture, declaring who
it is, that Iuſtifies a man.
               The third is, the nature of the worke it ſelfe.
               Touching the firſt, the Scripture ſpeaking of Iuſtification,
even whereas it is ſuppoſed to bee by the workes of the Lawe,
ſpeakes paſſivelie of man, and never activelie: to ſhewe it is a
worke which he him ſelfe doeth not, but which is done vnto
him by another. as for example, Rom. chapt. 3. verſ. 20. by the
workes of the Lawe, shall no flesh bee iustified. And againe, Gal. chap.
2. ver. 16. Knowing that a man is not Iustified by the workes of the Law.
And againe, Gall. chap. 5. verſ. 4. And yee are abolished from Chriſt,
who ſoever are Iuſtified by the Lawe. As likewiſe, when Iuſtification
is attributed vnto faith, the ſame paſſive forme of ſpeach is vſed,
as Rom. chapt. 3. verſ. 28. VVe conclude then, that a man is Iuſtified by
faith, without the workes of the Lawe. And againe, Rom. chap. 5. ver.
1. Being then Iuſtified by faith, &amp;c. And Tit. chap. 3. ver. 7. That beeing
Iustified by his grace, &amp;c.
               
               Which forme of ſpeech is moſt cleerely vſed, Matt. chap. 12. v.
37. For by thy wordes, thou shalt bee iuſtified: and by thy wordes, thou shale
be condemned. All theſe teſtimonies doe ſhew plainlie, that the
worke of Iuſtification is not the worke of man him ſelfe, but of
ſome other: And therefore Chriſt, Luke chap, 16. 15. layes this
to the Phariſes charge, as a ſpeciall iniquitie, ſaying: Yee are thoſe
who iuſtifie your ſelves. And that this is to bee vnderſtood, not only
of a man in iudging him ſelfe, but alſo of one man in iudging an
other, it is plaine by the Apoſtles doctrine, Rom. 14. 4. 10. 13.

where he takes al power from all men of iudging one another,
and to conclude this point, the Apoſtles teſtimonie touching
him ſelfe, is ſufficient, 1. Corint. cha. 4. ver. 3. whereby he cleereth
both theſe pointes, to witt, that no other man had power to
iudge him: and that he had no power to iudge him ſelfe, ſaying:
I paſſe little to be iudged of you, or of mans iudgement, no I iudge not
my owne ſelfe. In which places, all power of iudging, as it is referred
either to iuſtifying or condemning, in pardoning, or not
pardoning ſinne, in the abſolving or not abſolving from ſinne,
is vtterly taken from all men, whether in reſpect of them ſelves
or others.
               Touching the ſecond grounde, which cleereth who it is
that Iuſtifies: there is nothing whereof the holy Scripture giveth
more cleere teſtimonie then of this: ſtill affirming, that is
is God onely, who Iuſtifieth: as is manifeſt, Rom. chap. 8. ver.
33. where expreſſely it is ſayde: It is GOD that Iuſtifieth: and in
that ſame Chapter 30. verſe, it is ſaide: Thoſe whom hee hath predeſtinate,
thoſe hee hath called: and whom hee hath called, thoſe alſo hee hath
iuſtified. which place ſheweth playnely, that it can belong to
none but to God alone. ſeeing that he who iuſtifieth, muſt bee
he who calleth, and hee who calleth muſt be he who predeſtinateth,
which is onely God. And againe, the ſame Apoſtle giveth
a cleere teſtimonie heereof, Rom. chapt. 3. ver. 30. ſaying:
For God is one who shall iustifie circonciſion of faith, and vncirconciſion thorough
faith. The like teſtimonie is conteyned, 1. Corinth. cha. 4.
verſ. 4. where the Apoſtle ſayeth: Hee that iudgeth mee is the Lorde.
Therefore ſayeth the ſame Apoſtle, Rom. chap. 14. ver. 12. That
every one of vs shall give accompt of him ſelfe vnto God.
               
               Nowe wee come to the third ground, which conſiſteth in
the nature of Iuſtification it ſelfe: which is not (as ſome interprete
it to be) the making of vs inheſively iuſt, by renovation,
or change of our nature: as though the word Iustificare, that is
to Iuſtifie, did ſignifie, Iuſtum facere, that is, to make juſt. By
which opinion, our Iuſtificatiō, and our Sanctification, are confounded,
and made one thinge. As though to Iuſtifie were
the action of GOD, in regeneratinge and recreatinge vs:

whereas it is the worke of God in iudging vs. ſo that Iuſtificar
                        •
                     
                  
doeth ſignifie Iuſtum pronuntiare, that is, to pronounce righteous,
which is manifeſt by two reaſons.
               The firſt is, becauſe in Scripture. Iuſtification is oppoſed to
condemnation: as is cleere by the teſtimonie cited before, Mat.
12. 37.
               The ſecond reaſon, is taken from the deſcription of Iuſtification,
ſet downe in the Scriptures: where ſometymes it is defined
to conſiſt, in the remiſſion of ſinnes, ſometymes in the forgiving
of wickednes, in the covering of ſinne, and not imputing
of iniquitie: ſometyme by the imputation of righteouſnes.
Which all doe prove manifeſtly, that Iuſtification is the Action
of him, who is the Iudge of mankinde, in abſolving man from
ſinne and the puniſhment thereof.
               Of this it followeth, that vnto God onely it belongeth to Iuſtifie.
and that for two ſpeciall reaſons.
               The firſt is, becauſe the Lord is the onely Iudge of all, Hebr.
12. 23. And therefore Acts 17. 31. it is ſayd: He hath appointed a day
in the which he will iudge the world in righteouſnes. Of which day the
Apoſtle alſo ſpeaketh, Rom. 2. 5. 16. and the reaſon heereof is
given by the Apoſtle, Rom. 14. 7. 8. to witt, becauſe hee is our
onely Lord, to whom we both live and die: and therefore according
as in that ſame place the Apoſtle concludes, VVe all shall
appeare before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, and every one of vs shall give
accompt of him ſelfe to God. Whereby it is cleere, ſeeing God is the
onely Iudge of the world, that to iuſtifie and to cōdemne, muſt
onely belonge to him.
               The ſecond reaſon is: ſeeing Iuſtification conſiſtes in remiſſion
of ſinnes, and not imputing of iniquitie: it followeth, that
not any, except God alone, can iuſtifie: becauſe none ſave God
alone, can forgive ſinne, as is cleere, Mark. 2. 7. and Luke 5. 21.
therefore doeth the Lord him ſelfe ſaye, Eſa. 43. 25. I, even I am he
that putteth away thy iniquities for myne owne ſake. And againe, 44. cha.
verſ 22. I have put away thy tranſgreſsions like a Cloud, and thy ſinnes as a
miſt. Likewiſe David doth attribute the not imputing of iniquitie
to the Lord, Pſal. 31. 2. ſaying: Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord

imputeth not iniquitie. which alſo the Apoſtle cleerely ſheweth, 2.
Corinth. 5. 19. ſaying, That God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to him
ſelfe, not imputing to them their ſinnes.
               
               Now, whereas it might ſeeme, that in treating of the efficient
cauſe of Iuſtification, we ſhould ſpeake not onely of God himſelfe,
but alſo of his grace: yet becauſe the queſtion touching his
grace, doeth alſo fitly belong to the formall cauſe, therefore wee
referre it vnto that place.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               NOw followeth that we ſpeake of the materiall cauſe. and
in this pointe, out of the former thinges, it may be eaſilie
gathered, that there be foure different opinions.
               The firſt is, that the workes of the Law done by man, are the
matter of our righteouſnes.
               The ſecond is, that the onely act of mans heart in beleeving,
is the matter of it.
               The third is, that partly faith, and partly Chriſtes obedience,
is the matter of our righteouſnes.
               The fourth and laſt is, that onely Chriſt, in his obedience, is
the whole matter of our righteouſnes.
               The vanitie of the firſt 3. opinions will more fully appeare,
when we ſpeake of the formal cauſe of iuſtification, &amp; when we
ſhall treat of Iuſtificatiō it ſelfe: as likewiſe when we ſhall cleere
the truth of the fourth opinion: therefore we wil ſpeak the more
ſhortlie of them now.
               Againſt all three, this ground generally ſerveth, to witt, that
no man is iuſtified before God, by any worke inherent in himſelfe,
or done by him ſelfe, whether it be of nature or of grace, or
whether it be a worke of the Lawe, or of the Goſpell. The reaſon
is: If man be iuſtified in any ſorte by workes, Iuſtification
can not be by grace, according as ſayeth the Apoſtle, Rom. 11. 6.
If it be of grace, it is no more of workes, els were grace no more grace: and if
it be of workes▪ it is no more grace, els were worke no more worke. Thus
none of theſe three formoſt opinions can ſtande: excepte we will
deſtroy the grace of God, and aboliſh it altogether frō the worke

of Iuſtification: for grace and workes, (even though they bee of
grace) can never ſtande together in the worke of our Iuſtification.
Which alſo manifeſteth, the groſſe impietie of all theſe
three opinions, in placing faith either in whole, or in parte, in
our righteouſnes, as it is our owne worke: ſeeing by no worke
of his owne, can man poſſibly be iuſtified. For otherwiſe it cannot
be, but Chriſt muſt have died in vaine.
               Secondly, our righteouſnes conſiſteth not in Gods acceptation
of any thing that proceeds from vs to Godward: but in Gods
imputation of that that comes from him to vſward by his gift. as
is cleere, Rom. 5. 15. 16. 17. where our righteouſnes is ſtill called
the gift of God: &amp; we are ſaide to receyve righteouſnes as a gift.
Whereby it is moſt evident that no worke of the Law, nor faith,
as it is the worke of our heart, can poſſibly be our righteouſnes.
For our act of beleeving, is an action paſſing from vs to Godward:
and being attributed (as it is by them) to mans free will,
is no leſſe the worke of man, then any other worke of the Law
what ſoever. But our righteouſnes is called in the Scriptures,
the righteouſnes of GOD, and not of man: becauſe it goeth
not from vs towardes him, but it commeth from him to
vs.
               Thirdly, it is manifeſt by the Scriptures, that no man is iuſt
in him ſelfe, but in another. For among men there is none
righteous, no not one, Pſal. 14. But if that whereby hee is iuſtified,
&amp; which is the matter of his righteouſnes bee in him ſelfe,
he muſt not onely bee iuſt, but iuſt in him ſelfe: which both doe
playnely contradict the trueth of God: which plainlie denies,
that there is any man righteous, and that any man is made righteous
in him ſelfe: but whom ſoever God iuſtifieth, he iuſtifieth
them in Chriſt, and maketh them the righteouſnes of God in
him, 2. Corinth. 5. 21.
               Fourthly, the nature of Iuſtification conſiſting in the remiſſion
of ſinne: it can not poſſibly ſtande, in that, that is the direct
contrarie. But all theſe three opinions maketh it ſtande in
the contrarie, that is in Gods acceptation of obedience. For
whether the Lorde iuſtifie vs, for doeing the workes of the

Lawe, or for fulfilling the condition of the Goſpell, required by
God of vs vnto Iuſtification: it is alwayes for and by our obedience
that he iuſtifieth vs. ſo that Iuſtification, ſhall never conſiſt
in pardoning of ſinne, and covering of iniquitie: but by the
contrarie, in the acceptation of obedience. Which ſaying is ſo
impious, that nothing can be deviſed more contrarie to the
grace of God, and mans ſalvation.
               Theſe groundes ſerve generally to ſhewe the wickednes
of all theſe three opinions. Nowe we come to ſpeake ſomwhat
concerning the firſt alone. againſt which theſe groundes conteyned
in ſcripture, ſhall ſufficiētly ſerve: of which divers make
againſt the reſt alſo.
               Firſt, that which excludes not mans gloriation, can not have
place in his righteouſnes: for God will have no fleſh to glory
in his ſight, in any thing except in him alone: wherevppon it
followeth, that no man can bee iuſtified by the workes of the
Law. For as ſayeth the Apoſtle Rom. chap. 3. verſ. 27. gloriation
is not excluded by the lawe of workes. For if Abraham was iuſtified
by workes, hee hath wherein to glory, Rom. chap. 4. verſ. 2. and
the reaſon heere of is declared in the fourth verſe, ſaying: That
to him that worketh, the wages is not compted by favour, but by debt.
Wherevpon it followeth, that if man bee iuſtified by workes, he
hath wherein to glorie: becauſe he is not iuſtified by grace,
but by deſervinge: and Gods iuſtifying of him, is not a worke
of his favour, but a worke, which hee is indebted to doe. And
this is the ſame very thing, which the Romish Church doeth meane
by their merit ex condigno. whereby Gods free grace iniuſtification
is quite overthrowen.
               Secondly, man can not be iuſtified, by that, which makes
the death of Chriſt of none effect: but as ſayeth the Apoſtle
Gallat. chapter 2. verſe 21. If righteouſnes bee by the Lawe, then
Chriſt hath died without a cauſe. Which place doeth evidently
convince them all of errour, and proove them all to bee enimies
to the croſſe of Chriſt, and to his death, that make righteouſnes
to bee by any other thinge then by his death: for if
Chriſt died without a cauſe, if righteouſnes bee by the Lawe:

he muſt have much more died in vaine, if it bee by any other
thing. For righteouſnes is not to be found in any other thing,
but either in the Law of God, or Chriſt.
               By this we may perceyve, that the opinion of thoſe men, who
place our righteouſnes in faith properly taken, as it is the acte of
our heart: without relation of it as an apprehending inſtrument
vnto Chriſt: is much more pernitious, then the opinion of the
Papiſtes. and that by cleere evidence of both their doctrines cō
                  pared
together. For the Papiſt placeth his righteouſnes, in that
which conteynes in it ſelfe perfect righteouſnes in deed: ſo that
if their other ground could holde (wherein alſo the other ſorte
doeth agree with them) that is, that it were in mans power to
fulfill the Lawe, certaynlie they ſhould be iuſtified by the works
of the Law. For the doers of the Lawe shalbe iustified, Rom. 2. 13. And
if there had bene a lawe given which could have given life, ſurely righteouſnes
should haue bene by the Lawe, ſayeth the ſame Apoſtle, Gal. 3. 21.
But theſe other men, doe place their righteouſnes, in that which
they them ſelves confeſſe to be imperfect, and not to contayne
in it ſelfe, perfect righteouſnes. For when, faith is not relatively
or inſtrumentally taken in reſpect of Chriſt apprehended by it:
it can never contayne perfect righteouſnes: and ſo the Lord can
never iuſtifie vs by it: For the iudgement of God is iuſt, and according
to trueth, Rom. 2. 2. and 5. verſes. and the Lord shall iudge the
world in righteouſnes, Acts 17. 31. of which it followeth, that there
is much more iniquitie, in theſe mens opinion, then in the Papiſtes:
becauſe they wittingly lay a ground to them ſelves, touching
iuſtification: wherein it is impoſſible that Gods iudgement
can be according to trueth: ſeeing they make him to iuſtifie
them, by that, which in their owne confeſſion, is never anſwerable
to the iuſtice of God.
               Thirdly, that can never iuſtifie a man, that cauſeth wrath, and
makes both faith and the promiſe vaine, and of none effect. and
therefore righteouſnes can never be by the Law. For as ſayeth
the Apoſtle, Rom. 4. 15. The Law cauſeth wrath. And againe, Gal.
3. 10. VVhoſoever are of the workes of the Lawe, are vnder the curſe. and
that this opinion doth make both faith and the promiſe of none

effect, it is manifeſt by the Apoſtle, Rom. chap. 4. verſ. 14. ſaying.
For if they which are of the Lawe be heires, faith is made voide, and the promiſe
is made of none effect. And againe, Gall. chap. 3. verſ. 18. For if
the inheritance be by the Law, it is no more by promiſe. By this may evidently
appeare, the groſſe ignorance of the Papiſtes, who doe
ioyne faith and the workes of the Law together, in the worke
of our Iuſtification: which two can never more ſtande together,
then grace and workes. For to be by faith, and to bee by grace, is
all one thing, according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle. Rom. 4. 16.
Therefore is it by faith, that it might be by grace.
               
               Fourthly, that whereby cōmeth the knowledge of ſinne, and
which maketh tranſgreſſion to abound, and which includeth all
men vnder ſinne, and which ſtoppeth all mouth, and maketh
all the world ſubiect to the iudgement of God: can never ſerve
to the Iuſtification of a man. Now that all theſe are the effects of
the Law, it is manifeſt by theſe Teſtimonies of Scripture. Rom.
chap. 7. verſ. 7. I knew not ſinne but by the Law. And againe, Rom. 5.
20. The Lawe entered in therevpon that the tranſgreſsion might abound.
And againe, Gall. 3. 22. But the Scripture hath included all vnder ſinne.
Whereby the word Scripture, is vnderſtood the Law: as is cleer
by the teſtimonie of the Apoſtle, Rom. chap. 3. verſ. 19. Where he
interpretes theſe Scriptures, by the which he had convinced all,
both Iewes and Grecians, to be vnder ſinne: ſaying, Wee knowe
that whatſoever things the Law ſpeaketh, it ſayeth it to them, which are vnder
the Law, that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world be made ſubiect
to the iudgement of God. And that the ſtrength of this reaſon may
appeare to be vncontrolable: The 20. verſe of that ſame 3. chap.
ſheweth it to be the argument, of Gods owne ſpirit: when as the
Apoſtle concludes after this manner. Therefore by the workes of the
Law, shall no flesh be iuſtified before him: for by the Law commeth the knowledge
of ſinne.
               
               Laſtly, this opinion fighteth directly, not only againſt the
teſtimonie of God himſelfe, but alſo againſt the teſtimonie of the
knowledge and cōſcience of the chiefeſt ſaints of God. Touching
Gods teſtimonie, it is cleere throughout all the Scriptures:
where he convinceth all men of ſinne: ſaying, There is none righteous

no not one, &amp;c. Rom. 3. And the Apoſtle in the ſame chapter
witneſſes: that by the workes of the Lawe, shall no flesh bee iuſtified before
him. And expreſly in the 4. chap. he ſayeth, that to him that worketh
not, but beleeveth in him that iustifieth the vngodly, his faith is imputed vnto
righteouſnes. And David placeth the righteouſnes of man in Gods
imputing of righteouſnes, without workes. Rom. 4. 6. And the
Apoſtle Paul expreſly concludeth. Gal. 5. 4. That they whoſoever
are iuſtified by the Lawe, are abolished from Chriſt, and are fallen from
grace.
               
               Now touching the knowledge and conſcience, of the chiefe
Saints of God: we have cleer teſtimonies from them. Eſa. 64. 6.
Wee have all bene as an vncleane thing, and all our righteouſnes is as filthie
clouts, &amp;c. The like confeſſion and plaine acknowledgment wee
have in Daniel, chap. 9. in the prayer that he makes vnto God.
But moſt clearly in the Apoſtles ſpeach, touching himſelfe, and
Peter, and remanent Apoſtles, and all the faithfull amongſt the
Iewes, Gall. 2. 15. 16. where he ſayeth, VVee, who are by nature Iewes,
and not ſinners of the Gentils, knowing that a man is not iuſtified by the works
of the Law, but only by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt: even we have beleeved in Ieſus
Christ, that wee might bee iuſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the
workes of the Lawe: For by the workes of the Lawe, noe flesh shall bee iustified.
               
               Therefore the ſame Apoſtle Paul, albeit hee was vnrebukeable,
touching the righteouſnes which is in the Lawe: yet notwithſtanding,
he accompted that righteouſnes, to bee but loſſe
vnto him, and did caſt it from him as filtie dounge, that he might
gaine Chriſt, and bee found in him: That is, (as himſelfe interpreteth)
that he might be found, not having his owne righteouſnes,
which is of the Law: but that which is through the faith of
Chriſt: that is the righteouſnes which is of God through faith.
Phil. chap. 3.
               Now to conclude this point, wee will ſhew, not only the vanitie,
but the impoſſibilitie of this opinion, by this one ground,
which is cleere in Scripture.
               Firſt, it is evident that the next and immediate end, of our
iuſtification is our peace and recōciliation with God. For being

iuſtified, we have peace toward God, ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 5. 1
And therefore peace is ſaid to bee made by the bloud of Chriſt.
Colloſ. 1. 20. And the manner how God reconcileth, is ſaide to
bee by iuſtifying, 2 Cor. 5. 19. For God was in Christ, reconciling the
world to himſelfe, by not imputing to them their ſinnes: which is all one, as
to ſay, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelfe,
by iuſtifying them.
               Secondly, it is evident, that there is no reconciliation betwixt
God and vs, without a Mediator. Therefore the Law was
not given, but by the hand of a Mediator. Gall. 3. 19. Neither is
the covenant of the Goſpell confirmed, without a Mediator.
               And all confirmation of whatſoever covenant is by bloud:
becauſe without ſhedding of bloud, there is no purgation, nor
iuſtification from ſinne: and that by him who is Mediator. For
then is the covenant of Peace, betwixt God and man confirmed,
when he, who is the Mediator of the covenant, hath by the
ſprinckling of bloud, purged away all filthines, and obtayned
full remiſſion: as is cleere by the 9. to the Hebr. And therefore
ſayeth the Apoſtle in the ſame chapter verſe 18. That even the firſt
covenant, was not ordayned without bloud. And Moyſes the Mediator of
that covenant, when with that bloud, he had ſprinckled all the
people: he ſaid, this is the bloud of the Teſtament, which God hath appointed
vnto you. Exo. 24. 8. Heb. 9. 20.
               Nowe it is playne, that Ieſus Chriſt, in his bloud, is our peace
and reconciliation with God: For no bloud, ſave his bloud
alone, can purge vs from our iniquities, and iuſtifie vs. And
there is no Mediator betwixt God and vs, ſave hee alone. For as
ſayeth the Apoſtle, 1 Timoth. chap. 1. verſ. 5. There is but one Mediator
betwixt God and Man, even Ieſus Chriſt the Man. Whereby it is
playne, that none can make a firme and ſtable covenant of
peace, betwixt God and vs, but hee alone: neither can he make
this covenant ſure, by any other meane, except his death and
blood ſhedd: becauſe no other thing in heaven or earth, can
purge vs, and obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtifie vs. Therefore
is it ſaid, 1 Pet. chap. 3. verſ. 18. That Chriſt once ſuffered for ſinnes

the iuſt for the vniuſt, that he might bring vs to God. Vpon which reſpect
it is that by him we are ſaid to have acceſſe to the Father. Epheſ.
2. 18. and 3. 12.
               Now vpon all theſe grounds, we have to gather, of what covenant
Chriſt is Mediator: that is, whether of the covenant of
workes, or of the covenant of grace, or (which is all one thing)
whether of the covenant of the Law, or of the Goſpell. For God
hath never made any other covenant of Peace with man, then
theſe two. So that in one of theſe two muſt conſiſt, both our Iuſtification
and Peace with God: and of which ſoever of theſe
covenants, hee is Mediator, and which of them ſoever hee hath
confirmed by his death, in that only muſt conſiſt our righteouſnes
and peace.
               But it is manifeſt by the Scriptures, that he is not Mediator of
the old, but of the new Teſtam. as is cleere by the Apoſtle, Heb.
9. 15. where he ſayeth, For this cauſe is hee alſo the Mediator of the newe
Testament. And againe, Heb. 12. 24. and vnto Ieſus the Mediator of the
new Teſtament. And this is confirmed by the ſame Apoſtle, Heb. 7.
from the nature of his Prieſt-hood. For as the Apoſtle there witneſſeth
in the 12. verſe, where the Prieſt-hood is changed, of neceſsitie,
the Law alſo muſt be changed. Therefore it muſt follow, that Chriſt,
beeing a Prieſt, not after the order of Aaron (vnder the which
the Law was given) but after the order of Melchiſedech: that he
cannot poſſiblie bee the Mediator of the old Teſtament, that is
of the covenant of the Law: and therefore in that ſame chap. ver.
22. it is ſaid, that Ieſus is the Mediator of a better Teſtament then the Law.
               
               Herevpon followeth this concluſion: that it is not only a
vaine opinion, but alſo an impoſſible, that any fleſh can ever be
iuſtified by the workes of the Lawe. For no covenant whereof
Chriſt is not the Mediator, and which hee hath never confirmed
by his death, can ever poſſibly ſerve to our Iuſtification: but of
the covenant of workes or of the law, Ieſus is no wiſe Mediator,
neither hath hee died and ſhed his bloud to confirme it. Therefore
by the covenant of workes no fleſh ſhall ever bee iuſtified
and have acceſſe vnto God.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               NOW for the ſecond and third opinion, the diſcuſſing of
them is coincident with the points following, and eſpecially
in the next point: which concerneth the 4. opinion:
that is, that only Chriſt is the matter of our righteouſnes.
Whereof now we are to ſpeake, which beeing ſufficiently cleered,
is enough to overthrow all other opinions whatſoever.
               Now to make it manifeſt, that in Chriſt alone is the matter of
our righteouſnes, wee are: firſt, to divide this point in two: and
ſecondly to ſet downe the confirmations of both.
               The two partes wherein this point is to be divided, be theſe:
Firſt, that nothing in heaven or in earth, in man or without
man, is the matter of mans righteouſnes before God, except only
Chriſt.
               The ſecond is, touching that, wherein in particular Chriſt is
our righteouſnes.
               Now for the confirmation of the firſt point, we have theſe ſix
grounds ſhortly to be conſidered.
               Firſt, nothing can be our righteouſnes, but that only which is
made by God righteouſnes vnto vs. For he is only righteous, and
the only Author of all righteouſnes. For as there is no man righteous,
ſo there is no man that can make any thing, to be righteouſnes,
either to himſelfe or to others. And therefore wee are to
conſider what it is, that God the Creator and ordayner of all
the righteouſnes of men, hath ordayned and made righteouſnes
to vs. Nowe in all the trueth of God, nothing is ever ſaid to bee
made of God vnto vs righteouſnes, except Ieſus Chriſt alone:
Neither is there any thing whatſoever, that is called our righteouſnes,
whereby wee are iuſtified by God, except Chriſt alone,
and his obedience. Wherevpon it muſt follow, that he only muſt
be the matter of our righteouſnes. Therefore is it ſaid by the Apoſtle,
1 Cor. 1. 30. that hee is made of God vnto vs, Wiſdome, Righteouſnes,
Sanctification and Redemption. And in the Prophete Ierem. 23 6.
This name is given him of God, as the name by the which the

children of God, ſhall call him: while it is ſaid, And this is the
name whereby they ſhall call him: The Lord our righteouſnes. And againe,
chapter 33. verſ. 16. And hee that shall call her, is the Lord ou
                        •
                     
righteouſnes.
               
               Secondly, that only muſt be our righteouſnes, which only is
all in all things, and only filleth all, in all things. For he that is
vnto vs, all, in all things, muſt needes be our only righteouſnes:
and hee that filleth vs all, in all things, muſt needes fill vs likewiſe
in righteouſnes. Now Chriſt only in the Scriptures of God,
hath both theſe attributed vnto him. The firſt is ſhewen cleerly.
Colloſ. 3. 11. And the ſecond is cleerly ſhewen, Eph. 1. 23. Therefore
is it, that the Apoſtle Peter, Act. chap. 4. verſ. 12. ſayeth: That
there is not ſalvation in any other. For among men, there is given none other
name vnder heaven, whereby we muſt be ſaved. And for this ſame cauſe
doth the Apoſtle ſay, That we are made the righteouſnes of God in him.
2 Corinth. chap. 5. verſ. 21. As likewiſe, that in him wee are made
perfect or complete. Col. chap. 2. verſ. 10. Therefore alſo doeth the
Apoſtle bleſſe God the Father, for bleſſing vs with all ſpirituall
bleſſinges in Chriſt, Epheſ. chap. 1. verſ. 3. And if with all
bleſſinges, then alſo vndoubtedly, with righteous in him: except
wee will denie righteouſnes to bee one of the ſpirituall
bleſſinges of God. Therefore the Scripture, admitteth nothing
to bee ioyned with him: neyther hath the Father ordayned
any thing, to have parte or place with him, in the matter of our
righteouſnes. For it hath pleaſed the Father, that in him all
fulnes ſhould dwell: and that out of his fulnes wee ſhould receyve,
what ſoever grace wee receyve from God. And this is
a parte of that preheminence which Chriſt hath in all thinges:
ſo that whoſoever placeth the matter of his righteouſnes in any
thinge but Chriſt, denieth flatly, that hee hath preheminence
in all things.
               Thirdlie, nothing can bee the matter of our righteouſnes.
which is not the matter of our redemption. For as ſayeth the
Apoſtle Rom. chapt. 3. verſ. 24. VVee are iuſtified freely by his grace,
through the redemption that is in Chriſt IESVS: Therefore is it that

in the Scriptures, Redemption is ſo often interpreted, to bee
remiſſion of ſinnes: which is in effect righteouſnes, as Epheſ.
chapt. 1. verſ. 7. and Coloſ. chapt. 1. verſ. 14. Thereby ſhewing
vs, that our righteouſnes, conſiſteth of that ſame, whereof conſiſteth
our Redemption. And it is cleere and manifeſt throughout
all the holy Scriptures, that we have Redemption in Chriſt
alone. Therefore in the ſame places, cited before, the Redemption
whereby wee are iuſtified, is ſaide to be in Chriſt IESVS:
and wee are ſaide to have Redemption in him. Wherevppon it
muſt needes followe, that ſeeing our Redemption is in him
alone, our righteouſnes muſt alſo bee in him alone. For although
in the holy Scriptures it bee ſaide, that wee are iuſtified
by faith, yet it is never ſaide, that we are redeemed by faith: or
that our Redemption is in faith. Whereby it is moſt evident,
that when the ſpirit of God ſayeth, that wee are iuſtified by faith,
or that God doeth iuſtifie vs through faith, or that hee imputes
faith vnto righteouſnes: that theſe ſpeeches, are never to bee
vnderſtood of faith, materially: as though faith properly taken
were the matter of our righteouſnes before God: except wee
will ſay likewiſe, that faith is the matter of our redemption:
which no man is ſo ignorant, as once to imagine. For nothing
can bee the matter of our redemption, and ſo conſequently of
our righteouſnes, which is not made of God ſinne for vs, and a
propitiation for ſinne.
               For it is ſaide expreſly, that God made our Saviour Chriſt
ſinne for vs, that wee might bee made the righteouſnes of God
in him. 2 Corinth. chapter 5. verſe 21. and Chriſt is ſaid to have
redeemed vs from the curſe of the Lawe, by beeing made a
curſe and malediction for vs. Gallath. chapter 3. verſe 13. All
to ſhewe vs that nothing can bee the matter of our Righteouſnes,
and of our Redemption, which is not made both ſinne
and the curſe due to ſinners for vs.
               Which two thinges were lively and openly ſhadowed in the
Lawe.
               The firſt Levit. chapt. 16. by the live Goat: where it is ſaide,

                  And Aaron shall put both his handes vpon the head of the live-Goat, and confeſſe
over him all the iniquities of the Children of Iſrael, and all their treſpaſſes
in all their ſinnes, putting them vpon the head of the Goat, and shall ſend
him away by the hand of a man appointed into the wildernes: ſo the Goat shall
beare vpon him all their iniquities. And this the Prophet Eſay expreſſeth
plainly, when he ſayeth that the Lord laid vpon Chriſt the
iniquities of vs all: and that he bare the ſinne of many. chap. 53.
As alſo Peter, when he ſayeth, that Chriſt himſelfe bare our iniquities
in his owne body vpon the tree. 1 Pet. 2. 24. The ſecond was ſhadowed
vnto vs, in the ordinance of God concerning all offerings for
ſinne. In which, when the treſpaſſer had laid his hande vpon
their head, the Prieſt was commanded to kill them before the
Lord, and to burne them with fire. Levit. 4. Which alſo the Prophet
Eſay expreſſeth, when he ſayeth: that hee was wounded for our
tranſgreſsions: he was broken for our iniquities: the chaſtiſement of our peace
was vpon him. chap. 53. As alſo Pet. when he ſayeth, that hee ſuffered
for ſinnes, the iust for the vniuſt. Now there is no man ſo fooliſh, as to
thinke that theſe things can bee attributed vnto faith: or yet to
the workes of the Law: or to any thing whatſoever except vnto
Ieſus Chriſt alone. Therefore nothinge, ſave he alone, can poſſibly
be the matter of our righteouſnes: ſeeing, nothing, except he
alone, was ever made of God for vs, either ſinne, or a propitiation
for ſinne, by death.
               Fourthly, nothing that is not the matter of our peace and reconciliation
with God, can poſſibly be the matter of our righteouſnes.
For nothing can procure peace vnto vs, but that only
which iuſtifieth vs, and covereth our iniquities. For there is no
peace for the wicked ſayth the Lord: and it is our iniquities that
ſeperates vs from God. Eſay 57. 21. and 59. 2. Therefore the Apoſtle
ſayeth, Rom. 5. 1. that beeing iustified, we have peace toward God.
For the cleanging of vs from ſinne, (which is the cauſe of hatred)
makes vs to be reconciled vnto God. Now the Lord Ieſus
only, in the Scriptures, is called our peace: and in him only, God
reconciled the worlde vnto himſelfe: and that by iuſtifying vs,
and this peace &amp; reconciliation, is ſaid to be made, by the bloud
of his croſſe: becauſe therein only, we have remiſſion of ſinnes:

and therein onely is Chriſt ordayned a propitiation for ſinne.
Wherevpon it followeth, that ſeeing nothing is our peace but
Chriſt onely: nothing can be our righteouſnes but he only. For
nothing but righteouſnes, makes peace betwixt God and man.
               Fiftlie, righteouſnes and life, are ordayned to be brought into
the world: as ſinne and death were brought into the worlde:
therefore is it that Adam (in reſpect of the effectes that come
from him to all men) is ſaide to be the Type of Chriſt in the effectes
that flow from him to his members. For it is ſaide,
that as by one man, ſinne entred into the world: ſo by one man,
righteouſnes ſhalbe brought into the worlde. And as in Adam
all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. According to which
ground it is alſo ſaide, That as we have borne the Image of the
earthlie, ſo ſhall wee beare the Image of the heavenly. Wherevpon
it followeth, that nothing in the world, except Chriſt, can
be the matter of our Righteouſnes: as none in the worlde, ſave
onely Adam, is the Authour of ſinne in vs, otherwiſe the trueth
in Chriſt touching righteouſnes, ſhould never anſwer to the
Type in Adam, concerning ſinne. Therefore as ſinne commeth
from Adam alone vnto vs all, as he in whom wee have all ſinned:
ſo from Ieſus Chriſt alone, commeth righteouſnes to all,
that are in him: as he, in whom they have all ſatisfied the iuſtice
of God. In which compariſon, (if we had eyes to marke it) faith
never hath the place of our righteouſnes, but anſweres in our
participation of righteouſnes in Chriſt, to that, which is the
ground of our being partakers in the ſinne of Adam. For as wee
were one with Adam, and in reſpect of origine and nature were
in him, and ſo by being in him and one with him, did all in him
and with him, tranſgreſſe the commandement of God: even ſo,
in reſpect of faith, whereby onely we are vnited vnto Chriſt▪
and ſpiritually made one with him, and ingrafted in him: wee
all in him, and with him, did ſatisfie the iuſtice of God, in his
death, and ſuffering. Thus, our vnion with Chriſt, and meanes
thereof, is alwayes to be diſtinguiſhed, from our communion

with him, in the participation of his righteouſnes, as the fruit
thereof. Like as our being in Adam, and one with him, is to be
diſtinguiſhed, from the fruit thereof: which is, communiō with
him, in the participation of his tranſgreſſion. For clearing of
this pointe, we have to marke carefully, the wordes of the ſpirit
of God vnto Daniel, chap. 9. verſ, 24. In the which, an appeinted
tyme is ſet downe, for the finiſhing of wickednes, the ſealing
vp of ſinnes, the reconciling of iniquitie, and bringing in
of everlaſting righteouſnes in the worlde. Thereby ſhewing
vs, that it is impoſſible, that faith can bee the materiall righteouſnes
of GOD, whereby we are iuſtified. For then, this everlaſting
righteouſnes, ſhould have beene in the worlde, before
Chriſt came into the worlde: and ſo ſhould not have beene
brought in by him. For faith was in the worlde, from the dayes
of Adam. Therefore ſayeth the ſpirit of GOD, that by it, our
Flders obtayned good report: and yet in that ſame place, the
ſpirit witneſſeth that they receyved not the promiſe, diſtinguiſhing
betwixt faith, and Chriſt apprehended by faith, as
the matter of the promiſe, and ſo conſequently, of righteouſnes.
The one whereof, that is faith, they had receyved: the other,
that is the promiſe, they had not receyved: becauſe Chriſt
(in whom their bleſſednes was promiſed) was not exhibited in
their dayes.
               For, albeit by faith, they apprehended Chriſt crucified, to
come, and the righteouſnes, which hee was to bring vnto the
worlde at his comming: yet notwithſtanding, that righteouſnes,
in the ſubſtance and matter of it, was never brought into
the worlde, vnto the tyme, that Chriſt IESVS was brought
into the worlde. Therefore doeth the Lord vſe this phraſe of
ſpeech: My ſalvation is at hande to come, and my righteouſnes to bee
revealed, Eſay chapter 56. verſ 1. According vnto which likewiſe,
the Apoſtle Paul ſpeaketh, That GOD had purpoſed in the
diſpenſation of the fulnes of tyme, to gather together all thinges in Chriſt,
Eph. ch. 1. ve. 10. Which the ſame Apoſtle declareth more cleerlie,
Gallath. chap. 4. verſ. 4. 5. ſaying: But when the fulne: of tyme

was come, God ſent foorth his Sonne, made of a VVoman, and made vnder
the Lawe, that hee might redeeme them which were vnder the
Lawe, &amp;c. So that the verie deſigning of a preciſe tyme, for the
bringing in of our righteouſnes into the worlde, declareth manifeſtly,
that that righteouſnes, is to bee materially diſtinguiſhed
from faith, which was in the worlde in all ages, before
ever it was manifeſted. For faith could bee in the worlde,
and apprehende righteouſnes, which was to bee brought into
the worlde, long before it came: as well as nowe, long after
that righteouſnes is performed, it can lay holde vppon it vnto
iuſtification.
               For, the faith of Gods Children, before the day of Chriſt,
and the faith of Gods Children, nowe after the day of Chriſt:
did ever, and yet doeth apprehende no righteouſnes, but that,
which in that day was brought into the worlde. For it is as
eaſie to faith, to apprehende righteouſnes to come, as it is to
faith, to apprehende, by gone righteouſnes. Like as our faith,
yet apprehendeth many thinges to come. as ſpecially our
glorification, which is yet a thing no wiſe manifeſted: neither
ſhall be manifeſted, vntill Chriſt appeare agayne in his ſecond
comming in glorie. This ſame grounde ſerveth to prove,
that the Lawe and workes thereof, was never the matter of our
righteouſnes: ſeeing the Lawe was given longe before Chriſts
comming into the world.
               Laſtly, that which doeth not make manifeſt, God to be iuſt,
and the Iuſtifier: can never poſſibly bee that righteouſnes,
whereby we are iuſtified. This ground is cleere by the Apoſtles
wordes, Rom. chap. 3. where hee declareth the ende wherefore
God doeth manifeſt his righteouſnes, and to that ende ſetteth
foorth Chriſt to bee a Propitiation by faith in his bloud: which
is, that he may be iuſt, and the iuſtifier of him that is of the faith
of IESVS. For the rightouſnes of GOD, whereby hee iuſtifieth
vs, beeing manifeſted, muſt of neceſſitie, not onely declare
GOD to bee mercifull, but alſo iuſt. And therefore it is
nor ſufficient and enough, that grace doe ſhine in our iuſtification,
in reſpect of Gods grace and mercie towardes vs:

but moreover, it is neceſſarie, that iuſtice doe ſhine in our iuſtification
in reſpect of GOD him ſelfe: ſo that albeit wee receyve
remiſſion of ſinnes, without any merit, or reaſon in our
ſelves, but of Gods free grace toward vs in Chriſt: yet notwithſtanding
God in doeing ſo, muſt ſtill be iuſt. For as ſayth Abraham,
Gen. 18. Shall not the Iudge of the worlde doe right? Now this iuſtice
of God in iuſtifying, is perceyved by the fight of the righteouſnes
of God, whereby he iuſtifies. as is plaine by that ſpeech
of the Apoſtle in Rom. chap. 3. For to this ende doeth God ſhow
his righteouſnes, that he may be iuſt. Now it is certayne, that if
God ſhould iuſtifie vs, eyther by the workes of the Lawe, or by
faith, as it is a worke or habit in vs: GOD could never bee
ſeene to be iuſt, in iuſtifying of vs, becauſe there is no fleſh that
abides in every jot that is written in the Lawe of God. Neyther
is there any that doeth it. And concerning faith, the very Saints
them ſelves in the ſcriptures have acknowledged their faith to
be imperfect. And they who now place faith for the matter of
our righteouſnes, doeth acknowledge that it is not anſwearable
to the iuſtice of God: becauſe it is not full and perfect righteouſnes.
but Ieſus Chriſt whom God hath made righteouſnes vnto
vs, in his death, being manifeſted vnto vs, in his ſatisfaction,
doeth let vs ſee a full and perfect righteouſnes, anſwerable to
the iuſtice of God in all things: ſo that God is not vniuſt, in iuſtifying
thereby. ſeeing in that iuſtification, hee iuſtifieth vs, by
that which in it ſelfe is a righteouſnes, as full and perfect, as his
iuſtice doeth require, and the conſcience of this, hath forced
ſome of theſe men, who holde our righteouſnes to conſiſt in
faith: to confeſſe, that the obedience of Chriſt muſt be imputed
vnto vs, as well as our owne faith. ſo making a double action
of God, in iuſtifying. one gracious, in reſpect of faith: another
iuſt, in reſpect of Chriſtes obedience.
               Vpon this ground it followeth neceſſarily, that nothing can
be our righteouſnes, except Chriſt alone. ſeeing the Lord cannot
be ſeene to be iuſt, in inſtifying vs, by any thing, except by
him alone.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIIII.
               IT followeth now that we ſpeake of the ſecond point: which
concerneth the matter of our righteouſnes, that is, what is
that thing, wherein Chriſt is made of God righteouſnes vnto
vs: and this in one word in the ſcripture, is ſaide to bee his obedience,
Rom. chap. 5. verſ. 19, Where it is ſaid: For as by one mans
diſobedience, many were made ſinners: ſo alſo by the obedience of one man,
many shallbe made righteous: and this general is embraced of all, who
acknowledge Chriſt to be our righteouſnes: but yet in a threefolde
different ſenſe.
               The firſt is, of thoſe who by the obedience of Chriſt, vnderſtande
the whole worke of his humiliation. in the which, they
lay three groundes, wherein they place the matter of our righteouſnes.
               The firſt is, the worke of Chriſt in taking vpon him our Nature
without ſinne.
               The ſecond is, his active obedience in fulfilling the Lawe of
God, during the whole courſe of his life.
               The third is, his paſſive obedience in ſubmitting him ſelfe to
the death, and that of the croſſe.
               In the firſt of theſe actions, they place our iuſtification from
originall ſinne, and the inborne corruption of our nature.
               In the ſecond, they place our Iuſtification from all our actuall
ſinnes, both of commiſſion, and of omiſſion.
               In the third, they place our Iuſtification and abſolution from
the puniſhment due to our ſinnes.
               The ſecond ſenſe, wherein the obedience of Chriſt is taken,
is when thereby his active and paſſive obediēce are only meant:
without reſpect of the integritie of his nature: and this twofold
obedience, they eſteeme to be neceſſarie in our iuſtification, againſt
the two evills wherevnto wee are ſubiect through the fall
of Adam.
               The firſt is the evill of ſinne. From the which, they eſteeme
vs to bee iuſtified, by the imputation of Chriſtes active obedience

in fulfilling the Law.
               The ſecond is the evill of puniſhment. From the which they
eſteeme vs to be iuſtified, by the imputation of Chriſtes paſſive
obedience in his death and ſufferings.
               The third ſenſe, wherein the obedience of Chriſt is taken in
our iuſtification: is when thereby the paſſive obediēce of Chriſt
only in his death, is vnderſtood, by the imputation whereof only,
as that wherein Chriſt only is made our righteouſnes: wee
are iuſtified from all ſinne and puniſhment thereof.
               Theſe three opinions, agreeing all in the mayne pointe:
(that is, that onely Chriſt in his obedience, is our righteouſnes)
may well (without any contention, ſtrife or ſciſme) bee tollerated
in the Church of God: if Chriſtian modeſtie, humblenes of
mind, &amp; meeknes did in that meaſure poſſeſſe al, that they could
ſupport one another in love: and ſtudie more to keepe the vnitie
of the ſpirit, in the baunde of peace: then by controverſies of
diſputations, to engender ſtrife. Eſpecially ſeeing none of theſe
opinions, overthrowe the foundation: or yet contayneth in
them, any impietie: or leadeth any man from the marke or
matter of his righteouſnes. ſeeing all three, exclude all things,
except onely Chriſtes obedience, from our righteouſnes. Moreover,
if wee ſhall conſider two thinges diſtinctlie: we ſhall eaſilie
perceyve, that theſe three opinions, may eaſily be reconciled,
and made all to agree in one: and that none of them is contrarie
to the trueth of God.
               The two things which are diſtinctly to bee conſidered, are
theſe.
               The firſt is that wherein ſtandeth the righteouſnes it ſelfe,
which is imputed vnto vs.
               The ſecond is of theſe thinges, which are requiſite in Chriſt,
to the end that in the other, he may be righteouſnes vnto vs.
               For theſe two thinges are not to bee confounded: that is,
that wherein Chriſt is made righteouſnes: and that whereby he
is made meete, to be our righteouſnes, in that wherein hee is
made righteouſnes vnto vs. Like as the bloud of the Lambe,
(ſhadowing Chriſtes bloud) is to bee diſtinguiſhed from theſe

thinges in the Lambe, which made the Lambes bloud, to ſerve
for a propitiation for ſinne. For the properties of the beaſt
which was to bee ſacrifiſed for ſinne: are to bee diſtinguiſhed
from the bloud of the beaſt, which onely was carried
in to the moſt holy place, to make expiation of ſinnes before
the Lord.
               This ground being conſidered, wee ſhall eaſilie perceyve,
that although Chriſt, bee made righteouſnes vnto vs, in one
particular thinge: yet, before in that thinge, hee can bee our
righteouſnes: all his perfections, both in nature and action is
required.
               For cleering hereof yet more: we have to conſider, that the
matter of our righteouſnes in it ſelf, is not to be confunded, with
the action of God in iuſtifying vs thereby. vnto the which, many
things are required, that are no parte nor portion of the righteouſnes
it ſelfe. ſo that, if wee ſpeake of the action of our iuſtification:
all what ſoever is conteyned, in all theſe three opinions,
and more alſo, in Chriſt, is required thereto. but if we
ſpeake of the matter of the righteouſnes it ſelfe, whereby wee
are iuſtified: wee are to conſider of them, otherwiſe. Therefore
it ſhall bee needfull, that wee conſider theſe two points
ſeverally: that is firſt, what it is wherein particularly Chriſt
is righteouſnes vnto vs.
               Secondly, What thinges they are, that are required in him,
to the ende, that in the other, hee may bee righteouſnes vnto
vs.
               Touching the firſt, The queſtion or doubt ſeemeth chieflie
to ariſe vpon the worde Obedience: which in deede is oftentymes
in the Scripture, referred to the whole worke of Chriſts
humiliation: even from his conception, to his reſurrection. So
that all whatſoever hee did in the world, is accompted obedience
vnto the Father. Thus his very Incarnation, and takinge
vppon him our nature, and taking of it in the ſimilitude
of ſinfull fleſh, his becomming vnder the Lawe, his taking
our ſinnes and tranſgreſſions vpon him, his becomming a
curſe for vs, his becomming our high Prieſt, his offering of

him ſelfe vnto the Father, his doctrine, his actions, his ſufferings
and reſurrection, are all to be accompted obedience. For it
was the Father that ſent him into the worlde: and he came
into the world, not to doe his owne will, but the will of the Father
that ſent him: therefore he witneſſeth him ſelfe, that hee
ſpake nothing, but according to the commandement which his
Father had given him, Iohn chap. 12. verſ. 49. the ſame hee witneſſeth
of his actions, Ioh, chep. 14. verſ. 31. as alſo of his death
and reſurrection, Iohn chap. 10. ver. 18. and yet there is no man,
that will ſay, that all the particulars of Chriſtes ſayings and doinges,
are parte and portion of the matter of our righteouſnes:
albeit every one of them be a parte of his obedience.
               Therefore we muſt needes take the name of Chriſtes obedience,
in a more ſtrict ſenſe: when we vnderſtand by it, the matter
of our righteouſnes. and this ſtricter ſenſe, we are not to gather,
out of our owne conceyts and fantaſies, but out of the expreſſe
word of God.
               The word, every where, when it ſpeakes of our righteouſnes,
not vnder the generall worde of Chriſtes obedience, but
particularly, by thoſe workes of his obedience, wherein our
righteouſnes conſiſteth: doeth onely mention his ſufferinge,
death, or laying downe of his life, or his bloud, or his oblation,
or offering of him ſelfe, or his being made ſinne, or his bearinge
the chaſtiſement of our peace, and ſuch like phraſes. Which all
ſignifie one thing: that is, his ſuffering in the fleſh. For no where
in the Scriptures of God, is our righteouſnes, particularly attributed
to any other action of Chriſt. Neither can it bee collected,
to conſiſt in any other action, except out of the generall worde
of obedience. Neither is there any neceſſitie (if the matter bee
well waighed) to adde any thing, to the ſufferings of Chriſt, in
the matter of our righteouſnes. yea moreover, it would appeare
by divers groundes of the trueth of God, that nothing can, or
may be added therevnto, in the matter of our righteouſnes.
               Which groundes, we will ſhortiy touch, leaving them to everie
mans conſideration: intending no wiſe to ſtirre vp any ſtrife
in the Church of God, for this matter. Neyther minding, vpon

preſumption of knowledge, to determine or give ſentence, in a
matter of ſuch waight but only to communicate the light that
God hath given me, with others, for their helpe, and no wayes
for their hinderance.
               The firſt ground, which we marke in Scriptures, is this: wee
are not to eſteeme Chriſt, to be our righteouſnes, in any thing,
but in that only, wherein God hath purpoſed, and according to
his purpoſe ordayned, &amp; according to his ordaynance, ſet forth,
Chriſt to be our righteouſnes and propitiation. Nowe the purpoſe
of God, is cleerely ſett downe by the Apoſtle, Col. chap, 1.
ver. 19. 20. where it is ſaide: It pleaſed the Father, that in him should all
fulnes dwell: and by him to reconcile all things vnto him ſelfe: making peace
by the bloud of his croſſe. The ordinance of God, conforme to his
purpoſe, may be received, 1. Pet. 1. 18. 19. 20. where it is ſayd, that
we are redeemed or ranſomed, by the precious blond of Chriſt, as of a Lambe
vndefiled and without ſpot: ordayned before the foundation of the world was.
His ſetting him foorth according to his purpoſe and ordinance,
is declared Rom. chap. 3. ver. 25. where it is ſaide: whom God ſett
foorth before a propitiation, by faith, in his bloud: to shewe his righteouſnes.
All which places, are in all appearance, to be interpreted of the
eternall purpoſe of God, concerning the matter of our righteouſnes
and peace: although our vulgar tranſlations doe interprete
that place of Peter, to be of Gods ordināce: and that place
of the Rom. to bee, of the Lords ſetting foorth of Chriſt in the
ceremonies of the Lawe. Yet all ſerveth to one purpoſe: that
is, to declare that God hath purpoſed and ordayned Chriſt, in
his bloud, to be our righteouſnes: as all theſe three places doe
expreſlie witnes. And if we ſhal take the word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   (which
properly ſignifieth fore-purpoſed) in that ſignification wherein
it is commonly rendered (that is to ſett foorth) wee ſhall finde
nothing in all the ceremonies and types of Gods Lawe, wherein
Chriſt was ſet out or ſhadowed to be our propitiation and attoneme
                     ••
                  
except only his death and bloud. For without shedding
of bloud, ther
                        •
                      
                     
                        ••
                      no remiſsion: and according to the Lawe almoſt all
things were purged by blond, Hebr. chapt. 9. verſ. 22. Therefore the
Apoſtle attributeth our righteouſnes, vnto his bloud onely, in

many and divers places. as Rom. chapt. 5. verſ. 9. Epheſ. chapt.
1. verſ. 7. Coloſ. chap. 1. verſ. 14. &amp;c. And this grounde is made
ſure, by the Apoſtles reaſoning, Heb. 6. and 10. chapt. giving
the reaſon, why thoſe, who ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, can never
receyve grace, nor bee renewed by repentance. Which is,
becauſe there remayneth no more a ſacrifice for ſinne: ſeeing
Chriſt can die no more, neither bee expoſed any more to ignominie
and ſhame. Out of which ſpeech, wee may moſt ſurely
gather, that Chriſt is appointed our righteouſnes and peace, in
nothing, but in his death and bloud of his croſſe. For if there
were any other thing, whereby remiſſion of ſinnes might be obtayned,
the Apoſtle would not have concluded impoſſibilitie of
remiſſion of that ſinne, vpon that onely grounde, that Chriſt
could be crucified no more.
               This ſame is yet further confirmed, by thoſe thinges wherein
Adam as the Type and figure, is compare vnto Chriſt, in
the matter of our righteouſnes, Rom. chapt. 5. For not onely is
one man, compared vnto one man, and the ſinne and tranſgreſgreſſion
of one man, to the obedience of one man: but alſo, one
tranſgreſſion of one man, committed but once, to one obedience,
of one man, performed but once. In which reſpect it is
ſayde in the holy Scriptures of God, Hebr. chap. 9. verſ. 14. That
by one offeringe, hee hath conſecrated vs for ever. And againe. verſ.
10. VVee are ſanctified by the offeringe of IESVS Crist once made.
Even as Adam (albeit thereafter hee committed many tranſgreſſions,
whereof none of his ſeede is guiltie) did never tranſgreſſe
but once the cōmandement of the forbidden fruit. Which
one diſobedience, once committed, is the only ſinne and tranſgreſſion
of Adam, that makes vs ſinners in him: and this Type,
is a cleere evidence, of Gods eternall purpoſe, touching our
righteouſnes in the obedience of Chriſt: as all Types whatſoever
appointed of God, are evidences of his minde, in that
whereof they are appointed to be Types. Now this Type, doth
ſhewe vs the minde of God: (as witneſſeth the Apoſtle plainly)
touching our righteouſnes in foure pointes.
               
                  
Firſt, that our righteouſnes ſhould proceede from one
man IESVS Chriſt: like as ſinne entered into the world by
one man Adam.
               Secondly, that our righteouſnes ſhould conſiſt, in the obedience
of that one man, like as our commune ſinfulnes, doth conſiſt
in the diſobedience of one man Adam.
               Thirdly, that our righteouſnes ſhould conſiſt, in one obedience
onely, of that one man Chriſt: like as our ſinfulnes doeth
conſiſt, in one onely diſobedience, of that one man Adam.
               Fourthly, that our righteouſnes ſhould conſiſt, in the onely
one obedience, of that one man, once onely performed: like
as our ſinfulnes, did conſiſt, in that onely one diſobedience, of
that one man Adam, once onely committed. Therefore ſayeth
the Apoſtle: As it is appointed vnto men, that they shall once die: ſo
Chriſt was once offered to take away the ſinnes of many, Heb. chapt.
9. verſ. 27. 28.
               Thus if God had given no other Type from the beginning:
Adam alone is ſufficient, to teach vs that GOD from
the beginning, did neither purpoſe, nor ordayne, nor ſet forth
Chriſt, to bee a propitiation vnto vs, in any thing, but in his
death and bloud.
               The ſecond grounde in holy Scripture, which proves this
aſſertion, to bee according to the minde of God: is the ſignes
and ſeales of the righteouſnes which is by faith. Which are,
Baptiſme, and the Lordes Supper. Which are called the ſignes and
ſeales of the righteouſnes which is by faith: becauſe they doe
firſt ſignifie and repreſent vnto vs, what is the righteouſnes it
ſelfe, whereby (being apprehended by faith) we are iuſtified.
and ſecondly, becauſe they ſeale and confirme vnto vs, that
righteouſnes is ours. ſo that they are appointed vnto vs of God,
as cleere documents of his minde, wherein wee may ſee and
perceyve moſt evidently, what is the matter and ſubſtance of
our righteouſnes before God.
               Now in them, nothing but water and the waſhing thereby:
and bread broken, and wine poured out with eating &amp; drinking
thereof, is ſet before vs, as either the ſignes or ſeales of our

righteouſnes. To teach vs, that our righteouſnes conſiſts in nothing,
but in Chriſts bloud ſhed, and ſprinkled vpon vs, and in
his body broken vpon the Croſſe, and his bloud communicated
vnto vs.
               But it is moſt certayne, that if there had bene any other thing
in his obedience: in which had conſiſted any part or portion of
our righteouſnes: he would likewiſe have left it, in the ſeales of
the covenant, to bee remembred of vs, and vſed by vs, for our
inſtruction and comfort. For nothing is to be eſteemed, to bee
any part or portion of our righteouſnes in Chriſt: wherof Chriſt
himſelfe hath inſtitute, neither ſigne nor ſeale.
               This ground is confirmed further vnto vs, by divers ſentences
of the holy Ghoſt, touching Baptiſme: which beeing anſwerable
vnto circumciſion, is moſt properly, both the ſigne and
ſeale of the righteouſnes which is by faith. In which ſentences,
Baptiſme is made to have referēce to no part of Chriſts obediēce
except vnto his death only. as is manifeſt Rom. chap. 6. verſ. 3.
Where it is ſaid, knowe yee not that all wee which have bene baptiſed into
Ieſus Chriſt, have bene Baptiſed into his death. Therefore alſo, this ſame
Apoſtle, 1 Cor. chap. 1. verſ. 13. taketh his argument from no
parte of Chriſts obedience, but his death only, and from Baptiſme
in the name of Chriſt, as the ſigne and ſeale of our righteouſnes,
in his death and ſuffering, to remove the ſchiſmes and
diviſions, that were amongſt the Corinthians, ſaying: Was Paul
crncified for you, or were ye Baptiſed in the name of Paul? For which cauſe
alſo, the Apoſtle to the Eph. chap. 5. verſ. 25. 26. 27. doth wholly
attribute the worke of our iuſtification &amp; purgation from ſinne,
vnto Chriſts giving himſelfe vnto the death for vs: the vertue
whereof, hee makes to bee applied vnto vs by the waſhing of
water, through the word. And this point is moſt cleere, by the
words of the Apoſtle Peter, who ſheweth the veritie hereof, in
the practiſe of God, towards his ſaints: both before the comming
of Chriſt and now after. For hee affirmeth that Noach and
theſe that were with him in the Arck, were ſaved by water: and
that now, we are ſaved by Baptiſme: as anſwering in analogie,
to the waters of the floud. Thereby expreſly teaching vs, that

from the beginning, Chriſt was crucified and ſet forth in nothing,
but in his death and bloud, to be the matter our righteouſnes,
as by the Apoſtle Peter in the ſame place (interpreting
the benefite that redounds vnto vs, by Baptiſme: or rather defining
what Baptiſme it ſelf is, whereby we are ſaved) may eaſily
be gathered: when he ſaith that this Baptiſme, is uot a putting away of
their filth of the flesh, but a confident demanding, which a good conſcience maketh
vnto God. 1 Epi. chap. 3. verſ. 20. and 21. Which diſcription is
nothing els in effect but iuſtification. Which the Apoſtle in another
place calleth, the purging of our conſciences from dead workes, Heb.
chap. 9. verſ. 14. and the ſprinkling of our harts from an evill conſcience,
Heb. chap. 10. verſ. 22. which by the Apoſtle Peter is diſcribed
from the effect, which is our acceſſe with confidence vnto God,
in calling vpon him as our Father, vpon the ſenſe and frelling
of the remiſſion of all our ſinnes in the bloud of Chriſt.
               This ſame alſo is manifeſt touchinn the other ſeale of the covenant:
which is the Supper of the Lord: by the wordes of
Chriſt himſelfe, Luke chap. 22. verſ. 19. 20. and of the Apoſtle,
1 Cor. chap. 11. verſ. 24. 25. where expounding his owne minde,
touching the bread and wine: he ſayeth, that the bread was his body
which was given, and as the Apoſtle ſayeth, which was broken for them,
and that the cup was the new Teſtament in his bloud, which was shed for
them, For Ieſus Chriſt fleſh and his bloud, are vnto vs no righteouſnes,
vntill his body be broken, and his bloud ſhed vpon the
croſſe for vs. For neither did hee deſtroy the Devill, but by his
death: nor ſet vs at libertie from our bondage, but by his death.
Heb. chap. 2. verſ. 14. 15. Neither did he put away our ſinnes, but
by the offering of himſelfe. Heb. chap. 9. verſ. 26. 28. And therefore
ſayeth Chriſt himſelfe, Ioh. chap. 12. verſ. 24. except the wheat
corne fall into the ground and die, it abydeth alone: but if it die, it bringeth
forth many fruite.
               
               Thus by the ſeales of the righteouſnes of faith, and by the
phraſe of the ſpirit concerning them, and by the teſtimonie of
Chriſt himſelfe, touching his owne death, it would evidently
appeare, that the matter of our righteouſnes, conſiſteth in no
parte of his obedience, proceeding his death: but conſiſteth

wholly in the onely one oblation of him ſelfe vppon the
croſſe.
               The third grounde in holy Scripture, confirminge this
pointe: is builded vpon the teſtimonie of Chriſt him ſelfe, and
the Apoſtles interpretation of his minde: ſett downe, Hebr.
chapt. 10. where firſt, out of the 40. Pſalme, the ſpeech of Chriſt
is cited: wherein hee declareth, what is the will of the Father,
touching the expiation of our ſinnes in him. Which is by
his obedience vnto the Father, in doeing his will. Which will
of the Father, is expounded by the Apoſtle in the 10, verſe, in
theſe wordes: By the which will, we are ſanctified: even by the offering of
the body of Ieſus Chriſt once.
               
               Now the obedience of Chriſt, in the matter of our righteouſnes,
is not to bee eſteemed of any larger extent, then is the
will of GOD which hee did obey, and by which wee are ſanctified.
Therefore ſeeing the will of GOD, in the matter of our
righteouſnes, is reſtrayned onely to the offeringe of Chriſt:
Surely his obedience, (as it is ſaide to make vs righteous) muſt
bee of no larger ſenſe, except we will be wiſe above that which
is written.
               If the Lordes owne interpretation, of his owne minde touchinge
his owne will, and obedience of his Sonne therevnto,
whereby wee are iuſtified, will not ſerve to ſatisfie mens
mindes: it is in vaine to labour, by any other meanes, to give
contentement to thoſe, who cannot be content with that which
God him ſelfe hath revealed touching this point. Whoſe minde,
muſt needes be beſt knowne to him ſelfe: and in the which, we
are to reſt according as it is revealed.
               And that this interpretation, ſet downe in this ſame place,
is the vndoubted mynde of God him ſelfe: it may evidentlie
appeare, by the cōſtant courſe of his ſpeech, ſet down thronghout
all the New Teſtament. In the which ſtill all the partes of
our Redemption, touching Iuſtification, Reconciliation, and
Sanctification: are ever attributed vnto the bloud of Chriſt
                     •
                  
vnto his death, and vnto his croſſe and ſacrifice of him ſelfe.

And the killinge of hatred, the blotting out of the hand-writinge
which was againſt vs: the removinge of the partition
wall, and aboliſhinge of all Principalities and Powers, and
all our ſpirituall enimies: is ſtill attributed vnto his croſſe.
And therefore, the whole worde of the Goſpell, is called the
worde or preachinge of the Croſſe, firſt Corinth. chapt. 1. verſ.
18.
               And the ſpeciall thinge which the Apoſtle reſpected, in
preaching nothinge but Chriſt, and him crucified: and why
Chriſt will not have the Goſpell preached, in wiſedome of
wordes, is: that the Croſſe of Chriſt, may not bee made of
none effect, 1. Corinth. chap. 1. verſ. 17. Which ſhould make vs
all, to take heed vnto our ſelves, in layinge downe any other
grounde, except the death of Chriſt: or ioyning any other thing
vnto the death of Chriſt, in the matter of our righteouſnes: leaſt
wee make his death and croſſe of none effect.
               The fourth grounde which ſeemeth cleerlie to confirme this
pointe, is, the argument which the Apoſtle vſeth, Hebr. chapter
10. ver. 18. conteyned in theſe wordes: VVhere there is remiſsion of
ſinnes, there is no more oblation for ſinne. By which argument, hee
both proveth, the ineffectuallnes of all the ſacrifices of the Law:
and the eternall vertue of the death of Chriſt, vnto the remiſſion
of ſinnes. By which argument of the Apoſtle, it ſeemeth
neceſſarilie to followe, that in nothing which is in Chriſt himſelfe,
before his death, conſiſteth the remiſſion of our ſinnes: and
ſo conſequentlie our righteouſnes. For where remiſſion of ſinnes
is, there is no more offeringe for ſinne. Therefore if in Chriſtes
actuall obedience, or in his habituall righteouſnes, there had
beene remiſſion of ſinnes, originall and actuall: (as it behoved
to bee, if they bee imputed to vs for righteouſnes) ſurely
the death of Chriſt is needleſſe. For to what ende ſhould
Chriſt have bene delivered to death, for our ſinnes, (as ſayeth
the Apoſtle Rom. chapt. 4. verſ. 25) or to what ende, ſhould hee
haue beene offered, for the takinge away of ſinne, (as hee is
ſaide to bee, Hebr. chap. 9. verſ. 26. 28.) if ſo be that all our

iniquities, both originall and actuall, be pardoned in his preceeding
actuall obediende. Surely it ſeemeth that this opinion
would have made Chriſt to die without a cauſe. For where it is
aledged, that he was offred to remove the puniſhment of our
ſinne, it ſeemeth to conteyne a double contradiction to Gods
truth. For firſt, it is manifeſt by the Scriptures, that he was offred
not only to deliver vs from the curſe and puniſhment, but alſo
from ſinne it ſelfe.
               Secondly, it ſeemeth to impugne the iuſtice and righteouſnes
of God: who never puniſheth where guiltines is taken away.
For death is the reward of ſinne. Therefore where ſinnes
are removed, death can not bee inflicted. For where there is no
ſinne, there is no death. And therefore ſayeth the ſpirit of God:
that where remiſſion of ſinnes is, there is no more ſacrifice for
ſinne. According to which ſaying: either Chriſts death and ſuffring
vpon the croſſe, is no ſacrifice for ſinne: or then there was
no remiſſion of ſinne before: either in his habituall righteouſnes,
or actuall obedience, or any other thing whatſoever.
               Thus the very offring of Chriſt for ſinne, ſecludes all things
preceeding whatſoever, from all vertue or efficacie of purging
ſinne, and removing of iniquitie. For as witneſſeth the ſame Apoſtle,
Heb. chap. 10. verſ. 2. 3. Where there is a new remembrance, againe
of ſinnes, they have never bene formerly taken away. An therefore,
ſeeing in Chriſts death, there is a new remembrance of ſinnes againe:
it cannot bee, that they were ever taken away, by any
thing, preceeding his death. For otherwiſe, Chriſt ſhould not
have bene offred: Becauſe that the offerers beeing once purged, have from
that tyme forth, no more conſcience of ſinnes, Heb. chap. 10. verſ. 2.
               The firſt ground, which ſerveth to cleere this point, is ſet
downe by 1. Ep. Ioh. chap. 1. verſ. 7. where he ſayth, that the bloud of
Ieſus Chriſt, purgeth vs from all ſinne: which wordes importe playnlie,
that it is a needles and vnneſſeccary thing, to adde any thing
to the death of Chriſt, in the matter of our righteouſnes. For if
it alone, performe the whol worke of our iuſtification: it is an
idle curioſitie, and a fruitles contention, when men contend for
any other thing, to bee ioyned in this worke, with it. But theſe

wordes of the Apoſtle doe plainly manifeſt, that the bloud of
Chriſt alone, accompliſheth our iuſtification. For whatſoever
purgeth vs from all ſinne, muſt needes accompliſh our righteouſnes,
and fully iuſtifie vs, both from originall and actuall
ſinne. therefore it muſt needes holde, that in his bloud conſiſteth
the full matter of our righteouſnes. For nothing, that contayneth
not full and perfect righteouſnes, can poſſibly cleanſe
vs from all ſinne.
               Moreover, by this ſentence of Iohn, it would appeare that the
opinion of thoſe men, who put a difference, betwixt an innocent
man and a iuſt man: hath no ſoliditie at all: nor any warrant
in Gods trueth: if we compare the ſaide ſentence, with the
wordes of David, Pſalm. 32. repeated by the Apoſtle, Rom. 4. in the
which, The man whoſe ſinnes are pardoned, is pronounced to be bleſsed.
By which wordes it is manifeſt, that vnto eternall bleſſednes,
it is ſufficient, to have remiſſion of ſinnes: which could not be
true, if after remiſſion of ſinnes (which is alleadged to be by imputatiō
of Chriſtes actuall obediēce, and fulfilling of the Lawe)
men ſhould yet be in dāger of puniſhment, vntill Chriſt did die
for thē. For hovv can he be bleſſed that ſtill is liable to puniſhment,
&amp; vnder the ſentence of death. Therefore, either remiſſion
of ſinnes, maketh not a man bleſſed, or then remiſſion of ſinnes
muſt onely cōſiſt in the bloud of Chriſt. ſeeing, as ſaith the Apoſt.
Heb. ch. 2. ver. 15. we are not delivered from the feare of death,
but by the death of Chriſt only, by whoſe ſtripes onely wee are
healed.
               By the ſame reaſon it is evident, that by Chriſts actual obedience,
there can be no remiſſion of ſinnes: ſeeing in the cōfeſſion
of thoſe, that are of that opinion, by that obedience, men are not
exempt from puniſhment: and ſo cannot be ſaid to be bleſſed.
               Beſides, this opinion doth flatly contradict the trueth. For
the Scriptures placeth righteouſnes in the remiſſion of ſinnes:
and vnto life, it requireth no more but righteouſnes. For the iuſt
by faith shall live.
               
               Moreeover, innocencie before God, cannot preceede righteouſnes.
For as the Lord holdeth not the wicked innocent, ſo by

the contrarie, he holdeth him that is righteous, to be innocent
therefore, betwixt a ſinner and a iuſt man, there can be no mid,
dell eſtate and condition of a man, before God. Except we will
place a middeſt, betwixt righteouſnes &amp; ſinne: and a middell
condition, betwixt heaven and hell, in the world to come. For
as heaven is for iuſt men, and hell for wicked men: the ſame
iuſtice of God requireth, that there bee a middell condition, for
ſuch as are betwixt both: ſeeing they are neither in the ſtate of
the iuſt, nor of the wicked. Men doe not ſee, what a foundation
this opinion layeth, for eſtabliſhinge the Papiſtes Limbus Patrum,
and vainely invented Purgatorie. Furthermore, this opinion
ſeemeth to imply a contradiction in it ſelfe.
               For firſt, it affirmeth, that the actuall obedience of Chriſt, is
imputed vnto vs as righteouſnes: and yet they holde that it
doth not iuſtifie vs from puniſhment.
               Secondly, they confeſſe that it maketh vs innocent, and yet
denie that it maketh vs iuſt. Which are thinges impoſſible. For
whatſoever is imputed as righteouſnes, muſt iuſtifie vs, and
whatſoever maketh vs innocent, muſt neceſſarily make vs iuſt.
For nothing, but righteouſnes, can make a man innocent before
God.
               Therefore, ſeeing that ſentence of Iohn, aſſcribeth the purging
of all ſinne to the bloud of Chriſt: be it originall, or arctuall,
it is the ſafeſt way for vs, (being warranted by the H. Ghoſt)
to accompt it, onely the matter of our righteouſnes: and to beware,
of adding any thing too it, Whereof we have not the like
expreſſe warrant.
               And to make this ground yet more ſure: we are to cōſider the
nature of the death and ſuffering of Chriſt. Which is manifeſt by
the wordes of Chriſt him ſelfe, Math. cha. 20. ver. 28. Marke cha.
10. ver. 45. where he ſayeth: The ſonne of man is not come to bee ſerved,
but to ſerve, and to give his live a ranſome for many: therefore was he called
Ieſus, becauſe he ſaved vs from our ſinnes. And for the ſame
cauſe, we are ſaide, in his bloud to have redemption, and by the
bloud of his croſſe to be reconciled vnto God. And for this ſame
cauſe, the Lord is ſaid to have ſet him foorth, a propitiation for

ſinne, in his bloud: and to have wounded him, for our tranſgreſſions:
to have broken him for our iniquities: and to have made
him, ſinne and a curſe for vs. All which phraſes import three
thinges. The I. is, that Chriſt did pay by his death, a price for
vs, to ſet vs at libertie from ſinne. The II. is, that by his death
he reconciled vs vnto God, removing his wrath frō vs. The III.
is, that God did execute vpon him, in his death, the iudgement
due to vs, for our iniquities. therefore is hee ſaide, not to have
ſpared his owne ſonne. Vpon the which it followeth, that both
the whole price of our Redemption, the whole matter of our
peace, and the whoie ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, conſiſteth in the
death of Chriſt. and ſo conſequently of our full righteouſnes.
               Now, as we have ſaid before, the iudgemēt of God is alwayes
according to truth, ſo that in wounding his ſonne for our tranſgreſſions,
he behoved to have chaſtiſed him, in proportion and
meaſure, anſwerable to all our iniquities. So that this ſatisfaction,
by his death, being layde in ballance, with the perfect obedience
of the Law, required of vs: it behoved, in the iuſtice of
God, to be of equal waight with it: and no leſſe able, fully to anſwere,
the iuſtice of God: then the full obedience of the Lawe.
For the onely iuſt GOD, and Iudge of all the worlde, can not
ordayne a puniſhment and ſatisfaction to his iuſtice for ſinne,
neither execute it, in greater or leſſer meaſure or proportion of
iuſtice, then the fault required.
               Hereof it muſt follow: ſeeing Chriſtes death &amp; bloud, is the
chaſtiſement of our peace, &amp; puniſhmēt inflicted of God, for the
ſinnes of his elect: it muſt contayne in it, as full iuſtice &amp; righteouſnes,
as the full accompliſhment: of the Lawe by vs, ſhould
have done. therefore ſaith Ioh. That the bloud of Ieſus, purgeth vs from
all iniquities. to teach vs, that his bloud being imputed vnto vs, as
our righteouſnes, by God: doth put vs in the ſame eſtate &amp; caſe,
(touching righteouſnes vnto life, before God) wherin we ſhould
have bene, if we had performed the condition of the law. which
is, do this, &amp; thou ſhalt live: and therfore, it being equivalent in
the iuſtice of God to that which was required of vs, vnto life: it
is in vaine to adde anything vnto it, vnto perfect righteouſnes.
               This ſame is alſo cleere, by the Apoſtles ſpeech, Rom. cha. 3.
ver. 25. when he ſheweth, that God did ſet foorth Chriſt, a propitiation

in his bloud: to ſhew his righteouſnes: to this end, that
he might be iuſt. For heere two thinges are to be obſerved, ſerving
to this purpoſe. The firſt is, that only in the bloud of Ieſus,
the righteouſnes of God, whereby we are iuſtified, is to be ſeene.
The ſecond is, that by the ſight thereof, God is knowne to bee
iuſt, in ſparing his elect, and iuſtifying them freely, by the redemptiō that is in Chriſt. Wherevpon it muſt follow, that Chriſt
in his death muſt have, in moſt full and perfect manner, anſwered
the iuſtice of God: no leſſe, then our full and perfect obedience,
ſhould have done. otherwiſe, it could never have ſhewen
the righteouſnes of God: neither could he have bene manifeſted
iuſt, in iuſtifying vs thereby.
               For the Law of God, is fulfilled: and the righteouſnes or iuſtice
of God therein required, is accompliſhed two manner of
wayes. that is, eyther by doeing all thinges commanded therein:
or els, by ſuffering ſuch puniſhment, as in the iuſtice of God
(for the tranſgreſſion thereof) is in iuſt proportion anſwerable
therevnto. ſo that, in eyther of theſe fully finiſhed, the iuſtice of
God, vnto eternall life, is anſwered.
               The ſixt ground, is builded vpon the lawe of the Prieſthood,
which was ordayned particularly of God, for this end, to make
expiation of our ſinnes, and bring vs vnto God. Which two benefites,
were ſhadowed in two actions, of the Lev
                        •
                     ticall high
Prieſt, in the day of expiation. The firſt was, in offering ſacrifice
for the peoples ſinnes, and ſprinkeling the bloud thereof, before
the Lord. The ſecond was, the carying of the names, of the
Tribes of the Lord, into the Sanctuarie, ingraven in the two
ſtones vpon his ſhoulders, and twelve vpon his breſt: for a remembrance
continually before the Lord, Exod. 28.
               Now the Law of this Prieſthood is, that none performe this
office, before the 30. yere of his age. as is manifeſt, Nomb 4. where
all, that enter in the aſſemble, to doe the worke, in the tabernacle
of the congregation, are commanded to bee nombred, from
30. yeare olde and above vntill 50. according to which lawe,
Chriſt him ſeife, who was the ſubſtance of all thoſe ſhadowes,
did not enter in that office, vntill hee began the thirtie yeare of

his age. as is cleere, Luke chap. 3. verſ. 21.
               Heereof it muſt followe, that no action, performed by Chriſt
before that time, can be accompted the action of expiation of
ſinne, or reconciliation of vs vnto God. therefore the Scripture
attributeth our redemption, and reconciliation, and particularlie
our iuſtification, to no action preceeding: but to his death,
thereafter following. and the action of bringing vs vnto God, is
particularie aſſcribed by the Apoſtle Peter, vnto the death of
Chriſt, 1. Epi. chap. 3. verſ. 18. And the Apoſtle declareth, that our
lib
                     •
                  rtie to enter into the moſt holy place, that is, to come vnto
God, proceedeth from the bloud of Ieſus, Hebr. chap. 10. ver. 19.
which ſummarily ſeemeth to be expreſſed by the Apoſtle in that
ſaying, Hebr. chap. 5. ver. 9. And being conſecrate, he was made the Authour
of eternall ſalavtion, &amp;c. By which ſaying, it is manifeſt, that
Chriſt is not the Authour of righteouſnes, or life to vs but by his
conſecration: that is by his death. For therein did his conſecration
conſiſt. as is manifeſt, Hebr. chap. 2. verſ. 10. and therefore
is he ſaid, Hebr. chap. 10. ver. 14. to have conſecrate vs for ever
by that one offering, wherein conſiſted his owne conſecration.
And for this ſame cauſe is it, that the Apoſtle, Hebr. chap. 9. 17.
ſayeth, That the Covenant, or Teſtament is coufirmed when men are dead,
and that it is yet of no force as longe as he that made it is alive. Thereby evidently
witneſſing, that no bleſſing promiſed of God, in the
covenant of grace, is made ours: but by the death of Chriſt. So
that whatſoever went before his death, could no wiſe make the
Covenant of God, of any force or effect vnto vs.
               Thus, neither in reſpect of tyme, aſſigned of God vnto the
Prieſtes, for entring into their office: neither in reſpect of the
Prieſtlie actions, ordayned to bee accompliſhed by them for
reconciliation of the people, and expiation of ſinne: can any
thing in Chriſt, before the 30. yeare of his age, bee accompted a
Prieſtlie action of expiation: neither any action after, except
onely the offering of him ſelfe, and enteringe with his owne
bloud, into the heavens for vs all, whoſe names hee carried in
that action, before the Lorde: &amp; whom, by vertue of his bloud,
he bringeth vnto God.
               
                  
Thus have we ſhewed ſuch things, as in the worde of God,
doe ſeeme to exclude all things, from the matter of our righteouſnes,
except the blood and death of Chriſt alone: Of which
opinion, it appeareth evidently, that Calvin was: if his minde
bee wel marked, in his owne writings, in the third book of his
inſtitutions. Chap. 11. Secti. 4. 11. 21. 22. Where 4. things are expreſlie
ſet down by him, making all to this purpoſe.
               The 1. is, That righteouſnes, is ſimplie oppoſed vnto guiltines.
The 2. is, That he affirmeth the manner of our reconciliation,
to be expreſſed in the words of the Apoſtle, when he ſaith,
That Chriſt, who knew no ſinne, was made ſinne for vs. 2. Cor. 5. 21.
               The 3. is, That in that place, he affirmeth reconciliation, to
ſignifie nothing but iuſtification. The 4. is, Touching the place
of David, Pſal. 32. cited by the Apoſtle. Rom. 4. In the which
he plainiy affirmeth, that neither David, nor the Apoſtle, doeth
ſpeake of one parte only of our iuſtification, but of the whole.
And therfore addeth, that ſeeing the bleſſednes of a man (which
hee taketh to ſignifie righteouſnes) is ſaid by the Prophet and
Apoſtle, to conſiſt in remiſſion of ſinnes: there is no reaſon why
we ſhould define it otherwiſe. By which ſentence, hee plainly
cuts away the ground of theſe men, whereon they build their
evaſion, When they are vrged out of that and ſuch other places,
to acknowledge, that full righteouſnes, conſiſts in remiſſion of
ſinnes only. For to maintayne the imputation of Chriſts, actuall
obedience, they alledge, that vnto eternal life, it is not ſufficient,
to have all iniquitie pardoned. That is, (as they interprete it) to
be innocent: but that it is requiſit, beſide the remiſſion of ſinnes,
to have righteouſnes. which they accompt to come, by the imputation
of Chriſt actuall obedience. Therfore when theſe places
are aledged, wherein bleſſednes and iuſtification is only attributed
to the death of Chriſt, and only placed in remiſſion of
ſinnes: they anſwere, that theſe places are ſynecdochically to be
vnderſtood. As though a parte of righteouſnes, were put for the
whole: in which, Calvin ſheweth himſelfe plainly to diſagree
from them: by affirming the direct contrary. Thus, they who
ſeeme to be followers of Calvin in this point, are deceyved.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               NOW it followeth, that we ſpeake of theſe things, which
are required in Chriſt, to the end, that in his bloud, hee
may be righteouſnes vnto vs. For, albeit without ſhedding
of bloud, there be no remiſſion of ſinnes: yet many things
are required, both in the bloud that is ſhed, and in the action of
ſhedding it: before it can ſerve vnto the remiſſion of ſinnes.
               Firſt them, to ſpeake of the bloud: it muſt needes bee better
then the bloud of Goats, of Lambes, of Bullocks, or all the ſacrifices
of the Law. For although, the ſimilitude of heavenly
things bee purified with the bloud of ſuch ſacrifices: yet heavenly
thinges them ſelves, muſt be purified, with greater and
better ſacrifices then theſe, Hebr. chap. 9. verſ. 23. and that becauſe
the bloud of thoſe ſacrifices, which were offered according
to the Lawe, can never make holy, concerning the conſcience,
him that doeth the ſervice.
               To trie then what bloud it muſt bee. Firſt, the bloud of a
man, is better then the bloud of a beaſt. and that it muſt bee the
bloud of a man, it is cleere by the holy ſcripture: For he which ſanctified.
and they which are ſanctiſſed, must be all of one, Heb. chap. 2. 11.
And as by one man ſinne entered into the worlde, ſo by one
man, rigreouſnes is brought in the world: therefore is it ſaide,
that IESVS for a little ſpace, was made lower then the Angels,
that by the grace of God he might taſte of death for vs all, Hebr.
chap. 2. ver. 9. for, the iuſtice of God requireth, that ſinne be puniſhed
in that nature, that hath committed it.
               But yet this is not ſufficient, to make that bloud that is ſhed,
righteouſnes vnto vs. For the bloud of a ſinner cā never recōcile
a ſinner vnto God and he that hath need, to offer ſacrifice for his
owne ſin, cā never by his bloud, purge any other man frō ſinne.
therfore it is requiſit, not only that it be the bloud of a man: but
moreover, that it be the bloud of a iuſt mā: in whom there is no
iniquitie. And this is declared plainly by the types of the law:
in the which, no vncleane thing could be offred for ſinne: neither
behoved there to bee ſpott or wrinckle, or blemiſh in the
Lambe: as is cleerly ſeene in the commaundement of God,

                  Levit. chap. 22. ver. 20. Yee shall not offer any thing that hath a blemish, for
that shall not bee acceptable for you. According to which lawe, it is
ſaid of Chriſt, that he offered vp him ſelfe without fault vnto
God, Heb, chap. 9. verſ. 14. And the Apoſtle Peter ſayeth, That
Christ ſuffered once for ſinne, the iuſt for the vniuſt, 1. Epiſt. chap. 3. ver. 18
And againe, That we are redeemed by the precious bloud of Ieſus Christ, as
of a Lambe vndefiled and without ſpot.
               
               Neither is this yet ſufficient, to make the bloud that is ſhed, to
be righteouſnes before God, but more is required in it, then that
it be the bloud of a man, or yet of a iuſt man. For no man, that
is nothing more but a man, can poſſibly redeeme his brother: or
give his ranſome to God: that he may live ſtill for ever. So precious
is the redemption of their ſoules and the continuance for ever, ſayeth the
Prophet, Pſalm. 49. For the bloud of no fleſh, can be able to ſatiſfie
the infinite iuſtice of God. For he that liveth not for ever, can
never be the cauſe of eternall life vnto others. and he that is not
eternall, can never bring in, eternall righteouſnes. and no righteouſnes,
but that which is eternall, can poſſibly procure eternall
life. For, all being infinit, that is, the iuſtice that wee have
tranſgreſſed infinit: our guiltines in traſgreſſing infinite: the puniſhment
of our guiltines infinite: as being the iuſt recompence
of the tranſgreſſion of an infinit iuſtice: proceeding from the iuſt
iudgement, of an infinit God: it is impoſſible, that a finit creature,
can performe it: ſeeing he ſhould never be able to looſe the
ſorrowes of death. Therefore it is required, that the bloude
ſhould be the bloud of him, who is eternall: to the end, that hee
ſhould not be holden of death eternally, Act. chap. 2. verſ. 24. and
that his bloud, might be of an infinite value, and that our righteouſnes
might be eternall, and make vs eternally righteous:
therefore is it ſaide by the Apoſtle, that God hath purchaſed his
Church with his owne bloud, Act. chap. 20. 28. thus, it is required
in the bloud, that iuſtifieth vs before God, that it bee not
onely the bloud of a man, and of a iuſt man, but alſo that it bee
the bloud of him who is God bleſſed for ever. and all theſe conſiderations
are neceſſarilie requiſit in the bloud vnto our iuſtification
thereby.
               
                  
And as in the bloud, ſo in the ſhedding of it, divers things are
required in it, to the ſame end. Which that wee may the more
cleerely perceyve, we are firſt to conſider, that the ſhedding of
bloud, muſt needes be by way of oblation and ſacrifice. Therefore
Chriſt is ſaide to have offered vp him ſelfe, a ſacrifice, of a
ſweet ſmelling favour vnto God, Ephe. chap. 5. verſ. 2. and alſo
he is ſaid to have bin made manifeſt once, to put awy ſinnes, by
the ſacrificing of him ſelfe, Heb. chapt. 9. verſ. 26. and therefore
alſo ſaith the Apoſtle, that Chriſt our Paſſeover, is ſacrificed for
vs, 1. Cor. chap. 5. ver. 7.
               Now, the things requiſite in the offering of this ſacrifice, are
partlie to be conſidered, in the nature of the ſacrifice it ſelfe, and
partly in thoſe thinges which are neceſſarilie required, for the
offering of a ſacrifice.
               Touching the ſacrifice it ſelfe, beſides that it muſt bee by
bloud: becauſe without ſhedding of bloud, there is no remiſſion.
it muſt needes be but one: and of ſuch nature, as never needeth
to be repeated. For the ſacrifices that are oft repeated, can never
ſanctifie the commers therevnto. And therefore it is ſaid, That we are
ſanctified by the offering of the body of Ieſus Christ once, Heb. chap. 10. ver.
10. And againe, in that ſame Chap. verſe 12. it is ſaid: But hee having
offered by one ſacrifice for ſinne, ſitteth for ever at the right hand of God,
Of which it is manifeſt, that this ſacrifice alone, without anie
other thing ioyned therewith, and without anie iterating of it,
(contrarie to the blaſphemous doctrine of the papiſtes) muſt
needs make vs eternally righteous. according to which it is ſaid
by the Apoſtle: That Chriſt is entered into heaven, not that hee should offer
him ſelfe often: becauſe then it behooved him to die often. But as it is appointed
that men once die, and thereafter commeth the iudgement, even ſo
Chriſt alſo being once offered, to take away the ſinnes of many, hee shall appeare
the ſecond tyme without ſinne &amp;c▪
                   And this point is moſt cleerlie
ſet downe, Heb. cha. 10. ver. 14. where it is ſaid: For by one offering,
he hath conſecrated for evermore, thoſe which are ſanctified. Wherevpon
it muſt followe, ſeeing by one offering hee hath obtayned
vs eternal remiſſion (according to the promiſe of God in his covenant:
and their finnes and their iniquities I will never remēber anie more)
                  
that there remayneth no more ſacrifices for ſinne. For according
to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, VVhere remiſsion of ſinnes is, there is no
more ſacrifice for ſinne, Heb. chap. 10. verſ. 18.
               The thinges that are required for the offering of a propitiatorie
ſacrifice for ſinne, are eſpecially three. The firſt is a Prieſt.
For none but a conſecrate Prieſt, appointed by God and not
by man, might ever offer ſacrifice for ſinne vnto God.
               The ſecond is the Altar, vpon which it muſt bee offered.
               The third is the Tabernacle or Sanctuarie, wherein it muſt
be offered.
               The thinges to be conſidered in the Prieſt: concerne partly
the nature of the Prieſthood it ſelfe: and partly the actions to be
performed by the Prieſt.
               Touching the nature of the Prieſthood: The firſt thing to be
conſidered, is that no man can take this office to him ſelfe: but
he who is called of God, Heb. cap. 5. ver. 4. 5. The ſecond thing
to be conſidered, is, that it muſt not bee according to the order
of Aaron, but according to the order of Melchiſedeck. For there is
no perfection by the Levitical Prieſthood, Hebr. chap. 7. ver. 11.
and this, that he muſt bee according to the order of Melchiſedeck,
comprehendeth vnder it theſe particular pointes. Firſt, that he
is not made a Prieſt by the Lawe, but according to the power
of endleſſe life. For as we have ſaide, if his Prieſthood had bene
after the Lawe, it could never have made vs perfect. For the
Lawe made nothing perfect, Hebr. chap. 7. ver. 19. And of this ground,
followeth other two conſequences. The firſt is, that ſeeing hee
is made a Prieſt, after the power of endleſſe life, none ſave hee
alone, can ever enioye this Prieſthood. For, as ſayeth the Apoſtle:
Amongeſt the Leviticall Prieſtes, many were made Priestes: becauſe
ther were not ſuffered to endure, by reaſon of death: but Chriſt, becauſe hee
endureth for ever, hath a Prieſthood which can not paſſe from him to an other,
Hebr chap. 7. ver. 23. 24. The ſeconde conſequence, is, as
ſaveth the Apoſtle, Hebr. chap. 7. ver. 25. That hee is able perfectly to
ſave thoſe that come to God by him: ſeeing hee ever liveth to make interceſsion
for them.
               
               
                  The third thing to bee conſidered in the nature of the Prieſt

is, as ſayeth the ſame Apoſtle, That he bee without ſinne: becauſe
ſuch a High Prieſt, it became vs to have, as is holy, harmeles, vndefyled,
and ſeperate from ſinners, Hebr. chapt. 7. 26. Which alſo was
expreſlie commanded in the Lawe, Levit. chap. 21. where it is
ſaide: VVho ſoever of the ſeede of Aaron, hath any blemish, hee shall
not come neare to offer the ſacrifices of the Lorde: neither shall he preſſe
to offer the bread of his God: neither shall he goe in vnto the vayle, nor come
neare the Altar: leaſt he pollute my Sanctuarie.
               The fourth thing to be marked in the Prieſt, is, that hee muſt
not be vpon the earth. For if hee were vpon the earth, hee were not
a Prieſt, Heb chap. 8. verſ 4.
               
                  Therefore is it ſaide of him: After that hee had offered one ſacrifice
for ſinne, he ſitteth for ever at the right hande of God, Hebr. chapt. 10.
ver. 13. as alſo, That the heavens must conteyne him vnto the tyme that all
things be reſtored, Act. chap. 3. ver. 21.
               The fift thing to be conſidered in the Prieſt, is, that he behooved
to be ſubiect to infirmities. that having experience of them,
he might be a mercifull and faithfull high Prieſt, Hebr. chap. 2.
ver. 17. and chap. 4. ver. 15.
               Nowe wee come to the actions to bee performed by the
Prieſtes. Which likewiſe are of two ſortes. The firſte ſorte are
thoſe, which are performed in offering of the ſacrifice. The ſeconde ſorte is, thoſe which are to be performed, after the oblation.
               In the Sacrifice eſpecially is to bee conſidered. Firſt, the
Prieſtes puttinge all our iniquities and ſinues vpon the head
of the offeringe: that hee may beare them all. Accordinge to
which it is ſaide of Chriſt, That hee bare the ſinne of many, Eſay 53.
12. And the Apoſtle Peter ſayeth: That he him ſelfe did beare our
ſinnes in his body, vpon the tree. For he was made ſinne for vs. The
ſecond action conſiſteth in killing of the offering before the
Lord. according to which, it is ſaide of Chriſt, That hee offered vp
him ſelfe by the eternall ſpirit vnto God. Hebr. 9. 14. And he is ſaide
to put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of him ſelfe, Hebr. 9. 26. And
Chriſt him ſelfe ſaieth, I lay downe my life, that I might take it againe,

no man taketh it from me, but I lay it downe of my ſelfe, Iohn chapt. 10.
verſ. 17. 18. According to which alſo Eſay ſaith, That he p
                        •
                     wred out
his ſoule vnto death. Chap. 53. ver. 12.
               The third action is, the offering of the ſacrifice it ſelfe, by fire
vnto the Lord. And al theſe actions are accōpliſhed in the death
of Chriſt. in the which principally conſiſteth the matter of our
righteouſnes. for therein was hee made both ſinne and a curſe
for vs.
               The actions following, are eſpecially three. which all ſerve
to our iuſtification by his death and bloud: although they be no
parte nor portion of the righteouſnes it ſelfe. The firſt is, his riſing
from the dead. The ſecond is, his ſitting at the right hande
of God in heaven. The third is, his making interceſſion for vs.
Therefore the Apoſtle, in the 8. chap. to the Rom. ver. 34. ſetteth
downe theſe foure actions of Chriſt, as the things whereby wee
are ſaved from all condempnation. when he ſayth: VVho shall condemne,
it is Chriſt that hath died, or rather, who is riſen againe: who alſo is
at the right hande of God: and who alſo maketh interceſsion for vs. Which
ſaying is carefully to bee marked of vs, for many waightie reaſons.
Firſt, it ſheweth vs that as the worke of God in iuſtifying
vs, doth ſave vs from all accuſation: ſo the groundes whereby
we are ſaved from being condemned, of God, (that is by which
we are iuſtified and abſolved) are theſe foure actions of Chriſt:
whereof his death is firſt. Secondly, it cleareth that point which
we have in hande: to wit, that many things ſerve to our iuſtification,
which are no parte of our righteouſnes. For his reſurrection,
his aſcending into heaven, and ſitting at the right hande
of God, and his interceding for vs: are all neceſſarily required
to our iuſtification: and yet none of them is any parte of the
matter of that righteouſnes, which is imputed vnto vs. For his
ryſinge from the dead, is not our righteouſnes, and yet except
he had riſen, we could not have bin iuſtified by his death. according
to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. chap. 15. ver. 17. If Chriſt
be not rayſed, your faith is vaine, ye are yet in your ſinnes. For ſo longe as
Chriſt was holden of death, vnder the guiltines of our ſinnes,
we could never be abſolved from ſinne &amp; death, in the ſight of

God. becauſe, our ſatisfaction and redemption (although they
were in doeing) were not fully performed, vntill Chriſt having
vtterly aboliſhed ſinne, was rayſed from the dead. but his ſuffering
beeing finiſhed, and hee having looſed the ſorrowes of
death, our redemption and ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, were fullie
accompliſhed: and ſo our righteouſnes, full and compleate
in Gods ſight. By the imputation whereof, GOD then, might
iuſtly iuſtifie vs. Therefore is it ſaid by the Apoſtle, Rom. chap.
4. 25. that he was delivered to death for our tranſgreſsions, and is riſen againe
for our iustification: Shewing vs, that as the matter of our
righteouſnes conſiſteth in Chriſtes death, (becauſe he was delivered
therevnto, for our ſinnes) ſo the iuſtification of vs by his
death, dependeth vpon his reſurrection. becauſe therein, his
death was ended: and ſo the ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, and our
righteouſnes was fully and perfectly finiſhed.
               Likewiſe, his entring into heaven, and ſitting at the right
hande of God: is no parte of the matter of our righteouſnes: and
yet it is a neceſſarie action of his Prieſtlie office, required vnto
our iuſtification by that, which is our righteouſnes. For the
high Prieſt once a yeare in the day of expiation, entered into the
moſt holy place, with the bloud of the expiatorie ſacrifice: to
make an attonement for the children of Iſrael. The true ſanctuarie,
reſembled by the moſt holy place, is heaven: into which
the bloud of our ſacrifice, muſt be brought by Ieſus Chriſt our
high Prieſt: there to make our attonement. Therefore is it ſaid,
That Chriſt being come a High Prieſt of good thinges to come: entered once
by his owne bloud in the moſt holy place, and obtayned eternall redemption,
Hebr. chap. 9. ver. 11. 12. and therefore alſo is it ſaide, That if hee
were on the earth, he were not a Prieſt, Heb. chap. 8. verſ. 4. For which
cauſe, in that ſame place, the Apoſtle eſteemeth this, to bee the
chieff and principall point, of all that had bene ſpoken of his
Prieſthood: videlicet, that we have ſuch a high Prieſt, that ſitteth at
the right hande of the throne of the maieſtie in heaven, &amp;c.
               
               Thus howſoever the ſacrifice of Chriſt in his death, or his
bloud: be the matter of our righteouſnes, and that Chriſt in his
bloud, be ordayned a propitiation for vs: yet, to the iuſtifying vs

by that bloud, this action of our High Prieſt, even the entring
with the bloud into heaven, is neceſſarily required.
               Even ſo alſo concerning his interceſſion. albeit it bee not
the matter of our righteouſnes: yet it ſerveth to our iuſtification
by his blood. For all his interceſſion, is by vertue thereof:
that God by it, and for it, may pardon all our iniquities, and iuſtifie
vs. For this action, is the end of the three former: that is, of
his death, reſurrection, and aſcending into heaven. For he died,
that by his death and ſufferinge, havinge ſatisfied the iuſtice of
God, for all our iniquities, he might have a ſufficient ground
and matter whereby to make interceſſion.
               And he roſe again. thereby putting an end to his owne death
and ſuffering: that the ſatisfaction being finiſhed, &amp; the ranſome
fully payed: it might be anſwerable to the iuſtice of God: and be
ſufficient for our iuſtification. And he aſcended vp to heaven, as
vnto the true Sanctuarie: that he might bring into the preſence
of God, the bloud of our ſacrifice: and there, (as the miniſter of
the Sanctuarie, by his death, as the ranſome of our iniquities,
now full and perfect by his reſurrection, and brought in by him,
as our high Prieſt into heaven, and preſented vnto God) might
make interceſſion for vs. And as ſaith the Apoſtle, obtayne eternall
redemption for vs, Heb. 9. 12. Therefore is it ſaide of him, in that
ſame Chap. ver. 24. that Chriſt is not entered into the holy places made
with handes, which are ſimilitudes of the true holy places: but vnto heaven it
ſelfe, to appeare now in the ſight of God for vs. And to this ſame effect
Iohn the 1. Epi, cap. 2. ver. 1. it is ſaid, If any man ſinne, wee have an
Advocate with the Father Ieſus Chriſt the iuſt, and he him ſelfe is the propitiation
of our ſinnes.
               
               And ſo to conclude this point Chriſts being a Prieſt: &amp; many
actions done by him, as our high Prieſt: are no part of the matter
of our righteouſnes. and yet it is requiſit, that he both be a Prieſt,
&amp; performe thoſe actions, to our iuſtification: even as the Prieſts
vnder the Lawe, were no parte of the attonement. For hee that
makes the attonement, and the actions done by him, in making
the attonement, are to be diſtinguiſhed from the bloud, in the
which only ſtandeth the attonement it ſelfe.
               
                  
Now we come to ſpeake of the Altar. which likewiſe is neceſſarily
required, for offering of our ſacrifice, and yet is no parte of
our righteouſnes, but ſerveth to the qualification of the ſacrifice,
to be righetouſnes vnto vs. And as Chriſt is the Prieſt, and
alſo the offering: ſo alſo, he alone is the Altar. Which we ſhall
eaſilie perceyve, if we marke theſe two groundes. Firſt, what is
the nature of our Prieſt, and of the ſacrifice that hee doeth offer,
and of the Sanctuarie and Tabernacle wherein hee muſt exerciſe
his Prieſthood: and of the things which by this ſacrifice are
purged. Secondly, if we conſider the vſe of the Altar, wherevnto
it ſerveth in ſacrificing.
               Touching the firſt, all are heavenly. The P
                     •
                  ieſt, the Lord from
heaven. the ſacrifice, heavenly: the ſanctuarie, heaven it ſelf: the
the tabernacle, his body not pight by man but by God: and the
things that are to be purged, all heavenly, Heb. 9. 11. 23. 24, Of
which it muſt follow, that the Altar alſo muſt be heavēly. For a
heavenly ſacrifice, offered by a heavenly Prieſt, in a heavenly tabernacle,
for the purging of heavenly thinges, can not poſſibly
bee offered, but vpon a heavenly Altar.
               This is manifeſt by the ſecond point, which is touching the vſe
of the Altar, &amp; that is to ſanctifie the offring: as is manifeſt by the
words of Chriſt, Mat. 23 19. of which it followeth: according to
Chriſts reaſoning in that place: that the Altar muſt bee greater
then the offering. For that which ſanctifieth, muſt be greater thē
that which is ſanctified by it. Of which it is manifeſt: that no
Altar of earth, of wood, of ſtone, or any earthly thing, cā poſſibly
ſerve in this Prieſthood, to ſanctifie Chriſt, who is the offering.
But as he him ſelfe is not of this building: ſo likewiſe the Altar
that ſanctifieth him, muſt not be of this building, therefore ſaith
he him ſelf: For their ſakes doe I ſanctifie my ſelf: that they alſo may be ſanctified,
Io 17. 19. to ſhew vs, that as he is the Prieſt, the ſacrifice, &amp;
tabernacle: ſo he only is the Altar. For he is the body of all the
ſhadowes in the law. therfore, as he is ſaid to have offred, by the
eternal ſpirit, as the Prieſt him ſelf, as the ſacrifice vnto God: ſo is
he to be vnderſtood by that ſame eternal ſpirit, as by the Altar, to
have ſanctified him ſelf, that is, that body: by the offering whereof
once, we are ſanctified for evermore.
               
                  
And we are to holde this truth moſt carefully: both to eſchue
the fooliſh opinion of ſome, who eſteeme the croſſe to have bin
the Altar, whereon Chriſt was offered. as alſo to keepe our ſelves
from falling into that blaſphemous errour: to thinke, that
there is any thing greater then the Sonne of God▪ leaſt wee pollute
our ſelves, with the abominable idolatrie of the Church of
Rome. who make their wood and ſtone, greater then Chriſt, &amp;
make their earthlie Prieſtes, greater then both ſacrifice and Altar.
and give them Prieſtlie power, being in the earth, and being
of this building, and being loaden with ſinne, in an earthlie
tabernacle, vpon an earthly and corruptible altar, to offer
vp, and that oft and many times, this heavenly ſacrifice: which
is never to be repeated. As alſo, to give them power to ſanctifie
a ſtocke, or ſtone: and to give it power, to ſanctifie Chriſt.
               Now concerning the Sanctuarie, which is the thirde thing requiſite,
for offering the ſacrifice: wee have ſomewhat ſpoken
thereof alreadie, in his action of ſitting at the right hande of
God. Neither is it neceſſarie that we ſpeake much more of it:
onely we are to knowe, that this ſacrifice, can not be offered els
where, but in the true Tabernacle, that is the body of his fleſh.
Therefore doeth he call his body, the Temple, Iohn chap. 2. verſe
19. neither could the bloud thereof, be carried in, by our high
Prieſt, els-where, but in the true Sanctuarie, that is Heaven it
ſelfe.
               By all theſe preceeding thinges, we may perceyve, that there
is a manifold conſideration to be had of Chriſt, in the worke of
our iuſtification. Firſt, as he is our High Prieſt. in which point,
we are to conſider, both the Godhead, and his Manhoode, and
the properties of his Manhood, qualifying him to bee a meete
high Prieſt. Secondly, as hee is the Altar that ſanctifieth the
offering. Thirdly, as he is the Tabernacle in which the offering
is to be made. And fourthly, as he is the offering and oblation
itſelfe. Now in all theſe, the obedience of Chriſt to the Father,
doeth manifeſtly ſhine. as likewiſe in all the reſt of his actions
whatſoever. And all theſe, that we have ſpoken of, are neceſſarily
required in the worke of our iuſtification, but are not all to

bee included in the matter of our righteouſnes. For as he is our
Prieſt, Altar, and Tabernacle, he cannot properly be called our
righteouſnes, except it be efficientlie: but no wiſe materiallie.
For he is our righteouſnes materially only as hee is the ſacrifice
and offering.
               Thus, if we ſhall diſtinguiſh Chriſt him ſelfe, in that thinge,
wherein he is made our righteouſnes: from him ſelfe in theſe
things, wherein he is made beſide, to ſerve vnto our iuſtification,
by that, wherein he is made our righteouſnes. And ſecondly,
if we ſhal diſtinguiſh the matter of our righteouſnes it ſelfe in
Chriſt, from the action of God in iuſtifying by it: wee ſhall perceyve
evidently, that the matter of our righteouſnes, conſiſteth
only in the death and bloud of Chriſt▪ and that all the reſt of
Chriſtes obedience, doeth ſerve not as the materiall, but rather
as the ſubordinate efficient cauſes of our iuſtification.
               And ſo all the three former opinions, touching the obedience
of Chriſt, may well agree in one: when the queſtion is, concerning
the action of God in iuſtifying: and not concerning the
particular matter of the righteouſnes, which God imputes vnto
vs vnto iuſtification. For, there is no parte of Chriſtes obedience,
which is not (as it is ſaid in the ſchooles) cauſa ſine qua non:
that is, a cauſe without the which, wee cannot be iuſtified. For
if he had not bene a man, and a iuſt man, and a Prieſt, and ſuch
a Prieſt as we have ſaid: yea if hee had not riſen from the dead,
and aſcended vnto heaven, and made interceſſion for vs: his
death and bloud could never have iuſtified vs. And yet ſtill his
death and bloud is the only matter of our righteouſnes: but ſo,
as it is the bloud, of ſuch a ſacrifice, offred by ſuch a Prieſt: vpon
ſuch an Altar: in ſuch a Tabernacle▪ carried in by the ſame
Prieſt, after reſurrection from the dead, into the heavens. And
as by vertue of the ſame bloud, the ſame Prieſt, ſittinge at the
right hande of God, maketh interceſſion for vs. Thus, the matter
is not of ſuch moment (being rightly waighed, and charitablie
conſidered) that it needed ever to have bred, ſuch bitter contention
amongſt brethren in the Church of God.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               HAving thus ſpoken of the materiall cauſe of our righteouſnes.
it followeth now that we ſpeake of the formall
cauſe. In the which three thinges are ſpecially to be marked,
for clearing vnto vs, how and in what manner wee are
made the righteouſnes of God, by the death and bloud of Ieſus
Chriſt our Lord.
               The firſt is, Gods giving vnto vs.
               The ſecond is, Gods imputation of that which is given vs.
               The third is, the cauſe moving him both to give and impute.
For God iuſtifieth vs by gift, by imputation, and by grace, Neither
can the true forme of our iuſtification bee knowne of vs a
right, except we acknowledge all theſe three in it. For mā hath
no ſaving grace, which he hath not receyved of God. according
to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. chap. 4. ver. 7. For who hath ſeperate
thee, or what haſt thou that thou haſt not receyved: and if thou haſt
receyved it, why glorieſt thou, as if thou hadſt not receyved it. And to the
ſame purpoſe ſaith I am. 1. chap. 17. All good giving, and every perfect
gifte is from above. Therefore alſo our righteouſnes ſpeciallie is
called a gift, and a gift by grace, Rom. chapt. 5. ver. 15. 16. 17. as
alſo Rom. chap. 6. verſ▪ 23. but the gift of God is eternall life. Where the
word gift (if that place be rightly vnderſtood) doth ſignifie righteouſnes
given vs of God.
               Secondly, howſoever many confounde, imputation and giving,
as one thinge: (as in ſome ſenſe they may both bee taken
for one) yet it is expedient for our ſounder knowledge, that wee
diſtinguiſh them. For howſoever nothing is imputed, which is
not given: yet many things are given, which are never ſaide to
be imputed. Yea moreover: in which imputation hath no place.
Beſide, the imputation of a thing (if we ſhall rightly conſider it)
doth alwayes preſuppone the thing imputed to be in our poſſeſſion,
either by nature, working, or gift. as by Gods grace wee
ſhall heare hereafter.
               And therefore, in the forme of our iuſtification, Gods giving

of a thing vnto vs, is to be diſtinguiſhed from his imputing of it.
Specially if we marke one thing: which is, flat contrarie ſayings,
and yet of equall force, vſed by the ſpirit of God, in the deſcription
of iuſtification. For ſometimes it is defined by imputation
of righteouſnes, and ſometimes by not imputation of ſinne.
               Thirdly, in the manner and forme of our iuſtification: grace
is ſpecially to be conſidered: becauſe both the givinge, and imputation
of the thing given, is of meere grace. Therefore are
wee ſaide to bee iuſtified freely by grace. ſo that the perfect
forme of our iuſtification, conſiſteth in this: that is, in Gods gracious
givinge, and gracious imputinge of thinge given, vnto
vs: to bee our righteouſnes. So that whoſoever make our iuſtification,
to conſiſt, without giving of righteouſnes. or without
imputing the thinge given, or eſteeme eyther the matter of
our righteouſnes, which is given vs, to be given otherwiſe then
by grace: or to be imputed as righteouſnes vnto vs, otherwiſe
then by grace, doe deſtroy the true forme of the iuſtification of a
ſinner before God.
               And becauſe this is a pointe of ſpeciall moment: and bringeth
great light, in the matter of iuſtification: wee will ſpeake ſeverally
of theſe three pointes.
               And firſt, touching the action of Gods giving.
               Secondly, of the action of Gods imputation.
               Thirdly, of his grace, as the only cauſe of both.
               Touching the firſt: there be two thinges which are given vs
of God vnto iuſtification. The I. is faith. The II. is Chriſt. &amp; both
theſe giftes of God, are neceſſarie vnto iuſtification. as we ſhall
ſee by Gods grace hereafter, when we ſpeake of iuſtificatiō it ſelf.
Therfore in this place wee will onely ſpeake of faith, as it is the
gift of God. in which we have theſe pointes to be marked.
               Firſt, what kinde of gift it is.
               Secondly, to whom it is given.
               Thirdly, what faith it ſelfe is.
               And fourthly, to what ende and vſe it is given.
               Firſt then. that it is a gift, and the gift of God, it is cleere in the
Scriptures. according as wee have ſhowen before, of all the

ſaving graces of God. and therefore it is called by the Apoſtle,
Heb. chap. 7. verſ. 4. a heavenly gift. and in Ephe. chap. 2. ver. 8.
it is expreſly called the gifte of God. And the ſame Apoſtle,
Phil. chap. 1. ver. 29. teacheth vs, that to beleeve in Chriſt, is a
gift given vs. Therefore 1. Cor. chap. 12. It is uombred amongſt
the giftes of God, by his ſpirit.
               So that in this there is no great contradiction, but the ſpeciall
queſtion is what kinde of gift it is. that is, whether it bee a
naturall or a ſupernaturall gift. Depending either vpon the naturall
power which God hath created in man. or vpon the ſupernaturall
power of God.
               For clearing hereof. We are to conſider that, which in the
ſcriptures is ſpoken concerning faith.
               Firſt, touthing the ground and cauſe of our beleeving.
               Secondly, touching the propertie, that is attributed vnto
faith, and which ſtill is in him, that beleeveth.
               And thirdly, touching certaine effectes attributed vnto faith.
Beſides theſe things which heereafter will ſhewe them ſelves,
when we treate both to whom faith is given, and what faith it
ſelfe is, and what is the vſe and end of it.
               Concerning the ground and cauſe of our beleeving: if wee
carefully marke the ſcriptures of God, it is placed eſpecially in
three thinges.
               The firſt is, the will of God, and his eternall Decree, according
to his will. as is cleere, by Math. chapt. 11. verſ. 26. where
Chriſt attributed vnto the good will and pleaſure of the Father,
that ſome did beleeve, and ſome did not. And Acts chap. 13. ver.
48. where it is expreſlie ſaid: That as many as were ordayned vnto eternall
life, beeleved. And this teacheth vs two things: Firſt, that faith
is no worke depending vpon the will of man, nor any power in
nature. Secondly, that it is of the nomber of thoſe bleſſings, not
which God did communicate in the firſt creation, but of thoſe
which were hid vp in the myſterie of Gods, will, touchinge the
diſpenſation of life, in, and through Chriſt.
               The ſecond thinge, wherein the ground and cauſe of beleeving,
is placed in Gods free gift, accordinge to the ſayinge of

Chriſt him ſelfe, Ioh. chap. 6. verſ. 37. and 65. Which gift of God,
is there alſo declared to be two folde. The firſt, the giving of our
perſons vnto Chriſt, according to theſe wordes: All that the Father
giveth me, shall come to mee. The ſecond is, the giving vnto vs
grace to beleeve. According to that other ſaying: No man can come
vnto mee, except it be given him of my Father. For as ſaieth the Apoſtle,
Rom. chap. 11. verſ. 32. God hath shut vp all men vnder vnbeleefe, that
he might shewe mercie on all. And againe, Gallat. chap. 3. verſ. 22. The
Scripture hath concluded all vnder ſinne, that the promiſe by the faith of Ieſus
Chriſt, might be given to them that beleeve. And this ground is verified
by the ſaying of Ioh. chap. 12. ver. 39. 40. where he giveth a reaſon,
why the Iewes for all his miracles, not only beleeved not,
but alſo why they could not beleeve in Chriſt. ſaying: Therefore
could they not beleeve, becauſe that Eſay ſaieth, Hee hath blinded their
eyes, &amp;c.
               
               The third thing wherein the ground and cauſe of our beleeving
is placed, is our ſpirituall birth. Therefore ſaith Iohn 1. Ep.
chap. 5. 1. VVhoſoever beleeveth that Ieſus is the Chriſt, is borne of God.
Therefore the ſame Iohn deſcribing, who they are that doe beleeve
in the Goſpell, Chap. 1. verſ. 13. ſayeth: which ar borne, not of
bloud, nor of the will of flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. By al theſe
three groundes, it is evident, that faith is no naturall, but a ſupernaturall gift. and therefore the praiſe of our beleeving, is taken
from vs, and given wholy vnto God. as is cleere in the
wordes of Chriſt, to Peter, Math. chap. 16. ver. 17. Flesh and bloud
hath not reveiled that vnto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
               
               Now we come to the propertie that is attributed to faith, and
which through faith is in every one that beleeveth. and this propertie
is the power of God, according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle,
Ephe. chap. 1. ver. 19. Where the Apoſtle prayeth, that they
might knowe what was, the exceeding greatnes of the power
of God, in them that beleeve. and therefore is it, that faith is called,
the faith of the effectuall working of God, Coll. chap. 2. ver.
12. and that for two reaſons.
               Firſt, becauſe no power, nor working of any power, can ever

worke faith in our hearts, except the power of God onely: and
therefore the Prophet Eſay doeth put beleeving, and the having
of the arme of the Lord revealed, for one thinge, Chapter 53.
verſe 1.
               Secondly, becauſe the power and the effectuall working of
faith in vs, is nothing but the very power, and the workinge of
the power, of God him ſelfe. Who, as ſaith Peter, by his power,
through faith, keepeth vs, 1. Epiſt. chap. 1. ver. 5. and for this
cauſe, it is not only, that faith is compted, for the chiefe piece of
the armour of God, and of the might of his power, Epheſ. chap.
6. but alſo that to have Chriſt livinge in vs, and to live by the
faith of Chriſt, are put for one thinge, Gallat. chapt. 2. ver. 20.
Thereby ſhewing vs, that the power of faith, is not any thinge
but the power of GOD, and of Chriſt, dwelling by faith in
vs. and that faith is the effectuall inſtrument, whereby Chriſt
is powerfull in vs. Vpon which grounde it is, that the effectes
of Chriſt him ſelfe, are often attributed vnto faith. as in theſe
ſayinges of Chriſt: Thy Faith hath made thee whole: Thy Faith
hath ſaved thee. And when we are ſaide to bee ſaved by faith, to
have our heartes purged by faith: to bee iuſtified by faith, &amp;c.
A cleere example of this wee have, Acts, chap. 3. ver 16. where
the Apoſtle indifferentlie attributes to the power of Chriſt, and
to faith, the healing of the Creeple man. Which place is carefully
to be marked, becauſe it giveth a marveillous light in the
vſe of faith. For there it is ſaide: That through faith in his Name,
his name had made the man ſound. Which ſaying doth ſhew vs expreſlie,
that it was not faith it ſelfe, as it was the worke of that man,
but the name of Chriſt, in which his faith was, that did make
him ſound. ſo that the power of faith is nothing, but the power
of Chriſt, embraſed by faith. and that the worke of faith, is nothing
but the worke of Chriſt, dwelling in our heartes by faith.
Which doeth iuſtifie their opinion, who affirme, that to be iuſtified
by faith, is alwayes to bee vnderſtood, to bee iuſtified by
Chriſt. For as by faith in his Name, his Name made the man
ſounde, even ſo by faith in his bloud, his bloud maketh vs righteous.

Therefore ſayeth the Apoſtle Rom. chap. 3. verſ. 25. That
God hath ſet Chriſt forth a propitiation by faith in his bloud. Where reconciling
by faith, in his bloud, is to be vnderſtoode, in the ſame
ſenſe, that making ſoūd by faith in his name is to be vnderſtood.
in the other place, by which it is evident, that faith is never
rightly taken, in our iuſtification, when it is taken for the thing,
wherein ſtandeth our righteouſnes, and not for the inſtrument,
apprehending that thing, which is our righteouſnes. Thus the
power of God, working faith, and the power of God, accompanying
faith, doeth evidently ſhewe, faith to bee a ſupernaturall
gift, being wrought by a ſupernaturall power, and poſſeſſing vs
with a ſupernaturall power of God him ſelfe.
               This is cleerily verified, by the third pointe, touching theſe
effectes that are attributed vnto faith, in the booke of God: when
it is ſaide, to doe things that are above the ſtrength of all created
nature: and when Saintes are ſaide to have done by it, ſuch
thinges as are ſupernaturall. Of theſe firſt ſorte are thoſe ſayings,
where in the iuſtifying of vs, the ſaving of vs, &amp; miraculous healing
of diſeaſes, by nature incurable, are attributed vnto ſaith:
as alſo the keeping of vs vnto ſalvation. Of the other ſorte, are
thoſe ſayinges wherein we are ſaide by faith to overcome the
Divill, to quenche all his fierie dartes, 1. Pet. cha. 5. ver. 9. Ephe.
chap. 6. verſ 16. By faith we are ſaide to overcome the world, 1.
Iohn chap. 51 ver. 4. 5. and of theſe effectes of faith, there is a large
rehearſall made, Hebr. chap. 11. by which it is evident, that faith
is a ſupernaturall gift: ſeeing it produceth ſuch ſupernaturall effectes.
For nature never did yeeld or produce any thinge, no
not in the integritie of it, whereby wee could bee able, in reſiſting
to overcome the Divell, and the world, or to performe ſuch
great things, and endure ſuch heavie torments, ioyfully, as by
faith wee are made able to doe, and ſuffer. And this may
well be verified, by the dolefull experience, of the fall, both
of men and Angells, who by all the ſtrength of nature, vncorrupted,
could not preſerve them ſelves in their bleſſed eſtate,
nor overcome their temptations. Which ſheweth vs, that the
power which accompanieth faith in the heart of the beleever.

is more ſtronge and mightie, then any power, which God placed
by creation, in any nature whatſoever. Seeing it is able to
ſave a man, even now in his corrupted eſtate, and ro preſerve
him, vnto ſalvation. Whereas all the power naturall of man &amp;
Angells, could not keepe them. Now being in ſafetie from falling
from their felicitie, as alſo, that thereby, a ſinnefull fraile
corrupted man, is able to overcome the Devil, whom man created
in the image of God, yet perfect and without ſinne, was
not able to withſtande. For this cauſe it is, that the Apoſtle doth
ſo extoll, and magnifie, the exceeding greatnes of Gods power,
which is in them that beleeve, Ephe. chap. 1. ver. 19. By all this,
it is evident, that faith is no worke of nature, or the effect
of anie power in nature, but a ſupernaturall gifte, flowinge
from the ſupernaturall power of GOD. By the which GOD
effectually worketh in vs, and by vs, ſupernaturall effectes,
as beeing the ſupernaturall inſtrument, whereby his power
is effectuall in vs, as it was in Chriſt, when he rayſed him
from the dead, and crowned him with glorie and with honour:
and this gift of God cometh vnto vs, in ordinarie diſpenſation,
by hearing of the word, Rom. chap. 10. For there be three ordinarie
meanes, by which God vſeth to beſtow faith vpon vs, and
whereby his ſpirit is effectuall in vs to that end.
               The firſt is the Goſpell. therefore is the Goſpell called the
power of God, vnto ſalvation, Rom. chap. 1. ver. 16. as alſo, the
goſpell is ſaid to be written to this end, that we might bileeve,
Iohn chap. 20. ver. 31. and we are ſaide to bee called vnto the
faith by the Goſpell, 2. Theſſ. cap. 2. ver. 14. but the ſpeciall parte
of the Goſpell, vnto faith, whereby we are called, is the promiſe.
For this cauſe, Abraham is ſaide not to have doubted of the promiſe:
and we are ſaide to be children of the promiſe, Gal. cha. 4.
ver. 28. Rom. chap. 9. ver. 8.
               The ſecond ordinarie meane, is the Sacramentes, which are
the ſignes and ſeales, of the righteouſnes which is by faith.
               The third inſtrument and meane is the Miniſters of the Goſpell,
who therefore are called, the miniſters, by whom we beleeve.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               NOW it followeth that wee ſpeake of the ſecond point,
touching faith, that is, to whom it is given, of which
point, ſome what may bee collected, out of theſe three
grounds, and cauſes, of beleeving, ſet downe heretofore, therefore
wee wil be the ſhorter herein.
               In handling this point, we have two things ſpecially to bee
marked.
               The firſt is, what perſons they are amongſt men, in whom
the Lord doth worke faith, that is, whether he worketh it in all
men indifferently, or in ſome certaine nomber only.
               The ſecond is, in what part, power, or facultie, of man, faith
is wrought.
               Touching the firſt, The firſt ground or cauſe that wee laid
downe, of beleeving, may alone ſufficiently cleere this, ſeeing
our beleeving depends vpon, the Lords ordayning vs to eternall
life, of his good will and pleaſure. It muſt follow, that God
giveth faith to no more, then hee hath Predeſtinated, and that
faith is not indifferently given to all, it is manifeſt by experiences
in all ages, and by the teſtimonie of Gods trueth, Math. cha.
11. verſ. 25. Where Chriſt giveth thankes vnto the Father, becauſe
hee had denied faith vnto the wiſe, and men of vnderſtanding,
and had given it vnto babes. And againe, Math. chap.
13. verſ. 11. it is expreſly ſaid by Chriſt, that it was given to his
diſciples to know the ſecretes of the Kingdome of heaven, but
vnto the reſt of the Iewes it was not given. Therefore the Apoſtle,
2 Theſ. chap. 3. verſ. 2. affirmeth plainly, that all men
have not faith. Or rather (as the words ſeeme to importe) that
faith belongs not to all men. And theſe teſtimonies preceeding doe
prove, that this is true: not only in reſpect of the action of mans
will, reiecting the meanes of knowledge and faith, offered by
God, but in reſpect of the action of God, in denying the meanes,
yea which is more, in blinding their eyes, that they ſhall not
ſee. Eſay. 6. and Ioh. 12. and Rom. 9. 18. Beſides this it is manifeſt

by the deſcription of thoſe to whom faith is given.
               Firſt, they are deſcribed to be the ſheepe of Chriſt, Ioh. chap.
10. ver. 26. and therefore ſayeth Chriſt to the Iewes that beleeved
not, but yee beleeve not for yee are not of my sheepe. Whereby it is
manifeſt, that none (ſave they which are Chriſtes ſheepe) doe
receyve faith: and that becauſe Chriſt did lay downe his life,
for none but for his ſheepe, Iohn. chapt. 10. ver. 11. 15. For none
can have faith in the bloud of Chriſt, for whom Chriſt never
ſhed his bloud.
               The ſecond thing whereby they are deſcribed, is the Fathers
giving of them to Chriſt, and this is the ground of the former.
For none are Chriſtes ſheepe, but ſuch as the Father gives him.
and therefore he him ſelfe acknowledgeth, thoſe who are his
ſheepe, to have bene given him by the Father, Iohn cha. 10. ver.
29. and 17. 6. &amp;c. according to which ground, Chriſt ſpeaketh
Iohn chap. 6. verſ. 35. 36. 37. ſhewing this to bee the cauſe why
the Iewes beleeved not. to wit, becauſe the Father had not given
them vnto him, while he takes his argument, from the contrarie
effect, in this manner: All that the Father giveth me, commeth
vnto mee. Vpon the which it muſt followe, that of the contrarie
effect, there muſt bee a contrarie cauſe. that is, that who do not
come vnto him, muſt not be given of God vnto him. For it is
the will of the Father, that ſendes Chriſt, that he ſave thoſe only
whom he hath given him, Ioh. chap. 6. ver. 39. and 17. 2. For
which cauſe Chriſt him ſelfe declareth, that he did manifeſt his
Fathers Name, and give the words which his Father had given
him, and did pray vnto the Father for none, but thoſe that the
Father had given him, out of the world.
               The third thing whereby they are deſcribed, is, that they are
the elect of God. therefore faith is called the faith of Gods elect,
to ſhewe vs that Gods election limiteth faith, which is diſpenſed
to no more but ſuch, as God hath elected. as is manifeſt, Rom.
chap. 11. ver. 5. where the Apoſtle ſheweth the reaſon why, in the
reiection of the Iewes, in their infidelitie, a remaynent of faithfull
ones were reſerved. ſaying: So alſo at this preſent time, there is a
remnant according to the election of grace. and this is the ground of the

former point: For as we are the ſheepe of Chriſt, becauſe wee
are given him. ſo wee are given to Chriſt, becauſe wee are elected.
Therefore wee may boldly conclude, that Gods Decree,
according to his purpoſe, is not generall, or indefinite, but particular,
and definite, of a certayne number of perſons.
               For moſt ſure and certayne it is, that the office of Chriſt, as
Prince of our ſalvation, is of as large extent, in bringinge men
to ſalvation, as is the Fathers will, in ordayninge them to ſalvation,
through CHRIST IESVS. For hee came to doe the
will of his Father. Seeing therefore, that Chriſt layeth downe
his life for none, and giveth eternall life to none, and interceedeth
for none, but ſuch as are his ſheepe. And ſeeing hee
accomptes none his ſheepe, but ſuch as his Father gives him:
And ſeeinge the Father gives none vnto him, but ſuch as
hee hath elected in him: and ſeeinge hee elected none in
him, but ſuch as hee had predeſtinate, to bee adopted through
him, Ephe. chapt. 1. ver. 4. 5. It muſt needes followe, that Gods
Decree is of a definit number, and that the Redemption, and
Interceſſion of Chriſt, are of no larger extent, then the number
of thoſe that beleeve. And that faith is of no larger extent,
then Gods Decree, and his election following therevppon:
neither by purpoſe, or intention in God, or poſſibilitie in man.
So that it is playne, by the holy Scriptures, that none except
thoſe who are elected of God, doe ever receyve the gift of faith
from God. For our election dependeth not vpon our faith, but
faith vpon our election. Therefore faith and the fruites of it
are teſtimonies of our election, as is cleere by the Apoſtle, reaſoning,
1. Theſ. chap. 1.
               Touching the parte, power, or facultie, of Gods elect,
wherein faith is wrought by GOD, and receyved of vs, the Apoſtle
cleeres it to vs, Rom. chap. 10. ver. 10. ſayinge: VVith
the heart man beleeveth vnto righteouſnes. Thus it is manifeſt, that
the heart of man, is the parte wherein faith is wrought, &amp; with
the which man beleeveth. Of which it will followe, that their
opinion muſt bee erronious, who doe make Gods workinge
in vs, for the begetting and building of faith in our heartes,

to be only in our vnderſtanding, and not in our will, and affection,
except only by way of perſuaſion. Whereas notwithſtanding
in the iudgment of all men, the hart is chiefly taken for the
will and affections, which yet ſhall appeare more evidently,
when we ſhall ſee firſt that beleeving is an action of the whole
heart. Secondly, when we ſhall ſee, that in the ſcriptures, by the
heart is vnderſtood, not any one power only, or facultie of the
ſoule, but all the powers and faculties of it, even after the largeſt
manner, of the diviſion thereof, which is, when it is divided
in the vnderſtanding, will, affection, and memorie.
               Touching the firſt, that faith is a worke of the whole heart, it
is manifeſt by the words of Philip to the Eunuch, Acts 8. 37. ſaying:
If thou beleeveſt with thy whole heart, thou maiſt be baptiſed.
               
               The ſecond alſo is manifeſt, that by the hearte is vnderſtood,
all the powers of the ſoule. And firſt the vnderſtanding, Eſa. cha.
6. and Math. chap. 13. where it is ſaide, That God had hardened their
heartes, that they shoud not vnderſtand with their hearts. And Salomon in
the 1. of Kinges, chap. 3. ver. 9. asketh of God, an vnderſtanding heart.
And therefore the Apoſtle, the 2. Cor. chap. 3. ver. 15. attributeth
the ignorance of the Iewes, to the vaile that is laide over their
heartes.
               Secondly, touching the will and power of election, it is alſo
attributed to the heart, Acts chapt. 7. where it is ſaide, that the
Fathers would not obey the Angell, but refuſed, and in their
heartes turned backe againe to Egypt. And actes 11. Barnabas
exhorted all, that with purpoſe of heart, they would continue
in the Lord. And 1. Cor. chap. 7. it is ſaid, He that ſtandeth firme
in his heart, that he hath no need, but hath power over his owne
will, &amp;c. And againe, 2. Cor. chap. 9. ver. 7. As every man hath
fore-determined (or choſen) with his heart.
               Thirdly, touching the affections, it is a thing out of controverſie,
that they belong to the heart. And the ſcripture witneſſeth
the ſame, Math. chap. 6. ver. 21. where Chriſt ſayeth: VVhere
your treaſure is, there wil your heart be alſo. And Rom. chap. 1. ver. 24.
it is ſaide, that God did give vp the Gentils, in the luſtes of their
heatres, vnto vncleannes. And in the 14. and 16. chap. of Iohn,

Feare, ſorrowe, ioye, are attributed vnto the heart.
               Fourthly, memorie, and retayning in minde, is attributed vnto
the heart. Luke chap. 1. ver. 66. All they that heard, did lay vp all
theſe wordes in their heart. And Luke chap. 21. ver. 14. Chriſt ſayeth
to his Diſciples, Lay it vp therefore in your heartes. And for this ſame
cauſe God ſayeth in his covenant, That he will write his lawe
in our heartes. For this cauſe doeth Chriſt attribute vnto mans
heart, the treaſure of man. Math. chap. 12. A good man out of the good
treaſurie of his heart, bringeth foorth good things: And an evill man, out of the
evill treaſurie of his heart bringeth foorth evill thinges. Thus the power
of retayning, and keeping in minde, &amp; laying vp in ſtore things
both good, and evill, is attributed vnto the heart of man.
               Of this we may perceyve, that ſeeing beleeving, is an action
of the whole heart, that it muſt needes be wrought of God: and
receyved by vs in all the ſe foreſaide powers, of the ſoule: and
that the action of our heart in beleeving, is not an action of the
wil only, but of all the powers of the ſoule cōiunctly. For ſeeing
faith is the roote of our regeneration, out of which ſpringeth all
good motion, and all the partes of the renewed man, in all the
powers of the ſoule. It is moſt neceſſarilie requiſite, that faith it
ſelfe be placed in them all: that by it, all may be purified, and all
may be filled with Chriſt: and all may live by the faith of the
Sonne of God. For no more of the ſoule of man is renewed, but
ſo farre of it, as is iudued with faith. Neyther is any more poſſeſſed
with Chriſt, then is poſſeſt with faith: nor can Chriſt live
in any more of our ſoule, then that wich liveth by the faith of
CHRIST.
               By this it may appeare, how vngraciouſlie they ſpeake of
Gods grace in the worke of faith, who make him effectually to
renewe, no more of man but his vnderſtanding: leavinge the
action of conſenting, and embracing by faith the things reveiled,
to the will of man. as alſo how ſlenderly they ſpeake of
faith, who place it in nothing, but in the willes aſſentinge to
the trueth of God.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               NOw it followeth, that we ſpeake of faith it ſelfe, what it
is. In which point wee will firſt intreate, of the divers
ſignifications of Faith, in the word of God. And ſecondly
of the true ſignification and nature of it, in the wroke of iuſtification.
               Touching the firſt, Faith is taken in foure divers ſignifications
in the ſcriptures of God, beſides that ſignification which it
hath in the worke of iuſtification.
               
                  The firſt ſignification is, when faith is taken for fidelitie and
trueth, as Math. chap. 23. 32. Yee leave the waightier matter of the
Law, as iudgement, mercie, and fidelitie. Likewiſe, Rom. chap. 3. ver. 3.
Shall their vnbeliefe make the faith of God of none effect. and 1. Timoth.
cha. 5. ver. 12. having damnation, becauſe they have broken their first faith.
               Secondly, faith doeth ſignifie the doctrine of the Goſpell, becauſe
it is begotten in vs, by the Goſpell, for faith commeth by
hearing, therefore faith is called the faith of the Goſpell, as alſo
becauſe the Goſpell, preacheth ſalvatiō, to be no otherwiſe but
by faith. and therefore the Goſpell is called the worde of faith.
Rom. chap. 10. ver. 8. In this ſignification it is taken, Gall. chap.
3. Receyved ye the ſpirit by the workes of the Lawe, or by the hearing of ſaith.
And againe, Galla chap. 1. ver. 23. He which in time paſt perſecuted vs.
nowe preacheth the faith, that he before deſtroyed. And Acts chap. 6. ver.
7. And a great companie of the Prieſts were obedient to the faith.
               
               Thirdly, faith is taken for particular knowledge, Rom. 14.
22. Hast thou faith, have it with thy ſelf, &amp;c. That which in this place
the Apoſtle calleth faith, in the ſame queſtion, matter, and purpoſe,
he calleth knowledge, 1. Cor. chap. 8.
               Fourthly, faith is ſomtimes put for Chriſt himſelf in the goſpel.
becauſe al that ever faith in the goſpell apprehendeth, is Chriſt,
who is the only true obiect of faith vnto ſalvation. In this ſenſe
it is takē Gal. 3. 23. before faith came, we were kept vnder the law, as vnder
a garriſon, shut vp vnto that faith, which afterward should be reveiled. which
words being cōpared with the 24. &amp; 25. verſes folowing &amp; with
the 19. verſe preceeding, it ſhalbe manifeſt, that by the name of

faith, in that place, Chriſt the obiect of faith is vnderſtood.
               Thus much for theſe foure divers ſignifications: wherein faith
is taken in the word of God. Now we come to the ſpecial ſignificatiō
and nature of it, as we are ſaid thereby to be iuſtified. And
when it is ſaid to be imputed vnto righteouſnes. In which point
there is greateſt need of carefull attention, becauſe vpon the
miſtaking hereof, ariſeth principally, the miſtaking of iuſtification
it ſelfe. Specially in that ſentence where it is ſaide, that
Faith is imputed vnto righteouſnes. Concerning which there is a two-folde
controverſie. The firſt is, whether faith in this place be taken
in the owne proper ſignification, or in a borrowed ſenſe.
The ſeconde controverſie is, touching the proper ſignification,
of faith what it is.
               In the firſt controverſie, theſe who take faith in a borrowed
ſpeech, doe expound that ſentence Metonymically by faith vnderſtanding
Chriſt crucified, apprehended by faith, and ſo doe eſteeme
that faith, relatively, or inſtrumentally taken, and not properly,
is imputed vnto vs for righteouſnes. And this opinion agreeth
with the trueth of the matter it ſelfe. But there is no neceſſitie,
why faith in that place, ſhould bee taken in a borrowed
ſenſe: if the right minde and meaning of the holy Ghoſt, in this
phraſe, be gravely and maturely conſidered, ſo that if they who
take it properly, did not erre, eyther in the ſignification of it, or
in the true ſenſe of the imputation of it, their opinion might wel
be allowed. For faith in this ſentence, is in my opinion, to be taken
properly in that ſenſe, whereby in it ſelfe it is diſtinguiſhed,
both from the worde, whereby it is begotten, and from the obiect
of it, in the worde which is Chriſt. As alſo, from the naked
knowledge of the worde, and Chriſt, therein reveyled: how ſoever
it doeth comprehend knowledge.
               For ſearching out therefore, the true ſignificatiō of the word
Faith, in this ſentence, we will firſt ſet downe, the divers ſignifications
wherein it is taken. Secondly, wee will ſpeake of the
true nature and ſignification of it in this place, where it is ſaide
to be imputed vnto righteouſnes.
               Cōcerning the firſt, we are not to ſpeak of that differēce which

in the ſcriptures is warranted of hiſtoricall faith, miraculous
faith, and iuſtifying faith, but onely of the different opinions of
men, touching iuſtifying faith.
               In one thing all men doe conſent, and agree, that faith is an
action of the heart, conſiſting in iudgement: but they differ in
three ſortes.
               The firſt ſorte make this iudgment of the harte, in beleeving,
to be nothing but a naked opinion. which is a doubtfull inclination
of an vncertayne minde, to the beſt part of the contradiction
with feare of the contrarie parte, beeing deſtitute of the
knowledge of the true cauſe. As for example, in this contradiction,
Chriſtes death ſhall ſave vs. and Chriſtes death ſhall not
ſave vs: they have an opinion of the beſt, that is, that Chriſtes
death, ſhall ſave them, but no certaine knowledge, becauſe
they are ignorant of the cauſe of that effect: and therfore, feare
that they ſhall not bee ſaved, and in this opinion they place
faith.
               The ſeconde ſorte, which are the wiſer amongſt the Papiſtes,
doe make faith to be an action of the heart, in iudging,
neyther by way of opinion, nor yet by way of certayne knowledge,
but by a middle way of iudgement, betwixt opinion and
knowledge. Which participates of both, and yet is neyther of
them. For they will not have it, a doubtfull inclination of the
minde, vnto the beſt parte, with feare of the worſt, vpon ignorance
of the cauſe. Neither will they have it, a certayne inclination
of the minde, to the beſt, without all feare, of the worſt, vpō
certayne knowledge of the cauſe, and neceſſarie meanes. But
will have it middle conceyte of the minde, neither altogither
contingent, neither altogither neceſſarie.
               And now in theſe dayes, there is a ſorte of men, which agree
with this ſecond ſorte, in ſubſtance, whatſoever deceitfull ſhew,
their wordes doe make to the contrarie. Therefore as touching
this point, wee make no ſeverall order of them. For albeit in
word they ſeeme to admit, in beleeving, knowledge of the
thing beleeved: yea which is more, albeit they graunt application,
yet ſeeing they make neither of the two, neceſſarie, ſtable,

or conſtant, but variable, and ſubiect to change, affirming that
the Saintes, may fall from ſaving grace, they muſt needes agree
with the former, touching the ſenſe and meaning of the word
faith, as it is the action of our heartes in iudging and apprehending
of our ſalvation.
               The third ſorte are they, who eſteeme faith to ſignifie, the
aſſured confidence of the heart, vpon certayne knowledge of
the beſt parte, without any feare of the worſt. And this opinion
onely agreeth with Gods truth. For nothing can be more contrarie
to the nature of faith, then an vncertayne opinion: ſeeing
no demonſtration, can ever make a ſurer concluſion then faith
maketh in the heart of man, of all whatſoever it beleeveth. So
that iuſtly we may ſay, that ſalvation beleeved, and embraſed
by faith, is more ſure and ſtedfaſt and certayne vnto vs by faith,
then ever it was in the beginning to Adam, or Angells, by poſſeſſion.
For he that beleeveth, ſhall never periſh, and the gates
of hell ſhall never prevaile againſt him. For hee that beleeveth,
is perſwaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angells, nor Principalities,
nor powers, nor thinget preſent, nor thinges to come, nor height, nor depth,
nor any other ereature, shall be able to ſeperate him, from the love of GOD,
which is in Chriſt Ieſus his Lord. And for confirmation heereof, wee
referre the Reader to that which we have ſpoken before, touching
the ſupernaturall effectes of faith, and to that which heereafter
followeth, in the deſcription of the true nature of faith, vnto
the which we nowe come, leaving to ſpeake of the error concerning
the imputation of faith, vntill we come to treate of imputation
it ſelfe.
               Wee have heard alreadie, that faith is the ſupernaturall gift
of God. And that the meanes whereby the holy Ghoſt worketh
it, is the Word, the Sacraments, and the miniſterie. and that the
perſons to whom he giveth it, are only his elect, whom he hath
given to Chriſt, to be his ſheepe. And laſtly, that the whole
heart of man, and the powers of his ſoule, are the ſubiect wherein
it is wrought. So that nowe it reſteth to know, what it is that
God worketh in our ſoules, when he giveth vs faith. For in theſe
things, that have already beene ſaid, it differeth nothing from

the reſt of Gods ſaving graces. For they are all heavenly, ſpirituall,
and ſupernaturall giftes of God, wrought in the whole
heart of every one of Gods elect: eyther by the inward operation
of the holy Ghoſt, extraordinarily, or els in ordiraaie diſpenſation,
by the effectuall revelation of the Goſpell. Therefore
ſeeing faith, hath theſe things common with all the reſt,
wee are nowe to trie the particular difference, whereby it is
diſtinguiſhed in ſubſtance, and nature, from all the reſt of Gods
bleſſings.
               The conſideration of the nature of faith in it ſelfe, is twofolde.
               Firſt, faith is to be conſidered, as it is the gift of God, cōming
from him, and wrought by him, in our heartes.
               Secondly, faith is to be conſidered, as our hearts (having it
not wrought in them) worke by it againe, towards God, vnto
iuſtification.
               This twofold conſideration of faith, is neceſſarie for the right
knowledge, both of the nature &amp; of the working of it. For faith
paſſively taken, ſignifieth the effect of Gods working: framinge
faith in our heartes: but actively taken, it ſignifieth the action
of our hearts now beleeving, in laying holde vpon Ieſus Chriſt,
as he, who is made of God vnto vs, wiſedome, ſanctification,
and redemption.
               Firſt then we will ſpeake of it, as it is the worke of God in
vs. And next, as our hearts worketh by it. And this we are carefully
to conſider, for herevpon dependeth all our fellowſhip
with God in Chriſt. and all participation of the promiſe, and inheritance
promiſed to the children of God. &amp; all true reioycing,
and gloriation, in God. and in this worke of faith, conſiſteth all
the ſtrength whereby we are made able, to ſtande againſt all
powers of darknes, and ſinne, and are vpholden to the ende.
               In the ſcriptures of God we finde, that all bleſſings that come
from Chriſt vnto vs, are attributed vnto faith: as alſo our beeing
Chriſts, and the children of God in him, is likewiſe attributed
vnto faith. For there be two ſpeciall grounds in the which conſiſts
all our felicitie.
               The firſt is our becomming Chriſtes, that is when wee are
made his.
               
                  
The ſeconde is, the infallible conſequence of the former,
when all that Chriſt is made of God for vs, is made ours. So
that his death, his reſurrection, his aſcention, his glorification,
&amp;c. are all made ours. And this followeth vpon the former,
for as ſayeth the Apoſtles, If yee bee Chriſtes, then are yee Abrahams
ſeede, and heyres by promiſe, Gallat. chapt. 3. ver. 29. according to
which alſo the Apoſtle ſayeth, All thinges are yours, and ye Chriſtes, &amp;
Chriſt Gods, 1. Cor. chap. 3. ver. 21. 32. 23. Now faith is the meane
and inſtrument, of both theſe points. For by faith wee are made
Chriſts, and by faith Chriſt is to vs, wiſdome, righteouſnes, ſanctification,
and redemption.
               The firſt of theſe two is the fruite of faith, as God worketh it
in our hearts, or rather the work of God, by working faith in our
hearts. The ſecond is the fruit of faith, nowe wrought in our
hearts, or rather, the worke of our heartes by faith.
               Thus faith is the mean, &amp; effectual inſtrumēt of al our bleſſednes:
both in our vnion with Chriſt the ſonne of God, and alſo of
our cōmunion with him, both in his death, life, and glory: and
therefore we are ſaid both to bee the ſonnes of God by faith in
Chriſt, and to be iuſtified by faith in him, and to live by faith in
him, and to be ſaved by faith in him, ſo that faith is the ſupernaturall
gift of God, given vs, for theſe ſupernaturall endes, that by
it we may be in Chriſt, and Chriſt in vs, for by faith he dwelles
in our hearts, and that in him, and by him, we may enioy righteouſnes
and life.
               To ſpeake then of the firſt, that is, of faith as God worketh it,
it conſiſteth ſpecially in foure things.
               The firſt is, in Gods opening &amp; illuminating of our vnderſtandings,
making our hearts in our vnderſtanding power, not only
to know the promiſe in Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt to be the ſeed in whom
bleſſednes is promiſed to all Nations, and in whom all the promiſes
of God are yea and amen: but alſo to iudge and eſteeme theſe
thinges reveyled of God, to be a moſt vndoubted and vnfallible
trueth. ſo that by this firſt worke of the Father, the heart of Gods
elect is made to ſee, &amp; vndoubtedly to acknowledge, that there
is no bleſſednes vnto man, but onely in Ieſus Chriſt crucified.

So that his eyes are open to ſee in him ſelfe, nothinge but iuſt
cauſe of condemnation: from the which there is not any helpe,
neither in him ſelfe, nor any creature, but in Ieſus Chriſt alone.
And therefore is made of God, to determine with him ſelfe, to
knowe nothing vnto life and ſalvation, but Chriſt and him crucified:
and this worke of the Father (which is the beginning of
all grace) is expreſſed in the Scriptures, by Gods teachinge vs:
according as Chriſt ſayeth, Iohn chap. 6. ver. 45. Every one that
hath heard of the Farher, and hath learned of him, cōmeth vnto me. Shewing
vs thereby, that the firſt cauſe of our beleeving, or rather the
firſt parte and portion of the worke of faith wrought in our
heartes by God, conſiſteth in God teaching of vs: according to
his promiſe made in his covenant, Eſay chap. 54. ver. 13. And all
thy children shalbe taught of the Lord. And Ierem. chap. 31. ver. 33. 34.
I will put my lawe in their inward partes, and write it in their heartes, and
they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and everie man his brother,
ſaying, knowe the Lord: For they shall all knowe mee from the least of them,
vnto the greateſt of them, ſayeth the Lord.
               
               For it is true which Chriſt ſpeaketh, Math. chap. 11. ver. 27.
No man knoweth the Sonne, but the Father: neyther knoweth any man the
Father, but the Sonne: and he to whom the Sonne will reveyle him. So that
the knowledge of God, is a ſecrete belonging to God alone,
which no fleſh is everable to attayne vnto, by any power of his
owne naturall light and vnderſtanding: therefore ſaieth the Apoſtle,
that this is the wiſedome of God hid in a myſterie, which
none of the Princes of this worlde have ever knowne, 1. Cor. 2.
For as he ſaith in that ſame chapter, The naturall man, perceyveth not
the thinges of the Spirit of God. For they are foolishnes vnto him: neyther can
hee know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. And this he confirmeth
by a ſtrong argument, in that ſame chapter, verſ. 11. ſaying:
For what man knoweth, the thinges of a man, ſaue the ſpirit of a man
which is in him: even ſo the thinges of God, knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of
God. For which cauſe alſo, in that ſame place, he attributeth the
cauſe of all our knowledge, vnto God reveyling vnto vs by his
ſpirit, the thinges that are given vs of God: according to which
Chriſt ſaieth vnto Peter, when hee did confeſſe him to bee the

Chriſt the Sonne of the living God, that flesh and bloud had not reveiled
that vnto him, but his Father which was in heaven, Math. cha. 16. ver.
17. thereby witneſſing plainly, that no naturall light, nor information
of mans owne minde, can poſſibly make a man to know
Ieſus, to be the Chriſt, and ſonne of the living God: but that
this knowledge commeth vnto our heartes, by the ſupernatural
gift, and revelation of God by his ſpirit: according to which the
Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Cor. chap. 1. ver. 18. That the preaching of the croſſe, is
to them that perish, foolishnes: but vnto vs that are ſaved, it is the power of
God. For God hath caſt away the vnderſtanding of the prudent,
and hath made the wiſedome of this worlde fooliſhnes. For by
that wiſedome the world doeth not know God, therefore ſayth
the Apoſtle in that ſame place: VVee preach Chriſt crucified, vnto the
Iewes even a ſtūbling blocke: and vnto the Graecians foolishnes: but vnto them
which are called, both of the Iewes, &amp; Graecians, we preach Chriſt the power
of God, and the wiſedome of God. Thus it is playne, that this wiſedome
and light of the heart, whereby we know Chriſt crucified,
to be our onely Saviour and Sonne of God, is a gift ſupernaturally
given vs by God, when he calleth vs, and therefore ſaith
Chriſt: That it is not given to every man to know the ſecretes of heaven,
Math. chap. 13. verſ. 11. ſhewing vs thereby, that the power to
knowe theſe things, is givē vs of God. Which is yet more cleere
by the ſpeech of Chriſt, touching them to whom this gift is not
given: when he ſayeth, that ſeeing, they doe not ſee, and hearing, they
heare not, neither vnderstande. And this worke of God in the ſcriptures,
is ſignified, by opening of the eyes of our vnderſtanding:
Epheſ. chapt. 1. ver. 18. and ſometymes, by opening of the
heart: Actes. chapt. 16. ver. 14. And in this firſte worke of God,
by his grace, conſiſteth the chiefe foundation of our ſtrength:
as is ſhowen by Ioh. 1. Epi. chap. 5. verſ. 5. ſaying: VVho is it that
overcommeth the worlde: but hee that beleeveth that Ieſus is the ſonne of
God. As likewiſe this is the ſeale of out Adoption, as witneſſeth
the ſame Apoſtle, 1. Epi. chap. 5. ſaying: Every one that beleeveth that
Ieſus is the Chriſt: is borne of God. And thirdly, on this dependeth our
ereruall life: as witneſſeth Chriſt him ſelfe, Iohn chap. 17. ver. 3.
This is eternall life, that they knowe thee the onely true God: and whom thou

haſt ſent Ieſus Chriſt. and therefore, whoſoever is ignorant of this
point (and ſo much more they that impugne it) ſhal never inherit
eternall life: according to Chriſts owne teſtimonie, Ioh. ca. 8.
ver. 24. Therefore I ſaid vnto you, that ye shall die in your ſinnes: for except
yee beleeve that I am hee, yee shall die in your ſinnes.
               
               To conclude this point then, the firſt action of God in man,
and ſo the firſt gift beſtowed vpon the heart of man vnto life, is
the power and facultie, of conceyving, and knowing, God in
Chriſt the Saviour, as he is reveyled in the worde: accordinge
to the ſaying of Iohn, Epi. 5. 20. But we knowe, that that ſonne of God,
is come, and hath given vs a minde to knowe him that is true: and wee are in
him that is true, that is, in that his Sonne Ieſus Christ, this ſame is that very
true God, and that eternall life.
               
               The ſecond worke of God wherein our faith conſiſteth, is in
giving a wil to come to Chriſt, and to enioy him, &amp; to obey him
according to the ſaying of the Prophet, Pſalm. 110. 3. Thy people
shall come willingly, at the time of the aſſemblinge of thine armie in holy
beautie.
               
               For as the vnderſtanding power of man, is darkened, &amp; al his
wiſdome, is but fooliſhnes: ſo his will, is rebellious againſt Gods
will, in all thinges. ſo that as he cannot naturally perceyve, nor
know, the thinges of God: ſo can he not naturally will, nor deſire,
the thinges of God. and this oftentymes is ſignified in ſcripture,
by the hardnes of mans heart that cannot repent: and by
his ſtiff-neckednes, and by reſiſting of the holy Ghoſt, according
to the words of God by the Prophet Eſay, ca. 65. ver. 2. &amp; 3. I have
ſpred my hands out all the day, to a rebellious and gaine-ſaying people, &amp;c.
And this worke of God is expreſſed in ſcripture, by the phraſe of
Gods drawing vs, Ion. 6. 44. No man can come vnto me, except the Father
that hath ſent me, drawe him. as likewiſe is ſignified by the opening
of the eare: as Eſay cha. 50. ver. 5. The Lord GOD hath opened
myne eare, and I was not rebellious, neyther turned I backe. This alſo is
ſignified by the Lord, Ier. 32. when he promiſeth, that he would
put his feare in their heartes, that they ſhould not departe from
him: and moſt cleerly, Eze. cap. 36. 26. 27. A newe heart alſo will I

give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you: and I will take away the ſtonie
heart out of your body, and will give you a heart of flesh, and I will put my ſpirit
within you, and cauſe you to walke in my Statutes. For this cauſe it is,
that Chriſt calleth them bleſſed, who honger and thirſt for righteouſnes:
For it is moſt certaine, that the earneſt deſire of the
heart, to enioye Chriſt and his righteouſnes, &amp;c. is an vndoubted
token of Gods ſaving grace, and of his effectuall calling, in
the which he beſtowes this, as a ſupernaturall gift, vppon the elect,
as the ſeconde effect, of his working power, whereby hee
changeth our willes, which are of them ſelves rebellious, and
maketh them willing to come vnto Chriſt, and to obey his
voyce. Therefore is it ſaide, That God is the worker, both of the
will, and of the deed, of his good pleaſure in vs, Phil. cap. 2. 13.
ſo this is the ſecond parte of that ſupernatural gift of faith, when
as our will maketh choiſe of that which is the will of God, and
wee ſubmit our willes to his will in all thinges, which is moſt
contrarie to the nature of fleſhe. For as ſayth the Apoſtle, Rom.
chap. 8. ver. 7. The wiſedome of the fleshe, is not ſubiect to the Law of God,
neither can be. Therefore doeth the Prophet David ſay: That the man
is bleſſed, whom the Lord choſes, and cauſes to come, Pſalm. 65. 4. It is for
this ſame cauſe, that David prayeth ſo often: that God would
incline his heart to his ſtatutes.
               The thirde parte of Gods workinge in givinge Faith vnto
vs, is the ſanctification of our affections, to make vs to love
Chriſt above all thinges, and that by the powring of his love
in our heartes by his holy Spirit: For as hee inclineth our
myndes to mynde heavenly thinges, by inſinuatinge his mynd
towardes vs in Chriſt Ieſus into our myndes, &amp; as by the ſenſe,
and feelinge, and proofe of his good will towarde vs in all
thinges, hee drawes out willes vnto his will: So by the ſenſe of
his love, in his giving his deare Sonne to the death for vs, while
wee were his enimies, hee enflames our heartes with the love
of him againe, ſo that with our affection, wee are ſet vppon
Chriſt more then all thinges, and are content to loſe all things,
that we may gaine him.
               Therefore ſaith Chriſt, Math. cha. 10. ver. 37. He that loveth father,

or mother, better then mee: is not worthie of me, &amp;c. And Luke chap. 14.
ver. 26. If any man come vnto mee, and hate not his Father, and Mother, &amp;
VVife, and Children, and Brethren and Siſters, yea and his owne life alſo: he
can not be my Diſciple. Wherein it appeareth moſt plainly, that faith
is a gift ſupernaturall: ſeeing it bringeth a ſupernaturall love
into the heart, which overcommeth all the love and affection,
which can be in nature: eſpecally when it overcommeth the
love of man to him ſelfe, and his owne life.
               Fourthly, the Lord by working faith, doeth imprinte his
knowledge, and his will, and love to vs, in our memories, working
ſuch a ſtedfaſt impreſſion in our hearts, of his mercie and
grace, towards vs in Chriſt, as can never be defaced: therefore
the wicked in the booke of God are noted by this name, they that
forget God. whereas the childrē of God have him alwayes before
theit eyes. Thus the Lord when he worketh faith in our hearts,
he worketh it in all the powers of our ſoule, filling the whole
heart with ſuch ſupernaturall vertue, and power, in all the faculties
thereof, whereby the heart, which of it ſelfe naturally
could never be able to knowe, or to deſire, or to love, or to
keepe any heavenly thing belonging vnto life and godlines: is
made able both to knowe, and to will, and to love, and with
the will, and affection, to apprehende, and to keepe conſtantly
the Lord Ieſus, and all bleſſings in him vnto eternall life.
               And all theſe pointes are wrought by God, in the heart of everie
one of his elect, particularly, as in them ſelves ſo alſo concerning
them ſelves, ſo that their knowledge, and aſſurance of
the trueth of the things reveyled, touching Chriſt, and redemption
in him, is not a generall notion, &amp; perſwaſion of the heart,
that God hath given his ſonne to be a Redeemer to mankinde,
and that he hath performed redemption in his death: for ſuch a
faith not onely the reprobate, but Sathan him ſelfe, hath, but it is
a particular ſight, and aſſurance of every mans owne heart, concerning
him ſelfe, that God hath elected him, &amp; for him in particular
hath given Chriſt, to bee a Redeemer, and hath made
him particularly vnto him wiſedome, righteouſnes, ſanctification,
and redemption.
               
                  
For it is not my faith-concerning the minde of God vnto others,
nor yet of the minde of God conceyved generally toward
all his elect, but the particular knowledge, and aſſurance, of his
minde concerning my ſelfe, that doeth ſaue mee: For the iuſt shall
live by his owne faith, Habac. chapt. 2. ver. 4. But this will appeare
more cleerely in the next point: while we conſider Faith, being
newe wrought in our hearts, howe we are ſaide with our heart
to beleeve.
               In this point we have to conſider: Firſt, that it is the man
him ſelfe who beleeveth: Secondly, that it is his heart whereby
he beleeveth: And thirdly, beleeving is the action which man
performeth with his heart.
               As for the firſt, man is ſaid to beleeue, becauſe that this ſupernaturall
gift is given him of God, and that in his heart it is effectuall
in him in all the points foreſpoken: for by Gods enlightning
of him, he ſees, and by his teaching, he vnderſtandes, and
by the Lords enclining of his will, he willeth, and by the Lords
ſanctifying of his affection, he loveth, and by the Lords imprinting,
and writing, in his minde, and ſealing by his ſpirit, whatſoever
he reveyleth vnto him, he both poſſeſſeth, retayneth, and
keepeth, Chriſt and all the bleſſings promiſed in him: ſo that
faith actively conſidered, is nothing but the motion of mans
hearte, which is wrought in him by the ſpirit of God: and therfore
in ſubſtance, nothing els but the very action of GOD in
man: but conſidered in a divers manner, that is, paſſively, as it
is wrought by God in him, and actively, as he by this working
of God, in all the powers of his ſoule, apprehendeth, and receyveth
grace from God: ſo that the action of man in beleeving
with the heart, is nothing but his knowing, &amp; acknowledging
of things, by Gods making him know, and acknowledge them,
and his willing them, by Gods making him to will them, and
his loving, by Gods making him to love them, and his apprehending
and retayning them, by Gods making of him to apprehende
and reteyne them, GOD imprinting, writing, and ſealing
them in mans heart: This worke therefore of man, is likewiſe
attributed vnto God vnder theſe two phraſes. Firſt, when

it is ſaide, that he giveth vs to come vnto the ſonne, Iohn chap. 6. ver. 65.
Secondly, the Fathers giving vs vnto the ſonne, Iohn. chap. 6.
ver. 37. and 17. 6.
               Thus the motion of man with his heart being moved of God,
is called mans beleeving with the heart, evē as a wheele which
of it ſelfe cānot move, yet being moved by an other, doth move,
whoſe motion therefore though it be but one, yet is ſaid to bee
the motion of two, that is of the maner, and of the thing moved:
and therefore is both actively, and paſſively to be conſidered: in
the one ſenſe God is ſaid to bring vs vnto Chriſt: in the other
ſenſe we are ſaide to come vnto Chriſt. and this is carefnlly to
be marked, leaſt with a great many we erre, in eſteeming faith
to be mans owne proper worke, flowing from the natural power
of his owne will, and ſo miſtake the ſaying of the Prophet,
the iuſt shall live by his owne faith: as alfo Chriſtes forme of ſpeach,
when he ſayeth, thy faith hath ſaved thee, for faith is called ours,
and our owne, not in reſpect that we are the Authors, the cauſe,
or workers of it: but becauſe we poſſeſſe it, and are the ſpeciall
ſubiectes of it, in the which it is wrought by God, as alſo becauſe
it concerneth onr ſelves in particular, and what wee beleeve,
wee beleeve it particularly touching our ſelves, ſo that
faith is called our owne faith in the Scriptures of God, to declare
the perticular nature of ſavinge faith in two particular
thinges: The firſte is, that it is not the faith that GOD workes
in another mans hearte, but the faith which hee worketh in
myne owne hearte, that ſaveth me.
               Secondly, it is not the faith which I have in myne owne
hearte, concerning others, but the faith that I have concerning
my ſelfe in particular, that ſaveth me. So that this worde vſed
by the Spirit of God, ſaying: thy faith hath ſaved thee, and the
iuſt by his owne faith shall live, is ſet downe, not to deſigne the
cauſe, but the ſubiect, of ſavinge faith: and that in two reſpectes,
that is, both in reſpect of him in whom it is wrought,
and alſo in reſpect of him concerning whom it is wrought: ſo
that my faith that ſaveth mee, muſt bee wrought by GOD in
my owne hearte: and what hee maketh mee beleeve, hee

muſt make mee beleeve it concerninge my ſelfe in particnlar.
               If the Papiſtes did rightly vnderſtande this, they would ſee
that every particnlar Chriſtian, hath a particular warrant, by
particular revelation from God, of the certaintie of his owne
ſalvation: For when hee ſaide, to beleeue with the heart: the
ſame beleeving, includes in it a particular knowledge, by the
particular revelation of God in his heart cōcerning him ſelfe in
particular, that hee is choſen and elected of God, that Chriſt
is given for him, that in him hee is redeemed, that in him hee
hath remiſſion of his ſinnes, that through him, hee ſhalbe glorified.
               Secondly, they ſhould likewiſe knowe, and with them ſuch
as in the Church of God, follow their opinion: that when it is
ſaide, that man with the heart beleeveth, the heart is not to bee
eſteemed the cauſe of beleeving, as though naturally of it ſelfe
it could beleeve, but as a wheele moved by another, doth move:
ſo our heartes action of beleeving, is nothing but the action of
God moving our heartes.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               NOW it followeth that we ſpeake of the vſe, and ende,
wherefore this ſupernatural gift is given vnto man: this
ſhortlie we may reduce vnto foure points.
               The firſt is, faith is given for knowledge.
               Secondly, faith is given for poſſeſſion of the things knowen.
               Thirdly, faith is given for keeping, and conſtant retayning,
the things poſſeſſed, and that during this life.
               Fourthly, faith is given for practiſe.
               Wee ſaye, that it is given for theſe vſes, during the time of
this life: becauſe, that in the life to come, both knowledge,
poſſeſſion, and keeping, are performed in vs by another meane,
that is by ſight: For in this worlde wee walke by faith, and
therefore doe neither knowe, poſſeſſe, nor keepe but by faith:

but in the world to come, we ſhall walke by ſight, for we ſhall
ſee him as he is: and therefore we ſhall both knowe, poſſes, and
keepe by ſight.
               Now concerning the firſt vſe and end of faith which is knowledge,
we are to remember the ſaying of the Apoſtle 1. Corinth.
chap. 2. ver 9. the things which God hath prepared for his elect,
are ſuch which the eyes of man hath not ſeene, and which the eare hath not
heard, &amp; which hath not entred in the hart of man. Whereby the Apoſtle
will declare vnto vs, that the thinges which God hath ordayned
for our glory, are ſuch, as the heart of man can never poſſibly
of it ſelfe conceyve: therefore as ſayeth the Apoſtle Iohn▪
God muſt needes give vs a minde to knowe them, before wee
ever can perceyve them, and this minde that God giveth is a
beleeving heart: For the heart of man, is able by faith to know
thinges, to will, &amp; affect thinges, to enioye, and poſſeſſe things,
and to keepe and retayne them, which of it ſelfe by all the power
of reaſon, will. &amp;c. it never could, nor poſſibly can, bee able,
to knowe, poſſeſſe, &amp;c. Thus we ſaye by faith, that the worlde
was made by the word of God: and that thinges that are ſeene▪
were made of thinges which did not appeare, Hebr. chapt. 11.
which all the Philoſophers, and Princes of the world, by all the
light of nature, could never vnderſtand. For the things of God,
are not naturally, but ſpiritually, diſcerned: therefore the naturall
man, can not perceyve them. In the ſame ſenſe, Abraham is
ſaide to have ſeene the day of Chriſt, and to have reioyced: and
by the vertue of our faith it is, that we knowe IESVS to be that
Chriſt, and the ſonne of God: and by faith we knowe, that we
are elected of God: and by faith we knowe, that in Chriſt alone
conſiſteth our adoption, our righteouſnes, fanctification, and
redemption: ſo that wee knowe, that it is impoſſible to any
man, to be the ſonne of God, or iuſt, or holy, or free from death,
but in, and by Chriſt onely: thus take me away faith from the
heart, it is impoſſible to all the wiſedome of the wiſeſt hearte,
ever to vnderſtande theſe thinges, and to know them for vndoubted
verities: therefore it is (as wee haue marked before)
that Chriſt ſayeth to Peter: Flesh and bloud hath not reveyled that vnto

thee: but my Father that is in heaven, Math. chap. 16. For this cauſe
Chriſt ſayth vnto the Iewes: Except yee beleeve that I am bee: yee shall
die in yonr ſinn
                        ••
                     . Shewing vs by that ſpeech, that there is no way
to knowe Chriſt to be the ſonne of God, but by beleevinge
onely.
               Nowe this knowledge that commeth by faith, is not to bee
taken in that ſenſe, wherein ſometymes the worde knowledge
is put: which is when it ſignrfieth the naked, and bare vnderſtanding
of thinges that are reveyled: but it is taken for an infallible
ſcience, when as the heart knoweth God, and knoweth
him vndoubtedly to be God: and when as it knoweth Chriſt▪
and knoweth him vndoubtedly to bee the ſonne of God: and
when it knoweth Gods trueth, and knoweth it vndoubtedly to
be the trueth of God: therefore ſaieth Iohn the Baptiſt, Hee that
receyveth his teſtimonie, hath ſealed that God is true, Iohn chap. 3. ver.
33 And againe, Iohn 1. Epi. chap. 5. ver. 10. Hee that heleeveth not
God, hath made him a liar, becauſe he beleeved not the record that God witneſſed
of his ſoune.
               
               Neither is this all which is meant by the knowledge of faith,
but a third thing is yet to be added for the full vnderſtandinge
thereof: For beſides the ſight, and knowledge, of the thinges
which are reveiled by God, and alſo beſides the knowledge of
the vndoubted veritie, and trueth of them, it is required, that
wee knowe them to bee reveyled by God vnto vs, and knowe
the vndoubted trueth, and veritie, of them toward vs in our particular
perſon, that is, that whatſoever God reveyle to vs, he reveyleth
it vnto vs as a thing which he hath appointed for vs:
and when he giveth vs the ſight, and knowledge of the vndoubted
veritie of the things reveyled: he maketh vs aſſuredlie
to knowe, that they ſhalbe truely &amp; verily accompliſhed in our
perſons, conforme to that ground which we have laide downe
before concerning faith: that is, that what we beleeve, we muſt
beleeve it concerning our ſelves in particular: according as it
is ſaid of Abraham, that he beleeved God that he ſhould bee the
Father of many Nation
                     •
                  s: And as Iob ſpeaketh of him ſelfe,
chap. 19. verſes 25. 26. 27. I am ſure that my Redeemer liveth: and I

shall ſee God in my flesh, whom I my ſelfe shall ſee, and my eyes shall beholde,
and none other for mee. According to which certaintie, the Apoſtle
Paul ſpeaketh alſo of him ſelfe, Rom. chap. 8. and for this maner
of knowledge which commeth by faith, the Fathers doe call
faith, the eye whereby we ſee the inviſible things of God, as alſo
the ingravē forme of the ſonnes of God: and for this ſame cauſe
it is called by the Apoſtle Heb. chap. 11. the evidence of things which
are not ſeene. where by the word evidence, is vnderſtoode, that faith
doeth not onely ſhew them, but by evident demonſtration confirme
the vndoubted veritie of them, and that to vs in particular:
ſo that it letteth me not only ſee life eternall in Chriſt, and
this eternall life to belong to all that are in Chtiſt, but particularly
it letteth me ſee my ſelfe in Chriſt, and this life to belonge
to me in him: and that ſo certainlie, as nothing in heaven nor
earth, can bee more certaine: and thus much for the firſt vſe of
faith.
               The ſeconde ende wherefore faith is given is poſſeſſion:
and this confirmeth evidently and plainely the former ground
touching knowledge, that it is ſo to be vnderſtood, as we have
ſpoken: For the knowledge of faith is never without poſſeſſion,
according to thar ſaying of Chriſt, Ioh. cha. 14. ver. 17. ſpeaking
of the ſpirit, whow the world can not receyve, becauſe it ſeeth him
not, neyther knoweth him: but yee knowe him, for hee dwelleth with you,
and shalbee in you. According to which ground it is, that Ioh. ſayth:
Hee that beleeveth in that ſonne of GOD, hath the witnes in him ſelf,
1. Epiſt. chap. 5. ver. 10. Thus faith maketh vs to know nothing,
but that which it alſo maketh vs to poſſeſſe: therefore doeth the
Apoſtle pray to God for the Epheſians, that Chriſt might dwell in their
hearts by faith, chap. 3. verſ. 27.
               For as the heart of man, can never know Chriſt by it owne
light, but by the ſupernaturall light of faith: ſo it can never apprehend
Chriſt, nor any bleſſing in Chriſt, by any natural power
that is in the will &amp; affection thereof. Therefore God giveth
to his elect the ſupernaturall gift of faith in their hearts, that his
elect, whoſe heartes could never by any naturall ſtrength, ever
attaine to the poſſeſſion of Chriſt, nor ever deſire to have him,

nor yet embrace him with vnfayned love, as their only treaſure,
righteouſnes, and life, might choſe him, and count all things but
dunge to gaine him, forſaking them ſelves and their owne righteouſnes,
and to love him, and embrace him, with ſuch affectiō,
that they prefer him to all things, evē to their owne life: ſo that
man by faith is not only made to know his redeemer: but alſo to
poſſeſſe him, and all bleſſings in him. And for this cauſe is it, that
in the ſcriptures we are ſaide, to be the children of God by faith
in Chriſt: to be iuſtified by faith in him: to bee ſaved by faith in
him: and as ſaith the Apoſtle Peter, beleeving in him, we carrie
about with vs the end of our faith, the ſalvation of our ſoules, 1.
Epiſt. 1. 9. And for this working of faith, it is called by the Apoſtle
the ſubſiſting of things hoped for. Hebr. 11. 1. becauſe it giveth
a certaine being, and ſubſiſting, vnto things that are yet inviſible,
and are yet only expected, and hoped for: and maketh
thē to ſubſiſt in our hearts: therfore ſaith Chriſt, he that beleeveth, is
alreadie tranſlated from death to life: and hath everlaſting life, Ioh. 5. 24.
               Thus we ſee, that faith being taken away, the heart of man
ſhould never be able to poſſeſſe, nor apprehend Chriſt, nor righteouſnes,
or any other ſpirituall bleſſing in him.
               Therefore, becauſe it is the effectuall inſtrument of Gods ſupernaturall
power in our heartes, whereby we apprehende and
poſſeſſe Chriſt, and all bleſſings in him: The Fathers doe call it
the hand of a Chriſtian, as alſo the mouth of a Chriſtian, and
likewiſe the bound of a Chriſtian: becauſe by faith, as by a hand,
we lay holde on him, and by faith, as by a mouth, wee receyve
him into our heartes, and by faith, as by a bande that never can
be broken, wee are ſo vnited to him, and hee, with all the benefites
that are in him, vnto vs: that we never can poſſibly bee ſeperated
from him, nor he or his bleſſinges from vs: for this cauſe
is it, that Auguſtine ſayth, Beleeue onely, and thou haſt eaten him.
               
               And for cleering of this grounde, it is that theſe phraſes of
ſpeech are vſed, to wit, that Chriſt is the ende of the lawe vnto
righteouſnes, to all that beleeve: that the promiſe is given to
them, that faithfully beleeve: That the Goſpell is the power
of GOD vnto ſalvation, to everie one that beleeveth, &amp;c.

all to teach vs, that neither the Goſpell can helpe vs to ſalvation,
neither is the promiſe made ours, nor Chriſtes righteouſnes
belongeth vnto vs, except we beleeve: becauſe there is no mean
to make any thing conteyned in the Goſpell (eſpecially the promiſe,
or Chriſt him ſelfe) to be ours: but faith onely. And for
this ſame cauſe, our righteouſnes is ſaide to bee the righteouſnes of
God, which is by faith: and the righteouſnes which is through the faith of
Chriſt, Phil. chap. 3. ver. 9. And Chriſt is ſaide, to bee a reconciliation
through faith in his bloud, Rom. chap. 3. ver. 25. All ſerving to teach
vs, that faith is not our righteouſnes it ſelfe: but only the meane
by the which we attayne to that which is our righteouſnes, that
is Chriſt in his bloud: for in that ſenſe is righteouſnes faid to be
through faith, and by faith.
               Moreover, it is for this ſame cauſe, that faith is called in the
Scriptures the faith of Chriſt, Rom. chap. 3. where righteouſnes
is ſaide to be, the righteouſnes of God by the faith of Ieſus. and that becauſe
the whole matter, and ſubſtance, which by faith wee eyther
knowe, or apprehende vnto righteouſnes, is onely Chriſt:
               Sometimes it is called the faith of his name, Acts cha. 3. ver. 16.
as alſo the faith in his name, as Ioh. chap. 1. ver. 12. becauſe all
the vertue, ſtrength, and power, whereby we beleeve to bee iuſtiſied,
is in Chriſt alone, and in the vertue of his death, and reſurrection:
ſo that the vertue is not in faith it ſelfe, but in Ieſus
apprehended by faith.
               Sometimes againe it is called the faith towardes Chriſt, Act.
chap. 20. ver. 21. becauſe faith ſetteth nothing before it as the
obiect, but Chriſt alone: for the Goſpell which is the worde of
faith, propoundeth not any thing vnto vs, but onely Chriſt, as
eyther promiſed, or given vnto vs of God, to bee the matter eyther
of our righteouſnes, ſanctification, or redemption.
               Sometimes againe it is called the faith in Chriſt, Gal. chap. 3.
ver. 26. and that for two cauſes. Firſt, becauſe that wherein by
faith our heartes are faſtened, and in the which our heartes only
ſetleth their full confidence of righteouſnes, and remiſſion of
ſinnes, is onely Chriſt, in whom onely, our faith is, and we alſo
by faith: for thereby we are made to be in him, and hee in vs:

and therfore in the ſcripturs to be in Chriſt, &amp; to be in the faith,
are put indifferently, Rom. cha. 8. verſ. 10. compared with 2.
Cor. cha. 13. ver. 3. 5. And for this ſame reſpect, the proper effectes
of Chriſt him ſelfe, are attributed vnto faith. The ſecond
Reaſon is, becauſe faith neither ſuffereth vs to reſt vpon it, nor
on our ſelues, nor on anie other thing, nor yet in any thing that
is in faith, or in our ſelves, or in any thing except Chriſt onely,
and that which is in him, as the ground of our confidence, or
as the matter of our righteouſnes or bleſſednes: therefore are
we ſaide in him to have redemption, in him to be made righteouſnes,
and in him to be circumciſed. For whatſoever we are
made by Faith, we are made it in Chriſt: and what ſoever faith
maketh to be ours, it is alſo in Chriſt: therefore faith maketh
not God our God, but in Chriſt: nor vs the children of God, but
in Chriſt: nor righteous but in Chriſt, &amp;c. For whatſoever faith
layeth holde on, it findeth it in Chriſt: ſo that the hart of man,
when it beleeveth vnto righteouſnes, ſendeth out faith, &amp;
fixeth it in Chriſt, thereby laying holde vpon him, and his obedience
vnto righteouſnes: bringing him, and his obedience,
with all the vertue both of his death, and life, into our heartes
to dwell in them.
               Sometimes alſo it is called the faith by Chriſt: becauſe hee
is the Author, Fountayne, and occaſion of it, not ſo much becauſe
he with the Father, and holy Ghoſt, doeth worke it, as
becauſe hee alone is the meane, and occaſion of it: For as the
Father redeemeth vs by Chriſt, and by him maketh vs his ſons,
and righteouſnes, &amp;c. ſo alſo he maketh vs to beleeue by Chriſt
ſo that take mee away Chriſt, all ground and foundation of ſaving
faith in God is taken away: for God hath layde the whole
foundation of our beleefe in him alone. For which cauſe Pet.
1. Epiſt. chap. 1 ver. 21. ſayeth: That by his meanes wee beleeve in G
                        •
                     d:
and in that ſame place it is ſaide. That God hath rayſed him from the
dead, and given him glorie, that our faith and hope might bee in God. And
to this ſame effect the ſame Apoſtle ſayeth in the ſame chapter,
ver. 3. That God hath begotten vs againe to a lively hope: by the reſurrection
of Ieſus Chriſt from the dead.
               
               
                  
Vpon which reſpect it is, that the Apoſtle Paul 1. Cor. chap. 15.
ver. 17. ſayeth expreſly: If Chriſt bee not rayſed, your faith is vayne.
Vpon which we may eaſilie gather, that faith, is a vaine fooilſh
faith, whereby a man is made to beleeve, or hope for any bleſſing
from God, which maketh it not firſt to bee performed by
God in Chriſt. For our faith of our vniō with God ariſeth vpon
the knowledge of Chriſt his aſſuming in vnitie of perſon, our
nature vnto his: the faith of our being the ſonnes of God, ariſeth
vpon Chriſt the man our brother being the very ſonne of
GOD: our faith that God will make vs righteouſnes, ariſeth
vpō this, that God hath made Chriſt ſinne for vs: and ſo foorth
of the reſt, the hope of our reſurrection, is builded vpon his reſurrection:
the hope of our aſſention, vpon his aſſention: the
hope of our glorification, vpon his glorification: ſo that the
Lord worketh in our heartes, neither faith, nor hope in him, of
any bleſſing whatſoever, whereof hee doeth not firſt reveyle
vnto vs, a cleere ground, and evident foūdation in Ieſus Chriſt
the ſonne.
               And therefore it may appeare how deteſtable a doctrine that
is (and execrable be the teachers of it) that affirmeth, that a man
may be ſaved without the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.
               Thus by all theſe phraſes concerning faith, the Lord would
teach vs, that Chriſt is the matter, and hee is the ground, of all
whatſoever wee beleeve: and that there is nothinge in Chriſt,
which is not made ours by faith.
               And for this ſame purpoſe in Scriptures it is ſometimes called
the faith in the bloud of Chriſt, Rom. chap. 3. ver. 25. and
that to teach vs, what is the particular thing in Chriſt, wherein
God hath made him our righteouſnes, and whereby the Lord
would haue vs to beleeve remiſſion of ſinnes in him: for albeit
Chriſt be vno vs, all, and that in all thinges, and doeth fill vs
all in all thinges: yet (as wee haue marked before) there is no
benefite which wee apprehende by faith in Chriſt, but it hath
the owne particular ground and foundation wherevpon it is
builded: and therefore as his faith is but vaine, who expects his
reſurrection in Chriſt, if he doe not know Chriſt to bee riſen againe:

ſo his faith muſt be vaine, who beleeveth the remiſſion
of ſinnes in Chriſt, and yet knoweth not that Chriſt did ſhed
his bloud expreſſely for his iniquities. For as God begettes vs
to the hope of life by the reſurrection of Ieſes from the dead: ſo
he begetteth vs to the faith, and aſſurance of the remiſſion of
our ſinnes, by making him ſinne for vs, and woundinge him
for our tranſgreſſions.
               So to conclude this point, albeit all bleſſing bee in Chriſt,
and he be made of God wiſedome, righteouſnes, ſanctification,
and redemptiō: yet all this ſhalbe in vaine to vs, except we beleeve,
becauſe there is no meanes in the world, whereby to obtaine
&amp; poſſeſſe Chriſt, or any bleſſing in him, except faith only:
               For as concerning the Word, and Sacraments, they are not ſo
much the meanes of our poſſeſſing Chriſt, as the meanes of our
faith whereby we poſſeſſe Chriſt.
               The third vſe and end wherefore faith is given, is keeping, &amp;
preſerving vs in the poſſeſſion which it hath brought vnto vs:
and that both becauſe through faith wee are kept vnto ſalvation,
as ſaieth Pet. 1. Epi. 1. 5. and alſo becauſe by it, wee keepe
Chriſt and all his bleſſings in our heart. For which cauſe the
ſcriptures place our victorie over Satan, ſinne and the world in
our faith, Ioh. 1. Epi. ca. 5. ver. 4. 5. and the Apoſt. Paul placeth the
chief ſtrength of a Chriſtlan in his faith, as that whereby we are
made able to quench all the fierie dartes of the Divell, Eph. 6.
16. ſo that there is no enemie of our ſalvation ſo great, neither
any temptation ſo vehement and fierie, which by faith wee are
not made able to overcome. Thus faith wrought in our heartes
by God, is of a ſtronger might, and power, then the Divel himſelfe,
and all the powers and principalities of darknes, therfore
Pet. 1. Ep. 5. willeth vs to reſiſt the divel, by being ſtedfaſt in the
faith, thereby to teach vs, that in a ſtedfaſt faith, there is ſtrēgth
to overcome him. The examples of the great power of God
which is 
                     •
                  n them that beleeve, ſet downe in Heb 11. doth ſu
                     ••
                  iciētly
cleer the truth hereof, who only by faith are ſaid to have
performed, &amp; ſuffered ſo ſtrange &amp; wonderful things, as no power
that ever nature hath given vnto man, was able either to
performe, or ſuffer.

This alſo is manifeſt, if we marke, another pointe, which is, the
Saintes recouering of them ſelves, when they have appeared,
to have bene overthrowen by Sathan in ſinne: who notwithſtanding
have by the ſtrength of faith, onely recovered victorie
over Sathan and ſinne. So when as in our practiſe, and obedience
to God, we fall moſt fearfully: yet by faith we not onely
overcome our owne guilthines, but alſo all the feare of Gods
iuſt deſerved wrath, for our guilthines: ſo that our verie ſinnes
cannot ſeperate our heartes that beleeve, from Chriſt, nor remove
the favour of God from vs. For whatſoever bleſſing wee
have once obtayned by faith, by that ſame ſaith wee are made
able to holde it faſt to the ende: and the faithfull heart ſayeth, as
Iob chap, 27. ver. 6. I will keepe my righteouſnes, and will not forſake it,
and my heart shall never cast it away all my dayes. Vpon this ground it
is, that the Apoſtle willeth Timothie, to fight the good fight of faith, 1.
Tim. chap. 6. verſ. 12. becauſe indeed our faith hath the greateſt
labour, in our ſpiriruall bataile. For when all other grace faileth
vs, yet faith muſt vpholde vs: otherwiſe we could not poſſibly
but periſh: For what ſhould have become of Pieter after
his fearefull fall, if faith had not ſuſtained him? This point is
yet more cleere, if we marke the ſtrength of faith in other two
thinges.
               The firſt is, if we ſhall conſider the examples of the children
of God, who have drawn from God manifold great bleſſinges
by faith: as their vncurable diſeaſes to bee cured: their dead to
be rayſed, &amp;c. Of which a lively example wee have in Math.
chap. 9. and Luke chap. 8. in the Woman that had an iſhewe of
bloud 12. yeares longe: and in the wordes of Chriſt vnto Iairus,
Luke chap. 8. ver. 50. where he ſaith, Feare not, beleeve onely,
and shee shalbe ſaved.
               
               The other thing to be conſidered of vs, is, when God himſelf
ſeemeth to ſet him ſelfe againſt his children, and they are compelled
to wreſtle with God, as with their owne enimie, yet by
faith they overcome &amp; ſay with Iob, 13. 15. Though hee ſlay me, yet
will I truſt in him. And this was liuely ſhadowed in the Lord his
wreſtling with Iacob, Gen. chap. 32. where it is ſaide, of the Lord,

that when he ſawe that he could not prevaile againſt Iacob, he
touched the hollowe of his thigh, &amp;c. therefore ſaieth the Prophet
Hoſe, cap. 12. ver. 3. 4. By his ſtrength, hee had power with God,
and had power over the Angell, and prevayled. And this the Lord ſetteth
downe expreſly, to ſhew vs that the power of God in him
that beleeveth, is able ſo to ſtrengthen him, that nothing is able
to overthrow him.
               To conclude this point, that which Angells by nature could
not doe in heaven, and that which Adam could not doe in Paradiſe,
a poore fraile wretch beleeving in the Lorde Ieſus, is
made able to doe, by the power of God, which dwelleth in his
heart by faith: for the verie weaknes of God, is ſtronger then
Men, and Angells, and it pleaſeth the Lorde to magnifie his
ſtrength, in our weaknes, that the excellencie of this worke,
may be knowen to be of him, and not of vs.
               For this cauſe, as the Scripture calleth faith our victorie, and
our ſhield, ſo the Fathers likewiſe cal it: and moreover the key
whereby the treaſures that are in Chriſt, are opened vnto vs, &amp;
the ladder by the which we climbe vp from earth to heauen.
               Now the laſt vſe, and end, wherefore Faith is given, is practiſe,
that is, to make vs able to doe the will of the Lord, and
obey his commandements: for man, whoſe imaginations are
nothing but vanitie, and that continually, and is of no ſtrength
of him ſelfe to performe any good worke, neyther is, nor can be
ſubiect to the lawe of God, having his minde continually ſett
on evill workes, &amp; having no goodnes at all dwelling in him,
is by this ſupernaturall gift of faith, made able to doe the will
of the Lord from the hearte: for thereby not onely is his darkened
vnderſtanding illuminate, that he may know what is that
good, acceptable, and perfect will of God: but alſo his rebellious
will ſubdued, to will and to doe, the will of the Lord, and
his whole affections ſanctified to love the lawe of God, and to
delight in it more then in all treaſures, and to eſteeme it more
precious, then gold. For by faith he is buried with Chriſt, and
alſo hee is rayſed vp with Chriſt by the faith of the effectuall
working of God, who rayſed Chriſt from the dead, Coloſ. chap.

2. ver. 13. For which cauſe alſo the Apoſtle Paul to the Ephe. ca.
2. ſhewing what is the exceeding power of God in thē that beleeve,
ſaieth: That we that were dead in ſinnes, are through the grace of
God by faith quickened, rayſed, and made to ſit together in heaven in Christ
Jeſus: therefore alſo ſaith Iohn 1. Epiſt. 5. That the commandements
of God, are not greevous to him that is borne of God. And he addeth this
reaſon takē from the former ground, which is, becauſe by faith
they overcome the world, and all thinges whatſoever within
them, or without them, oppoſeth it ſelfe vnto their obedience.
               For this cauſe, the obedience of the Saints is called the obedience
of faith, Rom. cha. 1. ver. 5. and obedience to the Goſpel,
is called obedience to the faith, Acts cha. 6. ver. 7. And for the ſame
reaſon, whatſoever is not of faith, is ſaid to be ſinne, Rom. cha. 14. 23.
as alſo That without faith, it is impoſsible to pleaſe God. Heb. chap. 11. 6.
which ſentence ſheweth cleerely the trueth of this point, that
there can be no ſtrength in mans nature, to performe any thing
according to the will of God, of it ſelfe: but that all his ſtrength
and abilitie, to doe according to Gods minde, is from IESVS
Chriſt dwelling in his hearte by faith. By whoſe helpe ſtrengthening
vs, we are able to doe all things, as ſaith the Apoſtle of him ſelfe, Phil.
chap. 4. ver. 13. Vpon the ſame reſpect it is, that the Apoſtle interpretes
his owne ſaying, That Chriſt liueth in him, in this ſpeech,
The life that I nowe live in the flesh, I liue it by the faith which is of the ſonne
of God, Galat. chap. 2. ver. 20. ſhewing vs that to haue Chriſt living
in vs, and to liue by the faith of Chriſt, is all one thing, albeit
in divers conſiderations: for our life is the life of Chriſt
properlie, becauſe indeed from him alone floweth al goodnes,
and in him is the vertue of our well doing: but our life, is the
life of faith not properlie, but becauſe it is the meane, by the
which onely Chriſt (who is our life) dwelleth in our heartes,
and liveth in vs.
               This thing it is, that maketh one and the ſelfe ſame action,
externally performed (according to the cōmandement) by two
diverſe perſons, to be acceptable obedience to God in the one,
and abhominable wickednes and ſinne in the other: according

to the ſpeech of the Apoſtle touching the ſacrifices of Cain and
Abel, becauſe the one did offer in faith, the other not.
               Now in reſpect of this fruit and efficacie of faith, the Fathers
doe call faith, the ſeale of our election, conforme to that of Peter,
2. Epi. chap. 1. who willeth vs by the vertue that is in our
faith, to make our calling and election ſure: as alſo they call it
the ſoule of our ſoule, becauſe as our ſoule quickeneth our bodies,
ſo doth faith our ſoules: alſo they call it the root of a good
life: by which all fruit is good, and without the which all fruit
is rotten and corrupted.
               Of all theſe things which we have ſpoken of faith, wee may
eaſily perceive that faith is neither a parte, nor portiō of any naturall
power, or facultie in man: neither the effect, or work of anie
power or facultie naturall in man, neither ſerving for any
naturall vſe, in any naturall thing vnto man: but that it is a gift
ſupernaturall, given freely by God, and wrought ſupernaturallie
above al naturall power in our hearts, vnto a ſupernaturall
end, that we might be able to obtaine, and to performe things
which by nature it is impoſſible that we either cā obtain or do.
               And this ſupernatural gift is placed in our harts by God, as the
effectual inſtrument &amp; mean of his power: whereby ro make vs
able to be capable of heavenly and ſupernatural things, and to
performe heauenly and ſupernaturall obedience to God.
               Of which it is evident, that faith is the firſt bleſſing in order of
all the bleſſings of God, &amp; alſo that no other bleſſing is eyther
poſſeſſed by vs, or preſerued in vs, but by it alone: ſo that it is
not ſo much any parte of the matter of our bleſſednes, as it is the
mean &amp; inſtrument of it: ſo that our righteouſnes, life, and glorie,
doth not conſiſt in it, but rather ſubſiſteth in vs by it.
               Of theſe things we may collect what faith is, both as God worketh
it in vs, &amp; as our hearts worketh by it: as God worketh it
in our harts, it is a ſupernatural gift, wrought by God of his free
grace in al the powers of our ſoule, to be the effectual inſtrumēt
of his power in vs, whereby our heartes are made able both to
perceyve, &amp; to embrace, and conſtantly to keepe Chriſt and all
ſpirituall bleſſings in him, belonging to life &amp; godlines of life,
as alſo to be able to walke worthie of our heavenly calling.
               
                  
As our heart worketh by it, faith is the very motion of all
the powers of our hart, wrought by the former working of God
in them, whereby our heartes now beleeving, lay holde vpon
the promiſe, and vpon Chriſt crucified for vs, and vpon righteouſnes,
and life in him, and whereby all theſe are brought into
our heartes, and wee poſſeſſed with them, and whereby the
things poſſeſſed, are kept in our heartes, in the middeſt of all
temptation, overcomming all our ſpirituall enemies, and
whereby our hearts doe ſerve God ſo, as to pleaſe him.
               And vpon this worke of faith, follow theſe effectes in our
ſoules: Firſt our heartes reioyce, bo
                     ••
                   in the ſight of the ſalvation,
and in the hope of the glory of God, Pſalm. 105. 4. 5. Rom.
chap. 5. ver. 2. Secondly, our hearts are filled, with a confident
boldnes towardes God, that wee dare drawe neare vnto him
confidentlie, and call him Abba Father, Rom. chap. 8. ver, 15. Gal.
chap. 5. ver. 6. Ephe. chap. 3. ver. 12. Heb. chapt. 4. ver. 16. and
chap. 10. ver 16. Thirdly, our heartes are filled with the peace
of God, and a good conſcience, Rom. chapt. 5 ver. 1. Iohn
chap. 14 ver. 1. ſo that, in patience we poſſeſſe our ſoules, wayting
for that bleſſed hope, and that appearing of the glorie of
that mightie God, and of Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour, and this is
the firſt gift that God in iuſtifying giveth a ma
                     •
                  .
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               NOW it followeth, that we ſpeake of the ſeconde gift,
whereby we are iuſtified: and that is Chri
                     •
                  t Ieſus himſelfe.
For God firſt giveth vs faith vnto righteouſnes, and
then by faith he giveth vs Chriſt as our righteouſnes: therefore
is Chriſt alſo called the gift of God, and that in two reſpectes.
               Firſt, in reſpect of Gods ſending him into the worlde, to ſuffer
the death of the croſſe, and by his death to redeeme vs: in
which reſpect, it is ſaide, That God ſo loved the world, that hee hath given
his onely begotten ſonne, &amp;c. Iohn chap. 3. ver. 16.
               Secondly, in reſpect of Gods particular giving of Chriſt now
crucified vnto the beleeving heart: according to which the

Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Coll. chap. 2. ver. 6. As therefore yee have receyved
Ghriſt Ieſus the Lorde, walke in him: and Rom. chap. 5. Our righteouſnes
is called the gift of God. For which cauſe alſo Chriſt is ſaid to dwel
in our heartes by faith: and of this gift it is that in this place
we ſpeake: for howſoever by the Fathers givinge Chriſt vnto
the death, the full redemption of all Gods elect was wrought:
Yet in our particular perſons we enioye it not, vntill wee bee
called of God: therefore Iuſtificatiō is placed after our calling,
Rom. chap. 8. and this giving of Chriſt, is the cauſe why God
firſte giveth vs faith: becauſe before we receyve faith, it is impoſſible
to vs to enioye Chriſt, becauſe we have neyther hande,
heart, nor will to receyve him: and in this gift, as wee have
ſhowen before, ſtandeth the matter of our righteouſnes, and the
forme of our iuſtification conſiſteth in parte in the giving of it:
and this is needfull to be marked of vs, for their cauſe that make
our iuſtification to conſiſt in Gods gracious acceptation of our
faith, and not in his gracious giving of faith vnto vs, and Chriſt
by faith. Touching this ſecond gift, which is Chriſt in his death
and bloud, I will ſpeake no more, the things preceeding ſerving
ſufficientlie to cleare it, and therefore we come to the next
pointe, wherein we have ſaid conſiſteth the forme of our iuſtification.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               THE ſecond thinge wherein conſiſteth the forme of our
iuſtification, is the Lords imputing of the thinges given
vnto vs: that is both of faith, and Chriſtes obedience:
and for the obſervation of the imputation of both, wee are to
marke theſe two phraſes. Firſt, where it is ſaide that faith is imputed
vnto righteouſnes, Rom. cha. 4. ver. 5. 9. Secondly, where
it is ſaide, that righteovſnes is imputed, Rom. chapt. 4. ver. 11.
For the one importes plainely the imputation of faith: the oher
importes the imputation of righteouſnes it ſelfe, which is
by faith. For we have alreadie ſhewen, that our faith is neither
our righteouſnes, nor called in the Scriptures our righteouſnes,

howſoever our righteouſnes be called the righteouſnes of the
faith of Ieſus, or by the faith of Ieſus: and it may be, that the
not obſerving hereof, hath made ſome worthie and learned Divines,
to denie al imputation of Chriſtes obedience, &amp; to maintaine
nothing to be imputed vnto vs but faith only, &amp; that not
(vnto) righteouſnes, but (as they interprete the worde 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  (for)
that is in the place of righteouſnes.
               For cleering of this point of Imputation, we will firſt ſpeake
of the word imputation what it ſignifieth.
               Secondly, what ſorte of things are ſaide to be imputed in the
Scriptures: whether thinges that are inherent in vs, or thinges
not inherent, or both.
               Thirdly, we will ſpeake of theſe things, which are ſaide in
ſcripture to be imputed to vs for our iuſtification.
               Concerning the firſt, the word it ſelfe ſignifieth the ſentence
of our iudgement, or reſolut opinion of his minde, and in this
ſenſe it is taken Rom. chap. 3. 28. as alſo Rom. 6. 11. Secondly, it
is referred to the reaſoning of the minde, and the diſputing of
the vnderſtanding, as Marke chap. 11. ver. 31. Thirdly, it is referred
to a mans purpoſing, or imagining, or plotting any
thing, as 1. Corint. chap. 13. ver. 5. Fourthly, it is referred to the
eſtimation, or accompt of the minde touching any thing, as
Acts chap. 19. ver. 27. in which ſenſe alſo it may be taken Mark,
15. 28. Luke chap. 22. ver. 37. Fiftly, it is re
                     •
                  erred to the laying
to a mans charge of any debt, or guiltines, as 2. Timoth. chap.
4. ver. 16. Laſtly, it is taken in a borrowed ſenſe, frō accompts
and reckonings, for accompting vnto a man, or reputing vnto
a man, and reckoning to a man any thing to bee his, or to be
good payement and ſatisfaction from him in his accompts: and
in this ſenſe is it taken in the matter of our iuſtification, when
as God eyther reckoneth that to be ours which is not ours, or
when hee eſteemeth and accompteth that ſufficient, which hee
giveth vs freely for our iuſtification before him.
               But in this ſenſe it appeareth, that there is a three folde difference
in mens taking of the meaninge of the worde imputation.
               
                  
The firſt is, when imputation is taken for naked acceptation
of a thing although in it ſelfe inſufficient, as ſufficient, by
God: and this maketh ſome men to define our iuſtification, to be
nothing els, but a gracious acceptation of our imperfect faith
by God, in place of perfect righteouſnes: but to this wee have
anſwered before, and certaine and ſure it is, that God receyves
no righteouſnes from vs, but gives righteouſnes vnto vs.
               The ſecond meaning is, when imputation is takē, not ſimply
for a naked acceptation of a thing whether in it ſelfe perfect or
imperfect: but for accompting that which is perfect righteouſnes
in it ſelfe, and yet is not ours, to be ours.
               The third ſenſe is, when imputation is ſo taken, that it ſignifieth,
not only the accompting or reckoning to vs as ours the
righteouſnes which is imputed, but ſo reckoneth and reputeth
it to vs as done by our ſelves.
               The firſt importeth no more, but the Lordes accompting:
and holding of a thing ſufficient, which notwithſtanding of it
ſelfe is not ſufficient, nor perfect righteouſnes: which opinion
can never be maintayned with Gods honour.
               The ſeconde, importeth not onely an accompting, and holding
of a thing, which in it ſelfe is ſufficient righteouſnes, to
bee full and perfect: but alſo an accomptinge of that perfect
righteouſnes vnto vs as ours, howſoever it bee onely Chriſtes:
ſo that this opinion taketh the word imputatiō ſo, as when God
reckoneth to vs that to be our righteouſnes, which in effect is
not our righteouſnes, but onely by his accompt and imputation.
               The third importeth that ſame, that the ſecond doeth, but in
a more ſtrict ſenſe, to wit, that God by imputing of Chriſts obedience
vnto vs, doeth not onely accompt it to be our righteouſnes,
but alſo doth accompt it as performed and done by vs: and
this ſentence though it ſeeme hard, and to derogate ſomething
to the honour of God, and praiſe of his grace, yet one word being
taken in a charitable (which alſo is a true) ſenſe, there ſhalbe
no fault foūd in the ſpeech. The word is (as) when it is ſaide that
the Lord imputeth Chriſtes obedience to vs, as if we had done

it our ſelves: which word is not to be taken, as though it imported,
that God did impute vnto vs. that wee had done this:
but oely is ſet downe by ſimilitude, to ſhewe the faithfulnes,
and trueth of Gods imputation: to wit, that GOD imputeth
Chriſtes righteouſnes, as truely to be ours, and as effectually to
iuſtifie vs, as it ſhould have done, if wee had in our owne perſons,
actually performed it. and in that ſenſe this ſpeech may
well be approoved.
               Moreover, it may be taken in good parte, even although we
take it in the ſtricteſt ſenſe ſpoken before: if wee conſider that
Ieſus Chriſt did beare all our perſons in his death, and therefore
he is ſaide in ſcriptures, to have died for vs: ſo that what he
did bearing our perſons even in the ſight of God, and dying for
vs even by the very appointement of God: that which hee did
for vs, and in our name, may not impertinentlie be ſaide to bee
imputed by God vnto vs, as done by vs▪
               
               But for myne owne iudgement, I eſteeme the firſt interpretation
of the word (as) to bee moſt ſounde, and agreeable to the
trueth, and beeing ſo taken, there ſhalbe no difference in ſubſtance,
betwixt the ſecond and third opinion, onely that which
is not expreſſed in the ſecond, but vnderſtood in the word imputation,
touching the trueth and effectualnes of it, is by ſimilitude
expreſſed in the third: and in this ſenſe it is to bee taken in
the matter of our iuſtification, and it declareth the forme of our
iuſtification, importing this much, that God iuſtifieth vs by accompting
vnto vs Chriſtes obedience, which is in it ſelfe perfect
righteouſnes: in ſuch ſorte, as by this his imputation, it is
ours as truely, and doeth as truely cleere vs before God, as if it
were our owne in deede, and we our ſelves in deed had performed
it.
               Thus we have need to take heed of two extremities, whereinto
it is evident that many men doe fall, in this point: ſome
taking imputation too ſlenderly, and others taking it too ſtrictlie,
each being to other the cauſe of others ſtumbling.
               Furthermore, wee ſhall vnderſtande the more cleerlie the
right meaning of the word imputation, if wee doe conſider it in

the two cōtrarie phraſes, wherein it is vſed al to one ſenſe in the
Scriptures. For ſometimes our iuſtification is deſcribed negatively,
by not imputing of ſinne: ſometimes affirmatively, by
imputing of righteouſnes: For as the word imputation is taken
in the negative phraſe, it muſt alſo be taken in the affirmative:
now in the negative, we may know how it is taken by the Apoſtle,
2. Cor. chap. 5. ver. 19. where it is ſaide: God was in Christ,
reconciling the world to him ſelfe, not imputing to them their ſinnes. As likewiſe
Pſal. 32. and Rom. chap. 4. where it is ſaide: Bleſied is the man
to whom the Lord imputeth not ſinne. In which places not imputing of
ſinne, ſignifieth the not reckoning vnto vs ſinne nor iniquitie,
and the not accompting of vs to be vnrighteous, and ſo the not
laying guiltines to our charge, nor exacting puniſhment of vs
for it: wherevpon it followeth, that imputation of righteouſnes,
muſt ſignifie the reckoning of righteouſnes vnto vs, and accompting
of vs to be righteous, &amp; pronouncing of vs guiltleſſe,
and decerning life vnto vs.
               For clearer vnderſtanding whereof, we are to knowe, that
the word of imputation, hath alwayes reference to ſome other
thing, fo that it commonly cometh in betwixt two things, the
one the thing which is imputed, the other that wherevnto it is
imputed, ſo that imputation hath relation vnto both: and to
make this manifeſt, we ſhall conſider theſe 3. phraſes: The obedience
of Chriſt, is imputed vnto iuſtification, conforme to the ſaying of
the Apoſtle, Rom. chap. 5. ver. 19. By the obedience of one man, many
shalbe made righteous. The ſecond phraſe is, Faith is imputed vnto righteouſnes.
And the third is, Righteouſnes is imputed vnto life. The equivalent
whereof we have Rom. chap. 4. ver. 11. and 5. 17. 18. In
the firſt phraſe, imputation commeth in betwixt Chriſtes obedience,
as the thing which is imputed, &amp; iuſtification, as the end
wherevnto it is imputed, and it hath reference to both. In the
ſecond phraſe, imputation cōmeth in betwixt faith as the thing
which is imputed. and righteouſnes as the end wherevnto it is
imputed. In the laſt phraſe, imputation commeth in betwixt
righteouſnes it ſelfe, as the thing imputed, and life, as the end
wherevnto it is imputed.
               
                  
Thus we ſee, that imputation in the matter of iuſtification,
hath alwayes reference to two things: and thus much concerning
the meaning of the word.
               Now we are to conſider, what thinges they are which are
ſaid to be imputed, cōcerning which, there are two extremities
wherein men do commonly fall: the one holding, that nothing
inherent in vs can poſſibly be imputed to vs: the other hold the
contrarie, that nothing is imputed to vs, but that which is inherent
in vs.
               That opinion which is betwixt both, ſeemeth to agree moſt
with Gods truth: that is, that not only things inherent in vs, but
things that are not inherent in vs, are imputed to vs: therefore
imputation is vſed by the holy ghoſt, when hee ſpeaketh of iuſtification
by grace, and of iuſtification by works, as Rom. cha. 4.
&amp; likewiſe, when he ſpeaketh of the accompting of vs ſinners,
becauſe of our workes and corruption inherent: And when he
ſpeaketh of the accompting of vs righteous by grace, through
the obedience of Chriſt, Rom. chap. 4. this ſame is cleare by other
examples of Scripture, as 2. Sam. chapt. 19. verſ. 19. where
She
                        •
                     ei ſayeth to David, Let not my Lord impute wickednes vnto me: and
Rom. chap. 2. ver. 26. where it is ſaide, His vncircumciſion shalbe imputed
vnto circumciſion. This ſame may bee confirmed vnto vs,
Pſalm. 32. and 2. Cor. chap. 5. and Rom. chapt. 9, ver. 8. and 2.
Cor. chap. 12. ver. 6. Gal. chap. 3. ver. 6. and 2. Tim. chap. 4. 16.
               And therfeore ſomtimes righteouſnes is ſaid to be imputed by
debt, and ſometimes by grace, Rom. cha. 4. 4. For vnderſtanding
whereof, we are not only to diſtinguiſh betwixt thinges as they
are inherent, or not inherent in vs: but alſo as they are our owne
or not our owne. For ſomethings inherent are ſo in vs, that
they are our owne, becauſe they conſiſt in theſe thinges which
are in our nature, and are the effectes and fruites of our naturall
powers: ſomethings againe are ſo in vs, as they are no wayes
our owne, being no parte nor portion of any naturall power or
qualitie, nor flowing from any power or facultie in nature, but
beſide and above nature, cōming to vs from God, and wrought
in vs by the power of his ſpirit: and therefore though they be in

vs, cannot be ſaid to be our owne, becauſe they are no parte nor
propertie of our nature, nor effectes produced by nature, ſuch as
is faith: for although we be ſaide to beleeve with the hearte,
yet neither is faith it ſelfe any naturall power or facultie in the
hearte, nor produced by any naturall power or facultie of the
hearte: neither doe wee beleeve with the heart naturally and
by our owne ſtrength, as though wee might make our heartes
to beleeve, or that faith or beleevinge were our owne worke:
but faith (as wee have ſhowen before) is an inſtrument ſupernaturall,
and wrought, not by our heartes, but in our heartes,
by the ſupernaturail power of God: by the which, as by a ſupernaturall
meane given vs of God, we beleeve with our harts,
and ſo lay hold vpon ſupernatural things, and performe ſupernaturall
workes.
               According to this diverſe conſideration of thinges in vs, or
proceeding from any power that is in vs: ſo is there a diſtinction
of imputation in the ſcriptures. One is ſaid to be by debt, another
is ſaide to be by grace.
               Imputation by debt is, When the thing imputed, is a naturall
thing, conſiſting either in the diſpoſition and properties naturall,
which are in vs: or then the fruites and effectes flowing
from our owne naturall powers. And in this ſenſe is it, that the
ſcripture ſaith, That to him that worketh, the wages is not imputed by
grace, but by debt, Rom. chap. 4. ver. 4.
               Imputation by grace (touching things in vs) is whē the thing
imputed, is not natural, but a ſupernaturall thing: being neither
parte nor portion of our nature, nor of any power of facultie in
nature: nor wrought by any power in vs: but ſupernaturally
placed in vs, by God: and given vs above and beſide all that is
by nature in vs. &amp; in this ſenſe faith is ſaid to be imputed to vs.
               For as a man can with his body, or a member of his body, vſe
an inſtrument: (ſuch as a ſword, a knife, an axe, or a ſawe, which
are no parte or power, nor facultie of his body or hande) to performe
things, which he could not otherwiſe doe, by his body or
by his hande.
               Even ſo the ſoule, &amp; heart of a mā, can vſe a ſpiritual inſtrumēt,

(ſuch as is faith) albeit it be no parte, power, or facultie of the
hearte, to performe ſuch things, as by it ſelfe it could never poſſibly
have performed. and therefore ſuch a ſupernaturall inſtrument
whereby our heartes worketh, not being any parte nor
power of vs, nor any thing wrought in vs by our ſelves, nor acquired,
nor purchaſed by vs: but given vs by God, and placed
in our heartes by him, can not properly be ſaid to bee ours, notwithſtanding
that it be in vs, neither can the worke which it
doth, be properly ſaide to be our worke, except by Gods gracious
imputation onely.
               For this cauſe it is, that in the Scriptures, that which is by
faith, is ſaide to be by grace, Rom. chap. 4. ver. 16. as likewiſe,
that the righteouſnes of faith, is not our owne righteouſnes, but
the righteouſnes of God, Phill. chap. 3. ver. 9. Rom. chap. 3. ver.
21. 22. and that not onely in reſpect of the righteouſnes it ſelfe
which is given vs of God: but alſo in reſpect of the meane and
inſtrument whereby we receyve it, which alſo is given vs of
GOD.
               Nowe we come to ſpeake of the thirde pointe, that is, concerning
the thinges, which are ſaid to be imputed to vs, in the
worke of our iuſtification: and theſe be two, according to the
two giftes that God giveth vs, to this ende that wee may bee
righteous.
               The firſt is faith, which is the ſupernaturall inſtrument given
vs of God, to apprehend our righteouſnes.
               The ſecond is the righteouſnes it ſelfe apprehended by faith,
that is Chriſt crucified, or his bloud ſhed for vs: For although
the Lord hath given vs faith, and Chriſt Ieſus his ſonne: yet albeit
we have them, we have them not as our owne, but by the
imputation of God. So that Gods gift, maketh poſſeſſion: but
his imputation maketh our right in proprietie, in the thing poſſeſſed.
               We ſay, that both faith, and Chriſtes obedience is imputed:
becauſe the ſcriptures hath theſe two phraſes.
               Firſt, that faith is imputed vnto righreouſnes: and alſo, that
righteouſnes is imputed. Which two phraſes, are not to be confounded:

but for the cleere vnderſtanding of our iuſtification,
are ſtill to be diſtinguiſhed.
               To make this manifeſt, we are firſt to conſider that vnto our
iuſtification, we muſt firſt have righteouſnes, for God iuſtifieth
no man, that hath not righteouſnes: For to iuſtifie the wicked,
and condemne the righteous, are both abhomination vnto the
Lord, Prov. chap. 17. ver. 15. Eſai. chap. 5. ver. 23. therefore, before
God iuſtifie vs, wee muſt have righteouſnes in our poſſeſſion.
               Secondly, there is but one of two righteouſnes that man can
poſſes: that is, eyther his owne righteouſnes, or the righteouſnes
of God: for no third righteouſnes is ſet downe in the booke
of God, whereby a man can bee iuſtified: ſo that one of theſe
two we muſt have, before God iuſtifie vs. Both theſe pointes
are cleere, in that one ſaying of the Apoſtle, Phil. chapt. 3. ver. 9.
Not having myne owne righteouſnes which is of the Law: but that which is
through the faith of Chriſt, even the righteouſnes which is through GOD by
faith. Which ſentence ſheweth, firſt, that wee muſt have righteouſnes:
and ſecondly, that there is but one of two to bee had,
that is, eyther our owne, or Gods.
               Thirdly, this place ſheweth vs where theſe righteouſnes are:
Our owne righteouſnes is conteyned in the Law: the righteouſnes
of God, is conteyned in Chriſt.
               Laſtly, not only this place, but divers others of the ſcriptures
ſheweth vs, that as the righteouſnes conteyned in the Lawe, is
obteyned by our owne doing of the workes of the Law, and
that by our owne ſtrength: ſo the righteouſnes of God, which
is conteyned in Chriſt, is obtayned by beleeving, and therefore
in the ſcriptures, iuſtification is ſaide eyther to be by workes, or
by faith: for as working is the way, and meane, to attayne to
the righteouſnes of the Lawe: ſo faith is the meane and inſtrument
whereby we attayne to the righteouſnes of Chriſt.
               And therefore, as the righteouſnes of the Law is called our
owne, becauſe the meane whereby wee poſſeſſe it (that is our
working) is our owne: ſo likewiſe, the righteouſnes of Chriſt,
is ſaid not to be our owne, becauſe the meane and inſtrument

whereby we obtayne it (which is faith) is not our owne.
               For both theſe righteouſneſſes have their owne proper ſubiectes
wherein they ſubſiſt, before wee poſſeſſe them: that is,
the Law and Chriſt. For mans righteouſnes is conteyned in
Lawe, and Gods righteouſnes is conteyned in Chriſt: and
therefore mans righteouſnes is called the righteouſnes of the
Law: &amp; Gods righteouſnes is called the righteouſnes of Chriſt:
as alſo whē man is iuſtified by his owne righteouſnes, he is ſaid
to bee iuſtified by the law: and when he is iuſtified by the righteouſnes
of God, he is ſaid to be iuſtified by Chriſt.
               And becauſe man by working the thinges conteyned in the
lawe, attayneth to the righteouſnes of the law: therefore is hee
ſaid to be iuſtified by the workes of the lawe: even ſo, becauſe
by beleeving he attayneth to the righteouſnes of Chriſt: therefore
is he ſaide to bee iuſtified by faith. Thus he that worketh,
and he that beleeveth, is oppoſed, Rom. chap. 4. ver. 5. in reſpect
of the oppoſit meanes whereby they attayne to righteouſnes:
the one of the law by working, the other of Chriſt by beleving.
               Wherevpon the laſt point followeth, that is, that the righteouſnes
of the Lawe is called mans owne righteouſnes, becauſe
he attaynes to it by that which is his owne, that is, by his owne
naturall power, doeing of him ſelfe, and by the ſtrength that is
in him ſelfe naturally, without any helpe of any ſupernaturall
power, or meane given him to aſſiſt him to doe the things contayned
in the lawe. And the righteouſnes of Chriſt is ſaide by
the Apoſtle, not to be mans owne, but Gods: becauſe it is not in
the power of man, by all that hee is according to nature, ever to
attayne to the poſſeſſion of it: but by that meane &amp; inſtrument
ſupernaturall, which is given him of God, to the end he may attayne
to the poſſeſſion of the righteouſnes of God.
               Thus we ſee, that the meane whereby we poſſeſſe the righteouſnes,
is faith onely: and becauſe faith is not our owne, therefore
the righteouſnes that we poſſes by it, cannot be ours, vntill
both be made ours: and this is only done, and performed, by the
Lords gracious imputation of both, that is, faith, and the righteouſnes
of Chriſt poſſeſſed by faith.
               
                  
But firſt, &amp; eſpecially, faith muſt be imputed to vs as our own,
to the intent, that the righteouſnes, that by it we poſſeſſe, might
be our owne. For as a man hath right, to that which hee poſſeſſeth
as his owne, in equitie and iuſtice, if by his owne meanes
he hath obtayned poſſeſſion: but hath no right in equitie and
iuſtice to it, although he have it in his poſſeſſion, if by another
mans ſubſtance given him to be imployed, hee doe acquire the
poſſeſſion: even ſo, if we could attayne to the poſſeſſion of righteouſnes
by our owne meanes, then ſhould that righteouſnes in
equitie and iuſtice be our owne: and therefore the Scripture admitteth
debt in accompting wages to him that worketh, Rom.
chap. 4. ver. 4. but becauſe wee doe not attayne to the poſſeſſion
of righteouſnes, by our owne meanes, but by the meanes of
GOD, which hee hath given vs to vſe, that is by faith,
therefore this righteouſnes in equitie and iuſtice, is not our
owne, vntill the Lord doe impute it vnto vs, and accompt it
our owne.
               So by imputinge faith vnto vs as our owne the righteouſneſſe
which wee poſſeſſe by faith is made our owne, ſo that
faith beeing reckonned and accompted ours, the righteouſnes
of GOD which wee poſſeſſe by faith in Chriſt, is alſo reckonned
and accompted ours: and this is the cauſe why the holy
Scripture doeth offtner deſcribe the manner, and forme of
our iuſtification, vnder the phraſe of the imputation of faith,
then vnder the phraſe of the imputation of the righteouſnes,
becauſe the right that is made vs vnto faith in Chriſt, maketh vs
to have right vnto Chriſt him ſelfe, as our righteouſnes and all
bleſſings in him which by faith we poſſeſſe.
               Secondly, it is for this cauſe, that in the deſcription of the
forme of our iuſtification, that the ſpirite of God vſeth this
phraſe, to wit, That to him that beleeveth: his faith is imputed vnto righteouſnes. Which word (vnto) beeing commonly rendered (for)
doeth much darken the true ſenſe of the wordes, and maketh
many to fall into dangerous errour, thinking, that the verie
acte of beleevinge, is imputed for righteouſnes, that is, as
they take it, in the verie ſame place, and as the verie matter,

of our righteouſnes, whereas the Greeke worde 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   in this
ſentence, doeth declare the ende wherevnto faith is imputed,
that is, that the obedience of Chriſt, apprehended by faith, may
bee righteouſnes vnto the apprehender. For faith, and beleeving,
ever imployeth the poſſeſſion of Chriſt, and his obedience
in our heartes, and the imputation of faith vnto righteouſnes,
is the thing that makes Chriſt poſſeſſed by faith, to bee
our righteouſnes.
               I ſay to be our righteouſnes, for Chriſtes obedience is righteouſnes
in it ſelfe: ſo that it is neyther our faith, nor Gods imputation
of our faith, that maketh his obedience to bee righteouſnes:
but imputation of faith to vs, as ours, maketh the obedience
of Chriſt poſſeſſed by faith (beeing righteouſnes in it
ſelfe) to be our righteouſnes: for as wee have ſaide before, the
making that, whereby we obtayne poſſeſſion to bee ours, maketh
the thing poſſeſſed alſo to be ours: ſo that imputation of
faith, maketh Chriſtes obedience to be that vnto vs, which it is
in it ſelfe, though it were never imputed vnto vs.
               And that this phraſe is ſo to be vnderſtoode, it may cleerely
bee perceyved by that ſentence of the Apoſtle, Rom. chapt. 10.
ver. 10. VVith the heart man beleeveth vnto righteouſnes: and with the
mouth hee confeſſeth vnto ſalvation. In which ſentence, the greeke
worde which is rendered (vnto) can not be rendered (for) without
darking, and alſo perverting, the true ſenſe and meaning of
that place: for we are ſaide to beleeve with the heart, vnto righteouſnes,
in that ſame ſenſe, and meaning, wherein wee are
ſaide to confeſſe with the mouth vnto ſalvation.
               But we cannot bee ſaide properlie (at leaſt cleerely, without
ambiguitie) to confeſſe for ſalvation: becauſe neyther is
our confeſſion the efficient cauſe of our ſalvation, neyther yet
the matter or ſubſtance of our ſalvation, neither can it bee put
in place of our ſalvation: but we confeſſe to this ende, that wee
might attayne to ſalvation. knowing, that hee that confeſſeth
not Ieſus before men, ſhall not be ſaved. For he that is ashamed of
him before men: he wilbe ashamed of him before his heavenly Father, Luke
chap. 9. ver. 26. And hee who shall denie him before men: him shall hee denie

before his Father which is in heaven. And whoſoever shall confeſſe him before
men: him shall he alſo confeſſe before his Father that is in heaven, Math.
chap. 10. Luke chap. 12. Therefore knowing, that without confeſſion
there is no ſalvation, ſeeing confeſſion is the way, and
meane, whereby we attayne vnto the poſſeſſion of ſalvation,
we doe confeſſe to this ende that we may attayne to ſalvation.
And therefore in the ſame ſenſe, wee muſt bee ſaide to beleeve
with the heart vnto righteouſnes, that is becauſe there is no
meane to attaine vnto righteouſnes, except wee beleeve. (For
Chriſt is righteouſnes vnto everie one that beleeveth, Rom. chap. 10. ver. 4.
therefore we beleeve to this ende, that wee may enioye righteouſnes:
according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, Gal. chap. 2. ver.
16. VVee alſo have beleeved in Chriſt: that wee may bee iuſtified by the faith
of Chriſt. In which place, that faith is vnderſtood onely inſtrumentally,
and not materially, it is playne by the next verſe following,
where it is ſaide, If then while wee ſeeke to bee made righteous
by Christ, &amp;c. Which wordes ſhewe plainly, that Chriſt is the
matter of our righteouſnes.
               Nowe there is no reaſon why faith ſhould be ſaid to bee imputed
vnto righteouſnes, in any other ſenſe, as concerninge the
worde (vnto) then wee were ſaide to beleeve vnto righteouſnes: but
in all reaſon without contradiction, the Greeke worde which
we render vnto, muſt in both theſe phraſes bee taken in one and
the ſame ſenſe: that is, that as we beleeve with the hearte, to
this end that we might by faith (as the onely apt and meete inſtrument,
and onely convenient and effectuall meane whereby
to apprehende and poſſeſſe) attayne to the poſſeſſion of the
righteouſnes of God in Chriſt: even ſo the Lord our God imputeth
faith to vs as our owne, to this end, that the righteouſnes
which we poſſeſſe by it, may make vs righteous before him,
or be righteouſnes vnto vs in his ſight.
               Thus this ſentence rightly vnderſtoode, giveth no advanvantage,
eyther to the Papiſtes to prove that by workes we are
iuſtified, or yet vnto others, who doe make the very act of our
beleeving to be our righteouſnes: but rather doeth evidently
convince both theſe opinions of manifeſt etror.
               
                  
The firſt, becauſe faith is no worke of ours, neither yet is the
matter, but the meane only of our righteouſnes.
               The ſecond, for the ſame foreſaid reaſon, for it is not the act
of beleeving, but the thing purchaſed, and poſſeſſed by the act
of beleeving, which is our righteouſnes before God: And thus
much concerning imputation.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               NOW we come to the third pointe, touching the forme
and manner of our iuſtification, which conſiſteth in the
grace of God: for we have ſaid before, that God iuſtifieth
by gift, by imputation, and by grace: therefore giving, and imputing,
doth not ſimply make the full forme of our iuſtification:
but it is further required, that both gift, and imputation, bee by
grace. Therefore are we ſaid to be iuſtified freely by his grace,
Rom. chap. 3. ver. 24. Tit. chap. 3. ver. 7.
               Now we are firſt to conſider, what is meant by the name of
grace: and ſecondly, to conſider how we are iuſtified by grace.
               Touching the name of grace, (leaving that generall ſignification
of grace, whereby it is extended to all Creatures in reſpect
of the goodnes of God, in ſome meaſure vnto all) we will
only treate of theſe two ſignifications of grace, where it is taken
in the worke of our ſalvation.
               The firſt ſignification of grace, is when it ſignifieth the free favour,
love, and good will of God, in God him ſelf, and his good
will towards man, which from himſelfe, and of him ſelfe, without
any reſpect of any thing without him ſelfe, moveth him to
make man gracious, and acceptable to him ſelfe: in which ſenſe
it is taken Tit. chap. 2. ver. 11.▪ 
                  For that grace of God that bringeth ſalvation
to all men, hath appeared. And Rom. cha. 3. ver. 24. Being iuſtified
freely by his grace. And Ephe. chap. 1. ver. 6. To the praiſe of the glory of
his grace, &amp;c. And chap. 2. ver. 5. By whoſe grace ye are ſaved.
               
               Secondly, the name of grace is taken for the benefits and gifts
which God of his grace doth beſtowe vpō vs in Chriſt: in which
ſenſe it is takē 1. Pet. cha. 4. ver. 10. Let every man as he hath receyved

the gift, miniſter the ſame one to another, as good diſpoſers of the manifolde
graces of God. In which ſenſe, our righteouſnes is called grace,
Rom. chap. 5. ve. 17. much more shall they which receyve that aboundance
of grace, and of that gift of that righteouſnes, &amp;c. and not onely righteouſnes,
but all the remaynant bleſſinges which wee receyve
from God in Chriſt: and therfore they are all called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
that is gratious gifts, or giftes of grace, Rom. chapt. 12. ver. 6.
1. Cor. chap. 12. ver. 4. And as grace is taken in this ſenſe, Chriſt
him ſelfe, and his death, and mediation, &amp;c. may iuſtly be accompted
grace. Therefore is hee alſo him ſelfe called the gift
of God: moreover, faith, love, hope, peace, ioye, patience, perſeverance,
life and ſalvation, are all comprehended vnder the
name of grace, as it is taken in this ſenſe. In which ſenſe,
the fooliſh Papiſtes doe call it gratia gratum faciens: that is, the
grace that maketh vs acceptable or gratious. whereas it is cleer by ſcripture,
that it is grace taken in the firſt ſenſe (whereof it evidently
appeareth that the papiſts are vtterly ignorant) whereby we are
made acceptable vnto God, as Eph. cha. 1. ver. 6. To the praiſe of the
glorie of his grace, by the which he hath made vs freely accepted in his beloved.
And this is the grace, which onely ſhould bee called the firſt
grace, becauſe it goeth before all other grace taken in the ſeconde
ſenſe, yea before the gracious Decree, or Predeſtination
of God, eyther of vs to adoption, or of Chriſt to bee our
Redeemer, as wee have ſhowen before: But the ignorant Papiſt,
calleth the very gift of GOD, whereby a mans hearte
is drawen backe from evill, and ſtirred vp to goodnes, the
firſt grace. Which opinion, were not amiſſe in reſpect of the
grace that is diſpenſed to vs, if hee did acknowledge the particular
love of God, and his grace remayninge, and reſident in
him ſelfe towarde his elect, to goe before it, as the cauſe: but
the reaſon of his ſtumblinge is this, the fooliſhe opinion
of the vniverſalitie of grace: when as they eſteeme Gods
grace generally to bee extendede alike to all, and have no
light nor iudgement to diſcerne betwixt the generall and vniverſall
grace of God to all. Whereby hee maketh his Sunne to
ariſe vpon the evill, and the good, and ſendeth raine vpon the iust and vniuſt,
                  
Math. chap. 5. ver. 45. and that ſpeciall grace and love of God
which moveth him to love Iacob when he hated Eſau, &amp; of the
ſame lumpe whereof he maketh all mankind, to make certaine
veſſells vnto honour, while as the reſt are prepared for diſhonour.
               This being ſhortly ſpoken of the ſignification of grace: wee
have next to conſider, in what ſenſe wee are ſaid to be iuſtified
by grace.
               Firſt we are to marke, that we are not ſaid to be iuſtified by
grace in the ſecond ſenſe, wherein grace is taken: howſoever
the thing whereby we are iuſtified be a grace, for in this phraſe
grace is not referred to any of the thinges that are given vs, and
imputed to vs vnto righteouſnes: but vnto the manner, and
forme of Gods giving them, and imputing them. And that we
may knowe this more cleerlie, we are to vnderſtand that grace
taken in the firſt ſignification, hath a three-folde place in the
worke of our iuſtification.
               Firſt, it hath place in the efficient cauſe: in which ſenſe it is
taken, 2. Tim. cha. 9. VVho hath ſaved vs, and hath called vs with a holy
calling, not according to our workes, but according to his purpoſe and grace.
For the grace of God, is the cauſe moving God, to predeſtinate,
call, iuſtifie, and glorifie: and of this wee have ſpoken of at
length before in the cauſe of Gods Decree.
               Secondly, the grace of God hath place in the formall cauſe:
in which ſenſe we are ſaid to be iuſtified by grace.
               Thirdly, it hath place in the finall cauſe: in which ſenſe it is
taken Ephe. chap. 1. ver. 6. 12. where he is ſaide to doe all to vs,
Vnto the praiſe of the glory of his grace.
               
               When it is referred to the manner of Gods iuſtifying vs, it is
oppoſed ſpecially to two thinges: Firſt, the word grace ſecludeth
all price given by vs to God for iuſtifying vs.
               Secondly, it ſecludeth all merit of ours from the worke of
our iuſtificatiō: ſo that it importeth as much, as that in our iuſtification
whatſoever God doeth, he doeth it freely of his love,
and gratious favour: Man neyther any wayes deſervinge it by
his worthines, nor paying any thing to God for it, and that this

is the meaning of the worde, it is moſt evident by this other
word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which is indifferently put for grace, the one being
ſometimes interpreted by the other, as Rom. chap. 3. ver. 24.
Being iustified freely by his grace: where the word which is rendered
freely, is dorean, which word ſecludeth both price and merit.
               Concerning price, it is cleere Math. chap. 10. ver. 8. Yee have
receyved freely, give freely. And 2. Theſſ. chap. 3. ver. 8. Neither tooke
we bread of any man freely.
               
               Concerning merite, it is likewiſe manifeſt, that this word
ſecludeth it, by Ioh. chap. 15. ver. 25. They hated me freely, that is,
without cauſe, or deſerving: ſo that this word maketh iuſtification
to be a worke of God freely done.
               And this we marke, that we may know it ſecludeth not the
merit of Chriſt, although that merit be imputed to vs by grace:
and by this conſideration, we ſhall learne to reconcile two ſayings
of ſcripture, that ſeeme to be repugnant.
               The firſt is, Eſay chap. 52. ver. 3. Yee shalbe redeemed without monie.
The other is, 1. Cor. chap. 6. ver. 20. For yee are bought for a price:
The one ſeemeth to make our redemption free without price:
the other ſeemeth to ſay the contrarie.
               Yet both are true, for in reſpect of man him ſelfe, hee hath
paide no price at all to God for his redemption: but as concerning
Chriſt, he hath given a deare price, even his life, &amp; bloud,
for our redemption.
               So the word Grace, ſecludeth not the merit of Chriſt, nor the
price that he hath payed for vs, nor ought els ordayned of God
by his grace, as cauſes and meanes ſubordinate to his grace for
our iuſtification: but onely ſecludeth whatſoever thinge is in
man, or can proceed from man, who hath nothing of him ſelfe
whereby to deſerve righteouſnes, neither hath any thing to give
to God to obtayne righteouſnes: For who hath given to God firſt: that
he should recompence him, Rom. chap. 11. verſ. 35.
               And this third pointe of the forme of our iuſtification, is neceſſarie
to be added to the other two.
               Firſt, for the right knowledge both of Gods giving, and imputing
of faith, and Chriſt to our iuſtification.
               
                  
Secondly, for preſerving vs from the errours of thoſe, who
miſtake the true meaning of the word grace in our iuſtification.
               Concerning the firſt, there is a diſtinctiō of the giftes of God,
and alſo of the imputation of God.
               Touching the giftes, they be eyther ſuch as are natuall given
by God indifferently to al, &amp; are belōging to our natural life: or
thē, they are gifts ſupernatural, belonging to a ſupernatural life.
               The firſt ſorte the Lord giveth by naturall meanes: as by
procreation, by naturall generation, and by his generall providence
extended over all.
               But the ſecond, he giveth not but by ſpeciall grace, and by a
ſpeciall providence, and particular love in the Lord IESVS:
there being no ground nor cauſe in them, to whom hee giveth
them, why they ſhould have thē, nor any meanes in their power
to procure them.
               Thus faith, and Chriſt by faith, are given vs of God, not for any
worthines in vs, nor for any thing given to God by vs: but the
Lord giveth vs both faith, and Chriſt, vnto iuſtification, freely
of his meere grace.
               Secondly, touching imputation, there is an imputation by
debt, and an imputation by grace: therefore that it may bee
knowne, that neither faith, nor Chriſtes merite, is imputed to vs
by debt: the ſcripture plainly ſheweth, that this imputatiō is by
grace. that is, firſt, that faith which is now givē vs: &amp; ſecondly,
that Chriſt who is givē vs by faith, is ours, not by any right that
we have vnto thē by iuſtice: &amp; that accompting of them ours, is
not by debt, but of meere mercy &amp; grace, ſo that our whole iuſtificatiō
in al that is either given vs, or imputed vnto vs, to iuſtifie
vs, both in the giving, &amp; in the imputing, is of Gods free grace.
               The ſecōd vſe of the knowledge hereof, is, to preſerve vs from
their errors, who take the name of grace in our iuſtification, for
the gifts of grace inherent in vs: be it faith, or ſanctification, or
the fruites of our righteouſnes. And ſecondly, from their error,
who take the name of grace, for a gratious acceptatiō of our imperfect
faith: whereas grace in iuſtification is relative to the giving
&amp; imputing of faith: not to the accepting of it. For in reſpect
of faith given by grace, and imputed by grace: wee are ſaid

to be iuſtified by grace, &amp; not in reſpect of Gods accepting of it
at our handes by grace. And thus much concerning the forme
of our iuſtification.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               IT olloweth that we now ſpeake of the obiect of iuſtification,
that is, the man whom the Lord doeth iuſtifie: who is two
maner of wayes to be confidered.
               Firſt as he is in him ſelfe by nature.
               Secondly, what he is by grace, before he be iuſtified.
               As concerning him ſelfe, wee have two places of ſcriptures,
which doe manifeſtly inſtruct vs what man is in him ſelf, when
God iuſtifieth him. The firſt is, Rom. 4. 5. where God is ſaid to iuſtifie
the vngodly: the other, Rom. 5. 10. where God is ſaid, to have iuſtified
vs, while we were enemies. and this ſheweth the vanitie of the
Papiſts, who wil have a man formalie iuſt before he be iuſtified.
               Touching that which he is by grace, it is in many parts of the
ſcripture evidently declared, that he muſt beleeve, before he be
iuſtified, that is, muſt have faith wrought in his heart, in that
ſorte that he may be iuſtified: for like as Acts 14. it is ſaide, that
Paul perceyving that the creeple mā had faith to be made whole, he did heale
him: even ſo the Lord firſt giveth vs faith to bee made iuſt, and
then iuſtifieth vs. For we are to conſider, that although faith bee
the inſtrument of Gods power, to make vs able to apprehende
Chriſt, and all his bleſſings in him: yet in the worke of iuſtification,
it is particularly to be reſtrayned, both as it is wrought by
God in our heartes, and as our heartes worketh by it: vnto the
particular benefite of righteouſnes in Chriſt: like as in all the reſt
of the benefites, faith is alwayes to be particularly reſtrayned, to
every one of them in the particular apprehenſion of them.
               Moreover we ſee the truth of this ſame, in the order ſet downe
by the Apoſtle, Rom. 8. when he ſayth, whom he hath called: them he
alſo hath iuſtified. whereby it is evident, that God iuſtifieth not a
man, vntill firſt he hath obtayned, that degree of grace which
God beſtoweth vpō a man whē he calleth him: of which it followeth,
that he muſt have Chriſt reveyled vnto him, &amp; he muſt
likewiſe be come to Chriſt, &amp; muſt have embraſed him by faith,

and that not only as the ſonne of God (for in that point of faith
conſiſteth his adoption) but alſo as the propitiation for ſinne in
his bloud, which is the ground of Gods iuſtifying him. For as
God firſt openeth our eyes to ſee Chriſt to bee the ſonne of God,
and by making vs to beleeve that: maketh vs partakers of adoption:
ſo ſecondly, by opening our eyes to ſee him to be ordayned
by God a propitiation for ſinne in his bloud, and by making
vs to beleeve that: he layeth the foundation of our iuſtification
in our heartes, which is finiſhed and accompliſhed by his gratious
and free imputation. For vnto the iuſtification of a ſinner
by the obedience of Chriſt in his death, not onely faith, but alſo
the imputation of faith, (and that by grace) muſt preceed, before
that Chriſt or his obedience can bee our righteouſnes: not
that there is any defect, or inſufficiencie in Chriſtes obedience:
but becauſe neither faith, hee, nor his obedience, is iuſtly ours,
vntill that by the free imputation, and accompt of GOD, they
be made ours.
               This we are carefully to conſider, that wee doe not confound
the ſufficiencie of Chriſtes obedience, &amp; our right therevnto,
as many perverſlie doe in theſe dayes: for the ſufficiencie
which is in Chriſt, and his obedience vnto righteouſnes, is
reſtrayned according to Gods gratious giving, and imputinge
faith, and his obedience by faith, and his imputation, gift, and
grace, are reſtrayned to his calling: for the promiſe of God, is
reſtrayned to his calling, as is cleere, Acts chap. 2. verſ. 29. and
all vertue in Chriſt vnto ſalvation, is likewiſe reſtrayned vnto
his calling: as is cleere, 1. Cor. chap. 1. ver. 24. and his callinge,
is reſtrayned to his Decree, and his Decree, is reſtrayned to his
purpoſe: of which it appeareth evidently, that all ſufficiencie
of Chriſtes merit, how great and infinite ſoever, is no larger in
right, and efficacie, then his calling, and ſo conſequently then
his Decree, and purpoſe: For Gods promiſe, is no larger, then
his calling, and his calling, no larger then his Decree, and his
Decree no larger then his purpoſe.
               Heerevpon it followeth, that Gods purpoſe is no larger, then
his applying by 
                     •
                  uſtifying, and glorifying: ſeeing his iuſtification

is as large, as his calling, and his calling as large, as his Decree,
and his Decree as large, as his purpoſe.
               This is yet more evident by his promiſe, which wee have
ſhewen to bee of no larger extent, then his calling: of which it
muſt followe, that his purpoſe can bee of no larger extent then
his applying: becauſe his calling, and applying muſt bee of equall
extent, and his purpoſe of equall extent with his calling.
               Of all theſe thinges, it is manifeſt, that the ſubiect of Gods
iuſtification, is the man indued with faith: and this is to bee
marked, againſt thoſe who eſteeme the beleeving man, in the
foreknowledge of God to be the ſubiect of Gods Decree.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIIII.
               THE next pointe that we have to ſpeake of, is touchinge
the finall cauſe of iuſtification, in the which wee purpoſe
to be ſhort, ſeeing it is not a matter controverted: but yet
it ſerveth to cleare the trueth of that going before, concerninge
the ordet of Gods benefites. It is receyved vniverſallie of all,
that the finall cauſe of righteouſnes, is life: for there is no way
to attayne vnto life, but by righteouſnes: and for this cauſe iuſtification
is called, The iuſtification of life, Rom. chap. 5. vetſ. 18.
and for the ſame cauſe it is ſaide, That they who receyve that aboundance
of grace, and of the gift of that righteovſnes, shall reigne in life, Rom.
chap. 5. ver. 17. therefore is ſalvation called the end of our faith,
Pet. 1. Epiſt. cha. 1. ver. 9. Carrying about with you, the end of your faith,
even the ſalvation of your ſoules. And this is according to the plaine
ſpeech of God, Ezek. chap. 18. If a man be iuſt, he shall ſurely live ſaith
the Lord: but the ſoule that ſinneth, shall die. And againe in the ſame
chapter, ver. 20. The righteouſnes of the righteous shalbe vpon him: and the
wickednes of the wicked, shalbe vpon him ſelfe. And againe, In his righteouſnes
that he hath done, he shall live.
               
               By theſe teſtimonies it is plaine, that the end of righteouſnes
is life: according to the ſaying of the Prophet Haba. The iust
shaell live by faith, in the 2. chapter, ver. 4. and therefore eternal life
is called the hope of righteouſnes, Gall. chapt. 5. ver. 5. For wee

through the ſpirit, waite for the hope of righteouſnes through faith.
               
               And in this ſame ſenſe is the ſaying of the Apoſtle to bee taken,
Rom. chap. 8. ver. 23. VVee doe ſigh in our ſelves, wayting for our adoption,
even the redemption of our bodyes. as may eaſilie bee perceyved
by the wordes following, wherein hee giveth the reaſon
of this our waytinge, when hee ſayeth, for by hope wee are ſaved,
&amp;c. where our Adoption is put for our ſalvation, or glorification,
or redemption, in that ſenſe wherein redemption is taken,
1. Corinth. chap. 1. ver. 30. and this is needfull to bee marked, to
let vs ſee how diverſly Adoption is taken in the holy ſcriptures
of God.
               And that wee may ſee the trueth of that which wee have
ſaide before concerning the difference betwixt beeing a ſonne
by faith, and by prerogative: for as ſayeth Iohn 1. Epiſt. chap. 3.
ver. 2. we are now the ſonnes of God: but it is not made manifeſt yet what
wee shall bee. where he plainly diſtinguiſheth, betwixt beeing a
ſonne, and being a glorified ſonne: for by faith wee are the ſonnes of
God, Gall. chap. 3. ver, 26. and yet by faith wee are not the glorified
ſonnes of God: but yet ſtill wayte for our Adoption, that
is our glorification.
               And this diverſe ſenſe of Adoption, is evidently cleered by
the diverſe ſenſe of redemption, wherein it is taken in the Rom.
chap. 8, ver. 23. and Heb. chap. 9. ver. 15. For Rom. chap. 8. it is
taken in one ſenſe with Adoption, that is, for the glorification
of our bodyes: But in the 9. chap. to the Heb. it is taken for iuſtification:
which place alſo confirmeth, eternall life to bee the
end of our iuſtification, whyle it is ſayde, that Christ is the Mediator
of the New Teſtament for this cauſe, that through death, which was for
the redemption of the tranſgreſsions that were in the former teſtament, they
which were called might receyve the promiſe of eternall inheritance. And
this ſame is made manifeſt by the Apoſtles order ſet downe
Rom. chap. 8. where hee ſayeth, whom he iuſtifieth, them alſo hee glorifieth.
For as calling is the fruite of predeſtination: and iuſtification,
the fruit of calling, ſo glorification is the fruite of iuſtification.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               THus we are brought to the concluſion of the maine point
touching iuſtification what it is, which in the ſcriptures is
deſcribed ſhortly and ſuccinctly. ſomtimes by the not imputatiō
of ſinne, ſomtimes by the remiſſion of ſinne, ſomtime by
the covering and hiding of ſinne, ſomtime by the imputation of
righteouſnes, ſometime by the imputation of faith vnto righteouſnes,
ſometime by the making of a man righteous by the obedience
of Chriſt, ſometime by the making of Chriſt ſinne for
vs, and vs the righteouſnes of God in him, and ſomtime by healing
of vs by Chriſt his ſtripes: and all theſe are to one effect, &amp;
the iuſtified man is ſometimes ſhortly deſcribed in one worde
the iuſt by faith, ſometime in relatiō to the action of God, more
amply, he that hath received the aboundance of grace, &amp; of the
gift of that righteouſnes, which is by one man Ieſus Chriſt: ſomtime
he whoſe ſinnes are remitted, to whom ſinne is not imputed,
and whoſe ſins are covered, &amp;c. out of which and the conſideration
of the points preceeding, wee may gather a more full
and cleare definition of the action of iuſtificatiō in this maner.
               Iuſtification is that ſeconde gratious action of the free
diſpenſation of GOD in Chriſt, towarde thoſe whom accordinge
to his foreknowledge, and purpoſe, hee had predeſtinated,
to bee Adopted through Chriſt, whom nowe hee hath
adopted through him, havinge effectuallie called them to
the fellowſhip of Chriſt by faith, by the which action he maketh
them, who in them ſelves are ſinners, to bee righteous in
Chriſt crucified, that is, whom albeit he knew no ſinne, hee had
made ſinne for them: and that by the free imputation of Chriſts
obedience, and ſatisfaction, vnto them, as their owne righteouſnes,
even as they them ſelves had performed it: and by the
imputation of faith which he hath given vnto them, as their
owne, to this end, that the righteouſnes of God which they poſſeſſe
no wayes but by faith, might be their owne righteouſneſſe,
and ſo they might have remiſſion of ſinnes in his

bloud of Chriſt, whom God had not onely ordayned, but alſo
made a propitiation for them in his bloud.
               In this definition we cal iuſtification, firſt, the action of God,
becauſe it is he only which iuſtifieth.
               Secondly, wee call it the action of his diſpenſation: to diſtinguiſh
it from the action of Predeſtination, or of Gods Decree
in it ſelfe.
               Thirdly, wee call it the ſecond action of his diſpenſation: to
diſtinguiſh it from the firſt action, which is our calling preceeding
it.
               Fourthly, wee call it a gratious and free action: becauſe it is
diſpenſed for no merit or deſerving of thoſe which receyve it,
neither for any thing given by them to God before, whereof it
ſhould be the recompence, but is given freely of his grace.
               Fiftly, Wee call it the worke of God in Chriſt, to diſtinguiſh
it from the Decree of God, which is a worke of God in him ſelf,
and to ſhewe iuſtification to be a worke of externall diſpenſation,
which wholy is performed by God in Chriſt, in whom all
the bleſſings of grace are comprehended: as our filiation, or iuſtification,
and glorification, in whom, and through whom
only, God maketh vs his ſonnes righteous and glorious, he, being
made of God vnto vs wiſedome, righteouſnes, ſanctification,
and redemption. And theſe five pointes are to bee conſidered
in the nature of this action.
               The next thing that is to be conſidered, is the ſubiect that is
iuſtified. And this we make not ſimply to be a man foreknowne
and fore-purpoſed, neither yet a man ſimply predeſtinate, but
moreover a man effectually called, and made one with Chriſt
by faith, and in that vnitie the ſonne of God. For a man ſimply
and nakedly foreknowne, is the onely obiect of Gods Decree
and Predeſtination. For thoſe whom hee foreknew, hee predeſtinate,
ſayeth the ſpirit of God. And a man predeſtinate, is the
only obiect of Gods calling according to his purpoſe: For whō
hee had predeſtinate, them alſo hee called, ſayeth the ſpirit of
God. And the man now called effectually to the faith of Ieſus as
the ſonne of God, and promiſed ſeed, in the which all the nations

of the world ſhould be bleſſed, is the onely obiect of Gods
iuſtification, like as a iuſtified man is the onely obiect of Gods
glorification: Thus to goe backward againe, the Lord in glorifying
a man, hath before him eſpecially his righteouſnes, for
none but the iuſt ſhall live: next, in iuſtifying a man, hee hath
particularly before his eyes his vnion with Chriſt by faith, without
the which not any man ſhal be iuſtified of God. And in giving
this bleſſing, to bee one with Chriſt by faith, and ſo in that
vnitie, the ſonne of God; in which cōſiſteth the calling of God:
Hee onely hath before his eyes the man predeſtinate, to be Adopted
through Chriſt, that is, the man whom hee hath ordayned
to call, that is, to Adopt, and to make his ſonne by faith in
Chriſt. And in predeſtinating a man to this bleſſinge, hee had
not any thing before his eyes, but his owne foreknowledge of
the perſon of that man, his purpoſe, or the good pleaſure of his
will, which are all one in ſubſtance, and different onely in reſpect:
The will of God, which limiteth all the actions of his
power (ſeeing hee doeth all thinges accordinge to the counſell
of his owne will) being the higheſt and the firſt cauſe of
all thinges created and done by GOD in the world, of the
which no cauſe poſſiblie can bee given, and therefore it is in
ſome reſpect the cauſe of Gods purpoſe, or counſaile, which
therefore is called the counſaile of his will, although his will
and his counſaill in effect bee both one: For his will is his
purpoſe, and his purpoſe is his will in all thinges, and eſpeciallie
in the whole worke of his grace towardes the veſſelles of
mercie, vnto the which, his purpoſe is eſpeciallie reſtrayned oftentimes
in the booke of God: which purpoſe is nothing, ſave
a ſetting of ſuch perſons before him from all eternitie, as hee
him ſelfe willeth or pleaſeth: which may cleerlie be perceyved,
by the holy bread ſet vpon the Table in the Sanctuarie, being
twalfe in number, repreſentinge the twalfe Tribes of Iſraell,
that is, the whole elect of God, which are called the ſhew
bread in the vulgar tranſlation, the worde beeing the ſame
which is called the purpoſe of God, as is cleere by Chriſt his
owne wordes, Math. chap. 12. ver. 4. Luke chap. 6. ver. 4. that is

the bread, of the purpoſe of God, or of the ſetting before the
face of God. And therefore the action of the Prieſt in ſettinge
thoſe bread vpon the table before the Lord, is called by the Apoſtle
Heb. chap. 9. ver. 2. Protheſis ton arton, that is, the ſetting before
or the preſenting of bread: to ſhewe vs, that by that worde
which is commonly called the purpoſe of God, which was ſhadowed
in that type of the Lawe, is to bee vnderſtood, the eternall
action of God, in ſettinge before himſelfe, as in the ſight
of his owne eyes, the perſons of ſuch as hee willed. And in the
ſame ſenſe the ſame word is referred vnto Chriſt, Rom. chapt. 3.
ver. 25. whether it be referred to Gods eternall purpoſe, touching
the humane nature of Ieſus Chriſt, in ſetting it particularly
before him, as that which ſhould be the onely expiation of the
ſinnes of his elect in the bloud thereof, or whether it be referred
to the action of God in ordayning the ceremonies of the Lawe,
As the ſacrifices, and eſpeciallie the propitiatorie or mercie ſeate▪
as the types of Chriſt: and ſetting them before his eyes, or rather
Chriſt in them, as the onely propitiation for ſinne, of which
action of God in ſettinge the perſons whom hee willed, before
his face, followeth the foreknowledge, which in effect is nothing
but the purpoſe of God, &amp; is not to be referred to any thing
but the perſons foreknowen, and is onely diſtinguiſhed in reſpect
from the purpoſe for the clearer vnderſtandinge. As the
ſettinge of a thinge before our eyes, maketh vs to have the
knowledge of it: ſo the Lorde, his ſetting of our perſons,
who
                     •
                   hee willed to bee his, before his eyes, includeth the
knowledge of our particular perſons from all eternitie, before
eyther the worlde or wee were created, whoſe eſtate and condition
both in faith, righteouſneſſe, and life, are conſequences
of this particular purpoſe and notice of GOD touching our
perſons, and of the Decree which the Lorde maketh concerning
vs, of whoſe perſons it pleaſed him, and it was his
good will and pleaſure, to take ſuch notice before wee were.
For thoſe perſons whom it pleaſed him to knowe, before the
worlde was, them he predeſtinated, and decreed to bee adopted
through Chriſt, that is, to beleeve, and by faith to bee made

one with the ſonne of God: ſo that the foreknowledge of God,
as it is diſtinguiſhed in order from predeſtination, and made
the diſtinction of the obiect of predeſtination, can never properly
bee referred to any ſpirituall gift, or grace, eyther decreed
for the children of God, or in tyme given vnto them: but
onely vnto their perſōs (which onely are properly ſaide to bee
foreknowne, when as foreknowledge is diſtinguiſhed as a ſeverall
action in God him ſelfe, from Gods Decree, as the effect
of his foreknowledge) ſeeing the gift of faith, and Adoption by
faith, are the bleſſings decreed to them that are foreknowne.
               This diſtinct conſideration of man, as the obiect of Gods
gratious working, eyther in decreeing bleſſedneſſe through
Chriſt, or diſpenſinge it in Chriſt, or in his purpoſe or foreknowledge
concerning both Decree and Diſpenſation, ſerveth
much to cleere our iudgements in that queſtion, ſo much now
controverted in the Church of GOD, touching man, as hee is
the obiect of Gods predeſtination: for it appeareth by the order
of the Apoſtles ſetting downe both the Decree and Diſpenſation
of God, that in every diſtinct degree of his grace, there is a
diſtinct conſideration to bee had of man, as hee is the obiect of
Gods favour: ſo that in his Decree man onely in his eſſence,
as being purpoſed of God, and foreknowne of him, is ſett by
the Lord before his eyes, in ordayning him to Adoptiō through
Chriſt: but in his adopting, and calling, hee hath not ſimplie,
and nakedlie, the beeing, and ſubſiſting of a man before his
eyes, but alſo his owne Decree concerning that man, that is
he ſetteth him before him ſelfe, as a man ordayned by him ſelfe
to bee made his ſonne through Chriſt. And in his iuſtifying of
a man, hee reſpecteth him not ſimplie in reſpect of his beeing,
and ſubſiſtinge, neyther yet as ordayned of him to Adoption:
but rather as a man nowe effectuallie called to that eſtate, and
condition, that is, to bee the ſonne of God in Chriſt. And laſtly,
in glorifying of a man, GOD ſetteth before him a man not
onely as foreknowne in his beeing, neyther onely as ordayned
to Adoption, nor as called vnto that bleſsinge by
him: but alſo as now iuſtified by the Redemption that is in

Chriſt Ieſus, freely imputed vnto him by grace. And this much
is to be conſidered in the obiect, that is in the man whom God
iuſtifieth: in whom alſo this other thing is to be marked, that he
is in him ſelfe a ſinner: for God is the God that iuſtifieth the vngodly,
Rom. chapt. 4. neither is the faith which is given him
contrarie vnto this: For as ſayeth the Apoſtle in the ſame place:
To him that worketh not, but beleeveth in God who iuſtifieth
the vngodly, his faith is compted for righteouſnes.
               And therefore as ſinne is oppoſit to righteouſnes, and righteouſnes
to ſinne: ſo in the veſſels of mercie, the conſideration of
their ſinnes, and them as ſinners before God, is properly to bee
placed in the worke of iuſtification as the firſt bleſſing, that belongeth
vnto them that are made now the ſeed of Abraham,
and ſo the children of God.
               Now in the worke of iuſtification it ſelfe, we ſay that he maketh
thē righteous: by the which we vnderſtand not any chang
of their nature, but of their condition and eſtate in Gods ſight
onely, being in themſelves, and in their owne nature, the ſame
that they were before, that is, ſinners. For the benefit of iuſtification,
is not onely to bee diſtinguiſhed from the worke of our
calling going before it, in the which not onely the eſtate and
condition, but alſo the very inward diſpoſition of our heartes,
and qualitie of our mindes, are changed from darknes to light,
from hatred to love, and from infidelitie to fidelitie, &amp;c. But alſo
from the benefit of ſanctification, comprehended vnder glorification,
following after our iuſtification, in the which ſanctification,
not ſo properly the eſtate and condition of our perſons,
as the qualitie and conſtitution of our nature, is changed.
               Secondly we ſay, that God maketh vs righteous in Chriſt:
becauſe the righteouſnes whereby wee are iuſtified, is neyther
ours, nor in vs, but in Chriſt alone, by whoſe onely obedience
many are made righteous.
               Thirdly, we ſay, that it is in Chriſt crucified, and made ſinne
for vs, that we are made righteous: and that for two reſpectes.
               Firſt, becauſe Chriſt is made righteouſnes by God, not to anie

but to thoſe for whom firſt God made him ſinne, in delivering
him to the death for them: in which action, he is ſpecially made
our righteouſnes. For God had ordayned him to bee a propitiation
in his bloud.
               Secondly, becauſe that the thing wherein faith doeth apprehend
Chriſt as righteouſnes, is ſpecially his death, &amp; ſuffering,
which the beleeving heart doth apprehend, as done and performed
for it in particular.
               Thirdly, the way how he maketh vs righteous: we ſay, that
it is by imputation both of Chriſtes obedience vnto vs (as our
owne obedience or righteouſnes indeed before GOD) and of
faith, to this end that it might be ours, ſeeing wee poſſeſſe it no
otherwiſe, but by faith.
               Laſtly, wee ſay, that by this imputation, wee have remiſſion
of ſinnes: becauſe the death of Chriſt imputed vnto vs, which
was the puniſhment of our iniquities, is a full and perfect ſatiſfaction
of the iuſtice of God for our iniquities.
               Thus we have ſo plainlie, and ſenſibly as wee could, opened
vp that parte of the great myſterie of godlines, touching the
iuſtification of a ſinner: following not any thing but the ſimple
trueth ſet downe in Gods worde, according to the meaſure
of light, which it hath pleaſeth the Lord to impart
vnto me: whom we heartily beſeech to bleſſe
all our labours, to the glorie of his
Name, and comfort of his
Saintes, Amen.
