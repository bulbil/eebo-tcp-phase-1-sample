            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

all grace

               Honorable Sir,
            
            BENEFITS, they
ſay, are alwayes beſt
giuen, when they are
moſt concealed, but
thanks when they are made
moſt knowne. Giue my
priuate eſtate leaue therefore
to borrow the Art of
the Printer, which is the
publike Tongue of the learned,
to expreſſe my ſelfe
(though with no other learning
then what your kinde
reſpects haue taught mee)

moſt gratefull vnto you: who
indeed am bound, though
principally, yet not onely to
your Honoured ſelfe, but totj
Gentj tuae, to the worthy
Lady your mother, the religious
Knight, Sir Nathaniel,
your ſecond Father, &amp; without
thought, not beyond my
deſire, to your moſt noble &amp;
learned Vncle, the Right
Honorable Francis Lord
Verulam, Viſcount Saint
Albones my free and very
Honourable Benefactor,
whoſe Gift, as it was worthy
his beſtowing, ſo was
it ſpeedily ſent, and not
tediouſly ſued for; Honourably
giuen, not bought
with ſhame, to one whom
he neuer knew or ſaw, but
onely heard kindly ſlaundered
with a good report of others,
and opinion conceiued

by himſelfe of ſufficiencie
and worth. For by your
Fauours I confeſſe, my eſtate
is ſomething, but the
ſence of my pouertie much
more increaſed. For if we
may beleeue Neros wiſe
Maiſter and Martyr; There
is none ſo poore, as he who cannot
requite a benefit: but I
am glad your Eſtates will
be alwayes beyond any retaliating
kindneſſes of mine
who could not, indeed, with
out doing you much iniury,
wiſh my ſelfe able to make
you amends.
            As therefore Aristippus
came to Dionyſius, ſo doe I
to you. 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
               Hauing
receiued what I wanted, to
returne what I had. Though
in trueth this ſmall p
                  •
               eſent
may bee better ſayed to bee

giuen by you to others,
then by my ſelf to you, who
thought it worthy of more
mens reading then your
owne, which I pray God it
may be. Surely if there be
any worth in it, it is in the
dignitie of the matter, and
the fitneſſe of it, for our nature
and times. The matters
are the Grounds, Exerciſe
and Reward of the
faithfull, Heauenly Light
Bodily labour, Spirituall
reſt. The firſt of which
brings with it light for our
Soules; the ſecond, Health
for our bodies, and the third
for them both eternall Bleſſedneſſe.
But in our times
there is three Vertues are
ſo great ſtrangers, in which
there are ſo many euill
heartes of vnbeliefe, all
ſtanding ready to depart

from the liuing God, that
wee had need to offer a holy
violence to our nature,
and to fall out with our
times, that fall ſo faſt away
from God, or elſe it is to be
feared leaſt the tide and
ſtreame of them both carry
vs not into the riuers of
Paradiſe, there to bee landed
vpon the mountaines
of our ſaluation, but into the
riuers of Brimſtone, whether
all are waſted that depart
from GOD: as himſelfe
telleth vs; Depart from
mee yee curſed into euerlaſting
fire.
            
            And ſo much the more
need had wee, that liue in
this laſt Age of the world,
to looke to the infirmitie of
our natures and diſeaſes of
the time: becauſe natural infirmities
are alwayes greateſt

Tyrants in our Age,
and it is no otherwiſe in
this old world, then in old
perſons: If we were borne
weake ſighted, it is a venture
but in age a great dimneſſe,
if not a totall blindneſſe
doe not befall vs. If a
lame hand by nature hath
diſabled the actions of our
youth; the hand which in
youth could doe little, will
doe nothing in our age; if
we haue traduced a perſonal
inclination from our parents
to any vice, it is a
grace if that inclination
grow not to an affection in
our youth, and in our age to
a habite. So faſt grow the
ill weedes of Nature when
Nature it ſelfe decayes in vs.
            Now wee cannot bee
ignorant that in the very
Spring of nature, theſe three

ſtrong infirmities were ſeeded
in vs. The firſt vpon
the effacing of Gods Image,
a dimme eye-ſight or darkneſſe
in our ſoule: the ſecond
a lame hand or idleneſſe
in the body, which
grew when Mortalitie firſt
broke in vpon vs, and left
our nature conſumed of that
firſt-borne ſtrength it then
flowriſhed with: bringing
in vpon our labour an accurſed
ſweat, vpon our
ſweat, wearineſſe, and conſequently
faynting, and
languiſhing the whole body
with vnreſt, and diſeaſe:
The third vpon the loſſe of
our heauenly inheritance,
an inclination and affection
of the whole man to
ſuch a happineſſe, as wee
cannot build for our ſelues,
out of the beautie and delights

lights of this world: which
Salomon happily alluded vnto
Eccles. 3. 11. where
ſpeaking of Humane happineſſe,
to reioyce, and doe
good, that is, to eate and
to drinke, and to enioy the
good of all our Labour,
verſe 13, (Which queſtionleſſe
is therefore lawfull,
becauſe it is there ſayd to
bee the gift of GOD) hee
telleth vs, that, God hath
made euery thing beautifull
in his ſeaſon, and hath ſet
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               Coelum, the worlde,
as it is tranſlated, or the deſire
of perpetuitie in their
heartes, ſo that no man can
finde out the worke that God
maketh from the beginning to
the end. Whereas it ſeemes
to me, Salomon allowing vs
this Humane felicitie, as
good in it ſelfe, yet ſecretly

accuſeth it (by reaſon of the
immoderate affection, and
deſire of perpetuitie wee
caſt after it) for blinding
the eye of our conſideration
ſo farre, as thereby wee
cannot finde out the worke
that God maketh from the
beginning to the end: which
doubleſſe can bee no other
then his worke of our Redemption,
purpoſed from
all eternitie in CHRIST
our Lord who therefore as
himſelf is called 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,
the firſt borne of all
creatures, ſo his day is cald
Nouiſſimus Dierum, the laſt
of all dayes, he onely being
(as himſelfe witneſſeth) 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                &amp; 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
and the Frſt, and the Laſt,
the beginning of all things,
and the ende of all things.
Coloſ. 11. and in this worke
onely conſiſts the knowledge

of our perfit happines
wherein is both perpetuitie
and ſufficiency, which work
of Gods, moſt men therefore
cannot finde out,
becauſe they acquiet their
deſires with this humane
felicitie, and lie downe vnder
Iſſachars bleſſing, which
indeed, is but a curſory and
viatorie happineſſe, ſeruing
vs onely for the time and
by the way.
            Theſe then are the three
great diſeaſes of our ſoules,
bodies, and perſons; Blindneſſe
of Spirit, Idleneſſe of
Body, Loue and reſt in the
world; which the beginning
of the world, made
by corruption, naturall; and
the Age of the world, by
the ſecond nature, and of
cuſtome, hath made delight
full to vs. And truely, if our

owne experience did not
teach vs how moſt men in
our daies placed themſelues
in theſe infirmities, and
with what delight wee are
ignorant, idle, and enamored
of the world: yet the
Oracles of GOD would
plainely euidence it vnto vs,
wherein wee ſhall finde it
prophecied of this laſt tempeſt
of the world, that it
ſhould bee full of ſeducing
Spirits to infidelitie, of idle
buſie bodyes, of louers of
pleaſures, more then louers
of GOD, To cure which
three great diſeaſed of our
natures, and our times I
haue ſent abroade by your
perſwaſion (and therefore
haue burdened you
with the Patronage of it)
this ſhort Praeſcript, which I
pray GOD may worke by

the power of his Spirit
ſoundneſſe in vs. To the riches
of whoſe grace, I moſt
entirely commend you,

THE

               I. The difference of our Sauiours
opinion concerning
good and happie
men, from the wiſer and
vulgar ſort of people among
whom he liued.
               OVr Sauiour when he
came to be the true
Light of the World, had

a hard taſke to make his
Light ſhine in the darke
vnderſtanding of ſuch,
eyther groſſely or affectedly
ignorant men, amongſt
whom hee liued:
who eyther hold many
common errors for vnqueſtionable
truths, or if
they were of the wiſer
ſort, many falſe lights, &amp;
appearing truths for certaine
Rules, and vnerring
principles of their belief.
The falſe lights, which
had a fayre ſhine of truth
to varniſh them ouer
with; were theſe, and ſuch
like.
               That hee was a right
honeſt &amp; religious man,

that offered no man
wrong. That was kinde,
and louing to thoſe that
deſerued well of him.
That would neuer forſweare
himſelfe, eyther to
benefit his owne eſtate,
or to hurt another mans.
That if hee were affected
to a maried woman, kept
himſelfe from Adulterie
with her. If he were neuer
ſo angry▪ yet brideled
in his rage, that it broke
not out into murder.
That when his Parents
were in want, honoured
them with maintenance:
That made long Praiers;
gaue great Almes; faſted
often; payed the Tythes

duely; and ſo farre honored
the very aſhes of the
Prophets; that hee built
their Tombs being dead,
to keepe aliue their memories
and names. This
was the Phariſies Starre-light.
Al which the common
People who liued
in the ſhadow of thoſe
ceremonious times, and
night of their owne ignorance,
held for great
&amp; beautifull lights, truths
moſt credible, and worthy
to be beleeued and
followed of all: but when
the Sunne aroſe, this ſtar-light
ſoone diſ-appeared;
and our Sauiour makes
it plaine in this, and the

ſequent Chapters. That
al thoſe were but the outſides
of truth, which an
hypocrite might diſguiſe
himſelfe, and face it with,
as well as an honeſt man;
nay that all of them, except
they were circumſtanc't
with thoſe times
and places, and done after
that manner &amp; forme
they ought, were, for all
their faire lookes, but
ſhining faults. Or rather,
as nothing is more deformed
in the ſight of man,
than ſuch a defectiue
monſter in Nature, who
ſhould want halfe of his
parts, (imagine one abortiuely
caſt out, with one

legge, one eye, halfe a
noſe, &amp;c.) ſo in the ſight
of God, who lookes to
the inner man, this ſemihoneſty,
which wants the
better halfe and in-ſide of
it ſelfe, cannot but appeare
moſt prodigious
and miſ-ſhapen.
               For our Sauior counts
that no Chriſtian vertue,
Not to offer wrong: For
ſo they which returne
wrong for wrong, offer
no wrong, they doe but
vim vi repellere, ſtrike
blow for blow; but the
Vertue was, to ſuffer
wrong with patience, &amp;
not only to abſtain from
offering wrong with violence;

So to loue thoſe
that are deſertfull, hath
no vertue in it: for not to
doe ſo, were to do them
iniury; but to loue the
ill-deſeruing, to loue our
enemies, to loue our perſecutors,
this indeed is
the grace of a Chriſtian.
               And what if our eſtates
allow our poore Parents
the honour of maintenance?
If our harts withdraw
from them the honour
of obedience, of holie
imitation, of filiall reuerence,
doe we think we
haue performed a ſonnelike
part to them, or the
duty of a Childe?
               Againe it is no Vertue

to keep a mans ſelfe from
periury; for he that neuer
forſweares himſelfe, may
yet bee a common ſwearer:
but to ſet a Watch
before his lips, that they
ſhould neuer vnaduiſedly
ſweare at all, that was
the Vertue.
               Beſides, what was it to
keepe himſelfe from Adultery
and Murder, if he
had adultery in his eyes,
luſt in his hart, if he were
enraged with anger, and
had dipt and ſtained his
thoughts in bloud? God
who is a Spirit, lookes to
the iſſues of the Spirit, if
thou deſireſt reuenge, if
thou luſteſt after a woman,

thou art before God
guiltie both of adultery,
and of bloud. And ſo
much almes, and often
faſting, &amp; due payment of
tithes, what goodneſſe
haue they, if the almes
muſt bee trumpeted abroad,
and the faſt muſt
ſet a ſowre face vpon the
matter, and the tithes
muſt bee boaſted of, and
layed as it were in Gods
diſh, when he comes to
pray before him in the
Temple, as though God
who giues him all, were
beholding to him, for reſtoring
him the tenth
part of his owne? To
conclude long prayers

and building the ſepulchres
of the prophets,
which of all other were
their moſt colourable
virtues, were they not indeed
crying ſinnes in the
ſight of God, when they
were (I ſay not onely vtterd
arrogantly in euery
corner of the ſtreet, that
they might bee ſeene of
men, and not cloſeted vp,
for GOD alone to ſee
them) but when vnder
pretence of long prayers,
they deuour'd widowes
houſes, and vnder colour
of building the tombes
of the Prophets which
were dead, they had no
other intent but with the

more ſafety, and leſſe ſuſpition
to ſlay the ſonne
of God, who was then aliue
among them, the
Prince of the Prophets.
               Looke then as beautifull
and fayre fruit to ſee
too, yet if it be rotten at
the core, when the outſide
is par'd off, hath no
ſuch goodlyneſſe within,
as outwardly appear'd,
but very rottenneſſe at
the heart: or to vſe a more
proper ſimilitude, As a
piece of ſmooth and rotten
wood, if it bee ſet in
the darke and ſeene onely
in the night, makes a
great blaze, and ſhowes
to bee a very lightſome

body: but aſſoone as the
day riſes, it forfeits the
flame, and the rottennes
of it is plainely diſcouered:
ſo was it with theſe
appearing truths which
the Phariſees obtruded,
and thruſt vpon the darke
vnderſtandings of the
common people, for moſt
heauenly lights &amp; lamps
full of glory: they were
all but vizards of truth,
rotten opinions, lies with
painted faces.
               And as theſe were the
falſe-lights that dazeled
the eyes of the wiſer ſort
of people, ſo there were,
beſide theſe, certaine cō
                  mon
errors, which went

abroad as moſt receiued,
and graunted poſitions
&amp; verities, which all men
beleeu'd, as: That they
had good cauſe to reioyce,
who had euery
mans good word for
them, and many friends
in the world, whom they
might truſt to; That rich
men were happy, For
they liued at hearts eaſe.
That they liued the moſt
comfortable liues in the
world, that were alwayes
merry hearted, and were
euer laughing. To name
no more. That it was a
moſt wretched eſtate not
to haue ſufficient meate
and drinke, but to liue alwayes

as in a famine, in
hunger and thirſt.
               But our Sauiour, as
before hee extinguiſht
their falſe, and phariſaical
lights, ſo in theſe, hee oppoſed
himſelfe againſt
their popular, and common
errors. And therefore
he ſayes not (as they)
Reioyce becauſe ye haue
many and great friends in
the world, and becauſe
you haue euery mans
good word for you but
the playne contrary Reioyce,
and bee exceeding
glad (what? when you
haue many friends that
ſpeake well of you, and do
you good, no but) when

you haue many enemies
that ſhall reuile you, and
perſecute you, and ſay all
manner of euill againſt
you falſely for my names
ſake, verſes the 10. 11.
And bleſſed are, who? the
rich in eſtate? no but the
poore in ſpirit, ver. the 3.
And not they who were
merry hearted, &amp; alwaies
laughing had the moſt
comfortable liues: but
bleſſed are they that
mourne verſe the 4. For
they ſhalbe comforted.
In a word to land my ſelf
at home vpon the preſent
words. That not they
which abounded with all
things, and could ſay to

their ſoule as Diues did.
Luke the 12. Soule eate,
drinke, aud bee merry: for
thou haſt much goods layed
vp for many yeares, were
bleſſed: but bleſſed are
they that hunger, and
thirſt after righteouſnes:
For they ſhall bee ſatiſfied.
For the truth is. It was
a moſt abſurd, &amp; improper
ſoloeciſme of ſpeech,
when the riche foole (ſo
our Sauiour cals him and
therefore I doe him no
wrong) bid his ſoule eate,
and drinke thoſe goods,
that hee had layed vp for
his body to eat, &amp; drinke.
For the ſoule with ſuch
food could neuer haue

beene ſatisfied, but thoſe
ſoules onely ſhalbe repleniſhed
and filled, that
hunger after the kingdome
of Heauen, and the
righteouſneſſe thereof.
For as righteouſnes here,
ſo the Kingdome of God
hereafter, as grace here, ſo
glory hereafter, are the
onely repaſte to banquet
a Soule with. Firſt therfore
let vs ſee.
            
            
               II. How Righteouſneſſe and
Grace, are the food of our
Soules.
               THat is properly called
the food of any

thing whereby it is inwardly
preſerued from
conſumption, corruption,
and death. And therfore
as the Body hath ſomething
to preſerue it for a
time, which is bodily
food, ſo muſt the Soule
haue ſome ſpirituall repaſt
to perpetuat, and
preſerue it for euer. For
nothing beſide a diuine
nature can bee of it ſelfe
aye during. Let vs therfore
becauſe this paradox
to a naturall man will
ſeeme ſtrange, goe with
him to his owne arte, the
arte of nature. There we
ſhall find theſe two Sanctions
publiſht, as receiued

trueths of all, firſt,

                     
                        •
                     iſdem alimur ex quibus
conſtamus, Euery nature is
nouriſhed by that, whereof
it is firſt made, and the ſecond
is Simile nutritur a
ſimile. Like is nouriſht of
like. Now it is a ſpeech
of our Sauiour which it
may bee euery man remembers,
but few men
marke, when after fourty
dayes faſt in the wilderneſſe,
he was tempted to
ſatiſfie his hunger by making
bread of ſtones, he
anſwered. That Man liu'd
not by bread onely, but by euery
word that proceeded
out of the mouth of God.
Which ſpeech though a

prophane Ignorant will
perhaps deriſonly ſcoffe
at, as thinking it impoſſible
to liue by words, yet
ſuch words as proceed
out of the mouth of God
haue more vitall ſweeteneſſe,
and nouriſhable
ſap in them, than all his
corne, and oyle, and wine
haue. Was not the whole
world made by the word
of God? Was not the
ſoule of euery reaſonable
creature made by the
ſame word, and ſo imbreathed
into the body
of the firſt father of our
humane nature? and is
now ſtill infuſed into euery

                  ce the oppoſers
of this truth in his
time.
               All things, ſayes he, aroſe
firſt eyther out of the
power of nature, or fortune,
of God. Out of a
power of nature they
could not. For tell mee
(ſayes the father) whom
could nature by her
power firſt bring forth.
Could the fruits of the
earth, or the foules of heauen,

or the trees of the
forreſt, or the beaſts of
the field, or the Cittizen
of the world, man, iſſue
firſt from the wombe of
nature? but where I pray
should nature find ſeed

                     〈◊〉
                   ſome the earth, but
from the fruites of the
earth before growing,
where ſhould ſhee ſeeke
for egges to breed her

                     •
                  owles with, but from

                     •
                  owles already bred?
whither ſhould ſhe goe
to gather her akrons, but
vnder the oake before
flouriſhing? what neede

                     •
                  nfinite knotts? It is not
in the power of nature to
bring forth a man but he

muſt firſt be borne a child
and of whom ſhould that
child bee borne, had not
there been already in nature
both man, and woman?
nature then we ſee,
could not by any power
in her produce the leaſt
creature, but ſhee muſt
needs haue her ſemniall
cauſes; and whence are
they ſeeded but from
things already beeing?
Much leſſe could chance:
for what is fortune but
onely ſomething in nature
wherof we know not
the cauſe? If a man digging
in a field, find a
mine, we cal this fortune:
but a mine muſt bee firſt

there by nature, before any
can finde it there by
fortune. And therefore
fortune that comes alwayes
after nature, cannot
bee the cauſe of nature.
It followes then,
that the whole world, and
the ſoules of men proceeded
neither from nature
nor chance: but from the
power and wiſedome of
God himſelfe who is as
much more powerfull
then nature, to call out
his worke perfect in his
kind at firſt, as he is more
wiſe then fortune, to adorne
his worke with the
moſt graceful order with
out any chaunceable or

blind confuſion. This
then being either graunted,
or extorted from a
naturall man, what followes
hence? Truely this.
That the ſoule of man
doth conſiſt by the word
of God. Secondly, That
the ſoule of man, beeing
onely able of all creatures
viſibly in heauen, or earth
to conceiue, and vnderſtand
a diuine beeing,
which our experience
teaches vs, muſt needs
be a ſpirituall ſubſtance
like God himſelfe, and
created after his image.
For this in reaſon and
nature is a ſelfe-credible
truth. That no Creator

can rayſe the power of his
action beyond the ſphaere of
his owne actiuity. A ſtone
cannot liue. A plant cannot
ſee. A beaſt cannot
vnderſtand a diuine nature,
becauſe it hath no
ſuch receptiuity, no ſuch
actiue, and diuine power
in it, as to take into it an
inſenſible obiect. For
then it ſhould work extra
ſphaerā, beyond the pitch
of a ſenſible being: man
therfore onely who hath
ſuch an eye of vnderſtanding
in him, whereby he
is able to liue (as it is ſayd
of Moſes Heb. 11. 27.) as
ſeeing him, who is inuiſible,
muſt needs be faſhioned

and form'd in the ſimilitude
of the inuiſible
God. For, what creature
worſhips a diuine power,
ſanctifies holy dayes, and
Sabaoths, obſerues ſolemne
feaſts, and aſſemblies,
offers ſacrifices of
prayer, &amp; praiſe to God,
but man onely? Vpon
whoſe ſoule doth the law
of God naturally reflect
it ſelfe in the knowledge
of that which is good,
and the conſcience of
that which is euill, but
onely vpon man's? What
nature in earth obſerues
the different motions of
the heauenly bodies, and
admires the methodicall

Wiſedome of God in
them, or thinkes vpon his
couenant of mercy, when
he ſees the token of it ſhining
in the waterie cloud
(ſweetly abuſing the ſame
waters to bee a token of
his mercy, which before
were the inſtrument of
his iuſt reuenge) but only
man's? whoſe eye lookes
beyond the bright hilles
of time, and there beholds
eternity, or ſees
a ſpirituall world beyond
this body, eſteeming that
farre diſcoaſted region,
his natiue countey, but
onely man? Which diuine
thought wee ſhall
not find in the hearts alone

of the children of
light, that haue the ſtarres
of heauen ſhining thicke
in them (Hebr. 11. 16.)
but in the minds of heathen
men, that lay ſhadowed
in their owne naturall
wiſedome, out of
which the baniſht Conſul
of Rome Boetius could
ſing.
                     
                        Haec, dices, memini patria

                        O this my country is,

                        Hence was my birth, &amp;
here ſhall be my ſtay.
                     
                  
               
               And of which Anaxagoras,
liuing a ſtranger among

the Athenian Philoſophers,
and being chid
for regarding ſo little his
natiue ſoile, by one that
aſked him, why he minded
no more his owne
country, anſwered

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
ô (ſayes he pointing
vp to heauen) I am exceeding
mindfull of my natiue
countrie.
               
               Now to apply all this
diſcourſe home, man we
haue prou'd was created
by the word of God: man
only was form'd in Gods
image and ſimilitude.
And who then is the
word of God, but the
Sonne of God who the

expreſſe image of the Father,
but the Sonne, Ioh.
1. 1. Heb. 1. 3. Since therefore
our ſoules conſiſt by
the Word, Chriſt and euery
thing is preſeru'd of
that it conſiſts, as Nature
it ſelfe teaches; ſince our
ſoules are made after the
image and ſimilitude of
Chriſt, and euery thing
is moſt agreeably nouriſhed
by that it is moſt
aſſimilated vnto, is it not
euen in reaſon an irrepugnable
Truth, that our
ſoules muſt needs be
nouriſhed and preſerued
by the power of our
Lord CHRIST, who is
Gods Eſſentiall Word,

and Image?
               And heere by the way
(but I ſpeake of it onely
incidentally as it falls into
diſcourſe) wee may ſee
as the high dignity ſo the
cauſall differēce between
the reaſonable ſoule of
man, and the liuing ſouls
of bruit beaſts. For doe
but looke into the booke
of the generatiō of creatures,
and you ſhall ſee
there Mans ſoule was immediately
breathed into
his body by God himſelfe,
and was created after
his Diuine image: but
the Liuing Soules of
bruit beaſts were educ't
out of their elementarie

wombes, &amp; thoſe bodies
which were moſt like thē
                  ſelues:
For ſo ſayes our
Lord God, Let the Earth
bring forth euery liuing
thing according to his kind,
and it was ſo: &amp; ſo the ſea
was commāded to bring
foorth iſſue according to
his kind, and ſo it was:
which is the reaſon the liuing
ſouls of beaſts fal again
into the ſame matter
out of which they were
firſt taken, and of whoſe
kinde &amp; likeneſs they are,
as our corruptible bodies
doe. Duſt thou art, and into
duſt thou ſhalt returne: but
the diuine and reaſonable
Spirit of man returns to

God that gaue it, as Salomon
ſpeakes, Eccleſ. 12. 7.
being immediately created
by him, &amp; of his owne
ſimilitude and kinde, &amp;
ſo breath'd into the body:
which is indeede the
true &amp; prime cauſe of the
immortality of our ſouls.
So that they, being created
immediately by the
Word &amp; breath of God,
out of nothing, and not
ariſing from any praeexiſtent
matter, cānot poſſibly
be corrupted into any
other nature, or annihilated
by any other word,
except we childiſhly ſuppoſe
ſome word more
powerful then the Word
of God himſelfe.
               
                  
I haue now prou'd that
our ſoules all conſiſting
by the word of the Father
which is Chriſt, and being
imag'd moſt like vnto
him, they muſt needs
(as euery thing elſe is by
their like) be preſerued,
and nouriſht by Chriſt,
whoſe image they are,
and who may therefore
with greater truth, and
reaſon be called, the food
of our ſoules, then our
earthy diet can bee the
food of our bodies: becauſe
hee is euery way,
both in reſpect of himſelfe,
and vs, more preſeruatiue,
then to bodies any
bodily ſuſtenance can

be. For, that makes vs
continue by being deſtroyed
it ſelfe, and deſtroyes
vs too, if it be taken
in exceſſe, &amp; though
it be neuer ſo often vſed,
yet ſoone after we ſhall
hunger againe, and thirſt
againe: neither can it repaire
our nature in the
headlong ruines of age,
ſo faſt but that we muſt
euery day forfeite a little
ſpoile to mortality which
it can no way poſſibly recouer,
and in concluſion,
vnable to hold out any
longer, it muſt yeeld vp
the whole body as a pray
to death. But we cannot
drinke too much of our

ſpirituall rocke, nor eate
too much of our heauenly
Manna, which after we
haue feaſted our hearts
with, we ſhall find noe
more hunger, or thirſt;
feele noe more iniuries
of age, or time; feare noe
more ſpoiles of mortality,
or death. Neither is
the ſoule nouriſhed by
this diuine food, as the
body is, by waſting that
whereby it ſelfe is preſerued,
and conſuming that
to maintaine it ſelfe,
whereby it ſelfe is kept
from corruption: but as
the ſight of al eyes is preſerued
and perfected by
the light of the Sunne,
whoſe beames can neuer

be exhauſt, ſo our ſpirituall
life is nouriſhed by
the participation of the
life of Chriſt, which is indeede

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , annona
cali, the flower of heauen,
neuer engroſt by
poſſeſſing, nor loſt by vſing,
nor waſted by nouriſhing
nor ſpent by enioying
but hath that heauenly,
and vnconſumable nature
in it (being to nouriſh
immortall ſoules)
that it preſerues, all without
decaying it ſelfe, it
diuides it ſelfe to al without
loſſe or diminution
of it ſelfe; it is imparted
to all, and not impayred
by any of thoſe repleniſhed

ſoules, that banquet
vpon it.
               Now if the quaere be
made how our ſoules are
thus by Chriſt preſerued
from their owne corruption,
and beyond their
owne natural life, to a life
Celeſtiall &amp; diuine, there
can be no other anſwere
giuen, but by beeing implanted
into the life of
righteouſnes which fontally
is in him. As if the
branches of a wild oliue
being cut off from the reall
ſtocke where it grew
naturally, ſhould be kept
from withering and corruption
by ingraſſing it
into the ſtocke of a ſweet

and flouriſhing Oliue-tree.
So our ſoules beeing
created in naturall
righteouſneſſe and holylineſſe
by God, and being
ſoone after by our fall
cut off from that life, and
ſo remayning in the ſtate
of corruption and decay,
would ſoone wither and
dye totally, were they not
eftſoons reymbark't and
ſtock't againe into the
Tree of life, from whence
they ſucke a more diuine
life of righteouſnes, then
that they were created, or
now liue in. For the natural
righteouſnes thogh
it were in the kind of it
perfect, yet it was of a

ſhort continuance, (as nature
left to it ſelfe alwayes
is) and our habituall
righteouſneſſe, though
it continue for euer, yet
it is very imperfect, like
the twilight of an euening,
or the firſt breake of
day in which the ſhadows
of earth, and the light of
heauen are confuſed; and
therfore the ſoule of man
vnable to liue perpetually
by any of theſe liues
which were defectiue,
could haue no way bene
preſeru'd from his owne
corruption, but by the
participation of this diuine
Righteouſneſſe of
Chriſt, which is infinitely

more durable then Adams
naturall, and more perfect
then our poore habituall
righteouſnes either
is, or euer could haue bin
Neyther let it ſeeme
ſtrange to any that the
Soule which dies by vnrighteouſnes
and ſinne,
ſhould be ſayd by grace
onely and righteouſneſſe
to receyue againe life,
and preſeruation.
               Hence are thoſe ſcripture
phraſes ſo frequent
You are dead in your ſinnes,
ye are ſtrangers from the
life of God, &amp; of the wanton
and ſinfull widow,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   ſhe was dead being
aliue, that is, dead to

God, and the righteouſneſſe
of Chriſt, and aliue
onely to nature, and the
corruption of it. Hence
againe on the contrary
the Iuſt man is ſayd to
liue by the righteouſnes
of faith, (Hab. 2. 4. Heb.
10. 37.) and therfore this
life, which we could not
acquire by our nature, becauſe
it is eternall; God
is ſaid in he firſt Epiſtle
of Sa. Iohn 5. 11. to haue
giuen it to vs; and leaſt
wee ſhould trouble our
ſelues to know where this
life was found out for vs,
it is added in the ſame
place. And this life is in
his Sonne. Thus Saint

                  Paul ſpeakes Col. 3. 3. that

                     •
                  ur life is hid in Chriſt,
and that it was no more
he that liued but Chriſt
that liued in him, Galat.
2. 20. thus hee tells the
Corinthians that wee
were made the Righteouſneſſe
of God in Chriſt. 2.
Cor. 5. 21. and 1 Cor. the
1. the 30. that Chriſt was
made of God vnto vs, Wiſedome,
Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification
and Redemption,
and therefore twice the
Prophet Ieremy tells vs
that, This is his name wherby
he ſhall be called. IEHOVAH-tſidkenu,
THE LORD
OVR RIGHTEOVSNESSE. Ie.
23. 6. and 33. 16. For as

verily as our ſinnes tooke
away his life, ſo aſſuredly
ſhall his righteouſneſſe
preſerue ours, in which
becauſe wee haue a double
ſtate, one in our apprehenſion
of it by faith,
the other in our comprehenſion
of it by viſion,
and intuition, therefore
here the Saints of god are
ſayd to be bleſſed onely
in their hunger, but hereafter
they ſhalbe happy
in their fulnes, here God
onely feeds them with a
ſufficiency of grace, there
he fills them with ſuch a
ſatietie of glory in which
their ſoules, with the
greateſt exceſſe, without

the leaſt ſurfet, ſhall bee
feaſted for euer. For God
is not like old Iſaac, that
hath but one bleſſing for
his ſonnes, and therefore
as wee muſt learne of S.
Paul, with our ſufficiency
to bee content, My
grace is ſufficient for thee:
ſo let vs with him ſtriue,
at leaſt in our moſt heauenly
thoughts, get awing
and rauiſht into the
third heauen, then to
behold
            
            
               
               III. What is the fulneſſe wherewith
thoſe Soules that
hunger after Righteouſneſſe
ſhalbe ſatiſfied.
               THE fulneſſe heere
meant is nothing
elſe but a perfect expletion
of all the naturall deſires
of Soule, Body and
Perſon, according to the
vttermoſt receptiuity of
them all, which their
owne proper and moſt
agreeable obiects, wherein
euery deſire reſts it ſelf
wholly acquited, and filled.
For inſtance nothing

can arreſt the vnderſtanding
of man, but that
which is abſolutely true,
or rather Truth it ſelfe.
For that is the moſt proper
and agreeable obiect
to our vnderſtanding: and
who is that but Chriſt
our Lord? I am the Truth
ſaies our Sauiour: Nothing
can ſatisfie the reaſonable
will of man, but
onely that which is perfectly
good, or rather
goodneſſe it ſelfe: and
who is that but onely
God? For as our Sauior
ſpeakes, there is none
good but God; nothing
can fill the reſtleſſe affections
of man, but onely

thoſe fountaines of pleaſure,
that haue in them
neither defect nor end,
ſuch as can be found no
where heere. And where
are they, but at the right
hand of God only? Pſalm.
16. 11. In thy preſence is
fulneſſe of ioy, and at thy
right hand are pleaſures
for euermore: the firſt takes
away all defect. In thy
preſence is fulneſſe of ioy:
and the ſecond admits of
no end: at thy right hand
are pleaſures for euer.
               
               And this is the firſt fulneſſe
or ſaturity of the
ſoule: the ſecond is of the
body. And the naturall
deſires of the body are

life, health, and beautie.
Now where can we finde
life, but in that Country
which is the land of the
liuing, whether no death
is ſuffered to approach;
or whether ſhould we go
to meet with indeflowriſhing
and vnattainted
health, but where there is
no ſorrow, no paine, no
ſickneſſe at all? And that
is no where, but onely in
the Holy City, which S.
Iohn calls the new Hieruſalem,
Reuel. 21. 4. There
ſhall be no more death neyther
ſorrow, nor crying, neither
ſhall there be any more
paine, but as the two glories
of the Old and New

Teſtaments, Dauid and
S. Paul ſpeake, God ſhall
deck his Saints with health
and wee ſhall put on incorruption
and immortality in
thoſe Courts of Honour.
               And thus as the ſoule
and body haue their natural
deſires: ſo the whole
perſon of man deſires naturally
as cloſe an vnion
with the Diuine being, as
it is poſſibly capable of:
ſecondly it deſires glorie
and honour, being one of
the beames of GODS
countenance, which hee
caſts vpon his moſt noble
creatures. For there is a
ſparke of Diuinity in
Glory, which makes all

men, I had almoſt ſaid all
creatures naturally appetent
of it, according to
the ſize they haue meaſured
them out by God, to
veſſell it vp in. Cupido
gloriae nouiſſimè exuitur
etiam a ſapiente, ſayes the
wiſe Hiſtorian, many to
giue life to their Honor,
hauing loſt their owne.
And this holy Ambition,
as it deriues it ſelfe to another
world, ſo it is in
man both a naturall and
lawfull deſire, within the
expectation of which, the
whole creature ſtretching
out the neck of it, (as
S. Paul moſt ſignificantly
ſpeakes, waites for, and

ſighes for, and (like a woman)
is in a dolorous trauaile
for to be deliuered,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
into the free libertie
of glory, granted to the
ſonnes of God. The laſt
hunger both of ſoule and
body as they are vnited,
is of diuine ſocietie and
friendſhip, and therefore
as the Philoſopher calls
man 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a ſociable
Creature, ſo the Apoſtle
would haue vs 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
to aſſociate our
ſelues (at leaſt in our trauelling
thoughts) with
the Citizens of Heauen,
who as for number they
are infinitely more, ſo for

nature are farre more illuſtrious
and bleſſed, then
our vnder companions
that liue here below, centred
with our ſelfs in this
little point of earth are.
For God himſelfe being
a Diuine Spirit, and thoſe
Palaces of glory being
farre more extenſiue and
ſpacious, then our narrow
regions, how can
there but be, as Dauid and
Daniel both witneſſe, ten
thouſand times ten thouſand,
and thouſand thouſands
of miniſtring Spirits
to wait vpon their
high and tranſcendent
Soueraigne, the King of
Spirits Royal: and therefore

S. Paul reckoning vp
our heauenly companions,
Hebr. 12. 22. begins
with an innumerable cō
                  pany
of Angels, ſo that
this deſire ſhall aboundantly
be ſatiated and
content.
               But of heauen we that
are on earth cannot ſay
much. For though Satan
took our Sauiour vp
into a high mountaine,
and thence ſhewed him
all the Kingdomes of the
earth, and the glory of
them in a moment of
time, Luk. 4. 5. which
ſhewes of how ſmall moment
they are, that in one
ſhort inſtant and article

of time could ſodainelie
giue a blaze, and ſo vaniſh:
yet there is no
mountaine high enough,
nor any time long enough,
but eternity to
vnuaile the glory of the
Kingdome of Heauen,
which God purpoſely (no
doubt) hath concealed,
that he might know who
would loue him for himſelfe,
becauſe all men
could not but loue him
for his glory, if he ſhould
let it fall vpon our eyes,
and diſplay it ſelfe in the
diuine beames of it. Yet
as farre as the eye of right
reaſon, guided▪ (like the
wiſe men in the ſearch of

our Sauiour) by the heauenly
ſtarres of light that
ſhine euery where in
Gods word, may diſcouer
this holy land, let vs
not wrong our ſacred
hunger of knowledge, as
blindely to wrap vp all in
a cloud, and to denye it
this iuſt ſatisfaction:
which eſpecially conſiſts
in a threefold glorious vnion,
wherewith God
hath promiſed in his
Word to vnite the perſons
of the Elect to himſelfe:
which cloſe with the
Diuine Being I mentioned
before to be the moſt
ardent and naturall deſire
of our whole perſon, and

that wherwith the whole
man is moſt delighted, ſatisfied,
and filled.
               Firſt therefore wee are
vnited vnto Chriſt as vnto
our Head, and ſo wee
make but one body with
him; and this is a cloſer
vnion then eyther children
can be vnited to Parents,
for they are diuided
parts from their Father,
but wee are vnited
parts to Chriſt our Lord;
or married couples can
be vnited each to other.
For they being diuerſe
bodies, are vnited but into
one fleſh, but wee to
Chriſt are vnited into
one body, and one fleſh,

as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, we
are all ſet into his body,
and are fleſh of his fleſh,
and bone of his bone,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as hee
with a moſt ſignificant elegancy
ſpeakes in the 4.
and 6. to the Epheſians.
And this is the firſt vnion
of our perſons with God
by his Son Ieſus Chriſt,
which makes vs way and
entrance to the two remanent.
               The ſecond vnion is
whereby our perſons are
ſpiritually vnited to God
by the very Diuine and
Holy Spirit of God him
ſelfe: ſo that this infinite,
and glorious, and euer-liuing

Spirit diffuſing it
ſelfe through euery member
of Chriſts myſticall
body, makes vs of one
ſpirit, and one ſoule, as it
were, with the Diuine being;
not by the vnion of
eſſence and information,
but of inhabitance and
participation.
               The laſt vnion is that
whereby the Diuinity of
God dwelling in vs after
an vnſpeakeable gracious
manner, vnites himſelfe
whole, although not
wholly to vs, far beyond
the poſſibility of any other
creature in the
World. For other creatures
haue no power of

vniting themſelues ſo as
God hath. The reaſon is,
cauſe they are of ſo groſſe
and if not corporeall, yet
materiall being, that it is
impoſſible for them to
make vs partakers of
their Eſſences, which
haue all of them certaine
Characteriſticall, and indiuiduall
differences,
whereby they are incommunicable
in their Natures
to any other beſide
themſelues. But wee are
made (as S. Peter tells vs)
partakers of the Diuine
Nature after an eminent
manner; which though
it cannot be plenarily expreſt,
yet it may bee ſhadowed

by ſome weak reſemblances.
               The Rule whereby we
may conceiue of this vnion
is, that Euery thing the
more ſubtill and pure, and
immateriall it is, the more
cloſelie it may vnite it ſelfe
to another Creature. So
the water will ſoake thorow
another body, and
vnite it ſelfe into euerie
part of it by inſinuating
his ſupple ioynts into euery
empty place and ouerture
of the body, vpon
which it is infus'd,
that it will ſeeme to make
but one body with it: as
in a veſſell full of aſhes;
which earth, being a

groſſer body cannot doe.
Againe, the Fire being a
more ſubtill and refined
body then the water will
vnite it ſelfe to the moſt
churliſh and impenetrable
body, after a very
cloſe and peruious manner;
as to a ſtone, yron,
ſteele, or golde, which the
water, being a more condenſed,
and leſſe fine body,
can neuer pierce or
ſoake into. Againe, a ſpirituall
ſubſtance will yet
more cloſely vnite it ſelfe
to a body, then this fineſt
and moſt ſubtill of corporeal
beings: And therfore
wee may remember
that Satan tells our Sauiour,

that a Legion of
them, that is ſix thouſand
eight hundred and thirty
(for the Romane Legion
conſiſted of 6100. foote,
and 730. horſe, though
heere I thinke not this
preciſe number but a
great multitude is meant)
did all couche and lodge
together in one poore
poſſeſſed man. Wherefore,
as wee ſee if a hundred
candles were lighted
vp in a roome, all the
beames of them would
be in the ſame place vnited
together, at leaſt locally,
though not eſſentially
(which thoſe that
are ſkilfull in the Opticks

demonſtrate by the ſeuerall
irradiations of Light
wherewith each of them
vnconfuſedly paſſe thorough
one another) ſo it
is with ſpirits, a thouſand
of them may be locally vnited
together without
any conſequent abſurditie,
becauſe their follows
no penetration of dimenſions,
and therfore filling
no place at all, they cannot
exclude one another
from the ſame place they
are in, as bodies doe.
               Againe, it muſt needes
bee confeſt, that the Diuine
Nature of our Lord
God may yet more nerely
cloſe with his creature▪
                  
in a ſtrayter vnion, then
any other, becauſe his eſſence
is not onely more
good, &amp; ſo more communicatiue
of it ſelfe, but incomparably
more immixt
and pure, then any
creatures (beſides himſelfe)
can be. This being
the prerogatiue royall of
Diuinity, to cōſiſt not of
Act and Power, or to be
ſomething after, which
before it was not (as longer
liu'd, or wiſer, or better,
or more glorious)
but to be Actus Purus, All
Act and Eſſence without
any reference of time, or
difference of qualitie.
That is, God is not as

Man or an Angell may
be; good, and true, and
wiſe, and liuing; but hee
is wiſedome it ſelfe, truth
it ſelfe, ſelfe-goodneſſe,
and ſelfe-life. Now wee
know in formall Vnions,
that is alwaies the cloſeſt
that is moſt communicable
of it ſelfe, and of
which the ſubiect whereunto
it is vnited, is moſt
capable. And therefore
it muſt needs bee, that
God who is Truth, may
vnite himſelfe to the vnderſtanding,
more cloſelie,
then a thing that is
true: becauſe the proper
obiect of the vnderſtanding
is Truth, not a true

thing; and ſo to the will,
becauſe hee is goodneſſe
it ſelfe, and life it ſelfe,
&amp; the will is a more proper
ſubiect of life and
goodneſſe, then it is of a
thing that is good and liuing.
               This is a retruſe, and
hidden, but in truth a very
diuine motion of the
gracious and formal vnion,
whereby God pleaſes
to impart his Diuinity to
his Creature. For looke
as wee ſee in the eye of a
man the liuely Image &amp;
form of the thing it ſees,
(which makes me cal this
a formall vnion) ſhining
euidently in it, without

which the eye could neuer
ſee the thing: ſo it is
in the jntellectuall part
of the ſoule. The thing
which is vnderſtood muſt
haue the jmage of it as
cleerely repreſented, and
vnited to the vnderſtanding,
as the viſible object
is to the eye: and therefore
it is a Truth famous
in the Shooles, Intellectus
eſt omnia. The vnderſtanding
is all things. Not
all things by the Eſſence
of it, but by the ſimilitude
it hath with it, in the
act of intellection.
               And this is the very
reaſon, why in ſpirituall
things, as long as wee

liue in our Bodies, our
vnderſtanding is ſo childiſh
and Infant-like; becauſe
in this blinde and
corporeall world, all Spirituall
Eſſences are repreſented
to it forma tantum
diſparata, in ſome deſperate,
that is, vnlike and
different forme &amp; ſhape,
to that which indeed and
in truth they are of (as if
a Painter ſhould expreſſe
the Sunne by a ſpot of
guilt, and ſhould draw
the Starres with a little
yellow Oakre, in his
draught of the heauenly
body) we cannot ſee their
owne faces, nor get the
true jmage of themſelues

into the eye of our vnderſtanding.
It was Gods
ſpeech to Moſes, who had
better eyes then any that
euer liued after him. Thou
canſt not ſee my face, For
there ſhall no man ſee mee,
and liue, Exo. 33. 20. Iſay
64. And therefore as
when the Angells of the
Lord haue beene ſeene among
vs, they appeared
ſometimes like beautifull
young men, as to Lot and
the Sodomites; ſometimes
like Chariots of
fire, as to Eliſhaes ſeruant;
ſomtime with countenā
                  ces
ſhooting like lightning,
Mat. 28. 3. ſo when
God himſelfe pleaſed to

deſcend vpon Mount Sinai,
or vpon our Sauiour
his ſonne, his ſpirituall
Eſſence, could neuer be
ſeene, but himſelfe came
riding downe in the ſimilitude
of a Doue, &amp; himſelfe
came down ſo clowded,
and guarded about
with fire, that neyther the
perſons, nor the eyes of
the Iſraelites could come
neere him. But when the
morning of glory ſhall ariſe,
wherein our ſoules
ſhall awaken from the
heauy eye-lid of our fleſh,
and the veyle of our body
ſhall firſt be remoued,
and after being depur'd
from his droſſe, be refined

into a bright and ſpirituall
body, wee ſhall
then ſee God as he is, wee
ſhall ſee him face to face, we
ſhall know him, as wee are
knowne of him: Which
natheleſſe is not to be vnderſtood
extenſiuely, as
if we ſhould comprehend
God in the whole extent
of his Diuinity, but diſtinctly
onely and truely:
as when wee ſee the Sea,
we ſee ſo much of it, as
can fall into our ſight
truely, and know it diſtinctly
from al other bodies,
to be the ſea: but
we cannot ſee all the Sea
at once, becauſe the obiect
is of too large a

breadth and extenſion.
               This whole diſcourſe
driues only to this iſſue.
There is a vnion of bloud
between Parents &amp; Children,
and this is a remote
and very ſeparable vnion.
And there is an vnion of
one fleſh betweene Man
and Wife, and this vnion
is of a ſhort continuāce,
and is ſoone parted by
death. And there is an
vnion of Place, and thus
Spirits may be locally vnited,
who yet may be at
extreame oddes and difference
one with another.
And there is an vnion of
affection, &amp; this Friends
are vnited with, and it is

(alas too ſoone) alterable
vpon the change of eyther.
And beſide all theſe
there is a myſticall, or
virtuall Vnion of the
members with the head,
and this the Church is vnited
to Chriſt by, from
whom it receiues the diuine
influences of all
grace and fauour. And
there is a Spirituall Vnion,
whereby all th' Elect
ſoules and bodies are not
onely inſpired, and I may
ſo ſpeake, Spirited with
the Holy Ghoſt, who
rules and ſwayes all the
thoughts and actions of
the ſoule, as the ſoule
doth all the parts and affections

of the body. And
laſt of all, there is a gracious
and admirable Vnion
of ſimilitude, whereby
wee are made whollie
conformable, and alike to
the Diuine being, which
is the moſt deſireable &amp;
accumulate bleſſedneſſe
of our Nature.
               So that looke as you
ſee the very bright image
of the Sunne ſo reflected
vpō the water ſomtimes,
that the dull Element
ſeemes to haue caught
downe the very glorious
body it ſelfe, to paint her
watry face with, and
lookes more like a part of
heauen, then like it ſelfe;

who in the abſence of the
Sunne, is all fabled with
blackneſſe, and darkneſſe,
and ſad obſcurity; but
vpon the firſt beames of
the heauenly body, is glazed
with a moſt noble &amp;
illuſtrious brightneſſe; ſo
is it with our whole man.
For when God ſhall thus
imprint and ſtrike himſelfe
into our darke being,
O how beautifull
ſhall the feet of Gods
Saints bee? Eſay 52. 7.
What a Diadem of ſtars
ſhall crowne their glorious
heads? Reuelat. 12.
How ſhall their amiable
bodies ſhine in Sun-like
Maieſty? Mat. 13. 4. Neither

let it bee thought a
vaine audacity of ſpeech,
to ſay that the countenance
and face of Gods
children ſhall break forth
into beames of more celeſtiall
glory, then the
mid-day ſunne euer yet
ſent abroad into the
World. For as S. Paule
tells vs, they ſhall be conform'd
to the Image of
his glorious body; ſo he
tels Agrippa, Acts 26. 13.
At mid-day. O King, I ſaw
in the way a light from heauen,
aboue the brightnes of
the Sunne, ſhining round about
me: which was no
other then the Light of
the countenance of our

Lord Ieſus, which ſight
as it ſtruck blindneſſe into
the face, and thicke
ſcales into the eies of perſecuting
Saul, ſo it dreſſed
the whole countenance
of ſuffering Stephen
with a moſt Diuine
and Angelical glory: and
had not the Light in reaſon
beene greater then
the Suns, it would haue
beene like the Moon and
Starres at mid-day, wholly
extinguiſht and inuiſible.
               Neyther let any man
amaze his vnderſtanding
with the manner how a
Spirituall ſubſtance can
ſo ſparkle, and be, as it

were viſible in the body.
Saint Auſtins compariſon
hath life in it, in the expreſſion
of that point.
Life in it ſelfe is inuiſible,
and cannot be ſeene, yet
it ſo freſhes the countenance,
and beautifies the
eyes, that when the body
wants it, and is dead, nothing
lookes more dreary
and ghaſtly then a Corps
doth: We ſee not life in
it ſelfe (ſayes the Father)
but wee ſee it ſhining in
the brightneſſe of the
eyes, and ſmiling in the
liuelihood and cheerefulneſſe
of the countenance.
And ſo it is with
a glorious body. God is

Life, and, like Life, cannot
bee ſeene in himſelfe
by any ocular aſpect, but
as Life in a Naturall, ſo
God in a glorious body
is moſt apparant, and
plainely viſible, and conſpicuous,
euen vnto our
eyes.
               But ſome perhaps will
thinke this diſcourſe of
ſpirituall ſatiety (I call it
ſpirituall, not excluding
the Body, but becauſe
our Bodies themſelues
ſhall be then ſpirituall, as
now our very ſpirits are
in a manner carnall) to be
fetch'd rather out of the
ſchooles of Reaſon, then
of Gods Word, and to

haue more ground in
Philoſophy then Faith.
For where in Scripture
ſhall we read of any ſuch
image of God to ſatiſfie
our Natures with? If we
turne to the 17. Pſalme
and the 15. verſe, we ſhal
there finde the portion of
the righteous excellently
deſcribed by Dauid: who
hauing before ſet out the
men of this world (who
haue their portion in this
life) their dimenſum,
which is their belly full
of Treaſures, abundance
of Children, and their
happineſſe to leaue their
ſubſtance to their Babes,
verſe 14. hee reflects his

thoughts into his owne
breſt, and ſings, As for
me, I will behold thy face
in righteouſneſſe, I ſhall
bee ſatisfied when I awake
with thy Image. This
made Dauids heart pant
after the ſight of Gods
face (for ſo the words originally
ſignifie,) Pſalm.
42. 1. This made him
pray, Lighten mine eyes
that I ſleepe not in death,
and needes muſt the eyes
of the righteous be lightened,
and then awaken,
(when the wicked ſhall
haue theirs ſhut vp in eternall
darkeneſſe) when
they ſhall behold the face
of God, and ſhall ſatisfie

with his Image their euigilant
ſoules. Wee ſhall
finde in Scripture beſides
this Image of God,
that for aye bleſſes the
ſoules of the righteous,
two other Images of the
wicked world, and of
wicked men, wherewith
the wicked ſtriue to ſatiſfie
their ſoules; but as S.
Paul 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   vs the image of
the world does 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
looſe continually his
forme and faſhion: ſo
Dauid tells vs, Pſalme the
73. the 20. that when God
awakes, he ſhal deſpiſe their
image. The image of God
ſatisfies the righteous,
when they awake to their

reward; becauſe there is
ſubſtance, and truth, and
goodneſſe in it: but when
God awakes to the puniſhment
of the wicked,
their image is ſo far from
bringing with it any ſatisfaction
of glory, that
in the iudgment of God
himſelfe (who cannot
but iudge moſt vprightly)
it is full of ſhame,
moſt ignoble, and
worthy to be deſpiſed,
hauing no ſubſtance, but
onely ſhadow; no truth,
but onely appearance, no
ground but onely opinion
to paint it ſelfe with:
and therefore looke what
difference of things there

is in the ſound iudgment
of one waking, and the
ſkipping and dauncing
phanſies of a dreaming
braine, ſo much &amp; more
is there betweene the
ſwelling images of ſecular
glory, and the diuine
image of God, when wee
ſhall awaken from thoſe
dreams, which the world,
as long as ſhee can keepe
vs in the cradle of our
fleſh, rocks, and pleaſantly
ſings vs a-ſleep in. And
therefore Dauid, hauing
ſpoken of the death of the
wicked, in the former
verſe of the fore-cited
Pſalme, O how ſuddenly
doe they conſume and periſh,

and come to a fearefull
end! preſently annexes:
As a dreame when one awaketh,
ſo, O Lord, when
thou awakeſt, thou ſhalt deſpiſe
their image. But let
vs leaue this golden Image
with all the dreaming
World (with Nebuchadnezar)
is troubled
with in their ſleepe, and is
angry with all that will
not fall down to worſhip
it; and returne to that Image
that deludes not
dreaming, but ſatisfies
our awaking ſpirits.
               As Dauid ſpeaks of his
owne, ſo S. Paul ſpeakes
of all the Elect ſoules of
God, Rom. 8. 29. that they

were predeſtinated to be
conform'd to this Diuine
image, and therefore in
the 2. to the Corinthians,
the 3. 13. 14. &amp;c. he makes
his difference betweene
the obſtinate Iew▪ and the
beleeuing Chriſtian, that
their hearts was ſtil veild,
and blinded with their
olde Moſaicall ſhadows,
and ceremonies; but wee
all (ſaies the Apoſtle) hauing
the veyle done away
in Chriſt, with open face beholding,
as in a glaſſe, the
glory of the Lord, or changed
into the ſame Image
from glory to glory, euen as
of the ſpirit of the Lord.
So that as the Moon and

the Starres, that hauing
no in-borne or inherent
Light ſtreaming from
themſelues, and yet gathering
together into
their burning faces the
beames of the Sun, freely
ſent abroad, and beſtowed
amongſt them, appear
like ſo many little images
of the great Lampe of
day. So all the Holy
Lamps of Heauen, made
for Gods ſeruice, haue
onely the Light of Gods
countenance to kindle
themſelues with, which
he out of his bounty caſts
abroad amongſt them,
and they according to
their ſeuerall capacities,

to fill vp their meaſures
of glory, moſt ambitiouſly
veſſell vp.
               This being the Royalty
of the Diuine Nature,
who is the ſpiritual ſonne
of eternall Eſſences, that
he, beyond all other, is
moſt emiſſiue and communicatiue
of himſelfe:
For as Light is more viſible
then any colour, and
ſends out in the eradition
of it, a more full and luminous
ſpecies of it ſelfe,
then any other thing: becauſe
it is (as the Philoſopher
calls) 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
the colour of all colours:
ſo God, who is the Light
of all Lights, muſt needs

in himſelfe bee moſt viſible,
though neither it to
the eye of an Owle, nor
God to the ſight of our
vnderſtanding, yet beetlebrowed,
can ſo appeare.
But when (as Dauid ſings)
our ſoules ſhall awaken,
and the youth of our bodies
ſhall be renewed as
the Eagles; both they
with the Diuinity, and
theſe with the Diuine humanity
ſhall be tranſformed
into the ſame image
of glory which they ſhall
behold in him. And
though now they blinke
at Sunne-ſhine, yet then
where the body of glory
is, thither ſhall the ſpirituall

Eagles be all gathered
together, and there
feede, and fill the righteous
hunger, and thirſt of
theirs.
               And this is the fulneſſe
of glory our Sauiour
meanes to ſatisfie them
in heauen with, who on
earth nouriſh in themſelues
the righteous hunger
after Grace. When
the vnderſtanding ſhall
be filled with truth, in
which is no ſhadow of
error, the will with goodneſſe,
in which is no mixture
of euill, the affections
with ioy and delight
in which ſhall be neyther
defect nor end; when the

body ſhall be ſatisfied
with Life that knowes no
dying, ſhall be quickned
with health, that feares
no ſickeneſſe, ſhall be imbrightned
with beautie,
that can neyther bee impayred
with diſeaſe, nor
impalled by death; when
the whole perſon ſhall be
crowned with honour &amp;
glory, ſhall be leagued in
friendſhip with Angells
and Saints, ſhall bee vnited
to Chriſt in body, to
the holy Ghoſt in Spirit,
to God in a bright ſimilitude,
and likeneſſe of his
Diuine nature: in a word,
when they ſhall enioy
(which this world is out

of hope of) honor without
ambition, beauty
without pollution, glory
without pride, power
without iniury, riches
without oppreſſion, all
good without any end of
poſſeſſing, feare of loſing,
or ſinne in ſpending. Let
vs therefore quicken our
drowſie ſpirits with
            
            
               IIII. A ſhort incitement to the
heauenly ambition of
Gods Saints.
               IT was a ſpeech of the
moſt ambitious Spirit

in the world, in the excuſe
of his high ſwelling
thoughts, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
If a man would do
iniurie, it ſhould bee for a
Kingdome, piety was to be
obſerued in leſſe matters;
as hee thought: but the
truth is, hee needed not
haue ſuppoſed it to bee
ſuch a difficult thing to
be perſwaded to doe iniury.
For as the Philoſopher
ſpeakes, Nothing
is more eaſie then to doe
another man wrong, and
he giueth the Reaſon why
Iuſtice although it be ſo
beautifull a Light in the
world, that as he ſayes of

it, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
neither the morning, nor
the euening ſtarre is halfe
ſo Oriently beautiful, yet
ſo few men are in loue
with it, becauſe it is the
good of another, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
wee are all
naturally engroſſers of
goods for our ſelues, but
wee are loth, though
iuſtly, to diuide or part
them with any other; and
therefore with more reaſon
the religious man,
who is the moſt ambitious
creature vnder heauen,
may whet and edge
his flaming deſires to goe
through all the ſweat and
labour of righteouſneſſe

with the ſame ſpeech inuerted.

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                  ▪ If a Kingdome
be the reward of
Piety, who would not be
religious? But it is a myracle
in reaſon to ſee, that
when there are three ſorts
of ambitious in the
world: Sinfull, Naturall,
and Religious: how many,
and thoſe of the choiceſt
wits, offer their harts,
and ſacrifice themſelues,
as whole burnt offerings
to the ambition of ſinne,
and how few ſet their
thoughts on fire with the
holy ambition of Gods
Saints. And yet there is
no difference betweene

ſinfull, and ſain
                     •
                  ly ambition
(for both would be
like God) but that the
firſt would be like him
without dependance, and
would be proud in being
ſo, affecting a diuine ſimilitude
beſide the right
meanes, and beyond the
due meaſure; and the other
is content to climbe
by the valley of Chriſts
humility to this mountaine
of holineſſe.
               The ſinfully ambitious
would haue Gods glory,
but not his goodnes, his
power, but not his iuſtice,
the Maieſty of his Kingdome,
but not the manner
of his gouernment.

And therefore all thoſe
Angelicall ſtars of Light,
whom God in the Morning
of his Works made
Heauen ſhine with, are
now become through
this ſinfull ambition, wandring
Starres, to whom is
reſerued the blackeneſſe of
darkeneſſe for euer. And
this was it, that ſmote not
onely ſo many ſtars out of
heauen, but would haue
ſtruck into hel the whole
poſterity of Adam, had
not our Sauiour ſnatch'd
vp ſome few of vs into
heauen with him: and yet
how many ſoules ſtill
ſcorche themſelues in
theſe flames? It was the

imperious ſpeech of the
Aſſyrian, Tyrian, and Romane
Princes. I will be
like the moſt high, I will
aſcend into Heauen, I will
exalt my throne aboue the
ſtarres of God, Eſay 14. I
am God, Ezech 28. I ſit a
Queen (mening as the Lady
and Commandreſſe
of the whole World) and
ſhall ſee no ſorrow, &amp;c.
Alas, how high this ſinfull
ambition would
climbe in thought, and
indeed how low doth it
fall! It aſpires to the ſides
of the North, Eſay 14. &amp;
13. verſe. And verſe the
15. it is caſt downe into
the ſides of the pit. It

would aſcend into Heauen,
verſe the 14. and in
the next it is brought
downe to hell. It fancies
to it ſelfe a high flight among
the ſtarres and Angells
of God. And loe
the ſhadows of darkneſſe
are moued from beneath,
to meet it, and the dead
ghoſts are ſtirred vp to ſalute
it with this deriſory
taunt. Art thou become like
vnto vs? How art thou fallen
from Heauen, O Lucifer,
ſonne of the Morning.
And theſe, perhaps great
princely and honourable
Diuels of Ambition may
ſeeme in compariſon of
the leſſer, to delude their

followers with a kinde of
b
                     •
                  aue and royall miſery.
But in very truth it is a
ſight full of wonder to
obſerue the children of
this generation, at how
ſmall game in their ſpirituall
riots, they will play
away the ſaluation of
their ſoules. O the cheap
damnation of ſinners!
With how ſeely baytes
their ſoules are angled into
eternall perdition! A
meſſe of pottage will buy
away Eſaus birth-right:
A ſmall vineyard will
make Ahab ſell himſelf to
worke ſinne, and forfeit
his kingdome and all his
poſterity to the wrath of

God. A fayre-look'd apple,
pleaſant to taſte, will
hooke into the Lake of
brimſtone, a whole world
of beguiled ſoules. The
Harlots beggerly bread
and water, Prou. 9. 17. will
get more followers then
Wiſedomes coſtly banquet
&amp; choiceſt wines, though
the bread bee ſtollen and
the waters hid. If GOD
ſhould liue amongſt vs,
thirty pence would buy
him. A cup of fornication
is enough to make all
the Kings of the Earth
wait vpon the Whore, &amp;
the Beaſt. And can it, can
it be, Sathan ſhould hyre
vs to bee the ſeruants of

ſinne with ſuch ſmall wages,
and God with a
Kingdome ſhould not
moue vs to be his ſonnes.
               O let not Nature in
wicked, and prophane, &amp;
vnreaſonable Creatures
go beyond Grace in profeſt
Chriſtians. Balaam
the Sorcerer would dye
the death of the righteous,
the naturall good
will hee bore himſelfe,
taught him to wiſh it.
And it is the obſeruation
of the Philoſpher: That
all Creatures naturally
deſire to draw and aſſemble
themſelues as cloſe to
the diuine Being, as poſſibly
they can, which hee

makes to bee the Reaſon
why there is in them all,
ſo vehement a deſire
(which hee calls of all other
the moſt naturall) of
begetting another like
vnto themſelues; becauſe
not being able in their
owne bodies to be euerliuing,
they deriue themſelues
to eternity by their
iſſues, thereby 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
as hee ſayes,
partaker of the Diuine
being, as farre as they are
able. This is therefore
the reaſon why there
is ſowne in our Nature,
Tantus amor prolis, &amp; generandi
gloria: but this
naturall and lawfull ambition

of glory in the
Creature is moſt liuelie
expreſt in the eight to the
Romans, of which I ſpake
in the former ſection. Let
vs therefore if the wicked
deſire the death, endeuor
to obtaine the life of the
righteous: if the whole
creation grone and ſigh,
and trauel to be deliuer'd
from the corruption,
whereunto our ſinne hath
imbondaged it, into the
glorious liberty of the
children of God, at leaſt,
as S. Paul ſpeakes in the
ſame chapter, groan with
them, and within our
ſelues, to bee deliuered
from our owne ſinne, and

to bee made partakers of
that glory which God
diuides among his ſaints.
               Let vs ſet before our
eyes thoſe Noble examples
which the Scripture
hath lighted vp for vs to
looke vpon. For this is
that heauenly Countrie
which Gods ſoiourners
and Pilgrims heere on
earth ſeeing a farre off,
ſweetly ſaluted, Heb. 11.
13. and trauelling as
ſtrangers thorough the
world, eſteemed onely
worthy of their ambition.
Thus Enoch walked
with God before his
death, and therfore without
death was tranſlated

to him: being, as S. Iude
ſpeakes, the ſeuenth from
Adam, whom God, happily
ſanctified to himſelfe
with eternall reſt, becauſe
he was the Sabbaoth of
Men. Thus Moſes preferred
the naked and ſolitary
wilderneſſe, before
the delights and treaſures
of Pharaohs Court; and
was not this the cauſe,
becauſe he looked 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
to the great recompence
of the Reward, by
Faith ſeeing him, who is
inuiſible, Heb. 11. 27. This
made Daniel eſteeme the
Lions Denne better then
Darius Palace, and the
three children aduenture

to meete heauen in hell,
God in the middeſt of a
furnace infernally heated.
This made not valiant
men onely, but weak women,
fearefull by nature,
but reſolute by faith, in
the midſt of all their tortures
not accept deliuerance,
but making their
way through all the cruel
mockings &amp; ſcourgings,
and bonds, and priſons,
and ſtones, and ſawes, &amp;
ſwoords of wilde perſecuting
Tyrants, paſſe on
to the Land of promiſe,
without deſire of liuing,
or feare of dying, Heb. 11.
36. This made the olde
Auncient-bearer of Valens
                  
the Emperour, and
elder Souldior of Chriſt,
Saint Baſil in his Oration
of him ſo much admires,
that ſignal Martyr Goelius
tell the raging and menacing
Prince, that he knew
his reward ſhold be greater
then his torment, and
when the Emperour promiſed
him very great
matters, to aſke him ſmiling,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  :
Whether hee had
any thing to giue him more
worth then the Kingdome
of heauen? In a word, this
carried the heart of olde
Simeon into ſuch a holy
extaſie of religious delight,
that earth could

hold him no longer, but
he muſt needs, as it were,
breake priſon, and leape
out of his olde body into
heauen. O what a deſire
of departure to it, doth a
true ſight of this ſaluation
kindle! Lord, ſaies he,
now letteſt thou thy ſeruant
depart in peace, &amp;c. for
mine eyes bane ſeene thy
ſaluation: As if he ſhould
ſay, Lord, now the child
is borne, let the olde man
die, now thy ſon is come,
let thy ſeruant depart,
now I haue ſeene thy ſaluation,
O let mee goe to
enioy it. Now I haue beheld
the humanity of thy
ſonne, what is worth the

looking vpon, but the diuinity
of ſuch a perſon,
which is able to make my
young Lord heere euen
proud of his Humilitie.
For ſo great a ioy of ſpirit
can neuer be thruſt vp
into ſo ſmall a Veſſell, as
an olde ſhrunke-vp body
of earth is. Since therefore
I haue teſtified of
thy Chriſt, ſince I haue
made an end of my dying
note. and ſung thee
my Chriſtmaſſe ſong;
ſince I haue ſeene thee, O
thou holy one of Iſraell,
whom no fleſh can ſee &amp;
liue, what haue I to do to
liue, O Lord? What
ſhould I weare this olde

garment of fleſh any
more? Thou haſt left thy
fatneſſe off, O thou faire
Oliue Tree, and the oyle
of it hath made mee haue
a cheerefull countenance:
thou haſt forſaken thy
ſweetneſſe, O thou beautifull
Vine, and thy fruit
hath warm'd thine olde
Seruant at the very hart.
Now therfore being thou
haſt powred thy new
wine into this old veſſell,
O giue the olde bottle
leaue to breake, O let me
depart in peace; for I
haue enough, I haue ſeen,
mine eyes haue ſeene thy
ſaluation.
               Theſe are high-wing'd

ambitious indeed, whoſe
thoughts creep not vpon
the earth, nor whoſe Honours
ſhall be euer layed
in the duſt: but that flye
among the Starres and
Angells of GOD: that
boaſt of their kinred with
the Almighty, and call
themſelues the Sonnes of
God, Wiſd. 2. whom our
Sauiour hath made the
fauourites of Heauen,
companions for his Angels,
co-heyres with himſelfe,
Temples for his
Spirit; Parts of his Bodily
and partakers of his Diuine
Nature; whoſe kingdomes
end not with their
liues, but begin with their

deaths; whoſe pleaſures,
vnlike to Ionathans hony,
kil not with taſting; whoſe
gains haue no fire-brands
like Sampſons Foxes, no
hell in their tales; whoſe
celeſtiall banquets are
like the feaſtes of Cana,
where their water is turned
into wine, &amp; al their
teares into ioy, not like
faire Abſolons (a Type of
worldly courteſie) to his
Brother Amnon, who
when his heart was merry
with wine, ſlew him, and
fill'd his wine-bowle vp
againe with his owne
bloud, ending all the ioy
of the feaſt in teares and
lamentation. Indeede as

long as they liue heere in
their mortified fleſh, eſpecially
if the times bee
clowdy, the world would
thinke their high mindes
and abiect bodies very
vn-euen matches. For
who if hee had met with
the ancient Citizens of
Heauen, wandring about
in ſheepes-skins, &amp; goat-skins,
being deſtitute, afflicted,
tormented (as the
Apoſtle ſpeakes, Hebr. 11.
would not haue thought
them the pooreſt ſnakes
aliue? But greateſt ſpirits
weare not alwaies gayeſt
Armes, nor the beſt Souldier
the higheſt Creſt.
And therefore although

a man would thinke the
kingdom of Heuen much
diſhonoured by our Sauior,
when he auileſ, humbles
it in the compariſon
of a ſmall Pearle, and a
little graine of muſtardſeed,
yet indeed it is not
diſcountenanced, but diſcouered
by the reſemblance.
For though the
ſeed be the ſmalleſt, yet
the plant is the talleſt of
all the hearbs that grow,
ſuch a vitall flouriſh is
there in the little heart of
it, that what Virgil ſpeaks
of the Bee, may well be
applied to this vigorous
graine, Ingentes animos
anguſto in corpore voluit.
                  
Neyther hath the richeſt
pearle of the Orient any
better out-ſide then the
dirty ſhell of an Oyſter,
which perhaps S. Paul alluded
vnto in the 2. Cor.
4. 7. where ſpeaking of
Gods Saints, and this
heauenly treaſure in them
hee tells vs wee haue this
pearle, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   in
no better than ſcalopſhels.
               Cleane oppoſite are
theſe glories, &amp; delights,
&amp; this ambition to thoſe
of our vnder-world. Gather
all the roſes of pleaſure
that grow vpon the
earth, ſayes not the Greek
Epigram truely of them:

                           ,
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           .
                     
                     
                        The Roſe is faire &amp; fading,
ſhort and ſweet,
                        Paſſe ſoftly by her:
                        And in a moment you ſhall
ſee her fleet,
                        And turne a bryer.
                     
                  
               
               They looke fairely, but
they are ſodainely diſpoiled;
whereas, contrary all
the flowers of Paradiſe
(like the Church, Cant. 1.
5. 6.) ſun-burnt &amp; froſted
with the heat and cold of
this tempeſtuous world,
looke black and homely,
but flouriſh inwardly
with diuine beauty, and

are all glorious within.
So that wee may well ſay
of the Church as the Poet
ſings.

                           .
                     
                     
                        She's black: what then? ſo are
dead coales, but cheriſh,
                        And with ſoft breath
them blow,
                        And you ſhall ſee them glow
as bright and flouriſh,
                        As ſpring-borne Roſes grow.
                     
                  
               
               The reaſon of which
is, becauſe the World
wants (God purpoſely ſo
ordering it, leaſt we ſhold
relie vpon her Egyptian
reedes) thoſe two mayne
iettes, to ſuſtaine her crazie

buildings with which
the Courts of GODS
houſe are moſt gracefully
pillard &amp; vpheld, Selfeſufficiency
and Perpetuitie.
For who euer ſaw all the
goods euen of this world
meet together in one perſon,
&amp; conſtantly attend
him to his graue, Morall
Vertue, and Knowledge, &amp;
Honour, Friends, Riches, &amp;
Pleaſure, Health, Strength,
and Beauty, Which are
therfore inſufficient, both
becauſe they are commō
                  ly
ſeioyn'd one from another,
and haue in themſelues
no ſatisfying nature.
For what rich man
deſires not more wealth?

or what great man thirſts
not after more honour?
or what ſcholar ſtudies
not for more knowledge.
But let vs grant what no
man ſhall euer finde,
Knowledge, Vertuous;
Vertue, Honorable; Honour,
Healthfull; Health,
Strong; Strength, Beautiful;
Beauty, befriended,
rich, &amp; pleaſant; all theſe
met together to bleſſe
one ſubiect. Yet becauſe
the Meaſure of them all is
our Life, and that is of ſo
ſhort a ſize as Dauid
ſpeakes, Behold, thou haſt
made my life as it were a
ſpan long, and my daies are
euen as nothing: (he ſayes

not indeede they are nothing
at al, but they are as
neer it as may be, they are
euen as nothing, neither
doth hee ſay, his life is a
whole ſpan-long, but as it
were a ſpan lōg, the word
in the originall, ſignifies
but a handbreadth) how
can they but, for want of
perpetuitie, fall all vpon
our heads, &amp; without the
great grace of God; make
vs ſo much the more miſerable
by their loſſe, as
before in their poſſeſſion
we thought our ſelues
more happy then other
men. Seeke we, ſeeke we
therefore the ſufficiency of
Grace heere, and heereafter

the perpetuity &amp; fulneſſe
of glory will ſucceed.
For as Dauid ſpeaketh,
Light is ſowne for
the righteous, and gladneſs
for the vpright in heart.
The ſeedes of them both
are ſowne in our corruptible
ſtate, but in the ſtate
of incorruption wee ſhall
reape the harueſt. What
if theſe ioyes cānot ſmile
vpon as with their owne
faces, but are as S. Paul
ſpeakes (who had ſeene
them) vnutterable in their
natures; (as what tongues
of Men and Angells can
expreſſe muſicall ſounds
to a deaf man? or deſcribe
the glorious Light, or diuine

Beauty, the viſible
and celeſtial bodies flame
with to him that is blind)
yet let vs aſſure our ſelues
the honour of our faith is
ſo much the greater, by
how much the leſſe we ſee
to cauſe our beleefe, and
thogh Thomas was bleſſed
in his ſeeing, yet hee was
chid for not beleeuing
but vpon ſight, with this
comfortable reprehenſion
to vs. Bleſſed are they
that haue not ſeene, and yet
haue beleeued. For ſure as
I ſaid before, if the glory
of GOD were not conceal'd,
it would neuer be
knowne who would loue
him for himſelfe, becauſe

all men would loue him
for his glory.
            
         
         
            
               
                  GENES. 26. 12. Then Iſaac ſowed in that
Land, and receiued the
ſame yeere, an hundred
fold.
            
            LEt vs goe on now
from the ſpiritual harueſt
of our ſoules, wherein
God grant vs to be all
ſharers, becauſe heauen is
the field: and the fruit
wee ſhall thereby reape,
will be eternall glory, to
the harueſt whereby our
bodies are ſuſtained, and

which maintains our life
heere: that if wee be ſtill
earthly minded men, and
plow in all our hopes into
theſe ſandy furrowes,
yet when wee ſee in this
ſtory of Iſaac, that it is
Gods bleſſing onely that
cloaths the valleis ſo thick
with corn, that they laugh
and ſing for ioy (as Dauid
ſings of them, Pſ. 65. 13.)
we may, if not becauſe he
will banquet &amp; repleniſh
our ſoules with Diuine
ſatiety that flouriſhes in
heauen, yet euen in meere
good huſbandry that hee
may feed &amp; preſerue our
bodies with the food that
growes out of the earth,

become religious men, &amp;
ſuch as wait vpon Gods
bleſſings in the improuement
of all the labours &amp;
ſweate of our ſeuerall callings.
It will bee a good
fruit of the earth, if we vſe
it to carry our thoughts
vp into heauen, there to
honour God with praiſe,
and thankeſgiuing for his
bleſſing vs heere.
            In the generall ſuruey
of which words, after wee
haue diuided them into
Iſaacs labour, Then Iſaac
ſowed in that Land, &amp; his
reward, and receiued the
ſame yere an hundred fold,
wee will take hold firſt of
this one obſeruation.
            
               
               I. That euery Creature which
would bee preſerued in
his Calling by the bleſſing
of God, muſt labour
for it.
               FOr as GOD would
haue the World coſt
himſelfe ſixe daies labour
(though in one moment
he could haue finiſh'd it)
ſo hee ſets vs to taſke, by
his owne example, to our
weekely ſtint: Sixe dayes
ſhalt thou labour, Exod. 20.
9. and doe all that thou haſt
to doe. Which is not to
bee vnderſtood as a Permiſſion,
                  
but as a Praecept:
as though God gaue vs
onely leaue, &amp; not charge
to labour. For hee ſayes
not, ſixe daies thou Maiſt
labour, but ſix daies thou
Shalt labour. If our
mouths will eat (as Salomon
tels vs, All the labour
of a man is for his Mouth,
Eccleſ. 6. 7.) our browes
muſt ſweat for it. For as
the Heathen had a Prouerbe
among them, Dij
venaunt omnia laboribus.
Their Gods, they ſayd
ſold all for labour: ſo we
may truely ſay of GOD
indeed: hee hath ſet the
price of all his earthly
bleſſings to be ſweat. In

the ſweat of thy brow thou
ſhalt eat thy bread all the
daies of thy life, Geneſis 3.
Neither let the Maſter
thinke to wipe off all his
ſweat to the brow of his
ſeruant, as though (like
our Gallants) hee were
borne onely to diſport &amp;
pleaſure, and his ſeruants
to labour and toyle for
him. No, euery Man is
Gods Taſkeman, and it
is as naturall for vs to labour,
as it is for flame to
aſcend: ſo Eliphaz ſpeaks
of vs, Iob. 5. ver. 7. Man is
borne to labour, as a ſparke
to flie vpwards, Indeed
the labors of men are different,
ſome of mind, and

ſome of body, ſome in the
field, ſome in the Citie,
ſome abroad at Sea, and
ſome at home: but labour
will meete a man euery
where, be hee where hee
will. It is our portion
vnder the Sunne, as Salomon
tells vs: Behold that
which I haue ſeene, ſayes
the wiſe man, Eccleſ. 5. 18.
It is good for a man to eate,
and to drinke, and to enioy
the good of all his labour,
which he taketh vnder the
Sunne, for it is his portion.
So that euery one that
would enioy the good
creatures of GOD (this
ſubceleſtiall happineſſe
which flouriſhes vnder

the Sunne) if hee would
eate and drinke, or enioy
any good, it muſt be of
his labour, his owne labour,
not another mans;
for that is to ſteale another
mans goods, and
with his ſweate to warme
our own browes. And ſo
ſeuere was the holy Apoſtle
of Chriſt in this point
(that Golden and Elect
inſtrument of Gods grace
to vs) who in labours excelled
them all that were
hired into Chriſts vineyard
to worke, that hee
would haue him ſtarued
to death, that to maintain
his life would not labor:
Hee that will not labour, let

him not eate, ſayes the Apoſtle,
2 Theſ. 3. 10.
               
               It were vnneceſſary to
adde more out of the
word of God, to acquaint
vs with our duety of labour,
the places to this
purpoſe, and the Scripture
in this argument is
prodigall. Thou ſhalt eat
the labour of thy hands, Pſ.
128. 2. Epheſ. 4. 28. Let
him that ſtole▪ ſteale no more
but rather let him labour,
working with his hands the
thing that is good, that hee
may haue to giue to him that
needeth. Where wee ſee
the Apoſtle ties not onelie
euerie man to his
worke, but would haue

him, though hee labour
with his owne hands to
get his liuing, yet to giue
ſomething to him that
needeth, &amp; wants hands
or feete, or health, or
ſtrength, or liberty, wherby
to labour. Looke then
as we ſee a field, as long as
it hath any heart in it, if it
be manured, and tilled, &amp;
ſowne, and weeded, and
well huſbanded in euery
part, neuer deceiues the
hopes of the greedy huſbandman,
but paies him
in his own ſeed with the
moſt lawfull vſury of
naturall, and very plentifull
encreaſe: which if it
bee neuer wrought vpon

with the labour of man,
but falls perhaps into the
hands of the ſluggard,
growes preſently full of
nothing but thiſtles and
thornes, ranke hurtfull
weedes, as Salomon tels vs
Prou 24. 30. I went by the
field of the ſluggard, and by
the vineyard of the ſlothfull
man, and loe it was al ouergrowne
with thornes and
nettles had couered the face
thereof: ſo is it with the
body of man: If it be wel
and faithfully laboured, it
is fruitfull both to himſelfe,
his family, and the
whole Common-wealth:
but if it ſleep away all his
time in idleneſſe. hee

growes not onely vnprofitable,
but full of noyſom
vices, and is as the Poet
cals him onely, fruges conſumere
natus, a hurtfull
Vermin, good for nothing
but to liue vpon the
ſpoyle. Are not al things
imbrightned with vſe, and
ruſtied with lying ſtill?
Let but the little Bee become
our miſtreſſe.
               Is ſhee not alwaies out
of her artificiall Nature,
either building her waxen
Cabinet, or flying abroad
into the flowry
Meadowes, or ſucking
honey from the ſweete
plants, or loading her
weake thighes with waxe

to build with, or ſtinging
away the theeuiſh Droan
that would faine hiue it
ſelfe among her labours,
and liue vpon her ſweete
ſweat? Ignauum, fucos, pecus
a praeſepibus arcent.
And ſhal this Little creature,
this Naturall good-houſwife
thus ſet her ſelfe
to her buſineſſe? and ſhall
we droane away our time
in idleneſſe, and which alwaies
followes it, vicious
liuing? Shall our fieldes
labour ſo faithfully to reward
vs, and ſhall we betray
our whole liues to
idleneſſe and ſloath. Find
mee but one example in
the World to countenance,

and ſample a man
in his idleneſſe.
               GOD himſelfe is the
watchman of Iſrael, that
neuer ſlumbers &amp; ſleepes.
My Father workes (ſayes
our Sauiour) and I worke.
The holy Angels are alwaies
either aſcending vp
vnto God (as we may ſee
in Iacobs ladder) that is,
lifting their thoughts vpwards
to honour him in
their eternall ſong, Holy,
Holy, Holy. Lord GOD of
Sabbaoth, &amp;c. or deſcending
from God to Men
with his bleſſings, as being
his Miniſtring Spirits
ſent for the good of the
Elect to pitch their pauillions

round about, and
defend vs from many ſpirituall
and blind dangers,
which, alas, our ſoules
neuer ſee. Not one of
them all was ſeene to bee
idle, or ſtand ſtill.
               Man himſelfe (which
is worthy our obſeruing)
euen then, when hee was
firſt paradis'd in the Garden
of pleaſure, yet had
ſomething to doe in it,
and was not ſuffered to
walke idlely vp &amp; downe
like a Loyterer, or Idleſbye
that had nothing at
all to doe: but was ſet to
keepe it &amp; dreſſe it, Gen. 2.
Labour hee muſt though
ſweat he ſhould not, and
buſineſſe hee had to doe,

though ſweat hee ſhould
not, and buſineſſe hee
had to doe, though in
the doing of it he felt no
wearineſſe or toyle.
               And as theſe moſt noble
creatures of God Angels
and man were not
ſuffered to bee idle, ſo if
wee looke vp to the heauens
themſelues, we ſhall
there ſee there that mighty
body in continuall
motion, neuer ſtanding
ſtill, but flying about the
world with incredible
ſwiftneſſe, that Dauids
great Giant, who euery
morning like a Bridegroome
comes out of
his Eaſterne chamber, &amp;

delights to run the heauenly
races God hath ſet
him, with all the leſſe
ſtarres of the glorious
body, might ſhed their
beames vpon the Earth
in the ſeaſons of it, &amp; ſo
bring foorth hearbes and
fruites for the ſeruice of
man and beaſt.
               It is indeede a naturall
Truth, Omne Corpus naturale
quieſcit in loco proprio.
Euery naturall body is
quieſcent in his owne proper
place: and yet wee ſee
though all gladly reſt in
their owne regions, and
inuade not the confines
of their neighbour Elements,
yet they are alwayes

mouing and coaſting
about in their owne
orbes and circuits, thereby
teaching vs to labour
euery man in the circle
of his owne calling, and
not to buſie-body out
abroad with other newe
workes. The Aire breakes
not into the quarters of
Heauen, and yet, wee ſee,
it is alwayes fann'd from
place to place, and neuer
ſleepes idly in his owne
regions: the reaſon is, becauſe
otherwiſe it would
ſoone putrifie it ſelfe and
poyſon vs all with the
ſtinking breath of it, did
not the diuine prouidence
of God driue it

about the World, with
his Windes, that ſo it
might both preſerue it
ſelfe, and ſerue to preſerue
vs, which otherwiſe
it could neuer
doe.
               And truly whether we
aſcend vp into Heauen,
or deſcend with Dauid into
the deepe, we may diſcerne
the whole Ocean,
which is a farre more
ſluggiſh element then
the Ayre, neuer reſt, but
euer moued either by the
Windes, or by a proper
motion, whereby naturally
it ebbes and flowes
to preſerue it ſelfe ſweet
and wholeſome for thoſe

creatures that liue in it,
and withall that it might
by ſuch inter-tides be the
more ſeruiceable to the
vſe of man in the conueiance
of commodities
from ſhoare to ſhoare.
So that in a word, euery
thing moues for man,
&amp; ſhould man only himſelfe
be idle &amp; ſtand ſtill.
               Giue mee but one example
in the whole
World of ſloath, and
reſtiue idleneſſe, but one,
and I will giue thee leaue
to keepe Holy-day, and
play away all thy life
without ſweat or labour:
only perhaps of a ſtanding
poole, and that

growes noiſome that no
man can endure it: or of
ſome deformed Toade,
and that is full ſwolne
with rankour and poiſon;
or it may be of an idle
Droane, and that becauſe
it plaies in Summer, dies
in Winter: But if wee
looke vp to Heauen, that
will teach vs to runne the
races God ſets before vs
with ioy and gladneſſe;
if the holy Angels may
inſtruct vs, they will take
vs out a leſſon of faithfull
labour, both in our
thoughts to God, and
actions to men. All the
Creatures of God will
ſet vs a worke by their examples.

Chuſe therefore
whether thou wilt
with thy vitious idleneſſe
be of a corrupted, and
venemous nature, and ſo
die; or exerciſe thy ſelfe
in the holy labours thy
vocation cals thee to,
like the bleſſed Angels,
and all other the more
noble Creatures of God.
               And that we may ſee
reaſon why wee ſhould
labour, wee muſt know
that it is both a Diuine
and naturall Truth, Deus
&amp; Natura nihil faciunt
fruſtra: God and Nature
made nothing idle. It is
for vs the heards of the
field, and the fowles of

Heauen, and the fiſh in
the Seas labour to bring
forth their young. It is
for vs the wearie Oxe is
yoakt to labour, and the
Horſe takes the bridle into
his mouth to eaſe vs
by his trauaile. It is for
vs the poore Silke-worm
ſpinnes her clew, and the
thriftie Bee gathers her
honey to the combe: but
as all theſe labour for vs,
ſo it is our labour that orders
and guides them,
and ſets them all a worke
firſt. Indeed God hath
of his goodneſſe made
them our ſeruants, and
put our feare vpon them.
The feare of you ſhall be

vpon all Creatures, Gen.
9. 2. But it is not our
parts to vſe their labours
to make our ſelues idle,
but if wee would haue
them labour for vs, wee
muſt be fellow-labourers
with them for our ſelues.
And indeed two ſpeciall
reaſons would God haue
vs labour for; one to keep
vs from the greene-ſickneſſe
of Idlenes, which
in truth is the immediate
mother of all Sinne, as
wee may ſee by Dauids
Tower-walke; and the other
for the more full enioying
of our life and
health. For as it is labour
that procures all things

neceſſary for our life and
health, as meates and
drink. clothing &amp; houſing:
ſo it is labour that
preſerues our health, by
warming our blood, that
it be not gellied with vnkindly
colds into rheums
and diſperſing thoſe ill
humors which with idleneſſe
would grow vpon
vs, and by prepuring the
body more delightfully
both to receiue nouriſhment
without ſurfet, and
without diſquiet, reſt, &amp;
ſleepe.
               Ye ſee therefore there
is both great reaſon for
vs to labour if wee would
enioy our health, and neceſſitie

if we would ſupply
the wants of our own
liues and example, if wee
would follow either the
command of God, or
the patterne of other
the moſt honourable
creatures God hath
made.
               Now let not here the
good huſbandman becauſe
(he as Iſaac) tills his
ground and ſowes it, engroſſe
all labour into his
owne calling, and ſo
thinking himſelfe onely
the true labourer, quarrell
with all other profeſſions
as more idle, and
leſſe neceſſarie. Let the
good huſbandman haue

alwayes his due honour
reſerued him; but let not
the good huſbandman
thinke all other men bad-huſbands
becauſe hee is
good, for hee may bee a
bad man, though hee bee
a good huſbandman, in
ſo thinking. For as man
himſelfe is diuided into
ſeuerall reſpects of body
and ſoule, eſtate and perſon;
ſo euery calling that
is lawfully employed in
the prouiding for any of
theſe, hath in it true labouring
men. The huſbandman
indeed he ſees
the body, the ſhepheard
cloathes it, the Architect
houſes it, and the Phyſitian

cures it. It were a labour
but to reckon vp the
ſeuerall calling that labour
about the body, and
indeede would paſſe my
skill to name them: ſo about
the eſtates of men,
Iudges and Lawyers, and
Notaries and Officers labour:
and about the perſons
of men, Princes and
Magiſtrates labour, to
keepe them in ciuill order
and gouernment; and
about the ſoule of man
the Miniſter of God labours.
I cannot ſtand to
euidence the labour of
all theſe callings: I will
onely make it plaine becauſe
the calling of a Miniſter

is by ſome ſlighted,
as a matter of no great
paines and ſweat. That
            
            
               II. A faithfull Miniſter is a
great labourer.
               I Would not willingly
make compariſons betweene
him and the huſbandman,
and ſay his labour
is beyond theirs:
but this I may ſafely ſay,
that God himſelfe compares
him not onely to
a huſbandman, but to
ſhew the greatneſſe of
his labour, to euery calling

indeed that is moſt
ſweated with induſtrie
and toyle.
               I know all men thinke
their owne callings moſt
laborious, but whether
thinke you it eaſier to
plow vpon hard ground,
or vpon hard ſtones?
whether to commit your
ſeed; to thoſe furrowes
that will return you fruitfull
thankes; or thoſe, that
for your labor will ſpoyle
your ſeed, &amp; requite you
with reproch and ſlander?
whether to ſuch
ground as is good, and
naturally opens her boſome
to drinke in the
dewes of heauen that fall

vpon her, and gladly receiues
the Sunne beames
ſhed from God to warm
and make fruitfull the
ſeede credited to her
wombe, or ſuch ground
as neuer thirſts after the
watering of Apollos,
though as Moſes ſpeakes
(Deut. 32. 2.) his words
drop as the raine, and his
ſpeech diſtill as the dew;
neuer can indure the
light of heauen to ſhine
vpon it, but lies alwayes
in darkeneſſe, and in the
ſhadowes of death? yet
ſuch ground (ſtones I
ſhould haue ſayd) did the
diuine courage of Stephen
meet with in Ieruſalem

(Act. 7. 59.) ſuch S.
Paul wrought on at Lyſtra
(Act. 14. 19.) ſuch
Moſes and Aaron and Ioſua
toyled vpon in the
wildernes (Num. 14. 10.)
ſuch the Prophets (Matt.
21, 25.) ſuch the Prince
of the Prophets found in
his owne inheritance,
though he had before (as
we ſee in Eſay 5. 2.) pickt
all the ſtones himſelfe out
of it. (Iohn 8. 59).
               
               What one difficultie
or danger is the rougheſt
calling aſſaulted with,
that his is not. Does the
plowmans labour know
no end, but is it as the
Poet ſpeakes of it: Labor

actus in orbem, Quique in
ſe ſua per veſtigia voluitur?
So is his. Does the
Shepheard, the ſun-burnt
and froſted ſhepheard,
watch ouer his flockes by
night, ſtrengthen the diſeaſed,
ſet apart the ſound,
binde vp the bruiſed, ſeek
out the loſt, reſcue thoſe
that are preyed vpon? ſo
does he. Marches the ſoldier
before the face of
death? liues hee among
the pikes of a thouſand
dangers? walks he throgh
his owne wounds and
blood? So does he: but
as the ground this ſpirituall
plowman tils is harder,
ſo the wolues &amp; Lyons

this Shepheard watches
againſt are fiercer,
and the Armies he graples
with of another temper
then ſuch as are made
like himſelfe of fleſh and
blood; being Powers and
Principalities, ſpirituall
wickedneſſes, &amp; worldly
gouernors, one of whom
could in a nights ſpace
ſtrikes dead the liues of a
hundred foureſcore and
fiue thouſand ſouldiers
at once, all armed and
embattayld together. Iſay
37. 36.
               
               Let all the Princes of
valour that euer liued,
bring into the field their
moſt tried and ſignall

warriour, whoſe face and
breſt ſtand thickeſt with
the hononourable ſtarres
of braue aduentures; if I
doe not ſingle out to encounter
him one ſouldier
that beares in his body
the markes of the Lord
Ieſus, who ſhall haue
broken through an Iliad
of more dangers and
perils, then he, let Gath
and Aſcalon triumph ouer
Sion once againe, &amp;
let it be ſaid that a ſecond
and more noble Saul is
falne vpon his high places,
then euer yet fell before.
For wee ſhall finde
him all the world ouer in
labours more abundant,

in iourneys more often,
in more perils in the city,
in the wilderneſſe, in the
ſea, more often in watchings,
and faſtings, in hunger
and thirſt, in cold &amp;
nakedneſſe, in priſon
more frequent, and ofter
in wearineſſe and death.
2. Cor. 11. 23. &amp;c. Let not
him therefore that ſowes
the earth with his labor,
ſlander the ſpirituall tilth
of our ſoules with lazie
thoghts, alas! in the times
of peace, contempt is the
greateſt harueſt we reape
and in the tempeſts of
perſecution, our blood is
the firſt ſeed is ſowne in
the Church. But enough

of this generall theame
of labour, Let vs now go
on to
            
            
               III. The ſeueral parts of Iſaacs
Labour and Reward.
               SOwing then is the
matter or ſubſtance of
his labour, and the circumſtances
are three.
Firſt of perſon, Iſaac a
religious perſon ſowes;
the next of Time, hee
ſowes in a time of famin
and dearth; the laſt of
place, it is the ground of
ſtrangers, the the land of

the Philiſtims he ſowes in.
His Reward followes his
labour, wherein we looke
firſt vpon Iſaac, in the
manner of the benefite,
which is by Receipt: hee
does not take it as a due,
but receiues it as a reward,
he makes not himſelfe
the Lord, but the
Steward of Gods gift:
and then we caſt our eyes
vpon God (as the eyes of
all things looke vpon
thee O Lord) who commends
the benefit by his
celeritie in giuing which
was in the ſame yeare.
Secondly, by Iſaacs neceſſitie
of receiuing, it
being now a needfull

time of Famine; and laſt
by the meaſure and ſize
of returning his ſeede,
which was not thirty, nor
ſixtie, but a hundred
fold.
               Now if we regard either
the ſubſtance or the
circumſtances of the
words, a man would
thinke (as the world now
goes) that Iſaack had neither
reaſon, or neede to
ſowe in ſuch a Land and
at ſuch a time, as he did.
For that hee was exceeding
rich, is confeſt of all,
both by the gifts of Abimelech
the King of the
Philiſtims which he gaue
him, and by the inheritance

of his Father Abraham
which he left him:
and therefore what neede
had he to labour?
               We know it is the order
of many men, if they
haue liued long in the
Countrey and by their
labours haue enriched
themſelues, they forſake
the fields, and betake
themſelues to the delights,
and eaſe of the Citie:
and againe Citizens
when they are well feathered
by their trades,
they flye abroad ſtraight
to purchaſe ſomething in
the Countrey, that they
may there ſummer themſelues
in their bowers

and arbours of pleaſure:
they are all ſoone wearie
of their labour, euen as
ſoone as they are enricht
by it. Which though
it be allowable in men
ancient, as the Poet aduiſes: Solue ſeneſcentem mature
ſanus equum;Eſpecially if not only
Age, but ſome diſeaſe
and weakeneſſe of their
bodies requires it: for
ſo God diſmiſt the Leuites
at 50. yeares old
from their ſeruice at his
Altar, yet it is not ſo in
men, either able to labour,
or without labour
vnable to liue. For here

wee ſee Iſaac a rich man,
and now paſt threeſcore
yeares old (as wee may
gather from the 25. verſe
of the former Chapter)
yet ſtill labours and ſowes
his ground.
               Againe, let a man be
but indifferently left by
his Friends, though hee
doe liue in the Countrey,
yet he will (as he out of
his young gentilitie will
pleaſe to boaſt) ſcorne to
follow the Plow; he will
keepe perhaps a Caſt of
Hawkes, or a Kennell of
Hounds, and he will call
them and follow them
day by day; but thats all
the calling he will follow.

Queſtionleſſe, Hawking
and Hunting are both
lawfull; but only to make
recreations of, not to
make callings of. For he
that makes the following
of ſuch ſports his only
calling, inuerts and turns
the order of God vpſide
downe. For whereas
God made all beaſts naturally
to ſerue man, he
ſpends his life in ſeruing
and following of beaſts,
and ſo makes himſelfe the
ſeruant of thoſe creatures,
of which God hath
made him the Lord:
weakely eſteeming that
the priuiledge of his eſtate
and his bleſſing aboue

others, which Noah
wiſely laied vpon Canaan
as of all other the greateſt
curſe. A ſeruant of
ſeruants ſhall he be: but
Iſaack thinkes it no diſparagement
to his Gentilitie
to till the Earth: nor
Iacob that was his heire to
follow Sheepe, though
perhaps my Lord Eſau
goe a hunting euery day
an ende. Yet I thinke
not Iſaac was a Plowman,
but I thinke he followed
his ſeruants that
were ſo, and in ſuch labour
there is no man, but
ſhall finde as much wiſedome
as delight, and
health.
               
                  
Beſides, if a man would
labour vpon the ground,
one would ſuppoſe, being
rich, the ground
ſhould be his owne, not
anothers: what would
one of our ſmall heires
ſay, ſhould I now turne
Farmour. I thanke God
I haue beene brought vp
after another faſhion, and
haue ground enough of
mine owne to liue vpon
by other mens labours.
Well I make no queſtion
but Iſaac was as well
brought vp as ſuch idle,
out of calling Gentlemen,
and yet he plowes,
and ſowes, not only another
mans ground, but

the ground of ſtraungers,
where hee could exſpect
nothing but hard dealing,
which indeed hee
found.
               The laſt circumſtance
is of the time, which was
a time of Famine; wherein
all men are moſt diſcouraged
to ſowe, both
becauſe of their preſent
want of that ſeede they
caſt into the ground
which might ſerue themſelues,
and becauſe they
feare the yeare to come
may proue as barren, as
that which was paſt: Yet
for all this, Iſaac though
rich, neither thinkes it
too meane a calling for

him to till the ground,
neither is diſcouraged
from labouring, though
he ſpent his ſweat vpon
the ground of ſtrangers,
and ſowed in a moſt vnſeaſonable
time, and what
might the reaſon of this
be?
               Firſt, Iſaac was a religious
perſon, and lookt
aſſuredly for Gods bleſſing,
which he found and
therefore ſowed. From
whence we gather this inſtruction.
Tis good huſbandrie
to bee a religious
man, and one of the children
of Abraham, that is,
a faithfull man.
               
               Secondly, Iſaac knew

that hee who meant to
reape the fruit of Gods
bleſſing, muſt ſowe the
ſeede of his owne labour,
in ſome lawfull and honeſt
courſe, and therefore
he ſowed, whence ariſes
this Obſeruation, That as
euery man muſt vſe the
meanes, that would be profited
by Gods bleſſings: ſo
that Huſbandry hath beene
an auncient and honourable
meanes of life.
               
               Thirdly, Iſaac had
Gods promiſe to bleſſe
him in the third verſe of
this Chapter, euen in this
vnlikely place, and therefore
ſowed among ſtrangers,
and from hence we

may borrow this direction.
A Childe of God makes
Gods will the rule of all his
actions, though it ſeeme neuer
ſo repugnant to his reaſon.
               
               And to conclude, Iſaac
had learnt by experience,
that God was not ruled
by nature, but was the
Ouer-ruler of it, and
therefore though Famine
ſhould haue eaten vp all
the Land beſides, yet he
was ſure God could preſerue
him, and bleſſe his
ſeede, when the the fields
of other men languiſht
with deſolation, and
waſte, and therefore hee
ſowed then in the time of

Famine, from whence we
we will learne this laſt inſtruction.
God alwaies
glorifies himſelfe in preſeruing
his Children by taking
aduantage of the moſt vnlikely
time that may bee to
preſerue them in. Let vs
now begin with the firſt.
            
            
               IIII. It is good huſbandrie to be
a Religious man, and one
of the Children of Abraham.
               FOr though the wicked
Mowles of the Common-wealth,
that are alwaies
rooting in the earth

after profit, ſuppoſe they
ſhould loſe much if they
were troubled in their
bargaines with the ſcrupulous
vice of Religion
(as they thinke it) yet by
their leaues, Godlineſſe is
great gaine, as the Apoſtle
tels vs, and is inſtated
in a double portion by
Gods owne promiſe both
of the things of this life,
and of the life to come.
Hee giueth meat to them
that feare him, and is euer
mindfull of his promiſe,
ſings Dauid, Pſal. 111. 5.
His are no Court-promiſes
prodigally made,
and purpoſely forgotten;
but ſo carefull is God after

an eſpeciall manner
to be out of debt to thoſe
that rely vpon his word,
that in the times of
dearth and famine, when
all other are lankt, and
ſhrunke vp with the leanneſſe
of the Earth; yet
then (as it is in the fifth
of Iob, the 20. and 22.)
God ſhall redeeme thee
from death, ſo as thou ſhalt
laugh at deſtruction and
famine. What though a
man begin with little, as
Iacob did, Yet if thou ſeeke
to God betimes, and make
thy ſupplication to the Almightie,
though thy beginning
be ſmall, yet thy latter
ende ſhall greatly increaſe,
                  
as one of Iobs falſe friends
truly prophecied at randome
of Gods purpoſe
toward Iobs eſtate. No
matter therefore how
wicked men are opinioned
of Godlineſſe, who
accompt it a very vnprofitable,
and moſt vnthriftie
vertue: the truth is, it
is farre otherwiſe.
               For Godlineſſe is not
only a gaine without
loſſe, but a great gaine
without the leaſt loſſe:
but wicked gaines are all
like Samſons Foxes, they
haue fire brands in their
tailes, that conſume all
their Maſters good huſbandrie:
For they gaine

a little part of the world,
and loſe that in the ende
which is more worth then
the whole world, and
ſuch gaines will profit
little. For as our Sauiour
ſaies, What will it profit
a man if hee gaine the
whole world, and loſe his
owne ſoule? So that indeed
a wicked man gaines
only for other, but gets
loſſe for himſelfe: for
whileſt he loſes himſelfe,
his heires enter vpon all
his gaines, and ſuch are
but ſilly gaines God
knowes, and I would
they knew ſo to: but the
gettings of a Religious
man brings no ſuch after-claps

of griefe and ſorrow
with them, as Salomon
tels vs in 10. of the
Prou. 22. The bleſſing of
the Lord, it maketh rich,
and hee addeth no ſorrow
with it: but how hurtfull,
and full of irremediable
ſorrow the goods
are of vnrighteous Mammon,
Saint Paul moſt excellently
deſcribes in the
1. Epiſtle to Tim. the 6. 9.
But they that will be rich
(ſaith the Apoſtle) fall into
temptation, and a ſnare,
and into many fooliſh and
hurtfull luſts, which drown
men in deſtruction, and perdition.
A man would haue
thought Temptations,

and Snares, and Folly,
and hurtfull Luſts, and
Deſtructions, and Perdition
had beene miſerie,
and ſorrow enough for a
Couetous heart, a heart
that will be rich, Quaſi nolente
Deo, to be drowned
in. But as Salomon ſaies,
God addes no ſorrowes to
the riches he giues, ſo Saint
Paul addes more to thoſe
the world giues. For the
lone of money (ſaies the
ſame Apoſtle in the ſame
place) is the root of all euill,
which while ſome coueted
after, they haue erred
from the Faith, and pierced
themſelues thorow and
thorow with many ſorrows.
               
               
                  
All theſe miſchiefes
happen not to rich men,
but to men that will bee
rich, not to men that
haue money, but to men
that loue money, and ſet
their heart vpon it. If
riches increaſe, ſet not thy
heart vpon it, ſaies Dauid.
A man may haue riches,
but riches muſt not haue
the man, as Ariſtippus
ſaid of Lais the Harlot,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , otherwiſe
they ſhould not be
Gods bleſſing, which
they are, Deut. 28. they
would not be rewards of
obedience, Pſal. 128. they
would neuer make vs
friends in Heauen, Luke

16. 9. we ſhould neuer ſee
poore Lazarus landed by
the Angels in the boſome
of rich Abraham, Luc. 16.
22. Our Sauiour would
neuer haue ſent out his
thunder of imboſſibilitie
againſt them, with this
lightning, How hard it is
for them that truſt in riches
to enter into the Kingdome
of God, wee ſhould haue
ſeene Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob,
Ioſeph, Iob, Dauid, Hezechiah,
the rich Arimathaean,
&amp;c. either leſſe
religious, or more poore.
               Looke then as good
ground to the Seedſman;
ſo the honeſt heart
when the ſeede of Gods

benefits are committed
to him, puts out all the
grace of God to the
greateſt aduantage of his
glorie that he can, and is
neither idle nor vnprofitable
in his fruit-ſeaſons.
For he knowes he muſt
giue account of euery idle
word, how much more of
many talents, or a whole
life miſpent in idleneſſe:
but Gods ſeede brings
forth in him either 30. or
60. or 100. fold, and
Gods talents are reſtored
for two, fiue; for fiue,
tenne. Neither can it be
otherwiſe; for he is Gods
owne huſbandrie, and
therefore to be a religious

man, and a childe of
Abraham, muſt needs be
good huſbandry, becauſe
it is Gods, who will alwaies
bleſſe his owne
grounds, and be ſure to
let his Sunne ſhine, and
raine fall vpon them, and
water them, except ſometime,
that they may be
more fruitfull after, hee
lets them for a while lye
fallow, and for a yeare or
ſo, as Dauid did, lye ſpar'd
and broken vp, without
any outward ſhew of
fruite at all.
               Now becauſe all men
are reaſonable, though
ſome be not religious, let
vs ſee whether there bee

not great reaſon for it;
that Religion ſhould bee
thought good huſbandry,
and ſhould enrich
the man, that is a faithfull
practiſer of it. I am perſwaded
there is none but
will confes, that he which
is the beſt diſpoſed to get
and to keepe; &amp; the leaſt
inclined to miſ-ſpend
goods well gotten, is
moſt likely to prooue a
rich man: the Poet ioyns
both the wayes of thriuing
in one verſe: Non minor eſt virtus, quā
quaerere, parta tueri.
               
               Now if we would know
what are the getting virtues,
they are agreed vpon

to be Labour and Diligence.
Salomons little
Ant will tell vs how
much is got by Labour,
if we go to her. Go to the
Ant thou Sluggard, conſider
her wayes, and be wiſe.
Prou. 6. 6. And Salomons
ſelfe will tell vs what is
the fruite of a diligent
hand. Prou. 10. 4. A diligent
hand maketh rich:
for as the Ant labours
much and wiſely, (ſo the
Poet moſt elegantly deſcribes
it. 
                     It nigeum campis agmen,
praedamque per herbas
                     Conuectat calle anguſto,
pars grandia trudunt,
                     Frumenta obnixè humeris,

pars agmina cogunt,
                     Caſtigantque. moras: Opere
omnis ſemita ferret.
                  
               
               So the diligent hand
loues to labour, and goes
willingly through all the
vp-hils of thrift, as Salomon
ſpeakes of his good
houſwife. Shee perceiueth
her merchandiſe is good,
therefore ſhee worketh willingly
with her hands: ſhee
is early vp at it. And is a
wicked man of this diſpoſition?
It may bee is laborious,
by reaſon of the neneceſſity
of his eſtate, and
the ſtrength of his body:
but is hee conſtant in his
labour, does hee loue it?
Nay, will he not preſently

breake out into ſome
exceſſe or other, and ſo
ſoone ſpend ill, what was
well gotten? O how hard
a thing is it to ſee a good
workman indeed, almoſt
in any calling not to haue
ſome one ſecret or known
vice, that like a wicked
vermine conſumes all his
labours? but an honeſt &amp;
religious hand as it ſets
it ſelfe to worke in obedience
to Gods cōmand,
and ſo gaines his bleſſing:
So is it both conſtant in
his labour, and prouident
to auoyde the miſpences
other men fall into. For
as hee is not drowſie in
getting his liuing: ſo is he

neither drunken nor greede
to ſpend it. He remē
                  bers
Salomons counſell in
the 23. of the Prouer. 20.
Be not among wine-bibbers
among riotous eaters of
fleſh; for the drunkard and
the glutton ſhall come to pouertie,
and drowſineſſe
ſhall cloath a man with
ragges. Does not our experience
teach vs (as the
French Prouerbes goes)
That more men dig their
graues with their teeth,
then are ſlaine with the
ſword: that is, with their
ouer greedy cramming
themſelues: but a religious
man is taught to ſatisfie
his body with moderate,

not to ſurfet his
body with exceſſiiue diet.
Do not we ſee many
a labouring man boyle
his whole body in ſweat
all the day long, onely to
quench the dropſie of his
throate at night with vnreaſonable
ſwilling in his
day labour turned into
drinke? but a religious
man as his hand are laborious,
ſo he hath a ſober
throate, drinking onely to
refreſh his body, not ſo,
till the drinke comes vp
where it went down: the
grape of neceſſity he freely
takes alwaies, and ſomtimes,
but ſeldome the ſecond
grape of delight,

but the third of exceſſe &amp;
luxry hee neuer touches
or taſtes of.
               Beſides, how many
great eſtates and rich patrimonies
may wee obſerue
by often reſorting
to the houſe of an harlot,
to haue gone downe into
the chambers of death,
as the wiſe man ſpeakes,
and neuer to haue ſeene
any reſurrection: but the
body of a religious man
is a member of Chriſt, &amp;
therfore cannot be made
the member of an harlot,
thereby to conſume both
himſelfe and his eſtate.
what ſhuld we be tedious
in reporting what we cā
                  not

not but know; That by
gaming, and pride in apparell,
and haunt of ill
cōpany, many a rich heire
leaues his ſonne a poore
child, as hee makes himſelfe
a poore man? All
which rocks of danger &amp;
ill huſhandry Religion
(the holy guide of our
liues) neuer ſuffers any
that ſaile in Noahs Arke,
I meane in Gods church
for want of a right ſteering
their veſſels to run
foule vpon. And therfore
it muſt needs be (Religion
being the mother of
frugalitie) good huſbandry
to be a religious man
both becauſe the bleſſing

of God is vpon him, as
we are taught by Scripture,
and becauſe he is
furniſht with the vertue
of honeſt getting, &amp; kept
by it from the vice of vnprofitable
ſpending.
               But perhaps a weake
Chriſtian will bee ready
to quarrel with this truth
&amp; to obiect, That althogh
Iſaac, it may be had ſome
thing left him of his father;
yet his father Abraham
himſelfe was but a
poore man, being ſtript
of all his friends, and the
hopes of his owne inheritance,
and called out by
God into a ſtrange countrey,
when he was now

ſeuenty yeares old: &amp; his
ſon Iacob no more worth
thē his poore ſtaffe. And
that Dauid was poore, &amp;
needy himſelfe, ſayes as
much in plaine termes, I
am poore &amp; needy, being
forſaken of father &amp; mother,
til God took him vp
&amp; forced, thogh after the
beſt ſort, to beg maintenance
of the rich churle
Nabal; and though God
himſelf ſay of Iob, that he
was an vpright man, and
there was none like him in
all the earth, yet is it not a
prouerbe as poore as Iob.
Beſides, Mathew and Zachaeus
&amp; Ioſeph of Arimathaea
were all before rich
men, but as ſoone as they

followed Chriſt, their riches
left thē, and they became
poore &amp; religious
men together; Again was
it not Dauids cōplaint in
the 73. Pſal. That the wicked
are not troubled like other
men, neither are they
plagued like others, but
their eyes ſtand out with
fatneſſe, &amp; they haue more
th
                        •
                     n heart can wiſh. And
the prophet Ier. as he ſucceeded
him in time, ſo he
followd him in his complaint.
Ier. 12. 1. Righteous
art thou, O Lord, when I
plead with thee, yet let me
talke with thee of thy iudgments.
Wherefore doth the
way of the wicked proſper:

wherefore are they happy
that deale very deceit fully?
That we may the better
know then.
            
            
               V. Why the godly are many
times poore, &amp; how the
wicked are often rich in
this world.
               WE muſt learne to
diſtinguiſh rightly
of the times when the
children of God are
poore, and of the perſons
of wicked men, how they
are rich. There is a time
of pouertie, and a time
of riches, and to ſay true,
except Gods children
were firſt poore, how
could Gods bleſſing enrich
them after? So Abraham
                  
and Dauid and Iacob
had their times of pouertie,
they were poore at
firſt, but their end was
rich, and full of Gods
bleſſing; where contrary,
the wicked man is neuer
rich in the concluſion.
So Dauid tells vs in the
37. and 73. Pſalmes, when
he went into the Sanctuarie
to ſee the end of theſe
men, hee ſaw the end of
the vpright to be peace.
Marke the vpright man,
for the end of that man is
peace, ſayes the Prophet:
but what ſayes he of the
wicked? The end of the
wicked ſhall be cut aff. So
was the end of Diues in

the 12. of Luke. Hee had
no ſooner ſung the merry
Carroll to his ſoule of
Soule eate, drinke, and bee
merry, &amp;c. he had no ſooner
ended his Antheme,
but the ſame night his
ſoule was begd from him
and hee could not get a
drop of drinke for it, hee
had prouided much for
his ſoule, but he had not
prouided his ſoule a whit
for God, &amp; the therefore
ſpirituall furies did 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
ſoone begd away
his ſoule from al the pleaſurns
hee had loaded his
new built Repoſitaries to
banquet it with, and in a
moment ingulft it into

perpetuall torment: for as
Iob ſpeakes of the wicked
Momento deſcendunt in
infernum; Pphyloſophy
teaches vs, that there can
bee no motion in an inſtant:
but ſin lies ſo heauy
vpon the ſoule of the
wicked, that it is no ſooner
out of his body, but
it is deſcended in a moment
to hell, and therefore
though it be ſayd of
Lazarus; and the Begger
died, and was carried by
the Angels into Abrahams
boſome, yet it is no ſooner
ſayd, The rich man died alſo,
but as if there had bin
no time betweene his dying,
and being in hell, it

ſtreight followes. And in
hell lift vp hiss eyes, &amp;c.
O how ſodainly (ſings the
Pſalmiſt) doe they conſume,
periſh, and come
to a fearefull end. Pſal. 73
18. The new tranſlation
turnes it, how as in a moment,
and indeed the originall

So Dauids greene
Bay-tree, Pſal. 3. 35. (a
tree that euer beares
leaues but neuer fruit, &amp;
therefore fit to ſhadow
vnder the lawes of it a
a fruitleſſe profeſſour)
though hee flooriſht it
for awhile, yet ſuddainly
Dauid did but turne him
about, and he could not

finde ſo much as the place
where he ſtood.
               But let vs graunt Diues
the happineſſe to die a
rich man, which he ſhall
neuer doe (for as the heathen
ſings of death, 
                     
                        I 
                              •

                            ſummis infirna.
                     
                     
                        Death and the Graue,
make euen all eſtates.
                        There, high, and low,
&amp; rich, &amp; poor are mates.
                     
                   Yet the riches they haue,
are not like Wiſedomes durable
riches, but God
blowes vpon them, not
only cutting off themſelues,
and their remembrance

as ſparkes from
the earth; but ſcattering
their eſtates, and blaſting
their ſeede and poſteritie:
ſo that he periſheth both
ſooner and oftner then other
men. He ſpends his
daies in wealth (Iob 21. 13.)
and in a moment deſcends
into hell; there how ſoon
is his ſoule loſt? His bodie
is as chaffe, that the ſtorme
carries awey (ver. 17. 18.)
there he loſeth his body
as ſoone. And what pleaſure
hath hee in his houſe
after him, when the number
of his moneths is cut off
in the middeſt, (ver. 21.)
there periſheth his eſtate.
And to conclude, God

laies vp the puniſhment of
his iniquitie for his children
(ver. 19.) there hee
dies in his poſteritie. So
that, although he flatter
himſelfe with an opinion
of his riches, that it will
keepe him aliue in his
name, and memorie, and
poſteritie, and houſes,
and lands, beyond the
condition of other men
(as Dauid tels vs, Pſal. 49.
11.) that this is his very
thought) yet to ſpeake
ſoothly, as the laſt of the
beſt, and the beſt of the
laſt, Poets ſaies of all
morall helpes which Fabricius,
and Cato, and Brutus,
three of the moſt famous

of the Romane
Worthies thought to
eternize themſelues by, 
                     Cume ſera vobis rapiet
hoc etiam dies,
                     Iam vos ſecunda mors manet:
                   So may the vngodly rich
more truly ſay of himſelfe,
and all worldly
meanes, whereby he hoped
to perpetrate his life,
and memorie.
                     The poor man dies but once:
but O that I
                     Already dead, haue yet
three deaths to die.
                   For, being dead in his
bodie, he ſtill remaines aliue
in his ſoule, eſtate,
and poſteritie to ſuffer

death, and therefore
death is ſaid to gnaw, and
feed vpon him, Pſal. 49. 14.
And it is worth the obſeruing
how ſoone his
name rots, which that it
might flie into eternitie
beyond the names of
poorer men, he ſo feathered
himſelfe with houſes,
and lands, and children,
and called them all by his
owne name. And therefore
our Sauiour in the
Storie of Lazarus, and
Diues, keepes the poore
mans name aliue to the
worldes end, but induſtriouſly
leaues the rich
mans name at vncertaintie,
with There was a certaine

rich man.
               
               This is the firſt and
maine difference of the
times, but there is another.
For there are ſome
times of perſecution, and
ſome of peace. When
we therefore ſay that a religious
man is a Thriuer,
we meane in the time of
peace, when God bleſes
the Land he liues in with
quiet, and lets the beames
of his Goſpell freely diſplay
themſelues: but in
the times of perſecution,
when clowds, and ſtorms
ariſe; when the Arke of
God is tempeſted about,
and failes as it were in the
bloud of his Children, it

is contrarie. For as before,
the poore religious
man growes rich, with
Abraham, and Iacob, and
Dauid, and Iſaac; ſo in
the times of bloudy perſecution,
the rich man,
that is truly religious,
voluntarily grows poore,
as Mathew, and Barnabas,
and Zachaeus did. But
their riches then left not
them for want of Gods
bleſſing, but they to get
a bleſſing of God, left
their riches to ſupply the
wants of others. There
is a time of Warre, and
a time of Peace, ſaith the
Preacher, Eccl. 3. a time
to get, and a time to caſt

away. Now it pleaſed
God Iſaac ſhould liue in
a time of peace, and ſo
ſhould haue a time to
get: but Mathew and
Zachaeus, &amp;c. were to
liue in a time, when the
whole world was at war
with God, and that was
a time to caſt away. And
as God gets himſelfe honour
in enriching his
Children in the times of
peace; ſo it is his good
pleaſure, that his Children
by being poore
ſometime for his ſake,
ſhould get themſelues
glory from him.
               I but will a poore
Chriſtian ſay. Now are

peaceable times: and yet
there are ſtill many rich
wicked men, and more
godly that are poore. So
queſtionleſſe, there are
many rich godly men,
and more poore that are
wicked. But to ſatisfie
this doubt alſo. I told
you there is a ſecond diſtinction
to be vſed of the
perſons of rich, &amp; poore
men. It may be thou art
godly and poore. Tis
well: but canſt thou tell
whether, if thou wert not
poore, thou wouldſt be
godly? Sure God knows
vs better then wee our
ſelues doe, and therefore
can best fit the eſtate to

the perſon. Why ſhouldeſt
thou thinke much to
ſee Lazarus by Diues his
gates; God knowes that
was the way he was to aſcend
to heauen by, and it
may be hee had neuer
been comforted in Abrahams
boſome, if God had
not brought him thither
by affection, and by Diues
his gate.
               Reſt therefore thy ſelfe
content with that eſtate
God hath ſet thee in, that
is beſt for thee, if thou
beeſt a childe of God,
and it is not Gods order
to giue thee his bleſſings
to hurt thee with.
               If I ſhould ſee my

childe diſſolutely affected
to gaming, ſhould
I giue him a patrimonie
to dice away, or thinke it
a kindneſſe in me to nouriſh
a vice in him? If I
had an vngratious brother,
whoſe heart I ſhould
perceiue ſo leagued with
ſome harlot, that hee
would loſe his honeſtie,
and ſpend his eſtate vpon
her; ſhould I not rather
keep him honeſtly poore,
then ſend him to periſh
with my benefit, and
make my purſe his bane?
What if he ſhould wearie
me with intreatie, and
for the time thinke vnnaturally
of me, as fooliſh

children that haue kniues
denied them, will cry; and
a man in a burning feauer,
thinke much when
he is denied cold drinke?
Might hee not thinke
more hardly of me after,
when he comes to iudge
rightly, If I ſhould haue
helpt him then to haue
deſtroied himſelfe? Exorari
in perniciem rogantium
ſaeua bonitas eſt. It is
vnkinde mercie to be intreated
of any man to his
vndoing. And although
this benefit of God be
ſomething more obſcure
to the by-cauſe, thou ſeeſt
not thine owne future
wickedneſſe, yet it is no

whit the leſſe benefit in it
ſelfe, except thou thinkeſt
it a leſſe benefit for a man
ſleeping to be ſaued from
a wilde Beaſt, that would
deuoure him in the
darke, then it is to be ſo
reſcued in the day, and
when he now ſees it, and
is awake. Certainly God
ſees ſomething more then
thou doſt, either for thy
glorie, or his owne, or for
the example of others,
why he denies thee riches,
which if thou ſhouldeſt
enioy, thou mightſt haue
cauſe after to complaine
of his goodneſſe. For
what a Heathen man in
the like caſe ſaies of himſelfe,

and his Friend, may
be more truely ſaid of
God, and his children.
Non committam vt poſſit
quandoque dicere, Ille amando
me occidit. I will
neuer giue him cauſe to
ſay one day of me, Hee
killed me with kindneſſe.
               
               But yet though I be
poore, wilt thou ſay, why
ſhould a wicked man be
rich? why it may be (for
ought wee know) God
may make him a good
man before his death; as
he did Mathew and Zachaeus,
the two rich Publicans,
and great ſinners;
And wilt thou childe with
Gods Prouidence for giuing

him his temporall
bleſſings, vpon whom he
meanes to beſtow his eternall:
but if not: wee
know not whether by riot,
or miſpence he may
become poore before he
die, and ſo God will puniſh
his ſinnes with the
loſſe of his goods.
               But ſay he be not a rich
man only, but a couetous
man, and liues thriuingly
all his life, and dies in
as great plenty as the
moſt religious thriuer,
why ſhould God ſuffer
him to be rich by raking
to himſelfe other mens
goods? Why doeſt not
thou yet, being a Chriſtian

knowne that a couetous
man, is the pooreſt
man aliue. For muſt not
he needs be poore, whom
God himſelfe doth not
ſatisfie? doe not enuie
him, he puniſhes himſelfe
with his riches ſufficiently,
in thinking himſelfe
to be ſtill and ſtill in
want. Yes, but wee,
thou wilt ſay that iudge
rightly of him by his eſtate,
thinke him all a
rich man. I, but thou
doeſt him the more
wrong. For that which
God makes his iuſt puniſhment,
his riches, thou
thinkeſt to be his happineſſe,
and Gods bleſſing

vpon him. Heare not
therefore what we or the
world talke of him, but
what the Wiſeman, and
the Wiſdome of God
himſelfe, ſpeakes Eccleſ.
6. 1. for our iudgement is
many times out of weakneſſe,
and the Worlds alwaies
out of opinion, but
God iudges euer out of
truth, and that when all
mens ſhall faile, and heauen
and earth muſt paſſe
away, ſhall, and muſt
ſtand for euer. There is
an euill which I haue ſeene
vnder the Sunne, and it is
common among men. A
man to whom God hath giuen
riches, wealth, and honour,

ſo that he wanteth nothing
for his ſoule of all that
he deſireth, yet God giueth
him not power to eat thereof
but a ſtranger eateth it.
Does not God now moſt
grieuoſly puniſh this
man with riches? were
it not a lamentable ſight,
and almoſt a cruell part
of a Prince, if he ſhould
make a couetous rich Miſer
ſpread a large Table
for others, and ſhould
there make him ſit at it,
till he were pined to
death himſelfe? This is
the very ſtate of euery
couetous ſoule.
               But indeed to ſay true.
A couetous man that rauines

and ſnatches at other
mens goods, is no
more properly in Gods
ſight a rich man, then we
would call him that had
ſtollen a great ſumme of
mony from another man,
rich. We ſhall doe him
no wrong if we call him
a rich theefe. For yee
know wee neuer reckon
the goods of theeues
their owne goods, becauſe
as ſoone as they are
taken notice of, their
goods are all ſeiz'd vpon
to the Kings vſe: And ſo
many times as ſoone as
God ſends out his pale
Purſiuant to attach this
couetous wretch, the

goods preſently are diſpoſed
of all God will
haue them: ſome times
it may be to his honeſt
heire, or perhaps to the
deſtruction of ſuch as inherit
with his ſinne his
ſubſtance, as the rich Epuloes
Brothers: but many
times to the building
of Hoſpitals, or the erecting
of Grammar
Schooles, or putting out
of Prentiſes, or redeeming
of Priſoners, or
founding of Colledges,
or releeuing of maimed
Soldiers, or making of
good waies, ſuch as himſelfe
neuer walkt in (or
which now is a rare point

of pietie) in doing ſome
good to the Church of
God, by reſtoring to the
right vſe, vſurped and impropriate
tithes, or buying
them from the dead
hands they lie in, and laying
them vpon Gods Altar,
that feedes not vnder
the Goſpel any mortmaines,
ſuch as were the
hands of the Romane
Clergie; but ſuch as are
more free, and actiue in
the ſeruice of the Prince,
&amp; Common-wealth, then
any in the whole bodie
politique of double their
abilitie, and ſtrength.
And truly the want of
doing good in this one

kinde is the very bluſh of
our profeſſion, moſt rich
men neuer dreaming vpon
their death-beds of
any ſuch ſtreine of pietie,
as being long dead in
their mindes to the
Church, before their
dead bodies come to reſt
in it: Or releaſing of captiues,
or helping poore
Miniſters, or maintaining
in the Vniuerſitie poore
Schollers, or ſetting vp
in their honeſt Trade new
beginners, or ſome other
ſuch good and pious vſes;
and ſo they come all in
concluſion to Gods Exchequer.
               Leaue then to ſlaunder

the diuine Prouidence
of God in the diſpenſation
of theſe moueables
(as wee truely call
them) by ſuppoſing them
bleſſings to the wicked,
when in their needy ſuperfluity,
they wāt what they
haue, or when the religious
man is made better
by their want, by thinking
their want to him
any puniſhment at all.
Be not enuious with Dauid,
to ſee the vngodly
man proſper a while: but
if Diues haue a ſhort and
ſmall portion in this life,
as Abraham tels him: let
him haue it; Alas! he
hath no other▪ Only wait

thou vpon the Lord, and
verily thou ſhalt haue enough.
               Hauing now endeuored
to heale the lame
hands of ſuch as are
ſhrunke vp and withered
with idleneſſe and ſloath,
as our Sauiour himſelfe
whē he came into the Synagogue
on the Sabbath
day, and found there one
with a withered arme, begun
his Sabbath daies
worke with making him
ſtretch it out like the other:
becauſe it is an ill
ſight to ſee one in the
Church of God and in
his Vineyard ſtand idle,
either in doing nothing

or doing naught: Let vs
go on to the following
obſeruation which is.
            
            
               VI. That as God will haue his
children (though neuer
ſo religious and rich,)
vſe the meanes as well
as others to obtaine his
bleſſing; ſo that huſbandry
hath alwayes beene
an ancient and honourable
meanes of life.
               I Know it is an vſuall
quarrell with ſuch perſons
whoſe ignorance &amp;

prophaneneſſe are quarrell,
to fal out with Gods
Iuſtice, becauſe it hath
not made them ſo rich as
other men, and becauſe
they ſuppoſe al their happineſſe
both in this life,
and in the other is already
ſo prediſpoſed of by
God, that there is nothing
left for them to do,
either for enriching thē
                  ſelues
here with the great
mē of the world; or hereafter
for gloryfying thē
                  ſelues
with the felicity of
Gods Saints in heauen.
If God pleaſe to enrich
them, hee can do it they
ſay without their labour,
as hee did Iob in the euening

of his daye: And if
hee haue ordained them
to pouertie, all their labour
they ſay can neuer
enrich them, though they
riſe early, and goe to bed
late, and eate the bread
of carefulneſſe. For except
God build the houſe, the labour
of the workeman is
but in vaine. Pſal. 127.
               Againe, if they ſhall be
ſaued, let them liue how
they will, they know
God will ſaue them, but
if he meanes not to haue
them, all the meanes they
can vſe, they thinke but
idle, and ſo they lie down
in the ſecret decree of
God which being imbreſted

in Gods owne
boſome thoughts, they
cannot poſſibly diue into;
and neuer looke to
the execution of Gods
decree, which they may
finde in the vſe of the
meanes &amp; in themſelues,
if by them the meanes be
wiſely applyed, and faithfully
practiſed.
               This argument was
very ancient, and firſt inuented
by heathen men,
who thought all things
ruled by a fatall and ſtoicall
neceſſitie, which was
wholly vnalterable, and
neuer to bee changed by
any contrary endeuours,
or by liuing neuer ſo religiouſly

&amp; well. Which
reaſon the wiſer ſort of
men did ordinarily ſtile

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   the idle reaſon.
And thus as when they
are idle they would haue
God do them good, ſo
when they are euill they
would haue God beare
thē harmeleſſe by making
himſelfe ſome cauſe him
ſome cauſe of their ſinne.
               Thus the Grecian harlot
caſt her adultery vpon
Venus and Iupiter in
Euripides, but was well
ſchooled for it preſently
by Hecuba, in theſe words

                     —
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         &amp;c.
                  Neuer honour your adultery

ſo much, as to
make the Gods the ſimple
fathers of it: no, no;
my ſonne Paris was the
onely Iupiter, and your
owne inflamed mind the
Venus that brought you
to this ſhame, and vs to
this miſety. Neither did
ſimple women onely, but
the wiſeſt of the heathen
Gouernours loade their
Gods with their proper
crimes:
                     —
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ,
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                   Sayes great Agamemnon,
alas! 
                     It was not he that did them
iniurie.

                     
                        But Ioue and Fate, and the
night Furie.
                  
               
               But Iupiters anſwer is
recorded by the ſame
Poet:
                     
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                        
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           ,
                     
                     
                        Men ſay their faults are
ours when their own wils
                        Beyond their fate, are authours
of their ills.
                     
                   But how God in the cō
                  production
of an action,
that is euill; for the euill
in it does no way caſually
concurre, or by way of
efficiency: but onely by
way of directing, ordering,
&amp; limiting the prauitie

of it: ſo that the
moſt wicked is beholding
to God (whom hee
fooliſhly indicts as guiltie,
for limiting his ſinne,
and ſo leſſening his puniſhment
is a diſcourſe
ſomthing ſtragling from
our purpoſe, who are to
enquire the meanes how
to obtaine his benefits by
our labour, and not the
manner how hee workes
in vs, when wee vſe his
benefits againſt himſelfe,
and by his goodneſſe
make our ſelues the more
euill.
               Let vs know then that
the wiſedome of GOD
doth not bring in the end

without the appointed
meanes, he hath fore-determined.
If the Decree
of God haue meaſured
thee out a faire portion
in this life, he hath ſet out
meanes whereby thou
ſhalt attaine this inheritance,
eyther by thy kinred,
and ſo he bleſt Iſaac;
or by thy labour, and ſo
he bleſt Iacob; or by thy
ſeruice and the fauour of
great perſons, and ſo hee
bleſt Ioſeph; or by thy
learning and his bleſſing
of thy ſtudies, and ſo hee
honoured Daniel. God
ordinarily neuer breakes
off the end from the
meanes, and therefore if

thou thinke GOD will
bring about the ende,
though thou neuer vſe
the meanes to attaine it,
thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe.
For God, as in his goodneſſe
he ordaines the end,
ſo in his wiſedome he appoints
the meanes to
bring the end to paſſe.
Reaſon not therefore ſo
ſimply as to ſay; Whom
God will enrich, though
hee be neuer ſo careleſſe,
wealth ſhall be caſt vpon
him; for that is a moſt inconſequent
ſpeech, and
ſauours too much of the
idle Prouerbe, Giue a man
lucke and caſt him into the
Sea: but if thou wouldeſt

reaſō rightly, ſay; Whom
God will enrich, hee will
make him carefull to vſe
the meanes, whereby hee
may be enriched. For,
although ſometime the
means may be vſed without
atchieuing the end,
God, it may be, for the
puniſhment of the wicked,
or the triall of his
children, making the
meanes in-effectuall: yet
the end cannot bee attained
without the appointed
meanes, it being a
certaine Rule both in Nature
and Religion. Deus
&amp; Natura non faciunt
ſaltum. God and Nature
make no Leapes: they

leape not from the beginning
to the end, but
by middle, and ſo ſo paſſe
to the end.
               
                  We may euidepce this
truth by diuers Scriptures.
See it firſt in our
heauenly inheritance▪
                  
Rom. 8. 29. Whom he did
fore-know, hee alſo did predeſtinate;
and whom hee
did predeſtinate, them alſo
he called; and whom hee
called, them he alſo iuſtified;
and whom he iuſtified, them
he alſo glorified. And
Rom. 10. the 14. How then
ſhall they call vpon him,
ſaies the Apoſtle, on whom
they haue not beleeued, and
how ſhall they beleeue in

him of whom they haue not
heard? and how ſhall they
heare without a Preacher?
and how ſhall they preach
except they be ſent? So
then before thou canſt
be purpled in glory by
the bloud royall of our
deere Lord, thou muſt
goe through all theſe
meanes, correquiſit for
thy ſaluation.
               
               Indeed Gods loue is
the beginning, and thy
glory is the laſt end, the
loue of God will bring
thee to: but there be many
meanes betweene the
beginning and the ende,
his loue and thy glory.
Firſt, Gods loue elects

thee to be iuſtified, and
to worke thy iuſtification
he cals thee, and that
thou maieſt be called, he
infuſes into thy heart
faith in Chriſt, and that
thou mightſt beleeue, he
cauſes thee to heare the
word, that thou mightſt
heare, his Prophets muſt
preach it to thee, before
they can preach, they
muſt be ſent: So that in
briefe, The Miniſter is
ſent to preach, he preaches
that thou maiſt
heare, thou heareſt, that
thou mightſt be called,
thou art called to beleeue
in Chriſt, thou beleeueſt
that thou maieſt

be iuſtified, being iuſtified,
thou art ſure of thy
Crowne of Glorie, and
this glory the loue of
God by all theſe meanes
ſets as it were vppon thy
head. Betweene therfore
our glory which is the
end, &amp; Gods loue which
is the beginning and
cauſe of it, many interiacent
meanes, you ſee, are
caſt betweene.
               And ſhall God himſelfe,
that he may beſtow
vpon vs the exceeding riches
of his glory, goe
through ſo many meanes
with vs, and ſhall wee
thinke to grow rich hereby
doing nothing, without

any meanes at all?
Nay certainely, as Chriſt
would haue the treaſures
of heauen, which he purchaſed
for vs, coſt himſelfe
ſo much labor; being
excruciated with ſo many
dolorous agonies, and
ſuch a bloudy ſweat as to
any other Creature in
Heauen or Earth had
beene impoſſible to haue
waded thorough: ſo he
would haue vs purchaſe
our temporal riches with
our perſonall labour.
               No man is ſo ſimple as
to thinke he ſhall make a
good voyage, and haue
his veſſell returne well
fraughted, if he neuer ſet

out at all any ſhip to Sea:
no man lookes for a harueſt
that ſowes no ſeede:
none that keepes not a
flocke, or plants not a
Vine, to grow rich by his
vintage, or to encreaſe by
his Lambe and Wooll.
What is the Reaſon? Is it
not becauſe he knows the
meanes that brings about
the end, and if one be awanting,
the other cannot
without folly be expected.
Why then ſhold
we not be as wiſe in all
things, as we are in ſome?
or why ſhould our folly
looke for Gods benefits,
without the meanes vſed,
when Gods wiſdom hath

appointed vs only the vſe
of the meanes to obtaine
his benefits by? If there-therefore
thou neyther
aſke Gods bleſſing by
prayer, nor art laborious
and diligent to make way
for it by thy induſtry, nor
waiteſt vpon his prouidence,
and vſeſt thy owne
to obtaine it, nor doſt by
Faith receiue them as the
goods of God, nor canſt
retaine by ſobriety and
temperance what thou
haſt receyued; neuer look
that Gods bleſſing as
long as thou ſleepeſt away
the ſeed-time of thy
youth in ſluggiſh and vngodly
idleneſſe, ſhould

bring thee forth a harueſt
of his benefits in thine
age: but expect, becauſe
thou doſt not know that
it is Hee that giueth thee
Corne and Wine, and
Oyle, and multiplies thy
Siluer and Gold; but
with the groſſe-hearted
Iſraelites offereſt ſacrifice
to thy Yearne, or committeſt
adultery with thy
ground, and ſo thinkeſt
the fruit of her Wombe
the cauſe of thy wealth,
or kiſſest thine own hand,
or applaudeſt thine owne
wiſedome, as the Wiſe
Stewards, or rather ſole
Lords of all the goods,
that God will return and

take away thy corne in the
time thereof, and thy wine
in the ſeaſon thereof, and
will recouer his Wooll, and
his Flaxe giuen to couer thy
nakedneſſe, as hee ſaid hee
would doe, and did to the
vngratefull Iſraelites, Hoſ.
2. 8. 9. So for thy future
eſtate, which I mention
onely by way of digreſſion,
know aſſuredly,
            
            
               
               VII. God neuer beſtowes vpon
any the reſt of glory, that
takes no paines to make
it ſure to himſelfe by the
meanes of Grace.
               NEuer let any vſe that
idle ſophiſtry againſt
his owne ſoule, as to ſay;
I know what God hath
appointed ſhall be done.
If he will ſaue me, he will
giue mee grace to vſe the
meanes: if not, all my labour
is but in vaine. For
all be this Reaſon for the
ſubſtance of it, in it ſelfe,
be true, yet in regard of

him it is both idle &amp; prepoſterous.
It is idle, becauſe
the very diſſolute
manner of ſuch as thus
reaſon, prooues them altogether
vnholy and prophane;
ſuch as wold faine
put God to all the labour
of ſauing them, whether
they would or no, without
any conſequent labor
of their own. And if God
will not take ſo much
paines with them, as in
ſpight of their owne idle
diſpoſitions, to work out
all their ſaluation, himſelfe,
then it ſecretly accuſes
him as a cauſe of
their periſhing, when indeed
it is their idleneſſe,

which will not vndergoe
the labour of liuing well,
that makes them vnfit, &amp;
in-diſpoſed to receiue
grace, and their owne
wicked and ill life, which
is the cauſe of their eternal
puniſhment &amp; death.
               It becommeth not vs
therefore to looke firſt to
Gods ſecret will (like the
ouer-curious inhabitants
of Bethſhemeſh, whoſe irreuerent
boldneſſe God
puniſhed with the ſlaughter
of 50070. men, 1 Sam.
6. 19.) and ſo to our puniſhment.
For both theſe
are yet hidden from our
eyes; and then to Gods
grace, which is the means

of our ſaluation, and our
own vitious and impenitent
courſes which are the
meanes of our periſhing.
For this is prepoſterous;
&amp; by the wicked figure of

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   confoūds the ſight
of our vnderſtanding: but
if wee would deale wiſely
with our ſoules, wee muſt
looke to ſee that which is
ſecret, by that which is
reuealed, and that which
is hid, by that which is
manifeſt: Now the Grace
of God, if it be in vs, reueales
&amp; manifeſts it ſelfe. 
                     —Quis enim celauerat ignem
                     Lumine qui ſēper prodigitur ipſe ſuo!
                   And our owne deſperate
and impenitent life is

known to our ſelues and
others ſufficiently. If the
Sunne be riſen, wee ſhall
finde him ſooner by his
beames vpon the tops of
the Mountaines, then in
the Orient of Heauen it
ſelfe; and ſo the Loue of
God is ſooner diſcouered
to riſe in thy heart by
the beames of Grace it
there ſhows abroad, then
by the flame of it ſelf that
ſhines in his owne breaſt
in Heauen. If then Grace
imbrighten thy heart,
thou maiſt from Grace
aſſure thy ſelfe of Gods
loue, and thine own glorie:
but if thou findeſt in
thy ſelfe an impenitent &amp;

incorrigible heart, thou
mayſt then iuſtly worke
vpon thy ſelfe a ſence of
thy miſery: I dare not ſay
thou art ſure of GODS
wrath, but I muſt ſay, except
thou repent, &amp; God
change thy heart, thou
art yet in a fearefull and
loſt eſtate; ſay not therefore
thus. God hath caſt
me out from his fauour,
therefore my heart is obdurate,
impenitent, incorrigible.
For this is to
argue from that thou
knoweſt not; whether
God fauours thee or no:
but thus rather. My heart
is obdurate, impenitent,
incorrigible, therefore if

I ſo continue, God will
ſurely caſt mee out from
his fauour and preſence.
And this thou maiſt ſecurely
doe, becauſe thine
owne conſcience is both
a witneſſe and a iudge of
thy life, whether it be impenitent
or not: Again,
neuer argue thus; God
will ſaue mee, therefore I
ſhall bee ſure to vſe the
meanes; for that is to diſpute,
ab ignoto: For who
knowes the will of God?
but thus rather I will bee
ſure to vſe the meanes,
therefore I am ſure God
will ſaue mee, and this is
to diſpute 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   frō
things knowne. For who

knowes not whether hee
vſe the meanes God hath
appointed him in his
word to worke out his
ſaluation by? which that
thou maiſt be ſure of, hee
hath giuen thee his promiſe,
his word, his oath,
(Heb. 6. 17. 18.) his writings
by his Secretaries
the Prophets, which are
the conueyances of thy
heauenly inheritance; he
hath ſigned thē with two
indeleble ſeales imprinted
into thy fleſh by baptiſme,
and into his owne
by his Paſſion and death,
the appointed infallible
witneſſes to teſtifie his
deed. His ſpirit &amp; thine

owne, thy faith and thy
loue (Rom. 8. 16. 1 Iohn.
3. 14. and 1 Iohn 5. 10.)
ſo that although thou
beeſt now on earth, yet
when thou haſt thy euidence
for heauen ſo ſurelie
made ouer to thee,
thou canſt not but bee
moſt ſecure and ſure of
thy right and title, if thou
haſt once receiued them,
and ſtill keepeſt them in
thine heart, being regenerate
and borne anew.
Vſe therefore the meanes
GOD hath appointed
thee, and then attend aſſuredly
his promiſed bleſſing.
For all ſuch promiſes
of GOD haue ſome

condition or other alwaies
eyther implied, or
expreſt. If thou labour,
God will proſper thee, if
thou vſe the right means
God appoints, he wil enrich
thee; onely the difference
betweene the conditions
of ſpirituall and
temporal bleſſings is, that
he hath giuen many wicked
men▪ power in themſelues
to performe the
condition required for
theſe vnder-benefits, but
the conditions of glory,
which are the graces of
Repentance; Faith and
Loue hee reſerues in his
owne power, to beſtow
vpon whom only it pleaſeth

him: being not the
Steward of other mens
goods, as Man is, but the
Lord of his owne. Sowe
therefore the ſeeds of Labour,
and of Grace in thy
Youth, and looke for a
harueſt in thine age of
ſufficiency and glory.
               But to returne to the
labour which Iſaac imployed
his time in, which
was Sowing the ground,
wee may from thence
learne, that
            
            
               
               VIII. Huſbandry hath beene an
ancient and honourable
meanes of life.
               LET not good huſbandry
ſowing the
ground, and paſturage
of cattell bee counted an
abiect and reprochfull
courſe of life, which hath
alwaies beene ſo ancient
and honorable a meanes
to keep life in the world.
It is true indeed, Man in
the nobilitie of his birth
was not borne at firſt to
this ſeruiceable attendance

vpon the earth: for
both the heathen people
had this tradition among
them as the Poet ſings:
—nec non vllis
Saucia vomeribus per ſe dabat
omnia tellus:
And the word of God
tels vs as much in the firſt
of Geneſis, that the earth
of it ſelfe brought forth
euery ſeed after her kind,
without the labour and
induſtrie of man, and till
for our ſinne it was accurſed
by God ſtill continued
to bee ſelfe-fertill
and to feed her children
without their labour.

Mans ſpeciall vocation
then being the ſtudy of
the creatures, wherein he
might behold, as in ſo
many ſmall mirrours, the
wiſdome and power, and
glory, and goodneſſe of
God, which kinde of diuine
meditations Dauids
Pſalmes are euery where
ſweetly tuning to his
Harp, as in the 104. &amp; 19
Pſalmes &amp;c. We were all
borne in our innocence
ſtudents of diuinitie.
That was the firſt vocation
of our humane nature,
but the next was
huſbandry. For ſo the
firſt borne child of the
nature, the ſtrength, and

heire of the world, that
was a Ruler ouer his brethren
(as God himſelfe
calls him. Gen. 4. 7.) was a
manner of the earth, and
his brother Abel a ſhepheard
to feed his flocks.
               Neither did the world
many thouſand yeares after
ſhake off this honourable
ſimplicitie of life.
If wee looke into the 13.
and 8. of Geneſis, wee ſhall
there finde Abraham a
great heardſman, to liue
after that faſhion of life,
although his houſe were
more like a Court then a
Family, hauing 318. trained
ſeruants, all men of
armes to attend him,

                  (Gen. 14. 14.) and being
in the eſtimation of thoſe
among whom he dwelt a
great Lord, and mighty
Prince, Geneſ. 23. 6. Not
long after, Iob (an Iſmaelit
as ſome of the Ancient
thinke, but as others with
more ground of Scripture.
1. Chro. 1. Gen. 25. one
of his ſeede by Keturah)
ſucceeded him both in
the manner of his life, &amp;
in the dignity of his eſtate:
nor was it a miracle
to ſee rich mens daughters
(vnacquainted with
new tires, and moſt faſhionable
dreſſes) buſie thē
                  ſelues
in laborious (and
not curious needle) work

but it was ordinary in
that old world to meete
young and beautifull Rahel
tending her fathers
ſheepe, and watering the
flocke, and Rebecca with
a pitcher vpon her ſhoulder,
drawing water both
for her owne vſe, and to
water the Camels of Abrahams
ſeruant, an office
that our nice virgins, who
dreſſe vp themſelues like
ſo many gay ſilke-worms
would thinke ſcorne of:
and in the ſecond of Exodus,
the 16. and 17. verſes,
we ſhall finde in the field
ſeuen daughters of the
Prince of Midian filling
the troughs to water

their fathers flockes,
whereof Zippora, Moſes
wife was one. It was the
anſwer of the Patriarckes
to Pharaoh (Gen. the 47.
Thy ſeruants are ſhepheards
both wee, and all our
fathers. Where we may
ſee that Pharaoh himſelfe
had his heards and flocks
of cattell to feed abroade
in his own crowne lands,
and royall inheritance.
And among the Princes
of Iſrael was not Gedeon
taken from the threſhing
floore Iudg. 6. 11. Moſes
&amp; Dauid from the Ewes
great with young to feed
Iſrael Gods people, and
Iacob his inheritance (Exodus

3. &amp; 1. Sam. 16. 11.)
may wee not meete Saul
after hee was annoynted
king ouer Iſrael following
his Oxen. 1. Sam. 11. 5
and therefore the ancient
phraſe of the world, for
kings was the ſhepheards
of people; ſo Homer vſually
ſtiles Agamemnon,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and nothing is
more frequent in the ſtories
of elder times, then
to ſee the greateſt Princes
of the world taken
with Cincinnattus and C.
Fabricius and Curius Dentatus
as they were following
the plow to bee
the Conſuls and Dictators
of Rome, which was

then the Queene of Nations,
and the Lady of
the world. And this not
ſo much the neceſſitie of
their eſtates droue them,
as the honeſty, delight,
and naturall ſweetnes of
theſe countrey and fieldlabours
woed them vnto.
And therefore old Cato,
after hee had out of his
cenſorious grauity well
rated, and ſcolded withall
other pleaſures, as the
laſciuious Miſtreſſe of
lewd youth, and the onely
harlots of the whole
world, cannot in concluſion
diſſemble his loue
to this ſame countrey Galatea
(as Virgil cals this

field-life) but as ſoone as
he begins to ſpeake of it,
Redeamus in gratiam cum
voluptate, ſayes the rough
Cenſour of the world,
Let vs bee friends againe
with pleaſure; as confeſſing
it to be, not ſo much
a clowniſh labour, as the
moſt naturall, and therefore
lawfull delight allowed
a wiſe man. And
therefore in the youthful
flouriſh of Rome we ſhal
finde it obſerued by Columella,
that their faires
which the Romans call
Nundinae (quaſi nono die
habitae) were kept once
onely in nine dayes, becauſe
they would not

leaue their country houſes
to be drawne into the
idle troubles of the cittie
more then needes muſt,
and if they were by exigence
called to the Senate
houſe for their aduiſe,
they had publike officers,
whom they called
Viatores, their countrey
poſts attending ſuch occaſions:
and when they
gaue any man extraordinary
commendation, ita
laudabant (ſayes the firſt
Latine writer de re ruſtica)
Bonum agricolam, bonum

generall Trade (ſome

the Romane Law was,
ſayes the ſame Cato, Furem
dupli condemnari, foeneratorem
quadrupli, and
with good reaſon is this
Art of getting by our
mony, not by our labour
inueighed againſt of all
ſuch as commend huſbandry,
as moſt vnnaturall
huſbandry, and contrary
to the life they write
of being, as M. Varro
ſpeakes of it, moſt hated
of thoſe, who are beholding
to it: but for the certainty
of gaine, and the
pietie of the getter, and
the ſafety and health of
him that vſes it, and the
apting the bodies of men

military ſeruices in the
defence of the common-wealth
thoſe haue euerbin
accounted moſt happie,
ſayes the ſame Authour,
Qui in eo ſtudio, occupati
ſunt. By all which it ſufficiently
appeares that
huſbandry hath bin both
an ancient and honourable
meanes of life, before
pride and the faſhion began
to bee vertues of ſo
ſpeciall requeſt in the
world, as they are now
thought: and that all bee
in the glory of Nature
before ſinne had hlemiſht
the world, we were by
creation all diuines and
Prieſts of God, not to offer

bloudy ſacrifices, but
of praiſe and obedience,
(which ſhould make vs
thinke honorably of that
calling, which we were al
born to, except we would
caſt dirt in the face of our
innocent nature) yet preſently
after the ſoyle of
our ſin had ſtrucke barennes
into the womb of our
mother, &amp; her breſts were
dried vp that ſuckled vs,
huſbandry ſucceeded to
bee the next vocation.
The firſt call was of the
minde: the ſecond of the
body: the firſt of heauen,
the ſecōd of the earth: the
firſt to the glory of God;
the ſecond for the neceſſitie

of man: and yet I
thinke both of them may
make the ſame complaint
for themſelues, which Iunius,
Moderatus Columela,
does for them, Sola res ruſtica
quae ſine dubitatione,
proxima, &amp; quaſi cōſanguinea
ſapientia eſt, tam diſcentibus
egeat quam ma giſtris.
Onely the Art of
huſbandry, which doubtleſſe
is next and neareſt
a kinne to wiſedome,
wants both ſchollers
and teachers, meeting
very ſeldome with ſuch
religious votaries towards
them as the Prince
of the Latin Poets was,
who in his Georgicks, or

poeticall Huſbandrie,
breaks out into this godly
wiſh.

               Thus were the opinions
of the old world, but
it is a world to ſee now
the prodigious change of
Nature, when not onelie
moſt men count Huſbandrie
a baſe and ſordid buſineſſe,
vnfit to ſoyle their
hands with: but ſome,
who thinkes his breaſt
tempered of ſiner clay
then ours of the vulgar

ſort, call ſuch as haue
ſpent their times in the
ſtudies of Diuinity, no
better then rixoſum diſputatorum
genus quorum
vix in coquendis oleribus
conſilium admittit. It is
the ſpeech of one Bartaeus,
a Germane diſclaimer,
who was better borne thē
taught, &amp; more eloquent
then learned, againſt the
Diuines of his Countrie,
too buſily wrangling as
he thought, about the Paradoxes
of Arminius, who
I feare will change, if not
his falſe opinion of the
cauſe, yet his prophane
cenſure of the men, niſi
ipſe forte inter olera ſit,

quae in inferno ſint conquenda.
Before our bodies
were only inſtruments to
ſerue our ſoules, and wee
delighted our ſelues in
the ſtudy of heauenly &amp;
diuine knowledge; now
our ſoules drudges onely
vpon the bodies ſeruice,
runnes onely vpon the
fleſhes errands, neyther is
any thing more weariſom
to it ſelfe, or more out of
credit in the world, then a
ſoule walking &amp; climbing
vp the holy mountaines,
from whence commeth
our ſaluation, til it be out
of breath after the knowledge
of heauenly things:
before our labour for the

body was ſoone diſpatched,
when wee all went
naked, and the ground
ſeeded it ſelfe, &amp; brought
forth a voluntary harueſt
to feede vs: but now all
our labour is for food &amp;
cloathing (as the wiſe mā
tells vs in his Prouerbes)
our nakedneſſe was then
our glory, it is now our
ſhame: it was a curſe to
till the earth then, it is
now a bleſſing to haue
earth to till: ſo that wee
haue learnt to turne by
the corruption of our nature,
our apparell that
ſhould couer our ſhame,
to proclaime our pride:
&amp; our Lands that ſhould

feede vs by our labour, to
the food of our luxurie:
In a word, Religion was
once the Lord of our
Reaſon, and our Reaſon
the directer of our vnderſtāding,
and our vnderſtāding
the guider of our
will, and our wills the
cōmanders of our affections,
and the affections
(which the Philoſopher
calls materiall reaſons, becauſe
by them the ſoule
rules our body) the gouernours
of our bodies,
and our bodies the controllers
of our deſires and
luſts: but now Luſt hath
ſnatched the reynes into
his owne blinde gouernment,

and madde with
Iehu, driues on the body,
and the body the affections,
and they the wil, and
that the vnderſtanding to
all vnreaſonable and irreligious
exceſſes: ſo that
poore Reaſon carried
headlong to the ruine of
it ſelfe, ſits like a Waggoner,
or rather like vnhappy
Hupolitus without
his reynes, and is hurried
by his wilde horſes whither
ſoeuer they pleaſe:

                     —&amp; fruſtra retinacula tendens

                     Fertur equis auriga, nee audit currus habenas.
                  
               
               
                  
And from this diſorder
of mans nature comes it
to paſſe, that in the yearely
fruits of the earth
which wicked men reape,
all the paines of Nature
ſerue them only to maintain
the pleaſures of their
luſt, who are alwaies eyther
miſdoing, or doing
naught. Let vs leaue
therefore the Commendation
of Huſbandry,
and end with▪
               
            
            
               
               IX. A iuſt reprehenſion of ill
huſbands, who eyther
ſtraggle out of their own
Callings, or haue vnlawfull,
vnprofitable, or
no Callings at all.
               IF therefore thou wouldeſt
call downe Gods
rich bleſſing vpon thy eſtate,
reſt thy ſelfe in that
vocation God hath ſet
thee (as a Souldiour
maintaines the ſtation
his Generall places him
in) and breakes not ouer
the hedges, either to idle
courſes or other folkes

buſineſſe. When God
meant to enrich Iacob, he
made him vigilant and
laborious: when he meant
to honor Daniel, he made
him ſtudious and wiſe:
when hee purpoſed to
crowne Dauid, hee ſowed
in his Youth the ſeeds of
Religion, and Valour.
God hath alwaies ſet the
right meanes before the
end: doe not thou therefore
grudge and repine
againſt God, and ſet vp
ſayles to carry thee to
ſome other coaſt then
GOD hath appointed.
Delight not thy ſelfe in
planetary motions, but
moue conſtantly in thine

ſphere. It is indeede the
nature of al men to think
other mens liues more
happy then their owne, 
                     
                        Optat ephippia Bos piger, optat ar ace Caballus.
                     
                     
                        Faine would the Oxe the horſes trappins weare;
                        And faine the Horſe the Oxes yoake would beare.
                     
                   The Countrey man admires
the brauery of the
Court, and the Courtier
the content of the Countrie.
But take heede of
this leuity of minde, goe
thou alwaies on in the
knowne roade God hath

ſet thee, otherwiſe though
thou ſtriue neuer ſo much
and (with the two lowing
Heyfers that carried the
Arke, 1. Sam. 6.) goeſt on
complaining vnchearfully
in the way of thy calling,
if thou beareſt Gods
Couenant with thee,
God will carry thee thither,
and thou ſhalt endure
much miſery by the
way.
               
                  Ionas, wee know was
ſent by God to Niniue, but
he, becauſe he knew God
was mercifull, and feared
more his owne ſhame in
being counted a falſe
Prophet, then fauoured
Gods honour in ſparing

the Niniuites, when hee
ſhould haue gone to Niniue,
ſet vp his ſayles for
Tarſhiſh, thinking moſt
fooliſhly to flie him that
was euery where; but
God had ſoone ſent his
winds after him, to driue
him thither, whither hee
denied to goe, and when
they were not ſtrong enough,
but hee choſe rather
to loſe his life, then
to be thought, though
for Gods honour, a falſe
Prophet, &amp; would needs
be caſt into the Sea from
his obedience to God,
GOD had prouided a
ſtrong purſuiuant to waft
him thither with incredible

ſpeed, &amp; to land him,
whether he would or no,
vpon the ſhoares hee fled
frō. The Prophet thought
he had beene in the belly
of hell, as hee ſpeaketh of
himſelfe in the 2. and 2.
of his Prophecie, when
he lay ſtewing in the ſtomacke
of the Fiſh, and
ſayling vnder water to
the coaſt God had ſent
him. Follow therefore
thou the vocation God
hath ſet thee in.
               Onely take heed that
it be a lawfull, profitable,
and honeſt Calling. For
ſome there are, like the
ſmoothe-tongued Paraſite
in the Comedie, that

get their liuing by flattering
and lying lips, that
traffique with their tungs
for their belly in ſpending
their whole liues to
finde out merry tales and
beyond-Sea newes to
feede his eares that feeds
them; and theſe with their
Attique dialects doe ſo
fleeke and ſmooth him vp
they liue vpon, that they
make the rich foole halfe
beſides himſelfe with an
opinion of his ſingular
goodneſſe, and rare vertue;
and ſo continue to
blanch his fowle life ſpent
in riot and gaming, and
prodigious luxury, till
they haue made him as

poore in his eſtate at
length, as before hee was
proud in his expence, and
ſuch harlotrie the young
prodigall in the Goſpell
met with; but ſuch callings
are neither lawfull
for him that liues by thē,
nor profitable for him
that is fed vpon, nor honeſt
before God or men.
And therefore theſe voces
ad placitum, that were all
borne in the Familie of
Gnatho muſt take heede
leſt their merry laughing
and lying trade of flatterie,
though it were alwaies
quaeſtus multo vberimus,
ſince the begining
of the world, when

Pride firſt infected our
ſoules to theſe later times
wherein it is prophecied,
that men ſhould be more
then ordinary louers of
thmſelues, and proud, &amp;
boaſters, be not onely in
concluſion puniſht with
Seuerus his ſmoake, that
ſtifled a Flatterer to death
with this deriſory motto,
Fumo perijt, qui fumos vē
                     didit,
but with Gods fire
to, which will reward it
with the ſame fire it was
kindled with, Iames 3. 6.
Others ſpend their liues
in Callings ciuilly lawfull,
but ſuch as are neyther
profitable for the
Common-wealth, nor

before God iuſt and honeſt.
Such was the Trade
of Demetrius the Siluer-Smith,
in the 19. of the
Acts that made ſiluer
ſhrines for the worſhip
of the goddeſſe Diana,
that is, Little temples of
ſiluer, in which the image
of Diana ſate, as it did in
the great Temple: and
ſuch are all thoſe curious
&amp; puppet-dreſſing trades
that ſerue for nothing
elſe but young Ladies, &amp;
Gallants to dreſſe and
pride themſelues vp in
the ſuperfluous vanity of
ouer-rich and faſhionable
apparell, fit indeede
for the corruption of the

time, but vnfit for vncorrupted
perſons; contrary
to the Apoſtolicall Canon,
1. Tim. 2. 9. and the
will of God, Zephany 1. 8.
And among the crowde
of this ranke, wee may
thruſt in our idle Pamphleters,
&amp; looſe Poets,
no better then the Prieſts
of Venus, with the rabble
of Stage-players and Balleters,
and circumferaneous
Fidlers and Brokers:
all which, if they were
cleane taken out of the
world, there would bee
little miſſe of them.
               Others beſtow their
time in Legall, and Callings
vſefull to the Common-wealth,

but as they
abuſe them, neyther honeſt,
nor iuſtifiable before
God. Such are our Tap-houſes,
&amp; Gaming Innes,
I meane not harbouring
and viatory Innes, which
queſtionleſſ, in fit places,
and where Iuſtice is neere
at hand, if rightly vſed,
are not onely lawfull and
profitable, but neceſſarie
and honeſt: for to lodge
weary Trauellers, as Rahab
did the Spies of Iſrael,
or to let the poore labouring
man to haue iuſt
allowance of bread and
drinke for his money can
bee accounted no other
then neceſſary reliefe:

but for our Tipling Innes
in ſmall &amp; vntract Hamlets,
without which our
Country-Diuels of drunkeneſſe,
Blaſphemy, Gaming,
Lying, and Queaning,
could amongſt vs
finde no harbor (though
perhaps in places of more
reſort they haue credit enough
to be entertained
in fairer lodgings) they
are eyther the Diuels vncleane
Ware-houſes for
his ſpirituall wickedneſſes
to trade in; or in our
plaine world hee hath no
traffique at all.
               The laſt ſort of offendors
againſt the vertue of
honeſt Labour, are our

Out-of-Calling Gentlemen,
who in huſbanding
their Lands, and ouerſeeing
their ſeruants, and
gouerning their families,
and in relieuing, aduiſing
and quieting their neighbours,
&amp; in giuing good
and religious examples
themſelues, may finde
imployment enough for
Gods many talents, hee
hath truſted them with.
But they, neuer thinking
why they came into the
world, when they ſhould
warme their bodies with
wholeſome labour, take
thought onely how they
ſhall boyle them in vncleane
luſts: when they

ſhould waſh them with
the ſweat of ſome honeſt
Calling, they with vnwaſh'd
and durty affections,
ſwiniſhly wallow
themſelues in vnchaſte &amp;
intemperate vices; making
their Lands, giuen
them to ſet them a-work,
the maintainers of their
idleneſſe; &amp; their bodies,
as Seneca ſpeaks of them,
Cribra tantum Ciboru
                        •
                      &amp;
po
                        •
                     uum: S
                     ••
                  es onely to
ſtraine meates &amp; drinkes
thorough, and their ſeruants,
for want of skill,
to command them, Lords
to diſpoſe all their Lands
as they pleaſe themſelues.
Such the Romane Common-wealth

was full of,
in the declining periods
of it, as all the ſtories tell
vs: ſuch the pride of Iſrael
nouriſhed iuſt before
the captiuity of the tenne
Tribes; Amos the 6. the
4. 5. &amp; 6. verſes; ſuch the
kingdome of Iudah vnhappily
ſwarmed with,
immediately before Hieruſalem
was ſet downe
weeping by the waters of
Babylon, Ierem. 5. the 7. 8.
Such alwaies the body of
euery Common-wealth
(like ill-humours) is ſurcharged
with (for the Diuine
patience commonly
waites for his ſize, till ſin
hath fil'd vp her meaſure)

before hee giueth it a
purge, either by water,
as when hee baptized the
whole world from their
laſciuious running after
ſtrange fleſh, or by fire,
as when hee ſent hell out
of heauen againſt Sodom
and Gomorrha: or before
hee lets out the inflamed
bloud to quench the malignant
heat of it, as wee
ſee in the Tribe of Beniamin,
Iudg. 20. and after in
both the Lands of Iſrael
and Iudah, in the forementioned
Prophets.
               A rugged fellow and
vnmannerly would our
Gallants, I dare ſay, think
him, that with the angry

                  Romane writing in commendation
of theſe country
labours, ſhould chide
them as he does, to their
worke, and vpbraiding
their luxurious paines to
wait vpon ſinne, after the
vomit of much indignation,
tell them, that they
would when they had
ſuckt out all health and
vitall ſappe from their
languiſh'd bodies, bring
themſelues to that paſſe,
vt in ijs nihil, mors mutatura
videatur: That they
had need to be embalm'd
as well before, as after
their deaths: or ſhould
with the Taſke-maſters
of Pharaoh ſay to them

as they did to ſtragling
Iſrael, coaſting about to
gather ſtraw and ſtubble
for their Egyptian works:
Ye are idle, idle are ye, goe
now therefore and worke,
Exod. 5. 17. Indeed they
would thinke hee knew
good faſhion, and ciuill
carriage, that would aduiſe
them to trauell with
the Prodigall into ſome
farre Countrey, there to
ſpend riotouſly all their
goods vpon Harlots,
Luk. 15. 13. or if he would
counſaile them to liue in
the City, and frequent
Maſkes and Tauernes, &amp;
Theaters; or if he encouraged
them to the ſports

of hawking and hunting,
and if the weather were
churliſh and lowring, to
carding and dicing; or
if he would wiſh them to
follow the Court in the
delights and reuells of it,
not in the honourable
ſeruice and ſtudies of one
that meanes to fit himſelfe
for worthy imployments
and actions, whether
in Warre or Peace.
But thou (O mā of God)
flie theſe things, &amp; in thy
Chriſtian Calling follow
after righteouſneſſe and
holineſſe, in thy particular
vocation exerciſe thy
ſelf in ſuch things as may
be not only lawfull in the

Common-wealth, wherein
thou liueſt, but profitable
both to thy ſelfe &amp;
others, and eſpecially in
the ſight of God, and his
Church, iuſt and honeſt;
ſo that thou maiſt (as it
becommeth a Noble
Chriſtian) both reproue
with thy cōtrary practiſe
the rich and honourable
laſineſs which ſuch Lords
of Idleneſſe (that keepe
their Chriſtmaſſe all the
yeere) count the priuiledge
of their gentilitie,
and delight thy ſelfe with
Iſaac to ſowe the ſeeds of
thine owne labour, for
the obtaining of Gods
bleſſings. And the God

of Peace, if thou water
the ground with thine
owne ſweat, ſhall bleſſe
thy labours heere a hundred
fold, and hereafter
ſhal end thy labours
in Reſt
Eternall.
               Amen.
            
         
         
            
            
               
                  ACTS 10. 43. To him giue all the
Prophets witnes.
            
            
               I. The wiſeſt of the heathen,
and all creatures are
good witneſſes.
               WHen the heauens
and the earth are
ſo farre diſtant a ſunder,
who would euer ſuppoſe
al things on earth ſhould
draw to themſelues a vitall
efficacy, and heauenly

fertilitie from thoſe (as
the Scripture cals them)
kind influences, ſo farre
ſent, except the whole
world were campus dicendi,
a large field, wherein
euery plant with ſo many
ſweet flowers of naturall
eloquence leſſoned our
reaſon by ſence, and experience
to beleeue it;
vpon the departure of
whoſe Summer beames,
all the fruite againe, and
comly flowiſhes of earthly
profit, and pleaſure, in
re-interring themſelues
eftſoones faint, and die away.
But this Annual reſurrection
of Nature we,
therfore ſee in this world

which wee ſhould neuer
otherwiſe haue beleeued,
that wee might beleeue
that which in this world
we ſhall neuer ſee: that
God is to receiue vs,
what heauen is to earth.
For thogh he ſay of himſelfe,
Eſay, 55. the 9. As
the heauens are higher then
the earth, ſo are my thoghts
higher then your thoughts.
Yet it pleaſes him to deſcend
from that height,
in the 57. and 13. of the
ſame Propheſie. Thus
ſaith the High and loftie
One that inhabits eternitie.
I dwell in the high and holy
Place, with him alſo that is
of a contrite and humble

                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
ſpirit, to reuiue the ſpirit of
the cōtrite ones. Earth hath
no power to mooue vpwards,
it is beyond the
ſphere of her actiuitie:
Heauen therefore virtually
deſcends: man hath
no power ſo much as to
ſend a good thought vp
to God: God therefore
bowes the heauens, and
comes downe in two ſpeciall
beames, one of his
goodneſſe which ſhines
euery where in his works,
and is therefore called by
the Apoſtle, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                  That which may be known
of God; the other of his
Truth, which is moſt eradiant
in his word, and is

therefore called by our
Sauiour the light of the
world.
               
               Now ſo diffuſiue is
God of his goodneſſe,
and gratiouſly as it were
prodigall of his image,
although in it ſelfe it can
be ſeene in no place, yet
he would haue no place,
where it ſhould not bee
ſeene in his works, which
are all weake ſhadowes
of ſome bright excellency,
that is ſubſtantially
reſplendent in himſelfe.
For as the noone-Sunne,
which then makes all
things moſt eaſily ſeene,
can then leaſt of all bee
ſeene it ſelfe; and yet

lights vp innumerable
ſtars in the night ſeaſon;
wherein, as in ſo many
little ſparkles of it ſelfe,
it is viſibly, though abſent,
preſented to vs: ſo
our vnderſtanding in this
midnight of things, may
ſee the ſpirituall Sunne
of our ſoules ſhedding
ſome ſmall ſtarrelight of
himſelfe in euery one of
his litle images his works,
whoſe vnapprocheable
light in it ſelfe whoſoeuer
ſhould hope to attaine
vnto, ſhould certenly
neuer attaine vnto his
hope.
               Thus in his workes the
wiſeſt of the heathen beheld,

and admired, the
goodneſſe, and glory, &amp;
power of God. The Heauens
declare the glory of
God, ſayes Dauid, Coelum
homini praebet ſpectaculum
ſayes Tully. The earth is
ſatisfied with the fruite of
thy workes, ſayes Dauid.
Terra foeta frugibus eidem
fundit nutrimentum
ſayes Tully. Thou haſt ſet
all things vnder his feete,
all ſheepe and oxen, yea
and the beaſts of the field
ſayes Dauid: Beſtiae ipſae hominum
cauſa ſunt generatae
ſayes Tully. He opened
the windowes of heauen,
and raind downe Manna
the flowre of heauen, and

bread of Angels, and feathered
fowles, like the
ſand of the Sea, ſayes Dauid,
ſo that well might
the Oratour conclude.
Neque neceſſitatibus tantummodo
noſtris prouiſum
eſt, vſque in delicias amamur.
               
               It were ambitious but
to name the ſpeeches of
heathen Plato, Xenophon,
Plutarch, and the reſt in
this Argument, whoſe
mouthes taſting, their
tongues could not but
bee ſinging of this ranke
and commendable luxurie
of Nature, which
God with his open hand
hath powred out euerie

where in his workes.
Wherein Iuſtin Martyr,
and diuers of the fathers
within the firſt foure centuries
haue ſo throughly
ſweated their ſtudious
thoughts, and as it is ſaid
of Caeſar, ſtirred vp a deſire
in all, but taken away
all hope of commendation
from any that ſhold
write after them: I will
onely adde to theirs the
religious ſong of Epictetus,
whoſe lampe-ſhell,
whereby hee ſtudied was
ſold after his death (ſuch
eſtimation was there of
the woorth not of the
thing, but of the man) for
aboue 100. Seſt
                     •
                  rties,

who after hee had began
many a ſentence with

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , great
is the Lord, and greatly
to be prayſed; he ſhuts vp
his ſong in theſe words.
If I were a Nightingall
(ſayes he) I would ſing to
the honour of my Maker as
a Nightingall does; and
how is that? Siquis adeſt
auditor (ſayes Pliny) Luſciniae
prius animus, quam
cantus deficiet. The Nightingall,
if any will giue
him the hearing, will ſing
himſelfe ſooner out of
breath, then out of tunes;
But now I am reaſonable
man, I will ſing prayſes to
God with vnderſtanding,

neuer ceaſe to praiſe him,
and I would to God (ſayes
hee) all men would doe
as I.
               
               But theſe Sermons
which the Creatures
preach out of the great
booke of Gods workes,
though they haue wide
mouthes, and lowd voyces,
and Stentorian like
will be hard through the
whole Hoſt of heauen;
yet they can but ſhew vs
the out-ſide of Gods
Temple, and bring vs to
the Porch dore; here they
meet with their Hercules
pillars, the great veile of
heauen, through which
our Sauiour is entred into

the Holy of Holies,
keepes them out. They
bring God to vs, but
they cannot bring vs to
God, they tell vs the true
God is to be worſhipped
but how to worſhip him
truly they cannot tell.
Beſides this naturall diuinitie
taught by the creature,
if it bee ſeioygnd
from the word had, as S.
Paul tels vs it hath a certaine
windy and puffing
nature in it, to ſwell &amp;
bladder vp the ſoule of
the wiſeſt heathen, with a
kinde of Satanical pride,
and ſelfe-worthineſſe. As
knowing therby al things
to be made for them, and

themſelues only for God;
and ſo thinking themſelues
as it were vulgus
deorum, ſemi-gods in
compariſon both of their
Creatures, I and other
men. But we (right dearely
beloued in our Lord
and Sauiour) muſt haue a
feeling as wel of our own
miſery, as a knowledge
of the Maieſty of God,
ioyning our wants to his
aboundance, and to his
goodneſſe our euill. Not
like the Heathen of all,
whom we may ſay as Eunapius
did of Oribaſius,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
They were Larks indeed,
and with 
                     
                        •
                     pictetus, ſung

ſweetly to Heauen: but
they were creſted Larks,
and thought too highly
of themſelues: beleeuing
God to be, but not knowing
what, confeſſing hee
ſhould bee worſhipped,
but not knowing how.
And therefore the Lady
of all their Sciences Athens,
when ſhee built
God an Altar, ſacrificed
all her offerings vpon it
onely 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to the vnknowne
God. But what
ſaies our Sauiour to this
woman of Samaria, that
neuer came vp to Hieruſalem
to learne how to
worſhip. Ye worſhip yee
know not what, wee know

what wee worſhip. And
though, Bias when a Prophane
Ruffian aſked him
what was Religion, held
his peace; and being
quarrelled with by him
to know the cauſe, anſwered
out of his angry wit,
Becauſe hee asked about a
matter hee had nothing to
doe with: yet let vs aſſure
our ſelues, that Religion
ſo neerely touches vs all,
that wee muſt not onely
know what wee worſhip,
as our Sauiour ſayes, but
as his Apoſtle tells vs, be
able and ready to giue a
reaſon of our faith, why
we thus worſhip GOD:
which that wee may doe,

there is correquiſite to
the loud voyce of Gods
workes, the ſoft voyce of
Gods word.
               For as wee can no way
know the minde of another
man, except it firſt
open it ſelfe, becauſe it is
manifeſt, as Solons Prouerbe
goes, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
wordes
are the onely pictures of
thoughts: ſo much leſſe
can any man aſcend vp
to the minde of God, except
hee climbe to it by
his word, which it therefore
ſtandeth with Gods
honour to reueale; becauſe
he is no leſſe gracious
then iuſt, and his Iuſtice

exacting of vs the
duety of Worſhip, his
Grace will not but giue
vs a poſſibility to know
how to performe our duties.
And thus farre the
whole world of vnderſtanding
men haue gone,
the very Heathen themſelues.
But in this queſtion
lies all the ſweat of religious
quarrells.
            
            
               
               II. How wee ſhould infallibly
finde out the true Word
of God, which may leade
vs to the knowledge of
him, our ſelues, and our
ſupreame happineſſe.
               HEere the way breaks
into foure paths in
the ſearch of this perfect
witneſſe of God, his Word
and Truth. In the firſt and
broadest walkes, the heathen
Idolator. For diuide
the World into thirty
parts, and he takes vp (as
is obſeru'd by a iudicious
Mathematician) ninteen

of them: but we muſt vnderſtand
his Obſeruation
of the continued magnitude
of the ſurface of the
earth, not of the diſcreet
multitude of men contained
in it. In the next
wide field of error walks
the Mahumetan, who diſpreads
himſelfe into ſixe
parts of the thirty. In the
third, the ſtragling Iew
wanders, who is diſcoaſted
into the bounds of
all the reſt. And the Chriſtian
impaths himſelfe in
the laſt, and leaſt, and narroweſt
tract, holding but
the proportion of fiue
parts in the thirty parts.
               The Heathen anciently

miſtooke the Oracles
of the Diuell himſelfe for
the word of God, and in
a manner is blinded in
that errour to this very
day, eyther by the illuſiſion
of Sathan himſelfe,
or the colluſion of his
Prieſts. The Mahumetan
embraces the Alcoron
for the vndoubted word
of God, and eſteemeth
that of Diuine and oracular
authority. The Iews
retaine ſtill the ancient
word of God, but they al
reiect the New, and are
therefore called by the
Fathers Archiua Chriſtianorum,
The olde Records
of the Chriſtians being

differenced among themſelues
into three Sects;
the firſt whereof are called
Charraim, and allow
all, and onely the olde
Teſtament. The ſecond
ſew to the Bible all their
fabulous Talmud, &amp; make
that of Scripture-authoritie,
and are therfore called
the Talmudiſts. The
third defalke as much
from Gods word, as the
ſecond crowded to it, &amp;
leaue only the Pentateuch,
or fiue bookes of Moſes
for ſelfe-credible, named
by the reſt Samaritans.
               
               Neither can the little
flocke of Chriſt, the Catholique
Church, now

profeſſant in the world,
goe peaceably in their
narrow path together, but
with Abrahams and Lots
Heardſmen, or Iacobs bretheren,
they will wrangling
and ſcolding as they
goe: being diſſundred
into thirteene ſmall, or
fiue maine different ſects.
Proteſtants, Latins, Gracians,
Neſtorians, Iacobites:
whereof moſt of them
darken that word of God
that ſhould enlighten
themſelues, by carrying
the Sunne in a clowd, &amp;
reading the Scripture in
an vnknowne tongue, eyther
of Latine, Greeke or
Syriacke, and ſo traducing

all the authority of Gods
Word from it ſelf to the
golden and empty Title,
of The Church. As the Latins,
Neſtorians, Indians,
Iacobites, the Cophti, and
the Mannites. Some of
theſe again ſpanging out
of the Canon of the New
Teſtament, all the Reuelation
of S. Iohn, the Epiſtle
of S. Iude, the ſecond Epiſtle
of S. Peter, the ſecond
and third Epiſtles
of S. Iohn: others farſing
into the Canonicall writings,
Apocriphall and
vnknowne Authors, the
Goſpell of Nicodemus,
&amp;c. with a world of rotten
and vnwriten Traditions.

To omit the populous
Churches at this
day of the Neſtorians and
Iacobites, who commit
the like error concerning
the Liuing word, as they
doe about the written;
the firſt diuiding Chriſt
into two Perſons by a ſeparation;
the ſecond cō
                  founding
him into one
Nature by the Adunation
of his Humanity, and
diuinity.
               Now all theſe ſelfe-arrogating
to themſelues
the word of God, either
by oracular Reuelation,
as the Heathen or written
Tradition, as the Mahumetan,
Iew, and Chriſtian,

how in ſuch a world
of open Warre, and ciuil
mutiny about GODS
Word, ſhould blinde
ſoules (ſuch as wee all
come into the World
with) be euer able to center
themſelues immoueably
in the Diuine Truth
of God, and not be carried
about with ſome one
winde or other of theſe
erronious doctrines?
               Giue mee leaue with
the mighty Angell, that
held open in his hand the
little booke of Prophecies,
Reuel. 10. to ſweare
by him that liueth for euer,
and euer. Either the
means how to effect this is

here ſet downe. To him
giue all the Prophets witneſſe,
or there is none in
the earth, or vnder heauen.
For as in it ſelfe the
leaſt tittle of Gods word
is more firmely pillard,
and leſſe paſſable, then
the whole fabrique of
heauen and earth. Heauen
and earth ſhall paſſe, &amp;c.
So to vs this certaintie
can no way bee more infallibly
euident, then by
the Propheſies, that are
ſtoried in it. And as the
Propheſies are the greateſt
argument of all the
reſt: ſo this is the greateſt
of all the reſt of the Propheſies
to argue by. For

here both Gods words
are met together. The
dead word hath met
with the liuing, the old
Teſtament kiſſes the
New, &amp; either to other,
one by fore-telling, the
other by fulfilling giue
mutuall witneſſe of their
irrepugnable Truthes.
Since therefore there is
ſo great vnitie in the
words, and the Prophets
are all ioyned in one witneſſe,
&amp; Chriſt to whom
they witneſſe is vndiuided,
I induſtriouſly ſpare
to make any diuiſion either
of the words, or among
the Prophets. Only
I will ſet this one truth

in the Light. That Chriſt
is the Center to whom all of
them ſtanding round about
him as a compaſſing clowd
of witneſſes, draw all the
lines of their Prophecies, &amp;
then briefly gather ſuch
Inſtructions as ſhall bee
thence deducible.
               Wee might ſee this
golden circle of all the
Prophets geaphically deſcribed
by the laſt of the
Prophets himſelfe, Reuel.
4. and 5. chapters, where
in the midſt of 4. Beaſts,
and 24. Elders, a glorious
Lambe ſtandeth, and
ſends forth the 7. Spirits
of God into al the Earth.
That Chriſt is the Lamb

himſelfe the Paſſeouer of
the Iewes wil tell vs. And
that the foure Euangeliſts
are the foure beaſts,
their euen number; and
their ſtanding neereſt the
Throne; as waiting immediately
on the Lambe
of God our Sauior, and
the ſtrict keeping of decorum,
in figuring them like
beaſts, ſuch as the Lamb
himſelfe is, ſufficiently
proues. And doubtleſſe
the 24. Elders can be no
other then the 24. Prophets
of the Olde Teſtament,
both becauſe they
are called Elders; being
more ancient then the
foure Euangeliſts, and

ſtand in a greater diſtāce,
&amp; farther off frō Chriſt,
their number being iuſt
the very ſame as S. Hierome
obſerues: And becauſe
as themſelues ſing
to their golden Harpes,
the Lambe had made
them Kings in matters of
Life, &amp; Prieſts in Points
of Doctrine to rule the
Earth, hauing before redeem'd
thē to God by his
bloud, which is not appliable
to the ſtedfaſt Angels,
but onely to ſuch
who had beene yong ſinners,
before they became
ſaintly Elders. And to
conclude, the ſeuen ſpirits
ſent forth into all the

Earth, muſt needs be the
ſeuen gifts of Gods Spirit,
preciſely ſet down by
S. Paul, 1. Cor. 12. 28. Apoſtles,
Prophets, Teachers,
Miracles, Guifts of healings,
Helps in gouernment,
Diuerſities of tongues,
which are therefore named
by Saint Iohn in the
very ſame place ſeauen
Lamps, and the ſeauen
hornes and eyes of the
Lambe; becauſe by them
Chriſt giues Light to his
Church, and exerciſeth a
viſible power in all the
Earth.
               And heere wee ſee all
our Sauiours witneſſes
are met together. The

twenty fower Prophets
hold out the firſt Lights
to diſcouer the Lamb of
God, &amp; leaſt they ſhould
be obſcure, the Euangeliſts
ſets the truth of the
ſtory by the wordes of
their Prophecie; and that
Chriſts Church may ſee
this truth, Chriſt ſends
out into the whole earth,
theſe ſeauen guifts of his
Spirit, as Lamps to giue
Light both to his Prophets
and Apoſtles: So
that if any Spirit of Antichriſt
obtrude vpon the
Catholique Church any
other witneſſes, or blinde
Light of gouernment,
&amp; interpretation beſides

theſe, or think that Chriſt
ſent his ſeuen ſpirits forth
into Rome, &amp; not forth
into the whole earth, it is
to be held a Spirit of Error,
and not of Truth.
But to cloſe vp this generall
ſhadow of the Prophets,
(which I haue vnawares
vnfolded beyond
my firſt purpoſe) and to
open the particular ſubſtance
of their ſeuerall
Prophecies, we ſhall find
thē all ſo ſignally point at
our Sauiour, that if Moſes
veyle were not taken frō
his face, and layd vppon
their hearts, if they did
not by a wicked 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   of
the olde Prophecies ſet

the laſt comming of our
Sauiour in glory before his
firſt in humility, that ſo
they might grow proud
by him, who would firſt
learne them to be humble,
Learne of me for I am
humble, they could not
but now at length ſee him
to be the Glory of Iſrael,
who hath beene ſo long
a time already the Light
of the Gentiles, all the
Circumſtances of his
Birth; the Miracles, Offices,
Doctrine, and Humilitie
of his life; the cauſes,
manner, and other
cōcurrences of his death;
the Place of his buriall,
and the aſſurance of his

riſing againe, being ſo
cleerely praeaſſigned by
their owne former Prophets,
liuing ſo long before.
Let vs therefore diligently
ſearch into
            
            
               III. The ſeuerall Prophecies
concerning the Birth,
Life, Death, and Reſurrection
of the Sauiour
of the world.
               FIrſt, that his Mother
ſhould be a Virgin,
was foretold, Iſay 7. 14.
and we ſhal finde it Mat.
1. 18. fulfilled. Beholde, a

Virgin ſhal conceiue, which
the Iews moſt ſillily tranſlate
a young woman, as
Trypho the Iew in his diſputatiō
with Iuſtin Martyr,
and Aquila and Theodotion,
both Iewiſh Proſelites
in their Tranſlations.
But as Iuſtin replies,
it were no wonder for a
young woman to conceiue,
whereas the Prophet
ſpeaks of it as a wonder.
Behold, the Lord himſelfe
will giue you a ſigne,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as
your ancient Septuagint,
ſaith the Father, reads it,
and not as your idle Rabbies
newly tranſlate it,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Behold, a

young woman ſhall conceiue,
making that a very
ſtrange wonder, then
which nothing is more
common and vſuall. Beſides,
to ſpeake in grammer
property, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  Alma
ſignifieth neyther a Virgin
ſimply, nor yet a
young woman, but one
betweene both, a Virgin
already eſpouſed, but not
married, ſuch as Mary
was to Ioſeph, ſuch as Rebecca
was to Iſaac, when
ſhe veyled her face at his
ſight, Gen. 24. 65. and is
therefore deriued from

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   to veyl or hide. This
being the maiden ceremony
of the olde world,

for Virgins after they had
once made choice of
their huſband, to couer
their faces, &amp; to be Nuptae,
before they were Maritae,
veyled from al other
before they married their
owne man. The husbands
being to become the
veyle of her eyes, as Abimelech
ſpeaketh of Abraham
to Sarah, Behold he is
the veyle of thine eies. And
this was Gods owne Argument,
to prooue our
Sauiour his Son the Meſſias,
Gen. 3. 15. Ier. 31. 22.
and in the place now cited.
               And as the perſon of
his Mother, ſo the perſon

of his Meſſenger was as
diſertly fore-told by the
Prophets, Eſay 40. 3. Malach
the 3. &amp; 4. chapters,
and fulfilled by Iohn the
Baptiſt, Luke the 4. who is
therefore called Eliah, not
becauſe he was to be perſon
aeliter, but onely perſonate,
being to come in the
ſpirit of Eliah, and in the
manner of his life. Eliah
faſted often, ſo did Iohn;
Eliah was girt with a leather
girdle, ſo was Iohn;
Eliah ſpake all his Propheſie,
writ none, ſo did
Iohn; Eliah reproued the
people openly to their
faces, ſo did Iohn; Eliah
was ſent to renew the

worſhip of God, then defaced
and changed, ſo
was Iohn; Eliah told Ahab
and Ieſabell of their faults
plainely, ſo did Iohn Herod
and Herodias; painted
Ieſabel ſought Eliahs life
to ſlay him: dancing Herodias
ſought and obtained
the life of Iohn, and
ſlew him. So that in his
place and apparell, in his
manners and Prophecies,
in the proſecution of his
life, and perſecution at
his death, Iohn, though
he were not Eliahs perſō,
yet did throughly perſonate
Eliah. And this was
Iohns crying Argument,
to proue our Sauiour the

                  Meſsias, The voyce of a
Cryer in the wildernes, prepare
ye the way of the Lord,
ſaith Eſay; Who art thou
ſay the Iewes to Iohn? The
voyce of a Crier in the Wilderneſſe,
prepare yee the
waies of the Lord, ſaith
Iohn to the Iewes.
               But our Sauiour as he
had two Natures, ſo hee
had two Meſſengers. Iohn
was a burning &amp; ſhining
Light on Earth, but the
Starre burned, &amp; ſhined
to giue him Light from
Heauen. A Starre ſhall
come out of Iacob, ſaith Balaam,
Num. 24. 17. Where
is the King of the Iewes.
ſaies the Wiſe men, for

we haue ſeene his ſtarre, &amp;
are come to worſhip him,
Mat. 2. 2. And this is the
heathen mans argument,
that ſo much troubled
Herod, and all Hieruſalem
with him.
               Now if we ſearch diligently,
eyther the time
when this ſtarre firſt appeared,
or the place whether
it led the Wiſe men
after it had brought them
out of their owne Countrey;
was it not in the
time of the firſt Herod,
Luke 3. 1. when the Scepter
was departed from
Iudah? Gen. 49. 10. And
the Land was forſaken of
both her Kings, Eſay 7. 16.

And this was olde Iacobs
argument to proue Iudahs
ſonne the Meſſias. The
Scepter ſhal not depart from
Iudah, till Shiloh, that is,
his Sonne come. And went
it not with them directly
to a little Bethleem? foretold
by Micah the 5. the 2.
and in the 2. and 5. of
Mathew interpreted by
the chiefe Prieſts and
Scribes, and people, all
gathered together at the
commmand of Herod to
this very purpoſe, who
making this quiry, Where
Chriſt ſtould be borne? receiued
this anſwere: In
Bethleem of Iudah. And
thou Bethleem art not the

leaſt among the Princes of
Iudah: for out of thee ſhall
come the Gouernour that
ſhall rule my people Iſraell.
And this was the Argument
of all our Sauiours
enemies met together againſt
him: Herods, the
chiefe Prieſts, the Scribes
and the Peoples to proue
him the Meſſias.
               Wee might now take
our Sauiour out of the
Cradle of his birth, and
looke vpon him in the
Miracles, Offices, Doctrine
and Humanity of
his Life: all which wee
ſhall finde curiouſly foretold
by Moyſes, Dauid, Eſay,
Zachary, and witneſſed

not onely by the
mouthes of Children and
Wiſe men; but forcibly
arreſted by the Peoples &amp;
Pilates, and the voyce of
the very Diuells themſelues,
crying, Wee know
thee what thou art, euen
the Holy one of God: but
becauſe the great Rocke
of Scandall whereat both
the obſtinate Iew ſtumbleth,
and the wiſe Grecian
of the world eſteemeth
folly, is the ignominie
of the Croſſe, the one
looking for the glory of a
Crowne, and therefore
hating the ſhame of the
Croſſe, and the other
knowing God to be impaſſible,

and therefore
mocking the Chriſtians
God by calling him 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
the Crucified
God: let vs ſee whether
our Sauiour may not ſay
to theſe two Naturalls,
what hee ſometimes said
to his owne diſciples trauelling
to Emaus, who at
that time were iuſt opinion'd
in euery point like
vnto. For firſt, they
dream'd of a temporall
Redemption. Secondly,
when they ſaw our Sauiour
condemned and crucified,
they concluded, it
could not be hee that
ſhould redeeme Iſraell.
Thirdly, they talked of

Chriſt, as of one dead &amp;
crucified, when hee walked
into the middeſt of
them: and when hee talked
to them out of his
word, their eies were held
(as theſe mens are) that
they know him not. And
therefore well may our
Sauiour now ſay to theſe
as hee did then to them.
O fooles and ſlow of heart,
to beleeue all that the Prophets
haue ſpoken: Ought
not Chriſt to ſuffer theſe
things, and to enter into
glory? Yes aſſuredly, if
with our Lord we ſhould
begin from Moſes (who
ſpilt the typicall bloud of
our Sauiour in his Paſchall

Lambe, and in all
his bloudy Sacrifices) &amp;
goe through all the Prophets,
we ſhall find none
more punctually leuelled
at him, or more cloſely
touching him to the
quicke, then thoſe of his
Paſſion.
               If GOD bee to ſmite
him, Zachary will foretell
it, Awake, O Sword, againſt
my Shepheard, and againſt
the man that is my fellow,
ſaith the Lord of Hoaſtes,
Zachar. 13. 7. If at this
firſt blow of God, his
Diſciples proue all fugitiues,
the ſame Prophet
in the ſame place foretels
it. Smite the Shepheard

and the ſheepe ſhall be ſcattered.
And this was our
Sauiours owne argument
to proue himſelfe the true
Shepheard, and them his
little, and fearefull flocke.
If the Iewiſh people and
the heathen Soldiers, if
the Kings of the earth,
&amp; the rulers of the Iewiſh
Synagogue gather themſelues
together againſt
him, as at his death they
did, and for many yeares
after: Dauid will not conceale
it: Why did the Heathen
rage, and the people
imagine vaine things?
The Kings of the earth
ſtood vp, and the Rulers
were gathered together

againſt the Lord, and againſt
his Chriſt. And
this was the argument
of the whole Primitiue
Church met together in
Prayer. Acts. 4. 27. If
wee would know who
ſhould betray him, Dauid
tells vs. Hee that eates
bread with me. And when
he had dipped the ſop, hee
gaue it to Iudas Iſcariot.
Sayes the beloued diſciple
Ioh. 13. 26. And
this was Iudas his venturous
Argument to proue
our Sauiour the Sonne
of God, and himſelfe the
ſonne of perdition. If we
would know the price of
his treaſon Zachary ſets it

downe. They weighed for
my price thirty pieces of ſiluer,
and I caſt them to the
Potter in the houſe of the
Lord: Zach. 11. 13.
               
               If the time of death be
doubted Dauid will foretell
vs, in the 9. Chapter
and 5. laſt verſes of his
Propheſie, where hee
reckons 70. weekes (euery
weeke ſtanding for a
Sabbaoth of yeares, a day
for a yeare, which makes
in all 490. yeares a ſhort
kinde of Arethmetique
vſuall in the Scripture.)
to be determined before
the cutting off of the
Meſſias. 7 weekes whereof,
that is 49. yeares,

were to be accompliſht
before the building of the
Temple. And 62. weekes
that is 434. yeares before
the Annoynting of the
moſt holy, which time
was ended, when the heauens
broke open themſelues,
and the Spirit of
God came riding out vpon
the wings of a Doue,
whoſe wings were ſiluer,
and his feathers flam'd
with pure gold, to anoynt
him to his propheticall
office with the
oyle of gladnes aboue all
his Fellowes, which holy
vnction St. Peter mentions
in this very Sermon
of his. Acts 10. 38. Now

the remainent weeke, that
conteynes 7. yeares more
in the midſt of which,
that is after 3. yeares and
a halfe the Meſſias by the
Sacrifice, and oblation of
himſelfe was to make all
other Sacrifices and Oblations
to ceaſe, wee ſhall
finde exactly fulfilled in
the preaching of our Sauiour,
who after hee had
preach't 3. yeares and a
halfe offered himſelfe
vpon the Alter of his
Croſſe. And this was the
Angell Gabriels moſt accurat
Argument to Daniel
to proue our Sauiour
the Meſſias, who here before
the time, was the

Prophet of his death, and
the meſſenger of his
Birth in the fulnes of
time after, and therefore
could beſt acquaint vs
with them both.
               But if we would ſee the
whole paſſion of our
Lord moſt exquiſitely
drawne with the lines of
his owne bloud, let vs but
ioyne Dauid, and Eſay,
and Zachary together, &amp;
you ſhall haue it expreſt
with as much as death
can be. If a crowne of
thornes teare his hayre,
and his whole viſage
ſhould bee ſhamefully
diſhonour'd with his
owne bloud, and the

peoples ſpettle, if his
backe ſhould be beaten
with ſtripes, and his
cheekes buffeted, Eſay
will ſet him before our
eyes in this very forme, in
his fifty and two and fifty
Chapters. His viſage
ſhall be more deform'd
then any mans (ſayes the
Prophets) his forme more
then the Sonnes of men:
I gaue my backe to the
ſmiters, and my cheekes to
them that pluck't of the
hayre, I hid not my face
from ſhame, and ſpetting.
               
               If his whole body
ſhould bee rack't, and
tenter'd with the violent
diſcenſion of euery part

of it vpon the Croſſe, ſo
that his bones ſhould be
diſioynted, and might all
be tould: if his handes,
&amp; feete were to be nayl'd
to it: if the people that
paſt by ſhould wagge
their heads at him, and
the Prieſts ſhould mock
him and ſay he truſted in
God let him deliuer him,
if he will haue him; if the
Soldiers ſhould caſt lotts
for his Garments, and the
ſtanders by ſhould giue
them vineger to drinke,
all this will Dauid moſt
heauily ſing in the 22. and
threeſcore and ninth Pſa.
All my bones are out of
ioynt, they pierced my hands,

and my feete, I may tell all
my bones. They that paſſe
by ſhake their heads at mee
ſaying. He truſted in God,
let him deliuer him if he will
haue him. I was a thirſt,

ſayes our Sauiour by Zachary,
in the 12. Chapter
and the 10. verſe of his
Propheſie: If all this
ſtorme fell from heauen
vpon him for th'iniquitie
of Gods people, and to
ſaue vs from death, Eſay
preciſely ſayes aſmuch in
the fore mentioned chap.
For the tranſgreſſion of my
people was he ſmitten, the
Lord hath layed vpon him
th'iniquity of vs all. And
this was Caiphas the
High-prieſts blind argument
to proue our Sauiour
the Meſſias. It is expedient
that one man ſhould
dye for the people. Iohn.

In a word his Buriall in
the graue of rich Ioſeph is
foretould by Iſay 53. He
ſhall make his graue with
the rich, and his Reſurrection
by Dauid Pſal. 16.
10. Thou wilt not leaue
my ſoule in hell, neither
wilt thou ſuffer thy Holy
one to ſee corruption. For
God before had made
his ſoule an offring for
ſinne, as Eſay tells vs 53.

great argument of the
two great Apoſtles,
wherewith they conuerted
both Iewe and Gentil

of his Eccleſiaſticall ſtory,
the 17. Chapter. Nor
th'illuſtrious report of
Ioſephus, in th' 18. of his
Antiquities both of our
Sauiour, and Iohn the
Baptiſt, which the Iewes
ignorantly ſlaunder as inſerted
by the Chriſtians,
miſtaking this Ioſephus,
the ſonne Matathias who
writ in Greeke, for another
Ioſephus of theirs,
who writ in Hebrew, the
ſonne of Gorion, in whom
indeed there is no ſuch
report. Nor the wirtie,

of ſome of the
Fathers. As of Iuſtin
Martyr, who would

the holding of Moſes
Armes in the figure of a
croſſe, and the ſpitting of
the Paſchalll Lambe with
the two ſhoulders paſſant
prefigur'd the crucifying
of our Lord: or of Irenaeus
ſpeaking of the incredulous
Iew, who
ſhould ſee our Sauiour,
the life of the world, hang
before his eyes, and yet
obſtinate his heart in vnbeleefe,
out of the eight
and twenty of Deut. Et

But if any would lay
the foundation of his
faith wider, and hope to
himſelfe more Arguments
to ground his
beleefe vpon: Let him
but aduiſedly thinke with
himſelfe how it became
the Sauiour of the world
to liue, and what other
witneſſes to beare him
teſtimony of him: and
then let him adde to the
propheſies of his death,
the innocence of his life.
For neuer any man liued
as he liu'd, which of you
(ſayes our Sauiour as to
all our enemies) can accuſe
me of ſinne: And to
the innocence of his life

the Authoritie of his
Doctrine. Neuer man
ſpake as this man does, ſay
the emiſſary ſcouts ſent
to apprehend him. And
to the Authoritie of his
Doctrine the power of
his miracles: Wee neuer
ſaw ſuch things in Iſrael,
ſay all the people, and to
the miracles that hee
wrought the miſeries that
he ſuffered, Behold and ſee
if there were euer griefe like
my griefe, may our Sauiour
truely ſay of himſelfe:
And to the miſeries
that he ſuffered himſelfe,
the conſtancy of his Appoſtles,
and Primitiue
Martyres that ſuffered for

him. Who, who euer
had ſuch witneſſes, as to
kindle other men into the
ſame faith with them,
would ſet themſelues on
a light fire of zeale, till
they were conſumed for
the honour of their Lord?
So that the firſt Imperious
Perſecutour of the
Chriſtians Nero▪
                   that in
humane lumpe of crueltie,
whom Nature for
haſt might ſeeme onely
to haue curded vp into a
knot of bloud, gueſt not
much amiſſe when anoynting
their bodies of
the Chriſtians he ſet them
burning in euery ſtreet of
Rome, like ſo many

Torches, to giue light to
the Cittie as Tacitus reportes
in the 15. of his
Annales. For they gaue
light indeed, not for awhile
onely to that heatheniſh
Cittie, but to the
whole Chriſtian world
for euer after. Neuer was
there day kindled with
halfe ſo many beames, as
that night was, ſure neuer
was there night, though
all the Starres in Heauen
ſhould flame out in it, to
make it glorious, that
ſhone halfe ſo brightly
as did this when to meet
their Bridegrome in the
firſt watch, and morning
of their Goſpell, ſo

many early Virgins had
lighted their Lampes.
               And to theſe liuing
Martyres, let him adde
two dead witneſſes, the
voyce of the Sonne from
heauen at his exſpiration,
when the whole world
loſt the day at Noone;
&amp; the voyce of the Earth
at his Reſurrection, when
her mouth opened, and
let abroad ſo many
Saintly bodies, that awakned,
and leapt out of
their graues to tell it in
Ieruſalem, that Chriſt was
riſen. O the Diuine vertue
of this celeſticall body!
If it die, heauen that
enlightens all, extinguiſhes

it ſelfe; if it reuiue,
the dead worke of
the Graue, that receiues
the dying, excludes the
liuing, and like the barren
wombe of Sarah is aluſt
to bring forth the Children
of promiſe, in teſtimonie
of the ſecret influence
of life it felt, after
Chriſt had layen with
her. And thus it became
the Sauiour of the world
to liue, thus to be borne,
thus to die againe; theſe
witneſſes became him, &amp;
theſe Miracles. And therfore
giue me leaue to vſe,
firſt
            
            
               
               IIII. A free Reprehenſion of all
faſhionable Aggrippaes
in faith; and farther motiues
to winne them to
become through beleeuers.
               AFter the voyce of ſo
many Propheſies, &amp;
witneſſes, art thou yet an
Infidell? O that there
were not in Chriſts militant
Church, as there
were in Othoes military
Campe, ſo many men, ſo
few Soldiers, ſo many
profeſſors, ſo few Chriſtians.
Let me but aske thee

as St. Paul did Agrippa,
Beleeueſt thou the Prophets?
and I would I could ſay
as he does. I know thou
beleeueſt; but I feare I may
better ſay, as the Propheſie
it ſelfe ſpeakes, Who
hath beleeued our report?
And what might the reaſon
be of ſo much infidelitie
among ſo many beleeuers
of vs; that ſo many
with the Roman Soldiers
ſhould kneele downe
to Chriſt, and by an open
profeſſiō of their mouthes
ſay to him Hayle King of
the Iewes with the ſmooth
voyce of Iacob, and yet
with their practiſe, and
rough hands of Eſau
                  
ſmite him on the head, &amp;
face, and crucifie him?
               Is it not becauſe they
liue neither as iuſt men
by Faith, nor as wiſemen,
by reaſon, but wholy by
ſence? ſo ignorant are
they, &amp; like bruit Beaſts
before God, beleeuing
only what they ſee, &amp; quae
ſunt ante pedes, as the
Oratour ſpeakes, what
they muſt needes ſtumble
vpon with their eyes, and
no more? Well: haſt
thou both thine eyes out
of Faith, and Reaſon? giue
me thy hand (O thou
reaſonable Beaſt) and follow
me with that one
blind eye of Sence, that

                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
thou haſt left thee. Thou
wilt not beleeue in Chriſt
becauſe thou didſt not
ſee the former Propheſies
foretoulde of him,
fulfilled by him. That
thou mayeſt ſee then,
what thou ſhouldeſt beleeue
now, beleeue thoſe
Propheſies which are yet
to be ſeene.
               Thou ſaweſt not perhaps,
the comming of
Chriſt in humilitie foretould
by the foregoing
Prophet; but that which
was foretould by his following
Apoſtles, thou
maiſt yet ſee
                     •
                  , the comming
of Antichriſt in
pride. Thou couldſt not

ſee Ieruſalem deſtroy the
Temple of Chriſts Body
foretould by the former
Prophets, but our Sauiour
himſelfe Propheſied
of the deſtruction of Ieruſalem,
and that is yet to
be ſeene. Thine eyes cannot
behold the ſpirituall
Kingdome of Chriſt, becauſe
it is of another
world, and beyond thy
eye ſight; but the power
of this Kingdome, which
was to breake in pieces
the former great Monarchies
of the world, and it
ſelfe to remaine vnſhaken
for euer, Propheſied
twice by Daniel in his 2.
and 7. Chapters, if thou

wilt but open thine eyes,
thou canſt not but behold.
The Diuine image
of the inuiſible God
dwelling bodily in the
humane Nature of our
Sauior propheſied in Eſays
Immanuel is to diuinely
ſubtile for his owls eies to
looke vpon: but it is viſibly
to be ſeene by thee,
that the falſe image of the
heathen, like Dagons Idol
before the Arke, are fallen
downe, and by the power
of Chriſts Kingdom beaten
to the ground, Propheſied
in the ſecond of
Eſay, and Dauid, and diuerſe
of the Prophets.
How the Kings of the

earth, and the Rulers
banded themſelues together
againſt the Lord,
and againſt his Chriſt, to
extinguiſh his Church in
the very Cradle of it,
Propheſied by Dauid,
was, thou wilt ſay, before
thou were borne to ſee
it: but happy, happy art
thou, that thou art borne
to ſee now Kings to be
the Nourſing Fathers &amp;
Queenes the Nurſing
Mothers of his Church
Propheſied by Eſay. Eſ.
49. 23. Thou ſeeſt not
the whole world Iew and
Gentil forget themſelues,
and rebell againſt the
Lord, denying his Kingdome,

or to be gouerned
by him: We haue no King
but Caeſar: But thou ſeeſt
now the Kingdome is
the Lords, and he is the
Gouernour among the
Nations, and that all the
ends of the earth hath remembred
themſelues, &amp;
turned vnto the Lord,
Propheſied by Dauid Pſa.
22. 27. Briefely thou seeſt
not the Reſurrection of
our Sauiour in glory among
the Iewes Propheſied
by Dauid; but thou
ſeeſt that which was immediately
to follow among
the Gentiles, the
Reſurrection of grace,
foretold by all the Prophets.

Neither canſt thou
ſee now the Iewes crying
crucifie him, crucifie him.
But thou maiſt yet ſee
that which inſtantly followes,
His bloud be vpon
vs, and vpon our Children.
               Since therefore thou
haſt lying before thine
eyes, by the power of
Chriſts kingdome, the 4.
great Monarches of the
world broken in peeces,
by the diuine Image of
God, the falſe images of
Heathen beaten downe,
the deſtruction of that citie
that deſtroyed him,
and the diſperſion of that
People that ſcattered his;

the rebellious Gentiles
his ſeruants, and the perſecuting
Kings his Subiects,
if thou wilt not be
among thoſe whom our
Sauiour bleſſes, Bleſſed
are they that haue not ſeene,
and yet haue beleeued, be at
leaſt one of Saint Thomas
his Diſciples, vſe thine
eyes as he did his fingers,
and be not faithleſſe, but
beleeue,
               For I will not feare to
ſay that the certainty of
our faith ariſing from the
Prophecies, is more powerable
to perſwade, thē
if it were by an ocular demonſtration,
now before
our eies miraculouſly cō
                  firmed,

then if one ſhould
riſe from the dead to inſtruct
vs, then if GOD
himſelfe ſhould deſcend,
&amp; ſpeake to vs from heauen.
A great audacitie of
ſpeech will ſome ſay: I,
and a proude hyperbole
of Truth, but ſuch as the
Scripture vſes, They haue
Moſes and the Prophets
(ſayes Abraham) let them
heare them. And though
ſuch purple-habited, and
high-dieted Epicures as
are already in the ſtate of
the damned, though they
liue in the world among
vs, fooliſhly ſuppoſe, that
of one ſhould riſe and come
to them from the dead, they

ſhould preſently beleeue
yet the Father of the faithfull
who knew better how
faith was begotten, tells
vs plainely; if they will
not heare Moſes, and the
Prophets, neyther will they
be perſwaded though one
roſe from the dead.
               
               
                  And what ſayes Saint
Peter, who himſelfe heard
the voyce of God immediately,
and gloriouſly
ſpeaking to him from
heauen? This is my Well-beloued
Sonne, heare him.
We haue (ſayes he) a more
ſure word of Prophecie,
whereunto you do well, that
yee take heed, 2. Pet. 1. 19.
               And is it poſſible any

word in the earth ſhould
be more certaine, then
word of God immediatly
ſpeaking to him from
heauen? Certes, not in
regard of the ſubſtance of
the thing deliuered. For
ſo both the word of God
immediatly framed by
himſelfe, &amp; ſpoken from
heauen, or vttered by the
mouth of his Prophet, is
all one, and hath the very
ſame identiall certaintie:
but both in regard of the
manner of deliuery, the
Propheſies are more ſure,
becauſe they are larger,
and more copiouſly expoſitiue
of themſelues, in
caſe of doubts emergent,

God ſpeaking but awhile
by a voyce immediately
framed by himſelfe,
but ſpeaking by his
Prophets from the beginning
of the world to
the end of it, which are
therefore interpretatiue
of themſelues: and ſpecially
in regard of vs, Becauſe
the voyce of God
immediately ſpeaking
from heauen to vs, is
more aſtoniſhing and
leſſe inſtructiue then otherwiſe
it would be. So
we ſee the Children of
Iſrael, when God ſpake
from heauen to them,
Exodus 20. 18. 19. ſhaken
into ſuch an Ague of

feare and trembling (as
Moſes himſelfe was, Heb.
12. 21.) that they ſtarted
backe, and ſtoode a farre
off, and cryed to Moſes.
O let not God ſpeake anie
more vnto vs, leſt wee die.
Which naturall feare
God does not onely pardon,
but approue, and
therefore ſtooping to
their nature, and laying
aſide his owne Maieſtie,
wee ſhall ſee in the 18. of
Deuter. 16. verſe, what he
ſayes to them, and by
whoſe mouth hee promiſes
to ſpeake to vs. According
to all that thou deſireſt
of the Lord thy God in
Horeb, in the day of the Aſſembly,

ſaying, Let me not
heare againe the voice of the
Lord my GOD, neither let
me ſee this great fire any
more, that I die not. And
the Lord ſayd vnto me, they
haue well ſpoken in all that
they haue ſaid, I will raiſe
them vp a Prophet from among
their Brethren, like
vnto thee, and will put my
words in his mouth, him
ſhall they heare, &amp;c. Thus
when the Greeks came to
ſee our Sauiour, Iohn 12.
21. and God gaue a maieſticall
witneſſe to him
from heauen: they were
all ſo horrowed with ſuddaine
amaſe and affright,
that ſome thought it

thundred; others, that an
Angel ſpake from heauen
to him: but what was
ſayd, none of them all
knew. And thus our Apoſtle
heere himſelfe was
for the time that GOD
ſpake in Mount Tabor,
ſtrucke halfe beſide his
vnderſtanding with feare
and aſtoniſhment. Matth,
17. 6. and talked himſelfe
hee knew not what. Luke
9. 33.
               
               We ſee therefore, how
ſtrongly the Rocke of our
ſaluation, Chriſt the Corner-ſtone
is layd by the
Prophets, in the Church
of God, and how mightily
Chriſt vpholdes the

Scriptures, that are built
vpon him: one by foretelling,
the other, by fulfilling,
the written word
how the liuing ſhould be
borne, and liue, and die,
ſhould bee buried, and
raiſed, and the Liuing
word, by ſo entring the
wombe, and his graue, ſo
liuing, dying, &amp; riſing, as
was written: ſo that if our
Goſpel be hid, it is hid to
thoſe onely, whoſe minds
are blinded by the God
of this world, as the Apoſtle
ſpeakes. But as our
Chriſtian Faith is much
diſhonoured by a company
of rude and vnſettled
Profeſſours; ſo it is

vtterly aſhamed of the
multitude of falſe, blind,
which is ſtrange, &amp; dumb
witneſſes the Church of
God is peſtered with. I
will end therefore with
            
            
               V. A iuſt Invectiue againſt all
falſe, blind, and dumbe
Prophets, who are indeed
no true Witneſſes
of the Lord.
               LEt the Ieſuit now, the
Sophiſter of Chriſtianitie,
cal to vs to beg light
and ſufficiencie, and auritie

to Gods word from
their Romane Church,
tell vs, tell vs that we muſt
run to Rome, to their Spirituall
Man to enterpret
the Scriptures, who commonly
vnderſtands not
the Tongues they were
writ in: Let their Apoſtolicall
Cha
                        •
                     re vaunt it ſelfe,
it cannot fall from the
Faith, becauſe the two
noble Apoſtles, S. Peter,
and S. Paul, ſate in it by
their doctrine, ymbrightened
it by their example,
and with their owne
blouds baptized it. Alas!
did not our Sauiour himſelfe
ſow Hieruſalem with
his doctrine, grace it with

his Miracles, ſhine vpon
it with the light of his
vniuitable example, water
it with the ſhowre
(the beſt ſhowre that euer
fell from heauen) of his
owne blood: And yet is
not that Vine-yeard become
a wilderneſſe? hath
it not loſſe with the
leaues the fruit, with the
power of Religion, the
profeſſion of it? And is it
poſſible that Gods word
ſhould bee darke it ſelfe
that giues light to the
ſimple? inſufficient, and
vnperfect in it ſelfe, that
makes perfit the Man of
God? that Gods word
ſhould begge authorities

from mans! and ſuch a
mans, who is either the
man of Sin, or the Beaſt
drunke with the blood
of the Saintes, and Martyrs
of Ieſus? from ſuch
a beaſtly, and ſinfull mans
word: That hee ſhould
bee the ſole and Infallible
Interpretour of
Gods word, and his diuine
Lawe, in whoſe
chayre-ſentence all our
thoughts muſt acquiet
themſelues, who by his
diſpenſatory court of Faculties,
is the daily Cancelour
of it, and is therefore

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   ſtiled by
the Apoſtle 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the
lawleſſe Man? Who can

make Apocryphal Authors
Canonicall; Humane Traditions
of Diuine Authoritie:
diſanulling in Princes
holy Marriages, and
making Legitimate amongſt
them inceſtuous
Contracts: Inioyning his
Fryars vnlawfull chaſtity,
forbidding his Seculars
holy Wedlocke, commending
in his Cardinals
royal exceſſiue pride,
commanding in his votaries
abiect humilitie;
counſayling in his Ieſuits,
blind, and ſinfull obedience,
countenancing in
forrein Subiects ſecret
and Sainctly Rebellion:
creating heere among vs

a Religious murder, and
meritorious treaſon, and
making the bulletting of
a whole Commonwealth
vp into the ayre at a ſhot,
an Action not onely vndiſcouerable,
and to bee
ſealed vp vnder the holy
Signet of Confeſſion,
but canonizing the father
of the Action for a moſt
heauenly and venerable
ſaint. All which to the
word of GOD are moſt
repugnant, and gladiatorie.
               Is this the man vpon
whoſe lip of knowledge
they would haue vs and
all the Prophets hang? to
kiſſe whoſe toes, and

commit idolatrie, with
the golden Croſſe vpon
his Pantofle, they would
haue vs flye ouer the ſeas?
               Well, when wee heare
ſay, hee is better able to
make good his Interpretations
by the Lights of
Art, &amp; helpe of Tongues,
and authoritie of Scriptures,
rightly inferred
from the Collation of
places, the ſignificancy of
phraſes, the light of circumſtances,
the Ayme of
the words, and the Analogie
of Faith, and hath
ioyned to all theſe a ſincere
loue of the Trueth,
without any ſiding, and
part-taking for gainefull

and honourable reſpects,
and an vnwearied ſearch
for it without prae-iudicating
affections (all which
together make vp, not an
infallible, but the leaſt
fallible Interpretour) we
will then thinke, whether
it bee fit to put out all
theſe Lights in other
men, thorough the whole
Church of GOD, and
with the loſſe of our
Chriſtian libertie, to imbondage
our ſelues to his
Romane Chayre.
               It is beſt therefore to
keep on this ſide the ſeas,
from the falſe and whoriſh
Prophet of Babylon,
that beares onely falſe

witneſſe to Chriſt, and to
conſider thoſe Eccleſiaſticall
home-Droanes of
our owne, which hiue
themſelues vnder the ſhadow
of our Church (the
wicked thiefe money, that
ſiluer dropſie, that now
raigns in vnconſcionable
Patrons, making way for
them) &amp; ſo beare indeed,
either no witneſſe to
Chriſt at all, or but very
ſlight, and raſh witneſſe.
               It was Eliahs ſpeech
from God to Ahab. Haſt
thou ſlaine, and alſo taken
poſſeſſion; and it may well
be his Churches to either
of theirs. Haſt thou taken
poſſeſſion, and wilt

thou ſlay alſo? not the
body once, but for euer
the ſoules, of innocent
men. Let no man quarrell
with me, as Ahab did
with Eliah. Haſt thou
found me O mine Enemie?
If he doe, I muſt borrow
Saint Paules anſwer: Am
I thine enemy, becauſe I tell
thee the Truth? No (I
ſpeake not out of raſh,
but charitable zeale) thou
art thine owne Enimie,
thou art Gods Enimie,
thou art the enimie of his
Church. For if thou didſt
loue him, thou wouldſt
feede his flocke, feede his
Sheepe, feed his Lambs.
If thou diddeſt loue his

Church, thou wouldeſt
ſhew thy loue by thy obedience
to it. Who enioynes
euery one eleuen
moneths reſidence vpon
his cure, and graunts him
but one months abſence,
whereas it is a venture,
but without long ſearch
you may finde one that
abſents himſelfe eleauen
moneths, and is reſident
but once a yeare, and that
is perhaps at harueſt, or
peraduenture at Eaſter,
when his owne, and not
ſo much the Churches
profit calles him to his
benefit, not his Benefice.
He would being reſident
preach euery Sunday, as

ſhee commaunds him, in
her 45. Cannon. Hee
would labour to cōuince
Heretiques, (which now
in his abſence growes vppon
her) or ſee them at
leaſt cenſured as she bids
him in her 65. and 66.
Canons. He would keepe
the ſound in ſafety, and
viſit the ſicke, as ſhee directs
him in her 67. Canon.
Thus he would do,
and not laugh at them
that did thus, and would
haue him doe ſo, as men
more preciſe, than wiſe,
of more heate than diſcretion.
I am not ſo intemperate,
as to rage againſt
all Non-reſidency,

which in caſe of inſufficiencie
of one Liuing, or
publique, and neceſſarie
imployment, either in Vniuerſities,
or Court,
muſt needs be allowable:
but either our Church it
ſelfe is preciſe, that bids
him doe thus: or he that
does the contrary without
any ouer-ballancing
reaſon, prooues himſelfe
a Baſtard, and none of hir
Children.
               A double wound it is
our church receiues from
theſe men. For as themſelues
haue not the grace
to correct their owne
ſinne, ſo they haue commonly
in their roomes

certaine vnder-curats, ſo
groſſely ignorant, as not
to know theirs. They that
know nothing thēſelues,
are ſet by theſe to teach
others, of whom we cannot
ſay, dies diei, but nox
nocti indicat ſcientiam.
One night teaches another,
a blinde Prophet, a
blinde People: yet I haue
ſeene ſome of theſe not
onely ſtand high vppon
their bare and ſolitary honeſty;
but peremptorily
cenſured graue and worthy
Miniſters, as Demoſthenes
an Arrian, the
Cooke of Valens, the
Emperours kitchin did
Saint Ambroſe, as men,

not throughly gifted for
their place, which reproach
Saint Ambroſe
ſmiling, put vp and off
with this merry anſwere.

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
I haue met with to day a
barbarous Demoſthenes:
but to the common virtues
of a Chriſtiā vpright
feet, and honeſt hands, it
were good theſe men
would adde the tongue
of the learned Eſay chap.
50. v. 4. elſe the Greeke
Epigram will finde fault
with their ſermons, and
tell them, ſound hands
and feete will not excuſe
lame heades and crackt
braines. 
                     
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        .
                  
               
               I do not deny but that
God is able to perfect his
power in theſe mens
weakeneſſe: For it is not
impoſſible for our ſpirituall
Sampſon (as hee ouercame
his enemies, and
was refreſhed with a iawe
of the ſeely beaſt) ſo to
make the waters of Life
ſpring between the teeth
of theſe ſimple creatures:
but theſe vnſent Runners
might do well to content
thēſelues with one Cure,
and not to be too buſie in
trudging between many,
as ſome of them are (for
to bee ſo officious muſt

needs proue offenſiue to
the church, till they know
better how to applie
more ſeaſonably, than yet
they can, the ſacred word
of God to the pretious
ſoules of their Hearers;
and to ſet thoſe Apples of
ſiluer into theſe pictures
of golde.
               Neyther doe I denie
but that ſuch trading
Preachers may find work
enough for their mouths,
by making other mens
labours runne through
them. But this is to get
their Liuing by the ſweat
of other men, &amp; to wipe
it off to their owne
browes. And if we ſhould

ſee a rude Carter offer to
play vpon the inſtrument
of a fine-fingred and dactrycall
Muſitian (ſuppoſe
one of theſe Tradeſ-men,
vpon the golden Harpe
of the ſweet Singer of Iſrael)
who could but laugh
at him, and ſay, as the
Greeke Prouerbe goes,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  Aſinus ad lyram.
But ſuch deriſorie
reproofes are too milde
for ſuch tayles of Ieroboam,
more fit indeede to
make Prieſts for Baal, thē
Prophets for God, who
intrude themſelues into
the Miniſtery for meere
neceſſity, and therefore
may ſay indeede with St.

                  Paul, A neceſesitie is layed
vpon me. But whereas the
Apoſtle proceedes, And
woe vnto me if I preach not
the Goſpell. How much
better may they ſay to
themſelues, and woe vnto
mee, if I preach the
Goſpell.
               And leſt wee ſhould
feare to ſpeake againſt
ſuch vagabond Shepheards
as are not able to
feed the flockes, they are
fed by, Propheſie againſt
them (ſaies the Lord) woe
to the Shepheards that feede
themſelues: that is their
end; but Gods end in appointing
Shepheards followes.
Should not the

ſheepheards ſeed the flocks?
Nay, what can they exſpect,
but the double woe
of Ieremy and Ezekiel:
woe, woe to the Shepheards
that deſtroy and ſcatter my
ſheepe. But as theſe blinde
Guides are moſt inſenſible
of their owne maladies,
becauſe ignorance
is a diſeaſe (as the Greeke
Tragedian calls it) that
neuer paines a man 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  :
ſo it is no
leſſe then a myracle to a
man of vnderſtanding,
to ſee the great zeale and
little knowledge, ſome
well, but weake minded
people vſe, to defend
theſe Tradeſ-men with:

Was not our Sauiour,
ſay they, a Carpenter,
Marke 6. 3. before he was
ſent to preach? S. Peter
a Fiſherman, Matthew a
Publican, S. Paul a Tentmaker?
True indeed; but
our Sauiour ventured not
himſelfe to preach, before
the Spirit of GOD
ſent him, Luk. 4. 18. and
lay'd a moſt diſtrict
charge vpō his Apoſtles,
to tarry at Hieruſalem,
till by the commiſſion of
the Holy Ghoſt, they
ſhould be indued with
power from on high, Luk.
24. 49. But theſe men, as
they cannot arrogate the
ordinary means to make

their Calling iuſtifiable:
ſo I ſuppoſe no man euer
ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending
vpon them, and
fitting them with extraordinary
and infuſed
gifts of knowledge.
               Chriſt, indeede was a
Carpenter, but to build
heauen and earth, and his
Church in them both: S.
Peter was a Fiſher, but to
angle in all the Circumciſion
to the Faith of
Chriſt, &amp; to circumciſe,
not their fore-ſkins, but
their hearts, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
as an ancient Father, alluding
to the fifth and ſecond
of Ioſua, where the
Iſraelites were circumciſed

with kniues of ſtone,
moſt elogantly ſpeaketh
of him. Mathew was a
Publican, but to gather
the precious ſoules of
men into the Heauenlie
Treaſury of the King of
Kings. Saint Paul was a
Tent-maker, but to perſwade
Iaphet to dwell in
the Tents of Sem, and to
ſpread Chriſts Tabernacle
all the world ouer among
the Gentiles. But
in the great day of their
Reckoning, when the
Diſciples of our Lord
ſhall bring in their Accomps,
and S. Paul ſhall
ſay, I haue gathered to the
faith, all the Riches of the

Gentiles; and S. Thomas,
I haue gained all the treaſures
of India; and S. Peter,
I haue gathered the
diſperſions of Iudah:
What ſhall theſe hirelings
ſay, but wee in our
little flocks haue ſcattered
ſo many, and we haue
deſtroyed ſo many, and
we haue waſted &amp; prey'd
vpon &amp; deuour'd ſo many.
And therefore as the
feete of theſe wiſe Stewards
ſhall ſhine like the
Starres of heauen for
brightneſſe; ſo theſe had
need to take heed leaſt
their heads, for the
clowdes of ignorance
they are wrapt vp in,

meet not with Marcellus
his fate, apud inferos. Cui
non atra caput triſti circum
volat vmbra.
               
               Pardon mee (right
deerely beloued in our
Lord and Sauiour) if
when Thorns &amp; Thiftles
grow vpon Gods Altar,
as the Prophet Hoſea
ſpeakes, I am forced to
vſe a little fire of Zeale to
conſume them. I am ſorry
there is ſuch a neceſſity
ſtill for Gods ſpirit to deſcend
in fiery Tongues.
O that it might alwaies
flie down with the wings
of a Doue from heauen
vpon vs. But as long as
common Cuſtomes lawfully
                  
robbe the Churches
Treaſure, and commit open
ſacriledge euery day
more then other vpon
Melchiſedcks Tithes, the
Patrimony of Chriſt; inſomuch,
as it is verilie
thought, the Church
within theſe threeſcore
yeres, by concealements,
incroachments, and cuſtomary
thefts, hath been
ſpoyled of no leſſe then
40000. yearely. What
hope can there be of ſufficiency
of the Prophets,
when the inſufficiency of
their meanes will not afford
it? when one Subiect
into whoſe cofers 20000
pounds: when a Lay Parſon,

into whoſe Cofers
20000. pounds annually
flow in, and therefore if
he were but a Phariſee in
profeſſion, ſhould out of
his aboundant ſtreames
of wealth, caſt in much
into the common Treaſury
of the Church, ſhall
taken into his owne poſſeſſion
fifteeene houſes of
God, and ſticke downe
but the bare feathers of
ten pounds or twenty
Nobles a yeere for the
needy ſeruice of Gods
Altar? Can all the flouriſhing
and pragmaticall
wits in the world, if they
were headed in one
braine, ſhew by what iuſt

right a Laye hand can inuade
&amp; coaſt vpon Gods
portion of Tithes, which
he hath giuē to thoſe that
wait vpon his Altar for
the food of their bodies,
and the poore people
change with vs for the
foode of their ſoules? Is
not this the reaſon why
in the great harueſt there
are ſo few Laboures. For
the Pſalmiſt had no ſooner
ſaid, They haue ſent
fire into thy Sanctuary
(meaning perhaps the fire
of Couetouſneſſe that deuoures
all) or as he ſpeaks
of them in another Pſalm
Let vs take to our ſelues
the houſes of God in poſſeſſion;
                  
but preſently it followeth,
There is no more
any Prophet, neither is
there among vs any that
knowes.
               
               But GOD perſwade
thoſe whom it moſt concernes,
to regard in time
the common pouerty of
the Church, and to ſet a
ſea-banke againſt this diluviating
euill of Satan,
who as GOD drowned
all the world in the beginning
of it, and ſau'd aliue
onely the Arke of his
Church, ſo now in the
end of it would the Diuel
drowne the Arke and
Church of God it ſelfe,
with theſe inundations

of blinde Seers, dumbe
Teachers, betraying Patrones,
Sacrilegious Cuſtomes,
Lay-Parſons,
theeuiſh Tithings, and
which by the abuſe of
them, were become ſo
many Chappells of Sathan,
where many a ſoule
turn'd the Sabbaoth of
God into the Deuils holi-day,
drunken Tap-houſes;
vnder the weight of
which ſinne, the whole
Land ſtaggered, and the
Churches; of God, like
poore Sion, euen vpon
his own day, lay deſolate
and waſte. But theſe gates
of Hell ſhall neuer preuaile
againſt the Suburbs

of Heauen, Gods ſainctly
Colony here on earth,
and therefore wee will
end as Dauid doth, Pſa.
20. 9. Say Lord; Let
the King heare vs
when we call.
               
            
         
         FINIS.
