            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE RIGHT HOnorable, Sir William Cecill, Knight of the Garter, Baron of Burghley, Lord high Treaſurer of England, and Chauncellor of the Vniuerſitie of Cambridge: Grace and peace.
            
            
               
                  I
                Publiſhed a Booke (Right Honourable) against the Browniſts, who complaine of hard dealing, and not onlie they, but others, in that I haue termed them Donatiſts, and charge them with ſundrie foule matters. And hauing now receiued from them an anſwer vnto one part of that my booke; I haue alſo framed this replie: In which I firſt ſet downe from point to point out of the writings of the holie Father Auguſtine, with what Scriptures and arguments it was defended, and ſo compare our mens writings and doings with the ſame. They muſt for this, chuſe either to affirme, that the Donatiſts had the truth, and the churches

were periſhed: or elſe ſhewe ſome materiall points of Donatiſme, which they doo not hold. And then in the latter part of this my booke, I anſwer to that which is publiſhed now by them againſt read prayer. As I was bold to preſent the former vnto your Honor, ſo do I alſo humblie offer this, preſuming vpon your Honors fauourable acceptation. And thus I beſeech the Lord God to bleſſe and proſper your Honor.
            Amen.
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               GOod Chriſtian reader, I publiſhed a booke againſt the Brownists, whom I haue in the ſame termed the Donatiſts of England. How farre of I was from purpoſing anie ſuch thing at the firſt, and how I was drawne into it afterward, I haue in that former booke truly reported. And for warrant of my doing before the Lord, I had no doubt but that it ſhould bee an acceptable ſeruice to Chriſt: notwithſtanding when I reſpect the waightines and neceſsitie of the worke, I haue alwaies wiſhed, and do wiſh, that ſome man of greater learning might deale againſt thē. Neither as yet am I caſt into any thoughts of doubting, by the miſlike, or fault finding of ſome in all places, which are no Brownists: But I am rather thruſt forward by beholding that weakenes of iudgement and want of vnderſtanding not in a feaw, touching the foulnes of Donatiſme, and by the ſight of ſuch nerenes of multitudes vnto the danger, which before I coulde not ſuſpect. Now touching the faultes which are found, which cauſeth the miſlike, they are partelie for the matter it ſelfe, and partlie for the manner of dealing both in it, as alſo towards the perſons themſelues againſt whome I write. In the matter ſome haue found fault as though I ſhould ſtand to cleere &amp; to iuſtifie al things, not onlie in the Booke of Common praier, but alſo in the calling and ordination of our Miniſters, and in our

Church gouernement, others affirme that I haue diminiſhed the faults which are eſteemed to be in theſe, and made them lighter, at the leaſt by not reproouing them. The firſt ſort I cannot but meruaile at, ſeeing I haue in that my former booke ſet downe expreſſie in theſe words, that the matter in queſtion betweene the Browniſts and me, is not about the controuerſie in our Church, as whether there be imperfections, corruptions and faults, in our Worſhip, Miniſterie and Church gouernement, nor how many great or ſmal: but whether there be ſuch heinous enormities as deſtroy the verie life, and being of a true Church, and make an vtter diuorſe from Chriſt. I doo then lay open the ſtate of this queſtion ſo plainelie, as I know not how to make it more plaine: now vnles I ſhould run through euerie particular which wee deale in, which I thought to be needleſſe, but now I will a little ſtand vpon it. They reckon Romiſh faſts, Ember dayes, Saincts eues and Lent: Idoll feaſts, as Alhallowes, Candlemas, ſeuerall Ladie daies, Saincts daies, dedicating Churches vnto Saints. Comminations, Rogations, and Purifications, Tithes, Offerings, Mortuaries, howſling the ſick, with the Sacrament, abſolution, and blaſphemous dirges, and funerall Sermons, ouer and for the dead. Corrupt manner of adminiſtring the Sacraments, the Font, the croſſe in Baptiſme, Baptiſme by women, goſsippings, blaſphemous and hereticall collects. Theſe and certaine other haue they ſet downe, to bee in the Booke not vnder the termes of faults, blemiſhes and corruptions, but as hereſies, blaſphemies, and abominations, and that ſuch as ouerturne the foundation of the

Chriſtian faith, deſtroy the ſubſtance of Gods worſhip, and take away the life, and beeing of a true Church. To this I haue anſwered, that they be foule ſlaunderours liars, &amp; falſe accuſers, ſhewing that our Church hath renounced in thoſe former things that which is blaſphemous and hereticall, or ſo abominable, as that it approacheth neereſt to the deſtroying of the faith and holy worſhip of the Lord. As namelie the remiſsion of ſinnes, and merite of eternall life by faſting, which is the doctrine of the Romiſh church. The worſhip and inuocation of Saints and Angels, the power of expelling Diuels by the ſigne of the croſſe, and ſuch like things which the papacie is full of, but reiected by vs. If the Browniſts in their replie againſt that I haue written, ſhall prooue by the word of God, that there be great corruptiōs in our praiers, in our faſts, in our keeping the Saints dayes, in the Croſſe, and in manie other things which bee in our Church, as in our Miniſterie and Church gouernemēt. And further if their proofes be neuer ſo clere &amp; ſtrong from the Scriptures, yet they anſwere not me at al, nor touch the queſtion or controuerſie between them and me, vnles they can prooue them to be ſuch faults as deſtroy the worſhip of God, ouerturne the foundation of the faith, and take away the verie life and being of true Chriſtianitie. If (I ſay) they do not prooue them, according as they haue ſet thē downe, to bee blaſphemies, hereſies, abominations, yea the verie worſhip and yoake of Antichriſt, the marke of the beaſt, and his power: I remaine vnanſwered, and they ſtand conuicted as liars, ſlanderers and moſt wicked falſe accuſers not of particular perſons, but of

whole Churches. For I ſhewed in expreſſe wordes that I doo not meddle at all in theſe queſtions, whether there bee corruptions and faults in our Church condemned by Gods word, whether they bee manie or fewe, whether they bee ſmall or great, but onelie thus farre whether they bee ſuch or ſo great, as make our Churches Antichriſtian. Here therefore I doo intreate the Chriſtian Reader to fixe his eyes in reading my writings and theirs, onelie vppon this one queſtion, whether there be in our Church any errors or faults that be found amentall? Looke if I haue in this point by denying that there bee ſwarued from the ſacred word of God, from the iudgement of the holie Churches, and writings of the moſt worthy &amp; noble inſtruments which God hath at all times giuen to be the guides and lights in the ſame. And if it can be prooued, that I haue gone awrie from the trueth but an heire breadth, I will reuoke it: for trueth is to bee bowed vnto and reuerenced, whereſoeuer ſhee ſheweth her ſweete face, of all that looke to haue any part in her. Marke alſo their writings as they ſhall come foorth, and ſee wherein they can conuince me of any error, falſehood or corruption, touching this one forenamed queſtion, vnto which they are to be held ſeeing we ſet all other controuerſies aſide.
            Then touching the ſecond ſorte, which finde fault about handling the matter, as if that I ſhould mitigate or make lighter the faults of our Churches, at leaſt in this, that I do not reprehend them. To this I anſwer, firſt, that vnles it can bee ſhewed, that our Church is guilty in ſome of thoſe crimes which I ſtand to clere it in, I ſee no reaſon why I ſhoulde bee charged to

make things lighter, which I medle not withall, further than in ſhewing that they be not fundamentall. Secondlie, I intreate al men to conſider that I ſtand to defend a Church, and not the infirmities or offences of a Church, in which as there be many bad mēbers, ſo the beſt are traile. If a godlie man becauſe of ſome apparant ſinnes, ſhould be accuſed to be an Atheiſt, an infidell, a traitor, or a moſt vile and filthie wretch: might not he clere himſelfe of ſuch horrible crimes, but it muſt be ſaide, he dooth mittigate his owne infirmities or make them lighter? Thirdlie, I doo requeſt them to conſider the ſtate of our people, how ſpeedelie verie manie are carried into great euils and dangers, though not all in the ſame degree. I am of this minde, that where any thing is amiſſe in Gods Church, it is the part and duetie of the faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt, all dutifull reuerence and ſubmiſsion being obſerued towards Magiſtrates &amp; publique authoritie, peaciblie to ſeeke redreſſe of the ſame, with godlie and charitable reprehenſion. I doo alſo holde that euery chriſtian man is wiſelie and ſoberly (with the like deuties of reuerence, ſubmiſsion, and peaceable behauiour obſerued) to ſeeke to haue his conſcience informed in all matters, which may any way concerne himſelfe. But we ſee how farre ſome haue ſwarued and doo ſwarue from this. For the rule of charitie and chriſtian dueties being neglected, the vttet diſgrace and contempt of men is ſought, and that on either part. The warre is made as deadlie, as if the grounds of chriſtianitie were in queſtion: while ſome paſsing the bounds of modeſtie, others doo replie againſt them after the ſame manner. Our Sauiour ſaith Satan dooth not caſt foorth Satan: and ſhall we

thinke then that ſinne, ſhall caſt foorth ſinne? Such as condemne and abhorre Schiſme and errors, and inordinate dealing, muſt bee burthened and reproached with the ſame notwithſtanding, which is iniurious. And what is in the mouthes of many againſt this, but that the Papiſts then may as well be excuſed, which condemne Maſter Luther and other as the fathers of heretiks, becauſe ſwarmes of Anabaptiſts did followe immediatelie vpon their preaching the Goſpel? When ſhall we then here come to an end? There wil bee contention in the Church: and humaine frailtie hath ſhewed it ſelfe this way, euen among the holie teachers of old, to the ſharp reprehenſion, and in manner reproaching one of another, as Maſter Beza noteth in the Epiſtle of his Booke againſt Erastus: but godlie men when they haue ſomewhat gone awrie, ſeek to amend their fault, by ſubduing their paſsions. Now looke alſo vpon the people, where wee may ſee verie many; who not regarding the chiefe chriſtian vertues &amp; godlie dueties, as namelie to be meek, to be patient, to be lowlie, to be full of loue and mercie, to deale vprightlie and iuſtly, to guide their families in the feare of God, with wholſome inſtructions, and to ſtand faſt in the calling, in which God hath ſet them) giue thēſelues wholy to this, euen as if it were the ſumme and pith of religion, namelie to argue and talke continuallie againſt matters in the Church, againſt Biſhops and Miniſters, and one againſt another on both ſides. Some are proceeded to this, that they will come to the aſſemblies to heare the Sermons and praiers of the Preacher, but not to the praiers of the booke, which I take to be a more grieuous ſinne than manie doo ſuppoſe. But yet this is not the worſt, for

ſundrie are gone further, and fallen into a damuable Schiſme: and the ſame ſo much the more feareful &amp; dangerous, in that manie do not ſee the foulenes of it, but rather holde them as godlie Chriſtians, and but a little ouerſhot in ſome matters. The ſore is grieuous, and the wound is deepe; as I haue ſmall ioy to behold it, ſo haue I leſſe deſire to make it deeper, wiſhing from my heart, that it might rather be cured. Such as bee of another minde, either in this, or in any thing that I haue writtē, I craue of them, that they wil giue me leaue, according to the doctrine and rule of the Apoſtle, fraterne diſſentire, to diſſent in ſome thing, without the breach and hindrance of brotherly loue. For as I do greatlie eſteeme that rule of S. Paul, let as manie as be perfect be thus minded: if any be otherwiſe minded, God will reueale it. But ſo farre as we are come, let vs proceed by one rule, to be like affectioned Phil. 3. ſo do I much lament to ſee it almoſt vtterly neglected, and the breach of loue &amp; concord as violent among many, for euery matter wherein they diſſent, as if ſome ground of chriſtianity were in queſtion between them. I do not meane that a man ought to conſent vnto any error, or vnto any euill committed by others, or to neglect the inſtructing and admoniſhing, as his place and calling dooth require. But I had rather (as one ſaith) anſwer to God, if I muſt giue account, for mercie, rather than for rigour and ſeueritie. I knowe there be faults in extremities on both ſides: as on the one ſide vnder a perſwaſion of loue, a man may be ouer fauorable in eſteeming and bearing as brethren, ſuch as hold the foundations of the faith, and yet erre in ſome things, and haue great faultes: ſo on the other ſide, vnder a perſwaſion of zeale againſt

all falſehood and wickednes, they may fall into an vncharitable rigour, as very many doo. The nature of man is more prone to this latter, and the fall is more grieuous than in that former; few are carried with aboundance of godly loue, to offend in ouer fauorable iudging their brethren: and becauſe the elect of God haue great infirmities, &amp; the Scripture doth not warrant men to be rigorous in condemning, if a man holding the hatred &amp; zeale againſt all ſin, iudge &amp; repute them as chriſtian brethren, which it may be are not, his fall is not great, although he be ouer fauorable; for through humility he is below. Wheras on the other part, ſuch as condemne with vncharitable rigor, they are lifted vp with ſwelling, and ſo their fall is deeper. This is my meaning in that I ſaide, I had rather anſwer to God for mercy than for rigour: now as I eſchew it in my ſelf, ſo would I be loath, ſeeing rigor aboundeth among many, to giue any occaſion to nouriſh the ſame by my writing. If I ſin in this, yet I truſt it is ſo, as no godly charitable man &amp; wel aduiſed wil make an outcry againſt me for it; if I ſhake hāds with ſin let me be condēned for it, otherwiſe I craue that I may follow the rule of the Apoſtle. But now it wil be ſaid by the third ſort which finde fault with my book that I haue broken this rule towards the Browniſts: as alſo that rule of S. Paul, who willeth to inſtruct with patience ſuch as be contrary minded, becauſe I charg them not only with foule Schiſme, but alſo with hereſies, and for which I take it that obſtinacie if it be found in thē, wil make them heretickes. They differ not frō vs, ſay ſome, in matters of faith, but doo ouer ſhoot thēſelues, &amp; that on the right hand: for anſwer vnto theſe, firſt touching the rules of Paul, I know he

himſelf did practize thē. And he that gaue theſe rules, ſo far as wee are come let vs proceed by one rule, &amp;c. and inſtructing with patience &amp;c. ſaid alſo beware of dogs, beware of euill workmen, beware of the conciſion. Philip. 3.
            Why did. S. Paule this, but mooued with the danger which the Churches were in by them? Men haue not now the conſideration what it is to condemne the whole worſhip &amp; the Miniſtrie as Antichriſtian, and ſo vtterlie to take away the credite and power of the Miniſtrie and preaching Gods word. Will they eſteeme it to bee leſſe than that which the falſe Apoſtles did? Againe, I ſee men are ignorant what the power of Donatiſme was, how it preuailed and ſpread not onelie among the common ſort, but had hundreths of preachers to publiſh and ſet it foorth. Neither doo men knowe the foulenes of Donatiſme, nor the poynts of it, and that maketh them offended, that I terme the Browniſts Donatiſts, &amp; hold it as a ſchiſme and hereſie. Creſconius the Donatiſt writing againſt Auguſtine, doth reprehend him for calling them hereticks; becauſe they held the ſame doctrine, as hee ſaith, and if they offended, it could bee but as in a ſchiſme. Augustine replieth, that Schiſma inueteratum eſt haereſis, Inueterate ſchiſme is hereſie. And ſheweth that ſome thinges they helde were hereticall. The Churches haue condemned it not only as a ſchiſme, but alſo as an hereſie. I haue out of large diſcourſes of the controuerſies betweene▪ the Churches and the Donatiſts, drawen foorth brieflie all the chiefe heads of Donatiſme, and how they did ſtand to maintaine them, and with what ſcriptures. I compare the Browniſts and them together in all poynts generallie held,

and will ſtand to iuſtifie that they bee full Donatiſts, euen in the rankeſt Donatiſme. If I haue not ſet down the Donatiſme aright, and if the Browniſme be not the ſame, let me haue the ſhame for euer, that I haue giuē them the title, and can not iuſtifie that they are worthie of it. Let the Browniſts chuſe which part they will, either to affirme that the Donatiſts had the truth, or elſe to cleere thēſelues frō 
               Donatiſme, I will ioyne with them, or rather againſt them in either. And in the meane time I do exhort al other to be ſober minded and diſcreet, and not to thruſt the ſimpler ſort headlong into it, by exclaiming that they bee ouer hardlie dealt withall. For what ſay ſome? If theſe that are called Browniſts bee godly men, and but ouerſeene in ſome matters, we will chuſe to ioyne with thē, rather thā with the publike aſſemblies of our Church. Theſe men are they in compaſsion of whō I write. Now, the chiefe heads in which I compare them are theſe: The Donatiſts did falſelie accuſe and condemne the Churches and al the Miniſters to be vtterlie polluted, and al their worſhip, and ſeparated themſelues without all order of diſcipline: So haue the Browniſts done. The Donatiſts tooke beginning by occaſion of one man, whom they held to be no Miniſter of Chriſt, but after they made their defence that all were polluted, and all the Miniſters the generatiōs of Traitors, Iudaſſes, and perſecutors of the iuſt: that the Churches in the beginning after the times of perſecution were not well ordered by ſeparation of the faithfull from the wicked. For becauſe there were many both Miniſters and people which in time of perſecution to ſaue their liues had denied the faith &amp; ſacrificed to Idols, and deliuered the holie Scriptures

to the perſecutors: and when Conſtantine gaue peace, being become Chriſtian, returned and were not caſt foorth. Hereupon the Donatiſts ſaid all were vtterlie polluted: &amp; that becauſe ſome ſuch did ordaine Miniſters, at leaſt as they reported, they accuſed all the Miniſters to bee the ſons of traitors which ordained them, and ſo were no miniſters of Chriſt, had no true praier, nor Sacraments. The Browniſts affirme that all our aſſemblies which openlie committed Idolatrie, were at the ſound of a Trumpet, at the coronation of the Queene called to be Churches: that the bad were not ſeparated frō the good: that our ordainers were Idolaters, &amp; that we are their children; no Miniſters of Chriſt, but Baals prieſts &amp; perſecutors: &amp; ſo haue no word of God, nor no Sacraments, nor true church, all being polluted with the open ſinnes committed. Thus both make the holie things of the Lord, which indeed are vnchangeable, or els we could haue no cō
               fort: as namely, the word of God, the praiers, the Sacraments, &amp; the ordination of Miniſters, to be polluted &amp; deſtroied by the wickednes of men. The Donatists held that Princes were not to compell vnto religion, &amp; ſo cried out of perſecution, &amp; gloried of their ſufferings &amp; multitude of martyres. And what do the Browniſts? Theſe things with the reſt will better appeare in the ſeuerall compariſons, as they followe in my booke. I now intreate the reader not to iudge of any one thing vntill he haue read the whole. I alſo deſire that the ſayings of the ancient writers which I alleage may be wel waied, for proofe of that for which I cite them. If any ſhall ſay, what ſhall we ground vppon men? I anſwer, I alleage them but to ſhew what the controuerſie was &amp; how it was diſputed on both

ſides: &amp; for this they are ſufficient witneſſes. Beleeue their reaſons as ye find they be confirmed by the holie Scriptures: I haue ſet downe the Latin, leaſt any ſhould thinke I haue not dealt plainlie. And touching the laſt part of this my booke which is an anſwer to Maſter Greenwood, concerning read prayer, peruſe it throughlie and then iudge whether I haue charged him wrongfullie in any matter. I do lament that many of our people which haue been hearers of the Goſpell, ſhould be ſo ignorant, as to ſuck in ſuch dregs as he offereth. Now to conclude, there are two things which deceiue many, which I deſire thē to conſider: one is that they are caried away with many true and notable ſentences of Scripture &amp; worthie principles which the Browniſts ſet down, not conſidering or not eſpying how they from them doo draw out falſe aſſumptions, and thereupon cōclude that which is vntrue. The other is that they looke not vpō that which followeth vppon their wordes by conſequence, but ſtand vpon this, O they hold no ſuch thing, they haue wrong. Maſter Greenwood crieth out that he doth not condēneal Churches, he denieth not that the pſalmes are to be ſung to God, he ſaith not that the regenerate do not ſin, he hath no ſuch meaning, he hath wrong. But mark if I haue done him any wrong at all: looke vpon his ſayings, and vpon that which muſt needes followe vpon them. The other Browniſts crie out of the like wrōgs. Iudge not vntil both ye heare wherein they haue wrong, and ſee mine anſwer. If I haue charged them with matter which either their words doo not expreſſe, or that followeth not from them by neceſſarie conſequence, let me then bee iudged raſh and vncharitable.
            FINIS.
         
      
      
         
            
            That the Browniſts are full Donatiſts.
            
            
               NO Apoſtle, no Prophet, no Euangeliſt, no true paſtor or teacher can haue his owne name put vpon the Diſciples which he gathereth: but as they bee all gathered onely by Chriſtes doctrine and vnto Chriſt alone, according as it is written, one is your Doctor, euen Chriſt: Matth. 23. ſo are they onely by his title called Chriſtians. But it hath béen the manner of olde, and euen from the time of the Apoſtles, in Gods Church, when any wicked ſchiſme or hereſie hath ſprung vp, to call the ſcholers and followers by the names of the firſt maſters of the ſame, and chiefe leaders. As of Montanus, the Montaniſts; of Nouatius, the Nouatians; of Arrius, the Arrians; of Pelagius, the Pelagians; of Donatus, the Donatiſts; of the Pope, the Papiſts, &amp;c. And who ſhall reprehend this as vaine, or condemne it as a thing vniuſt, ſeeing wee followe his example, who ſaith to the Angell of the Church of Pergamus, Reuel. 2. Thou haſt them which hold the doctrine of the Nicholaitanes? Now, there is a ſect in England commonly called Browniſts, not becauſe Browne was the firſt originall of it, but for that he hath written and publiſhed bookes in maintenance and enlargement thereof, and with more ſkill and learning than others which either as yet haue followed, or gone before him. Many men thinke that they

bee ſprung vp but of late, whereas in very déede it is well knowne there was a Church of them in London 20. yeares paſt, and one Bolton a principall doer therein, whoſe fearefull end is not forgotten. I haue termed them the Donatiſts of England. How iuſtly, and how charitablie, and with what due conſideration, it ſtandeth me now vpon to ſhewe; leaſt the ignoranter ſort of ſuch as ſomewhat fauour them, ſhould imagine, that I haue iniuriouſlie and falſelie giuen them this odious title, to worke their vniuſt diſcredite. For Donatiſme in olde time, about twelue hundred yeares paſt, was condemned as a deteſtable proud Schiſme and hereſie, that began at Carthage in Aphrica, and was vehementlie withſtood by the faithfull Paſtors, and cut downe by the holie Scriptures, as no learned godlie man will denie. The holie Father Auguſtine was the chiefe that did ouerthrowe them, as his writings which are extant, anſwering to their writings at large doo declare. Now, my purpoſe at this time is to compare them together, the Donatiſts and the Browniſts, from point to point out of the writings of Auguſtine. If it fall out cléere and manifeſt that they agree together, as euen as two peeces of cloath that are of the ſame wooll, the ſame threed, colour, working &amp; breadth: and that an Egge is no liker to an Egge, than they be each to other: I hope all that be ſober minded will not blame me for giuing them the ſame title. Their originall, firſt, (of the Donatiſts I meane, and how they cut off themſelues) is to bee noted &amp; ſet foorth; which was this. From the birth of our Sauiour Chriſt, for the ſpace of thrée hundred yeares &amp; more, there were euer anon great and greeuous perſecutions raiſed vp againſt the Church, by the Romane Emperours, vntill the Emperour Conſtantine the great imbraced the holie Goſpell, and gaue peace to the Chriſtians. In thoſe daies of perſecution, ſuch as through feare, or otherwiſe, did deliuer to the cruell perſecutors, either the bookes of the holie Scriptures, that they might burne and deface them, or the veſſells appointed for holie vſe in the publike aſſemblies, that they might carrie them away; or the names of the brethren, that they might

finde them out: ſuch (I ſay) were called traditores, that is, deliuerers or traitors. There was a rumour that ſuch offence had béen by ſome committed, as no doubt it was by many. Now, as Auguſtine reporteth in his Pſalme againſt the Donatiſts, there came certaine Biſhops from Numidia vnto Carthage, a famous Citie in Aphrica, to ordeine a Biſhop, and found Caecilianus alreadie ordeined and placed in the Seate: then were they wroth that they could not ordeine. They ioyned together, and layd a crime vpon Caecilianus. They ſay his ordeiner deliuered the holie bookes and was a traitor: whereupon they will haue him reputed no Miniſter of Chriſt, but the ſonne of a traitor. There was no aſſemblie of the learned Paſtors for to iudge in this caſe according to Chriſtes ordinance and diſcipline: the accuſed and the accuſer did not ſtand foorth for triall. There were no witneſſes produced to prooue the crime: neither were matters ſcanned by the Scriptures. But furor, dolus, &amp; tumultus, that is, furie, deceipt, and tumult, did beare the ſway, as Auguſtine ſheweth in the ſame his Pſalm. They aſſembled which were the accuſers, and Caecilianus is condemned being abſent, by Tigiſitanus Secundus, as hée ſheweth in his firſt booke againſt Parmenian Chap. 3. and in his third booke againſt Creſconius Chap. 40. Now was there great ſtirre and deuiſion begun: Donatus, he ſteppeth foorth and requireth of the Emperour Conſtantine to haue Iudges (not of Aphrica, out beyond the ſeas) to heare the crime which was to be obiected againſt Caecilianus. The Emperour appointed that the matter ſhould bee heard at Rome, where Caecilianus was cléered, and Donatus and his part receiuing repulſe appealed, accuſing Meltiades then Biſhop of Rome, that he was alſo traditor, as Auguſtine reporteth in his firſt booke againſt Parmenian, Chapt. 5. and ſo they require to haue the cauſe heard by the Emperour, vnto whom they had appealed: where hauing alſo the repulſe, as falſe accuſers, they ſay ye Emperour was corrupted through fauour. They made a ſeparation from Caecilianus and thoſe that claue to him. The deuiſion grewe greater and greater, they had aſſemblies

and Biſhops on Donatus part in proceſſe of time in great number. They condemned not only the Church at Carthage, and the neighbour Churches in Aphrica, as guiltie therewith, but all Churches through the world as wrapped together in the guiltines of thoſe Churches of Aphrica. They pronounced them all polluted, vncleane, abominable and vtterlie fallen from the Couenant of God, through the pollution of ſuch as had committed ſacrilege, and were not ſeperated. They ſaid there were no Miniſters of Chriſt, no Sacraments, &amp; ſo no true Church among them, but heapes of wicked polluted ſacrilegious perſons, whoſe teachers were all generations of traitors, Iudaſſes, &amp; perſecutors of Gods Saints, and that as many as would bee ſaued muſt ſeperate themſelues, and ioyne with the pure ſelected companie of Donatus. And for theſe reſpects they baptized again all ſuch as fell vnto them, as not being baptized before, but polluted with a prophane waſhing. Now, through the ſhew of burning zeale, and ſtiffe rigorous ſeueritie in condemning ſinne, and by the vehement outcries which they made that the diſcipline was not duely executed, in as much as the prophane were mingled together in the aſſemblies with ye pure, and no ſeperation made: many of the people not well ſettled and grounded in the trueth, were terrified and turned vnto them, taking them to be moſt zealous holie men, and the onlie true Church in earth: and with excéeding bitterneſſe condemned all other as abominable Idolaters and curſed traytors, whoſe worſhip God abhorred. It was before the daies of Auguſtine that this ſect began, and in his time was greatlie ſpread. And when he wrote that it was againſt all equitie to condemne (as they did at the firſt) the whole world for the ſinne of Caecilianus, becauſe if he were guiltie, yet the Churches farre off knew not ſo much, but might rather iudge him cléere, being cléered in iudgement. They maintained the matter to prooue that there were no true flocks, nor paſtors after another ſort: and did affirme, that as the Church of Carthage, and the Churches elſewhere in Aphrica, were fallen from God by the pollution of the ſacrilege of Caecilianus

and other: ſo all other Churches in the world were deſtroyed by the like ſacrileges committed in the daies of perſecution by wicked men among them, whoſe ſinnes were open and knowne and no ſeperation made. For thus ſpeaketh Parmenian a Donatiſt Biſhop, as Auguſtine doth ſet it downe in his firſt booke againſt him, and third Chapter. Dicit etiam Parmenianus; hinc probari conſceleratum fuiſſe orbem terrarum criminibus traditionis, &amp; aliorum ſacrilegiorum: quia cum multa talia fuerint tempore perſecutionis admiſſa, nulla propterea facta eſt in ipſis prouincijs ſeparatio populorum. That is, Parmenian alſo ſaith, that from hence it is prooued, that the world hath been together made wicked, or hainouſlie polluted with the crimes of treaſon and of other ſacrileges: becauſe, when many ſuch things were done in the time of perſecution, there was no ſeperation of the people made for the ſame in the Prouinces. Marke well this ſaying of Parmenian the Donatiſt, for it doth expreſſie ſet downe the ground of Donatiſme. The words of Petilian another Donatiſt Biſhop, to prooue all the Miniſters of the Churches to be but ſucceſſors of traitors (as Auguſtine doth report them in his ſecond booke againſt him Chapt. 8.) are many, I will onely recite the chiefe of them. This Petilian hauing before ſaide, that he which is baptized by one that is dead, his waſhing doth profite him nothing: then procéedeth to ſhewe how farre (as he ſaith) an vnfaithfull traitor may be accompted dead while he liueth. And for this be frameth a compariſon betwéene Iudas and the Paſtors of the Church, condemning them as the worſe. For after he hath ſet forth that Iudas was an Apoſtle when he betraied Chriſt, and ſpirituallie dead when he had loſt the honour of an Apoſtle: and as it was foretold by Dauid that another ſhould haue his place, ſo Matthias ſuccéeded him in the Apoſtleſhip. He would haue no foole here diſpute that Matthias dare away triumph and not iniurie, which by the victorie of Chriſt, had the ſpoyle of the traitor. Then he demandeth, how canſt thou by this déede challenge to thy ſelfe the office of a Biſhop, being the heire of a more wicked traitor?

               Iudas Christum carnalem tradidit, tu ſpiritualem; furens Euangelium ſanctum flammis ſacrilegis tradidisti. Iudas betraied Chriſt carnal, thou ſpirituall; being in furie thou haſt deliuered the holie Goſpell to the fire. Iudas legiſlatorem tradidit perfidis: tu quaſi eius reliquias legem dei perdendā hominibus tradidisti. Iudas betraied the lawgiuer to the wicked: thou haſt betraied as it were his reliques the lawe of God vnto mē to be deſtroied. Si hominis mortui teſtamentū flammis incenderes, nonne falſarius punireris? quid de te ergo futurum eſt, qui ſanctiſſimam legem dei iudicis incendisti? If thou ſhouldeſt burne the will of a dead man, ſhouldeſt thou not bee puniſhed as a falſifier? what then ſhall become of thee, which haſt burnt the moſt holie lawe of GOD the Iudge? Iudam facti vel in morte poenituit: te non modò non poenitet, verumetiam nequiſſimus traditor nobis legem ſeruantibus, perſecutor &amp; carnifex existis. Iudas repented him of his deed, at leaſt in death: but thou doeſt not onely not repent, but alſo being a moſt wicked traitor, remaineſt a perſecutor and a tormentor of vs that keepe the lawe. Creſconius
                a Grammarian (one as it ſeemeth that taught ſome Grammar ſchoole) tooke vpon him to write againſt Auguſtine in the defence of Petilian, or rather of the whole Donatiſme, and he laieth to the charge of Caecilianus the vnpardonable ſinne againſt the holie Ghoſt, in betraying the ſcriptures to the perſecutors, vſing this argument: Holie men of God deliuered them as they were led by the holie Ghoſt, (Auguſtine in the 4. booke againſt Creſconius, Chapt. 8.) Petilian (though otherwiſe full of great bragging) being verie vnwilling to haue open diſputation in any open aſſembly of learned men, vſed this arrogant ſpeach: Indignum eſt vt in vnum conueniant filij martyrum, &amp; progenies traditorum. It is an vnworthie thing that the ſonnes of the Martyres and the generations of traitors ſhould be aſſembled together.
                Thus much may ſuffice for this poynt. Where we ſee that the Donatiſts departed diſorderlie out of the Church, condemning it not for any poynt of doctrine (for therein they did not diſagree) but for that many, which in the time of perſecution

diſſembled, many which reuolted, and to ſaue their liues did ſacrifice to the Idolls: many which deliuered the bookes of holie Scripture to bee burned, and betraied the names of the brethren; when the ſtorme was ouer, &amp; there was a ſodaine calme, the Emperour Conſtantine being become Chriſtian, ſuch ioy in all Chriſtian lands, Chriſtianitie magnified with ſuch honour: for that (I ſay) many ſuch returned to profeſſe the Goſpell againe as members of the Church, and were receiued. For, ſaide the Donatiſts, the Church is holie, conſiſting of ſuch as be called foorth and ſeparated from the vnpure and wicked world: and therefore no ſeparation being made, but ſuch villanous traitors, ſo vile Idolaters, and their childrē being communicated withall, all your aſſemblies through this mixture are none other before GOD, but heapes of abominable vncleane perſons. Your teachers are the ſonnes of Apoſtates and traitors, and no Miniſters of Chriſt. Now looke vpon the Donatiſts of England: Antichriſt hath béen exalted according to the propheſie of S. Paule, he hath ſate in the Temple of God, boaſting himſelfe as God, perſecuting and murthering Gods true worſhippers. He is diſcloſed by the glorious light of the Goſpell: his damnable doctrine, curſed Idolatrie, and vſurped tyrannie are caſt foorth of this land by the holie ſacred power of our dread Soueraigne Ladie Quéene Elizabeth, whom God hath placed &amp; ſettled vpon the Throne of this noble Kingdome. The true doctrine of faith is publiſhed, and penalties are by lawes appoynted for ſuch as ſhall ſtubbernlie deſpiſe the ſame. Our Donatiſts crie out, that our aſſemblies, (as ye may ſee in their printed bookes) and that the people were all by conſtraint receiued immediatlie from Idolatrie into our Church without preaching of the Goſpell, by the ſound of a Trumpet at the Coronation of the Queene, that they bee confuſed aſſemblies, without any ſeparation of the good from the bad. They affirme alſo that our Miniſters haue their diſcent and ordination, and power, from Antichriſt, and ſo are his marked ſeruants. Hereupon, not vnderſtanding the manifeſt Scripture, that the Apoſtaſie

               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
hauing inuaded the Church, it continued ſtill euen then the Temple of God in which Antichriſt did ſit, and that the verie Idolaters were within the Church, were ſealed with the ſigne of baptiſme, profeſſed Chriſt in ſome points rightlie, their children from ancient diſcent being within the couenant of God, and of right to bee baptized, the Miniſterie of Chriſt ſo farre remaining, as that it was the authentick ſeale which was deliuered by the ſame; in a mad furie, like blind hypocrites they condemne the reformation by ciuill power, and purging Gods Temple by the authoritie of Princes, becauſe the Church of Chriſt is founded and built by the doctrine of the Goſpell. Herein they are deceiued, that they imagine the Princes take vpon them to compell thoſe to bée a Church which were none before: whereas indeed they doo but compell thoſe within their kingdome ouer whome the Lord hath ſet them, which haue receiued the ſigne of the couenant, and profeſſe themſelues to bee members of the Church, accordinglie to renounce and forſake all falſe worſhip, and to imbrace the doctrine of ſaluation. What other thing did Ioſias and other holie Kings of Iuda, when they compelled the multitude of Idolaters which were the ſeede of Abraham, and circumciſed, to forſake their Idolatrie and to worſhip the Lord? It is moſt cléere alſo, that where the reformation of the Kings was not perfect, (as appeareth in the bookes of the Kings and Chronicles) yet all the fouleſt things being aboliſhed, and the ſubſtance of trueth brought in, they were reputed godlie Churches, where many were falſe brethren and open offenders. The Browniſts blinded with their ſwelling pride, and not ſéeing the euident matters of the Scriptures, without all order of that holie diſcipline of Chriſt, accuſe, condemne and forſake our Churches, vnder the appearance of feruent zeale, and rigorous ſeueritie againſt all ſinne, not inferiour to the Donatiſts; as if they were the onely men that ſtood for Chriſt and his kingdome, they crie out aloude and proclaime all the Miniſters of our Churches to be Antichriſtian, the ſonnes of the Pope, falſe Prophets, Baals Prieſts, that propheſie in Baal, and pleade

for Baal, perſecutors of the iuſt, bearing the marke, the power and life of the beaſt, becauſe they ſay our ordeiners bee ſuch. They ſay wee haue no word of God, no Sacraments nor true Church, but that all is vtterlie polluted and become abominable: our aſſemblies they call the very Synagogs of Antichriſt, vtterlie fallen from the couenant of God, and all that ioyne with them, through the pollution of open ſinners which are not caſt foorth: and therefore they haue ſeparated themſelues, and crie aloude vnto others to doo the ſame if they will be ſaued. What rule of diſcipline haue they obſerued in this? Haue theſe things béen brought foorth, ſcanned, diſcuſſed, and iudged in the Synods of the learned Paſtors and teachers of the Churches? Nay, but euen as Auguſtine ſaith of the other, furor, dolus, &amp; tumultus, furie, deceipt and tumult, do beare the ſway.
                Then I conclude, that in this poynt of accuſing, condemning, and manner of ſeparating themſelues from the Church, the Donatiſts and the Browniſts doo agree and are alike. Some man will here replie, that I build vppon a weake ground, or rather vpon the ſand, in prouing the Browniſts and the Donatiſts to bée all one, becauſe they are alike in accuſing and condemning the Churches, and ſeparating themſelues from the ſame. For the matter reſteth not ſimply vpon the actions; but whether there were iuſt cauſe. The queſtion will bee whether the Browniſts doo that iuſtlie, which the Donatiſts did vngodly. For the Donatiſts did accuſe the Churches and Miniſters falſely, condemned them moſt wickedly, and therefore their ſeparation could not bee good, becauſe it was from the true Churches of Chriſt: but now if the Browniſts obiect open and manifeſt crimes, ſuch as cannot be denied, their caſe doth differ farre. May not a man ſeparate himſelfe from thoſe aſſemblies, where he ſeeth open ſinners ſuffered on heapes to remaine in the boſome of the Church, and where idolatries, blaſphemies and abominations are committed, where the Miniſters and gouernment be Antichriſtian, but he muſt bée a Donatiſt? Moreouer, it is certaine the Donatiſts did condemne all Churches in the world; the Browniſts doo condemne

onely the aſſemblies as they generally ſtand in England, which is a very great difference. The Donatiſts hold that the Sacraments or the efficacie of them doth depend vpon the worthines of the Miniſter: the Browniſts are not of that mind. The Donatiſts did rebaptize; the Browniſts doo vrge no ſuch thing. It may be alſo they are vnlike in ſome other things: if it be ſo, why ſhould they be termed Donatiſts? Indeed if there be ſuch differences, the Browniſts haue great wrong to bee called Donatiſts, and to bee condemned with ſo wicked a ſect? But what if it fall out otherwiſe, and that it be ſhewed and prooued manifeſtlie that they be all one in theſe things? Shall wee not then ſay they be euen brethren? ſhall they not ſtand or fall with the Donatiſts? ſhall they be vngodlie Schiſmatickes, and not theſe? I will procéede from poynt to poynt, to compare them together, that it may appeare whether there be difference. Touching the firſt, it is moſt true that the Donatiſts did accuſe and condemne the Churches and the Miniſters of the Churches moſt falſelie: and I ſay the Browniſts are as falſe accuſers as they, and condemne as iniuſtlie in all crimes which they obiect, and ſhall in no wiſe bee found vnlike in this poynt. Yea, will it bee ſayd, how ſhall that appeare? All men doo knowe that the Browniſts may without any falſe accuſing lay greeuous faults to the Church of England. I graunt they may: and I ſay likewiſe, the Donatiſts might lay as great faults to the charge of many Churches then, and in ſome points greater, &amp; yet be no liers. This is to be prooued by comparing the Churches of thoſe times with ours: for ſo ſhall wee ſee how farre both haue iuſtlie accuſed, or might accuſe, and where they meete together as falſe accuſers. The Browniſts may ſtand foorth and accuſe the church of England in this manner: That there bee heapes of open ſinners not ſeparated from among the good, but ſuffered and admitted to the Lords table, at leaſt wiſe in many, or in the moſt aſſemblies: There be prophane ignorant perſons that deſpiſe the holie religion: There bee ſwearers and curſers: There bee thoſe that are puffed vp and ſwell in pride and

vaine glorie: There be ſwarmes of drunkards, gluttons and vnchaſt perſons: There be couetous worldlings, and greedie vſurers, extortioners, oppreſſors, bribers and defrauders: There be liers, backbiters, and ſlanderers: There bée enuious, hateful and contentious perſons: yea, what ſinnes almoſt are wanting? Where ſhall a man goe but he is readie to fall into companies of wicked men? This is not alone among the common people; but verie many of thoſe that ſhould bee guiders, lights, and patternes of godlineſſe vnto others, are nothing leſſe. Who is able to deny theſe things? heauen and earth will witneſſe againſt him. We may lift vp our voyces and ſay: wee haue ſinned with our fathers, wee haue done wickedlie. We may confeſſe that our iniquities are heaped vp and reach aboue the clowdes, and that ſhame and confuſion of face is due vnto vs. Wee may crie, ſaue Lord for the godlie ceaſe, the faithfull are diminiſhed from the children of men. The complaints that the Prophets doo make euerie where againſt the Church of Iſrael, may verie well be applied againſt vs. Where is loue, where is fidelitie, where is mercie, where is trueth? But now ſhall wee thinke that the Donatiſts had no ſuch things to accuſe the Churches of in thoſe daies? Could they not ſay your aſſemblies are full of couetous men, proud perſons both men and women? Had they not iuſt cauſe to complaine that many walked in hatred and diſcord? Doo ye imagine that there were no vngodlie Miniſters? or will ye ſuppoſe that Auguſtine and other holie men ſtoode to cléere and iuſtifie the Churches that way againſt the Donatiſts and other Heretickes? Nay, let their words bee heard what they teſtifie in this behalfe. Creſconius alleaged this ſaying of the Lord, I will giue ye ſhepheards according to my heart, which ſhal feede yee with knowledge and vnderſtanding. Ieremy. 3. This he cited to prooue that the Paſtors ought to bee faithfull. Auguſtine maketh anſwere thus: Scio, completum eſt, tales Apostoli fuerunt, tales etiam nunc, etſi pro eccleſiae latitudine perpauci, non tamen deſunt. That is, I knowe it is fulfilled, ſuch were the Apoſtles, ſuch alſo there be now, though
               
               very fewe in reſpect of the largenes of the Church, yet they are not wanting. This is a plain teſtimonie that in the time of Auguſtine the faithfull ſincere godlie Paſtors were verie fewe in compariſon. Many teſtimonies may be brought out of diuers ancient writers for this matter: but I will bring but ſome fewe, and firſt out of Cyprian, which alone are ſufficient being both large and cleere. Cyprian was in the time of perſecution before the Donatiſts ſprung vp; and after one perſecution was ouer, he wrote an Epiſtle de lapſis, of thoſe that fell and denied Chriſt: In which firſt he triumphantly reioyceth ouer them which ſtoode; then he mourneth dolefullie for thoſe that fell: and after that he ſheweth why God ſent that perſecution. Si cladis cauſa cognoſcitur, &amp; medela vulneris inuenitur, Deus probare familiam ſuam voluit. If (ſaith he) the cauſe of the ſlaughter be knowne, the cure of the wound is found alſo, God would prooue his familie. Et quia traditam nobis diuinitus diſciplinam pax longa corruperat, iacētem fidem, &amp; poenè dixerim dormientem, cenſura coeleſtis erexit.
                That is, and becauſe long peace had corrupted the diſcipline deliuered vs of God, the heauenlie cenſure hath raiſed vp the faith lying along, I may ſay almoſt ſleeping. Then ſhewing that God did not puniſh them ſo much as they deſerued, he ſetteth foorth the greeuous open ſinnes committed in the Church. Studebant augendo patrimonio ſinguli, &amp; obliti quid credentes, aut ſub Apostolis ante feciſſent, aut postmodum facere deberent, inſatiabili cupiditatis ardore ampliandis facultatibus incubabant. That is, They ſtudied euerie one to increaſe their patrimonie, and hauing forgotten either what the beleeuers had done before in the time of the Apoſtles, or what they ought to doo afterward, they all did applie themſelues to increaſe their riches with an inſatiable burning heate of couetous deſire. Here is one ſinne that ouerſpread: then he addeth further. Non in Sacerdotibus religio deuota, non in ministris fides integra, non in operibus miſericordia, non in moribus diſciplina. There was not deuout religion in the Prieſts, there was not the ſound faith in the Miniſters, there was not mercie in
               
               
               workes, there was not diſcipline in manners. And what more? Corrupta barba in viris, in foeminis forma fucata. Adulterati poſt dei manus oculi, capilli mendacio colora
                     •
                  i. Ad decipienda corda ſimplicium callidae fraudes, circumueniendis fratribus ſubdolae voluptates. Iungere cum infidelibus vinculum matrimonij, prostituere cum gentilibus membra Christi. Non iurare tantum temerè, ſed adhuc etiam peierare. Prapoſitos ſuperbo tumore contemnere, venenato ore ſibi maledicere. Odijs pertinacibus inuicem diſſidere. The beard was corrupted, or diſguiſed, in men: the beautie was counterfeit or painted in women. The eyes corrupted from the forme in which Gods hands had made them, the haires were ſet out with a falſe colour: ſubtill fraudes to deceiue the hearts of the ſimple; deceiptfull pleaſures to circumuent the brethren. They coupled themſelues in mariage with infidels; they proſtituted the members of Chriſt with the heathen: they did not onely ſweare raſhlie, but alſo forſweare. They contemned their gouernours with ſwelling pride, and curſed themſelues with venymed mouth, being at diſcord among themſelues with ſtiffe hatreds.
                Are not theſe horrible ſinnes which ouerflowed in the church? Is there no more? Yes, he ſaith, Epiſcopi plurimi, quos &amp; ornamento eſſe oportet ceteris, &amp; exemplo, diuina procuratione contempta, procuratores rerum ſecularium fieri, derelicta cathedra, plebe deſerta, per alienas prouincias oberrantes negociationis quaeſtuoſae nundinas aucupari. Eſurientibus in eccleſia fratribus habere argentum largiter velle, fundos inſidioſis fraudibus rapere, vſuris multiplicantibus foenus augere. That is, very many Biſhops, which ought to bee an ornament and an example vnto other men, deſpiſing the deuine cure, became factors in worldly matters, leauing the chaire, forſaking the people, wandring through other Prouinces, did hunt after faires or markets of gainefull trafficke. The brethren hungring in the Church they had ſiluer in great plentie: they would in rauening manner get lands by ſubtill fraud, increaſe their gaine with vſurie. What ſhall we ſay, did this holie Cyprian falſelie accuſe the Churches of his time, in laying theſe greeuous crimes

to the charge both of the Paſtors and the people? Doubtles he ſpake the trueth. It will be demaunded whether Cyprian and the reſt of the godlie did worſhip together with thoſe open ſinners, ioyning with them in praier &amp; receiuing the Sacraments. We ſee it is manifeſt they did: for he deſcribeth not the heathen, or ſuch as had been caſt foorth of the Church, but ſuch as God ſent chaſticement vpon to raiſe vp the faith which was almoſt, as he ſaith, a ſleepe. He doth alſo teſtifie in plaine wordes, that the godlie could not ſeparate themſelues from the Church, becauſe of ſuch open ſinners, without proud obſtinacie and ſacrilegious preſumption. He ſpeaketh vpon this occaſion: there were certaine which had ſuffered impriſonment for the Goſpell; among whom was one Maximus an Elder, and certaine brethren, which when they came out of priſon, ſeparated themſelues from the Church, taking offence at the open ſinners which were not caſt foorth, as it appeareth by the words of Cyprian. For hauing teſtified his gladnes yt they had forſaken their ſchiſme, and did returne againe into the Church: he addeth, Nam etſi videntur in eccleſia eſſe zizania, non tamen impediri debet aut fides, aut charit as nostra, vt quoniam zizania eſſe in eccleſia ſemper cernimus, ipſi de eccleſia recedamus. Nobis tantummodo laborandum eſt, vt frumentum eſſe poſſimus, vt cum caperit frumentum dominicis horreis condi, fructum pro opere nostro &amp; labore capiamus. That is, Although there bee tares ſeene to be in the Church, yet neither our faith nor our charitie ought to be hindered, that becauſe wee alwaies perceiue tares to be in the Church, wee our ſelues ſhould goe out of the Church: wee muſt onely labour that we may bee corne, that when the corne ſhall begin to belayd vp in the Lords barnes, wee may receiue fruit for our work &amp; labour. Then further he addeth: Apoſtolus in Epistola ſua dicit, in domo autem magna, non ſolū vaſa ſunt aurea, &amp; argentea, ſed &amp; lignea, &amp; fictilia, et quaedā quidē honorata, quaedā vero inhonorata: nos operā demus, &amp; quantum poſſumus laboremus vt vas aureū, vel argenteū ſimus. The Apoſtle his Epiſtle ſaith, but in a great houſe there are not
               
               
               onely veſſels of gold and ſiluer, but alſo of wood and earth, and ſome vnto honour, and ſome vnto diſhonour: let vs doo our endeuour, and labour what we can, that wee may be veſſels of gold, or at leaſt of ſiluer. Finallie he ſaith: Caeterum fictilia vaſa confringere domino ſoli conceſſum eſt, cui &amp; virga ferrea data eſt. Eſſe non poteſt maior domino ſuo ſeruus: nec quiſquam ſibi quod ſoli filio pater tribuit vendicarit, vt ſe putet vniuerſa poſſe zizania, humano iudicio ſegregare: ſuperba eſt ista obstinatio, &amp; ſacrilega preſumptio, quam ſibi furor prauus adſumit, &amp; dum ſibi ſemper quidam plus quam mitis iusticia depoſcit, aſſumunt, de eccleſia pereunt: &amp; dum ſe inſolenter extollunt, ipſo ſuo tumore caecati, veritatis lumen amittunt. But it is graunted onely to the Lord to breake the earthen veſſels, to whom alſo the yron mace is giuen. The ſeruant cannot be greater than his Lord, neither ſhall any challenge that to himſelfe, which the father hath giuen to the ſonne alone, that he ſhould think he can by humane iudgement ſeuer all the tares. That is a proud obſtinacie and ſacrilegious preſumption, which wicked furie doth take to it ſelfe. And while ſome doo alwaies take more vpon them, than meeke iuſtice dooth require, they periſh out of the Church: and while they inſolentlie extoll themſelues, being blinded with that very ſwelling of theirs, they loſe the light of the trueth.
                What can be more manifeſt than theſe teſtimonies, which ſhewe that there were greeuous open ſinnes committed by multitudes in the Church, not onely of the common ſort, but euen of the teachers? We ſee they did communicate together, as in the old Church vnder the law, heapes of notorious wicked men did flock vnto the Temple and worſhip at the ſame Altar and Sacrifices with the godlie. Hierom in his Epiſtle to Paulinus ſheweth, there were many of all ſorts, both men and women, which did preſumptuouſlie, ignorantlie, &amp; with baine glorie prattle of the ſcriptures, and ſo abuſe the bolie word of God. And in the Miniſtrie there were that had ſtepped from ſeculer learning to deale with the Scriptures, which being able to rowle out words, thought they made goodlie ſermons. Therefore if

the Donatiſts had but complained that there were multitudes of open ſinners in the Church, as proude, couetous, hatefull perſons, irreligious and prophane abuſers of the Scriptures, and not only of the common ſort, but alſo of the teachers: their complaint had béen true. But when they proceeded thus; That all that did communicate with any ſuch open ſinners, were polluted by them, and fell from God: and ſo termed all the Paſtors wicked traitors and Iudaſſes, wretches, whoſe worſhip and praiers were abominable, and all the people that ioyned with them prophane and heathen: therein they became falſe accuſers and wicked coudemners: they did with moſt intollerable pride and ſacrilegious treacherie publiſh a diuorſe betweene Chriſt and his ſpouſe. The Browniſts offend in the ſame degree in accuſing, condemning, and caſting foorth the Churches of Chriſt, affirming that by open ſinners admitted to the Lords table, all are fallen from the couenant of grace, haue no true Sacraments, nor Church, but are as an heape of polluted heathen, whoſe worſhip and praiers are abominable.
            Now that it may appeare vnto euery one that will not ſhut his eyes, that in this point our Browniſts, (I ſpeake of the Capitaines) are full Donatiſts, I wilenter into the particular diſcourſes, and ſhew vpon what Scriptures they ſtood, and with what arguments they maintained this their wicked hereticall opinion. And what anſwere they receaued from the holieſeruants of God, the paſtors of the Churches. Wherein I deſire the reader to obſerue whether there may be found one haire breadth of difference between them: talke with the Browniſts about this point which they hold, that where open ſinners are admitted to the participation of the Sacraments, all which communicate with them are polluted, and caſt away: or reade the bookes and writings of theirs which are ſpread, marke well the ſentences and places of Scripture which they alleage and quote, and what reaſons they drawe out of them, and then looke vpon theſe. For I will note the chiefe Teſtimonies of holy Scripture that the Donatiſts did alleage, to proue that all Churches

were polluted by the mixture of open ſinners, and that a ſeparation was commaunded by God from ſuch aſſemblies, which are theſe. Come out from among them (ſaieth the Lord) and touch no vncleane thing, and I will receaue yee, and I will be your Father, and you ſhall be my Sonnes and my Daughters, ſaith the Lord God Almightie. 2. Cor. 6. Haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruitefull workes of darkenes but rather reprooue them. Epheſ. 5. Bee not partakers of other mens ſinnes. 1. Tim. 5. A little leauen dooth leauen the whole lumpe; and take away the euill from among yee. 1. Cor. 5. Ifanie which is called a Brother be a Fornicator, an I dolater, or couetous, &amp;c. with ſuch ſee that yee eate not. 1. Cor. 5. What hath the Chaffe to doo with the Corne? Ierem. 23. Alſo depart, depart, come out from thence, and touch no vncleane thing, come out from the middeſt thereof and ſeperate your ſelues, yee that beare the veſſels of the Lord. I ſay. 52. All theſe and ſome other did Parmenian the Donatiſt Biſhop alleage in his Epiſtle. Wee may not thinke that theſe Scriptures were alleaged onely by ſome one Donatiſt: for Auguſtine in his booke De vnico Baptiſmo againſt Petilian Chapter 14. ſaith, Magis enim ſolent in ore habere, quando peccatis aliorum alios criminantur, ad excuſandum nefas ſeparationis ſuae, videbas furem &amp; concurrebas cum eo, &amp;c. For they are wont rather to haue in their mouth, when they accuſe ſome to be guiltie or polluted by the ſinnes of other, to excuſe their wicked ſeperation? Thou ſaweſt a theefe and diddeſt run with him. Pſal. 50.
                And be not partakers of other mens ſinnes, depart and come out from thence, touch no vncleane thing, &amp; he that ſhal touch that which is vncleane ſhal be poluted, and a little leauen dooth leauen the whole lump, and other ſuch like. Now what the eſtate of the queſtion was, (and how they held men polluted, if they did not ſeperate themſelues) the diſputation betweene the Catholique Biſhops and the Donatiſts which were aſſembled at the cōmaundement of the Emperour dooth ſhew. Where the names of the Donatiſt Biſhops that had ſubſcribed their conſent to that conference,

were two hundreth ſeauentie and nine, but ſome of them were not there. Thus Auguſtine reporteth their words in the conference of the third day. Chapter 4. Quia &amp; in eo quod dicebant, &amp; diuinis testimonijs velut astruebant, non eſſe malos in eccleſia tolerandos, ſed ab eis recedendum propter contagium peccatorum: Itaſe dicere demonſtrabant, vt tamen ignoratis peccatis alienis neminem maculari poſſe faterentur. Becauſe euen in that which they ſaide, and which they did as it were confirme by the Scriptures, that the euil are not to be tolerate in the Church, but wee muſt depart from them for feare of the contagion of their ſins: they ſhewed that they ſpake it to be vnderſtoode thus, that neuertheleſſe they confeſſed, that no man could be ſpotted with other mens ſinnes which are ſecret.
                In this conference the Donatiſt Biſhops ſtoode vpon this, that the Lord ſaith of the Church Eſay. 52. There ſhall no vncircumciſed or vncleane paſſe through thee anie more. And vpō that which is writtē by the Prophet Hag chap. 2. Aſk the Preeſts concerning the Lawe. If a man carrie holie fleſh in the lappe of his garment, and the lappe of his garment ſhall touch the bread, &amp;c. Shall he bee ſanctified? The Prieſts anſwered, no. Then if a man that is vncleane touch any of thoſe things, ſhall it not bee vncleane? The Prieſtes anſwer, it ſhall bee vncleane. So is this people, and ſo is this Nation before me ſaith the Lord, and ſo is the whole work of their hands, yea that which they haue offered there, hath been vncleane. Stay now and ſee whether the very ſame Scriptures bee not in the mouthes of the common ſort of the Browniſts, and whether the writings of the chiefe Browniſts bee not euerie where ſpatred with the quotations of them. And to proue the ſame thing which the Donatiſts held, and maintained by them; namelie that ſuch as communicate with open ſinners are polluted by their ſinnes, and therefore they ſeparate themſelues? But that this agreement betweene them may yet more fully appeare, I will proceed further and ſhewe how theſe matters were diſcuſſed. For otherwiſe it maye bee, ſome man will imagine that

the auncient Fathers might defend the Churches againſt thoſe allegations of the Donatiſts after ſuch a ſort as wee canne not truly defende ours at this day. Whereas therefore it was by the Donatiſts vrged; depart, depart, come out from among them, ſeperate your ſelues, touch no vncleane thing, &amp;c. the anſwere was by the Paſtors of the Churches, that this ſeperation was not to bee made in bodie when the Church is peſtered with open ſinners, but in heart, and not conſenting in minde vnto the ſins openly committed by thoſe with whom they did communicate in the Church. Theſe be the wordes of Auguſtine againſt Parmenian, in the ſecond booke Chapt. 18. Qua verba isti carnaliter ſentientes, per tot diuiſiones ſeipſos minutatim in ipſa vna Aphrica conciderunt. Non enim intelligunt neminem coniungi cum infidelibus, niſi qui facit peccata Paganorum, vel talia facientibus fauet: Nec quenquam fieri participem iniquitatis, niſi qui iniqua vel agit vel approbat. Quis autem communicat tenebris, niſi qui per tenebras conſentionis ſuae, dimiſſo Christo ſequitur Belial? quis ponit cum infidelibus partem ſuam, niſi qui eius infidelitatis fit particeps? Ita enim templum dei eſſe deſinit, nec ſe aliter ſimulachris adiungit. Qui autem ſunt templum dei viui, &amp; in medio nationis tortuoſae ac peruerſae apparent ſicut luminaria in mundo verbum vitae habentes, nihil eos quod pro vnitate tolerant inficit, nec anguſtiantur. quia in illis habitat &amp; deambulat deus; &amp; exeunt de medio malorum, atque ſeparātur interim corde, ne forté cum id facere per ſeditionem Schiſmatis volūt, prius a bonis ſpiritualiter, quam a malis corporaliter ſeparentur. That is to ſay, which words they vndetſtanding carnally; (for he had before repeated their allegation, Come out from among them and touch no vncleane thing) they haue cut themſelues by morſels into ſo many diuiſiōs in that one Aphrica: for they doe not vnderſtand that no man is ioyned with Infidels, but he that doth commit the ſinnes of the Pagans, or elſe doth fauour thoſe that doe ſuch things: neither that any man can be made partaker of the iniquitie, but he that eyther doth the wicked things, or elſe doth approoue them.
               
               And who hath felowſhip with darknes, but he that by the darknes of his conſent forſaking Chriſt doth follow Belial? who putteth his part with infidels, but he which is partarker of that infidelitie? for that way he ceaſeth to be the tēple of God, neither otherwiſe dooth hee ioyne himſelfe to idols. And they which are the temple of the liuing God, and in the middeſt of a crooked and peruerſe generation appeare as lights in the world, hauing the word of life; nothing doth infecte them which they tolerate for vnities ſake, neither are they pent vp in anie ſtraight, becauſe God dooth dwell in them and walke in them And they depart out of the middeſt of the euill, and in the meane while are ſeperate, at leaſtwiſe in heart, leaſt perhaps while they would doo that by ſedition of Schiſme, they ſhould rather be ſpirituallie ſeparated from the good, than corporallie from the bad Thus farre Auguſtine, for ſeperation in heart when it cannot be in bodie. Againe he ſaith, anſwering Parmenian to this ſentence, bee not partaker of other mens ſinnes, chap. 20. Nos dicimus, quod qui non facit malum, nec facienti conſentit; &amp; facientem arguit, firmus atque integer inter iniquos tanquam frumentum inter paleas, conuerſatur. We ſay that he which dooth not commit euill, nor conſent to him that dooth, and rebuketh him that dooth, he is conuerſant firme and ſound among the wicked, as the corne among the chaffe. Now whereas the Donatiſts did replie that the ſeparation from the open ſinners which God commandeth could not be meant of a ſeparation onelie in heart and mind, for ſo we ought to be ſeparate from the heathen: with whom yet it was lawfull to eate, for S. Paul willeth If an infidell bid thee to a feaſt goe, but if anie that is called a brother bee a fornicator an idolater or couetous, with ſuch ſee that yee eate not: this muſt néedes be vnderſtood of a bodelie ſeparation, the Browniſts preſſing this Argument, alſo as the Donatiſts did, ſay we might eate common bread with infidels, yea at the ſame common table with ſuch vngodlie Chriſtians as Paul forbiddeth to eate with, and therefore the commandement of the Apoſtle they ſay is plaine, which

all men ought to obey, that if open ſinners come to the holy table of the Lorde, wee ought not there to eate with them. But let vs ſee the anſwer of Auguſtine in the third booke againſt Parmenian Chap. 3. His words in déede are manie, but I will ſet them downe, becauſe they be ſo full and pregnant to declare, wherein the controuerſie lay betweene the Donatiſts and the Churches, and why the Donatiſts made ſeparation. In hac velut angustia quaestionis, non aliquid nouum aut inſolitum dicam, ſed quod ſanitas obſeruat eccleſiae, vt cum quiſque fratrum, id eſt Chriſtianorum intus in eccleſiae ſocietate constitutorum, in aliquo tali peccato fuerit deprehenſus, vt anathemate dignus habeatur, fiat hoc vbi periculum Schiſmatis nullum est, atque id cum ea dilectione, de qua ipſe alibi praecipit dicens, vt inimicum eum non existimetis, ſed corripite vt fratrem, non enim estis ad eradicandum, ſed ad corrigendū: quod ſi ſe non agnouerit, neque poenitendo correxerit, ipſe for as exiet, &amp; per propriam voluntatem ab eccleſiae vnitate dirimetur. Nam &amp; ipſe dominus cùm ſeruis volentibus ZiZania colligere dixit, ſinete vtraque creſcere vſque ad meſſem: praemiſit cauſam dicens, ne forte cum vultis colligere Zizanea eradicetis ſimul &amp; triticum. Vbi ſatis ostendit, cum metus iste non ſubest, ſed omnino de frumentorum certa ſtabilitate, certa ſecuritas manet: id est quando ita cuiuſque crimen notum est omnibus, &amp; omnibus execrabile apparet, vt vel nullos prorſus, vel non tales habeat definſores, per quos poſſit ſchiſma contingere: non dormiat ſeueritas diſciplinae, in qua tantò est efficacior emendatio prauitatis, quantò diligentior confirmatio charitatis, tum autem hoc ſine labe pacis &amp; vnitatis, &amp; ſine laeſione frumentorum fieri potest, cùm congregationis eccleſiae multitudo ab eo crimine quod anathematizatur aliena est. Tunc enim adiuuat praepoſitum potius corripientem, quam criminoſum reſistentem: tunc ſe ab eius coniunctione ſalubriter continet, vt nec cibum cum eo quiſquam ſumat, non rabie inimica, ſed coertione fraterna. Tunc etiam ille &amp; timore percutitur &amp; pudore ſanatur, cum ab vniuerſa eccleſiaſc anathematizatum videns, ſociam turbam cum qua in delicto ſuo gaudeat, &amp; bonis inſultet non poteſt inuenire.
               
That is to ſay, As it were in this ſtraight of the queſtion. I will not ſpeake any thing that is new or vnwonted, but that which the ſoundnes of the Church dooth obſerue: that when anie of the Brethren, that is of the Chriſtians, which haue place within in the vnitie of the Church, be taken in ſome ſuch ſinne, that hee may bee accounted worthie to bee excommunicate; let it bee done where there is no danger of a Schiſme, and the ſame with that loue, of which hee commaundeth elſewhere, ſaying, eſteeme him not as an enemie, but admoniſh him as a Brother, for yee are not to roote vp, but to amend. If that hee ſhall not acknowledge himſelfe, neither reforme himſelfe by repentance, hee ſhall depart out, and by his owne will ſhall bee cut from the vnitie of the Church. For the Lord himſelfe, when he ſaide to the ſeruants, which would gather the tares, ſuffer both to grow together, ſhewed a cauſe, ſaying, least peraduenture while yee goe about to roote vp the tares, ye pluck vp alſo with them the wheate. Where hee dooth plainelie ſhew, that when there is no ſuch feare, but there remaineth a full ſecuritie of the vndoubted ſtabilitie of the corne; that is when the crime of any one is ſo knowne to all, and appeareth execrable vnto all, that either it can haue no defenders at all, or elſe not ſuch by whome there may a Schiſme fall out: let not the ſeueritie of diſcipline ſleepe, in which the curing of the diſeaſe is ſo much more effectuall, as the confirmation of loue is more diligent. Then alſo this may bee done without any blot of peace and vnitie, and without hurting the corne, when the multitude of the aſſemblie of the Church is free from that crime, for which the excommunication is denounced. For then they rather helpe the paſtor that dooth chaſtice, than the guiltie offendor which reſiſteth, then euerie man dooth healthfullie abſtaine from his fellowſhip, and not ſo much as eate meate with him, not of an enemie like mad rage, but of a brotherlie reprehenſion. Then hee alſo is ſtricken
               
               with feare, and healed through ſhame, when ſeeing himſelf excommunicate of the whole Church, cannot finde a multitude to bee of his fellowſhip with which hee may reioyce in his ſinne, and inſult ouer the good. Thus farre Auguſtine, which yee ſee expoundeth that place of Paul, with ſuch eate not, of thoſe that be excommunicate iuſtlie by the Church, ſhewing that this excommunication cannot be executed when ſuch a multitude doo ſinne that it would bréede a Schiſme, if they ſhould be all caſt foorth and ſo pluck vp the wheate: ſéeing as he ſheweth this cenſure is ordained as a remedie to heale, and not to pluck vp and deſtroy. This point peraduenture will ſeeme ſtrange vnto many, that the ſeueritie of the diſcipline ſhould ceaſe as it were when it is a multitude that dooth offend: and leaſt it may be thought not to be his meaning and as he ſpeaketh, that which the ſoundnes of the Church did obſerue, I will ſhew how he proceedeth further in his anſwer. Neque enim potest eſſe ſalubris a multis correptio, niſi cum ille corripitur, qui non habet ſociam multitudinem, cum verò idem morbus plurimos occupauerit nihil aliud bonis restat quam dolor &amp; gemitus, vt perillud ſignum quod Ezechieli ſancto reuelatur illae ſi euadere ab illor
                     •
                  m vastatione mereantur. For neither can that reprehenſion by manie (ſaith hee) bee for health, but when he is reprehended, which hath not the multitude his companion. But when the ſame ſicknes hath taken hold of verie manie, there remaineth nothing elſe to the good, but ſorrowe and bewailing, that through that ſigne which is reuealed vnto holie Ezechiel, they may deſerue to eſcape vnhurt and free from the deſtruction of thoſe wicked.
               
            
            When Auguſtine hath vttered this, a little after he bringeth in Paule himſelfe for example in his practiſe: for he willed them to excommunicate the inceſtuous perſon, and he that had willed not to eate bread with a brother ſo called that were a fornicator, doth not will them to caſt them foorth, and not to eate bread with them whom he complaineth of: 2. Epiſtle 12. that had not repented for the vncleannes, and

fornication and wantonnes which they had committed: for theſe he ſaith were many: and therefore that S. Paule doth not threaten that whē he came he would caſt them foorth, but he would, as he ſaith, bewaile them. The like we ſee in thoſe that denied the reſurrection, he willed them not to caſt theſe foorth, leaſt a ſchiſme might growe thereupon. After this he addeth, Et re vera ſi contagio peccandi multitudinem inuaſerit, diuina diſciplinae ſeuera miſericordia neceſſaria eſt: nam conſilia ſeparationis, &amp; inania ſunt &amp; pernicioſa atque ſacrilega, quia &amp; impia &amp; ſuperbafiunt, &amp; plus perturbant infirmos bonos, quam corrigant animoſos malos. That is: And in verie deede if the contagion of ſinning hath inuaded the multitude, the ſeuere mercie of diuine diſcipline is neceſſarie: for the counſell or enterpriſes of ſeparation are both vaine and pernicious, yea ſacrilegious, becauſe they become both wicked and proude, and doo more trouble the good which are weake, than chaſtice the ſturdie ones which are euill. What can bee more vehementlie thundred out againſt the Donatiſts than this? and yet the Browniſts which are the ſame in their ſchiſme, may not bee ſpoken ſharply vnto. Then a little after Auguſtine doth as it were conclude in this poynt: Miſericorditer igitur corripiat homo quod poteſt: quod autem non poteſt patienter ferat, &amp; cum dilectione gemat atque lugeat, donec aut ille deſuper emendet &amp; corrigat, aut vſque ad meſsem differat eradicare zizania, &amp; paleam ventilare. Let a man therefore with mercie correct that which he can: and that which he cannot, let him beare with patience, and with loue let him mourne and lament, vntill he from aboue doo either redreſſe and amend, or elſe differre vntill the harueſt to roote out the tares, and to winnowe out the chaffe.
                Here he alleageth the example of that holie Martyr Cyprian which had béen Biſhop of Carthage, who deſcribing the multitude to bee ſo full of groſſe ſinnes, yea verie many of his fellow Biſhops ſpotted with very foule crimes, yet he communicated with them, though not in their ſinnes, which he did euermore reprehend, but in the Sacraments

and holie worſhip of God. Furthermore, anſwering to the ſentence alleaged by the Donatiſt out of Ieremie, what hath the chaffe to doo with the corne? He ſaith among all things the Donatiſts in this did bewray their ſacrilegious ſwelling pride. For though being demaunded they would confeſſe themſelues to be ſinners; yet in this they did not onely challenge to be the true Church alone, but alſo ſuch as the holie Church ſhall be after the laſt winnowing. Cui ſacrilegae praeſumptioni &amp; nephandae elationi, quid addi poſſit ignoro. That is, To which ſacrilegious preſumption and curſed abominable ſwelling, I knowe not what can be added. Reade the bookes of Browne and the writings of other Browniſts, and ye ſhall euer and anon finde great outcries, as they charge vs, againſt our wicked tollerating. If it were ſwelling pride in the Donatiſts that cauſed them to denie any tollerating, what is it in the Browniſts? But to proceede yet further, in the third booke againſt Creſconius, Chapter 50. hee ſaith: Haec omnia diſplicent bonis, &amp; ea prohibent, &amp; cohibent quā
                  tum poſſunt, quantum autem non poſſunt ferunt, &amp; ſicut dixi, pro pace laudabiliter tolerant, non ea laudabilia, ſed damnabilia iudicantes: nec propter zizania ſegitem Chriſti, nec propter paleas aream Chriſti, nec propter vaſa inhonorata domum magnam Chriſti, nec propter piſces malos retia Chriſti derelinquunt. That is to ſay, Al theſe things diſpleaſe the good, and they forbid them and reſtraine them as much as they can, and as much as they cannot reſtraine, they beare: and as I haue ſaide, they tolerate laudablie for peace ſake, not iudging the thinges laudable but damnable: neither doo they forſake the corne of Chriſt for the tares, nor the fl

               of Chriſt becauſe of the chaffe, nor the great houſe of Chriſt becauſe of the veſſells for diſhonour, nor the nettes of Chriſt for the euill fiſhes. I haue ſhewed alreadie, that the Donatiſt Biſhops when they were by the commandement of the Emperour aſſembled in great number at Carthage, that there might bee a conference; declared this to bee their mind: when they affirme that the good are polluted and caſt away by communicating with the bad, that it is when

the ſinnes are manifeſt. Now I thinke it is not amiſſe to ſhewe ſomewhat of their diſputation, that the things which I alleage touching their opinions, may not ſeeme to be from ſome fewe, which peraduenture might differ from others. Looke in the conference of the third day, Chapt. 4. The Biſhops of the true Church to prooue that there ſhould be open wicked ſinners in the Church mingled together with the good vnto the end of the world, alleaged firſt that the Church is called Chriſtes flower where the corne and the chaffe are mixed together, but he hath his fanne, and will purge his flower, and gather the corne into his barne, and burne the chaffe with vnquenchable fire. Matth. 3. The Donatiſts at the firſt raſhlie replie, that there was not the word flower expreſſed in the Scripture: but when they were conuinced manifeſtlie in that, then they ſay the chaffe did ſignifie the hypocrites and cloſe ſinners: as though the chaffe did ſo reſemble the corne, that it could not be diſcerned. Then next was alleaged the parable of the good ſeede and the bad, and that the ſeruants were forbidden to plucke vp the tares, leaſt they ſhould in plucking vp the tares, plucke vp alſo together with them the wheate, but they are willed to let them grow together vnto the harueſt. Matth. 13. Now becauſe it is expreſly ſaid that the Tares appeared or ſhewed themſelues and that the ſeruants did diſcerne them, ſo ye it cannot be taken alone of cloſe ſinners: The Donatiſts did flie vnto ye Cauil, that the field is not ye church, becauſe he ſaith, the field is this world. And ſo they ſtood vpon this, that ye godly &amp; open ſinners are together in ye world, but not in the Church: For they did alleage many teſtimonies to ſhew that the world is taken for the wicked. It was replied by the Catholike Biſhops, yt the world was ſometimes put in good part, as whē it is ſaid, God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelfe: And indéed, if it were not taken to be the Church, &amp; that the gdooſeede &amp; the bad in the field, were together in the Church, howe ſhoulde the ſeruants haue a deſire to pluck them vp? what had they to doe to meddle with ſuch as were without▪ or why ſhould there be danger in rooting them vp, leaſt they

ſhould together roote vp the wheat? Then further when it was ſaid that our ſauiour compareth the kingdome of heauen vnto a Net caſt into the ſea, which gathereth together of all ſorts both good bad and, which when it is ful men draw to land, &amp; gather the good into veſſells, &amp; caſt the bad away. Math. 13. The Donatiſts to this ſaid that the euill fiſhes did ſignifie cloſe hypocrites, and ſuch ſinners as could not be eſpied. Victi euidentia veritatis malos in eccleſia vſ

That is, Being ouercome with euidence of truth, they confeſſed that the euill are mixed in the Church euē to the end of the world, but they ſaid they are ſecret becauſe they are vnknowen of the Paſtors, euen as the fiſhes within the nettes, while they are yet in the Sea are not ſcene of the fiſhers. But if the Donatiſts had beene aſked whether the fiſhes together in the Net doe not ſee one another, what would they ſay? Howe then are they ſecret, and not ſeene of the Paſtors, who are alſo together with thē in the Net▪ For they did erre in taking the Paſtors to bee the fiſhers that ſhall draw the N

               t to the ſhoare. For expounding it, ou Sauiour ſaith: The Angells ſhall goe foorth, and ſeperate the euill from among the iuſt. The Angels then are they that draw the Net to the ſhoare. Were thoſe vngodly ſinners ſecret as fiſhes vnder the water which the Prophets complained of in olde time, and yet did not in bodie ſeperate themſelues from them in the Temple▪ The like may be demanded touching the Phariſies and Saduces, and the multitude of common people in the Church, from whom our Sauiour did not ſeperate himſelfe in bodie. But the Donatiſts were impudent in denying that the Prophets and the other godly did worſhip together in the temple, and at the ſame Altare with the wicked multitude whom they ſo ſharply reprehended.
            Now may the reader ſee what the Donatiſts maintained, and wherefore they ſeperated themſelues: which I will expreſſe

in the wordes of Auguſtine in his third booke againſt Creſconius Chapt. 81. Ibi enim tota defenſi
                     •
                   vestra conſistit, quia propterea vos ſeparaſtis, ne aliorum peccatorum contagione periretis: vndenouum genus areae vos ſeciſſe gloriamini, aut quae ſolum triticum habeat, aut in qua ſolum triticum appareat, cui non ſit neceſsarius ventilator, ſed perſcrutator. That is For therein doth your whole defence conſiſt, that therefore ye haue ſeparate your ſelues, that ye might not periſh by the contagion of other mens ſinnes: wherevpon ye glorie that ye haue made a new kinde of floare, which either hath in it only wheat, or elſe in which there appeareth wheat alone which needeth not a winnower, but a ſearcher. The Donatiſts alleaging againſt the Churches for the open ſinners mixed among them ye ſaying of Eſay, wo be to thē that cal euill good and good euill, light darkenes, and darkenes light, &amp;c. Auguſtine anſwereth, Quiſques ergo vel quod poteſt arguendo corrigit, vel quod corrigere non poteſt, ſaluo pacis vinculo excludit, vel quod ſaluo pacis vinculo excludere non potest, aequitate improbat, firmitate ſupportat, hic est pacificus &amp; abiſto maledicto immunis quod ſcriptura dicit, va his qui dicunt quod nequam est bonu, &amp;c, Whoſoeuer therefore dooth either amend that which hee can by reprouing, or that which he cannot amend, he caſteth forth, the band of peace being kept ſafe, or that which he cannot caſt out with the ſafetie of the band of peace, by equitie hee diſaloweth, and beareth it with conſtancie: this man is the peacemaker, and is free from that curſe which the Scripture pronounceth, Woe be to them which cal euill good, &amp;c.
                Againſt Parmenian booke 2. chap. 1. The Donatiſts alleaging the ſentences of the Prophets to proue that all ought to ſeparate themſelues from thoſe, among whome the open notorious wicked men were ſuffered, and not caſt foorth: he anſwereth that they cited the teſtimonies of Scripture, and did not looke vpon the déeds of the Prophets, and ſo to know how the words of the Prophets were to be vnderſtand. Then hee demaundeth, Dixit Ieremias quid paleis ad triticum? Ʋt ipſe recederet a paleis upopli ſui, in
               
               quas illa tanta &amp; vera dicebat? Did Ieremie ſay what hath the chaffe to doo with the corne, for this end, that he himſelfe ſhould depart from the chaffe of his people, againſt which hee did vtter thoſe ſo great things, and the ſame moſt true? Dixit Ieſaias, Recedite, recedite, exite inde, &amp; immundum nolite tangere. Sed cur ipſe in illo populo immunditiam quam grauiter arguebat, in vna cum eis congregatione tangebat? Legant quanta in malos populi ſui, &amp; quam vehementer ac veraciter dixerit, a quibus ſe tamen nulla corporali diremptione ſeparauerit. That is, Eſay ſaide, Depart, depart, come out from thence, and touch not that which is vncleane. But whie did hee himſelfe in one congregation with them, touch that vncleannes which hee reprooued in that people? They may read how great things hee vttered againſt the wicked of his people, how vehementlie and trulie, from whome notwithſtanding hee did ſeparate himſelfe with no bodelie ſeparation.
                After he hath ſhwed the like in the holie Prophet Dauid who profeſſed hee had not ſit in the counſell of vaine men, and yet was not ſeparate in bodie from the vngodlie in his dayes: He addeth Nonne, ſi eorum verba factis eorum obijceremus responderent nobis, nos planè cum talibus nullum habuimus in corde conſortium, nec tangebamus immundum vbi potest coinquinari contactus: id est conſenſione at que placito conſcientiae recedebamus, &amp; exibamus ab eis, qui non ſolùm talia non faciebamus, ſed nec facientibus tacebamus. If we ſhould obiect their words againſt their deedes, would they not anſwer vs, wee haue had vtterlie no fellowſhip in heart with ſuch wicked men, neither did we touch that which is vncleane, where the touching may be defiled: That is to ſay, wee did depart and come out from them in conſent and likening of conſcience, which our ſelues, not onelie, did not doo ſuch things, but alſo kept not ſilence to them that did ſuch wickednes.
                Againſt Parmenian booke 3. chap. 4. Again, in the ſame place he addeth. Poſtremò ſi Prophetae poſteros monuerunt vt ſe ante tempus vltimae ventilationis a paleis corporaliter ſepararent, &amp; tali ſeparatione
               
               cauerent tangere immundum, &amp; cum facinoroſis non introirent, cur hoc non fecit Apostolus Paulus? An palea nō erant, qui non ex veritate, ſed ex inuidia Christum annunciabant? An immundi non erant, qui non caſtè euangelium praedicarunt? Hos in illis temporibus eccleſia fuiſſe testatur, cuius excellentiſſimam charitatem omnia tolerantem, etiam posteriores imitati ſunt. That is, Laſtlie if the Prophets gaue warning to the poſteritie that they ſhould before the time of the laſt winnowing ſeparate themſelues from the chaffe in bodie, and by ſuch ſeparation take heede of touching any vncleane thing, and that way not to enter with the wicked dooers, whie did not the Apoſtle Paul doo ſo? Were not they chaffe which preached Chriſt of enuie, and not for the trueth? Were not they vncleane, which preached the Goſpell not purelie? That there were ſuch in the Church at thoſe times hee dooth teſtifie Philip▪ 1. Whoſe moſt excellent charitie induring or tolerating all things, thoſe that ſuceeded haue alſo imitated. Hauing thus affirmed, that this moſt excellent loue of Paul tolerating open wicked men in the church where they could not without danger of ſchiſme be caſt foorth was imitated of the godlie paſtors that ſuccéeded: he alleageth for example holie Cyprian: who teſtifying that not onelie the people, but alſo manie of his fellowe Biſhoppes were horriblie wicked, yet liued in peace with them, and did not ſeparate himſelfe in bodie. Thus hee demaundeth, An immunditia, an etiam auaritia, quam Cyprianus corde non tetigit, &amp; tamen inter auaros collegas pacatiſſſimè vixit? Was it not vncleannes, was it not alſo couetouſnes, which Cyprian touched not in heart, and yet liued moſt peaceablie among his couetous fellowe Biſhops?
                He knew right well what God commaundeth in the Pſalme, that hee ſhould not ſit in the counſell of vaine men, nor enter with the wicked dooers. An non erat conuenticulum vanitatis in eis, qui eſurientibus in eccleſia fratribus, largiſſimo argento nitere cupiebant? An non erant facinoroſi qui fuundos inſidiosè fratribus rapiebant? An
               
               nequiſſimi &amp; impij non erant qui vſuris multiplicantibus foenus augebant? Ille vero, lauabat manus ſuas cum innocentibus &amp; circundabat altare domini. Ideo quippe tolerabat nocentes, ne deſer
                     •
                  ret innocentes cum quibus manus lauabat, quia diligebat ſpeci
                     •
                  m domus domini, quae ſpecies in vaſis honorabilibus fuit. That is, Was not the conuenticle of vanitie among them, which while their brethren indured hunger or penurie in the Church, did couet to ſhine gorgeouſlie with moſt aboundant wealth? Were not they wicked dooers, which by deceiptfull meanes in ſuch rauening ſort tooke from their brethren poſſeſsions of Lands? Were they not moſt vngodlie and wicked, which with multiplying vſurie did increaſe their gaine? But Cyprian did waſh his hands with innocents, and compaſſed the Altar of the Lord. He tolerated the wicked, leaſt he ſhould forſake thoſe innocent, with whom hee waſhed his hands, becauſe hee loued the beautie of the Lords houſe, which beautie was in the veſſels for honour. Now where the Donatiſts might obiect, ſhall the diſcipline then be neglected, and wicked men ſuffered to liue at their pleaſure in the Church? Auguſtine anſwereth both them and all others touching this obiection, firſt in his third booke againſt Parmenian chap. 1. Quapropter quiſquis etiam contempſerit eccleſiae Dei diſciplinam vt malos cum quibus non peccat, &amp; quibus non fauet, deſistat monere, corrigere, arguere: ſi etiam talem gerit perſonam, &amp; pax eccleſiae patitur, vt etiam à ſacramentorum participatione quem piam poſſit ſeparare, non alieno malo peccat ſed ſuo, ipſa quippe in tanta re negligentia graue malum est, &amp; ideò ſicut Apoſtolus admonet, ſi auferet malū a ſeipſo, non ſolum aufirre
                     •
                   audaciam committendi, aut pestilentiam conſentiendi, ſed etiam pigritiam corrigendi, &amp; negligentiam vindicandi adhibita prudentia &amp; obedientia in eo quod praecepit dominus, ne frumenta laedantur. That is to ſay, Wherfore, whoſoeuer alſo ſhall deſpiſe the diſcipline of Gods Church, ſo that he giue ouer admoniſhing, correcting, and reprouing the euill men with whome hee dooth not ſinne, and
               
               whome he dooth not fauour, yea if he beare ſuch office, and the peace of the Church permit, that hee may alſo ſeparate any from the participation of the Sacraments, and dooth not, he ſinneth by his owne falt and not by the falt of another. For the verie negligence it ſelfe in ſo great a matter is a grieuous ſinne, and therefore as the Apoſtle dooth warne. If he will take away euil from himſelfe, hee muſt not onelie take away the boldnes of committing it, or the peſtilence of conſenting thereto, but alſo the ſlouthfulnes of correcting and negligence of reuenging the ſame, prudentlie obeying in that which the Lorde hath commaunded, that the wheate may not be hurt.
            
            In his third booke againſt Petilian, Chapt. 4. hauing before ſhewed that there is a worthie patience in ſuffering the falſe brethren for the vnities ſake: he addeth, Neque hoc ideo dixerim vt negligatur eccleſiastica diſciplina, &amp; permittatur quiſque facere quod velit ſine vlla correptione &amp; quadam medicinali vindicta▪ &amp; terribili lenitate, &amp; charitatis ſeueritate. That is, Neither haue I therefore ſayd this, that the eccleſiaſticall diſcipline ſhould be neglected, and that euery one ſhould be ſuffered to do what he will without rebuke, and without a certaine medicinable reuenge, terrible lenittie, and ſeueritie of loue. In the 37. Chap. of the ſame booke, hauing ſpoken of the corne and the chaffe mixed together, the wheate and the tares growing together, the good fiſhes and the had in the ſame nette together vnto the end of the world, he then inferreth: Nec propterea tamen eccleſiastica diſciplina negligitur à constantibus, &amp; diligentibus, &amp; prudentibus dispenſatoribus Chriſti, vbi crimina ita manifeſt antur, vt nulla poſſint probabili ratione defendi. That is, Notwithſtanding the eccleſiaſticall diſcipline is not therefore neglected of the conſtant, diligent and wiſe diſpenſers of Chriſt, where the crimes are manifeſted in ſuch ſort that they can in no probable maner be defended. In the fourth Chapter of his booke after the conference with the Donatiſts, taking aduantage of a ſaying which they vttered, which

was this: Nec cauſae cauſa praeiudicat, nec perſonae perſona. That is, neither doth cauſe preiudicate cauſe, neither one perſon another. Hee ſaith that the cauſe and perſon of the tares doth not preiudicate the cauſe and perſon of the wheat growing together in the ſame field vntill the harueſt come: The cauſe and perſon of the chaffe doth not preiudicate the cauſe and perſon of the corne, beeing together in the ſame floare vntill the laſt winnowing: The cauſe and perſon of the goates, doth not preiudicate the cauſe and perſon of the ſheepe, kept together in the ſame paſtures, vntill the great ſhepheard ſhall ſeparate them to the right hand and to the left in the laſt day: The cauſe and perſon of the euill fiſhes doth not preiudicate the cauſe and perſon of the good fiſhes, though they bee held in the ſame nette to be ſeparated in the laſt ſhoare. Then he addeth, Quibus parabolis, &amp; figuris eccleſia praenunciata eſt vſque in finem ſeculi bonos &amp; malos ſimul habitura, ita vt nec mali bonis obeſſe poſſint, cum velignorantur, vel pro pace &amp; tranquillitate eccleſiae tolerantur, ſi eos prodi aut a
                     •
                  cuſari non oportuerit, aut alijs bonis non potuerit demonſtrari: ita ſanè vt nec emendationis vigilantia quieſcat, corripiendo, degradando, excommunicando, caeteriſque coertionibus licitis atque conceſſis, quae ſalua vnitatis pace in eccleſia quotidie fiunt ſecundum praeceptum Apostolicum charitate ſeruata qui dixit, ſi quis autem non obaudit verbo nostro, per epistolam hunc notate, &amp; nolite commiſceri cum eo, vt erubeſcat, &amp; non vt inimicum existimetis, ſed corripite vt fratrem. Sic enim &amp; diſciplina ſeruat patientiam, &amp; patientia temperat diſciplinam, &amp; vtrumque refertur ad charitatem, ne fortè aut indiſciplinata patientia foueat iniquitatem, aut impatiens diſciplina diſſipet vnitatem. That is to ſay, By which parables and figures, the Church is foreſhewed that it ſhall haue the good and the bad together vnto the ende of the world, ſo as the euil cannot hurt the good, when either they are not knowne, or elſe are tolerated for the peace and tranquilitie of the Church, if it be not behoueful that they ſhal be manifeſted or accuſed, or that it cannot be ſhewed to others that be good: euen ſo verelie as yet the watchfulneſſe
               
               of redreſsing may in no wiſe reſt, in rebuking, degrading, excommunicating, and in other lawfull and allowable reſtraints, which, the peace of vnitie receiuing no dammage, are daylie practiſed in the Church without any hindrance or breach of loue, according to the Apoſtles precept, which ſayd: If any obey not our word, note him by an Epistle, and haue no fellowſhip with him, that he may bee aſhamed, and eſteeme him not as an enemie, but admoniſh him as a brother. For in ſo doing, the diſcipline doth keepe patience, and patience doth temper the diſcipline, and both are referred vnto charitie, leaſt either vndiſciplined patience ſhould foſter iniquitie, or impatient diſcipline, might diſſolue and ſcatter the vnitie.
            
            Thus farre Auguſtine: by which words he ſheweth, that albeit the good and the bad ſhall alwaies euen to the end of the world bee mixed together on heapes in the Church, ſo that oftentimes open ſinners cannot bee all caſt foorth without daunger of ſchiſme, and therefore are to be tollerated for the peace of the Church: yet the diſcipline is not to ſleepe, but ſinners are to bee rebuked: ſuch as beare publike office, if they deſerue, are to be degraded and depriued. The notorious wicked are to bee excommunicated, where the multitude is not guiltie with them, but that they may be forſaken of all and ſo made aſhamed: but loue, according to the rule of Saint Paule, is to ſit at the ſtearne and to order the whole matter, leaſt the ſeueritie of chaſticing diſcipline, if it were not mixed and tempered, or as I may ſay, delaied with patience, might breed tumults and ſchiſmes, and ſeparations: or leaſt on the other ſide, if tollerating patience were not ſharpened by the ſeueritie of diſcipline, it might nouriſh all manner of wickednes.
            We ſee then what was the practiſe of the auncient Churches, and that touching the Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, the mixture of patience and ſeueritie, whollie referred vnto loue, doo make a ſoueraigne plaiſter and medicine, to ſalue and cure the ſores of the Church. Where theſe be not tempered together there is great decay: for as the rigorous ſeueritie of

               Donatiſme, without any aſwaging the heate of ſeueritie with the mixture of loue and patient tolleration, doth rend vp and furiouſlie teare all in peeces: ſo doth ouermuch or a looſe ſufferance (for it deſerueth not the name of patience, not regarding Gods honor nor mens ſaluation) ſuffer the Lords field to ouergrowe with tares, and fill the Lords Courts with Goates and Swine: whereby holie things are greatlie prophaned, the weake are made to ſtumble, and many are caſt downe. Touching this firſt point then in controuerſie betwéene the Donatiſts and the Churches, I will conclude it with that which Auguſtine writeth in his treatiſe De vnitate Eccleſiae, Chapt. 16. where hauing ſhewed in the former parts of the ſame booke that the controuerſie was not about the head, which is Chriſt, but about the bodie, which is his Church. For touching the head they agreed, and touching the bookes of holie Scripture and their authoritie, there was no diſſent at all betweene the Donatiſts and them.
            Then further he commeth to this poynt, that as Chriſt the head is to bee ſought for and knowne onlie in the Canonicall Scriptures: ſo the Church, which is his bodie, is likewiſe to be ſought for, found out, and iudged onely by the ſame bookes of Scripture. Then he calleth for triall not by thoſe darke places of the Byble which are ſpoken in figures and may be expounded diuers waies in probable ſenſe; but from the manifeſt cléere teſtimonies, which alſo he alleageth out of many bookes both of the old and newe Teſtament, to prooue that the Church ſhould bee ſpread ouer all the kingdomes and nations of the world. He anſwereth the places of Scriptures which they alleaged to prooue that the world at ſundrie times had ſo fallen away from God, that a verie fewe true worſhippers remained, and why might not they be now as thoſe fewe? He ſheweth that there be innumerable teſtimonies to prooue, that the open bad did communicate together with the good in the Sacraments, and that the good were fewe in compariſon of the bad ſo mixed with them, of which (after he hath cited many) he commeth at the

laſt as it were to a concluſion, that al other things remooued, hee would haue them ſhewe their Church out of the holie Scriptures, and from the places which are not darke. And then it followeth, Quiſquis ergo huic epistolae reſpondereſe praeparat, ante denunciationem mihi dicat, illi codices dominicos ignibus tradiderunt, illi ſimulacris gentium ſacrificauerūt, illi nobis iniquiſſimam perſecutionem fecerunt, et vos eis in omnibus conſenſiſtis. Breuiter enim reſpondeo quod ſaepè reſpondi, aut falſa dicitis, aut ſi vera ſunt, non ad frumenta Christi, ſed ad eorum paleam pertinent ista quae dicitis, non inde perit eccleſia, quae optimo iudicio ventilata, istorum omnium ſeparatione purgabitur. That is to ſay, Whoſoeuer therefore prepareth himſelfe to anſwere this Epiſtle, let him before the denouncing, ſay vnto me; ſuch deliuered the Lords bookes to the fire, ſuch ſacrificed to the Idols of the Gentiles, ſuch haue perſecuted vs moſt vniuſtlie, and you haue conſented vnto them in all things. For I anſwer brieflie, which I haue often anſwered, either ye ſpeake things which are falſe, or elſe if they bee true, that which ye ſpeake pertaineth not to the corne of Chriſt but to the chaffe thereof, the Church doth not periſh thereby, which winnowed with moſt perfect iudgement, ſhall bee purged by the ſeparation of that ſame chaffe. He addeth: Ego ipſam eccleſiā requiro vbi ſit, quae audiendo verba Christi &amp; faciendo aedificat ſuper petram, &amp; audiendo &amp; faciendo tolerat eos, qui audiendo &amp; non faciendo aedificant ſuper arenam. Ʋbi ſit triticum quod inter zizania creſcit vſque ad meſſem, non quid fecerint vel faciant ipſa zizania. Vbi ſit proxima Christi in medio filiarum malarum, ſicut lilium in medio ſpinarum non quid fecerint, vel faciunt ipſae ſpinae. Vbi ſunt piſces boni qui donec ad littus perueniant, tolerant piſces malos pariter irretitos, non fecerint aut faciant ipſi piſces mali. That is to ſay, I ſeeke the Church, where ſhe is, which in hearing the words of Chriſt and doing them doth build vpon a rocke, and which hearing and doing doth tolerate thoſe, which hearing and not dooing doo build vppon the ſand. Where that wheate is which groweth vp among the tares vntill the harueſt come, not
               
               what the tares haue done, or what they doo. Where that ſpouſe of Chriſt is in the middeſt of the euill daughters, as the lillie among the thornes, not what the thornes haue done, or what they doo. Where the good fiſhes be, which vntill they come vnto the ſhore doo tolerate the euill fiſhes held in the ſame nette together, not what the euill fiſhes haue done, or what they doo.
            
            Thus haue I laide open, that the Church in olde time was full of open wicked men both of miniſters and people: That the Donatiſts vnder the colour of zeale and ſeueritie againſt ſinne did ſeparate themſelues, affirming that all were polluted and fallen from the couenant, which did communicate in the worſhip of god and Sacraments with ſuch notorious euill men. All men may ſee by that which I haue noted, that the Donatiſts did maintaine this their opinion with the ſame Scriptures and argumēts that the Browniſts doe maintaine it withall nowe: And receiued the ſame anſwers to confute them, which we make nowe to confute the Browniſts. This was the maine point of Donatiſme, and as it were the pith &amp; ſubſtance therof: &amp; it is one of the foure chiefe pillers of Browniſme, Yea but now the Browniſts doe ſeparate themſelues from a worſhip which is Idolatrous, full of blaſphemies and abhominations: The Donatiſts did rend themſelues from an holy and true worſhip. Indeede where the worſhip is Idolatrous and blaſphemous, a man is to ſeparate himſelfe. But there are many and great corruptions before it come to that: for it is the true worſhip of God where the foundation is layd and ſtandeth ſure. If there be timber, Hay, and ſtubble built vpon the foundation, the fault is great, ſuch things are not to bee approued: But yet there is Gods true worſhip. And now to come to the verie poynt of the matter: I doe affirme &amp; wil ſtand to iuſtifie, that there were greater corruptions in the worſhip of God, euen in thoſe Churches from which the Donatiſts did ſeperate themſelues, than be at this day in the worſhip of the Church of England. So that if Browniſme be any thing to be excuſed in that, the Donatiſme may as iuſtly therein be defended.

For if wee conſider matters which concerne doctrine, what can any man ſhew ſo corrupt in this our Church, as in the publike worſhip to pray for the ſoules of the dead, and to offer oblations for the dead? This corruption was generall in the Church then, yea long before the dayes of Auguſtine, as it appeareth in Cyprian and by Tertullian which was before him, and nerer to the time of the Apoſtles; who in his booke De Monogamia reaſoning againſt ſecond mariage (for hee was fallen into that error) woulde perſwade any woman that had buried her huſband not to marie againe, becauſe, he being ſeperated from her in peace &amp; not diuorced, ſhe was to pray for his ſoule, and yearely to offer oblation for him: thus he writeth, Et pro anima eius oret, &amp; refrigerium interim ad poſtulet ei, &amp; in prima reſurrectione conſortium: &amp; offerat annuis diebus dormitionis eius. That is, And let her pray for his ſoule, and craue refreſhing for him nowe in the meane time, and his felowſhip in the firſt reſurrection, and let her offer yearely vpon the day of his departure. It will bee ſaid by ſome ignorant man, that this was but the minde and practiſe of ſome few, which were corrupt and ſuperſtitious. I anſwere it was the practiſe of the Church in generall, and the corruption ſo auncient, that the ſame Tertullian in his booke De corona militis, ſpeaking of it &amp; certain other things ſaith they were obſerued by tradition from the Apoſtles, they were obſerued ſo generally in the Churches and no ſcripture to warrant them. Theſe bee his wordes, Oblationes pro defunctis, annua die facimus. Wee make oblations for the dead in the yeerely day.
                The doctrine of Purgatory, and the doctrine of Free will were crept in alſo, beſides diuers other groſſe errors which ſundrie of the chiefe teachers held, ſome in one poynt ſome in an other. Touching Ceremonies not for order and comlynes, but with ſignification, the libertie was exceeding which men tooke, and the corruption greeuous, which was not eſpied but of few. Tertullian for his time nameth theſe, which he ſaith were receiued by tradition and had no ſcripture to warrant them. firſt in baptiſme hauing ſhewed what they profeſſed, and the thrée

times dipping into the water, hee addeth, Inde ſuſcepti lactis &amp; mellis concordiam praguſtamus. Exque ea die lauacro quotidiano per totam hebdomadam abſtinemus. That is Taken from thence (hee meaneth from the water wee firſt taſte the concord of milke and hony, and from that day we abſtaine from the dayly waſhing a whole weeke. Die dominico ieiunium nefas ducimus, vel de geniculis adorare: Eadem immunitate a die paſchae in Penticoſtem vſque gaudemus.
                That is, We account it an heynous matter to faſt on the Lords day, or to worſhip vpon the knees: by the ſame freedome, from Eaſter vnto Penticoſt we reioyce. And by and by after hee ſaith, Ad omnem progreſſum atque promotum, ad omnem aditum, &amp; exitū, ad veſtitū, ad calciamentū, ad lauacra, ad mē
                  ſas, ad lumina, ad cubilia, ad ſedilia, quacunque nos conuerſatio exercet, frontem crucis ſignaculo terimus. That is, At euerie ſetting forward and mouing, at euerie comming to, or going foorth, at our appareling, and putting on our ſhooes, at waſhing at table, at lighting the candle, at bed, at ſitting, whatſoeuer wee are buſied about, we weare our forehead with the ſigne of the Croſſe. Theſe ſuperſtitious obſeruations were crept into the Church, and in the daies of Tertullian who liued not much more than two hundreth yeares after our Sauiour Chriſt, receaued ſo generallie, that hee ſaieth they were by tradition from the Apoſtles. Auguſtine vnto Ianuarius complaineth that there was ſuch a multitude of rites or ceremonies in the Church. But what ſhould I labour in this point? If the Browniſts will affirme that there be as great corruptions in the worſhip of the Church of England, if we reſpect either doctrine or ceremonies, as were in the Churches from which the Donatiſts did ſeparate themſelues, they ſhall be conuinced of groſſe ignorance. And if they ſtand in it, they ſhall ſhew themſelues ſhameles: let the reader in the meane time but looke vpon the Epiſtle of Maſter Beza before the new Teſtament, and ſee what he affirmeth in this matter, how corrupt the Churches were. Then I conclude that the Donatiſts ſeparating themſelues from Churches more corrupt than the Churche of

               England in the worſhip of God, as I dare ſtand to maintaine againſt them: if they denie it, may as well bee excuſed as the Browniſts, and ſo hetherto they bee euen bretheren with them, or their naturall Children, no difference to bee found at all. And now touching the third and fourth pillars of Browniſme; the Donatiſts cried out that the Churches had no true Miniſters, but that they were all falſe Prophets, Iudaſſes, perſecutors of the iuſt, generations of Traitors, becauſe as they ſaide they had their ordination from thoſe that were ſuch. The Browniſts with all their might lift vp their voices, and call vs Baals Prieſts, the marked ſeruants of Antichriſt, falſe Prophets, ſeducers and ſuch like, becauſe, as they ſay, we are ordeined by Antichriſtian Biſhops, which exerciſe a Diſcipline contrarie to the Diſcipline of Chriſt. Here wee haue to conſider of two things at once the Miniſters and the Diſcipline: let vs firſt ſee what the Donatiſts held againſt the Miniſters. This was the common voice among the Donatiſts, O that matters might be diſputed, diſcuſſed, and ſcanned. But when by the commandement of the Emperour, the conference ſhould bee holden what miſerable ſhiftes and delayes did they finde out? And in the conference of the third day, Chapt. 2. It is ſhewed that the Donatiſts did accuſe them as Traitors and perſecutors: and that this ſaying had been vttered. Indignum est vt in vnum conueniant filij Martyrum &amp; progenies traditorum. It is an vnworthie thing, that the ſonnes of Martyres, &amp; the generations of traitors ſhould come together.
                When Auguſtine had ſaide he was no traitor, Creſconius the Donatiſt replieth. Sed ille qui tradidit te, creauit. Fonte deducitur riuus, &amp; caput membra ſequuntur, ſano capite omne ſanum est corpus, &amp; ſi quid in hoc morbi vel vitij est, omnia membra debilitat, or iginem ſuam respicit quicquid in ſtirpe proceſſit. Non potest innocens eſſe qui ſectam non ſequitur innocentis. But he that created thee plaied the Traitor, the riuer or ſtreame is deriued from the Fountaine, and the members followe the head. The head being ſounde, the whole bodie is ſound, and if there bee anie diſeaſe in it, it
               
               
               weakeneth all the members. It reſpecteth it owne originall, whatſoeuer groweth out of the ſtock: hee cannot bee innocent, which followeth not the ſect of the innocent. Theſe be the words of Creſconius the Donatiſt, by which hee taketh vpon him to proue that Auguſtine, and all the Paſtors of the Churches had no true ordination, were not true Miniſters of Chriſt, but the generations of traitors: He vſeth as we ſee thrée ſimilitudes. The firſt is to this effect, as the riuer is deriued from the Fountaine, and muſt néedes be ſuch as it is, ſo thoſe that bée ordeined Miniſters are like the ſtreame deriued from the fountaine, the ordeinors being trators, Iudaſſes, falſe prophets, perſecutors; ye ordeined muſt néedes be ſuch alſo. The ſecond is that the members doo followe the head: He that ordeineth is the head, the Miniſters ordeined are the members. If the head be infected, the poyſon of it goeth into the mēbers, Thy ordeinor, euen thy head was a traitor, thou art then a traitor alſo. The third ſimilitude is from the ſtock and the branches that growe out of it: ſuch as the ſtock is, ſuch are the braunches that growe out of it. But he that ordeined thée or created thée a Miniſter, was a falſe Prophet: therefore thou art a falſe prophet: for hée is the ſtock out of which thou dooſt growe, how canſt thou but bee ſuch as the roote, out of which thou dooſt ſpring. The Browniſts handling this point, to proue that we be no Miniſters of Chriſt ſet foorth the matter thus: your diſcent and pedegrée is in few degrées deriued from the Pope, you being the Children of your Antichriſtian Biſhops, which are the creatures of the Pope, who is the eldeſt ſonne of Sathan, and his vicar generall in earth, whoſe image, marke, power, and life you beare, and together with him growe, liue, raigne, ſtand, and fall as the branches with the Trée. This is the eloquence of the Browniſts, which differing in words, containeth the ſame reaſons that the Donatiſts did vſe: for in ſtead of the Fountaine and the ſtreame, the head and the members, they put the Fathers and the Children: for the ſtock and the braunches they put the Trée and the boughes which is all one: And from the roote, as it were

from the Fountaine and head, they deriue the life, the power and the Image, &amp;c. Thus they agrée then, that the one part ſaide thoſe which ordeined ye were ſuch as ſacrificed to Idols, and Traitors, verie Iudaſſes, you are their children and like them. The other part ſaieth, thoſe that ordeined yee bée the creatures of Antichriſt, yée receiue the verie life and power of your Miniſterie from them, ye are their Children, and ſo the Children of the Pope. Now let vs ſée the anſwer which Auguſtine maketh, which is this, In his omnibus verbis tuis creatorem meum caput meum, non fecisti niſi traditorem, quem quidem accuſare tantùm, non conuincere potuisti. Ego autem nec eius innocentiam mihi creatricem vel fontem caputúe constituo. Sed tu ad illud redis in quo Petilianus errauit, cum cuiuſ
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   in ſanctificatione baptiſmatis Chriſtu
                     •
                   ſit orig
                     •
                   caput
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   naſcentis: &amp; nos vis venire in maledictū, de quo ſcriptum eſt: maledictus omnis qui ſpem ſuam ponit in homine. That is to ſay, In all theſe thy wordes thou haſt made my ordainer, my head, none other than a traitor, whom thou couldeſt onely accuſe, but not conuince. But I do not hold his innocencie to be that which hath ordained me a Miniſter, or to be fountaine or head: but thou doeſt returne to that in which Petilian erred, when as Chriſt in the ſanctification of baptiſme is the originall and the head of euerie one that is borne againe: and wilt haue vs come into the curſe, of which it is written: Curſed is euerie one that putteth his truſt in man.
               
            
            Thus farre Auguſtine, whoſe anſwere hath two parts. The firſt is, that the Donatiſts did accuſe, but could not prooue that the ordainers were ſuch as in time of perſecution had yeelded to ſacrifice to Idols, or deliuered the holie booke to the fire. The other part is, that whether he that ordained him were a godlie man or a wicked man: the matter is all one touching his ordination and Miniſtrie. The ordination not being mans, the innocencie of man cannot be the ordainer, it cannot bee the head or fountaine: neither can it make his ordination the better. Then likewiſe, the wickedneſſe of the man that ordaineth, cannot be the roote nor the fountain,

nor the head. The men which ordaine, are not the fathers of the Miniſtrie, becauſe it is not theirs which they deliuer, but Chriſts. That this is Auguſtines meaning it is cléere by that he telleth Creſconius he returned to that in which Petilian erred. Petilian denying that it was baptiſme that had béen miniſtred by an vngodlie man: rendereth this reaſon, that euerie thing muſt haue an originall and an head, or elſe it is nothing. Auguſtine repl
                  •
               eth, that Chriſt onely is the originall and the head of him that is baptized: and that the baptiſme being Chriſts, and not theirs that did deliuer it: the goodnes of the Miniſter made it not one iot the better, nor the wickednes of the Miniſter any whit the worſe. Adding moreouer, that ſuch as take the baptiſme miniſtred by a godlie man to bee better in it ſelfe, than that which is miniſtred by a naughtie man: fall into the curſe, of which it is written, Curſed is euerie one that putteth his truſt in man. He that hangeth the matters which are Chriſts vpon men, putteth his truſt in men. The ſame anſwere that hée hath made to thoſe his Donatiſts of Aphrica, doo wee make vnto our Donatiſts of England. Firſt they accuſe in moſt bitter and hainous manner, but ſhall neuer be able to prooue their accuſation: for there is no Miniſtrie in England ordained by the Pope or for the Pope. The Miniſtrie of publiſhing the Goſpell and deliuering the Sacraments is not the deuice of man, but Chriſtes ordinance: and therefore we receiue it not as theirs that deliuer it, neither doth their godlines or vngodlines make it better or worſe vnto vs. The Miniſtrie was not vtterlie deſtroyed in the Poperie, for there remained the Sacrament of baptiſme, howſoeuer the Catabaptiſts denie the ſame. How much is the Miniſtrie of Chriſt to bee acknowledged when it is onely to that end for which he ordained it, though the men that ordaine ſhould be moſt vngodlie? This thing will more fullie appeare when we come to handle the agréement of the Browniſts with the Donatiſts in that ranke Donatiſme, affirming it to bee no Sacrament which is miniſtred by an open wicked man.
            Thus much may ſuffice to ſhewe, that in denying the miniſtrie

to bee Chriſts, they hold the ſame ground and arguments, and receiue the ſelfe ſame anſwere. And for their rayling termes, as generations of traitors, ſeducers, falſe Prophets, Iudaſſes, perſecutors, and ſuch like; I néed not mention the compariſon of our men with them, ſeeing they doo in this, as in one of the chiefe vaines of their eloquence, apparantlie excell. Their baſeſt diſciples can crie out Antichriſts, Baals Prieſts, falſe Prophets, ſeducers, and what not? But it will bée ſayd, that in the matter of diſcipline the Donatiſts and Browniſts are vnlike. I graunt the Donatiſts, that euer I haue read, did take no exception that way. That is not alone in queſtion, but whether there were any fault, ſo that exception might betaken. And for this, men are to conſider, that as corruption in doctrine and ceremonies did enter betimes into the Church, and growe a pace: ſo alſo the diſcipline or externall gouernment was of many neglected, abuſed and corrupted. Sundrie of the Paſtors being proud and ambitious, the ſteppes were made for Antichriſt to climbe vp, who challenged not onely an externall power ouer all other, but alſo a Lordſhip ouer the conſcience. Thus much touching the firſt obiection.
            The ſecond difference obiected is, That the Donatiſts did condemne all Churches in the world: The Browniſts condemne but the Churches of England. Indéed the Browniſts doo affirme that they be farre from condemning all churches: and ſo here is an apparant difference, and a great, at the firſt ſight, if men doo not narrowlie way and conſider all matters. They knowe it is a great preiudice vnto them, if it bée found that they condemne all Churches: but wee may not looke vpon their words of deniall, but vpon the conſequence of their matters. For he that ſhooteth an arrowe at one thing and together therewith ſtriketh another, cannot bee ſayd not to haue ſtriken it becauſe he had no ſuch intent. So muſt wee conſider whether the dart of condemnation which they haue ſhot at the Church of England, doo not together with the ſame runne through the ſides of all Churches. I ſtand to prooue it doth, and ſo that they are in this alſo full

               Donatiſts. But if they did not, yet they ſhall bee found thus farre in Donatiſme, as to condemne ſome Churches of Chriſt. My firſt reaſon ſhall be from hence, that the Church of England is eſteemed and reuerenced among the Churches as a ſiſter, and communicated withall: and yet they all know what her faults be, in her aſſemblies, in her worſhip, in her miniſtrie and gouernment, in as much as they are open and apparant to them, euen as to our ſelues. Now, that they iuſtifie her as a true Church, we haue their own words: for the harmonie of confeſſions of the Churches, collected and ſet foorth by the Churches of France and of the Lowe Countries, doth receiue and approoue the confeſſion of the Church of England, and call it one of the reformed Churches. Whereupon I argue thus: If the Church of England be Antichriſtian, and idolatrous, and worſhip the beaſt, bow downe vnto him and receiue his marke, becauſe of the gouernment by Biſhops: then the Churches which doo perfectlie knowe the ſame, and yet doo acknowledge her as a ſiſter, and communicate with her, are partakers of her ſinne, and ſo to be condemned with her. Therefore the Browniſts condemning it, condemne thoſe that iuſtifie it, knowing the eſtate. The Browniſts condemne all thoſe as perſecutors of the iuſt, enemies of Chriſt, and of his kingdome, that ſhall hold them to be Heretickes and Schiſmatickes for condemning the Church of England and ſeparating themſelues. I argue thus: All the Churches which know the Church of England▪
                and her forme of gouernment, and yet doo loue and reuerence her as a true Church of Chriſt, condemne thoſe as hereticall Schiſmatickes which call it Antichriſtian and ſeparate themſelues from it. For how can the Churches as they doo eſteeme the Church of England as a true ſiſter, and yet not condemne the Browniſts as wicked Schiſmatickes, which call it the Synagog of Sathan? Then let the Browniſts ſhewe that the Churches haue reuoked this their former iudgement of the Church of England: or elſe let them anſwere whether they condemne not all thoſe as no true Chriſtians, which ſhall affirme them to

be wicked Schiſmatickes for ſeparating themſelues from the aſſemblies of England: If they will deny that the churches eſteeme our Churche as a ſiſter, and therefore condemne them as vngodlie Schiſmatickes, the matter is ſo cléere that all men ſhal ſee them then to be impudent. It may be ſome Browniſt will replie, that it cannot be extended vnto all Churches a farre off which is verified in ſome that be nigh. Well, let vs ſee then for the Churches a farre off. Doo not the Browniſts condemne the Church of Geneua? They will ſay no. But I ſay they doo. For as I ſayd before, will they not condemne all ſuch as doo reiect them as wicked Schiſmatickes? This doth the Church of Geneua. Which I prooue thus: In that the Church of Geneua doth approoue the doctrine of thoſe that haue béen and are her moſt learned and godlie Paſtors: as Maſter Caluin, with whom the reſt conſent in doctrine. Now, touching the doctrine of Maſter Caluin publiſhed, whereby he condemneth the Browniſts as Schiſmatickes, ye may reade it in fourth booke of his Inſtitutions, and the firſt Chapter. It is too large to recite the whole, I will alleage but ſome parts. Looke vppon the ſeuenth ſection where he ſaith: that in the viſible Church in earth, there are verie many hypocrites mingled; verie many that be ambicious, couetous, enuious, curſed ſpeakers, ſome of more impure life, which tollerated for a time, either becauſe they cannot in lawfull iudgemēt be conuinced, or elſe becauſe that ſeueritie of diſcipline which ought to be, is not alwaies in force. In the ninth ſection he affirmeth, that the reaſon is ſomewhat diuers in eſteeming priuate men and in eſteeming the churches: for it may come to paſſe (as he ſaith) that wee ought to handle them as brethren, and accompt inſtead of beléeuers, ſuch as wee ſhall thinke vtterlie vnworthie the fellowſhip of the godlie, euen for the cōmon conſent of the church, by which they are tollerated in the bodie of Chriſt. Wee doo not approoue ſuch by our voyce to be members of the Church; but we leaue vnto them that place which they hold among the people of God▪ vntill it be taken from them by lawfull iudgement. Then

he addeth, but wee muſt thinke otherwiſe of the multitude: which if it haue the Miniſterie of the Word, and giue honour, if it haue the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, no doubt it deſerueth to bee accounted a Church: becauſe it is certaine, thoſe things are not without fruite: ſo wee both keepe for the Uniuerſall Church her vnitie, which diueliſh Spirites haue alwaies endeuored to cutte in ſunder: neither doo wee defraude of their authoritie, the lawfull aſſemblies which are ſeuered according to the fitnes of places. In the tenth ſection hee vttereth that the Lord maketh ſo great account of the communion of his Church, that he eſtéemeth him as a runnagate, and forſaker of religion, whoſoeuer he be that frowardlie ſhall ſeparate himſelfe from any Chriſtian ſocietie, which imbraſeth but the true Miniſtrie of the word and Sacraments. And a little after he inferreth vpon ſome ground of reaſon, that the departure from the Church is the deniall of God and of Chriſt: affirming moreouer that no crime can bée deuiſed more horrible than with ſacrilegious trecherie, to violate the mariage which the Sonne of God hath vouchſafed to contract with vs. In the twelft ſection hée dooth expounde what is his meaning when he requireth a pure Miniſterie of the word, and pure order of adminiſtring the Sacraments, as notes infallible of the true Church. For hee ſaieth there may ſomewhat that is faltie créepe in, either in the adminiſtration of the word, or of the Sacraments, which ought not to ſeparate vs from the Communion of that Miniſtrie. Becauſe there be principles of Religion, without which we cannot be ſaued, and there be points in which men diſſent, and the one part erreth, and yet the vnitie of faith and brotherlie loue is kept: not that we are to approue the leaſt errour in doctrine, or the ſialeſt corruption in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments. In the thirtéenth ſection he ſaith, that in tolerating the imperfection of life, wée ought to bée much more fauorable: for here we are vpon ſlipperie ground where wée may eaſely fall. And the euill dooth héere lie in waite, and aſſalt vs with ſpeciall engines; for there haue

been alwaies ſome, which being caried with a falſe perſwaſion of an abſolute perfection, as if they were now become certaine ayrie ſpirites deſpiſed the fellowſhip of all men, in whome they ſaw any thing that is humaine or corrupt remaining. Such were of olde time the Cathari, and the Donatiſts which fell into the ſame furie: ſuch are at this daye ſome of the Anabaptiſts which would ſeeme to haue profited more than others: There be other ſome that offend rather of an inconſiderate zeale of righteouſnes than of that mad pride: for while they ſee the life is not anſwerable to the holie doctrine in bringing foorth good fruite among ſuch as haue the Goſpell preached, they iudge by and by that there is no Church. Then he ſheweth further that the offence is iuſt, and God muſt needs puniſh that there is ſuch wounding of weake conſciences: but in this they offend, as hee ſaieth, that they knowe not how to keepe anie meaſure in being offended; or omitting that clemencie which the Lord requireth, they giue themſelues wholie vnto immoderate ſeueritie. And becauſe they think there is no Church, where there is not ſound puritie and integritie of life, through the hatred of wickednes they depart away from the lawfull Church, while they thinke they turne a ſide from the faction of the wicked. Then he proceedeth in anſwering their obiections, they alleage that the Church of Chriſt is holie; he willeth them alſo to vnderſtand by the parables in the Goſpell, that the good and the bad are mixed together. They erie out that it is a thing intollerable that the contagious peſtilence of vices dooth in ſuch violent raging ſort ouerſpread all, hee ſetteth before them the vices that were in the Churches of Corinth and Galatia. They obiect that Paul dooth will we eate not with anie called a brother which is of an vngodlie life. Yea here they crie out that if it be not lawfull to eate common bread with ſuch, how ſhould it be lawfull to eate with them the bread of the Lord? He anſwereth that it is a great reproach in deede, if dogges and ſwine bee admitted to haue place among the children of God: yea it is alſo much greater, if the ſacred bodie of Chriſt be proſtituted

vnto them. And where the Churches are well ordred, they doo not keepe in their boſome the notorious wicked, nor admit all without difference to that holie banquet: but the paſtors are not alwaies diligent, ſometime they fauour more than they ought or bee more remiſſe. And ſometime they cannot but are letted from exerciſing that ſeueritie which they would. Now when the Church ceaſeth to doo her duetie herein, it is not for euery priuate man (ſaith he) to ſeparate himſelfe: euery godly man is indeede to keepe himſelfe from the fellowſhip of ſinne; but it is one thing to eſchewe the fellowſhip of ſinne, and another for hatred thereof to renounce the Communion of the Church. Then hee anſwereth further, that Saint Paul willeth euerie one to examine himſelfe when hee commeth to eate of that bread; and if it were a wicked thing to communicate with the vnworthie, Paul would certainelie haue willed vs to looke about leaſt there ſhould bee ſome in the multitude, by whoſe vncleannes we might be defiled. Theſe things he hath in the fourteenth and fifteenth ſections: in the ſixteenth ſection hauing ſhewed that the chiefe ringleaders in ſuch ſeparation are led with pride, he willeth the godlie to conſider that in a great multitude there are manie which are truelie, holie and innocent before the eyes of the Lord, which are hid from their ſight; that of thoſe which ſeeme diſeaſed or infected, there are manie which doo not pleaſe or flatter themſelues in their vices, but being eftſones awakened with an earneſt feare of God labour to amend. That they muſt not iudge of a man for one fact: when the holieſt men doo ſometime fall moſt grieuouſlie: That the Miniſtrie of the word, and the participation of the Sacraments, haue more force to gather a Church, than that by the fault of certaine wicked men, that whole power may vaniſh or come to none effect. Finallie let them conſider that in eſteeming a Church, the iudgement of God, is of more waight and certaintie, than the iudgement of man. In the eighteenth ſection, hee ſetteth forth how the holie Prophets of God did not ſeparate themſelues, in thoſe horrible and lamentable deſolations which

they deſcribe: when moſt of the people and the Prieſtes themſelues were openlie wicked.
            Thus may wee ſee that Maſter Caluine condemning the Browniſts ſo ſeuerelie by the Scriptures, they muſt either reuoke Browniſme in this point, that the bad pollute the good, and therefore ſeparation to be made, which he termeth ſacrilegious treacherie; or elſe condemne him not onelie with the Church of Geneua which he taught, but alſo all other Churches that imbrace his writings, and acknowledge him for a noble inſtrument of God. Furthermore let the Browniſts ſhew any one aſſemblie at this day in the World, in which there bee not open ſinners admitted to the Lords table, and which ſinne in great ſinnes, as either in pride, ſelfe loue, ambition, couetouſnes, idlenes, hatred, enuie, contention, backbiting, lying and in ſuch like. They ſay all are polluted and fallen away from the couenant, where any that openlie ſinneth is admitted to the holie Communion. How can they ſay then that they doo not condemne all Churches vnder heauen? Finallie when in their writings they affirme that preſcript forme of prayer impoſed is Idolatrie, a bondage breaking chriſtian libertie, a thing moſt deteſtable, they doo ſo farre condemne all Churches, in as much as there is no one which hath not preſcript forme of Prayer impoſed. And the Browniſt which hath publiſhed in Print, a defence of the ſame, alleageth the extreame curſe againſt thoſe that adde to Gods word Reuel. 22. and ſaith they adde which make Lawes in the Church, in matters of circumſtance, or things indifferent. Which in deede all the Churches doo; and therefore hee layeth that extreame curſe vpon all the reformed Churches: let no man therefore be ſo ſimple, as to imagine that the Browniſts doo condemne but the Engliſh Churches, when their extreame ſeueritie in condemning reacheth ouer all.
            Now to the third thing obiected wherein they may ſeeme to differ from the Donatiſts: namely that the Donatiſts did holde that the Sacraments, or the efficacie of them doth depend

vpon the worthines of the miniſter: but the Browniſts are not of that minde. I anſwere that in this great and ranck poynt of Donatiſme I can find no difference at all betwéen them and the Browniſts: and let the wordes and meaning of both be ſcanned, and it ſhal appeare manifeſtly that they hold the ſelfe ſame thing, neither more nor leſſe like euen brethren.
            The Browniſts affirme that we haue neither worde of God nor Sacraments in our Church. But demaund of them, doth the Sacrament or the efficacie thereof depend vpon the worthines of the miniſter? They will aunſwere, it doth not, but yet it can be no Sacrament of Chriſt vnles hee be a miniſter of Chriſt that doth deliuer it. If it bee ſaide vnto them Iudas was a moſt wicked man, and our Sauiour calleth him a diuell yet was he a miniſter of Chriſt for the time, and the baptiſme he adminiſtred as effectual as the baptiſme of any other. They will replie and ſay, that was ſo becauſe the ſinne of Iudas was ſecret, they were not polluted by his vncleannes, becauſe they did not know it: But he that is an open ſinner cannot be a miniſter of Chriſt; and ſuch as receiue the Sacrament at his hand, knowing his wickednes cannot but be partakers of his ſinne and polluted by the ſame. This wil they ſay is not to make either the being of a Sacrament, or the efficacie therof to depend vpon a man, but vpon Gods ordinance that he be a minſter that deliuer it. I will not denie that he muſt be a miniſter that doth deliuer it: And I ſay withall that although the Donatiſts may ſeeme by ſome of their ſpeeches to holde a further thing touching this matter, yet lay al their ſayings together, and it is manifeſt they held, that where the ſinne was ſecret in him that did adminiſter, the Sacrament deliuered by him was effectuall, notwithſtanding he were neuer ſo wicked inwardly: but if his ſinne were open, he was no miniſter, and ſo no Sacrament, but the partie that communicateth with him is polluted by him.
            
               Potilian the Donatiſt Biſhop in the beginning of his epiſtle denying that they did rebaptize, but that ſuch as were

baptized in the Churches were not baptized at all, before they baptized them, for confirmation vſeth this ſaying, Conſciētia namque dantis attenditur, quae abluat accipientis. For the conſcience of him that giueth is attended, which may waſh the conſcience of him that receiueth.
                Further he ſaith, Qui fidem a perfido ſumpſerit, non fidem percipit ſed reatum. He that will take faith of the faithleſſe, receiueth not faith but guiltines.
                And rendring a reaſon for confirmation he ſaith, Omnis enim res origine et radice conſistit: &amp; ſi caput non habet aliquid, nihil est. For euery thing doth conſiſt of an originall and roote: and if any thing haue not a head; it is nothing. Auguſtine
                anſwereth to theſe ſayings of Petilian, demanding firſt, what if the conſcience of him that giueth be ſecret, and perhaps vncleane, how can it waſh the conſcience of him that receiueth? For if the Donatiſt ſhall ſay it apperteineth not to the receiuer, whatſoeuer euill lie hid in the conſcience of the giuer, that ignorance perhaps ſhal be of this force, that vnwittinglie he cannot bee defiled by the conſcience of him that baptizeth him: let it ſuffice therefore that the defiled conſcience of an other while it is not knowne doth not pollute, yet will they ſay it ſhall alſo waſh? From whence is he waſhed then that receiueth baptiſme of one that hath a polluted conſcience, and he doth not knowe ſo much? Séeing he ſaith, he that will take faith of him that is faithles, doth not receiue faith, but guiltines. Behold a faithles man doth ſtand to baptize, but he that is to be baptized doth not knowe his vnfaithfulnes, what doeſt thou thinke he ſhall receiue, faith or guiltines? If the Donatiſt ſay, he receiueth faith, then he inferreth, that it is graunted it may come to paſſe, that a man may receiue faith and not guiltines from an vnfaithful man, and ſo the former ſaying is falſe. But if the Donatiſt ſhould anſwere, he receiueth guiltines: then he ſaith the Donatiſts ſhould baptize thoſe againe which were baptized among themſelues by wicked men, whoſe wickedneſſe was ſecrete at ſuch time as they did baptize, but afterward they were be
               
                  •
               raied, conuict, and condemned. I ſay then it is manifeſt by

the practiſe of the Donatiſts, in not baptizing againe any of thoſe which had béen among them baptized by their owne Miniſters whom they eſtéemed godlie, but afterward were diſcloſed to be ranke hypocrites, and ſo they condemned and caſt them foorth, that their iudgement was, that he was a Miniſter of Chriſt, though a reprobate touching his owne perſon, and the Sacrament deliuered by him a true Sacrament, ſo long as his wickednes ſay hid from the knowledge of men: howſoeuer the reaſons of Petilian which he vttered in the raſh heate of his furie, may ſeeme to ſtretch further. And where as Auguſtine anſwering to ye reſt of the words ſaith: Quapropter ſiue à fideli, ſiue à perfido diſpenſatore Sacramentum baptiſmi quiſque percipiat, ſpes ei omnis in Chriſto ſit, ne ſit maledictus qui ſpem ſuam ponit in homine. Alioquin ſi talis quiſ
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   in gratia ſpirituali renaſcitur, qualis eſt ille à quo baptizatur, &amp; cum manifestus eſt qui baptizat homo bonus, ipſe dat fidem, ipſe origo &amp; radix, capút
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   naſcentis eſt: cùm autem latet perfidus baptizator, tunc quiſque à Christo percipit fidem, tunc à Christo ducit originem, tunc in Christoradicatur, tunc Christo capite gloriatur: laborandum eſt omnibus qui baptizantur vt baptizatores perfidos habeant, &amp; ignorent eos. That is to ſay: Wherefore whoſoeuer receiueth the Sacrament of baptiſme, whether it bee of a faithfull, or whether it be of an vnfaithfull diſpenſor, let all his hope be in Chriſt, leaſt he be accurſed as one that putteth his truſt in man. Otherwiſe if euerie one that is borne in ſpirituall grace be ſuch an one, as he is by whom he is baptized: and when he that baptizeth is manifeſt a good man, he giueth faith, he is the originall, the roote and the head of him that is newe borne: but when he that baptizeth is vnfaithfull being not knowne ſo to be, then euerie one receiueth faith of Chriſt, taketh originall from Chriſt, is rooted in Chriſt and glorieth in Chriſt his head: then all men are to endeuour which are baptized, that they may haue vnfaithfull baptizers, ſo they knowe them not to be ſuch. His reaſon is, that when the man that baptizeth is ſecretlie wicked, it is moſt abſurd to ſay his conſcience baptizeth, or that he is the

roote or head of him that is regenerate, and therefore the Donatiſts confeſſing ſuch to bee truelie baptized, he ſaith it muſt néeds then be Chriſt that doth baptize. And thereupon inferreth, that this abſurditie muſt needes followe, which is moſt fooliſh to beléeue, that it is better to be baptized of a ſecret wicked man, than of the beſt manifeſt godlie man, becauſe Chriſt is incomparablie better than the beſt men. Wherefore he wiſheth them to confeſſe whether the Miniſter be good or bad, it is Chriſt alone that doth baptize, that giueth faith, that is the roote and the head. It will now be ſaid, that by this it appeareth the Donatiſts did aſcribe all to the man, if he were godlie. Let vs ſee therefore what they anſwere. Creſconius taking vpon him to defend the ſaying of Petilian, in this that the conſcience of the giuer doth waſh the conſcience of the receiuer: and Auguſtine demaunded, what if the giuer be of a defiled conſcience, and ſecret? Creſconius anſwereth: Conſcientia dantis attenditur, non ſecundum eius ſynceritatem, quae in illa videri non poteſt, ſed ſecundum famam quae de illa ſeu vera, ſeu falſa eſt: quia videlicet eius eſt hominis, qui &amp; ſi ſceleratus occultus ſit, ſufficit accipienti, quod bonae ſit existimationis nondum cognitus, nondum iudicatus, nondum ab eccleſia ſeparatus. That is, The conſcience of the giuer is attended, not according to the ſynceritie thereof, which in it cannot be ſeene, but according to the fame which is of it whether true or falſe: that is to ſay, becauſe it is of that mā, who though he be ſecretlie wicked, it is ſufficient for the receiuer, that he is of good eſtimatiō, not yet knowne, not yet iudged, not yet ſeparate from the Church. Booke. 2. Chapt. 17. This blind ſhift had Creſconius alleaged to auoide thoſe former abſurdities, and fell into as great that falſe fame doth baptize. By which it appeareth that the whole matter of the Donatiſts opinion reſted in this, that an open wicked man onely did not, or could not baptize. Creſconius calleth vpon Auguſtine thus: Responde quomodo baptizent quos damnauit eccleſia? Anſwere how they can baptize whom the Church hath condemned? Auguſtine
                doth anſwere: Sic eos baptizare, quomodo baptizant
               
               quos damnanit Deus, antequam de illis quicquam iudicaret eccleſia. That they baptize as thoſe doo whom GOD hath cōdemned, before the Church hath iudged any thing of them.
                And ſeeing the ſecrete wicked man is condemned alreadie by Chriſt, and the Church is ſubiect to Chriſt: hée inferreth, Non igitur debet eccleſia ſe Christo praeponere, vt putet baptizare poſſe ab illo iudicatos, à ſe autem iudicatos baptizare non poſſe, cum ille ſemper veraciter iudicet, eccleſiastici autem Iudices ſicut homines plerun
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   falluntur. Therefore the Church ought not to preferre her ſelfe before Chriſt, as to thinke that ſuch as are condemned by him can baptize, but ſuch as are condemned by her cannot baptize, when he alwaies iudgeth truely, where the eccleſiaſticall Iudges as men are oftentimes deceiued.
                Hereupon hee concludeth, Baptizant ergo quantum attinet ad viſibile ministerium, &amp; boni, &amp; mali, inuiſibiliter autem per eos baptizat, cuius eſt &amp; viſibile baptiſma, &amp; inuiſibilis gratia. Tingere ergo poſſunt &amp; boni &amp; mali, abluere autem conſcientiam non niſi ille, qui ſemper eſt bonus. Therefore both the good and the bad do baptize in as much as appertaineth to the viſible miniſtrie, but inuiſiblie by them doth hee baptize whoſe is both the viſible baptiſme, and alſo the inuiſible grace. Both the good then and the bad may dippe them in the water, but to waſh the cōſcience, there can none but he which is alwaies good.
                Booke. 2. Chapt. 21. Creſconius procéedeth, demaunding what can be vttered more wicked than this, Vt purificet aliū maculoſus, abluat ſordidus, emundet immundus, det infidelis fidem, criminoſus faciat innocentem. That he which is ſpotted ſhould purifie another, he that is foule ſhould waſh, he that is vncleane ſhould clenſe, that an Infidell ſhould giue faith, that he which is criminous ſhould make another innocent?
                Booke. 3. Chapt. 5. Auguſtine anſwereth: Nec maculoſus, nec ſordidus, nec immundus, nec infidelis, nec criminoſus eſt Christus, qui dilexit eccleſiam &amp; ſeipſum tradidit pro ea, mundans eam lauacro aquae in verbo, faciens nos certos de bonis ſuis, ne malis viciaremur alienis. Chriſt is not ſpotted, nor foule, nor vncleane, nor an infidell, nor criminous
               
               
               which hath loued his Church and giuen himſelfe for it cleanſing it by the lauer of water through the word, making vs ſure of his good things, that wee cannot be defiled with the euill of other men.
            
            But now to come to a more cléere opening of this matter, whereas Petilian had ſaide that euerie thing conſiſteth of an originall and roote, and if any thing haue not an head it is nothing: and the anſwere was made, that Chriſt is the originall, the roote and the head of him that is baptized: and that he is accurſed which putteth his truſt in man. Creſconius dooth replie, as Auguſtine reporteth his words, Hoc &amp; nos ſuademus &amp; volumus, vt ſemper Christus det fidem, Chriſtus ſit origo Christiani, in Christo radicem Christianus infigat, Christus Christiani ſit caput. Non quaerimus hominem in quo ſpem constituat accepturus, ſed quaerimus per quem hoc melius fiat? Et quia ſine ministro nec vos dicitis hominem poſse baptizari, quaerimus vtrúmne melius iniuſtus ſit miniſter, an iustus? This alſo
                (ſaieth the Donatiſts) we will and perſwade, that Chriſt alwaies giueth faith, Chriſt is the originall of a Chriſtian, in Chriſt the Chriſtian muſt fixe his roote, that Chriſt is the head of the Chriſtian, wee ſeeke not a man in whome he that is to be baptized may ſet his hope, but we ſeeke by whome this may better be done. And becauſe you alſo ſay a man cannot be baptized without a miniſter, we demaund whether is the better, that the miniſter be vniuſt, or that he be iuſt. Booke 3. chapt. 6, 7, and 8. Auguſtine replieth. Vbi respondeo, ad hoc eſſe melius, vt ſit iuſtus minister, quod infirmitas hominis, cui ſine exemplo laborioſum est &amp; difficile quod imperat Deus, imitatione boni ministri ad vitam bonam facilius erigatur. Vnde dicit Apostolus Paulus, imitatores mei estote, ſicut &amp; ego Chriſti. ad hominem vero baptizandum, &amp; ſanctificandum, ſi tantòeſt melius quod accipitur, quantò est melior per quem traditur: tanta est in accipientibus baptiſmorum varietas, quanta in ministris diuerſitas meritorum. Si enim, quod ſine controuerſia creditur, melior erat Paulus quam Apollo, meliorem baptiſmum profectò dedit, ſecundùm istam vestram vanam
               
               peruerſamque ſententiam. Et ſi meliorem baptiſmum dedit, profecto eis quos a ſe non baptizatos gratulatur inuidit. Porro ſi interbonos ministros, cum ſit alius alio melior, non est melior baptiſmus qui per meliorem datur, nullo modo est malus qui etiam per malum datur, quando idem baptiſmus datur, &amp; ideo per ministros dispares, Dei munus aequale est, quia non illorum, ſed eius est. Where I anſwere (ſaieth Auguſtine) That in this reſpect it is better, that the miniſter be godly, becauſe the infirmitie of man, to whome without an example it is labour ſome and difficult to doo that which God commaundeth, may more eaſilie by the imitation of a good miniſter be raiſed vp and ſupported vnto good life. Whereupon the Apoſtle Paul ſaieth, Be yee followers of me, as I am of Chriſt. But for the Baptizing, and ſanctifying a man, If it be ſo much better which is receiued, as he is better, by whome it is deliuered: then there is as great varietie of Baptiſmes in the receiuers, as there is diuerſitie of worthines in the miniſters. For if Paul were better than Apollo, which is beleeued without controuerſie, then hee verelie, according to that your vaine and peruerſe ſentence, gaue a better baptiſme. And if he deliuered a better baptiſme, doubtles he enuied thoſe for whome hee is glad that they were not baptized by him. Moreouer if it be ſo, that among the good Miniſters, when one is better than another, the baptiſme is not better which is deliuered by the better, it is by no meane euill when it is giuen by a naughtie man, ſeeing the ſame baptiſme is deliuered. And therefore by vnequall Miniſters, the gift of God is equall, becauſe it is his, and not theirs. Thus farre Auguſtine. It is apparant enough by that which I haue alreadie cited, what the Donatiſts meant in denying it to bee Baptiſme which was adminiſtred by an open wicked man: and requiring for the trueth and efficacie of Baptiſme, that it ſhould be adminiſtred by a godlie man, or at the leaſt by a man godlie in ſhew: but yet I will adde ſomewhat more. Petilian replying vpon Auguſtine with great railing, ſaide alſo that thoſe abſurdities which he gathered were his own. booke 3. chap.

45. And whereas Auguſtine had demaunded, what if the conſcience of him that deliuereth be vncleane &amp; ſecret, what dooth waſh (if anie thing be to be that way regarded in mā)? he anſwereth it is as to ſay, Quid ſi nunc coelum ruat? What if the ſkie ſhuld now fal?
                Moreouer he ſaith that two words of his were omitted by Auguſtine, in his two ſayings: the one is, the conſcience of him that giueth, where he ſaieth his words were ſanctè dantis, of him that giueth holilie:
                The other, he that will take faith of an vnfaithfull man, hee receiueth not faith but guiltines: where hee ſaith this word ſciens, was omitted: which is knowing. So that howſoeuer Petilian ſéemed in his heate to vtter otherwiſe, hee will haue this to be his meaning, that hee which receiueth Baptiſme of a Miniſter whome he knoweth to be a wicked man, becauſe his ſinnes are open, he receiueth not Baptiſme, but pollution and guiltines, by Communicating with him. booke 3. Chapter 31. Againe, where Petilian and the reſt affirmed, that hee which is Baptized of one that is dead, his waſhing dooth not profit him, hee meaneth by one that is dead, not the ſecret wicked, nor yet the open ſinner, vntill the Church haue condemned him Booke 1. Chap. 10. Parmenian that Donatiſt Biſhop, to proue that it was no Baptiſme which was miniſtred by an open wicked man, alleageth that the wicked which ſacrificeth a ſhéepe, is as hee that cutteth off the head of a dog; and the ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord. Eſay. 66. And that the man which had any blemiſh, or ſpot in him ſhould not come to offer as a Prieſt to the Lord Leuit. 21. And that God heareth not ſinners. Iohn. 9. As Auguſtine reporteth againſt Parmenian Booke 2. Chapt. 6, 7, 8. Where Auguſtine anſwereth, 
                  Ʋnicuique retribuit Deus ſecundùm cor ſuum. Nam ſi primis temporibus non obfuerunt mali ſacerdotes, vel collegis bonis, ſicut fuit Zacharias: vel popularibus, ſicut fuit Nathaniel in quo dolus non erat, quantò magis nihil obest in Christiana vnitate Epiſcopus malus, vel coepiſcopis vel lucis bonis, cùm iam ille ſacerdos in aeternum ſecundùm ordinem Melchiſedech &amp; pontifex noster ſedens ad dextram patris,
               
               interpellat pro nobis, &amp;c. God rendreth vnto euerie one according to his heart. For if in the firſt times, the naughtie Prieſts did not hurt either their fellowes which were good, ſuch as was Zacharie: or anie of the people, ſuch as was Nathaniel, in whom was no guile. How much more doth an euill Biſhop in the Chriſtian vnitie, nothing hurt, either his fellowe Biſhops being good, or anie of the laietie? when now that Prieſt for euer after the order of Melchiſedech, euen our high Prieſt, ſitting at the right hand of the Father, maketh interceſsion for vs, &amp;c. Dicant ergo mihi, cui ſancto ſecundùm ſalutem ſpiritualem obfuerit vel in ſacerdotibus, vel inter populum conſtituto, malus aut maculatus ſacerdos? Let them ſhew vnto me therefore which holie one either of the Prieſts or among the people, an euill and ſpotted Prieſt did hurt touching ſpirituall ſaluation.
                Where was Moſes and Aaron, there were the wicked murmurers: where was Caiphas and other ſuch like, there were Zacharie, Symeon and other godlie ones: where Saul was, there was Dauid; where Eſay, Ieremie, Ezechiel, and Daniel were, there were the wicked Prieſts, and naughtie people. Sed ſarcinam ſuam vnuſquiſque portabat. But euerie one did beare his owne burthen.
                And hauing ſhewed that the words of Balaam a wicked man were heard of God for the people, he addeth, Vnde non mirum est, verba bona quae propopulo dicū
                  tur in precibus, etiam ſi a malis dicantur epiſcopis, exaudiri tamen, non pro peruerſitate praepoſitorum, ſed pro deuotione populorum. From whence it is no meruaile, that good words which are vttered in prayer for the people are heard, though they bee vttered by naughtie Biſhops, not for the peruerſenes of the guides, but for the deuotion of the people.
                No man can take any thing vnles it be giuen him from aboue; Petilian ſaith thereupon: Doce igitur traditor ſimulandi mysteria quando acceperis potestatem, Shew therefore thou Traitor, when thou diddeſt receiue the power of counterfaiting the myſteries.
                Booke 2. Chapter. 31. Hee termeth it a counterfaiting, or faining of the ſacraments when they bee miniſtred by one that is openlie wicked, becauſe

he holdeth, that God neuer authoriſed any ſuch to deliuer them. And what is the whole pith of Browniſts touching this poynt, when they crie out that wee haue no word of God, nor Sacraments, but euen the verie ſame that the Donatiſts held, namelie that if he be openlie wicked, becauſe God commaundeth there ſhould be no ſuch in the Miniſterie, he hath no authoritie to Baptize, and ſo it is no Sacrament which is deliuered by them? The Browniſts affirme that the efficacie is of God, the faith is of God, the grace is of God alone, but God beſtoweth theſe by ſuch onelie as be his true Miniſters, and thoſe are none that be openlie wicked. The Donatiſts did affirme nothing but the verie ſame: For Auguſtine thus rehearſeth the words of Creſconius, Ideo magis te dicis iuſtum &amp; fidelem, per quem hoc ſacramentum celebretur inquirere, quia ſpem &amp; fiduciam Dei non hominis habes: Dei eſſe autem fidem atque iustitiam, quam ſemper in ministris eius attendis. Thou ſaieſt that becauſe thy hope and confidence is in God and not in man, thou doſt ſo much the rather ſeeke for one that is iuſt and faithfull by whome this Sacrament may be celebrated: and that the faith and righteouſnes is of God, which thou dooſt attend in his Miniſters. Booke 3. Chap. 9. I hold him therefore a verie ſharpe diſcerner, which waying throughlie all the ſayings of the Donatiſts, ſhall be able in this poynt of hanging the being and efficacie of the Sacraments, vpon the worthines of the Miniſters, to ſhew anie ſmall difference betweene the Browniſts and them. Yea but herein they may ſeeme to differ verie much, that the Donatiſts did rebaptize, but the Browniſts doo not. In déed herein I confeſſe they differ, but yet ſo that in this difference the Browniſts are the groſſer, if we may reaſon from that which they holde: for if this were true, which the Browniſts affirme moſt ſtiffelie to bee true, as the Donatiſts did before them, that where an open wicked man dooth adminiſter the Sacraments they be no Sacraments at all. And if this alſo were as true, which they both haue taken vpon them to iuſtifie, the Donatiſts of olde ſaying, they had no true Sacraments

in the Churches, and the Browniſts that we haue none now: It muſt needes be graunted that the Donatiſts did the better of both, in baptiſing thoſe which were not before baptized: for he that is not baptized ought to be baptized. And as no vncircumciſed might eate of the Paſſeouer, but was to be cut off from the people of GOD: ſo no vnbaptized is to eate at the table of the Lord. How groſſe are the Browniſts which take it as a thing vndoubted that we haue no Sacraments, and muſt needes thereupon be aſſured that they themſelues were neuer baptized, and ſo can be but as an heape of vncircumciſed, and yet ſeeke not to haue the Sacrament? I would haue them anſwer this queſtion, whether a man that knoweth he was neuer baptized, can be ſaued, if he ſeeke not to bee baptized, when hee may come by it? Let no man imagine that I ſpeake this as though the Browniſts ſhould doo well in rebaptizing, for their former ground is falſe, wicked and hereticall, when they ſay it is no Sacrament that hath been adminiſtred by open offenders: and that we haue no Sacraments. But if that were true which they hold, they ſhould doo much better, I will not ſay to rebaptize, but to baptize ſuch as were not before baptized.
            Now, where it is generallie obiected, that the Donatiſts perhaps held diuers things which the Browniſts doo not. I anſwere, that the Donatiſts indeede held ſomewhat which the Browniſts doo not, and the Browniſts hold ſomething which they did not. For ſome of the Donatiſts did caſt themſelues downe from high places, and into the fire, accounting them holie Martyres that ſo died, and others defended their doing. For thus ſaith Gaudentius a Donatiſt Biſhop in his Epiſtle, An ista perſecutio eſt, quae tot milliq innocentum martyrum arctauit ad mortem? Christiani enim ſecundum euangelium ſpiritu prompti, ſed carne infirmi à ſacrilega contaminatione caminorum reperto compendio ſuas animas rapuerunt, imitati preſbyteri Raziae in Machabaeorum libris exemplum, nec fruſtra timentes: quiſquis enim eorum manus inciderit, non euaſit: ſed quantum velint faciant, quod certum eſt, dei eſſe non poſsunt qui faciunt contra Deum. Whether is that
               
               
               a perſecution (ſaith he) which hath pent vp in a ſtraight ſo many thouſands of innocent martyres euen vnto death? For Chriſtians according to the Goſpell, being readie in ſpirit, but weake in the fleſh, finding out a compendious way of their chimneyes, haue deliuered their ſoules from the ſacrilegious pollution, imitating the example of olde Razia in the bookes of the Machabees, not fearing without cauſe: for whoſoeuer falleth into their hands, doth not eſcape: but let them doo as much as they will, that which is certaine, they cannot be of God, which doo againſt God. booke 2. againſt Gaudent. Chapt. 20. Auguſtine ſheweth, that Gaudentius meaning was not that they burnt themſelues in their chimneys for feare of perſecution vnto death, for the ciuill Magiſtrate did not ſo perſecute them, hauing made a lawe againſt them for baniſhment, but not for death: as Auguſtine ſheweth book 2. againſt Gaudentius chap. 11. Mitiora in vos conſtituit Imperator propter manſuetudinem Christianam: exilium vobis voluit inferre, non mortem. The Emperour hath decreed more gentle thinges againſt yee through Chriſtian mildnes: he would lay baniſhment vppon ye and not death.
                But his meaning is that ſuch as fell into their hands were drawne to ioyne with them in worſhip, which he calleth the ſacriligious defilement. And therfore doth abuſe that place of the Goſpell, to colour ſuch horrible murthering of themſelues, the ſpirit is readie but the fleſh is weake: for fearing leaſt through weakenes they ſhould yéeld to ioyne with the Churches, they rather choſe to kill themſelues. This the Browniſts doo not: but they condemne read prayer, or praying after any preſcript forme of words which the Donatiſts did not, as may bee gathered by theſe words of Petilian: Si p
                        •
                     ecem domino facitis, aut funditis orationem, nihil vobis penitus prodeſt. Vestras enim debiles preces cruenta vestra conſcientia vacuat, quia dominus deus puram magis conſcientiam quam preces exaudit, domino Chriſte dicente, non omnis qui dicit mihi domine, domine, intrabit in regnum coelorum, ſed is qui facit voluntatem patris mei qui eſt in coelis. Voluntas dei vtique bona eſt, nam ideo in ſacra oratione
               
               
               ſic petimus, fiat voluntas tua ſicut in coelo, &amp; in terra. If ye make prayer to the Lord
                (ſaith the Donatiſt) or powre foorth ſupplication, it doth profite ye nothing at al, for your bloudie conſcience doth make your weake prayers of none effect, becauſe the Lord God doth rather heare a pure conſcience than prayers, the Lord Ieſus ſaying, that not euerie one that ſaith vnto me Lord Lord ſhall enter into the kingdom of heauen, but he that doth the will of my father which is in heauen. The will of God is good, for therefore in the holie prayer we pray thus, thy will be done in earth as it is in heauen.
                Thus we ſee that the Donatiſt denying that any praied but they, ſheweth with all that praying they vſed the Lords prayer.
            But what doo I ſtand to ſeeke differences betwéen them, which can hardlie be found: whereas indeede whole bookes doo ſet foorth at large their agreement. I will therefore proceede further to declare in particulars touching the power of Chriſtian Princes, in reforming the Church, in eſtabliſhing religion, and in puniſhing heretickes, ſchiſmatickes, and diſturbers, and in compelling their ſubiects to the obedience of the trueth, or to imbrace the true worſhip, how iniuriouſlie Browne hath dealt in his booke, and the Browniſts that haue written ſince, I haue layd open in my former booke, let their ſayings be throughlie peruſed, and now ſhall ye ſeee a little whether they be not the verie naturall children of the Donatiſts in this poynt alſo. Thus writeth Gaudentius a Donatiſt Biſhop: Per opificem rerum omnium dominum Chriſtum omnipotens deus frabricatum hominem vt deo ſimilem, libero demiſit arbitrio. Scriptum eſt enim, fecit deus hominem &amp; dimiſit eum in manu arbitrij ſui. Quid mihi nunc humano imperio eripitur quod largitus eſt deus? Aduerte vir ſumme quanta in deum ſacrilegia perpetrentur, vt quod ille tribuit auferat humana praeſumptio, &amp; pro deo ſe inaniter iactet magna iniuria dei, ſi ab hominibus defendatur. Quid de deo aeſtimat qui eum violentia vult defendere, niſiquia non valet ſuas ipſe iniurias vindicare? God almightie
                (ſaith this Donatiſt) by the maker of all thinges the Lord Chriſt, left man to his owne
               
               free will being created as in the likenes of GOD. For it is written, God made man and left him in the power of his owne will. Why ſhould that bee plucked from me by humane authoritie, which GOD hath beſtowed vpon me? Marke moſt worthie man, how great ſacrileges are committed againſt God, that humane preſumption ſhould take that away which he hath giuen, and vainly boaſt it ſelfe for God with great iniurie to God, if he muſt be defended by men. What doth he eſteeme of God, which will defend him with violence, but that he is not able to reuenge the iniuries done vnto him? In what ſenſe this Donatiſt ſpake thus, may beſt appeare by the anſwere of Auguſtine. Secundum illas vestras fallaciſſimas vaniſſimáſ

Auferte quod ſana doctrina pro ſanitate orbis terrarum ſapienter per Apostolorum dicit, &amp; vt confirmetis in arbitrio tanto peiore quanto liberiore filios perditionis, delete quod ait vas electionis, omnis anima potestatibus ſublimioribus, ſubdita ſit: non eſt enim potestas niſi à deo. Quae autem à deo ſunt, ordinata ſunt. Quapropter qui reſiſtit poteſtati, dei ordinationi reſiſtit. Qui autem reſiſtunt, ipſi ſibi iudicium acquirunt. Principes enim non ſunt timori boni operis, ſed mali. Ʋis autem non timere potestatem? Fac bonum, &amp; habebis laudē ex illa. Dei enim miniſter eſt, vindex in iram ei qui male agit. Delete ista ſi potestis, aut ista, ſicut facitis, ſi non potestis delere, cōtemnite. Habete de his omnibus peſſimum arbitriū, ne perdatis liberū arbitriū, aut certe quia ſicut homines hominibus erubeſcitis, clamate ſi audetis, puniātur homicidia, puniantur adulteria, puniantur caetera quātalibet ſceleris, ſiue libidinis facinora ſeu flagitia. ſola ſacrilegia volumus à regnantiū legibus impunita. An verò aliud dicitis, cū dicitis, magna dei iniuria ſi ab hominibus defendatur. Quid de deo aestimat qui eū violētia vult defendere, niſi quia nō valet ſuas ipſe iniurias vindicare?
               
               
               Haec dicentes, quid aliud dicitis, niſi nulla hominis poteſtas cō
                  tradicat atque obstrepat nostro libero arbitrio, quando iniuriam facimus deo. That is, According to theſe your moſt deceiuable &amp; moſt vaine reaſons, the raines being let looſe to humane licentiouſnes, all ſinnes ſhall be let goe vnpuniſhed, no barres of lawes oppoſed, the boldnes to hurt, and luſt of rioting ſhall rage euery where, the King ſhall not with any threatnings or penalties reſtraine his kingdome, nor the Captaine the ſouldier, nor the Iudge any of his circuit, nor the maſter his ſeruant, nor the father his ſonne from the libertie and ſweetnes of ſinning. Take away that which ſound doctrine, for the health of the world ſaith wiſelie by the Apoſtle, and that ye may confirme the children of perdition in a will, by how much the more free, by ſo much the worſe, blot out that which the elect veſſell ſaith; Let euerie ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God. The powers that bee are ordained of God. Wherefore he that reſisteth the power, reſisteth the ordinance of God: and they that reſiſt ſhall receiue to themſelues damnation. For Princes are not a terrour for well dooing but for euill. Wilt thou not feare the power? Doo well and thou ſhalt haue praiſe of it: for he is the miniſter of God for wrath to take vengeance vpon the euill doer. Blot out theſe things if ye can, or elſe as ye doo, deſpiſe theſe thinges, becauſe ye cannot blot them out. Haue a will concerning al theſe things moſt euill, that ye may not loſe your free will. Or verely, becauſe as men ye are aſhamed before men, crie out if ye dare, let murtherers be puniſhed, let adulteries bee puniſhed, let other whatſoeuer enormities &amp; hainous deeds of wickednes &amp; luſt be puniſhed, wee will that only ſacrilegies go vnpuniſhed by the lawes of princes. Do ye ſay any other thing, when ye ſay, it is great iniurie to God, that he ſhould be defended by men? What doth he eſteeme of God which will defend him with violence, but that he is not able to reuēge the iniuries done to him? ſaying theſe things, what other thing ſay yee▪ but that no power of man muſt gainſay or mutter againſt our free will when we doo iniurie to God?
               
Thus farre Auguſtine? But let vs ſee further what Gaudentius ſaith, Sed belliferae pacis cruentaeque vnitatis ſe incolas iactant, audiant Dominum dicentem, pacem meam do vobis, pacem relinquo vobis: non ſicut ſeculum dat, ego do vobis. Seculi enim pax inter animos gentium diſſidentes armis &amp; belli exitu foederatur: domini Chriſti pax, ſalubri lenitate tranquilla, volentes inuitat non cogit inuitos. But they boaſt themſelues
                (ſaieth the Donatiſt) as inhabitants of warring peace, and bloudie vnitie. Let them heare the Lord, ſaying, My peace I giue vnto yee, my peace I leaue vnto ye: not as the world giueth, doo I giue. For the peace of the world, when the minds of the Nations are at diſcord, is couenanted or eſtabliſhed with armour and euent of warre: The peace of the Lord Chriſt being calme with healthfull lenitie inuiteth the willing, compelleth not the vnwilling. This Donatiſt addeth, Ad docendum populum Iſrael omnipotens Deus prophetis praeconium dedit, non regibus imper auit. Saluator animarum Dominus Chriſtus, ad inſinuandam fidem, piſcatores, non milites miſit. To teach the people of Iſrael almightie God gaue prophets to preach, he inioyned not Kings. The ſauiour of Soules the Lord Chriſt, to inſinuate faith ſent fiſhers and not Souldiers.
                Booke 2. againſt Gaudentius chapt. 11. 16. 26.
            Let vs ſee alſo what Petillian that other Donatiſt Biſhop ſaith, booke 2. againſt him Chapter 78. Charitas non perſequitur non aduerſus caeteras animas Imperatores inflammat. Charity doth not perſecute it doth not inflame or kindle the wrath of rulers againſt others.
                This was the out-crie of the Donatiſts againſt the godly teachers of the churches when the Emperours made any lawes to driue them from their madnes, that they had inflamed the rulers to perſecute them. Ieſus Chriſtus it a ſidem vener at facere, non vt cogeret homines, ſed potius inuitaret. Ieſus Chriſt came ſo to worke faith, not that hee might compell men, but rather inuite them. Quodſi cogi per legem aliquem vel ad bona licuiſſer, voſipſi miſeri a nobis ad ſidem puriſſimam cogi debuistis. Sed abſit, abſit a nostra conſcientia, vt ad nostram ſidem aliquem
               
               compellamus. If it were lawfull
                (ſaith this Donatiſt) that anie ſhould by the Lawe be compelled, yea euen vnto good things, you wretches ought to bee compelled by vs, to the moſt pure faith: but farre be it, farre be it, from our conſcience, that we ſhould compell anie vnto our faith. chapt. 83. Quid vobis est cum regibus ſeculi quos nunquam Chriſtianit as niſi inuidos ſenſit? What haue you to doo with the Kings of the Worlde which the Chriſtianitie hath neuer felt but enuious againſt it?
                Chapter. 92. Compare now the doctrine of our Browniſts and their ſayings with theſe former of the Donatiſts, and ſee if there bee anie difference? They ſay Princes are not to make Lawes for Church matters, Princes are not to reforme the Church by their authoritie: Princes are not to compell their ſubiects to the true worſhip of God by penalties: If Princes pleaſures are to be attended, where is the perſecution wee ſpeake of? None of the godlie Kings of Iudea durit compell anie to the couenant. The people of Chriſts Kingdome are ſpontanes, ſuch as come of their owne free accord, &amp;c. It were too long and tedious, to ſet foorth all the outcries of the Donatiſts, their glorying in ſuffering perſecutions for the trueth, their accuſations againſt the paſtors of Chriſts Churche and the Princes while they ſought to reſtraine their furie, the one by Gods word, the other by lawes; that they perſecuted, and therefore could not be the true Church which as they ſay is perſecuted, but neuer perſecuteth: reade the epiſtle of Parmenian, of Petilian, and of Creſconius. The Browniſts are not behinde them an intch in this matter, but crie out as faſt of Antichriſtian perſecutors, boaſting of their patience and ſufferings, calling themſelues the perſecuted remnant, the poore afflicted, &amp;c. Aug. anſwereth thoſe Donatiſts at large, I will recite but a little. Cum phreneticus medicum vexet, &amp; medicus phreneticum liget, aut ambo inuicem perſequuntur, aut ſi perſecutio quae malo ſit, non est, non vtiq, perſequitur medicus phreneticum, ſed phreneticus medicum. When the man that is in phrenſie dooth vex the phiſitian, and the phiſitian dooth binde him that is in phrenſie, either
               
               
               both doo perſecute each other, or elſe if that bee not a perſecution which is done to the euill, then verelie the phiſitian dooth not perſecute the phrantick or mad man, but the phrantick or mad man dooth perſecute the phiſitian. Againſt Creſconius Booke 4. Chapter. 51. his application is that the penall Lawes of the Princes were as the bands of the Phiſitian to binde the Phrenſie and furious outrage of the Donatiſts. And whereas they boaſted of patience, and woulde compell none. He anſwereth, that becauſe they bee not able to reſiſt ſo manie nations which were Catholike, they gloried of patience, that they compelled none to their part. Hee then addeth, Iſto modo &amp; miluus cum pullos rapere territus non potuerit, co lūbum ſe nominet. After the ſame ſort the Puttocke when he is fraid and can not ſnatch away the chickens, may name himſelfe a Doue.
                For he doth demaund of them what they haue not done which they were able? When Iulian the Apoſtata being Emperour, &amp; enuying the peace of Chriſt, ſhewed them fauour, and graunted to them Churches, what ſlaughters they committed? Likewiſe he ſheweth in many places what reuell their circumcellions made, which in companies walking with clubbes and ſtaues did ſpoile, and beate ſuch as light into their handes, vſing moreouer a ſauage crueltie in putting vineger and lime into mens eies when they had beaten them. And verely what is it which men of excéeding intemperate heate will not doe, if it bee once in their power againſt ſuch as they ſhall iudge to bee but as vile Idolaters and perſecutors of Chriſtes truth.
            The impatient heate of moſt Browniſtes is not vnknowē, but when the Kites for feare can not ſnatch vp the Chickens, muſt profeſſe the mekenes of Doues; as to ſay weare Chriſtes poore afflicted ſeruants, we be meeke and patient, we beare the croſſe. Where it is taught that priuate men are authoriſed to deale, and furie aboundeth, which things are among the Browniſtes: who is able to expreſſe the tragedies that would enſue, if power were not wanting in thē: the Princes may not ſtoppe their courſe, and who ſhall then

reſiſt? The Donatiſts abuſing the ſcriptures in their plentifull allegations, and finding that their groſeneſſe was detected much by the ſkill of artes, found fault that any thing ſhould be ſcanned by the rules of Logike. The Browniſtes are euen with them, if not beyond. In his firſt booke againſt Creſconius Chap. 14: Auguſtine reporteth the wordes of that Donatiſt thus: Veſtros Epiſcopos laudas quod nobiſcum velut dialecticis nolint habere ſermonem. Thou doeſt commend your Biſhoppes, that they refuſe to haue ſpeech or conference with vs as being Logicians.
                He anſwereth at large in ſhewing what Logicke is, and the worthie and neceſſarie vſe thereof in diſcuſſing matters of religion. Browne in the preface of his booke which (hee ſaith) ſheweth the life and manners of Chriſtians, calleth them ſophiſticall diuines which deale by the rules of Logicke. The Browniſtes with whome I deale, charge the ſtudents of the Vniuerſities, as trained vp in vaine and curious Artes. And what other cauſe ſhall euer be ſhewed of ſo barbarous an errour, but that they would not haue their matters tried by the rules which make manifeſt which is truth, and which is falſehoode. Thus haue I briefely laide open that the whole Donatiſme is maintained by the Browniſtes, and therefore I haue rightly termed them the Donatiſtes of England.
         
         
            
            An anſwere to Maſter Greenewood, touching read prayer.
            
            
               MAſter Greenewood in the preface of his booke, dooth ſhew, that the reaſons ſpread abroade in writing againſt read praier were his, which I did not knowe before now, and therefore bee taketh vpon him the defence of them. He would ſeeme to haue found out ſuch a deapth of ſpirituall wiſdome touching the holie exerciſe of prayer, and ſo reprooueth the groſenes of this age, that wee muſt eſteeme him for the aboundance of ſpirit, as an other Montanus. For whereas hee ſeemeth to charge this age onelie as groſſe in this poynt, in verie deede he accuſeth all ages, all Churches, and all the learned teachers that haue beene ſince the Apoſtles; ſo that in the gifts of the ſpirite he excelleth all. Hee ſaieth hee could yet neuer ſee it ſet downe, which is the true praier that onelie pleaſeth God. It is a ſtrange thing hee hath neuer heard, that whoſoeuer aſketh in faith, whether it be with preſcript forme, or otherwiſe it is the onelie true praier that pleaſeth God. Hee ſaieth I haue flien vpon him with bitterneſſe of ſpirite and carnall wiſdome, loding him and the faithfull with opprobrious titles. It is to no purpoſe that I ſhould anſwer againe with words, but when men ſhall once ſee throughlie into the fowlnes and dangers of Brow
                     •
                  iſme, and what filthie geare they ſpread abroade, they will th
                  •
               nke it requiſite and neceſſarie to call a ſpade, a ſpade: Donatiſme
               
muſt bee called Donatiſme, ſchiſme muſt bee called ſchiſme, and hereſies and fantaſies muſt haue their due titles. And now touching the defence he maketh, it is nothing but certaine ragges which he peeceth together to couer his nakednes, which alſo muſt be plucked from him. It ſeemeth he doth truſt to the ignorance, or raſhnes of ſome, which either cannot, or will not examine things aright.
            
               God is a ſpirit, &amp; to be worſhipped in ſpirit. I did &amp; do cō
               feſſe, yt this ſcripture doth cut downe all carnall worſhip, as diſagreeing from the nature of God: &amp; therefore may moſt fitlie be alleaged againſt ſuch as ſhall maintaine that the verie bodilie action in reading is the worſhip of God. But it is friuolous to applie it againſt praying after a preſcript forme: ſeeing a man may vpon a booke pray reading or after a preſcript forme with ſighes and groanes which procéed of faith. Maſter Greenewood termeth this a bodilie diſtinction. Doubtles if it be a bodilie diſtinction to affirme that the verie bodilie action of reading a prayer is not the worſhip of God (which we maintaine againſt the Papiſts in their lippe labour) I knowe not what Maſter Greenwood will allowe to bee ſpirituall. What manner of ſpirit is his? But now that he will put away all my diſtinctions by his affirming ſtill (for thoſe bee his wordes) and what? Euen the whole matter in queſtion betweene vs: who cannot ſee what a valiant champion he is, for how falſelie he ſaith he hath prooued, ſhall appeare? Then hauing ſtoutlie affirmed that which is in queſtion, he ſaith, and yet ſay you to applie this ſcripture thus againſt read prayer is friuolous. How commeth in this word (yet)? Doth it follow that I do not well in ſaying ſo, notwithſtanding you affirme the contrarie: but you haue a reaſon of great force, which is in theſe words, I appeale to all mens conſciences for the waight thereof. Shall the conſciences of all men bee made iudge whether that ſcripture bee rightlie applied? Nay, I appeale from the conſciences of the Browniſts. Now in the next words where I affirmed that a man may pray by the Spirite of GOD, with ſighes and groanes vpon a booke, or when

he prayeth after a preſcript forme, and therefore the application of that ſcripture is friuolous, his ſhiftes are as ſlender. For touching this clauſe, that I ſay, (or after a preſcript forme) he ſaith, I goe about to alter the queſtion at the firſt ſteppe. For as much as all our prayers ought to be vttered after a preſcript forme, euen that perfect rule and forme our Sauiour gaue to his diſciples and all poſterities. A great peece of work. By vttering after a preſcript forme, I meane when a man hath learned a prayer eyther of the ſcripture, or framed from thence, and can vtter it without the booke, as it is written.
            And whereas it can not be denied, but that many do pray feruentlie with ſighes and grones and teares, which reade the prayer vpon the booke, or haue it as we vſe to ſay, by hart: He anſwereth that I begge the queſtion. If a man do proue the cauſe by the effects, which I doe heere, it is no begging of the queſtion, but a firme proofe. Where any thing is burnt, there hath beene fire. Where there be ſighes and grones in prayer with inward comfort, there is faith, there is Gods ſpirit, but theſe are in ſome that reade their prayers vpon the booke, or vſe preſcript forme.
            Maiſter Greenewood thinketh he hath diſputed ſubtillie, and couered himſelfe, when he can ſay, ye alter the queſtion, ye begge the queſtion, ye aſſume the queſtion. Nowe touching the defence of his reaſons he brought. If thoſe ſighes and grones (ſaith he) were of faith, that would miniſter matter of prayer without a booke. This reaſon (as I ſayd) is by connection drawne from the force and effect of faith, and to make it ſtrong and good, I ſaid theſe two things muſt be added, yt faith needeth no outward helpe to miniſter matter of prayer, and that it can not ſtande or be ioyned with any outward helpes, which I ſaid are both hereticall. He ſaith he will lay the wordes againe before me, if peraduenture I may haue grace to call my ſelfe backe. I looke vpon them againe, and although I did not two yeares (as you vainely imagine) nor yet two daies, conſider of that one ſaying, yet can I not call my ſelfe back,

vnleſſe I be conuinced with the light of truth: and that ye ſay I ſhalbe, and will ſo confirme your ſayings by ſcriptures, that no peruerted ſpirit ſhalbe able to gaineſay or reſiſt. If the ſighes and grones were of faith, that would miniſter matter without a booke, for the ſcripture (ye affirme) teacheth euerie where that in praying, the ſpirit onely helpeth our infirmities, no other helpes mentioned, or can be collected in the preſent action of praier through the ſcripture. He hath ſēt into our harts the ſpirit of his ſonne crying Abba father, wee beleeue, therefore we ſpeake. From hence now Maiſter Greenewood concludeth that I haue erred, and from an idle braine, &amp; godles heart haue coined thoſe hereſies, becauſe I conſtraine the propoſition of the preſent action, in praying vnto a generall ſentence of all times and actions. This is the ſumme of your anſwere, that before prayer there neede helpes and outward meanes, but in the preſent action of prayer, onely the ſpirit doth helpe, let vs ſee howe true this is, and how it dooth excuſe yee from thoſe hereticall opinions, which ye goe about to wipe away with this diſtinction.
            Firſt whereas yee ſay that in the verie time and action of prayer, it is the ſpirit alone without any outward means, becauſe the ſcripture ſaith, God hath ſent into our heartes the ſpirit of his ſonne crying abba Father. I anſwere, that howſoeuer the ſcripture doth extoll or magnifie outwarde helpes, and meanes, yet when they are compared with God which worketh all in all by them, or when the ſcripture will ſet foorth the efficacie and worke to be his alone, they are either not mētioned, or elſe if they be mētioned, ſo caſt down as if they were nothing. God buildeth his Church by the miniſterie of men: yet he ſaith Paule planteth, Appollo watereth, but God giueth ye increaſe: So that neither he which plāteth is any thing, nor he that watreth, but God that giueth the increaſe. 1. Co. 3. And therfore to gather frō thoſe ſentences of ſcripture where the ſpirit of God is only mentioned to work praier, becauſe the work is his alone, yt there

neede or there may be no outward helps or meanes in the verie inſtant and action of praying, is farre awrie. For I would haue maſter Greenwood anſwere whether the voice of an other that prayeth, whether faſting, liſting vp the eyes and hands (which hee mentioned) or whether proſirating the bodie and kneeling be prayer it ſelfe, or outward meanes to make the prayer more feruent? Euerie ſimple man will laugh at him, if he ſay they be prayer it ſelfe, whereupon hee muſt bee forced to confeſſe they bee but outward helpes and meanes. Then aſke maſter Greenwood againe, whether a man be to faſt, to kneele downe, to proſtrate his bodie, to lifte vp his eyes and hands onely before the action of prayer, or in praying? If he anſwere, what a queſtion is that, what foole will ſay before? thoſe things are to be done in the very inſtant and action of prayer. Then all men may ſée that maſter Greenwood hath brought this, I will not ſay from an idle braine, for I ſhould not ſay true; but from an vnſound braine: that he may confirme by many teſtimonies of ſcripture, that the ſpirit onely helpeth our infirmities in the preſent action of prayer, that no peruerted ſpirit ſhalbe able to gayn-ſay or reſiſt. Yee ſée the ſpirit of trueth can reſiſt it, and proue that not onely before prayer, but euen in the very action of prayer, outward helps and meanes eſpecially for the ignorant and dull are needfull and good, and therefore the Browniſts ſpirit is a falſe ſpirit, which ſaith, The ſcripture teacheth euery where that in praying the ſpirite onely helpeth our infirmities, no other helps mentioned or can be collected in the preſent action of praier. In the next place, where hee had ſaid, A troubled heart is the pen of a readie writer, &amp; therfore needeth not a booke. I ſayd here can bee no good argument without an abſolute perfection in knowledge, cheerefulnes, direction, memorie and vtterance, and that many are ſo perplexed in their troubles of heart, that they cannot pray, which through helpe of outward meanes doe powre foorth tears and ſupplications: He will not allow this for any anſwere; but doth diſtinguiſh of troubled mindes. The troubled minde he ſpeaketh of,

               which is the pen of a readie writer, is (when the minde is preſently moued with the ſight of ſome ſin or vrged by other occaſion,) a broken ſpirite, a broken and contrite heart. Pſal. 51. and not the minde which in diſpaire or doubt is perplexed. Then I anſwere that he muſt allow theſe latter the helpes and outward meanes, that they may be rid of their doubt and perplexitie. Moreouer, there is no man ſo perfect in faith, but he hath great remnants in him of diſpaire and doubting. Why elſe did Dauid crie out, Correct me not in thy wrath, my bones are troubled. Pſal. 6. Caſt me not out from thy face Pſal. 51 While I kept ſilence my bones did weare away, my moyſture was turned into the drought in Summer. pſal. 32. Hath God forgottē to be merciful, hath he ſhut vp his compaſſiōs in wrath, pſal. 77. Whereupon it doth follow, that there is no man but may be fore troubled and perplexed with doubts, when the hand of God is heauie vpon him, and the ſight of his ſinnes doth terrifie him. It is not the glorie of faith to bee where there are us doubts of diſpaire or no perplexities▪ but to get the victorie ouer them when they do aſſaile it. Therfore the ignoranter ſorte in perplexitie need outward helps. The next part of mine anſwere, that ſuch as be troubled and perplexed and cannot pray, are holpen by a booke, and by other meanes, hee doth allow and agree vnto, So that wee make reading one thing and praying another. Who doubteth that they be two things? did not I ſet downe at the firſt that the bodely action of reading is not the worſhip of God? Then maſter Greenwood hath his deſire (ſeeing as he ſaith) wee cannot do both at once, he that prayeth ſpeaketh to God, My God why doeſt thou hide thy face from me? But the Prieſt may ſay, My booke whie art thou ſo euill printed? For when they reade, the heart cannot reaſon and talke with God. If the matter written in the booke bee a ſpeach directed vnto God, as In thee O Lord haue I put my truſt, let me neuer be confoūded, let maſter Greenewood or all the Browniſts in the world, bring anie coulour of reaſon to prooue, that a man cannot at the ſame

inſtant both vtter it with his mouth in reading, and pray it with his heart. Maſter Greenwood muſt denie this againe. For alas what ſtuffe is this? or els how did they ſing pſalms to GOD and reade them vpon the booke? how can a man heare and pray both at one inſtant? Then in the next where he ſaith, I did but aſſume the queſtion, in affirming that a man may pray by the ſpirit vpon a booke, &amp;c. his argument being thus, That none worſhip God but they which from the inward faith of the heart bring foorth true inuocation. This doo not they that reade vpon the booke while they pray. I ſayd he bringeth nothing to prooue the aſſumption, but that which is friuolous. For that it is ſayd, wee would haue men inſtead of powring foorth their hearts, to helpe themſelues vpon a booke. I anſwere, that we wiſh men to vſe the helpe of a booke that they may the better powre foorth their hearts to GOD, beeing ſuch as are not otherwiſe throughly able. And that we would haue men to fetch the cauſe of their ſighing and ſorrowing from another mans writing, euen in the time of their begging at Gods hand. I anſwered, how fondlie doo ye make that to bee the cauſe, which doth but manifeſt the cauſe? For that which we reade or heare doth but ſhewe vnto vs the miſerie which is within, and how it ſhall bee cured. Now let the reader obſerue how ſimple ſhifts he findeth here. The firſt is the difference betweene reading and praying, the one beeing a powring foorth of ſupplications, the other a receiuing into the ſoule ſuch things as wee reade. I pray ye tell me but this, when one heareth a prayer pronounced by another with whom he praieth, doth not his hearing receiue it into his ſoule, and at the very ſame inſtant alſo he doth powre it foorth as a praier to GOD? Are not the receiuing in and the powring foorth done both at once? How will he auoid the follie that I charged him withall, when receiuing in, and powring foorth, goe together at the ſame inſtant? But it is beyond all the reſt, that he ſaith, I graunt the whole queſtion, by granting that reading the prayers is not the prayer, but an helpe. Is it all one to aſke whether a man may be holpen to prayer by reading,

and whether the reading it ſelfe be praier? Hereupon hee alſo inferreth, that all our aſſemblies haue had none other inuocation of Gods name, but an helpe to teach them to power foorth their hearts. Then belike it followeth that whereſoeuer the helpe is, there is, or there can be no more: becauſe ſuch as read vpon a booke when they pray haue a good helpe to further them, therefore they doo not pray. Becauſe I ſaide it is an helpe to ſuch as bee not otherwiſe throughlie able: I muſt confeſſe that our whole Miniſterie is vnable; a reaſon worthie a Browniſt. There be other cauſes whie all Churches vſe preſcript forme, yea whereas all Miniſters be able to pray without a booke.
            Where I ſaide yee ſpeake fondlie to call that the cauſe which dooth but manifeſt the cauſe: yee replie that I haue forgotten mine atts, becauſe there be mo cauſes than one, there be inſtrumentall cauſes. I graunt there be moe cauſes than one. And it is certaine that the efficient cauſe is manifolde, if you meane by fetching the cauſe of their ſorrowing from the booke in the time of their begging at Gods hand, the efficient cauſe inſtrumentall: I would haue yee but anſwer whether the inſtrumental cauſe cannot goe with the action, but the action is ouerthrowne or diſgraced? I would alſo demaund whether it followe which yee collect, there is an inſtrumentall cauſe which is an helpe: therefore there is nothing elſe? Are theſe things other than trifles? I ſaide yee did anſwere nothing to that ſaying of our Sauiour, When ye pray, ſay our Father which art in Heauen, &amp;c. Luke 11. Yee ſeeme, that yee will not anſwer vnles I conclude from this place by Syllogiſme: but yet afterward yee do
                  •
               . And indeede what needeth a Syllogiſme where the words are of themſelues ſufficient, without anie further conſequence or collection. If our Sauiour commaund to ſay thoſe words praying, then is it moſt cleere, that to vſe a preſcript forme of words in praying is not idolatrie, nor a thing moſt deteſtable. But yee ſay yee manifeſted in your firſt writing, that our Sauiour did not commaund to vſe thoſe words when wee pray: but to pray according to

that forme. Saint Matthew ſay you and Saint Luke, keep not the ſame words, nor that number of words: hee ſaide not reade theſe words, or ſay th
                     •
                  ſe words by roate when ye pray. Theſe reaſons I haue ſlilie paſſed ouer, as you accuſe me. What reaſons? If it be a reaſon there is but one: for Chriſts ſpeech is plaine, when yee pray ſay thus: therefore we may vſe thoſe words. But muſt wee vſe them of neceſſitie and neuer none other? Not ſo, but wee may vſe, and it is neceſſarie for vs to vſe particulars, which are conteined in thoſe generals which are the ground and direction of all prayers. Your one reaſon or that which hath ſhew of reaſon is in this, that Saint Luke dooth omitte for thine is the Kingdome, &amp;c. And that in the fourth and fift petitions they expreſſe the ſame matter with ſome difference of words. As though the queſtion were about ſuch a preciſenes in words, that wee might not expreſſe the ſame petition in another phraſe, but it ceaſeth to be the ſame? Now where I conclude that it is therefore lawfull to vſe a preſcript forme of prayer, which is framed according to the Scriptures, in the aſſemblies. To this yee replie that becauſe no mans writings are without error, it is pernicious and blaſphemous doctrine which I collect. This yee affirme ſtoutlie, and for proofe bring nothing but thoſe ſtale cauills which I haue ſundrie times anſwered: and now yee will anſwer to the two places alleaged, Numb. 6. and Luke. 11. The prieſtes yee ſay were not commanded to vſe thoſe verie words of the bleſsing, when they bleſſed the people, the reaſon yee bring is from the Hebrew words which are as you ſay, Coh teborcu, thus ſhall yee bleſſe, Where the worde Coh is an aduerb of ſimilitude, as we ſay after this manner: which cannot be to ſay the ſame, but according to the ſame inſtructions. This word Coh is vſed throughout the Bible in this manner, in all the prophets, when they ſay, thus ſaith the Lord. To this I anſwer, firſt let all men of anie meane learning, in the Hebrew bee witnes, how vnfit Maſter Greenewood is to reaſon from that tongue, when hee can not ſo much as reade two words of it aright. For he ſaieth

               Coh teborcu, and it is Coh tebaracu. Then for the matter it ſelfe, this learned Hebrucian ſaith, that Coh being an aduerb of ſimilitude, as we ſay after the ſame manner, it cannot be to ſay the ſame, but according to the ſame inſtructions. Where ignorance &amp; boldnes are met together, what childrē they bring foorth? We muſt beleeue that the Lord when he ſaith, thus ſhalt thou bleſſe, and preſcribeth the words, willeth the Prieſts not to ſpeake the ſame words, but the like. And when our Sauiour ſaith, When ye pray, ſay thus, Our father &amp;c. It is as much as if he ſhould ſay, in any wiſe ſay not theſe wordes at any time, but the like. For, thus, is not the ſame, but the like. God ſayd to Moſes, I will ſend thee to Pharao, that thou maieſt bring the children of Iſrael out of Egypt. Moſes draweth backe, ſaying, when I ſhall come to the children of Iſrael and ſhall ſay vnto them, the God of your fathers hath ſent me vnto ye: If they ſhall ſay vnto me, what is his name? what ſhall I ſay vnto them? The Lord ſayd. Thus ſhalt thou ſay to the children of Iſrael, Eheie hath ſent me vnto ye. Moreouer, God ſayd to Moſes, Thus ſhalt thou ſay vnto them, The God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaak, the God of Iaacob hath ſent me vnto ye. Exod. 3. verſ. 13, 14, 15.
            
            Now, according to Maſter Greenwoods expoſition of Coh, Moſes is not commanded to ſay thoſe words but the like. If they ſhould demaund what is his name that hath ſent thee? he may not ſay Eheie hath ſent me, becauſe God ſayd Coh, that is thus, which is not the ſame words but the like. He might not ſay the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaak, the God of Iaacob hath ſent me vnto ye, which GOD ſaith is his name and memoriall for euer, becauſe God ſayd Coh, that is, thus ſhalt thou ſay, but hee muſt ſay the like words. He ſaith further, that Coh is ſo vſed in all the Prophets, when it is ſayd, thus ſaith the Lord. That is, GOD hath not ſpoken theſe very words, which wee bring, might the Prophets ſay, but the like. It is a like thing that Maſter Greenwood, or ſome other Hebrucian among the Browniſts, hath read ouer al the Prophets in the Hebrew tongue,

to finde how Coh is euerie where vſed, when he could not reade two words right. And now what ſhall we ſay of the Scriptures? the words, if wee ſhall beléeue the Browniſts, are not Gods words, but the words of the Prophets. Is this wholeſome doctrine? Did the Prophets bring any one word which GOD did not put into their mouth? I pray ye Maſter Greenwood, or any other Browniſt, tell me, did not God ſpeake in the Prophets all the words that they vttered, euen at the verie inſtant when they ſay, thus ſaith the Lord? How can it then ſo wickedly be ſayd, they were not the very ſame words which God ſpake, but the like, becauſe the aduerb thus doth ſignifie the like, and not the ſame? But hée rendreth a reaſon, which is, that we haue but the ſumme of their propheſies recorded vnto vs by the holie Ghoſt, and not all the words. Becauſe we haue not all the words, therefore haue we not the ſame in thoſe that are ſet downe? Did the holie Ghoſt vſe this word Coh, to giue vs to vnderſtand that there is written but an abridgement or ſumme of matters, and not the ſame words, that they were vttered in, but ſome ſuch like? Againe, did the holie Ghoſt recorde them, &amp; are they not all his words which are written in the ſumme of the propheſies ſet downe? Shall we beléeue this man? I doo beléeue him in this that he ſaith the holie Ghoſt did record them: for therein he ſpeaketh the trueth. But when he ſaith, that thus ſaith the Lord, is not theſe ſame words ſaith the Lord, but the like, becauſe thus is an aduerb of likenes, it is a vile ſaying. Is not the holie Ghoſt the Lord? If hée had ſpoken thoſe things before in moe words, and now recordeth them in fewer, ſaying, thus ſaith the Lord, doth not he ſpeake theſe fewer words which are written, as well as thoſe moe wordes which were vttered? Are they not then, thus ſaith the Lord, euen the verie ſame words which the Lord ſpeaketh, and not like? If ye make many ſuch expoſitions of words ye may leade me whether ye will. There is then another reaſon rendred to prooue that the Prieſts were not tied vnto thoſe wordes in bleſſing the people, namely, that in prayer they are bleſſed in the Pſalmes and in the
               
               Chronicles with many other words. And Eli bleſſed Hanna in other words. It is not the queſtion whether at any time the people might bee bleſſed in other words, in fewer, or in moe: but whether the Prieſts had not that forme preſcribed to vtter in bleſſing the whole aſſemblie, and whether it were Idolatrie to vſe thoſe preſcript phraſes of wordes? As likewiſe it is not maintained that when our Sauiour ſaith, ſay thus, that wee may not pray in other words, or expreſſe our petitions more particularlie: but that we may vſe thoſe words and ſentences as moſt excellent petitions. Againſt this Maſter Greenwood bringeth nothing in his words that followe. For Maſter Caluine neuer held it vnlawful to pray in that forme of words, though he teach truelie, that men are not ſo tied vnto it, that they may vſe none other. And therefore it ſtandeth firme and ſure that the forme of words in the Lords Prayer is to bee lawfullie vſed praying.
            In the next part Maſter Greenwood is in a great heate, and maketh an outcrie to call men to the beholding of an iniurie, which I, as he ſaith, as a godles man haue done him. Here (ſaith he) I muſt call all men that reade this fruitles diſcourſe, to be witneſſe, &amp;c. Indeede ye may well call it a fruitles diſcourſe, which ye call men that reade to beare witneſſe with ye: and let the reader iudge by your expoſition of Coh, whether it be not worſe than fruitleſſe which ye ſpread among the ignorant ſort, which are readie to ſucke in ſuch filthie dregges. The abuſe of my tongue to the defacing of Gods trueth, is that I ſayd, he calleth all men Idolaters. And to make the matter cléere that he ſpake not the words, but I my ſelfe, he maketh a briefe repetition how we fell into that matter. But before we procéede any further, I pray ye tell me what is the reaſon, that I hauing ſet downe your whole diſcourſe touching this poynt, ſo that you cannot denie but that I haue alſo ſet it downe truely, you forſake that and ſet downe by péece meale but ſome of your words, and reaſon from them: If I had ment in a godles manner wilfully to peruert your words, would I haue deliuered them

whole and together in print? It ſeemeth ye haue ſome hope that ſome men will reade your booke, which will not compare it with mine, or which being carried with blind heate, cannot. Now I craue no more of the reader but to marke the whole ſpeach which you deliuered, and mine anſwere to it, and to iudge indifferently. If Maſter Greenwoods words bee not ſuch as muſt needes include that which I haue collected, let me beare the blame for that matter, which is one of the leaſt. He ſaith I haue an euaſion to auoide this foyle, becauſe I ſayd I tooke it we reaſoned about ſuch groſſe Idolatrie, as a Church is to bee condemned and forſaken for which is defiled therewith. He ſaith he neuer reaſoned to that end in this whole diſcourſe. And I ſay then he muſt go from his owne words, which affirme that read prayer offered vp to GOD as a ſacrifice is Idolatrie: that to reade the prayer while one praieth, is a chaunging the worke of the ſpirit into an Idoll, a bondage and breaking of Chriſtian libertie, a thing moſt deteſtable, a deuice of Antichriſt. Let all men iudge by theſe ſpeaches what manner of Idolatrie was in queſtion betweene vs. Maſter Greenwood as if he had wonne the field, will needs put me to my raunſome, and aſketh what mends I will make him for this ſlandering? I anſwer, that as your victorie is but in a dreame, ſo my raunſome muſt be therafter. If I could ſée I had done ye wrong, I would be ſorie. Ye will haue no man free from ſuch foule Idolatrie, but yet no Idolaters. No Church is free ye confeſſe from all ſpot vpon earth. Hereupon ye growe againe into a newe heate, and charge me out of one mouth to giue contrarie ſentence, becauſe I call ye Donatiſts. Why man, are ye ignorant of this, that the Donatiſts did confeſſe all men to bee ſinners, and yet the arguments by which they would maintaine their ſchiſme could not bee ſtrong, vnleſſe they would maintaine a perfection, and ſome of their reaſons though they ment not ſo reached ſo farre. And ſo is it with you Browniſts. If one ſhould followe ye in all the groſſe abſurdities which will followe from your expoſition of Coh, thus ſaith the Lord, could you haue any way but to

proteſt ye did meane no ſuch thing▪ Wee may not looke what men proteſt they hold, but what doth followe of their reaſons, and then ye ſhall ſee that ſuch as be in ſchiſme and hereſie are with the blaſts of their ſwelling pride toſſed and hurled vpon contrarie Rockes. Now, whereas I ſayd the confeſſion of the Browniſts, that there is no Church in earth without ſpottes of Idolatrie, doth ouerthrowe the reaſons which they bring to condemne the Church of England. Becauſe they cannot argue thus, this is a fault, it is Idolatrie: therefore this or that aſſemblie which is ſpotted is no true Church. But they muſt prooue the Idolatrie to bee ſuch as deſtroyeth the faith, &amp;c. Maſter Greenwood would beare men in hand, that I reaſon as ſimplie, as to ſay, if there bée no true Church in earth without ſpots, then the Church of Rome is the true Church, for that hath many ſpots. I anſwere, that we doo not take it that the ſpots doo make it a true Church, but becauſe there bee onely ſpottes and not fundamentall errors? The fooliſh cauill here is that I aſſume that which I ſhould prooue. Doo I not prooue it by anſwering the vile and ſhameles ſlaunders of yours, when ye affirme euerie ſpot in our Churches to be blaſphemies and hereſies and abominations, and Egyptian ſores? You muſt prooue theſe your ſlaunders true, and I will ceaſe.
            Now we come to the arguments which were ſet down at the firſt. No Apocrypha is to be brought into the publike aſſemblies, all read prayer is Apocripha. Here you ſay I haue nothing to vtter, and yet oppoſe againſt both propoſicions, to royle the doctrine with my feete leaſt others ſhould drink of it. I ſayd your propoſition is falſe becauſe the expoſition of the ſcriptures by the preacher, and the prayers of the preacher are not canonicall, which your propoſition doth exclude. Your replie is, that the Sermons and prayers of of the Preacher be the liuely voyce of Gods owne graces which ye mention in your propoſition, and ſo neither Canonicall, nor Apocripha: and ſo not excluded. Touching the Paraphraſe vpon the Pſalmes in meeter, I holde not Canonicall in ſome reſpects: If you baniſh all writings that be

not Canonicall, then ye baniſh then. Your anſwere is, that it I will affirme them to be Apocrypha, as ye ſay I cannot but doe; you will prooue they are not to be brought into the publike aſſemblies. Your proofes doe follow: Firſt no mans writings are giuen by the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit, whome alone we are to heare. No mans writings are without errors and imperfections: The Church is builded vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets: If we might bring in mens writings, then al mens writings which are agreeable to Gods word. No mans writings carie that maieſtie that the pen of the holy ghoſt. No mans writings are authentike confirmed by ſignes and wonders. The ſcripture is all ſufficient; al men muſt walk by that one rule: To think there were not rules enough preſcribed by the Lorde for his houſe, is blaſphemous and papiſticall. Then ye ſay, the gifts to propheſie, are not Apocryphall, and ſo ye conclude your propoſition: that onely Gods word and the liuely graces of his holy ſpirite are to be offered vp vnto him in the publike aſſemblies. Then touching your aſſumption: I ſayd I ſee not how our ſpeech to God ſhould be called Apocrypha. Ye replie yt it anſwereth not you, which do not holde an other mans writing to be our ſpeech vnto God. Finally becauſe I ſaid that Apocrypha is that which is not Gods vndoubted worde vnto vs: yee ſay I haue ouerthrowen my ſelfe and caſt out all read prayer, in as much as I deny them to be Canonicall. And ſo affirming that I haue not in both writings made one direct anſwer to this moſt firme propoſition: Onely the Canonicall ſcriptures and liuely voice of Gods own graces are to be brought into the publike aſſemblies for doctrine and prayers: But mens writings are neither Canonicall, nor the liuely voice of Gods owne graces. Now maſter Greenwood hauing thus played the man in erecting (as he ſuppoſeth) ſo mighty a piller, that cannot be ſhaken, could content himſelf to go no further. I might end here ſaith hee with this vaine man, conſidering the whole matter is proued againſt him: And all that ſolloweth but repetitions of the ſame cauills: but that I muſt cleare
               
               my ſelfe of his vnconcionable ſlaunders. Hee 
                  ••••
               mphing thus fully, what ſhall I doe now? I aunſwere, firſt that hee is much deceiued and would deceiue others: as it is written, The deceiuers ſhall wax worſe and worſe, deceiuing and being▪ deceiued. For like as one that among many Apples doth hide and ſell one Crab, ſo he among many true principles doth bring in one falſe concluſion which deceiueth his Schollers. For if he did reaſon thus, wee muſt heare onely the voice of Gods ſpirite, therefore all things in the Church are to be tried by the voice of the ſpirit. No mans writings are without errors and imperfections: therefore mē cannot ground vpon them any further than they be conſonant to the Canonicall ſcriptures. The Church is builded vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, therfore our faith is to reſt no further vpon the ſayings and writings of men, than they be prooued by the doctrine of the Apoſtles &amp; Prophets; he ſhould conclude a truth which is vnanſwerable. But now where maſter Greenwoods concluſiō is after this ſorte, therefore nothing but the Canonicall ſcriptures, and the liuely voice of Gods graces is to bee brought into the publike aſſemblies; he concludeth falſely, as ſhall appeare. For if nothing but the perfect rule it ſelfe is to bee brought into the Church: If nothing done by man which hath errors in it, is to haue place in the aſſemblies: If nothing but eyther ſuch or that which is the liuely voyce of Gods owne graces is to be vttered in the congregation; then muſt bee taſt foorth not onely al written prayers: but alſo ye whole bible, vnles it be in ye Hebrew &amp; Greeke, with the Sermons and praiers of the Paſtors. For there is no tranſlation of the Bible without errors, and the bookes are thus farre mans writing reſpecting onely the tranſlation. And furthermore we decide not controuerſies by any tranſlation of the Bible, but by the authentike copies of the Hebrew and Greek, in one of which the olde teſtament is ſet downe by the Prophets, in the other the new teſtamēt by the Apoſtles. So that your concluſion doth not ſhut out onely the Pſalmes in méeter, but the whole ſcriptures; vnles you will be ſo bolde as

to ſay that tranſlations be without errors, and ſo the perfect rule.
            And now touching the ſecond part, will Maſter Greenwood bee ſo vnwiſe as to affirme that the errours in the Sermons and in the prayers of the Paſtors, bee the liuely voyce of Gods owne graces? He will aſſuredly denie it: for the graces of GOD (all ſimple men know) bring not foorth errors. Then let him marke his concluſion, no mens writings are without errours and imperfections, therefore no mens writings are to be brought into the publike aſſemblie: is not this concluſion as ſtrong, no tranſlations of the Bible, no Pſalmes in meeter, no Sermons, nor Prayers of the Paſtors, are without errors and imperfections, therfore none of theſe are to be brought into the publike aſſemblies? Is there any ſo voide of ſenſe, that can not taſt howe ſower this Crabbe is, which Maiſter Greenewood conueieth in among ſo many ſweete Apples? But he replieth further to confirme his matter by argument thus, if anie mens writings may bee brought into the publike aſſemblies, then al mens writings which are thought to be agreeable to Gods word, may be brought in. To prooue the conſequence of this propoſition, he ſaith; If God commaunde any to be brought in as being agreeable to the Scriptures, then by that commaundement all are to bee brought in that be agreeable: If there be no commandement, then none are to be brought in. I anſwere that God hath commaunded that in the Church all thinges bee done for edification, now the prayers being the ſame, being holy &amp; good, are of like maieſtie &amp; dignitie in thēſelues vttred by him that conceaueth them, or from a preſcript forme, the matter reſteth not in that, but in the faith and feruencie of thoſe that pray, there be errours and imperfections, as well in the one as in the other, but to auoide inconuenience, and for the benefite of the ſimpler ſort, a preſcript forme is needefull, &amp; ſo farre commaunded. Then ſee how friuolous this concluſion is, that ſo all mens writinges which are thought to be agreeable to the word, are to bee brought in,

ſeeing that which is conuenient in ſome, is not conuenient in all. His reaſons which follow are in effect all one with the former, and prooue not that concluſion of his, to ſhut foorth the preſcript forme of prayer. Let the Browniſt now ſet the word Apocripha aſide, which is but a woord, and not of the Scriptures, and go to the matter it ſelfe, drawing by firme concluſion▪ that nothing is to be allowed any place in the Church which is not the perfect rule it ſelfe, in writing, or without errours vttred in ſpeech, and I will yéelde. But this ſhall all the Browniſtes in the world be neuer able to do, as I haue ſufficiently ſhewed before. What then, or where is his glorie and victorie which he boaſteth off, to be ſuch that hee needeth to proceede no further? But nowe I woulde haue the reader to vnderſtande my meaning aright, and how I argue: leaſt any ſhould thinke I compare the hauing the Bible in a tranſlation, and the prayers and Sermons of the Paſtors, with the preſcribed forme of prayer, to be of but equall or like neceſſitie. The ſumme of that I ſet downe is to this effect, that it is falſe which Maiſter Greenewood ſtandeth to prooue, namely that nothing with errour in it is to bee brought into the publicke aſſemblies, ſeeing there is a neceſſitie of hauing the ſcriptures in a tranſlation: there is alſo a neceſſitie of hauing the ſermons and Prayers of the Miniſters, and yet errours in both, that which is of neceſſitie to be had, may not bee caſt foorth, becauſe of imperfections and errours: then alſo preſcript forme of prayers, though not of neceſſitie, yet for conueniencie vnto edification, is not to be caſt foorth, becauſe of imperfections, being not to increaſe, but to diminiſh the errours in praying.
            The next argument is this, Wee muſt doe nothing in the worſhip of God, without warrant of his word. Read prayers haue no warrant of his woorde.
            
            How falſe this aſſumption is, namely, That to reade a prayer when one doth pray, or to followe a preſcript forme, hath no warrant in Gods woord, I haue ſhewed

by ſundrie ſcriptures and reaſons, and anſwered al the ſhifts brought againſt them, for which I referre the Reader to my former booke.
            Maiſter Greenewood preſſed with the waight of truth, and finding he had vttred groſſe matter, could be content (but that as he ſaith to anſwere vnconſcionable ſlaunders) to ſtay in the firſt argument: as hauing wonne the field, but yet he goeth on, and by vaine ſhiftes wil doe as well as he can to couer his fault. Firſt he accuſeth me that not hauing anſwered one reaſon, I haue with much euill conſcience (as the handling ſheweth) peruerted them, ſaying hee will leaue them to be iudged of them that ſhall ſee his writing: and ſeeing I would not Print it, he will anſwere my chief obiections. Touching this I anſwere, that your words are manie, and I eſteemed it a wearieſome matter to write them all, accounting it ſufficient to note your reaſons, but looke whatſoeuer ye complayne off, that I haue peruerted and done ye wrong in, ye ſhall haue them in thoſe pointes fully and wholy deliuered, that all the worlde may ſee and iudge betweene vs, whether I haue wilfully, and vnconſcionably, and as a godleſſe man (as ye accuſe me) charged ye with any one thing which your words doe not containe.
            Now to proceede to your replie: Firſt, yee ſay that I graunt your Argument is ſounde, if yee put difference between reading vpon the booke, and that which one hath learned out of the booke. For by your owne confeſſion (ſay you) God hath not giuen any commandement to read prayer, and ſo it hath no warrant. Hereupon yee charge mee, that as an vnconſtant man, I call back againe that which I had graunted: I ſaide I did not remember that euer I did read in the holie Scriptures that God commandeth the prayer ſhall bee read vpon the Booke, If I haue called now to remembrance, where it is reade, It were no vnconſtancie to ſay now, there is commaundement. But in deede I doe not remember I haue euer reade any ſuch commaundement. But now you boaſt of your gaines by this confeſſion, ſaying that I graunt then there is no warrant. Lay all my words

together, and yee may put your gaine in your eye, and ſee neuer the worſe. I ſet downe firſt of all that it is great audatitie, to affirme that there is no warrant of the word, for read prayer, ſeeing there be ſundrie teſtimonies to warrant the ſame, as I haue ſhewed: for the Lord preſcribed a forme of bleſſing, and commaunded the Prieſts ſo to bleſſe Num. 6. He preſcribed a forme of prayer for the people at the offering the firſt fruites, and cōmaunded thē to vſe it Deutr. 26 The Pſalme for the ſabaoth was commaunded to bee ſong, the Pſalme 22. was to bee ſong euerie morning, and theſe they were tied vnto by expreſſe commaundement, though not to the booke, becauſe it is more commendable to haue them by heart. And the Lorde dooth not tye a man to that which is leſſe cōmendable. This is the ſumme of that reaſon which I vſed, from whence there is warrant to followe a preſcript forme. Maſter Greenewood vrgeth this, if there be no commaundement, then there is no warrant: and affirmeth it to bee inconſtancie to ſay there is no commaundement to reade praying, and yet ſome warrant for it by the word. I haue anſwered, that God tied the Prieſts and people vnto ſome preſcript formes, though not preciſelie to the booke. And though that were legall, and no ſuch commandement to tie men of neceſſitie: now yet it ſheweth the thing to be holie and lawfull. Further I adde, if wee reſpect the matter as we ſay in the Theſe, or for a generalty there is no commandement: for then it ſhould bee of neceſſitie and not for conueniencie. But if we regarde it in the Hypotheſe for circumſtances in particularitie, there is commaundement: as thus, God hath commaunded thoſe thinges too bee done which ſerue as helpes for edification, or be moſt conueuient. Then where the ſtate of anie man, or the ſtate of the aſſemblies is ſuch, as that preſcript forme of prayer is conuenient and needefull for edification, there it is commanded. Now let the reader obſerue againe your words, which are that al our miniſters muſt leaue reading their ſtincted praiers vpon the booke, or elſe ſtand vnder Gods wrath, and all that ſo praye with them. Maſter Greenewood complaineth of

great iniury, whē I gather from his words, that he condemneth all Churches, becauſe hee knoweth that is a matter ſufficient alone to bewray the wickednes of Browniſme. Now if all our Miniſters which pray vpon the booke, and the people, that pray with them ſtand vnder the wrath of God for this thing, then cannot they be the Church of God: for GOD loueth his Church; and all Churches haue preſcript formes of prayer which their Miniſters vſe: therfore they all ſtand vnder Gods wrath. But they doo it ignorantlie, will he ſay; and ſo (ſay I) did all our Churches, vntill his papers came abroad, and manie haue not as yet ſeene them: and ſome that haue ſeene them are not perſwaded, and ſo are ignorant ſtill. The next thing ye deale with, is the Argument which I drawe from the ſinging Pſalmes vpon the booke: it is ſo cleere they did ſing them vpon the booke, that the Browniſt himſelfe cannot denie it. It is alſo moſt manifeſt they did ſing them (as hee alſo now confeſſeth) to God, for ſo are we commaunded in many places, ſing praiſes to God. Then further he that offereth vp praiſe to God reading, it cannot be gainſaide, but that he offereth vp a ſpirituall ſacrifice to God reading. Yea praiſe is one parte of prayer: and it is as hard a thing to ſpeake praiſes to God vpon the booke, as to craue by petitions vpon the booke, and as ſpirituall a worke; and I may ſay a more high ſeruice: where is then that groſſe fantaſie of Maſter Greenewood, which becauſe reading is one thing; and ſpeaking to God is another, ſaith a man cannot both read and ſpeake to God at once. He cannot ſay O my God when he readeth, but O my booke why art thou ſo euill printed? I argue if the people of God in olde time, did both reade the Pſalmes vpon the booke, and ſpeake vnto the Lord at the ſame inſtant: how ſhould it not now bee both poſſible and lawfull, for to ſpeake vnto God in praiers while one readeth? Hée ſaieth, I denie your Argument. I ſay that is not ſufficient to denie the Argument: let vs therefore ſée the reaſons of the deniall. Admitte that ſinging were a part of praier (ſayeth he) yet dooth it not follow that all praier may bee read vpon

the booke: we muſt take this vpon your bare word, at leaſt ſuch as will, may beléeue yée. I ſtand to affirme that one part of praier is as ſpirituall a worke as another; thereupon I alſo affirme, that if one part may bee read vppon the booke, and no turning the worke of the ſpirite into an Idoll, no ſt
                  •
               nting the ſpirite, no quenching the ſpirit, no Idolatrie. no hindrance, but that hee which readeth may ſpeake vnto God: it may be ſo in any other part. And let vs ſee what hee will bee able to diſprooue this withall? But hee ſaieth I ſpeake like an ignorant man, to ſay that ſinging is praier, becauſe they be two diuers actions and exerciſes of our faith. The one neuer read for the other, nor ſaide to be a parte of the other, throughout the Scriptures, but are plainelie diſtinguiſhed, As I will praye with the Spirite, I will pray with vnderſtanding, I will ſing with the ſpirit, I will ſing with vnderſtanding, ſaith Saint Paul. I anſwer you could no where more vntimelie accuſe mee of ignorance, then where your owne ſpeech in this and that which followeth next, is patched vp with errors, almoſt as thick as the patches vpon a beggars cloake. And for anſwere I ſay, firſt, that Saint Paul dooth diſtinguiſh them there is great reaſon, not onelie becauſe the verie ſinging it ſelfe is not praier, no more then reading or ſpeaking: but alſo that there bee manie praiers which are not ſong, and manie Pſalmes and ſongs, which are no formes of praier; nor the ſpéech directed to God: a prayer that is no pſalme is neuer called a pſalme, nor any reaſon why it ſhould: but a Pſalme that is a praier, is called both a Pſalme and a praier. The Pſalme 86. is called Tephillah a praier, and conſiſteth of ſundrie petitions. The Pſalme 90. is ſo called, being the praier of Moſes. Pſalme 102. is called Tephillah leaaui, the praier for the poore, when hee is in perplexitie, and powreth foorth his meditatiō before the Lord. The people praying for Chriſts Kingdome did vſe to ſay, Hoſanna, Bleſſed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord. Pſal. 118. The Pſalme 50. and 119. with many other conta ne petitions, almoſt in euery verſe, which if a man did pray or deſire them earneſtly

ſinging, it was no Idolatrie: ſinging I graunt is not called praier, but men might ſing Pſalmes to God, and were commanded, which contained praiſes and petitions: but they were giuen to the Church, to be ſong or read in ye forme of praier (ſaith he) but denieth yt this was to be done praying. He not only confeſſeth they were to ſing thē vnto God, but alſo ſaith the Lord keep me frō ſuch an error, as to denie that: &amp; yet euē in this cōfeſſion falleth into as groſe a matter. for what can bee more abſurd, than that a man ſhould vtter and ſpeake euen vnto God that which is a prayer and yet might not pray▪ as when out of the Pſalm. 118. praying for the kingdome of Chriſt, they cried Hoſanna, bleſſed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord: or when for ſome ſpeciall benefite the whole Church was to ſing prayſe to God, and had a preſcript forme deliuered vnto them: were they to mocke with God, and not to ſpeak prayſes vnto him indeede from the heart and with chearefulnes▪ or did God commaund them to doe two things which cannot bee done at once▪ or wil any deny that many in ſinging, (though the ſinging it ſelfe be not praying) doe giue hearty thankes to God where thankſgiuing is expreſſed, and craue earneſtly when they vtter petitions▪ Maſter Greenewood doth grieuouſly complaine of me for doing him foule wrong in ſaying he denieth that the Pſalmes are to be ſung to God. And what other thing in effect doth he vtter here, when hee ſaith they were not to vtter the wordes of a Pſalme to God praying? But I willſet downe his firſt words which are theſe. The ſame may be ſayde for the hundreth and ſecond Pſalme: for although ſome haue taken it as a prayer of the Prophet when he was in affliction, yet may I graunt with you to be taken in the future tenſe, and auoyd that ſuperſtition you would fall into, for if it had beene giuen vnto the Church to haue beene read as a prayer vnto God, it ſhould haue beene ſaide, O Lord heare our prayer, and let our crie come vnto thee. And therefore it is manifeſt that this Pſalme was giuen to the Iſralites in time of their captiuitie at Babylon, or ſome other ſuch calamitie, to comfort

and inſtruct them how to ſettle themſelues, and powre foorth their prayers before the Lord. But howe will you prooue that the people were to ſay ouer theſe wordes vnto God▪ for wee may ſee the like by Habbacuc, preſcribing the people a forme of prayers to comfort themſelues, and deliuered it to be ſung in the aſſemblies. Moreouer after manie other wordes maſter Greenwood ſayth thus: And that ſinging of Pſalmes is no part of prayer we may ſee by the exhortation which the Apoſtle vſeth to the Epheſians, ſaying Speake vnto your ſelues in Pſalmes and Hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs: And to the Colloſ. where it is ſayde Let the word of God dwel in ye plenteouſly in al wiſdome teaching &amp; admoniſhing your ſelues in pſalmes &amp; hymnes and ſpiritual ſongs. And further we reade that Chriſt our Sauiour did giue thanks and then ſing a Pſalme after the inſtitution of the Lords Supper: for that ſinging is a reioyſing our ſelues, and inſtructing our ſelues.
            Now let the reader iudge, by comparing that which I haue written in my former booke with theſe words of his, whether I or he be the godles man which dealeth by vnconſcionable ſlaunders, and with much euil conſcience. Maſter Greenwood denying the vſe of preſcript forme when wee ſpeake vnto God, and I alleadging the Pſalmes, demandeth how I wil prooue that the people were to ſay ouer thoſe wordes vnto God▪ And after as you ſee to prooue that the wordes were not to be vttered or ſaid ouer to God praying▪ he alleageth the ſayings of Paule, Speaking to your ſelues and inſtructing your ſeluesin Pſalmes and Hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs, leauing out in both places the latter ende of the ſentence of ſinging to the Lord. Now when I haue prooued that the verie wordes of ſome Pſalmes were to be ſaid ouer to God, becauſe the ſcripture is cleare in many places, Sing Pſalmes to God, ſing prayſes to God, &amp;c. and charged him with denying that the Pſalmes are to be ſung to God contrarie to ſuch expreſſe commandement, and blamed him for leauing out the parte of the ſentence which maketh againſt him, he crieth ſhame vpon me. But maſter Greenwood
               
it is the light of Gods word, and the waight thereof which doth preſſe ye, and cutteth downe all vngodly fantaſies, and not I. You confeſſe now, becauſe the ſcripture is plaine, that the Pſalmes were to be ſung to God, and yet ye did aſke how I would prooue the people were to ſay ouer the words. Then it followeth that the verie preſcript forms of wordes were to be ſaide ouer to God by your confeſſion, which is the whole matter that I haue ſtoode to prooue. And now chuſe whether you will denie that Pſalmes were to be ſung to God, or confeſſe that thoſe verie wordes of the Pſalmes and the preſcript formes were to be ſaid ouer vnto him in ſinging.
            What will he ſay now? This he will ſay, that they were in thoſe words to be ſong vnto God, but not praying: for he ſaith I muſt proue the Church did vſe to reade the pſalmes. for praying, I wonder how a man can ſpeake to God the ſentences which are praiers, and not praying. Againe I would haue any Browniſt ſhew mee what ſpeach wee can haue to God which is not praier: if he ſay a man dooth ſpeak to God in giuing him thankes and praiſe, in acknowleging his benefites, in aſcribing vnto him all wiſdome, power, glorie, goodnes, bountifulnes, faithfulnes, and mercie. A man dooth ſpeake to God, when hee confeſſeth his ſinnes, when he complaineth of the iniuries and wrongs of others: I confeſſe, and I ſay withall, that they be all of them parts of praier. Why dooth a man giue thankes and praiſe, and mention Gods benefits; but to ſupport his faith, and hope that he ſhall receiue further, and to moue the Lord to continue ſtill good vnto him, or ſuch like? Why doo we ſpeake vnto him of his glorious power, wiſdome, mercie and trueth, but that our faith and praier dooth reſt vpon thoſe pillers? Why doo we confeſſe our ſinnes, but as intreating for pardon; and what doo we rehearſe the vniuſt outrage of our aduerſaries, but to procure his iuſt defence and protection: But hee demandeth what this maketh for reading praiers framed by men: I anſwer to the ſame effect which I haue euer done, that this is one of the pooreſt cauilles that may

be among a thouſand. We reaſon not about the matter of praiers, but about the reading: for if the matter bee corrupt and naught, the pronouncing or the reading cannot make it better. If the matter be erronious, it is no more authentick pronounced, then read: if it be pure and good pronounced, the reading cannot hurt it, or make it vnpure. The reading it ſelfe is not vnpure when we ſpeake to God: for then ſhould not the Pſalmes haue béen ſong vpon the booke vnto him. Who is ſo ſenceles then as not to ſée this concluſion to follow, to vtter a preſcript forme of words, in a Pſalme when one ſpeaketh to God is no ſinne. Therefore to followe a preſcript forme of words in any godly praier, when one praieth is not ſinne; for where ſhall we finde the ſinne? If it be in following a preſcript forme, it ſhould haue béen vnlawfull to followe it in the Pſalmes. If it be in the matter, becauſe there bee errors in all mens writings; and therefore to bee caſt foorth: then I ſay the errors, and not the reading is in the fault, and for which only there muſt be the caſting forth, and ſo we muſt caſt foorth the praiers of the preachers. To his next words, I anſwer that it is not the repeating ouer the ſame godlie petitions againe euery day, that maketh it the ſacrifice of fooles, but when men doo it of cuſtome without faith and feruent affection: for if a man with faith and zeale pray euery day the ſame praier to God, it is acceptable. The reſt of his words are not worth the repeating, and yet he concludeth moſt falſly that read praier hath no warrant in Gods word.
            The next Argumentis this, We may not in the worſhip of God receiue any tradition, which bringerh our libertie into bondage: read praier vpon commandement is a tradition that dooth bring our libertie into bondage.
            
            Againſt this I oppoſed that Moſes, the Prophets, and our Sauiour gaue preſcript formes of praiers, and if the very following a preſcript forme impoſed by commandement, be ſo deteſtable a thing, how are not they charged with this heinous ſinne? He anſwereth that here is a great ſtorme, and yet nothing but winde; doo ye not know the wind may

be ſo great, as to blow downe the houſe vpon your head, eſpecially when the blaſt of truth commeth againſt your building, which ſtandeth vpon the rotten pillers of errours. The counterfaite zeale of Cayphas againſt the trueth, ought not to ſtay any man from being earneſt for the truth. But now to the matter, your woonted ſong was heretofore when ſuch preſcript formes were alleadged, prooue that thoſe wordes were to be ſaide ouer to God: but now being conuinced, and confeſſing that ſome Pſalmes were ſong to God, and for feare leaſt bidding mee prooue againe that the preſcript forme was followed, when they ſpake to GOD, I ſhould againe charge ye openly to denie the ſinging of Pſalmes to God, which I haue ſhewed yee doe couertly, ye ſeeke another ſhift, and ſay your Minor propoſition (which is that I ſtand to diſprooue) ſpeaketh of the reading for praying, and not of the forme of prayer. This is poore ſtuffe, ſeeing we reaſon about preſcript forme and reading the ſame, praying. I do not ſay that the reading it ſelfe is praying: but I haue prooued, that they went together, and whether there were cōmandement to followe the preſcript formes or not, in the bleſſing, for the Prieſtes to vſe. In the prayer preſcribed for the people to ſay at the offring the firſt fruites, and in ſome of the Pſalmes, whether it be not alſo lawful to ſay the Lords prayer praying, let wiſe men iudge. Nowe where as I ſaide the Browniſtes doe condemne all Churches by theſe three arguments againſt read prayers, Maiſter Greenewood at this is in no ſmall heate as his ſpeech doth ſhewe: for if hee coulde dippe his words tenne times deeper in gall, it appeareth hee woulde not ſpare. I truſt (ſaith he) your madneſſe will appeare vnto all men, the poyſon of Aſpes is vnder your tongue. But Maiſter Greenewood, If I haue ſaide the truth which is iuſtifiable by your owne ſpeeches, your ſober minde is not to bee boaſted off. And if your ſentence include all Churches, what milke and honie doth flow from vnder your lippes? Heere is much a doe, this man layeth about him as if he were halfe madde: but that he is blindfolde, I could not eſcape ſome

ſounde blowes. Here he hath vp the begger with his clappe diſh, and the Prieſt with his Maſſe booke, canueſing ouer the Paternoſter for their bellie. Here he ſaith I breath out my accuſtomed lies, ſlaunders, and raylings, calling them Browniſts and Donatiſts, here he deteſteth Donatus his hereſies: Browne, and the Browniſts, he ſaith are ours, hee willeth mee to remember who is the Father of ſuch vntruthes, when I ſay they condemne al reformed Churches, but becauſe my conſcience (as hee ſaith) did witneſſe I had wrongfullie charged him, and for him all true Chriſtians, I bring it in by neceſſarie conſequence. Now if the heate be any thing paſt heare a little what I ſaye, ſhewe that I haue any way ſlaundred ye, or rayled vpon yee, in that I haue termed you Browniſts and Donatiſts: and let mee haue open ſhame among all men. I haue affirmed that the very pith of all your matter is from Maiſter Brownes bookes, conuince mée therein if yee can, I haue now publiſhed that Browniſme and Donatiſme are all one: let any Browniſt in the land confute me. The theefe will not abide to be ſo called, but will ſay I defie all theeues: doth that cleare him when he liueth by theeuerie? what are you the better to ſay I deteſt the hereſies of Donatus, and yet holde all that he helde, and know not what ye ſay, nor what the hereſies of Donatus were, more then doth a poſt: ſhew openly that ye renounce thoſe thinges I haue noted to bée the furies of the Donatiſts, &amp; then yee may crie out that ye are ſlaundred.
            And now for condemning al Churches, will ye denie that which is concluded by neceſſarie conſequence from your words? Is that againſt conſcience which is brought in by neceſſarie conſequence? Ye would ſeeme to make light of it in this reſpect, that a multitude is not to bee followed to doo euill, when ye condemne all Churches: but yet it doth ſting ye ſo neere, that by no meanes ye can abide to heare of it. Thus I did reaſon, and thus I reaſon ſtill without any witneſſe of conſcience againſt me. You affirme preſcript formes of prayer brought into the publike aſſemblies, to bée

the changing the worke of the ſpirit into an Idoll, a tradition breaking Chriſtian libertie, and therefore a thing moſt deteſtable, a dead letter which doth quench the ſpirit; but all reformed Churches haue preſcript forme of prayer impoſed: therefore yee condemne all Churches. I am glad your booke may bee ſeene of all men, that they may iudge the ſoundnes of that anſwere by which ye would cleere your ſelfe. Ye cannot goe from your firſt words, they be ſpread in the hands of ſo many, but ye ſhould ſhame your ſelfe. Ye replie therefore againe, that the true Churches might erre in this, and yet remaine Churches of God. This is ſtrange that ignorance ſhould excuſe men that worſhip an Idoll in ſtead of God, that take away the Chriſtian libertie from the conſciences of men, and doo that which is moſt deteſtable. What doo the Papiſts more than theſe? or what can they bee charged withall which is worſe than that which is moſt deteſtable? And haue ye not ſet downe now in this your booke in replying vpon the ſecond Argument, that all our Miniſters muſt leaue reading their ſtinted prayers, or elſe ſtand vnder Gods wrath and all that pray with them? How are the Miniſters and people of other Churches priuiledged from ſtanding vnder Gods wrath, hauing read prayers, impoſed leiturgies, and as you terme them ſtinted prayers? or tell me, are they the Churches of God that ſtand vnder his wrath? Now remember who is the father of lyes. Well, your meaning was not to condemne the Churches, nor to meddle with them. Why then doo ye giue ſuch ſentence of condemnation which reacheth vnto them? Tel me but this, is there any Browniſt which is a diſciple, and giueth credite vnto ye in this matter, that read prayer is moſt deteſtable, and that ſuch as ioyne in it ſtand vnder Gods wrath, which yet durſt ioyne himſelfe or might ioyne himſelfe vnto any aſſemblie in the world, euen the moſt reformed? Tell me either you or any other chiefe Browniſt, will ſay they may pray with any aſſembly where they follow a preſcript forme? If ye dare not ſay this (I meane that ye would counſell men to ioyne with a Church that hath read prayer) but ſay they

muſt reprooue and condemne it, and if it were not redreſſed forſake them: then bee alſo aſhamed ſo furiouſlie to crie out vpon me, which ſpeake nothing herein, that I ſay ye condemne all churches, but that which all indifferent men muſt néedes ſée your owne wordes and doctrine doe vpholde. As for your bitter accuſations vpon no ſhewe I leaue them: and whereas ye require that if I haue any ſparkle of grace, I would procure that ye might decide the trueth with other Churches. I anſwere, that if ye had any ſparke of ſober wiſdome, ye could not with ſuch condition lay that vpon me, which ye knowe not howe vnable I am to performe. You ſay you might iuſtly be called an Anabaptiſt, if you ſhoulde reaſon thus, Impoſing of mens writings to be read for praying, is an heinous ſinne, therefore they that vſe it are no Church. Haue ye ſaid no more, but that it is an hainous ſinne? Haue you forgotten all your former ſayings of Idolatrie, bondage breaking Chriſtian libertie, moſt deteſtable, ſtanding vnder Gods wrath? I hold him no Anabaptiſt nor Donatiſt, which from ſuch ſpéeches concludeth no true Church. For I neuer heard that the true Church doth ſtand vnder Gods wrath. The next wordes are ſore; Abaddon is the father of ſuch Prophets, ſaith Maiſter Greenewood, becauſe I ſay the Browniſts maintaine ſuch a fréedome as that will haue nothing impoſed by commaundement. I pray ye tell me whether you be one of thoſe which ſet out the brief ſumme of the profeſſion? And when I had written againſt it, I would knowe if ye were one that made the defence, or approoued the ſame? Did yee not approoue of the anſwers that goe vnder the name of Henrie Barrow? Impoſed is put for an argument by it ſelfe in thoſe writings, and ſo noted with a figure. Could the very word impoſed be an argument by it ſelfe, if any impoſing by commaundement bee lawfull in Gods worſhip? If the ciuill Magiſtrates haue power but to reuiew the lawes of Chriſt, and to mooue men or ſtirre them vp to the more diligent keeping of the ſame, may they then impoſe by commaundement? And as you ſpeake here of that which is not onely receiued, but alſo by

commaundement, as though there were great waight in the words, by commaundement. I pray ye tell me then what force ye repoſe in the words impoſed, and by commaundement, when ye oppoſe them againſt Chriſtian freedome? Tell me alſo whether yee denie not that any Canons and conſtitutions made in Synods, in matters variable, are to be impoſed by commandement? If they be, what is the reaſon that you Browniſts when yee crie out againſt Church gouernment as it is in England, ſpeake in generall againſt Canons? And a little after in this your booke, ye denie all power of making lawes in things indifferent, terming it an adding to Gods word, and alleaging againſt it the extreame curſe of God. I graunt the Churches power is limitted by the word in making ſuch lawes: and ſo is the power of Princes. There hath béen much ſayd alreadie touching the Lords Praier and other preſcript formes in the Scriptures: but yet here come in newe reaſons (if I may ſo call them) which are voide of reaſon. Houtos is the ſame that the Hebrew Coh, after this manner. I anſwere that this hath béen dealt in before, where ye muſt vnſay ſomewhat againe, or elſe the words of the Scripture now written are not the words of the Lord, but the like. Further, becauſe Chriſt ſaith, when ye pray, if he willed we ſhould ſay ouer ye words, then ſhould we euer when we pray, ſay them. To this I anſwere, that reſpecting the rules for matters, when ye pray, when is as much as to ſay whenſoeuer ye pray, becauſe we may not depart from thoſe matters conteined in the general petitions. But if we reſpect withall the preſcript forme of words, there is a double conſideration to be had: for in them ſelues they bee moſt excellent, perfect and full, and ſo brieflie doo containe the whole ſumme and ſubſtance of all thinges which we ought to craue of God, as that nothing is wanting. But our mind is not able ſo largelie or vnto ſuch depth at one inſtant to ſpread or extend it ſelfe in deſire, as to bee mindfull of euery particular therein conteined. And alſo we are more mooued, as ſeuerall matters of néede doo preſſe vs to craue them particularlie. Hereupon it doth followe, that

as on the one part, it were agreat iniurie and hindrance that any man ſhould binde vs, when any particular néede vrgeth, to begge reliefe onelie in the generall forme which includeth many things, and not ſuffer vs to expreſſe the very particulars and ſingulars: ſo on the other part, to binde vs alwaies in ſuch ſort to the ſeuerall particulars, that we may not at all vſe the generals, is very abſurd, and a diſgrace to thoſe moſt excellent petitions. For by this it muſt needes followe, that I may not ſay, Let thy Kingdome come: or forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgiue them, that treſpas againſt vs: vntill the Browniſts diſprooue this, he is fully conuict. For if I may vſe one petition of the generall heads when I pray, I may vſe anie one; if any one, then all.
            The next argument which is brought, is to this effect, that if we be cōmaunded to ſay thoſe words, then ſhould we ſin in vſing any other forme, for thoſe being in ye beſt forme, we are bound alwaies to bring the beſt ſacrifice we haue, or els we are accurſed. This reaſon I haue fully anſwered in that which went before, for I haue ſhewed in what reſpect, it is the moſt excellent &amp; abſolute forme, &amp; the beſt, and can by no meanes, without great abſurditie, yea wicked impietie, be reiected: &amp; withall what is neceſſarie and fit for vs.
            Now for concluſion, let the Reader iudge, whether I haue more need to leaue of, as he ſaith, my popiſh dreames, or he his ſpirituall fantaſies, I am farre from maintaining, that our Sauiour, or his Apoſtles did ſtint, or bynde men vnto certaine wordes which of neceſſitie they muſt vſe, and none other: but this is the thing which the Browniſtes muſt ioyne iſſue in with me, whether I may not pray ſaying, let thy kingdome come, or if I may ſo vſe the preſcript forme of wordes in one petition, whether I may not in any, and ſo in all? And heere let the Reader obſerue that Maiſter Greenewood crying out for freedome, complayning of a tradition that bringeth our libertie into bondage, hee doth him ſelfe take away freedome, and woulde lay a bondage vpon men, and vpon the Churches. For it is to lay a yoake of bondage when men will reſtraine that which God hath

left free to bee vſed, as ſhalbe moſt conuenient and profitable for edification, as to follow a preſcript forme, or to reade praying. Among the Iewes in the time of the Law, God tied them to the Temple, and vnto certaine ſet howers for the Euening and Morning ſacrifice, but in this we are ſet free in the Goſpell. For I may lawfullie goe to the Temple to heare the word and to be partaker of the Sacraments with the aſſemblie: and I may lawfullie frequent other places, where the publike worſhip is. The Churches may appoint the ſame howres for there meetings that were vnder the law, if it be conuenient, and they may appoint other if it ſhalbe more fitte hee that in theſe ſhall take away the freedome which is giuen to the Churches, doth lay a yoake of bondage. In like caſe preſcript forme of prayer to vſe praying, being an helpe to the weake, and a thing ſanctified of God, and left free to the Church as neede ſhall require, he that denieth that free vſe, doth lay a yoake of bondage. And ſo I charge Maiſter Greenewood here to doe.
            In the next place there were three Arguments of Maiſter Greenewoods which I anſwered at once by denying the aſſumptions, and ſhewing the reaſons that moueth me, for in déede, he ſetteth downe ſome propoſitions: and out of them affirmeth that which is falſe, and ſo concludeth from thence another falſehood. It is his whole manner of reaſoning; if I ſet downe this propoſition, God is a ſpirit, it is moſt true: if I will now make ſuch an aſſumption as this, a bodelie ſubſtance cannot worſhip a ſpirite, this being moſt falſe: there will followe a falſe concluſion, which is that no man can worſhip God in bodie; he is now therefore to proue his aſſumptions, and before he commeth to it, he crieth out, ſtay and wonder, they are blinde and make blinde. Who be blinde and make blinde the Browniſts? This man hath ſome great thing in his minde, which hee ſéeth and dooth wonder, and now calleth vpon all other to ſtay, vntill hee hath vttered it, and ſo to wonder with him. Is there anie doctrine more ſpirituall (ſaieth hee) any more inculcated by the holie Ghoſt, then this acceſſe to God in the mediation of

Chriſt, &amp;c. I anſwer who dooth doubt of this▪ You confeſſe I will ſay the propoſitions bee true and waightie matters: which I doo in deed, and thereby doo acknowledge that praier is a ſpirituall and Heauenlie thing, farre from the power of man to performe of himſelfe. Now Maſter Greenewood confeſſing I doo this, like as a great waue of the Sea commeth rowling and dooth in ſh
                  •
               w, threaten to ouerwhelme all, but ſodainelie falleth of it ſelfe: So he ſwelling with the winde of his vanitie, crieth out ſtay and wonder, as if I ſhould be ouer whelmed with the ſtreame of his words, and by and by falleth of himſelfe, confeſſing that I allow the propoſitions: which in déede include the excellencie of praier, and there is an end of his wonder. The firſt aſſumption, hee muſt prooue is that to reade vpon the booke when one prayeth is a quenching the ſpirite; for this he alleageth the ſaying of Saint Paul, Quench not the Spirite, when he hath ſet downe this, he addeth that to ſuppreſſe and leaue vnuttered the paſſions of our own heart, by the work of the Spirite, giuing vs cauſe of praier, and in ſteed thereof to reade another mans writing, he dooth not doubt will be founde and iudged of all that haue ſpirituall eyes to ſee a quenching of that grace. I anſwer to this, that the ſpéeches of the Scripture are moſt fit to vtter our paſſions by. And what haue yee brought, but the matter in queſtion? If wee reſpect ſuch as be not able ſo well to vtter: the ſpirituall eyes to ſée and iudge that to bee a quenching of the Spirite, are but the eyes of Browniſts. Therefore all his beggarlie cauils which follow, and which haue been anſwered before, are to be let paſſe as they come.
            The ſecond aſſumption to bee prooued is that it is preſumptuous ignorance to come with a booke. This is a lame ſacrifice, becauſe a man dooth knowe how to doe better and doth not; ſtil he would haue that graunted which is denied. For I ſay the booke is to helpe men to doo the better, which are in themſelues dull, and full of wants, and without helpe ſhould rather offer a lame ſacrifice. The third is for ſtriuing in praier, for which when hee hath ſpoken much of this ſtriuing

which is not denied, for continuance and importunacie; he imagineth that the whole matter is prooued, for this as hee would make vs beléeue, cannot bee effected vnles the Prieſt reade till he ſweate againe, with vaine repetitions. I might followe with many words in theſe and the reſt: but ſéeing he hath confeſſed, that the Pſalmes were to bee ſung vnto God, let him ſhew how the verie reading then can bée ſo grieuous a thing; for this the reader muſt conſider, that our queſtion is not about the matter of prayer, nor any corruption by vaine repetitions or otherwiſe, nor about the hypocriſie and vaine babling of ſuch as pray but of faſhion, but ſimplie of the reading, when one prayeth: which vntill he can prooue that diuers Pſalmes either were not vttered to God as praier, or that they did not reade them when they did ſing, he prooueth nothing, but deceiueth the ſimple with the ſight of true things which he ſpreadeth, and from which he draweth foorth ſuch falſe concluſions. I leaue to the reader but to compare his anſweres he maketh to the reſt touching theſe arguments, and ſee if they make any thing for uim, and not rather againſt him.
            The next Argument is that, We muſt pray as neceſsitie
               
                  
                     •
                  rgu. 7. 
               requireth: but ſtinted praiers cannot be as neceſsitie requireth.
            
            Whereas I affirmed that there be things neceſſarie to be prayed for at all times and of all men: which indéed are the moſt things which wée are to begge of the Lord. Of theſe there may bee preſcript formes for all times: and for other things that fall out ſildome the praier is to be applied to the time, and neceſſitie. Here are large diſcourſes and ſuch as this Replier dooth much pleaſe himſelfe in, as a moſt ſpiritual man. This I take to be the drift of the whole that in praying to GOD, wee muſt come with féeling our wants, that ſo we may pray earneſtlie, which I doo yéeld vnto as an vndoubted trueth. He holdeth it as a great abſurditie that we ſhould want the ſame thing to morrow which wee doo to day, or that all congregations ſhould néed the ſame one day which they doo another. Hee is moſt fooliſh in

this and ſuch like obiections: for if I ſhould ſtand to followe particulars, there bee fewe things which we may not either for our ſelues or for our brethren at all aſſemblies begge of the Lord. If there be ſpeciall neceſſities, they are to be ſupplied. The matter is cléere, I will not ſpend time about it, more than I haue in my former booke.
            But whereas the Browniſt doth obiect, that a preſcript forme doth ſhewe that men take vpon them to knowe mens ſecrets, which God alone doth knowe, it is moſt vaine and friuolous. The Scriptures doo ſhewe that we all ſtand in neede of the ſame thinges and euermore, being ſicke of one diſeaſe, though there may be ſome particular caſes wherein ſome haue their ſeuerall neede. And let him anſwer me now vnto this poynt: There be fiue or ſixe hundred in one flock, which come together to pray; if it be as you would beare vs in hand, that there is ſuch a variablenes in our needes, that to day our neceſſitie requireth one thing, to morrowe another: then euery particular man and woman hath ſeuerall wants, and is to pray for no more than they come with preſent feeling off, how then ſhall the Miniſter frame his praier to fit them all? One ſhall ſay, this pertaineth not to me, how ſhall I pray? Another ſhall ſay, this or that toucheth not my eſtate. Many ſhal complaine that their ſeueral wants are not touched. Tell me Ma. Greenwood, or any Browniſt, doth ye Miniſter knowe what is in euery man? doth he know euerie man &amp; womans particular wants? He is to make the praier in which they are al to ioyne wt him, in euerie requeſt that he maketh. Or is your meaning yt euerie man and woman ſhall come vnto him before euerie aſſemblie, and make their ſtate knowne what their ſeuerall neede is? Or can the Miniſter beare in minde when he hath heard? Ye may ſee into what abſurdities blind fantaſie doth caſt men. Men are to pray for nothing but that which they feele the want of, and are prepared to aſke, &amp; are fit to receiue. For theſe (ſaith the Browniſts) there can be no ſet forme. And I demaund whether the preacher doth know euery mans féeling, how they are prepared, &amp; how fit to receiue▪ Will ye affirme this▪ or will ye confeſſe

that theſe groſſe fantaſies which yet you will father vpon Gods ſpirit, doo quite ouerthrowe all publike prayer? For if it bee ſinne for any to pray for more than he commeth with the preſent feeling off, if in the multitude the deſires are ſeuerall, if it bee vnpoſſible for the Miniſter to knowe them, and how the hearts bee prepared and affected, how ſhall he make prayer for them all? how ſhall they all ioyne with him in euerie requeſt? How much better is it to confeſſe that the moſt things which all are to pray for, and at all times are inuariable: and that men come not only to pray for that which they feele their neede in; but alſo to be ſtirred vp to pray for ſuch things as either they thinke not of, or be dull in. I muſt needes here lament the ſtate of our people which profeſſe the Goſpell, and cannot eſpie the groſſeneſſe of theſe thinges. When the aſſemblies doo méet, and holie petitions are made which men haue heard at euery meeting, they ought to bee as feruent in praying as the firſt time they heard them. For it is a groſſe wickednes in men not to bee mooued with matter becauſe they haue often heard it, but accompt it ſtale: as we ſee mans minde coueteth ſtil that which is newe. If men haue not feeling it is their fault.
            Touching the faults in any Leiturgie, the queſtion is not betweene vs, which reaſon what ſhould be. That wh
                  •
               ch I ſpake of the preachers not limitted in their praiers, I meane the prayers before and after their Sermons which they conceiue. That our Sauiour preſcribed no forme, I ſhewed the reaſon, that it is not a thing of neceſſitie, but to auoide inconuenience: neither are men tied to one forme in all churches. Againſt this the Browniſt replying, biddeth me ſtand to this, and ſaith I will goe from it in the next argument. I ſay, all the Browniſts vnder heauen ſhall neuer be able with force of reaſon to driue me from it. He firſt oppoſeth, that if I ſay it be at all times neceſſarie, then the Teſtament is not perfect. How can I ſay it is at all times neceſſarie, when I ſay it is not of neceſſitie? Chriſts Teſtament is moſt abſolutelie perfect: but yet all things touching comelines, order, and conueniencie, which are variable and may bee changed,

are not expreſſelie mentioned. And that is one chiefe thing whereby the Browniſts doo ſeduce many a ſimple man. For this Browniſt doth confeſſe that there bee things contained in the generall rules of the Scripture, which are not expreſſed, but he will not haue any of thoſe things variable, that is, ſuch as may be for good cauſe altered. For thus he reaſoneth, I▪ it bee a part of Gods worſhip, and all times conuenient, then is it neceſſarie: and if it be not neceſſarie, put (ſaith he) ſuch conueniencie in your cornered cappe, or ſurpleſſe. And a little after, but you graunt (ſaith he) it is not of neceſsitie, therefore it is not commanded in particular, nor conteined in any generall rule. Thus may we ſee, that he holdeth there is nothing in matters of conuenience or circumſtance in Gods worſhip, which is not of neceſſitie. The ground of his reaſon is this: If it be either expreſſed in particular, or contained in any generall rule, it is commaunded of GOD, and man hath not authoritie to alter Gods commandement, therefore it is neceſſarie. I grant that matters of conueniencie are commaunded of GOD by the generall rules, and that men may not take authoritie ouer Gods commandement. I ſay therefore the Church doth ſinne either of ignorance or of negligence, when it faileth in matters of circumſtance which ſhould ſerue for edification. But herein the Browniſt ſheweth himſelfe moſt abſurdly ignorant, that he will haue that which is commanded to be of neceſſitie at all times. For that he may not winde out here with ſhift, as his manner is when any groſſe thing vttered by him is detected. Let the reader obſerue his words, and he ſhall ſée plainly he reaſoneth for a neceſſitie at all times. For he ſaith, If it be a part of Gods worſhip, and at all times conuenient, then is it neceſſarie. And to manifeſt that he holdeth it all times conuenient: ſaying, if it be not neceſſarie, put ſuch conueniencie into your cornered cappe. And againe hée ioyneth commanded in Gods word and neceſſarie at all times together. And a little after he ſaith, Whatſoeuer is commanded either in particular or in neceſſarie collection from the generall rules, are of neceſsitie to be obeyed, and not to be altered.
               
This I note to ſtop his euaſion: for many matters of circumſtance ſeruing for conueniencie and order, are fit at ſome times in ſome places, and for ſome perſons, and ſo by the commaundement of GOD then to be vſed, who willeth that all things be done comelie, in order, and to edification. Now, as the times do varie with the circumſtances of place, of perſons, and of other occaſions, the ſame things which were conuenient may become inconuenient, and ſo not neceſſarie at all times, as the blinde Browniſt dooth beare in hand, but to be altered. As for example, in the time of peace it is moſt conuenient that the aſſemblies ſhould meete in ſome Temple or Church built for the purpoſe: the Church is then to ordeine that it may bee ſo. In the times of warre and cruell perſecution when the enemies raunge about and rage: it may bee farre more ſafe for feare of intrapping, to meete in the woods, or ſecret places. Kneeling is the fitteſt geſture of the bodie when men in earneſt prayer are to worſhip the Lord: the Church is to commaund it where it may fitlie be done: but if the aſſemblies be driuen to meet in ſuch places as the ground being wet, and through the trampling of their feete doth become myrie, it is inconuenient that the multitude ſhould bee compelled to kneele in the myre: and therefore the former ordinance is now changed. I might runne through a number of particulars, but theſe are ſufficient to declare what a learned Deuine maſter Greenwood is, and how perfect a ſpirit doth guide his penne. He demandeth alſo full wiſely, whether wee doo not hold it of neceſsitie, ſeeing men are excommunicate, and depoſed for not obſeruing it: or as ſome verie ignorantlie vſe to ſay, if it be a thing indifferent, why is it not left indifferent for men to vſe or not to vſe? I anſwere, that which is a thing indifferent, God commaundeth it ſhall be done when it is conuenient and for edification, and therefore when the Church doth appoynt or ordeine it, rightly he that breaketh it, wilfullie breaketh the commandement of God. And ſo on the other ſide, when it falleth out not to be conuenient, and the Church dooth alter it, hee that will now obſerue it with a reſiſting

minde doth like wiſe offend againſt the rule of Gods word. I neuer doubted but that by ne
                  •
               eſſary conſequence it is to be drawen from the doctrine of the ſcriptures, that prayer is to be made before and after the word preached, but I ſpeake of a commaundement in expreſſe wordes: therefore the places are cited here by the Browniſt to no purpoſe. And all the reſt of his words that follow are either in matters wherin we agree, or ſuch as he collectetth from his owne ignorance, and which are anſwered before.
            The next argument is, Read prayers were deuiſed by Antichriſt and maintaine ſuperſtition and Idole miniſterie, &amp;c.
            
            Here the Browniſt, if he would at all ſpeak to the purpoſe ſhoulde prooue that the very reading a prayer when one prayeth is the deuiſe of Antichriſt, maintaineth ſuperſtitiō &amp; an Idole miniſtrie. But he flieth &amp; dealeth about the matter of leiturgies, ſaying: he hath heard, the Pope woulde haue approoued ours, if it might be receiued in his name. If maſter Greenwoods newes from Rome were true which hee heard, the matter were not great, for the Pope will approoue the Lords prayer, the commaundements and articles of the faith, but he wil expound them as it pleaſeth him. The Pope alſo to wind in himſelf, wil approoue in ſhew many things which he miſliketh, ſo they be not directly againſt his crowne and dignitie. And it is to be conſidered that the controuerſies betweene vs and the Papiſts are not about the matters which we are to begge in prayer. There is no likelyhood that the Pope made ſuch offer, becauſe he knoweth we holde in the ſubſtance and grounds of the faith, that which quite ouerthroweth him: but if he did, men may ſee by theſe things which I haue noted, that maſter Greenwood doth but ſhift and trifle. He confeſſeth leiturgies were before Antichriſt, and yet ſaith he was the deuiſer. See the grauitie of this man: he is ſore afraide that hee ſhould here againe be ſaid to condemne all Churches becauſe they haue read prayer: and therfore he ſaith his arguments are falſely wreſted. Anſwere your ſelfe then, and tell vs what ye holde

them which receiue the deuiſe of Antichriſt. Why crie yee not out of the marke of the beaſt? It is a pitifull thing to ſee in what a caſe the Browniſt is: For he wil not cōdemne the Churches; and yet after he hath ſet foorth what leiturgie is, and affirmed that the new Teſtament is Chriſts leiturgie: he alleageth that they be accurſed that adde thereto; and holdeth preſcript forme of prayer an adding. Let him now be aſked: is the curſe layd vpon the true Churches? he will ſay no. Then preſcript forme is either no adding to Chriſts Teſtament, or elſe they be vnder the curſe that vſe it. He ſaith leiturgies are another goſpel. Then all Churches haue receiued another goſepl. The wordes that follow haue bin anſwered before. Where I ſayd there would ſundrie inconueniences growe for want of preſcript forme of publike prayer. After he hath ſet downe that Chriſt is a perfect law giuer, and that the word of God is ſufficient, he tearmeth it blaſphemie to ſay there would be inconueniences without leiturgies: then all the Churches committe blaſphemie, whether doe ye yet condemne them or not? This is from his groſenes which doth not ſe that Chriſts Teſtament is perfect, and yet there are things commaunded in generall rules which are variable, as I haue before ſhewed for circumſtances of time, place, perſons, ſitting, kneeling, &amp;c. He ſaith there can be no particular lawes made without breaking the lawe of God, as though the Church were not to ſee what in theſe is fit and conuenient vpon euerie occaſion and time, and for that time to eſtabliſh the ſame: But euerie man to doe as he ſhall like, or ſhal take the generall rule of order and decencie, for men will not agree: this is from rules of order to drawe confuſion. Now this great deuine ſaith I haue made a faire hande in affirming leiturgies to be but a matter of order, or conueniencie for edification. Seeing as hee ſaith, it is all the worſhip we haue: this commeth from him that hath the beautie of Sion, as he boaſteth: which the inchaunters of Egipt cannot iudge of. This commeth from him that with his fellowes hath the cloude betweene them and vs, and the pillar

of fire before them as he ſpeaketh in the next wordes. Becauſe I ſay the preſcript forme and the reading are but for order, he concludeth that I confeſſe the prayer is but a matter of order or conueniencie: ye ſay I haue made a faire hand. But I tell ye maſter Greenwood, if ye ſhould goe into the Schooles and reaſon ſo in earneſt, the young boyes would be readie to hiſſe ye foorth as a non proficiens, and howe faire hand ſhould you make then? they will not beleeue ye haue it from your pillar of fire, but out of that dark cloud of your ignorance which is betweene your ſelfe and the light of the trueth. Now wheras I ſaid, ye Church hath power to ordain according to the word of God, &amp; to appoint ſuch orders in matters of circumſtance, about publike prayer, preaching of the worde, and adminiſtring of the Sacraments, as ſhall moſt fitly ſerue for edification: and then theſe orders being eſtabliſhed by publike authoritie the diſcipline and cenſures of the Church are to driue men to the obſeruation of the ſame that ſtubbornely break them. Here the poore Browniſt layeth open himſelfe againe to be as blinde as a beetle: he will needes haue it to be papiſticall mudde, and that I am in an Apoſtacie. Becauſe there can as (he ſaith) no other lawes be made in matters of circumſtance, than Chriſt himſelfe hath made: that to ordaine lawes in the Church is to plead for vnwritten verities: and to make the law of God vnſufficiēt. It is an adding to the word of God, which is execrable pride. All the Popes trinkets might bee brought in by the ſame ground. This is the foundation of Poperie, and Anabaptiſtrie, to giue libertie to make lawes in the worſhip of God. And by your iudgement which would haue men driuen to obſerue them, our Sauiour Chriſt was an Anabaptiſticall Schiſmatike that would not himſelfe nor his diſciples obey the traditions of the Elders. Thus ſpeaketh this Browniſt. But what beaſtlie ignorance doth he bewray and that in ſundrie poynts? and with what horrible things in his blinde furie, doth he charge all Churches withall? For firſt when he ſaith that for matters of order and circumſtance, there can be no other lawes made of them, thā Chriſt hath made: he ſeeth not the difference betweene the giuing

generall rules of charitie, of come liues, and order, which ſerue for edification that are to be followed in making lawes touching matters in themſelues merely indifferent, and the very particular lawes thēſelues that are ſo to be made. Thē if it be true which he ſaith the matters of order and circumſtance are not variable, but ſtand fixed as inuiolable lawes of Chriſt in the particulars to be obſerued, which is falſe, ſeeing theſe circumſtances are no part of Gods worſhip: As Paul ſaith, The Kingdome of God is not meate and drinke, &amp;c. but as handmaids, to attend vpon it, and to adorne it; and ſo are vſed and not vſed, as occaſion ſerueth. I haue ſhewed this before in ſome particulars, as that the aſſemblies are in time of peace gathered in temples, and fixed places and open, in time of perſecution and tumult in the fields, in woods, and ſecret places which they change, and at the commandement of the paſtors and gouernours: the wiſe reader may conſider the like not onelie for kneeling and ſuch like, but in many other. And we ſée that the Apoſtles themſelues did decree ſome things for the time, which afterward were to bee altered, when the occaſion was taken away, as namelie to auoide giuing offence to ye weak Iewes which ſtuck in the ceremonies of the lawe: they made this decree Act. 15. That the gentiles ſhould abſteine from blood and from ſtrangled. We doo not now obſerue this decree of the Apoſtles, neither are we to obſerue it, ſéeing the occaſion is remooued for which it was made.
            Furthermore, if there be no lawes to be made in matters of circumſtance, how ſhal the flockes knowe what to follow or to obſerue where the paſtors ſhall diſſent and varie in iudgement? Sall not ſome be rent into one part, and ſome into another? Now when hee ſaith this is to pleade for vnwritten verities, to make the Lawe of God vnſufficient, to adde to the word, alleaging thoſe Scriptures, which ſhew how curſed a thing that is: hee dooth but ignorantlie abuſe thoſe Scriptures, and wickedlie ſeduce the ſimple ſorte of men. For thoſe Scriptures are againſt the adding of humaine precepts and lawes to be kept as parts of Gods worſhip,

to binde the conſcience, to ſéeke righteouſnes, and the forgiuenes of ſinnes, or the merite of eternall life in them, or againſt ſuch rules of gouernement, as God hath ſet to bee perpetuall. This is againſt the perfection of the word, againſt Chriſtian libertie, and in the chiefe things which concerne Gods worſhip, againſt the ground and foundation of our faith: and ſo a thing moſt deteſtable and accurſed, which our ſauiour alſo and his Apoſtles refuſed iuſtlie to obſerue with the blinde Phariſies. But now where the Browniſt hath his eyes ſo daſeled with that pillar of fire which hee ſaieth they haue before them, that he cannot perceiue that to make and conſtitute lawes in matters of circumſtance for comelines, and order according to the generall rules of the Scripture and not to binde the conſcience, is no adding to the word, nor mixing Gods worſhip with mans inuentions, he is much to be pittied. And doubtles before this pillar of fire bee remooued, which is not the heauenlie light of Gods ſpirite, but a frantick preſumption, by which the diuell dooth delude men and blinde them with their ſwelling, he ſhall neuer ſee well. Some will ſay if theſe conſtitutions be not to binde the conſcience of men, why are men forced to keepe them? Why ſhould the diſcipline and cenſures of the Church driue men thereunto? In déede this is that which the freedome of the Browniſts can at no hand indure. To anſwer this, the reader muſt conſider what is the binding of the conſcience. It is not to ſay ſimplie yee muſt for conſcience ſake doo it, or yee are bounde for conſcience ſake to doo it; for then all the humaine conſtitutions and lawes of princes may be ſaide to binde the conſcience, becauſe Saint Paul willeth to obey them for conſcience Rom. 13. But by binding the conſcience is meant, that ſuch lawes are laid vpon the conſcience to bee obſerued as part of the worſhip of God: when men are puniſhed for not keeping them as contemning Gods worſhip, then is the Chriſtian libertie withſtoode. But when ye diſcipline &amp; cenſures of the Church, doo compel men to obſerue the lawes, which in matters of comlines and order are made according to the rules of the Apoſtle:

they are not puniſhed for dooing or not doing the things themſelues, but that by dooing that which is forbidden, or refuſing to doo that which is commaunded, they diſturb the peace, bréede diuiſions and offence, diſobey where they are commanded obedience: theſe bee ſinnes, and for theſe, men are to be puniſhed. This is where the orders be, not againſt the word of God, but fitte for edification.
            And now to conclude about this matter, all the Churches of God vnder heauen doe make ſuch lawes, ſuch Canons, and conſtitutions in matters of circumſtance, and by their diſcipline compell both Miniſters and people to obey the ſame. The Browniſt alleageth againſt this, not only the ſentences. Prouerbs. 30. verſ. 5. 6▪
                and Deut. 4. verſ. 12. 32. but alſo, Reuela. 22. verſ. 18. 19. Where the Lorde threatneth, that he that ſhall adde to the words of that Propheſie, he will put vpon him the Plagues written in that booke.
            Tell me now Maiſter Greenewood, doe ye yet condemne all Churches? Ye do affirme that they which make anie lawes, doe adde to the worde of God, and alleage againſt them, that God will put vpon them the plagues written in that booke: which is a denouncing of the extreame wrath of God, for there is the lake of fire ſet foorth? If yee were not quite beſide your ſelfe, how could you thus hurle your dartes of extreame condemnation, and ſtrike all churches, and yet when I tell yee of it, crie out, that I am a liing Prophet, and will me to remember who is the father of vntrueths? But leaſt I may ſeeme to father that vpon the Churches, which is farre from them, I wil note ſomewhat out of the harmonie of confeſſions Section. 17. The latter Heluetian confeſſion ſaith, Quod in Eccleſijs dispares inueniuntur ritus, nemo Eccleſias existimet ex eo eſſe diſſidentes. That there are vnlike rites or ceremonies found in the Churches, let no man iudge hereby, that the Churches diſſent.
                And the confeſſion of Bohemia hath. Quare illi tantum ritus, illaeque ceremoniae bonae ſeruari debent, quae in populo Christiano vnicam &amp; veram fidem, ſincerúm

                  ri, aut perturbari: ſed quia bonae ſunt ijs ad bonum vti. Wherefore thoſe rites and thoſe good ceremonies ought onelie to bee kept, which among the people of Chriſt doo edifie the onelie and true faith, and the ſincere worſhip of God, concord, charitie, and the true and Chriſtian or religious peace. Therefore whether they bee exſtant, or brought in by the Biſhops, or by the Counſels Eccleſiaſticall, or by other authors whatſoeuer, the ſimpler ſort are not to trouble themſelues about that, neither with this to bee mooued or diſquieted, but becauſe they bee good, to vſe them vnto that which is good.
                And a little after, Et quanquam nostri, non omnes ritus aequè ſeruant cum alijs Eccleſijs, id quod &amp; fieri non potest, &amp; non est neceſſe fieri, vt omnibus in locis Christianorum conuentuum, vnae &amp; eadem ceremoniae vſurpentur: non tamen vlli bonae &amp; piae conſtitutioni repugnant, ſeſeuè opponunt, ne

That is to ſay, And although our men do not equallie obſerue all rites with other Churches, a thing which both cannot bee done, and is not neceſſarie to bee done, that in all places of the chriſtian aſſemblies, one and the ſame ceremonies ſhould bee vſed: yet they doo not repugne anie good conſtitution, or oppoſe themſelues, neither are they ſo minded as that for the cauſe of ceremonies they will moue anie diſſentions, although ſome might be iudged to be not altogether neceſſarie, ſo that they be not founde contrarie to God, to his worſhip and glorie, and which diminiſh not the true faith in Ieſus Chriſt, which onelie dooth iuſtifie. Againe a little after, Docentur &amp; hoc agnoſcere homines, traditiones humanas non complecti legem
               
               perpetuam &amp; immutabilem, ſed quemadmodum iuſtis de cauſis ab

That is, Men are taught alſo to acknowledge this, that humane traditions doo not conteine a perpetuall lawe and vnchangeable, but as for iuſt cauſes, they are ordeined by mē, ſo alſo for iuſt &amp; waightie cauſes, &amp; the matter ſo requiring, they may be violated, abrogated and changed without offending. The Auguſtine cōfeſſion, Quaerat igitur aliquis an vitam hanc hominū, ſine ordine, ſine ritibus eſſe velimus? nequaquā, ſed docemus paſtores veros Eccleſiarum poſſe in Eccleſijs ſuis publicos ritus inſtituere: That is, Some mā thē may demand whether we would haue this life of men to be without order, without ceremonies? In no wiſe. But we teach that the true paſtors of the churches may in their churches ordeine publique rites or ceremonies.
            
            I might ſet downe to the ſame effect out of the confeſſions of the other reformed Churches, but I will omit it as not neceſſarie, and onely note a fewe things out of Maſter Beza his Epiſtles. After he hath ſet downe Epiſt. 24. that things indifferent are ſo called, not that men may without exception doo or leaue vndone as often as they luſt and as it ſhall pleaſe them and not ſinne: but that they are ſo called, becauſe a man may vſe and not vſe them well, and hee may vſe them and not vſe them euill. And moreouer, that things indifferent by themſelues or otherwiſe, doo after a ſort change their nature, when by ſome lawfull commaundement they are either commaunded or forbidden. And further, that the vſe of them is generallie reſtrained by the lawe of charitie, and ſpeciallie or more particularlie by conſtitution either politicke or eccleſiaſticall. He addeth, Etſi enim conſcientias propriè ſolus deus ligat, tamen quatenus vel Magiſtratus, qui dei miniſter eſt, iudicat intereſſe reipublicae, vt quippiam alioqui per ſe licitum non fiat: vel eccleſia ordinis &amp; decori adeóque aedificationis rationem habens, leges aliquas de rebus medijs ritè condit: eiuſmodi leges pijs omnino ſunt obſeruande, &amp; eatenus conſcientias ligant vt nemo ſciens &amp; prudens rebellandi animo
               
               poſſit abſ
                     
                        
                     
                     que

                     •
                  cipiuntur. That is to ſay, For although properlie God alone doth bind the conſciences, yet ſo farre as either the Magiſtrate which is the miniſter of God, doth iudge it profitable for the Common-wealth that ſomething ſhould not be done, which otherwiſe of it ſelf is lawful: or the Church hauing regard of order and comelines, &amp; ſo of edification, doth rightlie make ſome lawes in matters indifferent: ſuch lawes are many wiſe to bee obſerued of the godlie, and do ſo farre bind the conſcience that no man wittinglie and willinglie with a mind to rebel can without ſinne, either doo the things which are ſo forbidden, or leaue vndone things ſo commanded.
            
            What haue I ſaid more than the Churches do hold, maſter Beza and all the moſt noble Inſtruments of GOD in theſe laſt daies, if I ſhould ſtand to ſhewe it. Then ye may ſee when Maſter Greenwood doth ſo raginglie take on, and ſtrike he knowes not whom, ſuch furie is not fit for diſputation in the Church. Let not the reader here ſuppoſe that I goe about to maintaine that the prayer of any is pleaſing to God, which come with cuſtomarie words of courſe without feeling their wants: or that I ſhould hold, that a ſet forme of prayer is of men to bee vttered without meditation and preparation, as many doo of an idle cuſtome, as if the verie ſaying were a great ſeruice to God. Nor yet doo I hold that all men alike ſtand in néede of preſcript forme in their priuate praiers, or that the feruencie of praier is not often times more vehement in vttering any requeſt in priuate prayer without preſcript forme than with it, if a man be able. I ſay further; A man is to cal vpō God not only as his néed in any particular ſhal vrge him, euen at al times: but he is alſo to ſtir vp himſelfe and to prepare himſelfe to begge moe things than bee in his preſent feeling and memorie, which preſcript formes are an help to direct him vnto. And when a man commeth to the publike aſſemblies to pray, the caſe is ſomewhat differing from making his priuate requeſts: for there he commeth not to craue thoſe things alone which hee feeleth

preſent neede of, or which hee is mooued withall, but to make common requeſts with the whole congregation, in all things that they are to craue. To this he muſt now frame himſelfe: Among fiue or ſixe hundred, the particular wants or deſires are ſundrie, one mooued more in one thing: another in another thing: ſome come more fitter to pray, for this, and ſome for that. It is moſt certaine, that neither the preſcipt forme, nor the preacher can ſee into theſe ſeuerall eſtates of mens mindes &amp; conſciences, or to the deſires which they are moſt fit and prepared to expreſſe: neither is that ſo much to bee regarded, ſeeing that which ſhould be fitteſt for one part, ſhould not be ſo fit for another: but they muſt euery one frame himſelfe to pray for al things which the aſſemblie doth pray for, which are neceſſarie to be praied for at al times and of all perſons. Shall any man ſay, I am not prepared to begge theſe things, therefore they be not fit for me? Let him not be ſo wicked, but ſtirre vp himſelfe rather to begge them with the congregation. Shall any be ſo fooliſh as to ſay, wee knowe theſe things before, I am not mooued with them, men for the moſt part do but repeat them of cuſtome? Nay rather let him ſtriue againſt ſuch impietie, and ſay the things are not any thing the leſſe precious which wee craue, becauſe wee heare them often or knowe them before, or that many abuſe them: and therefore we indeuour to begge them earneſtlie with all faithful ones in the aſſemblie, ſeeing they bee ſuch as are needfull to be praied for. In the reſt I leaue the reader to compare his booke with my former.
            The laſt Argument. The prayers of ſuch Miniſters and people as ſtand vnder a falſe gouernment are not acceptable. Thoſe Miniſters which ſtand ſubiect to the Biſhops and their Courts, are ſubiect to a falſe gouernment and to Antichriſt.
            
            I did referre the anſwere of theſe to the third and fourth accuſation: but yet I did take ſome exception, as my booke ſheweth. The Browniſt in replying here is in great diſtemper: I will let all his words paſſe, and come to the matter. I alleaged out of the Epiſtle to the Romanes Chapt. 7. that

S. Paule was held in ſome bondage, and therefore that Ieruſalem from aboue is not in this world ſo free, but that ſhe and all her children are in ſome ſpirituall bondage. At this he did crie out of Atheiſme &amp; carnal Libertiniſme, affirming that S. Paule neuer continued captiue vnto ſinne after regeneration, neither gaue place vnto euill thoughts. Where I haue iuſtly charged him with very foule matter, which now labouring to waſh away, he doth bemire himſelfe. Firſt he crieth out of wrong in diuers things without any cauſe. Such as do touch the queſtion of gouernment and the blaſts he bloweth that way, I doo here omit, becauſe his fellowes doo make replie as he mentioneth vnto thoſe things, and I muſt then anſwere. Onely I deale with him now touching the place to the Romanes. He willeth if I haue any common honeſtie, to let his former anſwer be ſeene. I promiſe ye it will be ſmall to your credite and honeſtie let whoſoeuer ſee it, ſeeing ye doo in ſhameles manner crie out of wreſting and I knowe not what. Againſt my reaſon out of the words of Saint Paule, denie if ye haue the forehead, theſe to bee your words. And now (ſay you) that Scripture which the Apoſtle hath ſet downe in the anguiſh of his ſoule, concerning the inward ſtrife of the fleſh and the ſpirit, you ſhamefully peruert to your owne condemnation except you repent: for Paule neuer continued captiue vnto ſinne after his regeneration, neither gaue place vnto euill thoughts. Paule ſpeaketh there of the vnperfectnes of his owne righteouſnes, which maketh the lawe deadlie vnto him. I will thinke you a fleſhlie Libertine, if you recāt not this doctrine. What Atheiſt would thus haue defended his owne groſſe ſinnes? Thus farre go your wordes, and now let ſuch as haue knowledge iudge what wrong I haue done ye. Let them looke vpon that which I haue publiſhed, and ſee whether I haue wreſted your words, or ſet downe any vnſound poynt of doctrine as you would yet accuſe me, and doo importunatelie crie out: but now your words are in the light, and your anſwere alſo which ye cannot vſe ſuch ſhifts to excuſe. You lay open the diſagreement betweene you and me. Firſt you cannot agree

to this, that the regenerate may be ſayd to ſtand in any bondage to ſinne. You cannot conclude againſt it, but bring in another ſaying and ſo draw a concluſion: And that is, how I alſo affirme that one ſtanding in bondage to open knowne ſinne, may in that eſtate bee accepted and communicated with as the ſeruant of Chriſt by outward profeſſion both at one inſtant: which is as to ſay, wee may bee to mans ſight the ſeruant of the diuell, and the ſeruant of Chriſt both at one time by outward profeſſion. So none ſhould bee excommunicate, none without, the world and the Church, light and darknes, Chriſt and Belial, ſhould bee mingled together. Well, then I aſke this queſtion both of your ſelfe and of your fellowes, whether there be any one of ye that can ſtand foorth and ſay, I ſee no ſinne in my ſelfe; but ſo ſoone as I haue eſpied I ouercome and am not at all led by it. Tell me further, whether ye haue not this, that ye may ſay there is euil alwayes in ye which you cannot be rid of; and that doth holde ye faſt and preſſe ye? Do ye not leaue the good vndone and commit euill, and ſuch euil as is alwayes preſent in ye? Doe not ye find great ſinnes that ye ſtand vnder as not able to come out of? If any Browniſt ſhall deny he is ſuch, or in this eſtate, he can be but a proud hypocrite. If yee confeſſe it, what doe you but confeſſe ſome bondage? Let me aſke ye further, is there any of ye which dare ſtand foorth and ſay I am not a ſinner in the ſight of men? I ſtand not holden vnder any outward ſinne: the Browniſt muſt aunſwere theſe queſtions, for he holdeth that men can not outwardly appeare ſinners and be the ſeruants of Chriſt at one inſtant. What beaſtly geare is this? There is ſinne that appeareth in the beſt men at al times, in geſture, in words, in deedes, in negligence, in wants, yea a thouſand waies: who is able to indure ye trial of Gods law euen in that which outwardly doth appeare in him for an howre? And will yee caſt foorth all in whome there appeareth ſinne that he dooth abide in? The groſe open ſinners I confeſſe, which contemne and giue offence are to be caſt foorth, but are thoſe which abide within at any time free from open ſinne? couetouſneſſe

is a foule ſinne, ſo is pride, ſelfe loue, and wrath. Doe all Browniſts ſo fully ſhine in brightnes before men that in none of theſe nor any other they can bee diſcerned to be ſinners? Doth all vertue ſhine foorth in them? And touching that which I charged you withall, looke better now vpon your owne ſpeech: If there bee any modeſtie in ye, it will be hard for ye to deny, but that I haue layde no more to your charge than your owne plaine wordes. For are not theſe wordes plaine, Paule neuer continued captiue vnto ſinne after his regeneration, neither gaue place vnto euill thoughts?
                But now you make a proteſtation that you haue euer been free from ſuch an hereſie, and your laſt writing did teſtifie much. Touching your writing it was both laſt and firſt, except your bare argument: and there is no heede to take what ye ſay, for your matter commeth foorth as the ſtreame doth turne the wheele, euen vnto contrary motions. When before the rage of the ſtreame turned the wheele to vtter the freedome of the Church, then it muſt bee in ſuch perfection that the regenerate is not partly held captiue vnto ſinne, nor giueth place vnto euill thoughts.
            Now when the wheele muſt haue a contrarie motion to purge your ſelfe, there commeth as violent a ſtreame that way. For here ye ſay, the children of God after regeneration may commit any ſinne, except the ſin againſt the holy ghoſt. And you alſo affirme that they may commit ſin of preſumption and obſtinate ſinne: In my iudgment you had neede of ſome fauourable expoſition of your ſpeech. The regenerate doubtles, as we haue examples in the ſcriptures may fall into grieuous ſinnes, and doe through frailtie: but that it may be of preſumption and obſtinacie, you muſt declare how filthie inceſt is not the ſinne againſt the holy ghoſt, nor if a man kill his Father, Mother, or Children. No more is witchcraft, and familiaritie with diuels. Is it your meaning, that the regenerate may of preſumption and obſtinacie committe theſe? If not, why doe you vtter ſuch wordes and not make them plaine. I ſpake vpon the place to the Romaines, that the freedome of the Church in this world is but in parte and not

perfect: he cried out, a fleſhly libertie. If I ſhould haue ſpoken as he ſpeaketh here, what would he haue ſaide? But hee now he is afraide leaſt while hee hath waſhed himſelfe ouer cleane from Anabaptiſme, he ſhould ouerthrow Browniſme, as indeede he doth. And that is the cauſe whie hee tempereth his ſpeech in the wordes following: that although in Gods fight obſtinat ſinners may be regenerate and ſo his children, yet not to men by outward profeſſion: but are to be caſt foorth which I doe not denie; and then for the leaſt bowing downe to a falſe gouernement, they are to be caſt foorth. This I omite as not the queſtion betweene him and me, and leaue his words to be conſidered of the reader. But where he procéedeth in reaſoning againſt me as if I held that obſtinate groſe ſinners are not teo bee caſt foorth by excommunication: I maruaile from whence he can gather that. But let vs come to S. Paule againe, and ſee how maſter Greenwood excuſeth his owne ſpeech, and condemneth mine. It is out of doubt that as God is immortal &amp; doth begette by immortal ſeede, as S. Peter ſpeaketh: ſo all which are borne of GOD and haue therefore receiued the ſpirite of regeneration, can neuer looſe that ſpirit. Whoſoeuer is borne of God doth not committe ſinne becauſe his ſeede abideth in him: neither can he ſinne becauſe he is borne of God. 1. Iohn. 3. v. 9. From hence maſter Greenwood holdeth himſelfe cleered, and may well ſay that S. Paule after regeneration ſtoode not in any bondage to ſinne, nor gaue place vnto euill thoughts: becauſe he euer repented, and the ſpirit of God in him did not, nor could not cō
               ſent or giue place vnto ſinne. His meaning then is this, that the regeneration which is from the ſpirite cannot be in bondage to ſinne, and the graces of the ſpirite cannot conſent or giue place vnto euill thoughts. This is moſt true, vnleſſe a man will be ſo wicked as to holde that the grace of God may be in bondage and conſent to the worke of the deuill. If this had been the matter in queſtion betweene vs, and he had ſaid no more, it could not be reprooued. But he proceedeth further and chargeth me with error, that when S. Paule reaſoneth of the olde man, or corruption in him, I will needes cō
               clude

it of the new man, or inner man, or of the whole man. My wordes are extant in print, let all the Browniſts ſconne them, and ſee whether they can without falſehood and lying gather from them that I conclude that the new man or inner man which is ye grace of regeneration is in bondage to ſin, or doth conſent vnto euill thoughts: the whole courſe of my wordes doth lay open the contrarie. For I ſhew how Paule touching the inner man conſented to the law of God: And that in his minde, that is in the regeneration, he did ſerue the law of God. What is it then which maketh maſter Greenwood ſo boldlie to accuſe, and ſo falſely? Euen the mother of headdy boldnes, and much falſhood, palpable ignorance. For where I ſtand to affirme, that paule a regenerate man ſtood yet in ſome captiuitie and bondage vnto ſinne. He doth imagine it will followe, that I affirme the regeneration to be in bondage vnto ſinne: becauſe Paul is the whole man, and he that concludeth vpon the whole, concludeth vpon euerie part. In deede this is it which hath deceiued the Browniſt, and by which he thus laboureth to ſeduce others: that where the Scripture calleth the regeneration, or the graces of the ſpirit, the new man and the inner man, (as it calleth the corruption of nature the olde man, and the bodie of ſinne) he vnderſtandeth it, as though the perſon himſelfe, who is regenerate were called the new man, or the inner man, which is farre wide: for the graces of the ſpirite, the worke of the ſpirite, the regeneration called the inner man, are one thing, and the man himſelfe which is regenerat, another. The bodie and ſoule are Paul, the regeneration called the inner man, or the graces of the Spirite, are not Paul himſelfe, but in Paul. The ſoule &amp; bodie are Paul, the corruption through concupiſcence called the olde man, is not Paul himſelfe but is in Paul? becauſe the regeneration ſhall neuer be extinguiſhed the regenerate are reckoned and eſteemed after it, not that the regeneration itſelfe is, either the man or a part of the man. Dauid was a man regenerate, he committed adulterie, and murther, the ſoule and bodie of Dauid ſinned, whole Dauid doth acknowledge himſelfe a ſinner, that is,

he was a ſinner both in bodie and ſoule: and yet the regeneration, the ſeede of God in him, the graces of the Spirite, which were as coles of fire for the time couered in the aſhes, did not ſinne, nor conſent vnto euill thought. Paul a regenerate man, when he ſaith Autos ego, I my ſelfe
                in the minde ſerue the lawe of God, but in the fleſh the lawe of ſinne, calleth not the regeneration, I my ſelfe, but his ſoule and bodie which were Paul: then the bodie and ſoule of Paul in the minde, that is ſo farre as they were regenerate, did ſerue the lawe of God. The ſame bodie and ſoule of Paul in the fleſh, that is in the corruption of nature remaining, becauſe regeneration is not full and perfect, did ſerue the lawe of ſinne: for he ſaith I my ſelfe for both. The fleſh in this place is not Paul, nor no part of Paul, but the corruption of ſinne ſpread ouer the bodie and ſoule of Paul. Euen ſo, the minde is not Paul, nor anie part of Paul, but the worke of Grace remaining, the ſoule and bodie of Paul.
            
            Now the Browniſt, not vnderſtanding, but as the Apopoſtle ſaith, They would be Doctors of the law, not knowing what they ſpeake, nor whereof they affirme. 1. Timo▪
                1. would haue vs beleeue him, that Paul after regeneration was not in anie reſpect held captiue vnto ſinne, nor gaue place vnto euill thoughts: becauſe the grace of God in Paul was not in bondage vnto ſinne nor conſented.
            Saint Paul ſaith, I my ſelfe in the fleſh ſerue the law of ſinne: which as I expounded in my former booke, doth not prooue that ſinne did raigne, or that it is to be accounted ſuch a ſeruice to ſinne as is done on the other part to God, becauſe this is by violent tyrannie againſt the will, ſo farre as the grace of regeneration hath reformed it; and the ſeruice to the lawe of God is with delight and willingneſſe. This is the reaſon why he ſaith, It is no longer I, but the ſinne that dwelleth in mee. It is not reckened his ſinne before God, becauſe hee doth hate it: but yet it ſticketh faſt both in his ſoule and bodie. It is no longer I that ſinne: The Browniſtes expoſition is to this effect, It is no longer I that is the inner man, or the graces of the ſpirit that
               
               doe it, but ſinne that dwelleth in me. Did the grates of regeneration euer commit ſinne, or the inner man▪ If not, how can it be ſaide it is no longer I, for nothing can be ſaid to do no longer, that hath not don before? And whē he ſaith, but ſin that dwelleth in me, this in me, is not in the regeneratiō, for though ſin dwel in man together with the works of grace, yet is it no fitte ſpeech to ſay ſinne dwelleth in the regeneration▪ Therefore this I, when he ſaith, it is no longer I that do it, is not the inner man, but the perſon of Paul conſiſting of ſoule and bodie. How fondly then doth Maiſter Greenewood affirme, that S. Paul in that place touching his bondage to ſinne, ſpeaketh but of that which is called the olde man? The olde man is the concupiſcence and corruption of ſinne. Where I alleaged that Paul ſaith, he ſaw a law in his members that did leade him captiue to the law of ſinne, hee ſaith I falſefie the text: becauſe it is leading me captiue, and not did leade me captiue. Paul ſpeaketh in the time preſent, leaſt he might ſeeme to ſpeake of a former eſtate which he was not in then. And it was more effctuall to lay open the bondage to ſinne, which in ſome reſpect the regenerate are in, though ſinne haue not dominion ouer them, for him to ſay, at that inſtant holding me captiue, then to ſay did leaue me captiue. The cauſe why I put it in the time paſt is, that Paul is deliuered long ſince. The diſciples ſawe Ieſus walking on the water, doe I falſefie the text, if I ſay they ſawe Ieſus did walke vpon the water▪ But this is not all, for this Browniſt ſaith, holding him captiue, but it did not holde him. What can bee a more flatte contradiction than this▪ his reaſon is becauſe there was a ſtronger, that ſuffered not the law in his members to raigne. The matter is not about a full dominion of ſinne, but whether the body and ſoule were not ſo yoaked ſtill with it, as to be forced to commit ſinne. Now let me haue an anſwere to this, eyther from Maiſter Greenewood, or any other Browniſt whether the regeneration be perfect in any. He will ſay I do hym

great wrong to aſke him ſuch a queſtion, becauſe he profeſſeth the contrarie. Well then, anſwere alſo whether the freedome of Gods children from ſinne, while they liue here be perfect, or but in part, as the regeneration is? If ye will ſay the freedome is perfect, ſhew how there can be a perfect freedome from ſinne, by a ſanctification which is but a part. If ye ſay the freemdome is but in part and vnperfect, as ye muſt needes ſay, (vnleſſe ye will bee right Annabaptiſts indeede) then tell me how it is poſſible, that where the freedome is but in part, that ſhould be no bondage? For what is the imperfection of freedome, but that it taketh not away all bondage? looke how farre the freedome commeth ſhort of perfection, ſo farre bondage doth remaine, chuſe whether part ye will to affirme, eyther the freedome of Gods children from ſinne while they liue here to be perfect, or elſe to be vnperfect. For if ye ſhall ſay the freedome is alreadie perfect, (as ye haue hetherto, by affirming that the regenerate are in no bondage to ſinne) then ſhall ye continue in Annabaptiſtrie. If ye denie the freedome of the regenerate to be perfect as yet, (which in deede is the ſound truth) then conſider that howe much is wanting of perfect freedome, ſo much remaineth of that bondage to ſinne, which as yet al ſtand vnder that line, and acknowledge your madnes in affirming ſo directly contrarie to the Scriptures, that Paul neuer continued captiue vnto ſinne after regeneration, nor gaue place vnto euill thoughtes.
