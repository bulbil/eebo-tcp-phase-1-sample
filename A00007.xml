            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

And in this maner of wyſe many are redde to be noble men. ¶ The fourth cauſe of noblenes was haboundaūce of goodes. Somtyme ye people were holden with grete penury of meet &amp; drynke / &amp; than they toke them &amp; theyrs to ſome ryche man / that through that couenaūt they ſholde tempre ye grete ſtraytnes of theyr honger / &amp; after that they ſholde knowe hym as theyr lorde &amp; a noble man.

And it is redde yt many were noble men by tyrāny / of yt whiche ſome were deſtroyed anone / &amp; ſome abode in ſtablenes / as paynyms myght.

So at ye laſt they of Troy &amp; Brute ſpake togyder of kynrede &amp; lygnage &amp; of acqueyntaūce / and there complayned them vnto Brute of theyr ſorowe &amp; of theyr bondage / and of many other ſhames ye kynge Pandras had done to them / &amp; to Brute they ſayd vpon a tyme.

                        ANd whan Brute had this anſwere of Diane the goddeſſe / anone he let wȳde vp the ancres &amp; ſayled in to the hye ſee.

And whan Brute wyſt whens they were / he toke them wt moche ioye in to his ſhyppes / &amp; ſo he ladde them forth with hym. This Coryn there became Brutes man / &amp; to hȳ dyd homage. And ſo lōge they ſayled forth in the ſee tyll they came in to Gaſcoyne / &amp; anone they arryued in ye hauen of Lyegers / &amp; there they dwelled .viij. dayes for to reſt them / and to amende theyr ſayles there as they had nede. Ty dynges ſoone came to kyng Goffar that was lord of that londe how that moche people of ſtraunge londe were arryued in to his londe in the hauen of Lyegers wherfore he was ſore angred &amp; anoyed that they came and arriued in his londe without his lycence &amp; his leue. And anone ordeyned hym a grete power for to dryue out Brute &amp; to deſtroye hym &amp; all his people. But it was ſo ye kynge Goffar was dyſcomfyted &amp; all his people / &amp; hymſelfe fledde in to fraunce for to haue helpe &amp; ſocour. And in yt tyme regned in fraunce .xij. kynges / and .xj. of them aſſembled a grete power for to belpe Goffar / &amp; for to fyght agaynſt Brute. This Goffar dwelled wt the kynges of fraūce halfe a yere &amp; more. And in the meane tyme that Goffar was in fraūce / Brute &amp; his company deſtroyed all the londe of Gaſcoyne / and let take all the treaſour that kynge Goffar had / &amp; made it to be brought in to his ſhyppes. ¶ And this Brute foūde in that londe a fayre place and a conueny ent / &amp; there he let make a fayre caſtell and a ſtronge. Whan this was all done / kynge Goffar came from

fraunce and .xj. kynges with hym / and brought wt hym .xx. M. men for to fyght with Brute &amp; his company. And Brute had but .vij. M. and .iij.

And in this batayle Turin Brutes coſyn was ſlayne / &amp; Brute let bury hym worthely whan he had ſpace in ye caſtell yt he had made / &amp; tho let call yt ſame caſtell Tours / for bycauſe of the name of Turin yt there was buryed And yet vnto this daye there is a noble cite yt is called Tours. And whan kyng Goffar wyſt yt Turyn was deed / he came agayne wt his men &amp; gaue a ſtronge batayle to Brute. But Brute &amp; his men were ſo wery for fightȳge yt they might no longer endure / &amp; than went in to his caſtel wt all his men: &amp; made y• gates faſt for to ſaue them / &amp; toke coūſeyle amōge them what they ſholde do. Brute &amp; Coryn gaue coūſeyle &amp; ordeyned pryuely y• Coryn ſhold go out and buſſhe hym in a wode tyll on y• morowe / ſo yt in the mornynge whan Brute ſholde fyght wt his enemyes / Coryn ſhold come wt his folke on ye one ſyde &amp; ſlee &amp; do all ye harme yt he myght. And on the morowe at the dawnynge of y• daye Brute wente out of the caſtel &amp; fought fyerſly wt his enemyes / &amp; they manly defended them. But within a lytell tyme Brūte &amp; his men ſlewe. viij hondred of kynge Goffers men / &amp; than came Corin wt the buſſhemēt / &amp; he &amp; his company ſmote to the groūde all thoſe y• wolde ſtande or abyde / ſo ye kynge Goffar &amp; his company were diſcomfyted / &amp; faſt they began to flec. And Brute &amp; Coryn with theyr company fyerſly them purſued / and ſlewe moo of them in the fleynge than they dyd in y• batayle. And in this maner Brute had y• victory / neuertheles Brute made moche ſorow for his coſyn Turyn that there was ſlayne &amp; other alſo that he had loſt of his men / that is to ſaye .vij. hondred and .xv. the whiche nobly he buryed in the ſame caſtell of Tours / there where that he had buryed Turyn his coſyn.

And the fyfth daye after they arryued in an hauen at Cornes / &amp; came in to this realme yt than was called Albyon / where they founde neyther man nor woman / ſaue grete gyauntes / &amp; they dwelled in mountaynes &amp; in cauernes. And Brute

ſawe the londe was fayre and at his ly kynge / and was good alſo for hym &amp; for all his people / as Diane ye goddeſſe had behyght hym. And therof was Brute wonders gladde / and let aſſemble vpon a daye all his folke to make a ſolempne ſacrifyce and a grete feeſt in ye honour &amp; reuerēce of Diane the goddeſſe / whiche had coūſeyled hȳ fyrſt to come in to this londe. And whā they had done theyr ſolē pnite / as they ſate at theyr meet vpon a daye there came in vpon them .xxx. gyauntes / and ſlewe .xxx. of Brutes men.

And vpon a certayn daye whan Pylate loked out of his palays in to an orcharde of a mānes that was called Ruben the whiche was very fader to Iudas / Pylate deſyred to haue apples / and Iudas went to gader apples and Ruben ranne to Iudas for to let hȳ bycauſe he toke his apples without ony leue. And after yt they had chydden this Iudas ſmote his fader on the heed wt a ſtone &amp; ſlewe him / &amp; Iudas fledde away ſecretely after y• dede / but it was ſayd y• Ruben died ſodeynly.

And he delte not curteyſly wt her as a man ſhold do wt his wyfe / wherfore ſhe wepte bycauſe ſhe had put her ſone in y• ſee / &amp; yt ſhe was maryed agaynſt her wyll. It was ꝑreyued y• Iudas had ſlayne his fader &amp; wedded his owne moder. Than Ciborea his moder &amp; wyf ſtyred hȳ to leue his ſynne which he dyd &amp; folowed Chryſt / &amp; he for gaue hym his ſynnes / &amp; made hym his proctour &amp; apoſtle / &amp; how falſe he was to Chryſt it nedeth not to reherſe. And ye ſame yere Mathewe was choſen / &amp; the holy ghooſt was ſente vnto them as is ſayd before.

This man was cured of waſpes in his noſe anone as he byleued in our lorde Ieſu / &amp; that was the cauſe why he went to Ieruſalem to venge Chryſtes deth. He fought xxxij. tymes with his enemyes.

                        THis Engiſt went in to Kent and ſeaſed all ye londe in to his hādes for hym &amp; for his men / &amp; became within a lytel whyle of ſo grete power / &amp; had ſo moche people / that men wyſt not in litel tyme whiche were ye kȳges men &amp; whiche were Engyſtes / wherfore the Brytons had of hym drede / &amp; ſayd amonge them / but yf they ne toke other coūſeyle bytwene them / all the londe ſhold be deſtroyed through Engiſt and his people. Vortiger ye kyng had begotē on his fyrſt wyfe thre ſones / ye fyrſt was called Vortimer / the ſeconde Catagren / &amp; ye thyrde Paſſent. The brytōs by one aſſent choſe Vortimer to be theyr lorde &amp; ſouerayne / &amp; crowned hym kyng / &amp; wold not ſuffre Vortiger no longer to regne / bycauſe of the alyaūce bytwene Engiſt and hym. The brytons ordeyned a grete hooſt for to dryue out Engiſt &amp; his company of ye londe / and gaue hym thre batayles / the fyrſt was in Kent where he was lorde / the ſeconde was at Tetford / &amp; ye thyrde was in a ſhyre on this ſide Colcheſtre in a moor. And in this batayle mette them Catagren &amp; Horne Engyſtes broder / ſo that eche of them ſlewe other. But for as moche as ye coūtre was gyuen longe before to Horne through Vortiger whā he ſpouſed his coſyn / there he made a fayre caſtell that is called Horne caſtell after his owne name. Vortimer was ſo ſore anoyed for his broders deth / that anone he let caſt downe ye caſtell to ye erth. And after he ſtynted not nyght nor daye tyll he had dryuen out Engyſt &amp; all his people of the londe. And than Ronewen his doughter made grete ſorowe / and craftely ſpake to them that were nexte to the kyng Vortimer / &amp; pryuely entreated them / and ſo many gyftes ſhe gaue them / that the kynge was empoyſoned and dyed at London the fourth yere of his regne / and there he lyeth.

And whan all this was done / Ronewen the quene pryuely ſent by lettre to Engiſt that ſhe had empoyſoned Vortimer / and that Vortiger her lorde bare agayne the crowne &amp; regned / and that he ſholde come agayne in to this londe wel arayed with moche people for to auenge hym vpon the brytons / and to wynne this londe agayne by myght and ſtrength. And whan Engiſt herde theſe tydynges / he made grete ioye / &amp; apparayled hym haſtely with xv. thouſande men that were boughty in euery batayle / &amp; came in to this londe.

And whan Vortiger herde tell that Engiſt was comen agayn with a grete power in to this londe / he aſſembled his brytons &amp; went to mete Engiſt for to gyue hym batayle. But Engiſt dredyng ye brytons ſore / for they had dyſcōfyted hȳ before / prayed Vortiger of a loue day / &amp; ſayd he was not comen in to this londe for to fyght / but for to haue his londe agayn / yf he myght accord wt the brytōs. Kyng Vortiger through coūſeyle of his brytons graūted hym a loue day. And it was ordeyned by the brytons yt the loue daye ſhold be holden beſyde Salyſbury on an hyll / &amp; Engyſt ſholde come thyder with. iiij .C. knyghtes &amp; no moo.

                        MErlyn &amp; his moder departed frō the kynge / and returned agayne to Karmardyne. And ſoone after tydynges came to the Brytons that Aurilam bros and Vter his broder were arryued at Totnes with a grete hoſt. And anone the Brytons aſſembled them and went to receyue Aurilambros and Vter with grete noblenes / &amp; brought them to London / and crowned Aurilambros &amp; made hym kyng / and dyd vnto hym homage. And anone he aſked where as Vortiger myght be foūde that was kynge / for he wolde be auenged of his broders deth / and after he wolde warre vpon ye paynyms. And they tolde hym that Vortiger was in wales / &amp; ſo they ladde hym thyder warde. Vortiger wyſt well that thoſe bretherne came to conquere hym / and fledde thens into a caſtell that was called Gerneth / that ſtode vpon an hye moūtayne / and there helde hym. Aurilambros and Vter his broder and theyr folke had beſyeged the caſtell full longe tyme / for the caſtell was ſtronge &amp; well arayed. So at the laſt they keſt wylde fyre and brente houſes and men and all theyr araye &amp; as moche as was within the caſtell. So that Vortiger was brent amonge all other / and ſo he dyed with moche ſorowe. ¶ Than was Engiſt in Kent and regned there / and herde theſe tydynges / anone he fledde &amp; wolde haue gone in to Scotlonde for to haue had ſocoure. But Aurilambros and his folke mette with hym in the north countree / and gaue hym batayle. And Engiſt and his men defended them whyles yt they myght / but he and his folke were dyſcomfited and ſlayne. And Otta his ſone fledde vnto yorke. And Aurilambros folowed hym egerly. And Otta with ſtode hym a lytell whyle / but afterwarde he put hym to his mercy. And Aurilabros receyued hym / and to hym &amp; to his men gaue the countree of Galeway in Scotlonde / &amp; there they dwelled. After that the kynge Aurilambros went through out the londe / and put awaye the name of Engyſt londe / that Engyſt after his name had called it before. Than he let call it agayne grete Brytayne / and let make agayn chirches and houſes of relygyon / caſtelles / cytees / and borowes and townes that the Saxous had deſtroyed / and came to London / and dyd do make the walles of the cyte / whiche Engiſt &amp; his folke had caſt downe. The Brytons ladde hym to the moūt of Ambrian where ſomtyme was an hous of relygyon whiche than was deſtroyed through ye paynyms / wherof a knyght that was called Ambry that ſomtyme was foūder of that hous / and therfore the hyll was called the mount of Ambryan. And after it was called Ambeſbury / and ſhall be ſo for euermore.

The kynge therof had grete pyte / &amp; thought to make in mynde of them a monument of ſtone that myght endure to the worldes ende. And of this thynge

Than ſpake to ye kynge the byſſhop of London that was called Ternekyn yt he ſhold enquyre after Mer lyn / for he coude beſt tell how this thȳge myght beſt be made. And Merlyn after was ſought &amp; foūde / &amp; came to ye kynge. And the kyng tolde hym his wyll of the monument yt he wold haue made. Merlyn anſwered to ye kynge &amp; ſayd. There ben grete ſtones in Irlond &amp; longe vpon the hyll of Kian yt ben called gyaūtes ka roll / &amp; yf they were in this place as they be there / they wold endure for euermore in remembraūce of thoſe knyghtes that here be buryed. Perma foy ſayd ye kyng as harde ſtones ben in my lōde as in Ir lōde. Soth ſayd Merlyn / but in all your londe there be none ſuche. For gyauntes ſet them for grete good of themſelfe. For at euery tyme yt they were woūded or in ony maner hurt / they waſſhed ye ſtones with hote water / and thā they waſſhed them therwith / &amp; anone they were hole.

And whan the kynge of Irlonde yt was called Guillomer herde tell ye ſtraūgers were arriued in his londe / he aſſembled a grete power / &amp; fought agaynſt them / but he &amp; his folke were diſcōfyted. The Brytons wente before tyll they came to the moūt of Kylian / &amp; clymmed vp vnto the moūt. But whan they ſawe the ſtones / &amp; the maner how they ſtode / they had grete meruayle / and ſayd bytwene themſelfe that no man ſholde them remeue for no ſtrength ne engyne ſo grete they were &amp; ſo lōge. But Merlin thrugh his crafte he remeued them / &amp; brought them in to theyr ſhyppes &amp; came agayn in to this londe. And Merlin ſet ye ſtones where the kyng wolde haue them / &amp; ſet them in the ſame maner that they ſtode in Irlonde. And whan ye kynge ſawe yt it was made / he thāked Merlin &amp; ryche ly hym rewarded at his own wyll / &amp; let call ye place Stonehenge for euermore.

                        ¶ Of the prophery of Merlyn declared of kynge Edwarde the ſone of kynge Edward the fyrſt.
                        OF this kyng Edward prophecyed Merlin &amp; ſayd y• there ſholde come a gote out of Carre yt 
                           ſhold haue hornes of ſyluer / &amp; a berde as whyte as ſnowe / and a droppe ſhold come out of his noſethrylles yt ſholde betoken moche harme honger &amp; dethe of people / &amp; grece loſſe of his londe. And that in y• begynnynge of his regne ſholde be haūted moche lechery. And he ſayd ſothe / alas the tyme for kyng Edward yt was kyng Edwardes ſone was borne at Carnaruan in Wales For ſothe he had hornes of ſyluer and a berd as whyte as ſnowe whan he was made prȳce of Wales / to moche he gaue hym to ryot and to foly. And ſothe ſayd Merlyn in his ꝓphecy / that there ſhold come out of his noſe a droppe. For in his tyme was grete honger among y• poore people / &amp; ſtronge dethe amonge y• ty the that dyed in ſtrange londe with ſorowe &amp; in warre in Scotlond. And afterward he loſt Scotlonde &amp; Gaſcoyn &amp; moche le chery in his dayes was haūced. ¶ Alſo Merlyn ſayd yt this gote ſholde ſeke the floure of lyfe &amp; of deth. And he ſayd ſo the for he ſpouſed Iſabell y• kynges ſyſter of Fraūce. And in this tyme Merlyn ſayd that there ſhold be made brydges of folk vpon dyches of the ſee. And y• was well ſeen at Bannockeſbourne in Scotlonde whā he was diſcōtyted there of y• Scotces. And Merlyn tolde alſo that ſtones

ſholde fall from caſtels / &amp; many townes ſhold be made playne. And he ſayd ſothe For whan kynge Edward was diſcomfyted in Scotlonde &amp; came than ſouthwarde / the Scottes beſyeged caſtels &amp; dyd moche harme / &amp; brent townes vnto the harde erth. ¶ And afterward Merlyn tolde that an egle ſholde come out of Cornewayle that ſholde haue fethers of golde / that of pryde ſholde haue no pere / and he ſhold deſpyſe lordes of blode / and after he ſhold dye through a bere at Gauerſyche / &amp; that prophecy was full well knowen &amp; foūde ſoche. For by the egle is vnderſtande ſyr Pyers Ganaſton / that than was erle of Cornewayle / whiche was a wonders proude man / &amp; deſpiſed the barons of Englonde / but afterward he was heded at Gauerſyche through ye erle of Lancaſtre &amp; the erle of warwyk. ¶ And Merlyn tolde that in this tyme it ſholde ſeme that the bere ſholde brenne and that batayle ſhold be vpon an arme of the ſee in a felde arayed lyke a ſhelde where ſholde dye many whyte hedes / &amp; he ſayd ſothe. For by the brennynge of ye bere is betokened grete drede through cuttynge of ſwerdes at that batayle of Myton / for there came ye Scottes in maner of a ſhelde in a wynge / &amp; ſlewe men of religyon / preeſtes and ſeculers / wher fore the Scottes called that batayle in deſpyte of Englyſſhmen the whyte batayle. ¶ And after Merlin ſayd that the foreſayd Bere ſholde do the Gote moche harme / &amp; yt ſholde be vpon ye ſouth weſt / and alſo vpon his blode. And ſayd alſo yt the Gote ſhold leſe moche dele of his londe / tyll the tyme that ſhame ſholde hym ouercome / &amp; than he ſhold clothe hym in a lyons ſkynne / &amp; ſholde wynne agayne that he had loſt / &amp; more through people that ſholde come out of the north weſt / yt ſholde make hym to be fered and hym auenge vpon his enemyes through counſeyle of two owles / that fyrſt ſhold be in peryl to be vndone. And thoſe two owles ſholde go ouer ſee in to a ſtraūge londe / &amp; there dwell a certayn tyme / &amp; after ſhold returne agayn in to Englond / &amp; ſhold do moche harme to many one / &amp; that they ſholde coūſeyle ye Gote to meue warre agaynſt the foreſaid bere / &amp; the gote &amp; the owles ſholde come to an arme of ye ſee at Burton vpon Trent / &amp; ſholde go ouer / &amp; that for drede the bere ſholde flee with a ſwan in his cōpany to Bury towarde ye north through an vnkynde outpulter / &amp; that ye ſwan thā ſhold be ſlayne wt ſorow and the bere ſhold be ſlayne full nye his owne neſt / yt ſhold ſtande vpon Poūtfret vpon whome the ſonne ſholde ſhede his bemes / &amp; many folke ſhold ſeke hym for his vertue. And he ſayd ſothe. for ye good erle Thomas of Lācaſtre was borne in the north weſt / &amp; coſyn to ye kynge &amp; his vncles ſone / &amp; by lawe he made ye kynge leſe moche lōde yt he had purchaſed wyl fully tyll at ye laſt the kynge toke therof ſhame / &amp; hymſelfe fylled wt cruelte. And after gate agayne yt he had loſt &amp; moche more / through helpe of folk comyng out of ye northweſt / by whom he was drad / &amp; auenged hȳ on his barons through coū
                           ſeyle of ye two Spēſers yt afore were out lawed for theyr wickednes / &amp; after came agayne out of Fraūce / &amp; ſo moche theſe Spenſers coūſeyled ye kynge yt he ſhold warre vpon Thomas of Lancaſtre / ſo yt the kyng &amp; the Spenſers and the erle of Arundell and theyr power mette with Thomas of Lancaſtre at Burton vpon Trent / and hym there diſcomfyted / and ſyr Vmfrey erle of Herford was in his company. And after fledde the foreſayd Thomas and Vmfrey with theyr company to Burbrygge / metynge with ſyr Andrewe of Herkela / that is called ye vnkynde outpulter / and alſo ſyr Symond Warde erle of Yorke they came &amp; met wt
                           
Thomas of Lātaſtre wt an huge company / &amp; them there diſcōſyted / &amp; in y• diſcō
                           ſiture y• crle of Herford was ſlayne vpon the brydge cowardly with a ſpere in the foūdement / &amp; the erle Thomas was taken &amp; ladde to Poūtfret / &amp; than was he heded beſyde his owne caſtell. But afterward many hym ſought for myracles y• god dyd for hym. And in y• tyme Merlyn ſayd / for ſorowe and harme ſholde dye a people of his londe / wherfore many londes ſholde be vpon hym the more bolder And he ſayd ſothe / for bycauſe of his barons that were put to deth for ſaȳt Thomas quarell of Lancaſtre / people of many londes became the bolder for to meue warre vpon theyr kyng / for theyr blode was turned to many nacyons. And afterward Merlyn tolde &amp; ſayd yt the foreſayd owles ſholde do moche harme vnto the floure of lyfe &amp; deth / and they ſholde brynge her to moche dyſeaſe / ſo that ſhe ſholde go ouer ſee in to Fraūce for to make peas to y• floure delyce / &amp; there ſholde abyde tyll on a tyme her ſede ſhold come and ſeke her / and there they ſhold abyde bothe tyll y• tyme that they ſholde clothe them with grace / &amp; thoſe two owles ſhe ſholde ſeke &amp; put them to pyteous deth. And that prophecy was well knowen / &amp; was full ſothe. For ſyr Hugh Spenſer the fader &amp; ſyr Hugh the ſone did moche ſorowe and perſecucyon vnto the quene Iſabell through theyr ꝓcuremēt to her lord y• kyng. So they ordeyned amonge them y• ſhe was put vnto her wages / y• is to ſaye .xx. ſhillynges in y• daye / wher fore the kyng of Frauce her broder was ſore alwyed / &amp; ſent in to Englonde by his lettres vnto kynge Edward y• he ſholde come vnto his parlyament to Parys in Fraūce. But kynge Edwarde was ſore adradde to come there / for he wende to haue be areſted tyll that he had made amendes for the treſpace that ſyr Hugh Spenſer the fader &amp; the ſone had done / &amp; for y• harme y• they had done to the quene Iſabell his ſyſter. Wherfore through her ordynaūce &amp; cōſent of y• Spenſers y• quene Iſabell went ouer ſee in to Frauce for to make accorde bytwene kyng Edwarde &amp; the kyng of Fraūce her broder. And there dwelled ſhe in Fraūce tyll Edward her eldeſt ſone came for to ſeke her and ſo they dwelled there bothe tyll that alyaūce was made bytwene them &amp; the gentyl erle of Henaud / yt yf they wt theyr vertue myght deſtroye &amp; ouercome y• ves nym &amp; the falſnes of the Spenſers that ſyr Edward ſholde ſpouſe dame Philip the worſhypfull lady &amp; the erles doughter of Henaud. Wherfore the quene Iſabell &amp; Edward her ſone / &amp; ſyr Edmonde of wodſtocke the kynges broder of Englond / &amp; ſyr Iohn of Henaud / &amp; ſyr Rogrt Mortimer of Wygmore / &amp; ſyr Thomas Rocelyn / &amp; ſyr Iohn of Cromwell / &amp; ſyr Willyam Truſſell / &amp; many other of the alyaunce of the gentyll erle Thomas of Lancaſtre yt were exiled out of Englōde for his quarel / &amp; were diſherued of theyr londes / ordeyned them a grete power &amp; arryued at Herewich in Suffolke. And ſoone after they purſued the Spenſers tyll yt they were taken &amp; put to pytcous deth / as before is ſaid / &amp; theyr company alſo / for y• grete falſnes that they dyd to kynge Edward and to his people. And Merlyn ſayd alſo more y• the gote ſholde be put to grete diſraſe &amp; grete anguyſſhe &amp; in grete ſoro wehe ſholde lede his lyfe. And he ſayd ſothe / for after y• tyme that kyng Edward was taken he was put in to warde tyll that y• Spenſers were put to deth / &amp; alſo bycauſe he wolde not come to his parlyamēt at London as he had ordeyued &amp; aſſygned hymſelfe vnto his haronage / &amp; alſo wolde not gouerne and rule his people nor his realme as a kynge ſholde do. Wherfore ſome of y• barons

of Englōde came &amp; yelded vp theyr homages vnto hym for them and all the other of the realme on the daye of y• conuerſyon of ſaynt Paule / in y• yere of his regne .xx. And they put hym out of his royalte for euermore / &amp; euer he lyued afterward in moche ſorowe &amp; anguyſſhe.
                        LVdouicus was emperour after Henry .iiij. yere. This Lodewik was duke of Bauare / &amp; he deſpyſed the crownacyon of y• pope / wherfore y• pope depoſed him / and moche labour &amp; many peryls he had after / &amp; he troubled gretly the vnite of holy chirche. Than was choſen agaynſt hym Frederyke duke of Auſtryche. And he ouercame the duke / &amp; abode a rebellyon to his ende / &amp; in grete peryll to his ſoule. And at the laſt Karolus was choſen agaynſt hym / the whiche preuayled / &amp; ſodeynly Lodewyk fell down of his hors and deceſſed. ¶ Iohn Maundeuyll a doctour of phyſyk and a knyght was borne in Englonde aboute this tyme. And he made a meruaylous pylgrymage / for he went almooſt about all y• worlde / &amp; he wrote his dedes in thre languages / &amp; deceſſed &amp; was buryed at ſaynt Albons. ¶ Benedictus the .xxij. was pope after Iohn .vij. yere &amp; more. This man was a monke / and in all his youth he was of good cōuerſacyon / and a doctour of diuinite. And whā he was made pope he reformed y• ordre of ſaynt Benet in that thynge y• was neceſſary. And he was an harde man to graunte benefyces / leeſt he had graunted it to an vnconnynge man. He made a decretall y• whiche began Benedictus deꝰ in donis ſuis. And he was very cruell ī his fayth And for y• of ſome men was lytell loued. He was ſo ſtoute a man that almooſt he wolde not knowe his owne coſyns.

                        AFter this kyng Edward of Carnaruan regned ſyr Edwarde of Wyndſore his ſone / y• whiche was crowned kynge &amp; anoynted at Weſtmynſter / through coūſeyle &amp; conſent of all y• grete lordes of y• realme y• ſondaye on Candelmaſſe euen / in y• yere of grace.

                        ANd at y• tyme y• Scottes had aſſembled all theyr power &amp; came in to Englōde &amp; ſlewe &amp; robbed all y• they myght take / &amp; alſo brente &amp; deſtroyed all

the north coūtree throughout tyll y• they came to the parke of Stanhope in wyre dale / &amp; there y• Scottes helde them in a buſſhmēt. But whan y• kyng had herde through certayn ſpyes where y• ſcottes were / anone right wt his hooſt beſyeged them within y• foreſayd parke / ſo that y• Scottes wyſt not where to go out / but onely to theyr harmes / &amp; they abode in y• parke .xv. days / &amp; vytayles fayled them on euery ſyde / ſo y• they were gretly appayred of theyr bodyes.

But ſyr Roger Mortymer conſented not therto / for he had pryuely takē mede of the Scottes to helpe them that they myght go in to theyr countre. And this Mortimer coūſeyled ſo moche Thomas of Brotherton y• erle Marſhall that was kyng Edwardes vncle that y• foreſaid Thomas ſholde not aſſemble at that tyme vnto y• Scottes / &amp; he aſſented but he wyſt not the doynge bytwene the Scottes &amp; the foreſayd Mortimer.

And in this maner he was deceyued / &amp; wyſt nothynge of the treaſon. And thus was the kyng principally deceyued. And whan it was nyght Mortymer that had the watche for to kepe of the hooſt y• nyght / dyſtroubled y• watche that nothynge myght be done. And in y• meane whyle y• Scottes ſtole by nyght toward theyr owne countree as faſt as they myght.

And y• nyght the mone ſhone full clere &amp; bryght. And for all the kynges men the Scottes eſcaped harmeles.

And for bycauſe of that vyage the kynge had dyſpended moche

of his treſour &amp; waſted. ¶ And in that tyme were ſeen two mones in y• fyrmament / that one was clere and that other was derke / as men myght ſe through y• worlde.

Wherfore the kynge &amp; his coūſeyle towardes hym were agreued / &amp; ordeyned amonge them to vndo hym through pure reaſon and lawe / bycauſe that kynge Edward that was the kynges fader tray

counſeyle loued Mortimer / &amp; tolde hym in preuite how that the kyng &amp; his counſeyle were aboute frō daye to daye hym for to deſtroye &amp; vndo. Wherfore Mortimer was ſore anoyed and angry as the deuyll agaynſt them yt were of ye kynges coūſeyle / &amp; ſayd he wolde of them be auenged how ſo euer he toke on. It was not longe afterward that king Edward and dame Philip his wyfe / &amp; dame Iſabell the kynges moder / &amp; ſyr Roger Mortymer ne went vnto Notyngham there for to ſoiourne. And ſo it befel that quene Iſabell through counſeyle of Mortimer toke to her the keys of ye gates of ye caſtel of Notyngham / ſo that no man myght come in nor out by nyght / but through cōmaūdement of Mortimer / ne ye kynge nor none of his coūſeyle. And that tyme it befell ſo that Mortimer as a deuyll for wrath boyled / &amp; alſo for wrath ye he had agaynſt the kynges men / &amp; pryncypally agaynſt them yt had accuſed hym to the kyng of ye deth of ſyr Edward his fader. And pryuely a counſeyle was taken bytwene quene Iſabell &amp; Mortymer &amp; the byſſhop of Lyncolne and ſyr Symond of Bedford &amp; ſyr Hugh of Trompyngton &amp; other preuy of theyr coūſeyle for to vndo them al ye had accuſed Mortimer vnto ye kynge of his faders deth of treaſon &amp; of felony. Wherfore all thoſe yt were of the kynges coūſeyle whā they wyſt of Mortimers caſtynge / pryuely came to kyng Edwarde &amp; ſayd that Mortimer wolde deſtroye them bycauſe they had accuſed hym of kyng Edwardes deth his fader and prayed hym yt he wolde maynteyne them in theyr right. And theſe were the lordes yt purſued this quarell / ſyr Williā of Mountagu / ſyr Vmfrey de Boghun / ſyr Williā his broder / ſyr Rauf of Stafford / ſyr Robert of Herford / ſyr Willyam of Clynton / ſyr Iohn Neuyll of Nornby and many other of theyr conſent / and all theſe ſwore vpon a boke to maynteyne the quarell in as moche as they myght. And it befell ſo after that ſyr Wyllyam of Mountagu ne none of ye kynges frendes muſt not be herborowed in the caſtel for Mortimer / but went and toke theyr herborowe in dyuers places of ye towne of Notyngham. And tho were they ſore adrad leſt that Mortimer ſhold deſtroye them / and in haſte came vnto kyng Edward ſyr Willyam of Moūtagu yt than was in ye caſtell / and pryuely tolde hym that he nor none of his company ſholde not take Mortimer without counſeyle &amp; helpe of Wyllyam of Eland conſtable of the ſame caſtell. Now truly ſayd ye king I loue you well / &amp; therfore I counſeyle you that ye go to the foreſayd conſtable and cōmaunde hym in my name that he be your frende and your helpe for to take Mortimer / all thynge left vpon peryll of lyfe &amp; lymme. Than ſayd Moūtagu / ſyr my lord graūt mercy. Than went forth the foreſayd Moūtagu and came to the conſtable of the caſtell / and told hym the kynges wyll. And he anſwered &amp; ſayd the kynges wyll ſhold be done in as moche as he myght / and that he wolde not ſpare for no maner deth / and ſo he ſwore and made his othe. Than ſayd ſyr Willyam of Mountagu to the conſtable / in herynge of all them that were helpyng vnto the ſame quarell. Now certes dere frende / vs behoueth to werke and do by your aduyſe for to take Mortymer / ſyth that ye be keper of the caſtell &amp; haue the keys in your warde. Syr ſayd the conſtable ye ſhall vnderſtande that ye gates of the caſtell ben locked with the lockes that dame Iſabell ſente hyther / and by nyght ſhe hath the keys therof &amp; layeth them vnder the leueſell of the bedde tyll on the morowe / and ſo ye may not come in to the caſtell by the gates in no maner of wyſe / but I knowe an aley that

And ſo I ſhall lede you through ye aley / and ſo ye ſhall come in to the caſtel wtout eſpyenge of ony men yt be your enemyes. And the ſame nyght ſyr William Moūtagu &amp; all the lordes of his quarell / &amp; the ſame conſtable alſo wente to hors them / &amp; made ſemblaūt as it were for to go out of Mortimers ſyght. But anone as Mortimer herde theſe tydynges / he wende yt they wold haue gone ouer ſee for fere of hym And anone he &amp; his company toke a coū

And amōge other thynges Willyam Eland conſtable of ye foreſayd caſtell / priuely lad ſyr William of Moūtagu &amp; his company by the foreſayd waye vnder the erth tyl they came in to the caſtel / &amp; went vp in to the toure where as Mortymer was in. But ſyr Hugh of Trompyngton theym eſcryed hydouſly &amp; ſayd. A traytours it is all for nought that ye be comē in to this caſtell ye ſhall dye yet an euyl deth euerychone And anone one of them yt was in Mountagues cōpany by with a mace &amp; ſmote the ſame Hugh vpon ye heed yt the brayn braſt out &amp; fell on ye groūde / &amp; ſo dyed he an euyll dethe. Than toke they Mortymer as he armed hym at ye toures dore whan he herde ye noyſe of them for drede And whan quene Iſabell ſawe ye Mortymer was taken / ſhe made moche ſotowe in hert / and theſe wordes to them ſayd. Now fayr ſyrs I pray you yt ye do no harme to his body a worthy knyght our welbeloued frende &amp; our dere coſyn.

Now certes it ſemeth vs that he werketh by grace / for he is wonders gracyous in his quarell / &amp; we certes ſhal be deed or that we may come to hȳ vs for to yelde / ſyth that his fader ſet of vs no pryce.

But whā ſyr Donald erle of Marcil that was with y• Scottes ſawe all this / he ſaid to Robert Brus the ſone of Robert the Brus theſe wordes.

And with that they prycked theyr ſtedes fyerſly on Gaſkmo re / &amp; theyr wynges them folowed on a rēge / &amp; tho came they &amp; mette wt Bayloll &amp; his cōpany at an hangynge bough of the more in a ſtrayte paſſage / and ſo faſt they haſted them vnto the englyſſhmen that thouſandes fell to the groūde eche ouer other in to an hepe bothe hors &amp; mā Syr Bayloll &amp; his men myghtely ſtode agaynſt them &amp; faſt ſlewe the Scottes to the groūde / &amp; many they fore woūded ſo longe tyll that they ſtode vpon them &amp; foyned them wt theyr ſwerdes &amp; ſperes through theyr bodyes / and full ſore they were trauayled vpon them / tyll yt they became wōders wery / &amp; wyſt not what for to do.

For it is here to be noted that euery lorde in Englonde durſt not diſobey ye quene / for ſhe ruled peaſybly all yt was done about ye kyng / whiche was a good &amp; a well diſpoſed man. And thā whan ye kyng was comen to the place where as they were / the duke of yorke &amp; his felaw ſhyp made theyr felde in ye ſtrōgeſt wyſe &amp; purpoſed verily to haue bydē &amp; fought but in ye nyght Andrewe Trollop &amp; all ye olde ſowdyours of Calays wt a grete felawſhyp ſodeynly departed out of ye dukes hooſt / &amp; wente ſtreyght to ye kynges feld / where they were ioyouſly receyued for they knewe ye entent of ye other lordes &amp; alſo ye maner of theyr felde.

And it fortuned that ſome of tho ſhyppes that came ouer with hȳ came in to Calays hauen by theyr free wyll / for ye ſhypmen ought more fauour to ye erle of warwik than to the duke of Somerſet / in whiche ſhyppes were taken dyuers men / as Ienyn Finkhyl / Iohn felow / Kaylles &amp; Purſer whiche were byheded ſoone after in Calays. ¶ And after this came men dayly ouer the ſee to theſe lordes to Calays / &amp; began to wexe ſtronger &amp; ſtronger / and they borowed moche good of the ſtaple.
