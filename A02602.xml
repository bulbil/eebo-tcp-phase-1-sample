            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  The firſt cheptour.
                  AFoir we entir to the ſpecial declaratioun of ye X. commandis, we think it expediēt to declare in general foure pointes, concernyng the law or commandis of God. Firſt, quhat is the law or commandis of God? Secund how ſuld the commandis of GOD be obſeruit and kepit to ye pleſour of GOD and our ſaluation? Third quhat punitions ar yai that GOD in haly ſcripture boſtis &amp; ſchoris aganis all the brekaris of his commandis? And fourtly, quhat ar the rewardis, quhilk GOD almychty promiſſis in haly ſcripture to all the keparis of his commandis.
                  Quhat is the law or command of GOD?Quhat is ye lavv or command of God. It is a rewil geuin to vs of GOD, for the gud gyding of our ſelf, quhilk declaris and ſchawis to vs quhat the wil of GOD is, that we ſuld do, &amp; quhat we ſuld nocht do in our thochtis, wordis and deidis. Quhy ſay ȝe yat ye law is a rewil geuin for ye gud giding of our lyif? For as ane biggare cā nocht make ane euin vp wal without direction of his lyne, a Maſon can nocht hew ane euin aiſlair ſtaine without directioun of his rewill, ane ſkyppar can nocht gyde his ſchip to gud heuin wtout direction of his Compas, ſa a man or a woman can nocht ordour or gyde his lyif euin and ſtrecht to the pleſour of GOD without direction of the commandis. Quhy ſay ȝe that thir commandis is giuen of GOD? For without dowe God hais geuin thame to vs, firſt in the law of nature quhilk is prentit in our hartis, ſecund in the law of Moyſes written with his awne fingar (that

is to ſay be ye vertew of the haly ſpirit) in twa tables of ſtayne, &amp; laſt of all our ſaluiour CHRIST baith God and man hes ratifeit and exponit thame in ye new law or Euangil. Quharfor with all diligence we ſuld ſtudy to obſerue and keip thir commandis, nocht only becauſe yat yai ar ſa expedient and profitable to vs, but ſpecially becauſe yt thai ax geuin to vs of God and declaris to vs his godly will, to quhome we and all creturis ſuld be obedient. Secundly how ſuld we obſerue &amp; keip ye cōmandis of God to his pleſour and tharby to obtene of him reward in heuin?Hovv ſuld the commandis be obſeruit. Luc. 1. Trewly we ſuld keip thame thre maner of wayis. Firſt hailelie in perfite nowmer.

                      Thai obſeruit all the commandis and ceremonyis of our Lord but ony complaint. For it is nocht yneuch to keip part of the commandis of God, and leif part of thame vnkepit, bot as ane harper will tune all his ſtringis, to that effect that he may mak ane pleſand ſound to ye heraris, ſa we man keip all the cōmandis of God, or els our keping will nocht be pleſand to God. Sa it is declarit be ſ. Iames: Qui totam legem ſeruauerit, offendit autem in vno, factus eſt omnium rens.
                     Iaco. 2. Quhaſaeuir ſall keip the hail law, and ȝeit fail in ane point, he is giltie in al yat is to ſay, gif he depart fra this life without trew penance, he ſal be condemnit perpetually to want ye glorious ſycht of God, alsweil as he that brekis al

the commandis. Nochtheles the ma commandis that a man brekis in this lyif, &amp; ſa dee without penance, he ſalbe condemnit to mair ſenſible paine in hell according to ye grauitie of his ſyn. Secundly we ſuld keip the commandis of GOD with ane rycht intencioun, and for the lufe of God. Thane we haif ane rycht intēcion, quhen we keip yame allanerlie, for the honour &amp; glore of God, and nocht for ony honour and glore to be geuin to vs of man in this lyif. For quhaſaeuir in doing of his gud deidis intendis principally to get honour, glore or reward of man, hais ane wrang intencion, and his deid ſa doin (ſuppoſe it be cōmandit of god) is nocht pleſand &amp; acceptable to God. Of this rycht intencioun ſpekis our ſaluiour Chriſt ſayand: Si oculus tuus fuerit ſimplex, totum corpus tuum lucidum erit.
                     Math. 6. 
                     Si autem oculus tuus fuerit nequā, totū corpus tuū tenebroſum erit. The lycht of thi bodie is thyne ee, thane gif thyne ee be ſimpil and clere, al thi bodie is clere, but &amp; gyf thyne ee be euil, all thy bodie is myrk, as it mycht be ſaid plainlie: lyke as the ee of our bodie quhen it is hail &amp; cleir, it direckis al the membris of our bodie in thair operatiouns and deidis, and quhen it is hurt &amp; nocht cleir, all the membris of oure bodie dois yair deidis as it war in myrknes. Siclik quhen ye intencioun of our mynd is cleir and richt, intending principally the honour, glore &amp; louing of God, yane our deid being conforme to ye law of God and done to ye intencioun is richt &amp; cleir

pleſand &amp; acceptable to God, bot and gif our intencion be principally, to get any fauour, louing glore or reward of man thane is our deid ſa done myrke, yat is to ſay, diſpleſand &amp; nocht acceptable to God. Sa we ſuld keip the commandis of God with ane rycht intencion according as S. Paul exhortis vs thus ſaying:i. Cor. 
                           •

                        •
                     o all with that intencion that God may be glorifyit. Thirdly we ſuld keip the commandis of God with conſtance &amp; perſeuerance, for as our ſaluiour ſais:Math. x. 
                     Qui perſeuerauerit in finē hic ſaluus erit Quhaſaeuir perſeueris to the end, he ſal be

Sik ane cōſtant ſeruand to God was Suſāna,Dani. xiii of quhome we reid in ye buke of Daniel, that quhen ſche was prouok it to the ſyn of adultery be twa auld Iugis, vnder na les paine, thane to be accuſit in opin iugement quhilk was deid be the law, ſche wald nocht grant to that ſynful deid, bot ſaid thir wordis: It is bettir for me to fal in ye handis of men nocht doand euil, than to brak the law of my Lord God. Siclyke, that honorabil ald mā Eleazarus was ane conſtant kepar of gods law,

Thus ȝe may leir how ȝe ſuld keip the commandis of God to his pleſour. Firſt keip thame all in thair hail nowmer. Secund keip thame all with ane rycht intencion, and for the lufe of god and eternal reward, quhilk is God himſelf. And thirdly keip thame al with ane conſtant mynd and perſeuerance to the end of ȝour life, ſa doand ȝe keip thame to the pleſour of God, and ȝour eternal ſaluacioun.

Nochtwithſtanding ymagis may be maid and had ſwa thai be weil and lawfully vſit as ſalbe declarit to ȝow eftirwart in the expoſitioun of ye firſt command. It folowis in the text of Deuteronome. Curſit &amp; wariit is he that honouris nocht his father and mother. Curſit and wariit is he ye tranſferris or takis away the trew marchis or boundis betuix his neichtbour and him ſelf. Curſit &amp; warryit is he yat cauſis ane blind man gang wrang in his iorney. Curſit &amp; wariit is he ye peruertis ye iugement of ane puir ſtrangeir ane freindles man or woman or wedow. Curſit and wariit is he, that ſleipis with his fatheris wif &amp; opinnis vp ye couering of his bed, or that ſleipis with his ſiſter, or with his wiffis mother, or with his neichtbours wyf, &amp; he yat ſtrikis his nychtbour. Syne concluding thus: Maledictus qui non permanet in ſermonibus legis huius. Curſit and wariit is that perſone quhilk bydis nocht with perſeuerance▪ in the wordis of this law. And to ilkane of thir curſingis &amp; waryingis afore reherſit, the peple anſuerd Amen.

Eftir hend all this,Deut. 28. Le. xxvi. yai turnit thame to the brekaris of the law, &amp; ſpak to thame mair ſcharply ſaying: Curſit and wariit ſall thow be in ye citie, &amp; curſit in the feild, curſit is ye barne quharin thow puttis thi corne, curſit is the frute of thi wambe, and the frute of thi erde, curſit is the drift of thine Oxin, and ye flockis of thi ſcheip. Thow ſalbe curſit comand in &amp; gangand furrh It war to lang to reherſe heir all the maleſonis waryingis or curſingis, quhilk God in ye ſame cheptour ſchoris to the tranſgreſſouris of his commandis. Bot breuelie and ſchortelie, thair is na calamitie, na ſorow or miſcheif yat may chance to mā or woman in this warld, bot it is expremit yare. Sa horribil a ſin it is to diſobey wilfully the cōmand of God, &amp; to do our awin will and nocht the will of God. Bot ȝit tell vs mair ſpecially, quhat ar the plaigis quhilk God is wont and vſis to ſend to the peple for tranſgreſſioun of his commandis? Thai ar thre in ſpecial, hunger, peſtelence, and the ſuerd, and repetit in ſyndry placis of the auld teſtament.Leu. xxvi. Eſaie. i. The temporal plagis ſend of God aganis the brekaris of ye commandis. He that is makar and Lord of heuin &amp; erde ſais thus in Eſaie: Gif ȝe will heir me, ȝe ſal eit the guddis of the erde, bot &amp; ȝe will nocht, bot prouoke me to anger, the ſuerd ſall deuore ȝow. Mony ſiclik comminatiouns in Ieremie. Mony in Ezechiel, mony in the laif of the Prophetis, full of terribil panys, boſtit be God aganis the tranſgreſſouris of his commandis.

And that ſiclike ſchoringis of God is nocht ſpokin in vaine teſtifeis well ye diſtruction of ſa mony excellent citeis, townis, caſtils: ſa mony nobil kingis, princis &amp; Emperouris. Was nocht ye cities of Sodoma &amp; Gomorra, Seboim &amp; Adoma with Segor vtterly deſtroyit? Quhair is Troia &amp; Babylone? Rome is nocht quarter ſamekil now as it was in Iulius Ceſars dayis. Quhat was the cauſe that king Saul tynt his kingdome fra himſelf and all his poſterite,i. Reg. 5: and efterwart was ſlaine in battall? Quhat was ye cauſe? Veraly his rebellion agains God, diſpiſand to do as the ſeruand of God Samuel commandit him to do in Gods behalf. Was it nocht ane miſerabil miſchance and calamitie that fell apon Sedechias king of Iewrie, quhilke for his rebellioun againe the king of Babylone,4. Re. 25. to quhome he was thane ſubieck it be the ordinatioun of God, he was takin and bound with chenȝeis, his ſonnis was ſlaine before his eyne, ſyne was baith his eyne put out, and was led blind in captiuitie in Babylone.

Firſt eftir the wiſman, he promiſſis ſpirituall wiſdome: Fili concupiſcens ſapientiam conſerua iuſticiam, &amp; deus prebebit illam tibi. Sone gif yow deſiris wiſdome keip rychteuſnes, and God ſall gyf wiſdome to the. And in ane vther place he ſais. Cogitatum tuum habe in preceptis dei, et in mandatis illius maxime aſſiduus eſto et ipſe dabit tibi cor et cōcupiſcentia ſapientie dabitur tibi. Haif thi thocht in the commandis of God, and in his commandis be yow diligent, and God ſall gyf the ane hart, and deſire of wiſdome ſall be geuin to the. This is declarit weil be exempil of king Dauid, ſaying thir wordis: Super ſenes intellexi,

Lat nocht mercy and verite forſake the, and thow ſall find grace &amp; fauour afore God and man. And ſaint Paul exhortand his Corinthianis to gif almous, ſais thus:2. Cor. 9. 
                     Augebit incrementum iuſticio veſtre. That is to ſay, quhen ȝe gyf almous according to the command of God, God ſall make ȝow grow dalie in grace and vertue. Thridly, our ſaluiour

promiſſis to the doars of the commandis the eternal blis of heuin,Eternall revvarde promiſſit for the keping of ye cōmandis Math. xix ſaying thus: Si vis ad vitam ingredi, ſerua mandata.

command? In the firſt command quhilk is yis: Non habebis deos alienos coram me: Thow ſall haif na vther gods bot me allone.

Thow ſall feare thi Lord God, and him only as thi God ſall thow ſerue. How ſuld we feare our Lord God? Twa maner of wayis. The ane, as ye ſeruand fearis his maiſter, doand his maiſters cōmand for feir of puniſion. And of this it is writtin in the buke of Prouerbis: Principium ſapientie timor dn̄i.
                        Prouer. 9 The beginning of wiſdome is the feare of God. Quhat thing ſuld moue vs maiſt to feare god on this maner?

                        ſauit

in his hart the feare of God, quhen he ſaid in the Pſalme:Pſal cxviii

And our ſaluiour Chriſt in the euangil of ſainct Luke biddis vs haif this feare ſayand: Timete eum qui poſtquā occiderit corpus, habet poteſtatē mittere in gehennam.
                        Luce. xii. 
                        Ita dico vobis hunc timete. Feir him quhilk eftir he hais ſlaine ȝour bodie, hais powar to caſt ȝow into hel, I ſay to ȝow feir him. Secund▪ we ſuld feir our lord God as ye gud ſon feiris his father, doand his cōmand, nocht principally for feir of punicion, bot maiſt of all, yat he diſpleſe him nocht nor offend him in ony ſort, leſt he put him out of his company. And yis feir of God ſpringis of lufe, for ye mair we lufe him ye mair we feir to offend him, and to depart fra his company. And of this feir it is writtin in ye Pſalme:Pſal xviii. 
                        Timor domini ſanctus permanet in ſeculū ſeculi. The haly feir of our Lord enduris for euirmair.

                     THe ſecund principal vertew quharin ſtādis the trew ſeruice of GOD,
                        The faith of god. Eccle. 2. quhilk he requiris of vs in this firſt command is fayth, quharof it is writtin: Qui timetis dominum credite illi, et non euacuabitur merces veſtra. Ȝe that feris our Lord haif faith in him, or gif credit to him, and ȝour reward ſall nocht be takin fra ȝow.
                     Quhat is fayth? Na dout bot the fayth quhilk is

commendit in the ſcripture is ane vertue quharby we beleif nocht allanerly that thair is ane trew leuand God, quhilk is eternal, almychty, mercifull, rychteous &amp; faithful, bot alſwa we gif ferme credit to his word, quhilk is ſa trew that na thing can be trewar. Quhat thing ſuld moue vs to beleif the word of God? Trewly twa thingis. The ane is ye eternal and infallible verite of God, fra quhom na leſing may ꝓcede, na mair than myrknes may cum fra the cleir ſchenand ſonne. Thairfor it is writtin: Non eſt deus quaſi homo vt mentiatur, nec vt filius hominis vt mutetur.
                        Nu. xxiii. God is nocht as a mā yat may mak ane leſing, nor ȝit as ye ſone of man yat may be changeit. And our ſaluiour ſaid ſpekand as GOD: Ego ſum via veritas et vita. I am the way, ye verite and lyif▪
                        Ihon. xiiii And he ſais alſwa: Coelum et terra tranſibunt▪

Thus we ſuld gyf ferme credit to the word of GOD, becauſe GOD that ſpekis it, is ye eternal &amp; infallible verite. The ſecund thing ye ſuld moue vs to beleif ye word of GOD &amp; to knaw quhilk is the worde of GOD, quhilk ar the haly bukis quharin the word of GOD is contenit, and quhat is the trew ſence of the ſame

The thrid principal vertue is Hoip, quharof it is writtin: Qui timetis dominum ſperate in illū, &amp; in oblectationem veniet vobis miſericordia. ȝe that feris our Lord, hoip in him, and his mercy ſall cum to ȝow with pleſour. Quhat is Hoip? It is ane vertew quharby we lippin to get all gudnes fra God, mercy and grace in this warld, and eternal blys in the warld to cum.Pſal. 146. Of the firſt ſais the Prophet in the Pſalme: Beneplacitum eſt domino ſuper timentes eum, et in eis qui ſperant ſuper miſericordia eius. Our Lord hais pleſour vpō yame yat fearis him, and allwa vpon yame yat hoippis vpon his mercy. And quhy ſuld we nocht put all our traiſt and confidens in the mercy of God, ſeand that he biddis vs call vpon him in tyme of our nede, and promiſſis to

heir and help vs:Pſal. 49. 
                        Inuoca me in die tribulationis, eruam te et honorificabis me. Call vpon me (ſais our Lord God) in the day of thi trubil, and I ſal delyuir the, and for that thow ſall honour me. And ſuerly we ſuld nocht miſtreſt him, for he ſais thus be his Prophet Eſaie: Nunquid obliuiſci poteſt mulier infantē ſuū, vt nō miſereatur filio vteri ſui?
                        Eſaie. 49

Will a woman forȝet hir ȝonge barne, and nocht haif pitie on the ſone of hir wambe, &amp; ſuppois ſche forȝet, ȝet I ſal nocht forȝet ye, ſais our Lord. Of the ſecund and principall part quhilk is expectatioun or loking for the blys of heuin to be geuin to vs be ye grace of God principally, &amp; our merittis ſecundly (quhilk merittis als ar ye giftis of God eftir ſainct Auguſtine.) Sainct Paul ſais thus:Roma. 5. 
                        Gloriamur in ſpe glorie filiorum dei. We glore and ar blyth throw ye hoip quhilk we haif to cum to the glore quhilk is promiſſit to the ſonnis of God. Quhat ſuld moue vs maiſt to hoip in ye mercy and glore of God? Veraily that God is trew &amp; faythful in keping of his promis, according as ye Prophet ſais in the Pſalme:Pſal. 144 
                        Fidelis dn̄s in omnibus verbis ſuis, &amp; ſanctus in omnibus operibus ſuis. Faythful is our Lord in all his wordis, &amp; haly in all his deidis. Now as he hais els fulfillit his promis in geuing of his mercy &amp; glore to his ſainctis in heuin, as Patriarchis, Prophetis, Apoſtils Martyris, Confeſſours &amp; Virginis, ſa ſuld we traiſt and hoip, that he will fulfill his promis to vs,

Ȝe yat feris our Lord lufe him, and ȝour hartis ſalbe lichtit with the licht of grace in this warld, and with the lycht of glore in the warld to cum. Quhate is cherite? It is lufe, quharbywe lufe god for his awin ſaik, becauſe he is al gudnes, &amp; fra him cummis al gudnes, and our neichbour for gods ſaik, or in God. Quhow ſuld we lufe God? Four maner of wayis, as it is gaderit out of ſyndrie placis of the ſcripture, &amp; al reherſit togidder in ſainct Lukis euangil:Luce. x 
                        Diliges dominū deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et ex tota anima tua et ex oībus viribus tuis, et ex tota mente tua. Thow ſall lufe thi Lord God with all thi hart, with all thi ſaule and with all thi ſtrenth and with all thi mynde, That is to ſay, lat all thi thochtis, all the partis of thi lyf, all thi wittis and vnderſtanding, all thi labour ſtrenth and diligence be direckit to God, and occupied in his lufe and ſeruice, of quhom yow hais all thir thingis geuin to the.

Trewly thai that luffis God with ane trew knawlege in yair vnderſtanding, haifand ane trew fayth in ye word of God without ony dout errour or herilie. Thairfor quhaſaeuir doutis or erris in ye faith or ſtifly haldis ony fals opinioun condemnit be the kirk for heriſie, yai lufe nocht God with al yair hart Secund, quha luffis GOD with all thair ſaule?

Thridly quha luffis God with all thair mynd? Thai that luffis God with ane perfite remembrāce, and forȝettis nocht quhat God hais done for thame, bot euir mair to yair powar thinkꝭ of ye benefitis of God quhilk he hes geuin to yame in thair creatioun▪ conſeruatioun, redemptiun and dalie prouiſiun▪ baith temporal &amp; ſpirituall in body and ſaule.

And laſt of all thai lufe God with all thair ſtrenth and powar, quhilk ar content to occupy the ſtrenth of thair body and al the powar thairof in ye ſeruice of God, according to his command all the dayis of yair life. Thai lufe nocht God with al thair ſtrenth quhaſaeuir occupyis yair ſtrēth in doing euil dedis

Of quhome ſanct Paul ſais:Roma. x. 
                        Ignorantes enim iuſticiā dei, &amp; ſuam querentes ſtatuere, iuſticie dei non ſunt ſubiecti. Miſkenning the rychteouſnes of God, and willing to maintene thair awin rychteouſnes, thai ar nocht ſubdewit to the rychteouſnes that is of valour afore God. Aucht, quha euir luffis ony creature abone god,
                        Spiritual ydolatrie or mair yan god, that ſame man in a maner makis a God of that creature, and cōmittis ſpiritual ydolatrie. Sa the couatous man makis a god of his warldly geir, the glowton makis a god of his wambe, gif a man dois ony thing aganis the command of God for pleſure or lufe of his wyfe or barnis

Thus in ald tyme the Gentilis throw the blindnes of thair hartis, inſtrunctioun and prouokation of the deuil, cōmittit corporal ydolatrie, to the greit iniure of God and damnation of yair ſaulis. Part of thame worſchippit with godly honour the Sone,Sapi. xiii. the Mone and the ſternis. Part of thame worſchippit with godly honour the fyre, wynde or ane of the elementis. Some of thame gaif Gods honour to thame that was mortal men, as Iupiter, Mercurius, Mars, Venus, Diana with mony vthers. And nocht only thai tuke for thair goddis ſiclike mortal men and vther creaturis, bot alſwa the ymagis of men and of vther creaturis, of quhome S. Paul ſais thus:Roma. i.

boſting of punition aganis all yame quhilk leiffis his faith, and gangis to idolatrie and hereſie, fallis fra his hoip and confidens, to miſtraiſt and diſperacioun, &amp; hais na trew lufe of God, bot rather contemptioun. All ſiclike perſonis leiffis God the ſpiritual huſband of thair ſaule, and committis ſpiritual fornicatioun with ye creaturis. Aganis quhom the Prophet ſais thus in the Pſalme: Perdi diſti omnes qui fornicantur abs te.

                         Thow O gud Lord hais deſtroyit all thame quhilkis committis fornicatioun, luffand ony creature mair thane the. As it is plainlie knawin, yat man is properly callit a Ielius or eyndland man, quhilk luffis his wife ſa mekil, that all tymes with greit cure and diligens, he takis tent, that na man ſteir or prouok hir till adultrie, that ſche be nocht begylit throw faire wordis or giftis ſpokin or giffin to that effeck. Efter ſiclike maner of ſpeking, GOD almychty is callit ane Ielius or eyndland god, for als mekil as he will nocht be content gyf we lufe ony creature mair thane him, feir ony, or traiſt in ony creature mair thane in him, quhilk gif we do we commit ſpiritual fornicatioun to the diſpleſour of God, and damnatioun of our ſaulis. And to this effeck, in the end of yis firſt command, God giffis a ſair comminatioun of rygorous punitioun aganis thame that leiffis him &amp; contemnis him, and alſwa ane ſwete &amp; pleſand promis of his mercy till al yame quhilk bydis &amp; cleuis faſt with trew fayth, hoip and cherite to him, to the entent, that the tranſgreſſouris, at the leiſt for feir of paine, may begin to turne agane to him, and all

gud men and wemen, with ioy &amp; blythnes may gang in the way of Gods commandis, till the kingdome of heuin. The ſentence of the comminatioun is this. I will viſit &amp; punis the ſynnis quhilk the fatheris dois, nocht only on the fatheris, bot alſwa on thair ſonnis, procedand to the thrid &amp; fourt generatioun, gif ſa be that the ſonnis follow the euil exemple of yair fa

                     Now quhat is the ſwete and pleſand promis of mercy, quhilk God makis till all gud men? It is this. I will ſchaw and gif mercy vntill a thouſand, quhilk luffis me and keipis my command. Behald chriſtin man, how (as ye prophet ſais) the mercy of God is aboue all his warkis, and as ſais ſanct Iames:Iaco. 2. The mercy of God gangis aboue his iugement, according as he ſais in the Pſalme:Pſal. 88.

As we reid in the euangil of ſanct Mathew, thair came ane doctour of ye law till our ſaluiour, and proponit til him a queſtioun, tempand him &amp; ſaid: Magiſter quod eſt mandatum magnū in lege? Maſtir, quhat is the greit command of the law? To this queſtion our ſaluiour maid anſweir, reherſand twa cōmandꝭ of lufe, quharof the tane was this. Thow ſall lufe thi Lord God with all thi hart, and with al thi ſaule and with al thi mynd. This is the greteſt and firſt command. And of this command of lufe quhilk we aw to our Lord God, we maid declaratioun in the expoſition of the firſt command. The ſecund command is of the lufe quhilk we aw till our nychbour, quhilk is this: Diliges proximum tuum, ſicut teipſū. Thow ſal lufe thi nychbour as thi ſelf.Mat. xxii. For the plain vnderſtanding of this command of lufe, the wordis is to be notit quhilk ſanct Paule ſais to ye Romanis: Qui diligit proximū, legem impleuit.

And quhaſa luffis thair nychbour, yai keip the ſeuen commādis writtin in ye ſecund tabil, quhilk ordouris and direckis vs to ye trew lufe of our nychbour. Sa we may weil conclude, yat quhaſaeuir luffis thair nychbour trewly, thai fulfil the hail law of moral cō

                        The ordour of the fift command Thou ſal nocht cōmit ſlauchter. Quhat is the ordour of the fift command? The man that is content to do his dewtie to God and thame that ar his reularis vnder God, may eſely be counſellit to do his dewtie to al his nychbouris. And be ye contrary

he is redie to do ſkayth to his nychbour quhilk nother feiris God nor man in Gods ſtede. Thairfor be iuſt ordour efter ye thre firſt commandis, quhilk biddis vs do our dewtie to God, and efter the fourt cōmand quhilk biddis vs do our dewtie til our fatheris in Goddis ſtede, followis the laif of the commandis, quhilk ar ſix in nowmer, and giffis till vs inſtructioun how we ſuld ordour our ſelf till our nychbour, in deid, word, and deſire of hart. And becauſe that till our nychbour na temporal or erdly thing is darrar and mair precious yane is his awin bodylie lyfe, in this fift command God almychty forbiddis vs to do ony ſkayth till our nychbour in his perſone, quharby we may hurt his bodylie life. Quhat is the trew expoſioun of yis cōmand?The expoſitioun of Chriſt maid to the fift command Math. 5. Our heuinly maſter and ſaluiour Chriſt Ieſus exponis this command in the euangil of ſanct Mathew on this maner: Audiſtis quia dictum eſt anti quis: non occides. Qui autem occiderit reus erit iudicio. Ego autem dico vobis quia omnis qui iraſcitur fratri ſuo reus erit iudicio. Qui autē dixerit fratri ſuo racha, reus erit concilio. Qui autem dixerit fatue, reus erit gehēne ignis. Ȝe haif hard how it was ſaid to yame of auld tyme: Thow ſall nocht commit ſlauchter. For he that ſlais ſal be giltie of the iugement. Bot I ſay to ȝow, quhaſaeuir hais hettrent at his brother ſalbe giltie &amp; in dangeir of the iugement. And quhaſaeuir ſais to his brother racha (that is ane lythleful crabit word) he is giltie and in dangeir of the counſell. And quhaſaeuir ſais to his brother fuile, he ſalbe giltie &amp; in dangeir of the fire of hell.

In thir wordis our ſaluiour techis that the law of God is ſpiritual. For to fulfil this command:That the lavv of Godis ſpiritual. thow ſall nocht ſlay or comit ſlauchter, it is nocht yneuch to keip thi handis or outwart membres fra

                        Audiſtis quia dictum eſt antiquis, non mecha beris. Ego autē dico vobis, quia omnis qui viderit mulierem ad concupiſcendum eam, iam mechatus eſt eā in corde ſuo.

Lyk as hettrent, wrath, and malice of ye hart, is the rute and beginning of al mannis ſlauchter, ſa is carnal deſyre, luſt and concupiſcence of the hart the rute &amp; beginning of adultery &amp; all kind of lichorie. Quhat is the rycht keping of this command?The rycht keping of this command. To be chaiſt in mynd, word &amp; deid, to be tēperat in meit, drink &amp; ſleip, to put away all occaſionis of lechorie, quhairof all kindꝭ ar heir forbiddin, ſuppoſe adultery be ſpecially namit. For, fornicatioun was nocht tholit amangis ye Iewis vnpuniſſit, as oppin huirdom and manifeſt adulterie is daily doin amang chriſtin men, aganis the command of God. Mairouir,Leuit. xx. amang the Iewis inceſt and ſynnis aganis nature was puniſſit with deade, as it is ſchawin plainly in the buke of Leuittis.

And agane he ſais in the ſame cheptour: Mulier innupta et virgo, cogitat que domini ſunt, vt ſit ſācta &amp; corpore &amp; ſpiritu.

Knaw this and vnderſtand, that na huirmaiſter or fornicatour, na vnclein perſone or cowatous (quhilk is ye wyrſchippar of ydollis) hais heretage in ye kingdom of Chriſt &amp; of god.

Thairfor O chriſtin mā lat euirmair the wechtie cōmand of ſanct Paule ſound in thi eris, quhen he ſais:

                        Fugite fornicationem. Fle fornicatioun.
                           
                              •
                           . Cor. 6. Gyf yow ſpeir at me, how may I fle fornicatioun? Trewly, quhen thow fleis fra all thai thingis quhilk ar the occaſionis of fornicatioun foſteris and kepis a man or a woman in fornicatioun, as is vaine, ydil and lychorous thochtis &amp; vnclein deſyris of carnal luſt and pleſour. Gluttony and all erces in eittng and drinking, all ydilnes of the boby with lang ſleping, all company of wantone, lycht and lychorous perſonis, all foule wordis and vnhoneſt talking. That thir ar the occaſionis, nuriſſing &amp; vphalding of ye ſyn of lychorie it is plainly ſchawin in the xvi. cheptour of the Prophet Ezechiel, quhair it is ſaid to the peple of Iſrael: Hec fuit iniquitas Sodome ſororis tue, ſuperbia, ſaturitas panis,
                        Eze. 16.

                              •
                           us et filiarum eius. This was the iniquitie, that is to ſay, ye occaſionis of wickitnes of Sodome thi ſiſter, pryde, welth of meit &amp; aboundance, and the ydilnes of hir and all hir dochteris. In thir wordis ȝe may vnderſtand plainly, that ſuppoſe Sodoma with ye laif of the citeis was vtterly deſtroyit for the ſyn of the fleſche abhominabil and nocht to be ſpokin, ȝit the ſpecial occaſionis quhilk inducit &amp; brocht yame to the vſe of the ſame ſyn, was yair pryde, yair glutony &amp; yair ydilnes. Sa ȝe may ſe yat it is trew yat the wiſman ſais: Qui amar periculum in illo peribit. He yat luffis the perrel mone peris in ye ſame,Eccle. iii. that is to ſay, he yat will do ony thing quhilk is the occaſioun of ſyn, he mone neidis fall in the ſame ſyn and ſa finally peris except he amēd his lyfe be trew penance. And ſa conclude that na man can eſchew fornicatioun except he fle the occaſionis of ye ſame.

Now laſt of all quhat ſpecial rewardis God giffis to all thame quhilk leiuis ane chaſt lyfe,Special revvardis promiſſit to the keparis of this command. i. Cor. 6. the ſame Apoſtil declaris in the ſame place afore allegite: An ne

                     The firſt is to vſe diſcretioun in all our ſpeking, conſiderand alwais afore we ſpek, quhat

we ar to ſay, to quhome we ſpek in tyme and place conuenient, and becauſe ſik diſcretioun is a gift of God, we ſuld pray to God for it, ſayand with the Prophet in the Pſalme. Pone domine cuſtodiam ori meo,
                        Pſal. 140 
                        et oſtium circumſtātie labiis meis. I beſeik the, O gud Lord, put a keping to my mouth, Lord I pray the gife me thi grace, quhairby I may dant and refrane my toung fra all vaine and euil wordis, and to ſpek allanerly gud wordis, with dew circumſtance of reſone. And the Apoſtil ſanct Paule ſais:Iaco. iii. 
                        Si quis in verbo non offendit, hic perfectus eſt vir. Gyf a man offend or ſyn nocht in his worde, he is ane perfite man. Heir ȝe ſuld nocht vnderſtand yat the perfectioun of a chriſtin man ſtandis onlie in gud gyding of our toung, for vndoutand, it ſtandis principally in perfite lufe and cheritie, as ſanct Paule declaris to the Colloſiens, ſayand: Super omnia charitatē habere,
                        Coloſ. iii. 
                        quod eſt vinculum perfectionis. Abone all thingis haif cheritie, quhilk is the band of perfectioun. Nochtheles, gud gyding of the toung, is a ſpecial takin of perfectioun, and ſa ſanct Iames callis a mā yat ſynnis nocht in his toung, to be ane perfite man, for as mekil as he hes ane ſpecial takin of ane chriſtin mannis perfectioun. And to gyde our toung with diſcretioun, ſanct Iames exhortis vs be twa familiar exemples.
                     
                        
                        Iaco. iii.The firſt is of a brydil, ſayand: Si autem equis frena in ora immittimus, ad conſentiendum nobis, omne corpus illorum circumferimus. Behald lais he, we put brydillis into the hors mouthis, that yai ſuld obey vs, and we turne about all thair bodie. Mekil mair ſuld we put the brydil of diſcretioun apon our toungis, to dant thame and cauſe thame to obey the command of God in thair ſpeking.
                     The ſecund exempil is of ane rudder of a ſchip: Ecce naues cum magnae ſint, et a ventis validis minentur, circumferuntur autem modico gubernaculo, vbi impetus dirigentis voluerit. Behald alſo the ſchippis, ſuppoſe yai be large &amp; gret, and dreuin with gret windis ȝit ar yai turnit about with a verrai ſmale Helme or Rudder, quhairto ſaeuir the ſchipmen will. euin ſa the toung of man and womā ſuld be turnit be ye rudder of diſcretioun, quhairto ſaeuir the law of God will.
                     The thrid thing that ſuld moue vs to gyde our toung weil, is to conſidder oftymes quhat hurt and ſkaith cummis of ane euil toung, quhilk ſanct Iames declacis in the place afore allegit, ſayand thus: Ecce quantus ignis, quam magnā ſi

                           uam accendit &amp; lingua ignis eſt vniuerſitas iniquitatis. Behald how gret a thing a litil fyre kendillis, and the toung is a fyre, quhilk ſumtyme is ane occaſioun of all wykitnes. As it mycht be ſaid plainely, as ane litil fyre may burne and diſtroy a gret nowmer of treis, gret houſis, palacis and tounis, ſa ane euil toung may kendil mekil euil as ſtryif, contentioun and ſeditioun, hereſeis and ſciſmis, to the diſtructioun of

mekil vertew, &amp; mony verteous men. It followis: Lingua conſtituitur in membris noſtris, qui ma

Sa is the toung ſet amang our membris, yat it defylit the hail bodie, and ſettis a fyre the hail courſe of our lyfe, and is it ſelf ſet a fyre euin of hel. The ſentence of thir wordis is this. The toung of man and woman is ane of the leiſt membris of all the bodie, quhilk gif it be nocht refrenit and dantit fra euil wordis be diſcretioun, may hurt and ſkayth al the hail bodie, for oft tymes the hail bodie is brocht to mekil cummer and payne, for the falt of the toung. Or be the bodie we may vnderſtand the hail congregatioun and cumpany of the pepil, for as we oft ſe be experiens, ane euil toung bringis ane hail congregatioun or cumpany to mekil cummer and payne. Mairouir, ane euil toung, ſpecially of ane euil giffin counſellour, fals prechour or techar, may kendil ye hartis of men and wemen to hereſie and vthir ſynnis, and thairin to remaine fra the tyme of yair ȝouthede, to the tyme of thair auld, ſa mekil euil may ſpring out fra ane euil toung. Gyf ȝe ſpeir quha hais kendillit ſa mekil euil in the toung of man and woman? Se quha puttis ſa mekil euil in the toung? Trewly, nocht almychty God, for he hais wallit and defēdit the toung with certane teith and twa lippis, to ſignifie that the toung ſuld nocht be haſtie in ſpeking, bot yat it ſuld ſpeik with auiſment and diſcretioun.

All the nature of beſtis and byrdis, and of ſerpentes, &amp; vther of the ſee, ar meikit and dantit be the nature of man, bot the toung of ſum men &amp; wemen can na man dant, it is ane vnrewly euil full of deadly poyſone. As he mycht ſay: thair is na wyld beſt ſa wyld, thair is na foule ſa fors, na ſerpentis ſa peſtilent, na beſt of the ſee ſa cruel, bot be the ingyne, induſtrie &amp; craft of man, thai may be dantit. Lyonis ar maid gentil and meik, Tygaris ar maid myld, Drachonis ar dantit. Eliphantis mak ſeruice to mā, Cockatryces ar brocht in ſubiectioun, ſerpentis ar tamit, Ernys and Eglis ar maid familiar to the hand of mā, bot the euil toung (of ſum men and wemen) may na man dant. And quhy? Becauſe it is ſa wyld, yat it will nocht be rewlit, it is ſa ful of poyſone, that na medicine of gud counſel can help it. Thus be gud conſideratioun of the gret hurt &amp;

ſkaith that cummis of ane toung, we ſuld ſeir to refrein our toung with diſcretioun.
                     The thrid thing that cauſis a man or a womā to haif a gud toung,Reformatioun of our hart is neceſſary to ye gud gyding of our toung Math. 12. is reformation of our hart or of our mynd, for as our ſaluiour ſais in the euangil of ſanct Mathew: Progenies viperarum, quomodo poteſtis bona loqui cum ſicis mali? Ex abundantia enim cordis os loquitur. O ȝe generatioun of ſerpentis, how can ȝe ſpek gud, quhen ȝe ȝour ſelfis ar euil? for of the abundance of the hart ye mouth ſpekis. Bonus enim homo de bono theſauro profert bona, et malus homo de malo theſauro profert mala. A gud mā, out of the gud treſour of his hart bringis furth gud thingis, &amp; ane euil mā, out of his euil treſour brīgis furth euil thingis. Be thir wordis of our ſaluiour, it is manifeſt and plaine, yat na mā can ſpeik gud wordis to the pleſour of God and edificatioun of thair nychtbour, except that he haif ane gud hart or mynd indewit and annor

Quha brekis this command?Brekaris of the viii. command Specially yai that beris in iugement fals witnes. Fyrſt thai offend almychty God quhais veritie thai denye and forſakis opinly.

Is yair ony paine or punitioun expremit in the ſcripture aganis yame yat brekis yis command, be ſpeking of euil wordis? Ȝis trewly. Firſt to ſpeik in general, the wiſman ſais: Qui cuſtodit os ſuum, cuſtodit animam ſuam, qui autem inconſideratus eſt ad loquendum, ſentiet mala. He yat kepis his mouth, kepis his ſaule or his lyfe, bot he yat ſpekis without cōſideratioun and auiſment, ſal feil trubil and paine. And to ſpeik in ſpecial, the wiſman ſais:Pro. xix.

And ſanct Paule in the firſt to the Romanis, reherſand yai ſynnaris quhilk is worthi the dead eternal, puttis amang thame detractouris, bakbytaris or ſclanderaris, ſayand: Detractores deo odibiles. Bakbytaris (ſais he) ar hettit of God. Alſo the wiſman ſpeikis of thame yat ar quyſperaris, rowkaris &amp; rounaris on this maner: Suſurro inquinabit animam ſuam,
                        Eccle. xxi. 
                        et in omnibus odietur. A rowkar and rownar, ſall fyle his awin ſaule, &amp; ſal be hettit of all men. Mair ouir he ſais: Suſurro, et bilinguis maledictus erit,
                        Eccle. 28. 
                        multos enim turbauit pacem habentes. A man or a woman that is ane rowkar and doubil toungit, is curſit and wariit, for ſiclik ane perſone hes put mekil trubil amang men &amp; wemen, quhilk afore was at peace. And to be ſchort with ȝow, our ſaluiour declaris this mattir in few wordis, ſayand thus: Dico autem vobis, quoniā omne verbum ocioſum,
                        Math. xii. 
                        quod locuti fuerint homines, reddant rationem de eo in die iudicii. Bot I ſay to ȝow, that ilkane idil word, quhilk men and wemen ſpeikis, thairof thai ſall gife ane compt in the day of iugement.
                     Now ſene we mone gife ane compt to God in the day of iugement, of all our ydil wordis quhilk ar

vaine and vnprofitabil till vs and our nychtbour, mekil mair it followis, yat we mone gife ane compt of all our euil wordꝭ, blaſphemous wordis, backbyting &amp; ſclandering wordis, lycherous wordis, inuious wordis, treful, prydful and malicious wordis with ſicklike. Quhat will ȝe mair? as it followis be the wordis of our ſaluiour: Ex verbis tuis iuſtificaberis, et ex verbis tuis cōdemnaberis. Thow ſal be iuſtifeit be thi wordis, gif yai be conforme to the law of God, and ſpokin of ane gud mynd, &amp; thow ſall be condemnit for thi wordis, gif thai be aganis the law of God,The revvardis of thame yat kepis this cōmand. Pro. 21. and ſpokin of ane euil mynd. And ſa it is nocht difficill to ken how God almychty rewardis yame yat ſpekis gud wordis, with ane gud mynd. The wiſman ſais: Qui cuſtodit os ſuum, et linguam ſuam, cuſtodit a tribulatione animam ſuā. He that kepis his mouth and his toung, kepis his ſaule or his lyfe fra trubil. And the Prophet king Dauid ſais in the Pſalme:Pſ. xxxiii. 
                        Quis eſt homo qui vult vitam, et diligit dies videre bonos? Quhat is the man that wald haif life, and luffis to fee gud dais? To this queſtioun he anſweris and ſais: Prohibe linguam tuā a malo, et labia tua ne loquantur dolū
                         Refraine thi toung fra ſpekin euil wordꝭ, and ſtop thi lippis that thai ſpeik na diſſait. In thir wordis the Prophet techis, that commonly be gud gyding of our toung, we may cum to mekil reſt and tranquillitie, nocht only to be had in this temporal lyfe, bot alſo in the lyfe to cum, quhilk we luke for in the kingdome of heuin, quhilk he grant vs, that bocht vs with his precious blude. Amen.

                           . Our ſaluiour declaris this in the Euangil, in the deidis of almous, praying and faſting. Of this ee of our intentioun, our ſaluiour ſais thus: Lucerna corporis tui, eſt oculus tuus. Si oculus tuus fuerit ſimplex, totum corpus tuum lucidum erit. Si autem oculus tuus fuerit nequā, totum corpus tuum tenebroſum erit. Si ergo lumen quod in te eſt tenebre ſunt, ipſe tenebre quante erunt? Thi ee is the lycht of thi body. Gyf thi ee than be ſimpill and clein all thi bodie ſall be full of lycht, bot and gyf thine ee be wykit, all thi body ſall be full of myrknes. That is to ſay, gif thi

Schortly, in al thi deidis intēd thi nychtbouris weil and profite, as thi awin.
                     
                        The deſcriptioun of ane clein hartA clein hart is yat quhilk hais na inordinat deſyre of warldly geir, bodelie luſt &amp; warldly honour. A clein hart is that quhilk is content to ſerue God▪ nocht principally for ony warldly pleſour or profite, bot rather for his awin lufe &amp; gudnes. A clein hart is that quhilk is hail giffin to the lufe of God and our nychtbour. A clein hart is yat quhilk luffis his nychtbour lykwais nocht for his geir, or vther carnal affectionis, bot maiſt of all for the lufe of God.

Schortly, the rycht keping of thir twa commandis is to be blyth of thi nychbouris honour and profite, deſyre the ſamyn, and help him thairto.
                     
                        Quha brekis this tvva commandis.Quha brekis thir twa commandis? Fyrſt, quha yat with a deliuerit mynd and full conſent, deſyris to haif thair nychtbouris wyfe, to commit adultery with hir. Lykwais, quha yat with ful conſent wald fulfill thair carnal luſt with ony woman quhilk is nocht his mareit wyfe. Quha lykwais wald haif

his nychtbour partit fra his lauchfull wyfe, that he mycht haif hir, or ony vther vngodly cauſe. Quha inuies his nychtbour, yat he hais ane honeſt womā to his wyfe. Quha cowattis inordinatly thair nychtbouris geir, deſyr and with full conſent, to get geir fra him vniuſtly, or by vnlauchfull contrackis, be ſuttiltie, falſat and deſait. Quha wald haif ony mānis ſeruand fra his maiſter vniuſtly, &amp; by his maiſteris wil. Quha inuies yair nychbours, beand blyth of his hurt and aduerſitie, and ſorie of his weil and proſperitie. Schortly al lycherous, inuious, &amp; cowatous men, brekis thir twa cōmandis.

Agane: Non ergo regnet peccatū in veſtro mortali corpore, vt obediatis concupiſcen eiis eius. Lat nocht ſyn regne in ȝour mortal bodeis, that ȝe ſuld obey the luſt of it. Declaratioun of this matter we haif in the hiſtorie of Adamis fall and firſt ſyn.Gene. iii. The ſerpent come and maid ſuggeſtioun and gaif counſel to breik the command of God. Eue the woman, begane to haif delectatioun in the ſycht of the frute forbiddin.

Adame willing to content the mynd of the woman, conſentit, and eit it, and ſa braik the command of God, to the gret dammage &amp; ſkaith of him ſelf and all his poſteritie. The ſame proces is daily found in cōmitting of our ſynnis.

                     TO conclude this doctrine, quhilk we haif giffin to ȝow of the law &amp; cōmandis of God, we exhort ȝow till haif alwayis in ȝour remembrance thir wordis of S. Paule: Scimus autē, quia lex bona eſt,
                     i. Timo. i. 
                     ſi quis ea legitime vtatur. We knaw (ſais he) that the law is gud, gif a mā will vſe it weil. For ſuppoſe ȝe knaw the law of God, ȝit &amp; ȝe knaw nocht ye rycht vſe of the law of God, or how that ȝe ſuld vſe the law of God dailie to ȝour edificatioun, ȝour knawlege will do ȝow litill gud. Quhairfor we think it expedient to declare to ȝow the rycht vſe of the law be plaine &amp; familiar exempillis, to that effeck, that quhenſaeuir ȝe heir the law, or ony part of the law expremit to ȝow, ȝe may conſiddir the rycht vſe of it, and ſa apply the law to ȝour gret profite and ſpiritual edificatioun.
                  Firſt chriſtin pepill,The exemple of ane torch. ȝe ſuld vſe the law of God as ȝe wald vſe ane Torche quhen ȝe gang hayme to ȝour houſe in a myrke nycht, for as the Torche or

Bowat ſchawis ȝow lycht to deſcerne the rycht waie hayme to ȝour houſe, fra the wrang way, and alſo to deſcerne the clein way, fra the foule way. Euin ſa aucht ȝe to vſe ye law or command of God, as a Torche, Bowat or Lanterin. For doutles, the law of God giffis ye lycht of knawlege to deſcerne ȝour hie way hayme to ȝour dwelling placis in heuin, fra the wrang way yat leidis to hel. For as the ſtrecht way to heuin is the rycht keping of thir ten commandis, according as our ſaluiour ſais:Math. 19. 
                     Si vis ad vitā ingredi, ſerua mandata. Gyf thow will entir to the lyfe, keip the commandis, ſa the wrang way is to breik ony of the ten cōmandis. Sa quhen thow hais gottin knawlege and vnderſtanding of all thir ten commandis or of ony ane of yame, thai▪ cōſiddir thi ſelf quhair thow gangis, and gif yu ken thi ſelf to gang the narrow way of vertew that leidis to heuin, be blyth in God, and thank him of his grace, and aſk at him the gift of perſeuerance, and gif thow thinkis thi ſelf out of the hie and clein way of vertew, and that thow art gangand in the braid and hie foule way of deadly ſyn that leidis to hel, incontinent cum agane to the hie way of vertew, quhilk is commandit in the law of God, ſayand with the prophet in the Pſalme:Pſal. 118. 
                     Cogitaui vias meas, et conuerti pedes meos in teſtimonia tua. I haif conſiderit my wayis, quhairin I haif gane wrang gaitis, and I haif turnit my feit into thi commandis, gud Lord, becauſe yai allanerly is my

ſtrecht way to the kingdome of heuin. Gyf thow ſay agane to me, quha will tell me quhen I am in the rycht way, and quhen I am in the wrang way? Trewly thi awin conſcience will tel the, being informit be the trew knawlege of the commandis of God. And this rycht vſe of the law is geuin vs be the wiſman in the Prouerbes, ſayand thus to his ſone: Cōſerua fili mi precepta patris tui,
                     Prouer. 6. 
                     &amp; ne dimit tas legē matris tue, liga eā in corde tuo iugiter, &amp; circumda gutturi tuo. Cum ambulaueris, gradiātut tecum, cum dormieris, cuſtodiant te, et euigilans loquere cum eis, quia mandatum lucerna eſt, et lex lux, et via vite increpatio diſcipline. O my ſone (ſais the wiſman) keip the commandis of thi father, and leif nocht the law of thi mother. Bynd yame to gidder continually in thi hart, and feſtin yame faſt about thi half, quhen thow gangis lat thame gang with the, quhen thow ſleipis, lat thame keip the, &amp; quhen thow walknys, ſpeik with thame. For the command is the Lanterin, a Torche or ane candel, and the law is lycht and the way of lyfe and correctioun of euil maneris &amp; derectioun to gud maneris.
                  The ſecund exempil (quhairby we may knaw the rycht vſe of the law) is of ane myrrour,The exempil of ane myrrour. quhairin a man or a woman behaldis thair awin face, to that effeck, that gif thai ſee thair face blekkit, thai may gang to the wattir to weſche thame. Euin ſa ȝe ſuld vſe the law or the commandis of God.

General fayth is ane gift, quhair throch we ken yat yair is ane trew God, and trowis fermely that all quhatſaeuir is ſet furth to vs of God, other in the haly write, or in the diffinitionis of general counſellis repreſentand the vniuerſal kirk, gaderit in the haly ſpirit is ſa trew, that na thing can be trewar, ſuppoſe thai excede the capacite of natural reaſone, becauſe that the haly ſpret, quhilk is giffar of the ſcripture, and techear of haly kirk, is the ſpret of veritie. Is this general faith, be the quhilk we trow yair is ane god, ſufficient for our ſaluatioun? Vndoutand it is nocht ſufficient, for mony Gentillis, ſpecially Philoſophouris be the ſycht &amp; knawlege of the creatouris had a part of this general faith, and come to ye knawlege of ane trew god,Roma. i. his eternal powar &amp; diuinitie, bot becauſe thai wald nocht thank him, glorify and ſerue him, as yair God, thair knawlege was deade, ydil and vayne, and ſwa thai vaniſſit away in thair mynd be ydolatrie and vthir abhominabil ſynnis, and ſa thai periſchit, as it is declarit in the firſt to the Romanis. Alſo mony euil chriſtin men and wemen beleiffis be this general fayth as the kirk d

                     is, bot becauſe thai want the ſpecial faith yat wyrkis be leiffand cheritie,Titum. i. thai can nocht be ſaiffit. Of quhome we may verifie the wordis of ſanct

Paule, ſayand thus: Confitentur ſe noſſe deū, factis autem negant. Thai ſaie thai knaw God, bot thai deny him with thair deidis. Mairouir as ſanct Iames ſais: Demones credunt &amp; contremiſcunt.
                     Iaco. 2. The deuillis trowis yat yair is ane God, &amp; for feir of his terribil iugement thai tremyl. Sa thow ſeis that it is nocht ſufficient to beleif, that thair is ane God eternal, and that all ſpokin of him in haly write, is trew, becauſe it is bot ane general faith, common to gud men and euil men, to men &amp; deuillis, al kennis perfitly that God can nocht mak ane leſing.
                  Quhat is the ſpecial and quick faith,Ane ſpecial faith. quhilk is in all gud chriſtin men and wemen? It ſtandis in thre pointis. The firſt is before ſaid, to trow that thair is ane God, and yat all the hiſtoreis writtin of God in haly write, is trew as that he is ane God in ſubſtance and thre in perſonis, that the ſame bliſſit Trinite is makar of heuin and erd, &amp; of all creatouris viſibil and inuiſibil, yat he hais geuin to vs be handis of Moyſes the ten commandis, to keip vnder the paine of eternal dānatioun, with al vthir hiſtoreis in the haly write, other in deteſtatioun of ſyn or in cōmendatioun of vertew. Secund, becauſe we ar brekaris of the law, we ſuld be knawlege of the ſame faith▪ feir all the comminationis, ſchoringis or boſtingis, quhilk God makis in the ſcripture aganis the tranſgreſſouris of the law, thinkand that thai ar maid agane ilkane of vs in ſpecial. Thridly, we throw feir of God beginnand to repent our ſelf for our ſynnis, ſuld hoip to optene the mercy &amp; grace, quhilk God promiſſis in Chriſt

to al &amp; ſundry faithful &amp; penitent men &amp; wemen. Breuely, to commit our ſelf hailely to God, to put our hai

This faith obtenis to vs the abundant grace of the haly ſpret,Gala. iii. quhilk powris into our hartis ye trew lufe of God and of our nychtbour. This is the faith ſpecial, leiffand and wyrkand, that is ſa mekil commendit of our ſaluiour in the euangil, and of ſanct Paule in his Epiſtillis. This is the faith yat iuſtifeis a chriſtin mā according as ſanct Paule ſais to the Romanis: Iuſticat
                           •

                     Roma. 5. We being iuſtifyit he faith, hais peace in our conſcience with God. This is the faith that makis vs the barnis of God, according as ſanct Paul ſais to

the Galathianis:Gala. iii. 
                     Omnes enim filii dei eſtis per fidem, que eſt in Chriſto Ieſu. Ȝe ar all the ſonnis of God be faith, quhilk is in Chriſt Ieſu. This is the faith that ouircummis the warld, according as ſanct Iohne ſais in his firſt epiſtil:i. Ioan. 5. 
                     Hec eſt victoria, que vincit mundum, fides veſtra. Faith is the vertew, quhair throch ȝe get victorie and ouercummis the warld. This is the faith that ouercummis the fleſche, as ſanct Paule ſais to the Epheſianis: In omnibus ſumentes ſcutū fidei,

Brethir be ſober and walk, for ȝour aduerſarie the deuil gangis about lyk a rampand Lyone ſeikand quhome he may ſwallie. Quhome reſiſt ſtedfaſtly in faith. This is the faith quhairwith the rychteous man leiffis, as it is writtin:Roma. 1. 
                     Iuſtus autem ex fide viuit. The rychteous man leiffis throch his faith. This faith is alwayis ionit with hoip and cheritie, and werkis throw lufe. This faith confortis vs in all our aduerſiteis, and cauſis vs to haif euirmair this worde

To ſignifie and declare that ilkane of vs ſuld haif in our awin hart ane ſpecial faith in God. For trewly it is nocht ſufficient to the for thi ſaluatioun, that ſanct Petir and ſanct Paule with the laif of the ſanctis of heuin, had ane ſpecial faith in God almychty, the Father, the Sonne, &amp; the haly ſpret, thre perſones and a God, ſa yat thow may ſaie with ſanct Paule: In fide viuo filii dei, qui dilexit me, et tradidit ſemetipſum pro me.

                     Almychty.
                     God only is almychty. Certane gret kingis and Emperouris, ar callit mychty Kingis and mychty Emperouris. The angels of heuin may be callit potent and mychty, bot na creature of heuin or erde nor vnder the erd may be callit omnipotent or almychty, that is ſay, that hais all powar and mycht, ſa God allanerly is omnipotent and almychty as the Prophet beris witnes in the Pſalme: Deus noſter in coelo,
                     Pſal. 113.

It may and ſuld be ſufficient, that as our Lord God be his infinite powar, hais creat and maid heuin and erd and all creatouris thairin, ſa be the ſame infinite powar he may fulfil and bring to paſſe all that he ſais, ſuppoſe it exceid the capacitie of mannis wit and reaſone.
                  
                     Makar of heuin and erd of nocht. As we ſaid to ȝow afore, the almychty powar of God was plainely ſchawin in the creatioun of heuin and erd, quhilk God maid of na thing. And heir we ſuld conſider the gret difference betuix the wyrking of man, and the wyrking of God. Ane craftis man can nocht wyrk his werk except yat he haue ſum mater to mak his wark of. Ane Tailȝ

Bot almychty God maid heuin and erd and all creatouris thairin, of na thing, quhilk he did be his almychty powar. Sa Moyſes beiris witnes ſayand: In principio creauit Deus coelum et terram.

                     qui fecit coelum et terrā. Our help is in the name of the Lord, quhilk maid heuin and erde. Now thairfor, O chriſtin man, thow ſal leir the trew ſignificatioun of this worde creatioun, it betakins nocht allanerly making of heuin and erde with all creatouris of nocht as we ſaid afore, bot alſo it betakins continual and perpetual cō

Quhen a warkman hais maid a houſe, he paſſis fra it, and takis na cuir of it. Syclike it is of all vthir warkmen concerning thair wark, bot God almychty hais ſa maid of na thing all his creatouris, that alſo continually he conſeruis and keipis thame in yair being, he gouerneis yame &amp; gydis yame, in ſamekil yat gif he wald take away fra his creatouris his cōtinual &amp; daily conſeruatioun, bot a moment of ane hour, all wald fall to na thing.

                      and confeſſ is with our mouth this firſt artikil, I beleiue in God father almychty, makar of heuin and erde, we ar direck it to the trew knawlege of the maieſtie of God. For this is a general rewle, ilkane makar is mair excellent, than is the work. God almychty is the makar of heuin &amp; erd &amp; al thingis contenit yairin, quharfore he is mair excellent than all the creatouris of the warld. This is declarit in the buke of wiſdome thus: Quorum et ſi ſpecie delectati deos putauerunt, ſciant quanto his dominator eorum ſpecioſior eſt, ſpiciei enim generator hec omnia conſtituit. Aut ſi virtutem et opera eorum mirati ſunt, intelligāt ab illis, quoniam qui hec fecit fortior eſt illis. A magnitudine enim ſpeciei, et creature, cognoſcibiliter poterit creator horū videri. Suppoſe the Gentilis, haiffand pleſour in certane creaturis fairnes, had opinioun yat thai wer goddis, ȝit thai ſuld haif kend, that the Lord and rewlar of yame is fairar than thai all, for he that is makar of all fairnes maid thame. Or gif thai merualit at the gret powar and werkis of the creatouris, thai ſuld haif

vnderſtād be yame, yat he quhilk maid yame is ſtarkar than thai all, for be the gretnes, fairnes and gudnes of ye creatouris, the makar of yame may be perſaiuit with plaine knawlege. Thus we may cum to ſum knawlege of gods maieſtie, powar, wiſdome, and gudnes, be faith of this firſt artikil.A leſſone to gife thankis to God. Secundly, this artikil leiris vs to gife perpetual thankis to God, for quhat ſaeuir we haif other fra heuin or erde, or ony creatour yairin, the ſame is geuin vs of God. According as ſanct Paule ſais: Quid habes quod non accepiſti?

name Ieſus, for he ſal ſaif his pepil fra yair ſynnis. Quhat is ſyn? Syn is ye trāſgreſſioun of Gods cō

Be ſyn we deſerue the paynis eternal of hel. Fynally, throch ſyn we ar at Gods horne &amp; baniſſit the kingdome of heuin. Fra thir gret dangaris &amp; miſereis of ſyn, nother can Angel of heuin nor man in erde deliuer and ſaif vs. Only Ieſus the natural ſonne of God may ſaif vs, be the meritis of his bliſſit incarnatioun, of his maiſt haly conuerſatioun and painful paſſioun.

Quhairfor (O chriſtin man) haue euirmair in thi mynd a quick remembrance of this haly name Ieſus, haue euir in thi hart feruent lufe to this haly name Ieſus, haue Ieſus prentit in thi hart, ſa deiply and ſa conſtantly, that na thocht or lufe of this warld put it away.

Alſo kingis was vnctit, as we haue mentioun maid of king Dauid, and of Salomon.Yis vvord Chriſt betakins the maiſt excellēt dignitie and office of our ſaluiour, quhairby he is our hede king and hede biſchop. Quhy was Biſchoppis &amp; preiſtis vnctit? To ſignifie yair haly office geuin to yame of God, quhilk thai can nocht worthily and perfitly execute, without the ſpecial grace of God. The office of a Preiſt &amp; Byſchop is nocht to leiue in idilnes, nocht to leiue in fornicatioun and huirdome, nocht to be occupeit in halking &amp; hunting, bot to leiue ane haly lyfe, chaiſt in body and ſaule, to pray to God for the pepil, to offer giftis &amp; ſacrifice to God for the pepil, to preche the word of God to the pepil, and lyk lanternis of lycht to gife exempil of haly lyfe to the pepil, quhow thai ſuld contemne all inordinat lufe of carnal pleſour, of warldly geir, &amp; tēporal dignitie, and to leiue a chriſtin lyfe to the pleſour of God.

Kingis lykwais was vnctit, to ſignifie thair excellent dignitie and office. Quhilk is to rewil ye pepil be executioun of trew iuſtice, to defende his pepil fra thair ennemyis, to cheriſch gud men, and to punis and dant euil men.

                     Non ad menſurā dat deus ſpiritum. God gaif nocht his ſpret to our ſaluiour Ieſus efter meſour, bot aboue all meſour. Thus our ſaluiour was vnctit ſpiritually, to be ane Preiſt and ane King. Quhow was he ane Biſchop or a Preiſt? For he techit vs the trew worde of God, he prayit &amp; prayis daily for vs to the father of heuin, he gaif vs exempil of all vertew and perfectioun, he offerit his awin precious bodie apon the altar of the Croſſe, as ane pleſand ſacrifice to the father of heuin, for our redemptioun and eternal ſaluatioun. Mairouir,Apoca. 19 he is king of all kingis and Lord of all Lordis, to quhome was geuin all powar bayth in heuin &amp; erde, he hais auctoritie to rewle his realme, that is to ſay, all chriſtin men and wemen, to defend thame fra thair ennemeis, to reward all gud men, and punis all euil men, quhilk he ſall do perfitly apon the lattar day, and dois daily with weir, peſt, and hungir, gif ȝe wald tak tent to it.

I trow ſurely, that for me and my ſaule heil, the ſonne of God Ieſus my ſaluiour, was conſaiuit of the haly gaiſt, borne of the virgin Marie, without ony carnal deid of mā, without mannis ſeid.

                     Verbum crucis pereuntibus quidem ſtulticia eſt, his autē qui ſalui fiunt, id eſt nobis, virtus dei eſt. The word of the Croſſe ſemis to be daftnes and folie to thame that periſchis, &amp; is condamnit, bot to yame yat ar ſaiffit, it is the vertew and powar of God. The Infidelis quhilk wantis our chriſtin faith thinkis it gret fulechnes

to ſay yat god may thoil paſſioun, nocht vnderſtanding that our ſaluiour Chriſt is bayth God and man, and that in the nature of his godheid he tholit na paſſioun, bot in the nature of his manheid he tholit his paſſioun. Mairouir the infidelis and vnfaithful thinkis it gret fulechnes to thoil painis and paſſioun, quhen a mā may eſchape yame, nocht vnderſtanding that our ſaluiour tholit nocht his paſſion aganis his wil, &amp; for his awin ſynnis, bot ȝit he tholit his maiſt paynful paſſioun of his awin fre wil, nocht for his awin ſyn, quhilk he neuir cōmittit in thocht, word or deid, bot allanerly for our ſynnis according as ſanct Peter declaris:i. Petri. 2. 
                     Qui peccata noſtra ipſe pertulit in corpore ſuo ſuper lignū, vt peccatis mortui iuſticie viuamus. He tholit for our ſynnis gret painis and paſſionis in his bodie apon the croſſe, yat we be the meritis of his paſſioun, applyit to vs be faith and the ſacramentis, mycht dee fra ſyn &amp; leif in bliſſitnes.

                     He hais tholit paſſioun. Trewly he tholit ſair and diſpleſand wordis ſpokin to him, yai callit him ane Samaritane, yai ſaid yat he was poſſeſſit with a deuil, thai ſaid he brak the ſabboth day, thai ſaid he was ane drounkart and a freind of Publicanis

and oppin ſynnaris, all thir iniurious wordis he tholit patiently for our ſaluatioun. Secundly, he tholit ſair ſtrakis, and laſt of all he tholit the ſairaft painis of dede. And to ſchaw him ſelf a trew man, he tholit for vs bayth in his body and in his ſaule, he was takin, he was bound, he was falſly accuſit, he was ſtrykin with neiffis, he was fylit with thair vyle ſpetting, he was dong with ſcurgis, he was crownit with thornis, &amp; laſt he was nalit on ye croſſe on the ſtinkand mont of Caluary, and to his mair confuſioun, ſet betuix twa theiffis, he taſtit Gall &amp; vynakir, &amp; finally dede for our redemptioun. And trow nocht yat he tholit na paine in his ſaule, for he ſaid him ſelf quhē he was in the ȝaird afore he was takin:Math. 26 
                     Triſtis eſt anima mea vſ

For as the nature of mā was paſſibil and mycht thoile, ſa the nature of God is impaſſibil and may nocht thoil.
                  
                     Vnder Pontius Pilatus. Pontius Pylatus, is the name of the Iuge, vnder quhome our ſaluiour tholit his paſſioun. And the name of this Iuge is expremit to geue certane knawlege of the ſtory and the tyme, for that ſame tyme Pontius Pilatus was Leuetenen of Iewry vnder Tyberius the Emperour of Rome, quhilk Pontius Pilatus kend weil that our ſaluiour was ane innocent and deliuerit to him be enuye of the Iewis. Nochtiheles for feir of

man and tyning of his office, he gaif ſentence aganis our ſaluiour and Iugit him to dede.
                  
                     Crucifyit. In this word crucifiit, is expremit the kind of dede, quhilk he tholit for vs, for as to be crucifyit and nakit on the croſſe was ane dede verrai langſum and excedand paynefull, ſa it was a dede ſchamefull amang the Iewis, for it is writtin in thair law:Deut. 21.

Remember the blud of his body, quhilk he ſched to weſche thi ſaule fra ſynne, according as it is writtin in the Apocalypſis: Dilexit nos et lauit nos a peccatis noſtris in ſāguine ſuo. He hes luffit vs and hes weſchit vs fra our ſynnis with his blude. Lat neuer the word of ſanct Paule gang out of thi mynd, quhilk he ſais: Cum inimici eſſemus, reconciliati ſumus deo per mortem filii eius.

                     ſalit to him be the dede of his ſonne. Think oft

tymes of the wordis quhilk haly kirk ſingis: Qui mortem noſtram moriendo deſtruxit. He hais deſtroyit our eternal dede, be his temporal dede. Beleiue ſtedfaſtly, that quhen he deit, he offerit a perfit ſacrifice apō the altar of the croſſe, to the father eternal, for our reconciliatioun, for our redemptioun and eternal ſaluatioun. Lat this faith be thi plycht ankir, and doutles thow ſall be ſaiffit fra all the dangeir of ſyn, of the deuil, and of hell, &amp; be the meritis of the ſame paſſioun and dede optene the lyfe eternal. And be ſickir (O chriſtin man) that thow beleiue this artikil with ane ſpecial faith, nocht only beleiuand yat the ſōne of God deit for ye ſaluatioun of S. Peter and S. Paule, bot trow ſickirly that he deit for thi ſaluatioun in ſpecial, ſayand with ſanct Paule: In fide viuo filii dei, qui dilexit me et tradidit ſemetipſum pro me.
                     Gala. 2. I leif now in the faith of the ſonne of God, quhilk hais luffit me and hes geuin him ſelf to the dede for me. In this ſpecial faith ſtandis thi ſaluatioun, yow haiffād cheritie, and wyrkand thairefter kepand the cō

                     And vvas erdit or bureit. Suppoſe our ſaluiour (as cōcerning the opinion of the warld) deit with gret ſchame &amp; confuſion, ȝit his bodie was bureit in ane honeſt ſepulchir with gret coſt and reuerence. For he tuk our paſſibill and mortall nature, for our redemptioun. Quhairfor, quhen

he had completit and fulfillit our redemptioun with his paſſioun and deit apon the Croſſe, it was conuenient that his bodie ſuld be put na mair to confuſioun and ſchame, bot rather to honour and reuerence, becauſe of his glorious reſurrectioun, quhilk was ſchortly to follow. And of his honourabill and reuerent burying, it was propheſit lang afore be the prophet Eſaie ſayand: Et erit ſepulchrum eius glorioſum.
                     Eſaie. xi. And his ſepulchir ſall be glorious. And ſa it was in deid, for Ioſeph of Aramathia &amp; Nichodemus buriet his precious bodie with coſtly vnctmētis and ſpices in ane honeſt &amp; new ſepulchir, as the euangeliſtis declaris at gret lenth.
                  The ſentence of this artikil is this.The ſentens of yis artikil. I trow ſurely that he in his manly nature tholit paſſioun vnder Poncius Pilatus than iuge in Ieruſalem, to mak ſatiſfactioun and mendis for al our ſynnis, yat hes a trew &amp; leiuand faith in him. And that he was crucifyit apon ane croſſe, and feſtinit Adamis obligatioun (quhilk was aganis vs) to the croſſe,Coloſ. 2. that it ſuld neuir mair noy vs, that we ſuld haue redemptioun and remiſſioun of al ſynnis be his blud, quhilk he ſched &amp; offerit as ane acceptabil offerand for euermair, to mak thame perfite, quhilk is hallowit, that is to ſay, ſanctifyit be leiuand faith in his blude, and reſauing of the ſacrament of Baptyme.
                  
                     And I trow ſurely that he ſched his precious blude, for the gret lufe quhilk he had to vs, to weſche vs fra our ſynnis, with the ſame lufe he deit apon the croſſe to reconſal vs and bring vs agane in the fauour of his father eternal, makand to him ane iuſt &amp; perfit ſatiſfactioun for al our offēcis quhilk hes a leiffand faith in him, &amp; is trewly penitent be contritioun, confeſſioun, and ſatiſfactioun. To mak peace betuix his father and vs, to ſlay ſyn and dede quhilk had ouerance apon vs. To deliuir vs fra all dangeir of ſyn, the deuil, dede and hel. And to bring vs to the glorious kingdome of heuin, thair to be with him euirmair in ioy and blyſſe. And I trow verraily yat his body was put in the erde, in quhilk he tholit dede, to put ſynne out of his fatheris ſycht,Pſal. 15. &amp; in his awin body to change yat maleſone ſaid to Adam, yat he ſuld turne in aſſe quhairof he was maid, bot ȝit his body, as the Pſalmiſt ſais,Gene. iii. ſaw neuir corruptioun.

For quha ſa will leife ane perfite lyfe, lat him contemne thai thingis, quhilk our ſaluiour hingand on the croſſe contemnit, and lat him deſyre thai thingis, quhilk our ſaluiour hynging on the croſſe deſyrit, for trewly thair is na vertew, bot of it we may tak exempil fra our ſaluiour hyngand on the croſſe.
                  
                     Wald thow haue exempil of perfite lufe and cheritie?Exempil of perfite lufe and. cheritie. Ioan. xv. Heir quhat is ſaid in ſanct Iohnis euā

And that our ſaluiour did for vs apon the croſſe. And ſen ſwa it is, that he hais geuin his lyfe for vs, we ſuld nocht be diſcontent, nor think it heuy to thoile ony kind of aduerſitie for his faith and obediens, ſayand with the prophet in the Pſalme: Quid retribuam domino pro omnibus, quae retribuit mihi? Calicem ſalutaris accipiā,
                     Pſal. 115. 
                     et nomen domini inuocabo. Quhat ſal I geue to the Lord, for all that he hes geuin to me? I wil tak to me the cup of my ſaluiour, that is to ſay, thoil aduerſitie patiently, for the lufe of my ſaluiour Chriſt, and ſwa call apon his name with faithfull prayar.Exempil of perfite pacience. Seikis thow exempil of perfite pacience, thow hais it geuin maiſt excellently to the in the croſſe of our ſaluiour Chriſt. Pacience is ſchawin to be gret be twa pointtis, other quhen a man tholis gret paynis paciently or quhen he tholis paynis &amp; may eſchaip thame and will nocht in deid eſchaip thame, bot tholis thame willyngly. Sa our ſaluiour on the croſſe tholit for vs gret paynts, in ſa mekil as ſanct Petir ſais: Cum pateretur, non comminabatur.
                     i. Petri. 2. Quhen he tholit his paſſion, he maid na boſting or ſchoring to thame that put him to the dede. Bot as the Prophet ſais: Sicut ouis ad occiſionē ducetur, et ſicut agnus corā tondēte ſe, ob muteſcet.
                     Eſaie. iiii.
                     
He ſall be led to his dede lyke a ſcheip, and lyke a lambe ſall he hald him ſtill before the man that clippis him. This propheſie our ſaluiour fulfyllit in the tyme of his paſſioun, quhen he lyke ane innocent lambe tholit his paſſioun paciently, without ony murmour, gaynſtanding, or contradictioun. Mairouir, he mycht haue eſchapit the ſame paynis, gif it had pleſit him to haue maid reſiſtence, according as he ſaid to ſanct Petir in the tyme of his taking:Math. 26 
                     An putas quia non poſſum rogare patrē meū, et exhibebit mihi modo pluſq̄ duodecim legiones angelorū? Thinkis yow that I can nocht pray my father, and he ſal ſend me mair than xii. thouſand legionis of angellis? Be this ȝe may ſe, how gret was the pacience of our ſaluiour in tyme of his paſſioun. Quhairfor lat vs do the counſel of ſanct Paule, ſayand thus to the Hebrewis:Hebre. xii 
                     Per parientiam curramus ad propoſitum nobis certamen, aſpicientes in authorem fidei et conſummatorem I

Alſo ye ſame deliuerāce was propheſit be the prophet Oſee: Ero mors tua, o mors,

                     ero morſus tuus o inferne. O dede (ſais our ſaluiour) I ſall be thi dede. This propheſie was fulfillit quhē our ſaluiour with his corporal &amp; tēporal dede, diſtroit our eternal dede, deliuering al yame yat beleiuis in him with a leiffand faith, fra ye bōdage of eternal painis of hel, quhilk is callit the eternal dede. It followis: O hel I ſal byte the. The man yat bytis ony thing, he takis part to him, &amp; lattis part remane behind. Sa our ſaluiour paſſand doune to hell, he fulfyllit this propheſie, takand part of ſaulis out fra hell with him, and leiffand part behim him.

Quhom tuk he with him? bot thame that was haly and gud, quhilk was haldin thair as preſonaris. Quhom left he behind him? bot thame quhilk was in ye hel of dānatioun reprobat &amp; condemnit to paynis eternal, &amp; all thame quhilk deit in original ſyn.
                  The ſentence of this artikil is this, I trow verraily he paſſit downe to hel with gret powar, to ſubieck him quhilk had empyre of dede, yat is ye deuil, to deliuer yame, quhilk be dredour al yair lyfe was vnder bondage, that the deuil and his wylis ſuld nocht noye thame quhilk had faith in Chriſt Ieſu, quhom he hais deliuerit fra the deuil and hel.

                  We find in the ſcripture that ſindry perſonis was raiſit fra the dede, as Lazarus, the wedowis ſonne, &amp; the dochter of the archeſynagoge, with certane vtheris.

Secundly, Lazarus with the laif raiſe fra the dede to ane lyfe mortal, &amp; efter yat thai raiſe, thai deit agane. Bot our ſaluiour raiſe fra ye dede to ane lyfe immortal, and neuir deit agane, becauſe his bodie was glorifyit and maid incorruptibil, according as ſanct Paule declaris to the Romanis,Roma. vi. ſayand thus: Chriſtus reſurgens ex mortuis iam non moritur, mors illi vltra non dominabitur. Chriſt ryſand fra the dede deis na mair, dede ſall haue na mair powar ouir him. Sa mychty &amp; glorious was the reſurrectioun of our ſaluiour Chriſt. And gif ȝe ſpeir,Quhy he raiſe the thrid day? quhy raiſe he ye thrid day erar than the ſecund, fourt or fift day? Trewly, to ſchaw that he was trewly dede, quhilk was neceſſarie for our beleif, quhilk we aucht to haue to the artikil of his paſſioun and dede. For gif he had ryſin the ſecund day, perauentour ſum men wald haue ſaid, that he had nocht trewly deit. Mairouir, gif he had differrit his reſurrectioun langar, than his diſcipillis had nocht bein ſa ſoine certifyit in the faith as miſter was. Quhairfor, verrai conueniently he raiſe fra dede to lyfe the thrid day, according to his promiſe quhilk he maid to his Apoſtils &amp; diſcipillis, ſayand:

                  The ſentence of this artikil is this. I trow fermely that he is ryſin fra dede to lyfe apon ye thrid day, for our rychteouſnes, that we ſuld ryſe be his ſpreit and faith, to ane new godly lyfe, be the gyding of his haly ſpreit according to his godly will, and ſuld nocht leif ony mair in ſyn, to be ſubieckit agane to dede, bot leif euirmair in a new, godly and haly lyfe, as he ſal neuir dee agane, bot leif for euirmair.

                     AScendit ad coelos, ſedet ad dexterā dei patria omnipotentis. I beleiue that our ſaluiour aſcendit to the heuin, and ſittis at the rycht hand of the father God almychty. In yis artikil chriſtin pepil ȝe may conſidder twa thingis. The firſt, how heych was the aſcentioun of Chriſt. The ſecund, how profitabil to vs all was his Aſcentioun. Of the firſt ſpeikis ſanct Paule ſayand thus: Aſcendit ſuper omnes coelos. He aſcendit aboue al the heuins.Ephe. 4 Trewly aboue all ye heuins, nocht only corporal, quhilk we ſe aboue vs, as the ſeuin Planettis, the firmament ſet full of ſternis, with the laif, bot alſo be aſcendit aboue all heuins ſpiritual. That is to ſay, aboue all the ordouris of Angellis, euin

to the rycht hand of God the father almychty, according as ſanct Paule declaris ſayand:Ephe. i. 
                     Conſtituens Ieſum ad dexteram ſuam in coeleſtibus, ſuper omnem principatum et poteſtatem et virtutem et dominationem, &amp; omne nomen quod nominatur nō ſolum in hoc ſeculo, ſed etiam in futuro, et omnia ſubiecit ſub pedibus eius. God ye father almychty hes ſet Ieſus our ſaluiour at his rycht hand in heuinly thingis, aboue all the principattis, poteſtatis, vertewis &amp; dominationis, yat is to ſay, he hes exaltit our ſaluiour in his manheid in the heuinly empyre aboue all the nyne ordouris of Angellis, &amp; alſo aboue all vther creatouris that may be namit, nocht only in this warld, bot alſo in the walrd to cum.

                      Trinitie, ſa we beleue that he ſittis at the rycht hand of God the father eternal. That

is to ſay, he is equal with the father in honour, dignitie, glore &amp; maieſtie.The ſentēce of yis artikil. Swa the ſentence of this artikil is this. I trow ſurely that Ieſꝰ Chriſt in his manheid paſſit vp to heuin the xl. day efter his reſurrectioun, and ſittis at the fatheris rycht hand, in the ſame glore, with the father of heuin, hauing full powar, ouerance, empyre, glore and gyding of Angellis and all creatouris in heuin, erd, and hell. Thairfor I wait that he may help me, and will defend me and al thame, quha trowis in him, that na creatour in heuin, erde or hel may noy vs, by his godly wil.
                  The ſecund point of this artikil is to cōſidder how profitabil this glorious aſcenſioun was to vs, quhairin ȝe may leir mony ſpiritual leſſonis.Moral leſſonis of vertevv. And trewly in his aſcētioun he was our ledar &amp; gyde. Thairfor to leid vs the way to heuin, he aſcendit to heuin afore vs, according as it was propheſit lāg afore be ye prophet Micheas:Math. 2.

I gang to prepare a place for ȝow.Ioan. 14.
                  
                  Secundly, be his glorious aſcētioun, he hes geuin vs (in ane maner) ane ſecuritie of our ſaluatioun. For he aſcendit to the heuin, that he in his manly nature mycht pray for vs to his and our father eternal, according as S. Paule ſais: Accedens per ſemetipſum ad deum ſemper viuens,

And quhat ſuld be our treſour ſamekil as our ſaluiour Chriſt, in quhom is all the treſouris of wiſdome, &amp; knawlege. Sa our hart ſuld alwayis be in him and with him in heuin, according as ſanct Paule exhortis vs, ſayand:Coloſ. iii. 
                     Si conſurrexiſtis cum Chriſto que ſurſum ſunt querite, vbi Chriſtus eſt in dextera dei ſedens, que ſurſū ſunt ſapite non quae ſuper terrā. Gyf ȝe be ryſſin with Chriſt ſeik thai thingis quhilk ar aboue, quhair Chriſtis ſittand at ye rycht hand of God, ſet ȝour mynd in thai thingis quhilk ar aboue, and nocht apon thai thingis, quhilk ar apon the erde, yat finally ȝe may cum to the glorious kingdome of heuin, to ye quhilk he bring vs that bocht vs with his precious blud.

                     SAnctam eccleſiam catholicam. I beleiue yat thair is ane catholik kirk, quhairin is cōmunioun of ſanctis, and remiſſioun of ſynnis. For the declaratioun of this artikil, ȝe ſall vnderſtand, that as ſanct Paule ſais: Vna eſt fides,
                     Ephe. 4. thair is bot ane faith. And alſo the ſame: Apoſtil ſais: Multi vnum corpus ſumus in Chriſto. We quhilk ar into nowmer mony, is bot ane body in Chriſt,Roma. 12. &amp;

Chriſt is our heid as he ſais to the Epheſianis:Ephe. i. 
                     Ipſū dedit caput ſuꝑ omnē eccleſiā. God the father eternal hais ordanit Chriſt to be heid ouir all the kirk, quhilk is his body. Thus we haue that ye catholyk kirk is callit the ſpiritual ſpouſe of Chriſt, quhairof ſanct Paule ſais to the Epheſianis: Chriſtus dilexit eccleſiam,
                     Ephe. 5. 
                     &amp; ſemetipſum tradidit pro ea, vt illā ſanctificaret, mundans eam lauacro aque in verbo vite, vt exhiberet ipſe ſibi glorioſam eccleſiam non habentem maculam aut rugam, aut aliquid huiuſmodi, ſed vt ſit ſancta et immaculata. Chriſt hais luffit his kirk ſwa, yt he hes geuin him ſelf for it for to hallow it, be the lawar of Baptyme &amp; the word of God, that it ſuld be haly without ſmot or fylth. And this is the new citie of Ieruſalem, quhilk ſāct Iohne ſaw cum downe fra the heuin, adornit and buſkit as ane bryde with hir ſpouſe, of the quhilk ane voce ſaid:Apoca. 21

                  The ſentence of this artikil is this. I trow fermely that thair is bot ane haly kirk,Quhat is the haly catholyk kirk, and quha ar memberis of it. yat is to ſay, ane haly congregatioun of chriſtin men and wemen ouir all the warld, quhilk hais rycht faith, quhilk hais reſſauit ane haly ſpreit, and is gadderit be the ſame, gydit and kepit be him, and daily increſſis be the word of God and the ſeuin Sacramentis.

And this artikil I confeſſe alſo: Sanctorum communionem. The communioun of Sanctis. And the ſentence of thir wordis is this. I trow fermely,Of the vnitie of the haly kirk. thair is ane company and communitie, quhilk is allanerly of hallowit men and wemen, vnder ane heid Chriſt, gadderit togeddir be the haly gaiſt, throch ane trew faith in Chriſt. And ſuppoſe the heid hais partit ſyndry giftis amang his memberis, quhilk is the congregatioun of faithful men and wemen. Nochttheles, yair is bot ane faith, ane hoip and cheritie amang all, thair is na ſyndry ſectis, or opinioun, or diuiſioun in the ſame communitie.Quhat is the communioun of ſanctis. I grant thairfor that I am ane member of this communitie and part takar of all thair gud. Firſt of all the bliſſit meritis of Chriſt (and of al ye meritis of ſanctis) be faith of the ſacramentis, ſyne of all the gud deidis done in the kirk. Sa I grant me to be part takar of all yair prayaris &amp; vthir gud werkis, &amp; yat euery ilkane ſuld bere vtheris byrding.
                  I profeſſe alſo yat quhaſaeuir bydis nocht in ye vnitie of yis catholik kirk,Quha ar priuat the comunion of ſanctis. he hes nocht of ye cōmunioun of ſāctis, that is, he is nocht part takar of the cōmon gud before reherſit, quhilk is the meritis of Chriſt &amp; his ſanctis and gud deidis of the chriſtin pepil, becauſe he departis wilfully fra the miſtyk body of Chriſt, &amp; is be cūmin ane rottin dede mēber

                     Remiſſionem peccatorum. I beleiue fermely, that allanerly in the haly Catholyk and Apoſtolik kirk gadderit be the haly ſpreit, is remiſſioun of ſynnis, be Baptyme, and eftir be Penance, and the keys geuin to ye kirk. And certainly Baptyme may be geuin be yame quhilk ar out with the kirk as ar all heretikis, ſciſmatykis &amp;c. For gif thai pronunce the wordis of Baptyme trewly in forme of the Catholyk kirk, the perſone ſwa Baptiſit reſſauis the full effeck of the ſacrament, quhilk is remiſſioun of all his ſynnis, and is incorporat to the miſtyk body of Chriſt. For generally ye vertew of all ſacramētis ſtādis nocht in the gudnes of the miniſter, bot in the word of God pronunſit be the miniſter weil, in the forme of the Catholyk kirk, ſa the euil miniſteris ſtoppis nocht the effeck of the ſacramentis. Thus I beleiue fermely that in ye ſacrament of Baptyme al ſynnis ar forgeuin, bayth original and actual before committit,Remiſſion of original ſyn is gottī be faith and the ſacramēt of baptyme. and ſall neuir be imputit agane.
                  I beleiue that in Baptyme a chriſtin man ȝoung or auld is renewit be the haly ſpreit, deliuerit fra ye thirldome of ſyn, the deuil, and hell and maid a fre man wt the fredome of the ſpreit, that he may ſtoutly fecht agane the deuil, the warld, and the fleſche,

and be the help of God ouircum thame, and ſa with victorie be crownit of God, with glore and ioy, and with Chriſt euirmair ring in heuin. Bot &amp; we eftir Baptyme fal in ſynnis, ſuppoſe yai be neuir ſa greuous and mony, we haue the ſecund remeid quhilk is the ſacrament of Penance, be quhilk remiſſioun of ſynnis is geuin be the vertew of Chriſtis blude, and miniſtratioun of the keys geuin to the kirk in the perſone of S.

                     Accipite ſpiritum ſanctum, quorū remiſeritis peccata, remittuntur eis, et quorum retinueritis, retenta ſunt. Reſaif the haly ſpreit, quhais ſynnis ſaeuir ȝe forgeue, thai ar forgeuin to yame, and quhais ſynnis ſaeuir ȝe hald on forgeuin, thai ar on forgeuin. Thus I beleif that in the ſacramēt of Penance remiſſioun of ſynnis is geuin to al yame yt trewly be penitent, &amp; yat be faith in Chriſtis blude, &amp; miniſtratioun of the key of abſolutioun pronunſit be ane trew miniſter of ye ſame catholyk kirk. Secundly, I beleif ye trew repentāce is the ſpecial gift of ye haly ſpreit, quhilk be his grace lythis &amp; turnis our hart to God as S. Paule declaris to Timothe:2 Timo. 2 
                     Ne forte det illis deus penitē
                        tiā ad cognoſcendū veritatē &amp; reſipiſcant a laqueis diaboli, a quo captiui tenentur ad ipſius voluntatē.
                     
Leſt parauentour God geue yame Penance to ken the veritie, &amp; to amend thair lyfis, to be free fra the gyrnis or bandis of the deuil, to quhom thai ar haldin preſonaris euin as the deuil will.
                  Now ſeand that remiſſioun of ſynnis is nocht gottin without trew penance, quhilk contenis Cōtritioun of the hart, Confeſſioun of ye mouth to the preiſt, and ſatiſfactioun in dede. And yis trew penance is the gift of God, we ſuld daily pray to God to geue vs grace to repent trewly.
                  
                     Quha gettis remiſſioun of ſynnis fra God.Thridly, I beleue that nane can get fra God remiſſioun of thair ſynnis, except thai forgeue to thair nychtbour all offencis doine to thame▪ Heir war ane conuenient place to declare

Than verraily he offerand him ſelf apon the altar of the croſſe, as ane ſacrifice of ſweit ſauoir, maiſt acceptabil to god his eternal father for our reconciliatioun, he conqueſt, he wanne, and iuſtly deſeruit aboundance of grace,Ioan. i. quhairof all faithful men and wemen mycht be participāt to obtane yair iuſtificatioun &amp; eternal ſaluatioun according as ſanct Iohne the euāgeliſt ſais: De plenitudine eius nos omnis acceptinus. Of his fulnes all we haue reſſauit, That is to lay, of that aboundance of grace, quhilk was geuin to our ſaluiour without meaſour &amp; of his meritorious paſſioun, all we that beleiffis in him with a leuand faith, reſſauis ane certane meaſure of grace, according to his pleaſure. Thairfor yat the vertew and meritis of Chriſtis paſſioun, or the grace quhilk he deſeruit for vs be his paſſioun, may be applyit, drawin and brocht to vs be ſum wayis to vs maiſt conuenient,The hail number of the ſacramentis. thair is inſtitute &amp; ordanit be the auctoritie of God ſeuin halye Sacramentis, quhilk ar Baptyme, Confirmatioun, the Euchariſt or the ſacrament of the Altar, Penance, Extreme vnctioun, Ordour, and Matrimonie. Thir (I ſay) was ordanit be almychty God to be to vs inſtrumentis of our ſaluatioun, &amp; as ſpiritual cundittis &amp; wellis of grace, in the quhilk, and be the quhilk, we may reſſaue the wattir of Goddis grace deſeruit to vs be the vertew &amp; meritis of Chriſtis paſſion, quhilk ſaiffis nane, bot thame allanerly to quhom it is applyit

be trew faith, dew miniſtratioun &amp; worthi reſſauing of the ſacramētis. Quhairfor O chriſtin pepil I exhort ȝow to draw this precious wattir of grace fra the wellis of our ſaluiour. For and ȝe with diligence will leir the vertew of the ſeuin ſacramentis, and ſeik for the grace of God offerit and promiſſit to ȝow in the ſame ſacramentis, perſeuere in the ſame grace of God, ȝe ſall haue heir in this lyfe gret ſpiritual ioy and blythnes in God, and in the lyfe to cum ȝe ſall be ſickir of the eternal ioy and blyſſe.
                  As wattir be natural propertie weſchis and makis clein the thing that is foule, and ſlokins the thing yat is het, ſa the grace of God reſſauit in the ſacrament of Baptyme weſchis the ſaule of him that dewly reſſauis it, fra the ſpottis of original ſyn, and alſo actual afore committit, &amp; with yat it ſlokins and diminiſſis the vehement het of carnal luſt and concupiſcēce quhilk bydis in our fragil nature eftir Baptyme, ſa in vthir ſacramētis, ye ſenſibil ſigne proponit outwartly to our ſenſis, betakins ſum certane operatioun of ye grace of god wrocht in our ſaulis inwartly. Quhy is it ſaid in the foreſaid diffinitioun, yat ane ſacrament is the cauſe of grace? ſeing yat na creature hes powar to geue grace, bot God allanerly? according as ye prophet ſais in ye Pſalme:Pſal. 83. 
                     Gratiam et gloriā dabit dominus. It is the Lord our God that ſall geue grace &amp; glore. We grant that God allanerly is the geuar of grace, nochttheles, he hais geuin vertew and powar to the

Sacramentis to be inſtrumentis of his grace, quhilk thai cauſe in our ſaulis, nocht be thair awin natural powar and vertew, bot allanerly be the mycht of God aſſiſtant and being preſent in &amp; with his ſacrament in his haly word. And as the corporal fyre of hell be powar of God geuin to it, is ane inſtrument of goddis iuſtice, in perpetual tormenting of the ſpreitis and ſaulis in hell, ſa in this preſent kirk militant, the ſacramētis ar inſtrumentis of goddis mercy and grace in our iuſtificatioun,Titum. iii. ſa ſanct Paule callis the ſacrament of Baptyme ye lawar of our ſpiritual regeneratioun &amp; renouatioun in our ſaulis. Thus ȝe may eaſely vnderſtand quhow ane ſacrament is ane ſenſibil ſigne, takin and marke of grace, quhilk it contenis and ſignifeis, and alſo as ane inſtrumēt is ye cauſe of ye ſame grace to be geuin to our ſaulis, quhen it is dewly miniſterit and worthely reſſauit.

                  The ſecund cauſe of the inſtitutioun of the ſacramentis was, nocht allanerly to ſignifie and betakin grace and halynes to be geuin to vs, bot alſo thai war ordanit to ſanctifie &amp; to geue to our ſaulis ye ſpecial grace of god (as we declarit to ȝow afore) as the inſtrumentis of our ſanctificatioun. As for exempil, quhen ane cunning and expert Cirurginar heilis the woundis of ane hurt man, he him ſelf vnder God is the principal heilar of the woundis be the meanis of the playſteris laid to the woundis, nocht theles the towellis, bandis

Firſt for our humiliatioun, that man meikly at Gods command ſubmit himſelf to be curit fra ſynne be the rycht vſe &amp; miniſtratioun of certane ſēſibil thingis, quhilk turnit him ſelf fra God proudly be inordinat lufe and abuſing of ſenſibil thingis. It is rycht and reaſone that quhair ſyn ryſis and begynnis, yair alſo it may dee and haue ane end.
                  Thai war ordanit alſo for our eruditioun &amp; trew inſtructioun,Contra Fauſtum. lib. 19. cap. 16. for thai geue vs to vnderſtād that the will of God is to geue vs preſently his mercy and grace, ſa that quhen we ſee ony thing done to vs in the ſacramentis outwartly in our bodie, we ſuld beleue that ſum ſpecial effect of grace is wrocht inwartly in our ſaulis. As quhē the wattir of Baptyme weſchis ye body outwartly, we ſuld beleif that the grace of God purgis and weſchis the ſaule inwartly fra original ſyn, and ſa lykwiſe of all the laif of the ſacramentis.

Thridly thai war alſo inſtitute for the ſpiritual exercitioun of all faithfull men &amp; wemen in the ſeuin principal vertewis. In the ſacrament of Baptyme we profeſſe and pronuncis our faith, &amp; ofttymis heris vthir, quhilk ar baptizit, rehers, pronunce and profeſſe thair faith, and thairfor was callit in auld tymes the ſacrament of faith. In extreme vnctioun we grow in hoip of ye mercy and glore of God, be the meritis of Chriſtis paſſioun, and prayaris of the kirk. In the ſacrament of the Altar we reſſaue gret increſe and exercitioun of trew lufe &amp; cheritie towart God, becauſe yt our ſaluiour Chriſt in the ſame bliſſit ſacrament hes geuin really &amp; preſently his awin precious body and blud, in quick remembrance of his paſſioun, and alſo to be the ſpiritual fude of our ſaulis.Lib. 8. de

                        rinitate. And thairfor the doctor Hylarius callis it the ſacrament of lufe. In ye ſacrament of Confirmatioun we reſſaue the vertew of Fortitude and ſpiritual ſtrynth of our mynd, to ſtād ſtowtly in the cōfeſſioun of our faith, agane all ennemeis of the ſame faith. In the ſacrament of Penāce we haue exercitioun of iuſtice &amp; rychteouſnes. For na mā can do worthi penance, bot gif yat he iuſtly ſatiſfie his nychtbour and mak ane mendis to him wt al his powar for wrangis done to him. In the ſacrament of Ordour, ſpecially of preiſtis yt kēnis yair vocatioun &amp; dois yair office, yai haue exercitioun of prudence be ſtudy, cōtemplatioun, preching ye word of God, praying for the pepil, &amp; in dew miniſtratioun of

the Sacramentis to thair pariſchonaris, of quhom thai haue euir and charge geuin to yame &amp; alſo yair corporal leuing. In the ſacrament of Matrimony, thai yat ar maryit perſonis hais exercitioun of temperance, becauſe that bodily pleſour is contenit within the bandis and boundis of lawful mariage. Thus it is manifeſt and plane, yat be dew miniſtratioun of the ſeuin ſacramētis, we haue exercitioun in the ſeuin vertewis afore reherſit.
                  Quhairof is ane ſacrament conſtitute &amp; maid? Trewly of twa principal partis. The ane is ane ſē
                     ſibil thing, quhilk be ſum ꝓpertie betakins ye grace of God, as wattir, oyle, breid, wyne, impoſitioun of handis &amp; ſiclyk, the vthir parte is the word of God expremit be inuocatioun of the Trinitie and grundit in the promis of mercy, quhilk is maid be our ſaluiour Chriſt to all thame quhilk in trew faith of the ſame promis reſſauis dewly the ſacrament or at the leiſt makis na abſtacle agane the grace of God quhen thai reſſaue the ſacrament. And ſuppoſe thir twa thingis ar the principal partis of ilk ſacrament, quharin ſtādis the hail nature and ſubſtance of the ſame, ȝit is yair eikit be ye authoritie of haly kirk certane ceremoneis, quhilk hais bein vſit in the miniſtratioun of ilk ane ſacrament ſen the Apoſtillis tyme hytherto. And gif ȝe wald knaw quhairfor thai war eikit. Trewly nocht to be principal or ſubſtancial partis of the ſacrament. For in tyme of extreme neid a ſacrament may be miniſtrit but ony ſiclyke ceremonyis. Bot veraily yai war ordanit yat ilk a ſacrament mycht be vſit with honeſt

grauitie, with reuerence, with honorabil ordo

                      and with executioun of our faith and to geue inſtructioun to vs quhat is done in the ſacramēt. And as for the miniſter of the ſacramentis, ſuppoſe he be ane euil man, heretyk, ſciſmatyk, excomunicat, or in dedlie ſyn, ȝit he intend and as the kirk intendis and in the miniſtratioun of ye ſacrament vſis the forme of ye kirk, &amp; he doand as the kirk dois, &amp; vſand the forme thairof, his euil ſtoppis nocht the effect of the ſacrament, quhilk as we ſaid afore, ſanctifyis our ſaulis, nocht be the meritis of the miniſter, bot allanerly be the meritis of our ſaluiour, quhilk hes ordanit thame.
               
            
            
               
               OF THE SACRAMENT of Baptyme.
               
                  The thrid Cheptour.
                  
                     
                        THE Sacrament of Baptyme hes twa partis, quhairof it is conſtitute and maid, The ane part is the element of wattir, the vthir part is the worde of God. Quhy was wattir ordanit to be one of the partis of Baptyme? Firſt becauſe of the ſignificatioun, for as wattir weſchis and clengis the bodye outwartly, ſa we ſuld beleue that be the ſacrament of Baptyme, we ar weſchin in our ſaulis fra original &amp; all vthir actual ſynnis afore cō
                     mittit. Secundly wattir is ane element commoun to all men and wemen &amp; eaſy to be gottin in all partis quhair men hais thair dwelling placis. Thridly our ſaluiour Chriſt was Baptiȝit be the miniſtratioun of ſanct Iohne ye Baptiſt in the wattir of Iordane, of quhom ſanct Auguſtine ſais thus: Chriſtus tactu ſue mundiſſime carnis, vim regeneratiuā contulit aquis. Quhē our ſaluiour Chriſt was Baptizit, and with his haly and clein bodye twichit the wattir, than he gaue vertew &amp; powar to the wattir to regenerat &amp; bring vs furth agane with ane new birth. The gret flud cōmonly callit ye flud of Noe, becauſe it was in Noes tyme, was ane figure of ye wattir of Baptyme. For as almychty God, be

yat ſame flude deſtroyit all warldly creaturis leuād on erd, few except, quhilk be ſaiffit in the ark be ye wattir. Sa in the wattir of Baptyme, the warld is deſtroyit, that is to ſay, al vyce and ſynne periſſis. And thai that be baptizt in the ark, that is to ſay, in the faith of haly kirk ar ſaffit be the wattir of Baptyme,i. Petri. iii. as ſanct Peter techis in his epiſtil. Attour the wattir of Baptyme is weil figurat be the red ſe. For as king Pharao with all his hoiſt perſewand the barnis of Iſrael was drownit in the red ſee, ſa in the wattir of Baptyme the deuil and all his hoiſt of ſynne, is vincuſit, ouircumit and put away, and the trew faithful pepil of Chriſt ar ſaffit. Thus ȝe may vnderſtand plainely yat for ſyndry conuenient reſonis and figuris wattir was weil ordanit to be ane of the twa partis of Baptyme.
                  The ſecund part of Baptyme maiſt principal &amp; mychty in operatioun is the word of God, be inuocatioun of ye bliſſit trinitie, grundit apō this promis quhilk our ſaluiour makis on this maner:Marce. 16 
                     Qui crediderit et baptizatus fuerit, ſaluus erit. Quhaſaeuir beleiffis and is baptiȝit ſall be ſaiffit. The word of Baptyme is expremit be the miniſter of the ſame,Of the promis of baptyme. Math. 28 eftir the forme and maner geuin be our ſaluiour quhen the miniſter ſais: Ego baptiȝo te in nomine patris, et filii, et ſpiritus ſancti. Amen. I baptiȝe the in the name of the father, and the ſonne, and the haly ſpreit. Amen. This word ſuld be cōſidderit maiſt principally, for yis word is it yat clengis our ſaulis with the wattir. Tak away this word fra the wattir, quhat is the wattir bot allanerly wattir, as

we mycht ſay plainly, &amp; this word be nocht trewly &amp; faithfully expremit, the wattir may nocht be callit a part of baptyme, bot &amp; yis word be ionit to ye wattir, than is yair a perfit ſacrament. How hes the wattir yis vertew &amp; powar, yat quhen it twichis ye body,Aug. contra Fauſtū lib. 19. cap. 16. it weſchis the ſaule, bot be the reſone of ye word, nocht only becauſe yat word is ſpokin &amp; pronunſit be the mouth of the miniſter, bot alſo becauſe it is beleiffit and ferme faith is geuin to it, ſa the ſaule of yat perſone quhilk is baptiȝit is clengit fra all ſynnis and borne agane in God wt ane new byrth, nocht be vertew of the wattir only, bot be vertew of ye word trewly expremit &amp; faithfully beleuit. For quhen the miniſter of Baptyme ſais: Ego baptiȝo te in nomine patris, et filii, et ſpūs ſancti, Amē. I baptiȝe ye in the name of ye father, &amp; the ſōne, &amp; the haly ſpreit, Amen The ſētence of thir wordis is yis:The ſentēce of the vvordis of Baptyme. With yis ſenſibil ſigne &amp; takin quhilk I do now, dippand yt in wattir or powr and wattir on the, pronunceand yir wordis: I baptiȝe the in the name of the father, &amp; the ſonne, and the haly ſpreit. I declare to the plainly yt all thi ſynnis ar forgeuin to the,Auguſti. in Ioānnem. tracta. 80 Of the cō
                        nand maid in baptym betvvein God and man. &amp; yat yow ar reſſauit into the fauour of God, the father, the ſōne, and the haly ſpreit, quhilk ar thre perſonis and ane god, eternal and mercyful. For quhat vthir thing is Baptyme, bot ane faithful cunnand and ſickir band of amitie maid be God to man, &amp; be man to God? For in als mekil yat ye perſone quhilk is baptizit, other be him ſelf or be his godfather &amp; godmother, oppinly renū
                     cis &amp; forſakis ye deuil &amp; al his werkis, &amp; obliſſis him

ſelf in ſeruice to the trew leuand God that all the dayis of his lyfe, he ſal mortifie the mēberis of ſyn, and ſerue his god in trew faith of haly kirk, ye wyrkis be lufe. In Baptyme is ane cunnand or band quhilk man makis to God, and on the vthir part, for als mekil that God almychty agane to the perſone ſa Baptiȝit obliſſis him ſelf to forgeue to him al his ſynnis, and yat for the lufe and meritis of his natural ſōne Ieſus Chriſt, he will geue to him his haly ſpreit, to quickin, to ſanctifie and to renew his fre will and mak him ane new creature in God, it may be callit ane cūnand or band, quhilk God makis to man, quhilk the Apoſtil ſanct Petir declaris with gret grauitie ſayand thus:i. Petri. iii. 
                     Sic vos baptiſma ſaluos facit, non carnis depoſitio ſordium, ſed conſcientie bone interrogatio in deū, per reſurrectionē Ieſu Chriſti ex mortuis. Baptyme is nocht allanerly the outwat weſching of the body fra filth, bot it is ane conditioun or band of ane gud cōſcience towart God, be the reſurrectioun of Chriſt. That is to ſay, God almychty in the ſacrament of Baptyme teſtifeis he is content &amp; pleaſit with vs for Chriſtis ſaik quhilk raiſe fra dede to lyfe, that on the vthir part gud conſcience may keip conditioun wt God, traiſtand that God is pleaſit with him for Chriſtis ſaik.Circumciſioun vvas ane figure of Baptyme. Gene. 17. Ane figure of Baptyme in the auld law was circū
                     ciſioun partly agreand wt Baptyme in effect &amp; ſignificatioun. For circumciſioun was a ſigne of a certane band or conditioun maid betwein God and Abraham and all Abrahamis poſteritie. Thus the ſcripture ſais: I will (ſais God to Abraham) mak

ane cunnand or conditioun betwein me and the and alſo thi ſeid eftir the in thair generatioun with ane perpetual band, yat I may be thi God, and alſo the god of thi ſeid that ſal cum eftir the. Thow thairfor ſal keip my cunnand, and thi ſeid alſo in yair generatiouns. Than god declaris the ſame cūnand ſaying: This is my cunnand quhilk ȝe ſall obſerue and keip betwein me &amp; ȝow. Ilk ane māchild borne amang ȝow ſal be circumciſit, a barne of aucht dais auld ſall be circumcidit, and ſa my cunnand, band or conditioun ſall be in ȝour fleſche for euir. Eftir the ſame maner our ſaluiour ſpekis to his diſcipils ſayand: Gang and teiche all natiouns, baptizing thame in the name of the father, and the ſonne,Math. 28 and the haly ſpreit. And as the ſcripture of the auld law ſaid:Gene. 17 
                     Maſculus cuius praeputii caro circumciſa non fuerit, delebitur aīa illa de populo fuo, quia pactum meum irritum fecit. A man child quhais fleſche is nocht circumcidit, the ſaule of him ſall be put away fra his pepil, ſa our ſaluiour ſaid of Baptyme:Ioan. iii. 
                     Niſi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua &amp; ſpiritu ſancto, non poteſt introire in regnum dei. Except ilk mā and woman be borne agane be wattir and the haly ſpreit, he may nocht entir into the kingdome of God.
                  Quhat is the ſpecial powar, vertew, and effect of the ſacrament of Baptyme?Of the vertevv and effect of Baptyme. Trewly the vertew and effect of Baptyme is weil declarit be the Apoſtil S. Paule quhen he callis Baptyme the lawar of regeneratioun and renouatioun. And yat ȝe may plainly vnderſtand this ſpiritual regeneratioun &amp; renouatioun, call to ȝour remembrance, quhow all

men and wemen ar conſauit in original ſyn, except our ſaluiour Chriſt &amp; his mother the glorious virgin Mari, al may ſay the wordis of the Prophet in the Pſalme: Ecce enim in iniquitatibus cōceptus ſū et in peccatis concepit me mater mea.
                     Pſal. 50. Behald I was cōſauit in iniquitie, &amp; my mother cōſauit me in ſynnis. And becauſe of the ſynnis quhairin we ar borne, Chriſt and his mother except, we may al ſay the wordis of ſanct Paule: Eramus natura filii ire ſicut et ceteri.

The ſecund effect of Baptyme is ye reſſauing of the haly ſpreit, quhilk ȝettis in our hartis the trew lufe of God yat we may keip his cōmandis perfitly wt ane ſpiritual libertie, according as ſ.

Sa lang as we remane in ſyn we haue na perfit lufe to God &amp; his cōmandis, we haue na wil to do yame, &amp; gif we do part of yame in our outwart deid, other for feir of punitioun, or for ſū tēporal reward, ye doing is nocht pleſād &amp; acceptabil to god, becauſe ye ſiclik deidis is nocht done

The thrid effect of Baptyme is,The thrid effect of Baptyme. that in Baptyme we ar cled with the rychteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt, he &amp; his rychteouſnes is geuin to vs, ſa that we may ſay trewly Chriſt is ours, his halynes, his rychteouſnes, his meiknes, his mercy, and cheritie is communicat and geuin to vs in the ſacrament of Baptyme, that we may cleth our ſelf with his rychteouſnes, &amp; repute it as our awin, as ſanct Paule techis to the Galathianis:Gala. iii.

                  Quhat is the mattir or the ſenſibil ſigne of this ſacrament? It is Criſme quhilk is confeckit and maid of oyle Olyue and balme ſanctifyit be conſecratioun of ane Biſchope. For as wattir is the ſenſibil mattir in Baptyme, becauſe of ye propertie of weſching &amp; clenging, ſa Criſme is the ſeſibil mattir of Cōfirmatioun for the propertie of vncting. And it betakins that as the Criſme vnctis our foreheid outwartly, ſa the halye ſpreit vnctis our ſaulis inwartly be his grace. And as our ſaluiour Ieſus Chriſt was vnctit ſpiritually with the haly ſpreit aboue al meaſure, ſa in the ſacrament of Confirmatioun we ar vnctit ſpiritually with the ſame grace of ye haly ſpreit with ſic a meaſure as it pleaſis our ſaluiour to geue. And as our ſaluiour (becauſe he was vnctit ſa abundantly with the ſpreit of God) is callit Chriſt be excellence, that is to ſay, ane vnctit biſchope and ane vnctit king. Sa we all that hais reſſauit the ſacrament of Confirmatioun, be reſone of our vncting ar ordanit to be Chriſtis men, and ſa we ar al callit chriſtin men, to be ſpiritual kingis in haly ruling and gyding of our lyfe be keping of the cōmandis of God, and defending of our ſaulis fra our ſpiritual ennymyes with the ſword of gods word, and alſo to be ſpiritual preiſtis or biſchoppis, to offer daily our awin body to god as ane ſpiritual

Quhat is the forme of wordis quhair with this ſacrament is miniſterit &amp; geuin. This is it: Signo te ſigno crucis, &amp; cōfirmote criſmate ſalu

                        is, In nomine patris, et filii, et ſpūs ſancti. Amen The miniſter of this ſacrament ſais to yat perſone quhilk reſſauis it: I mark the with the ſigne of the croſſe, and I confirme the with the Criſme of heilth, in the name of the father, and the ſonne, and the haly ſpreit. Amen.
                  
                     For the plaine intelligence of thir wordis ȝe ſall vnderſtand that as verrai conueniently all men of weir quhilk gangis to fecht in battel vnder yair awin prince, beiris apon yame yair princis baige, quhilk he beiris him ſelf, ye be that ſame baige thai may knawlege thame ſelf to be that kingis knichtis, quhais baige yai beir. Euin ſa, thai that reſſauis the ſacrament of Confirmatioun, yai ar markit with the ſigne of the croſſe, as with ane ſpiritual baige of our king Ieſus Chriſt, quhilk with the croſſe faucht agane ſyn, the deuil and hel, and ouircum thame. Thairfor quhen the miniſter ſais: I marke the with the ſigne of the croſſe. The ſentence of his wordis is this. Thow art ordanit to be ane ſpiritual knycht all the dais of thi lyfe to fycht ſpiritually agane ſyn vnder the baner of the king Ieſus Chriſt. In takin quhairof, heir I mark the with the ſigne of the croſſe quhilk yow ſuld beir euirmair in yi hart as ane ſpiritual baige, mark or takin of thi vocatioun. Quhy reſſaue thai this ſigne of the croſſe apon yair brow? Trewly to ſignifie that ane chriſtin man or woman ſuld neuir be eſchamit nor feirit to grant and cōfeſſe the faith that he hes in his hart, concerning the paſſioun of Ieſus Chriſt, be quhais meritis he trowis to be ſaffit. Naturally and commonly baith feir and ſchame appeiris in a mānis face, feir cauſis ane pail collure of the face, &amp; ſchame cauſis ane red collure. Now thairfor in Confirmatioun we ar markit wt the ſigne of the croſſe

                     HEir we think it ane conuenient place to declare to ȝow the ſeuin giftis of the halye ſpreit, yat ȝe may wt mair diligence &amp; deuotioun aſke yame of God in ȝour daily prayaris. The firſt gift is wiſdome.Of the gift of vviſdome. Quhairin ſtandis yis wiſdome? Trewly it ſtandis in twa pointis Firſt to knaw god, how he is eternal, almychty, mercyful, rychteous, faithfull, gentill, &amp; liberal to the. Secundly, to haue in that ſame knawlege a ſpiritual gift, delectatioun and pleaſure in God. Heir quhat the prophet ſais to vs all in the Pſalme: Guſtate et videte quoniam ſuauis eſt dominus.
                     Pſal. 33. Taiſt and ſe quhow ſweit is the Lord. And trewly quhaſa hais this gift of wiſedome, he luffis God wt all his hart, with all his ſaule, with all his mynd and all his ſtrenth, he luffis nathing bot in God and for Goddis ſaik, he referris all gud that he dois to the glore of God. He contemnis al carnal pleaſure, al erdly richis, all warldly dignitie that is contrarye to the lufe of God, or that is had aganis the command of God. The gift of wiſdome is nocht gottin be ye ſtudye and labour of man, bot be ane faithfull prayar maid to God, as ſanct Iames teichis ſayand:Iacobi. i. Gif ony of ȝow want wiſdome, lat him aſk it at God, quhilk giffis to all men largely, and ȝe, lat him aſk it in faith doutand nathing bot God may and will geue it to him. Quhow may it be knawin quha hes yis gift of wiſdome? Trewly be certane properteis quhilk ſanct Iames deſeriuis:Iaco. iii. The wiſdome quhilk is fra aboue

it is firſt puir, clein, &amp; chaſt. It is peaceabil, gentil and eaſy to be entretit, agreand to all gud thingis, ful of mercy, and of gud fruitis, alwais do and gud warkis.
                  
                     Donum intellectus.
                     Of ye gift of vnderſtanding. Pſal. 118. The ſecund gift of the haly ſpreit is the trew vnderſtanding of the word of God quhilk we ſuld aſk daily in our prayar ſayand with the prophet in the Pſalme: Da mihi intellectum, et ſcrutabor legem tuam. O gud Lord geue me vnderſtanding and I ſal ſerche thi commandis. Quhow can we vnderſtand trewly the word of God except that Chriſt oppin it to vs?Apoca. iii quhilk beiris the key of Dauid. He oppinnis, &amp; na man cloſis, he cloſis and na mā oppinnis. He oppins the word of god to certane men &amp; wemen to quhom it pleiſis him to oppin. And hydis it fra certane men and wemen, fra quhom it pleſis him to hyde it, according as he ſais in the euangil ſpeikand to his eternal father:Math. xi. 
                     Cōfitebor tibi pater coeli et terre, quia abſcondiſti hec a ſapientibus et prudentibus, et reuelaſti ea paruulis. I confeſſe to the O father of heuin and eird, yat thow hes hyde thir miſteries of mannis redemptioun fra men warldly wyſe and prudent, and hes reuelitt hame to meik men.
                  
                     Donū conſilii. The thrid gift is callit counſal.Of ye gift of coūſeil. Be the gift of wiſdome we ken God with delectatioun &amp; pleiſure. Be the gift of vnderſtanding we haue trew intelligence of Goddis word. Sa conueniently followis ye gift of counſal, quhilk

is to haue a ſpedie, a reddye, and a gud will to do willingly as the word of God byddis and counſallis vs to do, ſa that be the vertew of yis gift we may ſay with ye Prophet in the Pſalme: Voluntarie ſacrificabo tibi O gud Lord I will mak ſacrifice to the willingly.Pſal. 57. That is to ſay, I will do my dewtie to the, nocht for compulſioun of payne, bot with my awin free will luffingly. The haly ſpreit is callit the ſpreit of libertie, becauſe he geuis vs grace to do our gud deidis wt fredome and libertie of our hart.

                     Of ye gift of Fortitude.
                     Donum fortitudinis. The fourt gift is ſpiritual ſtrenth of our mynd to thoil all maner of aduerſite with patience, to do al thingis quhilk we aucht to do be rycht, willingly as it is ſaid in ye thrid gift, and nocht to gang by the veritie and rycht for ony mannis pleiſure, feire, reward, or malice. This gift is neceſſarie to al chriſtin men and wemen,2. Ti. iii. becauſe yat S. Paule ſais: Omnes qui pie volunt viuere in Chriſto, perſecutionem patientur. Al men and wemen, quhilk wald leif ane gud lyfe conforme to the euangil of Chriſt, ſall thoil perſecutioun be thame that ar euil geuin. Be yis gift it is knawi

For as be ye immolatioun and ſacrifice of the Paſchal lambe the pepil of Iſrael was deliuerit fra the vengeance quhilk the Angel tuk apon the Egiptians, and ſa finally fra the captiuitie of king Pharao.

Our chriſtin faith is nocht groundit apon the natural reaſone of mā, bot apon the trew and infallibil word of God. For in this ſacrament eftir the wordis of conſecratioun we ſee wt our eyne the figure of breid and wyne,Of the verite of the body and blude of our ſaluiour Chriſt in the ſacrament of the Altar.

Of all the merualis that God hes wrocht, he hes maid ane to be ane remembrance of all the laif, quhilk is that in yis precious ſacrament of of the altare, he hes geuin fude to yame, yt feiris him. Quhairfor O chriſtin man prepair thi ſelf worthily that thow may reſſaue this fude to thi ſaluatioun.Incorporatioun to our ſaluiour Chriſt The ſecund fruit of this bliſſit ſacrament is mair perfit incorporatioun to Chriſt For quhen with faith and cheritie we reſſaue yis precious fude, we ar mair ioynit to Chriſt our heid as his miſtik mēberis. And heir thow ſuld conſider the difference that is betwene corporal fude of the body, and this ſpiritual fude of thi ſaule.

                         et de calice bibat. Qui enim māducat et bibit indigne, iudicium ſibi manducat &amp; bibit, nō diiudicans corpus domini. Let a man or a woman firſt examine him ſelf, diſcuſſe and preif him ſelf, and ſa lat him eit of that precious breid, and drynk of that coupe. For quha ſa eitis and drinkis vnworthily, eitis &amp; drinkis his iugement &amp; eternal damnatioun, becauſe he puttis na difference betwene the body of our Lord and vthir common meit. As all chriſtin men &amp; wemen, quhilk worthily reſſauis the body of our Lord in this precious ſacrament yai get ye ſeuin ſpiritual frutis afore reherſit, ſa al yai quhilk reſſauis the ſame ſacrament vnworthily, thai reſſaue it to thair iugement &amp; eternal dānatioun, ȝe and ofttymes thai ar puniſſit be god in this preſent warld be tēporal paynis of weaknes, ſicknes and dede, as ſanct Paule beiris witnis in the ſame place.

Sen ſa it is,vvith ane rycht intentioun. I exhort ȝow all (O chriſtin men &amp; wemen, that afore ȝe cum to the buird of Chriſt yair to reſſaue his precious body) yat ȝe prepair ȝour ſelf to cum worthily, reuerently, &amp; deuoitly as it becommis chriſtin men to do.
                  Firſt prepair ȝour ſelf to cum with ane gud will &amp; rycht intentioun. Cum nocht to the buird of God with ane will or intentioun to get glore or louing of man, for ȝour appeirand halynes, for than ȝe cum with ypocriſie. Cum nocht allanerly for ane vſe and cuſtome to do as the laif dois and allanerly for the command of the kirk, for than ȝe cum with compulſioun. Bot cum to the buird of God wt deuotioun, willing to obey the command of God &amp; the kirk for goddis lufe and weil of ȝour awin ſaule, willing &amp; intēding to get the ſeuin giftis and fruitis afore reherſit, yat ȝe may reſſaue ye fude of ȝour ſaule, yt ȝe may be mair ꝑfitly incorporat in to Chriſt Ieſu ȝour ſaluiour, that ȝe may grow in Faith, Hoip, and Cheritie, that ȝe may haue quick remembrance of Chriſtis paſſioun, and geue to him thankis thairfor, yat ȝe may leif in perfite vnitie, cōcord and paice of chriſtin pepil, &amp; finally that ȝe may haue eternal lyfe in the kingdome of heuin. Lat this be ȝour intentioun quhen ȝe cum to ye buird of God. Secundly,vvith ane perfit and hail faith. prepare ȝour ſelf to cum wt ane perfite and hail faith of this haly ſacrament quhilk ſtādis in four pointis. Firſt beleif fermely and dout nocht, yat vnder the forme of breid quhilk thow ſeis with thi bodyly eyne, thair is

contenit the trew body of Chriſt Ieſu, the ſame body that was borne of the virgin Marie, that was crucifeit apon the croſſe, yat raiſe fra ye dede the thrid day, that aſcendit to heuin and ſittis at the rycht hand of God the father almychty. Put away out of thi heid al fantaſeis of natural reaſone, ſtand ſicker in the faith of halye kirk, cleif faſt to ye word of God quhilk is declarit to ȝow largely afore quhen we ſpak of the wordis of cō
                     ſecratioun. Secundly beleue fermely that the hail body of Chriſt is in ye hail vſte and alſo in ilk a part of the ſame, beleif fermely thair is bot ane body of Chriſt that is in mony vſtis, that is in ſyndry and mony altaris, ȝe that is in heuin ſittand at the rycht hand of God, and that is in the ſacrament really preſent, it is ane &amp; the ſame body. Thridly trow fermely yt eftir the wordis of conſecratioun pronuncit be the preiſt (be inſtitutioun of our ſaluiour) the ſubſtance of the breid is turnit into the ſubſtance of the bodye of Chriſt, remaning allanerly the accidentis, that is to ſay, ye figure of breid, ye ſweitnes of breid, the quhytnes of breid with ſiclyk, ſa yat thair is nocht in the ſacrament the ſubſtance of breid. Fourtly, quhen thow reſſauis in the ſacrament the body of Chriſt, beleif alſo conſtantly that yu reſſauis ane leiffand body. For as ſanct Paule ſais:Roma. 6. Chriſt ryſand agane fra the dede may de

                      na mair, dede ſal haue na mair powar ouir him Than becauſe yow reſſauis his lyffand body, yu reſſauis alſo his ſaule &amp; alſo his blud, for ilkane

lyiffand body hes baith ſaule &amp; blud. And becauſe alſo yt his godhede ſen ye firſt begīning of his incarnatioun left neuir his body nor his ſaul, trow ſickirly yat quhen yu reſſauis the body of Chriſt yat yu reſſauis alſo his godhed. Sa o chriſtin mā &amp; woman, beleif fermely yt in the ſacrament of the altare yu reſſauis four thingis to ye maiſt precious &amp; profitabil, ye body of Chriſt, his ſaule, his blud, &amp; his godhed. Sa it followis yat yu reſſauis na les in ane lytil vſte than ye preiſt reſſauis in ane gret vſte, Alſo it followis yat yu reſſauis bayth the body &amp; blud of Chriſt in ane forme of breid als weil as the preiſt reſſauis thame &amp; ilkane of yame in twa formes of breid and wyne, and alſo dout nocht bot yat yu reſſauis the hail cōtent of the ſacrament als weil as the preiſt dois, &amp; thair with yu ſuld hald the cōtent cōforme to ye auld &amp; lāg vſe of ye vniuerſal kirk of god, &amp; decretis of ſyndry general coūſals quhilk hes ordanit ye ſame to be done nocht wtout neceſſary cauſe. Eftir yis maner cum to ye buird of god with ane hail &amp; cōſtant faith, trowand ſickerly yat yu reſſauis Chriſt Ieſu quhilk apon the croſſe ſched his blud, to weſche the fra thi ſynnis, quhilk deit to recounſale the to ye father eternal, yat maid iuſt and perfit ſatiſfactioun for all thi ſynnis, yat redemit the fra the deuil &amp; hel, &amp; hes deſeruit for the the kingdom of heuin. Beleif this als ſickerly as thow had ſene him dee. Thridly prepare thi ſelf to cum to ye buird of god wt ane clein cō
                     ſcience. Gyf yu war to reſſaue ane king to thi houſe,vvith ane clein conſcience. thow wald nocht fail to clenge thi houſe and mak it clein wiſh all thi diligence, thow wald put on thi

beſt rayment that thow mycht reſſaue him with honeſtie to his pleiſure. And ſen ſa it is yat yow art to reſſaue the king of al kingis in to ye houſe of thi ſaule, reſſaue him with ane clein cōſcience, doand the counſale of ſanct Paule:i. Cor. xi. 
                     Probet autē ſeipſum homo. Lat a man, that is to reſſaue the bodye of Chriſt, firſt preif him ſelf, call him ſelf to the count of his lyfe, examine his conſcience, ſeirche weil him ſelf gif he be fylit wt ony dedlie ſyn. And eftirhend yat he perſaue his vnclenis, lat him cum to the fountane of Penance, be contrit with thi hart for all thi ſynnis particulari, &amp; ſpecially. Mak ane hail cōfeſſioun wt thi mouth of all thi ſynnis that thow can cal to thi remembrance, to ane preiſt ye miniſter of Chriſt, quhilk hais auctoritie to aſſoilȝe the. And as mekil as yu may mak ſatiſfactioun, doand the worthi frutis of penance, in faſting, praying, &amp; almous deid. Quhen thow hais maid thi ſaule faire and clein eftir this maner, than put on ye thi beſt garment, quhilk is trew lufe of God and thi nychtbour, yt Chriſt ſay nocht to the:Math. 22 
                     Amice quomodo huc intraſti, non habens veſtem nuptialem? Frend how hes thow enterit in to my buird, nocht haiffand the wedding garment, quhilk is Cheritie? Lufe thairfor thi God abone all thing and thi nychtbour as thi ſelf. Do as thow wald be done to, Forgeue thi nychtbour his offence, as yu wald that God forgeue the. Lufe freind and faa for Goddis ſaik, and ſa cled with ye garment of cheritie, yow may cum ſickirly to the buird of god.

                  The x. Cheptour.
                  
                     Of the neceſſary inſtitutioun of the ſacrament of PennanceIT is nocht vnknawin to ȝow (O chriſtin pepil) yat quhen a mā or a woman fallis in ony bodyly ſeicknes, he is nocht healit agane be ane new birth of his mother, bot with the operatioun of ſum hailſum medicyne geuin to him be

ſum cunning and expert medicinar. Sa it is in our ſpiritual life as daily experience ſchawis A chriſtin man or a chriſtin woman eftir Baptyme cummand to the vſe of his awin fre will, actually tranſgres &amp; breikis the commandis of God and ſa fallis into ye ſpiritual ſicknes of his ſaul, quhairof he can nocht get remeid be Baptyme, for it ſuld nocht be reſſauit agane. Thairfore our ſaluiour Chriſt nocht willing yat we want conuenient remeid to help vs and reſtore vs agane to the heale of our ſaule, he hais ordanit the ſacrament of Pennance as ane ſpiritual medicyne to be geuin to al thame yat ar ſick in yair ſaule be dedlie ſyn. And for the plaine vnderſtanding of penance it is to be cōſiderit, quhat differēce thair is betwene the vertew of Pennance and the ſacrament of Pennance.
                  The vertew of Pennance is conuerſioun and turning of a mannis hart to God fra all his ſynnis with ane inwart ſorrow, greif, or diſpleſure,The vertevv of Pennance with ane hatrent &amp; deteſtatioun of the ſame ſynnis, nocht only becauſe he hes be thame incurrit the indignatioun of God and deſeruit hel (as Cayn, Achab, &amp; Iudas was ſorye, and ȝit yair ſorrow was nocht to thame profitabil) bot principally becauſe yat throw his ſynnis he hes offēdit ye hie maieſtie of almychty God his father, quhais cōmand he is obliſſit to obſerue &amp; keip wt lufe &amp; reuerence. Secundly beſyde yis inwart ſorrow, we mone haue ane gret deſire to be clēgit &amp; deliuerit fra our ſynnis &amp; to get agane ye grace &amp; fauor of god be ſir wais &amp; remeidis, quhilk god hes ordanit to be done to get agane his fauor.
                  
                     Thridly we mone haue ane ſtedfaſt purpoſe and mynd neuir to o
                        •
                     end agane almychty God our heuinly father. For he that ſais that he is ſorye for his offenſis done agane the maieſtie of God, and ȝit ſtil perſeueris or intendis to perſeuir in the ſame, is na penitent perſone, bot ane diſſimular and ſcornar of Penance. And thus is Penance cōmonly takin in in the haly ſcripture. And this Pennance is ſa neceſſarie for mannis ſaluatioun, that without it, na man that offendis God, can be ſaiffit and get euirlaſting lyfe,Luce. xiii. according as our ſaluiour 
                        •
                     ais: Niſi penitentiā egeritis, peribitis ſimiliter omnes. Excep
                        •
                      that ȝe do Pennance, ȝe ſall all periſche. To this Pennance almychty God callis vs with the wordis of haly ſcripture in ſyndry placis. In Ezechiel it is ſaid thus:Ezechi. 18 
                     Conuertimini, et agite penitentiam ab omnibus iniquitatibus veſtris, et non erit vobis ī ruinam iniquitas. Turne to me (ſais God almychty) and do Pennance for all ȝour ſynnis and than all ȝour ſynnis ſal nocht be to ȝow damnabil. Pro
                           •
                        icite omnes iniquitates veſtras, in quibus preuaricati 
                           •
                        
                        ſtis, &amp; facite vobis cor nouum et ſpiritum nouum.
                  
                  Caſt awaye all ȝour iniquitie, quhairin ȝe haue tranſgreſſit the cōmand of God, and mak ȝow ane new hart and ane new ſpreit: Quare moriemini domus Iſrael? quia nolo mortem peccatoris ſed magis, vt conuertatur et viuat. Quhy will ȝe dee O ȝe houſe of Iſrael? for I wald nocht the dede of a ſynnar, bot rather that he turne agane to me &amp; leif the lyfe of grace in this warld, and in the lyfe of glore in the warld to cum. And our ſaluiour ſais in the

euangil: Non veni vocare iuſtos,
                     Math. 9. Luce. 5. 
                     ſed peccatores ad penitentiam. I come nocht to call iuſt men, bot ſynnaris to penance. And ſanct Paule ſais to ye Romanis: Ignoras, quia benignitas dei ad penitē
                        tiā te adducit? Kennis thow nocht that the gentilnes of God leidis y• to pennance? as he mycht ſay: Quhair God for thi ſynnis mycht puniſch the incontinent, ȝit he ſpairis the &amp; differris his punitioun to that effect that thow may ken the lang ſufferance of God and turne to pennance. And in the Apocalips our ſaluiour ſais to ane certane biſchop:Apoca. 2. 
                     Memor eſto vnde excideris et age penitentiā, &amp; prima opera fac. Remēber fra quhat ſtait thow art fallin and do pennance, and alſo do the firſt werkis agane, as he mycht ſay, Remember yat thowart fallin fra the ſtait of grace and feruent lufe of God, thairfore do pennance and alſo fulfil the cōmandis of God, and do the deidis of mercy with as feruent lufe as thow was wont to do afore thow fel to ſyn. Thus O chriſtin man and woman ȝe may ſee quhow eirneſtly God almychty callis all ſynnaris to pennance in ſyndry placis of the ſcripture.
                  The ſacrament of Pennance is properly the abſolutioun pronuncit be the preiſt,Sacramentum penitentie. apon ſic mē and wemen as ar penitent for yair ſynnis, &amp; ſa makis ane knawlege &amp; ſchawis thame ſelf to be penitent. This ſacrament is the ſecund tabil or buird quhilk is ordanit to ſaif al thame that ar ſchipbrokin eftir Baptyme. To thame yt ar lyk to be drownit in hell for original ſyn is ordanit

buird of baptym.

And ſa turnand to God, doutles he ſall obtene the

                     Conuertimini ad me in toto corde veſtro, in ieiunio, fletu, et planctu, et ſcindite corda veſtra, et nō veſtimēta veſtra, ait dn̄s omnipotens. Turne to me with al ȝour hart, with faſting, greting &amp; murning, and cut ȝour clayis ſais the Lord almychty. Quhen yow heiris him ſay: turne to me with all ȝour hart, with greting and murning, and cut ȝour hartis &amp; nocht ȝour clayis. vnderſtand plainly, yat God requiris of the contritioun of the hart. And quhen yu heiris him ſay, with faſting, ken weil that he requiris ſatiſfactioun of deid, quhairof faſting is a part as we ſall declare mair largely eftirhend, &amp; lykwiſe quhow we ar obliſſit to confeſſioun.
                  It is alſo to be notit that na man can haue contritioun, mak cōfeſſioun, &amp; do ſatiſfactioun,Fides. except that he haue a perfite faith to the word of God, quhilk as it is the ground of al vthir vertewis, ſa is it the foundatioun of the ſacrament of Pennance, &amp; alſo of thir thre thingis requirit afore the ſacrament of Pennance, Contritioun, Confeſſioun, and Satiſfactioun.Faith is y

Nother can ony mā haue ſure hoip of remiſſioun except yat firſt he haue a perfit faith, &amp; beleue ſtedfaſtly yt God will be merciful to him.
                  
                     Now thairfor O ſynful mā and woman, quhilk kennis the abhominatioun of all thi ſynnis, &amp; wald be loſit fra thame, ground thi ſelf in the faith &amp; hoip of Goddis mercy. Remember quhat God ſais in Ezechiel.Ezechi. 33. 
                     Viuo ego dicit dominus deus: Nolo mortem impii, ſed vt conuertatur impius a via ſua, et viuat. Als trew as I leif ſais the Lord, I will nocht the dede of a wickit man, bot that he be turnit fra his euil wayis and be ſaiffit. Think alwais quhow our ſaluiour offerris his mercy to all penitent perſonis and callis apon thame ſayand:Math. 11. 
                     Venite ad me omnes, qui laboratis et one
                           •
                        ati eſtis, &amp; ego reficiam vos. Cum to me all ȝe that labouris &amp; ar ladin with the burdin of ſyn, and I ſal refreſch ȝow. Ken ȝour ſynnis and repent thame, cum to me be faith &amp; obediens, and I ſall haue mercy on ȝow &amp; will refreſch ȝow heir with grace and in heuin with glore. Cal to remembrance quhow our ſaluiour fulfillit yis promis in deid to the theif, quhilk was hingand on his rycht hand, to Marie Magdalene, quhilk was fillit with ſeuin deuillis, to ſanct Petir yat denyit him, to ſanct Mathew that was ane Publicane. The woman of Cananie cryit for his mercy and gat it. As the prodigal ſonne, quhilk departit fra his father and ſpendit all his gair in wantones, gloutony and huirdome, eftir that he kennit his miſerie, and came agane to his father, kennit his falt, aſkit mercy, maid ſupplicatioun to him with gret meiknes, he was reſſauit agane to gret fauouris, nocht without gret ioy and gladnes. Sa O ſynful man, ken the miſerabil ſlait of ſyn, quhairin thow hes leiffit

agane the cōmand of God, as the ſeruand of ſyn and condemnit to hel, cum agane to thi heuinly father be trew pennance and prayar, and dout nocht bot that thow ſall be reſſauit to the mercy of god. Sa ground the ſelf apon ſiclyck promis and exempils of mercy, and trow ſickerly yat for the meritis of Chriſtis bitter paſſioun, God almychty hes promiſſit and grantit remiſſioun of ſynnis to be geuin be ane preiſt as his miniſter, to al yame yat ar fallin fra the grace, quhilk yai reſſauit in Baptyme, and be his calling turnis agane to God be pennance. And lyk as men of perfite aige afore thai cum to Baptyme, is techit to haue a perfite faith in ye promis of god, quhilk is that all his ſynnis baith original and actual ar forgeuin to him in Baptyme, ſa euerilk man afore he entir to fruitful penance, he mone haue for ane ground and foundatioun, a perfite faith quhairby he mone hoip be the ſacrament of pennance, to get remiſſioun of al his ſynnis, quhair to we cum as isafore ſaid be Contritioun, Confeſſioun, and ſatiſfactioun.
                  Quhat is contritioun?Of contritioun the firſt part of penāce It is ane ſorrow takin wilfully for ſynnis with ane purpoſe to be cōfeſſit and mak ſatiſfactioun. That this diffinitioun may be ſet furth to ȝow mair plainely ȝe ſall vnderſtand that contritioun is ane inwart gret ſorrow, diſpleſure, &amp; greif, quhilk a trew penitent, callit be Goddis grace, hes in his hart for all his ſynnis. Thairfor thow ſynful man &amp; woman that wald haue contritioun, firſt be inſtructioun

of gods word examine, diſcus, ſerche and rype weil thi conſcience, remember thi awin ſynful &amp; vicious leuing, conſider the multitude and grauite of al thi ſynnis, quhairby thow hes prouokit the hie indignatioun &amp; wraith of God aganis the. Secundly conſider the dignitie &amp; perfectioun of that ſtait, quhairvnto thow was callit in Baptyme, think on the promis quhilk yu maid to thi god, haue mynd of the gret &amp; ſyndry benefitis daily reſſauit of god. Thus O chriſtin man and woman being callit be the preuenand grace, &amp; mouit be the gret gudnes of God done to the on the ane part, and with thi awin ingratitude and vnkindnes to god on ye vthir part, yu ſall conſaue ane erneſt ſorrow &amp; haitful diſpleaſure in thi hart, for that that thow hes left &amp; forſakin ſa luffing a Lord, that thow hes followit ſyn, and thairby yu hes crabbit &amp; offendit God, of quhom thow was callit to be in the ſtait of a ſon &amp; inheritour with our ſaluiour Ieſꝰ Chriſt. Say thairfor to him with king Dauid in the Pſalme:Pſal.

Quhy is it ſaid afore ane preiſt the miniſter of God be his ordinatioun? Becauſe a preiſt hes y• keis, that is ſay, the auctoritie of lowſing and binding geuin to him be our ſaluiour Chriſt, &amp; ſa hes nocht ane lawit man quhilk is nocht ane conſecrat preiſt. And for the declaratioun of yis ȝe ſal vnderſtand, yat our ſaluiour Chriſt in the day of his reſurrectioun, ſaid thir wordis to his Apoſtillis:Ioan. 20. 
                     Quorum remiſeritis peccata, remittuntur eis, &amp; quorum retinueritis, retenta ſūt. Quhais ſynnis ȝe forgeue, thai ar forgeuin to yame, and quhais ſynnis ȝe hald vnforgeuin, thai a
                        •
                      vnforgeuin. In thir wordis our ſaluiour expreſly gaue powar and auctoritie to his Apoſtillis and al vthir yair ſucceſſouris in ſiclyk degre &amp; office to forgeue ſynnis, &amp; to hald ſynnis vnforgeuin. Now it is impoſſibil that ane preiſt the miniſter of Chriſt ſall ken, quhen he ſuld forgeue to men thair ſynnis, and quhen he ſuld hald thair ſynnis vnforgeuin, except yat yair ſynnis be ſchawin to him in confeſſioun. It is playn be the wordis afore ſaid yat a preiſt the miniſter of the abſolutioun is ordanit to be vnder Chriſt ane iuge of mannis conſcience. And quhow can a iuge diſcerne ane cauſe, quhil he ken it? Sa quhow can a preiſt diſcerne quhom he ſuld forgeue and quhom nocht, quhil he heir ane ſinnar oppin and reherſe his ſynnis to him? Quhow can a Medicynar diſcerne quhom he may hail, and quhom he may nocht hail, quhil he ken the ſeicknes? Gyf thow haue ane wound in thi body

yow can nocht be helpit be ane Cirurginar, quhil yow ſchaw thi wound to him. Sen it is ſwa yat our ſaluiour hais geuin powar to ane lauchful preiſt, his miniſter, to bind &amp; lowſe ſynnis, and to forgeue ſynnis, and hald ſynnis vnforgeuin, be vertew of the ſame auctoritie he hes ordanit yt al ſynnaris penitent, quhilk wald be lowſit fra thair ſynnis, yat yai ſal maik confeſſioun of yair ſynnis to ane preiſt his miniſter. Quhairfor O chriſtin mā &amp; woman according to the doctrine, ordinatioun and cōmand of god and haly kirk, cum to cōfeſſioun, ſeik for ane lauchful miniſter quhilk may pronunce ye wordis of abſolutioun to the and aſſolȝe the fra thi ſynnis, and ken yat he occupies the place of god, thairfor bow doune thi ſelf to mak thi cōfeſſioun to him. And afore yu cum to confeſſioun, call to thi remembrance all thi ſynnis, quhilk thi conſcience tellis the, that thow hes done agane the gudnes of God. And cummand to confeſſioun, declare &amp; ſchaw thame with thi mouth to almychty God before ye preiſt Gods miniſter, with all circumſtancis of tyme, place, perſone and purpoſe, that may aggrege ye ſyn, and thair blame, accuſe, and condemne thi ſelf for ane vnkind prodigal ſonne to God thi father, for ane vntrew ſeruand, quhilk be the lycht of Gods word, kend the commandis of thi Lord God and kepit thame nocht, and was indewit with mony giftis of the haly ſpreit, and exercit yame nocht. and ſa deteſting &amp; abhorring thi ſynnis &amp; deſyreand to be quit of thame, confeſſe

And this lawly and meik ſubmiſſioun in thi confeſſioun, with conſent to reſſaue ye ſaid diſcipline &amp; pennance, is ane part of ſatifactioun, quhilk is ye thrid meane to cum to ye ſacrament of Pennance as is afore reherſit.
                  
                     Of ſatiſfaccioun the thrid part of penāce.Heir ȝe mone vnderſtand, that ſatiſfactioun quhilk is heir ſpokin of, is nocht ſa to be takin, ye ane penitēt ſynnar may worthily merit &amp; deſerue remiſſioun of ſynnis be ony paine or puniſſioun to be tholit be him, or to mak to God ony iuſt &amp; ful recōpence equiualent to ye ſyn, quhilk he hes cōmittit aganis god, &amp; to mak ſatiſfactioun for our ſynnis, for on this maner, it is nocht in the powar of man to ſatiſfie, for ye ſatiſfactioun hes only our ſaluiour Chriſt wrocht and fulfillit be his bitter paſſioun, according as S. Paul ſais: Qui dedit ſemetipſum pro nobis,
                     Titum. 2. 
                     vt nos redemeret ab omni iniquitate. He hes geuin him ſelf to the dede for vs, to redeme vs fra all our iniquite. That is to ſay, he hes maid ſatiſfactioun and payit our ranſome be his bitter paſſion, makand ane full mendis for all our ſynnis. Alſo ſanct

                     init thus: Eſt cauſas peccatorum excindere &amp; earum ſuggeſtionibus aditum non indulgere. Satiſfactioun of pennance is to cut away the occaſionis of ſynne, and to geue na entrance to thair ſuggeſtionis. For the declaratioun of this, ȝe ſal vnderſtand yat eftirhend that our actual ſyn is forgeuin be faith and the ſacrament of Pennance, thair remanis in vs certane dreggis of ſyn, that is to ſay, ſtif inclinatiouns and motiouns to the ſame ſynnis quhilk we did afore. Thairfor that we be nocht ouircum be conſenting to the ſame inclinatiouns and motiouns, we mone ſtudye to pleaſe God with ane meik and lawly hart reddy to bring furth the fruitis of pennance, according to the cōmand of ſanct Iohne:Math. 3.

And to mak ſatiſfactioun on yis maner we may leir be the wordis of ſanct Paul ſayand thus:i. Cor. xi.

Satiſfactioun in this place is to haue a full purpoſe to leid a new lyfe, doand the counſale of ſanct Paule, ſayand to ye Romanis: Sicut exhibuiſtis membra veſtra ſeruire immundicie et iniquitati ad iniquitatem,Roma. 6. ita nunc exhibete

Alſo this is a ſatiſfactioun neceſſarie yt a penitent perſone declare to his nechtbour yat he hes forgeuin to him all his offēcis, to reſtore to all men that we haue iniuſtly takin or keipis fra ony mā, to recompence al hurtis &amp; iniuryis done be vs to our nychbour, according to our powar, and nocht only to wil to do thus, bot alſo to do it in deid, in all pointis quhairin our nychtbour aucht to be ſatiſfyit be ony rycht reaſone.

Thairfor the ſcripture ſais: Be nocht ſlawe to conuert and turne to gode, and defar nocht fra day to day. For the wrath of god (yat is to ſay) ye rychteous iugemēt of god cūmis ſuddenly, &amp; in tyme of vengeance he wil deſtroy the. Quhair for hauand hoip of the mercy of god on the ane ſyde, &amp; feir of the iuſtice of god on the vthir, lat vs neuir diſpair of the forgeuenes of our ſynnis, nor ȝit preſumptuouſly remane ſtil in our ſynnis, kēnand yat the iuſtice of god will ſtraitly require the dettis of all men, quhilk ar nocht forgeuin throw his mercy offerit in Chriſt. To quhom be honour and glore with the father and the haly ſpreit for euir and euir.

                  The xii. Cheptour.
                  IN the inſtitutioun of yis haly ſacrament we may weil vnderſtand the gratious prouidence of God towart vs, quhilk at al tymes of our lyfe prouidis to vs help &amp; remeid yai we may leif ane ſpiritual lyfe to his pleaſure &amp; ſaluatioun of our ſaulis. In Baptyme we ar borne agane wt ane ſpiritual byrth, &amp; maid new creaturis

in Chriſt Ieſu, and begynnis our ſpiritual lyfe. In Confirmatioun we ar cōfirmit be ſtrenth of the haly ſpreit to ſtand ſickerly in the ſame lyfe. In ye Euchariſt we reſſaue ſpiritual fude to the ſuſtētatioun of our ſaulis, and to be incorporat and ioynit to Chriſt Ieſu our heid &amp; king. And quhen we throw tentatioun of our ſpiritual ennymyes, with conſent of our free will, fallis fra the ſame ſpiritual lyfe, be ye ſacrament of Pennance we ar reſtorit agane. Now quhat is yair mair to be done to vs, than to be helpit be ſum ſpiritual remeid in ye tyme of our departing fra yis warld?Hovv expedient it vvas till ordane ye ſacrament of extreme vnctioun. Than trewly we haue gret miſter of help, conſolatioun and cōfort to be geuin baith to our body and to our ſaule. For of al tymes of our lyfe the tyme of our departing is maiſt perrillous, becauſe yat the deuil our ennymye (ſpecially at that tyme) gangis about lyk ane ramping Lyon ſeikand quhom he may deuoir and ſwally, be cōſent to ſyn. Than is he maiſt fyerie and crewel to caſt aganis vs his fyrie dartis, to ſla our ſaulis be ſum tranſgreſſioun of the commandis of God. Than is he maiſt diligent and beſye to bring vs fra our faith, to ſtop our entrance to heuin, kennand that gif he preuale nocht agane vs at the tyme of our departing, that he ſall neuir preuale agane vs. Quhairfor that we ſuld nocht want ſpiritual help &amp; remeid in tyme of our laſt ſeiknes or yat apperandly is lyk to be our laſt ſeiknes, our ſaluiour Chriſt Ieſu hes prouidit for vs ye ſacrament of extreme

vnctioun, quhairof we ſal ſchortly declare to ȝow ye inſtitutioun, the ꝓmulgatioun &amp; the vertew, effect &amp; profit of the ſame. Wald ȝe ken quha ordanit this ſacrament? quha bot our ſaluiour Chriſt Ieſus? as we may gather of ye wordis writtin in the euangil of S. Mark.Marce. 6. That our ſaluiour Chriſt ordanit the ſacrament of extreme vnctioun. Thair we reid yat our ſaluiour Chriſt callit to him his twelf Apoſtils, &amp; ſend thame twa &amp; twa togidder throw the land of Iewry, techit thame quhat thai ſuld ſay, gaue thame powar, quhilk yai mycht vſe in helping of the pepil.

Thai paſſit furth &amp; prechit to the pepil to do pennance, thai keſt out mony deuillis fra men and wemen that was poſſeſſit, thai vnctit with oyle mony ſeik men &amp; wemen, &amp; yai war heilit of yair ſeiknes. In thir wordis yu hes plainly ſchawin to the, yat the haly Apoſtils vſit to vnct ſeik folk wt oyle &amp; thai war healit. This trewly yai vſit nocht of thair awin preſumptioun, bot allanerly be the inſtitutioun, ordinatioun &amp; cōmand of yair Lord and maiſter our ſaluiour Ieſus Chriſt. Attour the effect of yair vncting wes nocht only to heile the bodyes of thame yat was ſeik (quhilk commonly was done in the begynning of the kirk for cōfirmatioun of the faith) bot ſpecially &amp; maiſt principally, it was the help, conſolatioun &amp; helth of ye ſaulis of thame yt was ſeik, becauſe ye Apoſtils was nocht ordanit to be corporal Cirurginaris allanerly, bot erar to be prechouris &amp; ſpiritual medicynaris of the ſaulis. Sa ye ald doctouris of the kirk, ſiclyk as venerabil Beide

Nochttheles ye Apoſtil ſanct Iames, ſet furth &amp; declarit the ſame ſacrament in to his epiſtil,Iacobi. 5. S. Iames ſittis forth and declaris this ſacrament. ſchawand plainly the forme &amp; maner of adminiſtratioun of ye ſame, ſayand: Infirmatur quis ex vobis? Inducat preſbyteros eccleſie et orent ſuꝑ eum, vngentes eū oleo in nomine dn̄i, et oratio fidei ſaluabit infirmū, et alleuiabit eum dn̄s, &amp; ſi in peccatis ſit, remittētur ei. Gyf ony be ſeik amang ȝow, lat him call for the preiſtis of the kirk, &amp; lat yame pray ouir him, &amp; vnct him with oyle in the name of our Lord, &amp; the prayar of faith ſal ſaif him that is ſeik, &amp; our Lord ſal comfort him, &amp; gif he be in ſynnis, yai ſal be forgeuin to him. Heir we haue ane document, yat the vncting, quhair of S. Iames ſpeikis, is ane ſacrament, becauſe it hes ane certane forme of wordis, ane ſenſibil &amp; effectuous ſigne of grace, &amp; alſo a promis of ye ſame expreſly put. The word of God quhairwith this ſacrament is miniſterit is ſignifyit quhen ſanct Iames ſais, lat yame vnct him in the name of our Lord. Sa the preiſt yat is miniſter of yis ſacramēt vnctis ye ſeik perſone▪ in the name of the father, and the ſon, &amp; the haly ſpreit, beſeikand almychty God, yat quhatſaeuir the ſeik perſone hes ſynnit aganis God be abuſioun of ony of his wittis, ſenſis, or mē
                     bris, it may be forgiffin to him be vertew of Chriſtꝭ paſſioun applyit to ye ſeik perſone be this vncting.

The promis of mercy &amp; grace quhairapon ye word of this ſacrament is groundit, is playnely expremit quhen he ſais: The prayar of faith ſal ſaif the ſeik perſone, and gif he be in ſynnis, yai ſal be forgeuin to him. quhilk promis wtout dout was maid be our ſaluiour, &amp; promulgat &amp; ſet furth be ſanct Iames. It is to be thocht,Iaco. 5. yat ſanct Iames the Apoſtil of Ieſus Chriſt wald ſet furth na thing belangand to our faith and ſacramētis by the will and command of Chriſt. The element or ſenſibil thing of this ſacrament is ſanctifyit oyle, quhilk trewly is a conuenient mattir of this ſacrament. For as the doctor Theophilactus ſais: Oyle hes a vertew to heile a mā in his body, &amp; to mak him blith in his mind, oyle is the nuriſchment of lycht. It is profitabil aganis gret labouris of the body,The frutis and effectis of this ſacrament &amp; mittigatis the ȝaicking of ye mēbris. Al thir propirteis of oyle ar cōuenient to declare ye vertew &amp; effect of yis ſacrament. The principal effect of it is remiſſioun of venial ſynnis. The ſecund is ſpiritual blythnes of our mind, kennand that we haue gottin all helpis and remeidis, quhilk ar neceſſarie &amp; profitabil for the help of our ſaule aganis all the perrillis that may occur to vs in tyme of our dede, and ſa we cōſaue ane ſingular and conſtant hoip in the mercy of God, in the ſpecial protectioun &amp; defence of our ſaluiour, we trow ſickerly yat the angels of God ſall be aſſiſtent and preſent with vs, to defend vs aganis the powar of all the deuillis of hel.

The thrid effect of this ſacrament, is that God almychty (gif he think expedient to vs for the weil of our ſaule) be ye vertew of yis ſacrament, ſal deliuir vs fra our bodyly ſeiknes and reſtore vs agane to heil, quhilk he dois to mony &amp; ſyndry ſeik perſonis yat reſſauis this ſacrament.

The vthir is, that ye ordinatioun of miniſtaris in the kirk of god, belangis to the biſchoppis allanerly, &amp; nocht to the cōmon pepil.
                  Fourtly ȝe ſall vnderſtand that becauſe the ſacrament of Ordour is ordanit to ye cōuenient diſpēſatioun &amp; miniſtratioun of the ſacramētis, and of all ye ſacramentis, the haly &amp; bliſſit ſacrament of the Altar is maiſt principal, maiſt excellent and maiſt precious, thairfor the ſacrament of Ordour and namely preiſtheid is principally inſtitute and ordanit to conſecrat the ſacrament of the Altar, &amp; to diſpens and miniſter the ſame conueniently to the chriſtin pepil.

And ſecundly to teiche the pepil the word of God,To prech the vvord of God. ſa mekil as it is neceſſarie to thame to knaw, for thair eternal ſaluatioun, For as it is writtin:

coupil or coniunctioun of ane haly, luffand and freindly fellowſchip betwene man and woman, The man to rewle, and the woman to be rewlit and obey the man, thairfor God ſaid: Faciamus ei adiutorium ſimile ſibi. Lat vs mak to man ane help, lyk to himſelf. The ſecund cauſe was generatioun &amp; educatioun of barnis to the ſeruice of God. Thairfor God ſaid:Gene. 1. 
                     Creſcite et multiplicamini et replete terrā. Grow and be multiplyit and fil the erd. The thrid cauſe of Matrimony was eftir the fall of Adam, to eſchaip the ſyn of fornicatioun quhen men hes nocht the gift of chaſtitie, and to vſe the pleſure of the body in the honeſtie of mariage. Thairfor ſanct Paule ſais: Propter fornicationem vnuſquiſ

                           que
                         ſuum virū habeat.
                     i. Cor. 7. To eſchaip fornicatioun (quhen men hes nocht the gift of chaſtitie and hes na lawful impediment) lat ilk mā haue his awin wyfe, and ilk a woman haue hir awin huſband. The fourt principal cauſe of matrimonye was that it mycht be ane figure or takin of ye maiſt haly &amp; beluffit coniunctioun that was to be betwene Chriſt to cum and the kirk, quhilk coniunctioun was forſein &amp; preordinate of God before the beginning of ye warld, according as ſanct Paule ſais:Ephe. 1. 
                     Qui elegit nos in ipſo ante mundi conſtitutionem. God the eternal father hes choſin vs in Chriſt Ieſu before the beginning of ye warld. And doutles matrimony is ane ſacrament, that is to ſay, ane haly ſigne or takin of ye ſame coniunctioun that is betwene

Chriſt &amp; his kirk. For as be the firſt inſtitutioun of matrimonie ane huſband is ioynit to ane wyfe, with ane band of fellowſchip inſeparabil till dede depart yame, ſa the ſonne of God Ieſus Chriſt as ane ſpiritual huſband, &amp; the hail vniuerſal congregatioun of faithfull men &amp; wemen as ane ſpiritual wyfe, ar couplit &amp; ioynit togidder wt ane inſeperabil bād of faith.Ephe. 5. Thairfor S. Paul ſais ſpek and of ye band of matrimonie. Sacramentum hoc magnū eſt, ego autē dico in Chriſto et in eccleſia. Matrimonye is ane gret ſacrament, bot I ſay in Chriſt and in the kirk. And ſuppoſe matrimonye was ordanit to ſa ſtrait &amp; inſeperabil cōiunctioun of a mā &amp; a woman, ȝit eftir the fal of Adame in the tyme of the law of nature &amp; alſo writtin,Hovv the perfection of matrimony vvas degenerat matrimonye fell fra that perfectioun &amp; was degenerat in twa pointis fra ye firſt inſtitution. For ane mā maryit mony wyffes, &amp; ſumtyme a mā haffand diſpleſure at his wife wald geue to hir a libel of partiſing &amp; put hir fra him &amp; lowſe ye band of matrimonye. The firſt of yir twa pointis, quhilk is yat a mā mycht haue ſyndry wyffis, ſpecially ye haly Patriarchis &amp; kingis, as Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Dauid, with the laif. It was lauchful be the ſecret diſpenſatioun of God, for twa reaſonis, the tane is miſtik, to be ane figure yat the ſonne of God Ieſus Chriſt ſuld cowpil to him ſelf be the ſpiritual matrimonye of faith bayth ane congregatioun of Iewis, and alſo ane congregatioun of Gentillis, to be to him ane halye kirk. The vthir reaſone is litteral, that twa mycht multiply the pepil of Iſrael, quhilk was the choſin pepil of God, amang quhom and of

quhom the ſonne of God was to be incarnate. And as for the ſecund point quhilk was partiſing, Moſes tholit it to be vſit, becauſe of the hardnes of yair hartis, for yair was amang thame mony ſtyf neckit proud and malicious men to thair wyffis, and for ane litil diſpleſure was reddye to ſlay thair wyffis. Thairfor to keip thame fra the gretar ſyn, quhilk was ſlaying of thair wyffis, he tholit thame to commit the les ſyn, quhilk was partiſing wt yair wyffis Bot quhen the tyme of grace was cum, quhairin it pleſit the father eternal to reſtore be his ſonne our ſaluiour thai thingis that was in heuin and erd, he reſtorit alſo matrimonye to the perfectioun of the firſt inſtitutioun. Thairfor he ſais:Math. 19. Vovv our ſaluiour is ſtorit matrimonye to the firſt inſtitution. 
                     Qui fecit hominem ab initio, maſculum et feminam fecit eos deus, et dixit. Propter hoc dimittet homo patrem &amp; matrem, et adhaerebit vxori ſue, et erunt duo in carne vna. Ita

Bot I ſay to ȝow: quhaſaeuir puttis away his wyfe (except it be for fornicatioun) and maryis ane vthir, breikis matrimonye, and quhaſaeuir maryis hir yat is deuorſit, cōmittis adultery. Thir wordis of our ſaluiour ar expounit be his diſcipil and Apoſtil ſanct Paule, ſayand: Iis qui matrimonio iuncti ſunt, precipio nō ego,

                     ſed dominus vxorem a viro non diſcedere, ꝙ ſi diſceſſerit, manere innuptam, aut viro ſuo reconciliari. To thame that ar maryit lawfully, command nocht I bot our Lord, yat the wyfe depart nocht fra hir huſband, bot and gifſche depart fra him, lat hir remane vnmaryit with ane vthir man,Tvva ſingular conditiouns of the mariage that is amang chriſtin men and vvemen.

                        . Cor. 7. or ellis to be recounſelit agane to hir awin huſband. Of thir auctoriteis quhilk we haue alledgit to ȝow of our ſaluiour &amp; ſanct Paule, we may gaddir twa ſingular conditiouns of that mariage, quhilk is amang chriſtin men. The ane is, that matrimonye is allanerly betwene twa perſonis, that is ſay, a man and a woman, ſa yat it is nocht lawful for a man to haue may wyffis than ane at anis: Erunt duo in carn
                           •
                         vna. Thai ſall be twa perſonis in a fleſche, quhilk may be cōfirmit be the wordis of ſanct Paule: Mulier poteſtatem corporis ſui nō habet, ſed vir, ſimiliter et vir poteſtatem corporis ſui non habet, ſed mulier. The woman hes nocht powar of hir bodye, bot hir huſband, and lykwiſe the man hes noch
                        •
                      powar of his body, bot the woman hes it. Sa it followis yat the man can nocht geue the powar of his body, to may than ane. And quhē our ſaluiour ſaid Quhaſaeuir puttis away his wife (except for fornicatioun)

and maryis ane vthir, he cōmittis adulterie, he teichis plainly, that a man may nocht haue twa wyffis. For and gif it war lawfull to haue twa wyffis at anis, that mā cōmittit nocht adultery in mariage of ane vthir, his firſt beand alyue. Now our ſaluiour ſais plainly, yat quhē he maryis ane vthir, ſche beand alyue, he committis adultery. The ſecund cōditioun, is yat the band of matrimonie anis lauchfully cōtrackit, may nocht be diſſoluit and lowſit agane be ony diuorcement or partiſing, bot allanerly it is lowſit be the dede of the ane of thame, for trewly the partiſing &amp; deuorſing, quhilk our ſaluiour ſais may be done for fornicatioun, ſuld be vnderſtād allanerly of partiſing fra bed &amp; borde, &amp; nocht fra ye band of matrimony, as it is plain be the wordis of S. Paule, quhilk ſais, Lat hir be recounſalit agane to hir huſband. And in the meane tyme quhaſaeuir maryis hir, he cōmittis adultery. It is to be notit alſo, that for the ſame twa ſingular conditiouns afore reherſit, matrimonye may weil be callit a ſacrament, That is to ſay, a takin or ſigne of ane haly thing, quhilk is coniunctioun of haly kirk with Chriſt Ieſu. For as in matrimonye ane mā hes bot ane wyfe with quhom he ſuld remane without ony partiſing, ſa Chriſt Ieſus hes cowplit to him ſelf ye vniuerſal kirk of chriſtin men and wemen as ane ſpiritual wyfe, and will neuir parte fra hir, bot will be ioynit with hir euir, heir be grace and in heuin be glore.

For as the wiſman ſais:Eccle. 17.

Oriſone is eleuatioun of our myndis to God, cōtēplation of his diuine maieſtie and remembrance of his benefitis. Petitioun is quhen we aſk at God ony thing to vs neceſſare. Geuing of thākis, is to loif god, to thāk

Sa it is in this caſe, the king of heuin hes ſend to vs ane excellent preſent and precious gift, quhen he ſend his ſonne to be incarnat for vs, the meſſingeir, quhilk hes deliuerit this gift to vs, is the glorious virgine Marie, quhilk now is in the glore of heuin, and miſteris nane of our rewardis. Quhat is than our dewtie, be quhilk we ar bund to ſchaw our gratitude, bot to loue the virgine Marie honour hir, thank hir, that ſcho hes brocht to vs ſa precious a preſand &amp; ſa nobil a gift, quhilk we do, quhen we ſay to hir deuoitly &amp; reuerently: Aue Maria, gr̄a plena, dominus tecum. &amp;c.

The ſecund effect of grace, quhilk was geuin to the glorious virgin, is exponit be ſanct Hierome in ane ſermon quhilk he makis apon the Aſſumptioun of the glorious virgin, ſayand thus: The virgin Mari may weil be callit full of grace, for to the laif of ſanctis, grace was geuin be partis, bot to the virgin Mary the hail fulnes of grace was geuin.

Ȝe trewly, the glorious virgine is bliſſit abone all wemen, and thairfor to be honourit, louit &amp; magnifyit abone all wemen, for as mekil as yat all the maledictioun, quhilk come apon vs be Eua, is takin away be the benedictioun geuin to Marie.

And thai expone the wordis yat gangis afore, as gif thow wald ſay, quhat is the cauſe that the halye virgin Marie is bliſſit abone all wemen? It is anſwerit thus, becauſe that the fruit of hir wambe, quhilk is Ieſus Chriſt the

In auld tyme yair was ſyndry haly wemen yat buir barnis, quhilk eftir hend was haly men, bot nane of yame al was borne, or at the leiſt conſauit wtout ſyn. The fruit of ye glorious virgin was allanerly bliſſit, eftir ſa excellent a maner, that nother he was borne nor conſauit in ſyn, bot alſo it was impoſſibil yt he mycht be cō
                     ſauit &amp; borne in ſyn, becauſe he is baith God &amp; man. He bliſſit the cōceptioun of his mother the virgin Marie, quhen he p̄ſeruit hir fra original ſyn.

The ſecund, for quhom we ſuld pray? Anſweir to ye firſt queſtioun ſtandis in thre veriteis. The firſt is, we ſuld pray to almychty god, to geue vs his grace, his help or giftis till vs neceſſary &amp; profitabil. For it is God only yat be

his awin propir powar &amp; vertew, giffis grace &amp; all gud to vs neceſſare, ſpiritual &amp; eternal, according as S. Iames ſais:Iaco. i. 
                  Omne darū optimum et omne donum perfectū, deſurſum eſt deſcendens a patre luminū. All gud giftis &amp; all perfit giftis, is fra abone deſcendand &amp; cūand fra ye father of lycht. And that he is the giffar of all tēporal guddis, the prophet in the Pſalme teſtifyis ſayand: Oculi

To god yairfor allanerly we ſuld pray as giffar of all gudnes. The ſecund is this, we ſuld pray to gud men and wemen leiffand heir in this walrd, deſirand thame to pray for vs to God, yat be yair prayaris we may obtene the grace &amp; help of god. Ane ſtorie of yis we haue in the buke of Geneſis, quhen almychty God had repreiffit Abimelech the king of Geraris, for taking to him Abrahams wife, callit Sara.Gene▪

Quhen ye king had reſtorit agane Sara til Abrahā hir huſbād, Abrahā maid his prayar to God, for the king and all his houſe, then God almychty helit Abimelechis wyfe and all hir wemen, quhilk be the punitioun of God, was maid barrat and vnabil to conſaue and beir barnis.

Now ſen god almychty bad Abimalech require Abraham to praye for him, quhy ſuld nocht we likwais deſire gud men &amp; wemen to pray to god for vs? And ſiclik exempil we reid in the buke of Iob,Iob. 42. yat his thre freindis diſputand lang tyme with him, and in yair diſputatioun yai offendit God, quhairfor God gef thame cōmand to gāg to Iob &amp; require him to pray for thame to God, that be Iobs prayar the ſame thre men mycht eſchaip the punitioun of God.

Gyf a man big apon this foundatioun (I mene the faith of our ſaluiour) gold, ſiluir, precious ſtanis, treis, hay or ſtybbil, the warke of ilk man ſall be ſchawin. For the day of our Lord ſall declare, quhilk ſall be ſchawin in fyre. And the warke of ilk man, quhat it is ye fyre ſall trie or preif.

                     um quhair he exponis ye forſaid wordis of ſanct Paule on this maner: Multi ſunt, qui lectionem iſtam male intelligentes, falſa decipiuntur ſecuritate, dum credunt, quod ſi ſupra fundamentum Chriſtū capitalia crimina edificent, peccata ipſa per trāſitorium ignē purgari, et ipſos poſtea ad vitā perpetuam puenire.

                  And a litil eftirhend he ſais thus: Illo enim tranſitorio igne, de quo dixit Apſtolus: ipſe enim ſaluus erit ſic tamen quaſi per ignē, non capitalia, ſed minuta peccata purgantur. Quicquid enim a nobis de iſtis peccatis redemptū non fuerit, illo igne purgā
                     dum eſt de quo dixit Apoſtolus: Quia in igne reuelabitur, &amp; cuius opus arſerit (hoc eſt cremabile erit) detrimentum patietur. For trewly (ſais ſanct Auguſtine) with that tranſitorie fyre, quhairof S. Paule ſaid, that he ſall be ſaiffit euin as it war be ane fyre, nocht dedlie ſynnis, bot ſmale ſynnis ar purgit. For quhat ſa

Heir thow hes O chriſtin man ye auctoritie of ſanct Paule ſchortly and cleirly exponit of Purgatorie to be tholit eftir yis lyfe, &amp; yat thow hes ſa exponit be ſanct Auguſtine, ane of the maiſt excellent and catholik doctouris yat was euir in the kirk of God.

For quhem our mother ye kirk offeris deuoitly to god ſacrifice &amp; vthir giftis. In the expoſitioun of this auncient &amp; catholyk doctour thow may leir thre leſſonis: Firſt yat the fyre quhairof S.

homo vtrum amore vel odio dignus ſit, ſed oīa in futurum ſeruantur incerta. In the tyme of this lyfe man knawis nocht certanely quhidder he is worthi the lufe or hettrand of God, bot all thingis ar kepit vncertane till the warld to cum. The ſecund word of ſ. Paule is this: Dies dn̄ideclarabit. The day of our Lord ſall declare. Quhat is that day of our Lord? Trewly eftir ye mynd of Anſelmus wt vthir doctors, the day of our Lord in ye ſcripture propirly is callit the day of Gods iudgement, nocht denyand bot yat al the dais of this preſent lyfe ar the dais of our Lord, for als mekil as he giffis thame to vs, &amp; be his ordinatioun that all proceid according as the prophet ſais in the Pſalme:Pſal. 118.

Quhat is callit mānis day? Trewly ye day quhairin man takis his pleſour aganis ye pleſour of God, quhairin man dois his awin will contrarie to ye will of God.
