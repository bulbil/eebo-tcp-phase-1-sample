            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            TO THE RIGHT
HONORABLE, SIR
Robert Cecill Knight, principall Secretarie
to her Maieſtie, Maſter of the Court of
VVards and Liueries, the woorthy Chancellour of
the Vniuerſitie of Cambridge, and one of
her Maieſties moſt honorable
priuie Counſell.
            
               RIght Honorable, while I went
about to publiſh our Engliſh
Voyages and Diſcoueries, I
was aduiſed by maſter WALTER
COPE, a gentleman of
rare and excellent parts, to
draw them into a ſhort ſum,
adding that in his opinion
that courſe woulde prooue
moſt acceptable to the world,
eſpecially to men of great action and employment. Although
in that worke then vnder the preſſe I could not
conueniently alter my courſe, yet holding his aduiſe, as in
many things elſe, ſo in this for ſound and very good,
I heere preſent vnto your Honour a briefe Treatie
moſt agreeable to the ſame. The authour whereof was

one Antonie Galuano, a Portugall gentleman: of whoſe
pietie towards God, equitie towards men, fidelity to his
Prince, loue to his countrey, skill in ſea cauſes, experience
in Hiſtories, liberalitie towards his nation, vigilance,
valour, wiſedome and diligence in reſtoring &amp; ſetling
the decaied ſtate of The Iſles of Maluco, (where he
remained ſixe or ſeuen yeeres gouernour,) if it pleaſe
your Honour to read Fernando Lopez de Castagneda, or
Ioannes Maffeius in their Hiſtories of The Eaſt Indies,
you ſhall finde more written in his ſingular commendation,
then a large Epiſtle can well comprehend.
            The worke though ſ
                  •
               all in bulke containeth ſo
much rare and profitable matter, as I know not where to
ſeeke the like, within ſo narrow and ſtreite a compaſſe.
For heerein is orderly declared, who were The firſt Diſcouerours
of the world ſince the time of the flood: by
what waies from age to age the ſpicerie, drugs, and riches
of the Eaſt were conueied into The Weſt: what were the
cauſes of the alterations of thoſe courſes, as namely the
changes of Empires and gouernments: The ceaſing of
all trafficke for many yeeres by The Gothes inuaſion of
the Romane Empire: The riſing vp of The Mahumetane
ſect; with their ouerrunning of Afrike and Spaine: The
renewing againe, after many yeeres diſturbance, of the
trafficke and entercourſe of The Eaſt Indies; firſt by the
Califas of the aforeſaid ſect: and eftſoones by The Venetians,
Ienowais and Florentines. Then followeth the taking
of Ceuta in Barbarie by Iohn the firſt king of Portugall
of that name in the yeere of our Lord 1415. whoſe
third ſonne Don Henry (which he had by the vertuous Ladie
Philippa, daughter of Iohn of Gante, and ſiſter to Henry
the fourth, king of England) was the firſt beginner of all
the Portugall diſcoueries, and continued the ſame for the
ſpace of fortie and three yeeres euen to his dying day.

By whoſe encouragement the kings of Portugall found
out with much patience and conſtancie the laſt way of
the bringing the Spicerie into Europe by The Cape of
Buona Sperança; and for theſe hundred yeeres paſt haue
become the chiefe Lords of the riches of the Orient By
emulation of which their good endeuours, The Antiles
and The weſt Indies began to be diſcouered by The kings
of Spaine. The infancies of both which moſt important
enterpriſes, The progreſſe of the ſame from time to time,
the diſcoueries of Iſlands, riuers, baies and harbours, of
many rich prouinces, kingdomes, and countries; The
erecting of caſtles in ſundry conuenient Iſlands and places,
with the drawing of trafficke vnto the ſame, where,
when, by whom, and by whoſe authority is heere ſuccinctly
and faithfully recorded. So that if it pleaſe your Honour
at your conuenient leiſure to take a ſea card or a
mappe of the world, and carie your eie vpon the coaſt of
Africa from Cape de Non, lying on the mayne in 29.
degrees of northerly latitude, and follow the ſhore about
the Cape of Buona Sperança till you come to the mouth
of The Redde Sea, and paſſing thence along by the countrey
of Arabia croſſe ouer to India, and doubling Cape
Comory compaſſe the gulfe of Bengala, &amp; ſhooting by
the citie of Malacca through The ſtreite of Cincapura,
coaſt al the ſouth of Aſia to the northeaſt part of China,
and comprehend in this view all the Iſlands from The
Açores and Madera in the Weſt, to The Malucoes,
The Philippinas, and Iapan in the Eaſt: you ſhall heere
finde by order, who were the firſt diſcouerours, conquerours
and planters in euery place: as alſo the natures
and commodities of the ſoyles, togither with the forces,
qualities, and conditions of the inhabitants. And that
which I mention of the Orient, is likewiſe to be vnderſtood
of The Occident.
            
               
Now touching the tranſlation, it may pleaſe you ſir, to
be aduertiſed that it was firſt done into our language by
ſome honeſt and well affected marchant of our nation,
whoſe name by no meanes I could attaine vnto, and
that as it ſeemeth many yeeres ago. For it hath lien by
me aboue theſe twelue yeeres. In all which ſpace though
I haue made much inquirie, and ſent to Lisbon, where
it ſeemeth it was printed, yet to this day I could neuer
obtaine the originall copie; whereby I might reforme
the manifold errours of the tranſlator. For whereas a
good tranſlator ought to be well acquainted with the
proprietie of the tongue out of which, and of that into
which he tranſlateth, and thirdly with the ſubiect or matter
it ſelfe: I found this tranſlator very defectiue in all
three; eſpecially in the laſt. For the ſupplying of whoſe
defects I had none other remedie, but to haue recourſe
vnto the originall hiſtories, (which as it appeereth are
very many, and many of them exceeding rare and hard
to come by) out of which the authour himſelfe drew the
greateſt part of this diſcourſe. And in very deede it coſt
me more trauaile to ſearch out the grounds thereof, and
to annexe the marginall quotations vnto the worke, then
the tranſlation of many ſuch bookes would haue put me
vnto. Of which quotations there is yet a farther vſe; to
wit, that ſuch as haue leaſure ſufficient, and are deſirous to
reade theſe things more at large, (for breuitie oftentimes
breedeth obſcuritie) may fully ſatisfie their deſires by hauing
recourſe by the helpe therof to the pure fountaines,
out of which thoſe waters which are drawne are for the
moſt part moſt ſweete and holſome. Now if any man
ſhall maruel, that in theſe Diſcoueries of The World for the

                  •
               pace almoſt of fower thouſand yeeres here ſet downe,
our nation is ſcarce fower times mentioned: Hee is to
vnderſtand, that when this authour ended this diſcourſe,

(which was about the yeere of Grace 1555.) there was
little extant of our mens trauailes. And for ought I can
ſee, there had no great matter yet come to light, if my
ſelfe had not vndertaken that heauie burden, being neuer
therein entertained to any purpoſe, vntill I had recourſe
vnto your ſelfe, by whoſe ſpeciall fauour and bountifull
patronage I haue been often much encouraged, and as it
were reuiued. Which trauailes of our men, becauſe as
yet they be not come to ripenes, and haue been made for
the moſt part to places firſt diſcouered by others; when
they ſhall come to more perfection, and become more
profitable to the aduenturers, will then be more fit to be
reduced into briefe epitomes, by my ſelfe or ſome other
endued with an honeſt zeale of the honour of our countrey.
In the meane ſeaſon nothing doubting of your fauourable
acceptation of this my labour, I humbly beſeech
the authour of all goodnes to repleniſh and enrich you
with his beſt bleſſings, long to protect and preſerue your
Honour to the profitable ſeruice of her Maieſtie,
and to the common benefit and good
of the Realme. From London
this 29. of October
1061.
            
               Your Honors Chaplein, in all dutie
moſt readie to be commanded,

                  ANtonie Galuano vpon his death bed
left vnto me in his teſtament among
his papers this booke. And becauſe
I am certaine he ordained it to bee
preſented vnto your Grace, I haue
thought good herein to fulfill his wil
&amp; teſtament, though in other things
I haue done nothing, the fault remaining not in me. And
by all reaſon this treatie ought to be ſet foorth by a Portugall,
ſeeing it intreateth of the variable waies from
whence the pepper and ſpices came in times paſt into
our partes, and alſo of all the nauigations and diſcoueries
in the old time: In both of which things the Portugals
haue moſt trauailed. In this treatie and in nine or ten
bookes of things touching Maluco and India (which the
Cardinall willed me to giue to Damian de Goes, ſaying
that he ſhould content me, for otherwiſe I could not deliuer
them) this true Portugall occupied himſelfe againſt
the vnfortunate and ſorrow
                  •
               ull times which he had been
in (which were all ended before all our daies and times:)Antonie Galuano Captaine of Maluco.
for when he receiued the captainſhip and fortreſſes of
Maluco, all the kings and gouernours of all the Ilands
about being agreed to make war againſt the Portugals,
vntill ſuch time as they might driue them all out of the
countrey, he fought againſt them all▪ with onely 130. Portugals,
when they were all together, and ſtrong in Tidore;
and he gaue them the ouerthrow and killed their king, and
one 
                  
                     •
                  ernate, the principal author of that war, and he tooke

from them their fortreſſe: ſo vpon this victorie they ſubmitted
themſelues, and came vnder the obeiſance and ſeruice
of our king of Portugall. Herein two things happened
of great admiration▪ The firſt, that all the kings and
gouernours of Maluco agreed togither againſt vs, a thing
that neuer fell out, nor yet credible to be like to happen:
for they are euer at variance among themſelues:Variance vſually amon
                     •
                   the kings of Maluco. The ſecond,
that the captaine of Maluco with onely his ordinarie
ſoldiers ſhould haue the victorie againſt ſo many being
all together. For ſometimes it happeneth that ſome
of the captaines of Maluco with many extraordinarie
ſoldiers beſides their ordinarie, yea and with the aide of
al the Kings and Lords of Maluco in their fauour and aide
went againſt one King onely of them, and came backe
againe with loſſe. So there may be reckoned three notable
things done in India, I ſay of qualitie: (but of more quantitie
 and importance there haue been others:) which were
 the taking of Muar by Emmanuel Falcon, and the winning
 of Bitam by Peter Maſcarenas, and this, whereof we preſently
treate. For all theſe three deedes ſeemed to be impoſſible
to be atchieued, conſidering the ſmall quantitie
of ſoldiers which the captaines had in giuing the enterpriſe
againſt ſo many; with the order and maner by them
ordained how and which waies to obtaine their purpoſe
as well by their enimies as by themſelues. And they could
not be atchieued otherwiſe but by vſing a meane and order
not thought of at the firſt by the Portugals, nor yet
euer ſuſpected by their enimies. And, beſides this, his father
and fower of his brethren were all ſlaine in the kings
ſeruice: And he now being the laſt of his linage, caried
with him into Maluco woorth ten thouſand cruſadoes,
which he ſpent not in idlenes, nor yet in play, but onely in
bringing of many kings and innumerable townes vnto
our holy faith, and in the preſeruing of Maluco, employing
all his power and ſtrength that all the cloues might

come vnto the hands of the kings highnes: which with
Maluco yeelded vnto him euery yeere fiue hundred thouſand
cruſadoes; being all to his great preiudice, let, and
hinderance. For if he had gathered cloues for himſelfe,
as the captaines of Maluco haue done and doe, then he
had come home very rich. But when he came home into
Portugall in great hope (ſuch is the ſimplicitie of the
beſt natures) to be rewarded for his good ſeruice,Good ſeruice full ill rewarded. and to
be more fauoured and honored, then if he had brought
home with him an hundred thouſand cruſadoes, he was
greatly deceiued. For he found neither fauour, nor yet honor,
but onely among the poore and miſerable, to wit, in
an hoſpitall: where he was kept ſeuenteene yeeres vntill
the hower of his death; and there he had allowed vnto
him his winding ſheete to burie him in: and the brotherhood
of the Couent prepared for his buriall as for a
poore courtier caſt off by all men, leauing himſelfe indebted
in two thouſand cruſadoes, whereof part came out of
India, and part thereof many of his friends had lent him
to maintaine him in the hoſpitall: for in all theſe ſeuenteene
yeeres he had not of his highnes for to helpe himſelfe
with ſo much as one riall of plate, nor yet I of the
bookes which I deliuered receiued any thing to diſcharge
his will with. Yet for all this, euen as vpon the proſperitie
of his victories he neuer made any boaſt, ſo likewiſe in his
aduerſities his great ſtomacke did nothing abate his hart.
As there are good proofes that with ſo many and ſo continuall
diſgraces as he ſuffered, he neuer vnto the hower
of his death left off to raiſe and to augment the yeerely
rent vnto a Counto:A Counto is 50000. cruſadoes. which ſome made ſtrange and would
not giue eare vnto: So that euen as he was extreme painfull
in the performance of his ſeruice, ſo he was the like
in the things ſounding vnto the perfecting of the ſame,
which was the cauſe that he was brought vnto the ſtate
that he died in. For he could not ſee the qualitie of the

time, but onely thoſe of his great ſeruice, by reaſon of the
great charges that it ſtood him in. And his ſaying was,
That he was borne, not for to ſay that his conſtellation
was in the wars victorious, but in the ouercomming of
kings by the arte of warfare, readines in reſoluing, prudence
in conſeruing, and great loialtie and patience with
many ſeruices vnto his king and maſter. In which of all
theſe he had moſt contentation it cannot eaſily be determined.
Wherefore your noble Grace may ſee, that this
treatie and the others were made with ſighes and afflictions
which his inferiour will might haue raiſed vp in him
againſt his ſuperiour reaſon. Neither was he willing to
take for his remedie that which that great Turke Zelim
ſonne to the great Mahumet did, (for he tooke Conſtantinople
and died in Rome) who vſed to make himſelfe
drunke, becauſe he would not remember the great eſtate
which he loſt: nor yet woulde he giue eare vnto thoſe
things which many of his friends would tell him, wiſhing
he would ſettle his mind out of the kingdome: (for otherwiſe
he ſhould neuer be able to liue:) whereunto he anſwered,
that in this point he would rather be compared
vnto the great Timocles the Athenian,Or rather Themistocles. then to be like the
excellent Romane Coriolanus. Which is a goodly example
of a true and faithfull Portugall. (Though it were not
ſo as I doe ſay, yet I doe heare, that the hoſpitals be full of
the moſt faithfull ſubiects to their prince and countrey.)
Wherefore by all reaſon this treatie ought to be of your
Grace fauoured, ſetting apart all ouerſights, if there be
any, in this worke, of the author: I being not able to
attaine vnto the vnderſtanding of the contrary.
God proſper your Grace with
long life and increaſe of
honour.

               WHile I had a deſire to gather together
ſome olde and ſome new
diſcoueries, which haue béene
made by ſea and by land, with
their iuſt times and ſituations;
they ſéemed to be two things of
ſo great difficultie, that being
cōfuſed in the authors of them,
I determined once to deſiſt frō
any ſuch purpoſe. For touching

declare, that from the beginning of the world to the flood were
1656. yéeres. The Seuentie Interpreters make mention of

                  0. And S. Auguſtine reckoneth 2262. In the ſituations
likewiſe there be many differences. For there neuer ſailed
together in one fleete at ſea from ten pilots to the number of
100. but that ſome of them found themſelues by reckoning
in one longitude and other ſome in another. But conſidering
better with my ſelfe, that the difficulties are open
                  •
               o, and the
differences amended by others of more exact iudgement and
vnderſtanding therein, I purpoſed notwithſtanding to procéede
in this worke of Diſcoueries.
            
            Some there be that ſay, that the world hath fully béene
diſcouered: and they alleage this reaſon, that as it hath b

               ene

peopled and inhabited, ſo it might be frequented, and nauigable,
and the rather for that the men in that age were of a
longer life, and of lawes and languages almoſt one.
            There be others of a contrarie opinion to this,Contrarie opinions touching the diſcouerie of the world. holding
that all the earth could not be knowne, nor the people conuerſant
one with another. For though it had béene ſo once,
yet the ſame would haue beene loſt againe by the malice of
men, and the want of iuſtice among the inhabitants of the
earth. But bicauſe the beſt and moſt famous diſcoueries were
made by ſea,Who were the firſt diſcouerers ſince the flood. and that principally in our times, I deſire to
knowe, who were the firſt Diſcouerers ſince the time of the
flood.
            
            Some affirme that they were the Gréekes, others ſay, the
Phoenicians, others alſo the Egyptians. The people of India
agrée not hereunto; affirming that they were the firſt that
ſailed by ſea: namely theThe people of China ſay they were the firſt ſailers by ſea. 
               Tabencos, which now we call the
Chinois. And they alleage for the proofe of this, that they be
ye Lords of the Indiaes euen vnto the Cape of Bona Sperança,
&amp; the iſland of S. Laurence, which is inhabited by them▪ and al
along the ſea; as alſo the Iauaes, Timores, Celebes, Maca

                  ares,
Malucos, Borneos, Mindanaos, Luçones, Lequeos, Iapones,
and other Iſlands being many in number, and the firme
lands of Cauchin-China, Laos, Bramas, Pegu, Arracones, till
you come vnto Bengala:
               The inhabitants of the Weſt Indies deſcended from China. And beſides this, New Spaine, Peru,
Braſill, the Antiles, with the reſt adioining vnto them, as appéereth
by the faſhions and maners of the men and women,
and by their proportions, hauing ſmall eies, flat noſes, with
other proportions to be ſeene. And to this day many of theſe
Ilands and countreies are called by the names of B

                  tochina,
Bocho-China, which is as much to ſay, as the countreies of
China. Further it appeereth by hiſtories, that the arke of Noe
reſted vpon the north parts of the mountaines of Armenia,
which ſtands in 40. degrées and vpwards: and that immediately
thereupon Scythia was firſt peopled, for that it is an
high land, and appéered firſt after the flood. And ſéeing the prouince
and countrey of the Taben
                     •
                  os is one of the chiefeſt of
all Tartarie, as they report, it is to be thought that they were
of the moſt ancient inhabitants,The ſeas betweene the Tropicks very calm. and men of the moſt ancient
nauigations, the ſeas being as calme as the riuers be in thoſe
parts lying betwéene the Tropicks, where the daies and

nights do not much differ, as well in the howers, as in ye temperature:
where there blow no outragious windes, to cauſe
the waters to riſe or to be troubled. And by late experience it
is ſound,An high bough in ſteed of maſt and ſaile. that the ſmall barks wherein they ſaile haue onely
a great high bough in the middeſt of the barke, ſtanding in
ſteed both of maſt and ſaile, and the maſter holdeth onely an

along the coaſt; and the reſt of the paſſengers ſit onely vpon
certaine poles, which are faſtened in the barke, which they
call Catamarones, and ſo they paſſe without rowing.
            It is further ſaid, that the people of China were ſomtimes
Lords of the moſt part of Scythia, and ſailed ordinarily along
that coaſt, which ſéemeth to reach vnto 70. degrées toward
the north.Pomponius Mela lib. 3. 
               Cornelius Nepos is the author of this; who particularly
affirmeth,Plinius lib. 2. cap 67. that in the time that Metellus the fellowe
Conſul of Afranius, was Proconſul in France, the king of
Sue
                     •
                  ia ſent vnto him certaine Indians, which came thither
in a ſhip from this countrey, comming by the north and by
the flats of Germanie. And it is probable that they were people
of China, for that they from 20. 30. and 40. degrees vpwards
haue ſtrong ſhips and clynchers, that can well brooke
the ſeas, and indure the cold and intemperature of ſuch northerly
regions. As for Cambaia there is ſhipping alſo in it,
and the people by report haue vſed the ſeas many yéeres:
but it ſeemeth not that they were any of them which came
into France: for that they trafficke onely to Cairo, and are
men in déed of little trafficke and leſſe clothing.
            As for thoſe which eſcaped the deſtruction of the flood,Ioſeph. Antiouit. Iudai
                     •
                   lib. 1. ca. 5. they
were therewith ſo amazed, that they durſt not deſcend into
the plaines and lowe countreies, but kept the hils. And we
reade of Nimrode, who 130. yéeres after the flood built the
Tower of Babell, intending thereby to ſaue himſelfe, if there
ſhould come any more ſuch floods.
            Therefore it ſeemeth, that they which firſt came to be ſailers
were thoſe which dwell in the eaſt in the prouince of
China: although others contrariwiſe hold them which dwell
in the weſt as in Syria, to haue vſed the trade of the ſea ſooneſt
after the flood. But this contention about the antiquitie of
nauigation I leaue to the Scythians and Egyptians,Iuſtinus lib. 1. who
were at great variance and difference in this matter; for each

of them chalenged vnto themſelues the honour of the firſt ſea
trauaile. But omitting all iars and differences thereabouts,
I will apply my ſelfe to my purpoſed diſcourſe, and ſpeake of
that which hiſtories haue left in record.
            THere be ſome wel ſéene in Antiquities,Bero
                     •
                  us. which ſay that
in the 143. yéere after the flood,The firſt nauigation after the flood 143. 
               Tubal came by ſea into
Spaine, whereby it ſéemeth that in thoſe times nauigations
were vſed into our parts out of Ethiopia.
            And they alſo ſay farther, that not long after this, the
Quéene Semyramis went againſt the Indians in that riuer
wherof they tooke their name,Diodorus Siculus lib. 2. cap. 5. and therein gaue battaile vnto
the king Stabrobates, wherin he loſt a thouſand ſhips. Which
being credible by the ancient hiſtorie, prooueth manifeſtly
that in thoſe parts, in thoſe times were many ſhips, and the
ſeas frequented in good numbers.
            In the 650. yéere after the flood there was a king in Spaine
named Heſperus,
               Beroſus. who in his time as it is reported went and
diſcouered as far as Cape Verde, &amp; the Iſland of S. Thomas,
whereof he was prince:Gonſaluo Fernandes de Ouiedo lib. 2. cap 3. Generalis H
                     •
                  ſt. And Gonſaluo Fernandes of Ouiedo
the Chronicler of Antiquities affirmeth, that in his time the
Iſlands of the Weſt Indies were diſcouered, and called ſomewhat
after his name He
                     •
                  perides: and he alleageth many
reaſons to prooue it,Plinius lib. 6. cap. 3
                     •
                  . reporting particularly that in 40. daies
they ſailed from Cape Verde vnto thoſe Iſlands.
            There are others that ſay that the like was done from this
Cape vnto the Iſlands of S. Thomas, and the Iſle De Principe,
and that they be the Heſperides, and not the An
                     •
                  iles:
And they doe not differ far from reaſon:The ancient nauigation was along the coaſt, and not far into the maine Ocean. ſeeing in thoſe times
and many yeeres after they did vſe to ſaile onely along the
coaſt, not paſſing through the maine Ocean ſea: for they had
neither altitude nor compaſſe then in vſe, nor any mariners
ſo expert.
            It cannot be denied, but that there were many countries,

               Plato ſaith in his dialogue of Timaeus,
               Plato in Timaeo. that there were in
ancient times in the Ocean ſea Atlanticke certaine great
Iſlands and countries named Atlantides greater then Afrike
and Europe: and that the kings of thoſe parts were Lords of
a great part of this our countrey: but with certaine great
tempeſts the ſea did ouerflow it, and it remained as mud and
ſhingle; ſo that in a long time after no ſhips could paſſe that
way.
            It is alſo recorded in hiſtories,Plinius lib. 4. cap. 22. that faſt by the Iſland of
Cadiz towards the Straights of Gibraltar there was a certaine
Iſland which was called Aphrodiſias, well inhabited
and planted with many gardens and orchards, and yet at
this day we haue no knowledge of this Aphrodiſias, but only
a bare mention of it in ancient authors. The ſaid Iſland of
Cadiz is further ſaid to haue béen ſo large and big, that it did
ioine with the firme land of Spaine.
            The Iſlands of the Açores were ſometimes a point of the
mountaines of Eſtrella,
               The Iſlands of the Açores ſomtimes ioined to the firme land. which ioine vnto the ſea ouer the
towne of Syntra: And alſo from Sierra Verde or the gréene
mountaine, which adioineth vnto the water, hard by the citie
of Saſin in the land of Cucu (which is the ſelfe ſame Iſland of
Mouchin, where Algarbe is) come the Iſlands of Porto Santo
and Madera.
            
            For it is held as a true and vndoubted veritie,All Iſlands haue their rootes running from the maine land. that all
Iſlands haue their roots running from the firme land, though
they be neuer ſo farre from the continent: for otherwiſe they
could not ſtand firme.
            There are other hiſtories which ſay,Eratoſthenes apud Strabonem lib. 1. pag. 26. that from Spaine vnto
Ceuta in Barbarie men ſometimes trauailed on foote vpon
drie land, and that the Iſlands of Sardinia and Corſica did
ioine the one with the other, as alſo did Sicilia with Italie,
and Negroponto with Graecia.
            
            We reade alſo that there were found hulles of ſhips,Huls of ſhips and ankers 
                     •
                  ound on mountaines f

                  rre within land. ankers
of iron, and other memorials of ſhipping vpon the
mountaines of Suſſa farre within the land: where as it
ſeemeth now no ſalt water or ſea euer came.
            In India alſo, and in the land of Malabar, although now
there be great ſtore of people, yet many writers affirme that
it was once a maine ſea vnto the foote of the mountaines; and
that the Cape of Comarim, and the Iſland of Zeilan were all

one thing: As alſo that the Iſland of Samatra did ioine with
the land of Malacca by the flats of Caypaſia; and not farre
frō thence there ſtands now a little Iſland, which few yéeres
paſt was part of the firme land that is ouer againſt it.
            Furthermore it is to be ſéene, how Ptolemey in his tables
dot
                  •
                ſet the land of Malacca to the ſouth of the line in thrée or
fower degrées of latitude, whereas now it is at the point
thereof, being called 
                  
                     •
                  entana, in one degrée on the north ſide,
as appéereth in the Straight of Cincapura, where daily they
doe paſſe through vnto the coaſt of Sian and China, where the
Iſland of Aynan ſtandeth, which alſo they ſay did ioine hard
to the land of China: and Ptolemey placeth it on the north
ſide far from the line, ſtanding now aboue 20. degrées from it
towards the north, as Aſia and Europe now ſtand.
            Well it may be that in time paſt the land of Malacca and
China did end beyond the line on the ſouth ſide, as Ptolemey
doth ſet them foorth: becauſe it might ioine with the point of
the land called 
                  
                     •
                  entana, with the Iſlands of Bi

                  tan, Banca, &amp;
Salitres being many that waies, &amp; the land might be all ſlime
&amp; oaze; And ſo ye point of China, might ioine with the Iſlands
of the Luçones, Borneos, Lequeos, Mindanaos, &amp; others which
ſtand in this parallele: they alſo as yet hauing in opinion that
the Iſland of Samatra did ioine with Iaua by the chanell of
Sunda,
               At this Iſle of Bali the Holla
                     •
                  ders were 1596. and haue largely deſcribed it. and the Iſlands of Bali, Aujaue, çambaua, Solor, Hogaleao,
Maulua, Vintara, Roſalaguin, and others that be in
this parallele and altitude did all ioine with Iaua; and ſo they
ſéeme outwardly to thoſe that deſcrie them. For at this day
the Iſlands ſtand ſo néere the one to the other, that they ſéeme
all but one firme land; and whoſoeuer paſſeth betwéene ſome
of them, may touch with their hand the boughs of the trées on
the one and on the other ſide alſo. And to come néerer to the
matter, it is not long ſince, that in the eaſt the Iſlands of Banda
were diuers of them ouerflowen and drowned by the ſea:
And ſo likewiſe in China about nine ſcore miles of firme
ground is now become a lake,Nine ſcore miles of firme ground lately drowned in China. as it is reported. Which is not
to be thought maruellous; conſidering that which Ptolemey▪
               
and others haue written in ſuch caſes; which here I omit, to
returne to my purpoſe.
            After the flood 800. yéeres we reade that the citie of Troy
was builded by the Dardans; and that before that time they

brought out of the Indies into Europe by the Red ſea,
               800. yeeres after the flood was trade of ſpices by the Red ſea. ſpices,
drugs, and many other kindes of marchandiſes, which were
there more abundant, then now they be. Whereunto if credit
may be giuen, we may conceaue that the ſea was of old haunted
and frequented, ſéeing that then they of the Eaſt had ſo
much and ſo great trafficke with them of the Weſt, that they
brought their marchandiſe vnto an hauen which was named
Arſinoe,
               Arſinoe, now called Suez. being that which at this day is called Suez, ſtanding
in 30. degrées on the north part of the Arabian Gulfe. It
is alſo by authors farther written, that from this hauen of
Arſinoe or Suez,
               Plinius lib. 6. cap. 29. theſe marchandiſes were carried by Carauans
or great companies of carriers vpon camels, aſſes, and
mules, vnto the Leuant ſea vnto a city called Caſſou, ſtanding
on the coaſt in 32. degrées of latitude, yeelding vnto euery
degrée 17. leagues and an halfe, as the maner is. And there
are by account from the one ſea to the other 35. leagues, or
105. miles.Strabo lib. 17. pag. 560. Theſe carriers, by reaſon of the heate of the countrey,
trauailed in the night onely, directing themſelues by
ſtars and by marks of poſtes and canes, which they vſed to
ſticke in the ground as they went. But after that, becauſe this
courſe and iourney had many inconueniences, they changed
and altered the ſame twiſe, to finde out the moſt commodious
way.
            900. yéeres or there about after the flood,900. yeeres after the flood. and before the
deſtruction of Troy,
               Strabo lib. 17. there was a king in Egypt called Seſoſtris,
who perceiuing that the former courſes and paſſages for
the carrying of marchandiſes by men &amp; beaſts, were chargeable
to the one &amp; moſt painfull to the other, prouided to haue a
way or ſtreame cut out of the land from the Red ſea vnto an
arme of the riuer Nilus which rūneth vnto the Citie Heroum;
that by the meanes thereof ſhips might paſſe and repaſſe
with their marchandiſes from India into Europe,
               Plinius lib. 6. cap. 29. and not
be diſcharged till they came into Italie. So that this Seſoſtris
was the firſt king, which built great caracks to trauaile this
way. But this enterpriſe for all that tooke little effect. For if
it had, Africa had then béen made as an Iſland all compaſſed
with water, being no more ground betweene ſea and ſea, then
the ſpace of 20. leagues or 60. miles.
            About this time the Graecians gathered together an army
or fléete,Diodorus Siculus lib. 4. cap. 4. which now is called Argonautica, whereof Iaſon and

               Alceus were captains general. Some ſay they went from the
Iſle of Creta, others from Graecia. But whence ſoeuer they
departed, they ſailed through the Proponticke ſea, and Saint
Georges Sleeue vnto the Euxine ſea, where ſome periſhed,
and Iaſon thereupon returned backe into Greece. Alceus reported
that he was driuen with a tempeſt to the lake Maeotis,
               The lake Maeotis. where he was forſaken of al his company, and they which
eſcaped with great trauaile, paſſed through by land vnto the
Ocean ſea of Almaine,
               Shipping of great antiquitie in the Germaine ſea. where they tooke ſhipping, paſſing the
coaſts of Saxonie, Friſland, Holland, Flanders, France, Spaine,
Italie, and ſo returned vnto Peloponeſus and Greece, diſcouering
the moſt part of the coaſt of Europe.
            
            
               Strabo,
               Strabo lib. 1. pag 26. alleaging Ariſtonicus the Grammarian, ſheweth
that after the deſtruction of Troy Menelaus the king came out
of the ſtraights of the Leuant ſeas into the ſea Atlanticke and
coaſted Africa and Guinea, and doubled the Cape of Bona
Sperança, and ſo in time arriued in India. Of which voyage
of his there may be many more particulars gathered out of
the hiſtories. This Mediterrane ſea was alſo ſometimes called
The Adriaticke, The Aegaean, and the Herculean ſea, with
other names, according to the lands, coaſts &amp; Iſlands which
it paſſeth by, running into the great ſea Atlanticke, along the
coaſt of Africa.
            
            In the yéere 1300. after the flood Solomon cauſed a nauie
to be prepared on the Red ſea,1. of Kings. 9. at an hauen called Ezeon Geber,
               2. Chron. 8. to ſaile to the Eaſt India, where by opinion ſtande the
Iſlands called Tharſis and Ophir. This nauie was thrée
yéeres on this voyage, and then returned, and brought with
them gold, ſiluer, cypres, &amp;c. Whereby it ſéemeth that thoſe
places, and Iſlands were thoſe, which now be called the Luçones,
Lequeos, and Chinaes. For we know few other parts
from whence ſome of thoſe things are brought, or wherein
nauigation was ſo long ſince vſed.
            It is left vs alſo in hiſtories,Herodotus lib. 4. that a king of Egypt called
Neco, deſiring greatly to ioyne the Red ſea with the riuer
Nilus, commanded the Phoenicians to ſaile from the ſtraight
of Mecca to the farther end of the Mediterrane ſea, to ſée if it
did make any turne backe againe vnto Egypt. Which commandement
they obeied, ſailing towards the ſouth all along
the coaſt and countrey of Melinde, Quiloa, Sofala, till they

came to the Cape of Bona Eſperança, finding the ſea continually
on the left hand: But when they had doubled the Cape,
and found the coaſt continually on the right hand, they maruailed
much at it. Notwithſtanding they continued their
courſe forward toward the north al along the coaſt of Guiney
and the Mediterrane ſea, till they came backe againe into
Egypt, whence they firſt went out. In which diſcouerie they
remained two yéeres. And theſe are thought to be the firſt,
that compaſſed by ſea all the coaſt of Afrike, and ſailed round
about it.
            In the yéere 590. before the incarnation of Chriſt there
went out of Spaine a fléete of Carthaginian marchants vpon
their owne proper coſts and charges,Ariſtoteles lib. de mirandis in natura auditis. which ſailed toward
the weſt through the high ſeas to ſée if they could finde any
land: and they ſailed ſo farre, that they found at laſt the
Iſlands,Gonzalo Fernandes de Quiedo lib. 2 cap. 3. of his generall hiſtorie. which we now call the Antiles and Noua Spagna:
which Gonzalo Fernandes de Quiedo ſaith were then diſcouered,
although Chriſtopher Columbus afterwards by his
trauaile got more exact knowledge of them, and hath left vs
an euident notice where they be. But all theſe hiſtorians,
which wrote of theſe Antiles before, as of doubtfull and vncertaine
things, and of places vndiſcouered, doe now plainly
confeſſe the ſame to be the countrey of Noua Spagna.
            
            In the yéere 520. before the incarnation,Diodorus Siculus lib. 1. cap. 3. and after the ſetting
out of the aforeſaid army, Cambyſes king of Perſia tooke
Egypt, after whom ſuccéeded Darius the ſonne of Hiſtaſpis,
and he determined to make an end of the enterpriſe which
king Seſoſtris had begun, if they had not told him that the Red
ſea was higher then the land of Egypt, and that by meanes
of the ſalt ſea comming into the riuer Nilus, all the prouince
would haue béen loſt and vndone for hunger and thirſt. For
the freſh water of the riuer Nilus doth ouerflowe the whole
countrey, and the inhabitants haue no other water then that
for their drinke: whereupon he left his firſt purpoſe of proſecuting
that enterpriſe.
            Now by the way I ſhall not ſwarue much from my matter,
A digreſſion. if I ſpeake a word or two of ſome things incident to this
diſcourſe.Plinius lib. 9. cap. 58. de mu
                  
                     •
                  ibus Nili. The Egyptians ſay that they had in their countrey
certaine vermine like vnto rats, whereof many be halfe like
earth and the other halfe like a vermine. One kinde of them

kéepe the water, and another kinde the land. For my part I
thinke that theſe be they, which breake the ſerpents egges,
whereof there are many in the riuer Nilus, which alſo be called
Crocodiles: which in times paſt by report were ſo inchanted,
that thereby they could not hurt any perſon. But
when they were deliuered from their inchantment made by
the Egyptians arte,Ioannes Leo Africanus lib. 9. cap. de Nilo. and letters, then they endeuoured to kill
people, wilde beaſts and cattell, doing very much harme, ſpecially
thoſe which liue in the water, which oftentimes come
to the land, and liuing altogether on land become very ſtrong
poiſon. The people beyond the citie of Cairo vſe to fiſh for
them and eate them, and they take their heads, and ſet them
vpon the walles of their citie.
            Of theſe Crocodiles it is written,Plinius lib. 8. cap. 25. that they lay themſelues
along by the riuer with their mouthes open, and that there
come vnto them certaine white birds,Ioannes Leo Africanus lib. 9. litle bigger then thruſſhes,
which flie into the mouth of the Crocodile, and picke out
the filthines which is betwéene his téeth, and in his iawes,
wherewith he is greatly pleaſed; but for all that the Crocodile
would cloſe his mouth and deuoure the bird, if nature
had not prouided the bird a ſharpe pricke as it were, growing
out of his head, wherewith he pricketh the Crocodile in
the mouth; which cauſeth him to gape wide, and ſo the bird
flieth away without harme; yet there come by and by other
of thoſe birds, which make an end of cleanſing his mouth.
            In the ſame riuer there are alſo many beaſtes like vnto
horſes;Hippopotami. and vpon the land certaine fowles like vnto cranes,
which warre continually with ſerpents,Ibis. that come thither
from Arabia, and kill many of them. Which birds as alſo the
vermine, which eate the egges of the Crocodiles, are greatly
eſtéemed of the Egyptians.
            
            But now to returne to my matter, and to procéede in the
diſcoueries; In the yéere 485. before the incarnation of Chriſt
Xerxes the king of Perſia commanded Sataſpis his nephew to
goe and ſearch, and diſcouer India: who according to the precept
vndertooke the voyage, and went through the ſtraight of
Gibraltar, and paſſed the promontorie of Africa, which now
we call the Cape of Bona Sperança, ſtanding ſouthward betwixt
34. and 35. degrées in latitude, and being weary of ſo
great a nauigation turned from thence backe againe, as Bartholomew

Diaz did in our daies.
            Before the comming of Chriſt 443. yéeres Himilco and
Hanno his brother Carthaginian captaines gouerning that
part of Spaine,
               Plinius lib. 2. cap. 67. which is now called Andaluzia, departed from
thence each one with his nauie. Himilco ſailing towards the
north diſcouered the coaſts of Spaine, France, England, Flanders
and Germanie. And ſome write farther, that he ſailed
vnto Gotland, &amp; came to the Iſland of Thule, or Iſland, ſtanding
vnder the circle Arcticke in 24. degrées from the north
pole, and continued in his nauigation two yéeres, til he came
vnto this Iſland, where the day hath in Iune 22. houres, and
in December the night alſo hath 22. houres, whereby it is
there woonderfully cold.
            Now the other brother Hanno tooke his courſe towarde
Africa and Guiney, and he diſcouered the Fortunate Iſlands,
which we call the Canaries, and beſides theſe he diſcouered
others,Plinius lib. 6. cap. 31. as the Dorcades, Heſperides, &amp; the Gorgades, which
now be called the Iſles of Cape Verde. There he with his
company went along the coaſt till they doubled the Cape of
Bona Sperança, and taking their courſe towards the land,
they went along by it vnto another Cape named Aromaticum,
which is now called Guardafu, ſtanding ſoutheaſt from
Cape Verde in 14. degrées toward the north; and he came
to the coaſt of Arabia ſtanding in 16. and 17. degrées; and
was fiue yéeres in this voiage, before he returned backe into
Spaine.
               The nauigation of Hanno in Greeke herevnto agreeth. There be others that ſay, that he paſſed not beyond
Sierra Leona, but peopled it, and afterwards diſcouered as far
as the line. But it ſéemeth he made a full nauigation, becauſe
he ſpent ſo much time in his trauaile. It is reported that
the inhabitants of the Cape of Bona Sperança are great witches,
and inchanters of certaine ſnakes, which they bring to
ſuch ſeruice,Enchanted ſnakes. and commandement, that they kéepe their Churches
and Churchyards, gardens, orchards, barnes, and cattel
as well from wilde beaſts, as from théeues. For if they ſee any
to doe or to intend hurt, the ſnake windes her ſelfe to him or
them, holding them as priſoners, and commanding her yoong
ones to call their maſters vntill they be taken. If the théeues
be many, or the wilde beaſtes of ſo much ſtrength, that they
dare not meddle with them, then they goe vnto the houſe of
him with whom they doe liue: and if it be in the night time,

they giue ſo many ſtrokes, that at the laſt they doe awake
them, to cauſe them to prouide for their defence.
            A certaine Italian called Aloiſius Cadamuſta writeth, that
he being in the diſcouerie of Guiney in the kingdome of Budimol
lay in the houſe of Bisborol his ſonnes ſonne; and lying
in his bed he heard a great noiſe and many blowes giuen
about the houſe; whereupon Bisborol roſe, and went out: and
when he came againe, Cadamuſta demanded of him, where
he had béen; and he anſwered that he had béen with his Cobras
or ſnakes which called him. In the Indias there be many
of theſe kinde of ſnakes, and ſome full of poiſon, which notwithſtanding
the Indian people vſe to carrie about their
necks, and put them into their boſomes and vnder their
armes: which at ſome ſoundes that the people make will
daunce, and doe diuers things at commandement.
            There was a Portugall that ſomtime told me, that beyond
the Cape of Bona Sperança towards Sofala, Quiloa, and
Melinde, where he had béen, there were certaine birds, which
would come to the Black Moores at their call,Odericus writeth the like of one that brought multitudes of patridges to Trapezunda. and according
as the Moores did remooue, ſo the birds would doe, from one
trée to another: and they vſed to follow them till they did
light vpon ſome trée, from whence they could not remooue.
And as the Negros went vp the trée they ſhould finde waxe
and honie thereupon, not knowing whether it grewe there
naturally or not. In the ſame countrey alſo vnder ground in
Ant-holes they did finde much honie and waxe, which the
Antes did make, being ſomewhat bitter. Vpon the ſea coaſt
alſo they found certaine fiſhes, which commonly went vpright
in the water,Mermaides. hauing the faces and natures of women,
which the fiſhermen of thoſe places were acquainted with.
            In the yéere 355. before Chriſt it is ſaid that the Spanyards
ſailed through the maine ſea till they came vnto the flats of
India,

caried diuers marchandiſes, which trade they vſed in great
ſhips. And ſailing to the northweſt they came vnto certaine
flats, which with the flowing of the ſea were couered, and
with the ebbe were diſcouered, finding there many Tunnies
of great bignes, where they commonly vſed to fiſh them to
their great profit, becauſe they were the firſt vntill that time
that they had ſéene, and were greatly eſteemed.
            
               
The time of Alexander Magnus, as appiereth by the ages
of the world, was before the comming of Chriſt 324. yéeres:
we all know that he was borne in Europe: but he trauailed
into Aſia &amp; Africa, and paſſed through Armenia, Aſſyria, Perſia,
&amp; Bactria, ſtanding northerly in 44. degrées of latitude,
which is the fartheſt countrey in longitude wherein he was
in all his iourneyes. From thence he deſcended into India by
the mountaines of Imaus, and the valleyes of Paropaniſus,
and prepared a nauie in the riuer Indus, and therewith paſſed
into the Ocean ſea, where he turned by the lands of Gedroſia,
Caramania, &amp; Perſia, vnto the great citie of Babylon, leauing
Oneſicritus and Nearcus captaines of his fléete, which afterwards
came vnto him by the ſtraight of the Perſian ſea, and
vp the riuer of Euphrates, leauing that countrey and coaſt
diſcouered.
            After this, Ptolemey raigned king of Egypt, who by ſome
is reputed to haue béen baſtard ſonne vnto Philip father of
the foreſaid Alexander the great.Plinius lib. 6. cap. 29. This Ptolemey imitating
the forenamed kings Seſoſtris aud Darius, made a trench or
ditch of an hundred foote broad and of thirty foote déepe, and
ten or twelue leagues in length till he came to The bitter
Welles, pretending to haue his worke run into the ſea from
a mouth of the riuer Nilus, called Peluſium, paſſing now by
the citie Damiata. But this thing tooke none effect: for that
the Red ſea was thought to be higher by thrée cubits then the
land of Egypt, which would haue ouerflowed all the countrey,
to the ruine and loſſe thereof.
            In the yéere 277.Strabo lib 17. pag. 560 &amp; 561. before the incarnation ſuccéeded in the
gouernment of the kingdome one Philadelphus, who brought
to paſſe that the marchandiſes ſhould come out of Europe to
the citie of Alexandria vpwards by the riuer Nilus vnto a city
named Coptus,
               Coptus. Myos-Hormos now 
                     〈◊〉
                   on the Red ſea. and from thence to be conueyed by land to a
hauen ſtanding vpon the Red ſea called Myos-Hormos;
which way was trauailed in the night, the pilots directing
themſelues by the ſtars, which were expert in that practiſe.
And becauſe water was ſcant that way, they vſed to carrie it
with them for all the companie, till at the laſt to auoide that
trouble they digged very déepe wels, and made large ciſterns
for the receipt of raine water, by which the way furniſhed
with that commoditie, which at the firſt it wanted grewe in

continuance of time to be the more frequented.
            But whereas the ſtraight way was dangerons by reaſon
of flats and iſlands, the aforeſaid king Philadelphus with his
armies went on the ſide of Troglodytica, and in an hauen
called Berenice cauſed the ſhips to arriue which came out of
India, being a place of more ſuretie and leſſe perill; from
whence they might eaſily carrie the wares to the citie of
Coptus,
               The cauſe of the greatnes of Alexandria. and ſo to Alexandria. And by this meane Alexandria
grew ſo famous and rich, that in thoſe daies there was no
citie of the world comparable to it. And to ſpeake briefly and
particularly of the abundance of trafficke there vſed, it is left
written for an aſſured truth,Strabo lib. 17. pag. 549. that in the time of king Ptolemey
Auletes father vnto Cleopatra, it yéelded in cuſtomes
vnto him yéerly ſeuen millions and an halfe of gold, although
the trafficke was not then ſcant twenty yéeres old, by way of
that citie.
            But after that this prouince and countrey became ſubiect
to the Emperours of Rome,
               Strabo lib. 17. pag. 549. as they were greater in power,
and néerer in couetouſnes, ſo they enhanſed the cuſtomes: ſo
that within a little time the citie yéelded double the foreſaide
ſumme. For the traffike grew ſo excéeding great, that they
ſent euery yéere into India 120. ſhips laden with wares,
which began to ſet ſaile from Myos-Hormos about the middle
of Iuly,Plinius lib 6. cap. 23. and returned backe againe within one yéere.
            The marchandiſe which they did carrie amounted vnto
one million two hundred thouſand crownes, and there was
made in returne of euery crowne an hundred. In ſo much
that by reaſon of this increaſe of wealth the matrones or noble
women of that time and place,Plinius lib. 12. cap. 18. ſpent infinitely in decking
themſelues with precious ſtones, purple, pearles muſke, amber,
and the like: whereof the writers and hiſtorians of that
age ſpeake very greatly.
            
               Cornelius Nepos,
               Plinius lib. 2. cap. 67. alleaged by Plinie, maketh report of a
king of Egypt, that raigned in his time called Ptolemaeus Lathyrus,
from whom one Eudoxus fled vpon occaſion, and the
better to auoid and eſcape his hands he paſſed through the
Arabicke gulfe, and the ſea, all along the coaſt of Africa and
the Cape of Bona Sperança till he came vnto the Iſland of
Cadiz: and this nauigation by that courſe was in thoſe daies
as often vſed as now it is, if we may giue credit to the hiſtories.

Which appiereth the more manifeſt by this, that Caius
Caeſar the ſonne of Auguſtus going into Arabia did finde in
the Red ſea certaine péeces of thoſe ſhips, which came thither
out of Spaine. It was a vſe alſo long after thoſe daies to
paſſe to India by land. For ſo did the kings of the Soldans,
and the princes of Bactria, and other famous captaines, who
trauailing thither and into Scythia by land, had the view of
thoſe prouinces and countreyes, ſo farre till they came that
way vnto the * Weſt, and to the ſeas thereof on the north
part, whereunto many marchants then did trauaile. Marcus
Paulus Venetus writeth much hereof.Paulus Venetus commended. And although at the
firſt his booke was taken for a fabulous thing, yet now there
is better credit giuen vnto it, for that by the late experiences
of the trauailers and marchants of theſe daies into thoſe
parts, the names of the countreyes, cities and townes, with
their ſituations, latitudes and commodities are now found
true, as he and other hiſtoriographers of that time haue reported.
            In the 200. yéere before the incarnation it is written, that
the Romanes ſent an armie by ſea into India againſt the great
Can of Cathaia, which paſſing through the ſtraight of Gibraltar,
and running to the northweſt, found right ouer againſt
the Cape Finiſterre ten Iſlands, wherein was much tinne:
And they may be thoſe which were called the Caſſiterides,
               Caſſiterides. &amp;
being come to 50. degrées of latitude they found aThe northweſt paſſage, though the latitude be ſomewhat miſtaken. Straight;
and paſſing through it towards the weſt, they arriued in the
Empire of India, and fought with the king of Cathay, and ſo
came backe againe vnto the citie of Rome. Which thing howſoeuer
it may ſéeme either poſſible or not poſſible, true or not
true,What hiſtories may theſe be? yet ſo I finde it left to vs recorded in the * hiſtories of
that time.
            In the 100. yéere after the incarnation of Chriſt the Emperour
Traiane prepared an armie by ſea vpon the riuers
Euphrates and Tigris,
               Xiphil
                     •
                  nus in vita Traiani. and departed from them, and ſailed to
the Iſlands of Zyzara, and paſſing the ſtraight of Perſia entred
into the Ocean ſea and ſailed towards India all along
the coaſt till he came to that place where Alexander had béen,
and there he tooke certaine ſhips which came from Bengala,
of whom he learned the ſtate of that countrey. But becauſe he
was then in yéeres and wearie with his trauaile, but eſpecially

becauſe he found there ſmall reliefe for his armie, he returned
backe.
            After that the Romanes had gotten the moſt part of the
world, there were in that age made many, and notable diſcoueries.
But then came the Gothes, Moores, and other barbarous
nations, and deſtroied all. For in the yéere 412. after
the incarnation of Chriſt,Rome taken by the Gothes 412. they tooke the citie of Rome: And
the Vandales came out of Spaine and conquered Africa.
            
            And in the yeere 450. the king called Atila deſtroied many
cities in Italie:
               The originall of Venice 450. at which time the citie of Venice began. And
in this age the Frankes and Vandals entred into France.
            
            In the yéere 474. the Empire of Rome was loſt, and fell
from the Romanes to the Gothes.
            
            And after this came the Lombards into Italie, namely in
the yéere 560.
            Alſo about this time the ſect of the Arrians preuailed greatly:
and at this time one Merline of England was famous
for his prophecies.
            To be ſhort,The ſect of Mahumet began anno 611. in the yéere 611. ſproong vp the Mahumetane
ſect and Moriſco regiment, which by force inuaded both
Africa and Spaine.
            
            By all this it may appéere, that in that age all the world
was in an hurly burly, and all places very tumultuous. In ſo
much that trafficke and marchandiſe ceaſed:Trafficke and nauigation ceaſe. for no nation
durſt trade one with another neither by ſea nor land: nothing
as then remained ſtedfaſt neither in monarchies nor kingdomes,
Ramuſius 1. vol. fol 372. pag. 2. ſigniories, religions, lawes, artes, ſciences, nor nauigations.
Nor ſo much as the records and writings of ſuch
things did remaine, but were all burnt and conſumed by the
barbarous crueltie and vnbrideled power of the Gothes:
who became ſo couetous and ambitious, that they purpoſed
of themſelues to begin a new world, and to roote out the memorie,
and blot out the knowledge of all other nations beſides.
            But they that ſuccéeded after theſe times in the gouernment
of things, perceiuing the great and huge loſſe, that the
Chriſtian world had by the want of trafficke and ceaſing of
nauigation, whereby thoſe commodities and marchandiſes
could not be ſpent, which before went ordinarily from one
nation to another by the vſe of trade: to the end that this

decay and loſſe might be repaired, and the treaſures of the
Eaſt might be imparted with the Weſt, as it was woont in
the times of quietnes and peaceable liuing, they began to
deuiſe a way to paſſe to India, which was not as the former
way was by the Red ſea and the riuer Nilus, but a way of farther
ſailing &amp; farther length and coſt alſo. For they brought
their ware vp the riuer Indus,
               Ramuſius 1. vol. fol. 373. and there vnladed it, carrying
it by land through the countrey of Paropaniſus by Carauans
vnto the prouince of Bactria, and then ſhipped it in barks on
the riuer Oxus,
               A way by the riuer Oxus, the Caſpian ſea, Volga, and ouer land to Caffa. which falleth into the Caſpian ſea, and ſo ſailed
ouer that ſea vnto an hauen of the riuer Rha named Citracan
or Aſtracan, and ſo vpwards in the ſaid riuer which now
is called Volga; and as it appéereth they carried it to the citie
of Nouogrode in the prouince of Reſan, which now belongeth
to the great Duke of Moſcouia, ſtanding toward the north in
54. degrées of latitude: &amp; therehence they trauailed ouer land
vnto the prouince of Sarmatia vnto the riuer Tanais, which is
the diuiſion of Europe from Aſia; where they againe laded it
in barks, and caried it downe the riuer, into the lake Maeotis,
and to the citie of Caffa, which in ancient time was called
Theodoſia, which then belonged to the Genowais, who came
thither for thoſe wares in their galliaſſes or great ſhips.
            It is alſo left written, that the trade this way endured
vntill the raigne of Commodita Emperour of Armenia, who
prouided for a better courſe, and commanded this trafficke
of the ſpices to be conueied by the Caſpian ſea,Strabo lib. 11. and ſo through
the kingdome of Hiberia, which now is called Georgiana, and
from thence they entred by the riuer Phaſis, now Phaſſo, into
Pontus Euxinus,
               The marte of ſpices at Trapezunda. Ramuſius ibidem. and ſo vnto the city of Trapezunda ſtanding
in 40. and odde degrées of northerly latitude. And to that
place came ſhipping for the marchandiſes out of Europe and
Africa.
            
            It is further left recorded concerning this way of trafficke,
Strabo lib. 11. Plinius lib. 6. cap. 11. that Nicanor determined or had already begun to open
aboue 120. miles of land, which lieth betwéene the Caſpian
ſea and Pontus Euxinus, that they might come and goe by
water with their ſpices, drugs, and other commodities, there
vſed. But in the meane time this miſchiefe happened, that
Ptolemey Ceraunos killed him, and by his death this woorthy
and famous enterpriſe ceaſed without effect.
            
               
But the other way being alſo at laſt loſt by reaſon of the
wars of the Turks,
               Another way to Boghar, and ſo by carauans into Perſia by the riuer Ganges. it pleaſed God to open another way to
theſe marchandiſes from the Iſle of Samatra, the citie of
Malacca, and the Iſland of Iaua vnto Bengala, and ſo carrying
them vp the riuer Ganges vnto the citie of Agra; from
whence they trauailed ouer land vnto another citie ſtanding
néere the riuer Indus named Boghar, where they diſcharged,
bicauſe the citie ofOr Laor. 
               Cabor ſtandeth too farre within the land,
being the principall citie of the Mogores. From thence they
went forward to the great citie of Samarcand ſtanding in the
countrey of Bactria:
               Samarcande. and there the marchants of India, Perſia,
and Turkie met, bringing thither their ſeuerall commodities,
Woollen cloth good marchandiſe for Cathay. as cloth of gold, veluets, chamolets, ſcarlet, and woollen
clothes, which were carried to Cathay and the great kingdome
of China: wherehence they brought againe gold, ſiluer,
precious ſtones, pearles, ſilke, muſke, and many other things
of great value, and much rubarbe. After this theſe marchandiſe,
The way by Ormus and Balſara and ſo to Aleppo and Barutti. drugs, and ſpiceries were carried in ſhips vpon the Indian
ſea vnto the ſtreight of Ormus, and to the riuers Euphrates
and Tigris; and were vnladen in the citie of Balſara
ſtanding in 31. degrées towards the north, and from thence
they were caried ouer land vnto the cities of Aleppo, Damaſcus,
and Barutti ſtanding on the ſame ſide in 35. degrées: And
there the Venetian gallies or galliaſſes, which tranſported
pilgrims into the holy land, came and receiued of thoſe goods.
            In the yéere 1153. in the time of Fredericke Barbaroſſa it
is written that there came to Lubec a citie of Germanie one
Canoa with certaine Indians, like vnto a long barge: which
ſeemed to haue come from the coaſt of Baccalaos, which ſtandeth
in the ſame latitude that Germanie doth: The Germaines
greatly woondered to ſée ſuch a barge, and ſuch people,
not knowing from whence they came, nor vnderſtanding
their ſpéech, eſpecially becauſe there was then no knowledge
of that countrey, as now there is: it may be credible that
though the boate was ſmall in reſpect of thoſe huge ſeas, yet
the winde and water might bring them thither: as we ſée in
theſe our daies, that the Almadie which is but a ſmall boate
commeth notwithſtanding from Quiloa, Moſambique, and
Sofala to the Iſland of S. Helena, being a ſmall ſpot of land
ſtanding in the maine Ocean off the coaſt of Bona Sperança
               
ſo farre ſeparated.
            In the yéere 1300. after the comming of Chriſt the great
Soldan of Cayro commanded that the ſpiceries and drugs,Ioannes Leo Africanus.
and marchandiſes of India ſhould be carried through the
Red ſea,
               Ramuſius 1. vol. fol. 373. as it was vſed before: at which time they vnladed
on the Arabian ſide, at the hauen of Iuda, and carried them
vnto the houſe at Mecca, and the carriers of it were the pilgrims.
So that each Prince vſed a cuſtome to augment the
honour, and increaſe the profite of his countrey. And theſe
Soldans had ſpeciall regarde to Cayro, from whence the
wares were carried vnto the countreyes of Egypt, Lybia,
Africa, the kingdomes of Tunez, Tremeſſen, Fez, Marocco,
Suz: and ſome of it was carried beyond the mountaines of
Atlas vnto the citie of Tombuto,
               Tombuto. and the kingdome of the Ialophos;
vntill afterwards that the Portugals did bring it about
the Cape of Bona Sperança vnto the citie of Lisbone, as in
place conuenient we purpoſe to ſhew more at large.
            In the yéere 1344. king Peter the fourth of that name
reigning in Arragon, the Chronicles of his time report, that
one Don Luis of Cerda, ſonne vnto the ſonne of Don Iohn of
Cerda, craued aide of him to goe and to conquers the Iſles of
the Canaries,
               The Canarie Iſlands. ſtanding in 28. degrées of latitude to the north,
becauſe they were giuen vnto him by Pope Clement the ſixt,
which was a French man. Whereby in thoſe daies there
grew a knowledge of thoſe Iſlands in all Europe, and ſpecially
in Spaine: for ſuch great Princes would not begin nor
enterpriſe things of ſuch moment without great certaintie.
            About this time alſo the Iſland of Madera was diſcouered
by an Engliſh man called Macham:
               The Iſland of Madera diſcouered by Macham an Engliſh man. who ſailing out of England
into Spaine, with a woman of his, was driuen out of his
direct courſe by a tempeſt, and arriued in that Iſland, and caſt
his anker in that hauen, which now is called Machico after
the name of Macham. And bicauſe his louer was then ſea-ſicke,
he there went on land with ſome of his companie, and
in the meane time his ſhip weyed and put to ſea, leauing him
there: whereupon his louer for thought died. Macham, which
greatly loued her, built in the Iſland a chappell or hermitage
to burie her in, calling it by the name of Ieſus Chappell: and
wrote or graued vpon the ſtone of her tombe his name and
hers, and the occaſion whereupon they arriued there. After

this he made himſelfe a boate all of a trée, the trées being there
of a great compaſſe about, and went to ſea in it with thoſe
men of his companie that were left with him, and fell with
the coaſt of Africke without ſaile or oare, and the Moores
among whom he came tooke it for a miracle, and preſented
him vnto the king of that countrey: and that king alſo admiring
the accident, ſent him and his companie vnto the king
of Caſtile.
            
            In the yéere 1395. king Henrie the third of that name reigning
in Caſtile, the information which Macham gaue of this
Iſland, and alſo the ſhip wherein he went thither, mooued
many of France and of Caſtile to goe and diſcouer it, and the
great Canarie: And they which went were principally the
Andaluzes, the Biſcaines, and the Guepuſ
                     •
                  oes, carrying with
them many people and horſes. But I know not whether the
charge of that voiage was theirs or the kings. But by whom
ſoeuer it was ſet out,The firſt diſcouerie of the Canaries by the Chriſtians 1405. they ſeeme to be the firſt that diſcouered
the Canaries and landed in them: where alſo they tooke
150 of the Iſlanders priſoners. Concerning the time of this
diſcouerie, there is ſome difference among the writers: for
ſome affirme this to be done in the yeere 1405.
            
               The firſt beginning of the Portugall
Diſcoueries.
               THe Chronicles of Portugall haue this record, That after
the incarnation of Chriſt 1415. king Iohn the firſt
of that name king of Portugall, departed from the citie
of Lisbon with the Prince Don Duarte or Edward,
                  The firſt conqueſt of the Portugals in Barbarie 1415. and Don
Peter, and Don Henry his ſonnes, with other Lords, and nobles
of his realme, and ſailed into Africa, where he tooke the
great citie of Ceuta,
                  This victorie was gotten by the helpe of the Engliſh as Walſingham writeth. ſtanding on the north ſide thereof betwéene
35. and 36. degrees in latitude: which was one of the
principall cauſes of the enlarging of the dominions of Portugall.
               
               When they were come from thence, Henry the kings third
ſonne, deſirous to enlarge the kingdome &amp; to diſcouer ſtrange
&amp; vnknowne countreyes, being then in Algarbe, gaue direction
for the diſcouery of the coaſt of Mauritania.
                  Iohn de Barros Aſiae decad. 1. lib 1. cap. 2. For in thoſe
daies none of the Portugals had euer paſſed the Cape de

Non, ſtanding in 29. degrées of latitude.Cape de Non. And for the better accompliſhing
of this diſcouerie, the aforeſaid Don Henry prepared
a fléete, &amp; gaue commandement to the chiefe captaines
to procéede in diſcouerie from the aforeſaide Cape forward:
Which they did. But when they came to another Cape named
Bojador,
                  Cape Bojador. there was not one of them, that durſt goe farther
or beyond it: at which fearefull and cowardly faintnes
of theirs the Prince was excéedingly diſpleaſed.
               In the yéere 1417. king Iohn the ſecond reigning in Caſtile,
and his mother Ladie Katharine then vſing the gouernment,
one Monſieur Ruben of Bracamonte which was then
Admirall of France craued the conqueſt of the Iſlands of the
Canaries, with the title to be king of them, for a kinſman of
his called Monſieur Iohn Betancourt: which being granted
him by the Quéene, and farther alſo partly furniſhed out,
he departed from Siuill with a good armie: But the chiefe or
principall cauſe that mooued him to enter into this action,
was to diſcouer and perfectly to take a view of the Iſland of
Madera, whereof Macham before had giuen ſo much information.
But for all that he went vnto the Canaries, and carried
with him a Friar called Mendo to be as Biſhop thereof,
admitted by Pope Martine the fift. When they were landed
they wonne Lancerota,
                  The Canarie Iſlands conquered. 
                  Forteuentura, Gomera, and Ferro:
from whence they ſent into Spaine many ſlaues, honie, waxe,
Camfora, or Camfire, hides, Orchall, figs, Sanguis Draconis,
and other marchandiſes, whereof they made good profit: And
this armie alſo as they report,Porto Santo. diſcouered Porto Santo. The
Iſland that they inhabited was Lancerota, where they built
in it a caſtle of ſtone for their better defence and ſecuritie.
               In the yéere 1418. one Iohn Gonzales Zarco,
                  Iohn de Barros decad. 1. lib. 1. cap. 2. and Triſtam
Vaz Teixera, houſholde gentlemen vnto Don Henry the
kings third ſonne, perceiuing the deſire that their maſter had
to diſcouer new countreyes, and willing in that courſe to doe
him ſome ſeruice, craued of him a barke, and licence to vndertake
the action: which they obtained, and ſailed to the coaſt
of Africa: where they were ouertaken with a terrible tempeſt;
but they were ſuccoured by falling with the land, and
entring into an hauen called Santo, where they landed, and
remained two yéeres.
               In the yéere 1420. they diſcouered the Iſland of Madera,
                  
where they founde the chappell and the ſtone and tombe,Ba

                     os decad. 1. lib. 1. cap. 3.
whereupon the foreſaide Macham had grauen his name.The chappell built by Macham found in Madera.
There are others that write that a certaine Caſtillian perceiuing
the deſire and fauour to nauigation which Don Henry
had, told him that they had found the Iſland of Porto Santo;
which being but a ſmall thing they made no reckoning of it.
Don Henry ſent Bartholomew Pereſtrello, Iohn Conzales
Zarco, Triſtam Vaz Teixera, and by the ſignes and likelyhoods
that they had receiued,Porto Santo. they went to Porto Santo, and
there remained two yéeres: and after that, namely in the
yéere 1420. they ſailed alſo to the Iſland of Madera, where
they found the memoriall and monument of the aforeſaide
Macham the Engliſh man.
               As for Monſieur Betancourt, who entred into the conqueſt
of the Canaries as is aboue mentioned, he was ſlaine
in the middeſt of the action, and left behind him for his heire a
kinſeman of his called Monſieur Menante,
                  The Canarie Iſlands ſold ouer to a Spanyard.
                   who after that
ſold the ſaid Iſlands of the Canaries vnto one Peter Barba of
Siuill. There are other which ſpeake otherwiſe, and ſay that
Monſieur Iohn Betancourt went into France to prepare a
new armie about this conqueſt, and left there a nephew of
his; who becauſe he heard no more of his vncle, and ſawe
that he could not maintaine the warres any longer, he ſolde
the Canaries to Don Henry the king of Portugals third ſonne,
for a certaine thing that he gaue him in the Iſland of Madera.
               
               In the yéere 1424. they write that the ſaide Don Henry
prepared a nauie and armie to conquer theſe Iſlands,Barros decad. 1. lib. 1. cap. 12. wherein
there went as captaine generall, one Don Fernando de
Caſtro; and by reaſon of the valiantnes and warlike behauiour
of the people they had the repulſe: whereupon Don Ferdinando,
conſidering the great charge, and little or no good
ſucceſſe, he gaue ouer the action, and returned backe againe.
After this Don Henry reſigned ouer theſe Iſlandes to the
crowne of Caſtile, in conſideration of the aides which Betancou
                        •
                     t
had receiued. But the Caſtillians agrée not vnto this
report. For they ſay, that neither the kings of Portugall, nor
Don Henry would render the Iſlands, till they came in queſtion
before Pope Eugenius the fourth;The Canaries came to the crowne of Spaine in the yeere 1431 who fully vnderſtanding
the matter, gaue the conqueſt of the Iſlands by order of
iudgement vnto the king of Caſtile in the yéere 1431. whereupon

name of Fortunatae, ſtanding in 28. degrées to the north:

night as much, lying diſtant from Spaine 200. leagues, and
from the coaſt of Africa 18. leagues.The ancient maners of the Canarians. The people were idolaters,
and did eate their fleſh raw for want of fire: they had no
iron, and ſowed without any toole: they tilled and raiſed the
ground with oxe hornes, and goats hornes. Euery Iſland did
ſpeake a ſeuerall language. They tooke many wiues, and
knew them not carnally vntill they had deliuered them to the
ſuperiours. They had diuers other Paganiſh cuſtomes: but
now the Chriſtian faith is planted among them.
               The commodities of theſe Iſlands are wheate,The commodities of the Canaries. barley, ſugar,
wine, and certaine birdes, called Canarie birdes, much
eſteemed in Spaine and other places.
               In the Iſland of Ferro they haue none other water, but
that which procéedeth in the night from a trée,A tree yeelding abundance of water in Ferro. compaſſed
with a cloud, whence water iſſueth, ſeruing the whole Iſland
both men and cattell, a thing notorious and knowne to very
many.
               In the yéere 1428. it is written that Don Peter the king
of Portugals eldeſt ſonne was a great traueller. He went into
England, France, Almaine, and from thence into the Holy
land, and to other places; and came home by Italie, taking
Rome &amp; Venice in his way: from whence he brought a map
of the world,A moſt rare and excellent map of the world. which had all the parts of the world and earth
deſcribed. The ſtreight of Magelan was called in it The Dragons
taile: The Cape of Bona Sperança, The forefront of
Afrike,
                  A great helpe to Don Henry in his diſcoueries. and ſo foorth of other places: by which map Don Henry
the kings third ſonne was much helped and furthered in
his diſcoueries.
               It was tolde me by Francis de Soſa Tauares, that in the
yéere 1528. Don Fernando the kings ſonne and heire did
ſhew him a map, which was found in the ſtudie of Alcobaza,
which had béene made 120. yéeres before, which map did ſet
foorth all the nauigation of the Eaſt Indies,
                  As much diſcouered in ancient time as now is. with the Cape of
Bona Sperança, according as our later maps haue deſcribed
it. Whereby it appéereth, that in ancient time there was as

much or more diſcouered,Barros decad. 1. lib. 1. cap. 4. then now there is. Notwithſtanding
all the trauaile, paines and expences in this action of
Don Henry, yet he was neuer wearie of his purpoſed diſcoueries.
At length there was a ſeruant of his called Gilianes
that firſt paſſed the Cape Bojador,
                  Cape Bojador firſt paſſed. Anno 1132. a place before terrible to
all men: and he brought word that it was not ſo dangerous,
as it was reported: for on the other ſide of it he went on land,
and in maner of taking poſſeſſion, ſet in the ground a croſſe of
wood, to be as a marke and token afterwards of his diſcouery
ſo farre.
               In the yéere 1433. in the moneth of Auguſt Don Iohn
died,The death of Don Iohn the firſt of Portugall. and his ſonne Don Duarte or Edward ſuccéeded him in
the kingdome.
               In the yéere 1434. Don Henry ſet out one Alfonſo Gonſales
Baldaia,
                  Barros decad. 1. lib. 1. cap. 5. and Gilianes aforeſaid, and they went to another
Cape, which was beyond the former, and going on land perceiued
the countrey to be inhabited: and becauſe they were
deſirous to ſatiſfie Don Henry with as much relation and
knowledge as they could get, they continued their voiage,
and went forward, till they came to a certaine point of land,
from whence they turned backe againe.
               In the yéere 1438. king Edward,
                  The death of Don Duarte king of Portugall. whom the Portugals call
Don Duarte died, and Don Alphonſo the prince being yoong,
Don Peter his vncle gouerned the kingdome.
               In the yéere 1441. Don Henry ſent out two ſhips,Barros decad. 1. lib. 1. cap. 6. and the
captaines were in the one Triſtan, and Antonie Gonſales
in the other Being put to ſea they tooke a priſe vpon the coaſt,
and ſailed on to Cape Blanco,
                  Cape Blanco. that is the White Cape, ſtanding
in 20. degrées, and informed Don Henry of the ſtate of
that coūtrey by the Moores which they brought from thence.
Whereupon he ſent one Fernan Lopez de Sauado to giue
knowledge thereof to Pope Martine, truſting to make theſe
things commodious to Holy Church. Vpon which knowledge
the Pope granted indulgences and euerlaſting pardon,I
                        •
                     dulgences

                     anted to encourage to this enterpriſe.
and all other things demanded of him, vnto thoſe which
ſhould die in this enterpriſe.
               After this,Barros decad. 1. lib. 1. cap. 7. in the yéere 1443. Don Henry commanded
Antonie Gonſales to carrie backe the ſlaues which he had
brought, and to ranſome them in their countrey: Which he
did, and the Moores gaue them in trucke for them againe

blacke Moores with curled haire, and ſome gold; ſo that now
that place is called Rio de Oro,
                  Rio de Oro, why ſo called. that is, the Golden Riuer;
whereby the deſire of the diſcouerie might be the more increaſed.
               Not long after he ſent out another named Nunnez Triſtan,
who came vnto the Iſlands of Arguin,
                  The Iſlands of Arguin. where he tooke more
ſlaues, and brought them to Portugall in the yéere 1444.
               Hereupon alſo one Lanſarote, a groome of Don Gilians
chamber, with others aſſociated with him, armed out certaine
ſhips,The Iſlands of Garze. which went coaſting til they came to the Iſlands
of Garze, where they tooke two hundred ſlaues: which were
the firſt that were brought from thence to Portugall.
               
               In the yéere 1445. there went as captaine of a barke one
Gonſalo de Syntra,
                  Barros decad. 1. lib. 1. cap. 9. an eſquire belonging to Don Henry into
thoſe parts; and he went on land, where he was taken with
ſixe or ſeuen more of his company, which place was therefore
called after his name,Angra de Gonſaluo de Syntra. 
                  Angra de Gonſaluo de Syntra. This
was the firſt loſſe, which the Portugals receiued in their diſcoueries.
               In the yéere following Don Henry ſent out thrée carauels,
wherein went as captaines Antonie Gonſales, Diego Aloizio,
and Gomes Perez, who had their direction, not to enter
into Rio de Oro, nor to beare themſelues diſorderly, but to
trauaile in peace, and to conuert as many infidels as they
could to Chriſtianitie. But none of theſe things were performed
by them; for they returned without doing any memorable
act.
               In the ſame yéere 1446. another eſquire belonging to the
king of Portugall called Denis Fernandes of the citie of Liſbon,
                  Barros decad. 1. lib. 1. cap. 9. &amp; cap. 13. entred into theſe diſcoueries, more to winne fame then
to reape commoditie by them. And he being in his voiage
came to the riuer of Sanaga,
                  The riuer of Sanaga. ſtanding betwéene 15. and 16.
degrées of latitude towards the north, where he tooke certaine
Negroes; and not contented therewith, he went forward
and diſcouered Cape Verde,
                  Cape Verde. ſtanding in 14. degrees on
the ſame ſide; and there he ſet vp vpon the land a croſſe of
wood, and then returned with great contentation.
               In the yéere 1447. one Nunnez Triſtan went foorth to diſcouer
in a carauell,Barros decad. 1. lib. 1. cap. 14. and he paſſed the aforeſaid Cape Verde,
and Rio Grande,
                  Rio Grande. and went paſt it vnto another ſtanding beyond

it in 12. degrées, where he was alſo taken with 18. Portugals
more: but the ſhip came home againe in ſafetie, conducted
by fower or fiue which eſcaped the hands of the Negroes.
               
               In this yéere alſo 1447. it happened that there came a Portugall
ſhip through the ſtreight of Gibraltar; and being taken
with a great tempeſt, was forced to runne weſtwards more
then willingly the men would, and at laſt they fell vpon an
Iſland which had ſeuen cities,The Iſland of ſeuen cities. and the people ſpake the Portugall
toong, and they demanded if the Moores did yet trouble
Spaine, whence they had fled for the loſſe which they receiued
by the death of the king of Spaine, Don Roderigo.
               
               The boateſwaine of the ſhip brought home a little of the
ſand, and ſold it vnto a goldſmith of Lisbon, out of the which
he had a good quantitie of gold.
               Don Pedro vnderſtanding this, being then gouernour of
the realme, cauſed all the things thus brought home, and
made knowne, to be recorded in the houſe of Iuſtice.
               There be ſome that thinke, that thoſe Iſlands whereunto
the Portugals were thus driuen, were the Antiles, or Newe
Spaine, alleaging good reaſons for their opinion, which here I
omit, becauſe they ſerue not to my purpoſe. But all their reaſons
ſéeme to agrée, that they ſhould be that countrey, which
is called Noua Spagna.
               
               In the yéere 1449. the king Don Alfonſo gaue licence vnto
his vncle Don Henry to inhabit the Iſlands of the Açores,

there he tooke the towne called Alcaçer.
               
               And in the yéere 1461. he commanded Signior Mendez a
gentleman of his houſe to build the caſtle of Arguin,

he gaue vnto him the gouernment,The caſtle of Arguin builded. as to his lieutenant.Ibidem.
               
               In the yéere 1462. there came into the realme of Portugall
thrée Genowais of good parentage,Barros decad. 1. lib. 2. cap. 1. the chiefe of whom was

               In the yéere 1469. the king of Portugall did let out for
yéerely rent the trade of Guiney vnto one called Fernan Gomez,

                  The countrey of Guiney let out to farme. He
let it out for fiue yéeres, for two hundred thouſand Reyes by

and added vnto his leaſe this condition, that euery yéere he
ſhould diſcouer an hundred leagues.

into Africa with his ſonne Prince Iohn, where they tooke the

by Iohn de S. Aren, and Iohn de Scouar;
                  La Mina. and they
went and found the Mine in 5. degrées of latitude.
               And the next yéere,Ibidem. which was 1472. one Fernando da Poo
diſcouered the Iſland now called after his name.The Iſle de Fernan de Poo. Alſo about
this time the Iſlands of Sainct Thomas,
                  Sainct Thome. Rha del Principe. and Del Principe
were diſcouered, ſtanding vnder the line, with the firme land
alſo,Benin. wherein is the kingdome of Benin,
                  Cape de Santa Catarina. reaching to the Cape
de Santa Catarina, ſtanding on the ſouth ſide of the line in 3.
degrées. The man that made this diſcouerie was a ſeruant
of the kings, and his name was Sequeira.
               
               Many ſuppoſe, that than alſo there were thoſe places,
countreyes and Iſlands diſcouered, which before were neuer
knowne to vs ſince the flood.
               In the yéere 1480. the valiant king Don Alphonſo died,Don Iohn the ſecond.
and left many things woorthy of memorie behinde him;Barros decad. 1. lib. 3 cap. 2. and

yéere 1481. gaue direction for the building of the caſtle De
Mina to one Diego d'Azambuxa; who did ſo, and was made
captaine of it.
               
                  
In the yéere 1484. the foreſaid king Iohn ſent out one Diego
Caon a knight of his Court to diſcouer:Barros decad. 1. lib. 3. cap. 3. and he went to
the Riuer of Congo,
                  Rio de Congo. ſtanding on the ſouth ſide in 7. or 8. degrées
of latitude; where he erected a pillar of ſtone with the
royall armes and letters of Portugall, wherein he wrote the
commandement that he had receiued from the king, with the
time and day of his being there. From thence he went vnto
a riuer néere the Tropicke of Capricorne,
                  Diſcouerie neere vnto the Tropick of Capricorne. ſetting ſtill vp pillars
of ſtone where he thought it conuenient, and ſo came
backe againe vnto Congo,
                  An ambaſſadour from the king of Congo. and to the king of that countrey:
who thereupon ſent an ambaſſadour and men of credite into
Portugall.
               
               In the next yéere or the ſecond following, one Iohn Alonſo
d'Aueiro came from the kingdome of Benin, and brought
home pepper with a taile:Pepper of Benin. which was the firſt of that kinde
ſéene in Portugall.
               
               In the yéere 1487. king Iohn ſent to diſcouer India ouer
land.Barros decad. 1. lib. 3. cap. 5. Pedro de Couillan and Alfonſo de Pavua ſent to diſcouer India. In which iourney went one Pedro de Couillan a ſeruant
of the kings, and Alfonſo de Payua, becauſe they could
ſpeake the Arabian toong. They went out in the moneth of
May, and the ſame yeere they tooke ſhipping at Naples, and
arriued in the Iſle of Rhodes, and lodged in the houſe that
was prouided for the Portugall knights of that order: from
thence they went to Alexandria,
                  Alexandria. and ſo to Cayro, and thence
to the hauen of Toro in the companie of the Carauans or
carriers which were Moores.
                  Cairo. There they tooke ſhipping,Toro. and
being on the Red ſea they arriued at the citie of Aden,
                  Aden. and
there they ſeparated themſelues: for Alfonſo de Payua went
towards Aethiopia, and Pedro de Couillan into India. Who
came vnto the cities of Cananor and Calicut,
                  Cananor. and came backe
vnto Goa:
                  Calicut. where he tooke ſhipping vnto Sofala,
                  Goa. being on the
coaſt of Africa in the ſoutherne latitude of 20. degrées,Sofala. to ſée
the mines that were of ſo great name.Moſambique. From Sofala he turned
backe to Moſambique,
                  Quiloa. and vnto the cities of Quiloa, Mombaza,
                  Mombaza. and Melinde,
                  Melinde. till he came backe againe vnto the citie of
Aden: where he and Alfonſo de Payua deuided themſelues:
and thence he ſailed againe through the Red ſea vnto the citie
of Cayro, where he thought to haue met with his companion:
but there he heard that he was dead by the letters that he
receiued from king Iohn his maſter; in which letters he was

farther commanded to trauaile into the countrey and dominions
of Presbyter Iohn.
               
               Vpon this commandement he prouided for his farther
iourney,The voiage of Pedro de Couillan vnto the countrey of Prete Ianni. and from Cairo went backe againe to the hauen of
Toro, and from thence to Aden, where he had béen twiſe before:
and there hearing of the fame of the citie of Ormuz, he
determined to goe thither; and therefore went along the
coaſt of Arabia vnto the Cape Razalgate ſtanding vnder the
Tropicke of Cancer,
                  Cape Razalgate. and from thence he went to Ormuz,
                  Ormuz.
ſtanding in 27. degrées on that ſide. There he learned and vnderſtood
of the ſtreigth of Perſia, and of that countrey: and
entred there into the Red ſea, and paſſed ouer to the realme of
the Abaſſini,
                  Abaſſini. which commonly is called Presbyter Iohns
countrey or Aethiopia:
                  Pedro de Couillan the firſt Portugall that came into the Eaſt India and Aethiopia by the Red ſea. and there he was detained till the
yéere 1520. when there came thither the ambaſſadour Don
Roderigo de Lima: This Pedro de Couillan was the firſt
Portugall that euer knew and ſaw the Indias and thoſe ſeas,
and other places adioyning thereunto.
               In the yéere 1490. the king ſent vnto Congo one Gonzalo
de Soſa a gentleman with thrée ſhips,Barros decad. 1. lib. 3. cap 9. and in them ſent
home the ambaſſadour of Congo, which was ſent into Portugall,
whom Diego Caon had brought from thence: who at his
being in Portugall was baptiſed both himſelfe and others of
his companie.
               The aforeſaid Gonzalo de Soſa died in that iourney by
the way, and in his roome they choſe his nephew Ruy de Soſa
for their captaine; and ſo being come vnto Congo, the king
was very glad of their comming, and yéelded himſelfe, and
the greater part of his realme to be baptized:A great part of the kingdome of Congo baptized. whereof the
Portugals had good cauſe to reioice, ſéeing by them ſo many
Infidels were conuerted from gentilitie and paganiſme to
Chriſtianitie.
            
            
               The firſt beginning of the Diſcoueries of the Spanyards,
with the continuation of the Diſcoueries
of the Portugals.
               IN the yéere 1492. in the time of Don Ferdinando king of
Caſtile, he being at the ſiege of Granada, diſpatched one
Chriſtopher Columbus a Genoway with three ſhips to goe

and diſcouer Noua Spagna: who firſt had offered his ſeruice
for a weſterne diſcouerie vnto king Iohn of Portugall; but he
would not entertaine him.
               He being ſufficiently furniſhed for this enterpriſe departed
from the towne of Palos the third day of Auguſt, hauing with
him as captaines and pilots Martin Alfonſo Pinzon, Francis
Martinez Pinzon, Vincent Yannes Pinzon, and Bartholomew
Columbus his brother, with 120. perſons more in his companie:
The firſt that in ſailing are thought to haue obſerued latitud
                        •
                     s. and ſome affirme that they were the firſt that ſailed by
latitudes. They tooke the Canaries in their way, and there
refreſhed themſelues; taking their courſe thence towards Cipango:
but finding the ſea by the way full of wéeds they were
amazed, and with great feare arriued at the Antiles the tenth
day of October, and the firſt Iſland that they deſcried was
called Guanahany:
                  The Iſle of Guanahany firſt diſcouered. where they went on land, and tooke poſſeſſion
of it, and named it San Saluador. This Iſland ſtandeth
in 25. degrées of northerly latitude. And after that they
found many Iſlands, which they called the Princes becauſe
they were the firſt that they had diſcouered.
               The Sauages of thoſe parts call theſe Iſlands by the name
of Lucaios,
                  Lucaios Iſlands. hauing in déede ſeuerall names for them. And they
doe ſtand on the north ſide almoſt vnder the Tropicke of Cancer.
As for the Iſland of S. Iames or Iamaica, it ſtandeth betwéene
16. and 17. degrées.
               Thence they went to the Iſland which the naturals of the
countrey call Cuba,
                  Cuba. and the Spanyards call it Ferdinandina,
bicauſe their kings name was Ferdinando, ſtanding in 22.
degrées: from whence the Indians conducted them vnto another
Iſland, which they call Hayti, and the Spanyards called
it Iſabella, in the memorie of the Quéene of Caſtile, which
was ſo called,Hiſpaniola. and they named it alſo Hiſpaniola. In that
Iſland the Admirall ſhip of Columbus was caſt away: of the
timber and planks whereof they made a forte, wherein they
left 38 men, and a captaine called Roderigo de Arana, to
learne the language and cuſtomes of the countrey. They
brought from thence muſters and ſhewes of gold, pearles, and
other things, which that countrey yéelded; and ten Indians
alſo, whereof ſixe died, the reſt were brought home and baptized.
               Hereupon there grewe ſuch a common deſire of trauaile

among the Spanyards, that they were ready to leape into the
ſea to ſwim, if it had béen poſſible, into thoſe new found parts.
The aforeſaid company of Columbus at their comming home
tooke in their way the Iſles of the Açores, and the 4. day of
March in the yéere 1493. they entred into the bar of Lisbon:
                  Contention betweene the kings of Spaine and Portugall.
which diſcouerie pleaſed not the king of Portugall. Whereupon
roſe a contention betwéene thoſe two kings.
               
                  Chriſtopher Columbus being arriued went preſently into
Caſtile with the newes of all things, and acquainted the king
Fernando, with the diſcontentednes of the king of Portugall:
whereupon he and the Quéene Iſabella his wife ſent ſtreight
word thereof vnto Pope Alexander the 6. whereat he and
the Italians were in great admiration,The bull of donation. maruailing that there
was any more land beſides that which was vnder the Romanes.
But the end of this matter was this: Alexander the
Pope gaue theſe countreies by his iudgement vnto the kingdomes
of Leon and Caſtile; with this condition, That they
ſhould labour to extirpate idolatrie, and plant the Holy faith
in thoſe countreyes.
               
                  Fernando the king hauing receiued this anſwere, was
glad of it, and ſent Chriſtopher Columbus againe on the former
voiage,Gomara hiſtoriae general. lib. 1. cap. 17. hauing made him Admirall, and giuen him other
honors, with particular armes, and a poſie written about his
armes to this effect.
               
                  For Caſtile and for Leon
                  A new world found out Colon.
               
               In the yéere 1493. the 25. of the moneth of October Chriſtopher
Columbus went backe vnto the Antiles,
                  Columbus ſecond voiage. and frō 
                  Cadiz
he tooke his courſe, hauing in his companie 17. ſhips, and
1500. men in them, with his brethren Bartholomew Columbus,
and Diego Columbus, with other knights, gentlemen,
men of law, and religious men, with chalices, croſſes, rich
ornaments, and with great power and dignitie from Pope
Alexander; &amp; the 10. day after their ſetting foorth, they arriued
at the Canaries; &amp; from thence in 25. or 30. daies they ſailed
vnto the Antiles; &amp; the firſt Iſland that they ſaw ſtandeth in
14. degrées towards the north, due weſt from Cape Verde on
the coaſt of Africa. They ſay that the diſtance from thence to
the Canaries is 800. leagues.Deſeada diſcouered. The name they gaue it was
Deſeada, that is the Deſired or wiſhed Iſland, for the great

deſire which the companie had to come to ſight of land. After
that they diſcouered many more which they named the Virgines,
                  Caribas. which the naturals of the countrey call the Caribas, for
that the men of that countrey are good warriers, and ſhoote
well in bowes. They poiſon their arrowes with an herbe,
whereof he that is hurt dieth, biting himſelfe like as a mad
dog doth.
               From theſe Iſlands and others they went vnto the principall
Iſland there, which they of the countrey doe call Boriquen,
                  Boriquen of S. Iohn de porto riceo. and the Spanyards call it S. Iohn, and thence to Hiſpaniola
or Iſabella, where they found all the men dead which
there they had left. Here the Admirall left the moſt part of the
people to plant it, and appointed his brethren to be gouernours
there: and ſo tooke two ſhips, and went to diſcouer the
other ſide of the Iſland of Cuba,
                  Iamaica. and from thence to Iamaica.
All theſe Iſlands ſtand from 16. vnto 20. degrées of northerly
latitude. In the meane time that the Admiral
                     •
                   ſailed about,
his brethren and they that were left with them were much
troubled, becauſe the Sauages did riſe againſt them. So that
Chriſtopher Colon went backe againe into Spaine, to tell the
king and Quéene of his aduentures.
               In the yéere 1494. and in the moneth of Ianuarie there
was an agréement made of the differences which were betwéene
the two kings of Spaine and Portugall. For the which
agréement there were ſent out of Portugall Ruy de So
                        •
                     a, and
Don Iohn his ſonne, and the Doctor Ayres de Almada: and
for the king of Spaine there were Don Henry Henriques,
Don Iohn de Cardenas, and the Doctor Maldonado. All theſe
met in the towne of Tordeſillas, and they deuided the world
frō the north to the ſouth by a meridian which ſtandeth weſt
from the Iſlands of Cape Verde 300. leagues:The firſt line of partition. ſo that the one
halfe which lay vnto the eaſt ſhould belong vnto Portugall,
and that which lay to the weſt to the king of Spaine, whereby
notwithſtanding libertie to trauell was left equall vnto
both.
               In the yéere following 1495. Iohn king of Portugall died,The death of Don Iohn the ſecond.
and Emmanuel his coſen began to reigne.
               In the yéere 1496. there was a Venetian in England called
Iohn Cabota,
                  The great diſcouerie of Iohn Cabota and the Engliſh. who hauing knowledge of ſuch a new diſcouerie
as this was, and perceiuing by the globe, that the

Iſlands before ſpoken of ſtood almoſt in the ſame latitude
with his countrey, and much néerer to England then to Portugall,
or to Caſtile, he acquainted king Henrie the ſeuenth
then king of England with the ſame, wherewith the ſaide
king was greatly pleaſed, and furniſhed him out with two
ſhips and thrée hundred men: which departed and ſet ſaile in
the ſpring of the yéere, and they ſailed weſtward til they came
in ſight of land in 45. degrées of latitude towards the north,
and then went ſtraight northwards till they came into 60.
degrées of latitude, where the day is 18. howers long, and the
night is very cléere and bright. There they found the aire
cold, and great Iſlands of ice, but no ground in an hundred
fathoms ſounding: and ſo from thence finding the land to
turne eaſtwards they trended along by it diſcouering all the
Bay and riuer named Deſeado, to ſee if it paſſed on the other
ſide: Then they ſailed backe againe till they came to 38. degrées
towards the Equinoctiall line,This is to the ſouth of the Cheſe
                        •
                     ian Bay. and from thence returned
into England. There he others which ſay, that he went as far
as the Cape of Florida, which ſtandeth in 25. degrées.
               In the yéere 1497. The king of Spaine Don Fernando ſent
out Chriſtopher Columbus with ſixe ſhips,Columbus third voiage. and he himſelfe
prouided two ſhips at his owne coſt,Gomara hiſtoriae general. lib. 2. cap. 21. and ſending his brother
before, he made ſaile from the Bay of Cadiz, carrying with
him his ſonne Don Diego Colon▪
                   It was then reported that
he went to take the Iſland of Madera, becauſe he miſtruſted
the French men, and therefore ſent thither thrée ſhips: others
ſay it was to the Canaries. But howſoeuer it was, this is
true, that he and thrée more went vnto the Iſlands of Cape
Verde, and ran along by the line finding great calmes and
raine, and the firſt land which they came vnto of the Antiles
was an Iſland ſtanding in 9. degrées of latitude towards the
north ioining faſt vnto the maine land, which they called La
Trinidada;
                  Trinidada. and ſo he entred into the Gulfe of Paria, and came
out of the mouth which they name Bocca de Dragone, or the
Dragons mouth: and they tooke their courſe hard by the coaſt,
where they found thrée ſmall Iſlands, which they named Los
Teſtigos,
                  Teſtigos. that is to ſay,Cubagua. 
                  The Witneſſes, beyond which ſtandeth
the Iſland of Cubagua, where is great fiſhing of muſcle
pearles: where alſo, as they ſay, there ſpringeth a Well of
aile: and beyond that Iſland they came to the Iſles of Frailes,

Roques,
                  Frailes, Roques, Aruba, Caraçao, &amp;c. 
                  Aruba, and Curaçao, with other ſmall ones all along
the Bay: and they came to the point of Cabo de Vela, and
diſcouered along the coaſt almoſt 200. leagues,Cabo de Vela. from whence
they croſſed ouer to Hiſpaniola, hauing had alſo ſight of the
Iſland called Beata.
                  Beata.
               
               In this ſame yéere 1497. on the 20. day of the moneth of
Iune one Vaſques de Gama ſailed from Lisbon by the king
Emmanuels commandement to India with 3. ſhips,Barros decad. 1. lib 4 cap. 2. and to the end of the 11. chapter. wherein
there went for captaines Vaſques de Gama, Paulus de Gama
his brother, and Nicolas Coello with 120. men; with whom
alſo there went one ſhip laden only with vittailes, and in 14.
daies they came vnto Cape Verde, vnto the Iſland of Saint
Iago, where they refreſhed themſelues, and from thence they
went along the coaſt beyond the Cape of Bona Sperança,
                  The Cape of Bona Sperança.
whereupon they erected certaine pillers of ſtone, and ſo came
vnto Moſambique ſtanding in 15. degrées to the ſouth of the
line,Moſambique. where they ſtaied not long, but went from thence to
Mombaza,
                  Mombaza. Melinde. and vnto Melinde: where the king of that place
gaue them pilots, which conducted them into India, in which
diſcouerie they found out Los Baxos do Padua,
                  Los Baxos de Padua. that is to ſay,
the flats of Padua.
               
               In the yéere 1498. in the moneth of May they came to an
anker before the citie of Calicut,
                  Calicut. and Panana, where they remained
all the winter: and the firſt day of September they
ſet ſaile towards the north diſcouering the coaſt all along till
they came to the Iſland of Angediua, which ſtandeth on that
ſide in 15. degrées of latitude, where they came to an anker
in the beginning of October, and ſo they departed from Angediua
in Februarie in the yéere 1499. and came in ſight of the
coaſt of Africa about Melinde towards the north 3. or 4. degrées,
&amp; from thence they ſailed vnto the ſaid citie, and ſo vnto
Moſambique againe, and to the Cape of Bona Sperança, ſailing
along by the coaſt, and then they came to the Iſlands of
Cape Verde, and laſt of al to the citie of Lisbon in the moneth
of September,Gomara hiſtoriae general lib. hauing béene in the voiage 26. monethes.
               In the yéere 1499 on the 13. day of the moneth of Nouember
there departed frō 
                  Palos one Vincent Yannez Pinſon and
his nephew Aries Pinſon with fower ſhips well appointed at
their owne coaſt and charges, to diſcouer the new world vnder
the licence of the king of Caſtile, and with commandement

not to touch there, where the Admirall Columbus had béene.
And ſo they went to the Iſlands of Cape Verde, and paſſed
the line to the ſouthward,The Cape of S. Auguſtine. and diſcouered the Cape of Saint
Auguſtine ſtanding on that ſide in 8. degrées of latitude, and
there they wrote on the rindes of pine trées the names of the
king and of the Quéene, alſo the yéere and day when they arriued
there. They fought with the people of Braſil, but got
nothing,Rio de Maria Tambal. they tooke their courſe all along the coaſt towards
the weſt vnto the riuer Maria Tambal, and at that time they
had taken thirty and odde priſoners.Angla de San Lucas. The chiefe places where
they touched were the Cape of S. Auguſtine, and the angle or
point of S. Luke,
                  The riuers of Marannon, Amazones and Rio Dolce. and Tierra de los Humos, the Riuers of Marannon,
and of the Amazones, and Rio dolce, or the Swéete
riuer, and other places along the coaſt: and they came to ten
degrées of latitude on the north ſide, where they loſt two ſhips
and their companie, and remained in that voiage of diſcouery
ten moneths, and 15. daies.
               In the yéere 1500. and in the moneth of March one Pedro
Aluarez Cabral ſailed out of Lisbon with 13. ſhips,Barros decad. 1. lib. 5 cap. 2. with commandement
not to come néere the coaſt of Africa to ſhorten
his way; and he loſing the ſight of one of his ſhips, went to
ſéeke her, and in ſéeking of her loſt his courſe, and ſailed till he
came within ſight of the land. The Generall was ſo long in
ſéeking his ſhip, that the companie were wearie of it, and entreated
him to leaue his enterpriſe. The next day they fell in
ſight of the coaſt of Braſil: whereupon the Generall commanded
a barke to goe to land and ſéeke an hauen: which they
did,Puerto Seguro in Braſil. and found a good and ſafe hauen, and they named it Puerto
Seguro, that is to ſay, The Safe hauen, ſtanding on the
ſouth ſide in 17. degrées of latitude. From thence they ſailed
towardes the Cape of Bona Sperança, and Melinde, and
croſſed ouer to the riuer of Cochin, which before was not
knowne, where they laded themſelues with pepper, and at
their returne Sancho de Thouar diſcouered the citie of Sofala
vpon the coaſt of Africa.
                  Sofala.
               
               In this ſame yéere 1500. it is reported that Gaſpar Cortereal
craued a generall licence of the king Emmanuel to diſcouer
the New found land. He went from the Iſland Terçera
with two ſhips well appointed at his owne coſt, and he ſailed
vnto that climate which ſtandeth vnder the north in 50.

degrées of latitude, which is a land nowe called after his

And making another time this voiage, the ſhip was loſt
wherein he went, and the other came backe into Portugall.
Wherefore his brother Michael Cortereal went to ſéeke him
with thrée ſhips well appointed at his owne coſt; and when
they came vnto that coaſt, and found ſo many entrances of
riuers,Many entrances of riuers in the northweſt. and hauens, euery ſhip went into her ſeuerall riuer,
with this rule and order, that they all thrée ſhould meete
againe the 20. day of Auguſt. The two other ſhips did ſo, and
they ſéeing that Michael Cortereal was not come at the day
appointed, nor yet afterwards in a certaine time, returned
backe into the realme of Portugall, and neuer heard any more
newes of him, nor yet any other memorie. But that countrey
is called The land of Cortereall vnto this day.
               In the yéere 1501. in the moneth of March Iohn de Noua
departed from the citie of Lisbon with fower ſhips,Barros decad. 1. lib. 5. cap. 10. and paſſed
the line on the ſouth ſide into 8. degrees of latitude, and he diſcouered
an Iſland,I

                     ha de Aſcenſion. which he called the Iſle de Aſcenſion: And
he went vnto Moſambique, and to Melinde, and from thence
he croſſed ouer vnto the other ſide, where they tooke lading,
and ſo came back and doubled the Cape, and found an Iſland
called Santa Helena,
                  The Iſle of Santa Helena. being but a ſmall thing, but yet of great
importance in reſpect of the ſituation thereof.
               In this ſame yéere 1501. and in the moneth of May there
departed out of Lisbon thrée ſhips vpon the commandement
of Emmanuel the king to diſcouer the coaſt of Braſil: and they
ſailed in the ſight of the Canaries, and from thence to Cape
Verde,
                  Bezequiche. where they refreſhed themſelues in the towne of Bezequiche,
and paſſed from thence beyond the line ſouthward
and fell with the land of Braſill in fiue degrées of latitude,Braſil diſcouered to 32. degrees.
and ſo went forward till they came in 32. degrées little more
or leſſe, according as they accounted it, and from thence they
came backe in the moneth of Aprill, becauſe it was there at
that time cold and tempeſtuous. They were in that voiage
fifteene monethes, and came to Lisbon againe in the beginning
of September 1502.

The next yéere following alſo one Roderigo Baſtidas of
Siuill went out with two carauels at his owne coſt, and the
firſt land of the Antiles that he ſaw was an Iſland which he
named Iſla Verde, that is, the Gréene Iſland, ſtanding faſt by
the Iſland of Guadalupe, towards the land: and from thence
they tooke their courſe towards the weſt to Santa Martha, and
Cape De la Vela, and to Rio Grande, or the Great riuer, and
they diſcouered the hauen of Zamba, the Coradas, Carthagena,
and the Iſlands of S. Barnard, of Baru, and Iſlas de Arenas,
and went forward vnto Iſla fuerte, and to the point of Caribana
ſtanding at the end of the Gulfe of Vraba, where they
had ſight of the Farrallones ſtanding on the other ſide hard by
the riuer of Darien, and from Cape De la Vela vnto this place
are two hundred leagues: and it ſtandeth in 9. degrées and
two parts of latitude. From thence they croſſed ouer vnto
the Iſland of Iamaica, where they refreſhed themſelues. In
Hiſpaniola they graued their ſhips becauſe of the holes which
certaine wormes of the water had eaten in the planks. In
that countrey they got fower hundred markes of golde, although
the people there be more warlike then in Noua Spania:
for they poiſon their arrowes which they ſhoote.
               In this ſame yéere 1502. Chriſtopher Columbus entred the
fourth time into his diſcouerie with fower ſhips at the commandement
of Don Fernando to ſéeke the Streight,The fourth voiage of Columbus. which

carried with him Ferdinando his ſonne. They went firſt to
the Iſland of Hiſpaniola, to Iamaica, to the riuer Azua, to the
Cape of Higueras,
                  Cabo de Higueras. and vnto the Iſlands Gamares, and to the
Cape of Hunduras,
                  Cabo de Hunduras. that is to ſay, the Cape of the Depthes:
from thence they ſailed towards the eaſt vnto the Cape Gracias
a Dios,
                  Cabo Gracias a Dios. and diſcouered the prouince and riuer of Veragua,
and Rio Grande,
                  Veragua. and others, which the Indians call Hienra.
And from thence he went to the riuer of Crocodiles, which
now is called Rio de Chagres,
                  Rio de Chagres. which hath his ſprings néere
the South Sea, within fower leagues of Panama, and runneth
into the North Sea: and ſo he went vnto the Iſland
which he called Iſla de Baſtimentos,
                  Iſla de Baſtimentos. that is the Iſle of Victuailes,
Puerto Bello. and then to Puerto Bello, that is the Faire hauen, and
ſo vnto Nombre de Dios,
                  Nombre de Dios. and to Rio Franciſco, and ſo to the
hauen of Retrete, and then to the Gulfe of Cabeſa Cattiua,
                  
and to the Iſlands of Caperoſa,
                  The Cape of marble. and laſtly to the Cape of Marble,
which is two hundred leagues vpon the coaſt: from
whence they began to turne againe vnto the Iſland of Cuba,
and from thence to Iamaica, where he grounded his ſhips being
much ſpoiled and eaten with wormes.
               In this yéere alſo 1502 Don Vaſques de Gama being now
Admirall went againe into India with 19. or 20. Carauels.Barros decad. 1. lib. 6. cap. 2.
He departed from Lisbon the tenth day of Februarie, and by
the laſt day of that moneth he came to an anker at Cape Verde,
                  The Iſland of Moſambique. and from thence he went vnto Moſambique, and was the
firſt that croſt from that Iſland into India: and he diſcouered
another in 4. degrées of latitude, which he called the Iſland of
the Admirall, and there he tooke his lading of pepper and
drugs, and left there one Vincent Sodre to kéepe the coaſt of
India with fiue ſhips.
               Theſe were the firſt Portugals, that with an armie did run
along the coaſt of Arabia Foelix. It is there ſo barren, that
their cattell and camels are onely maintained with drie fiſh
brought from the ſea;Cattell and camels led with dried fiſh. whereof there is ſuch plenty and abundance,
that the cats of the countrey doe vſe to take them.
               In the yeere following, as it is reported, one Antonie de
Saldanta diſcouered the Iſland which in old time was called
Coradis,
                  Socotora. and now Socotora, and the Cape of Guardafu, which
adioineth vnto that countrey.Cape de Guardafu.
               
               In the yéere 1504. Roderigo de Baſtidas obtained licence
of king Ferdinando, and by the meanes of Iohn de Lodeſma
and others of Siuill armed and furniſhed out two ſhips, hauing
for his pilot one Iohn de Coſa of Saint Marie Port, and
he went to diſcouer that part of Tierra firma where now ſtandeth
Carthagena,
                  Carthagena. being in ten degrées and a halfe of northerly
latitude. And it is ſaid that they found the captaine Luis de
la Guerra;
                  Codego. and they together tooke land in the Iſle of Codego,
where they tooke ſixe hundred perſons of the Sauages: And
going farther along the coaſt they entred into the Gulfe of
Vraba, where they found ſand mingled with gold, being
the firſt that was brought to the king Don Ferdinando: from
thence they returned to the citie of Santo Domingo laden
with ſlaues without victuailes, becauſe they of the countrey
would not bargaine with them, which grew to their great
trouble and griefe.
               
                  
In the later end of this yéere died Ladie Iſabella Quéene of

man of Arragon, Catalunia, Valencia, nor any borne in the
countrey of Don Fernando her huſband to enter into theſe
diſcoueries, ſaue thoſe which were their ſeruants, or by ſpeciall
commandement, but only the Caſtillians, Biſcaines, &amp; thoſe
which were of her owne Signiories, by whom all the lands
aforeſaid were diſcouered.
               In the yéere 1505. vpon our Lady day in March Franciſco
de Almeida Viceroy of India tooke his courſe with 22. ſailes
towards India as now is accuſtomed.Barros decad. 1. lib. 8. cap. 3. He came vnto the citie
of Quiloa,
                  A fort built in Quiloa. where he built a fort, appointing one Peter Fereira
to be captaine thereof: and beyond Melinde he trauerſed to
the Iſland of Angediua,
                  Angediua poſſeſſed. where he placed as captaine one Emmanuell
Paſſauia.
                  Forts builded in Cananor and in Cochin. In Cananor alſo he built another fort, giuing
the captainſhip of it to Laurence de Brito. In Cochin he
did the like, where Don Alfonſo de Noronia was made captaine.
A fort builded in Sofala. This yéere one Peter de Anhaya did build the fortreſſe
of Sofala, whereof alſo himſelfe was made captaine.
               In the later end of this yéere the Viceroy commanded his
ſonne, whoſe name was Don Laurenço to make ſome entrie
vpon the Iſlands of Maldiua, and with contrarie weather he
arriued at the Iſlands, which of ancient time were called
Traganae, but the Moores called them Ytterubenero, and we
call them Ceilan:
                  Ceilan. where he went on land, and made peace
with the people there, and afterward came backe vnto Cochin,
ſailing along the coaſt and fully diſcouering it. In the
middeſt of this Iſland there ſtands a rocke of ſtone very high
hauing the ſigne of the foote of a man vpon the top of it, which
they ſay to be the footeſtep of Adam, when he went vp into
the heauens, and the Indians haue it in great reuerence.
               In the yéere 1506. after the death of the Quéene of Spaine,
king Philip and Quéene Ioan his wife came into Spaine to
take poſſeſſion thereof, and king Don Fernando went into
Arragon being his owne patrimonie.The death of Philip the firſt king of Spaine 1506. In this ſame yeere the

Columbus died, and his ſonne Don Diego Columbus ſucceeded

in his roome.
               In the yéere 1506. and entring into the moneth of March
Triſtan de Acunna and Alfonſo de Albuquerque went into
India with 14. ſhips in their companie,Barros decad. 2. lib. 1. cap. 1. and ſailed till they
came to an anker at the towne of Bezequiche,
                  Bezequiche is by Cape Verde. where they
refreſhed themſelues: and before they came to the Cape of
Bona Sperança in 37. degrées they found certaine Iſlands,
which now are named the Iſles of Triſtan de Acunna,
                  The Iſles of Triſtan de Acunna in 37. degrees. where
they had ſuch a tempeſt that therewithall the fléete was diſperſed.
Triſtan de Acun̄a and Alfonſo de Albuquerque went
vnto Moſambique, and Aluaro Telez ran ſo far that he came
to the Iſland of Samatra,
                  Samatra diſcouered. and ſo backe againe vnto the Cape
of Guardatu; hauing diſcouered many Iſlands, ſea, and land
neuer ſéene before that time of any Portugall. Emmanuel Telez
de Meneſes was alſo driuen without the great Iſland of
S. Laurence, and he ran along the coaſt thereof, and arriued
at laſt at Moſambique, and there met with Triſtan de Acun̄a,
who was the firſt captaine that wintred there; and by them
it was told, that in this Iſland was much Ginger, Cloues,
and ſiluer:The Inland of S. Laurence diſcouered. whereupon he went and diſcouered much of it
within the land; but finding nothing he came backe againe
vnto Moſambique; from whence he ſailed vnto Melinde, and
ran along that coaſt and entred into Braua,
                  Braua. and from thence
they croſt ouer to the Iſland of Socotora,
                  A fortreſſe builded in Soc

fortreſſe,Barros decad. 2. lib. 2. cap. 1. and made one Don Antonio de Noronia captaine
thereof.
               In the yéere 1507. in the moneth of Auguſt Triſtan de Acun̄a
tooke ſhipping for India, and Alfonſo de Albuquerque
remained there with fiue or ſixe ſhips to kéepe the coaſt and
entrie of the Streight; but being not therewith ſatiſfied he
tooke his courſe ouer vnto Arabia, and running along that
coaſt he doubled the Cape of Roſalgate ſtanding vnder the
Tropicke of Cancer.
                  The Cape of Roſalgate.
               
               In the yeere 1509. one Diego Lopez de Sequeira went
out of Lisbon with fower ſailes vnto the Iſland of Saint Laurence,

moneth of May the ſame yéere he arriued in Cochin, where
the Viceroy gaue him one ſhip more: and in the beginning of
the moneth of September he tooke his courſe vnto Malacca
paſſing betwéene the Iſlands of Nicubar,
                  The Iſlands of Nicubar. and many others:

He went alſo to the land of Samatra to the cities of Pedir and
Pacem,
                  Samatra. and all along by all that coaſt vnto the Iſland of A
Poluoreira,
                  The Iſle of A Poluoreira. and the flats of Capacia: and from thence he
went ouer vnto Malacca ſtanding in 2. degrées of latitude
towards the north:The flats of Capacia. but in that citie the people killed and tooke
as priſoners ſome of his men:Malacca. and thereupon he turned backe
againe into India, hauing diſcouered in this voiage fiue hundred
leagues.Rarities in Samatra. This Iſland of Samatra is the firſt land wherein
we knew mans fleſh to be eaten by certaine people which
liue in the mountaines called Bacas, who vſe to gilde their
téeth. They hold opinion that the fleſh of the blacke people
is ſwéeter then the fleſh of the white.In Samatra buffes, kine, and hennes haue fleſh as blacke as inke. The buffes, kine, and
hennes which are in that countrey are in their fleſh as blacke
as any inke. They ſay that there are certaine people there
called Daraqui Dara,
                  People hauing tailes like ſheepe. which haue tailes like vnto ſhéepe; and
ſome of their welles yéeld oile.
               The king of Pedir is reported to haue a riuer in his land
running with oile: which is a thing not to be maruelled at,
ſéeing it is found written, that in Bactria there is alſo a well
of oile: it is farther ſaid that there groweth here a trée, the
iuice whereof is ſtrong poiſon, and if it touch the blood of a
man, he dieth immediately: but if a man doe drinke of it,
it is a ſoueraigne remedie againſt poiſon, ſo ſeruing both for
life and death.Gold coined in Samatra. Here alſo they doe coine péeces of gold, which
they call Drachmas, brought into the land as they ſay by the
Romanes: which ſéemeth to haue ſome reſemblance of truth:
becauſe that from that place forward there is no coined gold:
but that which is thus coined doth run currant in the buying
of marchandiſe and other things.

of Don Fernando purpoſed to goe vnto Tierra firma to conquer
the prouince of Darien.

&amp; diſcouered The Firme land, where it is called Vraba,
which he named Caſtilia del Oro,
                  Caſtilia del oro. that is Golden Caſtilia,
bicauſe of the gold which they found among the ſand along
the coaſt: And they were the firſt Spanyards that did this.
Alfonſo de Hoieda went firſt from the Iſland of Hiſpaniola
and the citie of San Domingo with fower ſhips and thrée
hundred ſoldiers,The booke of the Bachiler Anciſo of theſe diſcoueries. leauing behinde him the bachiler Anciſo,
who afterwards compiled a booke of theſe diſcoueries. And

after him there went alſo one ſhip with victuals, munition,
and 150. Spanyards. He went on land at Carthagena: but
there the people of the countrey tooke, ſlew and eate 70. of his
ſoldiers, whereupon he grew very weake.
               In this yéere 1508. one Drego de Niqueſa prepared ſeuen
ſhips in the port of Beata to goe vnto Veragua,

them almoſt 800. men. When he came to Carthagena he
found there Alfonſo de Hoieda ſore ſpoiled with his former
loſſe: but then they both ioined together, and went on land
and auenged themſelues of the people. And in this voiage
Diego de Niqueſa went and diſcouered the coaſt called Nombre
de Dios, and went vnto the ſound of Darien, and called it
Puerto de Miſas,
                  Gomara gen. hiſt. lib. 3. cap. 6. which is vpon the riuer of Pito. When they
were come vnto Veragua, he went on ſhore with his armie,
his ſoldiers being out of hope to returne to Hiſpaniola. Alfonſo
de Hoieda began a fortreſſe in Caribana againſt the Caribes;
which was the firſt towne that the Spanyards builded
in the Firme land:Nueſtra Sennora de la antigua builded. and in Nombre de Dios they built another,
and called it Nueſtra Sennora de la Antigua. They builded
alſo the towne of Vraba. And there they left for their captaine
and lieutenant one Francis Piſarro, who was there
much troubled. They builded other towns alſo, whoſe names
I here omit. But theſe captaines had not that good ſucceſſe
which they hoped for.
               In the yéere 1509. the ſecond Admirall Don Diego Columbus
went into the Iſland of Hiſpaniola with his wife and
houſhold:Many gentlewomen went to dwell in Hiſpaniola. And ſhe being a gentlewoman carried with her
many other women of good families, which were there married,
and ſo the Spanyards and Caſtillians began to people the
countrey: for Don Fernando the king had giuen them licence
to diſcouer and people the townes of Hiſpaniola; ſo that the
ſame place grew to be famous and much frequented. The
foreſaid. Admirall alſo gaue order to people the Iſland of
Cuba,
                  Cuba peopled. which is very great and large, and placed there as his
lieutenant one Diego Velaſques, who went with his father
in the ſecond voiage.
               In the yéere 1511. in the moneth of Aprill Alfonſo de Albuquerque
went from the citie of Cochin vnto Malaeca.
                  Barros decad. 2. lib. 5 cap 10. &amp; lib. 6. cap. 2. In
which yéere and moneth the Chineans went from Malaeca
into their owne countrey,Barros decad. 2. lib. 6. cap. 5. and Alfonſo sent with them for

maſter a Portugall called Duarte Fernandes, with letters alſo
and order vnto the king of the Mantias, which now is called
Sian ſtanding in the South.The Streight of Cincapura. They paſſed through the ſtreight
of Cincapura, and ſailed towards the north, went along the
coaſt of Patane vnto the citie of Cuy,
                  Odia the chiefe citie of Sian. and from thence to Odia
which is the chiefe citie of the kingdome, ſtanding in 14. degrées
of northerly latitude. The king greatly honoured and
welcomed Duarte Fernandes, being the firſt Portugall that
he had ſéene, and with him he ſent backe ambaſſadours to Albuquerque.
They paſſed ouer land towards the weſt vnto the
citie of Tanaçerim ſtanding vpon the ſea on the other ſide in
12. degrées,Tanaçerim. where they imbarked themſelues in two ſhips,
and ſailed along the coaſt vnto the citie of Malacca, leauing it
all diſcouered.

round bels within the ſkin of their priuie members: which
is forbidden to the king and the religious people. It is ſaid
that of all other people of thoſe parts they be moſt vertuous
and honeſt. They commend themſelues much for their chaſtitie
and pouertie. They bring no heunes nor doues vp in
their houſes. This kingdome hath in length 250. leagues,
and in bredth 80. Of this only kingdome the king may bring
foorth into the field thirtie thouſand elephants, when he goeth
to warre, beſides thoſe which remaine in the cities for the
garde of them. The king much eſtéemeth a white elephant,
and a red one alſo, that hath eies like vnto flaming fire.
               There is in this countrey a certaine ſmall vermine, which
vſeth to cleaue faſt to the trunke of the elephant, and draweth
the blood of the elephant, and ſo he dieth thereof. The ſkull of
this vermine is ſo hard, that the ſhot of an handgun cannot
enter it: they haue in their liuers the figures of men and women,
which they call Toke

about him cannot die with the ſtroke of any iron. They haue
alſo wilde kine in this countrey, in the heads of whome they
finde ſtones, which are of vertue to bring good hap and fortune
to marchants.
               After that Duarte Fernandes had béen with the Mantales or
people of Sian, Alfonſo de Albuquerque ſent thither a knight

called Ruy Nunnez de Acunna with letters and ambaſſage
vnto the king of the Seguies,
                  Pegu. which we call Pegu. He went in
a Iunco of the countrey in ſight of the Cape Rachado, and
from thence went vnto the citie of Pera which ſtandeth faſt

                  Alfonſo de Albuquerque
ſent thrée ſhips to the Iſlands of Banda,
                  The Iſles of Banda and Maluco. and Maluco. And
there went as Generall of them one Antonio de Breu, and
with him alſo went one Francis Serrano: and in theſe ſhips
there were 120. perſons. They paſſed through the Streight
of Saban, and along the Iſland of Samatra, and others, leauing
them on the left hand, towards the eaſt: and they called
them the Salites.
                  The Salites. They went alſo to the Iſlands of Palinibam
and La Suparam; from whence they ſailed by the noble Iſland
of Iaua,
                  Iaua. and they ran their courſe eaſt, ſailing betweene it and
the Iſland of Madura.
                  Madura. The people of this Iſland are very
warlike and ſtrong, and doe little regard their liues. The women
alſo are there hired for the warres: and they fall out often
together, and kill one another, as the Mocos doe, delighting
onely in ſhedding of blood.
               Beyond the Iſland of Iaua they ſailed along by another
called Bali:
                  Bali. and then came alſo vnto others called Aujaue,
çambaba, Solor,
                  Or Guliam. 
                  Galao, Mallua, Vitara, Roſalangum, &amp;Or Aru. 
                  Arus,
from whence are brought delicate birds, which are of great
eſtimation becauſe of their feathers: they came alſo to other
Iſlands lying in the ſame parallele on the ſouth ſide in 7. or
8. degrées of latitude. And they be ſo nere the one to the other,
that they ſéeme at the firſt to be one entire and maine land.
The courſe by theſe Iſlands is aboue fiue hundred leagues.
The ancient Coſmographers call all theſe Iſlands by the
name Iauos: but late experience hath found their names to
be very diuers, as you ſee. Beyonde theſe there are other
Iſlands toward the north, which are inhabited with whiter

people going arraied in ſhirts,The people of the Iſles of Maluco weare ſuch apparell. doublets and ſlops like vnto
the Portugals, hauing alſo money of ſiluer. The gouernours
among them doe carrie in their hands red ſtaues,Gouernours carrying red ſtaues like thoſe of China. whereby
they ſéeme to haue ſome affinitie with the people of China.
There are other Iſlands and people about this place, which
are redde; and it is reported that they are of the people of
China.
               
               
                  Antonie de Breu and thoſe that went with him tooke their
courſe toward the north, where is a ſmal Iſland called Gumnape
or Ternate,
                  Ternate. from the higheſt place whereof there fall
continually into the ſea flakes or ſtreames like vnto fire;
which is a woonderfull thing to behold.Burro. From thence they
went to the Iſlands of Burro and Amboino,
                  Amboino. and came to an
anker in an hauen of it called Guliguli,
                  Guliguli. where they went on
land and tooke a village ſtanding by the riuer, where they
found dead men hanging in the houſes; for the people there
are eaters of mans fleſh. Here the Portugals burnt the ſhip
wherein Francis Serrano was, for ſhe was old and rotten.
They went to a place on the other ſide ſtanding in 8. degrées
toward the ſouth,Cloues, nutmegs, and mace in 8. degrees toward the ſouth. where they laded cloues, nutmegs, and
mace in a Iunco or barke which Francis Serrano bought
here.
               They ſay that not farre from the Iſlands of Banda there is
an Iſland, where there bréedeth nothing elſe but ſnakes, and
the moſt are in one caue in the middeſt of the land. This is a
thing not much to be woondred at; for as much as in the Leuant
ſea hard by the Iſles of Maiorca and Minorca there is
another Iſland of old named Ophi
                        •
                     ſa, and now Formentera,
wherein there is great abundance of theſe vermine: and in
the reſt of the Iſlands lying by it there are none.
               In the yéere 1512. they departed from Banda toward Malacea,
and on the baxos or flats of Luçapinho Francis Serrano
periſhed in his Iunke or barke, from whence eſcaped
vnto the Iſle of Mindanao nine or ten Portugals which were
with him,Mindanao. and the kings of Maluco ſent for them.Maluco. Theſe were
the firſt Portugals that came to the Iſlands of Cloues, which
ſtand from the Equinoctiall line towardes the north in one
degrée, where they liued ſeuen or eight yeeres.
               The Iſland of Gumnape now called Ternate is much to
be admired, for that it caſteth out fire. There were ſome

princes of the Moores and couragious Portugals which determined
to goe néere to the firie place to ſée what it was; but
they could neuer come néere it. But Antonie Galuano hearing
of it, vndertooke to goe vp to it, and did ſo, and found a riuer
ſo extreme cold, that he could not ſuffer his hand in it, nor
yet put any of the water in his mouth: And yet this place
ſtandeth vnder the line, where the ſunne continually burneth.
In theſe Iſlands of Maluco there is a kinde of men that haue
ſpurres on their ankles like vnto cocks.Monſtrous men. And it was told me
by the king of Tydore,
                  Batochina. that in the Iſlands of Batochina there
were people that had tailes, and had a thing like vnto a dug
betwéen their cods, out of the which there came milke. There
are ſmal hennes alſo which lay their egges vnder the ground
aboue a fathome and an halfe, and the egges are bigger then
ducks egges, and many of theſe hennes are blacke in their
fleſh. There are hogs alſo with hornes, and parats which
prattle much, which they call Noris. There is alſo a riuer of
water ſo hot, that whatſoeuer liuing creature cōmeth into it,
their ſkins will come off, and yet fiſh bréede in it. There are
crabs which be very ſwéete, and ſo ſtrong in their clawes,
that they will breake the iron of a pik
                     •
                  axe. There be others
alſo in the ſea little and hairie, but whoſoeuer eateth of them
dieth immediately. There be likewiſe certaine oiſters, which
they doe call Bras, the ſhels whereof haue ſo large a compaſſe,
that they doe Chriſten in them. In the ſea alſo there are liuely
ſtones, which doe grow and increaſe like vnto fiſh, whereof
very good lime is made: and if they let it lie when it is taken
out of the water, it looſeth the ſtrength, and it neuer burneth
after.The flowers of Xiſtus and Arbor 
                        〈◊〉
                      are ſuch. There is alſo a certaine trée, which beareth flowers at
the ſunne ſet, which fall downe as ſoone as they be growne.
There is a fruit alſo, as they ſay, whereof if a woman that is
conceaued of childe eateth, the childe by &amp; by mooueth. There
is further a kinde of herbe there growing, which followeth
the ſunne, and remooueth after it, which is a very ſtrange and
maruailous thing.
               In the yéere 1512. in the moneth of Ianuarie Alfonſus de
Albuquerque went backe from Malaca vnto Goa,
                  Barros decad 2. lib. 7. cap. 1. and the
ſhip wherein he went was loſt, and the reſt went from his
companie.The Iſles of Maldiua. 
                  Simon de Andrada, and a few Portugals were driuen
vnto the Iſlands of Maldiua being many &amp; full of palme

trées: and they ſtand lowe by the water: which ſtaied there
till they knew what was become of their gouernour. Theſe
were the firſt Portugals that had ſéene thoſe Iſlands, wherein
there growe Cocos, which are very good againſt all kinde of
poiſon.
               In this yéere 1512. there went out of Caſtile one Iohn de
Solis borne in Lisbon,
                  Iohn de Solis. and chiefe pilot vnto Don Fernando.
And he hauing licence went to diſcouer the coaſt of Braſill.
He tooke the like courſe that the Pinſons had done: he went
alſo to the Cape of S. Auguſtine, and went forwards to the
ſouth, coaſting the ſhore and land, and he came vnto The
Port De Lagoa: and in 35. degrées of ſoutherly latitude he
found a riuer which they of Braſill call Parana-guaçu, that is,
The great Water. He ſawe there ſignes of ſiluer, and therefore
called it Rio de Plata,
                  Rio de Plata. that is, The Riuer of ſiluer. And it
is ſaid that at that time he went farther becauſe he liked the
countrey well: but he returned backe againe into Spaine,
and made account of all things to Don Fernando, demaunding
of the king the gouernment thereof, which the king
granted him.Pet. Martyr. decad. 3 cap. 10. Whereupon he prouided thrée ſhips and with
them in the yéere 1515. he went againe into that kingdome;
but he was there ſlaine. Theſe Soliſſes were great diſcouerers
in thoſe partes, and ſpent therein their liues and
goods.
               In the ſame yéere 1512. Iohn Ponce of Leon, which had
béene goueruour of the Iſle of S. Iohn armed two ſhips and
went to ſéeke the Iſle of Boyuca, where the naturals of the
countrey reported to be a Wel,Pet. Martyr. decad. 2 cap 10. which maketh old men yoong.
Whereupon he laboured to finde it out,Gomara hiſtoriae general. lib. 2. cap. 10. and was in ſearching
of it the ſpace of ſixe monethes, but could finde no ſuch thing.
He entred into the Iſle of Bimini;
                  Bimini Iſlands. and diſcouered a point of
the firme land ſtanding in 25. degrées towards the north vpon
Eaſter day,Florida. and therefore he named it Florida. And becauſe
the land ſéemed to yeeld gold and ſiluer and great riches,Martyr. decad. 3. cap. 10. he
begged it of the king Don Fernando, but he died in the diſcouerie
of it, as many more haue done.
               In the yéere 1513. Vaſco Nunnes de Valboa hearing
ſpéech and newes of The ſouth ſea,Pet Mart

                     ad. 3. cap. 1. determined to goe thither,
although his companie diſſuaded him from that action. But
being a man of good valure with thoſe ſoldiers that he had,

being 290. he reſolued to put himſelfe into that ieoperdie. He
went therefore from Dariene the firſt day of September, carrying
ſome Indians of the countrey with him to be his guides,
and he marched ouerthwart the land ſometimes quietly,
ſometimes in war: and in a certaine place called Careca he
found Negroes captiues with curled haire.The South ſea diſ

came to the ſight of the South Sea on the 25. day of the ſaid
moneth, and on Saint Michaels day came vnto it: where he
imbarked himſelfe againſt the will of Chiapes, who was the
Lord of that coaſt, who wiſhed him not to doe ſo, becauſe it
was very dangerous for him. But he deſirous to haue it
knowne, that he had béene vpon thoſe ſeas, went forwards,
and came backe againe to land in ſafetie, and with great contentment,
bringing with him good ſtore of gold, ſiluer, and
pearles, which there they tooke. For which good ſeruice of his
Don Ferdinando the king greatly fauoured and honoured
him.
               This yéere 1513. in the moneth of Februarie Alfonſus de
Albuquerque went frō the citie of Goa towards the ſtreight
of Mecha with twenty ſhips.Barro

Streight. They ſay that they ſaw a croſſe in the element and
worſhipped it.The Iſle of Camaran. They wintered in the Iſland of Camaran▪
                  
This was the firſt Portugall captaine that gaue information
of thoſe ſeas, and of that of Perſia, being things in the world
of great account.
               In the yéere 1514. and in the moneth of May there went
out of Saint Lu

of Don Ferdinando.
                  Pet. Martyr. decad. 3. cap. 5. He was the fourth gouernour
of Caſtillia del Oro or Golden Caſtile: for ſo they named the
countreyes of Dariene, Carthagena, and Vraba, and that
countrey which was newly conquered. He carried with him
his wife the Lady Elizabeth and 1500. men in ſeuen ſhips;
and the king appointed Vaſco Nunnez de Valboa gouernour
of the South Sea and of that coaſt.
               In the beginning of the yéere 1515. the gouernour Pedro
Arias de Auila ſent one Gaſpar Morales with 150. men vnto
the Gulfe of S. Michael to diſcouer the Iſlands of Tararequi,
Chiapes, and Tumaccus. There was a Caſique Valboas friend
which gaue him many Canoas or boates made of one trée to

rowe in,The Iſland of Tararequi or of pearles in the South ſea. wherein they paſſed vnto The Iſland of pearles: the
Lord whereof reſiſted them at their comming on land. But
Chiapes and Tumaccus did pacifie him in ſuch order, that the
captaine of the Iſle had them home vnto his houſe,Martyr. decad. 3. cap. 10. and made
much of them,Gomara hiſtoria

him Pedro Arias after the gouernours name, and he gaue vnto
them for this a baſket full of pearles waying 110. pounds,
whereof ſome were as big as haſell nuts of 20. 25. 26. or 31.

one of them 1200. ducats. This Iſland of Tararequi ſtandeth
in 5. degrées of latitude towards the north.
               In this yéere 1515. in the moneth of March the gouernour
ſent one Gonſaluo de Badaios with 80. ſoldiers to diſcouer
new lands, and they went from Dariene to Nombre de Dios,
where came vnto them one Lewis de Mercado with fiftie
men more, which the gouernour ſent to aide him. They determined
to diſcouer toward the South,Pet. Martyr. decad. 3. cap. 1

                     . ſaying that that countrey
was the richeſt. They tooke with them Indians to be their
guides, and going along the coaſt they found ſlaues marked
with irons as the Portugals doe vſe; and hauing marched a
good way through the countreyes with great trauaile they
gathered together much golde and fortie ſlaues to doe them
ſeruice: but one Caſique named Pariza did ſet vpon them and
ſlue and tooke the moſt part of them.
               The gouernour hearing of theſe newes, the ſame yéere
1515. ſent foorth his ſonne Iohn Arias de Auila to be reuenged
and to diſcouer alſo by ſea and by land: They went weſtward
to Cape De Guerra ſtanding in little more then ſixe
degrées towards the north,Cape de Guerra. and from thence vnto Punta de
Borica,

thence towards China with eight ſailes fower Portugals and
the others Malayans.
                  China diſcouered. He arriued in China: And becauſe he
could not come on land without an ambaſſage, there was one
Thomas Perez which had order for it: and he went from the
citie of Canton,
                  Canton. where they came to an anker: They went by
land fower hundred leagues, and came vnto the citie ofOr Pakin.

the king his maſter had commanded him. And although one
Raphael Pereſtrello had beene there in a Iunke or barke of
certaine marchants of Malaca, yet vnto Fernando Perez
there ought to be giuen the praiſe of this diſcouerie: as well
for that he had commandement from the king, as in diſcouering

their owne proper charges from the Iſland of Cuba. They
had alſo with them a barke of Diego Velaſques, who then
was gouernour:Iucatan. They came on land in Iucatan ſtanding in
20. degrées of latitude at a point which they called Punta de
las Duennas, that is to ſay, The point of Ladies, which was
the firſt place wherein they had ſéen Temples and buildings
of lime and ſtone. The people here goe better apparelled then
in any other place. They haue croſſes which they worſhip,
ſetting them vpon their tombes when they be buried. Wherby
it ſéemeth that in times paſt they had in that place the
faith of Chriſt among them. And ſome ſay that thereabouts
were The ſeuen Cities.
                  The Seuen cities. They went round about it towards
the north which is on the right hand: from whence they turned
backe vnto the Iſland of Cuba with ſome examples of
gold, and men which they had taken. And this was the firſt
beginning of the diſcouerie of New Spaine.
               
               In the yéere 1518. Lopez Suares commanded Don Iohn
de Silueira to goe to the Iſlands of Maldiua:

peace with them:Oſorius lib. 11. fol. 315. pag. 2. and from thence he went to the citie of
Chatigam ſituated on the mouth of the riuer Ganges vnder
the Tropicke of Cancer.
                  Chatigam in Bengala. For this riuer, and the riuer Indus,
which ſtandeth an hundred leagues beyond the citie of Diu,
and that of Canton in China doe all fall int the ſea vnder one
parallele or latitude. And although before that time Fernan
Perez had béen commanded to goe to Bengala, yet notwithſtanding
Iohn de Silueira ought to beare away the commendation
of this diſcouerie: becauſe he went as captaine generall,
and remained there longeſt, learning the commodities of
the countrey, and maners of the people.

               In the ſame yéere 1518. one Francis Garay armed thrée
ſhips in the Iſle of Iamaica at his owne charges,Gomar. hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 12. &amp; 61 and went
towards the point of Florida ſtanding in 25. degrées towards
the north, ſéeming to them to be an Iſland moſt pleaſant,
thinking it better to people Iſlands then the firme land, becauſe
they could beſt conquere them and kéepe them. They
went there on land, but the people of Florida killed many of
them, ſo that they durſt not inhabite it. So they ſailed along
the coaſt,Panuco. and came vnto the riuer of Panuco, ſtanding 500.
leagues from the point of Florida in ſailing along the coaſt;
but the people reſiſted them in euery place. Many of them
alſo were killed in Chila, whom the Sauages flaied and eate,
hanging vp their ſkinnes in their Temples in memoriall of
their valiantnes. Notwithſtanding all thi

went thither the next yéere and begged the gouernment of
that countrey of the Emperour, becauſe he ſawe in it ſome
ſhew of gold and ſiluer.
               In the yeere 1519. in the moneth of Februarie Fernando
Cortes went from the Iſland of Cuba to the land which is
called Noua Spania with 11. ſhips and 550. Spanyards in
them.Pet. Martyr. decad. 4. cap. 6. The firſt place where he went on land was the Iſland
of Coſumel; where they immediately deſtroied all the Idols,
and ſet croſſes on the altars and the images of the virgine
Marie.
                  Gomar. hiſt. gen lib. 2. cap. 18. &amp;c. From this Iſland they went and arriued on the firme
land of Iucatan, at the point De las Duen
                        •
                     as, or the point of
Ladies,Tauaſco. and went thence to the riuer of Tauaſco, and ſet vpon
a citie faſt by called Potoncian inuironed with wood,Potoncian now called Victoria. and
the houſes were built with lime and ſtone, and couered with
tile: they fought there egarly; and there appeered vnto
them S. Iames on horſebacke, which increaſed their courage.
They called that citie Victoria: and they were the firſt people

which were ſubdued to the Spanyards obedience in all Newe
Spaine. From hence they went diſcouering the coaſt till they
came vnto a place named S. Iohn de Vllhua,
                  S. Iohn de Vllhua diſtant as they
ſaid from Mexico where the king Muteçuma was, 60. or 70.
leagues: and there was a ſeruant of his that gouerned that
prouince, named Tendilli, which gaue them good entertainment,
although they vnderſtood not one another. But Cortes
had 20. women, whereof one was called Marine borne in
tha
                     •
                   countrey: They were the firſt that were baptized in New
Spaine. And from that time forward Marine and Aguilar
ſerued as interpreters. Tendilli preſently gaue knowledge
of this vnto Muteçuma, that a kinde of bearded people were
arriued in his countrey: for ſo they called the Caſtillians. But
he was troubled vpon that newes: for his Gods, (which are
to be thought to be diuels) had told him, that ſuch people as
the Spanyards were ſhould deſtroy his law and countrey, and
be Lords thereof. And therefore he ſent gifts vnto Cortes, in
value 20. thouſand ducats, but would not come to him.
               Becauſe S. Iohn de Vllhua was then no place for a nauie
to ride in, Cortes ſent Francis de Mont

                     io, and the pilot Antonie
Alaminos in two brigandines to diſcouer that coaſt; who
came to a place where they might ride without danger.
They came to Panuco ſtanding in 23. degrées northward:Gomara hiſtoriae general. lib. 2. cap. 21. 22. 23▪ 24.
from whence they came backe vpon an agreement to goe vnto
Culuacan being an hauen of more ſafetie. They ſet ſaile,
but Cortes went by land weſtward with the moſt part of his
men on horſebacke,Zempoallan. and they came vnto a citie called Zempoallan;
where they were well receiued. And from thence he
went to another towne called Chiauitztlan:
                  Chiauitztlan. with the Lord
of which towne as with all the countrey beſides he made
league to be againſt Muteçuma. And when he knew that
his ſhips were come, he went vnto them, and there builded
a towne,Villa rica de la vera Cruz. and called it Villa rica de la vera cruz. From whence
he ſent vnto Charles the Emperour a preſent, and made report
of all that he had done, and how he determined to goe to
Mexico, and to viſite Muteçuma: and beſought the Emperour
to giue him the gouernment of that countrey. And becauſe
his people ſhould not riſe in mutinie, as they began, he
deſtroied all his ſhips.
               
                  Cortes preſently went from Villa rica de la vera Cruz, leauing

there 150. Spaniſh horſemen, and many Indians to ſerue
them; and the villages round about became his friends. He
went vnto the citie of Zempoallan:
                  Gomara hiſtoriae general. lib. 2. cap. 61. there he heard newes
that Francis Garay was on the coaſt with fower ſhips to
come on land: And by ſubtiltie he got nine of his men; of
whom he vnderſtood, that Garay had béene in Florida, and
came vnto the riuer Panuco, where he got ſome golde, determining
to ſtay there in a towne which is now called Almeria.
               
               
                  Cortos ouerthrew the idols in Zempoallan,
                  Gomar. hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 25. &amp; the tombes
of their kings, whome they worſhipped as Gods, and tolde
them that they were to worſhip the true God. From thence
he went toward Mexico the 16. day of Auguſt 1519. and trauailed
thrée daies iourney,Zalapan. and came to the citie of Zalapan,
and to another beyond it named Sicuchimatl,
                  Sicuchimatl. where they
were well receiued, and offered to be conducted to Mexico,
becauſe Muteçuma had giuen ſuch commandement. Beyond
this place he paſſed with his companie a certaine hill of
thrée leagues high, wherein there were vines. In another
place they found aboue a thouſand loades of wood ready cut;
and beyond they met with a plaine countrey, and in going
through the ſame, he named it Nombre de Dios. At the bottome
of the mountaine he reſted in a towne called Te
                        •
                     hixuacan,
and from thence they went through a deſolate countrey,
and ſo came to another mountaine that was very colde and
full of ſnow,Zaclotan. and they lay in a towne named Zaclotan: And
ſo from towne to towne they were well receiued and feaſted
till they came into another realme named Tlaxcallan,
                  Tlaxcallan. which
waged warre againſt Muteçuma, and being valiant they
ſkirmiſhed with Cortes; but in the end they agréed and entred
into league with him againſt the Mexicans; and ſo they
went from countrey to countrey till they came within fight
of Mexico. The king Muteçuma fearing them, gaue them
good entertainment with lodging and all things neceſſarie:
and they were with this for a time contented: but miſtruſting
that he and his ſhould be ſlaine,Muteçuma priſoner. he tooke Muteçuma priſoner
and brought him to his lodging with good garde. Cortes demanded
how farre his realme did extend, and ſought to know
the mines of gold and ſiluer that were in it, and how many
kings neighbours to Muteçuma dwelled therein, requiring
certaine Indians to be informed thereof, whereof he had eight

prouided: and he ioined to them eight Spanyards, and ſent
them two and two into fower countreyes,Zuçolla. namely into Zuçolla,
                  Malinaltepec. 
                  Malinaltepec,
                  Zenich. 
                  Tenich,
                  Tututepec. &amp; Tututepec. They which went
vnto Zuçolla went 80. leagues: for ſo much it was from
Mexico thither: They which went to Mahnaltepec, went
70. leagues, ſéeing goodly countries, and brought examples of
gold, which the naturals of the countrey tooke out of great riuers:
and all this prouince belonged vnto Muteçuma.
               
               The countrey of Tenich and vp the riuer were not ſubiect
to Muteçuma, but had warre with him, and would not ſuffe
                     •
                  
the Mexicans to enter into their territorie. They ſent ambaſſadors
vnto Cortes with preſents, offering him their
eſtate, and amitie; whereof Muteçuma was nothing glad.
They which went to Tututepec ſtanding néere the South
ſea did alſo bring with them examples of gold, and praiſed the
pleaſantnes of the countrey, and the multitude of good harbours
vpon that coaſt, ſhewing to Cortes a cloth of cotton
wooll all wouen with goodly workes, wherein all the coaſt
with the hauens and créekes were ſet foorth.Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 48. But this thing
then could not be proſecuted by reaſon of the comming of
Pamphilus de Naruaez into the countrey,Pamphilus de Narua

               In this yéere 1519. the tenth day of Auguſt one Fernande
de Magallanes departed from Siuill with fiue ſhips toward
the Iſlands of Maluco:

he came vnto the riuer of Plate, which the Caſtillians had before
diſcouered.The diſcouerie of Magallanes from the riuer of Plate forward. From thence therefore he began his diſcouerie,
and came vnto an hauen which he called The Porte of
Saint Iulian ſtanding in 49. degrées, and there he entred and
wintred: they endured much cold by reaſon of ſnow and ice:
the people of that countrey they found to be of great ſtature,
and of great ſtrength, taking men by the legs and renting
them in the middeſt as eaſily as one of vs will rent an hen:
they liue by fruits and hunting.Patagones. They called them Patagones,
but the Braſilians doe call them Morcas.
               
               In the yéere 1520. in the beginning of the moneth of September
growing then ſomewhat temperate they went out of
the port and riuer of Saint Iulian, hauing loſt in it one of their

and a halfe. From thence one of the ſhips returned backe vnto
Caſtile, whereof was captaine and pilot one Stephen de
Porto a Portugall, and the other thrée went forward, entring
into a mightie ſea called Pacificum, without ſéeing any inhabited
land till they came in 13. degrées towards the north of
the Equinoctiall: in which latitude they came vnto Iſlands
which they called Los Iardines;
                  Los Iardines. and from thence they ſailed to
the Archipelagus of S. Lazarus, and in one of the Iſlands called
Matan Magallanes was ſlaine,Gomara hiſt gen. lib. 4 cap. 3. and his ſhip was burnt,
and the other two went vnto Borneo, and ſo from place to

               About this time Pope Leo the tenth ſent one Paulus Centurio
as ambaſſadour to the greot Duke of Moſcouie to wiſh
him to ſend into India an armie along the coaſt of Tartarie.

And by the reaſons of this ambaſſadour the ſaid Duke was
almoſt perſuaded vnto that action,Ramuſius 1. vol. fol. 374. if other inconueniences
had not letted him.
               In this ſame yéere 1520. in Februarie Diego Lopes de
Sequeira gouernour of India went towards the Streight of
Mecha and carried with him the ambaſſadour of Presbyter
Iohn, and Roderigo de Lima who alſo went as ambaſſadour
to him.Maçua. They came vnto the Iſland of Maçua ſtanding in
the Red ſea on the ſide of Africa in 17. degrées towards the
north: where he ſet the ambaſſadours on land, with the Portugals
that ſhould goe with them. Peter de Couillan had béene
there before,Ramuſius 1. vol. fol. 190. being ſent thither by king Iohn the ſecond of
Portugall: but yet Francis Aluarez gaue principall light and
knowledge of that countrey.
               In the yeere 1520. the licenciate Lucas Vaſques de Aillon
and other inhabitants of S. Domingo furniſhed two ſhips,Gomara hiſt gen. lib 2. cap. 7.
and ſent them to the Iſles of Lucayos to get ſlaues, and finding
none they paſſed along by the firme land beyond Florida
vnto certaine countreyes called Chicora and Gualdapé,
                  Chicora. vnto
the riuer Iordan and the Cape of Saint Helena ſtanding in 32.
degrées toward the north.Gualdapé. They of the countrey came downe
to the ſea ſide to ſee the ſhips, as hauing neuer before ſéene the
like: The Spanyards went on land where they receiued good
entertainment, and had giuen vnto them ſuch things as they

lacked. But they brought many of them into their ſhips and
then ſet ſaile and brought them away for ſlaues: but in the
way one of their ſhips ſunke, and the other was alſo in great
hazard. By this newes the Licentiate Aillon knowing the
wealth of the countrey, begged the gouernment thereof of
the Emperour, and it was giuen him: whither he went to
get money to pay his debt.
               About this time Diego Velaſques gouernour of Cuba
hearing the good ſucceſſe of Cortes,
                  Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 48. and that he had begged
the gouernment of New Spaine, which he held to be his, he
furniſhed out thither againſt Cortes 18. ſhips with 1000.
men and 80. horſes, whereof he ſent as Generall one Pamphilus
de Naruaez. He came vnto the towne called Villa rica
de la vera Cruz, where he tooke land, and commanded thoſe of
the countrey to receiue him as gouernour thereof: But they
tooke his meſſenger priſoner, and ſent him to Mexico where
Cortes was. Which thing being knowne of Cortes, he wrote
letters vnto Naruaez not to raiſe any vprore in the countrey
which he had diſcouered, offering him obedience if he had any
commiſſion from the Emperour; but he corrupted the people
of the countrey with money: Whereupon Cortes went from
Mexico and tooke Naruaez priſoner in the towne of Zampoallan,
and put out one of his eies.
               
                  Naruaez being thus taken priſoner, his armie ſubmitted
themſelues to Cortes, and obeied him. Whereupon preſently
he diſpatched 200. ſoldiers vnto the riuer of Garay, and he
ſent Iohn Vaſquez de Leon with other two hundred vnto
Coſaalco, and withall ſent a Spanyard with the newes of his
victorie vnto Mexico.
                  The reuolt of the Mexicans in abſence of Cortes. But the Indians being in the meane
time riſen, hurt the meſſenger. Which being knowne to Cortes,
he muſtered his men, and found a thouſand footemen and
two hundred horſemen, with the which he went towards
Mexico, where he found Peter de Aluarado, and the reſt
which he had left there aliue &amp; in ſafetie, wherewith he was
greatly pleaſed, and Muteçuma made much of him. But yet
the Mexicans ceaſed not but made warre againſt him: and
the warre grew ſo hot that they killed their king Muteçuma
with a ſtone,Muteçuma ſlaine. and then there roſe vp another king ſuch an one
as pleaſed them, till ſuch time as they might put the Spanyards
out of the citie, being no more then 504. footemen, and

fortie horſemen.Gomar. hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 50. The Spanyards with great loſſe being driuen
out of Mexico, retired themſelues with much adoe to
Tlaxcallan, where they were well receiued: and ſo they gathered
together 900. Spanyards, 80. horſemen, and two hundred
thouſand Indians, their friends▪ and allies: and ſo they
went backe againe to take Mexico in the moneth of Auguſt
in the yéere 1521.
               
                  Cortes obtaining ſtill more and more victories defermined
to ſée further within the countrey:Gomar. hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap 60. and for this purpoſe in the
yéere 1521. and in October he ſent out one Gonſalo de Sandoual
with 200. footemen and 35▪ horſemen, and cortaine Indians
his friends vnto Tochtepec and Coazacoalco,
                  Tochtepec. which
had rebelled,Coazacoalco. but at length yéelded. And they diſcouered the
countrey, and built a towne 120. leagues from Mexico, and
named it Medelin, and another towne they made naming it
Santo Spirito fewer leagues from the ſea vpon a riuer; and
theſe two townes kept the whole countrey in obedience.

Iſland one hundred leagues they diſcouered certaine Iſlands
and one named Eude,
                  Timor. finding the places from thence forward
peopled.Eude. Afterward paſſing without Samatra they met with
no land till they fell with the Cape of Bona Sperança, where
they tooke in freſh water and wood: So they came by the
Iſlands of Cape Verde, and from thence to Siuill, where
they were notably receiued, as well for the cloues that they
brought, as that they had compaſſed about the world.

he brought with him 200. peſoes of gold, and ſo came backe
againe to S. Vincent: where he found his pilot Andrew Nigno,

Iſles of Saint Iohn, and in that courſe they came to another
Iſland in 20. degrées, which they named La Griega, where
the ſimple people came into their ſhips, of whom they kept
ſome to ſhew them in Noua Spania: They were in this courſe

latitude, where they did ſée ſea fiſhes called Seales and
Tunies. And the climate ſéemed vnto them comming newly
out of the heat, to be ſo cold and vntemperate, that they could
not well abide it, and therefore they turned backe againe to
Tidore, being thereunto enforced alſo by contrarie windes.

Auila, being greatly amazed at the ſight of them, and woondring
much more when they heard, that Cortes had bigger
then thoſe:A wittie ſtratageme. and they painted vnto them a mightie Carake
with ſixe maſts, and ſailes and ſhroudes, and men armed on
horſebacke. This Aluarado went through the countrey and
builded there the city of Sant Iago or Saint Iames,
                  Sant Iago built. and a towne
which he called Segura leauing certaine of his people in it.Caſtagneda hiſt. delle Indie Orientali lib. 6. c 42.
               
               In the ſame yeere 1523. in the moneth of May Antonie
de Britto being captaine of the Iſles of Maluco ſent his coſen
Simon de Breu to learne the way by the Iſle of Borneo to
Malaca:
                  Manada. They came in ſight of the Iſlands of Manada and
Panguenſara:
                  Panguenſara. They went through the ſtraight of Treminao
and Taguy:
                  The Iſlands of S. Michael. and to the Iſlands of Saint Michael ſtanding in
7. degrées,Borneo. and from thence diſcouered the Iſlands of Borneo,
and had ſight of Pedra branca or the White ſtone,Pedra branca. and paſſed
through the ſtraight of Cincapura, &amp; ſo to the citie of Malaca.
               
               In this ſame yéere 1523. Cortes went with 300. footemen
and 150. horſemen and 40000. Mexicans to Panuco both to
diſcouer it better,Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 61. and alſo to inhabite it, and withall to be reuenged
vpon them which had killed and eaten the ſoldiers of
Francis Garay. They of Panuco reſiſted him, but Cortes in the
end ouerthrew them, and conquered the countrey: And hard
by Chila vpon the riuer he built a towne and named it Santo
Stephano del puerto,
                  Santo Stephano del puerto. leauing in it 100. footemen, and thirtie
horſemen and one Peter de Vall
                        •
                     io for lieutenant. This iourney
coſt him 76. thouſand Caſtillians, beſides the Spanyards,
horſes, and Maxicans which died there.
               In this yéere 1523. Francis de Garay made nine ſhips and
two brigandines to goe to Panuco and to Rio de las Palmas to
be there as gouernour:Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 61. &amp; en la Conquiſta de Mexico. for that the Emperour had granted
vnto him from the coaſt of Florida vnto Panuco, in regard of
the charges, which he had béene at in that diſcouerie. He carried
with him 850. ſoldiers, and 140. horſes, and ſome men
out of the Iſland of Iamaica, where he furniſhed his fléet with
munition for the warre: and he went vnto Xagua an hauen
in the Iſland of Cuba, where he vnderſtood that Cortes had

peopled the coaſt of Panuco: and that it might not happen
vnto him as it did to Pamphilus de Naruaez, he determined to
take another companion with him, and deſired the Doctor
Zuazo to goe to Mexico and procure ſome agréement betwéene
Cortes and him. And they departed from Xagua each
one about his buſines. Zuazo came in great ieoperdie, and
Garay went not cléere without.Rio de las Palmas. 
                  Garay arriued in Rio de las
Palmas on S. Iames his day, and then he ſent vp the riuer one
Gonſaluo de Ocampo, who at his returne declared that it
was an euill and deſert countrey: but notwithſtanding Garay
went there on land with 400. footemen and ſome horſemen;
and he commanded one Iohn de Grijalua to ſearch the
coaſt, and he himſelfe marched by land towards Panuco, and
paſſed a riuer which he named Rio montalco;
                  Rio Montalco. he entred into
a great towne where they found many hennes, wherewith
they refreſhed themſelues, and he tooke ſome of the people of
Chila which he vſed for meſſengers to certaine places:Chila. And
after great trauaile comming to Panuco they found no victuailes
there by reaſon of the warres of Cortes and the ſpoile
of the ſoldiers. Garay then ſent one Gonçalo de Ocampo to
Sant Iſteuan del puerto to know whether they would receiue
him or no. They had a good anſwere. But Cortes his men priuily
by an ambuſhment tooke 40. of Garayes horſemen, alleaging
that they came to vſurpe the gouernment of another:
and beſides this miſfortune he loſt fower of his ſhips: whereupon
he left off to procéede any farther.
               While Cortes was preparing to ſet forward to Panuco▪
Francis de las Caſas, and Roderigo de la Paz arriued at Mexico
with letters patents,Gomar. en la Conqueſta de Mexico fol. 226. wherein the Emperour gaue the gouernment
of Nueua Spagna and all the countrey which Cortes
had conquered to Cortes, and namely Panuco. Whereupon
he ſtaied his iourney. But he ſent Diego de Ocampo with
the ſaid letters patents, and Pedro de Aluarado with ſtore of
footemen and horſemen. Garay knowing this thought it beſt
to yéeld himſelfe vnto Cortes his hands, and to go to Mexico;
which thing he did hauing diſcouered a great tract of land.
               In this yéere 1523. Gil Gonçales de Auila made a diſcouerie,

                        •
                     co fol 242. and peopled a towne called San Gil de buena viſta ſtanding
in 14. degrées toward the north,San Gil de buena Viſta in the Bay of Honduras. and almoſt in the bottome
of the Bay called the Aſcenſion or the Honduras. He

began to conquere it becauſe he beſt knew the ſecrets thereof,
and that it was a very rich countrey.
               In this yéere 1523. the ſixt day of December Peter de Aluarado
went from the citie of Mexico by Cortes his commandement
to diſcouer &amp; conquere Quahutemallan,
                  Gomara en la Conquiſta de Mexico fol. 229. &amp; in ſequentibus. 
                  Vtlatlan,
Chiapa, Xochnuxco, and other townes toward the South ſea.
He had with him thrée hundred ſoldiers, 170. horſemen, foure
field péeces, and ſome noble men of Mexico, with people of
the countrey to aide him as well in the warre, as by the way
being long. He went by Tecoantepec to Xochnuxco, and
other places aboue ſaid with great trauaile and loſſe of his
men: but he diſcouered and ſubdued all the countrey. There
are in thoſe parts certaine hils that haue Alume in them,Oile diſtilling out of hils. and
out of which diſtilleth a certaine liquor like vnto oile, and ſulphur
or brimſtone, whereof the Spanyards made excellent
gunpowder.Ibidem fol. 230. He trauailed 400. leagues in this voiage, and
paſſed certaine riuers which were ſo hot, that they could not
well endure to wade through them. He builded a citie calling
it Sant Iago de Quahutemallan.
                  Sant Iago de Quahutemallan. 
                  Peter de Aluarado begged
the gouernment of this countrey, and the report is that it
was giuen him.
               In the yeere 1523. the 8. day of December Cortes ſent
Diego de Godoy with 100. footemen and 30. horſemen,Gomara en la Conquiſta de Mexico fol. 233. two
field péeces, and many of his friends Indians vnto the towne
Del Eſpiritu ſanto:
                  Villa del Eſpiritu ſanto. He ioined himſelfe with the captaine of
that towne,Chamolla. and they went to Chamolla the head citie of that
prouince, and that being taken all the countrey grew quiet.
               In the yéere 1524. in Februarie Cortes ſent one Roderigo
Rangel with 150. Spaniards and many of the Tlaxcallans and
Mexicans againſt the Zapoteeas and Nixticas and vnto other
prouinces and countreyes not ſo well diſcouered:Gomara en la Conquiſta de Mexico fol. 234. they were
reſiſted at the firſt, but quickly put the people to the woorſt,
and kept them for euer after in ſubiection.
               In this ſame yéere 1524. one Roderigo de Baſtidas was
ſent to diſcouer,Gomar. hiſt. gen. lib. 3. cap. 21. people, and gouerne the countrey of Santa
Martha: where he loſt his life becauſe he would not ſuffer the
ſoldiers to take the ſpoile of a certaine towne. They ioined
with Peter Villa-forte, and he being ſometimes his entire
friend did helpe to kill him with daggers lying in his bed.
Afterward Don Pedro de Lugo, and Don Alfonſo his ſonne

were gouernours of that place, which vſed themſelues like
couetous tyrants; whereof grew much trouble.
               In this ſame yéere alſo 1524. after that the Licenciate Lucas
Vaſques de Aillon had obtained of the Emperour the gouernment
of Chicora,
                  Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 7. he armed for that purpoſe certaine
ſhips from the citie of Santo Domingo and went to diſcouer
the countrey, and to inhabite it: but he was loſt with all his
companie, leauing nothing done woorthy of memorie. And I
cannot tell how it commeth to paſſe, except it be by the iuſt
iudgement of God, that of ſo much gold and precious ſtones
as haue béene gotten in the Antiles by ſo many Spaniards, little
or none remaineth, but the moſt part is ſpent and conſumed,
and no good thing done.
               In this yéere 1524. Cortes ſent one Chriſtopher de Olid
with a fléete to the Iſland of Cuba to receiue the vitailes and
munition which Alonſo de Contreras had prepared and to
diſcouer and people the countrey about Cape De Higueras
and the Honduras;
                  Gomar. hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 65. &amp; en la Conquiſta de Mexico fol. 243. and to ſend Diego Hurtado de Mendoça
by ſea, to ſearch the coaſt from thence euen to Darien to finde
out the Streight which was thought to run into the South
ſea, as the Emperour had commanded. He ſent alſo two ſhips
from Panuco to ſearch along the coaſt vnto Florida. He commanded
alſo certaine brigandines to ſearch the coaſt from
Zacatullan vnto Panama. This Chriſtopher de Olid came to
the Iſland of Cuba, and made a league with Diego Velaſquez
againſt Cortes, and ſo ſet ſaile and went on land hard by
Puerto de Cauallos ſtanding in 10. degrées to the north, and
built a towne which he called Triumpho de la Cruz. He tooke
Gil Gonzales de Auila priſoner, and killed his nephew and
the Spaniards that were with him all ſauing one childe, and
ſhewed himſelfe an enimie to Cortes, who had ſpent in that
expedition thirty thouſand Caſtellans of gold to doe him pleaſure
withall.
               
                  Cortes vnderſtanding hereof the ſame yéere 1524. and in
the moneth of October he went out of the citie of Mexico to
ſeeke Chriſtopher de Olid to be reuenged of him,Gomar. hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 66. &amp; en la Conqu

diſcouer, carrying with him thrée hundred Spaniſh footemen
and horſemen, and Quahutimoc king of Mexico, and other
great Lords of the ſame citie. And comming to the towne called
La villa del Eſpiritu ſanto, he required guides of the Lords

of Tauaſco and Xicalanco: and they ſent him ten of their principall
men for guides: who gaue him alſo a map of cotton
wooll,An excellent large map of cotton wooll. wherein was painted the ſituation of the whole countrey
from Xicalanco vnto Naco, and Nito, and euen as farre
as Nicaragua, with their mountaines, hils, fields, meadowes,
vallies, riuers, cities and townes. And Cortes in the meane
time ſent for thrée ſhips which were at the hauen of Medellin
to follow him along the coaſt.
               In this yeere 1524. they came to the citie of Izancanac,

where he vnderſtood that the king Quahutimoc and the Mexicans
that were in his companie were conſpired againſt
him and the Spanyards: for the which he hanged the king
and two others of the chiefe:Mazatlan. and ſo came to the citie of Mazaclan,
                  Tiaca. and after that to Tiaca the head citie of a prouince ſo
called ſtanding in the middeſt of a lake: and here about they
began to finde the traine of the Spanyards, which they went
to ſeeke,Zuzullin. and ſo they went to Zuzullin, and at length came to
the towne of Nito: from Nito Cortes with his owne companie
and all the Spanyards that he found there departed to
the ſhore or ſtrand called La Ba

there a good hauen he builded a towne in that place and called
it Natividad de nueſtra Sen̄ora.
                  Natiuidad de Nueſtra Sennora.
               
               From hence Cortes went to the towne of Truxillo ſtanding
in the hauen of the Honduras,
                  Truxillo. where the Spanyards
dwelling there did entertaine him well:Honduras. and while he was
there, there arriued a ſhip which brought newes of the ſtirre
in Mexico in Cortes his abſence: whereupon he ſent word to
Gonſalo de Sandoual to march with his companie from Naco
to Mexico by land toward the South ſea vnto Quahutemallan,
                  Gomara in the Conqueſt of Mexico fol. 170. &amp; 273. becauſe that is the vſuall plaine and ſafeſt way, and he
left as captaine in Truxillo Fernando de Saavedra his coſen:
and he himſelfe went by ſea along the coaſt of Iucatan to
Chalchicoeca now called Sant Iuan de Vllhua, and ſo to Medellin,
and from thence to Mexico, where he was well receiued,
hauing béene from thence 18. monethes, and had gone
fiue hundred leagues trauailing often out of his way, and enduring
much hardnes.
               In the yéere 1525. Francis Pizarro and Diego de Almagro
went from Panama to diſcouer Peru ſtanding beyond the
line towarde the South,Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 5. cap. 1. &amp; 2. which they called Nueua Caſtillia.
                  Peru.
                  
The gouernour Pedro Arias would not entermeddle with
this expedition, becauſe of the euill newes which his captaine
Francis Vezerra had brought.
               
                  Francis Pizarro went firſt in a ſhip hauing with him 124.
ſoldiers, and Almagro went after him in another ſhip with
70. men. He came to Rio de San Iuan ſtanding in thrée degrées
where he got two thouſand peſoes of gold; and not finding
Pizarro, he went to ſéeke him, repenting his doings by reaſon
of a miſhap that he had. But he went firſt to an Iſland called
Iſla del Gorgona,
                  Iſla del Gorgona. and afterward to another called Iſla del
Gallo,
                  Iſla del Gallo. and to the riuer called Rio del Peru ſtanding in two
degrées northward,Rio del Peru. whereof ſo many famous countreyes
take their name. From thence they went to Rio de San Franciſco,
                  Cabo de Paſſaos. and to Cabo de Paſſaos, where they paſſed the Equinoctiall
line,Puerto vejo. and came to Puerto Vejo ſtanding in one degrée to
the ſouth of the line: from whence they ſailed to the riuers
of Chinapanpa,
                  Tumbez. 
                  Tumbez,
                  Payta. and Payta ſtanding in 4. or. 5. degrées,
where they had knowledge of king Atabalipa and of
the exceeding wealth and riches of his palace. Which newes
mooued Pizarro ſpéedily to returne home againe to Panama,
and ſo into Spaine, and to requeſt the gouernment of that
countrey of the Emperour: which he alſo obtained. He had
ſpent aboue thrée yéeres before in this diſcouerie not without
enduring great trauaile and perils.
               In the ſame yéere 1525. there was ſent out of Spaine a

and went to Braſill, where they found an Iſland in two
degrées,The Iſle of S. Mathew. and named it. S. Matthew: and it ſeemed to be inhabited,
becauſe they found in it orenge trées, hogs, and hennes
in caues, and vpon the rindes of moſt of the trées there were
grauen Portugall letters, ſhewing that the Portugals had
béene there 17. yéeres before that time.Gomara in the Conqueſt of Mexico pag. 28

of theirs paſſed the ſtreight of Magellane hauing in her one
Iohn de Reſaga, and ran all along the coaſt of Peru and Noua
Spagna: They declared all their ſucceſſe vnto Cortes, and
told him, that frier Garſia de Loaiſa was paſſed to the iſlands
of cloues. But of this fléete the Admirall onely came thither,
wherein was captaine one Martine Mingues de Car

from the port of the Groine toward the north to diſcouer the
ſtreight vnto the Malucos by the north,Pet. Martyr. decad 8 pag 601. to whom they would
giue no charge in the fléete of frier Garſia de Loaiſa.

the Earle Don Fernando de Andrada, and the Doctor Beltram,
and the marchant Chriſtopher de Sarro furniſhed a gallion
for him, and he went from the Groine in Galicia to the
Iſland of Cuba, and to the point of Florida, ſailing by day becauſe
he knew not the land. He paſſed the bay Angra, and the
riuer Enſeada, and ſo went ouer to the other ſide. It is alſo
reported that he came to Cape Razo in 46. degrées to the
north: from whence he came backe againe to the Groine laden
with ſlaues. The newes hereof ran by and by through
Spaine, that he was come home laden with cloues as miſtaking
the word: and it was carried to the Court of Spaine:
but when the truth was knowne it turned to a pleaſant ieſt.
In this voiage Gomes was ten monethes.
               In this yéere 1525. Don George de Meneſes captaine of
Maluco, and with him Don Garcia Henriques ſent a foyſt to
diſcouer land towards the north, wherein went as captaine
one Diego de Rocha, and Gomes de Sequeira for pilot. In 9.
or 10. degrées they found certaine Iſlands ſtanding cloſe together,
The Iſle of Batochina by Gilolo. and they called them the Iſlands of Gomes de Sequeira,
he being the firſt pilot that diſcouered them. And they
came backe againe by the Iſland of Batochina.
               
               In the yéere 1526. there went out of Siuill one Sebaſtian
Cabota a Venetian by his father,Gomara hiſtoriae general. lib. 3. cap. 39. but borne at Briſtol in England,
being chiefe pilote to the Emperour, with fower ſhips
toward Maluco. They came to Pernambuco, and ſtaied there
thrée monethes for a winde to double the Cape of Saint Auguſtine.
In the Bay of Patos or of ducks the Admirall ſhip
periſhed; and being without hope to get to the Iſles of Maluco
they there made a pinneſſe to enter vp the riuer of Plate,
and to ſearch it. They ran 60. leagues vp before they came to
the barre: where they left their great ſhips, and with their
ſmall pinneſſes paſſed vp the riuer Parana,

                      Parana. which the inhabitants
count to be the principall riuer. Hauing rowed vp

120. leagues, they made a fortreſſe and ſtaied there aboue a
yéere: and then rowed further till they came to the mouth of
another riuer called Paragioa,
                  Rio Paragioa. and perceiuing that the countrey
yéelded gold and ſiluer they kept on their courſe, and ſent
a brigandine before; but thoſe of the countrey tooke it: and
Cabote vnderſtanding of it thought it beſt to turne backe vnto
their forte, and there tooke in his men which he had left
there, and ſo went downe the riuer where his ſhips did ride,
and from thence he ſailed home to Siuill in the yéere 1530.
leauing diſcouered about two hundred leagues within this
riuer,The fountaine of the Riuer of Plata. reporting it to be very nauigable, and that it ſpringeth
out of a lake named Bombo. It ſtandeth in the firme land of
the kingdome of Peru, running through the vallies of Xauxa,
and méeteth with the riuers Parſo, Bulcasban, Cay, Parima,
Hiucax, with others which make it very broad and great. It
is ſaid alſo, that out of this lake runneth the riuer called Rio
de San Franceſco; and by this meane the riuers come to be ſo
great.The biggeſt riuers proceede from lakes. For the riuers that come out of lakes are bigger then
thoſe which procéede from a ſpring.
               In the yéere 1517. one Pamphilus de Naruaez went out
of S. Lucar de Barameda to be generall of the coaſt and land of
Florida as farre as Rio de las Palmas,
                  Ramuſius 3. vol. fol. 310. and had with him fiue
ſhips, 600. ſoldiers, 100. horſes, beſides a great ſumme and
quantitie of victuailes, armour, clothing and other things.
He could not goe on land where his deſire was, but went on
land ſomewhat néere to Florida with thrée hundred of his
companie, ſome horſes, and ſome victuailes, commanding the
ſhips to goe to Rio de las Palmas; in which voiage they were
almoſt all loſt:The Iſle of Xamo or Malhada. and thoſe which eſcaped paſſed great dangers,
hunger and thirſt in an Iſland called Xamo and by the Spaniards
Malhada being very drie and barren, where the Spaniards
killed one another, and the people alſo of the countrey
did the like. Naruaez and thoſe which went with him ſawe
ſome golde with certaine Indians, and he demanded of them
where they gathered it: and they anſwered that they had it
at Apalachen.
                  Apalachen. They therefore ſearched this gold, and in ſearching
came to the ſaid towne, where they found no gold nor
ſiluer: they ſaw many Bay trées, and almoſt all other kinde
of trées with beaſts, birds, and ſuch like. The men and women
of this place are high and ſtrong, very light and ſo ſwift

runners, that they will take déere at their pleaſure, and will
not grow wearie though they run a whole day. From Apalachen
they went to a towne called Aute;
                  Aute. and from thence to
Xamo a poore countrey with ſmall ſuſtinance.Xamo. Theſe people
bring vp their children very tenderly, and make great lamentation
when any of them dieth; they neither wéepe nor lament
at the death of any olde bodie. Here the people deſired
the Spanyards to cure their ſicke folks, for they had many diſeaſed:
and certaine of the Spanyards being in extreme pouertie
aſſaied it, and vſed praier, and it pleaſed God that they did
indéede recouer as well thoſe that were hurt, as thoſe which
were otherwiſe diſeaſed; in ſo much, that one which was
thought verily to be dead, was by them reſtored to life, as
they themſelues reporte. They affirme that they paſſed
through many countreies and many ſtrange people differing
in language, apparell, and cuſtomes. And becauſe they plaied
the phyſitions, they were as they paſſed greatly eſtéemed and
held for Gods, and the people did no hurt vnto them, but
would giue them part of ſuch things as they had. Therefore
they paſſed quietly, and trauailed ſo farre till they came to a
people, that vſe continually to liue in heards with their cattel
as the Arabians doe. They be poore, and eate ſnakes, liſards,
ſpiders, ants, and al kinde of vermine, and herewith they liue
ſo well contented that commonly they ſing and dance. They
buie the women of their enimies, and kill their daughters,
becauſe they would not haue them marrie with them, whereby
they might increaſe. They trauailed through certaine places,
where the women gaue ſucke vnto their children til they
were ten or twelue yéeres of age; and where certaine men
being Hermaphrodites doe marrie one another. Theſe Spaniards
trauailed aboue 800. leagues; and there eſcaped aliue
in this iourney not aboue ſeuen or eight of them. They came
vpon the coaſt of the South ſea vnto a citie called Saint Michael
of Culuacan ſtanding in 23. degrées and vpward toward
the north.
               This yéere 1527. when Cortes vnderſtood by the pinneſſe
aforeſaide that Don Garcia de Loaiſa was paſſed by the
Streight of Magelan toward the Iſlands of cloues,Gomar. hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 72. and in the Conqueſt of Mexico fol. 28
                        •
                     . he prouided
thrée ſhips to goe ſéeke him, and to diſcouer by that way
of New Spaine as farre as the Iſles of Maluco. There went

as gouernour in thoſe ſhips one Aluaro de Saavedra Ceron,
coſen vnto Cortes, a man fit for that purpoſe. He made ſaile
from Ciuatlanejo, now named S. Chriſtopher ſtanding in 20.
degrées toward the north on All Saints day. They arriued at
the Iſlands which Magelan named The Pleaſures; and from
thence ſailed to the Iſlands, which Gomes de Sequeira had
diſcouered,Iſlas de los Reyes. &amp; not knowing thereof, they named thē 
                  Iſlas de los
Reyes, that is to ſay, The Iſles of the kings, becauſe they came
vnto them on Twelfe day. In the way Saavedra loſt two
ſhips of his company, of which they neuer after heard newes.
But from Iſland to Iſland he ſtill ſailed and came to the
Iſland of Candiga,
                  Candiga. where he bought two Spanyards for 70.
ducats, which had béene of the companie of Frier Loaiſa, who
was loſt thereabout.
               In the yéere 1528. in March Saavedra arriued at the Iſlands
of Maluco, and came to an anker before the Iſle of
Gilolo: he found the ſea calme and winde at will, without
any tempeſts: and he tooke the diſtance from thence to Noua
Spagna to be 2050. leagues. At this time Martin Yn̄iguez de
Carquiçano died, and Fernando de la Torre was choſen their
Generall, who then was in the citie of Tidore, who had there
erected a gallows and had fierce warre with Don George de
Meneſes captaine of the Portugals: and in a fight which they
had the fourth day of May Saavedra tooke from him a galiotte
and ſlew the captaine thereof called Fernando de Baldaya,
and in Iune he returned towards New Spaine, hauing
with him one Simon de Brito Patalin and other Portugals,
and hauing béene certaine monethes at ſea, he was forced
backe vnto Tidore, where Patalin was beheaded and quartered,
and his companions hanged.
               In this yéere 1528. Cortes ſent two hundred footemen and
60. horſemen,Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 73. and many Mexicans to diſcouer and plant the
countrey of the Chichimecas, for that it was reported to be
rich of gold. This being done he ſhipped himſelfe, and came
into Caſtile with great pompe, &amp; brought with him 250000.
marks of gold and ſiluer: and being come to Toledo where
the Emperour then lay, he was entertained according to his
deſerts, and the Emperour made him Marques Del Valle,
and married him to the Lady Iane de Zuniga daughter vnto
the Earle de Aguilar, and then the Emperour ſent him backe

againe to be Generall of New Spaine.
               
               In the yéere 1529. in May Saavedra returned back againe
towards New Spaine,
                  Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 72. and he had ſight of a land toward the
South in two degrées, and he ran Eaſt along by it aboue fiue
hundred leagues till the end of Auguſt. The coaſt was cleane
and of good ankerage,Noua Guinea. but the people blacke and of curled
haire; from the girdle downward they did weare a certaine
thing plaited to couer their lower parts. The people of Maluco
call them Papuas,
                  Os Papuas are blacke people with friſled haire. becauſe they be blacke and friſeled in
their haire: and ſo alſo doe the Portugals call them.
               
                  Saavedra hauing ſailed 4. or 5. degrées to the South of the
line, returned vnto it, and paſſed the Equinoctiall towards
the north, and diſcouered an Iſland which he called Iſla de los
Pintados,
                  Iſla de los Pintados. that is to ſay, The Iſle of painted people: for the
people thereof be white, and all of them marked with an iron:
and by the ſignes which they gaue he conceaued that they
were of China. There came vnto them from the ſhore a kinde
of boate full of theſe men, making tokens of threatnings to
the Spanyards; who ſéeing that the Spanyards would not
obey them, they began to ſkirmiſh with ſlinging of ſtones,
but Saavedra would ſuffer no ſhot to be ſhot at them, becauſe
their ſtones were of no ſtrength, and did no harme.
               A little beyond this Iſland in 10. or 12. degrées they found
many ſmall low Iſlands full of palme trées and graſſe, which
they called Los Iardines,
                  Los Iardines. and they came to an anker in the
middeſt of them, where they taried certaine daies. The people
ſéemed to deſcend from them of China, but by reaſon of
their long continuance there they are become ſo brutiſh, that
they haue neither law, nor yet giue themſelues to any honeſt
labour. They were white clothing which they make of
graſſe. They ſtand in maruailous feare of fire, becauſe they
neuer ſaw any. They eate Cocos in ſtéede of bread, breaking
them before they be ripe, and putting them vnder the ſand,
and then after certaine daies they take them out and lay them
in the ſunne, and then they will open. They eate fiſh which
they take in a kinde of boate called a Parao, which they make
of pine wood,
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      wood. which is driuen thither at certaine times of the
yéere, they know not how, nor from whence, and the tooles
wherewith they make their boates are of ſhels.
               
                  Saavedra perceiuing that the time and weather was then

ſomewhat better for his purpoſe, made ſaile towards the
firme land and citie of Panama, where he might vnlade the
cloues and marchandiſe which he had, that ſo in cartes it
might be carried fower leagues to the riuer of Chagre, which
they ſay is nauigable running out into the North ſea not far
from Nombre de Dios, where the ſhips ride, which come out
of Spaine: by which way all kinde of goods might be brought
vnto them in ſhorter time, and with leſſe danger, then to ſaile
about the Cape of Bona Sperança. For from Maluco vnto
Panama they ſaile continually betwéene the Tropickes and
the line: but they neuer found winde to ſerue that courſe, and
therefore they came backe againe to Maluco very ſad, becauſe
Saavedra died by the way: who if he had liued meant
to haue opened the land of Gaſtillia del Oro and New Spaine
from ſea to ſea.Fower narrow paſſages from ſea to ſea in the Weſt Indies. Which might haue béene done in fower places:
namely from the Gulfe of S. Michael to Vraba, which is
25. leagues,Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 4. cap. 14. or from Panama to Nombre de Dios being 17.
leagues diſtance: or through Xaquator a riuer of Nicaragua,
which ſpringeth out of a lake thrée or fower leagues from the
South ſea, and falleth into the North ſea; whereupon doe
ſaile great barks and crayers. The other place is from Tecoantepee
through a riuer to Verdadera Cruz in the Bay of the
Honduras, which alſo might be opened in a ſtreight. Which if
it were done, then they might ſaile from the Canaries vnto
the Malucos vnder the climate of the Zodiake in leſſe time
and with much leſſe danger, then to ſaile about the Cape de
Bona Sperança, or by the ſtreight of Magelan, or by the
Northweſt.The northweſt paſſage very beneficiall. And yet if there might be found a ſtreight there
to ſaile into the ſea of China, as it hath béene ſought, it would
doe much good.
               In this yéere 1529, one Damian de Goes a Portugal being
in Flanders, after that he had trauailed ouer all Spaine, was
yet deſirous to ſée more countreyes, and faſhions, and diuerſities
of people; and therefore went ouer into England and
Scotland, and was in the courts of the kings of thoſe parts:
and after that came againe into Flanders, and then trauailed
through Zealand, Holland, Brabant, Luxenburge, Suitzerland,
and ſo through the cities of Colen, Spyres, Argentine,
Baſill, and other parts of Alemaine, &amp; then came backe againe
into Flanders: and from thence he went into France through

                  Picardie, Normandie, Champaine, Burgundie, the dukedome
of Borbon, Gaſcoigne, Languedoc, Daulphinie, the dukedome
of Sauoy, and paſſed into Italy into the dukedome of Millaine,
Ferrara, Lombardie, and ſo to Venice, and turned backe
againe to the territorie of Genoa, and the dukedome of Florence
through all Tuſcane: and he was in the citie of Rome,
and in the kingdome of Naples from the one ſide to the other.
               From thence he went into Germanie to Vlmes, and other
places of the Empire, to the dukedome of Sueuia and of Bauier,
and the Archdukedome of Auſtrich, the kingdome of
Boeme, the dukedome of Morania, and the kingdome of Hungarie,
and ſo to the confines of Graecia. From thence he went
to the kingdome of Poland, Pruſſia, and the dukedome of
Liuonia, and ſo came into the great dukedome of Moſcouia.
From whence he came backe into High Alemayne, and
through the countreyes of the Lantzgraue, the dukedome of
Saxonie, the countreyes of Denmarke, Gotland, and Norway,
trauailing ſo farre, that he found himſelfe in 70. degrées of
latitude towards the North. He did ſée, ſpeake and was conuerſant
with all the kings, princes, nobles and chiefe cities of
all Chriſtendome in the ſpace of 22. yéeres: So that by reaſon
of the greatnes of his trauell, I thought him a man woorthie
to be here remembred.
               In the yéere 1529. or 1530. one Melchior de Sofa Tauarez
went from the citie of Ormuz vnto Balfera and the Iſlands
of Giſſara with certaine ſhips of warre, and paſſed vp as farre
as the place, where the riuers Tygris and Euphrates méete
one with the other. And although other Portugals had diſcouered
and ſailed through that ſtreight, yet neuer any of them
ſailed ſo farre vpon the freſh water till that time, when he diſcouered
that riuer from the one ſide to the other, wherein he
ſaw many things which the Portugals knew not.
               Not long after this one Ferdinando Coutinho a Portugall
came vnto Ormuz, and being deſirous to ſée the world, he
determined to goe into Portugall from thence ouer land to ſée
Aſia and Europe; And to doe this the better he went into
Arabia, Perſia, and vpwards the riuer Euphrates the ſpace of
a moneth; and ſaw many kingdomes and countreies, which
in our time had not béene ſéene by the Portugals: He was
taken priſoner in Damaſco, and afterward croſt ouer the prouince

of Syria, and came vnto the citie of Alepo. He had béene
at the holy Sepulchre in Ieruſalem, and in the citie of Cayro,
and at Conſtantinople with the Great Turke; and hauing
ſéene his court he paſſed ouer vnto Venice, and from thence
into Italie, France, Spaine, and ſo came againe to Lisbon. So
that he and Damian de Goes were in our time the moſt noble
Portugals, that had diſcouered and ſéene moſt countreyes and
realmes of their owne affections.
               In the ſame yéere 1530. little more or leſſe,Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 5. cap. 3. one Francis
Piſarro, which had béene in Spaine to obtaine the gouernment
of Peru, turned backe againe to the citie of Panama with all
things that he deſired: he brought with him fower brethren,
Ferdinand, Iohn, Gonzaluo, and Francis Martines de Alcantara:
They were not well receiued by Diego de Almagro,
and his friends; for that Piſarro had not ſo much commended
him to the Emperour as he looked for, but omitted the diſcouerie,
wherein he had loſt one of his eies, and ſpent much:
yet in the end they agreed, and Diegro de Almagro gaue vnto
Piſarro 700. pezoes of golde, victuailes and munition, wherewith
he prepared himſelfe the better for his iourney.
               Not long after this agréement Francis Piſarro and his brethren
went in two ſhips with the moſt of their ſoldiers and
horſes; but he could not arriue at Tumbez as he was minded,
and ſo they went on land in the riuer of Peru; and went
along the coaſt with great paines, becauſe there were many
b
                     •
                  gs and riuers in their way, wherein ſome of his men were
drowned: They came to the towne of Coaché, where they
reſted,Much gold and emeraulds. where they found much gold and emeraulds, of which
they brake ſome to ſée if they were perfect. From thence Piſarro
ſent to Diego de Almagro twentie thouſand pezoes of
gold to ſend him men, horſes, munition, and victuailes; and
ſo he went on his iourney to the hauen named Porto Viejo:
and thither came vnto him one Sebaſtian de Benalcazar, with
all ſuch things as had ſent for, which pleaſed and pleaſured
him very much.
               In the yéere 1531. he hauing this aide,Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 5. cap. 4. paſſed ouer into a
rich Iſland called Puna,
                  The Iſle of Puna. where he was well receiued of the
gouernour: yet at laſt he conſpired to kill him and all his men:
but Piſarro preuented him, and tooke many of the Indians, and
bound them with chaines of gold and ſiluer. The gouernour

cauſed thoſe that kept his wines to haue their noſes, armes,
and priuie members to be cut off, ſo iealous was he. Here Piſarro
found aboue ſixe hundred men priſoners belonging to
the king Attabalipa,
                  Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 5. cap. 5. who waged warre againſt his eldeſt
brother Guaſcar to winne reputation. Theſe he ſet at libertie
and ſent them to the citie of Tombez, who promiſed to be a
meane that he ſhould be well receiued in thoſe partes. But
when they ſaw themſelues out of bondage, they forgat their
promiſe, and incited the people againſt the Spaniards. Then
Piſarro ſent thrée Spaniards to Tombez to treate for peace,
whome they tooke and ſlew and ſacrificed, and their prieſtes
wept not for pitie but of cuſtome. Piſarro hearing of this
cruell fact, paſſed ouer to the maine, and ſet vpon the citie one
night ſuddenly and killed many of them, ſo that they preſented
him with gifts of gold and ſiluer and other riches, and ſo
became friends. This done, he builded a towne vpon the riuer
of Cira,
                  S. Michael of Tangarara. and called it Saint Michael of Tangarara, which
was the firſt towne inhabited by Chriſtians in thoſe partes;
whereof Sebaſtian de Benalcazar was appointed captaine.Payta an excellent harbour in 5. degrees to the South of the line.
Then he ſearched out a good and ſure hauen for his ſhips, and
found that of Payta to be an excellent harbour.
               In this ſame yéere 1531. there went one Diego de Ordas
to be gouernour in the riuer of Maragnon,
                  Gomara hiſtoriae general. lib. 3. cap. 17. with thrée ſhips,
ſixe hundred ſoldiers, and 35. horſes. He died by the way, ſo
that the intention came to none effect. After that in the yéere
1534. there was ſent thither one Hierome Artal with 130.
ſoldiers,The famous riuer Maragnon. yet he came not to the riuer, but peopled Saint Michael
de Neueri, and other places in Paria. Alſo there went
vnto this riuer Maragnon a Portugall gentleman named Aries
Dacugna, and he had with him ten ſhips, nine hundred
Portugals, and 130. horſes. He ſpent much, but he that loſt
moſt was one Iohn de Barros.
                  Iohn de Barros factor of the houſe of India. This riuer ſtandeth in thrée
degrées toward the South, hauing at the entrance of it 15.
leagues of breadth and many Iſlands inhabited, wherein
grow trées that beare incence of a greater bignes then in
Arabia, gold, rich ſtones, and one emeraud was found there
as big as the palme of a mans hand. The people of the countrey
make their drinke of a kinde of dates, which are as big
as quinces.
               In the yéere 1531. one Nunnez de Guſman went from the

citie of Mexico towards the northweſt to diſcouer and conquer
the countreies of Xaliſco,

                  Ceintiliquipac, Ciametlan, Toualla,
Cnixco, Ciamolla, Culhuacan, and other places. And to
doe this he caried with him 250. horſes, and fiue hundred ſoldiers.
He went through the countrey of Mechuacan, where he
had much gold, ten thouſand marks of ſiluer, and 6000. Indians
to carrie burdens.Nueua Galicia. He conquered many countreyes, called
that of Xaliſco Nueua Galicia, becauſe it is a ragged countrey,
and the people ſtrong. He builded a citie which he called
Compoſtella,
                  Compoſtella. and another named Guadalajara, becauſe he
was borne in the citie of Guadalajara in Spaine.
                  Guadalaira. He likewiſe
builded the townes de Santo Eſpirito,

de San Miguel ſtanding in 24. degrées of northerly latitude.San Miguel.
               
               In the yéere 1532. Ferdinando Cortes ſent one Diego
Hurtado de Mendoça vnto Acapulco 70. leagues from Mexico,
                  Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 2. cap. 74. where he had prepared a ſmall fléete to diſcouer the coaſt
of the South ſea as he had promiſed the Emperour. And finding
two ſhips readie, he went into them, and ſailed to the
hauen of Xaliſco, where he would haue taken in water and
wood: but Nunnez de Guſman cauſed him to be reſiſted, and
ſo he went forward: but ſome of his men mutined againſt
him, and he put them all into one of the ſhips, and ſent them
backe into New Spaine. They wanted water, and going to
take ſome in the bay of the Vanderas, the Indians killed them.
But Diego Hurtado ſailed 200. leagues along the coaſt, yet
did nothing woorth the writing.
               In the yéere 1533. Francis Piſarro went from the citie of
Tumbes to Caxamalca,
                  Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 5. cap. 6. 7. 8. 9. where he tooke the king Attabalipa,
who promiſed for his ranſome much gold and ſiluer: and to
accompliſh it there went to the citie of Cuſco ſtanding in 17.
degrées on the South ſide Peter de Varco, and Ferdinando de
Sotto, who diſcouered that iourney being 200. leagues all
cauſies of ſtone, and bridges was made of it, and from one
iourney to another, lodgings made for the Yngas: for ſo they
call their kings. Their armies are very great and monſtrous.
For they bring aboue an hundred thouſand fighting men to
the field. They lodge vpon theſe cauſies; and haue there prouiſion

                        •••
                     , as it is ſaid. Ferdinando Piſarro with ſome horſemen
went vnto Paciacama 100. leagues from Caxamalca, and

diſcouered that prouince: And comming backe he vnderſtood
how Guaſcar brother to Attabalipa was by his commandement
killed,Guaſcar ſlaine. and how that his captaine Ruminaguy roſe vp
in armes with the citie of Quito.
                  Gomar. hiſt. gen. lib 5 cap. 11. After this Attabalipa was
by the commandement of Piſarro ſtrangled.Attabalipa ſtrangied.
               
               In the yéere 1534. Francis Piſarro ſéeing that the two kings
were goue, began to enlarge himſelfe in his ſigniories, and to
build cities, forts, and townes to haue them more in ſubiection.

S. Michael of Tangarara againſt Ruminaguy vnto Quito. He
had with him two hundred footemen and 80. horſemen: He
went diſcouering and conquering 120. leagues from the one
citie to the other eaſt not farre from the Equinoctiall line:Cruell ſnowe vnder the line.
where Peter Aluarado found mountaines full of ſnow,Gomara hiſtoriae general. lib. 5. cap. 19. and ſo
cold, that 70. of his men were froſen to death. When he came
vnto Quito, he began to inhabite it, and named it S. Francis.
In this countrey there is plentie of wheate, barlie, cattell and
plants of Spaine,
                  Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 5. cap. 16. which is very ſtrange. Piſarro went ſtraight
to the citie of Cuſco, and found by the way the captaine Quiſquiz
riſen in armes, whome ſhortly he defeated. About this
time there came vnto him a brother of Attabalipa named
Mango, whom he made Ynga or king of the countrey. Thus
marching forward on his iourney after certaine ſkirmiſhes
he tooke that excéeding rich and wealthie citie of Culco.

till he came vnto 51. degrees hoping to haue paſſed that
way to China, and to bring thence drugs and other marchandiſe
into France. The next yéere after he made another voiage
into thoſe partes, and found the countrey abounding with
victuailes, houſes and good habitations, with many and great
riuers. He ſailed in one riuer toward the ſouthweſt 300.
leagues, and named the countrey thereabout Noua Francia:
at length finding the water freſh he perceiued he could not
paſſe through to the South ſea, and hauing wintered in thoſe

Don Antonie de Mendoça came vnto the citie of Mexico as

Viceroy of New Spaine. In the meane while Cortes was
gone for more men to continue his diſcouerie, which immediately
he ſet in hand ſending foorth two ſhips from Tecoantepec

in them Fernando de Grijalua, and Diego Bezerra de Mendoça,
and for pilots there went a Portugal named Acoſta, and
the other Fortunio Ximenez a Biſcaine. The firſt night they
deuided themſelues. Fortunio Ximenez killed his captaine
Bezerra and hurt many of his confederacie: and then he
went on land to take water and wood in the Bay of Santa

had found tokens of pearles: he went into the ſhip, and ſo
went to ſéeke the pearles, he diſcouered along the coaſt aboue
150. leagues. They ſaid that Ferdinando de Grijalua ſailed
thrée hundred leagues from Tecoantepec without ſeeing any

Thomas, becauſe he came vnto it on that Saints day: it ſtandeth
in 20. degrées of latitude.
               In this yéere 1535. Piſarro builded the citie de los Reyes
vpon the riuer of Lima.

dwell there,Gomar. hiſt. gen. lib. 4. cap. 23. becauſe it was a better countrey, ſtanding in 12.

cauſed the citie of Truxillo to be builded on a riuers ſide vpon
a fruitfull ſoile,Lib. 5. cap. 22. Truxillo. ſtanding in 8. degrées on that ſide. He built
alſo the citie of Saint Iago in Porto Viejo:

bréede many horſes, aſſes, mules, kine, hogs, goates, ſhéepe,
and other beaſts; alſo trées and plants, but principally roſemary,
oranges, limons, citrons, and other ſower fruits, vines,
wheate, barlie, and other graines, radiſhes and other kinde of
herbage and fruits brought out of Spaine thither to be ſowne
and planted.
               In the ſame yéere 1535. one Diego de Almagro went from
the citie of Culco to the prouinces of Arequipa and Chili,

beyond Cuſco towards the South vnto 30. degrées.
This voiage was long, and he diſcouered much land, ſuffering
great hunger, cold, and other extremities, by reaſon of
the abundance of ice, which ſtoppeth the running of the riuers;

ſo that men and horſes die in thoſe parts of the colde.
About this time Ferdinando Pilarro came out of Spaine to the
citie de los Reyes, and brought with him the title of Marquiſate
of Atanillos for his brother Francis Piſarro, &amp; vnto Diego
de Almagro he brought the gouernment of 100. leagues ouer
and beſides that which was diſcouered,Lib. 5. cap. 25. and named it The
New kingdome of Toledo. Ferdinando Pilarro went ſtraight
to the citie of Cuſco: and one Iohn de Rada went to Almagro
into Chili with the Emperours patents.
               
                  Diego de Almagro hauing receiued the letters patents
which the Emperour had ſent him,Lib. 5. cap. 27. went ſtraight from Chili
vnto Cuſco, to haue it, ſéeing it did appertaine vnto him.
Which was the cauſe of a ciuill warre. They were mightily
oppreſſed with want of victuailes and other things in this
their returne, and were enforced to eate the horſes, which
had died fower moneths and a halfe before, when they paſſed
that way.

The captaines name was Vaſques Perez de San Paio:
alſo he ſent another armie againſt Badu the king of Cambaia,
                  Badu king of Cambaia.
the captaine whereof was Coſeſofar a renegado. They came
to the barre of that mighty riuer in the moneth of December,
of the water whereof they found ſuch trial as Quintus Curtius
writeth of it, when Alexander came thither.
               In this yeere 1535. one Simon de Alcazaua went from Siuill
with two ſhips and 240.Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 4. cap. 13.

they went to New Spaine, others that they went to Maluco,
but others alſo ſay to China; where they had béene with Ferdinando
Perez de Andrada. Howſoeuer it was, they went
firſt vnto the Canaries, and from thence to the ſtreight of Magelan,
without touching at the land of Braſill or any part at
all of that coaſt. They entred into the ſtreight in the moneth
of December with contrarie windes and cold weather. The

Roderigo de Iſla with 60. Spanyards to goe and diſcouer land:

but they roſe vp againſt him and killed him, and appointed
ſuch captaines and officers as pleaſed them, and returned.
Comming thwart of Braſil they loſt one of their ſhips vpon
the coaſt, and the Spanyards that eſcaped drowning were
eaten by the Sauages. The other ſhip went to Saint Iago in
Hiſpaniola, and from thence to Siuill in Spaine.
               
               In this ſame yéere 1535.Gomara hiſtoriae general. lib. 3. cap. 39. Don Pedro de Mendoça went
from Cadiz towards the riuer of Plate with twelue ſhips, and
had with him two thouſand men: which was the greateſt
number of ſhips and men, that euer any captaine carried into
the Indies. He died by the way returning homewards. The
moſt part of his men remained in that riuer, and builded a
great towne containing now two thouſand houſes, wherein
great ſtore of Indians dwell with the Spanyards. They diſcouered
and conquered the countrey till they came to the mines
of Potoſſi and to the towne La Plata,
                  The riuer of Plata runneth vp to Potoſſi. which is 500. leagues
diſtant from them.
               In the yéere 1536. Cortes vnderſtanding that his ſhip
wherein Fortunio Ximenez was pilote was ſeaſed on by
Nunnez de Guzman,
                  Gomara hiſt gen. lib. 2. cap 74 &amp; 98 he ſent foorth thrée ſhips to the place
where Guzman was, and he himſelfe went by land well accompanied,
and found the ſhip which he ſought all ſpoiled and
rifled. When his thrée other ſhips were come about, he went
aboord himſelfe with the moſt part of his men and horſes,
leauing for captaine of thoſe which remained on land one
Andrew de Tapia.
                  Saint Iago Iſle. So he ſet ſaile, and comming to a point
the firſt day of May he called it Saint Philip, and an Iſland
that lieth faſt by it he called Sant Iago. Within three daies
after he came into the bay where the pilot Fortunio Ximenez
was killed,La plaia de Santa Cruz. which he called La plaia de Santa Cruz, where he
went on land, and commanded Andrew de Tapia to diſcouer,
Cortes tooke ſhipping againe and came to the riuer now called
Rio de San Pedro y San Paulo,
                  Rio de S. Pedro y San Paulo. where by a tempeſt the
ſhips were ſeparated, one was driuen to the bay de Santa
Cruz,

on ſhore hard by Xaliſco, and the men thereof went by

eſpied a ſhip at anker &amp; ſailing towards her he had béene loſt,
if that ſhip had not ſuccored him.Gomara in the conqueſt of Mexico folio 290. 291. 292. But hauing graued his ſhip,
he departed with both the ſhips from thence. Hée bought
victuals at a déere rate at Saint Michael of Culhuacan; and
from thence he went to the hauen of Santa Cruz, where hée
heard that Don Antonio de Mendoça was come out of
Spaine to be Viceroy. He therefore left to be captaine of his
men one Francis de Vlloa, to ſend him certaine ſhips to diſcouer
that coaſt. While he was at Acapulco meſſengers came
vnto him from Don Antonio de Mendoça the Viceroy, to
certifie him of his arriuall: and alſo he ſent him the coppie of
a letter, wherein Francis Piſarro wrote, that Mango Ynga
was riſen againſt him, and was come to the citie of Cuſco
with an hundred thouſand fighting men, and that they had
killed his brother Iohn Piſarro, and aboue 400. Spaniards
and 200. horſes, and he himſelfe was in danger, ſo that he demanded
ſuccour and aide. Cortes being informed of the ſtate
of Piſarro, and of the arriuall of Don Antonio de Mendoça,
becauſe he would not as yet be at obediēce; Firſt he determined
to ſende to Maluco to diſcouer that way a long vnder the
Equinoctial line, becauſe The Iſlands of Cloues ſtand vnder
that paralele: And for that purpoſe he prepared 2. ſhips with
prouiſion, victuals &amp; men, beſides all other things neceſſarie.
He gaue the charge of one of theſe ſhips to Ferdinando de
Grijalua, and of the other vnto one Aluarado a Gentleman.
They went firſt to Saint Michael de Tangarara in Peru to
ſuccour Francis Piſarro, and from thence to Maluco all along
néere the line as they were commanded. And it is declared
that they ſailed aboue a thouſand leagues without fight of
land, on ſhe one ſide nor yet on the other of the Equinoctiall.
And in two degrées toward the north they diſcouered one
Iſland named Aſea,
                  Aſea Iſland. which ſéemeth to be one of the Iſlands of
Cloues: 500. leagues little more or leſſe as they ſailed,Iſla de los Peſcadores. they
came to the ſight of another which they named Iſla de los
Peſcadores. Going ſtill in this courſe they ſawe another
Iſland called Hayme towards the ſouth,Hayme Iſland. and another named
Apia:
                  Apia Iſland. and then they came to the fight of Seri:
                  Seri. turning towards
the north one degrée, they came to anker at another
Iſland named Coroa,
                  Coroa. and from thence they came to another

               The people of all theſe Iſlands are blacke, and haue their
haire friſled,Os papuas. whom the people of Maluco do call Papuas. The
moſt of them eate mans fleſh, and are witches, ſo giuen to
diuiliſhnes, that the diuels walk among them as cōpanions.
If theſe wicked ſpirits do finde one alone, they kill him with
cruell blowes or ſmoother him. Therefore they vſe not to goe,
but when two or thrée may be in a companie.Theſe ſeeme to be like Oſtriches. There is héere
a bird as bigge as a Crane: he flieth not, nor hath any wings
wherewith to flée, he runneth on the ground like a Déere: of
their ſmall feathers they do make haire for their idols. There
is alſo an herbe, which being waſhed in warme water, if the
leafe thereof be laide on any member and licked with the
toong, it will draw out all the blood of a mans body: and with
this leafe they vſe to let themſelues blood.
               From theſe Iſlands they came vnto others named the
Guelles ſtanding one degree towards the north,Guelles Iſlands. eaſt, and weſt
from the Iſle Terenate,

Theſe Iſlands ſtande 124. leagues from the Iſland named
Moro;
                  Moro. and from Terenate betwéene 40. and 50. From
whence they went to the Iſle of Moro,
                  Moluccae. &amp; the Iſlāds of Cloues,
going from the one vnto the other. But the people of the countrey
would not ſuffer them to come on lande, ſaying vnto
them:Antonie Galuano, the author of this booke. Go vnto the fortreſſe where the captain Antonie Galuano
is, and we will receiue you with a good will: for they
would not ſuffer them to come on land without his licence:
for he was factor of the countrey, as they named him. A thing
woorthie to be noted, that thoſe of the countrey were ſo affectioned
to the Portugals,
                  The caſe now is much altered. that they would venter for them
their liues, wiues, children and goods.

of Vraba called Saint Sebaſtian de buena Viſta, being in the
gulfe of Vraba, and from thence to Rio verde, &amp; from thence
by land without knowing any way, nor yet hauing any carriages,
they went to the end of the countrey of Peru, and to
the towne La plata,

                     a. by the ſpace of 1200. leagues: a thing
woorthie of memorie. For from this riuer to the mountaines

of Abibe the countrey is full of hils,The mountaines of Abibe thicke foreſts of trées,
and many riuers: and for lacke of a beaten way, they had
pierced ſides. The mountaines of Abibe as it is recorded
haue 20. leagues in bredth. They muſt be paſſed ouer in Ianuarie,
Februarie, March, and Aprill. And from that time
forward it raineth much, and the riuers will be ſo greatly encreaſed,
that you cannot paſſe for them. There are in thoſe
mountaines many heards of ſwine, many dantes, lyons, tygers,
beares, ounſes, and great cats, and monkeis, and mightie
ſnakes and other ſuch vermine. Alſo there be in theſe
mountaines abundance of partridges, quailes, turtle doues,
pigeons, and other birdes and foules of ſundrie ſorts. Likewiſe
in the riuers is ſuch plentie of fiſh, that they did kill of
them with their ſtaues: and carrying canes and nets they
affirme that a great army might be ſuſtained that way without
being distreſſed for want of victuals. Moreouer they declared
the diuerſities of the people, toongs, and apparell that
they obſerued in the countries, kingdomes, and prouinces
which they went through, and the great trauels and dangers
that they were in till they came to the towne called Villa de
la Plata,
                  Villa de la Plata. and vnto the ſea there unto adioyning. This was the
greateſt diſcouerie that hath béene heard of by land, and in ſo
ſhort a time. And if it had not béene done in our daies, the
credite thereof would haue béene doubtfull.
               In the yéere 1538. there went out of Mexico certaine friers
of the order of Saint Francis towards the north to preach
to the Indians the Catholicke faith.Ramuſius 3. vol. fol. 356. He that went fartheſt
was one frier Marke de Nizza,
                  Frier Marke de Nizza. who paſſed through Cul
                        •
                     acan,
                  Sibola. and came to the prouince of Sibola, where he found ſeuen
cities: and the farther he went, the richer he found the countrie
of gold, ſiluer, precious ſtones, and ſhéepe bearing very
fine wool. Vpon the fame of this welth the viceroy don Antonio
de Mendoça, and Cortes, determined to ſend a power thither.
But when they could not agrée thereupon Cortes went
ouer into Spaine in the yéere 1540. where afterward he died.
               In this yéere 1538. began the ciuil warre betweene Piſarro
and Alonagro, wherein at the laſt Alinagro was taken and
beheaded.
               In the ſame yéere 1538. Antonie Galuano being chiefe
captaine in the iſles of Maluco ſent a ſhip towards the north,Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 5. cap. 34.
                  
whereof one Francis de Caſtro was captaine,Antonie Galuano chiefe captaine of Maluco author of this worke. hauing commandement
to conuert as many as he could to the faith. He
himſelfe chriſtened many, as the lords of the Celebes, Macaſares,
Amboynos, Moros, Moratax, and diuers other places,
When Francis de Gaſtro arriued at the Iſland of Mindanao,
ſixe kings receiued the water of Baptiſme, with their wiues,
children and ſubiects: and the moſt of them Antonie Galuano
gaue commandement to be called by the name of Iohn, in remembrance
that king Iohn the third raigned then in Portugall.
               
               The Portugals and Spaniards which haue béene in theſe
Iſlands affirme, that there be certaine hogs in them, which
beſides the téeth which they haue in their mouthes, haue
other two growing out of their ſnouts, and as many behinde
their eares of a large ſpan and an halfe in length. Likewiſe
they ſay there is a tree, the one halfe whereof, which ſtandeth
towards the eaſt is a good medicine againſt all poyſon, &amp; the
other ſide of the trée which ſtandeth toward the weſt is very
poiſon; and the fruite on that ſide is like a bigge peaſe; and
there is made of it the ſtrongeſt poyſon that is in all the
world. Alſo they report that there is there another trée, the
fruite whereof whoſoeuer doth eate, ſhall be twelue houres
beſides himſelfe, and when he commeth againe vnto himſelfe
he ſhall not remember what he did in the time of his madnes.
Moreouer there are certaine crabs of the land, whereof
whoſoeuer doth eate ſhall be a certaine ſpace out of his wits.
Likewiſe the countrey people declare that there is a ſtone in
theſe Iſlands whereon whoſoeuer ſitteth ſhall be broken in
his bodie. It is farther to be noted, that the people of theſe
Iſlands do gild their téeth.
               In the yéere 1539. Cortes ſent thrée ſhips with Francis
Vlloa to diſcouer the coaſt of Coludean northward.Gomara hiſt gen. lib. 2. cap. 74. &amp;. Ramuſius 3. vol. fol. 339. They
vient from Acapulco,
                  The bottome of the gulfe of California diſcouered. and touched at S. Iago de buqna ſperança,
and entred into the gulfe that Cortes had diſcouered,
and ſailed till they came in 32. degrées, which is almoſt the
fartheſt end of that gulfe, which place they named Ancon de
Sane Andres, becauſe they came thither on that ſaints daie:
Then they came out a long the coaſt on the other ſide,California doubled. and
doubled the point of California and entred in betwéene certaine
Iſlands and the point, and ſo ſailed along by it, till they

came to 32. degrées,Cabo del Enganno. from whence they returned to newe
Spaine, enforced thereunto by contrarie windes and want
of victuals; hauing béene out about a yéere. Cortes according
to his account, ſpent 200000. ducates in theſe diſcoueries.
               From Cabo del Enganno to another cape called Cabo de
Liampo in China there are 1000. or 1200. leagues ſayling.The diſtance betweene America and China in 32. degrees is 1000 leagues Gomar. hiſt. gen. lib. 6. cap. 17.
                  Cortes and his captaines diſcouered new Spaine, from 12.
degrées to 32. from ſouth to the north, being 700. leagues,
finding it more warme then cold, although ſnow do lie vpon
certaine mountaines moſt part of the yéere. In new Spaine
there be many trées, flowers and fruits of diuers ſorts and
profitable for many things. The principall trée is named
Metl.
                  Metl an excellent tree. It groweth not very high nor thicke. They plant and
dreſſe it as we do our vines. They ſay it hath fortie kinde of
leaues like wouen clothes, which ſerue for many vſes. When
they be tender they make conſerues of them, paper, and a
thing like vnto flaxe: they make of it mantles, mats, ſhooes,
girdles, and cordage. Theſe trées haue certaine prickles ſo
ſtrong and ſharpe, that they ſewe with them. The roots make
fire and aſhes, which aſhes make excellent good lie. They
open the earth from the roote and ſcrape it, and the iuice
which commeth out is like a ſirrupe. If you do féeth it, it will
become honie; if you purifie it it will be ſugar. Alſo you may
make wine and vineger thereof. It beareth the Coco. The
rinde roſted and cruſhed vpon ſores and hurts healeth and
cureth. The iuice of the tops and roots mingled with incenſe
are good againſt poyſon, and the biting of a viper. For theſe
manifold benefits it is the moſt profitable trée knowne to
growe in thoſe parts.
               Alſo there be there certaine ſmall birds named Vicmalim.
Their bill is ſmall and long. They liue of the dewe, and the
iuice of flowers and roſes. Their feathers be verie ſmall and
of diuers colours. They be greatly eſtéemed to worke golde
with. They die or ſléepe euerie yéere in the moneth of October
fitting vpon a little bough in a warme and cloſe place:
they reuiue or wake againe in the moneth of Aprill after that
the flowers be ſprung,The reuiued birds. and therefore they call them the reuiued
birds.
               Likewiſe there be ſnakes in theſe parts, which ſound as
though they had bels when they créepe. There be other which

engender at the mouth, euen as they report of the viper.
There be hogges which haue a nauell on the ridge of their
backs, which aſſoone as they be killed and cut out, will by
and by corrupt and ſtinke.
               Beſides theſe there be certaine fiſhes which make a noyſe
like vnto hogs,Snorting fiſhes. and will ſnort, for which cauſe they be named
ſnorters.
               In the yéere 1538. and 1539. after that Diego de Almagro
was beheaded,Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 5. cap. 35. the Marques Francis Piſarro was not idle.
For he ſent ſtraight one Peter de Baldiuia with a good companie
of men to diſcouer and conquere the countrey of Chili.
                  Chili.
He was wel receiued of thoſe of the countrey, but afterwards
they roſe againſt him and would haue killed him by treaſon.
Yet for all the warre that he had with them, he diſcouered
much land, and the coaſt of the ſea toward the ſoutheaſt, till
he came into 40. degrées and more in latitude. While he was
in theſe diſcoueries he heard newes of a king called Leucengolma,
                  This might be the temple in the lake of Titicaca. which commonly brought to the field two hundred
thouſand fighting men againſt another king his neighbour,
and that this Leucengolma had an Iſland, and a temple
therein with two thouſand prieſtes:Cieça cap. 103. and that beyond them
were the Amazones, whoſe Quéene was called Guanomilla,
that is to ſay, The goldeu heauen. But as yet there are none
of theſe things diſcouered. About this time Gomez de Aluarado
went to conquer the prouince of Guanuco: and Francis
de Chauez went to ſubdue the Conchincos, which troubled
the towne of Truxillo, and the countreyes adioyning. Peter
de Vergara went to the Bracamores, a people dwelling toward
the north from Quito. Iohn Perez de Vergara went
againſt the Ciaciapoians: Alfonſus de Mercadiglio went vnto
Mulubamba. Ferdinando and Gonzaluo Piſarros went to
ſubdue Collao, a countrey very rich in gold. Peter de Candia
went to the lower part of Collao. Peranzures alſo went to
conquer the ſaid countrey. And thus the Spanyards diſperſed
themſelues, and conquered aboue ſeuen hundred leagues
of countrey in a very ſhort ſpace, though not without great
trauailes and loſſe of men.
               The countreyes of Braſill and Peru ſtand eaſt and weſt
almoſt 800. leagues diſtant. The néereſt is from the Cape of
Saint Auguſtine vnto the hauen of Truxillo: for they ſtand

both almoſt in one parallele and latitude. And the fartheſt is
950. leagues, reckoning from the riuer of Peru to the ſtreits
of Magellan, which places lie directly north &amp; ſouth, through
which countrey paſſe certaine mountaines named the Andes,
                  The mountaines of Andes. which diuide Braſill from the empire of the Ingas. After
this maner the mountaines of Taurus and Imaus diuide Aſia
into two parts: which mountaines begin in 36. and 37. degrées
of northerly latitude at the end of the Mediterran ſea
ouer againſt the Iſles of Rhodes and Cyprus, running ſtill
towards the Eaſt vnto the ſea of China. And ſo likewiſe the
mountaines of Atlas in Africa diuide the tawnie Moores
from the blacke Moores which haue friſled haire, beginning
at mount Me
                        •
                     es about the deſert of Barca, and running along
vnder the Tropicke of Cancer vnto the Atlanticke Ocean.
               
               The mountains of the Andes be high, ragged, and in ſome
places barren without trées or graſſe, whereon it raineth and
ſnoweth moſt commonly. Vpon them are windes and ſudden
blaſtes; there is likewiſe ſuch ſcarcitie of wood, that they
make fire of turffes,Earth of diuers colours good to dy withall. as they do in Flanders. In ſome places
of theſe mountaines and countries the earth is of diuers
colours, as blacke, white, red, gréene, blew, yellow, and violet,
wherewith they die colours without any other mixture.
From the bottomes of theſe mountaines ſpring many ſmall
and great riuers, principally from the eaſt ſide, as appéereth
by the riuers of the Amazones, of S. Francis, of Plata, and many
others which runne through the countrey of Braſil, being
larger then thoſe of Peru, or thoſe of Caſtilia del oro. There
grow on theſe mountaines many turneps, rapes, and other
ſuch like rootes and herbes. One there is like vnto Aipo or
Rue which beareth a yellow flower, and healeth all kinde of
rotten ſores, and if you apply it vnto whole and cleane fleſh it
will eate it vnto the bone: ſo that it is good for the vnſound
and naught for the whole.
               They ſay there be in theſe mountains tigers, lions, beares,
woolues, wilde cats, foxes, Dantes, Ounces, hogs and déere:
birdes as well rauenous as others, and the moſt part of them
are blacke, as vnder the North both beaſts &amp; birdes be white.
Alſo there be great &amp; terrible ſnakes which deſtroied a whole
armie of the Ingas paſſing that way, yet they ſay that an olde
woman did inchant them in ſuch ſort that they became ſo

gentle, that a man might ſit vpon one of them. The countrey
of Peru adioining vnto the mountaines of Andes weſtward
toward the ſea, and containing 15. or 20. leagues in bredth is
all of very hot ſand, yet freſh, bringing foorth many good trées
and fruites becauſe it is well watered: where there growe
abundance of flags, ruſhes, herbes, and trées ſo ſlender and
looſe, that laying your hands vpon them the leaues will fall
off. And among theſe herbes and freſh flowers the men and
women liue and abide without any houſes or bedding, euen
as the cattell doe in the fields: and ſome of them haue tailes.
They be groſſe, and weare long haire. They haue no beards,
yet haue they diuers languages.
               Thoſe which liue on the tops of theſe mountains of Andes
betwéene the cold and the heate for the moſt part be blinde of
one eie, and ſome altogether blinde, and ſcarce you ſhall finde
two men of them together, but one of them is halfe blinde.
Alſo there groweth in theſe fields, notwithſtanding the great
heate of the ſand good Maiz, and Potatos, and an herbe which
they name Coca, which they carrie continually in their
mouthes (as in the Eaſt India they vſe another herbe named
Betele) which alſo (they ſay) ſatiſfieth both hunger and thirſt.An herbe named Coca which ſatisfieth hunger and thirſt.
Alſo there are other kindes of graines and rootes whereon
they féede. Moreouer there is plentie of wheate, barly, millet,
vines, and fruitful trées, which are brought out of Spaine and
planted there. For all theſe things prooue well in this countrey,
becauſe it is ſo commodiouſly watered.
               Alſo they ſow much cotton wooll, which of nature is white,
red, blacke, gréene, yellow, orange tawnie, and of diuers other
colours.
               Likewiſe they affirme, that from Tumbez ſouthward it
doth neither raine, thunder, nor lighten, for the ſpace of fiue
hundred leagues of land: but at ſome times there falleth ſome
little ſhower. Alſo it is reported, that from Tumbez to Chili
there breede no peacocks, hennes, cocks, nor eagles, falcons,
haukes, kites, nor any other kinde of rauening fowles, and
yet there are of them in all other regions and countreies: but
there are many duckes; géeſe, herous, pigeons, partriges,
quailes, and many other kindes of birdes. There are alſo a
certaine kinde of fowle like vnto a ducke which hath no
wings to flie withall, but it hath fine thinne feathers which

all the body. Likewiſe there are bitters that make war
with the ſeale or ſea wolfe: for finding them out of the water
they will labour to picke out their eies, that they may not ſée
to get to the water againe, and then they doe kill them. They
ſay it is a pleaſant ſight to behold the fight betwéene the ſaid
bitters and ſeales. With the beards of theſe ſeales men make
cleane their téeth, becauſe they be wholeſome for the toothach.
There are certaine beaſtes which thoſe of the countrey call
Xacos,
                  Xacos a kinde of great ſheepe that men ride vpon. and the Spanyards ſhéepe becauſe they beare wooll like
vnto a ſhéepe, but are made much like vnto a déere, hauing a
a ſaddle backe like vnto a camell. They will carrie the burteen
of 100. weight. The Spanyards ride vpon them, and
when they be wearie they will turne their heads backward,
and void out of their mouthes a woonderful ſtinking water.
               From the riuer of Plata and Lima ſouthward there bréede
no crocodiles nor lizards, no ſnakes, nor any kinde of vene
mous vermine, but great ſtore of good fiſhes bréede in thoſe
riuers. On the coaſt of Saint Michael in The South ſea there
are many rocks of ſalt couered with egges. On the point of
Saint Helena are certaine Well ſprings which caſt foorth a
liquor, that ſerueth in ſtead of pitch and tarre. They ſay that
in Chili there is a fountaine, the water whereof will conuert
wood into ſtone. In the hauen of Truxillo there is a lake of
freſh water, and the bottome thereof is of good hard ſalt. In
the Andes beyond Xauxa there is a riuer of freſh water, in the
bottome whereof there lieth white ſalt. Alſo they affirme by
the report of thoſe of the countrey, that there haue dwelt giants
in Peru, of whoſe ſtatures they found in Porto viejo, and
in the hauen of Truxillo, bones and iawes with téeth, which
were thrée and fower fingers long.
               In the yeere 1540. the captaine Ferdinando Alorchon
went by the commandement of the Viceroy Don Antonio de
Mendoça with two ſhips to diſcouer the bottome of the gulfe
of California,
                  Ramuſius 3 vol. fol. 303. and diuers other countries.
               In this yeere 1540. Gonſaluo Piſarro went out of the citie
of Quito to diſcouer the countrey of Canell or Cinamome, a
thing of great fame in that countrey. He had with him two
hundred Spanyards horſemen and footemen, and thrée hundred
Indians to carrie burthens.Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 5. cap. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . He went forward til he came
to Guixos, which is the fartheſt place gouerned by the Ingas:
                  
where there happened a great earthquake with raine and
lightning, which ſunke 70. houſes. They paſſed ouer cold and
ſnowie hils, where they found many Indians frozen to death,
maruelling much of the great ſnowe that they found vnder
the Equinoctiall line. From hence they went to a prouince
called Cumaco,
                  Cumaco. where they tarried two monethes becauſe it
rained continually. And beyond they ſawe the Cinamome-trées,
Cinamom trees which be very great, the leaues thereof reſembling bay
leeues, both leaues, branches, rootes, and all taſting of Cinamome.
The rootes haue the whole taſte of Cinamome. But
the beſt are certaine knops like vnto Alcornoques or acornes,
which are good marchandiſe.Wild. Cinamom in the Iſlands of Iaua. It appéereth to be wilde Cinamome,
and there is much of it in the Eaſt Indies, and in the
Iſlands of Iaoa or Iaua.
               
               From hence they went to the prouince and citie of Coca,
                  Coca.
where they reſted fifty daies. From that place forwards they
trauailed along by a riuers ſide being 60. leagues long, without
finding of any bridge, nor yet any foorde to paſſe ouer to
the other ſide. They found one place of this riuer, where it
had a fall of 200. fathoms déepe,El pongo. a mighty fall of a riuer. where the water made
ſuch a noiſe, that it would make a man almoſt deafe to ſtand
by it. And not far beneath this fall, they ſay they found a chanell
of ſtone very ſmooth, of two hundred foote broad, and the
riuer runneth by: and there they made a bridge to paſſe ouer
on the other ſide,Guema. where they went to a countrey called Guema,
which was ſo poore, that they could get nothing to eate
but onely fruits and herbes. From that place forward they
found a people of ſome reaſon, wearing certaine clothing
made of cotton wooll, where they made a brigandine, &amp; there
they found alſo certaine Canoas, wherein they put their ſicke
men, and their treaſure and beſt apparell, giuing the charge
of them to one Francis de Orellana: and Gonſaluo Pizarro
went by land with the reſt of the companie along by the riuers
ſide, and at night went into the boates, and they trauailed
in this order two hundred leagues as it appeereth. When
Pizarro came to the place where he thought to finde the brigandine
and Canoas, and could haue no ſight of them nor yet
heare of them, he thought himſelfe out of all hope, becauſe he
was in a ſtrange countrey without victuales, clothing, or any
thing elſe: wherefore they were faine to eate their horſes,

yea and dogs alſo, becauſe the countrey was poore and barren,
and the iourney long, to goe to Quito. Yet notwithſtanding
taking a good hart to themſelues they went on forwards
in their iourney, trauailing continually 18. monethes
and it is reported, that they went almoſt 5. hundred leagues,
wherein they did neither ſée ſunne nor any thing elſe whereby
they might be comforted, wherefore of two hundred men
which went foorth at the firſt, there returned not backe paſt
ten vnto Quito, and theſe ſo weake, ragged, and diſfigured
that they knew them not. Orellana went fiue hundred or ſixe
hundred leagues downe the riuer, ſéeing diuers countreyes
and people on both ſides thereof, among whom he affirmed
ſome to be Amazones. He came into Caſtile, excuſing himſelfe,
that the water and ſtreames draue him downe perforce.
This riuer is named The riuer of Orellana,
                  Rio de Orellana. &amp; other name it
the riuer of the Amazones, becauſe there be women there
which liue like vnto them.
               In the yéere 1540. Cortes went with his wife into Spaine
where he died of a diſeaſe ſeuen yéeres after.
               In the yéere 1541. it is recorded that Don Stephan de Gama
gouernour of India ſailed toward the ſtreit of Mecca. He
came with al his fléete vnto an anker in the Iſland of Maçua,
                  Maçua.
and from thence vpwards in ſmall ſhipping he went along
the coaſt of the Abaſſins and Ethiopia, till he came to the
Iſland of Suachen,
                  Suachen. ſtanding in 20. degrées towardes the
north,Coſſir. and from thence to the hauen of Coſ

the ſhore of Arabia,
                  Suez. and along by it he went vnto Suez, which
is the fartheſt ende of the ſtreit, and ſo he turned backe the
ſame way, leauing that countrey and coaſt diſcouered ſo far
as neuer any other Portugall captaine had done, although
Lopez Suarez gouernour of India went to the hauen of Iuda,
and the hauen of Mecca ſtanding on the coaſt of Arabia in 23.
degrées of latitude, and 150. leagues from the mouth of the
ſtreit. Don Stephan de Gama croſſing ouer from Coſ

                     ir to
the citie of Toro,
                  An Iſland of brimſtone in the Red ſea. as it is reported found an Iſland of Brimſtone,
which was diſpeopled by the hand of Mahumet, wherein
many crabs doe bréede, which increaſe nature: wherefore
they be greatly eſteemed of ſuch as are vnchaſte. Alſo
they ſay that there are in this ſtreit many roſes which open

when women are in their labour.
               
                  Iohn Leo writeth in the very end of his Geographie which
he made of Africa, that there is in the mountaines of Atlas a
roote called Surnag, ouer which if a maid chance to make water
ſhée ſhall léeſe her virginitie.
               In the ſame yéere 1541. Don Diego de Almagro killed the
Marques Francis Pizarro, and his brother Francis Martinez
of Alcantara in the citie de los Reyes, otherwiſe called Lima,
and made himſelfe gouernour of that countrey.
               In the yéere 1540. the Viceroy Don Antony de Mendoza
ſent one Francis Vaſquez de Coronado by land vnto the prouince
of Sibola with an armie of Spaniards and Indians.
                  Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 6. cap. 17.
They went out of Mexico,
                  Sibola. and came to Culuacan, and from
thence to Sibola, which ſtandeth in 30. degrées of latitude.
They required peace with the people and ſome victuals,
being thereof deſtitute. But they anſwered that they vſed
not to giue any thing to thoſe that came vnto them in warlike
manner. So the Spaniards aſſalted the towne and tooke
it, and called it Nueua Granada, becauſe the generall himſelfe
was borne in Granada. The ſoldiers found themſelues deceiued
by the words of the Friers, which had béene in thoſe
parts before; and becauſe they woulde not returne backe to
Mexico againe with emptie hands, they went to the towne
of Acuco,
                  Acuco. where they had knowledge of Axa and Quiuira,
where there was a king very rich, that did worſhip a croſſe
of golde, and the picture of the quéene of Heauen. They indured
many extremities in this iourney, and the Indians fled
away from them, and in one morning they found thirtie of
their horſes dead.Circuie. From Cicuie they went to Quiuira, which
was two hundred leagues off,Quiuira. according to their account,
paſſing all through a plaine countrey, and making by the
way certaine hillocks of cowe dung, becauſe thereby they
might not looſe their way in their returne. They had there
haile-ſtones as bigge as Oranges. Now when they were
come to Quiuira, they found the king called Tatarrax, which
they ſought for, with a iewell of copper hanging about his
necke, which was all his riches. They ſaw neither any croſſe,
nor any image of the quéene of Heauen, nor any other token
of Chriſtian religion.Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 6. cap. 18. &amp; 19. It is written of this countrey that it is
but ſmally inhabited, principally in the plaine and champion

places, becauſe the men and women goe in herds with their
cattell, whereof they haue great plentie, euen as the Arabians
do in Barbarie, and they remooue from place to place, euen as
the ſeaſon ſerueth,Sheepe as big as horſes. and the paſtures to féede their cattle. In
theſe parts are certaine beaſts almoſt as bigge as horſes,
they haue very great hornes, and they beare wooll like vnto
ſhéepe, and ſo the Spaniards call them. They haue abundance
of oxen verie monſtrous, being camel-backed, and hauing
long beards, and on their necke long manes like vnto horſes.
They liue with eating of theſe oxen and drinking of their
blood, and apparell themſelues with the ſkins of the ſame.
The moſt part of the fleſh that they do eate is rawe, or euill
roſted, for they lacke pots to ſéeth it in. They cut their meat
with certaine kniues made of flint ſtone. Their fruite are
damſons, haſel-nuts, walnuts, melons, grapes, pines, and
mulberies.Dogs carying 50. pound waight on their backs. There be dogges ſo bigge, that one of them alone
will hold a bull, though he be neuer ſo wilde. When they remooue,
theſe dogs do carrie their children, wiues, and ſtuffe
vpon their backes, and they are able to carrie fiftie pound
waight. I paſſe ouer many things, becauſe the order which
I follow will not permit me to be long.
               In the yéere of our Lord 1542. one Diego de Freitas being
in the realme of Siam, and in citie of Dodra as captaine of a
ſhip, there fled from him thrée Portugals in a Iunco (which is
a kind of ſhip) towards China. Their names were Antony
de Mota, Francis Zeimoro, and Antony Pexoto, directing
their courſe to the citie of Liampo, ſtanding in 30. and odde
degrées of latitude. There fell vpon their ſterne ſuch a ſtorme,
that it ſet them off the land, and in fewe daies they ſawe an
Iſland towards the eaſt ſtanding in 32. degrées, which they
do name Iapan,
                  Iapan diſcouered by chance. which ſeemeth to be the Iſle of Zipangri,
whereof Paulus Venetus maketh mention, and of the riches
thereof. And this Iſland of Iapan hath gold, ſiluer, and other
riches.
               In this yéere 1542. Don Antonio de Mendoça Viceroy of
Nueua Spagna, ſent his captaines and pilots to diſcouer the
coaſt of Cape del Enganno, where a fléete of Cortez had been
before. They ſailed till they came to a place called Sierras Neuadas,
or The ſnowie mountaines, ſtanding in 40. degrées
toward the north, where they ſaw ſhips with merchandiſes,

Iſles of Iapan, or of China; for they ſaid that it was not aboue
thirtie daies ſailing vnto their countrey.
               In the ſame yéere 1542. Don Antony de Mendoça ſent vnto
the Iſlands of Mindanao a fléete of ſixe ſhips with fower
hundred ſoldiers,Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 4. cap. 13. and as many Indians of the countrey, the
generall whereof was one Rui Lopez de villa Lobos,
                  Ramuſius 1. vol. fol. 375. pag. 1. being
his brother in law and a man in great eſtimation. They ſet
ſaile from the hauen of Natiuidad ſtanding in 20. degrées towards
the north, vpon All Saints éeue, and ſhaped their courſe
towards the weſt.Saint Thomas. They had ſight of the Iſland of S. Thomas,
which Hernando de Grijalua had diſcouered, and beyond in
17. degrées they had ſight of another Iſland which they named
La Nublada,
                  La Nublada. that is, The cloudie Iſland. From thence
they went to another Iſland named Roca partida,
                  Roca Partida. that is,
The clouen Rocke. The 3. of December they found certaine
Baxos or ſtates of ſixe or ſeuen fathoms déepe.Baxo
                        •
                     . The 15. of the
ſame moneth they had ſight of the Iſlands, which Diego de
Roca, and Gomez de Sequeira, and Aluaro de Saauedra had
diſcouered,Los Reyes. and named them Los Reyes, becauſe they came
vnto them on Twelfe day. And beyond them they found other
Iſlands in 10. degrées all ſtanding round, and in the midſt
of them they came to an anker, where they tooke freſh water
and wood.
               In the ſame yéere 1542. Don Diego de Almagro was
ſlaine in Peru by the hands of one Don Vaca de Caſtro.
               
               In the yéere 1543. in Ianuarie they departed from the
foreſaid Iſlands with all the fléete, and had ſight of certaine
Iſlands, out of which there came vnto them men in a certaine
kinde of boats, and they brought in their hands croſſes,
and ſaluted the Spaniards in the Spaniſh toong ſaying, Buenas
dias, Matelotes, that is to ſay, Good morrow, companions;
whereat the Spaniards much marueiled, being then ſo
farre out of Spaine, to ſée the men of that countrey with croſſes,
and to be ſaluted by them in the Spaniſh toong, and they
ſéemed in their behauiour to incline ſomewhat to our Catholique
faith. The Spaniards not knowing, that many thereabout
had béene Chriſtened by Francis de Caſtro, at the commandement

of Antony Galuano, ſome of them named theſe
Iſlands,

               In the ſame yéere 1543. the firſt of February Rui Lopez
had ſight of that noble Iſland Mindanao ſtanding in 9. degrées:
Mindanao. they could not double it nor yet come to an ancre as
they would, becauſe the chriſtened kings and people reſiſted
them, hauing giuen their obedience to Antonie Galuano,
whom they had in great eſtimation, and there were fiue or
ſixe kings that had receiued baptiſme, who by no meanes
would incurre his diſpleaſure. Rui Lopez perceiuing this, and
hauing a contrary winde, ſailed along the coaſt to finde ſome
aide;Sarangam. and in 4. or 5. degrées he found a ſmall Iſland which
they of the countrey call Sarangam, which they tooke perforce,
and in memory of the vizeroy who had ſent them thither
they named it Antonia, where they remained a whole
yéere, in which time there fell out things worthie to be written;
but becauſe there are more hiſtories that intreat of the

ſailes, they ſailed for certaine daies with a fore-winde, till it
came upon the ſkanting, and came right vnder the tropique

then in any other place of thoſe parts, hauing many iewels
of gold, which was a token, that there was ſome of that metal
in the ſame countrie. Here were alſo barkes of 43. cubits
in length, and 2. fathomes and a halfe in bredth, and the
plankes 5. inches thicke, which barkes were rowed with

                     •
                  ares. They told the Spaniards, that they vſed to ſaile in them
to China,
                  Pilots for China. and that if they would go thither they ſhould haue
pilots to conduct them, the countrie not being aboue 5. or 6.
daies ſayling from thence. There came vnto them alſo certaine
barkes or boates handſomely decked, wherein the Maſter
and principall men ſate on high, and vnderneath were
very blacke moores with frizled haire: and being demanded
where they had theſe black moores, they anſwered, that they
had them from certaine Iſlands ſtanding faſt by Sebut,
where there were many of them, a thing that the Spaniards
much maruailed at, becauſe from thence it was aboue 300.
leagues to the places where the black people were. Therefore
it ſeemed, that they were not naturally borne in that climate,
but that they be in certaine places ſcattered ouer the
whole circuite of the world. For euen ſo they be in the Iſlands
of Nicobar and Andeman, which ſtand in the gulfe of Bengala,
and from thence by the ſpace of 500. leagues we doe not
know of any blacke people. Alſo Vaſco Nunez de Valboa
declareth that as he went to diſcouer The South ſea, in a certaine
land named Quareca he found black people with frizled
haire, whereas there were neuer any other found either in
Noua Spagna, or in Caſtilia del Oro, or in Peru.
               
               In the yéere 1544. Don Gutierre de Vargas biſhop of Placenza
ſent a fléet from the city of Siuil vnto the ſtreits of Magellan:
                  Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 4. cap. 14. which is reported to haue béene done by the counſel
of the vizeroy Don Antonie de Mendoça his couſin. Some

                     •
                  ed that they went to Maluco, others to China, others,
that they went onely to diſcouer the land betwixt the ſtreite
and the land of Peru on the other ſide of Chili, becauſe it was
reported to be very rich in gold and ſiluer. But this fléete by

reaſon of contrary windes could not paſſeth
                     •
                   ſtreit, yet one
ſmall barke paſſed the ſame, and ſailed along the coaſt, and
diſcouered all the land, till he came vnto Chirimai, and Arequipa,
which was aboue 500. leagues, for the reſt was alreadie
diſcouered by Diego de Almagro, and Francis Pizarro, and
their captaines and people at diuers times. By this it appéereth,
that from The ſtreit to the Equinoctial line on both ſides
is wholy diſcouered.
               In the yéere 1545. &amp; in the moneth of Ianuarie Rui Lopez
de villa Lobos, and Giraldo with the Caſtilians came to the
Iſland of Moro,
                  The Iſle of Moro. and the citie of Camafo, where they were
well receiued of the kings of Gilolo and Tidore, and of the
people of the countrey (becauſe Antony Galuano was gone)
and put the captaine Don George de Caſtro to great trouble,Antonie Galua
                     
                        •
                     o gon out of 
                        •
                     he Malucas.
as appéered by thoſe things which paſſed betwéene him and
the Portugals, and the great expences whereunto he put the
fortreſſe.
               In the ſame yéere 1545. Rui Lopez de villa Lobos ſent
from the Iſland of Tidore another ſhip towards New Spaine
by the ſouth ſide of the line, wherein was captaine one Inigo
Ortez de Rotha, and for pilot one Iaſpar Rico. They ſailed to
the coaſt of Os Papuas,
                  Os Papuas. and ranged all along the ſame, and
becauſe they knew not that Saauedra had béene there before,
they chalenged the honor and ſame of that diſcouerie. And becauſe
the people there were blacke and had friſled haire,Nueua Guinea. they
named it Nueua Guinea. For the memorie of Saauedra as
then was almoſt loſt, as all things elſe do fall into obliuion,
which are not recorded, and illuſtrated by writing.
               In this yéere 1545. and in the moneth of Iune, there
went a Iunk from the citie of Borneo, wherein went a Portugall
called Peter Fidalgo, and by contrary windes he was
driuen towards the north; where he founde an Iſland ſtanding
in 9. or 10. degrées, that ſtretched it ſelfe to 22. degrées of
latitude,The Iſle of Lu
                     
                        •
                     ones. which is called The Iſle of the Luçones, becauſe the
inhabitants thereof were ſo named. It may haue ſome other
name and harborowes, which as yet we know not: it runneth
from the north vnto the ſouthweſt, and ſtandeth betwéene
Mindanao and China. They ſay they ſailed along by
it 250. leagues, where the land was fruitfull and well couered,
and they affirme, that there they will giue two Pezos of

gold for one of ſiluer:
                     
                        〈…〉
                      gold. and yet it ſtandeth not farre from the
countrey of China.
               
               In the yéere 1553. there went out of England certaine
ſhipping, and as it appéered they ſailed northward along the
coaſt of Norway and Finmark,
                  Moſcouie diſcouered by ſea, by the Engliſh. and from thence eaſt, till they
came betwéene 70. and 80. degrées vnto Moſcouie, for ſo far
one of the ſhips went: but I know not what became of the
reſt: &amp; this was the laſt diſcouery made vntil this time. From
this lande of Moſcouie eaſtward you faile vnto Tartary,
and at the farther end of it ſtandeth the countrey and prouince
of China. It is ſaid that betwéene China and Tartary
there is a wall aboue 200. leagues in length, ſtanding néere
vnto 50. degrées of latitude.
               Now I gather by all the precedent diſcoueries, that the
whole earth is in circuite 360. degrées according to the Geometrie
thereof: and to euery degrée the ancient writers allow
17. leagues &amp; a halfe, which amount vnto 6300. leagues
yet I take it that euerie degrée is iuſt 17. leagues. Howſoeuer
it be, all is diſcouered and ſailed from the eaſt vnto the
weſt almoſt euen as the ſunne compaſſeth it: but from the
ſouth to the north there is great difference; for towardes the
north pole there is found diſcouered no more then 77. or 78.
degrées, which come to 1326. leagues: and towards the
ſouth pole there is diſcouered from the Equinoctiall to 52.
or 53. degrées, that is, to the ſtreit which Magellan paſſed
through, which amounteth to about 900. leagues; and putting
both theſe ſaide maine ſums togither, they amount to
2226. leagues. Now take ſo many out of 6300. leagues,
there remaineth as yet vndiſcouered north and ſouth aboue
the ſpace of 4000. leagues.
               FINIS.
