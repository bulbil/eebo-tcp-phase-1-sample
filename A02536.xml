            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

moſt materiall Letters: wherein, if I miſtake not, (as, how eaſily are wee deceiued in our owne?) the pleaſure of the varietie ſhall ſtriue with the importance of matter. There is no worldly thing, I confeſſe, whereof I am more ambitious then of your Highneſſes contentment, which that you place in goodneſſe, is not more your glory, then our ioy: Do ſo ſtill, and heauen and earth ſhall agree to bleſſe you, and vs in you. For me, after this my officious boldneſſe, I ſhall betake

myſelfe in ſilence, to ſome greater worke, wherein I may approue my ſeruice to the Church, and to your Highnes, as her ſecond ioy and care. My heart ſhall be alwaies, and vpon al opportunities, my tong and pen, ſhall no leſſe gladly bee deuoted to my gracious Maſter, as one
            
               Who reioyce to be your Highneſſes (though vnworthy, yet) faithfull and obſequious Seruant.

I meddle not with the meanes of their firſt riſings: the munificence of Chriſtian Princes, the honeſt deuotions of wel-meaning Contributers, the diuiſion of the Chriſtian world, the buſie indeauours of forward Princes, for the recouery of the holy land, with neglect of their owne, the ambitious inſinuations of that ſea, the ſame and large dominiō of thoſe ſeuen hils; the compacted indulgence, and conniuence of ſome treacherous, of other timorous rulers; the ſhameles flattery of paraſites, the rude ignorance of Times; or if

there be any other of this kinde; My thoughts and wordes ſhall be ſpent vpon the preſent, and lateſt age. All the world knowes, how that pretended chayre of Peter tottered, and cracked, ſome threeſcore yeares agoe, threatning a ſpeedy ruine to her fearefull vſurper: How is it that ſtill it ſtands, and ſeemes now to boaſt of ſome ſetledneſſe? Certainely, if hell had not contriued a new ſupport, the Angell had long ſince ſaide, It is fallen, it is fallen; and the Merchants, Alas, Alas, the great Citie. The brood of that lame Loyola ſhall haue this miſerable honour, without our enuie; that if they had not beene, Rome had not beene. By what meanes, it reſts now to enquire.
               It is not ſo much their zeale

for falſhood; which yet wee acknowledge, and admire not. If Satan were not more buſie then they, we had loſt nothing. Their deſperate attempts, bold intruſions, importunate ſolicitations haue not returned empty; yet their policy hath done more then their force. That Popiſh world was then foule, and debauched, as in doctrine, ſo in life; and now beganne to be aſhamed of it ſelfe; when theſe holy Fathers, as ſome Saints drop't out of heauen, ſuddenly profeſſed an vnuſuall ſtrictneſſe, ſad piety, reſolued mortification; and ſo drew the eyes, and hearts of men after them, that poore foules beganne to thinke it could not be other then diuine, which they taught; other then holy, which they touched. The

very times (not ſeldome) giue as great aduantage, as our owne beſt ſtrength: and the vices of others giue glory to thoſe which eyther are, or appeare vertuous. They ſaw how ready the world was to bite at the baite, and now followed their ſucceſſe, with new helps. Plenty of pretended miracles muſt bleſſe, on all ſides, the in deauours of this new Sect; and calls for both approbation, and wonder. Thoſe things by the report of their owne pennes (other witneſſes I ſee none) haue beene done by the ten Patriarcks of the Ieſuitiſh Religion, both aliue and dead, which can hardly bee matched of him, whoſe name they haue vſurped. And now the vulgar can ſay, If theſe men were not of God, they could doe nothing:

How can a man that is a ſinner do ſuch miracles? not diſtruſting either the fame, or the worke, but applauding the Authors, for what was ſaid to bee done. But now leſt the enuie of the fact ſhould ſurpaſſe the wonder, they haue learned to caſt this glory vpon their woodden Ladies, &amp; to communicate the gaine vnto the whole Religion: Two blocks at Hale and Scherpen-heuuell, haue ſaide and done more for Popery, then all Fryers, euer ſince Francis wore his breeches on his head. But becauſe that praiſe is ſweete, which ariſes from the diſgrace of a riuall, therefore this holy ſociety hath beſides, euer wont to honor it ſelfe by the brokage of ſhameles vntruthes againſt the aduerſe part; not caring how probable any report

is, but how odious. A iuſt volume would not containe thoſe willing lies, wherewith they haue purpoſely loded religion, and vs; that the multitude might firſt hate vs, and then enquire: and theſe courſes are helde not tollerable, but meritorious. So the ende may be attayned, all meanes are iuſt; all wayes ſtraight. VVhom we may, we ſatisfie: but wounds once giuen, are hardly healed with out ſome ſcarres: and commonly accuſations are vocall, Apologies dumbe. How eaſie is it to make any cauſe good, if we may take liberty of tongue, and conſcience? Yet leſt ſome glimpſe of our truth and innocence ſhould perhaps lighten the eyes of ſome more inquiſitiue Reader, they haue by ſtrict prohibitions, whether

of bookes, or conference, reſtrained all poſsibility of true informations; Yea their owne writings, wherein our opinions are reported with confutation, are not alowed to the common view, leſt if it ſhould appeare what we hold, our meere opinion ſhould preuaile more then their ſubtileſt anſwere. But aboue all, the reſtraint of Gods booke hath gained them moſt; If that might be in the hands of men, their religion could not be in their hearts; now, the concealement of Scriptures breeds ignorance, and ignorance ſuperſtition. But becauſe forbiddance doth but whet deſire, and worke a conceite of ſome ſecret excellence in things denyed; therfore haue they deuiſed to affright this dangerous curioſity, with

that cruell, butcherly, helliſh Inquiſition. Wherein yet there is not leſſe craft then violence. For ſince they haue perceiued the blood of Martyrs to bee but the ſeed of the Church, and that theſe perfumes are more diſperſed with beating; they haue now learned to murder without noyſe, and to bring forth (if, at leaſt, they liſt ſometimes to make the people priuie to ſome examples of terror) not men but carcaſſes. Behold, the conſtant confeſsions of the dying Saints haue made them weary of publique executions: None but bare walls ſhalll now teſtifie the courage and faith of our happy Martyrs. A diſguiſed corps is onely brought forth to the multitude either for laughter, or feare. Yet becauſe the very dead ſpeake for

truth in a loude ſilence; theſe ſpectacles are rare; and the graues of heretickes are become as cloſe as their death.
               Yet leſt (ſince neither liuing mouthes, nor faithfull pens may be ſuffered to inſinuate any truth) thoſe ſpeeches ſhould perhaps be receiued from the Ancients, which in vs were hereticall; the monuments of vnpartial antiquity muſt be depraued, all witneſſes that might ſpeake againſt them muſt be corrupted, with a fraudulent violence; and ſome of them purged to the death. So whiles ours are debarred, and the Ancients altered, poſteritie ſhal acknowledge no aduerſarie.
               What ſhould I ſpeake of thoſe plauſible deuices; which they haue inuented to make ſuperſtitious,

and fooliſh Proſelytes? Their proud vaunts of antiquity, vniuerſality, ſucceſsion, and the name of their fore-fathers, doe not only perſwade, but amaze, and beſot an ignorant heart. The glorious ſhews of their proceſsions, the gaudy ornaments of their Altars, the pompe and magnificence of the places, and maner of their Seruices, the triumphes of their great Feſtiuals, are enough to bewitch any childiſh, ſimple, or vaine beholders. VVho knowes not that nature is moſt led by ſenſe? Sure, children and fooles (ſuch are all meere naturall men) cannot be of any other religion.
               Beſides all theſe, their perſonall vndertakings, what for cunning, what for boldnes, could promiſe nothing but ſucceſſe. They can

transforme themſelues into all ſhapes; and in theſe falſe formes thruſt themſelues into al Courts, and companies, not oftner changing their habit, then their name. They can take the beſt opportunities to worke vpon thoſe which are either moſt vnable to reſiſt, or moſt like to beſtead them. That I may not ſpeake of the wrongs of vnſeaſonable trauell: wherein many vnſettled heads haue met dangers, and ſolicited errors: who like fond and idle Dinahs, going abroad to gaze, haue beene rauiſhed ere they returne. Neuer any bird was ſo laide for, by the ne
                     •
                  s and cals of the fowler, as the great heire of ſome noble family, or ſome fiery wit, is by theſe impoſtors. They know that greatneſſe is both lawleſſe, and commaunding;

if not by precept, yet by example: their very ſilence is perſuaſory, and imperious. But alas for that other ſexe: Still the diuel begins with Eue; ſtill his aſſault is ſtrongeſt, where is weakeſt reſiſtance. Simon Magus had his Helena, Nicholas the Deacon had his choros foemineos (as Hierome cals them.) Marcion had his Factoreſſe at Rome; Appelles his Philumena, Montanus his Priſca and Maximilla; Arrius his Conſtantines-ſiſter, Donatus his Lucilla, Elpidius his Agape, Priſcillianus his Galla: and our Ieſuites haue their painted Ladies (not dead, but liuing) both for obiects and inſtruments. VVhen they ſaw they could not blow vp religion with French powder into heauen, they now try by this Moabitiſh plot to ſinke it downe

to hell. Thoſe ſilly women, which are laden with ſinnes, and diuers luſts, muſt now bee the ſtalls of their ſpiritual fornications: But for that theſe enterpriſes want not danger; that both parts may ſecurely ſucceede, beholde publike liberty of diſpenſations, whether for diſſembled religion, or not vnprofitable filthineſſe. Theſe meanes are (like the Authors) diſhoneſt, and godleſſe. Adde (if you pleaſe) hereto, thoſe which pretend more innocent policy: their common dependances vpon one commaunder, their intelligences giuen, their charges receiued, their rewards and honors (perhaps of the Calender, perhaps of a red hat) duely conferred. Neither may the leaſt helpe be aſcribed to the conference of ſtudies;

(the conioyned labours of whole Societies directed to one end, and ſhrouded vnder the title of one Author:) to large maintenances, raiſed from the deathbeds of ſome guilty benefactors: from whence flow both infinite numbers, and incomparable helpes of Students. Vnder which head, for the time paſt, not a fewe are mooued by the remembrance of the bounteous hoſpitality of the religious; who hauing ingroſſed the world to themſelues, ſeemed liberal in giuing ſomething; like vnto ſome vaineglorious theeues, which hauing robbed wealthy Merchants, beſtow ſome pence vpon beggars. Further, the ſmothering, if not compoſing of their frequent ſtrifes, and confining of brawles within their

owne threſholds; with the nice men aging of their knowne oppoſitions, hath wonne many ignorant friends. Laſtly, the excellent correſpondence of their doctrines vnto nature, hath been their beſt ſolicitor. Wee haue examined particulars in a former Epiſtle: wherein we haue made it euident, that Popery affects nothing but to make nature either proud, or wanton: it offers difficulties, but carnall; and ſuch as the greateſt louer of himſelfe would eaſily imbrace for an aduantage. That we may therefore ſumme vp all; I neede not accuſe our careleſneſſe, indifferency, idleneſſe, looſe carriage; in all which, would God we had not aided them, and wronged our ſelues; Nor yet their zeale and forwardneſſe; worſe

meanes are guily of their gaine. In ſhort, the faire outſide which they ſet vpon Religion, which ſure is the beſt they haue, if not all; their pretended miracles, wilfull vntruths, ſtrait prohibitiōs, bloody &amp; ſecret inquiſitiōs, deprauations of Ancient witneſſes, expurgation of their owne; gay and gairiſh ſights, glorious titles, crafty changes of names, ſhapes, habits, conditions; inſinuations to the great oppugnation of the weaker ſexe; falſhood of anſwers, and oathes, diſpenſatons for ſinnes, vniting of forces, concealing of differences, largeneſſe of contributions, multitude of actors, and meanes, accordances to mens naturall diſpoſitions: Where wee on the contrary care not to ſeeme but to bee, diſclaime miracles,

dare not ſaue the life of religion with a lie; giue free ſcope to all pennes, to all tongues, to all eyes▪ ſhed no blood for religion: ſuffer al writers to ſpeake like themſelues; ſhew nothing but poore ſimplicity in our deuotions, got euer, and looke as wee are; teach the truth right-downe in an honeſt plaineneſſe, take no vantage of imbecillity: ſweare true, though we die; giue no hope of indulgence for euill; ſtudie each retyred to himſelfe, &amp; the muſes; publiſh our quarrels and aggrauate them▪ anger nature, and conquer it. Such gaine ſhall be grauell in their throates: ſuch loſſes to vs (in our not daring to ſinne) ſhall bee happy and victorious; in all other regards are both blame worthy, and recouerable. What dulneſſe is

this? Haue we ſuch a King, as in theſe liſts of Controuerſie, may dare to grapple with that great infallible Vicar, for his triple crown: Such Biſhops as may iuſtly challenge the whole Conſiſtory of Rome; ſo many learned Doctors, and Diuines, as no nation vnder heauen, more; ſo flouriſhing Vniuerſities as Chriſtendome hath none; ſuch bleſſed opportunities, ſuch encouragements; and now when we want nothing elſe, ſhal we be wanting to our ſelues? Yea aboue all theſe, the God of heauen fauours vs; and doe wee languiſh? The cauſe is his, and in ſpight of the gates of hell ſhall ſucceede, though wee were not: our neglect may ſlacken the pace of truth, cannot ſtay the paſſage. VVhy are we not as buſie, as ſuttle,

more reſolute? Such ſpirits, and ſuch hands as yours (reuerend Lord) muſt put life into the cold breſts of this frozen generation, and raiſe them vp to ſuch thoughts and indeuors, as may make the emulation of our aduerſaries equall to their enmitie.

                  EP. II. Shewing the differences of the preſent Church from the Apoſtolicall; and needleſneſſe of our conformity thereto in all things.
                  
               
               
                  I Feare not to ſay thoſe men are but ſuperſtitiouſly curious, (Right Reuerend, and honorable) which would call backe all circumſtances, to their firſt patternes. The Spouſe or Chriſt hath been euer cloathed with her owne rites: And as apparrell, ſo Religion

hath her faſhions, variable according to ages, and places: To reduce vs to the ſame obſeruations which were in Apoſtolicall vſe, were no better then to tye vs to the ſandals of the Diſciples, or the ſeamleſſe coate of our Sauiour. In theſe caſes, they did, what we need not: and we may, what they did not God meant vs no bondage in their example: their Canons binde vs whether for maners, or doctrine, not their Ceremonies. Neither Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles did all things for imitation: I ſpeake not of miraculous Acts. We neede not be ſilent before a Iudge, as Chriſt was; wee need not take a towel, and gird our ſelues, and waſh our ſeruants feet, as Chriſt did; we need not make tents for our liuing as Paul, nor go

armed as Peter; nor cary about our wiues, as he, and the other Apoſtles. I acknowledge the ground not onely of ſeparation, but Anabaptiſme; and wonder that theſe conceits doe not anſwere themſelues who can chooſe but ſee a manifeſt difference betwixt thoſe lawes, which Chriſt and his great Ambaſſadors made for eternall vſe, and thoſe rituall matters, which were confined to place, and time? Euery Nation, euery perſons ſinnes that obſerues not thoſe; Theſe for the moſt part, are not kept of the moſt; and are as well left without ſinne by vs, as vſed without preſcription or neceſsity by the Authors. Some of them we cannot doe; others wee neede not: which of vs can caſt out diuels by command? Who

can cure the ſicke by ointment, and impoſition of hands? The Diſciples did it. All thoſe Acts which proceeded from ſupernaturall priuiledge, ceaſed with their cauſe: who now dare vndertake to continue them? Vnleſſe perhaps ſome bold Papiſts, who haue brought in groſſe magicke inſtead of miraculous authoritie; and daube very chrcaſſes inſtead of healing diſeaſes. There be more yet, which we neede not doe: VVhat neede wee to chooſe Miniſters by Lot? VVhat neede we to diſclaime all peculiarity in goods? VVhat need wee to Chriſten in riuers; or to meete vpon their bankes? VVhat need wee to receiue Gods Supper after our owne? VVhat to leane in each others boſome while we receiue

it? what to abhorre leauen in that holy Bread? what to celebrate loue feaſts vpon the receipt? what to abſtaine from all ſtrangled and bloud? what to depend vpon a maintenance arbitrary, and vncertaine? what to ſpend our daies in a perpetuall pererration, as not onely the Apoſtles but the Prophets and Euangeliſts ſome ages after Chriſt? whoſoeuer would impoſe all theſe on vs, he ſhould ſurely make vs, not the Sonnes, but the ſlaues of the Apoſtles. Gods Church neuer helde her ſelfe in ſuch ſeruile termes; yea Chriſt himſelfe gaue at firſt ſome precepts of this nature, which he reuerſed ere long: when hee ſent the Diſciples to preach, hee charges, take not gold, nor ſiluer, nor money in your girdles; afterwards

                  Iudas carried the bag. He charges, not to take ſo much as a ſtaffe; yet after behold two ſwords: ſhould the Diſciples haue held their maſter to his owne rule? Is it neceſſary that what he once commaunded, ſhould be obſerued alwayes? The very next age to theſe Chriſtian Patriarcks, neither would nor durſt haue ſo much varied her rites, or augmented them if it had found it ſelfe tyed either to number, or kind: As yet it was pure, chaſt, and (which was the ground of all) perſecuted. The Church of Rome diſtributed the ſacramentall Bread: the Church of Alexandria permitted the people to take it: the Churches of Affricke and Rome, mixed their holy wine with water; other colder regions dranke it pure. Some kneeled in

their prayers, others fell proſtrate; and ſome lifted vp eies, hands, feet towards heauen: ſome kept their Eaſter according to the Iewiſh vſe the foureteenth of March; the French (as Nicephorus) the eight of the Calends of Aprill, in a ſet ſolemnity: the Church of Rome the Sunday after the fourteenth Moone; which yet (as Socrates truly writes) was neuer reſtrained by any Goſpell, by any Apoſtle. That Romiſh Victor ouercame the other world in this point, with too much rigour; whoſe cenſure therfore of the Aſian Churches was iuſtly cenſured, by Irenaeus. VVhat ſhould I ſpeake of their difference of facts? there can ſcarce bee more variety in daies, or meates. It hath euer beene thus ſeene, according to our Anſelmes rule, that the multitude

of different ceremonies in all Churches, hath iuſtly commended their vnitie in faith. The French Diuines preach couered (vpon the ſame rule which required the Corinthians to be vncouerd) we bare: The Dutch ſit at the Sacrament, we kneele; Geneua vſeth wafers, wee leauened bread; they common veſtures in Diuine ſeruice, we peculiar: each is free: no one doth either blames, or ouer rule others. I cannot but commend thoſe very Nouatian Biſhops (though it is a wonder any precedent of peace ſhould fall from ſchiſmaticks) who meeting in Councel together, enacted that Canon of indifferency, when the Church was diſtracted with the differences of her Paſchall ſolemnities; conluding how inſufficient,

this cauſe was to diſquiet the Church of Chriſt. Their owne iſſue (our Separatiſts) will needes be vnlike them in good; and ſtriue to a further diſtance from peace: whiles in a conceit not leſſe idle, thē ſcrupulous, they preſſe vs to an vniforme cōformity in our faſhions to the Apoſtles. Their owne practiſe condemnes them: They call for ſome, and yet keepe not all: yet the ſame reaſon enforces all, that pleads for ſome: and that which warrants the forbearance of ſome, holds for all. Thoſe tooles which ſerue for the foundation, are not of vſe for the roof. Yea the great maſter builder choſe thoſe workmen for the firſt ſtones which he meant not to imploy in the walls. Doe wee not ſee all Chriſts firſt agents extraordinary

Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, Prophets; Propheteſſes? See wee not fiery and clouen tongues deſcending▪ What Church euer ſince boaſted of ſuch founders; of ſuch meanes? Why wol
                     •
                  d God begin with thoſe which he meant not to continue, but to ſhew vs we may not alwayes looke for one face of things? The nurſe feeds and tends her child at firſt; afterward hee is vndertaken by the diſcipline of a Tutor; muſt he be alwaies vnder the ſpoone, and ferule, becauſe hee began ſo? If he haue good breeding, it matters not by whoſe hands. VVho can deny, that we haue the ſubſtance of all thoſe royall Lawes, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles left to his Church? what do we how thus importunately catching at ſhadows? If

there had beene a neceſsity of hauing what we want, or wanting what we haue, let vs not ſo farre wrong the wiſedome and perfection of the law-giuer, as to thinke he would not haue enioined that, and forbidden this. His ſilence in both argues his indifferency, and cals for ours; which while it is not peaceably intertayned, there is clamour without profite, malice without cauſe, and ſtrife without ende.

                  EP. III. Contayning the deſcription of a Chriſtian, and his differences from the worldling.
                  
               
               
                  MADAM.
               
               
                  IT is true that worldly eyes can ſee no difference, betwixt a Chriſtian, &amp; another man; the out-ſide of both is made of one clay, and caſt in one mould; both are inſpired with one common breath: Outward euents diſtinguiſh them not; thoſe, God

neuer made for euidences of loue, or hatred. So the ſēſes can perceiue no difference, betwixt the reaſonable ſoule, &amp; that which informes the beaſt: yet the ſoul knows there is much more, then betwixt their bodies. The ſame holds in this: Faith ſees more inward diffrence, then the eye ſees outward reſemblance. This point is not more high, then material: which that it may appeare, let me ſhew, what it is to be a Chriſtian: You that haue felt it, can ſecōd me with your experience; and ſupply the defects of my diſcourſe. He is the liuing temple of the liuing God, where the deity is both reſident &amp; worſhipped. The higheſt thing in a man is his owne ſpirit; but in a Chriſtian the ſpirit of God, which is the God of ſpirits. No grace is wanting in him;

&amp; thoſe which there are, want not ſtirring vp. Both his hart &amp; his hands are cleane: All his outward purity flowes from within; neither doth he frame his ſoul to counterfait good actiōs, but out of his holy diſpoſitiō, commands and produces them, in the ſight of God. Let vs begin with his beginning, and fetch the Chriſtian out of his nature, as another Abraham from his Chaldea: whiles the wordling liues and dies, in nature, out of God. The true conuert therfore after his wilde and ſecure courſes puts himſelfe (through the motions of gods ſpirit) to ſchoole vnto the lawe; there he learnes what he ſhould haue done, what hee could not do, what he hath done, what he hath deſerued. Theſe leſſons, coſt him many a ſtripe, and

many a teare, and not more griefe then terror: For this ſharpe maſter makes him feele what ſinne is, and what hell is: and in regard of both, what himſelfe is. When he hath well ſmarted vnder the whip of this ſeuere vſher, and is made vile enough in himſelfe, then is he led vp into the higher ſchoole of Chriſt, &amp; there taught the comfortable leſſons of grace; there he learnes, what belongs to a Sauiour, what one hee is, what he hath done, and for whom, how he became ours, we his; &amp; now finding himſelfe in a true ſtate of danger, of humilitie, of neede, of deſire, of fitnes for Chriſt, he brings home to himſelf al that he learns, and what he knowes he applies. His former Tutor he feared, this hee loueth; that ſhewed him his

wounds, yea made them: this binds and heales them: that killed him, this ſhewes him life, and leades him to it. Now at once he hates himſelfe, defies Satan, truſts to Chriſt, makes account both of pardon and glory. This is his moſt precious Faith, whereby he appropriates, yea in groſſes Chriſt Ieſus to himſelfe: whence hee is iuſtified from his ſinnes, purified from his corruptions, eſtabliſhed in his reſolutiōs, comforted in his doubts, defended againſt temptations, ouercomes all his enemies. Which vertue, as it is moſt imploied, and moſt oppoſed, ſo carries the moſt care from the Chriſtian hart, that it be ſound, liuely growing: Sound, not rotten, not hollow not preſumptuous: ſound in the Act; not a ſuperficiall conceit, but

a true, deepe, and ſenſible apprehenſion; an apprehenſion, not of the braine, but of the heart, and of the heart not approuing, or aſſenting, but truſting, and repoſing Sound in the obiect, none but Chriſt: he knows, that no friendſhip in heauen can do him good, without this; The Angells cannot: God will not: Ye beleeue in the Father, beleeue alſo in me.
               Liuely; for it cannot giue life, vnleſſe it haue life; the faith that is not fruitfull is dead: the fruits of faith are good workes: whether inward, within the roofe of the heart, as loue, awe, ſorrow, piety, zeale, ioy, and the reſt; or outward towards God, or our bretheren: obedience and ſeruice to the one: to the other reliefe and beneficence: Theſe he beares in his time:

ſometimes all, but alwayes ſome.
               Growing: true faith cannot ſtand ſtill, but as it is fruitfull in workes, ſo it increaſeth in degrees; from a little ſeede it proues a large plant, reaching from earth to heauen, and from one heauen to another: euery ſhowre and euery Sun addes ſomething to it. Neither is this grace euer ſolitary, but alwaies attended royallie: For hee that beleeues what a Sauiour hee hath, cannot but loue him: &amp; he that loues him cannot but hate whatſoeuer may diſpleaſe him: cannot but reioice in him, &amp; hope to inioy him, and deſire to enioy his hope, and contemne all thoſe vanities which he once deſired and enioyed. His minde now ſcorneth to grouell vpon earth, but ſoareth vp to the things aboue, where Chriſt

ſits at the right hand of God: and after it hath ſeene what is done in heauen, looks ſtrangely vpon al worldly things. He dare truſt his faith aboue his reaſon, and ſenſe▪ and hath learned to weane his appetite from crauing much: Hee ſtands in awe of his owne conſcience and dare no more offend it, then not diſpleaſe himſelfe. Hee feares not his enemies, yet neglects them not; equally auoiding ſecurity, and timorouſneſſe: Hee ſees him that is inuiſible; and walks with him awfully, familiarly. He knowes what he is borne to, and therefore digeſts the miſeries of his wardſhip, with patience: hee findes more comfort in his afflictions, then any worldling in pleaſures. And as hee hath theſe graces to comfort

him within, ſo hath hee the Angels to attend him without; ſpirits better then his owne, more powerfull, more glorious; Theſe beare him in their armes, wake by his bed, keepe his ſoule while hee hath it and receiue it when it leaues him. Theſe are ſome preſent differences, the greateſt are future, which could not bee ſo great, if themſelues were not witneſſes; no leſſe then betwixt heauen and hell, torment and glory, an incorruptible crowne, and fire vnquēchable. Whether Infidels be leeue theſe things or no, we know them: ſo ſhall they, but too late. What remaynes but that wee applaud our ſelues in this happines; &amp; walke on clearly in this heauenly profeſsiō? acknowledging that God could not do more for vs; &amp;

that we cānot do enough for him. Let others boaſt (as your Ladiſhip might with others) of ancient and noble houſes, large Patrimonies, or dowries, honourable commaunds; others of famous names, high and enuied honors, or the fauors of the greateſt; others of valor or beauty, or ſome perhaps of eminent learning and wit; it ſhall bee our pride that we are Chriſtians.

                  MEthinks children are like teeth, troubleſome both in the breeding, and looſing, &amp; oftentimes painful while they ſtand: yet ſuch, as we neither would, nor can well be without. I goe not about to comfort you thus late, for your loſſe, I rather congratulate your wiſe moderation, &amp; Chriſtian care of theſe firſt

ſpirituall priuiledges; deſiring only to ſatisfie you in what you hard as a witneſſe; not in what you needed as a mother. Children are the bleſsings of Parents, and baptiſme is the bleſsing of children, and parents: Wherein, there is not only vſe, but neceſsity; Neceſsity, not in reſpect ſo much of the end, as of the precept: God hath enioyned it, to the comfort of parents, and behoofe of children: which therefore, as it may not be ſuperſtitiouſly haſtened, ſo not negligently differred. That the contempt of baptiſme damneth, is paſt all doubt; but that the conſtrained abſence thereof, ſhould ſend infants to hel, is a cruell raſhneſſe. It is not their ſinne to die early: death is a puniſhment, not an offence; an effect of ſinne, not

a cauſe of torment; they want nothing but time; which they could not cōmand. Becauſe they could not liue a while longer, that therfore they ſhould die euerlaſtingly, is the hard ſentence of a bloody religion. I am onely ſorry, that ſo harſh an opinion ſhould bee graced with the name of a father, ſo reuerend, ſo diuine: whoſe ſentence yet, let no man pleade by halues. He who helde it vnpoſsible for a child to be ſaued vnleſſe the baptiſmall water were powred on his face, held it alſo as vnpoſsible, for the ſame infant, vnleſſe the ſacramētal bread were receiued into his mouth. There is the ſame ground for both, the ſame error in both, a weaknes fit for forgetfulnes; ſeeyet how ignorāt, or il meaning poſterity, could ſingle out one half of the

opinion for truth: and condemne the other of falſhood. In ſpight of whom, one part ſhall eaſily conuince the other; yea without al force, ſince both cannot ſtand, both will fall together, for company. The ſame mouth, which ſaid, vnleſſe ye be borne againe of water, and the holy Ghoſt, ſaid alſo, Except yee eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood: An equall neceſſity of both. And leſt any one ſhould plead different interpretations, the ſame Saint Auſtin auerres this later opinion alſo, concerning the neceſſary communicating of children, to haue beene once the common iudgement of the Church of Rome: A ſentence ſo diſpleaſing, that you ſhall finde Index Expurg. the memory of it noted with a

blacke coale, &amp; wip't out in that infamous bill of Expurgations. Had the ancient Church held this deſperate ſequele, what ſtrange, and yet wilful cruelty had it bene in them, to deferre baptiſme a whole yearelong: till Eaſter, or that Sunday, which hath his name (I thinke) from the white robes of the baptiſed?
               Yea what an aduenture was it in ſome, to adiourne it till their age (with Conſtantine) if being vnſure of their life, they had beene ſure the preuention of death wold haue inferred damnation? Looke vnto that legall Sacrament of circumciſion, which (contrary to the fancies of our Anabaptiſts) directly anſweres this Euangelicall. Before the eight day they could not bee circumciſed: before

the eight day they might die. If dying the ſeuenth day, they were neceſſarily condemned: eyther the want of a day is a ſinne, or God ſometimes condemneth not for ſin: Neither of them poſſible, neither according with the iuſtice of the Law-giuer. Or if from this parallell, you pleaſe to looke either to reaſon or example, the caſe is cleare. Reaſon; No man that hath faith, can bee condemned; for Chriſt dwels in our harts by faith: and he in whom Chriſt dwels cannot bee a reprobate. Now it is poſsible a man may haue a ſauing ſaith, before baptiſme: Abraham firſt beleeued to iuſtification: then after receiued the ſigne of circumciſion, as a ſeale of the righteouſnes of that faith, which he had when he was vncircumciſed:

Therefore ſome dying before their baptiſme, may, yea muſt be ſaued. Neither was Abrahams caſe ſingular; he was the Father of all them alſo, which beleeue, not being circumciſed: theſe, as they are his Sons in faith, ſo in righteouſneſſe; ſo in ſaluation: vncircumciſion cannot hinder, where faith admitteth; Theſe following his ſteps of beleefe before the ſacrament, ſhal doubtleſſe reſt in his boſome, without the ſacrament; without it, as fataly abſent, not as willingly neglected. It is not the water, but the faith: not the putting away the filth of the fleſh (ſaith Saint Peter) but the ſtipulation of a good conſcience; for who takes Baptiſme without a ful faith (ſaith Hierome) takes the water, takes not the ſpirit;

VVhence is this ſo great vertue of the water, that it ſhould touch the body, and cleanſe the heart (ſaith Auſten) vnleſſe by the power of the word, not ſpoken, but beleeued? Thou ſeeſt water (ſaith Ambroſe:) euery water heales not, that water onely heals which hath the grace of God annexed; And if there bee any grace in the water (ſaith Baſill) it is not of the nature of the water, but of the preſence of the ſpirit. Baptiſme is indeed, as S. Ambroſe ſtiles it, the paune and image of our reſurrection, yea (as Baſil) the power of God to reſurrectiō: but (as Ignatius expoundes this phraſe aright) beleeuing in his death, wee are by baptiſme made partakers of his reſurrection. Baptiſme therefore without faith cannot ſaue a man,

and by faith doth ſaue him; and faith without baptiſme (where it cannot be had; not where it may be had, and is contemned) may ſaue him: That Spirit which workes by meanes, will not bee tyed to meanes.
               Examples. Caſt your eyes vpon that good theefe: good in his death, though in his life abhominable: hee was neuer waſhed in lordan, yet is receiued into Paradiſe; his ſoble was foule with rapines, and iniuſtice, yea bloody with murders: and yet being ſcouted onely with the blood of his Sauiour, not with water of baptiſme; it is preſented glorious to God. I ſay nothing of the ſoules of Traian, and Falconella, meere heathens, liuing and dying without Chriſt, without baptiſme:

which yet their honeſt Legend reports deliuered from hell, tranſported to heauen, not ſo much as ſcorched in Purgatorie: The one by the prayers of Gregory, the other of Tecla. VVhat partiality is this to deny that to the children of Chriſtians, which they grant to knowne, infidels? The promiſe is made to vs, and our ſeed; not to thoſe that are without the pale of the Church. Thoſe Innocents which were maſſacred for Chriſt, are by them canonized for Saints, and make one day in their Calendar (each yeare) both holy, and diſmall; whereof yet ſcarce any liued to know water, none to know baptiſme. Yea, all Martyrs are here priuiledged; who are Chriſtened in their owne blood, inſtead of water: but where hath

God ſaide, All that die without baptiſme, ſhall die for euer, except Martyrs? why not, except beleeuers? It is faith that giues life to Martyrs; which if they ſhould want, their firſt death could not auoyde the ſecond. Ambroſe doubted not to ſay, his Valentinian was baptiſed, becauſe hee deſired it; not becauſe he had it: he knew the minde of God, who accounts vs to haue what we vnfaynedly wiſh.
               Children cannot liue to deſire baptiſme, if their parents deſire it for them, why may not the deſire of others be theirs, as well as (according to Auſtins opinion) the faith of othērs beleeuing, and the mouth of others confeſsing? In theſe caſes therefore of any ſoules but our owne, it is ſafe to ſuſpend,

and dangerous to paſſe iudgement. Secret things to God: Hee that made all ſoulesv, knowes what to doe with them, neither will make vs of counſaile: But if we define either way, the errors of charity are inoffenſiue. wee muſt honour good meanes and vſe them, and in their neceſſarie want depend vpon him, who can worke, beyond, without, againſt meanes.
               Thus haue I endeauoured your Ladiſhips ſatisfaction in what you heard, not without ſome ſcruple. If any man ſhall blame my choice in troubling you with a thorny, and ſcholaſticall diſcourſe, let him know that I haue learned this faſhion of St. Hierome the Oracle of Antiquitie, who was wont to entertaine his Paula, and

                  Euſtochium, Marcella, Principia, Hedibia, and other deuout Ladies, with learned canuaſes of the deep pointes of Diuinity. This is not ſo perplexed, that it need to offend: nor ſo vnneceſſary, that it may bee vnknowne.

                  EP. V. Diſcourſing of the comfortable remedies of all afflictions.
                  
               
               
                  WIſe men ſeeke remedies before their diſeaſe: ſenſible patients, when they beginne to complaine: fooles, too late. Afflictions are the common maladies, of Chriſtians: Theſe you feele, and vpon the firſt grones ſeeke for eaſe. VVherefore ſerues the tongue of the learned, but to ſpeake wordes in ſeaſon? I am a ſcholer of thoſe

that can comfort you: If you ſhall with mee, take out my leſſons, neither of vs ſhall repent it. You ſmart and complaine, take heed leaſt too much: There is no affliction not grieuous: the bone that was diſioynted, cannot bee ſet right without paine. No potion can cure vs, if it worke not: it workes not, except it make vs ſicke: wee are contented with that ſickeneſſe, which is the way to health. There is a vexation without hurt: ſuch is this: We are afflicted, not ouer-preſſed; needy, not deſperate; perſecuted not forſaken, caſt downe but periſh not. How ſhould we, when all the euil in a Citie comes from the prouidence of a good God; which can neither be impotent, nor vnmercifull? It is the Lord, let him

doe what he will. VVoe were vs if euils could come by chance; or were let looſe to alight where they liſt: now they are oueruled; wee are ſafe. The deſtinie of our ſorrowes is written in heauen by a wiſe and eternall decree: Behold he that hath ordained, moderates them. A faithfull God, that giues aniſſue with the tentation: An iſſue, both of their end, and their ſucceſſe. He chides not alwayes, much leſſe ſtriketh; Our light afflictions are but for a moment, not ſo long, in reſpect of our vacancy; and reſt. If we weepe ſomtimes, our teares are precious; As they ſhall neuer be dry in his bottle, ſo they ſhall ſoone be dry vpon our cheekes. Hee that wrings them from vs, ſhal wipe them off: how ſweetly doth he interchange

our ſorrows, and ioyes, that wee may neither be vaine, nor miſerable? It is true; to be ſtrooke, once in anger, is fearefull: his diſpleaſure is more then his blow: In both, our God is a conſuming fire. Feare not, theſe ſtripes are the tokens of his loue: hee is no Son, that is not beaten; yea till he ſmart, and cry; if not till he bleed: no parent corrects anothers child, and he is no good parent, that corrects not his owne. Oh rod worthy to be kiſſed, that aſſures vs of his loue, of our adoption! VVhat ſpeake I of no hurt? ſhort prayſes doe but diſcommend, I ſay more, theſe euills are good: looke to their effects. What is good if not patience? affliction is the mother of it; tribulation bringeth forth patience. VVhat

can earth or heauen yeeld better then the aſſurance of Gods ſpirit? Afflictions argue, yea ſeale this to vs. Wherein ſtands perfect happineſſe, if not in our neare reſemblance of Chriſt? VVhy was man created happy, but becauſe in Gods image? The glory of Paradiſe, the beauty of his body, the duty of the creatures, could not giue him felicity without the likeneſſe to his creator. Behold, what we loſt in our height, we recouer in our miſery; a conformity to the Image of the Sonne of God: hee that is not like his elder brother, ſhall neuer be coheire with him. Lo his ſide, temples, hands, feet, all bleeding: his face blubbred ghaſtly, &amp; ſpitted on: his skin al pearled with a bloody ſweate, his head drouping, his ſoule heauy

to the death: ſee you the worldling merry, ſoft, delicate, perfumed, neuer wrinkled with ſorrow, neuer humbled with afflictions? What reſemblance is here, yea what contrariery? Eaſe ſlayeth the foole; it hath made him reſty, and leaues him miſerable. Be not deceiued; No man can follow Chriſt without his Groſſe; much leſſe reach him and if none ſhall reigne with Chriſt, but theſe that ſuffer with him; what ſhall become of theſe iolly ones? Go now thou dainty worldling, and pleaſe thyſelfe in thy happines, laugh alwaies, and bee euer applauded; It is a wofull felicity that thou ſhalt find in oppoſition to thy redeemer: He hath ſaide, woe to them that laugh; Beleeueſt thou, and doſt not weepe at thy laughter?

and with Salomon, condemne it of madnes? And againe, with the ſame breath, Bleſſed are ye that weepe: who can beleeue this, and not reioyce in his owne teares, and not pitty the faint ſmiles of the godleſſe? Why bleſſed? For ye ſhal laugh: Behold we that weepon earth, ſhal laugh in heauen: wee that now weepe with men, ſhall laugh with Angels; while the fleering worldling, ſhal be gnaſhing, and howling with diuels: we that weepe for a time, ſhall laugh for euer: who would not be content to differ his ioy a little, that it may be perpetuall, and infinite? VVhat mad man would purchaſe this crackling of thornes (ſuch is the wordlings ioy) with eternal ſhrieking &amp; tormēt? he that is the dore and the way, hath taught vs, that

through many afflictions wee muſt enter into heauen. There is but one paſſage, and that a ſtrait one: It with much preſſure wee can get through, and leaue but our ſuperfluous rags as torne from vs in the crowd; we are happy. Hee that made heauen, hath on purpoſe thus framed it; wide when we are entred; and glorious narrow and hard in the entrance: that after our paine, our glory might be ſweeter. And if before hand you can climbe vp thither in your thoughts; looke about you, you ſhall ſee no more palmes, then croſſes: you ſhall ſee none crown'd, but thoſe that haue wreſtled: with croſſes and ſo rows, to ſweat, yea to blood; and haue ouercome. All runs here to the ouercommer, and ouercomming

implies both fighting, and ſucceſſe. Girde vp your loynes therefore, and ſtrengthen your weake knees, reſolue to fight for heauen, to ſuffer in fighting, to perſiſt in ſuffering; ſo perſiſting you ſhall ouercome, and ouercomming you ſhall bee crowned. Oh reward truely great, aboue deſert, yea, aboue conceit. A crowne for a fewe groanes: And eternall crowne of life and glory, for a ſhort and moment any ſuffering: How iuſt is Saint Pauls account, that the afflictions of this preſent life are not worthy of the glory which ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs? O Lord let me ſmart that I may reigne; vphold thou me in ſmarting, that thou mayeſt holde mee worthy of reigning. It is no matter how vile I be, ſo I may be glorious.

VVhat ſay you? would you not bee afflicted? VVhether had you rather mourne for a while, or for euer; One muſt bee choſen: the election is eaſie: Whether had you rather reioyce for one fit or alwayes? You would doe both. Pardon me; it is a fond couetouſnes, and idle ſingularity to affect it. What? That you alone may fare better then all Gods Saints? That God ſhould ſtrew Carpets for your nice feet onely, to walke into your heauen, and make that way ſmooth for you, which all Patriarks, Prophets, Euangeliſts, Confeſſors, Chriſt himſelfe, haue found rugged and bloody? Away with this ſelfe loue; and come downe you ambitious Sonne of Zebedee: and ere you thinke of ſitting neare the

throne, bee content to bee called vnto the Cup. Now is your tryall; Let your Sauiour ſee how much of his bitter potion you can pledge; then ſhall you ſee how much of his glory he can afford you. Be content to drinke of his Vineger, and gall, and you ſhall drinke new wine with him in his kingdome.

                  EP. VI. Diſcourſing of the late French occurrents, and what vſe God expects to be made of them.
                  
               
               
                  SInce your trauels here with vs, wee haue not forgotten you; but ſince that, your witty and learned trauels in the common affaires of Religion haue made your memory both freſh, and bleſſed. Beholde, whiles your hand was happily buſie in the defence of our King, the heads

and hands of traitors were buſie in the maſſacring of your owne. God doth no memorable, and publick act, which he would not haue talked of, read, conſtrued of all the world. How much more of neighbours, whom ſcarce a ſea ſeuereth from each other? how much yet more of brethren, whom neither land, nor ſea, can ſeuer? Your dangers, and feares, and griefes haue beene ours: All the ſalt water that runs betwixt vs, cannot waſh off our intereſt in all your common cauſes: The deadly blow of that miſcreant (whoſe name is iuſtly ſentenced to forgetfulneſſe) pierced euen our ſides. VVho hath not bled within himſelfe, to thinke that he, which had ſo victoriouſly out-liued the ſwordes of enemies, ſhould fall

by the knife of a villaine? and that he ſhould die in the peaceable ſtreets, whom no fields could kil? that all thoſe honorable and happy triumphs ſhould end in ſo baſe a violence? But oh our idleneſſe, and impietie, if we ſee not a diuine hād from aboue, ſtriking with this hand of diſloyalty. Sparrows fall not to the ground without him much leſſe Kings; One dyes by a tyle-ſheard, another by the ſplinters of a Launce, one by Lice, another by a Fly, one by poyſon, another by a knife; VVhat are all theſe but the executioners of that great God, which hath ſaide, Ye are Gods, but ye ſhall die like men? Perhaps God ſaw (that wee may gueſſe modeſtly at the reaſons of his acts) you repoſed too much, in this arme of fleſh; or

Perhaps he ſaw this ſcourge would haue beene too early, to thoſe enemies, whoſe ſin, though great, yet was not full: or perhaps hee ſaw, that if that great ſpirit had beene deliberately yeelded in his bed, you ſhold not haue ſlept in yours: Or perhaps the auncient conniuence at thoſe ſtreames of bloud, from your too common deels, was now called to reckning; or, it may be, that weake reuolt from the truth. He whoſe the rod was, knows why he ſtrooke: yet may it not paſſe without a note, that he fell by that religion, to which he fell. How many ages might that great monarch haue liued (whatſoeuer the ripe head of your more then mellow Cotton could imagine) ere his leaſt finger ſhould haue bled, by the hand of an Huguenot?

All religions may haue ſome monſters; but bleſſed be the God of heauen, ours ſhall neuer yeeld that good Ieſuite, either a Mariana to teach treaſon, or a Rauillac to act it. But what is that we heare? It is no maruell: That holy Society is a fit Gardian for the hearts of kings: I dare ſay, none more loues to ſee them: none takes more care to purchaſe them. How happy were that Chappell (think they) if it were full of ſuch ſhrines? I hope all Chriſtian Princes haue long, and well learned (ſo great is the courteſie of theſe good Fathers) that they ſhall neuer (by their willes) neede bee troubled with the charge of their owne heartes. An heart of a KING in a Ieſuites hand, is as proper, as a

wafer in a Prieſts. Iuſtly was it written of old, vnder the picture of Ignatius Loyola, Cauete vobis Principes; Be wiſe O ye Princes, and learne to be the keepers of your owne hearts. Yea rather, O thou keeper of Iſrael, that neither ſlumbreſt nor ſleepeſt, keepe thou the hearts of al Chriſtian Kings, whether aliue or dead, from the keeping of this traiterous generation; whoſe very religion is wholy rebellion, and whoſe merits bloody. Doubtleſſe, that murderer hoped to haue ſtabbed thouſands with that blow, and to haue let out the life of religion, at the ſide of her collapſed Patron: God did at once laugh and frowne at his proiect; and ſuffred him to liue to ſee himſelfe, no leſſe a foole then a villaine: Oh the infinite

goodneſſe of the wiſe, and holy gouernor of the world; who could haue looked for ſuch a calme in the middeſt of a tempeſt? who wold haue thought that violence could beget peace? Who durſt haue conceiued that King Henry ſhould die alone? and that Religion ſhould looſe nothing but his perſon? This is the Lords doing, and it is marueilous in our eyes. You haue now parallel'd vs: Out of both our feares hath God fetched ſecurity: oh that out of our ſecurity, we could as eaſily fetch feare: not ſo much of euill, as of the Author of good; and yet truſt him in our feare, and in both magnifie him. Yea, you haue by this act gained ſome conuerts, againſt the hope of the agents: neither can I without many ioyfull

congratulations, thinke of the eſtate of your Church; which euery day honours with the acceſſe of new clients; whoſe teares and ſad confeſsions make the Angels to reioyce in heauen, &amp; the Saints on earth. Wee ſhould giue you example, if our peace were as plentifull of goodneſſe as of pleaſure. But how ſeldom hath the Church gained by eaſe? or loſt by reſtraint? Bleſſe you God for our proſperity, and wee ſhall praiſe him for your progreſſe.

                  EP. VII. Exciting him, and (in him) all others to early and chearfull beneficence: ſhewing the neceſsity and benefit of good workes.
                  
               
               
                  SIR, I trouble you not with reaſons of my writing, or with excuſds: If I doe ill, no plea can warrant mee; If well, I cannot bee diſcouraged with any cenſures. I craue not your pardon, but your acceptation. It is no preſumption to giue good counſell; and preſents of loue feare not to bee ill taken of

ſtrangers. My pen and your ſubſtance are both giuen vs for one end, to doe good: Theſe are our talents, how happy are we if wee can improue them well: ſuffer me to doe you good with the one that with the other, you may doe good to many, and moſt to your ſelfe. You cannot but know, that your full hand, and worthy purpoſes haue poſſeſſed the world with much expectation: what ſpeake I of the world? whoſe honeſt and reaſonable claymes yet, cannot bee contemned with honour, nor diſappointed without diſhonour. The God of heauen, which hath lent you this aboundance, and giuen you theſe gracious thoughts of charity; of piety, looks long for the iſſue of both: &amp; wil eaſily complaine either of too

little or too late. Your wealth and your will are both good, but the firſt is onely made good by the ſecond for if your hand were ful, and your heart empty, we who now applaud you, ſhould iuſtly pitty you, you might haue riches, not goods, not bleſsings: your burthen ſhould be greater, then your eſtate; and you ſhould be richer in ſorrowes, then in mettalls. For (if wee looke to no other world) what gaine is it to be the keeper of the beſt earth? That which is the common cofer of all the rich mines, we doe but tread vpon; and account it vile, becauſe it doth but holde, and hide thoſe treaſures. Whereas the skilfull metaliſt that findeth, and refineth thoſe precious veines, for publick vſe, is rewarded, is honoured.

The very baſeſt Element yeeldes golde; the ſauage Indian gets it, the ſeruile prentiſe workes it, the very Midianitiſh Camell may weare it, the miſerable worldling admires it, the couetous lew ſwallowes it, the vnthrifty Ruffian ſpends it: what are al theſe the better for it? Onely good vſe giues praiſe to earthly poſſeſsions. Here in therfore you owe more to God, that he hath giuen you an heart to doe good a will to bee as rich in good workes, as great in riches. To be a friend to this Mammon, is to be an enemie to God: but to make friends with it, is roiall, and Chriſtian. His enemies may be wealthie, none but his friends can either be good, or doe good: Da &amp; accipe, ſaith the wiſe man. The Chriſtian which muſt imitate

the hie patterne of his creator, knows his beſt riches to be bounty; God that hath all, giues all; reſerues nothing. And for himſelfe; he well conſiders, that God hath not made him an owner, but a ſeruant: and of ſeruants a ſeruant, not of his goods but of the giuer; not a treaſurer, but a Steward: whoſe praiſe is more to lay out well, then to haue receiued much. The greateſt gaine therfore that he affects, is an euen reckning, a cleare diſcharge: which ſince it is obtained by diſpoſing, not by keeping, he counts reſeruation loſſe, and iuſt expence his trade, and ioy; he knowes, that Well done faithfull ſeruant, is a thouſand times more ſweet a note, then Soule take thine eaſe; for that is the voyce of the maſter recompencing, this of

the carnall heart preſuming: and what follows to the one, but his maſters ioy? what to the other, but the loſſe of his ſoule? Bleſſed bee that God which hath giuen you an heart to fore thinke this, and in this dry, and dead age, a will to honour him with his own: and to credit his Goſpell, with your beneficence; Lo we are vpbrayded with barrenneſſe: your name hath beene publikly oppoſed to theſe challenges, as in whom it ſhall be ſeene, that the truth hath friends that can giue. I neither diſtruſt, nor perſwade you, whoſe reſolutions are happily fixed on purpoſes of good: onely giue mee leaue to haſten your pace a little, and to excite your Chriſtian forwardneſſe, to begin ſpeedily, what you haue long and

conſtantly vowed. You would not but doe good; why not now? I ſpeake boldly, the more ſpeede, the more comfort: Neither the times are in our diſpoſing, nor our ſelues: if God had ſet vs a day, and made our wealth inſeparable, there were no danger in delaying; now our vncertainty either muſt quicken vs, or may deceiue vs. How many haue meant wel, and done nothing, and loſt their crowne with lingring? whoſe deſtinies haue preuented their deſires, and haue made their good motions the wards of their executors, not without miſerable ſucceſſe: to whō, that they wold haue done good, is not ſo great a praiſe, as it is a diſhonor that they might haue done it: their wracks are our warnings, we are equally mortal,

equally fickle. Why haue you this reſpite of liuing, but to preuent the imperious neceſſity of death? it is a woful and remedileſſe complaint, that the end of our dayes hath ouer-runne the beginning of our good workes. Early beneficence hath no danger, many ioies: for the conſcience of good done, the prayers and bleſsings of the releeued, the gratulations of the Saints, are as ſo many perpetuall comforters, which can make our life pleaſant, and our death happy our euill dayes good, and our good better. All theſe are loſt with delay, few and cold are the prayers for him that may giue: &amp; in lieu, our good purpoſes fore flowed, are become our tormenters vpon our dead-bed. Little difference is betwixt good differred, and euill

done: Good was meant, who hindered it, will our conſcience ſay? there was time enough, meanes enough, neede enough, what hindered? Did feare of enuy, diſtruſt of want? Alas what bugs are theſe to fright men from heauen? As if the enuy of keeping, were leſſe then of beſtowing: As if God were not as good a debtor, as a giuer: he that giues to the poore lendes to God, ſaith wiſe Salomon; If hee freely giue vs what wee may lend, and grace to giue; will he not much more pay vs what wee haue lent; and giue vs becauſe wee haue giuen? That is his bounty, this his iuſtice▪ Oh happy is that man that may be a creditor to his maker: Heauen and earth, ſhall be empty before he ſhall want a royall payment. If wee dare not truſt God

whiles we liue, how dare we truſt men when we are dead? Men that are ſtill deceitfull, and light vpon the ballance, light of truth, heauy of ſelfe-loue. How many executors haue proued the executioners of honeſt wills? how many haue our eies ſeen, that after moſt carefull choiſe of truſtie guardians, haue had their children and goods ſo diſpoſed, as if the parents ſoule could returne to ſee it, I doubt whether it could be happy? How rare is that man that prefers not himſelfe to his dead friend? profit to truth? that will take no vantage of the impoſsibility of account? What euer therefore men either ſhew, or promiſe, happy is that man that may bee his owne auditor, ſuperuiſor, executor. As you loue God and your ſelfe, be not afraid

of being happie too ſoone. I am not worthy to giue ſo bolde aduice, let the wiſe ſonne of Syrach ſpeake for me. Do good before thou die, and according to thine ability ſtretch out thine hands, and giue: Defraud not thy ſelfe of thy good day; and let not the portion of thy good deſires ouerpaſſe thee: Shalt thou not leaue thy trauels to another, and thy labours to them that will deuide thine heritage? Or let a wiſer then he, Salomon: Say not, tomorrow I will giue, if thou now haue it: for thou knoweſt not what a day will bring forth. It hath beene an old rule of liberality, he giues twiſe that giues quickly, whereas ſlow benefites argue vnchearefulneſſe, and loſe their worth. Who lingers his receits is

condemned as vnthriftie: he that knoweth both, ſaith, it is better to giue, then to receiue. If we be of the ſame ſpirit, why are we haſty in the worſe, and ſlacke in the better? Suffer your ſelfe therfore good Sir, for Gods ſake, for the Goſpels ſake, for the Churches ſake, for your ſoules ſake, to bee ſtirred vp by thoſe poore lines, to a reſolute and ſpeedy performing of your worthy intentions: and take this as a louing inuitation ſent from heauen, by an vnworthie meſſenger. You cānot deliberate long of fit obiects for your beneficence, except it be more for multitude, then want: the ſtreets, yea the world is full; How doth Lazarus lie at euery dore? how many Sons of the Prophets in their meanely-prouided Colledges may ſay, not,

                  Mors in olla, but Fames? how many Churches may iuſtly pleade, that which our Sauiour bad his Diſciples, The Lord hath need? And if this infinite ſtore hath made your choyce doubtfull, how eaſie were it to ſhew you, wherein you might oblige the whole Church of God to you, and make your memoriall both eternall, and bleſſed; or, if you had rather, the whole common wealth? But now I find my ſelfe too bold and too buſie, in thus looking toward particularities: God, ſhall direct you, and if you follow him, ſhall crowne you: howſoeuer, if good be done, and that be times: he hath what hee deſired, and your ſoule ſhall haue more then you can deſire. The ſucceſſe of my weake yet hearty counſell, ſhall make me as

rich, as God hath made you with all your aboundance. That God bleſſe it to you, and make both our recknings chearfull in the day of our common audit.

                  EP. VIII. Remedies againſt dulneſſe and hartleſneſſe in our callings, and encouragements to chearefulneſſe in labour.
                  
               
               
                  IT falls out not ſeldom (if we may meſure all by one) that the mind ouer layed with worke, grows dull, and heauy: and now doth nothing, becauſe it hath done too much; ouer lauiſh expence of ſpirits hath left it heartleſſe: As the

beſt veſſell with much motion and vent, becomes flat, and dreggiſh. And not fewer (of more weaker temper) diſcourage themſelues with the difficultie of what they muſt doe: ſome trauailers haue more ſhrunke at the Mappe then at the way? Betwixt both, how many ſit ſtil with their hands folded; and wiſh they knew how to be rid of time? If this euill bee not cured, we become miſerable loſers, both of good houres, and of good parts. In theſe mentall diſeaſes, Empiricks are the beſt Phiſitians. I preſcribe you nothing but out of feeling: If you will auoide the firſt: moderate your own vehemencie; ſuffer not your ſelfe to do all you could do: Riſe euer from your deske, not without an appetite. The beſt

horſe will tire ſooneſt, if the reine lie euer looſe in his necke: Reſtraints in theſe caſes are incouragements: obtaine therefore of your ſelfe to deferre, and take new daies: How much better is it to refreſh your ſelfe, with many competent meales, then to buy one daies glutonie: with the faſt of many? And if it be hard to call off the mind, in the midſt of a faire and likely flight; know that all our eaſe and ſafetie begins at the commaund of our ſelues: hee can neuer taske himſelfe wel, that cannot fauour himſelfe. Perſwade your heart that perfection comes by leaſure: and no excellent thing is done at once: the riſing and ſetting of many Sunnes (which you thinke ſlackens your worke) in truth ripens it. That gourd which

came vp in a night, withered in a day; whereas thoſe plants which abide age, riſe ſlowly. Indeede, where the heart is vnwilling, prorogation hinders: what I liſt not to doe this day, I loath the next; but where is no want of deſire, delay doth but ſharpen the ſtomach. That which we doe vnwillingly leaue, we long to vndertake, &amp; the more our affection is, the greater our intention, and the better our performance. To take occaſion by the foretop, is no ſmall point of wiſedome; but to make time (which is wilde and fugitiue) tame and pliable to our purpoſes, is the greateſt improuement of a man: All times ſerue him, which hath the rule of himſelfe.
               If the ſecond, thinke ſeriouſly

of the conditiō of your being: It is that we were made for; the birde to flie, and man to labour. What doe wee here if wee repine at our worke? we had not beene, but that we might be ſtill buſie; if not in this taske we diſlike, yet in ſome other of no leſſe toile: There is no act that hath not his labor, which varies in meaſure according to the will of the doer. This which you complaine of, hath beene vndertaken by others, not with facilitie only, but with pleaſure; &amp; what you chooſe for eaſe, hath beene abhorred of others, as tedious. All difficultie is not ſo much in the worke, as in the Agent. To ſet the minde on the racke of long meditation (you ſay) is a torment: to follow the ſwift foote of your hound alday long, hath no

wearineſſe: what would you ſay of him that finds better game in his ſtudie, then you in the fielde, and would account your diſport his puniſhment? ſuch there are, though you doubt and wonder. Neuer think to detract from your buſineſſe, but adde to your will. It is the policie of our great enemie, to driue vs with theſe feares, from that hee fore-ſees would grow profitable: like as ſome inhoſpitall Sauages make fearefull deluſions by ſorcery, vpon the ſhore, to fright ſtrangers from landing. Where you find therfore motions of reſiſtance, awaken your courage the more, &amp; know there is ſome good that appeares not; vaine indeauors find no oppoſition. Al croſſes implie a ſecret commoditie: reſolue then to will

becauſe you begin not to will: and either oppoſe your ſelfe, as Satan oppoſes you, or elſe you doe nothing. We pay no price to God for any good thing, but labour; if we higgle in that, we are worthy to loſe our bargaine. It is an inualuable gaine, that we may make in this trafique: for God is bountifull, as well as iuſt, and when he ſees true indeauour, doth not only ſell, but giue: whereas idlenes neither gets nor ſaues, nothing is either more fruitleſſe of good, or more fruitfull of euill; for we doe ill whiles wee doe nothing, and loſe, whiles we gaine not. The ſluggard is ſenſeleſſe, and ſo much more deſperate, becauſe hee cannot complaine: but (though hee feele it not) nothing is more precious then time, or that ſhall abide

a reckning more ſtrict and fearefull: yea this is the meaſure of all our actions, which if it were not abuſed, our accounts could not be but euen with God: ſo God eſteemes it (what euer our pride be) that he plagues the loſſe of a ſhort time, with a reuenge beyond all times. Houres haue wings, and euery moment flies vp to the author of time, and carries newes of our vſage: All our prayers cannot intreate one of them either to returne, or ſlacken his pace: the miſpenſe of euery minute is a new record againſt vs in heauen. Sure, if we thought thus, wee would diſmiſſe them with better reports, and not ſuffer them either to goe away empty, or laden with dangerous intelligence; how happy is it that euery

houre ſhould conuey vp, not only the meſſage, but the fruits of good, and ſtay with the Ancient of daies, to ſpeake for vs before his glorious throne? know this and I ſhall take no care for your pains, nor you, for paſtime. None of our profitable labours ſhall be tranſient, but euen when wee haue forgotten them, ſhall welcome vs into ioy: wee thinke wee haue left them behind vs, but they are forwarder then our ſouls, and expect vs where wee would be. And if there were no crowne for theſe toiles, yet without future reſpects there is a tediouſneſſe in doing nothing. To man eſpecially, motion is natural: there is neither minde, nor eie, nor ioint which mooueth not: And as company makes way ſhort,

houres neuer goe away ſo merrily, as in the fellowſhip of worke. How did that induſtrious heathen draw out water by night, and knowledge by day, &amp; thoght both ſhort, euer labouring onely that he might labour? Certainely if idleneſſe were enacted by authoritie, there would not want ſome, which would pay their mulct, that they might worke and thoſe ſpirits are likeſt to heauen, which moues alwaies, and the freeſt from thoſe corruptions, which are incident to nature: The running ſtreame cleanſeth it ſelfe, whereas ſtanding ponds breede weedes, and mud. Theſe meditations muſt hearten vs to that we muſt do: whiles we are cheareful, our labours ſhall ſtriue whether to yeeld vs more comfort, or others more profit.

                  EP. IX. Diſcuſſing this Queſtion.
                  
                     Whether a man and wife after ſome yeares mutuall, and louing fruition of each other, may vpon conſent, whether for ſecular, or religious cauſes, vowe and performe a perpetuall ſeparation from each others bed, and abſalutely renounce all carnall knowledge of each other for euer.
                  
               
               
                  I Wiſh not my ſelfe any other aduocate, nor you any other aduerſarie, then Saint Paule who neuer gaue (I ſpeake boldly)

a direct precept, if not in this: his expreſſe charge whereupon I inſiſted, is Defraude, not one another, except with conſent for a time, that you may giue your ſelues to faſting and praier, and then againe come together, that Satan tempt you not, for your incontinency. Euery word (if you weigh it well) oppoſes your part, and pleads for mine: By conſent of al Diuines ancient, &amp; moderne, (defrauding) is refraining frō matrimonical conuerſation: ſee what a word the Spirit of God hath choſen for this abſtinence: neuer but taken in ill part. But there is no fraud in conſent, as Chryſoſtom, Athanaſius, Theophilact, expound it: true; therefore Saint Paule addes (vnleſſe with conſent) that I may omit to ſay, that in ſaying

(vnleſſe with conſent) he implies, both that there may bee a defrauding without it, and with conſent a defrauding, but not vnlawfull: but ſee what hee addes (For a time,) conſent cannot make this defrauding lawfull, except it be temporary: No defrauding without conſent, no conſent for a perpetuity. How long then, and wherefore? Not for euery cauſe, not for any length of time, but onely for a while, and for deuotion (vt vacetis, &amp;c.) Not that you might pray onely (as Chryſo ſtome notes iuſtly) but that you might (giue your ſelues to praier.) In our marriage Societie (ſaith he) againſt that paradoxe of Hierome, we may pray, and woe to vs it we doe not; but we cannot (vacare orationi.) But we are bidden to pray

continually: yet not I hope, euer to faſt and pray. Marke how the Apoſtle addes (that you may giue you ſelues to faſting and praier;) It is ſolemne exerciſe, which the Apoſtle here intends, ſuch, as is ioined with faſting, and externall humiliation; wherin al earthly comforts muſt be forborne. But what if a man liſt to taske himſelfe continually, and wil be alwaies painfully deuote: may hee then neuer abſtaine? No: (Let them meete together againe) ſaith the Apoſtle, not as a toleratiō, but as a charge? But what if they both can liue ſafely thus ſeuered? This is more then they can vndertake: there is danger, ſaith our Apoſtle, in this abſtinence (leſt Satan tempt you for your incontinencie) what can be more plaine. Neither may the maried refraine this conuerſation

without cōſent: neither may they with conſent, refraine it for euer. What can you now vrge vs with, but the examples, and ſentences of ſome Ancients? Let this ſtand euicted for the true and neceſſary ſenſe of the Apoſtle, and what is this, but to lay men in the ballance with God? I ſee and confeſſe how much ſome of the Fathers admited virginitie; ſo farre, that there wated not ſome, which both deteſted mariage as vicious, and would force a ſingle life vpon marriage, as commendable: whoſe authoritie ſhould moue me, if I ſaw not ſome of them oppoſite to others, and others no leſſe to Saint Paule himſelfe. How oft doth Saint Auſtin redouble that rule, and importunately vrge it to his Ecdicia, in that ſerious Epiſtle, that without conſent the

continence of the maried, cannot bee warrantable: teaching her (from theſe words of Saint Paule which he charges her, in the contrary practiſe, not to haue read, heard, or marked) that if her huſband ſhould containe, and ſhee would not, he were bound to pay her the debt of marriage beneuolence; &amp; that God would impute it to him for continence not withſtanding. Hence is that of Chryſoſtome, 
                  
                     Homil. in 1. Cor. 7. that the wife is both the ſeruant and the Miſtreſſe of her huſband, a ſeruant to yeeld her body, a Miſtreſſe to haue power of his: who alſo in the ſame place determines it forbidden fraude, for the huſband, or wife to containe alone: according to that of the Paraphraſt Let either both containe, or neither. Hierome contrarily,

defines thus: But if one of the two (ſaith he) conſidering the rewarde of chaſtity, will containe, he ought not to aſſent to the other which containes not, &amp;c. becauſe luſt ought rather to come to continencie, then continencie decline to luſt, concluding that a brother, or ſiſter is not ſubiect in ſuch a caſe; and that God hath not called vs to vncleanneſſe, but to holines. A ſtrange gloſſe to fall from the pen of a Father: which yet I durſt not ſay, if it were more boldnes for me to diſſent from him, then for him to diſſent from all others. He that cenſures Saint Paule to argue groſly to his Galatians, may as well taxe him of an vnfit direction to his Corinthians: It ſhall be no preſumption to ſay, that in this point all his writings bewray

more zeale, then truth: whether the conſcience of his former ſlip cauſed him to abhorre that ſexe; or his admiration of virginitie tranſported him to a contempt of marriage. Antiquitie will afford you many examples of holy men voluntarily ſequeſtred from their wiues: Precepts muſt bee our guides, and not patternes. You may tell me of Sozomens Ammon, that famous Monke, who hauing perſwaded his bride the firſt day to continuance of virginitie, liued with her 18. yeares in a ſeuerall bed: and in a ſeuerall habitation, vpon the mountaine Nitria, 22. yeares, you may tell me of Ieromes Malchus, Auſtens Ecdicia, and ten thouſand others: I care not for their number, and ſuſpect their example: Doe but reconcile their

practiſe with Saint Paules rule; I ſhall both magnifie and imitate them. I profeſſe, before God and men: nothing ſhould hinder me but this law of the Apoſtle: whereto conſider, I beſeech you, what can be more oppoſite then this opinion, then this courſe of life.
               The Apoſtle ſaies, Refraine not but with conſent for a time: your words, and their practiſe ſaith, Refraine with conſent foreuer: hee ſaith (meete together againe) you ſay, neuer more: hee ſaith (meete leſt you bee tempted) you ſay, meete not though you bee tempted. I willingly grant with Athanaſius, that for ſome ſet time, eſpecially (as Anſelme interprets it) for ſome holy time, we may, and (in this latter caſe) we muſt forbeare

all matrimonical acts, &amp; thoughts: not for that they are ſinfull, but vnſeaſonable. As marriage muſt be alwaies vſed chaſtly, and moderately: ſo ſometimes it muſt be forgotten. How many are drunke with their owne vines, and ſurfet of their owne fruits? either immodeſtie, or immoderation in man or wiſe, is a dulterous. If yet I ſhall further yeeld, that they may conditionally agree, to refrain frō each other, ſo long till they bee perplexed with temptations, on either part: I ſhall goe as farre as the reach of my warrant, at leaſt perhaps beyond it: ſince the Apoſtle chargeth, Meete againe leſt you bee tempted; not, meete when you are tempted? But to ſay, abſolutely, and for euer renounce (by conſent) the conuerſation

of each, other, what temptation ſoeuer aſſault you, is directly, not beyond, but againſt Paules diuinitie, no leſſe then my aſſertion is againſt yours. The ground of all theſe errors in this head of Matrimony, is an vnworthie conceit of ſome vnchriſtian filthineſſe in the marriage bed. Euery man will not vtter, but too many holde that concluſion of Hierome: It is good for a man not to touch a women, therefore to touch her, is euill; whom I doubt not, but Saint Auſtin meant to 
                     De bono coniugij, cap. 19. oppoſe, while he writes, Bonum inquam ſunt nuptiae, &amp; contra omnes calumnias poſſunt ſanâ ratione defendi: Marriage (I ſay) is a good thing, and may by ſound proofe bee defended, againſt all ſlaunders: well may man ſay that is good, which

God ſaith, is honorable; and both good and honourable muſt that needs be, which was inſtituted by the honourable author of goodneſſe, in the ſtate of mans perfect goodneſſe: Let vs take heede of caſting ſhame vpon the ordinance of our maker. But there was no carnall knowledge in Paradiſe. But againe, in Paradiſe God ſaid, increaſe and multiply: there ſhould haue beene, if there were not. Thoſe that were naked without ſhame ſhould haue beene conioined without ſhame, becauſe without ſinne. Meates and drinks, and acts of marriage (ſaith Auſtin) (for theſe hee compares 
                     De bono. coniug. c. 9. &amp;c. 16. both in lawfulnes, and neceſsitie) are, as they are vſed, either lawful, veniall, or damnable. Meates are for the preſeruation of man: marriage

acts for the preſeruation of mankind: neither of them are without ſome carnall delight: which yet, if by the bridle of temperance it bee held to the proper, and natural vſe, cannot be termed luſt. There is no ordinance of God, which either is of more excellent vſe, or hath ſuffered more abuſe in all times: the fault is in men, not in marriage: Let them rectifie themſelues, their bed ſhal bee bleſſed. Here need no ſeparation from each other, but rather a ſeparation of brutiſhnes, &amp; cloſe corruption from the ſoule; which whoſoeuer hath learned to remoue, ſhall finde the crowne of matrimonicall chaſtitie, no leſſe glorious, then that of ſingle continence.

                  I Am more glad to heare from you, then ſorry to heare of your diſcontentment: whereof, as the cauſe is from your ſelfe, ſo muſt the remedy. Wee Schollers

are the apteſt of all others to make our ſelues miſerable: you might be your owne beſt counſellor were you but indifferent to your ſelfe: It I could but cure your preiudice, your thoughts would heale you: And indeed the ſame, hand that wounded you, were fitteſt for this ſeruice. I need not tell you, that your calling is honourable; If you did not thinke ſo, you had not complained. It is your vnworthineſſe, that troubles you: Let mee boldly tell you, I know you in this caſe better then your ſelfe; you are neuer the more vnſufficient, becauſe you thinke ſo: If wee will bee rigorous, Paules queſtion (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) will appoſe vs all: but according to the gracious indulgence of him that calls things which are not as

if they were, wee are that wee are, yea, that we ought; and muſt be thankefull for our any thing. There are none more fearefull then the able, none more bold then the vnworthy: How many haue you ſeene and heard, of weaker graces (your owne heart ſhall bee the iudge) which haue ſate without paleneſſe, or trembling, in that holy chaire, and ſpoken as if the wordes had beene their owne: ſatisfying themſelues, if not the hearers? And doe you (whoſe gifts many haue enuied) ſtand quaking vpon the loweſt ſtaire? Hath God giuen you that vnuſuall varietie of tongues, skill of Artes, a ſtile worth emulation, and (which is worth all) a faithfull and honeſt heart; and doe you now ſhrinke backe, and ſay, ſend

by him by whom thou ſhouldſt ſend? Giue God but what you haue; he expects no more: This is enough to honour him, and crowne you. Take heede while you complaine of want, leaſt pride ſhroude it ſelfe vnder the skirts of modeſtie; How many are thankfull for leſſe? You haue more then the moſt; yet this contents you not; it is nothing vnleſſe you may equall the beſt, if not exceede; yea I feare how this might ſatisfie you, vnleſſe you may thinke your ſelfe ſuch as you would bee: What is this but to grudge at the beſtower of graces? I tell you without flatterie, God hath great gaines by fewer talents: ſet your heart to imploie theſe, and your aduantage ſhall bee more then your maſters. Neither

do now repent you of the vnaduiſedneſſe of your entrance; God called you to it vpon an eternall deliberation, and meant to make vſe of your ſuddennes, as a meanes to fetch you into his worke, whom more leaſure would haue found refractarie: Full little did the one Saul thinke of a kingdom, when he went to ſeeke his Fathers ſtraies in the land of Shaliſhah; or the other Saul of an Apoſtleſhip, when hee went with his commiſsion to Damaſcus: God thought of both; &amp; effected what they meant not; Thus hath hee done to you; Acknowledge this hand, and follow it. Hee found and gaue both facultie &amp; opportunitie to enter; finde you but a will to proceede, I dare promiſe you aboundance of comfort.

How many of the Ancients, after a forceable Ordination, became not profitable onely, but famous in the Church? But, as if you ſought ſhifts to diſcourage your ſelfe, when you ſee you cannot maintaine this hold of inſufficiencie, you flie to alienation of affection; In the truth wherof, none can contoll you but your owne heart; in the iuſtice of it, we both may, and muſt. This plea is not for Chriſtians; we muſt affect what we ought, in ſpight of our ſelues; wherefore ſerues religion if not to make vs Lords of our owne affections? If wee muſt bee ruled by our ſlaues, what good ſhould we do? Can you more diſlike your ſtation, then wee all naturally diſtaſt goodneſſe? Shall we neglect the purſuit of vertue, becauſe

it pleaſes not, or rather diſpleaſe, and neglect our ſelues, till it may pleaſe vs? Let mee not aske whether your affections be eſtranged, but wherefore? Diuinitie is a miſtreſſe worthie your ſeruice: All other Artes are but drudges to her, alone: Fooles may contemne her who cannot iudge of true intellectual beautie; but if they had our eies; they could not but bee rauiſhed with admiration. You haue learned (I hope) to contemn their contempt, and ſo pitty their iniurious ignorance. She hath choſen you as a worthy client, yea a Fauorite, and hath honored you with her commaunds, and her acceptations; who but you would pleade ſtrangeneſſe of affection? How many thouſand ſue to her; and cannot be look't vpon? you

are happy in her fauours, and yet complaine: Yea ſo far, as that you haue not ſtucke to thinke of a change: No word could haue falne from you more vnwelcome. This is Satans policie to make vs out of loue with our callings, that our labours may be vnprofitable, and our ſtandings tedious. Hee knows that all changes are fruitleſſe, and that whiles we affect to be other, we muſt needs be weary of what we are: That there is no ſucceſſe in any indeauor without pleaſure; that there can bee no pleaſure where the mind longs after alterations. If you eſpie not this craft of the common enemy, you are not acquainted with your ſelfe: Vnder what forme ſoeuer it come, repell it: and abhorre the firſt motion of it, as you loue your

peace, as you hope for your reward. It is the miſery of the moſt men, that they cannot ſee when they are happie; and whiles they ſee but the out-ſide of others conditions, preferre that which their experience teaches them afterwardes to condemne, not without loſſe and teares. Farre be this vnſtableneſſe from you, which haue been ſo long taught of God. All vocations haue their inconueniences, which if they cannot be auoided, muſt be digeſted. The more difficulties, the greater glory: Stand faſt therefore, and reſolue that this calling is the beſt, both in it ſelfe, and for you: and know that it cannot ſtand with your Chriſtian courage to run away from theſe incident euills, but to encounter them. Your hand is at the plough;

if you meete with ſome tough clods, that will not eaſily yeeld to the ſhare, lay on more ſtrength rather; ſeeke not remedie in your feet by flight, but in your hands, by a conſtant indeauor. Away with this weake timorouſneſſe, and wrongful humilitie: Be chearfull and couragious in this great worke of God; the end ſhall be glorious your ſelfe happy, and many in you.

               EPIST. I. To my LORD DENNY.
               
                  ¶ A particular account how our dayes are, or ſhould be ſpent, both common and holy.
                  
               
               
                  EVery day is a little life, and our whole life is but a day repeated: whence it is, that old Iacob numbers his life by dayes, and Moſes deſires to be taught

this point of holy Arithmeticke, to number not his yeares, but his dayes: Thoſe therefore that dare looſe a day, are daungerouſly prodigall; thoſe that dare miſ-ſpend it, deſperate. We can beſt teach others by our ſelues: Let mee tell your Lordſhip, how I would paſſe my dayes, whether common or Sacred; that you (or whoſoeuer others, ouer-hearing me) may eyther approoue my thriftineſſe, or correct my errors: To whom is the account of my houres either more due, or more knowne? All dayes are his, who gaue time a beginning, and continuance; yet ſome he hath made ours, not to command, but to vſe. In none may we forget him, in ſome we muſt forget all, beſides him. Firſt therefore, I deſire to awake at thoſe houres, not when I will, but when I muſt: pleaſure is not a fit rule for reſt,

but health: neyther doe I conſult ſo much with the Sunne, as mine owne neceſsity, whither of body, or, in that, of the minde. If this vaſſall could welſerue mee waking, it ſhould neuer ſleepe: but now, it muſt bee pleaſed, that it may bee ſeruiceable. Now, when ſleepe is rather driuen away, then leaues mee; I would euer awake with God; my firſt thoughts are for him, who hath made the night for reſt, and the day for trauell: and as he giues, ſo bleſſes both. If my heart be earely ſeaſoned with his preſence, it will ſauour of him all day after. While my body is dreſsing, not with an effeminate curioſity, nor yet with rude neglect; my minde addreſſes itſelfe to her inſuing Task; bethinking what is to be done, and in what order; and marſhalling (as it may) my houres with my work: That done after ſome

whiles Meditation, I walke vp to my Maiſters &amp; companions, my bookes; and ſitting down amongſt them, with the beſt contentment, I dare not reach forth my hand to ſalute any of them, till I haue firſt looked vp to Heauen, and craued fauour of him to whom all my Studies are duly referred: without whome, I can neither profit, nor labour. After this, out of no ouer-great variety, J call forth thoſe, which may beſt fit my occaſions; wherein, I am not too ſcrupulous of age: Somtimes I put my ſelfe to Schoole, to one of thoſe Auncients, whom the Church hath honoured with the name of Fathers; whoſe Volumes, I confeſſe, not to open, without a ſecret reuerence of their holineſſe, and grauitie: Sometimes, to thoſe later Doctours, which want nothing but age to make them claſsicall: Alwayes to GODS

Booke. That day is loſt, wherof ſome houres are not improued in thoſe Diuine Monuments: Others I turn ouer out of choyſe, theſe out of duty. Ere I can haue ſat vnto wearineſſe, my family, hauing now ouercome all houſehold-diſtractions, inuites mee to our common deuotions; not without ſome ſhort preparation. Theſe hartily performed, ſend mee vp, with a more ſtrong and chearefull appetite to my former worke, which I find made eaſie to me by intermiſsion, and variety: Now therefore, can I deceiue the houres with change of pleaſures, that is, of labours. One while mine eyes are buſied, another while my hand, &amp; ſometimes my minde takes the burden from them both: Wherein, I would imitate the skilfulleſt Cookes, which make the beſt diſhes with manifold mixtures: one houre is ſpent in

Textuall Diuinity, another in Controuerſy; hiſtories relieue them both. Now, when the minde is weary of others labors, it begins to vndertake hir owne; ſometimes it meditates, and windes vp for future vſe; ſometimes it layes foorth her conceits into preſent diſcourſe; ſometimes for it ſelfe, ofter, for others. Neither know I whether it workes or playes in theſe thoughts: I am ſure no ſport hath more pleaſure, no work more vſe: Only the decay of a weake body, makes me thinke theſe delights inſenſibly laborious. Thus could I all day, (as Ringers vſe) make my ſelfe Muſicke with chaunges, and complain ſooner of the day for ſhortneſſe, then of the buſineſſe for toyle; were it not that this faint moniter interrupts me ſtil in the midſt of my buſie pleaſures, and inforces me both to reſpite &amp; repaſt I muſt yeeld to both;

my body and mind are ioyned together in theſe vnequal couples, the better muſt follow the weaker. Before my meales therefore, and after, I let my ſelfe looſe from all thoughts, and now, would forget that I euer ſtudyed: A full minde takes away the bodies appetite, no leſſe then a full body makes a dull and vnweildy minde: Company, diſcourſe, recreations, are now ſeaſonable and welcome; Theſe prepare me for a diet, not gluttonous, but medicinall; The Palate may not be pleaſed, but the ſtomack; nor that for it owne ſake: Neither woulde I thinke any of theſe comforts woorth reſpect in themſelues, but in their vſe, in their end; ſo farre, as they may inable me to better things, If I ſee any diſh to tempt my Palate, J feare a Serpent in that Apple, and would pleaſe my ſelfe in a wilfull denyall: I riſe capable

of more, not deſirous not now immediately from my Trencher, to my Booke; but after ſome intermiſsion. Moderate ſpeede is a ſure helpe to all proceedings, where thoſe things which are proſecuted with violence of indeuour, or deſire, either ſucceed not, or continue not.
               After my latter meale, my thoughts are ſlight, onely my memorie may be charged with her Taske, of recalling what was committed to her cuſtodie in the day, and my heart is buſie in examining mine hands and mouth, &amp; all other ſences of that dayes behauiour. And now the Euening is come, no Tradeſ-man doth more carefully take in his Wares, cleare his Shoppeboord, and ſhut his Windowes, then J would ſhut vp my thoughts, &amp; clear my minde. That Student ſhall liue miſerably, which like a Camell lies down

vnder his burden. All this done, calling together my familie, we end the day with God. Thus do wee rather driue away the time before vs, then follow it. I graunt, neither is my practiſe worthy to be exemplarie, neither are our callings proportionable. The lyues of a Nobleman, of a Courtier, of a Scholler, of a Cittizen, of a Countreyman, differ no leſſe then their diſpoſitions: yet muſt all conſpire in honeſt labour. Sweat is the deſtiny of all trades, whether of the browes, or of the minde. God neuer allowed anie man to do nothing. How miſerable is the condition of thoſe men, which ſpend the time as if it were giuen thē, and not lent: as if houres were waſte Creatures, and ſuch as ſhould neuer be accounted for; as if GOD would take this for a good Bil of reckoning; Item, ſpent vpon my pleaſures, fortie

yeares. Theſe men ſhal once finde, that no bloud can priuiledge idlenes; and that nothing is more precious to God, then, that which they deſire to caſt away, Tyme. Such are my common daies: but Gods day cals for another reſpect. The ſame Sunne ariſes on this day, and enlightens it; yet becauſe that Sun of righteouſneſſe aroſe once vpon it, &amp; gaue a new life vnto the world in it, &amp; drew the ſtrength of Gods moral precept vnto it, therfore iuſtly do we ſing with the pſalmiſt; This is the day which the Lorde hath made. Now, I forget the world, and in a ſort, my ſelfe; and deale with my wonted thoughts, as great men vſe, who, at ſometimes of their priuacie, forbid the acceſſe of all ſuters. Prayer, Meditation, reading, hearing, preaching, ſinging, good conference, are the buſineſſes of this day; which I dare not beſtow

on anie worke, or pleaſure, but heauenly. J hate ſuperſtition on the one ſide, and looſeneſſe on the other; but I finde it harde to offend in too much deuotion, eaſie in profaneneſſe. The whole Week is ſanctified by this day, and according to my care of this, is my bleſsing on the reſt. I ſhow your Lordſhip, what I would do, and what I ought: I commit my deſires to the imitation of the weake, my actions to the cenſures of the Wiſe and Holye; my weakeneſſes to the pardon and redreſſe of my mercifull God.
            
            
               
               
               EPIST. II. To Mr. 
                  T. S. Dedicated to Sir Fulke Greuill.
               
               
                  ¶ Diſcourſing how wee may vſe the Worlde without daunger.
                  
               
               
                  HOwe to liue out of the daunger of the Worlde is both a great &amp; good care, and that which troubles too fewe. Some, that the World may not hurt

them, run frō it; &amp; baniſh themſelues to the toppes of ſolitary Mountaines: changing the Cities, for Deſerts, houſes, for Gaues, and the ſocietie of men for beaſts; and leaſt their enimy might inſinuate himſelfe into their ſecrecy, haue abridged themſelues of dyet, cloathing, lodging, harbour, fit for reaſonable creatures; ſeeming to haue left off themſelues, no leſſe then companions.
               As if the Worlde were not euery where; as if wee could hide our ſelues from the Diuel; as if ſolitarineſſe were priuiledged from Temptations; as if wee did not more violently affect reſtrained delights; as if theſe Hieromes did not finde Rome in their hart, when they had nothing but rockes &amp; trees in their eye. Hence theſe places of retyredneſſe, founded at firſt vppon neceſsity mixt with deuotion, haue proued

infamouſly vnclean; Cels of luſt, not of piety. This courſe is prepoſterous; If I were worthy to teach you a better way, learne to bee an Hermit at home: Begin with your owne heart, eſtraunge and weane it from the loue, not from the vſe of the world: Chriſtianity hath taught vs nothing, if wee haue not learned this diſtinction; It is a great weakeneſſe not to ſee, but wee muſt be inamored: Elisha, ſaw the ſecret ſtate of the Syrian court, yet as an enemy: The bleſſed Angelles ſee our earthly affayres, but as ſtrangers: Moſes his body was in the Court of Pharaoh, amongeſt the delicate Egiptians, his heart was ſuffering with the afflicted Iſraelites. Lot tooke part of the fayre Medowes of Sodom, not of theyr ſinnes. Our bleſſed Sauiour ſawe the glory of al Kingdomes, &amp; contemned them: and cannot the world look vpon

vs Chriſtians, but wee are be witched? We ſee the Sun daily, &amp; warme vs at his beames, yet make not an Idol of it; doth any man hide his face, leaſt he ſhould adore it? All our ſafetie or danger therefore, is from within. In vaine is the body an Anachoret, if the heart be a Ruffian: And if that bee retyred in affections, the body is but a Cipher: Lo then the eyes will looke careleſſely and ſtrangely in what they ſee, and the tongue will ſometimes anſwere to that was not asked. We eate and recreate, becauſe wee muſt, not becauſe we would: and when wee are pleaſed, wee are ſuſpicious: Lawfull delights, we neyther refuſe, nor dote vpon, and all contentments goe and come like ſtrangers. That all this may be done, take vp your hart with better thoughts; be ſure it will not be empty, if Heauen haue fore-ſtalled all the

roomes, the Worlde is diſappointed, and eyther dares not offer, or is repulſed. Fixe your ſelfe vpon the glory of that eternity, which abides you after this ſhort pilgrimage. You cannot but contemne what you find in compariſon of what you expect. Leaue not til you attaine to this, that you are willing to liue, becauſe ye cannot as yet be diſſolued: Be but one halfe vppon earth, let your better part conuerſe aboue whence it is, and enioy that whereto it was ordained. Thinke how little the World can doe for you and what it doth, how deceitfully: vvhat ſtings there are with this Hony, vvhat farewell ſucceeds this Welcome.
               When this Iael brings you Milk in the one hand, know ſhee hath a nayle in the other. Aske your heart what it is the better, what the merrier, for all thoſe pleaſures where with it hath befriended

you: let your own trial teach you contempt; Thinke how ſincere, how glorious thoſe ioyes are, which abide you elſevvhere, and a thouſand times more certaine (though future) then the preſent.
               And let not theſe thoughts be flying, but fixed: Jn vaine do we meditate, if were ſolue not: when your hart is once thus ſetled, it ſhall commaund all things to aduantage. The World ſhall not betray, but ſerue it; and that ſhall be fulfilled which God promiſes by his Salomon; VVhen the wayes of a man pleaſe the Lord, he wil make his enimies alſo at peace with him.
               
               Sir, this aduice my pouerty affoorded long ſince to a weake friend; I Write it not to you, any otherwiſe, then as Schollers are woont to ſay their part to their Maiſters. The world hath long and iuſtly both noted and

honoured you for eminence in wiſedome and learning, and I aboue the moſt; I am ready with the awe of a Learner, to embrace all precepts from you: you ſhall expect nothing from me, but Teſtimonies of reſpect and thankefulneſſe.

                  ¶ Of the remedies of ſinne, and motiues to auoyde it.
                  
               
               
                  THere is none, either more common, or more trobleſom gueſt, then Sin. Troubleſome, both in the ſolicitation of it, and in the remorſe. Before the act, it wearies vs with a wicked importunity;

after the act it torments vs with feares, and the painful gnawings of an accuſing Conſcience: Neyther is it more irkeſome to men, then odious to God; who indeed neuer hated any thing but it; and for it any thing. How happy were we, if we could be rid of it? This muſt be our deſire, but cannot be our hope; ſo long as wee carry this bodie of ſinne and death about vs: yet (which is our comfort) it ſhall not carry vs, though wee carry it: It will dwell with vs, but with no commaund; yea, with no peace: Wee grudge to giue it houſe-roome, but wee hate to giue it ſeruice. This our Hagar wil abide many ſtrokes, ere ſhe be turned out of doores; ſhe ſhall go at laſt, and the ſeede of promiſe ſhall inherit alone. There is no vnquyetneſſe good, but this: and in this caſe, quietneſſe cannot ſtand with ſafetie:

neither did euer warre more truly beget peace, then in this ſtrife of the ſoule.
               Reſiſtance is the way to victory, and that, to an eternall peace and happyneſſe. It is a bleſſed care then, how to reſiſt: ſinne, how to auoyd it: and ſuch as I am glad to teach and learne. As there are two grounds of all ſin, ſo of the auoydance of Sinne; Loue, and Feare: Theſe if they be placed amiſſe, cauſe vs to offend: if aright, are the remedies of euill: The Loue muſt be of God; Feare, of Iudgement.
               As he loues much, to whom much is forgiuen, ſo hee that loues much, will not dare to dooe that which may neede forgiueneſſe. The heart that hath felt the ſweetneſſe of Gods mercies, will not abide the bitter relliſh of ſinne: This is both a ſtronger motiue then Fear, and more Noble;

None but a good heart is capable of this grace: which who ſo hath receyued, thus powerfully repelles tentations.
               Haue I found my God ſo gracious to me that hee hath denyed mee nothing, eyther in earth or heauen: and ſhal not J ſo much as deny my owne will for his ſake? Hath my deare Sauiour bought my ſoul at ſuch a price, and ſhall he not haue it? Was hee crucified for my ſinnes, and ſhall I by my ſinnes crucifie him againe? Am J his in ſo many bonds, and ſhall J ſerue the Diuel? O God! is this the fruit of thy beneficence to me, that J ſhould wilfully diſhonor thee? Was thy blood ſo little worth, that I ſhould treade it vnder my feete? Dooth this become him that ſhall be once glorious vvith thee? Haſt thou prepared heauen for me, and do I thus prepare my ſelfe for

heauen? Shall I thus recompence thy loue, in dooing that which thou hateſt? Satan hath no Dart (I ſpeak confidently) that can pierce this Shielde: Chriſtians are indeed to oft ſurprized, ere they can holde it out: there is no ſmall pollicy in the ſuddaineneſſe of temptation: but if they haue once ſetled it before their breſt, they are ſafe, and their enemy hopeleſſe. Vnder this head therefore, there is ſure remedie againſt ſinne, by looking vpwardes, backwards, into our ſelues, forwards. Vpwards, at the glorious Maieſty, and infinite goodneſſe of that God whom our ſinne would offend, and in whoſe face we ſin: whoſe mercies, &amp; whoſe holyneſſe is ſuch, that if there were no hel, we would not offend. Backwards, at the manifold fauours, whereby we are obliged to obedience. Into our ſelues, at that honourable vocation,

wherewith he hath graced vs, that holy profeſsion we haue made of his calling, and grace, that ſolemne vowe &amp; Couenant, whereby we haue confirmed our profeſsion; the gracious beginnings of that ſpirit in vs, which is grieued by our ſinnes, yea quenched. Forwards, at the ioy which will follow vpon our forbearance, that peace of conſcience, that happy expectation of glory, compared with the momentary and vnpleaſing delight of a preſent ſinne; All theſe, out of Loue; Fear is a retentiue, as neceſſary, not ſo ingenuous. Jt is better to be wonne, then to be frighted from ſinne: to be allured, then drawne. Both are little inough in our proneſſe to euil: Euil, is the onely obiect of feare. Heerein therefore, wee muſt terrifie our ſtubburnneſſe, with both euils; Of loſſe, and of ſence: that if it be poſsible, the

honor of the euent may counteruaile the pleaſure of the tentation: Of loſſe, remembering that now we are about to looſe a God; to caſt away all the comforts &amp; hopes of ano her world; to rob our ſelues of all thoſe ſweete mercies we inioyed; to thruſt his ſpirit out of doores (which cannot abide to dwell within the noyſom ſtench of ſinne) to ſhut the doores of heauen againſt our ſelues. Of ſence; That thus we giue ſatan a right in vs, power ouer vs, aduantage againſt vs. That wee make God to frowne vpon vs in heauen; That we arme all his good creatures againſt vs on earth; That we do as it were take Gods hand in ours, &amp; ſcourge our ſelues with all Temporall plagues; and force his curſes vpon vs, and ours: That we wound our owne conſciences with ſins, that they may wound vs with euerlaſting torments;

That we do both make an hell in our breaſts before hande, and open the gates of that bottomleſſe pit, to rereceiue vs afterwards: That wee doe now caſt Brimſtone into the Fire; and leaſt we ſhould faile of tortures, make our ſelues our owne fiends: Theſe, &amp; vvhat euer other terrors of this kinde, muſt be layde to the ſoule: vvhich, if they be throughly vrged to an heart, not altogether incredulous, Wel may a man aske himſelfe, how he dare ſin? But if neyther this Sunne of mercies, nor the tempeſtuous Winds of iudgement can make him caſt off Peters cloake of vvickedneſſe; hee muſt bee clad vvith confuſion, as vvith a cloak, according to the Pſalmist.
               
               I tremble to thinke hovv many liue, as if they vvere neyther beholden to God, nor affrayde of him; neyther in his debt, nor daunger: As if their heauen

and hell vvere both vpon earth; Sinning not onely vvithout ſhame, but not vvithout mallice; It is theyr leaſt ill to do euill; Behold they ſpeake for it, ioy in it, boaſt of it, inforce to it; as if they vvould ſend challenges into heauen, &amp; make loue to deſtruction: Their leudneſſe cals for our ſorrowe, and zealous obedience; that our God may haue as true Seruants, as enimies: And as vvee ſee naturall qualities, increaſed vvith the reſiſtaunce of theyr contraries: ſo muſt our grace vvith others ſinnes: We ſhal redeeme ſomvvhat of Gods diſhonour by ſinne, if vve ſhal thence grovv holye.

                  ¶ Diſcourſing, how farre, and wherein Popery deſtroyeth the foundation.
                  
               
               
                  THe meane in all thinges is not more ſafe then hard: whether to finde or keep: &amp; as in al other morality, it lyeth in a narrow roome; ſo moſt in the matter

of our cenſures, eſpecially concerning Religion: wherein we are wont to be eyther careleſſe, or too peremptory: How farre, and wherein Popery raceth the foundation, is worth our inquiry: I neede not ſtay vpon wordes. By foundation, we mean the neceſſary groundes of Chriſtian faith. This foundation Papiſtry defaces, by laying a new; by caſting downe the old. In theſe caſes, addition deſtroyes: he that obtrudes a new worde, no leſſe ouerthrowes the Scripture, then hee that den̄yes the olde, yea this, very obtruſion denies: he that ſets vp a newe Chriſt, reiects Chriſt: Two foundations cannot ſtand at once: The Arke and Dagon: Now Papiſtry layes a double how foundation: The one, a new rule of faith, that is, a new word: The other, a new Author, or guide of Faith, that is, a newe head beſides

Chriſt God neuer layde other foundation, then in the Prophets and Apoſtles: vpon their Diuine writing, he meant to build his Church; which hee therefore inſpired, that they might be like (himſelfe) perfect and eternall: Popery buildes vppon an vn-written word, the voyce of old (but doubtful) Traditions. The voyce of the preſent Church, that is, as they interpret it, theyrs; with no leſſe confidence and preſumption of certainety, then any thing euer Written by the finger of God; If this be not a new foundation, the old was none. God neuer taught this holy Spouſe to knowe any other husband, thē Chriſt; to acknowledge any other head; to followe any other Shepheard, to obey any other King: he alone may be inioyed without iealouſie, ſubmitted to without danger, without errour beleeued, ſerued without

ſcruple: Popery offers to impoſe on Gods Church a King, ſhepheard, head, husband, beſides her owne: A man; a man of ſin. He muſt know all things, can erre in nothing: direct, inform, animate, cōmand, both in earth and Purgatory, expounde Scriptures, cannonize Saints, forgiue Sins: create new Articles of Faith; and in all theſe, is abſolute and infallible as his Maker; who ſees not, that if to attribute, theſe things to the ſon of God, bee to make him the foundation of the Church; Then to aſcribe them to another, is to contradict him that ſayde, Other foundation can no man lay, then that which is layde, which is Ieſus Christ. To lay a new foundation, doth neceſſarily ſubuert the old: yet ſee this further actually done in particulars: wherein yet this diſtinction may cleare the way: The foundation is ouerthrowne two

wayes; either in flat tearmes, when a mayne principle of faith is abſolutely denyed: as the deity and conſubſtantiality of the ſonne by Arrius, the Trinity of perſons by Sabellius and Seruetus, the reſurrection of the bodye by Himeneus and Philetus, the laſt Iudgement by Saint Peters Mockers; Or ſecondly, by conſequent; when anie opinion is maintained, which by iuſt ſequell ouer turneth the trueth of that principle, which the defendant profeſſes to holde; yet ſo, as hee will not graunt the neceſsity of that deduction▪ ſo the Ancient M
                        •
                     n
                        •
                     i, of whom Ierom ſpeaketh, while they vrged Circumciſion, by conſequent according to Paules rule, reiected Chriſt: ſo the Pelagians, while they defended a full perfection of our righteouſhes in our ſelues, ouerthrew Chriſtes iuſtification: and in effect ſayde, I beleeue in
                  
                  Chriſt, and in myſelfe: ſo ſome Vbiauitaries, while they hold the poſsibility of the conuerſion, and ſaluation of reprobates, ouerthrow the Doctrine of Gods eternall decree, and immutability. Popery comes in this latter rank; and may iuſtly be tearmed hereſie, by direct conſequent: Though not in their graunt, yet in neceſſarie proofe and inference. Thus it ouerthrowes the truth of Chriſts humanity, while it holds his whole humaine body locally circumſcribed in heauen, &amp; at once (the ſame inſtant) wholy preſent in ten thouſand places on earth, without circumſcription: That whole Chriſt is in the formes of bread, with all his dimenſions, euery part hauing his own place and figure: and yet ſo, as that he is wholly in euery part of the breade. Our iuſtification, while it aſcribes it to our owne workes: The Al-ſufficiency

of Chriſts owne Sacrifice, whiles they reiterate it daily by the handes of a Prieſt. Of his ſatisfaction, while they holde a payment of our vtmoſt farthings, in a deuiſed Purgatory. Of his mediation, while they implore others to ayde them, not only by their interceſsion, but their merites; ſuing not onely for their Prayes, but their gifts: The value of the Scriptures, whiles they hold them inſufficient, obſcure, in points eſſentiall to ſaluation, &amp; bind them to an vncertaine dependance vpon the Church. Beſides hundreds of this kind, there are hereſies in actions, contrary to thoſe fundamentall practiſes which God requires of his: As prohibitions of Scriptures to the Laity: Preſcriptions of deuotion in vnknowne tongues: Tying, the effect of Sacraments and Prayers to the externall worke: Adoration of Angels,

Saints, Bread, Reliques, Croſſes, Jmages: All which, are as ſo many reall vnderminings of the ſacred foundation, which is no leſſe actiue, then vocall. By this, the ſimpleſt may ſee, what we muſt holde of Papiſts; neyther as no Heretiques, nor yet ſo palpable as the worſt: If any man aske for theyr conuiction. In the ſimpler ſort, I grant this excuſe fayre and tollerable: Poore ſoules, they cannot bee any otherwiſe informed, much leſſe perſwaded: Whiles in trueth of heart, they hold the maine principles which they know, doubtleſſe, the mercie of God may paſſe ouer their ignorant weakeneſſe, in what they cannot know. For the other, I feare not to ſay, that many of their errours are wilfull. The light of truth hath ſhined out of heauen to them, and they loue darkeneſſe more then light. Jn this ſtate of the Church:

hee ſhall ſpeake and hope idly, that ſhall call for a publique and vniuerſall euiction: How can that be, when they pretend to bee Iudges in their owne cauſe? Vnleſſe they wil not be aduerſaries to themſelues, or iudge of vs, this courſe is but impoſsible: As the Diuell, ſo Antichriſt, will not yeelde: both ſhall bee ſubdued; neyther will treat of peace: what remains, but that the Lorde ſhall conſume that wicked man (which is now clearely reuealed) with the breath of his mouth, &amp; aboliſh him with the brightnes of his cō
                  ming. Euen ſo, Lord Ieſus come quickly. This briefly is my conceit of Popery, which I willingly refer to your clear &amp; deepe iudgement, being not more deſirous to teach the ignoraunt▪ what I knowe, then to learne of you what I ſhould teach, &amp; know not. The Lord direct all our thoughts to his glory, &amp; the behoofe of his Church.
            
            
               
               
               EPIST. V. Written long ſince to Mr.

                  ¶ Diſſwading from ſeperation: &amp; ſhortly oppugning the grounds of that errour.
                  
               
               
                  IN my former Epiſtle (I confeſſe) J touched the late ſeperation vvith a light hand: onely ſetting downe the iniurie of it (at the beſt) not diſcuſsing the groundes in common; now your daunger drawes

me on to this diſcourſe: it is not much leſſe thanke-woorthy, to preuent a diſeaſe, then to cure it: you confeſſe that you doubt; I miſlike it not, doubting is not more the way to errour, then to ſatisfaction; lay downe firſt, all pride and preiudice, and I cannot fear you: I neuer yet knew any man of this way, which hath not bewraide himſelfe far gone with ouer-weening: and therefore it hath beene iuſt with God, to puniſh their ſelfe loue with error: an humble ſpirit is a fit ſubiect for trueth: prepare you your heart, and let mee then anſwere, or rather God for mee; you doubt whether the notorious ſin of one vnreformed, vncenſured, defile not the whole Congregation; ſo as we may not without ſinne communicate therewith: &amp; why not the whole Church? wo were vs, if we ſhould thus liue in the daunger of all men: haue

we not ſins enow of our own, but we muſt borrow of others? Each man ſhal beare his own burden: is ours ſo light, that we cal for more waight, &amp; vndertake what God neuer impoſed? It was enough for him that is God &amp; man to bear others iniquities; it is no taske for vs, which ſhrink vnder the leaſt of our owne: But it is made ours, you ſay (thogh anothers) by our toleration &amp; conniuence: indeede, if we conſent to them; encourage them, imitate or accompany them in the ſame exceſſe of ryot; yet more, the publicke perſon, that forbeares a knowne ſin, ſinneth; but if each mans known ſinne be euery mans, what difference is betwixt the roote and the braunches? Adams ſinne ſpread it ſelfe to vs, becauſe wee were in him, ſtood or fell in him; our caſe is not ſuch. Do but ſee how God ſcorneth that vniuſt Prouerbe of the

                  Iewes, That the fathers haue eaten ſower Grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge? How much leſſe are ſtraungers? Js any bond ſo neere as this of blood? Shall not the childe ſmart for the Parent; and ſhall wee (euen ſpiritually) for others? You obiect Achans ſtealth, &amp; Iſraels puniſhment: an vnlike caſe, &amp; extraordinary: for ſee how direct Gods charge is. Be ye ware of the execrable thing leaſt ye make your ſelues execrable, and in taking of the execrable thing, make alſo the hoast of Iſraell execrable and trouble it. Now euery man is made a party, by a peculiar iniunction, and not onely all Iſraell is as one man: but euery Iſraelite is a publicke perſon in this act; you cannot ſhewe the like in euery one, no, not in any: it was a lawe for the preſent, not intended for perpetuity: you may as well challenge the Trumpets of Rammeshornes,

and ſeauen dayes walke vnto euery ſiedge. Looke elſe, where the Church of Thyatira ſuffers the Woman Iezabel to teach and deceyue. A great ſinne, Yet to you (ſaith the ſpirit) the reſt of Thyatira, as many as haue not this learning: I will put vpon you none other burden, but that which you haue, holde faſt; Hee ſaith not, Leaue your Church, but Hold faſt your owne. Look into the practiſe of the Prophets, ranſacke their burdens, and ſee if you find this there; yea, beholde our beſt patterne, the ſonne of God. The Iewish Rulers in Chriſt time were notoriouſly couetous, proud, oppreſsing, cruel, ſuperſtitious, our Sauiour feared not polluting, in ioyning with them; and was ſo far frō ſeperating himſelfe, that he called &amp; ſent others to them. But, a little Leauen Leauens the whole lumpe: it is true, by the infection of it;

ſinne, where it is vnpunniſhed, ſpreadeth; it ſo wreth al thoſe whoſe hands are in it, not others. If we diſlike it, deteſt, reſiſt, reproue, and mourn for it; we cannot be tainted: the Corinthian loue-feaſts had groſſe and ſinfull diſorder: yet you heare not Paul ſay, Abſtaine from the Sacrament till-theſe bee reformed; Rather he enioynes the act, and controules the abuſe: GOD hath bidden you heare and receiue: ſhew me, where he hath ſayd, except others be ſinfull. Their vncleanneſſe can no more defile you, then your holineſſe can excuſe them. But while J communicate (you ſay) I conſent; God forbid. It is ſinne not to caſt out the deſeruing; but not yours: who made you a Ruler &amp; a Iudge? The vnclean muſt be ſeperated, not by the people: I Would you haue no diſtinction betwixt priuate and publicke perſons?

What ſtrange confuſion is this? And what other then the olde note of Corah and his company, Ye take too much vpon you, ſeeing all the Congregation is holy, euery one of them, and the Lord is among them: wherfore, then lift you vp your ſelues aboue the congregation of the Lorde? What is (if this bee not) to make a monſter of Chriſts body: hee is the heade, his Church the body, conſiſting of diuers limbes? All haue their ſeuerall faculties and imployments; not euery one, al; who would immagine any man ſo abſurd, as to ſay, that this body ſhold be al toong, or al hands; euery man a Teacher, euery man a Ruler? As if Chriſt had ſayde to euery man, Goe teach, and whoſe ſinnes ye remit: Howe Senceleſſe are theſe two extreames? Of the Papiſts, that one man hath the Keyes: Of the Browniſts, that euerie

man hath them. But theſe priuiledges and charges are giuen to the Church▪ True; to be executed by hir Gouernours, the faculty of ſpeech is giuen to the whole man, but the vſe of it to the proper Inſtrument. Man ſpeaketh; but by his toong; if a voice ſhould be heard from his hand, eare, foote, it were vnnaturall. Now if the tongue ſpeak not when it ought, ſhall we be ſo fooliſh as to blame the hand? But you ſay; If the tongue ſpeake not, or ſpeak ill, the whole man ſmarteth; the man ſinneth: I graunt it, but you ſhall ſet the naturall body on too hard a racke, if you ſtraine it in all thinges, to the likeneſſe of the ſpirituall, or ciuill. The mēbers of that being quickned by the ſame ſoule, haue charge of each other, and therefore either ſtand or fall together: It is not ſo in theſe. If then notwithſtanding vnpunniſhed

ſinnes wee may ioyne with the true Church: Whether is ours ſuch? You doubt, and your ſolicitors deny: ſurely if wee haue many enormities, yet none worſe then raſh and cruel iudgment; let them make this a colour to depart from themſelues: there is no leſſe woe to them that cal good, euil: To iudge one man is bold and daungerous: Iudge then, what it is to condemne a whole church: God knowes, as much without cauſe, as without ſhame, Vaine men may libel againſt the ſpouſe of Chriſt: her husband neuer diuorc't her: No, his loue is ſtill aboue their hatred, his bleſsinges aboue their cenſures: Do but ask them, were we euer the true church of God? If they deny it, Who then were ſo? Had God neuer Church vpon earth, ſince the Apoſtles time, till Barrow &amp; Greenwood aroſe? And euen then

ſcarce a number? nay, when or where was euer any man in the worlde (except in the Schooles perhaps of Donatus or Nouatus) that taught their Doctrine; and now ſtill hath hee none, but in a blind lane at Amſterdam? Can you thinke this probable? If they affirme it, when ceaſed we? Are not the pointes controuerted ſtill the ſame? The ſame Gouernment, the ſame doctrine? Their minds are changed, not our eſtate: Who hath admoniſhed, euinced, eccommunicated vs; and when? All theſe muſt be done; Will it not be a ſhame to ſay, that Francis Iohnſon, as he tooke power to excommunicate his Brother, and Father; ſo had power to excōmunicate his Mother, the Church? How baſe and idle are theſe conceits? Are we then heretickes condemned in ourſelues, wherin ouerthroew wee the foundation?

What other God, Sauiour, Scriptures, Iuſtification, Sacraments, Heauen, do they teach beſide vs? Can al the Maiſters of ſeperation, yea can al the churches in Chriſtendome, ſet forth a more exquiſite and woorthy confeſsion of Faith, then is contained in the Articles of the Church of England? Who can hold theſe, and be hereticall? Or, from which of theſe are we reuolted? But to make this good, they haue taught you to ſay, that euery trueth in Scripture is fundamentall; ſo fruitfull is errour of abſurdities; Whereof ſtil one breedes another more deformed then it ſelfe. That Trophimus was left at Miletum ſicke, that Pauls Cloake was left at Troas, that Gaius Paules hoaſt, ſaluted the Romaines, that Naball was drunke; or that Thamar baked Cakes, and a thouſand of this nature are fundamentall: how large is the ſeparatiſts

Creed, that hath all theſe Articles? If they ſay al Scripture is of the ſame author, of the ſame authority: ſo ſay we, but not of the ſame vſe: is it as neceſſary for a Chriſtian to knowe that Peter hoſted with one Simon a tanner in Ioppd, as that Ieſus Chriſt the ſon of God was born of the Virgin Mary. What a mōſter is this of an opiniō, that al trueths are equal? that this ſpiritual houſe ſhould be all foundation, no wals, no roofe? Can no man be ſaued but hee that knowes euery thing in ſcripture? Then both they and we, are excluded: heauē wold not haue ſo many, as their Parlor at Amſterdam: Can any man be ſaued that knowes nothing in Scripture? It is far frō them to bee ſo ouercharitable to affirm it: you ſee thē that both al truths muſt not of neceſsity be known, &amp; ſome muſt: &amp; theſe we iuſtly call fundamental: which who ſo holdeth, al his hay &amp; ſtubble (through the

mercy of God) condemn him not: ſtil he hath right to the church on erth, &amp; hope in heauē: but whither euery truth be fundamētal, or neceſſary: diſcipline (you ſay) is ſo: indeed neceſſary to the welbeing of a church, no more: it may be true without it, not perfect. Chriſt cō
                  pares his ſpouſe to an army with banners: as order is to an army, ſo is Diſcipline to the Church: if the troups be not well marſhalled in their ſeuerall ranks, &amp; moue not forward, acording to the diſcipline of warre, it is an army ſtil: cōfuſion may hinder their ſucces, it cannot bereaue thē of their name: it is, as beautiful proportiō to the body, an hedge to a vineyard, a wal to a Citty, an hem to a garment, ſeeling to an houſe. It may be a body, vineyard, Citty, garment, houſe, without them: it cannot be wel and perfect: yet which of our aduerſaries vvill ſay wee haue

no Diſcipline? Some they graunt, but not the right: as if they ſayde? Your Citty hath a Bricke-wall indeede, but it ſhould haue one of hewen ſtone; your Vineyard is hedged, but it ſhould be paled &amp; ditched: while they cauill at what wee want, wee thanke God for what wee haue; and ſo much we haue, in ſpight of all detraction, as makes vs both a true Church, and a worthy one.
               But the mayn quarrel is againſt our Miniſtery, and forme of worſhip: let theſe be examined; this is the Circle of their cenſure. No Church, therefore no Miniſtery: and no Miniſtery, therefore no Church: vnnatural ſons, that ſpit in the face of thoſe ſpirituall Fathers that be got them, and the Mother that bore them. What woulde they haue? Haue wee not competent guifts from aboue, for ſo great a function?

Are we all vnlearned, vnſufficient? Not a man that knowes to deuide the word aright? As Paul to the Corinthes, is it ſo that there is not one wiſe man amongeſt vs? No man vvill affirm it: ſome of them haue cenſured our exceſſe in ſome knowledge; none, our defect in all: What then? Haue we not a true deſire to do faithful ſeruice to God and his Church? No zeal for Gods glory? Who hath beene in our harts to ſee this? Who dare vſurp vpon God, &amp; condemn our thoughts? Yea, we appeale to that only Iudge of harts, whether he hath not giuen vs a ſincere longing for the good of his Syon: he ſhall make the thoughts of al hearts manifeſt: and then ſhall euerie man haue praiſe of God: if then wee haue both ability and will to do publick good: our inward calling (which is the mayne poynt) is good and perfect:

for the outward, what want wee? Are we not firſt (after good triall) preſented &amp; approued by the learned, in our Colledges: examined by our church-gouernors, ordaind by impoſition of hāds of the elderſhip, alowed by the congregations, we are ſet ouer: do we not labor in word &amp; doctrine? do we not carefully adminiſter the ſacraments of the Lord Ieſus? haue we not by our publick means won many ſoules to God? what ſhuld we haue &amp; do more? Al this, &amp; yet no true Miniſters? we paſſe very little to be iudged of thē, or of mans day: but our ordainers (you ſay) are Antichriſtian: ſurely our cenſurers are vnchriſtian: tho we ſhold grant it: ſome of vs were baptized by hereticks: is the ſacrament annihilated, and muſt it bee redoubled? How much leſſe ordination, which is but an outward admiſsion to preach

the goſpel? God forbid that we ſhold thus condemne the innocent: more hands were laid vpon vs, then one: &amp; of them, for the principall, except but their perpetual honor, &amp; ſom few immateriall rites, let an enemy ſay what they differ, from Super-intendents? &amp; can their double honor make them no elders? Jf they haue any perſonal falts, why is their calling ſcourged? Looke into our Sauiours times: what corruptions were in the very Prieſthood? It was now made annual, which was before fixed &amp; ſingular. Chriſt ſaw theſe abuſes, &amp; was ſilent: heere was much diſlike, and no clamour; we for leſſe, exclaim &amp; ſeperate: euen perſonal offences are fetcht into the condemnation of lawfull courſes. God giue both pardon and redreſſe to this foule vncharitableneſſe. Alas! how ready are wee to toſſe the fore-part of our

Wallet, whiles our owne faultes are ready to breake our neckes behinde vs: all the world ſees and condemnes their ordination to be faulty, yea none at all, yet they cry out firſt on vs, craftily (J thinke) leaſt wee ſhould complaine: that Church-gouernours ſhould ordaine Miniſters, hath beene the conſtant practiſe of the Church, from Chriſts time, to this houre. I except onely in an extreame deſolation, meerely for the firſt courſe: that the people ſhoulde make their Miniſters, was vnheard of in al ages &amp; Churches till Bolton, Browne, and Barrow: and hath neyther coulour nor example: Dooth not this compariſon ſeeme ſtrange and harſh? Their Tradeſmen may make true Miniſters, our Miniſters cānot: who but they wold not be aſhamed of ſuch a poſition? Or who but you woulde not thinke the tyme

miſpent in anſwering it? No leſſe friuolous are thoſe exceptions that are taken againſt our worſhippe of God, condemned for falſe and Idolatrous, whereof Volumnes of Apologies are written by others: we meet together, pray, read, heare, preach, ſing, adminiſter, and receiue Sacraments: wherein offend we? How many Goddes do we pray to? Or to whom but the true God? In what words but holy? whom do we preach but the ſame Chriſt with them? what point of faith, not theirs? What ſacraments but thoſe they dare not but allow? Where lyes our Idolatry, that we may let it out? Jn the maner of performing: in ſet Prayers, Antichriſtian Ceremonies of croſsing, kneeling, &amp;c, For the former: what ſinne is this? The Original and truth of Prayer is in the heart: the voyce is but as accidentall: if the heart may often

conceiue the ſame thought, the tongue her ſeruant may often vtter it, in the ſame words: and if daily to repeat the ſame ſpeeches be amiſſe, then to entertaine the ſame ſpirituall deſires, is ſinnefull: to ſpeak once without the heart is Hypocriticall: but to ſpeake often the ſame requeſt vvith the heart, neuer offendeth. What intollerable boldneſſe is this; to condemne that in vs which is recorded to haue beene the continuall practiſe of Gods Church in all ſucceſsions? Of the Iewes, in the time of Moſes, Dauid, Salomon, Iehoſophat, Ezekiah, Ieremie: Of the auncient Chriſtian aſſemblies, both Greek and Latine, and now at this day of all reformed churches in Chriſtendom; yea, which our Sauiour himſelfe ſo directly allowed, &amp; in a manner preſcribed: &amp; the bleſſed Apoſtles Paul &amp; Peter in all theyr

formall ſalutations (which were no other then ſet prayers) ſo commonlie practiſed: for the other (leaſt I exceed a letter) tho wee yeild thē ſuch as you imagine; worſe they cannot be: they are but Ceremonious appendances: the body &amp; ſubſtāce is ſound. Bleſſed be God that we can haue his true Sacraments at ſo eaſie a rate, as the payment (if they were ſuch) of a few circumſtantiall in conueniences: Howe many deer children of God in al ages, euen neere the Golden times of the Apoſtles, haue gladly purchaſed them much deerer, &amp; not complained: but ſee howe our Church impoſes them: not as to bind the Conſcience, otherwiſe then by the common bonde of obedience; not as actions; wherein Gods worſhip eſſentially conſiſteth, but as themſelues, Ceremonies: comely or couenient, not neceſſarie;

whatſoeuer: is this a ſufficient ground of ſeperation? Howe many moderate and wiſer ſpirits haue we, that cannot approue the Ceremonies, yet dare not forſake the Church? And that holde your departure far more euill, then the cauſe. You are inuited to a feaſt, if but a Napkin or Trencher bee miſplaced, or a diſh ill carued, do you run from the Table, and not ſtay to thank the hoaſt? Eyther be leſſe curious, or more charitable. Woulde God both you, and all other, which either fauor the ſeperation, or profeſſe it, coulde but read ouer the auncient Stories of the Church, to ſee the true ſtate of things and times; the beginninges, proceedings, increaſes, encounters yeildings, reſtaurations of the Goſpell, what the holy Fathers of thoſe firſt times, were glad to ſwallow, for peace; what they helde, practiſed,

found, left: whoſoeuer knowes but theſe things cannot ſeperate: and ſhal not be contented onely, but thankful: God ſhall giue you ſtill more light: in the meane time, vpon the perril of my ſoule, ſtay, and take the bleſſed offers of your God, in peace: And ſince Chriſt ſayeth to you by my hand, wil you alſo go away? Anſwere him with that worthy Diſciple, Maiſter whether shall I go from thee, thou haſt the words of eternall life?

                  ¶ A complaint of the miſ-education of our Gentry.
                  
               
               
                  I Confeſſe, I cannot honor blood without good qualities, not ſpare it; with ill. There is nothing that I more deſire to be taught, then what is true Nobilitie: What thanke is it to you

that you are borne wel? If you could haue loſt this priuiledge of Nature, I feare you had not beene thus far Noble: That you may not plead deſert, you had this before you were; long ere you could either know or preuent it; you are deceiued if you thinke this any other then the body of Gentility, the life and ſoule of it, is in noble and vertuous diſpoſition, in gallantneſſe of ſpirit, without hautineſſe, without inſolence, without ſcornfull ouer lyneſſe: ſhortly, in generous qualities, carriage, actions. See your error, and know that this demeanor dooth not aunſwere an honeſt byrth: If you can follow all faſhions, drinke all healths, weare fauours and good cloths, conſort with Ruffians, companions, ſwear the biggeſt Oaths, quarrell eaſily, fight deſperately, game in euery inordinate Ordinary, ſpend your patrimony ere

it fall, looke on euery man betwixt ſcorne and anger; vſe gracefully ſome geſtures of apiſh complement; talke irreligiouſly, dally with a Miſtris, or (which tearme is plainer) hunt after Harlots, take ſmoake at a Play-houſe, and liue as if you were made all for ſport, you thinke you haue doone enough, to merit, both of your blood, and others opinions. Certainly, the world hath no baſeneſſe, if this be generoſity: Wel-fare the honeſt and ciuill rudeneſſe of the obſcure ſonnes of the earth, if ſuch be the graces of the eminent: The ſhame whereof (methinkes) is not ſo proper to the wildneſſe of youth, as to the careleſneſſe or vanity of Parents: I ſpeake it boldly; our land hath no blemmiſh comparable to the miſ-education of our Gentry; Infancy and youth are the ſeedtimes of al hopes: if thoſe paſſe vnſeaſonably,

no fruit can be expected from our age, but ſhame and ſorrow: who ſhould improue theſe, but they which may commaund them: I cannot altogether complaine of our firſt yeares. How like are wee to children, in the training vp of our children? Giue a childe ſome painted Babe; he ioyes in it at firſt ſight: and for ſome daies wil not abide it out of his hand or boſome; but when hee hath ſated himſelfe with the newe pleaſure of that gueſt, hee now (after a while) caſts it into Corners, forgets it, and can look vpon it, with no care: Thus do we by ours. Their firſt times finde vs not more fond, then carefull: we doe not more follow them with our loue, then ply them with inſtruction: When this delight beginnes to grow ſtale, we begin to grow negligent. Nothing that I know can be faulted in the ordering

of Child-hood, but indulgence Fooliſh Mothers, admit of Tutors, but debarre rods? Theſe, while they deſire their Children may learne, but not ſmart, as is ſayde of Apes, kill theyr young ones with loue; for what can worke vpon that age, but feare? And what feare without correction? Now at laſt, with what meaſure of Learning their owne wil would vouchſafe to receiue, they are too earely ſent to the Common Nurſeries of Knowledge; There (vnleſſe they fal vnder carefull tuition) they ſtudy in ieſt, and play in earneſt. In ſuch vniuerſal meanes of Learning, all cannot fal beſides them; what their company, what their recreation would either inſtil or permit, they bring home to their gladde parents. Thence are they tranſplanted to the Collegiate Jnnes of our common Lawes: and there too manie learne

to be lawleſſe, and to forget their former little. Paules is their VVeſtminster, their Study, an Ordinary, or Playhouſe, or Dauncing Schoole; &amp; ſome Lambert their Polydon. And now after they haue (not without much expence) learned faſhions and licentiouſneſſe, they returne home, full of welcomes and gratulations. By this time ſome bloſſomes of youth appearing in their face, admoniſh their Parents to ſeeke them ſome ſeaſonable match; Wherein the Father inquires for Wealth, the Sonne for Beautie, perhappes the Mother for parentage, ſcarce any for Vertue, for Religion. Thus ſetled, What is their care, theyr diſcourſe; yea, their Trade, but eyther an Hound, or an Hawke? And it is wel, if no woorſe: And now, they ſo liue, as if they had forgotten that there were Bookes: Learning is for

Prieſts, and Pedants; For Gentlemen, pleaſure. Oh! that eyther wealth, or wit ſhould bee caſt away thus baſely: That euer Reaſon ſhould growe ſo debauched, as to thinke any thinge more worthy then knowledge: with what ſhame and emulation may wee looke vpon other Nations (whoſe Apiſh faſhions we can take vppe in the Channelles, neglecting their immitable examples) and with what ſcorn do they looke vpon vs? They haue their ſolemne Academies for all thoſe qualities, which may accompliſh Gentility: from which they returne richly furniſhed, both for action and ſpeculation. They account knowledge and ability of diſcourſe as eſſential to great neſſe, as bloud: neither are they more aboue the vulgar in byrth, then in vnderſtanding: They trauel with iudgement, and return with experience: ſo

do they followe the excerciſes of the body, that they neglect not the culture of the mind. From hence growes ciuility, and power, to mannage affayres either of Iuſtice or State; From hence incouragement to learning, &amp; reuerence from inferiors. For thoſe onely can eſteeme knowledge, which haue it; and the common ſort frame either their obſeruance, or contempt out of the example of their leaders.
               Amongſt them, the ſons of Nobles ſcorne not, either Marchandiſe, or learned profeſsions; and hate nothing ſo much, as to do nothing: I ſhame &amp; hate to thinke, that our gallants hold there can be no diſparagement, but in honeſt callings. Thus perhaps I haue abated the enuy of this reproofe, by cōmunicating it to more; which J had not done, but that the generality of euil importunes redreſſe. I wel ſee that

either good or euil deſcends: In vain ſhall we hope for the reformation of the many, while the better are diſordered. Whome to ſolicit heerein, J know not, but all: How gald ſhould I be, to ſpend my light to the ſnuffe, for the effecting of this? I can but perſwade and pray; theſe I will not fayle of: The reſt to him that both can amend and puniſh.

                  ¶ Written ſome whiles ſince, concerning ſome new opinions then broached in the Churches of Holland; and vnder the name of Arminius (then liuing) perſwading al great wits to a ſtudy and care of the common Peace of the Church, and diſswading from al affect ation of ſingularity.
                  
               
               
                  I Receiued lately, a ſhort relation of ſome newe Paradoxes from your Leiden; you would know what we thinke: I feare not to be cenſured, as

medling: your truth is ours: The Sea cannot deuide thoſe Churches whom one faith vnites. I know not howe it comes to paſſe, that moſt men, while they too much affect ciuility, turne flatterers; and plaine trueth is moſt where counted rudeneſſe. Hee that tels a ſicke friend he looks il, or termes an angrie tumour the Gowt, or a wateriſh ſwelling, Dropſy; is thought vnmannerly. For my part, I am glad that I was not borne to feed humors: How euer you take your owne euils, I muſt tell you, wee pittie you, and thinke you haue iuſt cauſe of deiection, and we for you: not for any priuate cares, but (which touch a Chriſtian neereſt) the Common-wealth of God. Behold, after all thoſe hilles of carcaſſes, and ſtreames of bloud, your ciuill ſword is ſheathed, wherein wee neither congratulate, nor feare your

peace; lo now, inſted of that, another while, the ſpiritual ſword is drawn and ſhaken, &amp; it is wel if no more. Now the politick State ſits ſtil, the church quarrels: Oh! the inſatiable hoſtility of our great enemy, with what chaunge of miſchiefes dooth he afflict miſerable man? No ſooner did the Chriſtian world begin to breath frō perſecution but it was more puniſhed with Arrianiſine: when the red dragon cānot deuour the child, he tries to drowne the mother; &amp; when the waters fail, he raiſes war. Your famous Iunius had nothing more admirable thē his loue of peace: when our buſy ſeparatiſts apealed him, with what a ſweet calmnes did he reiect them, &amp; with a graue importunity cal'd thē to moderation. How it wold haue vexed his holy ſoule (now out of the danger of paſſions, to haue forſeene his chaire trobleſom. God forbid that

the Church ſhould find a challenger, inſtead of a Champion: Who would thinke but you ſhould haue beene taught the benefite of peace, by the long want? but if your temporal ſtate (beſides either hope, or beleefe) hath growne wealthy with War, like thoſe Fowles which fatten with harde weather: yet be too ſure, that theſe ſpiritual broyles, cannot but impoueriſh the Church; yea, affamiſh it. Jt were pitty that your Holland ſhould be ſtil the Amphitheatre of the worlde, on whoſe Scaffoldes, all other Nations ſhould ſit, and ſee variety of bloudie ſhewes, not vvithout pitty, and horror. Jf I might challenge ought in that your acute, and Learned Arminius; I vvould thus ſolicit, and coniure him: Alas! that ſo Wiſe a man ſhould not know the vvorth of peace; that ſo noble a Sonne of the Church, ſhoulde

not be brought to light, without ripping the wombe of his Mother! what meane theſe ſubtle Nouelties? If they make thee famous, and the Churche miſerable; who ſhall gain by them? Is ſingularity ſo precious, that it ſhould coſt no leſſe, then the ſafety and quiet of our common mother? If it be truth thou affecteſt; what alone? Coulde neuer any eyes (till thine) bee bleſſed with this obiect; where hath that Sacred verity hid her ſelf thus long from all her carefull Inquiſitors, that ſhee now firſt ſhewes her head to thee vnſought? Hath the Goſpel ſhined thus long, and bright, and left ſome Corners vnſeene? Away with all newe truths; faire and plauſible they may be, ſound they cannot: ſome may admire thee for them; none ſhall bleſſe thee. But graunt that ſome of theſe, are no leſſe true, then nice poyntes;

What doe theſe vnſeaſonable Crochets and quauers trouble the harmonious plain-ſongs of our peace? Some quiet error may bee better then ſome vnruly truth. Who binds vs to ſpeak all we thinke? So the Church may be ſtill, would God thou wert wiſe alone? Did not our aduerſaries quarrell enough before, at our quarrels? Were they not rich enough with our ſpoils? By the dear name of our common parents, what meaneſt thou, Arminius? Whether tend theſe new-rais'd diſſentions? Who ſhall thriue by them, but they which inſult vpon vs, &amp; riſe by the fall of truth? who ſhall be vndone, but thy Brethren? By that moſt precious, and bloudy ranſome of our Sauiour, and by that awefull appearance, we ſhall once make before the glorious Tribunall of the ſon of God, remember thy ſelfe, and the poore diſtracted

limbes of the Church, let not thoſe excellent parts, wherewith God hath furniſhed thee, lye in the narrow way, and cauſe any weake one, eyther to fall, or ſtumble, or erre. For Gods ſake, either ſay nothing, or the ſame. How many great wittes haue ſought no By-paths, and now are happy with their fellowes. Let it be no diſparagement to goe with many to heauen. What could hee reply to ſo playne a charge? No diſtinction can auoid the power of ſimple truth. I know hee hears not this of me firſt: Neither that learned and woorthy Fran. Gomarus, nor your other graue fraternity of reuerend Diuines, haue beene ſilent in ſo mayne a cauſe. I feare rather too much noyſe in any of theſe tumults: There may too many contend; not intreat. Multitude of ſutors, is commonly powerfull; howe much more

in iuſt motions, But if either hee, or you, ſhall turne me home, and bid me ſpend my little moiſture vppon our owne brandes, I graunt there is both the ſame cauſe, and the ſame neede. This Counſell is no whit further from vs, becauſe it is directed to you: Any Reader can chaunge the perſon: I lament to ſee, that euery where peace hath not many Clients, but fewer louers; yea, euen many of thoſe that praiſe her, follow her not. Of old, the very Nouation men, Women, Children, brought ſtones and morter (with the Orthodox) to the building of the Church of the Reſurrection, and ioyned louingly with them, againſt the Arrians: leſſer quarrels diuide vs; and euery diuiſion ends in blowes, and euery blow is returned; and none of al lightes beſide the Church: Euen the beſt Apoſtles diſſented; neither knoledge,

nor holyneſſe can redreſſe all differences: True, but wiſedome and charity could teach vs to auoyde their preiudice. If we had but theſe two vertues; quarrels ſhould not hurt vs, nor the Church by vs: But (alas) ſelf-loue is too ſtrong for both theſe: This alone opens the flood-gates of diſſention, and drownes the ſweet, but low valley of the Church. Men eſteem of opinions, becauſe their owne; &amp; will haue truth ſerue, not gouerne; What they haue vnder-taken, muſt be true: Victory is ſought for, not ſatisfaction; Victory of the Authour, not of the cauſe: Hee is a rare man that knowes to yeeld, as wel to argue: what ſhold we do then, but beſtow our ſelues vpon that which too many neglect, publicke peace; firſt, in Prayers that we may preuaile, then in teares that we preuaile not? Thus haue I beene

bold to chat with you of our greateſt and common cares. Your old loue, &amp; late Hoſpitall entertainment in that your Iſland, called for this rememberance; the rather to keepe your Engliſh tongue in breath, which was wont not to bee the leaſt of your deſires. Would God you could make vs hapy with newes not of Truce, but ſincere amity &amp; vnion; not of Prouinces, but ſpirits. The God of Spirits effect it both heere and there, to the glory of his Name and Church.
            
            
               
               EPIST. VIII. To W. I. condemned for Murder.
               
                  ¶ Effectually preparing him, and (vnder his name) whatſoeuer Malefactor, for his death.
                  
               
               
                  IT is a bad cauſe that robbeth vs of al the comfort of friendes; yea, that turnes their remēbrance into ſorrow. None can do ſo, but thoſe that proceed from

our ſelues; For outward euils, which come from the infliction of others, make vs cleaue faſter to our helpers, and cauſe vs to ſeeke and finde eaſe in the very commiſſeration of thoſe that loue vs: whereas thoſe grieſes which ariſe from the iuſt diſpleaſure of Conſcience, will not abide ſo much, as the memory of others affection; or if it do, makes it ſo much the greater corraſiue, as our caſe is more vncapeable of their comfort. Such is yours. You haue made the mention of our names tedious to your ſelfe, and yours to vs. This is the beginning of your payne, that you had frends: If you may now ſmart ſoundly from vs, for your good, it muſt be the onely ioy you muſt expect, and the finall dutie wee owe to you. It is both vaine and comfortleſſe to heare what might haue beene; neither would J ſend you backe to what

is paſt, but purpoſely to increaſe your ſorrow; who haue cauſed al our comfort to ſtand in your teares. If therefore our former Counſailes had preuailed, neyther had your hands ſhed innocent bloude, nor Iuſtice yours. Now, to your great ſinne, you haue done the one, and the other muſt be done to your paine, and we your welwillers, with ſorrow and ſhame liue to be witneſſes of both. Your ſin is gone before, the reuenge of Iuſtice wil follow: Seeing you are guilty, let GOD be iuſt; Other ſinnes ſpeake, this cryeth; and will neuer be ſilent, till it bee anſwered with it ſelfe: For your life; the caſe is hopeles; feed not your ſelfe with vaine preſumptions, but ſettle your ſelfe to expiate anothers bloude vvith your owne. Would God your deſert had beene ſuch, that we might vvith any comfort haue deſired you

might liue. But now, alas, your fact is ſo heynous, that your life can neyther bee craued without in-iuſtice, nor bee protracted without inwarde torment. And if our priuate affection ſhoulde make vs deafe to the ſhouts of bloud, and partiality ſhould teach vs to forget all care of publicke right, yet reſolue, there is no place for hope. Since then you could not liue guiltleſſe, there remaines nothing but that you labour to dye penitent; and ſince your bodye cannot bee ſaued aliue, to endeuour that your ſoule may bee ſaued in death. Wherein, howe happye ſhall it bee for you, if you ſhall yet giue care to this my laſt aduice; too late indeede for your recompence to the Worlde, not too late for your ſelfe. You haue deſerued death, and expect it; Take heede leaſt you ſo faſten your eyes

vppon the firſt death of the body, that you ſhould not look beyond it, to the ſecond, which alone is worthy of trē
                  bling, worthy of teares.
               For this, though terrible to Nature, yet is common to vs, with you. You muſt dye: What doe wee elſe? And what differs our end from yours, but in haſt and violence? And vvho knowes whether in that? It may bee a ſickeneſſe as ſharpe, as ſuddaine, ſhal fetch vs hence: It may bee the ſame death, or a worſe, for a better cauſe: Or if not ſo, There is much more miſerie in lingering: Hee dies eaſily, that dyes ſoone: But the other, is the vtmoſt vengeaunce that GOD hath reſerued for his enemies: This is a matter of long feare, and ſhort payne. A few panges lets the ſoule out of priſon; but the Torment of that other is euerlaſting; after tenne

thouſand yeares ſcorching in that flame, the payne is neuer the neerer to his ending. No time giues it hope of abating; yea, time hath nothing to do with this eternity. You that ſhall feele the paine of one minutes dying, thinke what paine it is to be dying for euer and euer. This, although it bee attended with a ſharpe paine, yet is ſuch as ſome ſtrong ſpirits haue indured without ſhew of yeildance. I haue herd of an Iriſh Traitor, that when he lay pining vppon the wheele with his bones broke, asked his friend if hee changed his countenance at all: caring leſſe for the paine, then the ſhew of feare. Few men haue dyed of greater paines, then others haue ſuſtained and liue. But that other ouer-whelms both body and ſoule, and leaues no roome for any comfort in the poſsibility of mitigation. Heere, men are

executioners, or diſeaſes; there fiends. Thoſe diuels that were ready to tempt the graceleſſe vnto ſinne, are as ready to follow the damned with tortures. Whatſoeuer becom of your carcaſſe, ſaue your ſoule from theſe flames: and ſo mannage this ſhort time you haue to liue, that you may die but once. This is not your firſt ſinne; yea, God hath now punniſhed your former ſins with this: A fearefull puniſhment in it ſelfe, if it deſerued no more: your cō
                  ſcience (which now beginnes to tell trueth) cannot but aſſure you, that there is no ſinne more worthy of hell, then murder; yea, more proper to it. Turne ouer thoſe holy leaues (which you haue too much neglected, &amp; now ſmart for neglecting) you ſhall finde Murderers among thoſe that are ſhut out from the preſence of God: you ſhall finde the Prince of that darknes,

in the higheſt ſtile of his miſchief, termed a Manſlayer. Alas! how fearefull a caſe is this, that you haue heerein-reſembled him, for whome Topheth was prepared of old, and imitating him in his action, haue endangered your ſelf to partake of his tormēts. Oh, that you coulde but ſee what you haue done, what you haue deſerued; That your heart could bleed enough within you, for the bloud your handes haue ſhed: That as you haue followed Satan our common enemy in ſinning, ſo you could defye him in repenting: That your teares could diſapoint his hopes of your damnation. What an happy vnhappineſſe ſhall this be to your ſad friendes, that your better part yet liueth? That frō an ignominious place, your ſoule is receyued to glory? Nothing can effect this but your Repentance, and that can do it. Feare not to

looke into that horrour, which ſhould attend your ſinne, and bee now as ſeuere to your ſelfe, as you haue beene cruell to another. Thinke not to extenuate your offence with the vain Titles of man-hood; what praiſe is this, that you were a valiaunt Murderer? Strike your owne breaſt (as Moſes did his Rooke) and bring down Riuers of tears to waſh away your bloud-ſhed. Do not ſo much feare your iudgment, as abhorre your ſinne; yea, your ſelfe for it: And with ſtrong cries lift vppe your guilty hands to that God whom you offended, and ſay: Deliuer mee from blood-guiltines O Lord. Let me tell you, as without repentance there is no hope, ſo with it, ther is no condemnation. True penitence is ſtrong, &amp; can grapple with the greateſt ſin, yea with all the powers of hell. What if your hands be red with blood? Behold, the

blood of your Sauiour, ſhall waſh away yours: If you can bath your ſelfe in that; your Scarlet ſoule ſhall be as white as Snow. This courſe alone ſhal make your Croſſe the way to the Paradice of God. This plaiſter can heale all the ſores of the foul, if neuer ſo deſperate: Onely, take heede that your heart bee deepe enough pierced, ere you lay it on; elſe vnder a ſeeming skinne of diſsimulation, your ſoule ſhall feſter to death. Yet ioy vs vvith your true ſorrowe, whome you haue grieued with your offence; &amp; at once comfort your friends, and ſaue your ſoule.
            
            
               
               EPIST. IX. To Mr. 
                  Iohn Mole, of a long time nowe priſoner vnder the Inquiſition at Rome.
               
                  ¶ Exciting him to his wonted Conſtancie, and incouraging him to Martyrdome.
                  
               
               
                  WHat paſſage can theſe lines hope to finde into that your ſtraight and curious thraldome? Yet who would not aduenture the loſſe

of this paines for him, which is ready to looſe himſelf for Chriſt? what do we not ow to you which haue thus giuen your ſelf for the cōmon faith? bleſſed be the name of that God who hath ſingled you out for his Champion, &amp; made you inuincible: how famous are your bonds? How glorious your conſtancy? Oh, that out of your cloſe obſcurity, you could but ſee the honour of your ſuffring, the affections of Gods Saints, &amp; in ſom, an holy enuy at your diſtreſſed hapines. Thoſe wals cannot hide you: No man is attended with ſo many eyes from earth &amp; heauen: The Church your Mother beholdes you, not with more compaſſion, then ioy: Neither can it bee ſayde, how ſhee at once pitties your miſery, and reioyces in your patience: The bleſſed Angels looke vpon you with gratulation and applauſe. The aduerſaries with an angry

ſorrowe to ſee themſelues ouercome by their captiue, their obſtinate cruelty ouer-matched with humble reſolution, and faithfull perſeuerance. Your Sauiour ſees you from aboue, not as a meer ſpectator, but as a patient with you, in you, for you; yea, as an agent in your indurance &amp; victory, giuing new courage with the one hād, and holding out a Crowne with the other; Whom would not theſe ſights incorage? who now can pitty your ſolitarineſſe? The harts of all good men are with you. Neither can that place be but full of angels, which is the continuall obiect, of ſo many Prayers, yea the God of heauen was neuer ſo near you, as now ye are remooued from men. Let me ſpeake a bold, but true worde. Jt is as poſsible for him to bee abſent from his Heauen, as from the priſons of his Saints. The glorified ſpirits

aboue ſing to him; the perſecuted ſoules below, ſuffer for him, and crie to him; he is magnified in both, preſent with both; the faith of the one, is as pleaſing to him, as the triumph of the other; Nothing obligeth vs men ſo much, as ſmarting for vs; words of defence are woorthy of thankes, but pain is eſteemed aboue recompence. How do we kiſſe the woundes which are taken for our ſakes, and profeſſe that we would hate our ſelues, if wee did not loue thoſe that dare bleed for vs: How much more ſhal the God of mercies be ſenſible of your ſorrowes, and crowne your patience? To whom you may truely ſing that ditty of the Diuine Pſalmist, Surely for thy ſake am I ſlaine continually, and am counted as a Sheepe for the ſlaughter. What neede I to ſtir vp your conſtancy, which hath already amazed, and wearied your

perſecutors? No ſuſpition ſhall driue me heereto; but rather the thirſt of your praiſe. He that exhorts to perſiſt in well-doing, whiles he perſwades, commendeth. Whether ſhoulde I rather ſend you, then to the ſight of your own Chriſtian fortitude? which neither Prayers, nor threats, haue bin able to ſhake: Heere ſtands on the one hand, Liberty, Promotion, Pleaſure, life, and (which eaſily exceeds al theſe) the deare reſpect of wife and children (whome your onely reſolution ſhall make Widdow and Orphanes) theſe with ſmiles, and vowes, and teares, ſeeme to importune you. On the other hand, bondage, ſolitude, horror, death (and the moſt lingering of all miſeries) ruine of poſterity: theſe with frowns and menaces labour to afright you: Betwixt both, you haue ſtoode vnmooued; fixing your eyes either

right forward vpon the cauſe of your ſuffering, or vpwards vppon the Crowne of your reward: It is an happy thing when our owne actions may be either examples, or arguments of good. Theſe bleſſed proceedings call you on to your perfection; The reward of good beginnings proſecuted, is doubled; neglected, is loſt. How vaine are thoſe temptations, vvhich (would make you a looſer of all this praiſe; this recompence? Go on therfore happily; keepe your eies where they are, and your heart cannot bee, but where it is, and where it ought: Looke ſtill, for what you ſuffer, &amp; for whom: For the truth, or Chriſt: what can be ſo precious as truth? Not life it ſelfe. All earthly things are not ſo vile to life, as life to truth; Life is momentary, Truth eternall; Life is ours, the Truth, Gods: Oh happy purchaſe, to

giue our life for the Truth. What can we ſuffer too much for Chriſt? He hath giuen our life to vs; he hath giuen his own life for vs. What great thing is it, if he require what he hath giuen vs, if ours for his? Yea, rather, if he cal for what he hath lent vs; yet not to bereue but to chaunge it; giuing vs Gold for our clay, glory for our corruption. Behold that Sauiour of yours weeping, &amp; bleeding, &amp; dying for your alas! our ſoules are too ſtrait for his ſorrowes; we can be made but paine for him; He was made ſin for vs: we ſuſtain for him, but the impotent anger of men, hee ſtrugled with the infinite wrath of his Father for vs. Oh, who can endure enough for him, that hath paſſed thorough Death and hell for his Soule? Thinke this, and you ſhall reſolue with Dauid, I will bee yet more vile for the Lord. The woorſt of the deſpight

of men, is but Death; and that, if they inflict not, a diſeaſe wil; or if not that, Age. Heere is no impoſition of that which would not be but an haſtening of that which will bee: An haſtening, to your gaine. For behold, their violence ſhall turne your neceſsity, into Vertue and profit. Nature hath made you mortall, none but an enemie can make you a Martyr; you muſt die, though they will not; you cannot die for Chriſt, but by them: How coulde they elſe deuiſe to make you happie? Since the giuer of both liues hath ſaid, Hee that shall looſe his life for my ſake, shall ſaue it. Loe, this alone is loſt with keeping, and gained by loſſe. Say you were freed, vppon the ſafeſt conditions, and returning: (As how welcome ſhould that newes be, more to yours, then to your ſelfe.) Perhappes, death may meete you in the

way, perhaps ouer-take you at home: neither place, nor time, can promiſe immunitie from the common deſtinie of men: Thoſe that may abridge your houres, cannot lengthen them; and while they laſt, cannot ſecure them from vexation; yea themſelues ſhall followe you into their duſt; and cannot auoide what they can inflicte; death ſhal equalie tirannize by them, and ouer them: ſo their fauors are but fruitleſſe, their malice gainefull. For, it ſhall change your priſon into heauen, your Fetters into a Crown, your Iailours to Angels, your miſery into glory. Looke vppe to your future eſtate, and reioyce in the preſent: Beholde the Tree of Life, the hidden Manna, the Scepter of Power, the Morning-Starre, the white garment, the newe name, the Crowne, and Throne of Heauen are adreſſed for

you. Ouercome and enioy them: oh glorious condition of Martyrs, whom conformity in death, hath made like their Sauiour in bleſſedneſſe; whoſe honour is to attend him for euer, whō they haue ioyed to imitate. VVhat are theſe which are arayd in long white robes, and whence came they? Theſe are (ſaies that Heauenly Elder) they which came out of great Tribulation, and vvashed their long Robes, and haue made their long Robes white, in the bloude of the Lambe.
               
               
                  Therefore they are in the preſence of the Throne of GOD, and ſerue him day and night in the Temple: and hee that ſitteth on the Throne, will dwel among them, and Gouerne them, and leade them vnto the liuelie Fountaines of waters, and GOD shall wipe all teares from their eyes.
               
               All the elect haue Seales in theyr

fore-heades: But Martyrs haue Palme in theyr handes: All the elect haue White Robes; Martyrs, both white and long. White, for their Glorie, long for the largeneſſe of their Glorie. Once redde with theyr owne bloude; now white with the bloude of the Lambe: There is nothing in our bloude, but weake obedience; nothing but merrit in the Lambes-bloud. Behold, his merite makes our obedience Glorious. You doo but ſprinckle his feet with your bloude; Loe, hee waſhes your long white Robes, with his. Euerie droppe of your bloude is anſwered with a ſtreame of his; and euerie droppe of his, is woorth Riuers of ours: Precious in the ſight of the Lorde, is the Death of his Saintes: Precious in preuention; Precious in acceptation, precious in remuneration.

Oh, giue willingly that which you cannot keepe, that you may receyue what you cannot leeſe. The way is ſteepe, but now you breath towardes the top. Let not the want of ſome few ſteps, looſe you an eternall reſt. Put too the ſtrength of your owne Fayth; The Prayers of Gods Saints ſhall further your pace; &amp; that gracious hand that ſuſtaines heauen and earth, ſhall vphold, and ſweetly draw you vp to your glory. Go on to credite the goſpell with your perſeuerance, and ſhew the falſe-hearted Clients of that Romayne-Court, that the Trueth yeildes reall and heartie profeſſours; ſuch as dare no leſſe ſmart, then ſpeake for her.
               Without the wals of your reſtraint, where can you looke beſide encouragements of ſuffering? Beholde in this, how much you are happier then

your many predeceſſors. Thoſe haue found friends, or wiues, or children, the moſt dangerous of al tempters. Suggeſtions of weakenes, when they com masked with loue, are more powerfull to hurt. But you, all your manie friendes, in the valour of their Chriſtian loue, wiſh rather a bleſſed Martyr, then a liuing and proſperous reuolter: yea, your deare wife (worthy of this honour, to be the wife of a Martyr) preferres your faith, to her affection; and in a courage beyond hir Sex, contemnes the worſt miſerie of your loſſe; profeſsing ſhe woulde redeeme your life with hirs, but that ſhe would not redeeme it with your yeildance: and while ſhee lookes vppon thoſe manie pawns of your chaſt loue, your hopefull Children, wiſhes rather to ſee them fatherleſſe, then their Father vnfaithfull: The greateſt part

of your ſufferings are hers. She beares them with a cheerefull reſolution. She diuides with you in your ſorrowes, in your patience; ſhe ſhall not bee diuided in your glory: For vs we ſhall accompanie you, with our Prayers, and followe you with our thankefull commemorations; vowing to Write your name in red Letters, in the Kalenders of our hearts; and to Regiſter it in the monuments of perpetual Records, as an example to all poſteritie, The memoriall of the iuſt shal bee bleſſed.

                  ¶ Containing Rules of good aduiſe for our Chriſtian and ciuill carriage.
                  
               
               
                  I Grant, Breuitie where it is neyther obſcure nor defectiue, is very pleaſing, euen to the daintiſt iudgments. No maruaile therefore, if moſt men deſire much good coūſel in a narrow room;

as ſome affect to haue great perſonages, drawne in little Tablets, or, as we ſee worlds of Countreyes deſcribed in the compaſſe of ſmall Mappes: Neither do I vnwillingly yeild to ſollowe them; for both the powers of good aduice are the ſtronger, when they are thus vnited; and breuitie makes counſell more portable for memorie, and readier for vſe. Take theſe therefore for more; which as I would faine practiſe, ſo am I willing to commend. Let vs begin with him who is the firſt and laſt: Informe your ſelfe aright concerning God, without whome, in vaine do we know all things: Bee acquainted with that Sauiour of yours, which paid ſo much for you on earth, and now ſues for you in heauen; without whom, wee haue nothing to doe with God, nor he with vs. Adore him in your thoughts, truſt him with your

ſelfe: Renew your ſight of him euerie day; and his of you: Ouer-look theſe earthly things, &amp; when you do at any time caſt your eyes vppon heauen, thinke, there dwels my Sauiour, there I ſhall be. Call your ſelfe to often reckonings, caſt vp your debts, paiments, graces, wants expences, imploiments, yeeld not to thinke your ſet Deuotions troubleſome: Take not eaſie denialles from your ſelfe; yea, giue peremptory denials to your ſelfe; Hee can neuer bee good that flatters himſelfe: hold nature to her allowaunce; and let your wil ſtand at curteſy: happy is that man, which hath obtained to be the Maiſter of his owne heart: Thinke all Gods outward fauors and prouiſions the beſt for you; your own abilities, and actions the meaneſt. Suffer not your minde to bee either a Drudge or a wanton; exerciſe it euer,

but ouerlay it not: In al your buſineſſes look throgh the world, at God; whatſoeuer is your leuell, let him bee your ſcope: Euery day take a view of your laſt, and thinke either it is this, or may be: Offer not your ſelfe either to honour, or labour; let them both ſeeke you: Care you onely to be woorthy, and you cannot hide you from God; ſo frame your ſelf to the time &amp; companie, that you may neyther ſerue it; nor ſullenly neglect it; and yeeld
                     •

Let your words bee few, and digeſted; It is a ſhame for the tongue to cry the heart mercie, much more to caſt it ſelfe vpon the vncertaine pardon of others eares. There are but two things which a Chriſtian is charged to buy, and not to ſell, Time and Truth; both, ſo precious, that we muſt purchaſe them at

Do not hear from your ſelfe, what you would be loath to hear from others.
