            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To the gentle Reader.
            
               HAuing gotten a Copie of this Letter (gentle Reader) I thought good to make thee partaker of the ſame by publishing it in print: that therby thou, and as many as vvish vvell vnto the ſtate of England, may according to our duetie thanke our God, that hath ſo mercifully deliuered vs from our proude enemies, and shevved his iudgement vpon them beyond our expectation, and further then vve could almoſt haue vvished. For of the proude Spanish Fleete appointed for our ouerthrovve, containing ſo many ships in number, ſo vvell in all reſpects furnished, that they could deſire nothing that ſeemed to be vvanting: there returned very fevve, and thoſe ſo ſore afflicted, that the moſt of their men died either before or shortly after their returne, vtterly diſapppointed of their intent, and hauing loſt the greateſt part of their prouiſion. Moreouer vve may hereby perceiue vvhat great good hope vve haue to conceiue (God giuing aſſiſtance) of the intended voyage. There is great hope they vvill ſcarce vvell brooke the comming of the Fleete, ſith they can hardly abide ſome one or tvvo of our English ships.

            THE COPIE OF A LETTER SENT BY A GENTLEMAN FROM SEA TO A WORSHIPFVL FRIEND OF HIS.
            
               RIGHT worſhipful hauing bene emploied by my Generals Sir Iohn Norris and Sir Frauncis Drake vpō the coaſt of Spaine for diſcouerie, and now being ſafely arriued (thanks vnto the Almightie) I thought it my duetie to acquaint your worſhip with ſuch newes as I haue learned in my voyage, hoping that as you were wont, you will excuſe my preſumption. I ſayled the fourth of Februarie laſt, and coaſting along by Biskay, at the Groine I tooke a ſhip of Biskay laden with ſtones, for the building of a fort at Vigo within the North Cape. In the which there came a marchant of Lisbone as paſſenger from Sainct Sebaſtians, whome I haue brought with me. And as concerning the laſt Fleete, he ſayth, that of all the ſhips and caruels of the Spaniſh

Fleete there are come home but nine and thirtie, whereof foure and twentie are riding in a riuer by Sainct Sebaſtians, foureteene in the Groine, and one in Lisbone, but moſt of all the men that came home died immediatly at their landing, and the two chiefe commaunders of the ſhips being ſent for to the Court, died, as it is thought of poiſon before they had paſſed two dayes iourney from Sainct Sebaſtians. Alſo the Duke of Medina is baniſhed the Court for euer and certaine cuſtomes of his confiſcate to the holy houſe. Alſo the King doth with all ſpeede fortifie the ſea coaſts, eſpecially in Portingale, and hath erected a bulwark in the market place of Lisbone. He hath made no prouiſion of ſhipping, but only a Fleete of gallies which are now in the Straights, and came downe for the defence of his owne countrey. He doth grieuouſly take the death of his men, for they were the chiefe ſouldiers of all his forces in Italie and elſe where. All theſe I haue conferred with others that haue fallen into my hands ſince, and found it to be a perfect truth. From the Groine I came to the rocke at Lisbone, where I found a barke of Plymouth and two other Pinnaces chaſed by foure Gallies and a Frenchman of warre, who

was conſorted with the gallies, who as ſoone as they ſaw my ſhip, the barke began to fight with them, &amp; had ſhot the Frenchman twiſe through, which at the firſt diſcharging of my broade ſide, ſunke downe right in the ſea, within one quarter of an hower. The gallies made all the haſt they could to recouer Caſt Cales, being a litle within the mouth of the harbour, but we had ſo fine a gale of winde, that we made two of them carie the third betweene them, and recouered againe one Argoſie laden with Candie wines, which was the barks prize but the gallies had recouered her, but nowe ſhe is in Plymouth and eight and fortie men in her, all Greekes, except two Portingales: ſhe is come but to a reaſonable market. And as concerning our Fleete, I hope we ſhall be in Portingale within this moneth at the furtheſt, where no doubt (God ayding vs) we ſhall make a wonderfull proſperous voyage, for they tremble at the ſight of three Engliſh ſhips, and are all in a mutenie, not knowing whether it were beſt to receaue the King againe or to withſtand our power: but I thinke they wil not honour vs ſo much as to let vs winne their countrey by the ſword. Thus meeting at ſea with the Barke Beare, bound for London, and

for that I do not know how ſoone I ſhall returne, I haue thought it my duetie to aduertiſe your worſhip of theſe newes, to whom I ſend a dozen of Spaniſh blades to diſpoſe at your pleaſure, committing your worſhip to th'Almighty. 
            
               From ſea this twelfth of March. 1588.
