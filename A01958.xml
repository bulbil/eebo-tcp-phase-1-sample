            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               ❧ TO THE MOST Rev. Father in God, GEORGE, by Diuine prouidence Archbiſhop of CANTERBVRIE; Primate and Metropolitan of all England: All ſauing graces. ⁂
            
               PLEASETH IT YOVR GRACE: There haue beene two arch-enemies that haue euer moleſted the Church in her periods of peace; the Heretique, and the Atheiſt. The firſt in matters of veritie, obducing a cloud, and ſpreading a curtaine of ignorance and error, before the eies of Gods people: the latter in things of pietie, withdrawing the cloud, and opening the vaile of maieſty and honour, to euery vulgar both hand and eie. Concerning the firſt, as requiring more of the head, I leaue to thoſe learned pens and ſelected ſoldiers, whom God hath endowed with greater meaſure of vnderſtanding to fight his battels. But for the ſecond, that aske more of the heart, I preſumed, with the poore widow in the Goſpel, to cast my mite into the donaries of God, to the vſe of the godly. A ſubiect I am well aſſured as neceſſarie, as diſtaſtfull for theſe times: For whether it be that gaine hath obturated mens eares, or guilt hath obdurated their hearts, I find abroad men much recalcitrant to this doctrine: yet how

needfull it is to be touched, I report me to Chriſtian hearts. But who am I, that I ſhould irritare crabrones; whoſe impudencie notwithſtanding, or ignorance, or importunitie, for ſo did ſuch vermin ſignifie in hyeroglophicall learning, if they prooue obſtreperous, I moſt humbly craue your Grace to protect me, if not from their buzzing, yet from their ſtinging. Whoſe height, beeing placed in the Zenith of this hemiſphere, albeit they cannot reach with hands of iniurie; yet I feare me, they will not forbeare to barke at with hearts of enuie. To your Grace therefore, in the behalfe of all this Church, I offer this ſimple Treatiſe: for whoſe vigilancie and indefatigableneſſe, as we thanke the Lord; ſo we pray him for your long continuance, and happy ſitting.
            
               Your Graces moſt humble ſeruiter,

            Deo &amp; Eccleſiae. D. D. THE ANATOMIE OF Ananias and Sapphiraes Sacriledge.
            
            
               ACTS. 5. 1.
               
                  
                     
                        Ver. 1. 
                     BVT there was a certaine man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, that ſold a poſſeſſion,
                  
                     2 And kept backe part of the price, and brought a certaine [ſmall] portion, and laid it downe at the Apoſtles feete, his wife alſo beeing priuie thereunto.
                  
                     3 Then ſaid Peter, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart, that thou ſhouldeſt lie to the holy Ghoſt, and keepe backe part of the price of the poſſeſſion?
                  
                     4 While it remained, was it not in thy power, and when it was ſold, was it not thine owne? why haſt thou conceiued this thing in thine heart? thou haſt not lied vnto man, but to God.
                  
                     5 When Ananias heard theſe words, hee fell downe and gaue vp the Ghoſt, and great feare came vpon all them that heard theſe things.

               The explication, firſt in the Logicall reſolution.
               
                  THE white horſe that went out at the opening of the firſt ſeale, Reuel. 6. 1.whoſe rider had a bow and a crowne, and made victorious Conqueſts, may ſeeme to bee that ſuadae medulla, the power of the Spirit in the lips of the Apoſtles, that ſo ſoone and ſuddenly wan ſuch worlds of ſoules to the obedience of the Goſpel; whoſe confluence and concourſe was not more conſpicuous for the companie, then prodigious for the Vnanimitie: where Platoes idea of perfect communitie, was really performed; and his excellent modell of true Vnanimitie was actually eſtabliſhed. For here indeede was Cor vnum &amp; anima vna: for ſaith S. Luke, Cap. 4 38.
                  The multitude of beleeuers were of one heart and minde, in ſo much as there was none that lacked: for ſuch as were poſſeſſors of lands and houſes ſold them, and laid downe the prices at the Apoſtles feete, and diſtribution was made according as euery one did need. So did other: ſo did Ioſes a Leuite, and for that cauſe was happily of the Apoſtles ſurnamed Barnabas, or the ſonne of conſolation, for comforting the hearts of the Church, who

as yet were but barely prouided for, perſecution being feared without, and penurie felt within her doores. But as he and other did beautifie the religion with their deuotion, ſo there want not that blemiſh the ſame with their deep diſſimulation. Therefore S. Luke to illuſtrate the fact of the one, oppoſeth ex diametro, the fault of the other, as Chryſoſtome obſerueth; to the ende, the diſſimulation of Ananias may giue a luſtre to the ſinceritie of Ioſes, and ſhewe the world, that there is a conſolation in Chriſt, 
                  Phil 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
                  a comfort of loue, a fellowſhip of the Spirit, and bowels of mercie, though profane men neither praiſe it, nor practiſe it. This the occaſion.
               Now here is ſet downe a wicked combination of a man and his wife, in a matter of Dedication, by themſelues done to God and his Church, how to delude and fruſtrate both: which counterfeit carriage, the great and holy Apoſtle, doth both deſcrie and diſcouer, firſt to their conuiction, ſecondly to their confuſion. Where firſt we may reade the ſinne, and then the cenſure. The ſinne is Sacriledge, that is, compilation or couſenage of things now conſecrated to God and holy vſes. The cenſure is Excommunication, or diſtriction of the ſpiritual ſword, and that in the heauieſt of all heauie curſes. The ſinne is ſet downe firſt barely by Luke, by way of hiſtoricall narration; the cenſure inflicted by Peter, by Apoſtolicall iuriſdiction; the hiſtorie is couched in the two firſt verſes, and compriſe the efficients, materiall, and formall cauſes. Ananias and his wife ſold a poſſeſſion, and kept backe part of the price, and

brought 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a certaine quillet or quidditie, a thing of nothing in compariſon of the maine, a niggardly ſhare; whereas they had promiſed the whole, as Barnabas had done before, and they made ſhewe to imitate.
               
                  
                     verſ 3. The cenſure followes; firſt, in reprehenſion; ſecondly, in caſtigation. The reproofe containes, 1. an accuſation, v. 3. 2. a confutation. The accuſation is in the appellation of the offender, Ananias; and enumeration of the parts of the offence, which are three; 1. The author by whoſe ſuggeſtion, Why hath Sathan filled thine heart? where is alſo touched part of the forme of the offence. 2. The obiect againſt whom the ſinne was committed, including alſo the other part of the forme; That thou ſhouldſt lie to the holy Ghoſt. 3. The ſubiect wherein the matter of the ſinne conſiſted, And keep backe part of the price of the poſſeſsion.
               
               
                  
                     verſ. 4. The Confutation followes, and that is of three ſecret obiections, anſwerable to the heads of the accuſation, but inuerting the order, as the manner of Scripture is to doe: to the laſt firſt.
               
                  Obiect. 1. A man may doe with his owne what he will; but this was mine: ergo. To this the Apoſtle anſwereth by letting paſſe the maior, as beeing impertinent, and denying the minor, with diſtinguiſhing vpon the time: firſt for time of poſſeſſion▪ granting it, when it remained (vnſold) remained it not to thee? namely, the land: ſecondly, and for time of alienation yeelding it, and when it was ſold, was it not in thine owne power? namely the price: thirdly, but for time

of dedication, denying it ſtrongly by interrogation, and paſſing it ouer by a crypſis of method, as if all law and logicke, all rule and reaſon, did diſavow it: for thou hadſt no more right to the monie now giuen, then to the land now ſold.
               
                  Obiect. 2. As to the author, he might ſay, if it were an offence, yet was it not mine but Satans, as your ſelfe auouch. To this he anſwers with a non ſequitur, though Sathans by temptation, yet yours alſo by approbation: he might haue as one noteth, ſuadendi aſtu
                        •
                     iam, not cogendi potentiam, he might ſuggeſt, hee could not enforce: he was the founder, the woer, the father; thy heart was the worker, the ſpouſe, the mother: why haſt thou conceiued this thing in thy heart?
               
               
                  Obiect. 3. Well then, though a fault, and in ſome ſort my fault alſo, yet no ſuch great fault as needed ſo ſharpe and publike reproofe; at the worſt, being but to a few ſimple men, that could challenge nothing of a free donation, and might haue receiued other ſatisfaction. Anſw. Yes, your ſinne is not ſo much to men, who are but the Aſſignes to whom the benefit of your donation ſhould haue acrued, as vnto God who is the donor; who by ſuch fraud is fruſtrated, and by your dodging diſhonoured: not onely the father that foundeth his Church in his Sonne, and the Sonne that collecteth it by his Spirit, but the holy Spirit that ſequeſtreth it by his power, ſanctifieth it with his grace, beautifieth it with his gifts, combineth it with his loue, preſerueth it by his prouidence, and honoureth it with his truth: Thou haſt not lied vnto man, but vnto God: euen God the holy Ghoſt.
               
                  
                  
                     verſ. 5. This is the reprehenſion, the Caſtigation follows: when Ananias found himſelfe firſt thus deprehended in the darkeneſſe of his owne deceit, like the fiſh Sepia, that miſteth her ſelfe in her owne mud, and reprehended for the blackneſſe of his ſinne, by the wiſedome of the Spirit, and peircing words of the Apoſtle: and laſtly, confuted in the ſimple Labyrinth of his owne Logicke, it remaines that hee is confounded by the inward remorſe of his couetous conſcience; and as at the hearing of his owne funerall ſermon, falls downe dead in the place, by the fulmination of the fearfulleſt anathema, anathema maran-atha, a temporall conſternation of the bodie, cut off from the grace of life, and eternall malediction of the ſoule, depriued of the life of grace, an exemplarie vengeance to other, a fearfull iudgement to himſelfe, by a ſad, a ſudden, and vnrepentant death: not ſo much in forme of words, as in the effect of deeds; When Ananias heard theſe words, he fell downe and gaue vp the ghoſt.
               
               Laſtly, the vſe of this curſe annexed, what effect it ſhould and did produce to other: trepidation and feare, illuſtrated by the extent or quantitie, both of the affection, and the ſubiect, or auditors; Great feare came vpon all them that heard theſe things. And thus much for the Context and analyſis, or logicall reſolution.

               The Theologicall tractation. Firſt, of his ſinne in generall, how great it was, and what.
               COncerning his ſinne, that it ſhould be proportionate to his puniſhment, all do not agree; the moſt auouch that it was Sacriledge, none ſay it was leſſe, but ſome ſay more, as namely that ſinne vnto death, the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt. I thinke it was both. Firſt, that his ſinne was Sacriledge, it is Firſt, Sacriledge.too apparent to be gaineſaid, as I am of opinion, although the learned Fulke vpon the Rhemiſh notes Fulke in locum.ſeemeth to denie it, as I take, in heate of diſpute. For the detaining or detracting of any thing dedicated to holy vſe, though dedicated but by mentall intention, hath beene defined to be ſacriledge, by ſuch as haue defined that ſinne; and ſo the ſtreame of auncient and moderne Diuines doth run generally that way: as thus, S. Auguſtine, 
                  De verbis Apoſt.
                  Ideo cito mortuus eſt Ananias, vt paterit quam magnum peccatum eſſet, quod oblatum eſt iterum retrahere: Ananias died ſuddenly, to ſhew how hainous a ſinne it is, to reuoke anything that is offered or dedicated to God. Chryſoſtome, 
                  in locum.
                  Vides quid hoc crimen imputatur, eo quòd pecunias ſuas accepit quas conſecrârat: thou ſeeſt how he is charged with a crime for taking away his monies which he had conſecrated or hallowed. And a little after, Sacrilegium enim valde graue &amp; magno contemptu plenum: for ſacriledge is a very grieuous ſinne, and full of great contempt. S. Ambroſe,

                     trahit, ſacrilegij ſimul accuſatur &amp; fraudis: for defaulting a moitie of that which he had promiſed to God, he is charged with ſacriledge and fraud. So the old. Calvin, 
                  in locum
                  Sacrilega fraudatio quod partem eius ſubducit quod ſacrum eſſe profitebatur: it was ſacrilegious iugling to diminiſh that which he profeſſed holy. Aretius, 
                  in locum.
                  Furtum fuiſſet in re propria, fraude retinere quod ſimulat publicare: it had beene ſtealth or ordinary theft in his proper and priuate goods, fraudulently to hold backe what he made ſhow to make common: Ergo, this was ſacriledge. Beza, 
                  in annot.
                  Cum totum pretium deo conſecraſſet, post per ſacrilegium partem ſeparabat: hauing vowed the whole, he ſubtracts a part to his owne vſe. So the new.
               Now to define Sacriledge, hiſtorians vſe the word diuerſly: for noting this ſiune to be both hainous and odious, therefore they call all hainous and hatefull ſinnes by the name: as ſorcerie, murder, violation of parents, trucidation of Princes, and whatſoeuer engendreth publique deteſtation and ſlaunder.
               But indeed the word in proper ſignification hath reſpect to God, whether by derogation of his glory, or violation of his law, or oppoſition of his truth, or vſurpation of his titles, or prophanation of his Temples, or vilification of his ſeruice, or diminution of his reuenewes and things dedicated to his honour. The Etymologiſts of both Tongues, deriue it from ſtealing

                   and ſacrilegus doe import.
               
                  
Therefore, 1. the heathen defined it from robbing of the heathen temples: 2. the Chriſtian Ciuilians from Chriſtian Churches: 3. our common lawyers, ſet out the force of the word, by the fellonious intent, rather then the ſubdolous manner, whether of ſecret lurching, or open purloyning: 4. Diuines both ſchoole and reformed, quicquid fit ad irreverentiam ſacrae rei: as 2. 2. q. 99.

                  ablatio rei ſacrae: derogation of holineſſe, abuſe, or lurching things deputed to holy vſes. Therefore Innocentius, more by way of alluſion, then true notation, ſaies that ſacrilegium is ſacriledium, any ſuch abuſe whereby God or his religion is preiudiced and depraued.
               Whoſoeuer therefore taketh away, or alienateth to other perſons or vſes, goods or things (chattels our Lawyers call them) of the Church, that haue been giuen to maintaine Gods Church and ſeruice, the Canoniſts ſay doth incurre ipſo facto, crimen laeſae Maieſtatis, that is, ſacriledge or treaſon to the higheſt Maieſty: and as high treaſon to the King is the higheſt degree of a ſubiects enormitie, ſo in proportion is ſacriledge to God: but in Ananias this is ioyned with a higher, whereby his ſinne is out of meaſure ſinfull.
               
                  Secondly, the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt. This ſeemes to me alſo to be very plaine: firſt, by the literall oneration of S. Peter in the third verſe, lying to the holy Ghoſt: where the verie nomination of that perſon of the Trinitie, who guided and gouerned as preſent and preſident, this whole buſineſſe, doth inſinuate no leſſe. For who doth work the miracles,

but the holy Ghoſt? who doth reueale the Donors moſt intimate intentions, but the holy Ghoſt? who doth kill with the word of his mouth dthe incorrigible ſinner, but the holy Ghoſt? who doth ſo powerfully congregate ſo many thouſands by ethe mouth of ideot-fiſhers, but the holy Ghoſt? who doth ſegregate this goat from the bleſſed flocke, for infecting further, but the holy Ghoſt? therefore the holy Ghoſt particularly is, and peremptorily affirmes himſelfe to be aimed at in this buſineſſe of holineſſe: therefore the ſinne againſt that perſon, is that ſinne, the ſinne of the holy Ghoſt. And hereunto the holy Fathers alſo accord: as Heſychius,

               The ſame alſo doth Aretius affirme, alleadging another interpretation of thoſe words, (why haſt thou lied to the holy Ghoſt: mentiens ſpiritum ſanctum; i. fingens ſe habere ſpiritum ſanctum: belying the holy Ghoſt,

that is, ſaying that he had the holy Ghoſt,) but reiecting it, and cleauing to that conſtruction, contra ſpiritum ſanctum, againſt the holy Ghoſt, that it was the ſinne of the holy Ghoſt. And that which puts it out of queſtion, M. Calvin 
                  in locum., in ſaying Ananias ſinne was ſacriledge, prooues it thus that we now ſpeake of: for as it hath been obſerued by learnedſt writers, That ſinne is no one ſingle ſinne, but aggregativum

                     tiae ſupernae: 1. wilfull reſiſting of knowne truth, 2. enuious hindering the heauenly grace: all which are not obſcure in Ananias. As for example, 1. He knewe that God did knowe

his doubling, yet is not afraid ſaith Calvin to practiſe the ſame. 2. Whereas S. Peter did preach the hainouſnes of his ſinne vnto him, hee had a heart that could not repent, and therfore vnfaithfull to lay hold on the mercy of Chriſt. 3. He was ſo farre from repenting, that he grew harder, purpoſing to die, and dying in his purpoſe of non repentance. 5. He loued his goods more then goodneſſe or good men. 6. Reſolued that no man ſhould bee ſaued by his helpe. Theſe things in briefe may ſerue to ſhewe, that the ſinne of Ananias was both Sacriledge, and more: which yet ſhall be more fully declared in an other Cap. 4.place, where wee ſhall more particularly vnfold the ſeuerall properties of his ſinne. So much in generall of his ſinne.
            
            
               CHAP. III.
               In particular. 1. Reprehenſion of the man by compellation or perſonall rowſing.
               ALthough that theſe delinquents had ſeene and heard enough in the ſermons of the Apoſtles, and exerciſes of the Congregation, to haue inſtructed them in the power and iuſtice of God, and haue called them away from halting betweene couetouſneſſe and godlineſſe; yet ſuch is the fooliſhneſſe of ſinne, and blindneſſe of ſinners, till God commeth home cloſe vnto them, that they will neuer beleeue that God either ſees or diſlikes them: and therefore the holy Spirit takes ſuch a courſe in this place, as is

fitteſt to rowze vp a ſinner, ſitting in his chaire, and ſleeping his nappe vpon his couch or cuſhion of ſecuritie, as his conſcience may be ſooneſt conuinced, and his ſtate eaſieſt recouered: and that is by ſingling him out particularly, by his name and nature, that hee cannot ſhift the notice that is taken of him. It is ſmall queſtion but hee knewe his owne name, which in him, as in all other in thoſe times, was ſignificant: 1. humbled, 2. afflicted, 3. anſwered by God; ſo ſaith Aretius doth Ananias import. 1. His ambitious deſire of credit, beeing loath to be at the coſt, was to be humbled. 2. His euill heart and worſe eye, enuying the Apoſtles any maintenance, or the Conuerts any ſuſtenance, was to be afflicted. 3. His corrupt and cankred manners was to receiue ſuch anſwer from God as they moſt deſerued. This becauſe he himſelfe would not remember, his loue to monie hauing raced his owne name, like an other Cervinus out of his minde, the holy Ghoſt doth rubbe his memorie of, reducing all theſe notions vnto his remembrance, by ſtriking this ſtring, and ſounding that name to his vnderſtanding. The officers of the Inquiſition, when they ſuſpect a party, and cannot probably conuince his concealing, they will ſuddenly pronounce his ſurmiſed name, and obſerue how hee is affected at that ſound; by which ſtratageme they haue come to the cognizance of notable diſguiſers, which they might haue deſpaired any other way to haue wonne. Which courſe God ſeemeth oft-times to take with men, not that any can ſo halt before him, as to goe vnknowne, but becauſe by ſo particular a

courſe he would bring them both to knowe themſelues, and alſo to know that he doth knowe them▪ ſo did he to the protoplaſt, Gen. 3. 9.
                  Adam, where art thou? and his eldeſt ſonne Caine, 
                  Gen. 4. 9.
                  where is thy brother Abel? and the mother of Iſmael, 
                  Gen. 16. 8.
                  Hagar Saraes maide what doeſt thou here?
               
               The reaſon hereof Dauid ſeemeth to touch, Pſalm. 10. 13.
                  Sinners doe flatter themſelues in their wickednes, till their abhominable ſinne be found out: and euer ſince Adam was driuen to his ſhifts in paradiſe, he will finde ſome fig-leafe to couer his nakedneſſe, and with that ſiely, hide his head in a crowde, ſaying, in populo magno non agnoſcar, the throng ſhall hide me: and is there knowledge in the moſt higheſt? Therefore doth God go very particularly to worke, as in the lot of Ion. 1.

The lots are caſt into the lap, and the tribe of Iudah is taken; here Achan, vnquiet before, begins to ſtartle now, yet hope of impunitie hardens him ſo, as he will confeſſe nothing: a ſecond draught of the familie of Zarites, frees the reſt of Iudah, as the lotterie of Iudah had ſecured the other tribes: now the man beginnes to change countenance, and purpoſes ſome-deale to ſaue all labour, and confeſſe of himſelfe: but becauſe he lingers, the third draught finds the houſe of Zabdi,
                  
then he falls to quake and tremble, ſo that all men that ſaw him, might reade his fault in his face: and while he is aſtonied between paſſion and purpoſe, he heares himſelfe to bee named, when loe, hee falls downe and ſinkes vnder his ſorrow; and if it were to begin againe, he would ſtay the ſearch, and yeeld himſelfe priſoner. Why did he not that ſooner? If we would iudge our ſelues, 
                  1. Cor. 11. 32.
                  we ſhould not be iudged: nowe when we are iudged, we are chaſtiſed of the Lord, that wee ſhould not be condemned with the world. And thus doth Peter in this place, not onely to point at, but to paint out a double dealer: who had he any ſparke of grace, had preuented iudgement, and cut off by timely confeſſion, ſo fearefull a condemnation. But nothing would ſerue to wring his vnhappy purchaſe out of his fingers; ſo hunger of bootie, and hope of impunitie, betray moſt men: who were we well aſſured, we ſhould one day be called to perſonall account, we would neuer for ſo miſerable pleaſance, buy at ſo deere a rate ſo certen repentance. Sinnes are debts, and debts are as ſonnes, who growe ſo well, that they will crie after vs, and owne vs by our name, if we ſtay them not within, or ſtoppe not their mouth without. As the ſtaffe and the ring did challenge Gen. 38. 13.Iuda, ſo we ſhall be bewrayed by the ſame token, if in time we take not vp the matter, with a lambe or a kidde of the fold, by the hand of our friend the good Adullamite: and ſo much of the Apoſtrophe, or Compellation.

               Reprehenſion of the matter, or enumeration of the parts of the offence, which are 1. the author, 2. obiect, and 3. ſubiect.
               ALthough in the 2. Chapter I laid downe his ſinne in ſome generalitie, by way of explication, yet now order leadeth vs by the hand of the text, to vnfold the branches ſomewhat more particularly, by way of demonſtration, not as hunting out the hainouſneſſe thereof in any one arme or diuiſion thereof, but ſhewing the forme and materialls in the whole ioyntly together. The firſt part therefore is the author, and prime moouer, which is here by the Apoſtle ſaid to be Satan.
               
               
                  1. The author, Satan. Now although the Prince of darkeneſſe doth worke in all the children of diſobedience, and the deuill hath his hand in euery ſinne, yet it is not vſuall to name or mention him, but in ſome very notorious and greatly outragious; as in that of Iudas Ioh. 13. 17., that the Deuill entred into him: and of Elymas Act. 13. 10., that he was the child of the Deuill: and of Antichriſt 2. Theſ. 2. 9., that his comming is with the effectuall working of the Deuill: and in the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, when the horrible heretike Cerinthus 
                  Euſeb.greeted Saint Iohn the Apoſtle and Euangeliſt, with non noſti nos? knowe you not mee? receiued this anſwer, noui te primogenitum diaboli, yes, I know you to be the deuills eldeſt ſonne. So that as the Poets in inextricable exigencies, do bring down

Iupiter vpon the ſtage, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , by a deuiſe or engine: ſo doth God in matters that paſſe the ordinarie pitch, bring in Sathan to ſhew the tranſcendencie of the ſault.
               We are then to know, for the fountaine of ſinne, that there are cogitationes immiſſae, Satans iaculations, and cogitationes aſcendentes, humane ebullitions: this of Ananias is mixt of both, as appeares in the next words, where repeating the ſame matter he alters the phraſe, ſaying, why haſt thou conceiued this thing in thy heart? ſo that both Satan did fill his heart, and his heart conceiued it; Satan by inticing, moouing, perſwading; he by conſenting, yeelding, obeying: Satan by caſting in his fierie darts of temptation, he by blowing theſe coales of deſtruction. By the enuy of the deuill (ſaith Syracides)

                  ariſe euill thoughts, murders, adulteries, thefts, &amp;c.
               Wherefore, as Satan entred into Iudas, Auguſt.
                  non tam vt tentaret, quàm vt poſſideret, not ſo much to tempt him, as to poſſeſſe him: non vt alienum, ſed vt proprium, not as a ſtranger, but as his peculiar: nec tam vt poſſideret, quàm vt tranſformaret, not ſo much to poſſeſſe him, as transforme him: whereupon our Sauiour Ioh. 6. 70.ſaid, haue not I choſen you twelue, and one is a deuill? ſo he tempted, poſſeſſed, transformed Ananias, with an extraordinarie temptation, a ſouraigne domination, an vniuerſall tranſmutation: ſo that as Iudas was a traytor before he did betray, (as our Sauiour inſinuates) quod 
                  Ioh. 23. 27.
                  facis, (in the preſent tenſe) fac citò; for beeing ſo wholly ſet vpon it, with head, and heart,

and hand, that had his heads beene as many as Cerberus, or the whore of Babylon; and his hands as many as Briareus, or any King of whom it is ſaid, An niſcis multas regibus eſſe manus? he would haue ſet them all on worke; ſo full he was vp to the top, non

                     am facit peccatum, ſed eſt peccatum 
                  Auguſt.: it was too ſmall a predication to ſay he did ſinne; for he was conuerted into ſinne, hee was nothing but ſinne. And yet this was but one halfe of his ſinne, that he left no place for God, no place for goodneſſe, Satan had taken vp all the roomes in his heart, as interpreters do obſerue. And all this is but his ſtampe of one ſide, whoſe man he was, and whom hee entertained. Come to the other ſide, whom he (I will not ſay) kept out, but draue out, his ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt; the ſecond part of the ſinne.

                  his enemies ſhall lie vnto him, ſpeaking both of the type, himſelfe or his ſonne, and the Meſſias, to note the hypocriſie and falſe-heartednes of his vanquiſhed ſubiects: and againe of the like, Pſal. 81. 15.
                  they ſhould haue beene found liers vnto him, that is, they ſhould humble themſelues with falſe obedience and forged ſubmiſſion: yet as we haue noted, Cap. 2. very learned Expoſitors, beſides the aduantage of the letter, haue taken it for that irremiſſible blafphemie, that is directed againſt the third perſon in Trinitie, not of ignorance, or of infirmity, as to the ſonne, and the Father; but of malice to the fountaine and author of holines; which as the ſchoolemen ſay, Thomas.

               Now if we looke when or wherein this ſinne by him was committed, we finde nothing but this fact, for which he was tainted or touched; then this verie ſinne, quatenus, he promiſed ſuch goods to the author of holineſſe, to be a helpe and meanes to propagate holineſſe, as it concerned the perſon cui, was blaſphemie, beeing fruſtrated and falſified in the effect: as it conſidered the thing in quo, the detenſion of that which was ſo deuoted, was ſacriledge: which is the third branch of his ſinne, now comming in order to be touched, or the circa quod.
               
               
                  3. Subiect wherin. Wherein we muſt now no more ſet our eie vpon the partie, to whom the origination and procuration of holineſſe doth pertaine (the laſt thing which we conſidered) but the materialls of holineſſe, or the things ſanctified and ſeparate for holy ſeruice themſelues; of the fellonious diminiſhing whereof Ananiis here charged, as we ſaw before: and it is ſeuerally ſet downe in the next words, by a diſiunctiue coniunction, thus, and keep backe part of the price of the poſſeſſion.
               
               Wherein beſide his impious legier-de-maine, that Ficta oblatione Deum &amp; Eccleſiam fallere vouit,
                  
ſaith Calvin, by a falſe ſhew of a bountifull heart, hee went about to gull both God and his Church; we obſerue his fowle prophanation of a faire conſtitution, for it was now a voluntarie graunt or a cuſtomarie practiſe, receiued for law in that litle commonwealth, that ſuch as had ſhould improoue their loue to the higheſt linke; when he like Ionas worme doth blaſt the honour of God, the vſe of goods, his owne deuotion, and others ſuſtentation, with one caſt of hypocriſie.
               I will not mention his fooliſh ambition, that for a ſmall aire of humane applauſe, he could be content to forfeit his reward in heauen: nor his Paganiſh incredulitie, that thought God either would not in ſo many coufluences of Proſelytes, or could not in ſo great incumbrances of oppoſites, maintaine his Church; and therefore thought to haue more hold of his hand, then he had of his tongue.
               Theſe be the parts of his ſinne ſeuerally laid open in themſelues, and yet in ſuch reciprocall aſpect and poſition one to another, that they touch and take eſſence and efficacie one from another: for the fulneſſe of Satan argues, his totall and finall apoſtacie from God; and his ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, confirmes his ſacriledge to the holy Church; and laſtly, his enuying and ſpoyling the holy Church, prooueth his compleate deuilliſhneſſe. Of which particulars before we collect the totall ſumme, let vs gather ſuch vſes of theſe points as lie ſcattered in our way, that both our path may be the ſmoother, and our prouiſion for the reſt of our paſſage the better.
               
                  
Firſt, then we here obſerue the truth of thoſe words of Salomon, 
                  Pro. 22. 15. Sinne is folly.
                  That follie is bound vp in the heart of the child: that is, that we are all both naturally and habitually addicted to all kind of ſinnes, as hauing Satan to our father, and an irreligious and corrupt fountain for our mother. And this folly is no other, but in which ſenſe thoſe two words are equipollent, beeing termini convertibiles: onely the difference is this; the one hath relation to the head, as principium laeſum; the other to the hand, as organum corruptum; and therefore we are no leſſe indangered by ill thoughts, then preiudiced by ill deeds. Men commonly thinke that thought is free, and ſo it is in ſome ſence, in ciuilitie, becauſe the Magiſtrate takes no notice of them, vnleſſe manifeſted with outward proofes; not in diuinitie to thinke what we liſt in regard of God: for he is ſcrutator 
                  Heb. 4. 13.
                  cordium, a trier of the hearts and reines; and euill thoughts eat out the heart of religion: therefore Salomon 
                  Eccl. 10, 20.counſels, not to curſe the King ſo much as in thought: and Peter Act. 8. 12.bids Simon Magus, pray that his thought might be forgiuen him: for the very thoughts Prou. 15. 26.of the wicked, are abomination to the Lord: the tranſgreſſion of the euill angels was but in thought, and oftenne Lawes, there is one to reform the cogitations.
               Secondly, Abyſſus abyſſum vocat, ſaith the Prophet, one depth calleth another; which is no leſſe true of the inundation of ſinne, then of the ſeas: for by cuſtome of ſinne, and delighting in a tenor of diſguiſing, we bring our ſelues to that paſſe, that all the balme in Gilead will not cure vs: too much dallying

                  Sozom. with ſinne, brings to the deadly ſinne. Iulian did baniſh grace ſo long, donec omnino gratia ſpoliabitur when we beginne with impietie, and goe on with hypocriſie, we commonly end with apoſtaſie. Sampſon played ſo long with Dalila mock-holiday, that in the end his locks were ſhauen in good earneſt. The loſſe of greateſt Iuſtin.peices comes by the leaſt breach vneſpied, or vnrepaired. Ninus victories were not onely gainefull for the preſent, but vſefull for the future, ſequentium etiam cauſae, the meanes of more; ſo is it in ſinne, it hath not onely lapſum, but reatum; beſides the illneſſe of the fall, it leaues a proneneſſe to fall further: therfore rightly and obſeruantly called by the Apoſtle, deceitfulneſſe of ſinne: for beſides the harme that is in view, there is more danger in that which is concealed.
               Sinnes are ſores, firſt but vitious humours, then they growe to angrie tumours, and after they turne to burning vlcers, within a while to eating cankers, and laſt of all to incurable tortors, not onely morbus, but mors animae, as Bernard ſaith. Therefore let vs not Eſay. 5. 18.drawe ſinne with cords of vanitie, nor tranſgreſſion with cart-ropes. Cables or cart-ropes were firſt threds, then cords, laſt cables: ſo is the twiſting of ſinne: 1. againſt knowledge: 2. againſt conſcience: 3. againſt the ſtrongeſt, not motions onely, but reclamations alſo of Gods Spirit. Malice againſt any men is hainous, againſt holy men dangerous, againſt God and holines damnable. Let that alwaies be our praier, Pſal. 19. vlt.
                  Keepe vs, O Lord, from preſumptuous ſinnes, ſo ſhall we be innocent from much offence, from this offence. And

ſo much of the enumeration of the ſeuerall braunches of his ſinne.
            
            
               CHAP. V.
               The aggrauation of the ſinne of Sacriledge.
               NOW then to ſumme vp all that hath been ſaid:  for as much as Satan is here mentioned in this matter, and that as no idle ſpectator, but a buſie actor, and ſo buſie as not to ſend any ſmall troopes, or lend little helpe, but to repleniſh with the fulneſſe of his iniquitie the whole heart of this peccant partie; it is giuen vs to vnderſtand, that Sacriledge is no ſmall defection, or tranſgreſſion, but an entire deſertion of Gods ſpirit, and ſolide intereſt of Satan in the child of perdition: for as, de quo vis ligno non fit Mercurius, euery logge will not make a Mercuriall; ſo de quo vis luto non fit Sacrilegus, euery mould will not ſerue for Sacriledge. We may well ſet downe, that this is a foule, a fearefull, a fundamentall ſinne, not razing the skin of Chriſts ſcalpe, like the Iewes crowne of thornes, but renting the ſides of Chriſtianitie, like the ſouldiers ſpeare, as we reade in the Goſpell. For which cauſe the Canoniſts were wont to allot Burchard.ſeauen yeares penance vnto it, as Ivo, Burchardus, Gratian, and the reſt agree; where ſo many daies ſufficed other ſinnes.
               
                   Whereas this ſinne is ſo gloriouſly attended, not  onely with a deuill, but ſo great a deuill, as the ſinne

that is irremiſſible, the ſinne vnto death, the blaſphemie of the holy Ghoſt; wee haue a faire aime to deſcrie the ſinfulneſſe of Sacriledge by the old rule, that teacheth, noſcitur exſocio qui non dignoſcitur exſe, 
                  Eccl. 9.a mans gate, his countenance, his companie, will ſoone ſhew what he is.
               Now here hee goes hand in hand with a hea
                     •
                  ie ſinne, and if they ſhould conteſt for prioritie, hath here the precedence, as carrying the denomination: therefore of force we muſt confeſſe that it is very Rom. 1. 22.hainous. In Paul he marcheth in equipage with a high ſinne, the ſinne of idolatrie; and of Idolatry Druſ.the Iewes haue a Prouerbe, Idololatra totam legem abnegat, the idolater diſanuls the whole Lawe: the like then muſt Sacriledge, beeing of the ſame ſize and latitude, renounce the whole law: not onely Iam. 2. 20.as S. Iames ſaith, he that offends in one commaundement is guiltie of all, but becauſe all the ſecond table depends vpon the firſt, and all the commaundements vpon the foremoſt; and therefore reſemble Hippocrates twins, laugh and weepe, liue and die, ſtand and fall, with equall ſimpathie.
               
                  Blat. 10. de leg. For firſt the diuine Plato, in thoſe excellent books concerning lawes, hauing in the former touched the violation of ſacred perſons, comming in the tenth to ſpeake in excellent method of ſacred things, auerreth expreſſely thus much of the ſacrileger, that hee muſt needs perſwade himſelfe one of theſe three things, 1. that there is no God at all, 2. or if there be, yet that he is nothing ſo iuſt and terrible to his oppugners as the world is made beleeue, 3. or at the leaſt,

that hee is very facile and flexible to be reappeaſed, when by ſacrilegers he is abuſed: euery of which do raze the foundation of all religion.
               So that theſe men aime at no lower leuell then God himſelfe, and are therefore thoſe preſumptuous gyants, that by antiquitie were ſaid to mutinie againſt heauen; becauſe as they know no goodneſſe, ſo they would acknowledge no God: and beeing enforced to that neceſſitie, enuie him all ſeruice and ſeruants. And therefore it is well obſerued of an heathen writer, Soli ſacrilegi pugnant contra Deum, it is no Q. Cur. lib. 7.other then your ſacrileger that wars with God, and make rampiers againſt his Maieſtie. Thus then Plato hath ſoundly concluded all ſacrilegers to be verie Atheiſts: for albeit they do not totidem verbis, in direct Pſal. 14. 1termes, denie there is a God with Dauids foole, and thoſe abiects of the forlorne hope; yet doe they the ſame indirectly, and by neceſſarie conſequence, when they deifie a falſe, or idolize the true God: which is by denying his eſſentiall attributes, and diuine properties. As, 1. of holineſſe, with ſuch as do thinke him like themſelues; that is, a God that delighteth

deum, oppoſite to God in point blanke; whoſe reaſons are moſt reaſonable, becauſe it can proceed from nothing but open contempt of holineſſe, and plaine impietie: for els why doe men lay theeuiſh fingers vpon things conſecrated to religion, but becauſe they care not for religion: or whereto tends the ſpoile of holy things, but to the ouerthrowe of holineſſe? for men knowe this, God cannot be ſerued without men, nor men bee maintained without meanes: therefore the ſubſtracting ſuch meanes, is the diſappointing ſuch ſeruice: therefore Zanchius reduceth Sacriledge to the ſecond commaundement, where Gods ſeruice is eſtabliſhed and prouided.

               HItherto we haue ſeene his ſinne, which we may truely pronounce to haue been a ſinne of ſins: now followes his puniſhment, and that well proportionate, a curſe of curſes: anathema euen maranatha, the moſt high, the moſt heauie, the moſt horrible of all degrees of eccleſiaſticall cenſure: for that it was an eccleſiaſticall cenſure, the whole ſeries or order of the cauſes doe euince. 1. the efficients both principall and inſtrumentall: 2. the forme of ſpirituall or eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction: 3. the matter, execration or extirpation: 4. the ende, that other may feare.
               Now then for our better vnderſtanding both of his ſinne, and of his ſuffering, the learned Druſius

                      1. qu. 9.doth teach vs, that among the Iewes where this fell

out, there were three ſorts or ſeuerall degrees of Church cenſure, apparant enough in both Teſtaments. 1. Called niddui of nadah, a word that ſignifies, expellere or elongare, to expell or driue far away: this we haue in Eſay, Heare yee the word of the Lord, all yee that tremble at his word: your brethren that hated you, and caſt you out for my names ſake, ſaid, Let the Lord bee glorified, (that was the forme as we ſee in Achans ſtory) Ioſ. 7. 30.
                  but he will appeare to your glorie, and they ſhall be aſhamed. And this is that which in the newe Teſtament is called, caſting out of the Synagogue, as the Phariſies ſerued the blind man whom Chriſt had healed, hauing Ioh. 9. 35.made a Canon, that whoſoeuer ſhould confeſſe Ieſus to be Chriſt, ſhould be excommunicate, or caſt out of the Church.
               
               
                  charam. 2. The ſecond was Cherem, of the roote that ſignifies occidere or excidere, to kill or cut off: this we finde Deut. 7. 2.in Moſes, where God ſpeaking of the curſed nations, whom his people were to exterminate, and poſſeſſe their places, ſaies thus, as the vulgar tranſlation doth well deliuer it, anathematizando anathematizabis eos; the Engliſh, if not ſo ſignificantly, yet as effectually, thou ſhalt vtterly deſtroy, or roote them out. And this S. Paul had reſpect vnto, when he ſaid, I would to God

                  they were cut off that trouble you; and where bee would haue the inceſtuous Corinthian committed to Sathan. 1. Cor. 5. 5.
               
               3. The laſt was that which the Iewes call Sammatha, or Sammatizatio of Shamam, that ſignifies deſolare, &amp; ad ſtuporem vaſtare: &amp; atta, tu, q. d. let ſuch a curſe fall vpon thee, as is vltima execratio or maledictio,

                  deplored, Ier. 12. 11. This S. Paul as I ſaid before did expreſſe in that imprecation or denuntiation of a moſt zealous heart, Who ſo loues not (that is, hateth and perſecuteth) the Lord Ieſus, let him be anathema maranatha, euerlaſtingly accurſed, q. d. till the comming of the Lord to iudgement, and a day after. And theſe were the Church cenſures.
               Now are we to examine, for as much as it is vndeniable but this of Ananias is ſuch, which of all theſe three it is, that is here inflicted. Firſt, of a certaine not the firſt, for that was but a depriuation of the ſpirituall eſtate for a time, concerning the companie and comforts of the Church, with condition annexed of reconciliation and repentance: now this here was corporall, as well as ſpirituall and eternall; with a barre againſt repentance, therefore not that.
               Secondly, nor the ſecond, which as ſome thinke either was not corporall, ſuch as the ciuill ſword could inflict; but a permiſſion or emancipation onelie to the power and regiment of Satan, who hath his kingdom out of the Church, to whō ſuch ſinners were deliuered ouer, to the end that the fleſh (that is,

                     . Cor. 5. 5.the old man) might be mortified, and the new renewed: or as Auguſtine ſpeaketh, vt moriatur error, viuat homo,
                  
that the ſinne might be killed, and the ſinner ſaued. Or if a corporall alſo, as we muſt confeſſe of Achan, the Cananites, and other, vpon whom that curſe was corporally executed on earth vpon their bodies, which was pronounced and enacted in heauen; yet but corporall, hauing time and meanes of grace offered for repentance. Therefore it muſt be the laſt, partaking of both, but exceeding both ſo far as extreame doth goe beyond partiall, and eternall ſutmounts temporall. 1. a temporall and extemporall cutting off the bodie from the grace of life, and a ſpirituall and eternall cutting off the ſoule from the life of grace: the ſoreſt, ſeuereſt, extreameſt vengeance, that can be afflicted on a man in this world; forſaking and forſaken of God. A ſudden and vnrepentant diſſolution of bodie and ſoule; a preſent and immediate manumiſſion from God and grace, to the place and torments of the damned, a iuſt guerdon for him that gaue himſelfe ouer to the full ſway of the Prince of death, to mocke that God of heauen, defeat his ſpouſe on earth, &amp; blaſpheme the ſpirit of ſanctification. I tremble to thinke; that any child of man, ſpecially a child of the Church, an auditor of the Apoſtles, a profeſſor of Chriſt, a benefactor of the Church, no apparant profeſſed enemy or atheiſt, or perſecutor, or apoſtata, ſhould be liable to ſo execrable a ſentence to be excommunicated, anathematized, ſammatized for grudging a few pence or pownds to God and his Church. But leauing ſecret iudgements vnto God, wee muſt needs acknowledge, that God ſeeth not as man ſeeth, for that which

mans eie could not perceiue, the eies of God that peirce the heart, did ſee in his carriage a mal

                  tio us, and obſtinate, a preſumptuous and deſperate, hypocriticall perſecutor, and enuious Apoſtata: the eſſentiall marks of a certaine, reprobate, and forlorne ſinner. If any yet beſide the exigence of the fault, will needes require more reaſon for ſo great ſeueritie, for their further ſatisfaction may lift off their eies from looking vpon S. Peter, as if he either of his owne Act. 3.power, or his priuate humour had ſlaine the partie, and remember it was the holy ſpirit, that in defect of temporall magiſtracie, (not yet Chriſtian) did moderate the whole matter: whoſe wiſedome ſo far as we either may or can looke into, might commend theſe reaſons: 1. the Church was to be kept in awe and feare of God: 2. as in a newe eſtabliſhed polity or gouernement, as there muſt bee examples of reward for the righteous, ſo alſo of puniſhments for delinquents: 3. that vnder the colour of religion and new conuerſion, one ſhould not defeat or defraud another: 4. it was requiſite, that the authoritie of the Church ſhould be wrought among them without, and they prepared by ſuch exemplarie iuſtice to like, and loue her gouernement. Theſe and ſuch like, which Calvin and expoſitors doe alleadge, may ſerue to ſtoppe any curious mouth, that will haue God to giue account of his iudgements.
               Here then are we taught firſt of all, of the wonderfull effect, and ſupereminent power of the word of God, in the mouth of his holy Apoſtles, and faithfull miniſters, not onely and alwaies ſeruing in caſes

of edification, but ſometimes alſo for deſtruction; albeit  that very deſtruction alſo of his enemies, tends to the edification of his children. And theſe are thoſe 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , works of power, mentioned by 1. Cor. 12. 10the Apoſtle; and

                  , the ſword of the Eph. 6. 20.ſpirit, to hack and hewe the vngodly in peices; and

Whereby we ſee the Church cenſures are no bruta fulmina, little childrens pot-guns, beadles and boltles artilleries; but tearing and roaring Cannons; nor left to the ſwaying of Peter alone, much leſſe to that man of Rome, to brandiſh not ſo much againſt ſinnes as Soueraignes: but left in truſt to all the true Miniſters of the Goſpel.
               Neither is it without neede, that there ſhould be ſuch rods and ſwords in the Church of God, for ſuch as are ſo audaciouſly inſolent, bad by ſelfe impietie, but much worſe by our impunitie. To the end therfore that the wicked may be corrected, the exorbitant

For which the heathen in their hieroglyphicks diſciphered Iupiter by an eie and an eagle; to inſinuate that ſuch a nature beſeemed the

higheſt maieſtie, as was not deceiueable by any obſcuritie.
               The conſideration of which point may ſerue to diſrobe vs of all Adams fig-leaues, and bereaue vs of all hope of impunitie, in our ſecreteſt villanies, and moſt inveloped treacheries. Eraſmus brings in a paire of amorous pigeons, looking for ſome very retired roome where they might renew their lewd acquaintance, but neuer could ſo be couered in any corner, that the eies of God ſhould not deſcrie them. Therefore in that deſcription of him in the viſion, Reu. 1. 14.his eies are ſaid to be as a flaming fire, that is, eies for obſeruing, ſire for reuenging: according to the Poet, Eurip.

flames of luſt againſt nature.

I end this point with a ſpeach of Auguſtine, fitting both Ananias and vs: Dum altenum

               And ſo I come more particularly to note the ſeueritie  of God againſt ſacriledge: for in the extermination The vengeance of God againſt Sacrilegers.of theſe two, we are plainely giuen to vnderſtand, what guerdon they are euer to expect, that violate the ſacred reuenues of God; a feareful expectation of extreameſt vengeance both of bodie and ſoule: a conſideration able to ſtrike vs through with horrour and amazement, if our hearts were not harder then the neather mill-ſtone. If any ſhall doubt of that I ſay, and mocke at my words, as ſpeaking for our owne particular, and pleading for our owne profit; let him turne backe a few leaues, and conſider the true reaſons hereof; both in the ſecond chapter, where in generall we did explicate his ſin, and in the fourth chap. where in particular, we handled the members and branches of his ſacriledge.
               Wherefore I proceede and ſay, that there was neuer any rob-God, that imbarked themſelues in this

impietie, but he ran a courſe of endles infamie, and vtmoſt extreamitie.

To beginne with the verie beginning, Caine the Generall of this damned crewe, if his world of miſerie was not ſolie for this, yet I dare avouch it was from this, that he liued a proiected runnagate, and died a reiected reprobate: of whom the fathers obſerue this, that hee offended if not in the quantitie of his oblation, yet in the qualitie thereof; declaring by the courſneſſe of that hee offered, the abiectnes of his eſteeme of him to whom he offered, the refuſe of his crop, and linings of his corne. Which impietie of his vnto his Creator, was firſt puniſhed with vnnaturall inhumanitie to his brother; and that againe with obdurate impenitencie vnto God, till altogether they brewed him a loathſome extraction of a hatefull life, and a deſperate procuration of a curſed death.

Fearfull comminations; there came a man of God to expoſtulate with Elie, and to denunciate his cruel iudgement. 2. Diſmall exterminations; the Arke taken of the vncircumciſed, the ſonnes ſlaine in battel in their prieſtly pontificals, the father breaks his necke at the news, the wife dies in abortiue deliuerance, the Prieſthood remooued to an other familie, and their iſſue depriued both of honour and honeſt meanes of life. 3.

Craſſus, Fulvius Flaccus, Plemmenius, Pyrrhus Bremus, and other, that diſhallowed their owne dieties, and came to great miſeries: for although they were but verie deuils, or meere idols, vſurping the honours of the true God, and therefore may be ſaid to be but worthily ſerued, hauing neither merit to deſerue, nor might to reuenge thoſe groſſe indignities: yet I ſay not, it was they that inflicted thoſe executions vpon their diſhonourers, but our God, as Lactantius hath noted; Lac. diu. iuſt. lib. 2. 4.not becauſe they abuſed his corriuals, and thoſe that were not Gods, (for illumined Princes haue vſed them farre worſe:) but partly for contemning the things, which themſelues in erroneous iudgement, did eſteeme for Gods; and partly for profaning thoſe well intended donations, which in intention of deuourer minds, were meant to the true God: and ſo becomming firſt impious robbers, and then ſcurrilous deriders, (which were not ſufferable) of thoſe gods which themſelues profeſſed, and the good things which other had hallowed. And this doth mightily confute the audacious pillages of our prophane people: for if they were ſo reuenged that wronged the falſe gods: how much ſorer puniſhment doe we deſerue, that worſhipping the true, yet practiſe ſo high contempt, ſo contrarie to the principles of our true religion.

The firſt and cheiſe whereof are they of the

Church of Rome, the verie heads whereof, the Popes themſelues, haue done moſt harme to the Church of God: Firſt by taking and making away much or moſt of that, which the deuotion of Chriſtians had bequeathed to God; then ſet on their champions, I meane their Chaplaines, to mainetaine with reaſon, that which they had done without reaſon.

Peter, like young ſtriplings newly come to their lands make good penniworths of that they neuer purchaſt; and then their Friers like hungrie paraſites, muſt reckon vp their diſcommodities of Tythes, as if it were the church-mens beſt husbandry to haue nothing.

                  4. Popiſh appropriations. 4. Laſtly, the appropriating the Tithes and church reuennews to vpſtart orders of ſuperſtitious, or more truely ſacrilegious hypocrites, vntill all was taken away from the true owners, and a miſerable pittance left to ſuch as performed diuine ſeruice, hardly able to hold life and ſoule together; as if all religion had beene wearie of the Church, and taken vp her lodging Doc. Ridlie.in a cloiſter: as my learned and worthie Maſter hath ſhewed, in his view of both lawes, moſt learnedly.
               For at what time that learning was almoſt cleane extinguiſhed, partly by the inundation of barbarous Colonies, who plucked downe churches faſter then euer their fathers built them: partly by the diſtraction of vpſtart hereſies, amazing the eies of moſt men, with the flouriſh of formall hypocriſie; then came Friar Benedict, the founder of regulars, with his diſcontented deuotion, like a new Saint lately dropt out of heauen, enuying himſelfe and his followers, not onely the delights of life, but the neceſſaries of meate, drinke, apparell, proprietie of any thing; and flie-blow'd the world with the heards of hornets, Praemonſtratenſis, Cluniacenſes, Templariās, Hoſpitallers, Cyſtertians, Ioannites, and the reſt. So that all the world, eſpecially Popes and Princes, were wholly rauiſhed with the wonderment of their ſingularitie,

and vied each with other, who ſhould moſt demerit their deuotions, ſome enriching them with lands, other enfranchizing them with priuiledges, all zealing them to the vttermoſt of their power.
               Among many other ill aduiſed prerogatiues, there were two ſuperlatiues, very pernicious to the Church of God. 1. The appropriation of preſentatiue benefices. 2. The exemptions of Abbey lands from paying tythes: I will but touch the firſt. When that hedge of appropriating was once by theſe wild boars broke downe, then all the beaſts of the forreſt ranne thorough, and made it wider. Then Charles Martell father to King Pepin of Fraunce, vnder colour to end the barbarous wars, wreſſed all the Tithes into his hands of that country, proteſting to reſtore them againe to the owners, at the end of thoſe warres; but perfidiouſly brake his oath, and diuided that booty amongſt his launce-knights, that had ſerued him in Balcu

                     .war: whereupon there was deuiſed a tale, that Eucherius ſawe in a viſion Martellus ſoule in hell; and his graue being opened, nothing was found but a monſtrous ſerpent in roome of his bodie: for he had depriued Eucherius of his Biſhoprick of Amiens before; and alſo this was but onely to the end, that Pepin ſhould reſtore the tithes againe which his father had taken away. But Martellus learned that leſſon of the Popes themſelues; and they when themſelues had done it de facto, made their Friers maintaine it de iure: as firſt Alexander of Hales, and Aquinas his ſcholler, the firſt that maintained that Tythes were de iure eccleſiaſtico, not diuino: which Popiſh conceit hath

been by diuers learnedly confuted; as D. Ridlie, D. Carlton, D. Downham, &amp;c.
               
                  Cran. 1. 2. Another reaſon of alienations (for then were mens wits ſet on worke to deuiſe colours) was the ſtiffenes of ſome vanquiſhed countries; as Freezeland by Carolus Mag. which could neuer be brought to pay the Conquerour any tribute, being free people: but as for Tithes, becauſe other Chriſtians paid them, they would not much refuſe.
               Another cauſe alleaged by the ſame author was this, that the Pope and Biſhops miſtruſting that Princes would not otherwiſe defend their rights and reuennews, were content to ſhare with them the endowments of the Church vnder colour of a fee or pencion; chooſing of the two, rather an inconuenience, then a miſcheife; who thereupon paſſed them away vnto their ſeruitours.
               
                  And that this is true, appeares by an oration of Fredericke 1. in an Emperiall diet, to this effect: 
                  Id. 6. 52. Sax.As to you my Lords of the Clergie, the Pope and you thinke much, that lay men ſhould hold any Tithes, or any thing that hath bin giuen to the Church, not remembring that in your neede, you haue beene beholding to our armes: in regard of which pious ſeruices, we were requited againe with ſuch things as theſe, you hauing enough beſide: Thus the Emperour.
               
               
                  Aventine. 4. Others, as the Biſhops of Bauaria, gaue all they had of Church liuing and veſſel to the people of Hungarie to redeeme their liues and liberties: for neceſſitie had no law.
               Among other in England, William the Conquerour

vpon his victorie ouer Harald, appropriated 3. pariſh Churches to the Abbey of Battaile, which he built in memorie of the ſame where he had fought: and William Rufus 20. pariſhes of the new foreſt, to the Church of Sarum: and many other, many like matters.
               And all this we may thanke the Pope for; who in this countrie alone, as M. Cambden hath obſerued, M. Cambden.of 9284. pariſhes, impropriated 3845. that is, almoſt the one halfe: ſo that they need not charge our religion with that ſcurrilous prouerbe, that Pater noſter built vp Churches, but Our father puld them downe againe. For 1. it was no Proteſtants that did alienate at all: 2. no Proteſtants that did procure the ſuppreſſion of religious houſes in the time of Henry 8. but the proud Cardinall himſelfe: 3. not Proteſtants only that inhabite thoſe houſes at this day: laſtly, not Proteſtants that haue defended this fact in their writings to the world: and therfore we may retort their Latin with their owne learning, Pater noſter, &amp; Aue Marie, haue been the rankeſt theeues in Chriſtendome.
               From theſe comes that diſtinction to ſome of ours, de iure diuino, &amp; humano, that tythes partake of all the three of Moſes lawes; 1. Morall, for a competencie: Ceremoniall, for a myſterie: Iudaical, for that pollicie: decepti &amp; decip

                     re not mentioned in Scripture.But it is oft required, why did not Chriſt or his Apoſtles name Tithes, and put the matter out of controuerſie?

let me firſt retort this argument, as he did, who when his aduerſarie had ſaid, Si ſatis eſt negare, quis erit nocens? replied, Si ſatis eſt accuſare, quis erit innocens? but I will ſhew why.
               Firſt, verie many matters, that touch the foundation paſſe vnmentioned, but not vnmeant; the conſubſtantialitie of the Sonne, which the Arrians did oppoſe; particular faith, which the Papiſts; pedobaptiſme, which the Anabaptiſts; and the Sabbath, which the Antiſabbatarians do obiect, are not named, of which it is hereſie to doubt or deny; therfore the reaſon is rotten, to ſay they are not named, therfore are not.
               Secondly, the Synagogue was yet ſtanding, wherto by diuine preſcriptions Tithes were tied; which though by the death of Chriſt, ſhe receiued her deaths wound, yet then was not dead; &amp; when dead, not preſently buried, but with reuerence and honour, as the Fathers ſay, to be put into the graue; ſo that till after her funerals, there was no paying of legacies.
               Thirdly, the ſtate of the new Church was ſuch as yet had neither peace nor prince, ſo that this was no time to put in her claime, but to expect till God ſhould ſtirre her vp ſome foſter Fathers, to order her right.
               Fourthly and laſtly, for feare of ſcandall: for as Chriſt did forbeare a time to tell of his paſſion; and at his death, I haue many other things to ſay vnto

conceale the point of the reſurrection, till the world was better acquainted with their doctrine. The like reaſon was of this, leaſt they might be thought as out of couetouſneſſe to prouide for themſelues: which modeſtie as it was in them commendable, ſo it hath beene in vs preiudiciall; the world ſeruing their own turn vpon our ingenuitie; thinking we need nothing becauſe we ſay nothing. And this may be ſufficient for the ſilence of the new Scriptures.

To the ende that neither the giuer may brag, nor the receiuer bluſh (ſaith one,) that is, the people ſhould not vpbraid the Miniſter with their bountie, nor the Miniſter bee aſhamed to take his dutie, therefore in old time, they were to doe both in the Temple; therefore where tithes are not paid in kind, the Miniſter muſt ſooth his Maſters, or hee ſhall be ſure to ſigh for his means. So▪ 
                  Philo and Thephylact.
               
               2. The Apoſtle commands, and the world expecteth, that the Miniſter bee giuen to hoſpitalitie, although S. Pauls 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , differs much from that keeping good houſes which men expect of their Miniſter, which cannot be done by them that liue vpon a drie ſtipend: and therefore tithes in kind are the moſt conuenient for the Miniſter.
               3. Tithes of all other kind of maintenance, (as our men are enforced to confeſſe, that thinke they are but of humane conſtitution) are the moſt naturall, conuenient, wiſe, ſafe, indifferent of all other: therefore righteſt way to maintaine the Miniſter: except we will ſay, that God hath not prouided ſo meetely for thoſe that preach the Goſpel, as might be done.
               
                  
4. The firſt intendments of appointing Tithes (in all the iudgements of reuerent antiquitie) by God to the old Prieſthood, was to ſerue for an acknowledgement of his Vniuerſall power and right of the creatures, graunted to their comfort. In which regard, the learned Calvin calls tythes, proprium Dei ius, &amp; regium vectigal, his peculiar right, and regall tribute: now the equitie of this remaines in the Church, no leſſe then in the Synagogue: Ergo.
               
               5. The Miniſters, as they are in their callings the meanes of Gods bleſſing ſubordinate to Chriſt, and types of his dealing to all the people; ſo it is equall they haue equal ſhare, in the mercies and iudgments of God, that they may both wayes ſympathize with their people, and ſerue their turne with their ſenſible praiers: which is not done in a ſet ſtipend; neither ſinging at the harueſt, nor weeping in times of dearth; neither winning nor looſing, how euer the world goeth.
               6. And laſtly, for the pariſhioners owne particular; he cannot haue ſo comfortable a fruition of the creatures of God; nor ſatisfie his conſcience any way ſo ſoundly, as by ſacrificing a portion of his corne and increaſe vnto his God, and communicating with his Miniſter in all his goods. Theſe I take it may ſerue in this matter, to prooue that Tithes are due. I meddle not exprofeſſo, with that queſtion, my purpoſe is onely to ſhew that theſe things beeing holy (whether by diuine ordination, or humane conſtitution,) they ſhould be inuiolable, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and ſhould not haue been proſtituted by the vnholy fathers,

as they haue been. In which caſe I can ſay no Aelian.other, but that the deuill hath done like Anytus, one of the 30. tyrants, that vſurped vpon the State at Athens; who finding Socrates to ſtand in his way, and hinder his concluſions, deuiſed this meanes to be rid of him: he hires the idle-headed Poet Ariſtophanes, to traduce the good man openly vpon the ſtage, both to worke him that way ſome open diſgrace, and to ſound the peoples liking of his worſe intreating. The matter ſorted ſo well to the tyrants minde, that the Poet for gaine, and the people for game, gaue way to the cup of hemlocke, and Socrates death.
               The enemie of our ſaluation doth beare the like ſplene to the miniſters of the Goſpel, thorough whoſe ſides he ſeekes to wound, and worke out true religion, as men that indeed do marre his markets. The Pope in the deuils pageant hath acted the Poet, to ſcandalize their profeſſion, by withdrawing their ſuſtentation; perſwading the world, that high pouertie is the way to high perfection, and that a freeze gowne is habit enough for holy profeſſors, (wherein I wonder ſo holy a father doth not goe before, or at leaſt accompany vs in the way to holineſſe) and to poſſeſſe nothing, the onely way to happineſſe.
               Therefore let them that haue any portion of Gods ſpirit, any ſparke of grace, any conſcience of wel-doing, any care of God-ſeruing, ſtop their eares at this Syren of ſinne, the charmes of profit: remember but whoſe brat it is, out of what ſcullerie it came, and let them if they can, if they dare approoue it.

Peter Rubeus at one time carried more monie out of the land, then he left behind him: Martin when there was no more monie to be had, tooke the verie horſes out of the ſtables: and it was prooued in a Parliament, that in the ſpace of 44. yeeres, that is, from the beginning of Hen. 7. to the time that Hen. 8. did cleane expell him, he receiued for Buls alone of Biſhops, ten hundred and 60. thouſand pounds.

For as it was ſaid of Diocleſian, that he was no body to Iulian: for Diocleſian did but tollere preſbyteros; but Iulian ſuſtulit preſbyterium: for the hand of the one was but againſt the profeſſors, but the other aimed at the profeſſion, taking away their ſaleries, not medling with their ſafeties: ſo that it was hard for Chriſtianity, when they had no meanes left to teach and inſtruct the commers on, which while it was had, ſanguis martyrum was ſemen Chriſtianorū, the blood of Martyres cauſed more Chriſtians. But of the Pope enough; and ſo much of the firſt ſort of offenders in ſacriledge.

               I Come next to encounter another enemie of this doctrine, cleane oppoſite to the Papiſts vpon the other hand: The Puritan or Separatiſt, who are according

to their own definition, refined proteſtants, but to others, Goſpellers out of their wits; men drunken with their owne wine, but with difference, ſome more ſoberly beſotted, other more frantickely intoxicated.
               Theſe miſliked the maintenance of Miniſters by Tithes, as either Papall, or at leaſt Iudaicall: but your ſtipends and contributions, vnder the nature of pure almes, that is iuſt for their tooth: and I wiſh them the cold reuerſion of a caſt almes-houſe for their labour. And no maruell, for I haue knowne ſome that haue thriued better, and haue been feathered warmer, vpon brethrens beneuolence, (being able to purchaſe lands, let out monie to vſe, by rayling at the State, &amp; barking againſt Biſhops, and lying by the heeles in humour) then many of their betters could euer doe vpon ordinarie prouiſions, or extraordinarie promotions. No maruell then they miſlike the maintenance: their way is better: and before they miſliked the Church meanes, they fell out of loue with the Church it ſelfe, the edifices, ornaments, ceremonies, ſacraments, and whatſoeuer is not purum putum.
               
               Theſe men I ſay are ſacrilegers: for firſt they haue defiled our holy ſacraries, with their Bedlam Rhetoricke, more fowly then euer they were with Babyloniſh reliques: tearming them Temples of Baal, ſties of Antichriſt, cages of vncleane birds, &amp;c. Nay, ſome haue commenced to ſuch a degree of holy frenzie, that they haue abhorred the very tongue wherein ſuperſtition hath talked, as the language of the beaſt,

the beginning had been erroneous. And as we ſhall ſee elſewhere, in donations to ſuperſtitious vſes, their ſuper may bee mended, but their ſtitious continued. As for Abbey lands, I wiſh King Henry 8. had not taken away the ſubiect of the queſtion, there is an other reaſon and queſtion of them. But Biſhops lands were giuen vpon the firſt planting of the Churches; and if ſuch Temporalties of Biſhops, and thoſe which they called matrices Eccleſiae: much more tithes of Gods owne inſtitution, or at the leaſt giuen by the common conſent of the Chriſtian world. All which endowments, not we, but the auncient Fathers (as Hom▪ 18 in Act.
                  Auguſtine, Cyprian, Chryſoſtom, and the reſt,) call patrimonium Chriſti, dotem Sponſae, Chriſti ſacram poſſeſſionem, and praedia ſancta.
               
               Therefore let vs not correct magnificat, and in preſumptuous noueltie, condemne and contemne all antiquitie. The word Church, or as our Northren Brittan calls it, Kyrck, is but the corruption of

                  , to ſay, the Lords houſe: which ſo long as the world was enflamed with the ſacred fire of deuotion, euery hand and heart deſired to ſanctifie it ſelfe, to adorne, and endow. But now ſince that was quenched, and the ſacred fire of rapine and ſacriledge hath bin kindled; men leaue to be zealous, and learne to be ſacrilegious, becomming execrable by touching execrables.
               As for thoſe lights of Gods Church, whoſe learning we loue, and names reuerence; I ſpeak of Calvin &amp; the reſt, whoſe authoritie is vrged againſt vs; who for the prophanation, fell out with the Conſecration

of theſe things; like the Athenian that came to Aristides, 
                  Ariſt. Pol.to haue him write Ariſtides name to baniſh him by the law of Oſtraciſme; yet it was not for any crime that either had committed, but that for want of meanes, and leiſure from other imployments, they were no better acquainted with the parties: yet Calvin miſliked of tythes, onely becauſe they were obtruded ſacerdo

Paul and S. Calvin were to preach in one houre, hee would leaue S. Paul to heare S. Caluin.
               
               For you, I wiſh you better aduiſed, leaſt God obſerue by whom he is impeached: your meaning may bee good, but haſt of your way hath out-galloped your good intent; and precipitancie in iudging, hath foreſtalled your iudgement. For I beſeech you look backe into your prepoſterous courſes, and tell mee what manner of propoſitions theſe be: Tythes, Prelacies, Churches, demeanes, &amp; dignities are all Antichriſtian, the markes of the beaſt, the garments of the whoore, the ſties of the deuill. Lentardus 600. yeeres ſince, made himſelfe away in verie deepe deſperation, hauing taught that theſe things were idle and ſuperfluous: and many among you, hauing been drawne away from the mother Church, after your whiſtles and oaten pipes, finding hollowneſſe in your holineſſe,

haue done little better: whereby many of your Doctors haue been murderers of Gods people, and if not violatores, inuaders your ſelues of Gods inheritance, yet ye haue been traditores, betrayers of it to other, and traytors to your Maſter. For as in the trade of purſing, there are ſetters, and there are actors; ſo it cannot be denied, that if you did not commit the robberies your ſelues, yet you plotted the matches, and were partakers of the purchaſe.
               For who were they that egged on the Herodians to beg our reuenewes, and ſet on the ſouldiers to caſt a chance for Chriſts coat againe? were they not ſome men in your coates, that put vp bills and petitions to the Parliament houſe, to plucke downe Churches, to erect Chappels, to ruine many to reare one? Who were they that would haue made the world beleeue, that Biſhops were Antichriſtian callings, and elders were the worthy gouernours? that ſo not in euerie Dioceſſe, but in euery pariſh, for a Biſhop you might erect a ſuperintendent in name, a Pope in truth? Who was it that called the Vultures to the ſpoyle, &amp; the beaſts vnto the prey, with an Edomites voice, crying, Downe with them, downe with them euen to the ground; and a Moabites tongue, Vp Moab to the ſpoyle? by which meanes both the Canaanite is ſtill in the land, and the Edomite hath deuoured all: and all the coſt beſtowed on Gods houſe is counted Poperie, and all the meanes that commeth not of Almes is held tyrannie: So that ſhortly we ſhall not be ſo holy as horſes; for they may be ſtabled in Churches: but wee ſhall not haue our ceremonies ſo well as in ſtables;

but either in houels, or vnder hedges, the Miniſters hauing no more reſpect then grooms &amp; oſtlers; and the land no religion at all, or ſo many as there are Churches, by meanes of euery new fanglednes. 2.

And ſo much of the ſecond ſort.

               Againſt Lay-mens vſurpations of holy demeanes, with anſwer to their cauils.
               NOw come I to Lay-men, who haue inueſted themſelues with Tithes and Church poſſeſſions, ſome vnder colour of pious offices, moſt without colour, making them or taking them for things of meere appropriation; like the froſen Serpent, ſo long harboured by the farmers fire, till it had recouered life, and then driuing his kind hoſt out of his owne houſe. Many of whoſe court-rowls, if they were well ſuruaied, would bee found as womens accouſtrements, which is mundus, indeed a world of trinkets; but in that world, the woman is minimapars ſui: ſo if euery bird had her owne feather, and euery Church her true tythe, many of them would not haue the tythe of that they hold. Such is the age wherein wee liue, wherein nothing is accounted ill that can be gained: the names of ſinnes for the moſt

part (as this of Sacriledge) containing more horror then the ſins themſelues, as I could inſtance in many. The ſinne of Vſurie, that was of old ſo odious to God and man, the vſuall theame of childrens declamations, is now growne ſo well reconciled, that no trade is more compendious, warrantable, vniuerſall; as if the venemous teeth were either fallen out with age, or the vicious qualitie were ſo well corrected, that all borrowers were inriched by it. But as one hath well ſaid, if the teeth are rebated for biting, yet the gummes are hard in nipping: ſo that it may be truely ſaid of this, as is ſpoken of the great Turke, The graſſe wil neuer grow more where the Grand Seniors horſe hath ſet his foote: ſieldome hath any ſtate recouered, that hath beene beholden vnto the Vſurer: Yet call a demure profeſſor, by the name of vſurer, though Nouerint Vniuerſi, all the world doth know it, he will haue an action againſt you. Now what is the reaſon of this, but that he cannot endure to heare, what he can be content to be? the word containes ſome kinde of malignitie, the monie hath none, but like the Tole-monie which the Emperour Veſpaſian raiſed of his ſubiects vrine, bonuseſt odor lucri ex re qualibet. I might in like manner goe through the whole Cyclopadie of ſinne, theeuing, whoring, ſwearing, drinking, and ſtabbing: the ſame is the caſe of ſacriledge, the word is harſh, the name infamous, but the thing of a better aſpect, and the profit of good acceptance.
               In which regard manie of our great Magnificos haue acted vs Hercules furens, who comming into Venus
                  
Temple, and there finding a golden Adonis, put that in his pocket with this pretie quip, At tu nihil ſacries: Your maſterſhip is no deitie: ſo whatſoeuer theſe men could finger in Church or churchyard, ſo long as it is neither Saint nor ſhrine, they hold for good purchaſe, and haue been content to pocket manie ſuch wrongs.
               Yet the King of Ammon ſhaued but halfe the beards of Dauids Embaſſadours (for they might be too long) and clipped but halfe their cloathes (they might be too heauie) but our ſhauers, becauſe they would bee ſure to leaue no ſuperfluous excrement, haue taken away alſo the neceſſarie tegument; ſo that in ſome ſenſe we may (though with our ſhame) be chalenged by the Papiſts, that Pater noſter built vp Churches, but Our Father hath pluckt them downe againe.
               Our deuout predeceſſors out of their ignorance, did but abuſe the materials of holineſſe; but our moderne demure profeſſors, out of our much learning, haue quite taken them away. Many ioyned in the worke of the reformation, without true meaning to reformation, more ſtudying for gold then ſeruing of God, and more thirſting for the goods of the Church, then any good to the Church: ſo that we may write of our reformators, as a Frenchman did of the laſt ciuil broiles of their pacificators,

For as S. Auguſt. ſaid of ſome heretiques, to eſtabliſh their owne deuiſes, miſinterpreting the Scriptures, de medicamentis ſibi vulnera faciunt, make themſelues ſores of the verie ſalues: we may truely ſay to haue falne out in this caſe, that the medicine hath prooued worſe then was the maladie: the one failing but in the manner, but we in the verie matter; as is touched elſewhere. Therefore as fooliſh and iladuiſed Plut.people, flying the inuaſion of theeues or wild beaſts, fall into whirle-pooles, or break-neck places: ſo while theſe vndertakers had their eie another way, flying from ſuperſtition, haue ingulfed themſelues in irreligion; either ouer-looking, or at leaſt ouer-leaping true religion between them both. For whereas the firſt donors ſhewed humanity in the efficient, impelling, or moouing cauſe; our goodly correctors haue failed in the finall: for where men of more deuotion then inſtruction tooke ſuperſtition for religion, which was the minor; theſe men of more greedineſſe then godlineſſe, haue taken deſtruction for edification, which is the maior: and ſo the laſt errour hath been worſe then the firſt. Wherein they ſeeme little to haue differed from the ſouldiers, that caſt a chance for Chriſts coat: ſauing that thoſe ſuffered Chriſt to haue his life in it; theſe haue not only parted his garments among them while he is aliue, but ſo much as in them lies, puſhed at his life, to poſſeſſe them ſecurely, embezeling the maintenance that ſhould propagate his Kingdome.
               
                  
                  Abuſe obiected. But it hath been much and oft obiected, that the Eccleſiaſticall liuings were fowly abuſed in former times; and therefore it was thought good by the State they ſhould be ſuppreſſed. I graunt the abuſe: but what? is abuſe become a warrant for aboliſhment? what Logick is this? or what law for poore Churchmen? The Philoſopher would denie though wine is abuſed, that the vine ſhould bee rooted out: the like would the ſcholler doe for books; the Stateſmen for armes; the Law-makers for ſcepters; the Diuines for Scriptures. All which things if they may haue leaue to ſtand, and to rectifie their abuſe, ſhall the Church yet forfeit all, if her reuenewes ſhall bee abuſed?
               But ſay that Abbeyes and Monaſteries were abuſed; and let it not be the fault ſo much of the men, as of the matters themſelues; what haue our Cathedral and rurall Churches deſerued? Admit that Babylon muſt goe downe; but why muſt Bethelem beare her company? May I not as truely complaine herein, as ſometime Athanaſius did; Eſto, peccauerit Athanaſius, at quid alij Epiſcopi fecerunt, aut quem Arſenium occiderunt? Suppoſe that Athanaſius indeede were guiltie, yet what haue other Biſhops done; haue other Biſhops killed Arſenius alſo? So though Abbies had deſerued their doome, what can be pretended againſt Biſhopricks, Deanries, Dignities, Cathedrals, and Colledges, and poore countrie Parſonages? all are not tainted with the ſame imputations, yet all haue beene expoſed to the ſame maledictions.
               Which had they been ſpared, and Gods houſes

pell-mell not ſo inuaded, the wils of the dead had bin better fulfilled, the infanterie of learning otherwiſe prouided, the honour of God more carefully furthered, their dying conſciences better comforted, and their owne ſucceſſions and eſtates more firmely eſtabliſhed. Now deſolation is written vpon many of their doores, and extirpation hath ſeazed on their families, while Zim and Iim daunce in their parlors, Ochim and Oſtraches ſcritch in their pallaces; the fathers for the moſt part dying either comfortleſſe, or childleſſe; the ſonnes liuing either graceleſſe, or landleſſe: the fathers ſuſtaining the infamie of robbers, the ſonnes induring the miſerie of beggars: both fathers &amp; ſonnes like Ionas whale, ſicke in their ſtates and ſtomacks, vntill they had regorged the fat morſells which their hungry ſtomacks had too haſtily ſwallowed. Nay, tell me if your ſelues haue not obſerued, that many of ſuch demeanes haue prooued like Seianus horſe, that neuer had owner, but either he brake his necke, or bleſſed him with ſome other misfortune. Avery remarkeable iudgement of God, to infuſe a malignitie into the verie lands, that no man ſhould thriue that holds them, no man ſhould eſcape ſome egregious miſchiefe that hath them. I will ſay nothing of the Suppreſſors themſelues, of whom a very great man of this Kingdome hath written, L.

But there are many things ſlanderouſly deuiſed, and iniuriouſly enforced againſt vs, to legittimate their owne ſacrilegious dealing, and iuſtifie our deſerued ſuffering: their high deſerts, our great vnworthineſſe; the diſproportion of the things themſelues, and the incongruity in other countries.
               Of all which in generall I may ſay, as ſometime Hierom.
                  Hierome did, Ingemui fateor, minus nobis ineſſe voluntatis ad propugnandam veritatem, quàm ineſt illis inuidentiae ad inculcandum mendacium: it grieued me I confeſſe, to ſee that we haue leſſe will to auerre our true propoſitions, then our enemies haue malice to enforce their falſe concluſions.
               
                  Great mens great deſerts. 1. Firſt, therefore as to their deſerts; let me ſay as Alexander did, to ſilence Epheſtion contending againſt Craterus: At quantae opes, aut quod tuum facinus, ſi quis

tibi demat Alexandrum tuum? and I pray ſir, what may your mightie meanes or merits be, if wee except your Soueraignes fauour? To be cloathed in ſcarlet, and fare deliciouſly euery day, is cauſe inough to ery, heu quanta patimur! oh our paines! oh our ſeruices! But ſuppoſing that the ſeruices were as bigge as their ambitions can faine them; and as many as their paraſites could ſtraine them; yet not like the merits of Zopyrus to his Maſter, that to win him Babylon, did endure the ampulation of his eares, and mutilation of his members: But though they had wonne their King another Monarchie, yet muſt they ſtil fall ſhort of the Clergie; and howſoeuer, yet not to be rewarded out of the Church, but the Exchequer.
               But alas, that men cannot raiſe the walls of their owne worthineſſe, but vpon the rubbiſh of others ruines. We enuie not their honours, nor ſeeke to ſupplant their fortunes: let them deſpiſe vs as ſuperciſiouſly as they pleaſe, yet when they haue done, our calling ſhall be both honourable with God, and noble in it ſelfe, and meritorious to the world, howſoeuer our perſons ſhall bee eſteemed; both for birth &amp; breeding not inferiour to many of our maligners. But to omit theſe titles not ours, why ſhould not Pallas and Apollo haue as faire charters to inveſt their clients with earneſts of honour, as any of the other dieties? Why ſhould not the arts and learned ſtudies, priuiledge as much as the Hall or Burſe? why ſhould not the Queen of learning Diuinitie, raiſe her followers as high as an other pettie Lady about the towne? Therefore let no man, that hath nothing to

alleadge but his fathers conueiances, vpbraid our callings and degrees of ſchooles, with ſuperannated cauillations: for euen our inferiour Graduates haue paid more, and deſerued better for thoſe their titles of approbation, then they that mocke them, and only know thus much in themſelues, that they know nothing worth knowledge. Chryſoſtome as is wel known, writeth a tract of ſet purpoſe, beſide many other places of his workes, to prooue that a Biſhop is not onely equall, but ſuperiour vnto a King: which if it be a ſtraine too high, yet it is cleare, that the moſt eminent Princes that euer were, thought it their glorie, to annexe the illumination of Prieſts to the ſublimations of their Soueraignties. And thoſe greateſt Prophets, Eſay and Daniel, that were of the blood royall, thought it no diſparagement to ſerue the Church: Bartholmew among the Apoſtles, Ambroſe, Chryſoſtome, Petronius, Metrophanes, Euſebius, Emiſſenus, Victorinus, Caſſianus, and a number more of the famous Biſhops, were very nobly deſcended. But what ſpeake I of ſuch, or of yeſterday? are not the

               To returne then to the point, men muſt not rob Peter to pay Paul, or more truely rob both Peter and Paul, to pay a Centurion, or gratifie a minion. The Church and common-wealth are two diſtinct bodies, hauing each their offices, their charges, their penſions: concerning which our Sauiour hath ſet downe, date Caeſari quae ſunt Caeſaris, &amp; Deo quae Dei ſunt.
               
               As to the validitie of Princes gift in this caſe, who am I to decide ſuch queſtions? and yet learned men haue been of this minde, that howſoeuer in their owne indiuiduall perſons, they may by their Vnction be inabled to poſſeſſe ſuch lands; yet may they not transferre the ſame from themſelues to any other, not in like ſort qualified: as things that are alterius fori &amp; eminentioris ſceptri, matters belonging to a higher Court, and ſubiect to a greater cogniſance. Therefore the learned Kickerman, is ſo bold as to Syſt. Proli

And therfore holy Biſhops, as Ambroſe, and Bernardus of Halbertade in Germanie, choſe rather to die, then to part with their Churches, and Church liuings. We read how ſtoutly that

                  Madgebur. Father did conteſt with a mightie Emperour; We yeeld (ſaith he) vnto the Emperour all that is his due: is it his tribute that he doth demaund? his tribute we denie not: is it the Church he doth require? we may not betray the Church vnto him: Gods Church is none of Caeſars charge, he may not haue to doe therewith, &amp;c.
               But God of heauen be bleſſed, we neede no ſuch Apologie for the Kings perſon, who are moſt bound to God for his Maieſties moſt Roiall and religious heart, that hath been ſo farre from taking away, that he hath laboured earneſtly and zealouſly to reſtore backe againe whatſoeuer is eſſentiall to the Church; but as for other we ſay no other, but thoſe words of Act. 19. 15.a homely author: Paul we know, and Ieſus we know, and Caeſar we know; vos autem qui eſtis? but who are you, that ſo defraud Ieſus, and Paul, and Caeſar alſo? And ſo much to them that plead their deſerts to Churchliuings.
               
                  The Clergies vnworthynes. 2. I come to a ſecond, Church-mens vnworthines: Biſhops do not preach, and dignified men do no good; conclude, therefore lay-men may, nay muſt haue In Cyropaed.their lands. Zenophon did whip young Cyrus for a better argument, becauſe he gaue the greater coate to the greater boy; not becauſe hee had right vnto it, but becauſe it fitted him better: and the leſſer coate to the leſſer boy; the Prince therein offending in diſtributiue iuſtice, a point of Ethicks only. But were Zenophon now aliue to iudge of this fact, he would I feare me, hang vp them that ſhould commit ſuch ſoleciſmes againſt Ethicks, politicks, logicke, and diuinitie:

                  Biſhops doe not preach; therefore Barons muſt haue their Biſhopricks: why? do Barons preach? church men do no good, therfore churles muſt haue the Tithes: why? do church robbers ſo much good? Bluſh impietie: doth he care for preaching that plucks downe the Church? or he minde goodnes, that is enemie to godlines? what is this but to ſtraine at a gnat, and ſwallowe a cammel? to deuoure the Church, and cough at the chaire? although I reſt aſſured it is not the dew of heauen (preaching,) that you looke after; but the fat of the earth, the pottage and portion of Eſau. Moſes gaue a diſpenſation to quinquagenarians, to ceaſe from the ordinarie ſeruices Leu. 4. 2.of the Temple, to commence to places of regiment: and will you tie the graie haires of age and reuerence, to an euerlaſting apprentiſhip of ſtudy and ſpeech? like your mill-horſe at home to his wonted taske? ſhall your ſeruitour, and horſe of ſeruice, and the verie mill-horſe which I named, haue immunitie and ceſſation of yeeres and labour; and muſt your ſpirituall Paſtor and Father, your Prieſt and Prophet, runne rownde in an euerlaſting circle, damned to this deſtinie by your inequall doome; and clime vp into the pulpit, till he can no longer come downe, but tumble downe with age and feeblenes, to be the miſerable laughing ſtocke of the prophane frie? nay, are there not more and more honorable, and no leſſe neceſſarie ſeruices for old men, then are of young? Oh teach not thy ſonne, thy ſeruant ſo euill a leſſon to curſe thee in thy age. The youngeſt infant in the chimney corner, is often

made the rod of Gods wrath, to reuenge the vnreuerend carriage of a wicked Cham, to an aged Noah. But Biſhops doe preach, witnes the moſt commendable and indefatigable paines of many of thoſe prelats, that are moſt eminent in the land; whom neither this my anſwer can honour, nor your imputation ſlander. I ſay no more, Non tali auxilio, nec defenſoribus iſtis Tempus eget.—
               The reſt doe no good, you ſay, they keepe no houſes▪ is all goodnes in houſe-keeping? then much of the nobiltie and gentrie of this land, doe verie little good: yet Church-men keep houſes; not for you perhaps, that would liue at free coſt, yet for their poore neigbours: howbeit perchance neither all, nor for all, nor alwaies: for quis ad haec ſufficiens? but thoſe that doe not what they may, aetatem habent, I leaue to their owne apologies. Wherefore this eauill of our vnworthines, I hold but the idle euaporation of godles braines, that hold other men, eſpecially our calling, worthy of nothing; themſelues worthie of all: but they are not our iudges, neither is it reaſonable, that our enemies ſhould be both our accuſers, and witneſſes, and iudges, and excutioners alſo.

                      of Tithes. 3. An other obiection is, the muchnes or meaſure of ſuch demeanes, the lands too great, the Tithes too large: and all that fall beſide their mouth too much. But in the meane time, their apiſh vanities, epicure like ſuperfluities, fuliginous fooleries, ſacrilegious robberies, Fimbrian-like iniuries, Tarquinian like ſurquedries, Eſauiſh profanities, and Iulianiſh apoſtaſies are not too much. But to the point, which aimes at ſome reaſon, but lined with much malice. Some of the Popes clawbacks, to daube vp the faults of thoſe holy Fathers, (as I haue ſhewed elswhere) maintained, that Tithes were grounded vpon all the 3. Lawes of Moſes: morall for the equitie, ceremoniall for the affinitie, Iudiciall for the pollicie; becauſe the Iewes were 10. Tribes, whereunto 2. other were added to make amends for ſome mens bad payment: all vntrue. But if the Prieſts were then M. Robarts.the tenth part of the people, where was that proportion before that Law? But it hath been further prooued, that the Leuits were not the 10. nor 12. nor 20. part of that people, nor the 40. but at leaſt the ſixtieth: yet let vs obſerue their portion and proportion. The learned D. Downeham hath collected, De Dig. min.that the Prieſts income, being brought home to them without labour or charge, with their 48. cities, was more to them (being as the honourable Sir

                  Water Raleigh hath prooued not much bigger then Wales,) then all the Biſhopricks, benefices, Colledge lands, and all other Eccleſiaſticall endowments and profits in this land, though the Popes of Rome, nor any other had neuer alienated any, as now they haue done one halfe. And this was not only among the Iewes, but from the firſt preaching of the Goſpel: ſo ſoone as the ſcepter turned Chriſtian, Euſeb.all Tithes were inſtantly reſtored, all lands and donations that vnder the perſecutions had beene taken away, all Images, treaſure, and furniture of heathen temples: yeerely ſummes amounting to a great quantitie out of the Exchequer it ſelfe: all the goods of ſuch as died inteſtate, all new erections of wel diſpoſed people: and to knit vp all in one word, the ſame to be hereditarie, as vnder Moſes.
               
               And thus ſtood the affaires of the Church, till Antichriſt confounded things ſacred and prophane; and Cymmeriall darkenes diſpoſſeſt the world, as of illumination, ſo of true deuotion; onely ſome ſmall good meaning did ſometimes vndoe themſelues, to endow the Church, wherein it became ſo ſuperlatiuely prodigall, that it hath been hide-bound euer ſince. And now are we arriued at thoſe times, where the children carrie it out much faſter then euer their Fathers brought it in: where our inſatiable churchhownds, do not as Cerberus did with Sybillas inchaunted ſop,

But wee are here to diſpute, not de facto, but de iure; not what is, but what ſhould be done: Viuendum legibus non exemplis: it is not the deedes of men, but the doctrine of God that ſhould be our guide: for the ſame Countries allow of tolerations, ſhall I ſay? or commixtions rather of all kinde of religions.

               For many haue enthralled theit liuings and liberties together, to the importunities of their troubles, or abitrement of their Kings: as the French to Carolus

               And ſome haue thought, that what the Biſhops in that caſe haue done, is good againſt themſelues; but it is to childiſh to change the moſt naturall and wiſe order of the world, for an idol of a trauellers braine: ſeeing it can neither be bettered, nor paralled with the like: ſome in inequalitie muſt be confeſſed, which might be redreſſed, which is accidentall, no deformitie that is ſubſtantiall.

               CHAP. IIII.
               Againſt the exemptions that ſome Cities and great Townes doe clame in Church duties.
               THere is an other ſort of men, that albeit they lurch not the Church lands, nor count them Antichriſtian, yet enfranchiſe themſelues with a falſe priuiledge; that they are as free from the commandement of God in this caſe, or any other ordinance of man concerning that matter, as from the reſcripts of the Sheriffe of the out-ſhiere; to pay nothing for the maintenance of the Miniſter, more then their owne mind ſhall voluntarie condeſcend vnto, or order taken vpon their agreement at the Hall, ſhall make them liable vnto. And therefore it

ſeemes a thing moſt abſurd, and verie vnreaſonable, that Perſonall Tithes of Artificers, trades-men, and Merchants, ſhould be demaunded. By which meanes they ſad and dull the hearts of their Miniſters, by a couetous and vnconſcionable preſcription, to allow him nothing, but his two-pennie offrings at Eaſter, and a verie ſmall quillet not to be accounted of beſide. But they muſt vnderſtand, that firſt at leaſt a perſonall Tithe is due, which that poore portion no way doth counteruaile by a thouſand part. Secondly, if not in act, yet in equitie, ſome proportionate ſumme vnto that which God, and man hath indifferently ſet downe. And of this aſſertion I haue theſe reaſons, beſide thoſe I haue ſet downe in generall.
               1. It is the dictate of nature, and poſitiue law of Why Cities and Townes ſhould pay perſonall Tithes. Pro. 3. 9. Gen. 14. Gen. 2. Num 31.God, to honour God with our riches, and the good things of this life as is Gods ordinance, and as the holy men of God haue done, Abraham, Iacob, and all the holy nation, and all our countrie beſide. What charter then or charitie, what cuſtome or conſcience can be pretended, to free vs from that which all the Chriſtian world, nay all the Vniuerſall world are bound vnto?
               They may obiect, that one man may ſerue that turne for a whole Citie or Towne, and for one man their maintenance may be ſufficient. Firſt it is not credible or poſſible, that any one ſhould feed more thouſands with a morſell of bread, then euer Chriſt fedde with 7. loaues, and 2. fiſhes. Beſides, what Stento
                        •
                     s voice, or Eolus lungs, or iron ſides, may be

ſufficient to ſtretch to ſo many thouſands? but that is as groſſe as all the reſt, that he that ſhould take ſo much paines, ſhould haue no more then that ſlender reward.
               2. Will not God at his generall Audit obiect this vnto ſuch; that labourers in the Countrie, and fiſhermen in poore Townes of the coaſt, whom he neuer honoured with the tenth of their eaſe, the twentieth of their opportunity, the hundreth part of their happines, yet returne him by Tithe a couuenient portion of their labours, &amp; his bleſſing: but theſe that ought to haue been manie miles before them in godlines, come ſhort of them many leagues in gratefullneſſe. Matth. 25. 14.The parable of the talents is well knowne and remembred, but not euer practiſed: and therefore God many times ſends vs other remembrancers: Pirats at ſea, and prowlers at land, to conſume our ſubſtance, bringing men ofttimes from the wealth and pride of the Cittie, to the want and drudgerie of the Countrie, for ſuch forgetfullneſſe and contempt.
               3. The ſeruice vnder the law was a coſtly ſeruice, where men were to allocate the third part of their eſtate to the miniſtration of the Tabernacle, what by ſacrifices of all ſorts, what by peculiar charges riſing on ſome occaſions: but vnder Poperie, this charge was doubled and trebled, where the third part of the land went to the blinde and the lame Clergie. From the firſt we are freed by Chriſt; from the ſecond by Chriſtian Princes. What? to be exempt as by a Magna Charta, from all ſuit and ſeruice that belongs

to God? No: but wee are ſtill tied to performe to God an honorable ſeruice, that his Goſpel may be continued, his praier perpetuated, his miniſters maintained, his houſes repaired, his members comforted, his infanterie nurſed, his ſeruants ſaued. What pittie is it then to ſee ſo many ſheep without ſhepheards, ſo many ſhepheards without meanes, that of ſo many pariſhes as are many times found in ſuch places, all the wages of ſingle and double halls together, not able to amount to one ſufficient ſtipend of a good Miniſter; that is to ſay, where the moſt houſholders ſhal giue a matter of two ſhillings two pence to his Miniſter by the yeare, and the beſt but fowre ſhillings fowre pence, (I ſpeake within compaſſe) vnder 5. ſhillings, and yet ſome of theſe men by their owne eſteem, and other mens, worth many thouſands; and as they are merchants, may gaine many hundreds of pounds that yeere. And where I may be challenged, that euen this in all the Towne and Citie through, may riſe to more then a competent liuing for one man, though I ſpake of no more then the pariſh maintenance, I will put all the Lecturers wages in beſide, it will not ſo bee more then enough or competent: when all can accrew hardly to 200. pounds by the yeare; and that to ſuch a man as I ſpeak of, and they ſhould labour for, yet ſcarce competent: for why ſhould we not value a godly, learned, well borne man and Miniſter, in equal ranke with the beſt merchant, when as in ſuch an one the ſumme would be but beggerie, yea no way but in wealth qualified like the other.
               
                  
4. And becauſe I haue mentioned the Miniſters perſon, let that be another motiue, the loue we are to ſhew vnto them. Now what kindnes can this be, to defraud him of his true allowance, and to mince him out ſuch mites, and micas (crumbs as commonly men do, and count him highly beholding to them for that alſo? I will not ſay as Tullie doth in like caſe, that it is latr onis beneficium, who thinke the traueller is much bound vnto him for his life, which hee might haue taken as well as his purſe: But this I ſay, I feare me thoſe men that now in the libertie of the Goſpel deny vs our owne; if any other colour of religion ſhould turne trumpe, wil hardly giue vs their owne.
               5. Another cauſe why ſuch places ſhould pay perſonall tythes, or like liberall maintenance, is the ſecuring of their owne eſtates: for this ſmall tribute that we doe ſo returne our God, is ſepes diuitiarum, the fence of our fortunes, and cauſeth the legittimation of our other goods. For men muſt imitate the

The charge which they pretend daily to grow vpon them for impoſt, &amp;c. are meere cauillations: for that they fetch vp againe vpon the poore countrie, and themſelues grow rich the while.
               6. Laſtly, would they doe as the mother Citie, where they pay not by the hal, but by the rent of the

houſe, the tenth of that, as is I thinke intended by the ſtatute: they would procure both wealth and wiſdome, loue and learning, religion and renowne, to wreath them a chaplet, to make them happie, and all their daughters and neighbours by them: where bountifull meanes allures the beſt men, and kind vſage of all that comes, drawes all the learning of the land vnto them: for vbi populus ibi queſtus, vbi cadauer ibi aquilae: whereas now the niggardize that is vſed in many places, breeds many vnkindneſſes between the Miniſters and people; and the ſmall meanes the Miniſter hath to liue on, breeds him baſeneſſe, baſenes contempt, contempt diſcouragement: and on both ſides, all the diſlike and vnfriendly words and wiſhes, that may be imagined. By theſe reaſons I am induced to miſlike the courſe that runnes common in great places, and to reuoke men to the right and prime inſtitution.
               
                  Obiections. But guiltineſſe is neuer without gain-ſaying, and mans nature is ſtubborne not to yeeld to the word. Some pretend pouertie, and in that caſe men are to be pitied, not burdened; therefore God requires, according 
                  2. Cor. 8. 12.
                  to that we haue, not according as we haue not, to vſe liberalitie, much more gratuity to God and their Miniſter. Yet it is not equall, that men not hauing to their minds, ſhould therefore pay nothing, but eate or ſpend Gods part as they doe their own. And who in theſe places is ſo poore, that hee doth not feaſt once or ofter, in the yeare, in ſuch ſort that the very reuerſion of their riot, would not be a comfortable refreſhing to his miniſter, if he had it in mony.
               
                  
But pouertie is not alwaies truely pretended: for compare the husbandman with the citizen, in diet, apparell, houſe, furniture, building expences; and then tell me which is the poorer? there I am ſure the Towneſman will haue all things excellent, whatſoeuer it coſt, ſo that he is rich at home, &amp; poor at the Auguſt.Church: as one ſaies, Etſi in domibus ſunt auro diuites, tamen in Eccleſia ſunt mendici: for their own occaſion they will find mony, but for Gods they cannot ſpare it.
               2. They are ſubiect to many charges, and greater loſſes, then thoſe of the Countrie: and is that any cauſe to denie God his tribute? that is, the Miniſter his due? I ſhould thinke that binds them to be more thankefull for his fauour, mercie, and prouidence: as Numb. 31. 26.we ſee in the Iſraelites, beeing but a ſmall band, yet vanquiſhed fiue Kings of Madian: firſt parted with one halfe of the prey vnto their fellowes that went not into the field; and of the other moitie gaue a tribute to God, one of 500. and further for Gods vnexpected deliuerance, hauing not miſſed one man, offered vnto him of their owne accord another oblation of the iewels and ornaments of the pillage, to the value of 16750. ſhekels of gold.
               But we can be content to offer vnto God, as many good words as he will, but no mony; but then we Auguſt.verifie the ſpeach of the Father, we do not offer vitulos labiorum, but labia vitulorum, not the calfs of the 
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                  lips, but the lips of calues. And as another, we will ſeeke Chriſt with the wiſe men, but we wil leaue our budgets at home, we will not open our treaſures to

him as they did. Dauid had a quid retribuam? what Pſal, 116.ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits that he hath done to me? but we point where is none: quid? retribuam? what? ſhall I render vnto the Lord any thing? ill done.
               3. He would ſo be too rich, and too well acquainted with our eſtates. 1. This is to bee wiſer then God; for he made no ſuch prouiſo. 2. What hurt if thy Miniſter knew in generall, nay in particular the bleſſing or curſing of God vpon thee? were that any harme to thy ſoule? thou ſhalt be ſure of one comfort, to haue one that will ſimpathize with thee, and one that will ſupplicat for thee.
               Laſtly, for I will not follow theſe foxes to any more holes: If miniſters would not challenge it of debt, but take it as almes, or contribution, or beneuolence, they ſhould fare better. This is a burthen too heauy to be borne, eſpecially where all commodities are ſo high rated as they are.
               1. Why ſhould any account that burthen ouerheauy, which God hath laid vpon them? 2. which other beare cheerefully, that are farre more vnable? 3. that brings ſo great benefit and bleſſing with it, to haue the light of Goſhen, when other ſit in the darkneſſe of Egypt? 4. that is a thing ſo neceſſarie? 5. which our predeceſſours yeelded ſo willingly vnto, to bind themſelues and their heires for euer to perform? 6. Or what comfort is it to impropriate in this manner, that which God and all good men haue annexed? Is it diſhonour to acknowledge a debt to our better, a duty to our Prince, a tribute to our God? is

it diſhoneſt for the Miniſter that in Gods behalfe doth require the ſame? why then ſhould we be angry with him, that tells vs what is due, or to raile on them that refute our falſhood? this ſnarling againſt the preacher, is but recalcitrating againſt the word. It is not the man, but the matter, to haue our couetouſnes detected, our oppreſſion checked, our vſury reprooued, our extortion ranſanked: it is Mammon that ſtings vs, not the miniſter that offends vs: but beware what ye ſhall doe in this caſe; to bee pricked in heart for our fault is one thing, but to pricke his heart that diſcouers our ſins; is not to ſtomacke him but his ſender: to omit a truth or duty vpon ignorance, is one thing; but to oppugne the truth out of malice is an other. Sacriledge may goe ſingle, but if it be combined with obſtinacie, and obſtinacie attended with impenitencie, where before there was but one deuill, now there will bee ſeuen; and where there might haue been hope of reformation, there godly minds will feare, an ende in deſperation. And ſo I leaue this point.

               There are two kinde of cuſtomes that are not good: 1. Conſuetudo peccandi, quae tollit ſenſum (non reatum) peccati: 2. Vetuſtas erroris, quae quo magis obtinet, magis grauet. There is a cuſtome of ſin, which takes away the cuſtome, but not the guilt of ſinning: and there is an antiquity of errour, the which the more it is in requeſt, the more it offends.
               
                  Decretals. But to ſay all in a word, the Canoniſts haue well confined the valitidie of Cuſtomes: Conſuetudo non derogat iuri naturali, ſeu diuino: therefore all ſuch cuſtomes as are derogatorie to the Church, are to be reuerſed.
               Now what are the cuſtomes that are laid in our diſh, for the moſt part, but impious, iniurious, vnreaſonable, abſurd, vnconſcionable, and vnnaturall?
               1. Gods word doth legimate the miniſter in all Gal▪ 66.the goods of the Auditor. Now all and ſmall, the whole and none, doe differ much: meere contradictories cannot ſtand both together. 2. The law of nature 1. Cor. 9. 9.ſaies, thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne: cuſtome of ſome places doth not onely muzzle the teachers mouth, but cut his

throat, leauing him ſo ſmall a portion, as if it were to diet him for ſurfeit, not to reward him for ſeruice. 3. The law of nations ſaith, the labourer is worthie of his hire, and Chriſtendome hath determined this portion of wages; but cuſtome ſaith, we haue contrarie cuſtomes to all the world, late exemptions, other diſpenſations: and thus in effect we ſill vp the meaſure of thoſe auncient hypocrits, tranſgreſſing 
                  Matth. 15. 3.
                  the commaundement of God by our traditions.
               
               But of this point I will ſpeake no more, but referre the reader to the writings of Ma. Eburne, that Eburne.in 2. or 3. treatiſes hath taken good paines in this point, and conclude;
               If this plea will not be taken in Weſtminſter-hal, that we had a cuſtome in our pariſh not to come to ſeruice, nor to receiue the Sacraments, nor to keepe the Kings peace: how doe we thinke it will be taken at Gods tribunall ſeat at the dreadfull day of iuſtice, to plead the cuſtome was ſuch, where we had abode, to be impious, ſacrilegious, prophane, vnconſcionable, and cruell to God, and man; to abridge the Miniſter of his due, God of his ſeruice, our ſoules of their comfort? therefore be not deceiued, God is not 
                  Gal. 6. 7.
                  mocked; for whatſoeuer a man ſoweth that ſhall he reap; if to the fleſh corruption, if to the ſpirit life euerlaſting.
               
               But beſide cuſtome (which then when it tooke beginning, might haue ſome reaſon, though time hath now eat out thoſe letters,) there is coſenage alſo, pretending cuſtome, and it is not ſo; or detaining that which is moſt due, by palpable wrong, or coloured forgerie: in all which caſes the world is verie

prone to fauour themſelues; and the beſt cauiller againſt the Parſon, is reputed the beſt pariſhioner. Some plead that Tithes are not due, iure diuino, and therefore lawfull to catch what they can from him: but firſt as in a caſe of leſſe conſequence, when Plut.once it was ſtrongly avouched the enemy would not giue battel on that ſide; it was replied, but if he do, are we not then vndone? ſo I ſay here, if they be of diuine right, are we not then plaine robbers &amp; reſiſters of God? therefore as he, Stultum eſt in id periculi remconijcere, vbi ſi in credendo erraueris, nulla dabitur corrigendi copia: it is a mad venture to put the matter to ſuch a puſh, where if our iudgment be miſcaried, we are irrecouerably vndone. 2. Though that hath bin already proued▪ that Tithes, are due by diuine right, yet this cannot excuſe them from ſacriledge, that with a Si Spie, ſhall diminiſh the Miniſters portion: for now they are dedicated to holy vſe: therefore what God hath called holy, let no man dare to profane, or lay theeuiſh fingers vpon them. 3.

There was at Rome one Clodia, not all of the beſt report, who when the ſhip that brought vp Berecynthia the mother of the gods was ſtroke on ground as it paſſed vp the riuer, ſo as no ſtrength of hand, nor helpe of people could fetch her off, this honeſt Veſtall vpon her knees beſought the goddeſſe, that if ſhee were innocent of that imputation that was ſtrong vpon her, ſhe would be pleaſed to follow the guidance of her girdle; and ſo fitting the ſame vnto the pinnace, that which thouſands of hands, nor all the ſtrength of Rome could not effect, verie gently came off without more adoe: The like good lucke this cauſe in hand hath euer had; the deepeſt diſputes of learned ſchooles, which no wit could vnwind, like an other Gordius nodus; the ruſtieſt reaſon of a country farmer, can as eaſily ſnap in ſunder, as Samſon did his withes, or hempen bands.

                  Remember that proteſtation, little leſſe then an execration, which the people were ſolemnly to take at the end of euerie harueſt: When thou haſt made an Deut. 26. 13.end of tithing all the tithes of thy encreaſe, and haſt giuen it to the Leuite, &amp;c. that they may eate within thy gates,

and be filled: then thou ſhalt ſay before the Lord thy God, I haue brought the hallowed thing out of my houſe, and haue alſo giuen it to the Leuite, according to thy commaundement, which thou haſt commaunded me: I haue not tranſgreſſed thy commaundements, nor forgotten them; I haue not eaten thereof in my mourning, nor taken ought thereof for any common vſe, nor giuen ought thereof for the dead: but haue hearkned vnto the voice of the Lord my God, and haue done according to all that thou haſt commaunded me: looke downe out of thy holy habitation from heauen, and bleſſe thy people Iſrael (accordingly.) Now if I ſhould demand what law pertained this vnto: if to the Ceremoniall, it muſt prefigure ſomething in or vnder Chriſt; if Morall, it ſtands in force; if meerely Iudiciall, yet the equitie doth binde perpetually: ſo euery way it bindeth ſtill. And therefore as in triall of the ſuſpected wife, if ſhee were innocent, the potion made her fruitfull; if nocent, painefull; ſo is this oath, to true dealers with God and his miniſter profitable, to vniuſt detainers▪ damnable. And ſo I ende with them.

               THE laſt offenders that I will encounter, are ſuch Magnificoes and Gentlemen of eminencie, whom God or gold hath made Patrons of thoſe places where they haue their lands. Which right

how it was purchaſed, I diſpute not at this time: only thus much, in the times of ſuperſtition thoſe offices or priuiledges, together with the lands were devolued to the Abbies; and when the Abbies were ſuppreſſed, they became vulgare aucupium, very common game; and when all thoſe things were ſet to ſale by the drumme, then nemo non fecit lignationem, they that had monie and appetite caught vp theſe commodities: and ſo haue the patronages of the Church been ingroſſed into great mens hands, that oft times vſe them neither as patronages, nor things of the Church: for thoſe poore collations that ſhould be beſtowed vpon ſchollers, and were indeed depoſita pietatis, the pledges of pietie; doctrinae praemia, the rewards of learning; laborantium ſtipendia, the wages of holy workemen; and ſanctorum munera, the gifts of holy men, haue quite been put to other imployments, not giuen at all, or giuen to ſome old ſeruing men, or kept in the patrons owne hand, or ſore curtaild in the putting off, or ſaued for penſions for yonger ſonnes, or ſold in a market to the beſt chapmen; that we may truely verifie that quip of S. Gregorie, boues arant, &amp; aſini paſcuntur, laborious in Iob. 1.ſchollers take the paines, and idle drones eate vp the gaines.
               For the common ſort of Patrons haue vſed vs for all the world, as the Ieſuites do their nouices, whom they promiſe faire, till they haue put themſelus and their ſtates into their hands, and then they euer after vſe them in the nature of younger brethren: ſo do theſe newe maſters handle vs, who were once

free-men, and had ſomewhat of our owne; but now are turned out of our gownes into a lighter habit, by annexing the Church maintenance to their owne inheritance, and then feeding vs with pittances, as ſitting in the place of praier: or if they vſe vs any better then words, it is after we haue ſued our liuery, and fined for our match. But as Tully ſaies, Nullae ſunt occultiores inſidiae quàm quae latent in ſimulatione officij, there is no ſnare to that which goes vnder the ſhew of ſeruice.
               The firſt inſtitution of patronage in the Church, as is commonly in other caſes, (ex malis moribus, bonae leges) was excellent and neceſſarie: but as the faire ſtreames of Iordan fall into the dead ſea, ſo in the current of like Conueniences, through the fault or frailtie of mans nature, the verie beſt things degenerate: ſo fel it out here: for as it was ſaid of the Clergie, Religio peperit diuitias, ſed filia deuorauit matrem: ſo is it true of the laitie, the Church did firſt hatch them, but they haue eaten out the bellie of the dam.

                  Marſil. Patauinus in his defenſor pacis, hath ſet down their originall in this manner: Antiquitùs viri ſancti, &amp; miniſtri Euangelici, Chriſtum imitari volentes, contra nullum voluerunt contendere iudicio, &amp;c. In old time the holy men and ſincere miniſters of the Goſpel, deſirous to imitate Chriſt, would not conteſt in law with any, &amp;c. Therefore the proprietie of ſuch temporals as were appointed for their maintenance, remained in the founder or donor of holy demeanes; who beeing ſo ordained for the maintenance and defence of the Churches lands, were called the

Patrons thereof. For ſo ſoone as religion began to grow into ſome dimenſions, and the Church to get ſome matters of inheritance, enuie and auarice began to be too buſie about her, ſo as ſhee had much adoe to hold her owne, or recouer her right: and ſo faſt did the eagles follow her carrion, and the birds of pray ſtoope for bootie, that the decrees of almoſt 40. Synods and Councils, beſides decrees of the firſt Hoſpin.Popes, and Statutes of Emperors, were all too little to curbe their couetouſnes, or reſtraine the harpies from deuouring all, while the holy and heauenly minded Clergie, were loth to intangle themſelues with ſecular incumbrances, or giuing ouer their bookes, follow worldly profits. Whereupon to ſalue this ſore, it was decreed in the Councill Melevitanum, that a petition ſhould be drawn and preſented to the Emperours Arcadius and Honorius, that they would be pleaſed to appoint the Church certen delegates or Aduocates to defend their rights: the like was done at other times: who at the firſt did not beſtow the liuings, but onely defend their lands. And founders of new erections reſerued no other power in themſelues, but the bare Aduocation and preſentment to the place. It were too long and intricate to follow the mutations of the times, while ſometime the Donors, ſometime the Donees, ſometime the Patrons, and laſtly the Biſhops did manage all the buſines that way; till in the ende deuotion had ſurrendered all right into the hands of new erections, out of their zeale vnto the regular order of Friers: and ſo when the religious houſes were put downe,

theſe went alſo with the other lands into the fowlers net; and became euery mans purchaſe, as I ſaid before.
               Now what affinitie haue the moderne with the former patrons? if theſe be our defenders, who ſhall defend vs from our verie defenders? the Abuſe is euident, I need not open it; the Preſentor and preſentee haue changed offices; the ſcholler muſt preſent the patron with Church angels, or he ſhall not bee preſented Bern.to be an angel of the Church: qui primi debent eſſe ad ſubſidium, primi ſunt ad ſacrilegium: her prime ſuccours, are become her principall ſuckers; and cheifeſt pillars, the cheifeſt powlers. Our ſong of Venite exultemus, is turned to ſuper flumina Babylonis: Simon Magus hath ſucceeded Simon Peter: the buyers Ioh. 2.and ſellers, whom Chriſt whipped out of the temple, are let in againe at the poſterne doore.
               Which ſinne, although in proprietie of ſpeach it notes but the buyer, yet now the whole tranſaction of that market, is commonly ſo called; becauſe Simon Magus profered monie; not for any infuſion of grace vpon himſelfe, but for the multiplication of his coine to the beſt improouement, as diuines haue noted.
               And herein the Canoniſts haue obſerued many enormities, as Atheiſme, idolatrie, theft, and murder. 1. For making the Church, non domum oratioonis, ſed negotiationis, not a houſe of prayer, but a hole for prey. 2. For turning God into gold, and making not godlines their gaine, but ganie their godlines. 3. For robbing their pariſhes of the bread of

life. 4. Staruing the incumbent with vnrecouerable penurie of bodie, and periurie of ſoule, and the whole Parriſh with him, both of bodily releefe, and Ghoſtly life.

And therfore as I ſaid while ere, the Church is little beholden to ſuch patrons: for theſe reſemble the beutiful gate of the Temple, or faire porches of the poole of Betheſda, where lie a great number of Lazars, expecting the waters next motion, the Churches next promotion: wherein they haue faire occaſion to demerite both of God and men: for God, who ſees not how much he might be glorified, if that care were taken in the choiſe of a worthy preacher, that ought to be: and as for men, it is equally apparant, what

profit would redound to the world for inſtruction and edification. But in my poore vnderſtanding, in the neglect of this ſo pious ſeruice to God, and to his Church, as they are faultie and defectiue to both them, ſo no way more preiudicious then to themſelues; not onelie in the account that they ſhall one day giue of that ſtewardſhip, but in depriuing themſelues in the meane time, of a learned friend, a godly aſſociate, and a ghoſtly aduocate: for who is ſo fit to conuerſe familiarly with a gentle or noble man, then ſuch a miniſter, who both for his honeſt birth, and liberall breeding, ſweete learning, and wiſe counſelling, may be both an adiuvant for his ſoules health, as an ornament to his worldly ſtate. For if it be true, that ſcientia be vitae ſol, and amicitia vitae ſal, knowledge the light, and freindſhip the delight of this life; how darke and vnſauorie muſt his life needes be, that depriues himſelfe in the place where he doth or ſhould liue, of a learned counſellour, and friendly comforter.
               But how euer their owne occaſions may be to be called to higher places in their owne perſons, yet euery noble minded Moſes ſhould labour to remooue this ſtone, which the enuyous Madianites haue rowled vpon the wells mouth, that the Lords flockes may be ſeaſonably watered; leaſt that both for the preſent, the world be peſtered with idol-ſhepheards, that haue eies and ſee not, eares and heare not, tongues and ſpeake not, of which the Prophet ſpeaketh, Pſal. 115.
                  They that make them are like vnto them; and in the next age, the world be ouergrowne with barbarouſnes,

rouſnes, to the vtter preiudice both of Church and commonwealth.
               All which, as me ſeemes, were not hard to be helped, if either the oath of Simonie were equally tendered to Patron and petitioner, or all preſentations to Churches were in the hands of Colledges and Vniuerſities, where no ſuch corruption, for the multitude of the ſuffrages were to be feared. Whereupon further conueniences would likewiſe accrew; both the making roome for younger ſchollers, and ridding the ſprings of old ſtudents, which lie there in great number, ſome 20, 30, 40. yeares, to their own greife, and the Churches loſſe, but to vpbraid the world of the times iniquitie, and learnings miſerie. And ſo much concerning the abuſes.

               Of the ſeuerall vſes of this doctrine.
               
                  AS they that haue been preſent, at ſome dolefull tragedie, or ſolemne exequie of ſome of their deareſt friends, executed for cauſes criminall; eſpecially, if they themſelues haue been any way acceſſarie to the ſame, cannot but be much affected, both ſleeping affrighted with melancholie viſions, and waking aſtarted with dumpiſh paſſions, which leaue the impreſſions of verie ſad remembrance long time after in their minds: ſo we that here haue had not the diſmall ſtorie related, but the deadly ſpectacle of Ananias and Sapphiraes ſuffering, as if it were euen acted before our eies, neere friends of ours, I am aſſured, aſſociats and copartners in wicked ſacriledge; if we be not void of all humanitie, it muſt of force affect vs very deepely, and peirce our hearts to the very quicke, with a true prognoſticate of our end and iudgement.

                     . Sam. 2▪ 23. Therefore like Ioabs men that followed the chace vpon Abners hoſt, when they came to the place where Aſael lay wallowing in his blood, there made

a ſtand, in wonder &amp; pitie how ſo braue a man came to ſo bloodie a death: ſo let vs make a pauſe at Ananias graue, and in wonder and horror ſomewhat chew vpon the matter, and frame the argument but in this manner to our ſelues.
               1. If Ananias, that might otherwiſe be a good man, at leſt one ciuilly righteous, and outwardly religious enough, fauouring good men, and countenancing good matters:
               2. If he that committed this ſinne but once in all his life, and made no trade of it, nor liuing in it as in a knowne ſinne, either yeeres or monthes, as we doe:
               3. That did it not in ſo high a meaſure, nor ſo heinous manner, by the lumpe and the load as we doe, not mincing one manner onely, but mouthing many:
               4. That had no example before his eies of the wrath of God againſt that ſinne, no Ananias and Sapphira ſtroke dead before his face, to feare him from it, at leſt ſo fully:
               5. That had not the meanes of conuincing his conſcience by Scriptures or arguments, by examples or euidences, of the fowlneſſe of the fact, as we haue had ſo plainely:
               6. That did not profeſſe it in the ſight of the ſun, nor bolſter it vp with open conreſtations, nor blanch it off with fearefull execrations, as many of vs haue done:
               7. If ſhee that came in but as acceſſarie onely, and vpon the by, for her husbands ſake alone; which

humane lawe would either approoue, or at leaſt not puniſh:
               8. Laſtly, if they that faulted in a matter of their owne donation, wherunto no law did enforce them, no bond compell them, but their owne free mindes and voluntary promiſe: If they I ſay, had ſo heauie a doome, as not to die the common death of other men, nor to be viſited after the viſitation of other folke; but that God did ſhew a new worke vpon them, a ſtrange example, a fearefull iudgement, to ſtrike them dead, to kill them preſently, to ſlay them ſuddenly, to denie them repentance, to curſe them with an euerlaſting curſe, to ſammatize them as hath been ſhewed: then let vs make a true commenſuration of our owne demerits, and bethinke our ſelues, how we ſhall eſcape, that haue all things contrary, and oppoſite in direct angles, in compariſon of them.
               1. As in whom there is no goodneſſe at all, not ſo much as demure carriage to extenuate our ſinnes, or 
                     •
                  lcuate our iudgement in the leaſt reſpect with God or the world.
               2. That doe no ſeruice all our life long, from the cradle to the graue; but many ſtudy how to wrong God and rifle his Church, ſorrowing for nothing but that they ſinne no more.
               3. That offend not onely in tanto, but in toto, enuying our Miniſters halfe a liuing, but ſwallowing our ſelues many Churches, in act or in deſire the meane while.
               4. That ſinne not of ignorance, as he might; but

of malice: not of infirmitie, but of preſumption; nor confeſſing it with repentance, but profeſſing it with obſtinance.
               5. That haue not one Ananias before our eyes, but many; nor ſingle men, but millions confounded with iudgements, and howling out of hell, Diſcite iuſtitiam moniti, &amp; non tem
                        •
                     ere diuos.
               
               6. That come not to our purpoſe with ſingle impietie, but with fraud and oppreſſion, with oaths and peierations, as if ſacriledge were not ſufficient without ſuch milſtones to ſinke vs to hell.
               7. That come not in as acceſſaries onely, for others companie, but breaking the yce, and ſhewing example as prime and principall, onely ſorrie we ſin no more.
               8. That doe no good our ſelues, non ſuffer other: but doing ill our ſelues, and teaching other: that inuade the holy patrimonie our ſelues, and perſwade other; that giue nothing our ſelues, but robbe others.
               Theſe and many more the like conſiderations, which we may repreſent vnto our ſelues, ſhould be ſo many arguments to diſſwade vs, ſo many thunderbolts to feare vs, not ratling in our eares onely, but battering our conſcience alſo, and tearing our ſoules with the fearefull expectance of deſerued vengeance.
               If we ſhould but thus enforce this argument, from their action to our inſtruction, it could not but ſtartle and amaze a great number, that now lie and die in a maine peice of Athciſme, without all ſenſe or remorſe;

and ſo goe downe to hell, before they once know what they doe: qui tantum non audit fragorem, 
                  Auguſt.
                  non dormit ſed mortuus eſt: hee that heares not this peice of ordnance, is not aſleepe, but ſtarke dead; wants not ſo much ſence, as ſoule; is not a man, but a verie monſter.
               S. Auguſtine doth teach vs this inſtruction, ſaying of the rich glutton, Si ſterilitas in ignem mittitur, rapacitas quid meretur? &amp; ſi qui ſua non dedit, ſemper ardebit; quid recipiet is qui aliena tulit? If vnfruitful men ſhall be caſt into hell, what doe they that are iniurious deſerue? and if hee ſhall burne in euerlaſting flames, that gaue nothing of his owne, how ſhall he be ſaued, that takes away that which is other mens? and if he be ſo fearefully puniſhed that offends in a little, what hell of hels ſhall ſuffice for ſuch as robbe and rifle all that is holy? bereauing almightie God of his worſhip and ſeruice, the Church of God of that which is ſanctified to religion, the Saints of God of the inſtruments of ſaluation? for this ſinne muſt be apparelled in his own circumſtances, things conſecrate by holy men, dedicated to almightie God, ſo peculiar vnto his ſeruice, ſinning with ſo high a hand, impoueriſhing our ſoules ſoliciters, in famiſhing many hundreds of bodily &amp; ghoſtly prouiſion, defrauding our ſelues of the bread of life, and many ſuch like. Well then to come to the particular vſes.

                      1. The firſt is feare againſt ſecuritie: this is taught vs out of the fearefull iudgement that fell vpon Ananias, and the prime vſe that the congregation made

of the ſame what effect it did worke, namely to affect and raiſe ſome paſſion in the heart in generall. Secondly, what that was in particular, the affection of feare. Thirdly, the meaſure or extenſion, great feare. Fourthly, the ſubiect in whom, in thoſe that heard it. And laſtly, the vniuerſalitie of the ſubiect, not one, or two, or a few, but all, ſo many as heard thoſe things.
               
               
                  Exod. 14. 31. The like we find in other places: the like impreſſion vpon the like occaſion when the Iſraelites ſaw the great worke of the Lord vpon the Egyptians; it is noted, that the people feared the Lord, and beleeued the Lord, &amp; his ſeruant Moſes: the ſame is obſerued of Dauid in the ſudden breach of Vzza, Dauid was afraid of

                  the Lord that day, ſo that he durſt not bring home the Arke to his houſe: many like examples are extant in the holy Pages.
               The reaſon is this, we neuer feare God ſo well, as when we are awaked with his thunders, and rouſed with his iudgements; for euery affection muſt be raiſed by his proper obiect; loue by his mercies, hope by his promiſes, truſt by his prouidence, and feare by his iudgements.
               
                  Now in his iudgements, God is ſet out vnto vs as a terrible God, a conſuming fire: and therefore a fearefull Heb. 12. Heb. 10.thing to fall into his hands: therefore the Apoſtles admoniſh vs, Paul, to worke out our ſaluation with feare Phil. 2. 12.and trembling, and Peter, for as much as we call him Father, 1. Pet. 1. 17.that without reſpect of perſons iudgeth according to euerie mans worke, to paſſe the time of our pilgrimage here in feare.

Firſt, of proud knowledge, or preſumption; a knowledge without the feeling, a bare ſpeculation, without anſwearable affection, that which God doth ſo oft complaine of, Eſa.

               The ſecond is hardnes of heart, that when his iudgements be thundered we feare not, when his mercies are proclamed we reioyce not, when exhortations are vſed we mooue not, as the wiſe man E

                     cl. 8. 11.ſaith, Becauſe ſentence againſt euill works, is not preſently executed, therefore the hearts of the children of men are ſet to doe euill: that which we heare doth little profit vs, for ſtill we thinke (as we heard out of Plato) that Gods words are vntrue, or his arme is but weake. For the firſt, he that hath verified all his prophecies and promiſes hitherto, why ſhould we doubt of the effect of his threats to ſinne? if all is not performed in our time, yet there is another place to conſummate his word, and make good his promiſes.
               For the ſecond, he that put downe both all the Monarches and Magicians of the world, with the

production of the leſt vermine, the worke of his little finger; how ſhould he be impotent or weake in auenging on vs, whatſoeuer we doe ſinne? the burning of the world is but the breath of his noſtrils: and if all this be little, he can arme himſelfe with deadly weapons, bows, ſwords, ſpeeres, armies of creatures, chariots of fire, millions of angels: and if this alſo be yet but little, he is purtraied moreouer as a Gyant, and that armed cap a pe, as a Lion; nay all that is ſtrong, a Iudge, a Generall, a Prince, a God.
               Againe, if he be weake, who are we, or what is our ſtrength? not ſuch as hee needes to come againſt vs with all his power, with crowes of iron, or greateſt ordnance, but with graſſes, ſtrawes, haires, wormes; &amp; if they ſhould alſo be to ſeeke, but to commit vs together, &amp; daſh vs one againſt another; therefore we are to feare him in himſelfe, much more when he ariſeth to rage, when he ſpeaketh, threatneth, ſtriketh.
               The priſoner that is attached for criminall cauſes, feareth the comming of the iudge: the idolater, that is not in his religion ſecured feareth before his painted timber or ſtone: the deuill that is aſcertained of his torment, feareth at the thought of his iudge and God: therefore he that feareth not God, making his ſword drunken with ſinners blood, is more deſperate then the ruffian, more doltiſh then the idolater, more damnable then the verie deuill: and this ſhall ſerue for the firſt vſe.
               
                  Catal. teſt. 2. Care againſt impietie: it hath been obſerued by

wiſe men, that the word Conſcientia hath in all times had very hard ſucceſſe, ſo that it neuer could be full written together in all his ſyllables: for in the firſt nonage of the Church, the primer times, they had Con and Sci, but wanted entia: for as another ſaith, they had aureos ſacerdotes, but lignea vaſa, golden chaplaines, and wooden chalices, good conſcience, and great learning, but ſmall reuennewes. The middle times had Con and entia, but wanted Sci; honeſtie and honour, but little or no learning. Theſe laſt ages wherein we liue, haue aboundance of the Sci, but haue loſt both Con and Entia, learning Gods plentie, but our good meaning and good meanes are gone one to ſeeke the other: In which regard our pietie is become very proportionable to our charitie, cold and comfortleſſe, like the Doctors recipes, which Demoſthenes 
                  Demoſt.ſpeaks of, neither ſo ſufficient to keep aliue, nor ſo deficient to let vs die.
               It is an error, I may ſay an hereſie, to thinke that loſt that goes to God. There began Iudas treaſon, at quorſum perditio haec? to what purpoſe is all this waſt?

To ſay thus much;
               
               Wo be to this generation becauſe of the leauen of the Phariſies, which is hypocriſie, at leaſt if that may be called hypocriſie, which for the generalitie cannot, for the impudencie cares not any longer to be concealed. There is at this day a diſeaſe ſpread ouer the whole bodie of the Church, and the further the more deſperate, the more ſecret the more dangerous. If it were an open enemie that had riſen vp againſt her, he might haue beene caſt out, and haue withered: if a violent perſecutor, ſhe could haue hid her ſelfe from him: now whom ſhould ſhe caſt out, or from whom be hid? all are friends, but all vnfriendly;

all of kind, but all vnkind; all of a houſe, yet none at peace; all neere neighbours, but neereſt to themſelues; they adorne themſelues with the holy inheritance, yet honour not the holy of holies. It was long ſince prophecied, and now fulfilled: Behold, in my greateſt peace, is my bittereſt perſecution: bitter it was in the death of my martyrs, more bitter in doing with heretickes, but moſt bitter in the manners of familiars. It is peace, and it is not peace: peace from the Ethnick, peace from the heretike, but not from the hypocrite. I may iuſtly take vs that complaint; I haue nouriſhed and brought vp children, but they haue deſpiſed me; both deſpiſed and deſpited me, with their faultie life, with their filthy lucre, with their fowle contracts, couetouſnes, ſacriledge, and ſymonie. What remaines more, but that that man of ſinne, the day-light deuill ſhould be reuealed? Thus farre he. The like doth Venerable Bede in his ſcintillae, to which I referre you.

                  Verona, his diſſwaſiue to the ſtate of Venice, wherein he doth demonſtrate, that euer ſince they took courſes to enrich thēſelues with the ſpoiles of the Churches, (wherein they were fowly tainted, as Paulus Iouius 
                  Iouius 12.doth ſet downe, in one warre againſt the Turks impoſing fiue tenths vpon the Clergie, to pay ſaylers wages: and Rentius their Generall, ſpoyled the Churches of their iuriſdiction, as at Bergamo, to the very bels, which they caſt for Canons and Culuerins to ſerue in the wars: and what could the Turke haue done more) that euer ſince, I ſay, ſuch their ſacrilegious

dealing they neuer proſpered, but loſt to the Turke, loſt to their neighbours, went downeward ſtrangely both at home and abroad, and were neuer able to ſtand on their legs, as they had done before. But I deſcend to lower times: for as to the former I may well vſe the by-word, Bernardus non vidit omnia: and as to the latter, Bede in compariſon of vs, had no cauſe to betake him to his beads.
               
                  D. Luther of the places and times of reformation, In Gal. 6. 6.ſaies thus; I haue often wondered why the Apoſtle ſo oft and earneſtly exhorteth the Churches to nouriſh their teachers: for in the time of Popery, I ſaw all men giue frankly to the building and the guilding of their gorgious temples, to the liberall maintaining of the idolatrous ſeruice; ſo that the Clergie euery where poſſeſſed the moſt and beſt lands of all countries; in ſo much that I thought it ſuperfluous for God to giue any ſuch commaundement, for as much as they abounded and ſuper-abounded with plentie of all things. I thought it more needefull to perſwade men to hold their hands, then to giue any more: for I obſerued how by this exceſſiue liberality, the couetouſneſſe of the Clergie did but more encreaſe, and the reſt of the world grew very poore. But now I ſee the reaſon why they did abound in that meaſure, and wee on the contrary ſuffer ſo much want. In former time, when nothing elſe was taught but error and idolatrie, they grew ſo wealthy, that of Peters patrimonie (when himſelfe had neither ſiluer nor gold) the Popes had aduanced themſelues aboue Emperours, Cardinals aboue Kings, Biſhops

aboue Princes: but ſince the time that the Goſpell came in, preachers haue euer been as poore as euer Chriſt was. We finde then by lamentable experience, how neceſſarie this precept of well maintaining the miniſters, is in the world: which Paul both here and elſewhere ſo inſiſts in, and beates vpon. Therefore when I read this exhortation of Paul, I both muſe and bluſh, that ſo great an Apoſtle ſhould vſe ſo many words about this matter. I would bee loth to ſlaunder and defame this countrie, which is nothing in compariſon of Corinth, which hee ſo much ſhamed by begging for the miniſters and the Saints. But this I ſee is the lot of the Goſpel, that not only no man is forward to giue to ſchollers and the Clergie, but euery man is ready to ſpoyle and take away that which they haue. In briefe, men ſeeme to degenerate to ſauage and cruell beaſts: for all the while that men did teach and preach vnto them the doctrine of deuills, they were open-handed euen to prodigalitie to thoſe deceiuers; but to thoſe that deale the word of God ſincerely, they enuie that they haue, and thinke euery thing too much.
               By which we perceiue how neceſſarie this exhortation is, euen to true profeſſors: Sathan can abide nothing worſe then the light of the Goſpel; which when he ſees to breake forth, hee labours tooth and nayle to hinder it, both by falſe ſpirits, and bloodie perſecutions, and famiſhing vp the teachers. And becauſe he could not here ſuppreſſe it by any of the former meanes, of falſe doctrine, or oppoſition, he attempteth it by the latter, by withdrawing the liuing

of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, to cauſe them by pouertie and neceſſitie to forſake their ſtanding; and ſo the people wanting inſtructors, to grow wild and wicked. This deuiſe the deuil ſets forward by wicked magiſtrates in cities and townes, noblemen and gentlemen in the country, who take away the Churches reuenewes, whereby the miniſters ſhould bee maintained, and conuert them to profanenes; as the Micah. 1. 7.Prophet Micah complaineth, from the hire of an harlot it came, and to the hire of an harlot it ſhall returne again. Some other he diuerteth from the Goſpel with too much abundance: for when the word of God is plentifully taught, many fall a loathing and neglecting of it; and fewe will ſet their ſonnes to ſchoole, or to diuinitie, but apply them rather to more gainfull trades.
               It is not then without need that Paul warnes all Auditors, to communicate with their Paſtors in all their goods, it being ſit and equal to requite ſpiritual things with temporall. But both Court and country, towne and citie, doth abuſe this doctrine at this day, vnder colour thereof to inrich themſelues.
               In Poperie great ſummes were giuen vnto the Prieſts for maſſes, dirges, trentals, and ſuch traſh: begging Friers had likewiſe their ſhares, beſides that which pardons, indulgences, and other Antichriſtian merchandize carried away: from theſe and a number more the like extortions, we are freed by the Goſpell: but we are ſo farre from thankefulneſſe to God, that of prodigall giuers, we are become ſacrilegious takers, and grow lame-handed for beſtowing any

thing vpon the religion and Saints of God; which is an infallible token, that men haue loſt both the word, and ſaith, and all goodneſſe together: for it is impoſſible for ſuch as are religious indeede, to ſee their Paſtors liue in want and neceſſitie. For as much then as they ioy to ſee their miniſters bare and poore, keeping their liuings from them, or not paying them ſo ſincerely as they ſhould; it is more then manifeſt that they are worſe then the very heathen. But they ſhall feele ere long, what will followe vpon this in gratitude, by the loſſe both of temporall and ſpirituall bleſſings: for it is impoſſible but this ſinne muſt bee both ſpeedily and heauily auenged: and I am perſwaded that the Churches of Galatia, Corinth, and the reſt were ſo peſtered with falſe Apoſtles, for no other cauſe but the ſmall account they made of their true teachers: for it is a iuſt reward, that they that wil not giue a penie to God, the author of all bleſſings and goodneſſe, ſhould giue pounds to the deuill, the author of all euill, and euerlaſting miſerie: and that hee that will not ſerue God with a little to his owne eternall renumeration, ſhould ſerue the deuil with much to his vtter and ineuitable confuſion.
               Neuertheleſſe it is not the Apoſtles meaning that men ſhould giue away all that they haue, but onely ſuch liberall maintenance, that their Miniſters may liue in honeſt and decent faſhion. And this he proſecuteth further, adding a fearefull commination to his former reproofe and exhortation, ſaying, God is not mocked: where he toucheth to the quicke the peruerſeneſſe of men, who proudly and profanely deſpiſe

their miniſters, and make themſelues ſport with their miſeries: as great men for the moſt part doe, that make their Paſtors their very abiects and vaſſals; ſo that if we had not a godly Prince, we had long ere this been driuen out of the Country. For when the Paſtors demaund their dues, or complaine of their wants, the faſhion of men is to exclaime, that Prieſts are couetous, and would haue they know not what; no man is able to ſatisfie their asking: if they were true Goſpellers indeede, they ſhould poſſeſſe nothing, but in great perfection follow their maſter Chriſt. Therefore the Apoſtle grieuouſly threatneth ſuch mockers and blaſphemers, ſo deſpitefully and inhumanely ſcorning and inſulting on their poore miniſters; yet forſooth will ſeem great goſpellers: as if hee ſhould ſay, Beware you deſpiſers, although God deferre his puniſhment for a ſeaſon, yen in his good time he will finde you out, and puniſh▪ you for this profaneneſſe, and hate againſt his miniſters: you deceiue not him but your ſelues; and your wrong will not pertaine to him, but returne into your boſome.
               And yet our proud Gentlemen, and Citizens, are little mooued with theſe dreadfull threats, who at their death ſhall well vnderſtand, that they haue not mocked vs but themſelues: in the mean time, howſoeuer ſuperciliouſly they laugh at our preſent admonitions, we will ſpeake this to our owne comfort, knowing it is better to receiue, then to infer wrong: for patience is euer ioyned with innocence, and God will not ſuffer vs to want, but when the Lions

ſhall lacke, we ſhall haue enough. Thus far that great and worthie man of God, D. Luther, whoſe pen and paines God did ſo powerfully vſe and bleſſe in the worke of the reſtauration of the world. Vnto whom I will adioyne another great inſtrument of Gods glorie and the light of his Church, Iohn Caluin▪
                   whoſe name hath terror attending on it in the Kingdome of Poperie to this day. Where let me obſerue one thing very remarkeable, that theſe great Saints, ſo mightie in▪word and deed, yet hauing done what was in men to doe, againſt falſe doctrine, yet could neuer put out this inbred irreligion: as if this ſinne were in the Church, as it is written of the heart in the bodie, primum viuens &amp; vltimum moriens: or like death, the firſt and laſt enemie we ſhould encounter. But what ſaith M. Caluin, we muſt needs confeſſe in Act 4. 34.that our bowels are of iron, and our hearts of braſſe, that are no more touched with the reading of this ſtory, where the faithfull giue ſo bountifully that which they had: whereas we at this day cannot be content, to hold our owne hands from giuing any thing onely, but moſt iniuriouſly take away alſo that which is giuen by other: they did ſimply and honeſtly dedicate their owne; we deuiſe a thouſand euill ſhifts to hooke and catch, that which other haue beſtowed: they laid downe theirs at the Apoſtles feete, we take from thence that which is giuen to God: there men ſold their poſſeſſions to giue to godly vſes, here wee buy and purchaſe all we can: then euerie one gaue ſomewhat to the Church and the poore, now men are ſo inhumane, that they enuie

the poore, the commoneſt things of this life, the very Elements of nature: this muſt ſhame vs, and teach vs another leſſon, &amp;c. ſo M. Caluin.

                  M. William Perkins, whom I may terme in ſome ſort the Father of the Prophets, or at leſt, a learned man that finiſhed that worke of his, (but out of his notes) as I take it, complaineth in this manner; We may hence collect (ſaith he) the great want of deuotion in the moſt men of theſe dayes: for as the c

                  ie of the poore in the ſtreetes, is an argument of the lacke of mercie among vs; ſo the number of the needie and wandering Leuites, which offer themſelues to ſerue for a morſell of bread, and a ſute of apparell, is a pregnant proofe, there is no deuotion for the maintenance of religion, eſpecially in thoſe that are ſo ſtraight laced, in beſtowing any thing for the good of Gods Miniſters, and yet in keeping of hounds and hawks, and worſe matters, players, and ieſters, yea, fooles and flatterers, are lauiſh and profuſe. This hath bin the practiſe of the world, and the condition of the Miniſters in all times. 400 falſe prophets were well and plentifully prouided for at Iezabels table, when the true Prophets of God in the meane time were driuen to hide their heads, hauing ſcarce bread and water to liue vpon, and that alſo not without danger of their liues: her practiſe ſhall condemne a number of our profeſſours: Nay, our forefathers zeale and forwardnes, notwithſtanding their great blindnes, ſhal condemne our coldnes in this behalfe. The very ſtones and rubbiſh of the ruined Abbies,

aud other religious houſes ſhall riſe vp againſt vs: for they maintained 30. or 40. idle bellies moſt of them, which did nothing but nuzzle them in idolatrie and ignorance, where now the ſame place will not mainetaine one competent Preacher to inſtruct their ſoules vnto ſaluation: for we take from the Church faſter then they gaue it.
               In the old time the ſaying was, what ſhal we bring to the Seer or man of God? but now the wicked rob-gods ſay, come let vs take the houſes of God for our poſſeſſions. The Iewes were euen prodigall in their contributions to the tabernacle, offring more then enough, ſo as they needed to be inhibited with the ſound of the drumme and proclamation, (as our forefathers alſo were by the ſtatute of Mortmaine:) this lauiſh giuing to the materiall temple, ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt our little giuing to the ſpirituall miniſtrie, the liuing temple of God; nay our taking away from it, being far better then the Leuiticall Prieſthood: for looke by how much God hath diminiſhed the coſt of the altar, and the charge of the ceremonious worſhip of the old Teſtament, ſo much more liberally doth he looke to haue the miniſterie maintained, and the ſpirituall worſhip furthered in the new.
               Laſtly, if they that helpe not to vphold the miniſterie ſhall be condemned, what ſhall become of them that rob the Church of her reuenewes, and deuoure the holy things? And thus much of that matter.
            
            
               
               CHAP. III.
               A diſſwaſiue to all men not to meddle with things deuoted.
               NOw here I deſire all men to conſider, how preiudiciall it is vnto the Goſpel, how diſhonourable to God, iniurious to his ſeruitours, ignominious to our countrie, and diſpendious to our owne ſaluation, to beggar and diſtreſſe thoſe, that for their worke ſake, ſhould be had in high eſteeme and worthy reputation. If a man ſhould by couenant and oath binde himſelfe vnto the deuill, to doe his v

                  moſt endeauour and faithfulleſt ſeruice, in oppugning and ruining the kingdome of Chriſt, he could neuer deuiſe to attempt it more directly, then by driuing &amp; compelling the Miniſters of God to ſuch ſtraights and difficulties; that wanting conuenient maintenance, they muſt be forced to giue ouer that function, or neuer vndertake it, flying ouer-ſea to Rome, or Rhemes, or Amſterdam for more liberall allowance and meanes of maintenance: or if not ſo, betake himſelfe to ſome baſe and illiberall trade for better ſupportation: or laſt of all, as bad as any, to perſiſt in the calling without incouragement or comfort, exerciſing the ſame neither with profit to other, not with content to themſelues: ſo that neither themſelues can doe any good in it, and other are kept off from it, as not being ouer-willing to buy miſerie and contempt at ſo high a rate. Now what

is this but a part of that perſecution, which Iulian ſometime raiſed againſt the Church, by depriuing the Clergie of their preferments, the miniſters of their maintenance, and the Preachers of their ſalaries; by which meanes he did more hurt to Chriſtianitie in one yeare, then many of his predeceſſours had done by ſeeking their blood; in many: for as one hath obſerued, he did tollere presbyteriū, but they preſbyteros; ſo doe they that by any coloured forgerie, or profeſſed impietie, doe wreſt or detaine from the Clergie their iuſt inheritance: they plucke the ſunne out of the firmament, bring idol-ſhepheards into the Church, depriue Gods people of inſtruction, themſelues of ſaluation.
               Therefore in this one peice of ſeruice, God ſeemes to haue placed life and death, bleſſing and curſing: that, in the kinde and conſcionable vſage of the men and matters of God: this, in the wronging, and ſadding of them.
               
                  Conſider ſome paſſages of holy ſcripture to this effect: The Prophet repeating ſome iudgements of God to the people, ſpeaketh thus; I will come neere to Mal. 3. 5.you to iudgement, and I will be a ſwift witnes againſt the ſoothſaier, the falſe ſwearer, the adulterer, and thoſe that wrongfully keep backe the hirelings wages, and vexe the widow, the fatherles, and the ſtranger, and feare not me, ſaith the Lord of hoſts: Now what this defrauding is, 
                  Iam. 5. 1.
                  and who be thoſe labourers is ſeene in that which followeth, v. 8. Will a man ſpoile his Gods? yet you haue ſpoiled me, and ſay, wherein haue we ſpoiled thee? in tithes and offrings: ye are curſed with a curſe, for ye haue ſpoiled

me, euen this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the ſtorehouſe, that there may be meat in my houſe, and prooue me now herewith ſaith the Lord of hoſts, if I will not open the windowes of heauen vnto you, and power you out a bleſſing without meaſure. And I will rebuke the deuourer for your ſakes, and he ſhall not deſtroy the fruit of your ground, neither ſhall your vine be barren in the field, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.
               
                  Pro 3. 9. 
                  The like hath Salomon, Honour the Lord with thy riches, and the firſt fruit of all thine encreaſe; ſo ſhall thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy preſſes ſhall burſt Eccle: 35 1.with new wine. And Salomons imitator, Who ſo keepeth the law, bringeth offrings enough, and thou ſhalt not appeare emptie before the Lord: for all theſe things are done becauſe of the commaundement: the offring of the righteous maketh the altar fat, and the ſmell thereof is ſweet before the moſt high. v. 8. Giue the Lord his honour with a good and liberall eye, and diminiſh not the firſt fruit of thy hands: in all thy gifts ſhew a ioyfull countenance, and dedicate thy tithes with gladnes giue vnto the moſt high according as he hath inriched thee, and looke what thy hand is able, giue with a cheerfull eye: for the Lord recompenceth and will giue thee ſeuen times as much. Now by the way to explicate this, the learned haue obſerued, that the Iewes did firſt pay their firſt fruits: ſecondly, thereuma or leuatio: and thirdly, a twofold tyth, the greater, &amp; the leſſe. Now the thereuma might not be leſſe then the fourth, fift, or ſixt part: and theſe they called of a good eie, an indifferent, an euil eie.
               
               The tythe againe (S. Hierom writes) was of fowre ſorts: the 1. to the Leuite, the 2. from the Leuite to

the Prieſt, the 3. to the Lord at Hieruſalem, the 4. to the poore euery third yeere: which beeing not perceiued of ſome reuerend men of late times, bred in them this errour, that tithes are Iudaicall, becauſe they were to goe to the poore once in three yeares: which was but one kinde of Tithes, not the whole genus of them, as this father hath ſhewed. This for the good and euill eie, which Syracides ſo beateth vpon.
               
                  Ser. de temp. 219. 
                  S. Auguſtine doth mightily inforce this matter: Deus qui totum dare dignatus eſt, decimam dignatus est accipere, non ſibi ſed nobis profuturam: he that vouchſafeth to giue vs all we haue, is pleaſed yet to keep the tenth himſelfe, not for his profit, but for ours: O homines ſtulti, quid mali imperat Deus, vt non mercatur audiri? fooliſh men, what hurt is there in his demand, that he ſhould not be thought worthy to bee heard? thou doeſt not giue it, but ſhalt receiue it again with aduantage. Sith then by paying thy tithes, thou gaineſt both heauenly and earthly bleſſings, why doeſt thou ſ

                  and in thine owne light by thy niggarddize and follie? Heare you this, O you prophane worldlings; all that you haue is his, and will you not let him haue his owne? hee askes no gift at thy hand, but that which may bee for thy good; he begs no almes, but askes his honour: the tythes and firſt fruits are not thine but his, &amp; yet thou holdeſt them from him. What wouldſt thou doe if he ſhould giue thee but one of tenne, and retaine the 9. to himſelfe, as he doth by reſtraining the bleſſed ſhowres, ſo that thy harueſt is ſtarued with drowt, or nipped with

froſt: Quidigitur auidè ſupputas, ideo tibi nouem partes detractae ſunt, quia tu decimam dare noluiſti: why doeſt thou caſt thy reckoning on thy fingers ends? thou looſeſt 9. parts for denying the tenth: haec eſt enim Dei iuſtiſſima conſuetudo, ſi tu decimam dare nolueris, tu ad decimam reuoceris: ſo God vſeth to deale with them that denie him his tenth, to leaue him nothing but the tenth to liue on: Dabis impio militi quod non vis dare ſacerdoti, thou ſhalt giue to the extortioner, which thou wilt not giue to thy Miniſter. This and much more S. Auguſtine in the ſame place.
               
                  Hom. 48. And againe in an other place, bringing in a man pleading his charge of children, he ſaith thus; quam curam agis filiorum, vt eos obruas lachrymis miſerorum? nolo ſic prouideas, vt magis inuideas: ſic enim Salomon, qui congregat aliena, relinquit filio dolorem: what care is this thou takeſt for thy children, to ouerthrow them with the teares of poore men? I would not haue thee ſo prouide for them, that thou ſhouldſt rather ſeeme to enuie them: for Salomon ſaies, He that gathereth other mens goods, leaues nothing but griefe vnto his child. It was ſaid by Chriſt, Giue to Caeſar that which is Caeſars, &amp; giue to God that which is Gods: for therfore our anceſtors abounded in all wealth, becauſe they paid their tithes to God, and their tributes to Caeſar.
               In all which regards the Iewes, who of all the world were both the moſt bountifull, and the moſt true tithers of all their goods, called that action diuitiarum ſaepem, the fence of all their fortunes: and to that purpoſe haue to this day a prouerbe amongſt them, decima vt diues fias, the onely way to thriue

well, is to tythe well. For which cauſe the Canoniſts alſo make it a ruled caſe, that a man not thriuing vpon his liuing, if he be ſuch as, hath been noted backward in payment of Church duties, his Land-lord is not bound in equitie to abate his rent, becauſe it is to be preſumed, that his pouertie is from the hand of God to puniſh his ill dealing that way. Which opinion doth reſide yet in the Iewes to this day, and ſome elder Chriſtians, who are ſcrupulous or rather almoſt ſuperſtitious in this matter, who paying their duties iuſtly, and fearing to poſſeſſe any of the Churches demeanes moſt conſcionably, will riſe vp in iudgement againſt many of vs, of righter religion and deeper learning: which part of Gods feare beeing raced out of many of our hearts, makes vs to defile our hands with holy pillage, and ſecretly drawe downe the iudgements of God vpon our ſelues and our ſucceſſors, without any knowledge, or ar leaſt acknowledgement of the true cauſe, as Achan that troubled both his owne houſe and all Iſrael, by ſuch vngratefull iniurie, and iniurious ingratitude to God and his Church.
               I heard it once in ſome earneſt lamented, that the goodly copes, &amp; rich accouſtrements of the Church haue been a long time ſicke of a conſumption, and kept their chamber, and as it were ſometimes to take aire, would looke out at the windowes, like priſoners at a grate, as bewailing their long and vndeſerued durance: whereunto one more merily then bitterly did ſtrait reply, that it was no maruell: for fooles did firſt bring them in, and knaues had againe

carried them out. I cenſure not the ſarcaſme, but I thinke they were not ſo fooliſh that endowed the Church with ſuch as then ſeemed ſuperfluous ornaments; as they faultie, that (with them) haue bereft the Church of her neceſſarie habiliments.

That which our Sauiour ſaid was onely neceſſarie, we hold the onely vnneceſſarie: But God forbid that theſe ſhould bee the bloſſomes of our religion, to rob God of his honour, his Church of her reuenewes, our ſoules of ſelfecomforts, and heauen of her inhabitants. Yet this is not the worſt: for when we complaine vs of our greiuance, we are ſcoffed at with Iulians ſarcaſmes; who when the Chriſtians craued redreſſe of their wrongs; would anſwer them, Your Maſter bad you vſe patience, that when one tooke your cloake, you ſhould giue him your coate alſo: ſo are we preached vnto. O blaſphemie, to inſult on our ſufferings! O impiety, to trample on our miſerie! muſt we be ſilent while you are ſacrilegious? muſt we be patient while you are impudent?

I ſpeake not this in hope to doe any good, (yet God knows) I feare the euil is cureles, the maladie remediles, not becauſe there is no balme in Gilead, or phyſitian there; but for that, when they would haue healed Babylon, ſhe would not be healed: yet I muſt ſpeake it, if not ad correctionem, yet at leaſt ad conuictionem: we ſhall ſhortly bring things to that paſſe, as ſometimes Tully ſpake of the commonwealth, not to make it the queſtion qualem eccleſiam ſumus habituri, ſed an habituri ſumus vllam; not what Church we ſhall haue, but whether we ſhall haue a Church or no: nec iam de terminis, ſed de totapoſſeſſione erit contentio; the ſute will not be about the land-marks, but the very lands. We are alreadie come to Fimbrias quarrell, to bite and whine, to ſtab and complaine that the dagger went in but halfe way: we are driuen to craue ſome ſmall pittances of our owne poſſeſſions, and cannot bee heard; or if we be, we are braued with bountie, and vpbraided with benefits: they may indeed bee benefitia, but as Tullie calls them latronum, theeues benefits,

to whom we are therfore beholden that they do not kill vs, when they rob vs. Moſt of the lands and mannors of old erection are beg'd for fooles, a fewe Prelacies remaine, though not vnpluckt, yet not wholly deuoured; ſome dignities and Eccleſiaſtical liuings haue eſcaped the common wracke, yet narrowly lookt into, and vigilantly viewed, to be ſcored vp for the next ſeazure: men beeing ouer-buſie and officious to light candles and ſweepe corners, as a reuerend Prelate not long ſince complained, not to finde and reſtore the loſt 3. pence, but to ſearch and ſeeke the left pennie.
               But let them beware it prooue not too hotte for their handling, like the monie of Delphos, or the gold of Tholoſe, which ſo many as touched came to diſaſter deſtinies. Gods part hath euer been like Gods arke, which ſo long as it was in the hands of vncircumciſed Philiſtims, neuer left plaguing them with ſundrie vengeances, till the heifers brought it home againe to the true poſſeſſours: like Eagles feathers, that conſume and canker all other among whom they are mingled; like the fleſh of the altar, wherein a coale was couched which burnt the neaſt Chryſoft.of the bird that ceazt it: Pauca male parta, multa bene comparata perdiderunt, ſaith one, a few goods euill got, haue waſted a great deale that hath been honeſtly come by: Nolo quis habeat contra Deum, ne non habeat

theſe words, as Ioſephus a Prieſt hath left recorded, Migremus hinc, migremus hinc, Let vs away, let vs away; as if God and all his holy Angels would take their leaue, when ſacrilegers are ſuffered to harbour in the Temple. Strange hath bin the horror wherein ſuch people haue been had among the heathen, and fearefull torments haue been deuiſed for them; as propination of Ophiuſa, luxation of the bodie, precipitation from the rocke, inhumation of the corpſe, inteſtation of the goods, deteſtation of the memorie; anathematization of the partie among vs, imprecation and execration againſt bodie and ſoule: as thus; If any ſhall take away from the holy Church of God her proper inheritance, or ſuch hereditaments as by my will and Teſtament I here bequeath, (which I hope no man wileuer attempt to do) let his account be without mercie at the dreadfull day of iudgement, when he ſhall come to receiue his doome at the hands of the Iudge of heauen and earth, to whom I giue and dedicate the ſame.

Our Fathers build not Synagogas, but Baſilicas; no ſimple oratories but ſumptuous pallaces, and indowed them with plentifull patrimonies, as depoſitapietatis, &amp; domicilia diuinitatis, the earneſts of their pietie, and houſes of the diuinitie: and ſhall we ſo far degenerate from diuinity, pietie, and humanitie alſo, as to chalke vpon our Churh doore, quo vitius eò melius, a barne or a ſtable, a houell or hogſtie will ſerue the turne as well? Oh far be it from Chriſtians to thinke it, from religious to doe it: the blindeſt Sauadge in the deſolateſt Iſlands that ſerues his Zemes the deuill for God, is not ſo impious.

It hath bin obſerued, by the verie heathen, that neuer any Barbarian, or of the commō ſort of Naturaliſts did denie God or his power, or durſt offer to their dieties any of thoſe prodigions indignities that we read of; onely the fine witted fellowes the Grecians, whoſe learning indeed had made them mad, were the firſt if not the onely that did it: Euemerus, Meſſenius, Hippo, Diagoras, Epicurus, Dionyſius, who plaid his prizes with all his Gods one after another, ſhauing the golden berd away of God Aeſculapius, becauſe forſooth his father Apollo wore no berd; dimaſntling god Apollo of his robe of gold, and giuing him another of linſie-wolſie; becauſe the gold was too heauie for ſummer, &amp; too cold for winter; not onely robbing, but deriding whatſoeuer to them was holy. Though one doe much ſtomacke it, Tullie,that after all this he ſhould ride at ſea ſo calmly, raign at land ſo proſperouſly, and die in his bed ſo peaceably: yet another doth aſſure vs, that all was not gold

               But moſt memorable was the fact &amp; fortune of Cyrus, who brake vp in Babylon the tomb of Semiramis, inuited thereunto by an inſcription vpon the ſame, in hope of much treaſure; which ſounded to this effect: What King ſoeuer ſhall want mony, if he dig downe this graue ſhall find ſufficient. Now this tombe had thus ſtood many yeeres inuiolate, till at laſt Cyrus comming hither, and reading the writing, he fell to ſpoile the ſacred monument; but hauing ſpent much paines to little purpoſe, ſtill fruſtrate of his hope, all laſt vpon a ſtone he encountered another writing to this purpoſe; Surely hadſt thou not bin a very inſatiable wretch, thou wouldſt haue neuer violated the temples of the gods, nor ranſacked the graues of the dead to fill thy greedy deſire: but goe thy way, ere long thou ſhalt finde enough: and ſo indeed he did: for he was caught in the ambuſhes that Queene Tamaris had laid for him, beheaded, and caſt into a but of blood, with that bitter exprobration, Satiate ſanguine quem ſitiſti.
               
               The like diſaſter had Xerxes for breaking vp the temple and ſepulchre of Belus in hope of gold, where hee was diſapointed of his hopes, but found ſomething which he would not, a viol halfe full of oyle, wherin were the aſhes of that old King, and a ſcrow

                  Aelian. An other example moſt remarkeable in humane ſtories, is of one Macareus, a Prieſt at Mytelene, who firſt robbed, then killed a man in his veſtry, that had entruſted him with ſome treaſure: This Myſtes ſhortly after ſolemnizing the Trietericall rites of that region and religion, as he was buſie in the midſt of his ceremonies ſurrounding the citie, new gone out of the temple, where hee had left the fire requiſite for his ſacrifices, his two young children who had obſerued their fathers faſhions, fell to imitate his ſacrifice, and one with the blade which was vſed in the ſeruice, playing the Prieſt, killed his brother in ſtead of a beaſt, as he had ſeene formerly performed: the mother in her houſe neere adioyning to the temple, at the noiſe of the cry came haſtily in, and ſeeing what was done, in great rage ſnatching a brand that lay on the fire, ſtroke the ſuruiuer dead in the place: Theſe ſorrowfull accidents ſoone beeing ſpred all ouer the city, came to the cares of the father, who was ſtill in

his pageant and idolatrous pompe: but ſoon leauing his ſeruice, he ran to the place, and finding his wife bewailing her fact, with the torch he yet held in his hand, the vnhappy inſtrument of his holy deuotions, he killed her at his foot; for which himſelfe was inſtantly apprehended, tortured, examined; where betweene the terrors of torment, and horrors of conſcience, he confeſſed the whole matter from the beginning to the ende; for which he preſently receiued condigne puniſhment, beeing put to death to make vp the tragedie.
               But come we neerer home vnto our ſelues, for as much as farre fet examples haue but far off reſpects, and it ſeemes to concerne vs little, what was done ſo farre from home. I will looke no higher then the Conqueſt, where we ſhall finde Earle Godwin, Earle of Kent, father to Harold, whom the Norman ouerthrew: how treacherouſly, how impiouſly did he inueſt himſelfe with holy poſſeſſions? Firſt, by captious ſophyſtrie coſening the Archbiſhop of Canterbury for his mannor of Boſeham in Suſſex, with this deuiſe putting a tricke vpon him: He had inſtructed his followers what he would doe, and bad them be readie to beare witneſſe what the Archbiſhop anſwered to his ſubtile ſophiſme, and then he requeſts my Lord to let him haue his boſeam; the good Biſhop thinking he had asked his bleſſing, little minding his mannor, made anſwer, My Lord I giue you my boſeam: and ſo he wrangled the good man out of his land, ouerbearing him with the teſtimonie of his treacherous attendants. Then by a worſe peice

of villanie hee poſſeſſed himſelfe of a Nunnerie at Barkly in Gloceſterſhire, by a kinſmans wicked working, left ſicke among them, who neuer left working till hee had made the moſt of the virgins there pregnant, and then begd their houſe, and turned them out a begging. Many other like exploits did that man, but in the ende himſelfe at the Kings table was choaked with a peice of bread, according to his imprecation: and we know what befell his ſonne, and the whole land, not onely ſlaine with moſt part of the auncient nobilitie of this land, but the ſcepter tranſlated to a forraine Prince. I ſay no more.
               The next is the ſame forraine Prince himſelfe, William the Norman, ſurnamed the Conquerour, who vſing his victorie verie hardly, beſide other things, to make his new forreſt diſpeopled no ſmall compaſſe of ground, 36. pariſhes with their townes and Churches, of whom a Biſhop of Wincheſter made thoſe verſes,

But what befell him, to ſay nothing of his owne diſcomforts vpon his death bed; his ſonne and ſucceſſor ſurnamed Rufus, in his hunting in the ſame forreſt, Rex cervum inſequitur, regem-vindicta—ſaies the ſame Poet, as faſt as he purſues his game, vengeance purſueth him, he was by chance ſhot through by Sir Walter Tyrrel. His next ſonne Richard died of the plague: his eldeſt ſonne Robert, after many miſchiefs and miſeries done and ſuffered, had his eies put out by his owne brother, and died moſt miſerably in durance and priſon: and Henry his nephew by Robert,

in the ſame forreſt alſo came to Abſaloms ende, beeing hanged in a tree as he chaſed his deere. So Sacriledge ends for the moſt part with extirpation, as hath been noted.
               The laſt I will name, not the leaſt in this catalogue, ſhall be D. Voiſie Biſhop of this citie of Exceſter, who from a pettie Canon in the Church, roſe to the Biſhops mytre; but there ſell to that wicked reſolution, that the wicked Nero ſomtime had done,

At length when God ſaw his good time, he ſent a very heauie viſitation vpon him, (I finde not what was the particular) that thorough the good grace of God wrought ſo holy and wholeſome contrition in him, that he

vowed to God, if he did recouer, to make ſome amends: which he faithfully performed according to the deuotion of thoſe times, erecting churches, building Colledges, founding monaſteries, alwaies and openly confeſſing, that the iudgements of God had been ſent vnto him, principally for his outrages commited that way.
               Among other monuments of his repentance and humiliation, he founded the monaſterie of Wiſſenburg in Germanie, where he left for a monument of his true conuerſion, a confeſſion penned with his owne hand, to this effect;

               Be it therefore knowne, that after my Father Lotharius was dead, I tooke vpon me as next heire, the gouernement of the kingdome, but being tranſported with errors and lightnes of youth, I neglected the duty of a good Prince, diſcharging neither iuſtice nor conſcience, but as I was carried by humour and fauour. Among many other my exceſſes, I became a ruiner of Gods inheritance, and a demoliſher of his worſhip, which I ought to haue ſet vp and maintained, till at laſt that God in mercie to chaſten my rebellion,

did daſh my pride, and caſt me downe; and when he had bruſed me ſufficiently, he receiued me againe to mercie: and this confeſſion I leaue againſt my ſelfe here in record, that none may dare in like preſumption to violate this holy place, at this preſent by me deuoted to God. Thus far Dagobert: which I haue ſet downe the more fully, becauſe there are ſo few examples of reuerſion in this kinde, as it is in the fable of the Fox, replying to the Lyon for not viſiting him,

               An humble Obteſtation to the Hon. and Wor. Knights and Burgeſſes of the Parliaament when time may ſerue to remedie this miſcheife.
               ANd now moſt worthie Patriots, let me addreſſe my ſpeech to you, that manage the greateſt affaires of this kingdome, and that not by way of oneration, but moſt lowly ſummiſſion; May it pleaſe you ſeriouſly to conſider this matter with me; and ſee wherein your ſeruice may be honourable to God▪ glorious to your ſelues, comfortable to the Church, and profitable to your countrie. It is no new thing for vs to complaine, or for you to heare of the miſcheifes of church-wormes: for ſacriledge

doth deſerue to heare of his doings, hauing been often delated, bound ouer, ſcourged, branded for incorrigible, and condemned for felonie againſt God and man; but yet he findeth ſuch friends among thoſe of the bench, that he is ſtill repriued, and either pardoned his fault, or kept vnexecuted; by which meanes he ſtill breaks out againe, and I know not whether more efferated by former attatchings, or animated by his often diſchargings, he euer rampeth more feircely then before, and threatneth his accuſers, to ruine all that is holy. To you therefore doth the poore mangled and menaced Church of this renowned Iſland, in ſuppliant manner hold vp her hands: from you ſhe looketh, ſhee chalengeth, ſhee deſerueth ſupportance. Among you ſhee is aſſured ſhe hath very manie in whom ſhe is more then ordinarily intereſſed, as who are riſen by her foſtering, growne great by her fauours, and euen ſlie with her feathers: therefore to you ſhe ſues, and if ſhe could be vnderſtood, ſhe would thus complain, and thus intreat;
               Alas my ſonnes; and are theſe the rewards you render your mother, for her paines in bearing, and her patience in rearing ſo noble ſpirits, and worthie wits, both formerly not without ſore trauell and interruption; and laſtly, for 60. yeeres together without ſtop or intermiſſion; to thinke you are not well ſed with my milke, except you drawe my blood alſo? What meanes thoſe old diſmembrings, theſe newe detractings, enuyous pryings, odious beggings, ſad diſputings, ſauage incroachings vpon me and my

ſmall indowments? What good will theſe ſmall remainds of my dowry doe you? what pleaſure will my vndoing breed you? if this little eſtate that is left, make you rich and me poore, you great and mee ſmall, what will be the end of ſuch gaines? Is hauing growne ſo toothſome to you, that you make no care from whence it commeth? is holy demeanes ſo wholeſome a diſh, that you will contend who ſhall do moſt harme? is temporall riches ſo neceſſary for you, that you feare not to make it vp with the ſpoile of ſpirituall? are your ſonnes ſo deere vnto you, that they muſt be raiſed with the ruine of your fathers? Cannot you be indulgent parents, except you bee vnnaturall, impious, ſacrilegious children? are you ſo ſmally beholden for meanes vnto your father, that you muſt breake in and rob your mother? or is it my conniuence at former wrongs, that makes you preſume to wrong me more? Grow you wearie now of your mothers bleſſing? do you enuie her beeing? deſire her curſing? If it be ſo, my ſonnes, that you wil either ſell me at home, or ſend me abroad, yet giue me my dowry that I brought you with me, my peace I haue procured you, my plenty wherewith I haue crowned you, my treaſures that I haue cauſed you, and the millions of good things wherewith I haue bleſſed you. Woe is me, that I am growne ſo vnfauourie to be hated, ſo vgly to be abhorred, ſo barren to be reiected, ſo decrepite to be ſcorned, and that of mine owne cradle. Is a ſtep-mother become ſo louely, or an empty houſe ſo handſome, that I am driuen away for an other to haue my roome? Alas

my ſonnes, I will ſay what I ſee, the lickeriſh looke after my poore eſtate, ſhewes too great to your greedie eies; the deceitfull luſtre of a painted beautie bewitcheth your laſciuious eies, as you thinke to enioy, as I know to indure her glorious beautie in glorious tyrannie; who if ſhe comes in, will not onely fetch backe all that was mine, but alſo fetch in all that is yours. Remember this, but whom you diſhonour, and whom you pleaſe: did not the enemie triumph inough before, while you vnripped the ſeamleſſe coat, but you muſt yeeld them more content by diſtreſſing me their hatefull oppoſite? What meane you to doe? remember but to whom you do it, and doe your will; to one that vpholdeth the ſcepter, maintaineth you, ſecureth all you haue: they are my ſeruitours that ſtead you, my Prieſts that bleſſe you, my miniſters that profit you, who cauſe your God to be obeyed, your gouernours honoured, your people informed, your country renowmed, and your happineſſe continued. Who watch for your ſoules but they? who wake for your ſafetie but they? who avert your imminent iudgements but they? who procures your eminent bleſſings but they?

               If the Church the mother of vs all could be heard or vnderſtood thus to ſpeake, and thus to plead; what could ye anſwear, what Apologie would you make, or excuſe pretend to her as affectionate as iuſt complaint? but now not onely ſhee, but I am well aſſured God himſelfe in the greiuances of his Miniſters doth ſay the ſame with a more audible voice, &amp; more reall effect: that God I ſay, whoſe houſes ye haue ſuffered not to be robbed onely, but ruined alſo,

               All the world till late daies, thought the Church the ſafeſt ſanctuarie to repoſe their treaſures in, their wealth, their good works; but now the pooreſt cottage is farre ſafer then the ſtrongeſt Cathedrall. Then it was thought as great an immunity to the deponent, as honeſtie and honor to the recipient: now the Orphan is iniured, the widow wronged, the father diſcouraged, the Sanctuarie prophaned, and the

To whom the holy Archbiſhop made this replie, Sir, God forbid, that euer I ſhould vſe my tongue in perſwading men to pull downe Churches, who haue neede to incite them all I can to build more. True it is, this requeſt and this repulſe prooued fatall to both: for the Emperour bearing ſplene to the Patriarke for this, the Patriark ioyned with Leontius to depoſe Iuſtinian; and Iuſtinian after much hurly burly recouering the diademe, firſt blinded, then baniſhed the Patriark. It is too wel known with what animoſitie S. Ambroſe reſiſted Theodoſius in like caſe, which elſwhere remembring, he vſeth theſe words: Meminiſtis ipſi,

                     el. What time Camillus was baniſhed to Capua, and the French vnder Bremus were poſſeſſed of Rome, L. Clarius the Conſull was ſent by the Senate to Apollo Delphicus, to demaund counſell what they might doe; where he remained 40. daies together in humble ſupplication before the ſhrine, without once being heard or vouchſafed anſweare: and ſo after 6. weekes expence of time, and loſſe of much treaſure he returned as he came: Then the Senate, thought it good to ſend the Prieſts, out of euery Temple in Rome two, who ariuing there, were preſently anſweared in this manner; Maruell not yee Romanes, that I haue thus long refuſed to anſweare: for fooliſh people vſe neuer to ſeeke to God, till men doe ſaile them; but therefore doth God refuſe to counſell ſuch in their extremitie, becauſe they neuer come at them but in extremitie. Take this of me, neuer leaue God to flie to men; for it more auaileth to hold league with God, then loue with all the men aliue; be warie how you offend God, for he can damage you more then men can doe: God forgets not men, except he be much and oft forgot of them; and therefore ſuffereth he them to perſecute one another,

becauſe they all ioyne to perſecute him or his: if then if you will looke to haue him fauourable to you in time of warre, you muſt be ſure to ſerue him in the time of peace: and know this, that extreame chaſtiſements, are for extreame ſinnes. Theſe are the Mementoes I ſend to the Romans: and as to L. Clarius, I vouchſafed to make no anſwer to ſo euill a meſſenger: for take this from me, and if you find my counſell ill, then take no more: In forren ambaſſages ſend alwaeis your moſt eloquent Orators, in Senate at home put alwaies the wiſeſt men, your wars abroad commit alwaies to the moſt valiant Commanders, and in the negotiations of god, put alwaies the moſt innocent Prieſts: for god will neuer appeaſe his iuſt ire againſt vniuſt actions, but if your ſolicitours be moſt holy and righteous. As for the French, they cannot be driuen from Rome, till Camillus and all the guiltleſſe citizens that are now in baniſhment are recalled home: theſe wars doe but warne you of your offences paſt; for looke what euil wicked men doe to the good in diuerſe dayes, by other as euill they ſhall be ſure to bee repaid in one.
               This was the anſwer which Apollo gaue the Flamines that were ſent vnto him; an anſwer to ſay no more, that might haue befitted a farre better author; but it is not ſpeaking, but doing that ſaues; wherein we haue the ſtart of the wiſeſt Atheiſt or Deuil in the world. Conſider, I beſeech you of the matter, and apply it if you pleaſe.
               To conclude, as they recommended all their State to the wiſedome and prouidence of their Senate, ſo

doe wee the poore and deſpiſed Miniſters of this Kingdome, in the behalfe of the Church, recommend the care of God and his Goſpel to your wiſedoms and deuotions our Conſuls and Senators: not as finding defect in your diligence; but as he,

               Conſolation to my Reuerend Fathers and Brethren of the Clergie, againſt the iniuries of the times.
               MY Honoured Lords, Reuerend Brethen, and beloued fellow-labourers in the Goſpel of God: Conſidering the daily and dangerous in iuſtice which the world doth practiſe vpō the Church, I need not tell you that the ſame doth concerne all you, that are the deputies of God in this caſe, as from God to men in matters of grace and internall benediction, ſo of men to God for temporall tribute, and thankefull retaliation. If then we finde our charges ingrate, our Superiours ſiniſtrous, our neighbours iniurious, our auditors ſacrilegious, not reſpecting our labours, nor requiting our cares; neither reuerencing our perſons, nor abſtaining from our penſions;

what remaines for vs to be done, but to deſcend into our ſelues, and examine our conſciences in the ſight of God and his holy Angels, whether it be the guerdon of our ſinnes, or the gaging of our graces, which he lookes ſhould be reall and eminent in vs. And albeit we muſt truely agnize that ſuch vſages are the portion of our cup, and the inheritance of our profeſſion, which our Maſter hath left vnto vs; yet it cannot be denied, but we ſhall finde ſufficient cauſe within our ſelues, to aſcribe the ſame to our deſerts and aberrations.
               
                  Pet. Mart. It is written in the late hiſtories of the Indian people, that if they finde in their Temples and Sacraries of their ſuperſtitions, any horrid or abhorred creatures, as owles, or backs, or toads, or ſerpents, which men account as hatefull and ominous, they diſpoſe themſelues to all the ſhewes of humilitie, that their holieſt ceremonies can declare, to expiate the anger of their diſpleaſed Zemes and furious Deities, which they hold preſaged by ſuch impurities. The like I take it are we to doe, and make collection of theſe vnclean vermine in the ſanctuaries of God, that God is moſt highly offended with vs, and that theſe impure monſters, and prodigious Harpies doe really prognoſticate the threats of heauen, as to the whole land in generall, ſo to vs of the holy miniſterie in particular, whoſe the Temple is, and the ſignes portended there more peculiar appropriate to our calling.
               Wherefore we ſhall doe well to ſearch and diue into the true reaſon, and howſoeuer their creeping

in or ſculking vnder ſome groundſell or threſhold, makes them nothing the holier, but helps their damnation as deſperate hypocrites, yet the deſert is from our ſelues: ſo that as we denounce his iudgements to them, ſo are we to deſcrie his iuſtice to vs, ſo to ſuffer vs to looſe our reuerence and rights, that are fallen away from his feare, honouring our ſelues more then his Sonne, more reſpecting our riches then our religion, and more caring for gold then wee doe for God.
               I beſeech you then, right reuerend and renowned Fathers and Brethren, giue me leaue with a light finger, if not to lance this ſore, yet not blanch the ſearch: for I take it it is no dead fleſh that needs any boiſterous rifling, but tender and ſenſible to iudure the ranſacking, nec vt verenda retegam, ſed vt in verecunda confutem, as ſweet S. Bernard; rather with Sem to awake your drowſineſſe, then with Cham to diſplay your nakedneſſe.
               Firſt then I feare, it may by ſome be thought, that your ambition, my Honoured Lords hath excited theſe Harpies of ſtate, whereby you haue laid open your cheſts to their rauening hands, and your Churches to their irreligious hearts. Or it may bee you the Canons and Prebends of the greater Churches, that are either couetous, or vmbratilous, or polypragmonous: or you my brethren and fellows in the countrie, partly ſchiſmatical, partly ſymoniacal, men ſeditious or ſcandalous, more frequenting the palace then the pulpit, and more ſoliciting the hall with ſutes, then heauen with Saints; that haue opened the

mouthes of theſe curſing Shemeis, and rayling Rabſake
                     •
                  s, and ſtrengthened the hand of ſacrilegious Achans, and irreligious Atheiſts. Or it may bee as euerie one ſeuerally, ſo all combinedly haue ſinned, and committed ſomething preiudiciouſly to our perſons and patrimonies: As for example;
               When a ſymonizing Scholler, agrees with a Gehezying Patron; and a Iudaizing Biſhop, to make a diabolizing impropriation: or as Malmburienſis writeth of one halfe Biſhop of Norwich: when there meetes in one indiuiduall, a Scholler, a Courtier, &amp; a flatterer; a Symoniake, a Biſhop, and a Pirat. Howeuer it be, I would to God that our ſymonie, and policie, and idlenes, and couetouſneſſe, and abſence, and ſilence, and baſeneſſe and buſineſſe, which hath drawne this miſerie vpon vs with cords, and this miſcheife with cart-ropes, were ſifted and expiated as it ought, that God might ſee our humiliation, and the world our ſatisfaction.
               Therefore we muſt take this as Gods moſt iuſt retaliation; foraſmuch as we haue let goe thoſe greater points of holineſſe, mercie, iuſtice, faith, and faithfulneſſe, it is but meete that wee ſhould looſe theſe diminitiues of mint, and aniſe, and commin: becauſe we giue not God his due, other giue not ours to vs: this beeing the condition of our obligation, That they ſhall be honoured that honour him, and they

                  but little eſteemed that deſpiſe him: and this is that which S. Auguſtine ſaith, Our inferiours both men and members, derie vs that obedience which we detaine in our places from God.
               
               
                  
                  Magdeb. The hiſtorie of the renowned Biſhop Amphilochius Biſhop of Iconium, is well enough known, and the ſtratageme he vſed to the Emperour Theodoſius, to ſhew him his error in the matter of the Arrians. The holy Biſhop had ſolicited this Emperour to expell the heretikes, that had as then too much fauour in the Empire, as ſome of their fellowes haue at this day with vs; but the Emperour out of his mildenes had forborne to doe it, as ſome other doe alſo now; ſo as by this conniuence they had almoſt mard all▪ whereupon the good Biſhop was driuen to bethinke himſelfe of ſome remedie, to awake the Emperour out of his dead ſleepe: for which cauſe hauing within a while occaſion to come to the Court to viſit his highneſſe, he found the young Emperour Arcadius (whom his Father had newly created to gouern with him) ſitting in ſtate together with the olde Emperour. The good Biſhop made humble reuerence to the Emperour Theodoſius, but to Arcadius did none at all. The olde Emperour thinking he had done it by ouerſight, put him in minde to ſalute Arcadius alſo: the Biſhop replied, it ſufficed to honour him, and therefore needed not reuerence his ſonne alſo. The Emperour now growing into choller at ſo high contempt, bad he ſhould be carried out of the Court: whereupon the Biſhop taking the opportunity, told the Emperour to this effect; And doe you, ſir Emperour, take the diſhonour of your ſonne ſo hainouſly? then I beſeech you conſider, how God wil take it at your hands, to diſhonour his Sonne. The Emperour pawſing ſomewhat vpon his ſpeech, and

waighing the iuſtneſſe of the reproofe, acknowledged his errour, and preſently tooke order to auoide the Arrians out of the Empire.
               
                  Therefore who knowes whether God hath bid Shemei curſe Dauid, or ſends Senacherib to ſpoile Ieruſalem: for as Achior ſpeakes vnto the great Commander, If there be error in this people, or that they haue Iud. 5. 10.ſinned againſt their God, then maieſt thou goe vp, and ouercome them: and as Zeres ſpeakes, If wee haue begun Eſth. 6. 14.to fall before them, it is to be feared we ſhall fall more: for they are Iewes: but if we ſhall repent vs of our ſinnes, and reſume our firſt loue, who knowes if he will returns Io

                     .and leaue a bleſſing behind him, a meat offring and drinke offering to the Lord our God: therefore let the Prieſts and the Miniſters of the Lord, weep betweene the porch and the altar, and ſay, Spare thy people, O Lord, and giue not thine inheritance a reproach, that the heathen may rule ouer vs: ſo ſhall the Lord be iealous ouer his people, and reſtore the yeeres that the locuſt hath eaten, the canker, the caterpillar, and the palmer-worme, euen the ſtrong hoſt which he ſendeth among vs.
               But in caſe for all this, that God ſhall thinke good to verefie that on vs, which was ſaid of Chriſt by Iohn, Me oportet minui, illum autem creſcere: yet let vs ſhew the world our Chriſtian patience, and holy confidence, againſt their furie and falſhood, that we ſerue not God for meed, as they obiect; but in the midſt of malice, in the midſt of penurie, in the midſt of infamie, we will follow our leader without forſaking our calling: Malus eſt miles, qui imperatorem gemens ſequitur: he is but white-liuered, that followes

armes but in faire weather.
               The world hath been perſwaded I feare me, too truly of too many, that ſchollers flie to the Miniſterie, as malefactors doe to the Sanctuarie, for ſiniſter and oblique reſpects; for imunitie, or impunitie, for eaſe or honour; as many of them that haue had either fooliſh or deformed, needie or vnthrifty children, ſuch they ſet aſide to weare the Ephod; and other doe gladly recount, how their ruined eſtates and forlorne hopes haue been wholly ſupported by the pillars of the Church, which otherwiſe had ſunke in euerlaſting vndoing: ſo making the Church their vltimum refugium, the ſhoot-anker of their fortune, and the bawd of their bankruptnes. Thus meaſuring others feete by their owne laſt, preſume the ſame of our diuerſions: now let them by our carriage be confuted, and giuen to know we had no Cynoſura, but Sion, no collimation but conſcience, no aime but Gods honour. And that if God ſhall pleaſe not onelie to touch vs, but to take all the reſt from vs, and giue Satan ſufferance, not onely to winnow, but to waſt vs, yet we will be the ſame, and ſerue him ſtill: this may be our comfort, that God dealeth no worſe with vs; this our hope, he meanes no more harme vnto vs; this our harbinger, that he may call vs to a harder triall.
               For haue we any aſſurance to fare better then our Fathers? any priuiledge of birth-right to ſit ſafer then our brethren? we haue not yet reſiſted vnto blood, perhaps we muſt; therefore let vs not loue theſe things too much, leſt we leaue better things

for them▪ let this weane vs from the world, and teach vnto ſerue God in all weather.
               
                  As for our enemies and ouerthwart neighbours, let them not triumph in our tribulations; the fate of Babel, comes in next after the fall of Sion: now the time is, that iudgement muſt begin at Gods owne houſe: 1. Pet.

               The concluſion: where are touched the fountaine and remedies of all this euill.
               ANd now I feele my pen wearie with the chace of this noyſome beaſt, I will ſound a retrait and draw to end: ſo oft as I enter into the ſerious conſideration of this ſinne, and the great inconueniences that it hath and daily will deriue vnto the Church of God in this land, (as I often doe) I cannot but thinke of that word of Abner vpon the play of the 2. Sam. 2. 16.young men, ſhall the ſword deuoure ſor euer: knoweſt thou not it will be bitternes in the latter end? for ſeeing the dead ſea, into which things muſt needs deſcend, in the fartheſt fall is nothing but atheiſme and all manner of impietie, let vs a little looke vpward vnto the head, and ſearch whether it may be ſtopt in the ſpring, or diuerted ſome other way.
               The true cauſe then of all this ramping, and reuelling againſt God and his holy Church is firſt, profanes; and ſeconly, couetouſneſſe; a verie contempt of heauen and all true happines, and a greedy deſire to inglutte our ſelues with Eſaus pottage, the commodities and emoluments of this preſent life.
               For the firſt, if euer this land fall backe againe, by a fearfull recidiuation into the carnall impieties, and earthly ſenſualities of the Romiſh religion, as it is in a faire forwardnes vnles God preuent it, it will be by the meanes of our notorious Atheiſme and fearfull

Apoſtaſie from the true feare of God, and care of all goodnes: for theſe are at leaſt ſubordinate one to another, if not identities: for they that will but looke into the manners of the moderne times, ſhall well perceiue that many that had eſcaped the Scylla of ſuperſtition, are againe verie dangerouſly beleaguered in the Caribdis of irreligion; teaching their hearts with Platoes Atheiſt, either that there is no God at all, or that he is not ſuch for mercie or iuſtice as men are made beleeue, or at leaſt that men may doe (as in too manie ſpirituall courts) buy out their heauie pennance with light commutements. To which purpoſe I call to minde a ſtrange narration of M. Greenham a zealous preacher ſometime of our Church, of a certaine inſtable ſinner, that at firſt had been a Papiſt, till ariuing at better reaſon, he found their faſhions to come much ſhort of their gawdie ſhewes: then turned he his tippet, and became Proteſtant, where he ſtaid not long, by reaſon they ſhewed much coldnes in their profeſſion: at laſt he ſeparated, and was a Fami

                  ſt. Now whether it was he had not left himſelfe any further choice, or took a better taſt of their religion, there he faſtened: now the firſt principle that they ſought to inſtill into him was this, that there was no God. Now whether it was the iuſt dereliction of God to puniſh his giddines; or the fatigation of a wandring ſpirit to purchaſe quietnes; or the correſpondence of the maxime ſuting well with his wickednes; he drunke in this poſition verie greedily, and thereupon began to frame concluſions; If there be no God, then there

is no heauen nor hell to reward mens actions: if neither of theſe, what madnes is this to defraud my ſoule of certaine pleaſures for vncertaine phantaſies. This diabolicall colluſion rather then concluſion, ſo far preuailed with him, that like ſome ignis fatuus, it carried him headlong into all manner of licentious downefalls: firſt for pleaſure, to eating and drinking like another Euangelicall Epicure; then to mainetain that charge, to robbing &amp; ſtealing; and laſt of all, as the reward of ſuch courſes, to apprehending and hanging. Now at the place of his death, &amp; the point of the laſt gaſpe, he requeſted a ſtay, where confeſſing his whole manner of life, his wallowing in and out of all religions, his beginning in Papiſme, his continuing by Proteſtiſme, and his ending in Anabaptiſme, he deliuered theſe words; Now do I find at my death, the error of all my life: I was taught, and did beleeue there was no God: but here I finde the contrary, and that he is moſt iuſt to reward all wretched contemners; and ſo he ended the Cataſtrophe. I queſtion not the truth of this ſtorie, becauſe I knew the reporter: I will not ſcholie vpon his volubilous expatiation, voluminous gradatiō, meritorious concluſion. Let vs be afraid of theſe excentricall motions, which the Prophet calleth Spiritum vertiginis, a ſpirituall giddines, whereby men wander in the labyrinths

Ethic:the bough the contrarie way: for diſeaſes lightly are cured with their contraries; as fulnes, with faſting, malice with mercie, auarice with almes, impietie or contempt of God, with an awfull feare of his greatneſſe, a faithfull loue of his goodneſſe: for hee will be honoured either à nobis, or de nobis, by religious adoration, or dangerous direliction. Therefore if we ſerue him, he will ſerue vs; but if wee ſhall caſt off all his feare, plucke downe his houſes, mangle his inheritance, hinder his ſeruice, diſcourage, diſhonour, diſanull his miniſters and miniſterie, hoe will leaue vs to the counſell of our owne hands, to make luſt our law, and might our moderator, puniſhing impietie with incredulitie, and incredulitie with complete miſerie, as he did our heathen aunceſtors, whom he gaue vp into a reprobate minde, to doe all 
                  Rom. 1. 30.
                  ſuch things as were not conuenient, beeing full of all vnrighteouſnes, wickednes, couetouſnes, maliciouſnes: full of enuie, murder, deceit, debate, taking all things in the euill part; whiſperers, backbiters, haters of God, doers of wrong, proud, boaſters, inuenters of euill things, diſobedient to parents, without vnderſtanding, couenant-breakers, without naturall affection, vnplacable, vnmercifull: God ſtill puniſhing one ſinne with another, till we come to that height, as to leaue our ſelues neither ſinne to commit, nor place to repent; as all robbe-Gods doe.
               2. The ſecond maine well-ſpring of Sacriledge, is that root of all euill, Couetouſneſſe:▪quid non mortalia

pectora cogit Auri ſacra fames—the world now adayes doth build their worth vpon nothing but wealth, and their whole reputation vpon that falſe poſition, tantum ſumus (not quantum ſcimus, but) quantum poſſidemus: acknowledging no Dietie but Pluto, and no God but gaine; framing to themſelues not heauenly, but helliſh felicities: for he that knew them better then wee, called riches thornes; now thornes we know, though at the ſpring they ſhewe faire with their greene leaues and white bloſſomes, yet are they but thornes, and he that toucheth them, except he be better armed, ſhall feele their prickles; 1. Tim. 6. 9.ſo doe riches: for they that will be rich fall into tentations and ſnares, and into many fooliſh and noyſome luſts, which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction: for the loue of money is the root of all euill: which while ſome haue luſted after, they haue erred from the the faith, and peirced themſelues through with many ſorrowes.
               
               
                  ſanct. Take one example, in ſtead of a Comment vpon Pauls text, of Mauritius the Emperour, adopted by Tyberius the ſecond to ſucceed in the Empire: Hee at the beginning was an excellent and fortunate Prince, ſubduing and vanquiſhing the enemies of the Empire, with great applauſe and admiration, as the Armenians, Perſians, Scythians, Lumbards, and Hunnes, and many worthy exploits beſides, with much praiſe and commendation: but in the end being mightily tranſported with filthy auarice, he addicted himſelfe to no other thing but ſcraping and hoarding of money, and that by any fowle or baſe meanes whatſoeuer: for beſide other ſordide and diſhonourable

courſes, he fell to defraud his ſouldiers of their pay that ſerued in his warres, in countries far off, and weather verie grieuous: by which courſes hauing loſt the hearts of his men of warre, he receiued an exceeding great ouerthrowe, whereby a mightie multitude of Chriſtians were taken priſoners of the Barbarians, for whoſe ranſome hee would not part with one pennie, albeit Caianus offered their redemption dog-cheape, (ſingulos captiuos, ſingulis nummis, ſaith my author) which nummus in gold was but 15s, in ſiluer 16 a peece; which rather then hee would part with, he ſuffered the Scythian to cut all their throates. Now ſee what miſerie befell this miſer.
               There was a certaine religious man, that in a propheticall ſpirit ran through the ſtreetes of Canſtantinople halfe naked and mazed, that in the hearing of all the citie fore-ſpake that the Emperour ſhould die a moſt bloodie death: whereupon the Emperour hauing verie hardly eſcaped with his life in a tumult that roſe in the towne; comming to himſelfe, and revoluing in his minde his wretched courſes, and how many thouſand Chriſtians hee had caſt away by his horrible niggardize, and barbarous parſimonie, hee fell to great repentance, crauing with all earneſtnes at the hands of God, all the vengeance that this life is capable of, ſo that he might be ſpared euerlaſting torments: for which cauſe ſending about his meſſengers and preſents to all the Churches through the Empire, and into the wilderneſſe and woods to the holy Monks, he deſired to be recommended to

God in all their deuotions, that he would be pleaſed to bee mercifull vnto him, and to puniſh his ſinnes here, and not hereafter. Now while in great humilitie he ſued thus to God, he had a diuination or viſion ſent him in his ſleepe, to this purpoſe: Hee ſeemed to be brought before the image of his Sauiour, which ſtood ouer the braſen gate of the pallace, with an infinite mul
                     •
                  irude of people round about him, and he in the midſt. Then came a voice as it were from Chriſt, ſaying, Set me forth Mauritius; which beeing done, the Serieants and officers of the Aſſize brought him to the barre, where the Iudge with his owne mouth ſaid thus vnto him, Say Mauricius, where wilt thou haue me puniſh thee for thy euill life, vpon the earth, or elſe in hell? to which queſtion he preſently anſwered vpon his knees, Moſt mercifull Lord and iuſt auenger, in this world: with that the Lord commaunded, that he, and Conſtantina the Empreſſe, his ſonnes, and all his linnage, ſhould be committed ouer to Phocas a ſouldier in the armie. Now then ſo ſoone as hee awoke, he ſent with all ſpeed for Philippicus his ſonne in lawe, whom he had long had in iealouſie, as laying wait for his life and crowne, and crauing pardon for his ſuſpition, he told him all his viſion, and demaunded who that Phocas was, who made him anſwer, that he was a Lieftenant in the army, a deboſhed young man, and an arrant coward: vpon which relation the Emperour concluded, that if he were ſuch, nothing would ſatisfie him but his blood. Now for the further confirmation of this dreame, a blazing ſtarre appeared, portending

the ſame euent. Againe, Magiſtranus his ambaſſadour to the Churches returned to the Court, that had ſolicited his cauſe to the monaſteries and miniſters abroad, and from them all, returned this anſwer, That God had accepted of his repentance, and was pleaſed to ſaue his ſoule, but for his life and ſtate the ſentence would not be reuerſed. All which things ſuting well together, Mauricius gaue moſt humble thankes to God, committing all things to the heauenly prouidence, and for the accompliſhment of his fatall deſtinie, reſted patiently in hourely expectance. Not long after, the ſouldiers now lying in garriſon, I know not whereupon, roſe in mutinie, and crowned Phocas ſo often mentioned, to be Emperour; who preſently addreſſing himſelfe for Conſtantinople, and by ſudden ſurpriſall taking the citie, through the negligence of the warders, by the Patriarke and all the people was ſoone confirmed, ſome fewe excepted, who becauſe Mauritius was yet liuing durſt not aſſent, which Phocas had forgot: ſo preſently hee goes to the palace, and ſearching for Mauritius, hee found him fled into a monaſterie; whence plucking him out, and carrying out to Calcydon, they put him to cruell torments, killing his wife and his fiue ſonnes before his face: during all whoſe death and his owne danger, hee did nothing but pray with great deuotion, euer repeating theſe words, iu

                     tus es domine, &amp; recta iudiciatua, righteous art thou O Lord, &amp; true are thy iudgements: and ſo moſt patiently commending his ſoule to God, he tooke his death. Thus farre the hiſtorie.
               
                  
By which wee note the truth of the Scripture, which calls riches deceitfull things: for though they preſent, as I ſpake of the hawthorne, a faire luſtre to the eie, and promiſe much happineſſe to the heart; yet they are like the Apothecaries boxes, which are written vpon, Cordials, but are ranke poiſons: for although pouertie is the vndoing of many, yet riches are the vndoing of farre more, as one ſaith. Wherefore our Sauiour directing his ſpeech to the rich, Luk. 12. 15.ſaies thus, videte &amp; cauete ab auaritia; ſee the effects, beware the danger. The world thinks gold is good Deut. 16. 19.for the eyes; and ſo ſaith Moſes, to make men blind; and the blind, ſaith Chriſt, are in danger to fall into the ditch: therfore ſee and beware; the eie muſt ſhew, the feet muſt ſhun the danger: that is double, 1. for 1. Tim. 6. 9.this world, Temptations and ſnares, and fooliſh and noyſome luſts which drowne men in perdition and destruction: 2. for the other, whoſe god is their belly, and glory their

               Let not any indent with God, or craue a bill of his hand; If I had ſo much, I would truſt to Gods prouidence for the reſt: for we muſt ſimply ſurrender our ſelues vnto him. The readieſt way to get the world, is to ſacrifice it vnto God, as Abraham did his ſonne. Salomon asked but wiſdome, and had

all other with it: happie if hee had alſo asked grace: But greedineſſe is the portion of them that want godlineſſe; therefore the Caribes and Sauages ſet their heart vpon the earth, becauſe they haue no further hope in heauen. Doth God care for oxen, ſaith Paul? nothing like as he doth of his children: why then ſhould his children care for oxen, or the earth more then for him? But here is a brow and wall of braſſe, euer rebounding, and euer reſounding, non perſuadebis etiamſi perſuaſeris, which God amend: and ſo I ende.
               Let God be glorified.

Againe, though God ſeemes to deferre his help, to exerciſe our patience and increaſe our zeale, and to let the wicked runne on till their ſinnes be ripe, yet that is but to ſet an edge to our deuotion, and to puniſh their ſecurity the more ſeuerely.

This is the propheticall praier, Non votum ſedprophetia, non maledictio ſed praedictio. The note. 1. God doth moſt commonly deferre his help and deliuerance till the exigent and laſt caſt, to the end his helpe may then bee more conſpicuous, and his glorie more illuſtrious. 2. His former actions and deliuerances remembred and conſidered, will not a little ſerue to comfort our affliction, and giue hope and ſtrength to our expectation. 3. As the former, ſo alſo theſe paint out our ſpirituall haters: of whom we reade in Ioſua, chap. 4. 7. 8. 1. Midian, ſhifting or declining of iudgement. 2. Siſera, excluſion of ioy. 3.

As good husbands eſteemes their houſes and patrimonies, not ſuffring them to be ruined, or wreſted from them, no more will God ſuffer his enemies to inuade his poſſeſſions, or vſurpe his inheritance: and therefore ſuch things ought to be inuiolable and inappropriable, to any other or any other end; for which cauſe let them looke vpon them that haue done the like, who they were, how they fared, where they miſcaried; they lined impiouſly, died deſperatly, are remembred infamouſly: foxes in their births, woolues in their life, aſſes in their death.

            Thirdly, it is not for nothing that the Spirit doth accumulate ſo many words to the ſame purpoſe, as names of enemies, formes of ruine, ſimilitudes of vengeance; but either to ſhew vs the vehemencie of the Saints affection, or the certentie and celerity of the aduerſaries deſtruction; or elſe the pertinacie of their oppoſition; or laſtly, the difficultie of the oppreſſeds conſolation.

                     que
                   igni: for ſome are fearefully hardened, other are wholeſomely ſhamed by one and the ſame iudgement. 3. But how is this, that his verie peſecutors doe ſeeke his name? did not Saul goe to Damaſcus a lyon, and returned to Ieruſalem a lambe? ſo are many laid proſtrate, as he was, vpon their faces for conuerſion, when other are caſt downe too, but on their backs for confuſion: but ſuch as belong to Gods election, ſic confunduntur vt placeant, ſic pereunt vt permaneant.
            
            
               
                  verſ. 17. 
               Let them be confounded and troubled for euer, let them be put to ſhame and periſh: the former vſe concerned the corrigible ſinner, this the indurate and reprobate. Note. 1. All are not made of one mettall, nor created to one end; there are veſſels of honour, and veſſels of diſhonour, there are none ſo deſperate but may pertaine vnto election, none ſo demure, but may be of the reprobation; therefore Auguſtine praies, aut conuertantur vt redeant, aut confundantur vt percant. 2. Hardnes of heart is a fearfull ſinne, and a

fearefull ſigne: that is, ſuch as Bernard writes, quod nec compunctione ſcinditur, nec pietate mollitur, nec mouetur precibus, minis non credit, &amp; flagellis duratur, which neither is pricked with ſorrow, nor ſoftned with loue, nor mooued with praiers, grows ſturdier with menacings, and harder with chaſtenings: this is a ſymptome of finall deſertion.
            
               
                  verſ. 18. 
               That they may know that thou whoſe name is Iehovah, art the moſt high ouer all the earth.] Hee endeth with that which is the ende of all, Gods glorie. Note: 1. Though contemners doe hate the light, and like the fiſh called of ſome Atramentarius, conceale themſelues in their owne ſuds; yet God will declare his glorie ſo in them or on them, that they ſhal, maugre their hearts, confeſſe the ſame, though they had rather be ignorant of him.
            2. God is knowne to excell all men, when he ſetteth forth his wiſedome, maieſtie, and power, ſo palpably and plainely, that man with all his imaginations, can neither darken nor denie it. Which muſt ſerue to beat downe all our oppoſition and reluctation againſt him, for as much as no policie can alter, no proiect reſiſt that which hee hath decreed; and that is the vp holding of his Houſes.
            FINIS.
