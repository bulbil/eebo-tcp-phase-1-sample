            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

A VVorke verie neceſſarie for our time and countrie, where the Plague rageth ſo ſore in many places preſently, or which heereafter ſhalbe viſited, which God forbid, if it be his wil.

            To the right Honourable S. Iohn Blanke, Knight, L. Maior of the moſt renowmed Citie of London: and to the Right Worſhipful M. William Fleetwood Sergeant of the Law, and Recorder of the ſaide Citie: and alſo to the right Worſhipfull, the Sheriffes and Aldermen, with the whole ſtate of the ſame citie: Iohn Stockwood Schoolemaiſter of Tū
               bridge, wiſheth a moſt plentifull increaſe of the ſpirit of wiſedome, and al neceſſarie graces, for the gouernment of ſo great a people, as may be moſt to the glory of God, the profit of his Churche, and welfare of the common wealth.
            
               AS mankinde naturallie euer ſince the fall of our firſt parentes Adam and Heuah (right honourable and Woorſhipfull) hath not ceaſed in it ſelfe, &amp; forſaken of God his ſpirit, to growe from bad to worſe, &amp; from euill to ſtart nought, or (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh verie properly) to walke in the counſell of the wicked, to ſtand in the way of ſinners, &amp; (which is a thing moſt lamentable and feareful) to ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornful, that is, to clime thoſe ſtaiers,

and ſcale that ladder, whoſe ſteppes beeing ſinne, and ſtaues iniquitie, cannot chooſe but faile them cōming once to the toppe, and to caſt them downe to that horrible downefall of perpetuall ruine and euerlaſting condemnation: ſo GOD a moſt iuſt iudge, and yet with all a moſte gentle and louing Father to ſuch as are his, hath vſed and tried from time to time all manner of meanes and wayes, to bring the ſame out of thraldome to llbertye, out of priſon to enlargement, out of miſerie to ioy, out of paine to pleaſure, out of ignorāce to trueth, out of darknes to light, out of wretchedneſſe to happyneſſe, and out of hell to Heauen. Hee hath prooued and aſſayed all kinde of remedies, wearying as it were himſelfe for our amendement, and hath nothinge at all in a manner preuayled: hee hath myldely intreated vs in the dealing of a Father, hee hath ſeuerelye handeled vs in the perſon of a iudge. The heauens haue burnte aboue vs in ſtraunge manner with fires, newe Starres, Comets and vnwonted lightes: the earth beneath vs hath trembled and quaked at the iudgementes of GOD,

as notable any longer to beare the burden of our ſinnes, yet man hath nothing at all beene moued. Hee hath plentifully ſent foorth his woorde; and great haue beene the number of his Preachers: but his people haue ſtopped their eares like the deafe Adder, and will not heare the voyce of the Charmer, charme he neuer ſo wiſelie. Hee hath pyped vnto vs,Mat. 11.17. and wee haue not daunced: hee hath mourned vnto vs, and we haue not lamented. Hee hath bleſſed vs in the Citie,Deut. 28. and bleſſed vs in the field: he hath bleſſed the fruite of our bodie, and the fruite of our grounde, the fruite of our cattel, the increaſe of our kine, and the flockes of our ſheepe. He hath bleſſed our basket, and our dough: he hath bleſſed vs comming in, and bleſſed vs going out. Hee hath cauſed our enemies that haue riſen againſt vs, to fall before vs, they haue come out againſt vs one waye, and haue fledde before vs ſeuen wayes, in ſo much that all the nations of the earth ſee this, and woonder at the ſame: yet cannot all this make our Realme of England thankfull. What then remaineth, but that, if wee goe on ſtill wallowing

in our ſinnes, adding contempt vnto vnthākfulnes, as drunkēnes vnto thirſt, the Lord will turne al theſe his former bleſſings, vnto new &amp; vnwonted curſes: curſing vs in the town, and curſing vs in the field, curſing our baſket, &amp; curſing our ſtore, curſing the fruite of our body, and the fruite of our land, the increaſe of our kine, and the flockes of our ſheepe, curſing our comming in, &amp; curſing our going out, ſending vpō vs trouble &amp; ſhame, in al that we put our hande vnto, making the heauen ouer our head, braſſe; and the earth that is vnder our feete, yrō; ſmiting vs with a conſumption, with the feuer, &amp; with a burning ague, and with feruent heate, making the peſtilence to cleaue vnto vs vntil hee hath conſumed vs from the land, which we poſſeſſe and dwell in. For we are not ſo wittie and cunning in committing daily and hourely new ſins, but the Lord is as expert &amp; ſkilfull in ordeining new plagues to correct and chaſtiſe the ſame withall. We ſee how amongeſt other his ſcourges, ſent no doubt for the amendement of his choſen, and for the warning of the reprobate, that theſe are but fleabitings vnto the tormēts that

are reſerued for thē in the life to come, how the plague &amp; peſtilēce now furiouſly rageth almoſt in euery corner of this lād, a ſicknes that euery man ſo greatly trembleth at, &amp; no man feareth to deſerue the ſame: a diſeaſe ſo vſuall, eſpecially in your moſt honourable citie of London, that albeit it were ſomwhat feared at the firſt, yet vſe hath now at length made it vnto many ſo familiar, that there is litle more regard had of it then of any other cōmon &amp; light malady. A great number, &amp; amōg the ſame, ſome alſo of no ſmal account (at leaſtwiſe in their owne iudgement) contrary to reaſon, philoſophy, phiſick, diuinity, yea experience it ſelfe, abſurdlie and fondly both by word &amp; exāple, mainteyning ye
                ſame not to bee infectious, or that it may be takē one of an other, which maketh thē ſo vndiſcreetely, &amp; vnaduiſedly, nay ſo vnchriſtianly &amp; raſhly, where there is no need, without any feare of thēſelues, or regard of others, to reſort &amp; keepe cō
               pany with ſuche as are infected, vnder a pretence of chriſtian charity, but indeed of a blind zeale without knowledge: yea and many times to win the commendation &amp; glory of not fearing, or rather contemning

death, this way procuring vntimely death (I ſpeake not of the vnchā
               ble determination of God, but as maye bee geſſed by the ordinarie courſe of nature) both vnto them ſelues and alſo manie others, to the diſpleaſure of God, and the loſſe of the common wealth: not that I thinke it vnlawful for one Chriſtian in this kynde of ſickneſſe to viſite an other (whereunto Godlineſſe, religion, and Chriſtian duetic doth binde) but that I would haue al needeleſſe reſort reſtrayned, being, although not the only, yet in my iudgemēt, the chiefeſt cauſe of the ſpreading and ſcattering abroade of the ſame. But hereof (I meane whether the Plague be infectious or no, and whether, and how farre it maye of a Chriſtian bee ſhunned and auoyded) there is a verye notable and profitable Treatiſe, written by that famous and Godlye Diuine Theodore Beza, in Latine, and not manie yeeres ſithens by mee turned into Engliſh for the benefit of my countrie men, whither for ſhortneſſe ſake I ſende the Reader that is not alreadye ſatisfied. As for you (right Honourable &amp; Worſhipfull, whom in the Lord with all

humilitie I reuerence, and on whoſe ſhoulders lyeth the heauie charge of gouerning this noble citie) I am fully reſolued, that you are otherwiſe perſwaded, thinking the Plague not onelie to be infectious, but that it is alſo your partes and dueties ſo farre as in you lyeth, and by the wiſedome and pollicie of manne, not contrary vnto the word of God, may be attayned vnto, to labour to ſtop, preuent and hinder the contagion of the ſame. To the furtherance &amp; forwarding of whiche your Godlye purpoſe, I haue taken paynes to Engliſhe this very excellent and ſinguler Treatiſe, the Father of it being a Dutch man, the childe a Roman, not by countrie, but by education: the which being committed vnto my tuition, I haue taught in foureteene daies ſpace to ſpeake this mother tongue of ours in ſuche rude and homelie manner as you ſee; hoping that the plainneſſe and ſimplenes of his ſpeech may be pardoned and borne with in regarde of his ſhorte time that hee had to learne, not that he would winne praiſe for his quick capacitie, but ſeing the occaſion of God his ſo general viſitation, he thought, that

if hee might bee hearde ſpeake before your H. &amp; W. he might happily ſay ſome thing that might turne to the common benefite, hauing meant ere this time to haue preſēted himſelf vnto you vnder his maiſters ſimple dedication, ſauing that I know not howe it falleth out of a prepoſterous &amp; ouerthwart courſe, that good things can hardly paſſe the preſſe, whē as vnprofitable and hurtefull Pamphlets haue very quick and to too ſpeedye paſſage. Whatſoeuer good and holeſome counſell he ſhall giue, he truſteth ſhall at your hands not onely be friendly accepted, but diligently folowed, &amp; put in practiſe, as occaſion and opportunity ſhalbe offered, crauing pardon for his wants, &amp; imperfections, nothing doubting but they ſhalbe ſupplied, either by your own graue wiſedomes, or els by the learned aduiſe of Godlie and ſkilfull Phiſitions. It is enough for him to haue broken the yſe, and to haue ſhewed the waye for others, miniſtring matter of further deliberation, what manner courſe ought to be taken for the taming and maiſtering of this ſo fierce and cruell a Dragon, (for ſo I reade this ſickenes of the plague

by ſome verye ſinguler Phiſitions to bee termed) before he be ſuffered to approch too farre within your borders. Wee ſee what preparation is vſed of euery man to withſtand his owne priuate enemy: what care euery good huſbād hath for the fortifiyng of his houſe againſt the lawles attēpts &amp; brekings in of theeues: what publike diligence is ſhewed, &amp; ſtrōg munition had alwayes in a readines to keep out the power of the forraine ſouldier: howe much more then ſtandeth it you vpon, &amp; all other godly and faithfull magiſtrates, to imploy al your endeuours, to communicate and impart all your counſelles, to bend all your deuiſes, to ſtop in time the daungerous aſſaults of this bloody Lion, yt
                rāgeth ſo fiercely in moſt places of this realme at this time? If delay in all perils be dangerous, it cānot chooſe but in this diſeaſe, whiche like a ſwift deuouring fire conſumeth all thinges before it as it goeth, but be very perillous and hurtfull. Meete with therfore the beginning, leaſt remedie come too late: when the diſeaſe by tract of time is growē to ſuch ſtrēgth, that it can very hardlie, and not without much trouble be cured. A little bracke

in a Wall made to keepe out water, taken at the firſt, may quickely be ſtopped, which being ſuffered but for a ſmal time to haue his courſe, maketh ſuch a breach as often turneth to the drowning of an whole Countrie. The fire that is eſpyed when it firſt taketh hold in the thatch or tymber of ſome houſe in a Towne, may eaſily at the beginning with a little helpe bee quenched, whiche catching ſtrength by ſpreading, cauſeth ſomtimes the pitifull deſolation and vtter burning to grounde of all the houſes and buildinges in the ſame. After like manner it fareth with this vnrulye ſtreame of the Plague, and vnmercifull flame of the Peſtilence, if you geue it leaue by ſpreading and ſcattering abroade, once to gather force and power, it many times maketh riddāce of whole townes, &amp; cleane ſweepeth away huge and mighty Cities, whereas beeyng wiſelye looked vnto at the firſte, after ſuche order as in this ſhorte Treatiſe is preſcribed, it often paſſeth awaye without anye greate hurte or harme dooynge. You haue heeretofore felt of the inconueniēce that hath growen by delaies in this kind of calamity. Let

therefore your former harmes make you beware againſt time to come, in recōpē
               ſing the former ſlacknes, with new &amp; ſpeedy diligence. And aboue al thinges haue eſpeciall regard to make ſharpe lawes for the puniſhmēt of ſuch as needleſly reſort to thoſe that are infected, and for ſuch as hauing been taken with the ſicknes preſume to come abroade, and to thruſt thē ſelues into the cōpany of others, before they bee throughly cured. For theſe two waies this diſeaſe may wōderfully bee increaſed, whereof in this ſmall diſcourſe you ſhal reade very ſtrange and wonderful examples. I knowe there be that reaſon, that the dayes of man are numbred: that the time is ſet &amp; the houre limited, in which we ſhall all die, and hereof inferre, that albeit we neuer ſo much, nor ſo often haunt the companie of the infected, yet it ſkilleth not, wee ſhall not die before our time, &amp;c. But this Diuelles argument (ſo I call it,Mat. 4.6. becauſe the Diuell vſeth the verye like reaſon in the tentation of our Sauiour Chriſte) ſhall finde no countenance before your H. and W. as I truſt. For it is a verie badde kind of reaſon from the etetnall and ſecrete decree

of God knowen onelie vnto himſelfe, to goe about to take away all ordinarie meane to be vſed by man. True it is, that no man ſhall die before the time which God hath appoynted, which time becauſe it is vnto vs moſt vncertaine, we are to vſe the lawful meanes whiche God hath ordained for vs to ſuſtaine our life withal. Otherwiſe, if all ordinary meanes be to be refuſed, let vs eate no meate, for wee ſhall not dye before God hath appoynted: let vs wilfully deſtroye our ſelues: for wee ſhall not dye before GOD hath appoynted: yea let the robbers and murtherers by the high way ſide that lay violent handes to take away the life of man, eſcape vnpuniſhed, becauſe they haue not killed any man before his time by God appointed. Which reaſons look howe vayne, fooliſhe, wicked, and vngodlye they are: euen ſo vayne, fooliſhe, wicked, and vngodlie is this; I ſhall not dye before the houre appoynted by God, therfore I will without all regard eyther of my ſelfe or others, when there is no cauſe or need, goe vnto ſuch as are infected, to the hazarding not onely of myne owne life, but alſo the life of manye others.

Chriſt when as the Diuell (the Father of ſuch kind of arguments) alleaged the charge of God giuē to his Angels ouer him to keepe him from hurt, to perſwade him to caſt him ſelfe downe headlong frō the pinacle of the temple, wheras he might vſe the ordinarie meanes of going down by the ſtayers, told him that ſo to do, was indeede to tempt God. The Heathen mariners, in whoſe ſhip Ionas was, at the ſtraunge riſing of the tempeſt,
                  Ionah. 1.5. threw all their goodes into the ſea, for the ſauegard of the ſhippe, and ſauing of their owne liues, which they needed not to haue done, if they had bin of the ſame opiniō with theſe odde felowes, but thus to haue determined the matter: we ſhall not die before our time, we wil therfore vſe no meanes at all to ſaue our ſelues, but let God work. I am aſhamed to ſtād ſo long herein, but that I know that this fond reaſon carrieth away greate multitudes, not only into the inconueniences aforeſaid, but alſo to the vtter contempt and deſpiſing of the moſt commendable art of phiſicke, as a thing vnprofitable and needeleſſe, the whiche GOD notwithſtanding hath giuen for the ſingular

helpe, profite and comforte of mankinde, which queſtion is by occaſion hā
               deled at large in this ſelfeſame Treatiſe, the which I haue preſumed to offer vnto the gentle acceptation of your H. &amp; W. as the meeteſt Patrones for ſuche a woorke, who, as you haue the charge of gouernement of this moſte woorthye Citie, ſo I perſwade my ſelfe, that you will verye carefully ſeeke in all reſpectes the welfare of the ſame, and ſo farre foorth allowe of the good aduice of this Authour, as you by your wiſedomes ſhal iudge to bee moſte meete and expedient. The principall and chiefe courſe is, to begin at true and heartie repentance, (which is the firſt thing that the maker hereof Perſwadeth in ſuch a caſe) bewailing euery man his former wicked life, with prayer and faſting, renting your heartes, and not your garmentes, and commending moſte humblye your afflicted eſtate vnto the mercifull conſideration of our heauenlie Father: and then to vſe all other lawefull remedyes that may be thought neceſſary for the auoyding of infection in ſo daungerous a diſeaſe.
            
               To which end I commend &amp; commit this litle booke to your through inſight and neere conſideration, to be followed where it is profitable, to bee ſupplyed, where it wanteth, to be corrected, where it is faultie, and to bee refuſed, in what point ſoeuer it ſhall vnto your wiſdomes ſeeme not profitable, or conuenient for your ſtate and gouernment. The Lord bleſſe your H. and W. with the true feare of his name, and a carefull deſire as well of the health of the ſoules, as the welfare of the bodies of the people, committed to your rule &amp; direction.

               THis ſmall treatiſe (right gentle and courteous Reader) comming vnto my handes at ſuche time as God beganne afreſh to viſite the Citie, and many other places of the land with the fearefull and dangerous ſicknes of the Plague: after the diligent peruſing &amp; viewing of the ſame, thinking it as well in reſpect of the matter, as in regarde of the preſent time and occaſion, a profitable diſcourſe for ſuche my godly countrie men as vnderſtood not the Latin tongue: according as my leaſure beſt ſerued from my ſchole charge, I haue occupied my ſelfe in turning the ſame into our Engliſhe and mother language, whiche being communicated with diuers of my godly, worſhipfull, and learned friendes, both Diuines, Gentlemen, and Phiſitions, they haue thought it a work very well worthie the publiſhing and ſetting abroade, to the benefite and profite of all ſuch places, as it ſhoulde ſeeme good vnto God to puniſhe with this kinde of viſitation. I haue therfore conſented to let it paſſe the preſſe, and come vnder thy godly viewe, and diligent examination, giuing thee before to vnderſtande, that in ſome places &amp; names of fiſhes whiche thou ſhalte meete withall in this diſcourſe, I haue reteined ſtill the Latin name without any Engliſhing of the ſame at al. This thyng I haue choſen to doe purpoſedly, that thou mighteſt

reſort vnto ſome learned Phiſition, heerein to vſe his skilfull aduice, rather then by my gesſing at all aduentures at the Engliſhing of the ſame (which I coulde neither learne out of any Authour, nor come to vnderſtand by conference with others, albeit very godly and learned Phiſitions) to bring thee into an errour, hauing more regarde vnto thy right inſtruction heerein, then vnto mine owne eſtimation, iudging it better in this behalfe to bee counted ignorant, then by bold aduenturing, like blind bayard, to bee worthily deemed foole hardie.
            
               Thy louing brother in Chriſte, Iohn Stockwood.
            
         
         
            
            The Preface of the Authour vnto the Reader, of the cauſes of the peſtilence.
            
               Alex. Trallian. li. pri. cap. 1
               
               IT is a receiued opinion among Phiſitions, that the firſt part of all healing &amp; curing, muſt bee called backe vnto the knowledge of the cauſes, and iudgementes. Whereas therfore the learned do often diſpute of the cauſe of this ſo horrible a ſickneſſe, the which we cal the Peſtilence, and the publike curing wherof we are to ſet down: it ſeemed vnto me to be worthie the trauaile, in few words to declare this matter, yt
                ſo much the more eaſily and diligently euery man might doe his dutie, in taming or aſſawging this dragon, as Galen rightly tearmeth him. For not without good cauſe it ſeemeth vnto ſome a thing worthie to be marueiled at, that ſo many oftētimes doe die in one houſe, into which this infection once getteth:Euery plague commeth not immediatly from God. and that ſuch as betimes flie thēce many times remaine vnhurt. Which thing they which ſuppoſe to come to paſſe by vnauoidable deſtinie, or affliction immediately ſent frō god, ſpeake in my iudgement, indiſtinctly and vnorderly.

For ſuch a plague is wont to happen not by common tokens, yea and very ſeldome, and that myraculouſly. And I nothing doubt that God doth winke at many things, and doth not at all times defend vs, which thing notwithſtanding hee is able for to doe: or to ſpeake more properly, that he doth oftentimes vſe the Diuel, yea, men alſo, and which more is, our ſelues, to trye our ſelues withall: ſo farre of is it that I woulde by any meanes denie it. Moreouer this likewiſe is a rare thing, &amp; ſuch as many old men haue not ſeen in all their life, that a plague ſhould growe of the infection of the common ayre. For in this caſe it muſt needes bee that many &amp; manifeſt ſignes goe before. Wherefore wee ſee the Aſtrologers many times to be fouly deceiued for want of due conſideration of cauſes. For how can they alwayes without errour obſerue and marke ſo hidden natures of ſo many things, and ſo diuers coniunctions and diſiunctions of all the ſtarrs? Therefore foraſmuch as it is not lawfull, neyther altogether to ſhut out God, nor raſhly to make him the Authour of our errour and ouerſight, according vnto the iudgement of the moſt learned and graue men, both Philoſophers and Phiſitions, and alſo Diuines: this may well bee affirmed, that euerie peſtilence in deede, like as other diſeaſes

euen in the iudgement of Hypocrates) and all aduerſities are of God, but yet notwithſtanding haue not all one nature: for there is one kinde of plague which may be ſaid to come only from God:
                  3. ſortes of plagues. 1. From god. and another naturall: the thirde, receiued by infection. The plague from God, when as it riſeth either immediatly from God, or by the ordinance of God (as Alexand. Bened termeth it) and by no ouerſight of nature, by no placing of the ſtars, or through the threatening of no Ecclipſe, nor through the defaulte and raſh headdines of men, that is, when as it is ſent by the meere pleaſure and wrath of God, being angrie with men for their ſinnes. And this is a moſt heauie caſe, and growing ſodenly, rageth verie hotly againſt thoſe (for we do not affirme the chaſtizing of the Lorde to bee like a bickering in the dark) who are not marked: the which we cannot auoid either by flying or medicines, or ought to ſeeke to auoid, but the way is only by ſupplication, prayer, and purgings. It is alſo oftentimes to be perceiued by plaine and feareful tokens from God, or by the voyce of God himſelfe, or his Prophete.
            
               2. The naturall plague.The naturall peſtilence is that, which commeth of cauſes by meanes, and ſuch as conſiſt in nature. This by ſome is thought to bee of three ſortes, either by meanes of the ayre, or of the

water, or of the earth▪ of others twofold (which commeth in a maner all vnto one point) namely common and priuate: of the which the one is not properly called a common diſeaſe,D. Hierom. ca. 9. in Mat. Luke 4.
                albeit manie times it bee the cauſe of a common diſeaſe, that is of a common plague. Nowe concerning that plague which happeneth by reaſon of the ayre, or of the water, or of the earth, they ſay that it hath not God either the next, or the proper cauſe, although it haue him as her Lord, to whom it is forced to obey, &amp; at whoſe becke it is ruled. Yet this plague many times doth ſo furiouſly rage, that it waſteth away moſt famous cities, moſt mightie prouinces and countries (from whence it ſeemeth to haue the name Epidemia, that is ſuch a ſicknes as haunteth a whole countrie or people) deſtroyeth whole kingdomes, vtterlye taketh awaye the former plight and countenance of a place, blinde for the moſt part (I ſpeake after the maner of men) vncertaine, vnconſtant, rouing all aboutes, vntreateable, raging without any law, taking away whomſoeuer it meeteth: without any regarde eyther of nobilitie or common ſort, infecting all things ſometimes far &amp; wyde frō the Eaſt vnto the Weſt, yea rāging vnto beaſts, vnto trees, vnto the fruits of trees, &amp; of ye
                earth

(from whence commeth that ſtarring whiche the Greekes call Aſtroboliſmos,
               Hiero▪ Card. de rer. varie. 15. cap. 18.
                or ſtarre blaſting) and finally vnto fiſhes▪ the elements being infected by ye
                noyſom meeting (as it is thoght) of Saturne and Mars in the houſe of the virgin, or of the Twinnes, through the Ecclipſe of the Moone, or of the Sunne, &amp; ſuch other like added circumſtances. This miſerable ſickneſſe, commeth many times vpon mē ſo ſodenly, that many within the ſpace of 10. or 20▪ houres without any ague, amongeſt their doinges at home or abroad, or their publike buſines, without any certaine ſigne either of vrine or pulſe, in the Church, in the high way, in publike offices, yea ſometimes in feaſtes (O lamentable condition of mans nature!) are taken away in a ſhort time vpon the ſodaine,Cor. Cel. lib. 1. cap. 10. being mery, iocond, and fearing nothing. Wherefore in this kinde of peſtilence they thinke this ſinguler remedie (flie quickly, far off, come ſlowly again) to be a moſt ſafe preſeruatiue.
            
               
                  3 The plague by infection. Franciſ. de pedem. cap. 6 de Febr. putre.As for that plague, which hath his originall and beginning from infection, the ſame is gotten either by companying or lying together, or by ſome diſpoſition from the partie that is infected with it, and commeth through the meere negligence of men: albeit at ſometimes it rage as hotly as the 2. former, whē it lighteth vpō fit

bodies, that is, ſuch as abound with il humours, or are prone vnto rottēnes,Pet. Bayr. de med. morb. diſtinc. 21. trac. 2. cap. 3 as fire amōgſt ſtuble and dayly taketh ſtrength through the careleſnes of ſuch, as are vnwarie, and deſpiſe good counſail, and liueth by mouing it ſelfe, and waxeth ſtrong by ſpreading abrod: ſo that of a priuate hurt there groweth a publike, of a particular an vniuerſal in the end, like as of a ſmal ſpark, a great fire, and according to that ſaying of the Poet,
One naughtie man oft times dooth make a Citie whole be puniſhed.
            
            This kinde of common ſickneſſe was not knowen either vnto the Greekes or Arabians, as Cardanus witneſſeth, with whome I eaſilie agree. For when as they liued more temperately,De variet. rer. 8. ca. 46. and in time ſought the helpe of the Phiſition, and receiued the ſame, and kepte companie warilye with ſuch as were ſicke, they did the more eaſily let the ſpreading abroad of this ſickneſſe.
            Which things ſtanding ſo, it may eaſily bee vnderſtood, after what ſort the ſcripture reporteth the plague to bee ſent vpon men by God, and by what meanes he deliuereth ſuch as obey his commandements from the ſame. For I willingly graunt, that no haire falleth from our head without his will, that there is no euill

in the Citie, which the Lord hath not done▪ But againe my iudgement is, that theſe things come not alwaies immediately from God, in ſuch ſort as he may be ſaid to be the next cauſe of them: naye they are to be ſaide more rightlie &amp; more properlie to grow from their owne,Ch. Pezel. 3 part. arg. Philip. de neceſſ. &amp; fat. arg. 7. W. Muſc. Loc. com. de afflict. and from ſuch nature of next cauſes, rather then in reſpecte of the prouidence of God. Becauſe that euerye thing is to haue his name from his inwarde or next groundes, that is from his owne nature, and not from outward cauſes. For what if a dronken man ſhould fall into the fire, or into the water: or through hauing his ſtomack ouerquatted with meate and drinke, ſeeking to procure vomit, ſhoulde breake a veine of the breaſte, and ſo come into a phthiſicke, will you rather laye this vnto GOD, then vnto the intemperancy of this drunken ſotte? If a man liuing in idleneſſe, and dailie ſurfetting, glutting him ſelfe vnſeaſonably and vnorderlie with too much and moiſte meate, wallowing in riotouſneſſe, giuen wholy to whordome, dauncinges, bathes, ſleepe, vſing one while the colde, an other while the hot aire, gathering great ſtore of rawnes and fleam eſpecially in the winter, and in a cold countrie, in a rainie wether, by nature moyſt, groſſe, in age verie old or young: if ſuch a one (Iſaie) fal into a quotidian ague,

will you not rather impute it vnto the nature and negligence of the man, then vnto the prouidence of God? But if beſides the ſimple rottenneſſe, theſe humours gathered together, and through the continuaunce of time by little and little waxing worſe,Ioh. Farn. de feb. 4. cap. 17
                and partaking with ſome poiſon, ſhal haue hurtfulneſſe from elſe where: and that happilye there be added hereunto the infections of the aire by infected fennes, lakes, deunes, caues, the carkaſes or dounge of men and beaſtes, or of ſome other more ſtronge ſauours, and that the proceede of the inordinate exceſſes of times and ſeaſons, and do pearſe into the bodie of man alreadie apt to receiue them, or with meate, or with the aire, or with any other meanes elſe: If, I ſay, theſe things thus fall out, and bring forth the peſtilent and euil agues of their nature, who will not rather lay the fault vpon the nature both of the aire and rottennes, and alſo vpon the raſhnes and heedeleſneſſe of men, then vpon the peculiar and meere puniſhment of God? So that the Gods in Homer doe iuſtly in this ſort complaine:
            
               Alas how mortal men on Gods do euery foote complain: affirming that their miſeries from vs proceede, when as their own deſertes &amp; wickednes beyonde their fate doe cauſe their puniſhments!
            
            
               For ſome are wrapped in the like error in a maner, in the which ſome of the interpreters of Hippocrates are intangled.
                  1. Epid. 1. Gal. in prog. Hip. cōmen. 1
                For when as he willed the Phiſitions to marke whether there were any thing from God in the diſeaſe, they (ſaieth he) drew this hereunto, as if men were ſtroken with ſickenes, through the anger of the Gods. Which Galen in his Commentaries according to the meaning of the ſame Hippocrates, doth vtterly deny. For albeit both of them iudged not diſtinctly and plainely enough of this matter, as being voide of the true knowledge of God: yet what things ſoeuer haue cauſes vnknowen to ſome bodie, or farre contrary vnto the opinion of the common people, are not by and by notwithſtanding to be ſaid, to be ſimply diuine or from God, although peraduenture a man may tearme them wonderful.
            What is the cauſe then, wil ſome man aske, why ſo commonly and conſtantly men do iudg this ſicknes of the plague aboue al others, to be a puniſhment ſent from God? It is becauſe, that for the moſt part they finde it to be a grieuous and cruell euill? For the olde Writers as well Greekes as Latines vſe to call that holye or diuine, which is vnuſuall, vehement and wonderful. Be it ſo, yet this is euidēt by the teſtimonies of learned and godly men, that, as hath bin ſaide

in the beginning, it is not alwaies a puniſhment immediately ſent from God, as they either of ignoraunce, or too much ſcrupuloſitie and ſpicednes of conſcience haue perſwaded thēſelues. S. Hierom ſaieth,Hieron. in Mat. 9. that many infirmities of the bodie (which indeede is to be graunted vnto him) doe come becauſe of ſinnes: ergo by the ſelfe ſame ſaying hee ſeemeth to ſhew, that manie doe happen for other cauſes, that is by nature, or through the vnaduiſedneſſe and negligence of men, whiche thing Luther confeſſeth willinglye of the plague of Witeberge in the yeere 27. And Baſilius the great, both in deed and name, affyrmeth that all ſickneſſes are not of nature, or of careleſſe diet, or other originalles, which Phiſicke maye helpe, but oftentimes to be God his whippes for ſinnes, ſente of God for our conuerſion, accordinge to that ſaying: Whom the Lord loueth, he chaſtizeth: yea he chaſtizeth euery ſonne, whom he receiueth.
            
            Doubtleſſe, where he ſaith not all, and oftentimes, he by the ſelfe ſame confeſſeth, that ſome ſcourges are of nature alſo, and many times not to come immediately from God. I could prooue the ſame by many and moſt manifeſt teſtimonies of moſt excellent and chiefe men, but I thinke there is no man, vnleſſe hee bee all to gether

void of eies and mind, or wedded to his own opinion, haue his wits on wol gathering (as they ſay) which wil denie the ſame. Wherefore ſith that which we ſay, is agreeable vnto truth, away with their vnskilful ſtanding in their owne opinion, who being perſwaded, that all plague commeth immediately from God, would haue no endeuour, no trauel vſed by men to the driuinge awaye of the ſame, but that only with the Heretikes called Euchites or Prayarres,There are too many, euen among profeſſours of this fond opinion. wee ought to flie vnto praier &amp; ſupplications: pratling that al the labours and charges of men are in vaine and vnprofitable: the which opinion there be ſome that haue of al other diſeaſes. For we haue to think far otherwiſe, who when as we do godly confeſſe that all things are ſubiect vnto God, and gouerned by his appoyntment: yet do hold that many thinges come to paſſe through our own defaulte and courſe of nature, the which after God, both may &amp; ought to be remedied, auoided, yea and alſo chaunged by the helpe and trauaile of man.
         
         
            
            To the right Honourable the L. Conſuls, and to the right Worſhipful the Senators of the Common wealth of Bream, Stadeen, and Boxtehud, his Lords and Patrons moſt highly to be reuerenced, ſalutation and tranquilitie.
            
               
                  IT is a thing to be lamented, (right Honorable &amp; Worſhipful) that the nature of man,The miſeries of the life of man. through the fal of our firſt Parent, is runne into ſuche miſerie, yea, and ſo farre blinded, that is, muſt continually beare not onely manye diſcommodities, tentations of Sathan, perſecutions of menne, wars, troubles, famines, al kind of diſeaſes, and finally death it ſelfe, but alſo that it neyther vnderſtandeth the cauſes of theſe euilles, nor yet ſeeketh or receiueth fitte remedies for the ſame.
            For there are many of ſo peeuiſhe nature, that if they know any, that can both ſhew thē their greef, &amp; alſo giue them medicin againſt the ſame, &amp; be moreouer willing ſo to do, they think that they are rather to laugh at them, &amp; to beare grudg and hatred againſt them, then friendly to heare them, or to giue them any rewarde for their labour. Which deſpite, if anye

in the world, truly Diuines &amp; Phiſitions are wont eſpecially to feele: as who then at length begin to be hated of ſome, when as they haue done them moſt good, &amp; do proue indeed by experience true, that which Xenophō
                affirmeth, namely ſhamleſnes to be the companion of vnthankfulnes. Which thing although it bee ſo, &amp; that I my ſelf ſōtimes haue had profe hereof, yet haue I not iudged, that I ought therfore to ſlack diligently to do the dutie of a Chriſtiā Phiſition, both in ſtudying out of ſuch thinges, as are profitable, &amp; in putting thē in practiſe which I haue founde out, by al meanes that lyeth in me, with hand and foote. Wherfore, whē as certaine yeeres paſt, folowing the counſaile of Meſua, wherin he biddeth in althings to ſet God before, I haue publiſhed, and put forth 2. treatiſes of matters in diuinitie, which are the true Phiſick of the ſoule: in the one whereof, which is written againſt the abſurd and fond hereſies of our time, I haue gone about to roote out falſe opinions, being as it were corrupt humours: in the other, which is entituled, of the knowledge of the wil, &amp; grace of God, &amp; of the fruits &amp; ſignes of this true knowledg, my meaning was with ſound doctrine of Chriſtian religion, as it were with good &amp; holſom nouriſhment, to feede and ſtrengthen the vnskilfull: I

many times thought, and hereafter wil think, if God ſpare me life, according to my power, to perfourme the ſame, in mine own proper profeſsion, that is, in the Phiſicke of the bodye.
            But whereas I haue ſpoken of Diuinitie,The ſtudie of diuinitie appertaineth vnto al. I would not haue it ſo taken, as if I meant raſhly to thruſt my ſickle into an other man his harueſt, &amp; to play the buſie body. For letting paſſe great &amp; weightie controuerſies, I onely dealt with thoſe things, which are approued of al, or inueighed againſt ſuch things, which are improued of the better ſorte, and that with ſuch reaſons, which I haue learned &amp; marked, both in the ſchooles and alſo in the Church Wherfore I think it no vnlawful thing, if the ſcholler render ſome parte of his Leſſon: ſith it is manifeſt by the teſtimony of al men, that from the firſt beginning of the world, euen vnto our time, it is not onely right and lawful, that men indued with the vſe of reaſō, might iudge of religion, but alſo that it is profitable and neceſſarie, that they be able perfectly to iudge, that is to ſaye: to diſcerne and knowe the falſe from the true, the hurtfull from the holſome, the counterfeited by men, from that which is deliuered by God. For like as al men conſiſte of two partes, that is, of a ſoule, and of a bodye, ſo alſo there ought to be in al men a twofolde

action: one, wherewith it becommeth vs to magnifie God, and to prayſe him: the other, whereby we are bounde to imploye our ſtudie and trauaile vpon the Common wealth. And as there is notwithſtanding great kinred amongſt them ſelues, betweene theſe two parts, albeit they be diſtinct and ſeueral by nature: ſo theſe actions cannot without great wickednes bee parted aſunder, the one from the other.
            Wherefore they doe very wickedly, whiche doe ſo follow their wordly buſines, either publike or priuate, that they haue either none at all, or elſe verye ſmall regarde of diuine matters: and not like men, which for the ſtudie of diuinitie doe for ſlow their matters at home &amp; abroad. Vnto whith iudgemente your wiſdome alſo giueth moſte honourable witneſſe, whileſt in your Cities you ſtudie not onely this, that your citizens may liue together commodiouſly and quietly, but alſo beeing inſtructed in the doctrine of ſaluation moſt rightly, maye walke godly and holyly. For where but one of theſe thinges onely is cared for, it cannot bee, that the Common wealth &amp; the Church can any long time be happily gouerned. Which thing, beſides the examples of certaine other countryes, the moſt afflicted kingdō of France,

and the miſerable Prouinces of the low Countries in Flaunders (alas for pitie) doe at this day declare. For what other cauſe is there of their miſerie, ſuch almoſt as hath not beene heard of, than the contempt of pure religion, the not caring for the trueth of God, and the wicked perſecution of thoſe which were followers of true godlines? For whileſt the magiſtrate doth rather ſeeke to maintaine his own authoritie then the pure ſeruice of God, conſtreineth his ſubiects to obey his wil, rather then the wil of God: And finallye giueth eare to the counſailes of moſte wicked Doeg and Machiauel, rather then vnto the counſailes of Gamaliel and Abdias: there muſt needs folow ſuch effects, as there haue gone cauſes before. And becauſe yt I know you with al your heart to deteſt this hurtful opinion &amp; meere tirannical kind of gouernment: &amp; rather endeuour hereunto, that it may go very well with your ſubiects of your dominiō, aſwel in minde, as bodie, I cannot chuſe but highly commend this godly meaning, &amp; moſt holy care of yours: and not only cōmēd it, but alſo according to my duty with my labour &amp; trauail ſuch as it is, to help forward the ſame. For as much therfore as at this time yt ſame ſore ſickenes of the plague,De ther. ad piſon. wt Galē doth rightly tearm a cruel Dragon, doth beginne

to breed euery where through out al our countrie of Germanie in a manner, &amp; is very hot in ſome places not farre from vs, and as it goeth, like vnto a Canker, eateth vppe all the thinges that are next vnto it: manye learned Phiſitions haue written diligently of the curing of thoſe, which are taken with this diſeaſe, &amp; alſo of the preſeruation of euerye perticular perſon, &amp; haue left their counſails in whole bookes, a practiſe greatly doubtleſſe to be commended: but beecauſe I haue perceiued this their endeuour not to be ſufficiēt, but that ye infectiō is daily neuertheles increaſed, &amp; groweth with his ſtirring, &amp; gathereth ſtrēgth by going, eſpecialy becauſe there is no publike courſe &amp; order taken for the auoyding of this euil, I haue cōſidered, that there is need of ſōe greater help, namly, which muſt be vſed by the authority of the magiſtrat, in whoſe trauel the chief hope of ſtaying this miſerie conſiſteth &amp; lieth. Concerning wt, whē as in times paſt I had gathered ſomthing, which I had noted in moſt famous Cities &amp; countries, partly by vſe and experience, &amp; partly had iudged to be agreeable vnto reaſon, I thought it might be a work worth the trauaile, if I ſhould beat it again vpon the anuil, &amp; ſet it forth: that if happily ſōe certaine could be perſwaded, yt for the turning away

of this euil ſome thing might bee done by the trauaile of man, they might haue ſome courſe to folow: and that if they ſhould thinke ſome thing to be wanting in my counſaile and treatiſe, they might in deed and trauaile thēſelues ſupplie the ſame. For this cauſe is not ſuche, which may content it ſelf only with fine ſpeech &amp; fit laying foorth of the matter, but ſuch as being once with wiſdome aduiſed vpon, muſt betimes be accompliſhed, and (as they ſay) bee brought into action.
            And whereas right honorable my meaning hath beene to dedicate this my paines ioyntly to your L L. there were two cauſes eſpecially mouing me thereunto: of ye which the firſt did ſeeme to binde me as it were by a certaine dutie: as in whoſe dominion I haue now ſpent almoſt theſe 18. yeeres, &amp; haue had a publike ſtipende of the common wealth of Breme in eſpeciall, and minding in a maner there to end my life, that of whom I haue receiued moſt benefits, to ye ſame I might rēder again as much duty as in me lyeth. The ſecond was cōſidered of me in the miſterie of your number cōſiſting of three, whileſt that in this Biſhopricke you ſeemed vnto me as it were in one body to repreſent three principal members, the braine, the hearte, and the liuer, and in great conſent of

mindes, in agreeable gouernment of your ſubiects, and finally in peaceable folowing of true religion, to reſemble a moſt beautifull harmonie of a trinitie: wherein I iudged my ſelfe to owe this dutie not to one of 3. (eſpecially ſith this care appertaineth indifferently vnto all magiſtrates) but vnto three rather in one. Wherefore it ſhall bee your part (right honourable and moſt reuerend Lords &amp; Patrones) to take in good woorth this teſtimonie of my readie good will and ſeruice, and to take as commended vnto you, this care of the cōmon ſaftie, which I haue heere in ſome meaſure portraited and drawen out. Which things if at any time they ſhall be ouerruled by the ordinance of God, which cannot bee called backe, it ſhall be ſufficient to haue approued your indeuour and good will vnto men.

            ¶ Of the duetie of a faithful and wiſe Magiſtrate, in preſeruing and deliuering the common wealth from infection, in the time of the plague or Peſtilence. The firſt Booke.
            
               That the care and charge of the common wealth belongeth vnto the Magiſtrate. Cap. 1.
               
                  
                     ESAIAS the diuine Prophet, &amp; Homer the chiefe of Poets,Eſay. cap. 49.60. Homer. Iliad. 1. Plato 4. de Repub. the one enlightened with the heauenlie lawe, and the other with the law of nature, haue adorned and ſet out Princes and Magiſtrates with an excellent title, whileſt the one in his tongue calleth them Omenim, that is to ſay, Nurſes, to wit of the Churche: and the other tearmeth them Poimênos Laôn, that is, Paſtors, or Shepheardes of the people: to witte for this cauſe, that they ought with wholſome lawes, and good diſcipline,

to gouerne, and defend their ſubiects, and alſo after a ſort prouide for them ſuch thinges as are neceſſarie for their food &amp; liuing. For albeit they doe not as Parentes to their children, put in euery one his hand, what to eate and drinke: albeit they nouriſhe not vs being idle, yet when as by wiſe pollicie they bring this to paſſe, that nothing be wanting, what euery mā laboureth either by traffick, or trauel, or goodes to get, and that what by honeſt meanes is gotten, the ſame he may in ſafetie poſſeſſe, and with gladneſſe enioy, they haue not without a cauſe giuen vnto them this honourable title and commendation. And as it is not ſufficient for a diligent nurſe &amp; faithful Paſtor to haue prouided for his nurſe childe,A compariſon. &amp; flock, ſuch things as are requiſite &amp; needful vnto the neceſſary vſes of life, but alſo they be careful to turne away ye things which might endammage their health, &amp; to prouide wholeſome remedy for them being in danger: So alſo the wiſe and faithful Magiſtrate ought not onely to haue care and diligence for thoſe things whiche concerne the trade of lawfull traffick, and diligent practiſe of handy crafts, the preſeruing of peace, and keeping of quiet among the Citizens, but alſo he ought to prohibite or let thoſe thinges which may eyther

take away the ſame, or greatly weaken, or infect the whole ſocietie and fellowſhippe with daylie contagion or infection, &amp; aſſayle and deſtroye with miſerable ruine, the life of euery particular member:Galen ad Piſon. cap. 2. iudging the looking vnto the common ſafetie to be the chiefeſt part of his rule and office. For if they be Goddes (and as the Pſalmiſt himſelfe both king and ruler tearmeth them) the ſonnes of the moſt higheſt,
                     Pſal. 81. certes it is their partes to knowe, that they in this poynt are with all diligence to imitate and followe GOD, of whom we daylie craue both thinges needefull, and alſo pray to bee kept from thinges not needefull or hurtfull: that they furniſhe the Citie, not onelie with profitable, neceſſarie, and wholeſome thinges, but preſerue &amp; deliuer it from thinges alſo vnprofitable and hurtfull. Which thinges when as the heathen ſawe, albeit ignoraunt of the true God, that this was a thinge highlye needefull, and in a manner heauenlie, they called their Kinges and Rulers of the people, Goddes, not proportionablie, as the Iewes and Chriſtians, but in verie deede, &amp; began to honour mortall men with honour diuine or belonging vnto God. For when as there neuer yet was anye nation ſo

barbarous, whiche had not ſome feeling of ye godhead:
                     Rom. 1. nay when as the Apoſtle in playne words affirmeth, yt for this ſame cauſe ye very Gentiles are without excuſe, becauſe ye they had written in their mindes, which might bee knowen concerning God: who would think them ſo foulie to be deceaued, in that they iudged thoſe to be, to be honored for Goddes (which Plinie ſaid to be a diuine thing) whō they ſaw to imploy al their indeuour to help others?Lib. 2. nat. hiſt. cap. 7.
                   For albeit they did not rightly giue vnto many, that thing whiche was due vnto one: yet by the power of nature they profited thus farre, that they almoſt atteyned vnto the knowledge of the nature and office of God, although they did not rightlie worſhip him. Moreouer ye Apoſtle in an other place compareth the Churche vnto the bodie of a man: for as the members of a man haue euery one their power and office, yet are all gouerned by the onely vertue of the braine, deſire and imbrace things profitable; &amp; ſhunne thinges hurtfull: ſo alſo the magiſtrates, who in this externall or outward ſocietie or fellowſhip, are the head of the common people, ought to ſet before the other Citizens profitable thinges, and keepe away thinges hurtfull, that they may bee ſaide truelie to

fulfill the office of Paſtors and Nurſes.
               But if any man wil ſay, that it is the proper office of God,Obiection. to preſerue and gouerne mankinde, the which in his ſinguler counſel he hath made: I anſwere,Anſweare. that this indeed is true, but yet as God by the miniſtery or ſeruice of man doeth teache vs, deliuer vs from ſinne, make vs partaker of his grace and ſaue vs, albeeit in very deede theſe ſame are not the workes of men: euen ſo he doth gouerne and preſerue the life of man by the ſeruice of thoſe men, whō he chooſeth vnto this office, and ſuffereth to be partakers of this prayſe. Hereuppon Romulus,
                  Cic. de leg. whiche buylded the Citie of Rome, and is thought to bee that Quirinus, was by a certayne right reckoned in the number of the Goddes,Romulus. Aug. de ciuitate Dei, 2. cap. 15. Hercules. becauſe that hee ſhewed himſelfe a louing and bounteous gouernour vnto the people. Hercules borne of Iupiter and Alcmena, gotte not onelie this name, (for thus the Oracle anſwered, Immortal fame by helping mē, thou certainly ſhalt win) which was aduā
                  ced with immortal honour, but alſo was regiſtred in the bedroll of the goddes, becauſe that with vnweariable toyle, and moſt ſinguler labour, he killed ſuch mōſters, as endammaged men, and brought them greate daunger.

                  Apollo and his ſonne Aeſculapius becauſe of their phiſicke,Apollo. Aeſculapius. wherewith they did much good vnto men, obteyned the name of gods. I bluſh at the telling of it, our Elders through a like errour builded temples vnto many, &amp; gaue honour vnto them, ſuch as belō
                  geth vnto God, of whō it is ſcarſe certayne, whether they euer were in ye world, or at leaſt wiſe any light opiniō, yt they haue performed vnto others ſuch like duetie. Wherfore, albeit we iudge them to haue committed no ſmal fault: yet in that they acknowledged them to be worthie ſinguler renowne which did good vnto many, I thinke their infirmity or weaknes rather to be to be excuſed, then to be followed. For this doubtleſſe out of their too much lightnes in belief is manifeſt, that it eſpecially cōcerneth thoſe which haue the rule of others,Galen. ad Piſon. 2.
                   to procure &amp; mainteine the ſafety of their ſubiects by al the meanes they can, all things yt might empayre the ſame beeing betimes &amp; wiſely taken out of the way. Wherfore who wil make any doubt in this ſtate of thinges whereof we here intreate, namely, of the infection of the plague, that the godlie &amp; wiſe magiſtrate ought to deale not ſlowlie, but luſtely,In Epiſtola ad Crate. (for here is no roome for ſlouth, &amp; that which Hippocrates affirmeth, delay

in all diſeaſes to be daungerous, the ſame in this death bringing ſickneſſe eſpeciallie falleth out) not ſparingly, but plenteouſly, &amp; not onelie to prouide for thinges healthfull, but alſo that concerning thinges hurtfull, he ought to be careful in time, &amp; wiſelie to turne away the ſame? For wheras the plague is a moſt hurtfull &amp; alſo moſt infectious diſeaſe, yea (as Galen ſpeaketh) as it were a certayn dragō,Vide Octauianum medic. in praefat. operis ſui. whiche breatheth out poyſon againſt mā, &amp; vtterly denieth all truſe-taking, &amp; very ſeldome commeth vnto conditions of peace, he greatlie offendeth againſt the rule of charitie, whoſoeuer according to his abilitie doeth not ſeek and bring ſome ayde, as it were a preſeruatiue, to maiſter this Dragon, and the Magiſtrate moſte of all, who in this common calamitie or miſerye both can and ought in compariſon of others to doe moſt. Neyther in this caſe ought the authoritye of certayne woorthie and moſt learned men to moue vs, who ſeeme too vndiſcreetely for to denie, that this care appertayneth vnto the Magiſtrate, whoſe office (ſay they) it is not to ridde men from diſeaſes, but onelye to mainteine the ſafetie and peace of our life and goodes. For it may euen out of their owne woordes bee prooued ſufficientlie,

that albeit the magiſtrate ought not to cure the diſeaſes of euery ſeueral man, or preſerue them from ſuche as doe not openlie raunge, nor haue common cauſes, (for this is the proper duetie of the Phiſitions) yet whē as they holde it to bee belonging to their charge, by their ſeruice and authoritie to performe, that their ſubiectes may liue commodiouſly: who ſeeth not, that this commodiouſnes doth alſo appertayne vnto the health of the bodye? Whiche thing he that beleueth not, the ſame hath neuer ſeene, howe miſerablye all the dueties of men are cumbred, the order of the Churches, the exerciſes of Godlineſſe, the inſtruction of youth, the traffike of Citizens, whereupon muſt needes enſue a moſte grieuous deſtruction of particuler perſons, when the plague troubleth a Citie or countrie. Wherefore, I appeale vnto thy ſelfe, whoſoeuer thou be that art of this opinion, that thou thinkeſt not it to bee the duetie of the Magiſtrate, to preſerue the common wealth from diſeaſes (and eſpecially commō diſeaſes) doe not ſuch ſickneſſes ſeeme vnto thee to be, to be numbred amongeſt other incommodities? And can men liue together commodiouſly, when as theſe diſeaſes doe rage? Doubtles this canſt thou not affirme,

if euer thou haſt had experience before what the Plague is, or what it may worke, where it once hath preuayled? Why then, ſay I, doeſt thou think it a thing not apperteining vnto the duetie of the magiſtrate, to deliuer mē from ſuch diſeaſes,Le. Lemnius 2. de occul. nat. miracul. cap. 4.
                   that is with publike care to defend? I pray thee haſt thou not ſeen that which is vſuall in all well ordered common wealthes, how diligently in cities the Magiſtrate prouideth and ſtoreth vp ſuche thinges as ſerue for the vſe of warre? How carefully he prepareth weapons? How buſily he reteineth garriſons ſet in a readines? Eſpecially when hee is in feare of ſome hurt to enſue? and to what ende? but that men ſhoulde liue commodiouſly. Wherefore are horſes kept; ſhippes built; walles repayred, trēches digged, towres ſet vp, and bankes caſt: but that the citizens ſhould liue more commodiouſly in ſafetie againſt the inuaſions or aſſaults of the enimies? Dogges are maynteined for the like cauſe, nettes are pitched, hunters are hyred, and troupes of countrie people drawe together, if at any time wolues or ſuche like beaſtes doe trouble a countrie. I remember in the kingdome of France, that certayne Leopards, which the king vſeth to keepe, did breake out of ward, and in euerie

place ſlue the countrie men. The whole coū
                  trie was muſtered, &amp; neither coſt nor labour ſpared, vntil they had rid the land from that feare. How much more iuſtly then in this calamitie &amp; miſerie alſo ought there ſome prouidēt courſe to be takē, wherby this ſo mightie an enimie, &amp; cruel beaſt may be kept away from our throates, which in a very ſhort time is wont to raunge verie farre, &amp; as it were a Canker, eate vp euery thing yt is next it? To the end that the cleane in the old Teſtament ſhould not keepe companie with the vnclean Lepers,Lepers. by the authoritie of the Magiſtrate, there was made a ſeparation, neither were they receiued among the other people, before that they were by the Prieſtes appoynted to this office, iudged cleanſed after they were viewed naked. In like manner at this daye after a certaine reſemblaunce of them (for the diſeaſe is not all one in them both, nor all one cauſe of ſeparation) thoſe with vs whiche are infected with the Leprie, called Elephantiaſis, are by a publike cenſure, &amp; view,

                     The common wealth of the Venetians.
                   remoued from the companie of other men. The ſame cuſtome, and with the ſame wiſedome in iudging &amp; ordering the ſicke of the plague, keepeth the moſt famous, and almoſt in the whole world the moſt mighty cō
                  mon

wealth of the Venetians, according vnto the patterne of whiche wiſedome I haue rudely drawne this treatiſe of mine ſuche as it is. The ſame doth Antwerpe a Citie almoſt in populous trade of merchandize,Antwerpe. and renowme of name, like vnto this. In the moſt noble Citie of Padway,
                  Padway. I my ſelfe haue ſeene, when as then I there ſtudied Phiſicke, the Magiſtrate, calling together the Phiſitions, and hearing the cauſe opened by them, whiche then grewe only of infection, to haue let paſſe no trauaile, no charges, to preſerue and deliuer his Citizens from the ſame, the whiche hee happily accompliſhed in ſhorte time, albeit the diſeaſe were ſcattered through the whole Citie. I can auouch the ſame of Philip the Landgraue of Haſſia,
                  Philip the Landgraue, when as the Plague began to grow in the partes neere vnto him, who ſo carefully, and ſo fatherly dealt by the aduice of his Phiſitions, whiche was publiſhed through al his dominiōs, yt he may worthily bee a patterne, for other godly and wiſe Princes &amp; magiſtrates to followe, of the which in the next Chapter ſhall be ſpoken more at large
               Laſtly, ye like did ye magiſtrat of our worthy, &amp; of me much to be honored, cōmon wealth,

when as in the yeere 1565. hee had intelligence that this wylde beaſt through the vnwary dealing of ſome, had inuaded or aſſaulted a fewe houſes of his citie: They called me into the Senate or Counſaile houſe, and aſked my direction and aduice, how they might preſerue without hurte the people by GOD committed vnto them, of a godlie care, and vnleſſe I greatly bee deceaued, a care indeede moſte beſeeming a Chriſtian Magiſtrate. Which thinges being ſo, if princes &amp; Magiſtrates be deſirous to maintaine their name (which I ſaid in the beginning, to haue beene giuen them not onely by the Prophetes, but alſo by wiſe men among the Heathen) and wil be indeed, as they are called in name, Nurſes and Paſtors, they muſt thinke that it ſtandeth them vpon, faithfully and wiſely to handle the matter, that in ſuch a time of the plague, they let paſſe no care, which may by anie meanes make for the turning away of ſo deadlie and infectious a diſeaſe, and for the preſeruing and deliuering of their ſubiectes from the ſame.
            
            
               
               That the Magiſtrate before all thinges proclayme a publike repentance. Cap. 2.
               
                  BVt ſome man maye peraduē
                  ture ſay, you ſo deale,Obiection. as if ye whole matter lay in ye foreſight &amp; ſtrength of man, and make no mention of the help of God, on whō hangeth all hope of victorie, eſpecially in ſo doubtfull a battel: whē as notwithſtanding by the iudgment of Meſua himſelfe, it is manifeſt, that in al things which we doe, we ought to ſet God before, that we may make proofe of all thinges with more ſafety and boldnes. I anſweare,Anſweare. when as I ſpeake of the duetie of a faithfull Magiſtrate, and beeing my ſelfe a Chriſtian, deale with Chriſtians, that my meaning is, to haue theſe two thinges, that is to ſay, the grace of God, and trauayle of man, ſo lincked together, that the one be not voyde of the helpe of the other. For Hippocrates hath ſayd both very well,Lib. 1. de Inſom. and verie godlye: It is indeede ſeemelie, and verie good to pray vnto the Goddes, but yet

man himſelfe ought to doe ſome thing,
                  He held of manie godes like an Heathen. 
                  and withall to call vppon the Goddes? Why ſo? Becauſe man without God can do nothing, &amp; God without man wil not doe all things. God indeed is boūteous, &amp; man verie poore &amp; needy, whē as he hath nothing which he hath not receiued at his hād, but god loueth to be aſked, &amp; yt mē by this meane ſhould acknowledge their need: wherby we ſhould be driuen to obey him in whom all our happines doth lie. If (ſaie Moſes &amp; Aaron) thou ſhalt diligently heare the voice of the Lorde thy God, and doe that whiche is right in his eyes, and ſhall obey his commandementes, and keepe all his ſtatutes, I will ſende no griefe vppon thee, whiche I haue ſent vpon the Aegyptians, becauſe I am the Lord that healeth thee: but if yee ſhall not heare me,
                  
                     Leuit. 26. 
                  ſaith God, and ſhal not doe all theſe commaundementes, and if ye ſhal refuſe my ſtatuts, and fulfil not al my precepts, but ſhal rather make void my couenant, I alſo will do this vnto you: I will viſite you with feare, ſwelling, and a burninge feuer, whiche ſhall conſume your eyes, and make your lyfe to pyne awaye. Likewiſe in many other places there is eſpecial

mention made of the plague, which god eyther threatneth vnto the diſobedient, or from the which he promiſeth to delyuer the godly: ſo that there is no doubt, that albeit we vnderſtand that euery plague is not the peculyar and proper puniſhment of GOD,Num. 14. Deut. 28. Ezech. 5. 14 2. King. 2. The firſt and chiefe remedy.
                   nor yet alwayes immediatelye ſent of God, (whiche is a thinge chieflye to bee obſerued and marked) but ſometymes commeth eyther by the courſe of nature (as hath beene ſayde beefore) or through the faulte and neglygence of men: yet whatſoeuer originall and beginning it hath, alwayes and beefore all thinges, wee muſt flye vnto the helpe of GOD, vnto whoſe myghtie hand wee moſte aſſuredly beleeue all, both ſickneſſe and health, lyfe and death to be ſubiect.
               Wherefore, when as it is manifeſt, that this cauſe alſo, whiche wee nowe haue in hande, doth eſpecially concerne the Magiſtrate, according to his power to preſerue his people from the daunger at hande, and from the infection of ſickneſſe, or to delyuer them from the ſame when it is come: Fyrſte of all lette them haue this care, that they them ſelues turninge earneſtly &amp; vnfeignedly vnto God, proclaime vnto

their ſubiectes vniuerſally, and proclaymed, execute a publike repentance, which is wont to be ſhewed by prayers made both priuatly, and alſo in the ſolemn aſſemblie, &amp; by almes and abſteyning, not onelye from meate and drinke, but from all riot, daunſing, and banquetting: after the example of the people of Niniuie,The Niniuites. vnto whom when as the Lorde by his Prophet threatned puniſhement for their ſinnes, the king inioyned a faſt of 3. dayes, not onelie vnto the men, but alſo to the bruit beaſtes, beſides other workes of repentance, that by this meanes they might reconcyle God being angrie, vnto them. When as Dauid had tranſgreſſed the commandement of the Lorde, there was ſent vpon the people ſo fierce a peſtilence, that in the ſpace of three dayes there died 70. thouſād perſons.
                     2. Chro. 20. With the which plague Dauid being moued, confeſſed vnto the Lorde his ſinne, and by prayer obteyned at his hand, that foorthwith all that affliction ceaſſed. The like is read of king Ezechias, when death was threatned vnto him,Ezechias. yet through earneſt turning vnto God, and bitter weeping, his life was prolonged by the ſpace of fifteene yeeres. It is alſo read that in the dayes of Elias,Elias. when as the heauens had bin ſhut vp three yeeres and

more, and that it raigned not a drop, whereupon folowed a miſerable dearth of victuals that at the prayer of Elias, this ſcarcitie was recompenſed with ſodaine plentie. Hitherto may worthilie be referred the commendable fact of the moſt honorable prince, D. Philip the Landgraue,
                  The Proclamation of Philip the Landgraue. whoſe publik writing concerning this matter, turned by mee into latin, I haue thought good to ſet down, as the perfect patterne of a faithful and wiſe Magiſtrate, for all men to follow: and thus it is in Engliſhe: Wee woulde haue it knowen to all and ſinguler our ſubiects, howe wee are giuen to vnderſtande, that the infectious ſicknes of the plague doth ſore rage rounde about in places, neare vnto our dominions, inſomuch that it is to be feared, that it will come alſo into our Territorie and Countrie, and aſſault our ſubiectes. For as much therefore as without all doubt, ſuch a Plague is a puniſhment for ſinne, wee doe all men to vnderſtand, that firſt of all the turne earneſtly vnto God, &amp; deſire of him pardon for their faulte: Secondly, that they vſe them ſelues moderately in eating and drinking, &amp; put their truſt in God, who is the onely and true Phiſition for our

griefe. Wee haue alſo of our louing minde to doe good vnto our ſubiectes, called together our Phiſitions, and commaunded them to take aduice, and by common conſent to conſulte and preſcribe remedies, as well for the poore as the rich, wherwith next after the calling vpō of God, euery one may preſerue &amp; defende himſelfe againſt this deadly and infectious diſeaſe, or if he be taken with it, howe hee ſhould order himſelfe, and bee healed, as by order is plainely in this our writing ſet downe: according vnto the direction whereof, let euery one after his power gouerne himſelfe: but that aboue all thinges, that hee knowe howe hee ought to truſt in God, who is our onely aide in troubles, and ſtedfaſtly to cleaue vnto him, &amp;c. Theſe are the woordes of the moſt vertuous and gentle Prince: the reſt which appertaineth vnto the order and kindes of the medicines, I will not heere expreſſe. Laſt of all, of a like teſtimonie of Godlineſſe, and loue towardes his Citizens, our Magiſtrate alſo in the yeere 65. when as our Citie was viſited with the Plague, gaue commandement vnto all the Miniſters of his Church,

that they ſhoulde often call the people to repentance, to the dueties of charitie one towardes another: to bee ſhort, that they ſhold diligently and dayly exhore them to the looking vnto the health of them and theirs, according to the rule preſcribed &amp; publiſhed by me at his commandement. For they did acknowledge that which the Apoſtle ſaide, to be moſt certaine &amp; true: God is faithful, &amp; will not the death of a ſinner but that he ſhould turne and liue. The whiche thing hee plainely proued, when as he gaue his only begotten ſonne vnto death, and that vnto the death of the croſſe for our ſakes. Alſo S. Iohn teacheth vs, that wee ſhould not ſinne: and that if we ſinne, we haue an aduocat with the father, who maketh interceſſion for the whole worlde. In theſe moſt praiſe woorthie examples ſhine foorth, and are ſhewed not only a true care of the magiſtrat towards his ſubiects, but alſo eſpeciall godlines towards God, and fruits of the truth of the Goſpel. Through the following &amp; ſteps of the whiche, euery one for his part alſo ought to be ſtirred vp &amp; ſtrēgthned to pray vnto god, &amp; vndoutedly beleeue, yt it appertaineth alſo vnto him, which Chriſt ſaid vnto ye ſick of ye palſie: Son be of good
                  
cheare, thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee: Alſo to the Leper, I will that thou be healed, be thou cleane.

                  BEeing nowe fortified with theſe preparatiues, and as it were ſpirituall weapons: namely with a good conſcience towardes God, &amp; ſure truſt of ye forgiuenes of our ſinnes (whiche are the firſt and chiefe cauſes of all miſeries) ſhewed vs, and grace promiſed, the faithfull and wiſe Magiſtrate ought to followe the vſuall and commendable cuſtome of common wealthes in the tyme of warre. And what is that? When there commethe newes, that ſome mightie Tyraunt, whome wee ſuſpecte for to beare vs yll will, is in armes, hath gathered a power, and lyeth lingering about our borders, and that it is not well knowen vpon whom firſt hee will make aſſaulte, they vſe to appoint theyr Generalles and Captaines,

which are bounde vnto them, and with theſe when as the whole Senate, or Counſaile are without power and victuals, they take aduice howe they may peraduenture goe againſt their enemie, that betimes they may driue him from their Coaſtes. The like wee doe when as counſaile is to bee taken at the ſame time for publike munition, for walles, for banckes, for gunnes, and all kinde of armour, that ſearch &amp; notice may bee taken by calling together the Ediles, Carpenters, and artificers, what they haue alreadie, what is wanting, what time and charge is needefull for the furniſhing of ſuche thinges as lacke, that laying their ſtrength together, and diducting or taking out the charges from the whole ſumme, wee may knowe howe long we are able to wage battaile. So ſurely, &amp; with no leſſe carefulneſſe,Eccle. 18 Ruffin. in praefat. hiſto. Eccle. in the rifeneſſe of ſuche infectious diſeaſes breeding, ought the Magiſtrate for to doe, that calling together the phiſitions, prouiſion with all diligence bee had, howe, after the calling vppon OOD, and the commending of vs and our affaires faithfully vnto him, ſo farre as by the trauaile and power of man,

may bee, wee may meete with the diſeaſe as it is in comming, and looke not for this: Too late the medicine is prepared, when tract of time the griefe hath rypde: nor, when the Steede is ſtolne, that then we ſhut the ſtable dore: Whiche is not only a point of great fooliſhneſſe and madneſſe, but alſo againſt the dutie of a faithfull and wiſe Magiſtrate, whiche wee haue taken in hande to ſet foorth. Vnto which matter, albeit there bee required more wiſdome and experience of thinges then I acknowledge to bee in my ſelfe: yet becauſe this argument hath beene throughly handeled of none before this time (ſo farre as I knowe) and publiſhed in writing, if I bring to paſſe nothing els, yet I ſhall procure thus muche at leaſt wiſe, that I ſhall ſtirre vp either ſuch as are better learned, to ſupplie with more ſkill, that which in mee is wanting, or that they vnto whome this charge ſhall bee committed for to execute, may performe that in deed, which ſhall be lacking in my wordes. For mee it ſhall bee ſufficient to haue made proofe, if not of any ſinguler labour, yet at the leaſt of a notable good will to benefite men. For this cauſe is not ſuch as contenteth it ſelfe with fine ſpeeche, but which being

wiſely &amp; well aduiſed vpon, ought ſpeedily to bee put in practiſe: and that whiche Plato hath ſaide of all vertue, that it is begunne of vnderſtanding, whereby is inquired what is to bee done, &amp; ended in fortitude, whereby it is finiſhed in act, the ſame doubtleſſe in this matter is eſpecially needefull.
               Where then at length or from whence ſhall wee take our beginning? namely,Preſeruers of health. from the very ſame perſons by whoſe appointmēt in a maner all thinges which hereafter are to bee ordeined, muſt bee doone and ordered: and theſe alſo as in name, ſo likewiſe in deede ſhall bee preſeruers of health: not manie in number (for nature hath ordeined a fewe to beare rule, and many to obey) but only three, choſen out of the whole companie, partly of the Senate, or as it were the Benche, and partly of the other Citizens, as they ſhall bee thought moſt meete for that purpoſe, ſounde in maners, fearing God, endued with experience of thinges, and reaſonable knowledge in learning (if it may bee) beloued of the Citizens, carefull for the publike health, faithfull, graue, yeelding nothing to their priuate gaine, glory, loue, hatred, enuy, or any affectiō. If any thing fal out, wt they are not able to deale wtal, ye ſame

they ſhall bring to the whole Senate or Benche, and from thence as from a common head ſpring, ſhall aſke what is needefull to bee done. And they are to conſider, and moſt certainely to perſwade themſelues, that the way to remoue for ye moſt part ſo great an euil, doth next after the helpe of God, conſiſt and lye in their trauaile and diligence. For as it belongeth vnto the Phiſitions to prouide that the bodies of particuler perſons fall not into the Plague through the conſtitution of the aire: ſo ſhall it be the dutie of theſe preſeruers, to let, or take away the publike and outwarde infection.
               Nowe if it, whiche I ſay, ſhall ſeeme newe vnto any man, let him vnderſtand that I heere goe about a newe in deede, but yet very neceſſarie poynt of pollicie. For it followeth not, that if a thing bee newe, it is therefore alſo hurtfull: for all things which now are old, were ſometime new: and ſuch newe thinges as notwithſtanding with aduice and reaſon are now taken in hande, and ordeined, may with good ſucces receiue age, &amp; become olde. And whereas in all partes of ye cōmon welth, there are certaine with wiſdome made rulers, which take charge of the

ſame as ye Ediles for buildings, ye Tribunes for warre, the Maiſters of ſchooles for places of learning, the viewers of Drugges for medicines. Moreouer, when as in all things order is better then diſorder alwais, and that God him ſelfe is the Authour and defendor of order, I hope that wiſe men wil eaſily graunt, that common wealthes maye admit and receiue this newneſſe. For albeit at the firſt it will ſeeme ſomewhat hard vnto ſuch as are not acquainted with it, yet by vſe it will waxe gentle, and become more acceptable or better lyked. For as Balthaſar Caſtilionenſis hath ſaide very well,De Aulico. lib. 1.
                   an Italyan writer: Vſe can doe more then reaſon, in bringing in of new thinges, and putting away of old. Now what I would haue looked vnto by this newe Magiſtrate, and what order by them is to be appoynted, as well in perſons, as in all other thinges: Moreouer, howe the hole and alſo the ſicke, (ſo far as pertaineth vnto the publik charg, for here regarde is not had of euerye particular perſon) ought beſt to be prouided for, I will diligently, plainly, and diſtinctly, as being thereunto by the whole Senate or bench required (for ſo dooth the regarde of mine office alway require) hereafter endeuour

openly to ſhew, and ſet downe euerye thing ſeuerally in his Chapiter.
            
            
               Of Phiſitions, Chirurgians, and Apothecaries. Cap. 5.
               
                  THeſe therefore appoynted Preſeruers (as I tearmed them) by the common conſent of the Senate or bench, and by ye aſſent of the Citizens (if neede be) the firſte thing of all, that they ſhal think they ought to ſee vnto, ſhalbe, that they prouide the common wealth of Phiſitions, Chirurgians, and ſuche as they commonlye call Apothecaries, ſuch as for yeares, fame, experience, honeſtie of manners, virtue, and the feare of God, they ſhall iudge to bee beſt lyked and fitte. Which conditioned men, if happilye the common wealth haue not, or cā not haue, (for it is an harde thing to finde ſuch, and ſo perfect, eſpecially in ſo daungerous times) yeat at leaſt, that they be carefull, to haue them in the next degree, and that they may

be commended, &amp; excel for faithfulneſſe, temperancie, painfulneſſe, and reaſonable experience. And theſe being hyred for a conuenient ſtipend, &amp; bounde by oth vnto the common wealth, that they take no occaſion to ſtart away, for feare of the ſickneſſe greatly increaſing (ſuch is man his weakeneſſe) they muſt ſeuerally euerye one of them bee put in minde of their office: namelye, that manfullye ſhakinge off the feare of death, they luſtilye imploye them ſelues to approue their faithfulneſſe and ſeruice both vnto God and man: conſidering that God is the beholder and iudge of the things which they doe, howſoeuer they may be hid from the cō
                  mon people vnſkilfull in the arte. If they doe anye thing through errour or deceite, that it ſhal not be vnpuniſhed: but if they ſhal behaue them ſelues in their office diligently and faythfully, that then they ſhall receyue a farre greater rewarde after this lyfe, then can of men in this world be payd vnto them. Well ſhall it go (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) with that man,
                  Pſal. 40. Eccle. 7. 
                  which faithfully dealeth with the ſicke: for at what time hee him ſelfe ſhall ſuffer any trouble, the Lorde in like manner will helpe him.
               
               The Phiſition priuatelye muſt bee putThe Phiſition.
                  
in mind by the preſeruers,Hipp. de decenti ornatu. Item in lib. de praec. med. that he often conſider, how great an hope of al men he taketh vpon him, whereby all the Citizens will haue him in admiration, and reuerence him as it were ſome God, ſent downe from heauen. Alſo how great good wil he ſhal winne among the men of all degrees, who with good ſucceſſe ſhall vſe his helpe, and be healed: and how notable a name he ſhall get amongſt others, which ſhall not be forgotten, no not after death. For albeit the vnthankfulneſſe of ſome be verye great, eſpeciallye towardes Phiſitions▪ yet many will bee ſo bounteous, that with their lyberalitie, they will bounteouſly recompence, that which others of couetouſnes foreſlow to doe. That it is the part of honeſt men to haue more regarde of their duetie then of gaine, and rather to ſeeke and haue an eie vnto the health of the Citizens, (wherunto a Chriſtian phiſition ought to referre and apply all his labours) then either vnto promotion or riches. And therefore that he ſhew him ſelfe gentle and curteous vnto al perſons, that he afoord the poore not onely his ſeruice, but alſo his monnye according to his abilitie: and that of the rich he receiue the rewarde, whiche they giue him with ſuch modeſtie and chearfulneſſe,

that he may ſeeme to loue the gifte for the mens ſake, and not the men for the gift ſake: that ambition and the wicked deſire of hauing, beecommeth bragginge and vaineglorious Theſſalians and Paracelſians, not ſuche as are deſirous of their owne health, or the health of their Citizens: But rather let them ſtudie night and day, that whatſoeuer is profitable, whereby with his arte, he may from ſo daungerous an enemie preſerue and cure thoſe that are committed to his truſte and charge, let him vſe the ſame betimes, and wiſely in the feare of God, that hee may ſo neere as may be, come vnto that point, ſpeedily, ſafely, pleaſantly (wherein doth conſiſt the whole office of a wiſe &amp; godly Phiſition.)
               Let the Chirurgions be admoniſhed,Chirurgians. that they ſhew themſelues readye and warie in all thinges. Alſo, that they imparte theyr counſailes with the Phiſitions, and doe all thinges by their appoyntment. For, albeit that now adayes through the faulte as well of times as men, it be a ſeuerall profeſſion, which in times paſt was one: and that this parte which is called Chirurgerie, be tranſlated vnto them: yet they knowe, that there are many hard poyntes in it, which vnleſſe

they learne of ſkilfull Phiſitions, and deale by their counſaile, they ſhal not be well able to keepe their ſtanding, and ſhal many times to their owne ſhame bring ſlander to ſo worthy an arte, and through their negligence and vnſkilfulneſſe be euill ſpoken of &amp; diffamed amongſt others. Let them therefore be perſwaded, that it is neyther ſhamefull nor vnſeemely, which Solon ſaid of him ſelfe,Hipp. de praecep. 
                  I waxe olde, alwayes learning ſomwhat. And that which Hippocrates ſaith: In the daunger of a preſent matter, ignoraunce caſting as it were a cloude of darkeneſſe, others alſo muſt be ſent for, that by common conſent, the cauſe of the ſicke body may be enquired on, and knowen, and that they may bee fellowe workers in helping him. For (as the ſame ſaieth) in continuaunce of the griefe, the ſickneſſe increaſinge, for wante of counſayle, manye thinges at the preſente are forgotten. But let our Chirurgians haue ready ſtuffe fit for the making of oyntments, plaiſters, and medicines, moiſtening (for with theſe inſtrumentes in this ſicknes for the moſt parte their art is finiſhed.) And let them not lacke launces to open the vaine, nor kniues to cut, nor yrons to ſeare,

if the ſore or impoſtume (as manye times it happeneth) ſhal breake out.
               Fynally,The Apothecaries. let the Apothecary be inſtructed, to haue in a readineſſe all kind of needful remedies, as wel ſimple as compound, expulſiue, preſeruatiue, &amp;c. and let him faithfullye miniſter them by the appoyntmente of the Phyſitions according to the neede of euery one, and ſell them for a reaſonable price. Let him conſider that in a maner ye whole direction and ſucceſſe of the counſaile and action of the Phyſition and Chirurgian doeth depende on him. For what ſhall profit them to deale artificiallye and paynefully, if hee vnfaythfullye and careleſlye miniſter thoſe thinges, whereby the arte and whole charge with prayſe is to bee executed? Let him not thinke, that he hath nowe gotten an occaſion to robbe and ſpoile, when as hee ſeeth the Citizens in extreame neceſſitie, compelled to come by flockes vnto his ſhoppe: but rather that hee is as it were a cooke (by which name, my meaning is not to impeach his commendation, when as neither Galen him ſelfe any thing at all reprocheth ye vnworthyneſſe of Phyſitions, in comparing his arte vnto repayring of old rotten houſes) whiche ought to aſſwage

and ſatiſfie the luſts and hunger of many: or as the ſtewarde in the hall of a great prince, which giueth meate and drinke at the commaundement of his maiſter vnto the whole familye, according vnto the diuerſitie of office, age, and dignitie: Wherefore the monnie which he receiueth, let him account not againe, but a conſideration of his charge and labour. For they that hunte after gaine, are not woont to followe iuſt dealing, but couetouſnes, nor the health of their Citizens care they for, but regarde their own vnfillable greedineſſe.Pety Phiſitions and Experimenſers roging vp &amp; down the countrey. Such as are thoſe petty Phiſitions, that roge about the countrey, and to the killing of many a man: theſe Experimenſer Iewes, Paracelciſts, Alchimiſtes, iolly braue fellowes, that is bragginge and vaine boaſtinges, Theſſalian witches and Sorcerers, men (a certaine fewe excepted) lewd and wicked, which doe not onely confound and corrupt the end of a moſt notable and diuine arte (for ſo is the aunciente and olde Phiſicke called by S. Paule) but alſo doe miſerablye defile and marre the rules thereof, and that whiche is more ſhamefull then theſe, with manifeſt iuggleries diffame it: whom godly and learned Phiſitions doe worthyly lament and diſlike, that through

the too much fauour of Princes and Magiſtrates they are ſuffered. For when as Phiſicke is an arte fet from the moſte inner ſecretes and cloſets of nature, and ſeeketh her cauſes and principles in naturall philoſophy, which is known to few Princes: Moreouer, when as theſe Rudeſibies and ignorant doltes, or at leaſt wiſe coſining runnagates amiſſe inſtructed,An vſuall thing in many places, which I haue ſeene often in Germany. commended oftentimes by the letters teſtimoniall of many, are woonte no leſſe ſhameleſly, then boldly to vaunte themſelues and their wares: The Magiſtrates that are by nature ſomwhat too mild, are ſoone deceaued, eſpecially driuē by ſome notable neceſſitie: ſo that they giue both hearing and entertainment to ſuche lewde loſels, which thing notwithſtāding, if they would deale wiſely, they ought not to doe, nor ſhould ſo raſhly commend ſuch vnhoneſt perſons with their honeſt teſtimonies. For it is a wonder to ſee, howe with theſe ſealed titles and writings, the common people, yea and they them ſelues are beſotted, puffed vp in pride, and ſhamefullye deceaue manye others. Would to God therfore, which thing al good Phiſitions wiſhe for, there might be ſome open examination and puniſhment, to puniſh this their deadlye boaſting, or at leaſt

wiſe to bring it downe, that they ſhould not dare ſo eaſily to giue out them ſelues falſlye for phiſitions, &amp; forthwith to practiſe ſo high an arte: I wold it might be by law forbiddē, yt any man ſhould giue to any to drinke, medicines, eſpecially ſuch as ſerue for purging, vnleſſe he be allowed by publike authoritie: Good God, of how manye deceites, of howe many errors, of how many daungers, that I ſay not priuie murthers, ſhould mankinde be delyuered? I would to God, I ſay, we might once ſee that day, in which this foule and filthy ſtable might be cleanſed: To the great benefit of the common wealth they are puniſhed, which ſet to ſale naughti wares: they are puniſhed which ſel bad fiſh, or fleſh: moreouer, not ſo much as a coblar in any kind of handy craft is admitted publikly to practize his arte, vnleſſe hauing ſerued a certain time as apprētize, he can approue himſelf vnto his M. and are they to be let go ſcot free, who at their pleaſure, in ſōe ſecret ſtable or dodging alehouſe, wher ye hoſt is a baud, &amp; the M. an harlot, the man a lecher, deal wt thoſe things wherein conſiſteth the publike and priuate health, or els being decayed, is reſtored, &amp; do al things deceitfully, betray &amp; ſet to ſpoyle ye health of men raſhly and ignorantly, and (to ſpeake in a word) with haynous trecherie in

s;teed of life do miniſter death? What plague can happen vnto a cōmon wealth more plaguy then this one plague? But I ceaſe with more words to inueigh againſt this rake hel Rabble: becauſe there is good hope, that our preſeruers, which we make, in ſo heauy an eſtate of things, wher otherwiſe many things vſe to be don raſhly▪ wil not deal looſely, nor by any meanes handle ye matter ſo, but yt they wil courſe away luſtily theſe harmfull Raſcals, &amp; greedy cormorants, &amp; that thoſe their phiſitiōs, whō with due aduiſe the haue once receiued, whō they haue had cōmended by honeſt teſtimonies, whom they haue gottē by ye grace of god, as men indued wt virtue, faithfulnes, tēperācie, &amp; godlines, with knowledg in learning, ye ſame they wil curteouſly entertein, vſe &amp; maintain wt al kind of fauour. Laſt of al, it ſhal not be lawful for theſe to go to any other diſeaſed perſons, then thoſe, which are ſick of the plague: which alſo is to be determined (yt al occaſiō of infectiō may euery wher be auoyded) concerning other officers publikly hyred for this purpoſe. For whē as it may ſo fal out, yt they may carry with them in their garments the infected ayre,Marcil. Ficin de Epid. cap. 2▪
                   who yet by reaſō of the ſtrong ſtate of their nature, or medicins preſeruatiue, which they haue takē or for yt they haue now a good ſeaſō bin vſed

vnto ſuche an ayer, it doe not infecte them ſelues, yet being brought vnto ſuch as haue not bin accuſtomed vnto the ſame, or as are already weake with ſickneſſe, and in daunger of euery iniury, may eaſily hurte them, what folly (I pray you) wer it, to draw from him poyſon, of whom you looke for remedy? &amp; what poiſō? Namly ſuch as receiued only by breath, or, ye which is more wonderful by the only tranſpiration or breathing through of the arteries and veines, doeth ſometimes bring preſent daunger vnto an whole family, and ſometimes vnto a whole Citie and Countrey. For it can ſcarſe be tolde, howe greatly the corruption of the ayre about vs, and howe faſte the poyſoned qualitie dooth cleaue vnto garmentes, and chiefly wollen, and how the breath in fetching the wind doth infect, and as it were with a ſecrete flame ſet on fire the veines and arteries, being the inſtrumentes of life. And let theſe thinges thus farre haue beene ſpoken of the Phiſitions of the body. Let vs hereafter go forward vnto the miniſters of the Church, who haue the charge of ſoules.
            
            
               
               Of the Miniſters of the Church. Cap. 5.
               
                  THoſe now beeing choſen and allowed, which haue the charge of the bodye, hereafter prouiſion muſt be made for ſpiritual miniſters, who may inſtruct the ſicke in fayth towardes God, and comfort them vp with hope of ſaluation, &amp; take care of their ſoules, whome the preſeruers ſhall ſo chooſe in euerye Pariſhe, that they take not to ſo weightie a matter, whoſoeuer commeth firſt to hand, but ſuch as they ſhal haue knowen to bee ſingularlye giuen vnto godlines, holines, ſobrietie, and chaſtity. For they that hitherto haue had no care of true godlynes, cannot profitably exhort any man thereunto. And the vntemperate will beeſtowe moſt of the time vpon their cups, and wil be vnprofitable vnto them ſelues, much more vnto others: eſpecially ſeeing this opinion is ſetled in the heartes of many, yt they thinke drunkennes and plenty of wine to be a notable remedy againſt this ſicknes. As for the incontinent, there will be great peril, when as in theſe times many occaſions of

ſinning are offred, and that without puniſhment, leaſt they commit ſome ſuch haynous wickednes, for the which God being rather prouoked, increaſe ye puniſhmēt, thē knoing it, keepe the ſame away. And further, they muſt not be couetous: For in this ſtate of things, no otherwiſe thē in war, or burnings of houſes,Fiue hanged at Padway. many things lie opē vnto ye ſpoile: for which kind of fact I ſawe fiue hanged at Padway, in the yeere 1556, after whoſe execution the ſicknes in ſhort time ceaſed, as if the wrath of God through the puniſhment of ſo lewd a part had bin aſſwaged. They muſt beſids be vpright men, couragious, indued wt meane learning, but not with mean charitie: let thē be wary, not raſh, &amp; let them conſider that they haue euery day death before theyr eyes. Wherfore let them put their hope and truſt in God alone, &amp; look for at his hands, rather an heauenly then an earthly reward of their labours.
               But if peraduenture there can no ſuche be founde among the ordinarye Miniſters, out of the reſt of ye people there muſt be choſē ſuch, which come vnto the next degrees of ye foreſaid virtues. For in this miſerable time ye things of moſt perfection come not alwais to be had. Therfore, as they ſay, As we can, when as we would, we may not.
               
               
                  When ſuch at length are choſen, whom the Preſeruers ſhal haue iudged meete and ſufficient for euery pariſh, it maye not by anye meanes be ſuffered, that they go to any other then ſuch as being taken with the plague, require their helpe. For I haue ſaid before, and ſay ſtil, that not only the outward and cōmon infectious ayre, but alſo contagious breaths and infectious breathinges, or blowinges, which are gathered, &amp; afterwards imparted to ye hole: &amp; others that are ſicke by the keepers, by ſuch as ſit by thē, by the miniſters of the church going hither &amp; thither, &amp; ſtāding by the infected, yea many times alſo by them that are dead, ought ſpecially to be auoided. Which thing, when as by dayly experience we are taught, &amp; haue proued alſo vnto vs to be true, by al meanes we haue to take heede, leaſt that we leaue the cauſe of this ſo great a diſeaſe in others, whom with al diligence we haue, for feare of infection put a parte. Hereunto you may add, which we haue oftē
                  times no leſſe experience of, yt many ſick perſons alſo (I ſpeak not of ſuch as are infected wt the plague) albeit they be not infected with the company of ſuch miniſters, yet they will neuertheleſſe refuſe their preſence for feare of the infection. Wherupon alſo this inconuenience wil ariſe, yt they had rather receiue

neuer ſo ſimple comfort at the hands, either of ſome of their owne houſholde, who for the moſt parte are vnmeete for this purpoſe, or els dye alone, then to vndergo a dubble miſchiefe, or receiue the vſuall Sacramentes of ye Church. Which thing, whether otherwiſe it be godly, or not godly doone, albeit it be not greatly material here to diſcuſſe, yet vpō ye occaſiō offered, I wil ſet down certein reaſons on both ſides, wherby the ſtudents in diuinity may be ſtirred vp to examin ye reaſon of this known practiſe of our elders, &amp; how farre it may be allowed, &amp; is needefull for the ſick perſons, they them ſelues may iudg: leaſt any man might think yt I wold foreiudg or preſcribe the ſkilful &amp; learned Diuines.
               They therfore which hold, that ye priuate receiuinge of the Lordes Supper maye or ought to be left vndon of the ſick, giue counſaile,Of priuate receiuing of the Lords ſupper. that whatſoeuer ſuch rites ought to be done, be done in time, and in the publike aſſembly,  that in that ſame extreame neceſſity there be no neede of this carefulnes,Reaſons of thē that deny it. whiche they ſay proceedeth partly from ye ignorance of the common people, partly of diſtruſt, and not to be without ſuſpition of a kinde of ſuperſtition.  Secondly, when as amōgſt other things, the Supper is as it were a certaine ioyful and ſolemne confeſſion and calling to

remembrance of the death and benefites of Chriſte, that it cannot conueniently &amp; comely bee done of ſuche as are halfe dead, and ſtroken with the feare of death. Thirdly  albeit they doubte not that it was ordeined for the ſtrengthening of faith: yet that there are remaining other remedies for ſuche as are in this caſe: namely, the preaching of the worde, of the which there is the like power and like effect, which is of the Sacraments. Fourthly, when as the Churche  many times is vncertaine of ye repentance &amp; tryall of the ſicke, eſpecially ſuch as are taken with this deadly diſeaſe, when as ſhee knoweth not, whether they bee moued hereunto rather through feare of death, or truſte in the worke done (as they tearme it) or coſtome rather then of a right mind which reaſon alſo in ſom place is obſerued as touching malefactours or euill doers) they thinke it with more ſafetie to be left vndone, then to bee giuen. For albeit euery man is not bounden to examine others, but themſelues, according vnto the counſaile of the Apoſtle: yet that the church ought to do nothing raſhly, but to haue diligent regard, what, who, with what fellowes, wherefore, howe, when the Sacraments are to bee miniſtred, leaſt

ſhee caſt roſes and pearles vnto ſwine, and giue that which is holie vnto dogges. Fiftly,  that alwaies the receiuers thēſelues are not this way benefited, but that many times damnation is miniſtred vnto them in ſteede of ſaluation, and iudgement in ſteed of life, not onely the Apoſtle himſelf being witnes, but alſo Hyppocrates himſelfe, who hath ſaid of vnwholeſome or vncleane bodies, that the more they are nouriſhed, the more they are hurt. Which Plato and Galen in like maner affirme of vncleane ſoules, vnto which if you offer holſome and nouriſhable ſpeeches: that is, admoniſh them of vertues or vices, they waxe not onely not the better, but alſo the worſe. Wherefore wiſe Phiſitions, when as they doubt of a diſeaſe, or of ſtrēgth of the ſick body, &amp; therfore what will be ye iſſue, they are wont to folow ye more ſafe &amp; eaſie medicines, &amp; not ſuche as may bring into danger. Laſtly, they ſay yt not ſo much as the forme, which giueth vnto euery thing his beeing, is obſerued and kept in that priuate miniſtration vnto the ſicke. For Chriſte vnto his Apoſtles, that is, vnto the Church preſent, and gathered in one, and not to one particuler perſon, deuided the Supper, and ſaid not take, but take yee: nor eate, but

                  eate yee: Finally, not drinke, but drinke yee: wherefore S. Paule in rehearſing the ordinance of Chriſte, badde not euerie man to eate his owne Supper, but one to tarry for another, that it might truly bee called a Communion, and that by the breaking and partaking of one loafe, might bee ſhewed a liuely growing together in charitie to bee made, and alſo an incorporation into Chriſt, and our neighbours and the receiuers preſent. And theſe thinges are ſo liked of the one ſide, that they woulde neuer haue this ſacrament miniſtred to any, but in the publike aſſembly. For whereas it ſeemeth vnto ſome, that as the worde may bee preached euery where, and ſet foorth to men alone either ſicke or whole: ſo alſo this Sacramēt of our Communion, may priuately bee rightlie miniſtred vnto one, they think that the compariſon is not alike. For that euery kinde of miniſterie hath his maner &amp; forme as it were, without the which they cannot be the thing that they are called, albeit all thinges tende vnto the ſame end. What that properly it is no part of the miniſterie, vnto ſicke men, or vnto others priuately without the publike aſſemblie to haue the woorde read, preached, and with the ſame, others to be admoniſhed, inſtructed, and comforted.

For that this may bee done of any, and ſo is wont to bee, yea euen of women, vnto whome notwithſtanding the publike miniſterie is not permitted, wherefore they think that here is a diſlikelihood, and that theyr cauſe as yet ſtandeth: namely, that the receiuing of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ought not to be priuate, but publike, and common vnto many.
               
                  The reaſons of them that maintaine priuate receiuing.On the contrary ſide, others contende that this vſe and cuſtome of priuate receiuing of the Supper of the Lorde ought to be reteined, if not at all times, yet at leaſt wiſe, when the whole congregation receiueth it in the Church. For albeit Chriſt (ſay they) peraduenture did it not, as who helde the Supper only once with his Apoſtles, heereof yet it followeth not, either that it is not lawful, or that the Apoſtles and the Church which followed them, did it not. For ſuch as were abſent might be letted vpon lawfull cauſes, as by ſickneſſe, or age▪ or other occaſions, ſo that they could not reſort vnto the publike aſſemblie. Hereupon the olde fathers of the true primatiue Churche, vſed to imparte it as well to ſuche kinde of perſons being in health, as to thoſe yt were ſick, to the one as the cognizance, and badge

of peace and agreement of faith, and to the other as a paſport to them that were going away. For when as the Church is as it were one vnited and whole bodie, and that Supper appointed for the whol Church, there is no cauſe (they ſay) why ſhee may lawfully denie it vnto ſome certaine members being abſent, vpon ſome ceraine lets. And wheras it is ſaide that the Churche is vncertaine of the faith and minde of ſuche perſons, albeit this peraduenture may haue place in thoſe whom it is manifeſt to haue led a looſe and lewde life before, &amp; in ſuch as are vnknowne vnto the Church: yet this principle oughte to be reteined, which hytherto hath byn vſed: The Church doth not iudge of things yt are hidden, and whoſoeuer doe confeſſe with vs with one conſent Chriſt, and in plaine words acknowledge that they repent of their ſins, being by Baptiſme ingrafted into the common bodie of the outwarde congregation, that of theſe wee ought to hope well, and to make them partakers of the outward benefites of the Church. For (ſay they) ther is not ſo great danger, as ſeemeth vnto others for to bee, and that here there is no more poyſon giuen in ſteede of medicine vnto them that craue it, thē there is to thoſe that are in body

bodie preſent, and gathered together in the congregatiō. And that we muſt not ſo much regarde vnto whom it is giuen (ſo that they be not open enemies of religion, or by force of the diſeaſe driuen out of their wittes) then what is giuen. For that the chief end of this Sacrament is, that Chriſte ſhould aſſure vs, yea, &amp; make vs partakers of his promiſe, &amp; benefites purchaſed wt his own blood (which on yt high altar of our redemption he ſhed to ſet men at libertie) yt he ſhould arme vs with faith &amp; hope, knit Chriſtiās together with the bond of mutuall loue, &amp; enflame thē as it were with a certain fire of loue. Moreouer, whē as ye ſacraments are a part of the word, &amp; as it were certain viſible words, the which alſo according vnto ye mind of others, bring no other thing, thē the word it ſelfe preached &amp; heard, albeit they doe it by another meane, they ſay there is no cauſe why ſufficient, wherefore wee ſhould more withhold them then this from any man, who thus farre, as concerneth outward conuerſation, haue byn our brethren: for who can iudge the hart, but God alone? If they haue heretofore liued ſomwhat more at large, may it not be that either a ſhort admonition of the miniſter, or a litle breathing of the holy Ghoſt, may rayſe

vp in them ſome ſmall ſparke, the which by all meanes to cheriſh, ſo as it be not againſt godlines, ſhall not be vnprofitable? Howe I pray you cā it choſe but be againſt ye wiſdom of a Chriſtiā, to depriue them frō thanks geuing &amp; remēbrance of the Lords death, who in their heart feele thēſelues to be moued to celebrate &amp; keepe the ſame with the church, that is, with their body, albeit in ſituation of place abſent therfrō, wold declare thēſelues to be a member therof, &amp; to be ſhort, are deſirous to teſtifie before others, yt they are diſpleaſed wt their former life? Laſt of al, theſe leane ſo far to this opinion, yt they thinke the ſupper of ye Lord to be no where more rightly miniſtred, thē among the ſick. For here is in deede reteined the true forme thereof, in the which it was firſt inſtituted: namely, at the point of death, or vpō ſome other vrgent &amp; great perill, ſome ſharp admonitiō goyng before. And to be brief, a liuelie faith, hope of ſaluation, earneſt prayers, &amp; an ardent mind folowing: yt is, altogether earneſtly. Which cōſideration hath ſo far liked ſome, that they haue thoght yt there could be not better reformation of the maſſe, yt is of ye abuſed ſupper of the Lord, thē to haue it made by this rule.
               Theſe things I minded to ſay here by the way, the which albeit they do but ſmally appertaine

hereunto, and haue beene ſpoken as it were beſides the cauſe, and that I my ſelfe leaue the matter in ſuſpence to bee determined by my maſters the Diuines and Gouernours of the Churche: yet heereof woulde I haue our diſeaſed people to be admoniſhed, that touching this matter they quiet themſelues, and bee not troubled in minde, if happily either through the crueltie of ſickneſſe, or for other cauſes, they cannot at that time bee partakers of this Sacrament, as cōcerning the outward ceremonie. For if the Heathen Poet haue iudged it ſufcient, ſo farre as able thou ſhalt bee, the immortall Gods to ſerue: why ſhould not rather wee Chriſtians, who by the ſonne of God are deliuered from all bondage, perſwade our ſelues the ſame, and beleeue that God, who ſearcheth the heartes and reynes, and requireth not ſo much the fact, as the mind, will as well be preſent with vs by his ſpirite, as if in the very deede we had fulfilled all the Ceremonie? For this is that ſpirituall eating or Communion, which our Elders alſo beleeued to bee done in minde, and faith, and to make vs no leſſe partakers of the body of Chriſte bringing ſaluation▪ then they are which vſe the outwarde ceremony:

if ſo be we can ſay with a conſtant and ſtedfaſt faith: Lord, I am not worthie that thou ſhouldeſt enter vnder the roofe of my houſe, but onelie ſay the worde, and my ſoule ſhalbee hole. The Lord himſelf in Iohn ſaith, I ſtood before the doore &amp; knocked, if a man heare my voyce, &amp; open the doore, I wil come in vnto him, &amp; will ſuppe with him, and he with me, &amp;c. And S. Auguſtine biddeth vs beleeue,De ciuit. de

Alſo in another place he ſaith, He that is in the vnitie of Chriſt his body, that is, in the ioyning of the members of Chriſtiās, the Sacrament of the which bodie, the faithfull receiuers are woont to take at the altar,
                  By Altar, he meaneth the

                  he indeede is to be ſaid to eate the bodie of Chriſt, and to drinke his blood. Let Chriſtians therefore perſwade themſelues of this, if they cannot by lawful meanes be partakers of the earthly part of the Sacramēts, that the heauenly may aboundantly ſuffice, the which at any time by faith to receiue is no hard matter. The ſame alſo I dare pronoūce of the comforting and ſtrengthening, which by the miniſters of the Church is wont to be made vnto the ſicke, that it is ſufficient, whē as it cannot be had otherwiſe, if they be vſed

by priuate perſons. Whiche thing that it is not diligently done, the cauſe is in the ſhamefull ſlouthfulneſſe of the common ſorte of Chriſtians, who alwayes learne, and neuer come vnto the knowledge of the trueth. For many ſo careleſly heare the publike ſermons,A cammon fault. that they bringe not ſo muche profite from thence, as that in the extreame neceſſitie of ſickneſſe or death, they can bee able in anie point according to the wil of God to inſtruct, or with godlie conſolations to ſtrengthen either themſelues, or their houſhold, who truelie ought to know this, that as it is not lawfull for ſchollers in the ſchoole to bee idle hearers: ſo alſo that it becommeth them not to come vnto the Churche as it were to beholde ſome playe of runners aboute the Countrie, but as it were vnto that place, whereas both Chriſte himſelfe the ſonne of GOD ſitteth as ruler, and the angelles marke the hearers, within a little while after as it were to take an account of euerye one, of the fruites of their diligence, and ſeuerelye to puniſhe the negligent. I praye you, if wee ſawe theſe thinges with our eyes, woulde wee not promiſe to deale earneſtlie and diligentlie, and in no caſe negligently and careleſly?A Tale. In the liues of the

fathers wee reade, that a certayne religious manne, when as hee diligently marked the Monkes according to their manner ſinging, that hee ſawe the euill ſpirits to creepe into ſome of their throates, and to prouoke them to coughing, and to ſlyde into the noſes of others, and make them to neeſe, to enter into others eares and pull them, to ſhutte vppe the eyes of others, and to cauſe them to ſleepe. Whiche thinges although they be fabulous or but a tale, yet they plainlie ſignifie, that our rechleſſe negligence, and ſlouthfulneſſe commeth from the Diuell the Father of lazineſſe and ſlouth, and that it is wicked careleſneſſe. But heereof more then peraduenture I ought. Wherefore, nowe I returne vnto the matter in hand.
            
            
               
               Of order to bee appoynted among the Citizens, and of leauing of publike meetinges and aſſemblies. Cap. 6.
               
                  THere muſt alſo an order bee ſet downe amonge the Citizens, to auoyde publike aſſē
                  blies, games, feaſtes, drinkings, marriages, daūcings, fayers, ſchooles, churches, &amp; publike bathes, For beſides that in many of theſe there is greate offence committed not onelie againſt the bodie, but alſo againſt the ſoule, there is alſo no ſmall daunger of getting and ſcattering the infection. Wherfore, wiſe men giue counſel, that at ſuch times we ſhould very ſeldome come into great companies of men. For there is no man ſo vnſkilful but he knoweth, that where as al thinges are done without conſideration as it were in a mingle mangle, yt there the infection is ſpred fartheſt, and infecteth manie. As whē the tauernes &amp; typling houſes, whither they go to drink, are opē vnto al daylie, ye market alſo, ye ſhambles, publike places alſo in which linnē is waſhed, and diuers ſortes of people are

wont to be mixed together, are haunted. In this caſe therfore lawes muſt be made by the preſeruers, whereby ſuch meetinges may be forbidden, or els ſeuered into diuers places and times.
               And firſt concerning Churchmeetinges,Of order to be kept in the church. this counſel is to be giuen, that they come not by heapes, or by thronges, neither in, nor goe out, and that they flocke not by great nūbers into one Church, where they ſhalbe driuen to fit ſtreightly and neere together, eſpeciall in one Citie: whereas there are more places fit for this purpoſe, in the whiche the diuine ſeruice, that is, the expounding of the woorde of God, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments may be done. For albeit theſe thinges may peraduenture ſeem vnto ſome to be but ſmal, and of little importance, yet nothing is to be omitted, which by any meanes may make for the turning away of the infection. And that which Cicero ſaide, that when as wee ought to doe for the benefite of men, and do ſeruice to the felowſhip of mankind, nothing is to be kept cloſe, whatſoeuer commodity or ſtore we haue, the ſame eſpecially ought to haue place at this time.
               If marriages be to be made (albeit whomOf marriages. can theſe contractes like in ſuch an eſtate of

thinges, in whiche if at anie time elſe, the counſayle of the Apoſtle ought to preuayle, that for the preſent neceſſitie it were better to remayne ſingle) let them bee kepte with a verie ſmall number of perſons, and without all pompe. As for drunkenneſſe and gormandize,Tob. 2. Amos 8. 1. Mach. 1. Prou. 14. dauncinges, and other not neceſſarie or rather daungerous and hurtefull ceremonies and faſhions, whiche for the moſte parte are woont to bee vſed: let them be ſent packing farre awaye, leaſt (as it is in the Prouerbe) this ſweete meate haue ſower ſawce, and leaſt they bewayle the nexte daye the ouerſight committed the daye before. But chieflye drunkenneſſe is ſuche a vice, which doeth not onelye greatlye offende God, where it is lefte vnpuniſhed, but alſo draweth with it other moſt horrible ſinnes, as blaſphemie, periuries, bawdries, wronges, murthers, inceſts, adulteries, fornications (al which for the moſt part are wont to iſſue out of ye vgly ſerpent, &amp; do prouoke the wrath of God againſt ye whole nation,Marcil. Fic. de Epidem. cap. 24.) I wil not ſay, yt thoſe which daily vſe this cuſtomable glutting &amp; quaffing, are more ſubiect to this ſicknes, &amp; harder to bee cured. Hiſtories report of Socrates, for yt he liued tē
                  peratly, yt he alwaies was of ſound health, althogh he liued in many great plagues, which raigned at Athēs. For (as Ariſtotle &amp; Galen
                  
ſay) there is ſuch a conſtitution in ſounde bodies, yt they ſeldom be infected with ye plague, or if they be, yet they die not. On ye other ſide, it is manifeſt by ye exāples of many newly takē with the plague,Leonar. Fuchſ. de medic. mor. li. 4. Alex. Aphr. 1. Prob, 83. yt whē as they haue plentifully filled thēſelues with wine, they haue comen into great dāger, &amp; miſerable preſent death. For in this caſe, if at any time els, the counſell of Galē
                   is moſt profitable, where he ſaith, that the body muſt be pure &amp; ſound winded. Wherfore, it is not only ye duty of ye magiſtrate, to make a law &amp; ſet a ſharp puniſhment againſt ſuch gluttōs, but they thēſelues alſo, if they wil ſeeme Chriſtiās, &amp; not rather altogether Pagās, muſt take heed, yt they run not into ye ſharp ſaying of S. Paule,Deteſtation of drunkenneſſe. in which is pronounced, yt drūkards ſhalbe ſhut out frō ye kingdō of God, &amp; let thē remēber alwaies ye cōmandement of Chriſt, where he ſaith: Take heed that your bodies be not ouerloden with ſurfetting &amp; drūkennes. Which commādemēt they which ſo careleſly dare ſet thē
                  ſelues againſt, &amp; ſtir vp others vnto ye like riot, I cānot iudge how they ſhold not be plain Antichriſtes. For what is more Antichriſtian, thē directly to caſt off ye cōmādemēt of chriſt: &amp; to cōmand ye which Chriſt forbiddeth? But I will not heere more largely rake vp this

puddle, when as ſuch offences ought not ſo much to be kept vnder with arguments as by lawes.
               
                  Of dauncinges.As for theſe daunſings &amp; friſkings, which are wont to be vſed ſo vnſeaſonably, to wit, ſtraight after meate &amp; the table taken away (for thus haue many perſwaded themſelues, if no man wil dance that is ſober, except it be a mad mā, that they deale very wiſely, if they doe it when they be drunke, that is ſtuffed and crammed till they are like to burſt againe, with wine and meate) theſe are to none more hurtful thē vnto ye dauncers thēſelues, namely, gathering together aboundance of rawe humors, which oftentimes doe quickly engē
                  der great rottenneſſe, and obſtructions, or ſtoppings of the veines, whereof are woont to growe hurtfull and peſtilent feuers. And hereof ſaieth Leonarth Fuchſius a moſt excellent Phiſition of our countrey of Germany, that he by experiēce hath tried, that many whileſt they were in dauncing, were infected with this plague and died.
               Further I ſaide alſo that publike bathes were for many cauſes to be auoyded,Of publike bathes. whiche in ſuch a time is as it were a preſent &amp; deadly poyſon: for that many and diuers ſorts of mē one with an other vſe to be gathered together

in that ſame vaporous or reeky ayer: of the whiche ſome not long before were infected with this diſeaſe, and now by ſweating wold emptie out the remnants of the ſame: others being annoynted with ſundry medicines and preſeruatiues, of the which euery one bringeth his ſeueral filth, and infectious breaths, wherewith they fill that ſame ayer ſhut in, the which ayer receiued by thoſe which are there preſent, &amp; haue their bodies now rarified or made thinne through the heate, is very eaſily drawen in by the mouth and noſtrels, and alſo by the pores or ſmal holes of the ſkin being opened, and many times beeing carried vnto the heart or brayne, or liuer by the arteryes and vaynes, may very ſpeedily corrupt with infection.
               Now concerning houſes of learning and ſchooles, in which children come together,Of ſchooles. what ſhal I ſay els, then that it ſeemeth very conuenient, and in manner neceſſarie, if wee will auoyd the ſpreading of the infection, that thoſe which cannot bee brought vnto a place more commodious, be for a time ſhut vp, and that the youth be rather taught at home, albeit with neuer ſo ſmall profit, and giue themſelues to priuate readinges, then with ſo great daunger by heapes to come together.

For the age of children and laddes, as being giuen to feeding, intemperate, tender, thin, vnwary, is wont to be more ſubiect vnto this ſicknes, then it that is elder &amp; of more yeeres. Wherefore, Rhaſes the chiefe of the Arabiā
                   Phiſitions, and after him Franciſcus Valleriola Phiſition of Arles, geue counſell that Infantes and children bee with ſpeede remoued frō infectious places into an other countrey, where they neede feare no danger of infection.
               
                  Of yeerely faires.The like may bee iudged of common and yeerelie faires, alſo of funerals or burials, wherof in their place ſhalbe intreated more at large.
               Vnto this Chapter, let the Preſeruers adde this, and earneſtly aduiſe vppon it with all the Magiſtrates, namely, whether it were better for certayne poore people, whiche get their liuing by begging from doore to doore, and by reaſon of their needie life feeding on euerie thing, are more in daunger of this diſeaſe then others, goe vnto, and runne about all ſtreetes, &amp; chiefly ſuch houſes where dead corſes are, and ſeeke vnto all men (for cruel neceſſity driueth them out of their own poore Cottages) let them I ſay conſider, whether it were better to ſende them ſome

whither elſe, or to mainteine them by the common charge at their own houſes ſo long, vntil ye ſicknes ſlack, that by this meanes occaſion may bee taken from them of running vp &amp; downe, of receiuing, and ſcattering the infection. For it can ſcarſe bee ſaide, howe great and preſent daunger doth hereby grow vnto the whole citie. For which cauſe I haue ſeene in the moſt famous citie of Padway, after this ſame manner meate daylie by the common charge allowed, not onely vnto the poorer ſort, but alſo vnto them of reaſonable wealth, which eyther had been with the ſicke, or were them ſelues infected, that ſo muche the more eaſilie they might bee kepte within their owne walles at home.Of mainteining the poore. And it were a thing highlie to bee wiſhed, that not onely in theſe times, in which eſpecially neceſſitie doeth require the ſame, but continuallie and alwayes care were had of all common wealthes, that the poore might bee otherwiſe mainteyned, then by this ſhamefull, and vnto Chriſtians reprochefull, running vppe and downe, by whiche they inure themſelues vnto nothing but idle life, and all kynde of naughtineſſe. Whiche thing that it is not done, I ſee no other let but our owne groſſe negligence. For in our parte of Chriſtendome,

there is ſcarſe any village ſo meane, but that it were able in ſome reaſonable ſorte to mainteyne their poore, if ſo be the Magiſtrates did mind the matter, and that wiſedom and order were vſed. The whiche after what manner it might and ought to be, albeeit I haue this good while beene in deuiſing, yet after I ſawe,The regiment of the poore trāſlated by M. Trip a Preacher. that the moſt godlie, and in all kynd of learning the moſt ſkilful diuine Andreas Hyperius diligently and ſufficientlie to haue ſet downe the ſame, there is no neede of my declaration.
               This alſo in this place I haue thought good to call into counſaile, becauſe that oftentimes there are manye fearefull, manye weake by nature, and vnfitte to doe ſeruice in the common neceſſity, whom it were better to liue ſome where els, that it might be both more commodious for them, and the common wealth alſo leſſe charged, whether it may be ordeyned, to ſet theſe at libertie, to get them ſelues for a time vnto ſome other place. For although that ſome either for religion ſake, or for ſhame dare not to leaue their Citie oppreſſed with common miſerie, and will not ſeeme willing to flie the hande of God: yet if by the aduice of the Magiſtrate it ſhall be thought good, and that it be done

for the ende whiche I haue ſaide, I doubte not but that with a good conſcience it is lawfull. For this waye it ſhall come to paſſe, that the leſſe multitude of people there is, ſo muche the leſſe infection there ſhall bee: and the leſſe infection there is, ſo much leſſe dying and more ſpeedye deliueraunce is to bee hoped for. For like as when the rotte is gotten into an heape of Apples, the more lye gathered together, the more it increaſeth, and the longer the rotting endureth: ſo alſo heere it commeth to paſſe, that if once the Plague bee crepte into a Citie that is populous, we ſee the ſickneſſe daylye to bee increaſed and cheriſhed a greate while, which thing is not wont in ſuch ſorte to happen in a place leſſe peopled, if the other thinges whiche wee haue ſayde alreadie and meane to ſay hereafter, be obſerued.
            
            
               Of order which is to be kept in the buying and ſelling of thinges neceſſarie. Cap. 7.
               ANd thus much of order to bee kepte among the Citizens: hereafter we muſt

ſee concerning the ſelling and buying of things neceſſary: that as before care was had of medicines for the body, and of ſacrifices &amp; Sacramentes for the ſoule: ſo alſo prouiſion be made for the Citizens of nouriſhments, vitayles, meate and drinke. For if Diogenianus haue ſaide truely, that by the thinges wherwith we liue, by the ſame alſo we get ſicknes, it is a thing doubtles greatly material, that not onelie thinges hurtful bee not brought into the citie, but alſo ye things good &amp; profitable ſhould be brought, but with ſuch a Prouiſo, that the things yt are to be brought in,Th. Taber. de peſt. lib. 8. bee ſet abroade, and ſolde with leaſt danger. Heere therefore lawes are to bee made, what kindes of meates may bee lawful to be ſold, &amp; what not: alſo for what price: &amp; laſtlie, in what places, and a certayne penaltye by the Preſeruers to bee ſet vppon the offenders.
               Firſt therefore muſt ſtreightly bee forbidden, that none of the countrie or indwellers ſet to ſale, or ſell ſweete cheries, prunes (except vngary &amp; damaſk) new grapes, &amp; figges peaches, peares, mellow &amp; ſweet apples, melons, pippins, and leaſt of all cucumers, the which (as Galen witneſſeth) haue great ſtore of iuice apt to putrifiyng: Marcil, Ficinus
                  
permitteth Gourdes, and Rhazes, who dwelled in Egypte, where there is muche drought, in a ſeaſon verie hotte graunteth hearbes, and Sommer fruites, ſuche as are colde and moyſt: which is ſcarſe lawfull for vs in this countrey to folow. Secondly,Meates not to be eaten. diligent heed muſt be taken, that no man ſel opē
                  lie corrupt or il dreſſed fiſh &amp; fleſhe, amongeſt which alſo muſt be numbred, although it can hardly be forbiddē, to yoūg lāb &amp; veale, which in certaine great cities is wont very ill to be done: alſo fiſh yt are not ſcaly, ſoft, takē in rottē pooles, as eeles, lāprous, lāpreies,Fiſh not to be eaten. &amp; the fiſhes called albuli &amp; buſtomi. For it cā ſcarſe be told, what apt matter al, theſe doe miniſter vnto rottēnes. In ye ſteed therfore of al theſe, are not only to be admitted, but alſo to be deſired, &amp; by ye preſeruers procured ſuch as are holſom, &amp; ingēder good blood, &amp; may be ſome let vnto ye ſicknes growing: as are amōg the ſūmer fruits, damaſk &amp; vngary prunes dried:Fruites to be eaten. rayſons, &amp; corinthes, ſower peaches, &amp; peares which are wont to be laid vp againſt winter, quinces, bitter almōds, capers, walnuts, ſower cheries, &amp; eſpecial Pomgrannats, orāges, limons, and citrons. Among the hearbs are, Lettiſe, Succorie, Milkethiſtle, Purſlayne,Hearbes to be eaten. Orach, Spinage, Sperache, Carduus

benedictus, Baume, Sorrel, Burrage, Burnet, Rue, Betomy, Roſemarie, Sage, Iſop, Cheruil, Parſley, Fenell, and ſuch like. The which when as all men haue not, neither can haue, it ſhall not be vnprofitable, to buy them daylie of the Gardiners, that bringe them to market.Fiſhes to be eaten. Fiſhes whiche at that time may bee eaten (albeeit euery countrey maye meaſure this according vnto the nature of ye place, for all landes bring not foorth all thinges) ſhalbe chiefly ſuch as be amongeſt ſtonie places or grauelly, as Gougeons, Loches, Pearches, Pickerels, Breames, Trowts, Soles, Sticklebagges, Bleakes, Barbels, Carpes. To teach that theſe ſhould bee ſodde in Vineger, or ſmall wine, albeit it be no ſmal remedy to preſerue health, yet doeth it not pertaine to our preſent purpoſe. For heere is ſet out the duetie of the Magiſtrate, and not the diet of particular perſons.Fleſh to bee eaten. Holeſome fleſhe are, Chickens, Capons, Hennes, Partridges, Pheiſantes, Wood doues, Turtles, Pigeons, the Attagen, Thruſhes, Starles, Sparrowes, Chaffinches, and all ſmall byrdes that liue in wooddes, buſhes and vines: alſo kids, fat Calues, and of reaſonable age, Roes, Hares, Harts, Cunnies, Oxen, Weathers. Neyther are ſpices altogether to bee ouerpaſſed,

the vſe whereof the richer ſort (for the poore make hunger and labour a ſauce) may vſe as preſeruatiues in ſaucing their meats.Spice to bee eaten. And they are theſe, Cynnamom, Saffron, Nutmegs, Mace, Cloues, whole Pepper, for ye ſtrēgth therof being of a thin light ſubſtance, is eaſily diſſolued by feathing, &amp; doth heat ouermuch. And thus much concerning meates.
               There muſt no leſſe care be vſed concerning drink, that none at al be ſuffered,Beere▪
                   which may in any reſpect bee a nouriſhment vnto rotteneſſe: and again ſuch muſt be prouided as is holſome, by the counſaile of the Phiſitions, according vnto ye cuſtom of the place. I woulde not ſpeak any thing vnto the preiudice or fore iudging of others: yet can I not allow of all kind of drinkes a like. Manardus a very learned &amp; famous Phiſition of our time diſliketh all Beere in this ſickneſſe: but becauſe hee was an Italian, and accuſtomed only vnto wine (for Italie ſcarſe knoweth our Beere) his iudgement in this point is not greatly to be accounted of. For I dare certainly affirme, that our double and ſingle Bream Beere, &amp; alſo the Beere of other cities adioyning, is not vnholſom, eſpecially, if it be cleere, well ſodden, reaſonably

hopped, and not to high coulored, for ſo it may drie the bodies, and ſtrengthen the powers, cleare the ſpirites, and after a ſort like vnto wine, make glad (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh) the heart of man. Hee that is deſirous to know the vertues of euery kind of beere, let him reade the treatiſes of ſome written of this matter, and examine them according to the rule nowe ſet down, which is applied vnto the ſtate of time, in reſpect whereof we haue directed this our whole aduice. I haue ſpoken firſt of Beere, becauſe this hath the firſt and chiefe vſe with vs: yet in the meane ſeaſon I denie not,Wine. but that wine deſerueth eſpeciall commendation, and is farre better then Beere▪ or any other kinde of drinkes, if it bee pure, &amp; not to ſtrong. The chief praiſe is giuē to white wine, pure, ripe, well ſmelling, old, auſtere, rather thē ſweet: neither is claret wine diſliked of a thin ſubſtāce, of reaſonable age, &amp; not ſtriking the head. Let the ſame iudgement be concerning made wines of Wormewood, Cardus Benedictus, Betonie, Sage, Roſemary: but of whom, whē, and in what quantitie theſe are to bee vſed, perteineth not vnto this place. Thus farre therefore of drinkes and meates: other thinges concerning food, as not neceſſarie, I purpoſely paſſe ouer, leaſt I might ſeeme

ſcrupulouſly to deale wt euery ſmall matter.
               For the price of theſe things,Of the price of things. which was the ſecond thing ſet downe, this only I am to counſaile, that there bee vſed by ye 
                  preſeruers reaſonableneſſe, not only as Ariſtotle requireth in the exchange &amp; price of things, and equall vnto the wares, but alſo ſuch as hath regard vnto the pouertie and abilitie of the chapmen, according vnto the eſtate of the perſōs, &amp; the ſame in ſuch ſort yt whileſt ye one is had care of, the other be not burdened And becauſe ye iudgemēt in this caſe is hard, this equitie is to be left vnto the diſcretion of the ſellers, with this caueat &amp; Chriſtian remembrance, yt they haue not ſo much their minds greedily ſet vpon gain (which in this ſtate of things is in no caſe ſeemely) as vppon that ſaying of ye Apoſtle: Loue ſeeketh not the things, which are her own. Againe, They that will be rich, fall into tentations: againe, let no man beguile his brother in bargaining. For what ſhall it auaile thee ſo greedilie to ſcrape together yt thing, from which thou oughteſt to feare, leaſt thou bee takē euery momēt? Thou foole (ſaith Chriſt vnto ye rich mā in ye goſpel, which here I may ſay vnto thee, O whoſoeuer thou art wt in this cōmō miſtery hūteſt after thy priuat lucre)

                  this night ſhall thy ſoule be taken from thee, and then whoſe ſhal they be, which thou haſt gathered together? Wherefore thus rather we ought to determine with our ſelues, that we in this world poſſeſſe nothing as our owne, but only are ſtewardes of another man his goods. If we haue gotten any thing to our maſter with our labor honeſtly, the labour will end, but the reward remain: but if contrariwiſe, wee ſhall haue burdened our neighbour with vnhoneſt and vnlawful taking, the iniquitie will remain, &amp; the gain haue an end. Beſides this, my requeſt is alſo in this caſe, that princes &amp; ſuch as haue cuſtomes &amp; tolles, would yeld ſomwhat of their right, vnto theſe cities &amp; people, which beeing viſited with this ſicknes, are both ouerladen with their own charges, &amp; alſo cannot vſe their wonted trafficke.
               Laſtly, alſo as touching the place, wherein all things pertaining vnto meat &amp; drinke,Of places meet for ſale. are to be ſold, ſome thing muſt be added. For it ſeemeth not conuenient, that all thinges ſhould be brought into one market. For ſo it muſt needes be, that a mightie multitude of people ſhoulde come together, &amp; that the ſauours of diuers things, many times alſo filthy &amp; ſtrongly ſmelling muſt be mixed together,

whiche thing doubtleſſe will giue no ſmall occaſion of rottenneſſe, which, if wee will auoid, the infection muſt with all diligence be ſhunned, as hath been often ſaid alreadie. There muſt therfore be ordeined many places, in ſundrie partes of the citie, wher thoſe thinges muſt be ſet, which pertain vnto foode, and are needfull for euery one. Let there alſo be a ſeuerall market for fleſh and fiiſh, for hearbes and fruites, that all diſcommodities, which may ariſe by the mingling together of a multitude of people, and bringing of things ſaleable, may with al diligēce be auoyded.
            
            
               Of purging the ayre, cleanſing the ſtreetes, putting away of kine, hogges geeſe, &amp;c. Chap. 8.
               
                  SVch things as concerne meates and drinkes, haue been ſet downe in ye chapter next before, wherein, whē as we thought good to preſcribe among other things, ſeuerall places for the ſale of ye ſame,

that the ſpreading of the infection might be hindred, and yet neuertheleſſe the rottennes, whereof oftentimes the ſame taketh not only his beginning, but alſo increaſe, can hardly bee kept from thoſe places, it foloweth by good reaſon, yt wee briefly treate of purging the ayre, of cleāſing the ſtreetes, of keeping away kine, hogges, and geeſe, the which doe greatly defile the ſame. For I ſee that al the learned, yea and the common ſort alſo doe holde this: namely, that the cauſes are to be taken away, if wee will take away ye effects, which grow of the cauſes: alſo, that the pure ayre doth make much to the ſtrengthning of the ſpirites, and vnto health, ſo that it hath giuen occaſion of a prouerbe: Such ayre, ſuch mind: alſo it is knowen, that nothing doth ſo much diſſolue the powers as ſtench. And becauſe the ſtreetes can not bee kept cleane,Firſt. nor conſequently ſtench, rottenneſſe, and vnpureneſſe of the ayre to be letted, ſo long as ſuche liuing creatures are ſuffered, which ingender ſtore of ſuch filth, theſe muſt bee put into ſome place without the Citie, which ſeemeth fit for this turne: namely, which is neere the riuer, if it may bee, that their filthie excrements may be purged into

it, or els that from thence the ſtinking reekes as little infect the Citie as may be. For the doung and excrements of thoſe beaſtes, whiche I haue ſpoken of, doe more then will be beleeued, infect and weaken the ſpirites and principall members, as the braine the heart, &amp;c.
               There is alike fault vnto this, and too abhominable (the which I maruaile to bee ſuffered in worſhipfull Cities, and I ſhame to ſpeake it) that the ſtreetes, and allies, yea and the Church yards alſo, are euerie where in ſome places ſo defiled with ye doung of ſhameleſſe Roges and Beggars, that whiche way ſo euer you turne your ſelfe (with reuerence bee it ſpoken) you will thinke you ſee not a publike and commendable way in the Citie, but a vile and beaſtlye Iakes. The like in maner you may ſay of lye water, wherewith linen clothes and veſſel are waſhed, the which maids are wont commonly to caſte before the dores of the neighbours, when as they cannot abide it at their owne houſes.
               Wherefore the Preſeruers muſte doe theyr indeuour, that when as they haue freeed the Citie from theſe beaſts they alſo commaunde

theſe filthes to be carried all away, and by lawe decree, that none heereafter do either maintaine or admit any ſuch filthines. The which yt it may the better be obſerued, there muſt be made in place fit for that purpoſe, ſties and ſtables in ſuch maner as hath been ſaid: alſo publike houſes of office, and ſinckes vnder grounde, into the which may bee carried all ſuch kind of foule ſtuffe, whiche places when they begin once to bee ful, let them be couered with lyme, to drinke it vp withall: for the other practiſe, which is vſed in carrying it out, is not without danger at that time.
               
                  Ditches about Cities.Afterwardes alſo the Ditches, if there be any within, or without the Citie (for the walles of Cities manie times are wont to bee compaſſed about with ditches, which often ſerue the common people in ſteede of priuies, whileſt they carry out into the ſame, as into ſome foule hole, all their filth) Alſo pondes and ſtanding waters, if from out of them there bee ſuſpicion of any euill reekes (as when Flaxe and Hempe, or Tanners ſkines are ſteeped in them, or when as houſes of offices by vautes vnder the grounde doe emptie their ſincks into them)

they are eyther to bee filled vp with earth, or by trenches to bee let out, and carryed awaye: or finallye, if it maye bee, they are ſome certaine tymes to bee ſcowred, by lettinge in ſome ſwifte brooke into them. For ſuch many times (as Paulus Aegineta doth witneſſe) are cauſes procuring contagious and infectious ayre.
                     Li. 1. Cap. 49 The ſame do all Phiſitions, and manye great Diuines thinke of Churchyardes, of the which ſomewhat more ſhal be ſayd in the ſecond book. Of Africa wee reade, that it was ſometymes infected with a great plague, by reaſon of a corrupt breath fuminge vp from ſea lopſters caſt vp on the ſhore, and there dying.Alex. Ben. li. 1. de pe. ca. 1.
                   The ſame witneſſeth Alexander Benedictus, to haue happened ſometymes after great earthquakes. For (ſaith he) a filthy vapour lyinge a longe time reſtinge and moulding vnder the earth, as it were in euerlaſting darkeneſſe, maye infecte the moyſt and pure ayre, and bringe newe and euill feuers: Suche as hiſtories recorde were ſometymes at Venice, by meanes whereof all women almoſt that were great with Child, were delyuered of their Children dead beefore their time, and anone after dyed of the plague, the ſame yeere.

For whereas ſome layde the cauſe hereof vppon a Dragon, which laye lurking in thoſe Caues, it was but a tale. It is needleſſe to bring hyther more examples, albeit it might bee doone in great plenty. For experience and reaſon, two chiefe cauſes of making thinges to bee beeleeued, doe agree to this opinion. Wherefore the Preſeruers muſt take great heede, leaſte, when as they haue vſed other kinds of induſtrie and payne taking, and leaue beehynde theſe preſent breeders of corruption, they loſe both their coſte, and alſo their labour.
               But heere peraduenture ſome manne will obiecte vnto mee that common ſayeinge:Purging of the ayre. 
                  that one poyſon is dryuen out with an other, lykes as one nayle with an other: Alſo the vſage of ſome Nations, who at ſuch tymes are woont not to keepe or cleanſe the places infected from euill and filthy ſauours, but to fill and ſtuffe them.

                      ſtory concerninge the countreye Sarmatia, the whiche alſo hee thinketh

maye be confirmed by naturall reaſon.
               A certayne noble Merchaunte, (ſayeth hee) of Creta
                  Li. de pe. ca. 6, when as hee traded Merchandize in the Countrey of Tauros, and that a moſte cruell Peſtilence was growne by reaſon of the corruption of the ayre, by meanes whereof there was no ende of dying, reported, that hee ſawe a Phyſition in that notoryous death of menne, a dweller of that place (for the Sarmatians doe inhabite there) who commaunded Dogges to bee kylled, and euerye where to bee caſt in the wayes and ſtreets, whiche Dogges beeing ſwollen vppe and rotten, filled the ayre with a filthy ſauour, and that by this remedie the Cittie was ſtraight reſtored to health. Alſo that the Sarmatians are woonte often to vſe this medicine.
               For the Dogges putrifying chaunged the nature of the ayre, whiche was onelye hurtefull vnto the menne. For ſo dooth vnlykeneſſe and diſcorde of thinges woorke, and one poyſon is mayſtered of an other.Zoar. Which thinge alſo one Zoar amonge the latter Arabian Phiſitions doth affyrme.
               
                  This ſtorie telleth Alexander, the which leaſt anye layſie bones might alleadge in defence of his ſloathfulneſſe, whileſt hee is deſirous to auoyde ſuch meanes and labour of cleanſing, as wiſe men doe counſayle: or leaſte anye manne ſhoulde raſhlye followe that, which he vnderſtandeth not howe it is done, the cauſe of ſo vnhearde of, and vnwoonted remedye is to bee ſought out. I graunt therefore it to bee true, that one poyſon ſometymes is driuen out with an other: but when that ſhall bee done, there muſt needes bee a manifeſt or ſecrete contrarietie of qualities beetweene thoſe thinges which dryue out one another. For otherwiſe the one will not onely flye from the other, but will rather come vnto it, and will bee ioyned and knitte in felloweſhip more ſtronglye and neerelye: For concord (ſaieth Hyppocrates) cleaueth vnto and dwelleth with concord. But things diſagreeing vse rebell, fight, and diſagree among them ſelues. It is alſo commōly ſaid, that like thinges are not onelye preſerued with lyke, but alſo increaſed and ſtrengthned: as fire vſeth to be increaſed with oyle, Naphta is a kinde of chauky clay, that burning with fire, the more water is put to it, the greater is the flame. Naphta, brimſtone, aumber woode: heat with heate: the Ague with rottenneſſe of

humours: the Dropſie with drinkinge of water, Choler with the eating of Capons, and the poyſon of the plague (as Marcill Ficinus ſaith) with wooll. And this contrarietie of qualities which I ſpake of, whē as it proceedeth from an inborne qualitie, which in diuers kindes of thinges is diuers and oftentimes hath manyfolde cauſes, euen according vnto the nature of the place, conſtitution of the ayre, temperature and diſpoſition of the ſubiect or thing it is in, and finallye accordinge vnto the proportion of the poyſon and agent cauſe, it dooth woonderfully varie, and maye rather bee vnderſtoode by the falling out of the thing, then by any ſtedfaſt reaſon. What ſhal we ſaye then vnto the queſtion put forth? Is this cure done by any manifeſt qualitie? For the nature of Dogges is drye, and the rottenneſſe, wherewith for the moſte parte the plague is ioyned, is ſayde to bee a corruption in a moyſt bodye. Or ſhall we ſaye, that the ſtench of Dogges putrifying is by a certaine ſecrete qualitie repugnaunt vnto the nature of the plague? Truly, I dare not ſay ſo, in aſmuch as this cannot be prooued (ſo farre as I knowe) by the authoritie of anye, but onely by the cuſtome of that countrey,

and the experience of that ſoyle agreeable: namelye, that there a certaine ſingular plague, a ſingular nature of Dogs, a ſingular temperature of menne, a ſingular ayre, and ſuche other thinges as are in this caſe required, doe all agree in a certayne ſingular qualitie, whiche in other partes of the woorlde, in other natures of beaſtes and menne are not in al poynts ſo lyke. Which cannot bee doubtefull vnto them,Clementius Clemen. de nat peſt. whiche are indued but with reaſonable experience of things. For the poyſon and infection of the Plague is not after one ſorte, in all times and places.
               Men alſo and other kindes of lyuinge creatures doe greatlye differ within them ſelues.
               There is ſuche a Plague, as in whiche chiefly Fyſhes dye, ſometymes fourefooted beaſtes, ſometymes Byrdes, ſometymes Mankinde, and amongeſt mankinde ſomtimes Women more then Men, and the younger more then the elder.
               
                  Hieronimus Cardanus a man moſte ſkilfull in manye thinges,Li. 4. de var. rer. cap. 4. Scrib. Larg. in pref. de compo. medi. maketh mention of a certaine plague at Baſil, with the whiche onelye the Heluetians, and not the Spaniardes, or Italians, or Frenchmen, whiche

were in the ſame Citie, were viſited, whiche truelye were to bee woondred at woorthyly, vnleſſe wee knewe the varietie of thinges to be endleſſe, and the greater parte (as Ariſtotle, the chiefe of Phyloſophers confeſſeth) to remayn alwayes vnknowne vnto vs. Therefore to conclude this doubte,De anſcul. Phiſ. I thinke that wee ought rather to followe the authoritie of moſte famous men, as well olde as newe, whiche haue handled this cauſe, when the receyued cuſtome of barbarous people of one ſtraunge place, by what experience ſoeuer, in whiche place alſo peraduenture the laſte doe not agree with the firſte in one continuall courſe.
               Wherefore, ſithence wee knowe,The power of fire. that a great parte of ſuche deadlye miſchiefe dooth depende on the corrupte, rotten, and infected ayre, and that fire aboue all thinges dooth reſiſte corruption, let vs rather vſe fire, followinge Hippocrates, then theſe outragious ſtenches, which maye greatly hurte euen thoſe that are ſounde: Let our ſtreetes ſhyne with fier, let our ayre burne with fire, the goodneſſe of whoſe ſubſtance howe great and ſubtyle it is, reade Albucaſis the Arabian Chirurgian in the firſte parte of his Chirurgerie, Chapter 1.

For the fire is moſte pure,Diſcor. 6. cap. 36. Plin. nat. hiſt. 36. cap. vlt. and purifieth all thinges, whereupon Euſebius in his church hiſtorie doeth witneſſe, that the Chaldees in olde tyme did woorſhippe it, as a mightye GOD. Water dooth cleanſe but the outwarde parte, and cannot waſhe the inner,Li. 11. ca. 26 becauſe it cannot pearſe vnto them: but fier, when as by his force he goeth through all thinges, leaueth nothing vntouched, and when as it is by nature moſt pure, as hath beene ſayde, it dooth alſo moſte ſpeedilye cleanſe all thinges. Wherefore, when as at the laſte iudgemente Chriſte ſhal moſt fullye purge all the whole worlde, the ſcripture ſaieth, that hee will come furniſhed, not with water, as in the tyme of Noah, but with fier, and finiſhe ſo mightie a woorke. For by fire wee ſee all clowdineſſe to bee ſcattered ſtronglye, all ſuperfluous moyſtures to be conſumed,Auicen. de med. cord. tract. 2. ca. 20 ye ayre to be purged, mā his heart to be kindled with gladneſſe: to witte, the troubleſome and groſſe vapours beeing ſcattered, and ſtrength added vnto the wearyed members: ſo that it is not ſayde commonlye in vaine, that as fier is a ſingular ornamente of the houſe, ſo alſo it is commoditie of men to bee wyſhed

for: in ſomuch that the Poet doeth not in vaine aſke this queſtion: What more profit brings then fire? And I, if I ſhould bee demaunded, what is the chiefeſt thing in preſeruinge a Towne from the infection of the Plague, as hee to him that demaunded, what was the chiefe poynte in an Oratour: the firſte, ſeconde, and thyrde tyme aunſwered, action: ſo I by good right myght aunſwere, that the firſte, ſeconde, and thyrde helpe, is fire: beecauſe that all the beſt beeing taught by reaſon and experience haue ſo ſet downe. For fire is vnto ayre as a triacle, which dryeth vp his rottenneſſe.
               Moreouer drying vp is the chiefeſt thing, wherein Galen ſayeth, the intention of healing of this ſickneſſe doeth conſiſte: when as moyſteneſſe, wherein happeneth rottenneſſe and corruption, is too much. Ariſtotle alſo ſaieth, that all the Elementes doe putrifie, except fire. Wherefore, when as the ayre hath gathered corruption,
                     1. de diff. feb. Metheor. 4 ca. de putred. (I meane ſuch corruption as commeth of vapours, or breathes myxed together, and drawne out of the earth or the water) which ayre, like as the ſtomack in mā receyueth al

kinde of meate and drinke, ſo dooth it receiue the fumes and reekes of all thinges, nothing can bee more profitable then fire, which dooth not onelye aſſume as the ayre, but rather conſume all corrupte and rotten vapours. For as that fire, or heate, or rather heating virtue, ſuche as is in Zedoaria, Baume, Cinamom, Angelica, and manye other ſuche lyke, cleanſeth the naturall ſpirite of man, and keepeth awaye pryuate infection: ſo our artificiall fire, of the which wee heere intreate, ſheweth forth his vſe in the outwarde ayre, and keepeth and driueth awaye the common infection, with ſingular admiration and profit.
               Wherefore leauing that naturall fire vnto Phiſitions, who are imployed about ye curing of priuat &amp; ſingular perſons, our Preſeruers ſhall haue care hereof, that in tyme cauſing to be carryed the woode of Iuniper, Oke, Vines, Beach, Cypres, Pine tree, Pitch tree, or alſo of Willowes, they command great fiers to be daily made euery where in the Cities,Great Fyers. but eſpecially where there is daunger preſentlye, or elſe ſhortelye lyke to be: And they in a manner, after lyke ſorte, although diſlike fayth, that

in tymes paſte the old heathen at certayne ſet times ordayned perfumes, Waxtorches, &amp; great fiers, ſolemnly to cleanſe and purg the Townes and Fyelds neere adioyning, both from corruption of the ayre (as I verely ſuppoſe) and alſo from Deuilles, who notwithſtanding, for that they are vſed vnto the fire, it is likly that they are not feared nor hurt with the ſame.
               Let them I pray you for GOD ſake followe that moſte excellent Hippocrates, which with his wiſdom (as witneſſeth Thucidides) delyuered Grecia ſometymes from the peſtilence of Aethiopia, and therfore was rewarded with a golden crowne. Alſo Thales, the Philoſopher of Mileſia,

Let them follow, I ſaye, rather the example of theſe, who for their wiſdome haue gotten euerlaſting praiſe throughout the wholeworld, then the barbarous and fooliſhe cuſtome of thoſe barbarous people.
            
            
               
               Of the driuing away, or keping at home of Dogs, Cats, and other tamed houſholde beaſtes, which are wonte to run vp and down. Cap. 9.
               
                  HAuinge in the Chapter afore goinge ſette downe a waye to cleanſe and purge, whiche I ſayde to conſiſte in remoouing vncleane beaſtes, in carying awaye the dounge and filth of the ſtreetes, in filling vp, or amending of ditches and pooles: and finallye, in cleanſinge of the ayre by fiers, in this place wee muſt ſee what maye according to profite and reaſon bee iudged and ſayde of Dogges, Cattes, Goates, and other tame beaſtes runninge vppe and downe.
               Heere therefore ſtraight waye after the beeginninge: I woulde haue a lawe made by the Preſeruers, for eyther the driuinge awaye, or killing, or diligent ſhuttinge vp and keeping at home of ſuch things. Which

truelye certaine common Wealthes doe wiſelye obſerue, ſo that at certaine times of the yeere, eſpeciallye aboute the heate of the Starre called Syrius, when as the Sonne entreth into the ſigne called ye Lyon,Dioſ. 6. ca. 35 whiche tyme they commonly call the Dogge dayes, they commaund the Dogs to bee kylled, the cauſe whereof I iudge to bee this: When as the Dogge,Part. 1. de feb. cap. 17.
                   (as Galen witneſſeth, albeit Gordonius otherwiſe no yll Authour thinketh him to be melancholyke) is a lyuing creature very hotte, and by nature cholericke, and hath the holes of his hearte verye ſtraight and narrowe, at that tyme when as the heate of the ayre is moſte burninge and parchinge, the humours of his heart being inflamed, and bloud aboue meaſure ryſinge vppe, hee eaſilye runneth madde: wherof afterwardes enſueth great and preſente daunger, both to men and alſo vnto other beaſtes.
               Nowe, if the lyke maye bee ſayde here, not onely of Dogges, but alſo of Cattes,The comparing of a mad dog, and a dogge infected with the plague together and other ſuch lyke, as well tame, as tamed beaſtes: Namelye, that they may as well as menne take this infectious poyſon

of the Plague, as it were a certaine madneſſe, and vnleſſe they bee kepte at home, carye it vnto others, they them ſelues manye tymes remayning without hurt: ought not the ſame courſe alſo to take place in this ſtate of common infection? Nay, ſo muche the rather ought it heere to bee of force, and to bee followed, by how muche more the daunger ought to bee feared, not onely of being touched and bytten of them, as when they be madde, but alſo of the common ayre by them infected, and of powringe and bringing the infection vnto others, whileſt they continually runne vp and downe hither and thyther.
               Moreouer, that which is woorſe then madneſſe is heere to bee added: for Dogs infected with the Plague, as when they are ſicke of other diſeaſes or harmes, they for the moſte parte come home to theyr owne houſes, and fawne vppon, and gette them neere vnto them of the houſe, as hopinge for helpe at theyr handes, or takinge as it were ſanctuarye among them, ſo that after the example of Iuda the traitour, they ſometyme wrappe their Maiſter in this daunger, and beetraye him:

whereas madde Dogges contrariwiſe for the moſte parte flying as well the knowne, as vnknowne,Dio. 6. ca. 35 gette them ſelues into wooddye places, and doe ſhewe them ſelues ſo open enemies, that a man maye beeware of them, and ſhunne them, and doe ſeldome aſſaulte and flye vpon anye other then ſuch as meete them, or ſette themſelues againſte them. Againe,The dog infected with the plague, far worſe then the mad dogge. ſuch Dogges as are taken with the infection of the plague, oftentimes through the vehemency of the diſeaſe hyde them ſelues into ſome ſecrete corner, and there dye priuilye, and beeinge dead, beefore the matter bee knowne, lye ſometimes a longe ſeaſon rotting, and defile the ayre with infectious vapours or breaths, and ſo not onelye alyue, but alſo deade, doe verie much hurt, whiche in madde Dogges falleth not out in any ſuch ſort.
               Laſtlye, if you compare together both the kindes of diſeaſes,Scrib. Larg. de compoſ. med. Alex. Bē. 26 cap. 16. Mathiol. li. epiſt. 6. albeit both of them doe rage with deadlye daunger, yet madneſſe is leſſe hurtefull, beecauſe, that for the moſte parte it giueth longer tyme of truce, and dooth not ſo ſpeedilye ouerthrow all the powers of the infected body, and therefore bringeth not ſo ſwift deſtructiō as ye plague. For

the plague is ſo ſubtyll of fine, pearſinge, vehemente, and finallye ſo hurtefull and enemilike an infection vnto the vitall ſpyrite, that it canne paſſe through what paſſages of the bodye ſoeuer, and in a fewe houres take the caſtle of lyfe, and brynge death. Which thing, ſith it is ſo, if wee thinke madde Dogges to be by all meanes to bee auoyded, it is much more agreeable vnto reaſon, that Dogges infected with the plague ſhould be auoyed.
               
                  How dogs, cats &amp;c. may infect others, and not be hurt them ſelues▪
                  But one thing peraduenture wil ſeeme incredyble vnto you, that we haue ſayde that Dogges, Cattes, &amp;c. doe remain ſomtimes vnhurte them ſelues of the plague, and neuertheleſſe to bringe it vnto others, and to infecte them. The reaſon whereof to yeelde is no harde thing. For this happeneth by the diſpoſition of the ſubiect or body that taketh it, in whiche diſpoſition according vnto Ariſtotle, Galen, Auicen, and other ſingular Philoſophers, the bringing to paſſe of the thing doth chiefly conſiſt. For when as the ſubiecte is apte, then the efficient cauſe, albeeit neuer ſo weake, can quickly bring forth the effect: like as a ſmal ſpark of fire doth quickly fire ſtraw, or brimſtone.
               
                  As againe, when as the efficient cauſe is ſtrong, then alſo is it able to ſubdue the matter, albeit not apt, and to worke vpon it at his pleaſure. For albeit Brimſtome doeth ſooner take fire then wood, and drie wood or cleft into ſheuers,Alex. Aphrod. 1. Proble. 85.
                   ſooner then greene or whole wood: yet a burning fire or fornace ſetteth on flame &amp; confirmeth as well great as ſmall, as well greene as drie wood. For ye vehement power of ye efficient cauſe, as I haue ſaide, doeth moſt ſpeedily diſpoſe and worke vpon the matter put vnder it. Hereupō 
                  Marſill Ficinus a ſinguler Phiſition,De Epid. cap. 2. &amp; a philoſopher, reporteth of a certain plague of this time: namely, in the yeere 1479. in a quarter of Italie called Corregium, that Cattes and Dogs did ſundrie times bryng the Plague frō one houſe into another, they themſelues beeing neeuer a whit hurt with the infection. The ſame is affirmed of a certaine other, whiche was infected with the Plague by his horſe, of the whiche notwithſtanding the horſe felt no hurt. All whiche thinges are ſaide to this end, that it may bee vnderſtoode, that the matter ought not to be handeled careleſly, or negligently, that our Preſeruers ſhould not thinke and perſwade themſelues, but that this hurtfull kind of infection

is to bee kept away and extinguiſhed or quenched with all their power, all their indeuour, and finally with all care and foreſight.
            
            
               Of not receiuing of trauailers and ſtrangers into the Citie, nor of bringing in of thinges without a teſtimoniall of the health of that place from whence they come. Cap. 13.
               
                  BVT truely the Preſeruers ſhall in vain altogether with this trauaile and diligence looke vnto their common wealth, if they vſe not like wiſedome in the receiuing in or ſhutting out of either men or thinges that come from other places, when as this ſicknes is nowe ryfe euerie where, and is at this time in a great part of Germaine. For what ſhall it auaile to haue remoued the Fylth of our owne places, if wee will receiue againe the corruption from others? For as this is a commendable trauaile of

the Phiſitions, that when as by purging medicines they haue firſt cleanſed the bodies of the ſicke, they afterwards wiſely take heed, that they gather not againe like ſuperfluities: alſo that no remnauntes of the diſeaſe remaine, the which might cauſe it to come againe: euen ſo alſo this Magiſtrate of ours (whome in this caſe we haue ſaid muſt bee a generall Phiſition) muſt doe his diligence in the vniuerſal and common body of the common wealth, and orderly prouide for al, that not ſo much as the leaſt peece of infection bee receiued or left behinde, wherupon newe wrackes and dangers are to bee feared. For (as the Poet ſaith) The flame that is not looked vnto,
                  Alex. Ben. lib. 1. de peſt. cap. 2.
                   
                  doeth ſtraight againe recouer. And who is ignorant that the Plague (as hath often beene noted alreadie) is a diſeaſe very infectious, and not onlie in men and beaſtes, but alſo in diuerſe thinges, as in cloth, olde yron, wood, veſſels, bedſtedles, packes, linnen, warres, houſholde ſtuffe, monie, and moſt of all in wollen Garments (vnleſſe you take meruailous great heede) may lye a long time incloſed, &amp; vpon occaſion offered wt great deſtruction far abroad to ſpread his

infection? For as a mad dogge carrieth about his poyſon oftentimes many daies,Gal. 6. de locis affec. cap. 5. yea in the iudgement of ſome, many monethes ſometimes, and alſo yeeres, before hee feele any hurt, ſo it is apparant by almoſt infinit hiſtories,Gordon. de Febr. part. 1. cap. 17.
                   which partly I my ſelfe, and partly others haue obſerued, being Phiſitions of credite, that it happeneth alſo in this diſeaſe. For I remember certaine yeeres ago, when as Colonie was viſited with a ſore plague,Alex. Ben. li. 26. cap. 16. that a certain maiden of a worſhipful houſe, with her mother and another of her ſiſters fled out of the citie,Leuin. Lem. de occul. nat. mira. cap. 5. and ſought health by going aſide into another ayre: the which mayden albeit ſhe went out hole, and came into an healthie place, yet within three dayes after ſhe was infected and dyed: wherof there was no other cauſe, but that ye plaguie infection did ſticke ſtyll either in the garments of them that fled, or in the open wayes of the ſkin, or veines not ſo neere the heart, and did not trouble her, before that it touched the very heart. For it is a light and ſmal vapour or reeke,A deſcription of the plague. which is not at ſuch deadly feede with the other members as with the hearte. For which cauſe Marſill Ficinus is not affraide to affirme, that it may lie hid in a man ſometimes two monethes without hurting

them, which if it bee true, as it is very likely, ſome doe to farre of, and too darkly caſte off this cauſe vpon the influence of Saturne, ſtaying the influence of Mars. And Bern. Cronenburgius, otherwiſe a moſt expert Phiſition, might haue more plainely and effectually anſwered certaine pratlers, and of ignorance blaming ſuche as flie away from places infected with the Plague, then by finding I know not what fault withhumours, and vnorderlie diet: by whiche meanes in deede, ſome Ague or ſmall ſickneſſe, but very ſeldome the Plague vſeth to grow. For I doe know concerning this mayden,Clementius Clement. cap de peſt. that for the godlineſſe of her minde, and ſinguler knowledge and feare of God, hereunto beeing adioyned the ripeneſſe of her age, &amp; the eſpeciall care of her mother beyng preſent principally in ſuch an eſtate of time, that ſhee offended a little or nothing at all in her dyet, nor was cumbred with no yll humour. But if this notwithſtanding ſeeme harde to bee credited of a mayden, whoſe ſexe is fleeting, I am able to affirme the ſame of both the daughter, and alſo the wife of a moſt ſkilfull Phiſition, both the which after the ſame ſort, in another place, whither they went aſide for ſaftie ſake, were taken with the plague

and dyed, whom it is likely, neither by the meanes of vnwarie diet, nor by the nature of the vnholſome place to haue taken there the infection, but to haue carryed it thyther with them. But if yet nowe theſe things cānot make you fully to beleeue, ſo that you can allowe that which I ſay, I will bringe more ſtrong reaſons. I remember that Padway a noble Citie of Italie on this ſide the Alpes (which nowe they call Lombardie) ſubiect vnto the dominion of the Venecians,
                  
                     Ann. 1556.

                   which came frō 
                  Dansk thither, mē of credite, &amp; Citizens of the ſame citie haue reported. At length to come vnto our owne home, our common wealth alſo, through the faulte of one infected perſon, which was brought from Hamborowe vnto vs ſick at the ſame time, within a very few dayes was infected, ſo that no ſtreete almoſt was free from that ſickneſſe: albeit againe ſo fewe died therein, that none of all the Sea Cities (when as euerie where they were viſited wt
                  
the plague) loſt ſo few men: through the ſinguler mercie of God no doubt, &amp; the wiſdom and trauaile of the Magiſtrat &amp; Phiſitions: which two God himſelf would haue ioyned together, &amp; doth not at all aduenture beſtow vpon vs his help without the ſeruice of mē. This therefore may ſuffice of the infection ſcattered &amp; gotten by men. In the whiche wee haue vnderſtood this to bee moſt profitable and neceſſarie for the common ſaftie of all, if the common people bee not ſo raſhly (as vſualie is wont to be done) mixed togeather, nor leaue be graunted for euerie man at his pleaſure without order or conſideration, to goe whither he will.
               Concerning the thinges them ſelues, which being brought out of infected places, haue withall brought the infection, ſo many examples come to hand, that time and paper will ſooner faile mee then examples, if I woulde rehearſe but the leaſt part of them. Letting goe therefore the eldeſt, which by reaſon of their age purchaſe the leſſe credite at our handes, let vs ſpeake of a fewe at the leaſt, and ſuch as haue happened but a little before our tyme, or els in this ſelfe ſame time of ours. There is a ſtorie recited, knowen vnto many, &amp; worth ye noting:1511.
                  
When as Verona in the borders of Italie was beſieged by the Emperour Maximilian, there happened a Plague in the campe of the Germanes, ſo that 2000. or thereaboutes dyed of the ſame. In this ſlaughter this was founde out for certaine, that 25. ſouldiers were infected and died one after another, by meanes of one leather garment. For as one departed, ſtraight way came an other, and tooke the garment, as a bootie for him, and put it on. And ſo farre went on this deſtruction, vntill that the cauſe of this death and infection was ſpied out by the Chirurgeons. Whiche thing being knowen, this leathren pylch which was in deed infectious, was caſt into the fire and burnt, and after the puniſhment thereof, the plague by little and little ſlaked, and at the lenght quite ceaſed. Alexander Benedictus (who liued in the yeere 1493.) maketh report of a certain like matter, which hapned at Venice in theſe wordes: I heard (ſaith hee) in the dayes of my father, that in the citie of Venice in the time of the Plague there was a certaine mattres ſuſpected,Venice. and caſt into the inner part of the houſe of a certaine commoner of the Citie, and after ſeuen yeeres ſought out againe, which the good

wife of the houſe willed to be dreſſed vp. For by lying long muſtying in a ſecret corner, it had gotten a greate infection, by meanes whereof, the ſeruantes were foorthwith taken with a ſodaine plague. A ſtorie not diſlike vnto this, albeit he had it not firſt from the partie, was once tolde vnto mee, whiche elſe where I haue ſet downe in Dutch, the effect whereof is thus: In the yeere 1564. when as Coloine was ſore viſited with this ſickneſſe of the Plague,A ſtrange ſtory. a certayne Carrier, who dwelled foure myles from thence, did by chaunce bring certayne wares thither, and agayne brought home with him (alas a moſt hurtfull reward for his labour) this infection, and in ſhorte time died of the ſame. Sixe weekes after (for ſo long did the poyſon keepe in without any harme doyng) died all the children in the ſame houſe, and all the ſeruauntes, the good wife of the houſe onelie remayning aliue. This beeyng done, the ſickneſſe ſtayed without any hurte almoſt two whole moneths. But when as al men hoped that all was well, beholde, the widow that was left, did by chaunce giue the ſhirt of her ſonne that was dead vnto ye ſonne of a poore bodie her neighbour, wherewith the childe being couered in the night, and on

the ſodaine infected, died forthwith together with the whole houſhold, ye mother again excepted. The which whē after ye ſame manner as before, it had now ſtaied a lōg time, &amp; at ye lēgth there came certaine ſtrāgers to dwell with the widow ye was left, ye plague whiche was thought to be dead, reuiued agayn, &amp; together deſtroyed thē al, &amp; cōtinued ſo raging vntil Ianuary, vntil yt at the laſt it alſo being cōquered wt the winter cold, died, not wtout ye great reioyſing of the neighbors. There is another no leſſe ſorowful example to bee added, which I haue obſerued in our Citie of Breme. for a certain ſmith dying of ye plage, his heire of ye ſame occupatiō, being too greedy of ye goods yt were left,Another example. alas together with the houſholdſtuf, brought both the ſicknes &amp; death alſo into his houſe. For whē as among other thinges, there was a veſſell to bath in, made after ye māner of ye coūtrey, he with 5. of his familie waſhed in the ſame,Plague in veſſel, &amp; the firſt night they were al infected with the plague, &amp; died. Hiſtories doubtles worthy the noting vnto the which albeit a man ſhal hardly finde the like, yet this which I may ſelf haue ſeene, I can̄not keepe cloſe, namely, the famous city of Venice, to haue bin almoſt wholly infected only with veſſel &amp; certaine garmentes which were priuily brought thither frō 
                  Iuſtinopolis:

albeit through the ſinguler wiſdom of the magiſtrate, &amp; the vnweariable care of all degrees, truſting vnto the help of God, it neyther continued long, nor tooke away many. The like almoſt happened not many yeers ſithens in the countie of Hoyen neere vnto vs,Another example. that a womans garment beyng brought in a certayne Village from the Citye of Hamburg, where then the ſickneſſe was, within a verye ſhorte time there dyed fiftie: and vnleſſe by and by through the grace of God it had bin ſtayed by the labour and wiſedome of the rulers, it had doubtles crept further, eſpecially through ye raſhnes of ye poore countrie people, &amp; for want of counſell what to doe. Vnto theſe I could adde (vnles ſome man might thinke thē meeter to be ſuppreſſed becauſe of the outragiouſneſſe of the matter,Padway. then to be put in ſtory &amp; publiſhed) ſuche thinges as I my ſelfe haue ſeene in the citie of Padway, namely, that the infection was wōderfully increſed through certain things infected with the peſtilēt ayer, being partly caſt priuily into other houſes yt were ſound, &amp; partly giuē vnto yōg childrē for gifts. Thē the which fact it is yet more wicked, whiche was told me as I was writing this booke, of a certaine famous city in Germany, namely

that there were certaine layers foorth of the dead, and ſuche as carrie them to Churche, who beyng eyther hyred of ſome for money, or through their owne greedie couetouſnes, that they might make their profit by the diſprofite of others,A wonderful thing. infected the publike Conduites and Ceſternes with the infectious matter which they had taken of the ſores of ſuch as were ſick of the plague. O haynous fact, cruel, wicked, and in the memorie of man vnheard of. The wicked Sorcereſſes, whom they commonly call witches, deſerue no queſtiō a great puniſhment, albeit in many places too raſhly, and ſometimes vnlawfully (let me heere ſay this by the way,He ſeemeth to diſlike with certaine others, the putting of witches to death, an opinion whiche by the worde of God cannot bee mainteintd, quod pace illorum dictum velim.
                   for learned men at this day haue throughly canuazed this matter) they vſe to be handeled, Moloch caſting water or fire vpon them on euery ſide, who is woont to bee delighted with ſuch ſacrifices: but ſhal theſe poyſoners which infect with the plague, ſeeme vnto you worthy of leſſe puniſhment?
               Wherfore, when as we haue now vnderſtood, of how greate weight a thing it is vnto the preſeruing of the common wealth, &amp; how neceſſary a medicine to keepe away infection, that we doe not raſhly receiue either men, or thinges of what ſorte ſoeuer, that

come from infected places, and this ſo much the more (if we beleeue Cardanus) by how muche thoſe places are more Eaſt (for the Plague ſaieth he, like as other thinges, is wont as it were with the daylie mouing of the heauens to goe from the Eaſt into the Weſt) when as I ſay, theſe things are thus, our Preſeruers muſt vſe ſuch heede taking,De rer. var. 15. cap. 17.
                   that appoynting and ordeining Warders at gates, they receiue no ſtraunger, nor ſuffer any thinges to be brought in, vnleſſe they haue ſome written teſtimonial, or ſealed, being woorthie credite of not beeing counterfeit. The ſame alſo muſt be obſerued in Citizens, if peraduenture (as they are woont to doe, which haue more regard vnto wealth then health▪ For through Sea, and Lande the mechaunt runneth vnto the Indes,
                  Scribō. Larg. de compoſ. medic. in Praefat. 
                  for wealth and gayne) they come home from an other countrey, and from places ſuſpected. For albeit that this neither will be ſufficient to take heede, whileſt raſhe headded perſons, and full of prattle wil ſome times goe about either to deceaue the Porters, or openly to withſtand this order as an vnuſuall bondage: yet many honeſt men wil be made the more circumſpect, and will conſider that our lawes are not perpetuall, but

tēporall, which alſo are made for their health ſake, and ſhal laſt ſo much the leſſe while, by howe much the more ſooner and timely they meete with the ſickneſſe comming, and the more diligently turne it away. For in a common aduerſity euerye man ought to put to his helping hand, and to haue more care of it, then if it were a priuate cauſe.

True charitie beginneth at it ſelfe, but endeth not in it ſelf alone: But rather it ſtretcheth out it ſelfe as farre as it can, to euerie neighbour, and according vnto her power, imparteth her helpe with euery man, and as Ambroſe ſaith of liberalitie, is commended of her faith, cauſe, place &amp; time. For what a kind of charitie ſhould this be, to receiue one ſick ſheep into the fold, and to bring the ſcab vnto the whole flocke? If charitie be a vertue (as no doubt it is a ſinguler and a diuine vertue)

it cannot be voyde of wiſedome, whiche doth as it were giue the ſhape vnto true vertue, whileſt (as it is manifeſt out of Ambroſe) ſhe hath her eye ſet vppon neceſſary circumſtances, with the which euery vertue is perfected and finiſhed. For albeit charitie haue no end, as it is alſo vſually ſaide, true loue can ſkill no end to haue, yet wil ſhee not be carried away with raſhnes, and as I ſaid euen now, wil not be voyd of wiſedome. But after what way and order, I think this duetie of charity to be to bee handled, ſhall in that which followeth be ſpokē more at large.

                  THat parte being finiſhed, whiche rather concerneth thoſe whiche are whole, then thoſe which are ſick, and therefore may be called a certayn publike preſeruatiue, it remaineth that following the practiſe and order of excellent Phiſitions, we treate in the ſame ſort of that part of phiſicke which is called Pharmaceutica, that is, of the way to heale and deliuer from ſickneſſe: if peraduenture eyther immediatly from God, or vpon ſome other

cauſe this fierce diſeaſe and cruell dragon (as Galen calleth it) haue aſſaulted the houſe of any man. And yet let not anie man looke here to haue particuler medicines for euerie priuate man ſet downe, but yt which in this caſe the faithful and wiſe Magiſtrate by publike duety is bound to doe: that a general way being found out and ordeined, wherby regarde may bee had both of the ſicke, and alſo of thoſe which are conuerſant with thē, the whole infection may be the ſooner quenched, and bring leſſe hurt to the citie.
               Wherefore in the time of ſuch ſickneſſe raygning and infecting,God firſt to bee called vpon. in the firſt kynd we haue ſaide alreadie at the beginning, that we muſt flie vnto God alone, &amp; craue pardon of him for al our ſinnes: in the latter kinds after the calling vpon of God, the preſeruers muſt firſt of all and foorthwith haue care of this,The infected houſe to be marked out by ſome token. that the houſe infected be noted and marked out by certaine ſignes &amp; tokēs, as by ſetting of torches before ye doore, which after ye maner of the Gentiles vſe to be caried before the dead, or by clubbes betokening puniſhment, or rolles of ſtrawe, or hanging vp a blacke, white, or redde ſheete, ſignifiyng ſickneſſe or death: and with all that the whole houſholde be charged, that they venture not to goe

abroade vnto others, nor to receiue any vnto them, for the ſpace of vi. or vii. weekes at the leaſt, if alſo in the meane ſeaſon they haue vſed ſufficient cleanſing of the houſe &amp; other things, which ſhall hereafter expreſly be ſpoken of. If any of his owne accorde ſhall come in vnto them, let him be bounde by the ſame charge, but for a ſhorter time. In the meane ſeaſon if they haue any thing to doe abroade, they muſt cauſe it to be done by others. For there ought greater care to be had of a whole ſocietie and felowſhip, then of a priuate familie or houſhold,

With all ſpeede, farre off, long ere you returne againe: and finally, that it is not conuenient for the ſicke thēſelues, eſpecially if the houſe be not commodious, that they ſhould remayn ſo ſhut vp, &amp; not ſometimes to vſe a more free ayre (for al keep not their beddes:) truly they which ſay this, ſeeme to ſay neither nothing, nor al things.Anſweare. For I my ſelfe thinke it to bee nothing ſafe, often to vſe the companie of the

infected, &amp; dayly to draw the corrupted ayre. Therefore in the Chapter following we wil conſider, by what meanes we may find remedie for theſe ſtreighneſſes &amp; diſcommodities, the which whileſt they can bee hurtfull vnto none, they may bee greately profitable vnto many. For to graunt them free libertie to keepe companie among others, ſhould be too raſhe and barbarous, and in a manner that which Luther alſo ſaith in this caſe,Luther. wee ſhould ſeeme to follow them whiche woulde put lice into ſkinnes, or flies into a chamber, or keepe fire in their boſome, ſauing that theſe thinges are lighter then that they may bee compared with this euill. And when as we manifeſtly finde, that this onely diſorder is the cauſe, that the infection manye times is ſo ſpeedily and ſo farre and wide ſcattered abroade, we muſt not by any meanes vſe the matter ſo, that through our owne defaulte and negligence wee our ſelues increaſe our owne wounds. Not that I denye, the plague ſometimes to come by the corruption of the common ayre (which notwithſtāding is very rare or ſeldom, &amp; a thing yt many old mē haue had no experience of) and foorthwith to take very manie, &amp; ſcatteringly without infectiō: neither alſo that I am ignoraunt that God

being angry with our ſinnes doth ſomtimes vſe this whip againſt vs, &amp; to driue vs vnto amendement of life, and to put vs in mynde, of our obedience and ſeruice towardes him (for this is apparaunt both by prophane &amp; alſo holy hiſtories) I doe not (I ſay,) deny this, neither doe I affirme that in this caſe the remedies of man doe any great good, but we ought to hope wel that theſe thinges will fall out but ſeldome, and when they doe fall out, they bewray themſelues by very euident and eſpeciall tokens. As it is playne concerning Aethiopia, by the teſtimonye of Thucydides: alſo when as God puniſhed the armie of Maximinus, perſecuting the Chriſtians, with ſo great a multitude of thē that died,Eccl. hiſt. 9. cap. 9. that the carkaſes were euery where left vnburied. Which alſo the hiſtorie of the kings reporteth of the hoſt of Dauid. Who wold denie theſe thinges?
                     2. Reg. 24. but I ſay once againe, yt theſe things are ſeldome ſeen, &amp; not agreeable vnto the plague of our countries, whoſe beginning, cauſe, and proceeding, bee that we may many times euidently enough lay downe, therefore ſo muche the more diligence and care ought we to vſe, that the euil which through our own fault and blame we haue gotten vnto vs, or through our ſlouthfulneſſe

receiued, the ſame alſo with like endeuour and trauel we ſhould amende &amp; driue away.
               Wherefore, when a houſe is ſo marked, &amp; as it were condemned for an infectious Lepri, ye houſhold either of their owne accord and priuate charges, if they be able to pay, or by the perſwaſion and charges of the preſeruers, if they bee poore, muſt by and by ſende for the helpe of the Phiſitions appoynted for that purpoſe,Eccl. 38.39. and making their prayers vnto God, not grudgingly, but cheerefully, and with good hope admit them and receiue thē in al thinges that ſhalbe needfull. For it is to be thought, that the benefite which God here in wil ſhew, the ſame oftentimes hee giueth by the Phiſitions as his miniſters, no otherwiſe then the good man of the houſe is wont by his ſtewards to giue and point out meate and drinke vnto his houſhold.Leuin. Lem. de lib. Bibl. cap. 1. Sap. 8, cap. 2.

The which cauſe (albeeit beſides the cauſe) let it bee lawfull for mee with the good leaue of the reader, becauſe of the vniuſt iudgement of ſome vnlearned perſons ſomwhat more at large in this place

to handle.
               For firſt of all Ieſus Syrach, a man amongeſt the Hebrewes ſingulerly endued with godlineſſe, wiſedome, and the knowledge of thinges, and finally with the Spirite of GOD,Of the vſe and praiſe of phiſick. hath left thus written: Honour the Phiſition, for the Lorde created him for necesſitie. Phiſicke is from the higheſt, and of the king he ſhall receiue rewards.
                  Eccle. 38. 
                  The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth, &amp; a wiſe man doth not deſpiſe them. Giue place to the phiſition, for the Lord hath created him, thus ſaith Sirach: what I pray you meaneth in this place this doubled and often repeated word creation? what meaneth his beginning &amp; cōmendation, but that we ſhould vnderſtād yt the Phiſition &amp; phiſicke is the gift of God, the which it is not onely lawfull, but alſo whō we ought to vſe, whē need is, &amp; neceſſity requireth? and yt thoſe doubtles are vnſkilful, &amp; very ignorāt of ye coūſel of God &amp; block beades, who doe iudge phiſicke to be needles and vnprofitable, when as without al doubt it was giuē of God vnto mankind, for the preſeruing &amp; repayring of health ſake.Scrib. Larg. de com. med. Hereupō alſo the very heathen haue acknowledged the excellēcy therof, whē as they write yt not mā

                  Corn. Cel. lib. 1.
                   albeit he maketh no mention of ye beginning of phiſick or of phiſitiōs, yet doth he not doubt to renowne it with a moſt excellent cōmendation, when he ſaith: that man which hath in Phiſicke ſkill, the ſame all others farre doth paſſe. Which thing ye old romaine emperors acknowledging, did pay yeerly vnto phiſitiōs a very large ſtipēd,Lib. nat. hiſt. 29. cap. 1. of 205. Seſtertia (as Pliny reporteth) whē as they payed vnto ye profeſſors of other arts but only an hūdreth: albeit in ye times following they were againe by a law made, baniſhed ye city. Which was enacted by reaſon of the boldnes of certayne vnſkilful perſons, who did abuſe phiſick. For couetous mē ſet on fire and blinded with the hope of gaine, are oftē carried headlōg to the aduēturing of any thing, &amp; ſomtimes refrein not frō yt which is horrible to tel. Who neyther mindful of the oth of Hippocrates, nor of the honour or ſafetie of themſelues or others, range vp &amp; downe like robbers where they bee freelye without puniſhment.

But we who being enlighted with the light of the Goſpell, ought to eſteeme of euerye thing not by the abuſe but by the lawful vſe, doe in ſuch ſort vſe it, that we acknowledge it to be giuen not by the counſel of man, but by the benefite of God, for the prolonging of life, ſo farre as concerneth outwarde helpes and aydes. The iudgement of Luther in a little Dutch booke of the plague, ſet foorth at Wittenberge in the yeere 1527. is moſt graue and godlie, and a doctrine fitte for this our buſineſſe in hand: God (ſaith hee) hath created phiſicke,
                  Luther. 
                  and giuen the minde, that euery man ſhoulde haue care of his owne bodie, be in health and liue. Who ſoeuer will not vſe theſe, whē as without the hurt of his neighbour, hee may, the ſame betrayeth his owne life, and there lacketh little but that before God hee is made a murtherer. For by the ſame reaſon hee may deſpice meate and drinke, rayment and houſing, and truſting too much vnto his faith, ſay, if God will, hee can preſerue me without al theſe things. Then the which follie this is yet greater, that he which after this ſorte caſteth the care of his bodie, and not ſeeke that remedie againſt the plague, which he may,

may hurt and infect others alſo through this his negligence, who peraduenture, if hee had ſuffered himſelfe to haue beene looked vnto, had remained vnhurt and aliue. Whereof it commeth to paſſe that hee getteth vnto himſelfe the blame of an other man his death, &amp; committeth murder vnto God. Suche men doe in deede no otherwiſe, then as if a man in a common fyring▪ woulde not come and helpe the Citie, but let the fire alone, that the whole Citie might bee burned: namely, vppon this truſt. Doubtleſſe if God will, hee can without water quenche the fire. But friende, thou oughteſt in no caſe ſo to deale, nay it is ſhamefull and vnlawfull, whiche thou perſwadeſt thy ſelfe: but rather vſe remedies and medicines, and doe whatſoeuer any way may helpe, perfume thine houſe, Orchard, and ſtreete, flie the infected places, and men infected, whereas thy ſeruice is not required, and ſo behaue thy ſelfe as one willing to quenche, and not maintaine the publike flame, &amp;c. For the woordes whiche followe, albeit they bee ſpoken very finely, yet at this time I purpoſedly paſſe

them ouer.
               Away therefore with this more then barbarous opinion, and Cyclopical or Giant-like ſtubborneſſe, whereby many call and defame Phiſicke, as ſuperfluous, or an Arte only to picke mens purſes, as they doe all other liberall ſciences, yea and philoſophie it ſelfe as a certaine ſophiſtrie, whiche thing Plato alſo himſelfe doth, for fault not of the thinges,In Gorgia. but of thoſe perſons that profeſſe it.
               
                  Obiection.But if any man ſhall ſay: if the vſe of your Phiſicke bee ſo neceſſarie, and diuine, as you affirme, wherefore then doth Syrach himſelfe,38 whome you haue cited in the place by you alleadged, bydde the ſicke goe vnto God, and to deſire health by prayer? Why doth Saint Ignatius a moſt godly biſhop and martyr call,Epiſt. ad Epheſ. Theodor. dialog. 1.
                   onely Chriſte the bodily &amp; ſpirituall Phiſition, and in death alſo (I ſay not in ſickneſſe) the true life? But I will alſo my ſelfe giue the aduerſaries a weapon which with mee is of no ſmall force▪ when as I departed out of Italie, Sebaſtianus Laudus a ſinguler man, the Reader of Phiſicke at Padway, and my maſter (whom for honour ſake I name) for a perpetuall remembrance of his faithfulneſſe towards me,

wrote with his owne hand in my booke: Remember that only God doth cure diſeaſes. If then only God, what neede is there of others? Doth God want ſeruants for to help him? If Chriſt be the only Phiſition, whiche taketh away our griefes, as the Prophet is witnes, and as he himſelfe hath teſtified by ſo many exeamples in the new Teſtament, whom ſhal we need beſides? For ſurely that is done in vaine by more, which may be done by the fewer. And of this iudgement ther are alſo many found among the Chriſtians, not vnlike vnto the old heretikes called Euchitae. But I anſwere, that albeit God needeth not the helpe of any, but rather is the only Phiſition, aſwel of the bodie as ſoule,Anſwere. Eſai. 38. 4. Reg. 20. Tob. 6.11. 3. Reg. 4. 8. Ioſeph. 2. and yt we do confeſſe al health to depend on him, &amp; to be to be craued at his hand: yet nothing letteth, but that the Lord and maſter may cō
                  mit many things vnto his ſeruants, &amp; do by their hands, what he wil: like as euery work man vſeth tooles, vnto whom notwithſtanding the praiſe of the worke done, properly is neither due, nor aſcribed. And I ſaide before ye God will be aſked of vs, and without meanes manie tymes will giue nothing vnto vs, yt which meanes he hath made for this end, that we ſhould vſe them vnto our profit,

like as Chriſte himſelfe, and holy men of God, when as they could obteine them (for otherwiſe the grace and power of God is not tyed vnto them) vſed them, and were wont to vſe them. Wherefore when as theſe ſay that God only cureth diſeaſes, it is to be referred vnto the chiefe cauſe, which is God, not vnto the inſtrumental cauſe, as are men. And Syrach, when as in the beginning hee had commended the inſtrumentes themſelues, and meanes, as it were diuine and healthfull meanes, leaſt happily any man truſting vnto theſe, ſhoulde cleaue vnto them as the principall and chiefe cauſes, and ſhoulde forget God, in the end of the Chapter, as it were in the vſe of theſe things, hee doeth admoniſhe vs, that wee haue GOD before our eyes in our whole worke, that wee plye him with praier, and requeſt proſperous ſucceſſe at his hande. As if hee ſhoulde ſay, Phiſicke in deede is a diuine and excellent thing, but without the power and grace of God (which power is obteined by onely prayer) it bringeth foorth no happie ſucceſſe. Whiche was no doubt the meaning alſo of Herophilus,
                  Herophilus. albeit a prophane, and Heathen Phiſition, when as hee ſaith, That Phiſick

is both nothing, and againe, that it is the hande of God: nothing (I ſay) as I vnderſtande it, of it ſelfe: and the hande of God, ioyned with the grace and power of God, and vſed in ſeaſon and rightly. Then the which in mine opinion nothing can bee ſpoken more truely and Chriſtianly. And the ſelfe ſame may wee ſay, if it bee lawfull to compare great thinges with ſmall,The ſacramēts and medicines are meanes. of thoſe meanes whiche are ſet foorth vnto vs vnto the health of the ſoule by Chriſte, as theſe are for the halth of the body. Although ſome which thinke they can cunninglye blinde the eyes of wiſe men, or ſteale fire from Iupiter out of heauē, are wont greatly and wickedly to extenuate or leſſen the dignitie of theſe alſo,Theod. 2. Fabul. haeret. when as with much a doe they can alleadge nothing but the abuſe and faultes of the receiuers, and doe only bewray the ſtinck of the Aſtrodutiorian and Meſſalian heretikes.
               But leaſt any man might thinke that I ſerue mine owne turne, whileſt hee heareth mee ſo diligently pleading for Phiſick, I will not purſue any further the commendation of a thing ſufficiently prayſed of it ſelfe, but will ioyne yet one article more vnto this preſent Chapter,Queſtion. very neceſſarie

in my iudgement in this cauſe. For a man may aſke a queſtion, becauſe that ſo earneſtly &amp; diligently I perſwade all companying wt the infected with ye Plague to be to be auoided, how I thinke thoſe poore women to be to be dealt wtal, who in theſe infected houſes, either in health or ſicknes fal in trauaile, (which thing to haue happened vnto many, &amp; the which for the moſt part haue dyed, I my ſelfe can be a liue witneſſe) Ought they to bee forſaken of the neighbours? What like vncurteſie in the memorie of man, hath there beene harde of? Here is need of a dubble anſwere.A duble anſwere. Firſt if any women mooued not with raſhneſſe, but Chriſtian charitie and loue (the which aſſuredly wee owe one to an  other) will come, let this be done in ſuch order,Eccle. 3.7.4. Rom. 12.13. that afterwards they come not without diſcretion by and by vnto their houſhold, vnleſſe hauing changed their apparrel, and for a certaine time they abſtaine from the companie of others. Secondly, that which more  appertaineth to our publike purpoſe, I will haue our preſeruers in this caſe alſo to keep a certaine order, that they get midwiues and other good honeſt women, eſpecially the wiues of the miniſters of the Church, of the Chirurgeons, Apothecaries, Phiſitions, &amp;

thoſe whom wee appoint to carrie foorth &amp; burie the dead, if there ſhall bee any fit, and will doe the ſame, for the executing of this charge. There they ſhall in no caſe lacke the helpe of womā kind, albeit they haue not alwayes at hand thoſe which they are wont to haue in time of health, after the example of thoſe, which by reaſon of the Leprie are ſeperated from the company of men. Let them therefore require no more of others, then they would haue others require of thē in this caſe. For ſo doth charitie bid, not to ſeeke the things which are her owne, if it cā
                  not be done without the hurt and danger of our neighbour.
            
            
               Of building of certaine publike houſes, called Plague houſes. Chap. 2.
               
                  I Promiſed in ye chapter afore going, yt I would ſet downe a way, whereby ſuch as had rather goe out of the infected houſes, or the ſick yt are deſirous to chāge ye ayre, may be profitably prouided for. The which, yt it may fitly &amp; wiſely be done, our Preſeruers muſt

goe about a worke ſomething greater and more chargeable. For I will yt two houſes large enough, &amp; in euery point fit for that purpoſe, which ſhalbe called, Plague houſes, be built of matter cōueniēt, in a place &amp; ayre, good, both for thē that ſhall vſe ye ſame, and alſo for the Citie: in ſuch ſort notwithſtanding yt not ſo much gorgeouſneſſe as cō
                  modiouſnes be ſought, &amp; that the charges be reaſonable, &amp; the vſe neceſſarie: of the which ſeuerally we muſt briefly intreate.
               And firſt of all concerning the matter, the ſame muſt not be clay,The matter of the Plague houſes. lome, turfs, or ſtraw, but wood, ſtone, lime, becauſe that putrifiyng doth more eaſily happen, and the infection hang more longer in them, then in theſe.
               Secondly, touching the place and ſituation,The place. whereunto the ayre is alſo annexed or knit, this is to be obſerued, that it be either in ſome out corner of the citie, or (yt which I had rather) without the Citie: not low, but open vnto the Sun, &amp; high, &amp; by a riuer ſide, if it may be. For the farneſſe frō others will further the let of infection: the highth will yeelde a more holſome ayre, and make the Sunne, which refreſheth all things, to haue more paſſage vnto it: the riuer ſhall receiue al ye filth &amp; excremēts, which in ſuch houſes

is woont in great aboundance to be heaped together. Hitherto alſo pertaine large orchardes within the precinctes and compaſſe of the ſame: alſo greene walking places, gardens, in which are wholſome trees, pleaſaunt graſſe, ſweete hearbs, flowers giuing forth pleaſaunt ſauours farre and wide, and finally there muſt be ſpringing waters.
               Nowe the manner and forme of buylding is after ſuch ſorte to be thought vppon and deuiſed, as the commodity and neceſſity,The forme. and not gorgeouſneſſe doth require, as I haue ſayde before. That largeneſſe therefore muſt be kept, which is agreeable vnto the Cittie not in Geometrical, but Arithmeticall proportion. Let the highth be twiſe as great as the breadth. Let the Chambers alſo within be of a reaſonable largenes, furniſhed with Chimneies, ſuch as the wynde may blowe through, not darke nor cloſe, the windowes, as alſo the whole building, opening rather to the North, and Eeaſt, then vnto the South or North: there muſt alſo be Bathes there, of the which in this our cauſe there is great vſe. And this whole manner of buildinge appertaineth vnto manye thinges, and plainely ſheweth, howe great their errour is, which doe ſo buyld the common

Hoſpitalles, that the winde cannot pearſe into them, then the which, eſpecially in this diſeaſe,Of common Hoſpitals. nothing canne bee thought and deuiſed more hurtefull. Neyther is it any meruayle, if oftentymes the poore ſoule that is brought hither, dye ſo muche the ſooner. For albeit hee be not ſicke of this diſeaſe, but of anye other lyghter ſickeneſſe, or alſo of a ſimple feuer: yet beeing receyued in that impure ayre, layde vppon foule and ſtincking beddes, he ſhall ſeeme to bee choaked, and to dye violently. I wil not now ſpeake, howe indiſcretlye they whiche are ſicke in theſe houſes, are oftentimes prouided for of meate and drinke, and other neceſſaryes. Of which neglygence they one daye ſhall giue an accounte vnto GOD, who beeing rulars in theſe offyces, deale ſo vnfaythfullye, when as they are no ſmall cauſe of the death of the myſerable ſicke perſons. Diligence therefore muſt bee vſed, that all ſuch houſes, if it maye bee, bee buylded by ſome Brooke, and in a place (as hath beene ſayde) open vnto the winde and ayre, that they may bee thorowe blowen, and thinges defiled maye bee often waſhed and cleanſed. For the impure ayre

maye verye much hurte euen them that are whole, the which dayly experience ſheweth. Alſo I ſayde, that they are to bee buylded in an high place, with manye windowes, eſpecially towardes the North, from whēce the ayre is more healthy. That ye windows alſo ought often to bee opened, I neede not tell, for the thing it ſelfe dooth teache it. All which thinges, if they bee not diligentlye obſerued, they will bringe more hurte then profit, and they were better to bee burned (I ſpeake of manye common Hoſpitalles) in ſuch a tyme of the Plague, then with hurte to bee ſuffered, as it is the counſayle not onely of Phyſitions, but alſo of Phyloſophers, and wiſe menne in Common wealthes. Marcus Varo being ſometymes at Corcyra,
                  Varo. and ſeeinge folke lye ſicke commonlye in euery houſe, bringing in the North winde at newe windowes, and ſhutting vppe the South windowes, and altering the gate of the houſe, is reported to haue preſerued his companions and al his family in health.
               So Tholoſa a citie of Aquitania,
                  Tholoſa. famous in reſpect of the Byſhopprick, vniuerſitie, &amp; high court, when as cōmonly it was wont to be viſited with a continuall plague, becauſe

that the houſes in the toppes or vpper parts towardes the high ſtreates beeing buylded with certaine appentices (vnder which men goe ſafe from the rayne) did hinder the blowing through of the winde,Leui. Lem. 3 de occul. nat. mirac. 3.
                   it was by the kinges proclamation commaunded vnto al the inhabitauntes, not onely to take awaye thoſe appentices, but that they ſhoulde forecut and drawe in from the verye bottome euen vnto the toppe, ſuch houſes, as ſeemed too much to narrow the publik way. With woondefull paine taking and ſpeedie worke euery man plyeth his buſines, a man would haue ſayde, that they meant to pull downe and build vp a new the whole Cittie. But what was brought to paſſe? I will tell you that, which I may ſaye truelye: for I was an eye witneſſe, the windes hauing ſomwhat a more free entrance, it made a notable drawing vp and blowing abroad of the vapors, and the plague did not ſo often haunte the Cittie, as it was woont to doe, and did alſo leſſe harme. A rare example of wiſdome, the which albeit it were not doone without great charges, yet if the caſe ſhoulde ſo require, it is woorthy the following, eſpecyally in our plague houſes, in whoſe ſetting vp it may more eaſily be taken heede of, that

they may bee ſo buylded, that afterwardes they neede not be pulled downe againe. And becauſe I haue once entred to ſpeak of the hurtfulneſe of ye cloſe ayre,Of the hurtfulnes of cloſe aire. I hope I ſhal doe a thing woorth the trauaile, and ſuch as ſhall refreſh the wearineſſe of the Reader, if I ſhall alleadge a certaine few, and the ſame very fearefull and ſtraunge hiſtories,In append ad fin. 9. ca. &amp; lib. 1.
                   concerning this matter.
               In Hieronimus Cardanus in his booke de Variet. rer. it is thus read: The 23. day of Iuly, in the yeere 1556. there happened a woonderfull thing, whereat I my ſelfe was preſent: Iacobus Philippus Cernuſcus a moneth agoe, willeth a priuye to be digged vp out of the earth, and to be ſieled, roofed and vauted. When it was finiſhed, that ye vaut might be made ſure, he commaundeth it to bee ſhut vp. Twentie dayes after he openeth it, hee biddeth the woodden peeces, wherewith they made hollowe the vautes, to be drawne out: one that was hyred goeth downe by a ladder, when he came vnto the middle of the ladder, hee fell downe dead. The maiſter, when as hee ſawe him not to returne, goeth downe him ſelfe, and when he came thither, he

by and by dyed. They that ſtoode by put in the third, who beeing on the middle of the ladder, ſayd: be of good cheere, I will bring vp the other, but when as hee once put his head vnder the vaute, hee ſtraight way fell downe dead. The fourth fell downe dead likewiſe. The fifth, called Matus (which in our tongue is a foole) beeing a verye ſtout fellowe went down, but he put not in his head, &amp; with a hook pulled out one of the dead. Thereupon beeing made ſomewhat bolder, hee came againe, and went downe ſo farre, that hee put vnder his head, and by and by fell downe. When they had pulled him vp, and perceiued that there was yet breath in him, with vſing helpes by little and little they got lyfe of him agayne, and ſenſe, yet hee remained dumbe vntyll the ryſing of the Sunne the next daye. I, when as he begunne to ſpeake, asked him certain queſtions, but he onely remembred, that he went downe: they put in alſo a dogge, and he was drawn out halfe dead. They vncouered the place by the commaundement of the Magiſtrate, at the mouth of the denne they ſee without any hurt, running water. Thus much Card.
                  
And beecauſe no certaine cauſe appeared, there were ſome whiche ſuppoſed, that a Baſiliſke Serpente laye lurking there, which Baſiliſke, after the opinion of the common people, is thought to come of the Egge of a Cock, being hatched by a Toad:The fonde opinion of the generation of a Baſiliſke. the whiche I willinglye with the learned and moſte fine Writer L. Lemnius, the Phiſition of Ziricaeum doe thinke to bee but an olde Wiues tale:
                     L. Lem. 4. de occul. nat. mirac. 12. Dioſc. ca. vlt. &amp; in hunc Mat. ibidem. When as rather the ſtench, poyſoned breathes, filthyneſſe, ſtrong ſmell, and ſtinck, are they, whiche come out of foule and filthye places, take awaye the breath, and ſometymes ſtrangle a man. Although that there is no cauſe why any man ſhould doubt that venemous beaſts, which lye lurking in ſuche holes, doe ſometimes woorke the ſame.
               The like vnto this was ſometimes tolde me by an eye witneſſe, and ſuch a one, as no exception is to be taken againſt: to witte, the moſt honorable &amp; reuerent L.L. Georg, of worthy memorie, Duke of Brunſwike, and Byſhoppe of Bream, &amp;c, of a certaine Fountayn of Peterſhag,
                  A fountaine of Peterſhag. (which is a Caſtle vnder the Byſhop of Mind) breathing out a woonderfull infectious ſauour, whiche when it was ſomtimes ſcoured of

the filth, whatſoeuer lyuing thing was put into it, was by and by choaked, and by death (that I may ſpeake with Pliny) made tryall of the force of this water, and that ſo long vntyll at length caſting in, and ſettinge on fire a veſſel filled with ſhippe pitch, &amp; hearbs and ſweete-flowers, it was ſo cleanſed, that afterwardes there might bee going into it without hurte, and euerye manne might occupy of the ſpringing water therof without harme.
               
                  The lake of Puteol.With theſe ſtories agreeth that of the Lake of Puteol, neere vnto Naples, into the which a Dogge being caſt, dyeth within a little ſpace: if when you haue taken him out againe, you plunge him in the ſtream neereby, he reuiueth. Alſo that which I my ſelfe haue ſeene at Menapis, in the Lordſhip of Burchbrull (whiche is vnder William of Braunſſberge a moſte noble Gentleman,William of Braunſſberg. and excelling as well in all kinde of vertue, as in the prayſe of a moſt auncient and moſt honourable pedigrew) of a certaine Wine cellar newely buylded, caſting vp ſo ſore a ſmell, that it could ſerue for no vſe. But more of this ſorte might be brought, if I did not auoide tediouſneſſe, and being too long. Theſe therefore may ſuffice, concerning the

matter, ſituation, and forme of the buylding: I wil go forward to recite the wealth, number, and vſe of the ſame.
               Fourthly therefore,The riches of the Plague houſes. prouiſion muſt be made for the rich, wherwith our plague houſes are to be furniſhed: which being once appoynted according vnto the eſtate and abilitie of euery Cittie, it is to be hoped, that by little and lyttle, through the lyberalytie of good menne, they will wax greater, and increaſe euerye day. Although in this caſe no other riches are ſought after, then ſuch as are needfull for the maintenaunce of thoſe that neede, and the preſeruation of the buylding. And becauſe the Plague doth not alwayes reigne, therfore there ſhall not neede to be any yearely charges made, but, as I haue ſayde, ſo much as ſhall be requiſite for the reparations: If there be anye ouerplus, that ſhall be layd vp, eyther for the neceſſitie to come, or to be to beſtowed vppon the vſe of the poore.
               Nowe I ſayde at the beeginning,Two Plague houſes. that two ſuch houſes were to be buylded: namelye, the one for ſuch as are yet ſounde and well, but yet by reaſon of the companye at home, which they haue hadde with the ſicke,

are to be ſuſpected and feared: and the other for thoſe which lye ſicke, infected with the plague.
               And as for other poyntes, they may bee like, but they muſt be conuenient waye, the one from the other. For it hath beene marked, that this ſickly infection hath bene increaſed, euē by the incloſures of ye walles, and ſtanding and touchinge of the houſes together. And they muſte in ſuch order bee ſeuered the one from the other, that in receyuing the North wynde, and Sunne beames, the one bee not an hinderaunce vnto the other, nor bee anye let to receiue the free ayre: eſpecially that the South winde out of the houſe of the ſicke with his blaſte, bring no diſeaſe and plaguy vapour or ſtēch into the ground of the whole and ſounde. Therefore alſo it ſhal be more conueniente, at that ſide to haue no windowes at all, or elſe to keepe them ſhut.
               And hereof nowe alſo (that which in the laſt place was ſet downe) appeareth the vſe of theſe houſes.The vſe of the plague houſes. For, when as wee iudge this diſeaſe to bee by all meanes to be auoyded, as a preſent and deadly poyſon, the which vnleſſe it be diligently taken heede of, doth moſt vndoubtedly infect, therefore

the firſt vſe of this new buylding ſhal bee, to receiue thoſe, who are infected as it were with a deadly lepry, that the other citizens may be in ſo much the leſſe daunger. The which of how great weight it is, if any man will beleeue me, who neither haue any cauſe to lye, and am ſory that there are many, who in their bookes doe lie notoriouſly (let it bee lawfull for me to ſpeake ſo with Galen, in a good teſtimonie of my conſcience) I canne ſhewe by many moſt true hiſtories, yt which partely I haue ſeene and liued, and partely haue heard of others worthy credite. For when as being yet a boy, I went to ſchoole in the Citie of Dauentrie, where was then a moſt floriſhing ſchoole, one of the ſchollers was taken with the Plague,A ſcholler of Dauentry. which dwelled in his brothers houſe, ſurnamed Hercules, becauſe of the ſingular ſtrength of his bodye, my bourdfellowe, who, becauſe hee was remooued beetymes into a priuate houſe, vnto the which others had no acceſſe, neuer a one beſides was infected with this diſeaſe, or died. Afterwardes, when being a young man I ſtudyed Philoſophy at Colain in the College of Artes, a certaine gentleman our ſchoolfellow, one amōgſt many,A ſtudent of Colain. whē there was at ye time no plague, died of ye plague:

to witte, becauſe his diſeaſe being knowne, he was by and by caried vnto a peculiar and an appoynted place for this purpoſe. Three yeares after, when I dwelled at Paris in the Colledge of Monachus, I ſawe among two thouſand boyes only one cooke viſited with this ſickneſſe, and by and by carried aſide vnto a little cottage, which was builded in a large Orcharde for this purpoſe, to die there,A Cooke of Paris. the reſt of the company remayning altogether ſafe and ſound. At the length in the Cities of Venice and Padway
                  ▪ yt which it delighteth me often to remember, when as there I haunted the Phiſicke Schooles, I ſawe ſomewhat hotte beginninges of the plague, the which notwithſtanding by this wiſdome, and putting a part into ſuch houſes (for they haue them alwayes in a readineſſe) and by ſeuering the hole and the ſick, beſides other kinds of pollicie, and paine taking, in a very ſhort time for the moſte part were appeaſed So true is the common prouerb, He that will flye ſmok, muſt flie the fier.
               
               The ſecond ende ſhall ſtand them more in ſteede, whom the danger in deede is nigh, but which yet are not infected with the ſame. For when as the houſes of many are verye

vncommodious, and more apt to nouriſh the corruption, then to remedy the ſame: alſo when as the men that dwell in them, are often poore, or ſeruile perſons, or weake of nature, which do tremble at the verye name of ſuch a ſore diſeaſe, whereupon alſo they are in the more daunger, I would ſo haue them carried out of their infected houſes, that they ſhould forthwith be brought in ye plague houſe, and there in euery point after the ſame maner to be handled, after which I ſaid, they were to be handled before, whē as they were ſhut vp in their own houſes, ſauing that here they may haue free ayre, and libertie to goe abroad, if they will walke forth, for the recreating of their minde ſake. But how many daies are requiſite for the cleanſing of thoſe, which are ſo carryed forth, that they maye freelye returne againe into the Cittie and company of men, becauſe that the ſame time neither ought nor can with ſafetie inough be preſcribed and appoynted vnto al, this iudgment muſt be left vnto the Phiſitions, as it were vnto the Prieſts for this cruell leprie. To which purpoſe ſo ſpeaketh Luther in his book of the Plague,Luther. handling the ſame matter, which we now haue in hand: If GOD (ſaieth he) in the olde Teſtament willed

thoſe to be ſeuered, and put apart without the Citie, which were defiled with the lepry, to auoide the infection, howe much more iuſtly may we doe the ſame in this daungerous ſickneſſe, that forth with, ſo ſoone as one is infected therewithall, hee either of his owne accorde remoue himſelfe, or cauſe him to be remooued, that the infection may in time bequenched, not of that ſick perſon onlye, but of the whole ſocietie and all the Cittie, the whiche, if the infected haue free leaue to goe out vnto others, may by this meanes be infected. For ſuch is at this tyme our plague of Witeberge (hee ſpeaketh of the yeere, 1527.) namely, that it maye ſeeme as begunne onely by infection, ſo alſo gon thus farre as it is. For the ayre (thanks be to God) is hitherto pure and healthye, and of meere raſhneſſe and negligence ſome, and the ſame in deede verye few, haue ben infected: albeit ſathā with vnwoonted feare doe trouble vs, and make vs cowardharted. For with ſundry craftes the enemie doth ſport and playe in the hearts of men, and dooth them ſtrike with feare moſt vaine.
               
               
                  Therfore this counſayle of ſo moſt wiſe a man is not lightly to bee regarded, but diligently to bee followed as I thinke, ſo longe as conuenientlye wee maye, to witte, when as the diſeaſe is yet in the beeginning, and hath not infected manye,Eccle. 18. Perſ. ſat. 3. nor aſſaulted the common wealth in many places: whereunto this our counſayle chieflye tendeth, that it maye rather be a forebewaring of this diſeaſe, then an experyence of the ſame. For when the griefe through long delay hath gottē ſtrēgth, there can ſcarſe anye thing bee doone certainely and wiſelye, but wee goe at all aduenture, and manye thinges are to bee ſuffered: lyke as the Mayſter of the ſhip ſeeketh out manye thinges at hab nab (as they ſaye) when as cutting now the ſeas, hee is doubtefull of the daungers and alſo of his lyfe. Not that I woulde haue men at anye time goe from the right rule of reaſon, albeit the ſucceſſe aunſwere not according vnto reaſon,2. Aph. 52. which ſhould flatlye be againſt the counſayle of the reuerent olde man Hyppocrates, our Phiſition. But it commeth to paſſe, it cōmeth (I ſay) to paſſe, that

as in the heate of battaile, and amongſt weapon (as is woont to be ſayd) lawes are ſilent or mum, ſo alſo in this ſtreightnes &amp; ſorowfull plight of thinges a ſmal regarde is had, either of the beſt or righteſt order. For as there one while the ſtander bearer, one while the defender of the ſame, ſometime the ſouldiours of the rereward, or Sergeaunt of the band, and ſometimee alſo the generall of the army, by whoſe appoyntment all thinges vſe to be well gouerned, are on the ſuddaine taken away: euen ſo it fareth here, where no leſſe ſlaughter, nay ſome tymes alſo a greater happeneth, not onely the common Citizens, but alſo ſometimes thoſe, in whoſe hand lieth the authority of ordering this pollicy, which we deſcribe and ſet out, are vnlooked for pulled away, and together with the ruler of the ſterne, is the ſterne loſt alſo. The which caſe to preuent and meete withal in time, this our order and platforme ſuch as it is, was taken in hand and ſet forth for.
            
            
               
               Whether it bee lawfull for Chriſtians in the time of the Plague to flie, and to leaue their Citie with a ſafe conſcience. Cap. 3.
               
                  NOw albeit I may ſeeme alreadie to haue ſpoken muche in this matter of the ſeuering of the infected: yet becauſe of the affinitie or kinred of the cauſe, and diuerſity of opinions, I will ioyne hereunto a very commō queſtion, diſputed not only by the Diuines, but alſo by the learned and Chriſtian Phiſitions: namely,A queſtion. whether in the time of the Plague it bee lawfull for a man for a ſeaſon to forſake his Citie, and to flie with a good conſcience. Of the which matter becauſe there are ſundrie opinions, I will briefly &amp; plainely rehearſe the reaſons on both ſides, and in the ende alſo will ſet down my iudgement, which ſhalbe a meane betweene both, &amp; gathered out of the foūdations &amp; grounds of the parties at variance.
               
                  
                  That it is lawfull to flie.The former therefore ſay, that wee reade not of any of the Saints &amp; holy men, which feared not death, and therefore that they feared 
                     reaſon 1 ſickneſſe alſo, chiefly ſo deadly a ſicknes, and that if they coulde they would haue fled 
                     reaſon 2 by all likelihood. Nay that it is vſuall vnto vs by natures lawe, &amp; not learned by the teaching of men, to feare death. For ye Apoſtle ſaith,Ephe. 4. That no man euer hated his own fleſh, but rather to nouriſh, cheriſh, &amp; by all means to maintaine and preſerue the ſame. Abraham (ſay they) for feare of death,Gen. 20. called his wife Sara by the name of ſiſter, and had rather to make a lie, thē to come in dāger of his life. Iacob fled into Meſopotamia, that he might not fall into the handes of his brother Eſau. The ſame doth Dauid whileſt he flyeth from king Saul,
                  
                     Pſal. 3. and his own ſonne Abſolom. Elias otherwiſe a moſt bold man, and who with his owne hande had ſlaine the Prophetes of Baal but a little before, yet feared with the threatnings of Ieſabel the Queene, conueighed himſelfe a ſide into the wildernes. Moſes when as he was ſought after by the king of the Aegyptians, fled into Midia. Therefore (ſay they) it is not onely lawful to flie death, but other alſo the whips of God beeing angrie, as hunger, tyraunts,

burnings, ouerflowinges of waters, colde,Ruth. 1. Leuit. 26. Ezech. 5.4. Hierom. 14. Deut. 28. heate, captiuitie, wilde beaſtes: to be ſhorte, all kindes of diſeaſes, agues, diſenteries, vncleanneſſe, the Leprie, the french pockes. &amp;c. Which things ſithence they are ſo, it ſhall be muche more lawfull to flie the plague and 
                     reaſon 3 death. Furthermore, all men are not indued with equal ſtrength either of body or minde, they ſay therefore that it were not iuſt to require the ſame thinges at the hands of all. Strong faith drinketh poiſon without hurt, wherewith a ſucking or young faith woulde die. Peter beeing bold, and hauing truſt, walked 
                     reaſon 4 in the Sea without harme, the ſame a little after doubting, began to bee drowned.Mark. 16. And Chriſte will not haue the weake to bee deſpiſed. Moreouer, it is euident by the doctrine of all Phiſitions, that ſuch is the nature of infection, that going from one ſubiect and body into another, that is next and fitteſt to receiue it by due and conuenient diſtance, it doth infect and corrupt the ſame: for two thinges are required, that there may bee an impreſſion, or printing and marking:Gal. ad Pyſon de Theriae. namely, aptneſſe of the ſubiect and neereneſſe. Therefore when as it is manifeſt by their owne iudgement, and alſo daily experience, that the plague is a moſt infectious diſeaſe,

as which is wont to bee taken by the drawing in of the corrupted and poyſoned ayre, they in deede giue counſaile, that it be ſhunned, ſo much as may bee, and amongeſt all kinde of counſailes▪ they confeſſe that none is better, then is ſpeedy flying away, long tarrying foorth,Leonarth. Fuch. 4. de med. morb. and ſlowe returning again. For there is no way more commodious to auoide the infected ayre, none more ſafe, when as the ayre muſt alwayes bee drawen yea euen againſt our willes, and it is drawē, ſuch as it is. And they ſay that the ſame remedie is with ſo much the more ſpeede to be vſed, by howe muche the euill is more hurtfull and preſent. That we ought to flie the further, to the end a more healthie ayre may be found. Finally that wee muſt returne the more ſlowly, that wee may bee the more ſure of the cleanſing of the corrupted ayre. Heereupon they think in time of the plague theſe three aduerbes, (quickly, farre, ſlowly) to bring more ayd &amp; ſafe remedie, then 3. of the beſte furniſhed Apothecaries ſhops. For the plague (as Galē
                   vnto Piſo is autor) with an airie bodie is as it were a certaine dragon, &amp; no commō dragon, but ſuch a one who when as he is not ſeene with the eyes, doth priuily and by ſtealth, lying as it were

in ambuſhment, euery where breath out his poyſon vpon men, and no common poyſon, but ſuche as increaſing moſte ſpeedily, may in a very ſhort time deuour the whole body of the common wealth.Marſ. Ficin. de epid. cap. 6. For the yll qualitie of the ayre (ſaith Galen) is made a readie change vnto corruption: and when as men through the neceſſitie of breathing cannot auoid danger, they doe by the mouth drawe vnto them the ayre it ſelfe▪ as a certain poyſon. Wherefore the ſame Galen calleth and praiſeth Hypocrates, as a man many wayes wonderfull, for that no otherwiſe then by the changing of the ayre, hee cured that Plague which out of Aethyopia had aſſaulted the Greekes. For when as he had commaunded a fire to bee made throughout the whole Citie of Athens, hee caſt into it not only a bare heape of wood, but flowers &amp; garlands of moſt ſweet ſauour, alſo moſt fat ſmelling ointments, that the men might draw in vnto themſelues the ayre thus purged as an ayd and helpe for them. Laſtly (ſay 
                     reaſon 5 they) doe wee not with great admiration and wonder ſee, ſometimes a great familie to dye one after another, out of the whiche if any by the counſaile of the Phiſitions, flie in time, they remaine alwayes for the

moſt part in ſafetie? How fewe alſo of thoſe die, which depart out of infected Cities, we our ſelues daylie ſee: ſo that in this caſe they 
                     reaſon 6 thinke that ſaying of Demoſthenes to haue place, the man that runneth away, will fight againe, Now if it be vnlawful and ſin to ſhunne ſuch places, or by going aſide to leaue thē, then to liue alſo, the which notwithſtanding is a ſinguler gift of God, after a ſort ſhalbe ſinne. But God will haue vs ſo long to haue care of our life, which hee hath giuen vs, vntill he take it away, which gaue it vnto vs. For we are in this world as it were his ſouldiers, and for the moſt part ſet in the fore front of the battaile, from whence we muſt then only retire, when as it ſhall pleaſe him for to call vs. And hee that either of negligence or raſhneſſe forſaketh his ſtanding, ſhalbe counted giltie of treaſon. And theſe for the moſt part are the reaſons of thē that holde it lawfull, as to flie death, ſo alſo according to our power to flie ſickeneſſe.
               On the other ſide the other with no leſſe earneſtneſſe affirme the contrary. For when as diſeaſes (ſay they) eſpecially vniuerſall diſeaſes,That it is not lawfull to flie. are the puniſhment of God for our 
                     reaſon 1 ſinnes, wee ought not to flie the anger of

our Father, but rather to appeare before him, and patiently to waite for ſtripes,Wol. Muſc. in explan. pſal. 86.91. like vnto boyes, that haue plaied ſome vnhappie tricke. For they ſay that the examples alleadged by the aduerſarie part, make mention, not of the plague, but of death, yea and of ſuch a death as by the perſecution of men is laid vpon vs (betweene which two things there is great difference &amp; oddes.) For that wee may eſcape the handes of men, but not of God. And that men oftentimes haue vniuſt cauſes of perſecuting, as tyrannie, deſire to reigne, reuenge, couetouſneſſe, ambition, enuie, anger, hatred, reproche, quarrellyng, letcherie, inceſt, ſtealing away or deſiring of another man his wife, which thinges are wont to ſtirre vp men to perſecute others: but that God doth puniſhe no man ſaue onely lawfully. Heereunto is added, that the puniſhment of men is not alwayes taken in hande for amendement, but often for reuenge of ſome lewde act: For the magiſtrate (ſaith the Apoſtle) beareth not the ſworde in vaine, but is a terrour and feare vnto the wicked, and ſuche for the moſte parte were the puniſhments of the olde Teſtament: But God who is made a father vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſte his

ſonne,Prou. 2. Heb. 12. Ephe. 4. doth not puniſh vs for reuenge, but for amendement. For whom he loueth, the ſame hee chaſtiſeth. Hee is alſo faithfull, &amp; ſuffereth vs not to bee tempted aboue our ſtrength: But tempteth to make it knowene,Aug. ſermo. 24. de tent. Deut. 33. Iacob. 1. 1. Pet. 4. Pſalm 17.
                   whether we loue him or no. And him that abideth this tentation, the ſame doth Saint Iames pronounce happie, becauſe when hee ſhall haue beene tryed (ſaith hee) hee ſhall receiue the crown of lyfe, which the Lorde hath promiſed vnto them that loue him. Hereupon ſaith S. Peter, Well beloued, maruaile yee not, when as you are tryed by fyre, for this thing is doone for your tryall. And Dauid calleth God, the Sauiour of ſuche as truſt in him: for there is a promiſe of his, in which it is ſaide: Call vppon mee in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliuer thee.
                  
                     Pſal. 50. Theſe thinges cannot bee ſaide of men which perſecute vs: like as neither can that, whereas the booke of wiſdome calleth God the louer of the ſoule: becauſe when as wee call for his helpe, hee cannot forget his office and minde towardes vs: as hee who hath taken vpon him the name of Father, as a moſt notable token of his good will towardes his creature, and giuen it peculiarly

vnto himſelfe, and doth yet dayly and bountifully by infinite benefites ſhewe his goodneſſe powred out vpon vs, and by his prophet Ezechiel crieth out: I will not the death of a ſinner, but that he be conuerted and liue. Againe by Eſayas, I the Lorde thy God teach thee onely profitable things. Agayne, by the Apoſtle Paule, that hee will haue all mē to be ſaued. And can theſe things I pray you (ſay they) be ſpoken likewiſe of angry tyrants, and thoſe that reuenge themſelues on vs, ſuch as are the examples alleaged by the aduerſaries? Wherefore who woulde diſtruſt God ſo bounteous a father, and driuen as it were by deſpaire, flie his chaſtizement taken in hande for our greate profite. They ſay further, eſpecially ſuch as are fulleſt of tongue among them, that it is 
                     reaſon 2 no ſmall token, that God is diſpleaſed with their running away, who by going aſide in ſuch ſort goe about to ſeeke health for themſelues, when as oftentimes they neuertheles die in another corrupted ayer euen of this ſickneſſe, whereof wee ſpeake, or els of ſome other griefe, and by flying, indeede doe not flie. As concerning the counſel of Phiſitions, that they are not vnto Chriſtians of 
                     reaſon 3 ſuch weight, that therefore they ought not to

regarde the authorities alleadged out of the worde of God and holy Scriptures: for that Phiſitions ſeeke the health of the bodies, not the health of the ſoules: of which duty being mindful, they leaue vnto euery man the care 
                     reaſon 4 of his owne ſoule. Laſt of all, this ſide preacheth much of the band of charitie,The band of charity. wherwith we are bound one vnto an other: and eſpecicially of ye charity of thoſe which liue in one citie, or yt which is more, in one church, &amp; being ſworne together in one ſpirituall league &amp; othe, are ioyned together as it were into one loafe and bodie. For what a monſter or ſtraunge thing (ſaye they) were this, if ſome one member of our bodie haue caught ſome harme, or ſhal peraduenture catch hurt, ſhall it therefore be forſaken of the reſt of the body? or ſhal it not rather by all meanes bee holpen? Or if ſome one part of the citie burn with fire, ſhall it not therefore be ſuccoured, but ſhall the towne becauſe of the danger be fled from and be forſaken? If a man fal into the hands of theeues, and being wounded of them be left halfe aliue, ſhal it beſeeme vs after the example of the Leuite and Phariſie to paſſe by him, &amp; not rather with ye Samaritane to come downe from our horſe, that is to ſay, to come down from our owne commodity,

to repayre ye hurt of our neighbor, &amp; curteouſly according vnto our power to help &amp; vſe him? That verilie ſhoulde bee to Heathenlike, and beaſtly. S. Iohn ſaith: Whoſoeuer loueth not his brother, is a man ſlayer: and how doth he loue him whō being left in great diſtreſſe by flying away he forſaketh?Eccle. 1. Pſalm. 40.
                   Is it not caſt in the teeth of Sodome among her other ſinnes, that they forſooke and cared not for their neighbours? And to ſpeake at a word, what (I pray you ſay they) ſhalbee the principall article of God his laſt accuſation, and condemnation agaynſt vs, ſauing for that wee did not in time helpe thoſe whiche ſtoode in neede of our helpe, did not doe them good, did not ayde them with our counſaile, goodes, and trauel?
                     Pſal. 41. Mat. 25. He meaneth that by the fruites of a true fayth we muſt ſhew our ſelues to perteine vnto the kingdom of heauen bought for vs by Chriſt. For (ſaye they) we muſt after a certayne ſort buy heauen, whileſt we liue on earth, if wee wil euer enioye the poſſeſſion thereof: we muſt buy (I ſay) not for ſo much money as it is worth, but by a ſingular good will and loue towards GOD and our neighbour, through the onelye liberalitie of the Lorde God, and the ſtepping in of the Suretiſhippe of Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne by his owne blood, who vndertooke for vs, and bound himſelfe vnto his father.
               
                  To conclude, they which mainteine this opinion (I ſpeake of ſome, not of all, for manie of them haue more wit) will haue vs ſo farre foorth boldely to contemne and deſpiſe all both ſickneſſe and death, that they wil ſcarſe graunt any vſe of phiſick vnto men, but contend that all things are to be committed vnto God alone: following the Euchite heretiks, of whom I haue ſpoken before, who iudged al thinges both troubleſome and proſperous to be to be kept away, or obteined by onelye prayer, contemning and deſpicing all other meanes.
               We therefore, as we haue promiſed, will now ſet in betweene theſe two partes our iudgement, the which if any man ſhal happily diſlike, wee willingly giue him leaue to appeale whither ſoeuer he wil. Firſt therefore my meaning is not by any meanes to vndermine charitie and the loue of our neighbour, the which no doubt ought to be more deare vnto vs then our own blood,Rom. 5. 1. Cor. 12.
                   like as the ſonne of God himſelf, whom wee beleeue to bee ſet foorth vnto vs by the father, not only for an attonment and ranſom, but alſo for an example to follow, gaue his life for vs. Further, in the former parte I wiſhe this, that they would more diligently conſider and weigh,

what it is to bee bounde vnto ſome certayne companie, either by the common law of Citizens, or by publike duety. For albeit peraduenture that we owe more vnto our wiues, childrē, &amp; kinſfolk, then vnto others: yet that cannot bee vnderſtood, when as the queſtion is of the helping of the common neceſſitie of the whole weale publike, whereof thou art made a member and part to doe ſeruice vnto the vniuerſal body, and the which alſo is farr aboue all both affinities and kinreds. For, for this calling ſake, the which is no doubt of god, euery mā is bound to folow ye other. He that forſaketh not father and mother for my ſake, is not worthy of me. Therfore ye former law is corrected by the latter, &amp; conſtreyned to giue place vnto it: and he that before was bound vnto his parents, ſo that hee is compelled to obey them, he afterwards by a more general lawe ought to leaue Father and mother, and to follow God, calling him another way, that is, that he either cleaue vnto his wife, or that which is of more weight, vnto the whole commō wealth, or congregation of the Church. Yet let no mā vnderſtand this ſo, as if in the ſame degree wee did not owe more vnto our houſhold thē vnto others, but I ſpeake of diuers kinds &amp; conditions of

dueties. In the latter opinion I find want in this point, that they doe not plainely enough iudge a cauſe of ſo great weight. For albeit it be a certain Stoical hardnes &amp; clubbiſhnes, wt ſuch ſtedfaſtnes to tarry for &amp; abide ſo great an euil &amp; preſēt danger: yet al mē ſimply neither can nor ought to be boūd vnto one law. For by what meanes otherwiſe, can ſo many holy fathers be iuſtly excuſed, which are read ſomtimes to haue ſhūned ſuch dāgers, I cannot ſee. My meaning is, neither to haue the one too fainthearted, &amp; as it were diſtruſtfull, nor the other too hardy or raſh: but there is a meane to be choſen of thē both, in the whiche we are wōt to go in moſt ſafety, &amp; wherin al vertue doth cōſiſt, &amp; ye cōmon people vſeth to ſay very truly. which things being diligētly cōſidered,What is to bee done in a plague or ſicknes immediatly ſent by God▪
                   thus I ſay: if at any time it may be gathered by certain tokēs, yt the plague or any other kind of general ſicknes, hath growē through no groſſe negligence &amp; ſluggiſhnes of mē, or through any natural default (which in this poynt is diligētly to bee marked) but rather by the manifeſt &amp; meere indignation &amp; wrath of God, as ſometimes it is apparant by the voyces of ye prophets, &amp; other vndoubted church hiſtories of the time of our elders, then I thinke yt the rod of God our Father

ought in no caſe to be fled frō. For who is ſo rude, as to beleeue yt his chaſtiſemēt is a fighting in the night, which at al aduentures ſtriketh them that come firſt to hand? nay rather let the faithful perſwade thēſelues aſſuredly of this, that albeit in the reigning of ſuche a Plague Noe, Dauid,
                  Ezech. 6.14. and Iob were preſent, yet through their righteouſneſſe they ſhould but ſaue their own ſoules. For cōcerning ſuche it is true, which vſeth to be ſayde, that it is foremarked out by God, who and by what meanes muſt bee ſpared. But if, as in theſe times it chieflye commeth to paſſe,What muſt be done in ſickneſſes procured by our owne negligence. &amp;c. and as Luther ſaieth of the plague of Witeberge 1527. through our own vnwarines &amp; raſhnes, yt I ſay not enuy &amp; deſpiſing of good counſel ſuch cōmon ſickneſſes do ariſe, &amp; viſit ſome certaine citie particularly and by little &amp; little infect thoſe eſpecially wt are next, as pitch doth thoſe yt touch it, I nothing doubte (I ſay) but that it is lawfull for the godlye &amp; wiſe to flie and ſhun ſuch places, eſpecially hauing a decree of the Magiſtrate ſet downe to that effect, as hath byn ſaide before. For why, if my neighbor wil of purpoſe ſet a fire his houſe, ſhal not I fly from the flame therof? But if it bee alſo ordayned by the authority of the Magiſtrate, that he yt hath no ſtomacke

to tarrie, may depart, ſetting his thinges in ſuch order before hand, that nothing be wāting vnto any bodie, which in theſe diſtreſſes ſhould be greatly needful: his conſcience in this caſe may be altogether free: but if he cōmaund it, there can be no reſiſtance with a good conſcience. For the ſame in this behalf is behooueful oftentimes, which is in greate fires and burnings of houſes, to the quēching wherof, becauſe al perſons are not fit, ſome certaine in ſome cities, are appointed, who onelie vndertake this charge, &amp; is not lawful for others to come run vnto it: or that whiche is done in the beſiegings of cities, that olde men, women, children, weake perſons, who may be only a cumbrance, &amp; no help vnto the common wealth, be for a time put a ſide into a more conuenient hauen, vntill the citie bee deliuered from the enemy.
               And this way I both a Chriſtian, &amp; alſo a Phiſition, leaning vpon the grounds of Philoſophy &amp; diuinitie, without affection &amp; loue to the parties, (as in other matters) the which hath alwaies done much harme to all trueth: moreouer diligently examining the reaſons on both ſides, with a well aduiſed mind haue iudged, that the parties at variāce may bee made friendes, vnleſſe of ſtriuers

they wil become wranglers. But yet if anie man (that I may repeat this again) wil peraduenture complaine as one not contented, I graunt him the Apoſtles, let him appeale vnto what higher iudge he wil: or returning to the old fathers doubtles worthy men &amp; famous for godlines, learning, and wiſedome, let him renew &amp; wage his law a freſh. I being diſpatched out of theſe matters, returne to mine owne buſineſſe.
            
            
               Of carrying foorth of the dead, and accompanying the corſe to the buriall. Cap. 4.
               
                  IF it now fall out (whiche is vſuall in ſuche a ſtate of things) that ſome dye, which are anon to be carried forth and buried, becauſe ſuch a matter requireth diligent heedtaking for the letting of infection here alſo muſt bee ſeene what way may be found out by the preſeruers, that it may be done with as little dā
                  ger as may be. And it conſiſteth chieflie in 2.

articles, to wit, by whom, &amp; how this thing ought to be done. Here therfore it ſhalbe needfull to followe the cuſtome of our Elders, who had a certayne kinde of Mōkes▪ whom, becauſe they wer for the moſt part vnlerned, they were in ſome places called Ignoraunt brethren,
                  Ignorant brethren. or Begardes, as if you would ſay, Keepers of the ſicke: or Lollardes, becauſe they mourned for them that were dead. Whoſe office was, to attend vpon the dead, which required their ſeruice, but eſpecially, to ſerue ſuch as had the plague, and the ſame priuately, ſometimes alſo by admonitions to ſtrengthen and comfort them, and to put the dead in coffins, &amp; to carry them to burying. A cuſtome verily not to bee deſpiſed. And there is extant or abroade a certaine treatiſe, whiche goeth vnder the name of Saint Hierom, but falſly, in which the firſt degree of orders in the Churche is ordayned to bee of them, which burye the dead, whiche office nowe a dayes is counted moſte vyle. But howeſoeuer it bee, there muſt needes bee ſome certayne appoynted, and hyred vppon a publike ſtypende, menne not of ill name, nor ſpendthriftes, nor of the very baſeſt condicion, of the whiche ſome ſhall bee called Sockers, or Buriars, or Dreſſers and

layers foorth of the dead: other Tumbe or Graue makers: others Cleanſers and carriers foorth of the dead: and their office muſt bee to digge graues, to make Coffins, and to put the Corſes in them, to carrie them foorth and burie them. Moreouer alſo in ſuch manner as we ſhal hereafter ſet forth for to cleanſe, waſh, and make cleane the infected houſes, and al things appertayning thereunto, ſo farre as of them ſhall bee required. And theſe beyng thus hyred, ſhal eftſoones be by an earneſt othe, &amp; certaine penalty ſet downe reſtreined, that they go to no other nor make graues for any other, thē ſuch as lie ſick of ye plague, or are dead, but yt they keep thēſelues either at home, or goe abroade marked with ſome mark, as a white wande, or ſome ſuche like thing: neither yet ſo notwithſtāding that they mixe themſelues in the company of mē, or come neere vnto them.
               I would moreouer haue thē admoniſhed, that they perſwade them ſelues to take in hande and execute this charge vile and reprochefull before men, not ſo much for lucre ſake, as for the common bande of charity and humanity: but yt they ſhold know yt they doe a moſt godly work: which ſomtimes holy mē of God, nay Angels thēſelues are read to haue done.
               
                  Therfore that they behaue themſelues ſoberly,Hiſt. eccl. 9. cap. 8. Tob. 1.2. Deut. 24. Bul. 1. de orig. cr. &amp; quietly, &amp; honeſtly vſe the corſes of the dead, as which ſhal be againe the holy houſes of the ſoules, and renewed againe with their ſoules, albeit for a time only they haue departed from them, ſhal riſe againe out of ye earth, and being lightened with heauenly glorie &amp; diuine brightnes ſhal liue with God for euer. We doe greatly eſteeme,Certaine compariſons. and giue ſinguler reuerēce vnto thoſe infants of great princes, whom we think ſhal in time to come poſſeſſe the kingdom, &amp; be rulers of ſo great honors, &amp; ſhal we deſpitefully or vnreuerētly handle thoſe bodies, in the which we ſhal one day ſee our God and brother Ieſus Chriſt after like ſort clothed, &amp; ſhall reigne with him for euer and euer? It is an hainous offence, by anie meanes to violate temples made by the hāds of men, and he which did eaſe himſelfe in the temple of Apollo Pithius, is noted with an immortall infamy, and thought to haue committed a moſt great offence, how much leſſe ſhall it be lawfull for vs, to handle deſpitefully and raſhly the temples of the holy ghoſt, as if they were the carkaſes of bruite beaſts, after the manner of the Cinik Philoſophers? 
                     reaſon 5 When as ſeruants lay their maiſters in bed, going to ſleep, they doe not boyſterouſly caſt

them downe, but handle them ſoftly &amp; handſomely, lay them downe and couer them, it is therefore muche more meete and comely, reuerently to lay downe our dead that ſleepe in the Lorde, in this bedde out of which they ſhalbe rayſed vp vnto life immortall. What  king can take it well, if he eyther heare or ſee his children that are dead to be vſed vnhonorably? When as therfore it is to be beleeued, that thoſe which die in faith, are the ſonnes of God, much more will he be offended, if he ſee any thing done vndecētly vnto the bodies of his faithful. Finally to be ſhort, they which ſhall haue the charge of this matter, muſt remember that the ſame which S. Paule ſaith, that al things in the church are to be done decently, and in order, apperteineth alſo vnto this purpoſe.
               But ſome man may aſke this queſtiō,Solemnitie &amp; honour in buriall. what ſolemnity then, and as it were publike honor ſhal there be, wherewith the dead are wont to be carried forth vnto their graue? In ſundrie cities ſūdry cuſtomes are obſerued, but we in this caſe require as little ſolemnitie as may be. Not that I denie it to becōe chriſtians to be honorably buried, but theſe times require other manners. And becauſe that now pryde creepeth in by little and little, as in tymes

paſt through the couetouſneſſe of Maſſe Prieſtes, and through abuſe defileth a thing otherwiſe commendable.
                     Budaeus and Va
                        
                           •
                        aublus in Fraunce. I haue knowen greate menne, who haue by will diligently prouided, that they woulde bee buryed without all pompe. But theſe are outwarde thinges and indifferent, for the whiche eyther admitted or omitted no man ought to bee iudged. For albeeit the prayſeable cuſtome bee not raſhelie to bee deſpiſed, yet it is reaſon, that the ſolemnitie giue place to neceſſitie: which neceſſitie in the iudgement of all wiſe men, is not ſubiect vnto lawe, but the lawe ought to ſerue and bee ſubiecte vnto it, which might be proued by many examples, if it were needefull. But if men can not otherwiſe be perſwaded, but yt there muſt ſome ſolemne faſhion be vſed, the ſame ought to be moſt moderate or meaſurable, leaſt any hurt might grow therby vnto the whole ſociety or fellowſhip, &amp; leaſt (as that ſame Cato ſayd) in death it ſelfe wee might ſeeme to bee ambitious and proude.
               
                  None of the kinne to go into the houſes of the infected.Furthermore becauſe it is the manner in ſome Cities, for ſuche as are neere in kinne at that time to goe into the houſe of the ſicke, there muſt commaundement bee giuen, that this bee not lawfull for anye: for

the houſes of diuers are verye ſtraight, and ſtinking, which ſtinck moreouer is not a little increaſed with the breath of ſundry men, and maye doe verie muche hurte to tender and weake natures, and ſuch as are not vſed to it.
               Agayne,None of the infected to accō
                     pany the corſe. none out of the infected and corrupted houſes muſt bee ſuffered to accompanie the corſe, albeit cuſtome require it neuer ſo muche: likewiſe as wee haue before appoynted theſe thinges to bee diligentlie obſerued. The ſame is to bee iudged of heapes of children that are ſchollers, who in ſome places are woont to be and ſing at burials. For they are alwayes in more daunger of taking the infected ayer, by reaſon of their tenderneſſe of age, and vnwary kynde of dyet. All whiche thinges that they may by one way bee auoyded, I leane vnto this opinion, whereas I haue ſaide before alſo, that all multitude of people is to bee ſhunned, that this cuſtome bee ſo long broken of vntill the publike ſickeneſſe ceaſe and aſſwage it ſelfe. For the ceremonie is not ſo much to bee regarded, that for it ſake wee ſhoulde indaunger our health. For ceremonies ought to ſerue vs, and not we ceremonies. And we haue byn long ſithence perſwaded, that what

ſoeuer of theſe thinges is done, that it is not done for the helpe of the dead (as our Auncetors haue fōdly beleeued) but for the comfort of them that be aliue (as S. Auguſtine ſpeaketh in another place) namely, whileſt they ſee, that euen after death there ſhall ſome regarde be had of them, and that there is hope of another life, which may comfort in vs this ſorowful departing. But if any wil pretend and alleadge the duety of charitie, the whiche by this meanes may ſeeme to be diminiſhed, and as it were withdrawen from the poorer ſort, they ſhal eaſily be pacified, when as they ſhall ſee the ſame order to be obſerued in all. As for ſuch as moued with a ſinguler zeale ſhall more earneſtly vrge and cal for this olde cuſtome, in them their zeale is to be prayſed, but knowledge is to be required. They muſt be inſtructed therefore, that they may learne in what thinges the duetyes of ſincere godlineſſe and chaſtity doe conſiſt, That the true honour &amp; true burial cuſtomes, is the praiſe of vertues, and remembraunce of valiaunt deedes done, the which albeit it be lawfull in deed to ſolemnize with outward ſhewes, yet is it not alwaies expedient. To be ſhort, that the publike health is more to bee regarded, thē zeale of a few priuate perſons, that I ſay

not the will of ſuperſtitious men, not rightly inſtructed: for too hot zeale and ioyned wt ignorance is ſuperſtition.
               And theſe thinges as we haue ſaide,What ſuperſtition is. the Preſeruers muſt commaund diligently to be kept: whereunto alſo they ſhall adde this, that neither the cheſting of them, nor the carying of them foorth to their graue, be done eyther too ſlowly, or too haſtily. For the one may bring danger of increaſing the infectiō, to wit,Le Lem. de occult. nat. mir. 2. cap. 3. by carrying of ill vapours or reekes frō the rottē carkaſſe, &amp; ſomtimes alſo intollerable ſauours, and doth greatly hurt the hole: the other hath ſometimes beene hurtfull vnto them that haue been thought to bee dead, but were not yet dead in deede.Lib. 1. de peſo  cap. 1. Plin. 7. cap. 52. We know, ſaith Alex. Benedictus, ſome to haue been drawne to their graue by the handes of the buriers half aliue, others of the Nobles to haue been put into their ſepulchres, whoſe life as yet lay hid in the corners of the hart. One of the noble matrones ſo buried (namely at Venice) a little while after was ſeene dead, who notwithſtanding ſitting vp, and remoued from her place among the dead carkaſſes had reuiued,Certaine hiſtories of ſome that haue beene buried aliue. whereof her torne haire, and breſt rent with her nailes were a great token. Alas, howe often beeing aliue

among the dead, did ſhee call vppon the goddes in vaine? The ſame hath been tolde mee of a certaine other, the whiche beeing great with childe at Padway, and thoughte to bee dead, and buried, a little while after in the very ſepulchre, brought foorth aliue two twinnes, who wt their crying, admoniſhing the keepers of the Churche in the night of their miſerable caſe, together with their mother were deliuered from the daunger. And leaſt any man ſhoulde maruaile that they coulde remaine aliue, who coulde not chooſe but be choked by reaſon of being kept from drawing of the ayre, let him know that it is the manner of the Italians, that worſhipful houſes haue peculiar places in the churches, to wit, large cellars and vauted, in the which they lay their dead, put in no coffins, nor couered with earth. The like in maner is manifeſt, &amp; that by ye teſtimonie of a publike table painted and hanged vp at the Church of the Apoſtles, concerning a certaine woman of Coloine, who albeit ſhee were cheſted, and couered with earth, yet deliuered by chaunce, and returning vnto her huſband liued with him a long time after. For when as hee which buried her, minded in the night time by digging vp the graue, to fetch away

a ring which was left vpon her finger being buried, with that ſtirring and pulling, her poore ſoule beeing raiſed vp againe, whiche was thought to haue beene departed from her body, whereas it was but only in a ſowne, reuiued. Laſt of all at Tholoſſa in Aquitania I knewe a poore fellowe, who being buried after the ſame ſort but beeing neither put in a coffin, nor couered with earth, returned againe vnto life, which falſly hee was thought to haue loſt, when as hee was rather taken in a long traunce, at that time when as many dyed daylie of ye plague. What ſhall I ſay more? It is no eaſie matter among ſo many dangerous &amp; great euils not to commit ſome folly &amp; ouerſight. Wherefore wee muſt deale both wiſely and courteouſly, leaſt whileſt wee goe about to ſaue the life of the one, wee raſhly betray the life of the other.
            
            
               
               Of a Church yarde to bee placed without the Citie, and of the manner of building of the ſame. Chap. 5.
               
                  THere remaineth that we ſpeake ſomething alſo of the place of buriall, the which in reſpect of ye reſt, wherein we waite for life euerlaſting with God &amp; his bleſſed Angels, or bodies being laid in the earth,Koimeterion is called a ſleep Chamber, or as we vſually ſpeake, a church yard: of the which, when as it is the opinion of all Phiſitions in a manner, that there doe ariſe from thence infectious and corrupt exhalations or reekes, whiche doe infect the ayre, and wonderfully increaſe corruption (inſomuch yt alſo in the keeping of a healthfull diet, they would haue mens houſes to be farre from church yards) this care alſo muſt be taken in hand by ye 
                  Preſeruers of health, that laying their heads and purſes together, they builde church yardes in a place moſt fit for that purpoſe without the Citie. Whiche

thing beſides the profit ſhall not a litle make alſo for the publike decencie &amp; comelines, &amp; the keeping back of profaning and abuſing the ſame, farre vnbeſeeming chriſtian Cities &amp; vntollerable, as it is eloquently &amp; grauely ſome where written by Martyn Luther, whoſe words becauſe I haue iudged thē meet to be ſet down in this place, I haue thought good thus to tranſlate:The iudgement of M. Luther of churchyards. 
                  Firſt of all (ſaith he) I leaue this to be diſcuſſed by the iudgemēts of phiſitions, who vnderſtand this matter better then I, whether it be done without danger, to haue Church yardes within the walles of Cities or no. For truly I cannot tell, whether any vapour bee drawen out of graues, which may infect the ayre. Whiche thing if it bee ſo, that ſhal be cauſe ſufficient that they be builded without the territorie of the cities. For wee haue ſaid a little before, that all men at all handes are bound to reſiſt infection, when as God himſelfe hath cō
                     maunded vs to haue care of our bodie and life, and when as he biddeth not the contrarie, to take heede vnto ourſelues from perilles: againe with a ſtoute courage to deſpiſe daungers, when as the caſe ſo requireth, ſo that wee may ſeeme readie vnto him alone, both to liue and

alſo for to die. For no man liueth vnto himſelf, neither doth any man die vnto himſelfe: as Saint Paule ſpeaketh in his Epiſtle vnto the Romanes.
                  Chap. 14. 
                  And this I am aſſured of that among the olde as well Iewes as Gentiles, as well godly as vngodly, this was the cuſtome, to haue their burials and graues without the Citie, who notwithſtanding were no leſſe wittie nor wiſe then wee. That whiche I haue ſaid, the Goſpel of Luke doth ſhew, when as Chriſte before the Citie Naim raiſed from death the ſonne of the widdowe. For the text ſaith, that he was carried without the Citie to be buried, and that many followed him. So that there is no doubt, euē by the vſage of this one place, that thoſe men had their burials without the walles of the Citie: as alſo it is euident that the ſepulchre of Chriſte himſelfe was without the Citie Hieruſalem. Abraham bought himſelfe a peculiar place in the fielde Ephron, where all the fathers vſed to be buried, whereupon alſo the Latine worde hath his originall, that the dead are ſaide to be carried out, that is, to bee carryed out of the towne or Citie, which we call to be carried to burying. Albeit ſome nations vſed

alſo to burne the dead carkaſſes,
                  Burning of the dead. 
                  and bring them to aſhes, that there ſhoulde nothing remaine, that might infect the ayre. This therfore ſhalbe my counſaile, that folowing the examples of theſe, we builde our Church yardes alſo without the citie. And verily as ours of Witeberg is placed, not only neceſſitie but alſo honeſtie and godlineſſe ought worthilie to admoniſh vs, nay to force vs, that another ſhould be builded without. For it is altogether beſeeming that ſuch a place ſhould be reuerend, &amp; in a quiet roome, aſide from the high way, as in the whiche a man might bee with ſome religion and deuoutneſſe, to thinke vppon death, the reſurrection, and laſt iudgement, and to pray. The place (I ſay) ought to bee honorable &amp; 
                  He meaneth not popiſh holineſſe, but a ſeparation from common vſe. 
                  holy, that no mā ſhold enter into it without fear &amp; reuerēce: whē as it is to be beleeued, that there are not wāting there many of the ſaints &amp; elect of god. As for ours it is any thing, rather then a ſleepe chamber, or church yard, nay it is almoſt nothing els, thē 4. or 5. common ſtreetes, and 2. or 3. maket places, ſo yt in a maner there is no place of the citie more trodē &amp; more vnquiet.

Ouer this aſwell Cattaile as men doe courſe day and night. Into this euery mā hath either a gate open into his houſe, or els a way made, in this all thinges are done, and oftentimes ſome ſuch thing, as ought not to bee named. Heereof it commeth that all reuerence and honour towardes the monuments, whiche are there placed, is key cold, neither are they any more eſteemed, then ſome vile Golgotha, into the whiche the carkaſſes of bruite beaſtes are caſt aſide: ſo farre that the very Turke doeth not ſuffer his Church yardes ſo vnreuerently to bee prophaned, as wee in name Chriſtians: when as it were meet, as I ſaid before, in this place for vs to renue the memory of true godlineſſe, of death, &amp; of the reſurrection, to thinke vpon the liues of holy men that lie buried heere, and to giue 
                  Hee ſpeaketh not of worſhipping the dead, but of thinking reuerently of them. 
                  honour vnto their ghoſtes. Nowe howe can theſe thinges bee doone conueniently in a place lying ſo open and common vnto euery bodie? Truly for mine owne part, if there be any honour at all to bee ſought in buriall of mine, I had as leeue bee buried in the Riuer Albis, or in a wood, as in ſuch a Church yarde.

But if it were in an other place ſeuerally without the citie, whereunto there were no common entrāce or paſſage through for euery body, then doubtleſſe it would ſeeme a thing religious, honourable to behold, and holy, which might ſtirre vp the commers thither vnto the ſtudye of godlyneſſe. And this my iudgement, he that lyſt may folow: If there be any better thing reuealed vnto an other, let him vſe his own iudgement. I am not Lorde ouer any man. Thus farre the opinion and mind of Luther, the whiche I haue laboured to interpret and tranſlate not ſo eligantly, as faithfully and plainely, when as it ſeemeth a matter of great weight, of which we intreate, and that of greater weight, then commonly it is ſuppoſed to be. For, albeit it be reported of certaine people, that they vſe euery man in his owne houſe to keepe their dead put in Coffins, like as wee in a manner as fondly bury in Churches, ſuch as many tymes are not worthy of the high way: yet that is too barbarous, and vnleſſe they bee well dreſſed with manye precious things, vntolerable.
               Now, concerning the ſituation and manner of buylding,The ſituation of the churchyard. it ſhall bee more agreeable

vnto reaſon, that it be lying more towarde the North, then the South: and that it be ſet rather in a high and dry place, then in a low and wette place. For as it hath beene ſayde before, when as there aryſeth alwayes out of Church-yardes aboundance of infectious exhalations and breathes, and corrupteth the ayre, the ſituation, lownes, and moyſtnes of the ground, may not a litle increaſe this inconuenience: which they witneſſe, who ſometimes white linnen cloathes there. For manye times they finde that they gather an vnpleaſaunt ſmell from out ſuch places: by which meanes it likewiſe happeneth, that often in low and foggy places, kitchins &amp; vallies there appeareth a certaine fier gentlye touching without any hurt, the haire or garmens,Aeneid. 2. &amp; vrb. cond. 1.
                   as Virgil writeth of the childe Aſcanius, and Titus Liuius of Seruius Tull. For this commeth of a certaine fat moyſtnes, or clammy fatnes, which is there more plenteous, whereof aryſeth ſomwhat a thick exhalation or fogge, but yet not ſo hotte, that it can get vp vnto the higheſt regiō of the aire, much leſſe that it can get aboue it. Wherfore by reaſon of the coldnes of ye place, it is dryuen down, and either through the rubbing of it ſelf hard together, or by the reſtraint of the

extreame cold,Fooles fire. is by the force of it own heat ſet on fire. As they alſo ſay of ye rouing and wandring fire (which ſome call fooles fire, Pliny nameth it Caſtor &amp; Pollux, ye Greeks tearme it Polydeukes) the which is wont to folow or go before ſuch as trauel in ye night, eſpecially ſuch as ride or go by ſea, not without ſome frighting of the ignoraunt, which thinke it to be a ſpirit, whereas it is a thing altogether naturall and harmleſſe, the which hurteth no body. But becauſe we are fallen into the mentioning of this naturall imagination, I wil adde hereunto,Whether it bee natural for dead bodyes to be ſeene about graues. that wonderful fabulment or tale, which Hier. Cardanus reporteth of certain dead mē, that were wont to be ſeene about Sepulcres and Graues. The which, leaſt any man ſhould think that I forge vpon him, whē as it is a thing almoſt incredible, I will ſet downe his own words: Dead bodies (ſaith he) to be ſeen in fields about graues, and eſpecially murthered,
                  De vari. rer. 16. cap. 93. 
                  and not deepe buried, &amp; which in their life time were fierce and cruel, to be ſeen I ſay, in the night tyme, and chieflye of ſuche as are ignoraunte of this, is a thinge altogether naturall: When as the moyſt and freſhe bodye of man in the graue, dooth caſt vppe a vapour

alwayes of one likenes according vnto his greatneſſe, which carryeth the ſhape of a man. Whereas in times paſte, when the bodyes were burnt, and put in a veſſell, no ſuch thing was ſeene. This ſaith he, fearefull doubtleſſe to bee heard, but much more to bee ſeene, and the which I rather referre vnto a cunning mockerye of the Deuill (for Sathan mocketh in the mindes of men, and after the manner of Iugglers, maketh many ſights to appeare, by the which he driueth the fearefull eyther into a vaine feare, or elſe vnto idolatry) then vnto the trueth of a naturall thing, if ſo bee alſo that they be done, as they ſeeme to bee done. The which alſo may hereby be vnderſtoode, in that hee ſaith, that they are cheflye ſeene of thoſe, which are ignoraunt of the matter. For the Deuill can ſooner deceaue theſe, as who a good ſeaſon haue toſſed theſe thinges in their mindes, and in their thoughe and power of imagination do conceaue and bring forth vnto them ſelues the phantaſies and imaginations of ſuch thinges,Vaine imaginations. ſo that they thinke they ſee outwardlye, the thing whiche they haue imprinted and ſhaped in their owne brain the which is no new thing in thoſe that are ſicke of the Iandice, and in

melancholike perſons. And that ſuch viſions doe ſeldome or neuer appeare vnto ſtout men, beecauſe that by reaſon of their couragiouſneſſe they neuer feare them, or do once ſo much as conceaue imagination of them, Theodorus Byſantius, and after him,De praeſtig. dem 2. ca 24. Hip. de virg. morb. the moſt worthy Phiſition Iohn Wierus dooth teſtifie: Wherefore, if Cardanus had ſayde further, that thoſe ſpirites had oftneſt beene ſeene of Children, women, fearefull tender, and ſicke perſons, who by reaſon of the weakenes of their mind and body, are troubled with continuall feare and vaine dreams, that which he ſaith ſhould of me more eaſily be credited. But now I cannot chuſe, but put it among the true tales of Lucianus. In theſe thinges I am to ſtay no longer, if I ſhall onely adde this one thing, that thoſe which doe in ſuch ſorte aſſcribe all thinges vnto nature, doe oftentimes delight them ſelues in vaine with their owne errour, and doe imbrace the Image of Helena, for the Goddeſſe her ſelf: when as the moſt of ſuch ſtraunge woonders are often doone by the ſleightes of Deuilles (as I haue ſayde) and many alſo rather by god his miracles, wherof men can yeelde no reaſon, then by any naturall cauſe. Cardanus therfore a moſt

learned man muſt pardō my beeing againſt him in this poynt, for as much as by his own teſtimonie, it is alwayes lawfull to doubte of a generall trueth, howe good ſoeuer the man be that affirmeth the ſame.
               And whereas I ſayde that the Churchyardes are to be placed towards the North, it hath the ſame cauſe, the which hath beene alleaged for the building of the plague houſes.The northwind For the wind which bloweth from this parte, with his thinneſſe and pureneſſe, dooth eaſilye conſume and ſcatter abroade all thicke and troubleſome vapours, and cleanſeth the ayre. Wherefore he wil not bringe anye infectious ſmell, or hurtefull breath into the Citie, the which wee haue proued to be vſuall to riſe out of ſuch places.
               
                  The figure of the churchyard round.Furthermore, although it be but a very ſmall matter: yet that all the circumſtances may be agreeable vnto the nature of the thing, it muſt bee made of a rounde, and not ſquare, or any other figure, and compaſſed with a ſtone wall. Why ſo? whether becauſe this figure of al other is the moſt capable? or beecauſe it is the moſte perfecte? When as all other are founde in this? Verelye for both cauſes, but ye former is of leſſe force,

the latter hath a more fine ſignification. For when as oftentymes manye are to bee buryed, chieflye at that tyme, it ſhall bee profitable, that the ſpace be large, leaſte wee bee driuen to breake vp and open ſome graues that are not verye olde, and to make bare corſes half rotten, which wil be euil fauoured and lothſom, and bringeth danger of infecting the ayre. The roundnes of ye figure betokeneth perfection, both that which they that lye there, haue already receiued, &amp; that alſo which they yet looke for. In which conſideration the heauen it ſelfe is rounde, and thoſe which we reckon for ſaints, and which are appoynted vnto bleſſed eternitie &amp; euerlaſtingnes, vnto the ſame we are woonte to paint a round figure. For there is no end of the circle or ſpere. It may alſo ſignifie, that which the Greekes ſay: Al things belonging vnto man,Al things after a ſort may be ſaid, to followe the mouing of the heauens. are as it were a round circle. For whē as al things wt are vnder heauen, do after a ſort frame them ſelues vnto ye firſt mouing of the firmament, going from lyfe it ſelfe as from the Eaſt, vnto death, as vnto the Weſt, they finiſh their circle with the motion of the whole heauen: like as hee which is returned frō whence he went forth, is ſayde to haue ended his courſe and circle.

Hereunto alſo appertaine the grates of yron before the doore of the Church yardes,Theſe miſteries of this ſection may moſt of thē happily ſeeme more curious then needefull. and the dores or gates, when as they are opened, falling to againe of their own accord, and ſhutting themſelues, that the bruite beaſtes cannot come into them.
               But now it is time, that making an end of this Chapiter of the place, ſituation, figure, and ornamentes of common buryall, I goe vnto other matters of greater weight, then thoſe of which we haue hitherto intreated.
            
            
               Of the cleanſing of houſes, and things infected. Cap. 6.
               
                  IT followeth therefore in order, that when as the ſicke, and thoſe ſuſpected, whiche haue beene with them, haue nowe eyther beene carryed out, or the dead buryed, wee ſpeake ſome thing of the cleanſing of the houſes, and of ſuch thinges as are in them. For this induſtrie or paine taking ſeemeth to ſerue for many thinges, naye without the

which all other labours are taken in vayne, and the miſchief doth eftſoones grow again, yea after long reſting, taking againe as it were new ſtrength, dooth ſometime rage more fiercely, then at the beginning. For truely without al queſtion, it is a thing worthy the wondring at, why oftentimes ſo many men die in one houſe, in the which ſome bodye hath died of the Plague. The which thing, when as none of vs doubte to happen through the poyſoned ayre of yt infected place, we muſte altogether folow the practize of the olde Teſtamente, when as the leprye vſuall vnto that time accuſtomed to cleaue not onely in bodyes, but alſo in garments, ſheetes, walles, and other partes of the houſe, ſo that thoſe things were not only to be waſhed, but alſo ſometimes to be burned. In like manner (I ſay) we muſte deale here, when as the poyſon of the Plague is no leſſe woont to infect al things, and many times hideth it ſelf in the chincks and wals, and lyeth hid many years doing no hurt, vntil that getting an occaſiō to do harm, it breaketh forth with great force, and infecteth as many as come with impure bodies, and take in the ſame by their mouth, or other paſſages of their body, and ceaſeth not from hurting,

before that either the ſubiectes fit to receyue it are remoued, or the naughtie quality of the ayre, bee ſufficiently amended and ſcattered. So Alex. Benedictus telleth of a certayne mattres,A Mattres lying ſeauē yeers in a corner. which through the negligēce of the ſeruaunts being vnwaſht, and vndreſſed, lay caſt in a corner a long tyme, and when as after ſeauen yeeres it was brought forth, and occupied, that which in the meane ſeaſon by meanes of lying ſtil, and of the cold, was vnhurtfull, being ſtirred vppe againe with the heate of the place and of men, and drawne in by the pores or ſmall holes of the ſkinne, ſhewed forth her poyſon, to the deſtruction of the whole houſe. I recited a certaine like thing before of a letherne garment, and diuerſe other infected thinges, of which I had experience. For it is manifeſt and vndoubted, that the peſtilente ayre maye lye longe in ſuche places and houſholde ſtuffe: the which, if it bee ſtirred vp, and get into a corrupt and impure bodye, it verye eaſilye kindleth.In appen. ca. 9. li. 4. de rer. variet. 
                  H. Cardanus indeede a manne much red in hiſtories, telleth, how yt in a certaine Village called Lachiarella, neere vnto Millain, at the buryall of a certaine olde woman, there were found two cheſts full of lynnen cloath, and cloathing, hydden for

feare of warres by the ſpace almoſt of thirtie yeeres. The which beeing opened when as they curiouſly ſearched, as the manner is, they found nothing corrupted in them, yet as many as were preſent at it, or touched &amp; handled the thinges that were layd vppe in them, either then or afterward, dyed al within three daies. Marcilius Ficinus alſo affyrmeth, that wals, olde yron, and ſuch things as be made of wood, vnleſſe they be holpen and remedied by waſhings, perfumes,De Epid. ca. 24.25. and fiers, do keeepe ſtill their infection a whole yeere, or more alſo. Alſo that garments of woollen, and ſuch like, vnleſſe they be often ayred, waſhed, perfumed, or be hanged by the fire, or in the winde or ſunne, do remain three yeares and more, infected. You knowe (ſaieth he) that the ſmell of an hoare orange is kept many yeeres in the boxe wherein it did hoar. Likewiſe, that the ſmel of the moſſe or down in ye ſilk worm cōtinueth long, ſuch as it was before in his ſilk worm. Truely as oile is nouriſhment vnto fire,Wooll keepeth the infection a long time. ſo wol is a noriſhmēt vnto this infection, &amp; doth ſo nouriſh it, that it doth not onely preſerue it, but alſo increaſe &amp; ſtrenthē it. Alſo in an other place: As cōcerning (ſaith he) the diſpoſition of the onely ayre, hee vnderſtandeth the common

and not the priuate ayre) onely ſpeedy taking is ſufficient: ſo when as al men, who ſoeuer they are, haue remayned three monethes free from this ſickneſſe, it may be iudged, that the ayre is now purged. But bee thou moſte warye in comminge neere vnto,
                  Alex. Ben. 1 de peſt. ca. 3.
                   
                  or in touchinge of thoſe thinges, which holde the infection faſter then the ayre dooth. The boughtes of fornaces or ouens in walles doe keepe the infected qualitie longer then wood. Wherefore all thinges are diligently to be purged, with fires, waſhinges, ayering, purfuminges, ſmels &amp;c. Men for the moſte parte are cleanſed in the ſpace of 14. dayes. Houſes, woodden thinges &amp;c. in 21 dayes: cloathes, garmentes, and ſuche like in 28. dayes. Horſes, money, houſhold, fardelles, and ſuch like, vnleſſe you deale merueilous warily, are woont to keepe the infection a long ſeaſon. Wherefore bee thou watchfull, warye and wiſe, and prouide for all thinges in order.
               
               Theſe thinges hitherto in a manner hath Marſilius Ficinus, at the ende of whiche woordes, that I may beginne, I doe by all meanes exhorte and admoniſhe our Preſeruers

alſo, vnto whome I muſte returne agayne, that they vſe eſpeciall wiſdome in this poynte, and diligentlye prouide for all thinges in order. And firſte, that they giue commaundement, as I haue ſayde, by whome this cleanſinge muſt be doone, and ſecondlye, howe it ought to bee doone.
               Wherefore, if they bee yet alyue,Who ought to be appoynted Clenſers. and in health, whiche were lefte in the infected houſes, this charge muſte be committed vnto them, a threatning and penaltie beeing ſette vppon their negligence. But if the houſe be cleane ridde of men, this buſineſſe muſt bee doone by thoſe, whome wee before haue named Buriars, Carryars forth, and Sockers or Dreſſers and layers forth of the dead. And theſe firſte of  all muſte open the doores and windowes, that the winde may paſſe through more freelye. Secondlye, they muſte make fiers of  conuenient matter, as of Oke, Iuniper, Beach, Willowe, &amp;c. that the ayre of the whole houſe maye bee purged. Thirdlye, if there bee anye thinges of ſmall valewe, as of cloathes, garment, and linnes of little worth, they muſt eyther caſt it into the riuer, or burne it in a place by it ſelf out

of the company of men. Fourthly, touching ſettles, tables, garmēts of ſome price, cloths, beds, &amp;c. they muſt not onely waſh them with a ſpecial care, but alſo ſoak them in lie, beat them, and hange them out on breathing in the aire: For if it be not ſo done, it is to be feared, leaſt the infection be not ſufficiētly  vaniſhed away, and leaſt that within ſhort time after it reuiue againe. The wals alſo muſt be ſcraped with tooles of yron for the purpoſe, and be done ouer with new lime, &amp; whited. Fiftly the whole houſe muſt be oftē purged with perfumes of the dried leaues of Oke, or beries and wood of Iuniper, or frā
                  kenſence, or ſuch other like ſmelling things.  Sixtly, when as they haue doone al theſe things, with ſuch painfulnes, order and diligence, as I haue ſayde, they muſt at length ſtrowe all the flooers with ſweete hearbes, as with Sage, Iſop, Lauender, Feuerfew, Baſil, Rue, Spike, Roſemary, Roſes, Water lilly, Violets, Vine leaues, and Willow leaues, &amp;c. according vnto the time of the yeere, the which particularly here to ſette downe is needeleſſe. And all theſe thinges ought farre more diligently and painfully to be done in thoſe dwellings which are vnder the earth: becauſe that whileſt there is here

no free vent, they do much longer keepe, the hidden and imprinted infectious poyſon of the Plague, then thoſe which are in an open and free ayre.
            
            
               Of keeping of thoſe, which haue beene in infected houſes. Cap. 7.
               
                  WHat order is to be taken for thoſe whiche haue beene in companye with the ſicke of the plague, albeit I haue made ſome mention hereof before, yet in this place ſomthing is to be ſaid thereof againe, and that more expreſly, for it ſeemeth not to be conuenient, yt they ſhould goe euery where vp and downe at their pleaſure, or occupy their cō
                  mon trades, ſetting opē their houſes ſtreight after the dead corſes are caryed to burying. Therefore they either haue beene with them of neceſſitie, as houſholde ſeruaunts, which tended vpon the ſicke, and Phiſitions, Chirurgians, Preachers, which applyed medicines vnto the bodye and ſoule, and briefly others that carried forth ye dead to burying: or

elſe they were with them not of neceſſitie,Thoſe that once or twiſe haue viſited the ſick of the plague. as thoſe which came not vnto them daylye, but by the way peraduenture once or twiſe to ſee them. Theſe if they vſe ſome dilygence in cleanſing their bodyes and garments, it ſhall be ſufficient onely for the ſpace of 14. dayes to keepe them ſelues within their owne houſes, if ſo be that no worſe thing haue followed. But they which haue doone the office of Phiſition &amp; Chirurgian, it hath beene already ſet downe, that theſe ought to refraine the companye of other men the whole time of the Plague. The houſholde, and ſuche as haue daylye kept companye with the ſicke in one houſe, haue need of a longer time to cleanſe them. But if yee be minded to giue them leaue to go abroad, neuertheleſſe for the auoydinge of infection, they muſte be forbidden publike Churches and other aſſemblies, vnleſſe they openly carry with them a little ſtaffe, or white wand, as a token of the plague, and that notwithſtanding they diligently ſhun ye company of the ſound. If any ſhall refuſe ſo to doe, they are to bee puniſhed by a ſharpe decree of the Preſeruers, that for the ſpace of ſixe whole weekes, they venture not to goe out of theyr houſes, yet ought

they much more ſtreightly to bee kept in,Such as haue had the plague. who themſelues haue had the Plague, although nowe they bee neuer ſo much healed of it. For in ſuch a cleanſing there needeth the ſpace of two monethes. But they of all other moſt ſtreightly, which preſently yet now haue the Plague: of the cleanſing of whome what ought to bee decreed, becauſe they haue yet nowe to wraſtle with death, it cannot bee ſet downe. For albeit they be for the moſt part weaker, then that they can goe abroade out of their houſes, yet it ſometimes falleth out, that the ſickneſſe graunteth them truce for certaine dayes, when as the poyſon cannot goe ſo ſpeedily vnto the principall members, nor take the Caſtle of life, being letted either by the thickneſſe of the bodie, or by the naturall ſtrength of the bowels, or els by the leſſe or weaker qualitie of the diſeaſe. Theſe then are wont willingly to ſhufle in themſelues among the aſſemblies of men, led either by a certaine ſimple errour, for that they thinke, that they thē ſelues ſhalbe deliuered, if they can rub their diſeaſe vpon others. For ſuch wit hath the olde Diuell the maſter of miſchiefe to indue men with falſe beliefe, and (as the common people ſaith) to turne the wheele, promiſing

vaine hope of health: or els they are led by errour ioyned with lewdneſſe: that is, with a mind to commit a moſt notorious and cruel offence, namely, to infect and kill many other with them. For ſome are of ſo peſtilent a minde, that they farre exceed the peſtilence of the body. He that hath not had ſome experience in the worlde,A peſtilent kinde of people. nor ſeene the townes of many men, nor knowen the minde, will ſcant giue credite vnto my wordes: but in truth I can boldly auouch, that I haue ſeene with theſe eyes, them, who, when as they haue had the ſore running vpon them, ſo that they could not doubt of the ſickneſſe, haue thruſt thēſelues into the Church, &amp; ſecretly haue together with others receiued ye bread of the Lorde, and out of the ſame cup haue drunken the wine of the Lord: I tremble at the telling of it, albeit at that time there enſued hurt vnto none thereby: the Lord doubtleſſe ſo prouiding, who doth deliuer vs from all euill. But who woulde not thinke ſuche fellowes rather Diuels (I ſpeake with M. Luther) then men? Or at the leaſt wiſe to bee moſt peſtilent men, then whom the peſtlence it ſelfe is more gentle? And as priuie murtherers, doe one while thruſte theſe into the hearte with a dagger, and another

while theſe, the which it is not knowen vnto whome it may bee laide, ſo theſe moſt notorious infected murtherers, and mad dogs, do here infect a boy, there a man or a womā. And when according to their power they haue infected all things, they prate that their faulte is to bee laide vnto none but vnto the will of God. And they reioyce and laugh in their ſleeue, as if the matter were well done, when as they heare of the miſeries of others, of the whiche they themſelues were cauſes. O moſt cruell poyſoning: the which ought by no meanes to remain vnpuniſhed, nay is worthie eyther of equall or alſo of greater puniſhment then the murthers of common robbers.De varieta. rerum 15. cap. 8. 
                  Cardanus telleth howe that it happened at Caſalis a Citie of Salaſſia in the yeere 1536. that certaine conſpired together (namely fortie men and women togeather with the hangmān) that they would make annoyntment, wherewith they would annoynt the barres of doores, that they which touched them, might bee infected: and would alſo make a powder that being ſecretely ſprinkled vpon the garmentes of men, ſhoulde woorke theyr deſtruction: (the plague had been extreeme in that place a little before,

and nowe was ceaſed) but their conſpiracie beeing founde out, they were all put to death with ſinguler torments. They confeſſed alſo, that they had determined at a ſolemne pomp vpon a certaine Saint his day, by annoynting the ſeates to ſlay all the Citizens, &amp; that they had prepared aboue twentie pottes for this purpoſe. They attempted the ſame alſo ſometimes at Geneua, and were executed. And is the facte of theſe I pray you more haynous, then of thoſe whō I haue ſpoken? Or who woulde thinke that men baptized with the Baptiſme of Chriſte, and ordeined vnto the kingdome of God, could fall into ſo great a wickedneſſe? Who had not rather liue among beaſtes, thē in one Citie with ſuch altogether vnworthy of the names of men? Wherefore it behooueth our Preſeruers to bee ſtout puniſhers of ſo great enormitie or diſorder, that for the common ſafetie of the ſocietie and felowſhip, they ſuffer not ſuch priuie enemies and wicked traitours to goe ſcotfree, after the example of moſte woorthie common wealthes, of which there hath been mention made.
               
                  The dutie of ſuch as be recouered of the Plague.Further they which haue been ſicke of the Plague, and nowe are ſomewhat recouered,

ought volūtarily to admoniſh others, to ſhunne their companie, for when as they, being in this miſerie haue been courteouſly holpen, hauing now recouered health they ought againe to conſider, that they driue not others into the ſame miſerie, the which were a tricke of moſt vnthankfull perſons. If God himſelfe (ſaith Luther) in the old Teſtament commaunded, that the Lepers ſhoulde bee put a part without the Citie frō the companie of the people, for the auoiding of infection, and that they ſhoulde not be receiued again vnleſſe they were iudged cleā
                  ſed, it behoueth vs much more in this dangerous infection to followe the ſame: neither in this caſe may we be vnruly and diſobedient, &amp;c. For I haue before rehearſed more, ſpoken Chriſtianly by him to this purpoſe. In the which, to ſpeake freely, albeit the coūſaile of ſeperatiō do greatly like me,The leprie of the olde teſtament. yet do I not thinke this opiniō to be allowed of al, in the cauſe, wherin this danger in the infectiō of ye Leprous is thought to conſiſt (vnleſſe peraduenture this ſometime happen for the contempt of God his commandemente: for their companie was very ſtreightly forbidden) into the mention of whiche thyng becauſe I am fallen againe, and haue often

before ſpoken of it, I will not refuſe to repeate it againe in fewe wordes. For firſt it is not certaine that the Leprie of the olde teſtament was a diſeaſe, hurting the actions of nature, or curable by any counſaile or remedie of man: nay in the opinion of S. Auguſtine,
                  De ciuit. dei. it was rather a defiling and vncleanneſſe, in deede not common, but eſpecially ſent by God, then a diſeaſe of the body, and (as hee ſpeaketh) rather a blemiſh of the colour and ſkin, then of health, or of ſoundeneſſe of the ſenſes and members. Wherfore the Scripture alſo doth oftner vſe the worde of cleanſing then of healing, when as it ſpeaketh of the curing of this griefe. And in my iudgement certaine famous Phiſitions doe very well diſtinguiſhe this our Leprie, whiche is called of the Greekes, Elephantiaſis, from that of the Hebrews, which of thē is named Saharath, and of the whiche mention is made in Leuiticus and in the Euangeliſts. For this diſeaſe (ſay they) is not of them, which thorowe errour are wont to happen in ſixe not naturall thinges, where as it is indeede a griefe proceeding from the wrath of GOD,Amat. Luſi. whiche according to the

nature of the ſinne is wont to happen not onelye vnto the bodyes of menne, but alſo vnto garmentes, and the walles of houſes, in the which thoſe tranſgreſſours dwelled: according to the greatneſſe (I ſay) of the faulte. For if the fault were ſmall, certaine ſmall ſpottes dyd aryſe in the walles of the houſe: if it were greater, they did cleaue vnto garments: but if it were a moſt greate ſinne, then the bodie of the ſinner was defiled with the ſame. And thoſe that were ſuſpected of this Leprie, were iudged of the hygh Prieſte by the ſpace of fourteene dayes, whether they were to bee ſhutte out of the companie of men or no. For there was no neede of the helpe of man to the curing of the ſame, but onely of the hande of GOD. All which this (lyke as manie other) are nowe ceaſed.
               But concerning this our Elephantiacall Leprie,
                  Elephantiaſis, or Leprie of our time. which doth moſte greatlie differ from this other, this is manifeſte out of the bookes of Phiſitions, and nature of the ſame, yt it is a diſeaſe comming of the fault of the bowels, &amp; humours, very fierce

and as it were a canker of the whole bodie: the which in times paſt (as hiſtories report) was peculiar vnto Aegypt: and not ſeene in Italie before the age of Pompeius Magnus. What? that euen at this day it is more ſeldome in Italie, then in our countrie of Germanie,
                  Ant. Be. de abd. morb. cau. cap. 98. or the lowe countries of Belgia neere vnto it, or in Fraunce: the which ſome write to happen vnto the one, becauſe of their vnſodden meates, and vnto the other by reaſon of the conſtitution or qualitie of the ayre:Lib 2. ad ad Glauc. but howe truly, ſee they, whiche make themſelues ſo readie arbitrers, and as it were vmpiers in weightie cauſes and controuerſies. For Galen thinketh that it is ſeldome ſeene in Germanie, often in Alexandria, looking peraduenture vnto his times: I with Amatus Luſitanus doe rather aſcribe it vnto their ill maner of diet. For they indifferently &amp; without any choiſe or order feede on fiſh, podware, ſome fruits, milke,Nat. hiſto. 26. cap. 1.
                   and white meates. The Leprie called Elephantiaſis is deſcribed by Plinie after this maner, that it is ſaide oftentimes to begin at the face, firſt in the noſe, as it were a little Lentill, anone going ouer the whole bodie, ſpottie, of diuers colours, and the ſkin vnequall, in ſome place thicke, in ſome

place thin, with an hard or rough ſcab, &amp; laſt of all increaſing and eating the fleſhe to the bones, the fingers and toes ſwelling both in handes and feete. This is the definition of Plinie. That manner of curing is chiefly cō
                  mended by Galen,
                  Gal. 11. fac. med. ſimp. whiche is done by the vſe of Vipers fleſhe: the whiche I my ſelfe alſo in Italy, haue hearde to bee commended by moſt excellent Phiſitions, and haue ſeene alſo fitly vſed. But theſe thinges are not for this place. But this heereout appeareth, that there is a great difference betweene the Elephantiaſis, that is the Lepri of this time, &amp; that, when in the old teſtament was an eſpeciall puniſhment of ſinners, both as concerning their nature, and manner of curing: the whiche Leonhardus Fuchſius hath alſo obſerued in his Paradoxis:Lib. 7. ca. 16. but not in like ſort Franciſcus Valleriola in his medicinall enarrations.
                  Lib. 6. cap. 5.
               
               But ſome man will obiect:Obiection. yet both of them muſt be infectious, when as both that are infected with thē, are ſeparated from the company of men. I aunſweare,Anſweare. what if there bee not in them both the like cauſe of ſeparation? For peraduenture they were for this cauſe ſeparated among our auncetours from other men, becauſe it was a fouleneſſe and

certaine filthineſſe that God woulde not abyde in his people: as whiche it behooued to excell in the cleanneſſe as well of bodye as of mynde: or for that they whiche were defiled with theſe ſpottes, ſhoulde ſuſtayne ſome puniſhement: to witte, that both they ſhoulde abſtayne from the company of others, &amp; others likewiſe from theirs: which thing in the iudgement of ſome was an Image of our excommunication at this daye, whiche they commonlye call bannition or abannition, that is abſence for one yeere. But our Leprous are herefore remoued from the companie of men, becauſe they haue a diſeaſe both grieuous and alſo infectious:Gord. par. 1. cap. 22. Albeeit to ſpeake as I thinke, I doe not iudge the infection to bee ſo greate, as manie doe ſuppoſe. Nay rather in my iudgement that diſeaſe is more infectious, whiche in our tyme wee call the Frenche pockes, becauſe of eyther the beginning or propagation and ſpreading from thence, and the whiche Ioan. Manard. iudgeth to bee a kynde of Elephantiaſis,

                  but not truelie in my iudgement: albeeit that it bee not ſo daungerous, eſpecially at this daye, when as the force thereof waxeth weaker by lyttle and little, ſo that wee maye hope that it

will at length ceaſe altogether, as of the tetter whiche Plinie mentioneth, there remayneth at this daye no tokens. But as concerning the Elephantiacall lepri, I haue often diligentlye enquired of them, whiche were diſeaſed with it, but I coulde ſeldome vnderſtande that anye was infected by their companie, albeit thoſe that are ſounde are often conuerſaunt with them,Leonb. Zac. 9. in Rha. ca. dephthiſ. nay (that which is more woonder) albeit the ſicke huſbandes vſe the company of their ſound wiues, &amp; ſome times beget ſounde children: which ſhoulde be incredible, if the force of the infection were ſo great, as it is thought of many for to bee. Whiche thinges ſithence they be ſo, and yet neuertheleſſe they are put apart from the company of other and that with greate carefulneſſe, for what daunger ſoeuer of infection, or at leaſtwiſe ſuſpition of infectiō: I ſay agayne that whiche I haue often ſayde alreadye, that there muſte farre more care be vſed in the infection of the Plague. But theſe thinges peraduenture may ſeeme more at large debated then was meete: whiche the indifferent Reader will eaſilye pardon mee, if he ſhall conſider that it is not vnprofitable, that ſometimes wee bee put in minde of ſundrye matters. For this thinge ſtirreth vp

wiſe men to a more diligent ſearching out of trueth: which trueth, as Pythagoras ſaide, is drowned and hidden in a moſt deep well.
            
            
               An admonition vnto euerie ſubiect of the common wealth, to imploye his ſeruice to keepe away the common daunger of infection by the plague. Cap. 8.
               
                  BVt peraduenture there will not ſome bee wanting, who with diſcontented minds wil ſpeake againſt theſe our conſtitutions or orders, eyther for that through lack of iudgment they cannot throughly weigh and vnderſtand the matter, or for becauſe they cannot away with ſuch counſaile, whereby they perceiue thēſelues to be brought into order: for the common ſort vſeth to be vnwilling to beare all yoke. But theſe are foorthwith to haue their anſweare.Such as thinke the Plague to come alwayes immediatly from God. As for thoſe who perſwade themſelues that the Plague cōmeth alwayes immediately from God as a peculiar and immediate whip, and therefore attribute nothing vnto the helpe of man, I can do

no more but counſaile theſe, to ſuffer themſelues to be better inſtructed. Such as can abide no order ſetting themſelues openly againſt our Preſeruers, and will vrge or bee earneſt for their olde cuſtome &amp; liberty, theſe I would altogether haue admoniſhed, to conſider, that they alone are not heere prouided for, but alſo their wiues, children &amp; kinſfolke, yea the whole ſociety and fellowſhip. What barbarouſnes then ſhoulde it be, to be vnwilling for a ſmall time to beare that which thou mayſt ſafely doe, to the ende thou mayeſt bee deliuered from it, which if it happē vnto thee, thou canſt not beare but with the hazarde of thy life? Goe to, who would not willingly in the time of warre, or in the beſieging of a citie, ſuffer to haue ſome newe lawes,Le. Lem. 2. de occul. nat. mir. cap. vlt. but yet neceſſary for that ſtate, by the Senate, or Lieuetenant of the ſouldiers, to be preſcribed vnto him, by the which he vnderſtandeth that both his goods and life, and alſo his countrie mens may be defended and preſerued? Nay who would not labour with all his might &amp; mayne to keepe away the enemy from his borders, if he be abſent: or to thruſt him out if he be entred the citie? Who in a common ouerflowing of water, will not take paynes to keepe and mainteine the bayes, to ſtrengthen

houſes, to deliuer cattell, to helpe men ſwimming, to giue if it bee but a borde to them that are like to bee drowned, if hee can doe no more? Who woulde not run and help the ſheep, if the Wolfe ſomewhere breaking into the folde, ſhoulde teare the flocke? Who (I ſaye) is indued with ſo cruell an heart, which in theſe miſeries wold not both with hande and foote, ſo farre as hee were able, bring ayd in things going thus to wrack and ruine? Who of tenderneſſe coulde with a quiet minde beholde theſe miſeries of his neighbours? O heart altogether deuoyde of all humanity, and as hard as the Adamant, or rather bruitiſh, that in this caſe thinketh that there is anye place for ſlouth and ſluggiſheneſſe? Bruite beaſtes helpe one an other, and that readilye, if anye trouble befall them from others: and ſhall manne that hath his name of manhoode (whiche woorde conteyneth in it all kinde of duetie) for the reteining of an vnprofitable libertie in the greeuous affliction of a whole Citie, not be content to haue commendable, commodious, neceſſary lawes, yet not perpetuall, but temporall, preſcribed vnto him? And according to the equitie of theſe lawes to haue the

common wealth, and the ſafetye and lyfe of his fellowes mainteyned?Obiection. But (ſaye they) the examples whiche you bringe are vnlyke: becauſe GOD is the Authour of the Plague, but men, or other creatures are the Cauſers of theſe. As though anye thing came to paſſe without the prouidence of God, yea or without his diuine decree.Anſweare. As if there were anie euill in the Citie, whiche God hath not done.Amos 7.
               
               But theſe thinges in tymes paſte haue beene handeled by vs. Goe too, if we ſee any manne to bee preſſed with hunger, doeſt thou not thinke that by the commaundement of GOD we are bounde to giue him meate? Albeeyt hee bee a Turke, albeeit hee bee an Heathen, albeeit hee bee our enemie? Howe muche more then doe wee owe this duetye vnto our brethren, our neighboures, our citizens, whoſe helpe wee canne neuer bee without? Nowe if wee withdrawe our helpe from thoſe whiche are in ſuche ſorte in neede, bee wee not murtherers before God? Saynt Iohn ſayeth, hee that loueth not his neighboure, committeth murther, and that loue doth not remayne in him. And ſuch was one of the ſinnes whiche GOD

layde againſt Sodome, as Ezechiel ſaieth, Behold theſe are the ſinnes of thy ſiſter Sodome, idlenes, riot, not regarding of her neighbour. After the ſelf ſame ſort ſhal Chriſt ſay at the laſt iudgement: I was an hungred and ye gaue me no meate, I was ſicke, and ye did not viſite me, and if then it be ſo great a fault, to denie meate, or not to viſite the ſicke, how much more great a fault ſhall it be, not to take away according to our power as it were preſent death and deſtruction? I wold to God that with theſe pratlers and contemners of the publike ſafetie, the counſell of the moſt excellent and noble M. Luther might finde place, who ſo wiſely, ſo godly,Luther. and finally, ſo carefully perſwadeth al kinde of helpes to bee vſed, which by anye meanes may profit: and will by no meanes haue any thing omitted, which any way may quench ſuch a fire. So behaue thy ſelf (ſaith he) as one that is deſirous to quenche a common fire in a citie.
                  The Plague is a fire. 
                  For what els is the plague, then a certaine fire, which doeth not conſume and deuour wood or chaff, but the life and bodie? Therefore euery one of vs ought thus for to thinke: if Satan by the will of God, either by him ſelfe or his miniſters hath wrought vs

this deadlie infection, I on the other ſide before all thinges will praye vnto God, that of his mercie hee will take away the ſame from vs: Then I wil put to my ſimple helping hande, both by perfuming and cleanſing of the ayer, both by vſing of medicines, &amp; alſo in ſhunning the infection, where my preſence is not neceſſary, leaſt I might ſeeme my ſelfe to haue neglected ſome thing, or be cauſe of death vnto others, who through my negligence may take harme. But if God neuertheleſſe will haue me viſited with this ſickneſſe, or cal me out of this world vnto him, at leaſtwiſe I haue done that whiche was my duetie, neither haue offended any thing, either againſt my ſelfe, or my neighbour. But where my ſeruice is needefull, there I will let paſſe nothing of all thinges which either can or ought to bee done of mee. Beholde this is that godlie faith indeede, whiche doeth nothing raſhly, neither tempteth God in anie thing. Thus muche in a manner after this ſort hath Luther, but in Dutche. Therfore if ſuche wiſedome and fidelity were ſeen firſt in the Magiſtrate, then in the Citizens, truely the Plague woulde bee muche

more tollerable. But wheras the one are too raſhe and careleſſe, &amp; the other contrariwiſe too feareful, there Sathan eaſily at his pleaſure toſſeth all thinges vp ſide down, and the miſery doeth ſo farre daylie increaſe, that at the length there is a pitiful plight of ye whole citie.Miſeries that happen in the time of a common Plague. For traffick waxeth cold, there groweth a dearth of al things, the Churche aſſemblies ceaſe, charity is in ieopardy, al things are ſuſpected, &amp; as the Poet ſaith, The wandring gueſt doth ſtand in dāger of his hoſt, the hoſt in daunger of his gueſt, &amp; fathers of their ſonne in lawes, yea ſeldom time doeth reſt betweene borne brothers ſuche accorde and loue as ought to be. Due honor is giuen neither vnto the magiſtrate, nor vnto parents, al diſcipline is neglected. Nothing but trembling, deſpaire, crying of yōg children, a noyſe of women, weeping, mourning, ſorow, feare, dying of families, falſifiing or ſtaying of teſtaments and willes, confuſion of inheritaunces, waſting of the Citie, decay of the common wealth, &amp; to conclude, nothing is heard or ſeene but al kinde of miſerie. All which things they ought worthilie to ſet before their eyes, which doe ſo little eſteem of this cauſe, yt they wil beare nothing, no not for a ſmall time onelie, for the ſake

thereof, the which is both eaſie to be done, &amp; vnhurtfull, nay profitable for them: but either vnder colour of religion, whoſe force they knowe not, or through rebellion they deſpice commendable &amp; profitable lawes to the common wealth: and vnthankfully reiecte thoſe, which giue thē healthful counſel with greate trauaile, and faithful carefulnes, whiche they may vſe &amp; coſt them no money: vnto whoſe ignoraunce notwithſtanding in reſpect of the publike profite, our Preſeruers ought in no caſe to yeeld: but rather ought to follow that excellent counſel of Hippocrates, that they conſtauntly follow and continue in the ſame, which at the beginning they haue by graue aduice thought moſt expedient.
               Let euery man thinke theſe thinges to be ſayde vnto him eyther in my name, or in the name of the Preſeruers, and earneſtlye indeuour faithfullye to helpe his diſtreſſed Countrey. Whiche if hee doe not, let him feare puniſhment both at the handes of God and men.
            
            
               
               Of the puniſhement of ſuch as raſhly offend. Chap. 9.
               
                  WHerefore, becauſe that hitherto we haue ſet downe what is needefull to bee done, neither haue let paſſe any thing yt by reaſon might be ſaide, or is appertaining profitably vnto the matter: and alſo haue exhorted all men diligently and earneſtly vnto the obſeruation or keeping of theſe conſtitutions or orders, it now followeth, that if any man be found ſlacke or vnfaithful in his office, that he, the cauſe being knowen, ſuffer puniſhmēt according vnto the greatnes of the fault. For what ſhall it profite to haue made many good lawes, if they be not kept? And they wil not be kept, vnleſſe there be due puniſhment vpō the offenders. For ſuch as are good, will of their owne accorde doe all thoſe things whiche are beſt. For the law is not made for the iuſt, but for tranſgreſſors or offenders. The Magiſtrate alſo carrieth not the ſword in

vayne, but is a feare vnto thoſe that do euil. There is one hath ſayd very well, yt no common wealth can ſtande without lawes, that lawes are worth nothing, if there be no action: and that al action is in vaine, if there bee no execution. Let vs therefore beginne at the beginning, and let vs ſee, what penalty is to be ſet downe to euery one that ſhall raſhelye breake the lawes of theſe ordinaunces, the which I proteſt that I feare not to make, if I ſhoulde be in daunger to looſe my life for the ſame.
               Firſt of all concerning the Preſeruers themſelues,
                  The Preſeruers. albeit they ſhalbe the rulers and ouerſeers of theſe lawes, yet they ought not to claime vnto themſelues more liberty, then the higheſt Emperor his maieſty it ſelf wold haue vnto himſelfe: who although he cōfeſſe himſelfe to be aboue the lawes: yet he ſaith yt he wil obey &amp; be ſubiect vnto the lawes.

                      cod. de begib. Item L. princeps ff. de legib. And truly equity doth require, that looke what euery man ordeineth vnto others the ſame alſo he beare himſelf. It is ye ſaying of Iſocrates, that the common people willingly folow the ſame which they ſee their rulers to be delighted withal. Therfore let the Preſeruers by al meanes indeuor to maintein their authority, &amp; let them labour not only in name, but alſo in

deede to be Preſeruers of health, and from their heartes to procure the common ſafety. But if either they thēſelues ſhal do any thing negligētly, or of fauour (which in ye iudgmēt of the very heathē becōmeth not a magiſtrat) beare with others: by the decree of ye Senate or whole benche, whiche thing will procure them infamie, let them be put from their office, and be brought into the order of common Citizens.

But if they ſhalbe foūd guilty of ſome light fault, let thē recompence it with greater diligence. They which cannot doe all thinges ſo handſomely and ſkilfully as only ye moſt excellēt Phiſitions cā do, they are cleared by the law it ſelfe. For it is alwaies a hard thing to attaine vnto that which is righteſt,L. lat. L. mag. ff. de ver. &amp; re. ſig. neither can wee all bee Hippocrateſes or Galenes. As for ſuch as haue made an open fault, that is of groſſe &amp; purpoſed ignoraunce, haue offended in that the whiche for the moſt part all men of their calling woulde haue done otherwiſe, and better, let them ſuſtayne ſome arbitrary penaltie

according to the pleaſure of the magiſtrate, which may conſiſt either in putting thē out of office, or abridging of their ſtipēd, or finallye in impayring their eſtimation and good name. Other faults are left to be puniſhed according vnto ye imperial lawes or conſtitutions &amp; ſtatutes of princes. In the meane ſeaſon both theſe and the miniſters of the Church that followe, muſt abſteine from the company of others, or els ſuſtaine an arbitrary puniſhment.
               The miniſters of the Churche, who are the Phiſitions of the ſoules,Miniſters. cannot eaſily offend in their office, if they bee deſirous from their heart to be that which they are called, &amp; ſhewe not thēſelues ſlow vnto any, nor haue reſpect of perſons, which doth at no hand beſeeme them. Wherefore publike crimes excepted, if they ſhal do any thing negligently,
                     Pro. 15. or not behaue themſelues godly, we wil leaue them to be puniſhed vnto God the vncorrupt iudge, &amp; ſearcher of things, and of the heart, or at the moſt ſuſpend them from their office, and in the meane ſeaſon take from them a monethes wages.
               Among the Citizens,Citizens. whoſoeuer ſhall be found a breaker or tranſgreſſor of ye order appoynted, let him haue puniſhement according

vnto the nature of his fault. If any man be found drunken,Drunkards. he is to be puniſhed either by ſome publike ſhame, or forfeyture of monie, obſeruing the circūſtance of perſō, occaſiō, oftennes, &amp; greatnes. They that ſhall daunce,Dauncers. trim vp or goe vnto publike bathes, or be married, ſhall haue ſome ſmal puniſhement: but if they get a ſpeciall priuiledge, no puniſhment at al. For there may ſuch cauſes fal out, why ſome thing may be graunted vnto ſome, the which ought not commonly to be done vnto all.
               They that ſhal aduenture to bring into the city,Sellers and buyers of things vnlawfull. &amp; to ſel things forbiddē, are worthily to be puniſhed with the loſſe of ye thinges thēſelues. The ſame puniſhmēt is to be laid vpon ye buiers, if they yet now haue wt thē the things hole &amp; vntouched: otherwiſe let the puniſhement be equal vnto the price of the things.

If he ſhal forſlow it, let the puniſhment bee increaſed according to the number of euerie day: or els let it bee cauſed by the officers to be carryed away vpon his double charges.

Horſes, if they breake out of the ſtable, and run away, muſt bee reſtored vnto ye owner. For ſuch are not wont to runne vp and downe.

The ſame is to be ordeined againſt thē, whiche go out of one plage houſe into another.

               A regiſter or brief rehearſall, conteining the orders ſet downe in theſe two bookes, Chap. 10.
               
                  AFter that hitherto wee haue ſet foorth ſuch things as we thought to appertaine vnto the office of a faithfull and wiſe Magiſtrate, in preſeruing and deliuering the common wealth from the infection in the time of the plague, and haue hādled many things ſomewhat at large: it ſeemeth not amiſſe, to repeate briefly, &amp; after ye maner of a regiſter, the more profitable and chiefe orders: if happily any man haue not either leiſure, or els like not to reade the whole diſcourſe: for ſo he may both the more eaſily remember thē, and bee leſſe wearie.
               
               Therefore when as we ſhalbe perſuaded that it appertaineth vnto the office of the gouernours

of the common wealth, not only to furniſh the citie with things neceſſarie, but alſo to keepe away things hurtful &amp; diſcommodious (amongſt which hurtful things are eſpecially conteined common &amp; generall diſeaſes, which hurt men by infection, ſuch as chiefly the plague is) the magiſtrates muſte beware of this, that here they giue no place to ſlougth or negligence, but rather with all indeuour, ſtudie, faithfulnes, &amp; wiſdom, perform ye, which they ſhal vnderſtād to cōcerne the profit and health of the whole felowſhip and all their ſubiects.
               And firſt of al, yt they cōmand vnto their ſubiects  a publike repētance, &amp; together with ye people ſetting before thē amēdment of life, yt they ſet thēſelues before God ye moſt bounteous &amp; almightie, crauing earneſtly at his hands pardon both for theyr ſinful life paſt, &amp; hotly deſiring aid in their preſent miſerie.
               
                   Furthermore their conſcience thus approued vnto god, being wel ſtrēgthned in faith, hope, and charitie, let thē imploy all the ſeruice of mā, that they let paſſe nothing, which either reaſon counſaileth, or neede requireth. And becauſe ye order in all things is neceſſarie, whether we wil do any thing that is profitable, or hinder that which is hurtful: &amp; diſorder &amp; confuſion hated of God himſelfe: it

ſhalbe great barbarouſnes, in other thinges to haue good rules, &amp; in ye breaking in of diſeaſes as it were of cruel beaſts to vſe no wiſdome, to make no lawes agreeable vnto reaſon. Wherfore as the natural Philoſophers do appoint vnto euery ſphere of the heauen, his mouer, &amp; as it were gouernor: &amp; as cōmō wealthes doe ſet ouer euery office a ſeuerall ruler: ſo alſo in ye care of ye publike health, ſome certaine magiſtrates muſt be ordeined, who both indeed &amp; name muſt be preſeruers, &amp; by their authoritie procure all matters of this treatiſe, &amp; yt in ſuch order as followeth.
               Firſt, they ſhall prouide ye cōmon wealth of  meet phiſitions, Chirurgeās, Apothecaries, who ſufficiently furniſhed with a blameleſſe life, &amp; ſkill of things, ſhall attend only vpon this ſicknes of ye plague, &amp; ſhal (ye Apothecarie excepted) altogether abſtain frō other diſeaſed perſōs &amp; diſeaſes. And as theſe are honeſtly &amp; courteouſly to be maintained with a reaſonable ſtipēd: ſo other runnagate ſtrangers as greedie cormorāts, gaping only for their pray, are to be baniſhed. For when as they are treacherous betraiers of the life of man, vnlearned, and deſperately bolde, they are eaſily inforced by Satā in this plight of things to any hainous offence: that whereas they ought to take away the infection, heere

being wicked perſons they perſwade themſelues to ſpread and increaſe the ſame.
               
                   Now after the common wealth ſhall bee prouided of phiſitions for the body (for this care in our treatiſe, wherin prouiſion is had for health, after the vniuerſall purging of our cōſcience, I iudge to be the chief &amp; firſt) likewiſe they muſt alſo make inquirie for Phiſitions of the ſoules, men approued in all points: if any (whiche thing I diſuade not but wiſh and exhort) will vſe their helpe, or inſtruction and comfort, which is done by words and ſpeech: or if the time ſo require, the receiuing &amp; partaking of the ſacramēts: Theſe alſo muſt abſtaine frō the companie of others, which are not viſited wt this ſickneſſe of the Plague.
               
                   They muſt cōmaund ſuch order to be obſerued, or kept among the citizens, that all publike aſſemblies bee auoided, as marriages, games, dauncings, bathes, common fayres, pompous funerals or burials. Churche aſſē
                  blies may be vſed, if they be deuided into diuers places, that they come not together in great heapes, and ſit cloſe one by another. Great ſchooles are to bee remoued into a place &amp; ayre more conuenient: leſſer ſcholes, and for children, are ſo long to be ſhut vp vntill the ſicknes ceaſe raging.
               
                  In thinges concerning meate and drink, to be bought and ſolde, this foreſight is to be followed, that it bee not lawfull neyther to ſell in the Citie, nor bring in what things ſoeuer are hurtfull, and may bring daunger of infection (and what are ſuch, wee haue ſeuerally ſet downe in the Treatiſe it ſelfe, as occaſion ſerued) but holſome and neceſſarye thinges are to be procured, and to bee ſolde, euery thing in his place, and at his appointed price. Manye markettes, and a reaſonable price for euerye thing muſte bee appoynted,Theo. Tabe. de peſt. ca. 8. according vnto the natures of the things and countryes, and abilitie of the buyars. Concerning which notwithſtanding it is not eaſie by certaine lawes to make prouiſo, or exactly enough to preſcribe, but only charitie muſt needs appoint the meaſure &amp; rule of this equitie.
               Kyne, Hogges, Geeſe, and other filthye  beaſtes, which doe make much ſtenche and vncleanneſſe, are not to bee ſuffered in the Citie, but there muſt bee made ſtables for them in ſome place out of the Citie, eſpecially by ſome Brooke, if it may be, which maye carry away all the filth, or from whence the vncleane reekes breath not into the Citie. Becauſe that their doung and excrementes

doth greatly defile the ayre, and yeeldeth noriſhment vnto the infection.
               
                   The ſtreetes alſo muſt be cleanſed of all filth, and nothing caſte in them eyther grieuous in ſmell, or abhominable in ſight: but what kinde of ſuch ſtuffe ſoeuer there is, it muſt bee caryed out of the Citie, that of the ſtreetes there bee not made common pryuies, as it were: naye, that the whole Citie ſeeme not as it were a certayne filthye Iakes, which in ſome Cities is moſt ſhamefullye ſuffered. Wherefore without the Citie in places conuenient there muſt houſes of office bee made at the charge of the common wealth, and that by a ryuer ſide, if there be any there, that ſuch excrementes may bee carryed away with the force of the water, or in ſome open place, that they may be dried vp with the winde.
               And heere the cuſtome of the Sarmations ſhall nothing moue vs, who in the time of the plague vſe to caſt dead Dogges euery where in the ſtreetes, to quench infection with infection. For this is barbarous, and peraduenture commodious onelye for that place. But wee muſt rather amend our ayre with ſweete thinges: and chiefelye by makinge euerye where great and

bright fiers and flames. For in a generall ſickeneſſe the purenes of the ayre is a chiefe remedie, as Hippocrates and Galen, and all auncient wiſe men doe witneſſe. And the fire dooth cleanſe, drye vppe and purifie all thinges, and is vnto the ayre, as it were the Sunne, ſoule, and lyfe:Pli. hiſt. nat. 56. cap. vlt. Inſomuch as looke what that notable preſeruatiue Triacle dooth vnto compound bodies, that dooth fire vnto the ayre, of all ſimple bodyes, as in place, ſo alſo in vertue the higheſt elemente:De var. rer. lib. 1.
                   the which let it be lawefull for me to ſpeak with the leaue of Cardanus, who denyeth the fire to bee an element. And it is very pretily ſayd,Le. Lem. de ocul. nat. mir. 3. 
                  By howe much the ayre is better, by ſo much the minde is better. For men for the moſt part are diſpoſed according vnto the qualitie of the ayre.
               Dogges alſo, Cattes, Goates, and other  tame beaſtes, which are woont to runne vp and downe, and euery where to wander in the ſtreetes, are not to be ſuffered, or at leaſt wiſe muſt be kept at home, for ſuch may cary about &amp; bring vnto others ye aire of ye plague, albeit they them ſelues many times remaine vnhurt: the which is manifeſt both by natural reaſon, and alſo hiſtories worthy credit.
               
                  Wherefore ſuche as cannot eaſilye bee kepte at home, as Cattes, it is better that they bee killed, then ſuffered, and in the roome of them, to vſe ginnes and mouſe trappes.
               
                   No ſtraungers, nor Citizens which come out of infected places, are to be receyued into the Citie, without a teſtimoniall of health. And ſuch teſtimonialles in papers ſealed or written, they muſte require of the Preſeruers: But if this order of our pollycie be not yet receiued in ſome places, they then muſt be craued at the handes of the magiſtrate or Miniſter. Such as haue none, muſt keepe them ſelues without the Citie a conuenient time of certaine daies. For there muſte greater care bee had for the publike health, then priuate wealth. That whiche I haue ſaid of ye mē, muſt alſo be vnderſtood of the thinges which they bring with them: as wares, packes, houſholde, &amp;c. For in theſe many tymes there doe lye great daungers. For the ayre of the plague may hange a long time in them, as it is moſt euidente concerning woollen garments. For wool is woont marueilouſly to nouriſh &amp; increaſe this infection. And it is knowne of many lewd perſons, whoe by this meanes haue

ſcattered the preſente ſickeneſſe farre and wide.
               Into whoſe houſes the Plague is lighted, they forthwith by the commaundement of the Preſeruers, ought to keepe thēſelues within, and muſt not haue leaue to go abrod, vnleſſe they goe noted with ſome eſpeciall marke, which ſhall pleaſe the Preſeruers: whereby notwithſtanding they ſhall not bee yet at libertie, to ſhuffle them ſelues into the companies of men, or to go into other mens houſes. The houſes alſo them ſelues muſt be noted with ſome markes, namelye by hanging before the doore a blacke, redde, or white ſheete: or ſetting vp of clubbes, or ſwathes of ſtraw, or torches vnlighted: al which are ſignes of ſickeneſſe or death. If any alſo of his owne accorde haue gone into ſuch houſes, in like manner hee ſhall not come abroad by the ſpace of 14. dayes, without ſome marke. The ſicke and thoſe of the houſe muſt prouide for them ſelues, the one by healing, and the other by preſeruing medicines: either vpō their own charges, which be able to beare it, or by the publike charges, which are poore. For Phiſicke is the gifte of GOD, and Phiſitions the Miniſters of God, by whoſe ſeruice the Lord many times

giueth health: albeit when hee wil, hee can doe it without them, which can do al things. But it is not lawfull to tempt him, neyther ought wee to aſke myracles, when as without miracles, wee maye obtaine the thinge which we require.
               Hereunto alſo appertaineth, that regard be had of women in trauell, which are not to be forſaken for feare of infection, but if they be ſuſpected, they are faithfully to be holpen, eſpecially of the midwiues &amp; other women, which by a publike ſtipend muſt be hired for this purpoſe.
               Two houſes, called Plague houſes muſt  be built, large inough, of ſound matter, ſituated towards the North, of an apt forme, in ſome out corner of the Citie, or rather without the Cittie by the running waters ſide: The one for the vſe of the hole, but yet ſuſpected, and the other for the ſicke: not ioyninge together, nor hindering one another in receiuing the North winde: with Chambers ſomewhat high, but not darkiſhe, with windowes open vnto the Eaſt. For the cloſe aire is very hurtfull, of the which there haue beene ſeene fearefull examples. And theſe thinges muſt bee looked vnto in the beginning of the ſicknes, when the number of the

infected is ſmaller. For in a great companie of ſicke perſons, and in an vniuerſall viſitation of the citie, theſe things wil ſcarſe be ſufficient, albeit al things be well obſerued.
               The Magiſtrate, when as the neceſſarye perſons and matters of the common wealth  be prouided for, may giue leaue vnto certain to go aſide, as vnto women, Children, tender perſons, and old men, and other vnprofitable folke, which can doe no good, but maye doe great harm, as it vſeth to be done in common burninges and firinges, or beſiegings of Cities: and he that ſhall then departe, is not to be condemned of reproch, or forſaking of brotherlye charitie. Otherwiſe it is lawefull for no man to flie, eſpecially if by famine, which is an other plague, he bee not driuen to ſeeke an other place.
               But if it be plaine by euident tokens, that this puniſhment is ſent immediately by god, without the negligence of men, and naturall cauſes, ſo farre of is it that wee ſhoulde flye awaye, that wee ought rather patiently to abide his fatherly correction, and humbly to pray for mitigation and ſlacking of the ſame. But euery plague cannot properlye be called the plague of God, but commeth ſometimes by nature, ſomtimes by our negligence

and raſhnes. In ſuch a caſe there is no doubt but that wee may deſire and followe al holſome counſailes and remedies.
               
                   If there dye any (which at that time is a daily thing) they ought neither too ſlowely, nor too haſtily to be carried forth and buried. For on both ſides there is daunger and incō
                  uenience. Wherefore a moderation and meane muſt be vſed. This ſhall be doone by ſuch as are thereunto eſpecially appoynted, as Burſars, Grauemakers, Cleanſers: who ought quietly and modeſtlye to execute this charge, folowing holy men in times paſte, and, that which is more, the Angels of God, who themſelues alſo ſometimes did this office. It muſt alſo be done without any companies of men: and if ſo be that any ſolemnitie muſt be vſed, the ſame muſt be finiſhed with as little comming together and charges as may be, leaſt ambition and pride may ſeeme to be ſought in death, and the old ſpittle of pompous funeralles or buryalles be licked vp againe.
               
                   The Church yarde, in which they are to be buryed, muſt be builded without the territories of the Citie, of a conuenient largnes, in a place neither lowe nor moyſt, towardes the North, of around figure, compaſſed with

a ſtone wall, with grates at the entry, and doores falling too of their own accord after they be opened, to keepe out cattel.
               After that the Corſe is carryed forth, the infected houſe, &amp; al thinges in it, are with ſingular diligence to bee cleanſed &amp; purged, ſetting open the windowes, to be perfumed with fire, and the walles to be whited with lyme. Thinges of no great value are to be burnt, others to be waſhed in lye. Laſtly, al things are to be ſtrowed with ſweet hearbs, flowers and fruites. And theſe things muſt be done by thoſe whom we haue named Ouerſeears about buryals, Cleanſers, &amp; Carryars forth to burying, or by thoſe of the houſhold, if they be there.
               
               All thoſe which are left aliue, muſt be by certaine lawes kept in, ſuch in manner, as hath beene ſayd of them houſhold ſeruantes, which haue beene with the ſicke. Thoſe therfore which ſhal be in health among thē, if they will go abroad, muſt, aſwell as they, carry a white rod in their hand.
               Thoſe which haue beene infected, and ſo ſo recouered, but yet not fully, maye not raſhlye goe abroad, vntill they bee throughlye cleanſed, vnto the which the ſpace of two moneths is requiſite at the leaſt. But ſuch as

indeede are nowe preſentlye ſicke of this diſeaſe, may in no caſe be found amongeſt the aſſemblies of men, as in the old teſtament it was not lawfull for the leprous to be in the company of the cleane.
               
                   Theſe orders euery one according to his abilitie and office, muſt indeuour diligently to obſerue, as moſt profitable and neceſſarye both priuatelye for him ſelfe, and for the whole ſocietie and fellowſhippe. He that of conſcience and religion ſhall be perſwaded to thinke that hee reſiſteth the wyll of God, if by the helpe of man hee labour to auoyde his puniſhment, hee muſt ſuffer him ſelfe to bee better taught, and not to laye a ſnare vpon his owne conſcience. But he that of ſlouthfulneſſe or waywardnes ſhall contemne the publike health, let him know, that he greatly hurteth charitie, and as it were ſinneth againſt his own body.
               
                   Laſt of all hee that ſhall bee founde ſlacke and vnfaythfull in his office, muſte bee puniſhed accordinge vnto the qualitie of his faulte: Which puniſhment the Preſeruers ſhal rule and ſette downe, eyther by ſome penaltie of money, or of reproach, or by ſuſpention, or depryuation from dignitie and offyce, or by impriſonmente, or by

the laſte punyſhmente of putting to death.
               And thus farre hath hytherto beene ſpoken of the duetie of a faythfull and wiſe Magiſtrate to be vſed in the time of the plague. Which if it ſhall ſeeme peraduenture newe vnto any man, albeit that in manye places it is not altogether vnuſuall: let him vnderſtande that wee goe about a newe woorke: Newe, I ſay, in ſome place perchaunce, or at leaſt wiſe in ſome parte newe, but yet notwithſtanding not vnprofitable, or not neceſſarye. And holſome counſayles are not therefore to bee deſpyſed,Al new thinges are not to be deſpiſed. beecauſe they are newe: For all thinges, which nowe are olde, and with reaſon long agoe ordayned, were once newe. Neyther doth it followe: this is newe, therefore it is to be refuſed. For is the hande of GOD ſhortned, ſo that in our times hee canne reueale nothing, which was not knowne of our forefathers? Do there not dayly come abroad new medicins, the vſe whereof beeing vnknowen vnto our Elders, hath beene with great fruite and profite knowen vnto vs?
               Wherefore they which iudge thus, that which is vnto anye man ſtraung and vnuſuall, the ſame by no meanes is to bee receiued and allowed: do tye the Magiſtrate vnto too

ſtreight bandes, to cutte away from him all libertie, to take aduice vpon moſt weighty matters, and ſuch as hee neuer before heard of: Far diſagreeing from the counſayle of that Prince in Homer, who (neceſſitie enforcing) ſaieth Hee that can better counſayle geue, who ſo hee bee, now let him come, for be he young, or be hee olde, moſte willingly the ſame I take.
               
               When as therefore there are ſome Rulars ouer al offyces of the common wealth, who eſpeciallye take charg of thoſe things, the dooinge whereof is committed vnto them, leaſte anye thinge ſhoulde bee doone amiſſe, or diſorderlye: I hope that wyſe Magiſtrates will heerein eaſily alſo agree, to receiue this neweneſſe into their common wealth. The whiche albeit it ſhall peraduenture ſeeme ſomewhat harde vnto ſuch as are not acquainted with it: yet by vſe it will waxe milde, and by the profite thereof make it ſelfe by litle and litle more commendable. But if quarrellars ſhall crye out, that I haue taken ſome thinges out of other Authours into this Treatiſe, I haue examples, by which examples I thinke it lawefull for mee to doe that, which they haue doone. Howe many thinges, naye

almoſt al things hath Terence taken into his Commedies out of Menander?Terence. And Virgil into his poeſie out of Homer, Cicero although of ſinguler wit &amp; eloquence,Virgill. nay the father of eloquence, was not aſhamed euery where out of the Greekes, to conueigh ſo many things into his writings, that hee may ſeeme rather the Tranſlator then Authour of ſome things. In the law, Phiſicke, Diuinitie, the new writers haue almoſt nothing, or very little, the which they haue not taken from the olde: out of whoſe bookes alſo they are not afraide to write out many thinges worde for worde, and to ſtuffe them in their workes for the maintenance of their cauſe, albeit ſometimes not without ſuſpition of falſhood. And theſe thinges they often do in the ſame matter which hath ſometimes beene handeled before by others: with how much more right I then who doe handle a matter not perhaps ſo verye newe, yet throughly &amp; as it were from point by point, ſet foorth hitherto by no man, that I knowe, if out of the workes of good Authours I haue fitted to my purpoſe ſuche thinges as ſeeme to ſerue the turne. It is no hanging matter, to take from others that whiche a man may profitably vſe without wronging

any body.Aeſops crow. It is the part of Aeſop his Crowe vnbeſittingly to garniſhe her ſelfe with the fethers of other byrdes not agreeing vnto her, and vainely to boaſt of the ſame: and it is the point of a wiſe man, from euery where to take, &amp; rightly to apply to his matter, ſuch things as are fit and profitable for the thing in hand. For it is a great prayſe diligently to ſearch the writings of our Elders: but a greater, faithfully to keepe the things found out: for they haue by their vertues opened the way of labour, and by theyr wiſedome left vnto vs the path of vnderſtanding.
               Now if many of the things which I here require ſhall ſeeme hard to be compaſſed, becauſe that ſome lacke wealth, ſome opportunitie, ſome wiſdome: yet is it not to bee diſalowed, yt the beſt rule be ſet down, according vnto the which, euery man ſo farr as he may, may order his matters. For ye example and pattern, according vnto ye which a thing ought to bee done, ought in euery point to bee moſt perfect,The moſt perfect way is in euery thing to be ſet downe, though it cannot be by others attained vnto. that the following of the ſame may be moſt commodious. For wheras in a manner nothing by following may bee ſo ſet out as that it bee made like to the firſt patterne, nay that it will not many wayes be thereunto inferiour, this ſhalbe a

great prayſe vnto the follower, yt in the next degree he come neere vnto that whiche hee hath purpoſed to follow. The Poet ſaith: Looke what wee can attaine vnto, ſome praiſe it is, though that we can performe no more: And of the wiſe men in the goſpell it is ſaide in a common verſe: They went ſo farre as they could goe, where that they coulde no further paſſe, there ſtoode they ſtill. I know it to be more eaſie to giue counſaile then to follow ye ſame: yet notwitſtanding the beſt counſaile is to be giuen. For if ſome thing bee wanting in the ſetting downe how a thing ſhould bee done, no doubt ſome thing will bee wanting in the action it ſelfe, that muſt according to that rule be performed. There was neuer ſuch an Oratour as Cicero and Quintilian do deſcribe vnto vs: Nor ſuch a Phiſition, as Galen requireth: nor ſuch a cōmon wealth as Plato ſhapeth, nor ſuch a Preacher, as Eraſmus painteth out: Nor finally ſuch a Church as Chriſt deſireth. Theſe, I ſay, albeit at no time they haue beene founde ſo perfect, as of thē they are perfectly portraitured, yet they thought good to ſet a moſte perfect patterne of them all before our eies, by the viewe whereof all our thoughts and

actions ſhould be gouerned. Which things ſith they are ſo, who can iuſtly finde faulte with mee, for that I require ſome thinges more exactly peraduenture then ſome common wealthes by following can bee able to performe? Wherefore thoſe whiche can pleade no other let but want of abilitie, wyll at leaſtwiſe take in good part that good and holſome counſaile, which commeth from a good heart: And concerning the reſt, muſte pray earneſtly with me vnto God the father, and Ieſus Chriſte his ſonne, the true turner away, and driuer backe of all euill, yt he will maintaine ſound in vs the gift of life, wc hee hath beſtowed vpō vs, &amp; preſerue or deliuer vs frō this infectiō of the plague, vnto the glory of his name, the amendement of our liues, and health of our ſoules: calling vpon him after this maner.
               
                  A Prayer.
                  O God in all aduerſitie
                  the onelie hope and ſtay,
                  Th'aſſured helpe and certayne ayde
                  of life of mine alway:
                  Vnmindfull of deſerued ire,
                  O Father helpe at neede,
                  
                     Spare and beholde of people thine
                  the teares which they doe ſheede.
                  Regarde vs for thy Chriſtes ſake,
                  with humble voyce wee craue:
                  And deale not with vs giltie ſoules,
                  as wee deſerue to haue.
                  Howe ſome time Dauid for his ſinne
                  committed, greeuous paine
                  Did ſuffer, holy ſcripture doth
                  report vnto vs plaine.
                  When ſeuen thouſande ten times tolde
                  (a miſerable ſight)
                  With rage of plague in three daies ſpace
                  did looſe this ioyfull light.
                  But when with teares hee did againe
                  his ſinne confeſſe and wayle,
                  Of frindly pardon at thy handes
                  foorthwith hee did not faile.
                  His wickedneſſe, and alſo guilt
                  of wickedneſſe committed,
                  Which vſeth to prouoke thy wrath,
                  was by and by remitted.
                  Wee alſo now haue made the like,
                  or greater farre offence,
                  To which of paine is likewiſe due
                  as iuſt a recompence.
                  But yet O God &amp; father deere
                  with humble ſuite wee pray,
                  
                     That vs moſt wretched wights,
                  in wrath ſo great thou wilt not pay.
                  Haue pitie Lorde on vs,
                  on vs that humblie ſue to thee:
                  And ſuffer not our prayers made,
                  in vaine or voide to bee.
                  Vnmindful of deſerued yre,
                  O father helpe at need,
                  Spare, and behold of people thine
                  the teares which they doe ſheede.
                  Beholde I pray for Chirſte his ſake,
                  in name of whom who vſe
                  All prayers vnto thee to make,
                  thou canneſt not refuſe.
                  To whom, as coeternall God
                  with thee, like laud and prayſe,
                  Like honour, equall glory,
                  renowme is due alwayes.
                  Amen.
