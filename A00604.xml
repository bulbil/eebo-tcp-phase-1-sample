            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

To one of you a Cardinals hat was sent indeed, but never came on the party his head, which was cut off by Henry the eight, to an other a Cardinals hat was given, but with so thinne lining, (I meane, meanes to support his estate) that he was commonly called the starveling Cardinal. The third was made professour of a pettie University, scarce so good as one of our free Schooles in England. The fourth, whose tongue was so full of adders poyson against his Soveraigne and Countrey, before he died felt his tongue cleaving to the roofe of his mouth, being starved to death in Ireland.

                  Euripides concerning his familiarity with Archelaus, that Hippo was better knowne by S. Austine then St. Austine by Hippo. Let it not seeme strange that men of meaner worth set the best leg forward, and outstrip their betters now adayes: when in the ancient and better times of the Church Damasus the schollar was advanced

to the first See, and Hieren ad Damasum papam epist. 143, 144, 145 146, &amp;c.
                   
                  Ieromie his Master (to whom even after he was Pope he expounded many difficult places of Scripture) ended his dayes in his Cell at Bethlem. And Gregorie Nazianzen the learnedest of all the Greeke fathers and surnamed the divine in the sharing of preferments in Capadocia could get but the poorest and most incommodious Bishopricke in all that province: about which he expostulates with Saint Basil. A rich stone is of no lesse worth when it is locked up in a Epist. 31. wicker kasket, then when 'tis set in a Bishops mytre. The wise Historian observed that the statues of Tacit: annal: eo praefulgebant quod non visebantur. 
                  Brutus and Cassius were the more glorious and illustrious, because they were not brought out with other Images in a solemne procession at the funerall of Germanicus. And in like manner men of excellent endowments when they are neglected in states, are by so much the more inwardly reverenced by how much they receive the lesse outward honour, and advancement. Cato was in the right who said he had rather men should question why he had no statue or monument erected unto him, then why he

had. For certainely men honour them more who aske why such and such men are not preferred, then they who enquire why such men are preferred, or what worth is in them correspondent to the titles they beare. But whats this to your either advancement or disesteeme in the See of Rome; Saint Cyprian teacheth us that if a man suffer death in an erroneous beliefe, being fallen away from the truth, his suffering is not corona fidei but paenaperfidiae, not a crowne of faith, but a punishment of his perfidiousnesse. It is just that they who wrong their native soyle should be disrespected in forraigne countries.

Where I was no sooner arrived, but I heard of divers English Priests resident there, who not onely set upon our English Gentlemen that travelled into those parts, and fixed some of them in the wrong, who before were unsetled in the right: but put the Embassadours Chaplaines also oftentimes to some trouble. These were D. Stanhurst, D. Wright, D. Bagshau, D. Stevens, D. Smith the elder, D. Champney, M. Reyner, M. Meridith, and others, with whom I declined all manner of contestation in point of Religion for a great while, not upon any distrust of the cause, neither any feare lest they should gaine upon the truth, or unsettle me or any other in any ground of our most Orthodoxe beliefe. For blessed be God, as in former times, so in our age we see the promise of our Saviour daily fulfilled in divers of the reformed Religion, who have beene See Acts and Monuments of the Church. Cri

is as a thorne in your eyes: yet your Chaplaine dares not pluck at it for feare of pricking his fingers: but under your relation, tanquam sub Ajacis clypio, under Ajax buckler hides himselfe presently after he hath flung a dart of Calumny at a Conference of mine signed and subscribed by two witnesses, both named by him, and acknowledged to be present at that disputation in Paris, Anno 1612.
            
            
               PAR. 6.
               
                  Of the novelty of Popery, and the true occasion of the Author his conference with D. Smith at Paris.
               
               AFter I have repelled his darts, I will encounter your relation, in both which the Greeke proverbe is verified, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , never a barrell better herring. In his Eras. Adag. introduction, from p. 3. to the 11. hee relates the occasion of this conference, partly defectively, partly injuriously and falsly.
               1. His narration is defective, in that

he relates, pa 8. That M. Knevet was put in minde that he was mistaken in the matter of Religion, and that before Luther, all knowne Churches did beleeve that which he saw there in France openly professed, but he omitteth what was replied thereunto, that this was a stale allegation confuted a 1000. times by Protestants, he omitteth also what was retorted (viz.) that no knowne Church in the world before the late Councell at Trent, which began in the yeare of our Lord, 1545. and ended in the yeare 1563. beleeved those 12. now articles added to the Apostles Creed,

                  by Pius 4. to be de fide and to be assented unto by all men under paine of damnation. That the Primitive Church worshipped no Images, knew no private masses, or halfe communions, or prayers in an unknowne tongue nor Church treasurie of superabundant satisfactions, nor Popes indulgences for the release of soules out of Purgatory, nor any of that drosse which he saw in your Church mingled with the gold of the Sanctuary: that a man would have beene laughed out of his skin, who would in those daies have given any credit to

that which he &amp; I both saw in Paris openly professed, and painted too, viz. Saint Denys holding his head in his hand, and our Ladie saying over the Rosarie with a great paire of beades about her necke, Saint Genoviefue Patronesse of Paris, carried in solemne procession about the streets, and publicke supplications made to her for raine, or the host carried in state in the streete under a Canopie, and the people kneeling before it in the dirt, or Christ eating the Paschall Lambe larded after the French fashion, or an Asse kneeling downe to the Sacrament, or Bees building a Chappell and the like legendarie fopperies.
               2. It is false and injurious in that he saith, p. 8. that I thought my selfe alone hard enough for the whole Church of Rome, and p. 10. that I presuming of victory made the matter knowne both to the English and to the French. Me thinkes you should have taught your Chaplaine better then to put his dreames in print for my thoughts, and to presume what were my presumptions, neither had I any such thought, 
                     •…
                  either presumed upon any such thing; for although I know my selfe to be ignorant

of many things which I ought to know: yet I dare boldly professe with Origen, Ignorantiam meam non ignoro, I am not ignorant of my ignorance, neither have I beene shie to make so much knowne to all men, in most of my disputations, using this premonition, that if the auditory should not be satisfied in my arguments or answers, that they ought to impute it to the weakenesse of the advocate, not of the cause, and this or the like conclusion, that if they heard any thing that gave them contentment, they were to ascribe it to the goodnesse of the cause which I maintained, which will bee able to defend it selfe not onely against the Popes chaire but also against hell gates.
               
               But I need not wipe off the aspersion of selfe confidence cast upon me, p. 10. he himselfe doth it, p. 12. saying that I called M. Moulines a famous French Preacher to the Conference, whereas it was appointed, that the Conference should bee betwixt us two onely. If I thought my selfe hard enough for the whole Church of Rome, what need I call in Peter Moulines to assist me, against one Doctor onely of the Church

of Rome? Here certainely your Lordships Chaplaine was forgetfull of speciall precept in his art, oportet mendacem esse memorem, he that will v

                  Of the Conditions of this Conference, and how they were kept on both sides.
               
               HAving done with your servant for the present, and given him his arrant, I come now to conferre with your selfe, or rather to heare your reference and rehearsall of our Conference, two and twenty yeares agoe, September 4. Whereof I may truly say, as Scaliger doth of Baronius his Annals, (facit annales non scribit) he makes Annals or Chronicles, he writes them not: so verily you rather make a new Conference betwixt me and you, then relate the old. For you devise conditions,

                  cast my arguments into a new mould, piece out your owne answers, invert the order, and fairely dissemble those replies that touched you to the quicke, wherefore I intreat the Reader to take notice that the Protestant relation of the Conference printed 1630. was taken out of the authenticall notes of both parties, and confirmed and subscribed by two that were present at the disputation, and confessed to have beene so by your selfe, p. 9. but this narration of yours is penned by your selfe, and published 2
                     •…
                  . yeares after, and hath no attestation at all unto it. Yet because you shall know that I am ready to answer, not onely to all that you did then say, but to all that you can say in the propounded question, I will trace you, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and where you stumble helpe you up.
               First, you charge me with the breach of I know not what condition, by making the Conference more publike then it should have beene. The two noters make mention but of three conditions or lawes made by the company, and assented unto by us before wee exchanged any word, which were

these. 1. That wee should dispute calmely and peaceably. 2. That all impertinent discourses should bee avoided. 3. That M. Featly at this time should onely oppose, and D. Smith onely answer. The fourth law which you mention concerning the private carriage of this Conference was so privately enacted, that I never heard of it till now, the other three I kept punctually through the whole Conference, but you violated, at the first entrance you had scarce spoken three words before you transgressed the third law, whereat I tooke exception and offence, not because I was affrighted at the very sight of your tenets, as your Chaplaine S. E. would scare his simple Reader, though your Transubstantiation be an ougly Monster, nor for that I was netled at the proposall of your objections against our tenet: for they were but blind nettles, as wee terme them, that sting not at all; but partly because I could little hope for any faire proceedings from him, who stumbled at the threshold, and brake his owne promise before he infringed any argument of mine, partly and especially,

because you brandished your sword furiously against me, when you knew I was engaged by promise, and bound by the law at that time not to use my Buckler. I saw my condition like his in Floresta Hispan: l. fac

                  Floresta, who seeing a dog run at him, and stooping downe to take up a stone to fling at him, and finding it so fast in the ground that hee could not moove it, cryed out, A vengeance on this countrie where dogges are let loose and stones are tied. Your tiphenie wherewith you cover this skarre in your reputation from the custome of Oxford (for the respondent to confirme his Thesis) is too transparent and netlike. For what was the custome of Oxford in this kinde to us in Paris, who had by joynt consent set downe an other order to be held in this disputation? Neither did you (si meminisse jnvat) at that time insist upon any such Oxford custome, nor intimated so much, that you tooke any degrees of Schooles there: for then I should in the first place have charged you with the Articles of Religion you subscribed unto, and the oathes you tooke at your presentation: to all

                   fame that your name rung before this in England, France and Spaine, insomuch, that as you your selfe reported M. Knevet said of me that I was to young to deale with you. Secondly of bookes, for I brought but a few with me to Paris, nor had accesse (being knowne an opposite to your Religion) to any of your Libraries. Whereas

you besides your owne, had the command of the Librarie of Sorbone, and others in the City and University. Thirdly of assistance, for I was alone and had none to advise withall: you conversed daily with the Sorbone Doctors of your society, the acutest disputants of this age. Yet whatsoever garland now your Chaplaine platteth for you, at that time you were farre from triumphing. For you doubted your owne answers, and like beares whelpes often licked them to bring them to some forme, and when at the end of the Conference I had read them all unto you written from your owne mouth; a friend of yours snatched the paper away, and never would 
                     〈◊〉
                   ver it, but in liew thereof you tendered me a paper of answers written with your owne hand, with such additions and limitations, as your after thoughts suggested: in which notwithstanding fairely you yeelded the cause, saying, ego agnosco quod in his verbis, hoc est corpus meum, est figura: that is, I acknowledge that there is a figure in these words, or that these words are to be taken figuratively. If so, then they make

no more for the Transubstantiation of Bread into Christs Body, then the like figurative words, I am the doore, I am the vine, I am the way, make for the Transubstantiation of Christs Body or person into a vine doore or way. Wherefore I cannot but commend your ingenuity in choosing that sentence of Saint Austine for your posie in the frontispice of your relation, facile est ut quis

                      Augustinum vincat, quanto magis ut vicisse videatur, aut si non videatur, vicisse dicatur, it is an easie thing to get the better of Austin, how much more to seeme to get the better, or if not to seeme yet to be so reported, if you neither had the worse, nor seemed to have, nor were reported to have the worst in this Conference, how doth this posie fit your relation, but if either, indeed you were foyled, or in apparance, or at least in report, discordant ultima primis, the first words agree not with the last, that you got the field, and bare away the prize.
               
            
            
               
               PAR. 8.
               
                  The state of the question is truly set downe, five points wherein wee differ touching the Reall presence are touched.
               
               THe praeludium is past concerning the occasion and conditions: I come now to the encounter it selfe concerning your Reall presence by Transubstantiation. For which those of your Church contend, tanquam pro aris &amp; focis, and well may you so doe, for it furnisheth your ara and your focus too. Iustitut. l. 4. c. 17. quia Satan haue exposit

                  Calvin truely observeth that Satan by his instruments laboureth nothing more then to suppresse the truth in this point of controversie: and in regard of the infinite Volumes written on both sides. Chamierus de Euch. l 10. c. 1. quaestio de reali praesentia est animosissima, prolixissima, intricatissima sed &amp; nobilissima. 
                  Chamerus rightly tearmeth it the most intricate and perplexed, as also the most noble question of all other betweene the Romane and

                  Reformed Catholike 10. point. p. 590. 
                  Perkins is as full: we hold and beleeve a presence of Christs Body and Blood in the Sacrament and that no feigned but a true and reall presence.

                  Andrew Rivet saith peremptorily, none of us beleeveth that Christ giveth unto us onely a signe of his Body, or onely grace, because as truly as the Bread which is the signe of Christs body is given to our bodies so truly is the Body of Christ given unto our soules.
               
               The difference betweene us is about
               
                  1. The meanes.
                  2. The meaning of eating Christ.
               
               
                  The meanes

                        We say is by faith 
                              Artic. 28. Onely after a heavenly and spirituall manner the body of Christ is received, and the meanes whereby it is taken in the Supper, is faith. mystically,

                  The meaning

                        You say is a carnall.
                        We say is a spirituall manducation.
                     
                  
               
               Desire you a greater light, because it seemes your eyes are dim: thus then conceive of the doctrine of the reformed

Churches
               1. Christ is said to be present in holy Scriptures foure manner of waies.
               
                  1. Divinely.
                  2. Spiritually.
                  3. Sacramentally.
                  4. Carnally or corporally.
               
               According to the first kind or manner, he is present in all 
                     Ier. 23. 24. Psal. 139. 7. Whether shall I slie from thy presence? &amp; Amos 9. 2, 3. places, Can any man hide himselfe in secret places that I shall not see him, saith the Lord, doe not I fill heaven and earth.
               
               According to the second, he is present in the hearts of true Ephes 3. 17. beleevers, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.
               
               According to the third, he is present in the Sacrament both mystically or relatively, and 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17. effectually also. The cup of blessing which we blesse, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? the bread that we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread and one body: for wee are all partakers of that one bread.
               
               According to the fourth, he was present Iohn 1

               2. As the word presence, so also the word really is diversly taken, sometimes
               
                  1. As it is opposed to that which is feigned and imaginarie, and importeth as much as truly.
                  
                  2. As it is opposed to that which is meerely figurative and barely representative, and importeth as much as effectually.
                  3. As it is opposed to that which is spirituall, and importeth as much as corporally or materially.
               
               
                  Conclusion the first.
               
               1. We beleeve Christ to be present divinely, and that after a speciall manner at his table, spiritually in the hearts of the Communicants, Sacramentally in the elements: but not corporally, either with them by Consubstantiation, or in the Ame

                  Noris compareth the Protestants Supper to Heliogabalus his feasts: he should rather have compared your private Masses to them. For as that Emperour invited his servants to a banquet, where he ate all himselfe, and they onely looked on: so you invite the people to your Masse and bid them eate and drinke, rehearsing the words of our Saviour (Take eate, this is my body, and drinke you all of this, &amp;c.) yet you eate all and drinke all your selves. As the Priests under the Law among the Jewes had their panes propositionis, their show-bread, which the people

To yeeld that to any creature is Idolatrie.
               Fourthly, You averre that Christs very body is eaten with the mouth: we

               Fiftly, You professe (and I know not whether you beleeve it) that infidels, yea some of you also, that rats and mice may eate Christs very body: we abhorre that blasphemy. For though it might fall out through some negligence that a rat or a mouse, or who is worse then either, an Insidell may somtimes seize on the Sacramentall bread: yet we say Christs Body and Blood are out of their reach, their unhallowed hands or mouthes cannot come neare it.

For divine faith must bee built upon a divine and unmooveable foundation, which can bee no other then Gods Word. And sith we on both sides acknowledge that the Church in which the Primitive Fathers lived and died, was the true Church, they who gaine-say the faith thereof, are to be ranged with hereticks. Lastly, that metaphysicall principle is of undoubted verity, verum vero non opponitur, truth never opposeth truth. That

doctrine therefore which destroyeth the principles of reason, and quencheth the sparkles of divine light kindled in our soules by God, cannot but bee from the Prince of darknesse.
               
               The Minor or assumption hath three branches as you see on the first: whereof I insisted in that conference. My prosyllogismes which you and S. E. both omit were these. First, if there bee any ground in Scripture for your carnal presence in the Sacrament, it is either in the words of 
                        Mat. 
                              〈◊〉

For upon these both the Bishops in that Lateran, and Trent Councell, and all the learned on your side build their faith especially in this point. But neither the one nor the other Text are any sure ground for it, Ergo you have none. The Major in this prosyllogisme being assented unto by you, I proceeded to the confirmation of the Minor in this wise. If the words of institution, Mat. 26. and the other alledged out of Iohn the 6. are to be taken figuratively, and not in the

proper sense nothing can be concluded from them for the bodily presence or carnall eating Christ with the mouth. But the words above alleadged in both places are to be construed figuratively, and not in the proper sense, Ergo nothing can bee concluded from them for the bodily p

                     esence of Christ in the Sacrament, or carnall eating of him with the mouth. The Major in this second Syllogisme being likewise evident to all men of learning, who know that to argue from a figurative sense to the proper is a fallacy in Logick, and a dangerous errour in Divinity: against which Saint Aust. l. 31 de doct. christ c. 5.

                  Tertullian in his fourth book against Martion, the 40. Chapter, the bread taken and distributed to his Disciples hee made his body saying, this is my body, that is a

figure of my body. Now a figure it had not or should not have beene, unlesse his body had beene a body of truth or a true body, for avoid or empty thing, such as a phantasme is, is not capable of a reall figure. Tertullian his argument in this 40. Chap. against Marcion, who taught that Christ had no true body but an imaginarie or phantasticall standeth thus.
               
                  That body whereof bread is a figure must needs bee a true body.
                  But the Body of Christ is such a Body whereof bread is a figure, Christ himselfe sa

               If Christ made not bread a figure of his Body, but turned it into his own Body, as you teach, how could Tertullian out of those words of our Saviour, prove against Marcion that bread was a figure of Christs Body? Againe, if the meaning of the words of institution (This is my Body) be, this bread is a figure of my Body as Tertullians id est inforceth, then are the words of the

institution metonymically or figuratively to be taken. A faire evidence for the truth is this testimony of Tertullian which so puzzels our adversaries, th

                  Steven Gardiner giveth a more respective answer, that Tertullian spake these words,

Secondly out of the words hee made bread his owne body, since say you Tertullian saith, that our Saviour taking bread made it his body, he was not so forgetfull as immediately to add that the Eucharist is a meere figure of his body: this reason you backed with a third, that Tertullian presently after the foresaid words saith, figura autem non fuisset, it had not beene a figure, &amp;c. by which words he shewes that he speaketh of the figure which was before our Saviour said, This is my Body. Lastly, you much insisted upon the words veterem figuram, an old figure, and those that follow in the same place, but why calleth hee bread his body? and not a Pepon or Melone rather? which Marcion had

Bread he prooves to be the figure of his body, both out of the Gospell of Saint Matthew in the first place, and afterwards out of the Prophecy of Ieremy, where the Jewes conspiring against the Prophet, said, Come let us cast wood on his bread, that is, the crosse on his body. The illightner therefore of antiquities declared sufficiently what hee would have bread then to signifie, calling his body bread. Marke I beseech you, Tertullian sets the Texts of Matthew and Ieremy like glasses, to cast a mutuall light one upon the other. In Ieremy Christs Body is called bread, in Saint Matthew, bread is called his Body, both by a like figure:

but I subsume Christs body is not called bread in Ieremy, because it was transsubstantiated into bread as you must needs confesse, therefore neither in Saint Matthew is bread called Christs body, because bread was transubstantiated into it. In Dialogo 1.

There is in this passage I grant a Metathesis or transposition of the words, id est unctus, which should have beene placed before mortuus not after: but yet that place of Tertullian is not like Sol 1. this as you interpret it: for there id est must of necessity be referred to the subject Christus, and cannot be referred to the predicate mortuus: because the word mortuus doth not signifie annointed, as Christus doth: but in this place id est may well be referred to the predicatum corpus, as Art 13.

                  Ruardus Tapperus, and Gardinerus, and Renanus, and all other Papists referred them, before this new crochet was found out by Pammelius, or Peron. Againe, in those words Christ 
                  Sol 2. 
                  is dead that is annointed, the sense is made good by a meere inversion thus, Christ that is the annointed is dead, wheras besides an inversion you add the words quod erat vetus: (non nunc est) which

words if you should add to the other place, saying Christus mortuus est, id est is qui erat unctus est mortuus, you would make the speech blasphemous, insinuating that Christ was the Lords annointed but is not, as you make Tertullian say bread which was a legall figure, but now is not, is Christs body.
               But to put this passage of Tertullian 
                  Sol. 3. out of all peradventure, the words (id est) that is to say, must needs be referred to that tearme in the proposition which was obscure, and needed some explication. But that was not the subject (hoc) for Christ by taking the bread in his hand and pointing to it sufficiently, shewed what he meant by (hoc) all the doubt that could be made was of the predicate body, what that tearme signified, or in what sort it agreed to the subject (hoc) the id est therefore of necessity is to be applied to the obscure predicate (corpus) not to the subject (hoc) which was then when Christ uttered those words evident ad oculum.
               
               Your second objection melteth of it selfe, since Tertullian (say you) affirmes Object. 2 that our Saviour made bread his body, hee was not so forgetfull as immediatly

to add, that the Eucharist is a meere figure of his body: neither doe wee Sol. 1. say so, as I have proved at large in the former Paragraph. It was not forgetfullnesse in Tertullian to add this glosse, Sol. 2. 
                  id est figura corporis mei, but mindfullnesse and cautelous wisdome maturely to remove a block, at which his Reader was like to stumble. When he had said before corpus suum ipsum fecit, he made bread his body, a man might have thought that he did it so by Consubstantiation, or by Transubstantiation: to prevent which mistakes, hee adds that Christ did it by Sacramentall consecration, saying, This is my Body, that is, a figure of my body.
               
               Your third objection is an idle criticisme, Object. 3 as if there were great difference betweene esset and fuisset, for your Candor, looke but upon Lillie his grammar, Sol. 1. and you shall finde that eram and fueram, and ero and fuero, and essem and fuissem are indifferently used as Synonima. Yet if you will have (fuisset) in Sol. 2. these words (figura autem non fuisset) not to be rationall, but temporall, nor to construed it should not be, but it had not beene, you must howsoever referre

it to that which goeth before, acceptum panem &amp; distributum, not to that which followes sixe lines after, veterem figuram corporis Christi dicentis per Ieremiam, the apparent sence then is, Christ by saying This is my body, made the bread then a figure, or Sacrament of his body, which it had not beene if he had not then, when he spake so, a true body, but onely an imagnarie, as the phantasticall hereticke Marcion surmised.
               Your fourth &amp; fift reasons are answered Resp. ad 4. &amp; 5. Object. already. Tertullian as it is evidently deduced from the passage you cote, and another paralell unto it, l. 3. cont. Marcion. c. 19. (So God hath revealed in the Gospell, calling bread his body, that hence now thou maist understand, that he hath given the figure of bread to his body, whose body the Prophet long before figured in bread) taught that bread had beene a legall figure, and was also an evangelicall signe or Sacrament of Christs Body. But why Christ made choice rather of bread then of a Melone, as Tertullian speaketh, or any other solid thing to be the Symbole or Sacrament of his body, as also why hee rather chose

wine then any other licour to bee the embleme and memoriall of his blood, we can assigne certainely no other reason then his meere will. Tertullian his guesse is but probable, that Christ in the institution of the Sacrament in the formes of bread and wine had an eye to the Prophecy of Ieremy, or Iacob. But I

expound these words according to the rule of the Fathers, the signes have usually the names of the thing signified, by them then hee confirmes our figurative interpretation, understanding by the body of Christ the Symbole or signe thereof, upon which our flesh seeds, when we receive the Sacrament: but if he understand the words of Tertullian properly as if our very flesh or stomach turned Christs Body into corporal nourishment, and so really fed upon it to fatten or cheare our soules, he makes Tertullian blaspheme, and hee gives the lie to his Lord your selfe who page 65. in expresse tearmes affirme, that in the Fucharist there is no violence offered to Christ his flesh in it selfe, nor is it eaten to the end our bodies may thereby be nourished. To affirme that the substance of our mortall body is nourished, or increased by the flesh of Christ taken in the Sacrament, is to make the Eucharist cibum ventris non mentis, the foode of the belly, not of the soule, then which grosse conceit nothing can bee more absurd in the judgement of your owne Cardinall Bellar l. 2. de Sacra Eucharist. c. 4. Non intelligunt patres cum hoc dicunt Eucharistiâ nutriri vel augeri mortalem substantiam corporis nostri, sic enim facerent Eucharistiam cibum ventru non mentis, quo nihil absurdius fingi potest. 
                  Bellarmine. Tertullian disclaimes this

carnall fancy in the very words alledged by your Chaplaine, ut anima saginetur, the flesh saith the Father feeds on the Body and Blood of Christ, that the soule may bee fatted, the soule not the body. If hee demand how can the soule bee satisfied or fatted by the bread in the Sacrament, if it bee not turned into Christs Body? I answer out of the former words of Tertullian, even as the soule is cleansed in Baptisme by washing the body with water, though that water be not turned into Christs blood.

                  Tertullian, You must not question the truth of your senses, lest thereby you weaken the sinewes of our faith, lest peradventure the heretickes take advantage thereupon, to say that it was not true that Christ saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven, that it is not true that he heard a voice from heaven, but the sense was deceived. Were not the senses competent judges of their proper objects, even in the case we are now putting, viz. the discerning Christs true body; Christ would never have Luke 24. 39. appealed to them as hee doth. Behold my hands and my feet, that is, I my selfe, handle me and see, for a Spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see me have.

                  Marcion, So God revealed in your Gospell, calling bread his body. And againe, why doth hee call bread his body, &amp;c. But I assume bread cannot be Christs body in the proper sense; because disperate substances cannot properly bee predicated one of the other, therefore when Christ spake these words, This is my Body, which Tertullian constantly and perpetually silleth up thus, this bread is my body, he used a Metonymie, called signatum pro signo, or figuratum pro figura, which quite overthroweth your carnall presence, and beateth you out

of your strongest fort, the words of Christs holy institution which you would have to be taken according to the letter. Thus you see Tertullian is clearely against you, and you are foyled in the first argument.
            
            
               PAR. 10.
               
                  Thirty three allegations out of S. Austin against Transubstantiation vindicated, and all objections made by the adversarie out of him answered.
               
               SO are you also in the second which you propound amisse. Saint Austin in his third booke, de doctrina Christiana saith that speech of our Saviour, unlesse you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, Iohn the 6. &amp;c. is figurative, therfore the other, this is my body, is so too, Quem recitas meus est o Fidentine libellus Sed malè dum recitas incipit esse tuus. The argument was mine, but by your mis-reporting it and mis-applying the consequent to the antecedent, you make it yours. Thus I connected this

argument to the former: there are two Texts in the Gospell, upon which you relie, either principally, or onely for your carnall presence of Christs body in the Sacrament under the formes of bread and wine. The former, Mat. 26. 26. I have proved out of Tertullian, yeelds your doctrine no support, and you are driven in effect to confesse as much, subscribing with your owne hand, Ego agnosco quod in his verbis (hoc est corpus meum) est figura, I acknowledge the words of Institution to be figurative. Now I will prove that in like manner the words of our Saviour, Iohn 6. 53. are to be taken in a figurative and improper sense, and consequently that the proper eating Christs flesh with the mouth, cannot be inferred from them.
               
               For proofe of the antecedent, I produced in the first place a passage out of Saint Si autem flagitium

                  Austins third booke, de doctrinâ

Christianâ, cap. 16. But if that Scripture seeme to command a sinne, or an horrible wickednesse, or to forbid any thing that is good and profitable, the speech is figurative: for example, (when he saith) unlesse ye eate the flesh of the Sonne of man and drinke his blood, ye have no life in you, he seemeth to command a sinne or horrible wickednesse; there is a figure therefore (in the words) commanding us to communicate with the Lord his Passion, and sweetly &amp; profitably to lay it up in our memory, That his flesh was crucified and wounded for us. Here said I three things are very remarkeable to the point now in question.
               1. That Saint Austin maketh choice of these words of our Saviour, as of a most knowne instance of a figurative speech.
               2. That he not onely affirmeth it to be a figurative speech, but confirmeth it also by a strong argument, figura est, Ergo it is therefore a figure.
               3. That he sheweth what figure it is, end expoundeth the meaning of our Saviour in this figurative speech, conformably to the doctrine of the Protestants, and contrarie to all Romish glosses upon it.
               
                  
To this allegation you answered, partly by glancing at Saint Austins argument, partly by glossing upon his conlusion. First said you, it is not a horrible thing to eate mans flesh, unlesse it be eaten in the proper shape, for it appeares in Mumme that mans flesh may be eaten without horrour, when it is not eaten in the proper shape. Secondly, you distinguished of a figurative speech according to the thing eaten, and according to the manner of eating it, and said that the speech of Christ, Iohn 6. according to Saint Austin was figurative, according to the manner of eating, to wit in the proper forme, but that it was proper according to the matter (viz.) the substance of Christs flesh.
               
               1. Against your first answer to Saint Austins antecedent, I replie.

                     1. That whereas you pretend Saint Austin to bee for you, you should not have disabled his argument, but have defended it rather. Now you evidently overthrow it. For if it be not a horrible thing to eate mans flesh, though under an

other shape, Saint Austins Ergo therefore, our Saviours speech concerning eating his flesh must needs be figurative, is a plaine non sequitur.
                     
                     2. Saint Cyril ad obiect. Theod. in expos. a
                              •…
                           ath 11. Num hominis comeftionem hoc Sacramentum pronuncias? 
                        Cyril maketh good this argument of Saint Austins, choaking his adversarie with this interrogatorie. Dost thou pronounce the Sacrament to be a man eating, and dost thou irreligiously urge the mindes of the faithfull to grosse and carnall imaginations? You would have instructed Saint Cyril to have interrogated more warily, dost thou pronounce the Sacrament to be the eating of a man in his proper shape? Otherwise to eate a man under an other shape (you would have whispered him in the eare) is a schoole delicacie, no carnall and grosse imagination.
                     
                     3. I affirme that it is an horrible

thing to eate mans flesh, and drinke his blood though in an other shape; for it is not the disregard of the countenance of man, or the disfiguring his shape, which makes Anthropophagie or man eating so horrible a sinne: but the making the flesh of one man the food of another, and the belly a sepulcher. This I make appeare by foure instances.
                     1. Suppose at Rome or Venice on the day of your carnivals, when many murthers are committed by men in disguised habits, that one of the masquers or mummers slaine, should be boyled or rosted, and served in at table, in the habit of a whiffler, or masquer, were it not a horrible wickednesse think you to eate of this mans flesh, his head for example though with a vizard

upon it, and so I returne you a mummer for your mumme.
                     
                     2. If according to Iustins storie, or Ovids fiction, the members of a sonne were baked in a pie, in the likenesse of venison, with the proportion of a Deere printed on the crust, were it not a horrible wickednesse for a Father to eate wittingly of his sonnes flesh, though under another shape.
                     
                     3. What though a mans body in some fight were so mangled, and battered, that it had lost all humane shape, would you warrant an Indian to eate this mans flesh, or excuse him from an horrible crime if he should eate it, because it was not in propriâ specie?
                     
                     4. Did you live among the Lycanthropie, men in the shape of wolves, or meete with witches who

delude the senses, and take upon them the shape of a pig, or cunny, or goate, would you preach it for good doctrine, that a man might eate wittingly the flesh of any of these while it remained sub alienâ specie. As,
                     For the argument you take not from any topick place, but from the Apothecaries shop, I meane your instance in Mumme, I wish you some better drug of theirs, I meane some strong confection of Helleborum to purge your braine. For our question is not of the medicinall use of mans flesh, altered by art, but whether it be not a finne, and that a horrible one, to eate with the mouth and teeth the flesh of a knowne man, nay of the Sonne of God.
                  
               
               2. Against your second answer to Saint Austins conclusion, I replied

                     
                     1. That Saint Austin by figura, meant such a figure as excludes the native and proper sense of the words. His words are immediatly going before those I cited, si autem hoc jam propriè sonat nulla putetur figurata locutio, if it bee taken in the proper sense let it bee accounted no figure.
                     
                     2. Saint Austin speakes of such a speech which can in no wise be taken properly, such a speech, to wit, where a vertue is forbidden, or a vice commanded, and in this very Chapter he instanceth in Romanes the 12. 20. Thou shalt heape coales of fire upon thine enemies head. In which words, because the Apostle seemed to command an evill act, Saint Austin inferres, ne igitur dubitaveris figuratè dictum, Doubt not therefore but that it is

spoken by a figure. If a speech commanding a sin, or forbidding a vertue, might be taken in the proper sense, hence it would follow, that it should bee lawfull to sinne, because expressely commanded by God, and sinnefull to exercise some act of piety, or charity because forbidden by him. And here your Lordship touched the second time at Hercules Columna Non plus.
                     
                     3. Whereas you say that Saint Austin by sigura meant a figure mixt of a sigurative and proper speech, dato &amp; non concesso, supposing for a while that there might be such a figure; I desire you to observe that Saint Austin speakes here of no such figure, but of a speech meerely figurative. For he declares that the meaning of the figure is, that wee ought to partake

of Christs sufferings, and remember his 
                        Figura praecipiens Passioni Domini esse cō
                           municandū &amp; suaviter ae utiliter recondendū in memoriâ quod pro nobis caro cius crucifixa &amp; vulnerata sit. 
                        death. Now to compassionate Christ, or to partake with him in his sufferings, or remember his death, is not to eate his flesh in any proper sense at all.
                     4. Of one simple categoricall proposition, there can bee but one true sense. And this sense cannot be figurative and proper, but either the one, or the other for proper and figurative are proper and improper, borrowed and not borrowed, which cannot bee affirmed de eodem.
                     
                  
               
               I conclude with Saint Austin l. 3 do doc. Christ. c. 5. In principio cavendum est ne figuratam locutionem ad literam accipias, ad hoc enim pertiue
                        •…
                      quod ait Apostolus, litera occidit spiritus autē vivificat. Cum enim figuratè dictum sit accipitur tanquam propriè dictum sit, carnaliter sapitur, neque ulla mors animae congruemiùs appellatur. 
                  Austin his owne words. The first thing that you must beware is this, that you take not a figurative speech according to the letter, to that belongeth the Apostles admonition, the letter killeth, the spirit quickneth. For when we take that which is flguratively spoken as if it were proporly spoken, it is a carnall sense, neither is any thing more rightly tearmed

the death of the soule then it.
               
               Here S. E. puts a great deale of varnish upon a rotten post, he tells us of a mingled colour, and a garment of motley, and distinguisheth of a meere figure, and of a figure which hath the truth joyned with it; in fine he alleadgeth what Tapper, and Allen, Suarez, Gordon, and Pittigarus have confessed upon the racke of our arguments concerning a figure in the words of the institution.
               But one sad shower of raine will wash away all this his varnish.
               
               1. To his demand, Why not a mixt figure, as well as a mixt colour. I answer, because the opposition betwixt colours is inter contrarios terminos, contrarie tearmes which admit a medium, but the opposition betweene figurative and proper, is betweene contradictorie tearmes which admit of no medium. Wherefore although there may bee a mixt colour of white and blacke, and a mixt temper of hot and cold, and a mixt sawce of sweete and sower, and a twilight betweene day and night, because these are mediate contraries: yet there cannot be a mixt

element, or a mixt truth, or a mixt figure; because simple and compound, true and false, proper and figurative (that is improper) stand upon flat tearmes of contradiction.
               2. His distinction of a figure which is a meere figure, and of a figure which is not a meere figure but hath the verity joyned with it, wherewith hee goes about to soder the bracks and flawes in your leaden discourse, is altogether impertinent. For the question betweene me and you, was of tropes, not of types, of verball figures, not reall: of rhetoricall, such as Metaphors and Metonymies and the like are, not of physicall or naturall figures, if speech be of the latter kinde of figures, I denie not but that such a difference among them may be observed. Some of them are meere figures and representations, as Philips picture or image, some are more, as Alexander, Philip his sonne. Sacraments are according to this acception of figures, not meere figures, nor bare signes, as is shewed at large in the former Paragraph, for they doe not onely signifie, but also really exhibit, and are

effectuall meanes to conveigh unto us those spirituall blessings and graces whereof they are signes and symbols. But if the speech bee of figures in words or sentences, such as all grammaticall and rhetoricall figures are, I say that all such figures are meere figures, every Metaphor is a meere Metaphor, every Metonomie a meere Metonomie, every Allegorie a meere Allegorie, every Ironie a meere Ironie, every Solaecisme a meere Solaecisme, neither can any instance bee given to the contrary.
               But because S. E. hath felt M. Waferer his feriler for his errour in Rhetoricke, I leave him to con better his Susenbrotus, and I returne to your Lordship, who perswade your selfe that Saint Austin favoureth your carnall presence, because hee saith, Wee receive with faithfull heart

With this one brush reached unto me by Saint Austin, I

might whiten all the walls you point unto: yet partly out of respect to your selfe, but especially to S. Austin, I will take speciall notice of every place and passage above mentioned.
               Your first allegation is like a leaden Rep. ad 1. sword, it boweth either way; for as you bow it towards you by urging that Saint Austin must needs speake of corporall and proper eating, because he addeth the words with the mouth: so I may as easily bow it the contrarie way by arguing that he must needs speake of spirituall eating, because he addeth with a faithfull heart. As the mouth cannot receive Christ spiritually, so neither can the heart receive Christ corporally. Saint Austin therefore as hee speakes there of a double organ, the heart and the mouth'; so he speaketh also of a double eating, Spiritually and Sacramentally, and the meaning of the whole sentence is this, we receive with a faithfull heart spiritually, and with the mouth Sacramentally, the Body and Blood of the Mediator betwixt God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus.
               Your second allegation is like Sir Rep. ad

                  Philip Sidneys emblem which was the word hope, written in large golden characters, but dasht through with a pen. When Saint Austin uttered these words, a man may be carried in another mans hands, but no man is carried in his

                  own hands: we finde not how it can be understood of David, but we finde how it may bee understood of Christ, for hee carried his Body in his owne hands, when he said, This is my body: hee gave you great hope that he was strong for your carnall presence, but when Convio. 2. in Psal. 33. Accepit in manus suas quod norunt fideles, &amp; ipse se portabat quodammodo. cum diceret hoc est corpus meum. afterwards resuming his former words, he thus glosseth upon them, when hee commended his Body and Blood hee tooke into his hands that which the faithfull know, and hee carried himselfe after a sort when he said, This is my Body. He dasheth all your hope, for hee expoundeth quodammodo as Gratian teacheth you out of his 23. Ep. ad Bonifac. non rei veritate, sed significante mysterio, not in the truth of the thing, but in a signifying mystery, de 3. consect. dist. 2.
               Your third allegation hurteth us not Rep. ad 3. at all, for wee acknowledge both as Altar and an Host in the Fathers sense
                     •…
                  
                  
to wit, mysticall or representative, in memory of that one most proper Host and sacrifice offered once for all upon the Crosse for the crossing of the hand writing against us, though we cannot allow of your Masse, Altar and Host, wherein Christ existing on earth, and covered with the formes of Bread and Wine, is said in his very substance by you, not Saint Austin to be offered up to God his Father.
               Your fourth allegation out of the 59. tract upon Iohn, is like Dido her Rep. ad 4. sword, wherewith shee ran her selfe Rep. ad 4. through,

                     Non hos quaesitum munus in usus
                  
For if the other Apostles who brought Faith and Repentance with them, received bread, the Lord, but Judas who brought neither, received panem Domini onely, not panem Dominum, not bread which was the Lord, two things hereupon necessarily ensue. First, that none can receive Christ the Lord, or panem Dominum without faith. Secondly, that bread is not turned into Christs body, for then Iudas could not receive panem Domini, but hee must needs have riceived panem Dominum.
               
               
                  
Your fift allegation out of the 162. Epist. of Saint Austin is already answered, Rep, ad 5. that Saint Austin called the wine which Iudas received, Christs blood and the price of our redemption; because it was the Sacrament thereof, so he expoundeth himselfe in the words following, Sacramē

                  Hee gave the Sacrament of his Body and Blood in common to all his Disciples, not excluding Judas.
               Your sixt and last allegation is like a piece of coyne, full weight, but of counterfeit mettall: the Sermon ad Neophytos is not Saint Austins as your Parisians note, neither are there in it any such words as you quote.
               By this time you perceive that your few allegations out of Saint Austin are partly forged, partly forced, and yet come not home to your carnall presence by Transubstantiation, whereas on the contrarie, the testimonies we produce out of Saint Austine are very many, and those most undoubted, free, cleare, and pregnant, for the doctrine of our Artic. of Religion. 28. Church concerning the body of Christ given taken and eaten in the Supper onely after an heavenly and spirituall manner, by faith, I reduce them all to sixe heads.

Law, and wee under the Gospell in the Sacrament, receive the same thing in truth, and substance; it followeth that we receive not Christs flesh with the mouth after a carnall manner, but onely by faith after a spirituall: for before Christs Incarnation, the Fathers could no otherwise

receive it.
                     But the Fathers under the Law in their Sacraments, and wee under the Gospell in ours receive the same thing in truth and substance, as Saint De utilitate penit, Eundem cibum spiritualem manducaverunt, quid est eundem nisi quod eum quem etiam nos.

                        Ergo according to Saint Austin wee eate not Christs flesh in the Sacrament with the mouth, after a carnall manner, but onely by faith after a spirituall.
                  
               
               Touching the second.

                        body and blood is his very body and blood: for signum &amp; signatum, the signe,

and the thing signified, the type and the truth are relatively opposed; and therefore no more can the one be the other, then the Father bee the Sonne, or the Master the Servant, or the Prince the Subject, or the Husband the Wife; in so much that Saint Chrys. Homil. gen.

Spiritually and Figuratively, and not in the proper sense which the letter carrieth, nothing can be from them concluded for the eating the very flesh of Christ with the mouth, for so to eate the flesh of Christ, is to eate it corporally, not Sacramentally, carnally, not spiritually; properly, not figuratively▪ wheras to believe in Christs Incarnation, to bee partaker of the benefits of his Passion, to abide in him, and to be preserved in body and soule to eternal life (which are the interpretations Saint Austin giveth) is not to eate Christ flesh properly, but onely in an allegoricall sense.

                        hoc praeceptum in figurâ positum esse, and the words non dubitavit, clearely demonstrate Saint Austins meaning to bee: that though it might seeme harsh to call the bread which is a signe of Christs body, his body, as the blood of a beast slaine the soule, yet by a figure Christ

made no scruple so to tearme it. Doubtlesse the blood of any beast slaine is neither properly the soule of that beast, nor a signe of a soule present in it: no more by Saint Austins comparing (these Texts together) is bread Christs body, nor a signe of his body present in it, but onely a Sacrament and memoriall thereof.

Was not Christ once offered in himselfe? and yet in the Sacrament he is not onely offered at Easter, but every day, neither doth he lie who being asked shall answer that he is offered. For if Sacraments had not a resemblance of those things whereof they are Sacraments, they should not bee Sacraments at all. Now in regard of this resemblance, for the most part they take the name of the things themselves. As therefore the Sacrament of Christs body after a sort is Christs body, the Sacrament of his blood is his blood: so the Sacrament of faith
                        
(hee meanes there Baptsime) is faith. But I assume Good-Friday last past was not the very day of Christs Passion, nor the last Lords day, the day of his Resurrection, nor the celebration of the Sacrament the very offering of Christ on the Crosse, nor Baptisme the very habit or doctrine of faith, but so tearmed onely by a figure, to wit, a Metonymie, therefore neither is that of which Christ said, This is my Body, his body in propriety of speech; but onely so tearmed by a figure, because it is the Sacrament, and resemblance of his body. For all these speeches Saint Austin in this Epistle makes to bee like. I know not what can be more plaine, except the words of the same Serm. 33. de verbis Dom. caenam manibus suis

                        Sacrament hereof that is of the unity of Christs Body and Blood is taken at the Lords Table, by some to life,

by others to destruction, but the thing it selfe whereof it is a Sacrament, (that

For after Christ had said, he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life, hee presently addeth, and I will raise him up at the last day. And a little after hee expoundeth what it is to eate his body and drinke his blood, Saying, he that eates my flesh and drinkes my blood, abides

Tract upon Iohn, concerning Iudas eating panem Domini, and not panem Dominum, (the bread of the Lord, not bread the Lord) because I have retorted it before upon S. E. and out of all these places I conclude.
                     
                        Ergo the Bread and Wine according to Saint Austin, after consecration are not the very body and blood of Christ. The Syllogisme which hath beene proposed at large, with frequent testimonies out of Saint Austin to confirme the Assumption, may bee thus contracted.

                           Some wicked men and

reprobates eate the bread after the consecration,
                           
                              Ergo the bread after the consecration is not Christs body.

                     (viz.) The necessary dependence of accidents in their subiects
                  
                     Whosoever holdeth the doctrine of Transubstantiation beleeveth that accidents may subsist without their subjects. For Transubstantiation as your Church defineth, is a mutation or turning of the whole substance of bread into the whole substance of Christs body, and the whole substance of the wine into the substance of Christs blood, the accidents of bread and wine still remaining (viz.) The whitenesse, thicknesse, roundnesse, and tast of the bread, the thinnesse, moysture, colour, and relish of the wine with the quantity of both. Their owne subject being gone,

where sticke or inhere these accidents? in the ayre? or Christs bodie? you cannot say either. For every accidentall forme denominateth the subject in which it is inherent, according to that axiome of Logick, quicquid in est in dicitur de. But neither Christ his body, nor the ayre is denominated by these accidents; neither the ayre nor Christs body hath the colour, quantity, figure, or tast of bread or wine. Neither the ayre, nor Christs body is white or round like a wafer, &amp;c. It remaineth therefore that according to your tenet that these accidents remaine in no subject.

thicknesse, and nothing thicke; rednesse and nothing red; moisture, and nothing moist: it goeth beyond all the fictions in Ovid his Metamorphosis, to turne accidents into substance, and substance into accidents: to talke of meere accidents broken, eaten, digested and voided: to tell us of accidents putrified, and growing finwood, and mouldie and breeding vermine: of accidents frozen and congealed: nay of accidents not onely subsisting by themselves, but also supporting substance, as when dirt stickes to the Sacrament through negligence, it having fallen to the ground; or when poyson hath beene put into it, wherewith

                        Austin ex professo denies the Sacraments to be miraculous. The Sacraments which are knowne of men, and administred by men, may have reverence as holy things, not admiration: we cannot bee astonished at them, as at miracles. But your doctrine of Transubstantiation cannot be maintained without more miracles, then there are letters in the words of consecration, from whence I conclude,
                     
                        Ergo Saint Austin beleeved not the doctrine of Transubstantiation.

                           (viz.) The limitation of Christs humane body to one place at once. that Christs body is confined to a certaine place, and there is after the manner of other bodies with distinction of parts, overthroweth

the doctrine of Transubstantiation. For your doctrine of Transubstantiation putteth Christs body upon a Million of Altars at once, and teacheth that it is whole in the whole, and whole in every part of the host being there as invisible, so also indivisible.
                     But Saint Austin teacheth that Christs body is confined to one place at once; and is there after the manner of other bodies, with distinction of parts, or as the Logitians speake, parte extra partem.

                        poore you have alwaies with you, but me you shall not have alwaies: Let good men receive this saying without feare. For he spake this of the presence of his body. For according to his providence, according to his unspeakeable and visible grace, that is fulfilled which was spoken by him, Behold I am with you to the end of the world. Christ being absent yet is present, he is gone, and yet hee is here, he is returned, and yet hath not forsaken us, for his body hee hath brought into heaven, his Majesty he hath not taken from the world.
                     
                     
                        
Neither will your common answer hold water, that Christs bodie naturally is but in one place, yet by miracle it may be, and is in so many thousand places at once, as the Sacrament is celebrated: for 1. Wee Excep. 1. ought not to argue from the power of God to his will, but on the contrarie, from his will to his power, whatsoever hee will doe he can doe: but hee can doe many things which hee never will. Proove that hee will put his body in a 1000 places at once, and we will never contest with you about his power. 2. I before 2. shewed you out of Saint Austin, that the Sacraments are to be reverenced as holy things, not to be admired as strange and marvellous: signes they are of grace, which are properly

called mysteries; not signa potentiae, which are properly called miracles. The effect indeed of this Sacrament in the soules of the faithfull, as also of the other is supernaturall: yet as the Water in Baptisme is not by miracle turned into Christs blood: 3. so neither is the bread in the Lords Supper by miracle turned into his body. 3. Saint Austin in this 50. Tract upon Iohn, useth an argument like to that of the Angell, Mat. 286. He is not here for hee is risen, Christ

                        according to his flesh is not now with us, because hee is ascended into heaven, which reason, if it hath any force at all, must imply and presuppose that Christs body at the same time could not bee in heaven, and upon earth. 4. This Father in his 20 booke against

the Maniches, concludeth not onely that Christs body was not in more places at once, but that it could not bee. The Dilemma there he useth against them is this. When you Manichees beleeve that Christ was at once in the Sunne, the Moone and the Crosse, whether meane you according to his spirituall presence as God, or according to his corporall presence as man: if you speake of his spirituall presence, according to that hee could not suffer those things; if of his corporall presence, according to it he could not be at once in the Sunne, in the Moone and in the Crosse. Certainely if in Saint Austins judgement Christs Body could not be in three places at once, it can much lesse bee in three millions of places where Masses are said at

the same houre, I conclude therefore this argument and this Chapter.
                     
                        Ergo Saint Austin overthroweth your carnall presence of Christ in the Sacrament by Transubstautiation.

                  Origen, who in his seventh Homilie upon Leviticus, repeating those words of our Saviour, unlesse ye eate the flesh of the Sonne of man and drinke his blood, ye have no life in you, saith of them, if ye follow the letter, that letter killeth. To this

allegation you answer; That Origen speakes according to the capernaiticall letter, that is, according to the literall sense wherein the Capernaits did understand those words, who as Saint 
                  In Psal. 4. &amp; 98. &amp;c. 6. Iohn. Austin and 
                  De caena Dom. 
                  Cyprian say, thought our Saviour would have cut off some pieces from his body and given them to eate, or that they were to eate it boyled or rosted.
               
               But 1. You should have observed that Origen saith not, if you follow the 
                  Rep. 1. 
                  conceits of the Capernaits, but if you follow the letter of Christ, that is the sense, which the letter of his words carrie. Now there is never a word, letter, or sillable in Christs speech, which signifieth, or importeth boyling or rosting, cutting or mangling. These are but accidents to the eating of flesh, flesh may bee eaten, and that in the most proper acception of the phrase, though it be neither boyled, or rosted, nor mangled. Whosoever takes flesh raw, or rosted, whole or cut, into his mouth, cheweth it with his teeth, and after conveigheth it into his stomacke: truely and properly eateth that flesh. Thus you doe in the Sacrament, if

Pope Nicolas prescribe not a wrong forme of recantation to Berengarius, yet extant in your Canon Law: I 
                  Grat. de consecrat. dist. 3. Ego Berengarius credo corpus Domini sonsual

Berengarius doe beleeve the body of our Lord Iesus Christ to bee sensually or sensibly and in truth handled by the hands of the Priest, broken and champt or torne in peeces by the teeth of the faithfull.
               
               2. You should have cast backe your eye to the precedent words of Origen, which make it evidently appeare, that he listened not to your Iewes harpe, nor tooke the tune from the Cap

                     naits straine: but that his meaning was, that we ought to take the words of our Saviour in a spirituall and figurative sense, and not in the carnall and proper. For having related the words of those Jewes in Saint Iohn, how shall this man give us his flesh to eate? hee turneth to his Christian auditors, saying, But you if you are Children of the Church, if you are instructed in the mysteries of the Gospell, if the Word which was made flesh dwell among you, acknowledge these things to be true which we say, because they are the words of the Lord. Acknowledge that there are

                  figures in the Scriptures, and examine and understand those things that are spoken as spirituall men not as carnall, for if you take these things as carnall, they will hurt you and not nourish you: for there is a letter that killeth in the Gospell as well as in the Law, there is a letter in the Gospell which killeth him that understandeth it not spiritually, and then follow the words above alleaged. For if thou follow the letter in these words, unlesse ye eate my flesh and drinke my blood, the letter killeth.
               
               Thus having freed this passage, I might proceed to the examination of your next Section, yet 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as before I have done in Tertullian and Saint Austin, so I will now cleare other places in this Fathers Workes, and proove him to be a thorough man for us every where. I will follow the order of his bookes in the edition at Basil, that you may speedily with a wet finger turne to every cotation.
               First, cast I pray you a looke to his ninth Hom. 9. in Lev. Non haereas in sanguine carnis, sed disce potius sanguinem verbi, &amp; audi ipsum tibi dicentem, hic sanguis mens est qui pro vobu effunditur in remissionem peccatorum. Homilie; Thou who art come to Christ the true Priest, who by his blood hath reconciled thee to his Father,

sticke not in the blood of the flesh, but learne rather the blood of the Word, and heare him saying to thee, This is my blood which is shed for you for the remission of sinnes. He who is instructed in the mystery of the Sacraments, knoweth both the flesh and blood of the Word of God. You who presse the letter and urge the carnall eating of the flesh of Christ with the mouth, sticke in the blood of the flesh, but we who feede on Christ by faith, receive the blood of the Word, and eate the flesh and blood of the Word of God in our heart according to Origens wholesome advise.

                  Numbers, there is a passage paralell to this, Who can eate flesh and drinke blood? he answereth, the Christian people, the faithfull heare these words, and embrace them, unlesse ye eate my flesh and drinke my blood ye have no life in you, because my flesh is meate indeed, He that spake this was wounded for our sinnes, and we are said to drinke his blood, not onely in the rite of the Sacrament, (when we drinke of the consecrated cup) but also when we receive his sayings, in

which life consisteth, as himselfe saith, 
                  
                     I. b. quis est iste populus qui in usu habet sanguinem bibe

                        e, populus fidelis, populus Christianus audit has, complectit eum qui dicit nisi manducaveritis carnem filij hominis. 
                  the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and life, and a little after hee concludeth, thou therefore art the true people of Israel, which knowest how to eate the flesh and drinke the blood of the Word of God. In this passage, with one blow he cuts off both your carnall manducation, and your halfe communion, the people as you heare drinke of the blood of Christ both in the Sacrament and out of it, but how? with the mouth? nay but by faith, therefore he saith, not that all Christian people drinke it, but populus fidelis, the people that hath faith in his words, and by receiving his sayings drinke his blood, both at the communion and at other times in hearing and reading the Word.
               Thirdly, he is constant in this his figurative and spirituall interpretation of the words of our Saviour in the 6. of Iohn, for in his 23 Homilie upon the booke of Hom. in Num. c. 28. Hom. 23. Iudaei carnali sensu comedunt carnis Agni, nos autem comedamus carnem verbi Dei, ipse en

                      Dei. 
                  Numbers, he harpeth upon the same string, Christ our Passeoveris offered for us, let the Iewes in a carnall sense eate the flesh of a Lambe, but let us eate the flesh of the Word of

God, for he saith unlesse ye eate my flesh ye have no life in you, this that 
                        〈◊〉
                      now speake is the flesh of the Word of God. If you can eate words with your mouth, and chew them with your teeth, you may in Origens judgemen eate the flesh of Christ with your mouth: but if you cannot do that, then according to our English proverbiall speech, eate your owne words, and retract your grosse and carnall assertion.

                  Origen concerning the matter of bread, which he calleth the typicall and symbolicall body of Christ, and saith, it goeth into the bellie and is cast out in the draught; but for Christ himselfe, and his flesh, he saith, that it is the true meate, which whosoever eates shall live for ever, which no wicked man can eate. I am sure wicked men can and doe eate of the bread after consecration: it is

not then in Origens judgement Christs flesh. I pray also resolve me what is that S. Origen calls the matter of bread which he tearmes Christs typicall and symbolicall body, and saith it goeth into the belly, &amp;c. you dare not say Christs body. For it is blasphemy in the highest degree, to say that his glorified body passeth through the guts and is cast out into the draught: Substance of bread you say there is none, and to call accidents a body and the matter or materiall part of bread, is as absurd in speech as it is in sense, that a man can void tasts, and colours, and figures without substance.

Thou hast prepared a table

before me. And the drinke which God the Word calls his blood, is the Word making glad the hearts of the drinkers. Marke I beseech you, hee saith that Christ calleth bread his body, which he could not but by a trope or figure, sith bread and his body are substantiae disparatae, substances of divers kinds, which cannot in truth and propriety of speech one be called the other. Secondly, hee saith that this bread is the foode of soules, and this drinke refresheth and maketh glad the hearts of them that drinke: it is the foode of soules, not bodies, and the drinke of the heart, not of the mouth, if wee beleeve this Father.

The other manner is, when thou takest that holy and uncorrupted banquet, when thou dost enjoy the bread and cup of life, eatest and drinkest the body and blood of our

Lord, then our Lord doth enter under thy roofe, wherefore humbling thy selfe imitate the Centurion, and say, Lord I am not worthy that thou come under my roofe. Observe I pray you as before, that the faithfull enjoy the cup of life as well as the bread, whereof you utterly deprive them, and that by roofe hee meanes the heart which entertaines Christ, not the mouth.

                     n as in truth it is the Sacrament of the body of Christ, I meane of that which being visible, palpable, mortall, was put upon the Crosse, and that immolation of the flesh which is done by the hands of the Priest, is called the Passion, death and crucifixion, not in the verity of the thing, but in a signifying mystery: so the Sacrament of faith (Baptisme) is faith. The Coeleste Sacramentum quod verè representat Christi carnem dicitur corpus Christi, sed impropriè, unde dicitur suo modo sed non rei veritate, sed significante mysterio, ut sit sensus vocatur Christi corpus, idest significatur.
                   glosse addeth

the heavenly Sacrament which truly doth represent the flesh of Christ, is called the body of Christ but improperly; wherefore it is said in a sort but not in the truth of the thing, but in a signifying mysterie. This testimony of Gratian is like a great torch throughly lightened, which a strong blast of winde bloweth not out, but maketh it blaze the brighter. Three puffes you and your Chaplaine have at it. First, you say Gratian is no authenticall Author with you, much lesse the glosse. Secondly, you say his words are meant of the accidents which are a Sacrament onely of Christs body. Thirdly, your Chaplaine addeth, that the flesh of Christ on the Altar is a Sacrament of Christs visible and palpable body upon the Crosse, you say the lesse to the purpose by saying so much, and your answers interfere on the other. For if Gratian bee no authenticall Author with you, why doc you straine your wits to make his words reach home to the truth? why doe you contradict one the other to make Gratian agree to himselfe? the truth is, you have a Woulfe by the eares, you can neither safely hold him,

nor let him goe. For if you reject Gratians authoritie, all the Canonists like so many Hornets will bee about your eares: if you admit him, you loose your cause, for then you must confesse, that after consecration, that which remaineth on the Altar is not indeed Christs body, but a Sacrament thereof, whcih is no otherwise called Christs body, then your oblation in the Masse is called the crucifying of Christ, and that I am sure you will say and sweare too is not in the truth of the thing, but in a signifying mystery. To examine your answers severally.
               First, you impeach Gratians credit, telling us, that with you he is no authenticall Author: What you meane by authenticall I know not, a classicall Author sure he is with you, who preferre him before Dionisius, Exiguus, Isidorus, Cresconius, Burchardus, Ivo, and all other compilers of antient decrees, and reade him publikely in your Bellar. de Scriptor.

                     . Schooles. What esteeme Aristotle is in with Phylosophers, Hypocrates with Physitians, Euclides with Geometricians, Iohannes de sacro Bosco with Astronomers, Ptolomey with Cosmographers, Peter

Lumbard with Schoole Divines, Iustinian with civill Lawyers, the same in Gratian with Canonists. And if before he were not an authenticall Author with you, yet since the yeare 1580. in which by the authority of Gregory the fourteenth, hee was revised and purged, he must needs bee authenticall with you. Howsoever it stands with Gratian (because it may be your Dioces of Chalcedon is not governed by the Canon Law) this testimony out of him is as a threefold cable, which though you and your Chaplaine tugg never so hard at, you will never bee able to breake, for Gratian quoteth this out of the Sentences of Saint Austin, gathered by his Schollar Saint Prosper. Gratian is but the relater and approver, S. Prosper or rather Vid. titulum decret. Aug. in lib. Sentet. Prosper. Saint Austin is the Author thereof, and is not Saint Austin with you an authenticall Author?
               Secondly, upon better advise you admit of the authority of this testimony, and shape a kinde of answer unto it, that when Gratian out of Saint Austin denies the bread to be Christs body, he meaneth the accidents of bread,

which are Sacramentum tantum, the Sacrament onely, and not in truth the body of Christ. This answer cannot stand: for the accidents of bread are not panis, much lesse coelestis panis, heavenly bread, or coeleste Sacramentum, a heavenly Sacrament, and lest of all Christs flesh, therefore the former words cannot bee meant of the accidents, but of the consecrated host. What S. E. adds to piece out your answer, that the accidents may be so called in regard of their reference to our Saviours bodie which they cover; which reference is founded upon an heavenly action, to wit, consecration, is unworthy the refutation, for he beg
                     •…
                   that which hee ought to proove, that the accidents of bread cover our Saviours body: this wee denie, and I have disproved it in the former Section. Besides, he seemeth to be ignorant of your Church tenet, which is, that the words of consecration worke upon the substance of bread, and turne it into Christs body not upon the accidents.
               Thirdly, the last answer which you or your Chaplaine give, is worst of all, (viz.) that the body of Christ on

the Altar is a Sacrament of Christs visible and palpable body which hung on the Crosse for this is not onely an absurd and senselesse, but also an hereticall and blasphemous solution. 'Tis absurd to make the same body num
                        •…
                     ro to be a Sacrament of it selfe, tis all one as to say that the disease is the symptome of it selfe, or the Ivy bush is a signe of it selfe, or the face is the picture of it selfe, or the substance is the shadow of it selfe. A Sacrament as your Schooles out of Saint Austin define, is a visible signe of an invisible grace, how then I pray you can the flesh of Christ in the Sacrament (which you teach to bee covered under the forme of bread and so to bee invisible) bee a Sacrament of the visible flesh of Christ on the Crosse, visible things may bee signes and Sacraments of invisible, but it is a thing impossible, that an invisible thing should bee the Sacramentall signe of a visible. I would forgive your Chaplaine the absurdity and senselesnesse of his answer, if there were not implied heresie in it against the fundamentall Article of our Creed.
               
                  
'Tis flat heresie to affirme that Christ had more then one individuall humane bodie: but if the body of Christ really and substantially and carnally present on the Altar, is a Sacrament of his owne body, then on the Crosse, or now at the right hand of his Father, then hee must have two bodies, one visible and palpable on the Crosse, when hee suffered, and now in heaven, and an other at this very instant invisible, insensible, and impalpable on the Altar.
               Thus having made good our fort in Gratian, I might passe to the next Section: yet because your Armourbearer S. E. will not yeeld us this fort, but having produced some passages out of Gratian, and the Glosse against us leaveth it to the Reader to judge with 
                  P. 119, 120. 
                  what conscience I cited them for our opinion. I will out of this one distinction in Gratian, produce so many pregnant testimonies for us, that any indifferent Reader will marvell with what face you can denie him to bee ours. For the Glosse which you reject with such scorne, all that I will say shall bee this, that although he lived in times

of thickest darkenesse, even in the midnight of Popery: yet hee saw a glimmering of the truth in this point, as appeareth by his note upon cap. ego Berengarius, unlesse saith he thou dost understand the words of Berengarius in a good and sound or wholesome sense, (in which according to a forme prescribed him by Pope Nicolas, hee confesseth Christs body to bee eaten in the Sacrament with the mouth &amp; torne with the Nisi sa

But as for Gratian on whose Text he Commenteth, who lived in times not altogether so corrupt, hee saw the truth of this point concerning the spirituall eating of Christ in the Sacrament by faith, and not with the mouth so clearely, ac si solis radio descripta esset, as if it had beene described before him with a beame of the Sunne.

In the Chapter Tribus, Pope Clemens gives charge to the Priest, Deacon, and Minister, to keepe with feare and trembling the reliques of the fragments of Christs body, what meaneth he I pray you by fragments, hee cannot meane the fragments of accidents, for accidents have no fragments or reliques, neither can hee meane any broken parts of Christs very body, for himselfe teacheth out of Austin. c.

               3. In the Chapter Vt Quid out of Saint Austins booke, de remedio penitentiae, hee quoteth these words, Why dost thou prepare thy tooth and thy belly? beleeve and thou hast eaten, he that beleeveth

in him eateth him: if the tooth and bellie have nothing to doe in eating Christs flesh, how doe you affirme that he is eaten with the mouth.
               4. In the Chapter prima quidem out Vide supra in P. 11. of Saint Austin his Comment upon the fourth Psalme, he repeateth those two testimonies which before I produced in Paragraph the eleaventh. The first is a strong evidence against the carnall interpretation of Christs words, the latter against the supposed existence of Christs body in more places at once. The former is this, spiritually understand what I have spoken, you shall not eate this body which you see, nor drinke that blood which they who crucifie mee shall shed; I have commended a kinde of Sacrament or mystery unto you, which being spiritually understood will quicken you. The latter is, the body of Christ in which he rose must bee in one place, his truth or divinity is every where.

though he daily receive the Sacrament of so great a thing to his condemnation and perdition.

                  Hierom upon Leviticus, hee determineth, that it is lawfull for us to eate of that Host which is offered in memoriall of Christ: but that it is lawfull for no man to eate of that Host in it selfe which Christ offered upon the Altar of the Crosse. Whereof no other good construction can be made then this, that we may eate of the bread broken on the Lords Table, whereby Christs sacrifice upon the Crosse is represented, but not

of the very body of Christ it selfe which was offered upon the Crosse. We may eate with the mouth Christs flesh in Symbolo, but not in se or secundumse, wee may eate it in the signe or Sacrament thereof, but not properly and orally in it selfe. What you alleadge for your selfe out of Gratian, maketh very much against you, the P. 111. words are, The sacrifice of the Church doth consist of two things, the visible forme of elements, and the invisible flesh of Christ, both of a Sacrament, and re Sacramenti, as the person of Christ doth consist of God and man. To this distinction wee fully subscribe, that the Lords Supper or Sacrament consists of a visible part, to wit, the outward elements offered to our bodily senses, and of an invisible or heavenly part, the flesh and blood of Christ exhibited by the Spirit to the eye of our faith, but you cannot allow of this distinction of parts: For you have no elements at all. For accidents without substance are no elements, and besides accidents you have nothing in your Sacrament but Christs flesh, which is the res Sacramenti. Moreover if the

Sacrament consist of the elements and Christs body, as Christs person consisteth of his humane and divine nature (as Gratian out of Saint Austin affirmeth) then is not the substance of the element turned into the substance of Christs body, but both remaine entire, as the humane nature of Christ is not turned into the divine but remaineth entire.

                     Ergo this speech cannot be proper, but must of necessity be figurative and tropicall: and if so, downe falls Transubstantiation built upon it, and carnall presence built upon Transubstantiation, and the oblation and adoration of the Host built upon the carnall presence.

Bread is a substance inanimate, Christs Body is animate, bread of the figure of a loafe, or wafer, Christs Body of the figure of a man: bread inorganicall or without orgaines or members, Christs Body Organicall: bread made of wheat flower, Christs Body of Virgins blood: bread therefore in propriety of speech, can no more bee Christs Body, then Christ himselfe a Vine, or a Doore, or a Way, or a Rocke, all which speeches our Adversaries themselves confesse to bee tropicall and figurative.

He pointed therefore to the substance of bread, when he said hoc This, and consequently the meaning of his words are,

                  First, in this answer you contradict the Tenet of your Church and your selfe. For if by hoc or this as the Fathers teach, wee are to understand hic panis, this bread, and the sense of the whole is, this bread is my body, and bread here stands not for bread in substance, but in appearance onely, or in the exterior forme, or that which is made of bread as your Chaplaine hath P. 1

                  Secondly, this your interpretation no better agreeth with the Fathers words, then a wet mould doth with running mettall which makes it flie backe with

a great force, for instance, Iustin Martyr in the words above cited by bread or food, understandeth that whereby as hee saith our bodies are nourished, quae mutata nutrit carnes nostras, but that is not bread turned into Christs body; for Christs body is no meate for the belly, nor is it turned into our flesh. Irenaeus speaketh of bread, ejus conditionis quae secundum nos, of bread that is usuall among us, l. 4. c. 57. c. 34. of bread, qui est c terra, which is taken from the earth, such is not super-substantiall bread, or transubstantiated into Christs body.

Cyprian speaketh of bread made of many cornes or graines, and of wine pressed out

of many grapes. Ambrose speaketh of bread broken, but super-substantiall bread or turned into Christs body is not broken bread. Saint Hierome likewise speakes of broken bread, and consequently not of the heavenly bread which is Christs flesh. Epiphanius speakes of that which is of a round figure and without sense, and such is bakers bread, but not that bread which Christ said, Iohn the 6. He would give us, to wit, his flesh for the life of the world.

                        •…
                     are bread and wine. The bread after the calling upon of the Holy Ghost, is no more common bread, as the ointment after benediction is no more common ointment but chrisme. Yet oyle after benediction still retaineth the substance of oyle, and so doth the bread after consecrasion the substance of bread. The Author Decaen. Dom. who is so much in your Bookes, that wee finde him almost in every Section; is not the blessed Martyr Saint Cyprian, as Bellarmine proveth by many arguments, but a farre later Writer by name Arnoldus Carmotensis, as the Epistle Dedicatory to Pope Adrian, who sate Anno 1154. extant in All-Soules Library in Oxford testifieth: but bee hee Cyprian or Arnoldus who wrote the Treatises de cardinalibus Christi operibus, hee is no friend to your carnall presence,

or Transubstantiation, for in the Chapter cited by you, hee hath these words, wee whet not our teeth to eate, but by 
                  Non dentes ad mordendū accuimus, sed fide sincerâ panem sanctum frangimus &amp; partimur. 
                  sincere faith wee breake the holy bread. And in the words immediatly following those words which you alleadge, hee saith, that Christ powreth his divine Essence into the Sacrament, even as in Christ under the humane nature the divinity lay hid, therefore according to this Author, there remaineth the substance of bread, together with Christs Body Sacramentally united, as in Christ, the humane and the divine nature remaine united hypostatically. And moreover, that when hee saith the bread is changed, not in shape, but in nature, and by the Omnipotencie of the Word made flesh, that hee speaketh of a Sacramentall change and not substantiall, and that by nature hee meaneth the naturall and common use, not the essence of bread, appeareth by his owne words a little before in this Immortalitatis alimonia datur a communibus cibis differens corporalis substantiae retinens spectem. Tract of the Supper of the Lord. That although the immortall food delivered in the Eucharist differ from common meate, yet it retaineth the kinde of corporall substance. And in

                  Fourthly, I proove it by force of reason, when this Pronoune hoc is uttered it must signifie something then existent, but that could not be Christs body under the accidents of bread, for vour Bellar. l. 1. del

Hereunto you answer, that 
                     hoc doth signifie and suppose, not for that instant in which it is uttered, but for the end of the proposition, when the praedicatum is in being, as when I say this is a crosse and make it withall, the word this doth suppose for the crosse, not which is when the

word (this) is uttered, but which is within the whole time that I speak, so when I say taceo, I doe not signifie that I speake not while I am uttering this word, but that I am silent when I have done uttering. So saith your Chaplaine in these operative speeches P. 135. of our Saviour, Lazarus come forth, young man arise, the words Lazarus and young man, did not signifie persons existent then precisely when they were uttered, but when the speeches were compleat.
               If Sophistry were the science of salvation, these knack and querkes of wit Refut. might be in high esteeme, wheras they no more befit Divinity then it would become grave Cato to cut many a crossecaper. I might justly remand you &amp; your Chaplaine to the disputations in parvis, where such cummin as this is tithed, or rather such gnats streigned by puneys in Logick: yet because you shall not say that I let passe any apex or title in your booke, I will examine all these your instances. To which I replie, first in generall, that you beg what you ought to prove and use a base fallacie in all this di

                     •…
                  d petitio principij: you

take it for granted, that these words of our Saviour (This is my Body) are practicall in your sense, that is, worke a substantiall and miraculous change, which we denie, and you will never be able to make good proofe of.
               For first, bare words as they are words, have no operative power, much lesse a vertue to worke miracles, which cannot be effected without the imployment of the divine Omnipotencie.
               Secondly, words that are practicall, that is used by God or men as instruments to produce any effect of this nature, are imperative or uttered in the imperative mood, as Be thou cleane, receive thy sight, Lazarus come forth, young man arise, sile obmutesce and the like, not in the indicative, as This is my Body, This is my Blood.
               
               Thirdly, the words of themselves can no more proove the bread to bee turned into Christs Body then the accidents. For certaine it is, and con
                     •…
                  
                  sed on all sides, that when hee uttered these words, This is my Body, he pointed to that which he held in his hands, which was a substance clothed with the accidents, colour, quantity, tast and the like.
               
                  
But your selves confesse, that by vertue of these words This is my Body, the accidents are not turned into Christs Body: therefore neither can it be prooved, that by vertue of these words, Th
                        •…
                      is my Body the substance of bread is turned into Christs Body.
               In particular to your first instance in a Crosse, which at the same instant you make, and say this is a Crosse. I answer, first that if you could proove Christ had a purpose to make his Body in your sense, as you have to make a Crosse, when you say this is a Crosse, and make it withall, this instance of yours were considerable, but till you proove the former, 'tis nothing to the purpose. Secondly, either you have made the Crosse with your fingers before, or at the instant when you say (this:) or els your speech, this is a Crosse, if it be true, is figurative, the present tense est being taken pro proximè futuro, that is, for the time immediatly ensuing upon the uttering of your words.
               To your second instance, in the word taceo, I hold my peace. I answer, that if you will make a proposition of it, you must resolve it into ego sum tacens, I am

silent, and then the subject (I) is in being when this word (I) is uttered, and likewise the praedicatum silent is in being as soone as the word is uttered. Howbeit in ordinary and vulgar speech taceo is taken for jam nunc tacebo, I hold my peace, tha
                     •…
                   is, I will utter not a word more.
               To your third instance in Lazarus and the young man. I answer, that either Christ by a Metonymie, partis pro toto, called Lazarus his soule, or his body by the name of the whole Lazarus, or if Christs speech be proper, that both Lazarus and the young man, at that very instant when Christ called them were persons existent, their soules being returned to their bodies. For though the one came not forth out of his grave, nor the other arose till after our Saviours speech was compleat and ended, yet I say, and you shall never be able to disproove it, that at the same moment when Christ called Lazarus, Lazarus was in being, and so likewise the young man and the damsell. In a proposition every part or word is vox significativa, as soone as it is uttered, as you may learne out of Aristotles booke de interpretatione,

                  Iansenius. If the pronoune hoc demonstrate not accidents it must demonstrate the substance; either of bread then or Christs Body, if the substance of bread, then is there in the words necessarily a Tropologie; if of Christs Body, then you make of them a Tautologie or Battologie. And here againe you sticke in the mudd, and though your Chaplaine labour with might and maine to pull you out of it, yet hee plucks you not out, but you draw him in, and both are swallowed up in the same quagmire. For if this your interpretation bee admitted, this body of mine is my body, these absurdities will necessarily insue upon it.

1. Consecratorie words are such, whereby something which before was common is made sacred, according to the words of Saint Austin, accedit verbum ad elementum &amp; fit Sacramentum. But if the meaning of these words, This is my Body be this body of mine is my body, nothing by them of common is made sacred. For Christs body was never common, but alwaies most sacred, and by your explication hoc this hath no reference to bread but to Christs bodie.
               2. You teach generally that these words of the institution are not contemplative, but practick and operatorie, that is, they effect what they signifie, and indeed upon this hinge hang
                        •…
                      all your doctrine of Transubstantiation and carnall presence: but glossing the words with your paraphrase, viz. This body is my body, you breake downe this hinge. For all words which are operatory, or practicke, produce something by their prolation, which was not before: but Christs body was his body before the prolation of these words; therefore by the prolation of these words it is not made. If you answer

as your Chaplaine doth, that Christ by these words made not indeed his body, yet thereby hee made his body to bee under the shape of bread: you quite overthrow your doctrine of Transubstantiatiō. For the putting a body which was existent before, in a place or under a shape where it was not before, as for example, a candle under a bushell, or a picture under a curtaine, or a face under a maske, is a translocation, or transposition, or alteration of habit, or whatsoever rather then a Transubstantiation. This your acute Schoolemen well saw, Aureolus, Vasques, and Suarez, and therefore contend for a new production of Christs body in the Sacrament. For a meere succeeding of it in the place of bread, or union thereof with the accidents, or bringing it to, and placing it on the Lords Table will not inferre a Transubstantiation, their reasons are good.

                  Aureolus thus argues, when one thing precisely succeeds another, it is not true to say that that thing to which another succeedeth doth come, and is converted into that which succeedeth: that thing doth not passe into another which ceaseth to be before it come to

that other; as for example, wee say not that the Sea or a river passeth into another, which is dried up before it can come to it: as you say the substance of bread is abolisht before the substance of Christs body succeed.

For how absurd were it to say that D Bishop were transubstantiated into D. Smith, because D. Smith succeeds him in the See of Chalcedon: or that when your foure Lecturers at the Sorbon one after another read in the same pew, that at

               3. By this your Exposition you cut your selfe in the hammes, and enervat
                     •…
                   your maine argument for Transubstantiation. For as I told you in the Conference, the bare affirming Christs body to be his body, prooves not that any thing is turned into it. If Christ were now comming in the clouds, and any pointing to the cloud should say this or there is Christs body, could any from thence conclude the conversion of the cloud into his body. Every proposition which is of use in argumentation, and can affoord or minister a reason to proove any thing, must consist of one or more of the 4 praedicata topica, or at least one of the quinque praedicabilia, as every young Sophister can informe you: but in this proposition This is my Body, as you exp
                     •…
                  und it, this my body is my body, there is none of the 4 praedicata topica, or quinque praedicabilia. For the predicate herein is neither genus, nor species, nor differentia,
                  
nor proprium, nor accidents of the subject, but the selfe same with it re and ratione.
               
               4. Hence it followeth, that the proposition is meerely Identicall and neugatorie, which to affirme of any of the words of the word of life especially of these whereby hee instituted a most divine Sacrament were blasphemy, this fearefull consequence thus I inferre upon your interpretation.

                     Every proposition in which the subject and predicate are the same, not only quoad suppositum, but also quoad significationem, is meerely Identicall and nugatorie: In this propoposition God is wise, the subject and the predicate are the same, quoad suppositum, but not quoad significationem, for the subjectum Deus signifieth Gods Essence in generall, the predicate wise signifieth but one Attribute in particular: which though in regard of the simplicity of the divine

Essence, it be all one with God himselfe; yet is it distinguished from God quoad nostrum modum concipiendi, according to our apprehension. Likewise in this proposition, Petrus est Apostolus, Peter is an Apostle, or a man is a living creature, the praedicatum and subjectum are the same, quoad suppositum, for Peter is that Apostle, and that Apostle is Peter, a man is that living creature, and that living creature is a man: yet they differ, quoad significationem, for the subject signifieth the person of Peter, the predicate his office, and in the other proposition the subject signifieth the compositum, the predicate an essentiall part onely; and so in all other instances your Chaplaine brings: neither can any one instance bee brought of a proposition which is not meerely

neugatorie, in which the praedicatum and subjectu

Lastly, the word cup cannot be taken for blood contained in the cup, as it is evident by that which is added in my blood. For the speech will not bee congruous if thou say this blood is the New Testament

in my blood: the cup therefore must be properly taken for the vessell, which undoubtedly in the proper signification is not the New Testament, wherefore of necessity wee must confesse that these words this cup is the New Testament in my blood, cannot bee taken in the proper sense, but are spoken by a trope or figure.

what it was; wine or blood, and he resolves us that it was the fruit of the vine, and that we al know is wine, not blood, whence I framed this Syllogisme.
               
                  No blood is in propriety of speech the fruit of the vine.
                  That which Christ and his Apostles dranke in the consecrated Chalice was the fruit of the vine.
                  
                     Ergo it was not blood.

                     fut. that this your answer is a meere shift and evasion. For why should not Christ who is the truth, rather call that hee dranke according to that which it was in substance and truth, then that which it was as you teach onely in appearance, who ever heard accidents without substance, quantity or quality, moysture or rednesse called the fruit of

the vine? did Christ drinke meere accidents in the cup? or doe you at this day in the consecrated Chalice? if so, your Priests could never be at any time overseene or become light-headed in drinking never so much of the consecrated cup. For it is a thing never heard of, that meere accidents should send up a fume, much lesse overcome the braine and cause drunkennesse in any man, and I hope you will not flie to a miracle, and say that your Priests braines are intoxec

Your owne Schoolemen put the case, that a Priest may sometimes forget himselfe by drinking too deepe even in the holy cup. But I presse not this so much as that you in this your answer forget that we are about the Sacrament, where you will by no meanes allow of any such figure as excludeth the verity of the thing, otherwaies if you take a liberty to expound these words by a figure, and say, that Christ by a trope here called that which was his blood, wine, you shall never debarre us of the liberty of expounding the former verse by the like figure, and saying, that Christ

called by a trope that which was in truth wine, his blood. 'Tis hard to say, and more then you can prove, that Christ ever dranke his own blood upon earth: Mal. in Mat 26.

I appoint unto you a kingdome, that you may eat &amp; drinke at my table in my kingdome, therefore Christ spake not of his blood, but of wine, when he said, I will drinke no more of this fruit of the vine till I drink it new in heaven, thus your own Maldonate.
               
               Yet you have another ward you say, p. 162, 163, 164. that there is a Legall cup, and an Eucharisticall, both mentioned in Saint Luke, and that these words were spoken of the legall or common cup, as Saint Ierome, Saint Bede, Saint Theophylact expound.
               This ward will not beare off the Refut. blow which comes with such a weight, that it drives your weapon to your head, for
               1. 'Tis evident to any man that wilfully shuts not his eyes, that this in the 29. ver. hath reference to this in the 28. ver,

                  drinke ye all of this, for this is my blood, but I will not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the vine, these words immediatly follow the other, and of necessity have relation to them: neither can they have relation to any other cup then the Eucharisticall here, and in Saint Marke, because they make mention but of one cup, and that cup whereof Christ said, drinke ye all of this, for this is my blood of the New Testament. This reason alone convinced the conscience of your Learned B. Harm. Evang. Afferunt quidam Catholici haec verba non esse dicta a Domino post calicem sacrum, sed post priorem, cuius meminit Lucas, at id non patitur ordo Evang: cum enim Mattheus &amp; Marcus nullius alterius mentionem seccrint praeterquam sacri, quando dicitur ex hoc genimine vitis, nullus alius calix intelligi potest ab ijs demonstratus, quam cuius ipsi meminerunt. 
                  Iansenius who thus writeth upon this verse, Some Catholickes saith he, affirme that these words were not spoken of the Lord after he had drunke of the consecrated cup, but after the former, whereof mention is made in Saint Luke. But the order of the Evangelists will not suffer it. For sith Matthew and Marke make mention of no other cup then the consecrated, when it is said by them, of this fruit of the vine, no other cup can be conceived

2. The Authors alleadged by you to the contrarie doe not weaken the sinewes of my argument, for neither Ierome, nor Bede, nor Theophylact denie these words to be spoken of the consecrated cup, though they allegorize upon them.

For none of these Fathers alleadged by you, either in words or by consequence say that you put upon them, to wit, that the words mentioned in Saint Matthew are to bee understood of the Legall or common cup, Saint Cum Iude

Theophylact indeed makes mention of two cups, but saith not that

Among many instances of his halting together with you in your lame answers, I note three which are most notorious

and obuious to every vulgar eye.

S. E. runs away with this errour, through many Pages and Sections, and when hee is out of breath, p. 57. leaves the Reader to subsume, that if the distinction be not good of a figure and a meere figure, that either the Son of God whom the Scripture calleth the figure of his Fathers substance is a meere figure void of being, God without divinity, or that he is a meere fiction,  and againe, 
                     p. 58. A signe, image, or figure, is not necessarily void of being, as you conceive a shadow to be. Sacraments are signes and have some being, man is an image of God, yet a substance, the Sonne of God according

to Saint Paul is the figure of his Fathers Heb. 1. 3. substance (he should say image of his person) but not an empty figure, unlesse that be empty which hath in it a a whole infinitie of perfection. Quid ad Rombum? whats this to my argument, ego disputo de alijs ille respondet de

                  cepis, I dispute of tropes, he answers of types, I dispute of words, he answers of things: I dispute of Metaphors or Metonomies, he answers of images and Sacraments. Is Christ I pray you a trope? is man a figure in Rhetoricke? are the Sacraments Metonomies? is a King acting his owne tryumphs a Metaphor or an Allegorie? if you are ashamed to say so, bee then ashamed of your and your Chaplaines shifting evasions in your answer to my first argument.
               When in answer to my second argument taken out of Saint Austins third 2. booke, de doctrina Christiana, you said that the speech of our Saviour, Iohn the P. 67. 6. Vnlesse you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, you have no life in you, is according to Saint Augustine mixt of a proper and a figurative speech, and I replied upon you, that it is most certaine that Saint Austin in that place by figurate

Besides he speaketh of such a speech wherein an horrible wickednesse is commanded or a verteous action prohibited, which can in no sense bee true in the proper acception of the words: Otherwise it should be lawfull to sin because expressely commanded, and sinfull to doe well, because forbidden. To this replie he rejoynes negry quidem.
               
               When in refutation of your answer 3. to my argument, drawne from the pronoune this in the words of the institution, whereby you will have understood this bread transubstantiated into my body: I inferred this consequence thereupon, that the words of Consecration make nothing for Transubstantiation P. 300. or any thing els. For a proposition that is meerely identicall, quoad significatum proves nothing at all. I may truly say, pointing to Christs body in heaven at the right hand of his Father, this or that body of Christ is his body, and will it hence follow, that bread or any thing els is substantially

turned into Christs body? your Chaplaine answers no, but something els, how els could your mouth utter such an impertinent discourse, with which words hee concludes the fift Section. And thus as when Philip of Macedon walked in state, Clisophus his flatterer comes in strutting after him, and when afterwards Philips thigh was run thorough so that hee halted downeright, in comes Clisophus limping after him in the like manner: so where you are confident in your answer, S. E. is peremptorie, where you are profuse, he is redundant, where you are imperfect, he is defective, where you are lame, he halteth downe-right.
               The best is, what he is faultie in his 2. Adulation. answers, hee mends in his encomiums, and where he is defective in Argumentation, he supplies it to the full with flattery Numero 179. Cato obieci

Cato that Romane Worthie, framed a bill of indictment against Fulvius Nobilior, for rewarding his souldiers with garlands upon light occasions, and for meane services, as for looking to their fence, for digging a well strenuously. A like bill of indictement I might put in against S. E. for crowning you with a garland for doing no noble exploit at all, but onely holding up your buckler most valiantly.

                     oquitur an herus, who is the speaker you, or your servant? if S. E. bee your Chaplaine as his every where exhibiting unto you more then ordinary reverence should implie; I will be bold to tell him that he is sometimes very saucie with you, to spend his judgement upon your answers in such sort as he doth. It may be the Bishops P. 3, 4. of Chalcedons Chaplaines use such familiarity with their Lords: but assuredly the Chaplaines to the Ordinaries of England know better their distance. But if as we know that Matheus Tortus is Cardinall Bellarmine, and Doleman is Father Parsons, and Marcus Antonius Constantius is Steven Gardiner, so S. E. is Smithus Episcopus, then I am sorrie to see a Reverend Prelate so endeared to the Pope, and Cardinall Brandinus to be driven to this exigent, for want of a Herauld to blazon his owne armes and trumpet out his owne titles and praises. Yet I marvell not at it, because Chalcedon is very remote, and farre from good neighbours. Howsoever, whether it be hee or you, Edward Stratford, or Episcopus Smithus, it mattereth not much, domesticum testimonium is of little force in this

case, it will add no more to you then it can detract from me. For love looketh through that end of the perspective glasse, which maketh the object seeme bigger: but hatred through that end which maketh it seeme lesse then in truth it is. Be it

In this whole passage there is not a word true in your sense, but onely that M. Knevet died at Venice, if hee were reconciled

to your Romish Church, and died a Papist, name me the Priest who reconciled him, and on his death bed annealed him, and after his death buried him with your Romish rites, and bring some good proofe and testimonie hereof, to cleare your Chaplaine from the fowle imputation of belying the dead.

But the truth is, he was constant in the truth of his Religion to his last breath, and as the Lord Knevet and other of his alliance, and M. Russell and other of his acquaintance at Venice can testifie, he crowned his other good parts and graces with perseverance in the Orthodox faith to the end.

Howbeit because Venice is farre off, and M. Knevet being dead cannot speake for himselfe, your Knight of the post S. E. thought he might securely by an officious lie, tending so much to your reputation, and credit of the Catholique cause indeare himselfe to your Lordship.

               You felt the smart of our weapons in the first conflict, in such sort, that you would not meete the second time, unlesse I put in good security that I would not so much as draw upon you or shew you my weapons.
               Yea but say you 'tis evident I declined the conflict by my owne words to P. 187. one of my friends, whom I told that Catholickes brought so many testimonies of Fathers, to prove the reall presence, that there was need of many weekes to reade them over. And over against the words many testimonies you quote in the Margent. Trait

               MAster Featley demanding of D. Bagshaw whether hee would joyne in prayer with him, and the other refusing, made a short prayer to himselfe, and after he had ended it, began the Disputation as followeth.

                      English and French. Assembly is, Whether the Body of Christ be truly, really, and substantially contained in the Sacrament under the formes of bread and wine, as the Councell of Trent defineth. Which is a question of greatest importance: for if the Body of Christ be not there really and substantially, the Church of Rome which

adoreth the Host, committeth Idolatry in the highest degree, by attributing Divine honour or the highest degree of worship proper to God alone. 
                  cultum latriae to a piece of bread. And that the Body of Christ is not there in such sort as the Councell determineth, and the whole Church of Rome beleeveth, I will prove by necessary arguments drawne from the words of the institution, the doctrine and practise of the ancient Church, and the very principles of nature, and infallible grounds of Reason, Saint Paul fully setteth downe the institution of the Sacrament. I have received of the Lord (saith he) that which I also 
                  1 Cor. 11. 23, 24, 25, 26. 
                  have delivered unto you, to wit, that the Lord Iesus in the night that he was betraied, tooke bread. And when hee had given 
                  24. 
                  thankes, he brake it, and said, Take, eate: This is my Body, which is broken for you: this doe ye in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when 
                  25. 
                  he had supped, saying, this cup is the New Testament in my blood: this doe as oft as ye drinke it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye shall eate this breaed, and drinke 
                  26. 
                  this cup, ye shew the Lords death till hee come. In this faithfull relation of the Apostle many things are very remarkable. First, our Saviour spake to his Disciples

in a knowne tongue: you to the Communicants in an unknowne: Christ took bread and brake it: you breake no bread at all. Christ after hee had broken the bread, took the cup and gave it likewise to all the Communicants: you Gratian de cōsecrat. dist. 2 cap. caperimus aut integra Sacramunta percipiant aut ab integris arceantur, quia divisio unius aiusdē

Christ used no elevation at all, neither did his Disciples adore the Sacrament: you practise both. Lastly, Christ when hee said eate and drinke, truly reached the bread and cup to all which were present and thereby celebrated a Supper: you use the same words, eate and drinke you all of this: and yet eate and drinke all your selves. And call you this inviting Gods people to a Supper where you eate up all and they feed nothing but their eyes?

                  M. Featley.
               Thus I frame my argument. Christ in these words, This is my Body, 
                  1 Argu. called bread his body (for hee tooke bread, and brake it, and said, take, eate this pointing to the bread:) but bread cannot be called Christs body properly, therefore you must needs acknowledge

there is a figure in these words, and by consequence they make not for, much lesse make any Transubstantiation of bread into Christs body.

which have alwaies beene approved for Orthodoxall even by your own Church. Your answer to Tertullian neither satisfieth the place, nor avoideth my argument, for he proveth not onely by the words of Ieremy in the Old Testament, but of Christs also in the Gospell, the bread was and is a figure of Christs body. His argument standeth thus: Christ by the Prophet Ieremie called his body bread Tertul. l.

The bread taken and distributed unto his Disciples, he made it his body, saying, This is my body, that is, a figure of my body. A little after he propoundeth this question, why doth he call bread his body. Out of which places I thus argue against your answer. Tertullian saith that Dominus in Evangelio. Christ in the Gospell called the bread which he brake and distributed unto his Disciples, his body: and therefore hee

speaketh not of that which was bread in the old Law and you suppose to bee Christs body in the new, but of that which was very bread then, when hee called it his body: But I inferre that which is truly bread, cannot be properly called Christs body, Ergo you must reject Tertullian, or admit of a figure.

               Prove that bread cannot properly be called Christs Body.

               No disparata can be properly affirmed one of the other.
               Bread and Christs body are disparata. Ergo
               
               The one of them cannot properly be affirmed one of the other.

               Nay for that very reason rather, they are disparata, because they are not sub eodem genere. The especiall difference betweene Contraria and Disparata is, that contraria are sub eodem genere proximo, disparata may be sub diversis as homo &amp; lapis, corpus Christi &amp; panis, the one sub corpore animato, the other sub inanimato.

                  Gratian? answer directly: say you Christs body is truly and really broken in the proper acception of the word? if not so, then you must acknowledge a figure in the word frangitur: if you say that Christs body is truly and really broken in the proper acception of the word, you gainesay the Scripture and go against your owne beliefe.
            
            
               D. B.
               Christs body is truly broken, for he saith so, which is broken.
            
            
               M. F.
               Christs body was whole when he administred the Sacraments, therefore it was not broken.
            
            
               D. B.
               It was whole in se, but broken sub speciebus.
               
            
            
               
               M. F.
               That which is whole and entire sub speciebus is not broken sub speciebus. Christs body according to the Canons of the Councell of Trent is whole, sub speciebus and in qualibet parte specierum, and is entirely eaten of every Communicant, Ergo it is not broken sub speciebus.
               
            
            
               D. B.

               D. B.
               I say Christs body which is whole in se sub speciebus, is not broken in se sub speciebus, but alio respectu.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               The species or accidents are not Christs body, neither can they be broken truly and properly, especially being without a subject as you hold they are in the Sacrament: therefore if Christs body be truly broken sub speciebus, as you affirme, it must needs be broken in s

your selfe fast enough. Answer this argument I pray directly.
               That which is whole in se sub speciebus is not broken in se sub speciebus at the same time.
               But the Body of Christ is whole in se sub speciebus, for whosoever receives the body of Christ sub speciebus, receives it wholy and entirely and cannot doe otherwise, because Christ as your Church teacheth us, is totus in toto, and totus in qualibet parte hostis.
               
               Therefore Christs body is not broken in se sub speciebus.
               
            
            
               D. B.

               M. F.
               If the Major be false, the concontradictorie thereof must needs be true, which is this, that which is whole in se sub speciebus, is broken in se sub speciebus at one and the same time.
               
               Let this Proposition of M. D. Bagshawes be written. That which is whole in se sub speciebus, at one and the selle same time, is broken in se sub speciebus, a flat contradiction.
               After this proposition was taken in writing by M, Arscot, and M. Ashly, M. Featley proceeded to a new argument.
            
            
               
               M. F.
               The words used in the consecration of the cup are figurative, therefore 2 Argu. no ground in them for your reall presence of Christs blood in the cup.
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  They are not figurative but proper.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               These are the words. This cup is the New Testament in my blood, but these cannot be expounded but by a double figure: Ergo the words of the institution concerning the cup are figurative.
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  They are not the words of the institution.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               S. Luke Chap. 22. v. 20. and Saint Paul relate them for the words of the Institution, will you disparage them as you did Gratian and S. Austin before?
            
            
               D. B.
               S. Matthew and S. Marke have other words, hic est sanguis, &amp;c. This is the blood of the New Testament.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               Others in sound, not in sense. All Christians are bound under the paine of damnation to beleeve that all the Evangelists who were inspired by the Holy Ghost, have faithfully set downe Christs speeches and actions. S. Luke and Saint Paul affirme that Christ used these words, dare you impeach their authority?

               Yes, a double one, one in Calix, another in Testamentum. We drink not properly the cup, neither is that which we drinke in the cup properly Christs Testament.

I take it you granted it on Saturday last, as did also D Smith in my disputation with him (D. Stevens ingenuously here confessed as much, and said he would maintaine it.) I leave D. Stevens to confute you M. D. Bagshaw, touching the cup. I proove there is a figure in Testamentum. Either there is a figure in Testamentum, or that which is contained in the Chalice is propriè Testamentum, Christs last will: but that which is contained in the Chalice is not propriè Testamentum, or Christs will or Testament, Ergo there is a figure in the word Testamentum.
               
            
            
               
               D. B.
               
                  It is properly a Testament.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               I proove the contrarie: Christ made his Testament at his last Supper as you grant, but hee made not then his blood, his blood therefore is not his Testament.
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  He made his blood at his last Supper.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               Write this downe also. Christ made his blood at his last Supper. Was not his blood made and in his veines before?
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  It was: but till then he made it not potable.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               To make a thing potable, is not to make it blood. If his blood were his Testament which hee made at his last Supper, it followeth that hee made it then truly as he made his Testament truly. But to goe on forward directly against your answer, Christ made not his blood potable at his last Supper.
               That he made potable (if hee mad
                     •…
                   any thing potable at his last Supper) which he put in and powred out of the Chalice.
               But that was not his blood.
               
                  Ergo he made not his blood potable at his last Supper.
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  It was his very blood.
               
            
            
               
               M. F.
               His very blood therefore was then truly shed.
            
            
               D. B.
               What of that?
            
            
               M. F.
               Therefore your sacrifice of the Masse which your Church acknowledgeth to be incruentum unbloody is truly bloody.
            
            
               D. B.
               How doth this follow?
            
            
               M. F.
               Most clearely and evidently as you may see in this Syllogisme.
               That sacrifice in which blood is truly shed, is truly blood.
               But in the sacrifice of the Masse (as you have already granted me) the blood of Christ is truly shed and powred out.
               
               
                  Ergo your sacrifice of the Masse is truly a bloody sacrifice.
            
            
               D. B.
               Your Major is not currant, unlesse you add thereunto externally.
            
            
               M. F.
               As if a man could not truly bleed inwardly, my conclusion is not, the sacrifice of the Masse is a bloody sacrifice externally, or visibly, but truly, which is sufficiently inferred out of the premises without your addition. For certainely blood truly shed and sacrificed, makes a truly bloody sacrifice.
            
            
               D. B.
               I told you before blood could not be

truly shed unlesse it were externally shed.
            
            
               M. F.
               And did not I also tell you of a veine bleeding inwardly.
            
            
               D. B.
               Though the veine bleed inwardly, that is within the body, yet the blood commeth out of the veine.
            
            
               M. F.
               And so must Christs blood also if it be truly powred out: for fusio is motio, and effusio is extra fusio, therefore if Christs blood be truly powred out, it must needs run out of his veines.
            
            
               D. B.
               Every naturall effusion is a motion, but this is a supernaturall effusion.
            
            
               M. F.
               Every effusion is essentially a motion, if it be a naturall effusion, it is a naturall motion, if a supernaturall effusion a supernaturall motion.
            
            
               D. B.
               I admit of a supernaturall motion.
            
            
               M. F.
               Therfore you admit of a passing of Christs blood from one place to another, which cannot be as long as it remaines in his veines.
            
            
               D. B.
               Why so? cannot Christs blood be powred out of the cup, unlesse it stirre out of his veines?
            
            
               M. F.
               Not possibly, unlesse you will say the flesh and bones are powred out together with it, and by a consequence that you drink properly flesh and bones

in the chalice which I thus demonstrate.
               All that is in the Chalice you truly and properly drinke.
               But the veines, flesh, and bones of Christ you grant are in the Chalice, by saying that the blood is there in the veines.
               
                  Ergo you drinke properly flesh and bones.
            
            
               D. B.
               These are grosse and Capernaiticall arguments, unworthy to be urged by Christians.
            
            
               M. F.
               Sir, speake in your conscience, whither you thinke we come nearer to the Capernaits, who teach a spirituall eating of Christ by faith, according to those words of our Saviour, My words are spirit and life, or you who teach a carnall eating of him with the mouth and teeth? was not this the very errour of the Capernaites?
            
            
               D. B.
               Nothing lesse: for the Capernaites supposed Christs flesh should have been cut and quartered and sold in the market.
            
            
               M. F.
               This is your grosse fancie of the Capernaits error, the Scripture chargeth them with no other error, but such as arose from the misconstruction of Christs words, unlesse you eate my flesh, which

they understood according to the letter that killeth, not according to the spirit which quickneth. Now the letter of these words implieth no such thing as cutting or selling Christs flesh in the shambles: only it importeth a reall and proper eating, which consisteth in taking flesh into the mouth, chamming of it, and swallowing it downe the throat into the stomack. All this you doe, are you not then true Capernaites?
            
            
               D. B.
               For shame leave these idle and foolish collections of yours.
            
            
               M. F.
               I should easily returne the like speeches upon you, but I feare to abuse the patience of this Honourable Assembly, through our impatience, I thought to have spared you, but since you have provoked me so farre, I charge you with a speech of yours. This blood is blood in my blood, which you gave me at our last Conference for the true exposition of these words. This cup is the New Testament in my blood, are you not ashamed of such an absurd Commentarie?
            
            
               D. B.
               The congruity of this exposition I have maintained in writing, and I have long expected your replie.

               You should oppose Cardinall Bellarmine and others of your own side, you should demolish one of the strongest pillars of Transubstantiation, if not the doctrine it selfe of your carnall eating, for if those words of our Saviour Iohn 6. (unlesse you eate my flesh, &amp;c.) cannot be taken properly as S. Austin proveth by an invincible argument, it ensueth necessarily thereupon that the flesh of Christ cannot be properly eaten.

               D. B.
               I answer, that by non verum corpus he meaneth not visible, by not true, not visible.
            
            
               M. F.
               
                  Non verum corpus hoc est non visibile, a proper interpretation, as if nothing were true but that which is

visible: or as if Christ had two bodies, one visible which Chrysostome called his true body, and another invisible which must needs be his false body sith you oppose it to his true.
            
            
               D. B.
               I distinguish not so of Christs bodies, but of divers habitudes of one and the selfe same bodie, to wit, visibility and invisibility.
            
            
               M. F.
               You say then that Christs body is visible and invisible at the same time.
            
            
               D. B.
               Why not?
            
            
               M. F.
               And in the same place too? to wit, at the Table?
            
            
               D. B.
               What of all this?
            
            
               M. F.
               
                  Nothing but this apparant contradiction. That one and the selfe same body at the selfe same time in the selfe same place, may be visible and invisible to the same persons.
            
            
               D. B.
               This is no contradiction, because I say not that his body is visible and invisible respectu ejusdem.

               D. B.
               
                  Ejusdem habitudinis or modi existendi, the body of Christ as he sate at the Table was visible in it selfe, but invisible sub speciebus under the formes of bread and wine.
            
            
               M. F.
               If the species cover Christs body and hide it from sight, how say you that they are visible signes to represent Christs body and set it before our eyes? visible signes you must needs make them, or you have none in your Sacrament, for the bread according to your doctrine remaineth not, and Christs body is the thing signified, not therefore the signe. When Drusius in his defence against a nimble Jesuit that called him heretick, alleadged that heresie must be in fundamentis fidei, in foundations of faith, the Iesuit replied, that even that assertion of his was heresie. I may with farre greater reason replie upon your distinction of extra species &amp; sub speciebus,
                  
whereby you seeke to avoid a contradiction, that even this very distinction of yours implieth a manifest contradiction, to wit, that the selfe same body the same time is sub speciebus &amp; extra species, under the formes and without the formes, is within the formes of bread and wine and without. If Christs body at the same time may be sub speciebus and extra species, it may bee under the formes and not under the formes, sub speciebus and non sub speciebus. Is not this a contradiction?
            
            
               D. B.
               No, because he is not sub speciebus and extra species in the same place.
            
            
               M. F.
               Who ever required identitatem loci to make a contradiction? are not these propositions contradictorie? Deus vivit, Deus non vivit, Angelus movet, Angelus non movet. Anima est in corpore, Anima non est in corpore: and yet in none of all these propositions there is any respect at all to place; The affirmation and negation ejusdem de eodem, ad idem secundum idem eodem 
                  Arist. Elench. 
                  tempore is a contradiction: but in these propositions, Christus est sub speciebus, Christus non est sub speciebus, the same thing, to wit,

                  esse sub speciebus is affirmed and denied of the same thing, to wit, of Christ, secundum idem, viz. according to the same nature and part of him, to wit, his body ad idem, to wit, with a reference to the selfe same accidents numero. And lastly, in eodem tempore, to wit, at the instant after the prolation of these words, hoc est corpus meum, &amp;c.
            
            
               D. B.
               The respect to diverse places is sufficient to salve the sormer propositions from contradiction. What urge you Aristotle in matter of faith above reason.
            
            
               M. F.
               I urge not Aristotle for any matter of faith, but for a question of Logick touching the nature of contradictions, but because you so sleighten Aristotles authority, I proove it by reason, that a body cannot be in divers places, sub speciebus &amp; extra species, under the formes and without the formes: it cannot at all be in divers places, therefore not in such or such a manner.
            
            
               D. B.
               How proove you that?
            
            
               M. F.
               By this argument.

                     One body cannot be divided and severed from it selfe.
                     But if it be in the same time put in divers places distant one from

another, it must needs be severed and divided from it selfe.
                     
                        Ergo one and the selfe same body cannot be put in diverse places at the selfe same time.
                  
               
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  Divided and severed I grant you, respectu loci, non respectu substantiae, in respect of place not of substance.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               If the place be severed, I cannot conceive but that the substance that is in those severed places must needs be severed.
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  This you are to prove.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               Thus I prove it.
               Those things betweene which there is a great space or way, and many bodies and substances interposed; are really severed, and discontinued.
               But betweene the Hosts consecrated at Rome and Paris, there is a great space or way, and many bodies interposed.
               
                  Ergo the Hosts consecrated at Rome and at Paris are really severed and discontinued bodies.
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  I denie your Syllogisme.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               Marke it once againe, this is the Major. Those things betweene which,

                  &amp;c. But the Hosts consecrated at Rome and Paris, are those things betweene which, &amp;c. Ergo, &amp;c.
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  They are not those things betweene which many bodies are interposed.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               Is it not a great way, and are there not many bodies interposed betweene this and Rome.
               
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  I grant you that, but I denie that the Hosts consecrated at Rome and Paris are things.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               Betweene one thing therefore, and it selfe, many bodies may be interposed. But if divers wafers consecrated by divers Priests, in divers places, be not divers things, I know not what things you will call divers. I perceive it will be to little purpose to reason with you by arguments drawne from reason, for you will make good any absurdity in reason by your faith. What answer you to the words of your owne Masse which you say every day. 4 Argu.

D. will not answer to the words he readeth every day in the Masse: doe you make as little reckoning of the customes of the ancient Church, as you did of the Canons and Constitutions of the present Church of Rome set downe in the Masse.
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  What an idle thing is this in you to urge the customes of the Church, a morall argument in a theologicall controversie.
               
            
            
               
               M. F.
               Your exception were plausible, if I purposed to urge a morall or civill custome. I make an inference upon religious customes of the ancient Church, whereby a man may as certainely gather what their opinion and judgement was touching this point, as by their words. Evagrius saith, that at Constantinople

                  they called children from the schoole and distributed the remainder of the Sacrament among them. Hesychius l. 2. in Levit. c. 8. speaketh yet of a more strange custome of casting it into the fire.
               
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  What collect you from these customes?
               
            
            
               M. F.
               That they thought not the Sacrament to be Christs very body, but only a mysterie of it.
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  I see not any force in this consequence, conclude Syllogistically.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               
                  
                      That which the ancients distributed to children, cast into the fire, they beleeved not to be the body of Christ farther then in a mysterie.
                     But the remainder of the Sacrament after the Communion they disposed of as above.
                     
                        Ergo they beleeved it not to bee

the very body of their Lord and Saviour farther then in a mysterie.
                  
               
            
            
               D. B.
               I make doubt of your Major.
            
            
               M. F.
               I marvaile how you can make any doubt of it? for if they had beleeved, as you do the Sacrament to be the very body of Christ, by way of Transubstantiation: they had grievously sinned against their conscience in thus using or rather abusing the Lords body.
            
            
               D. B.
               How proove you that?
            
            
               M. F.
               It is a sin to give Christs body to children that cannot discerne it: a greater sin by farre to cast it into the fire: I say to cast the remainder of the Sacrament into the fire, holding it to be the very body of Christ in your sense, otherwise holding it to bee but the figure or Sacrament of Christs body, they might burne it without sin, in imitation of the Israelites, who by the commandement of God burnt the remainder of the Paschall Lamb, which was a figure of Christ.
            
            
               D. B.
               You answer your selfe, as you say the Iewes burnt the remainder of the Paschall Lambe to prevent worse inconveniencies, so the ancient Church might cast Christs body in the Sacrament into the fire in a reverence to it.
            
            
               
               M. F.
               A strange kinde of reverence to throw a man (especially alive) into the fire.
            
            
               D. B.
               If the figure of Christ might bee burnt in reverence, his body might with greater reverence.
            
            
               M. F.
               I scarce beleeve (M. D.) that you thinke a man should doe you a greater reverence, to cast you into the fire, then to burne your picture.
               I see by my watch, that the two houres allotted for me to dispute are neare past, and therefore I knit up the foure arguments which I purposed to prosecute at large in three breefe questions. 1. What doth the mouse eate that lighteth upon a piece of bread or drop of wine consecrated?
            
            
               D. B.
               The forme of bread returneth againe by a miracle.
            
            
               M. F.
               
                  Peter Lombard propounding this doubt: quid ergo mus comedit? answereth, Deus novit, God knoweth. Aquinas resolveth it against you.

                     . And so doth your church, saying, si mus corpus Domini comederit, if a mouse eate the body of Christ.
            
            
               D. B.
               What tell you me of Aquinas?
            
            
               M. F.
               I must be briefe, that I may not defraud the Auditorio of your arguments.

My second question is: what is that you call the consecrated Host? the 6 Argu. bread is not the Host, because it is not offered, the body of Christ is not the Host, and I trust you will not say the accidents are the Host.
            
            
               D. B.
               Christs body is the Host.
            
            
               M. F.
               Christs body is not offered, therefore it is not the Host.
            
            
               D. B.
               It is offered.
            
            
               M. F.
               That is offered which is consecrated: Christs body is not consecrated: therefore it is not offered.
            
            
               D. B.
               I denie your Major.
            
            
               M. F.
               I had thought, you had held, that you offer a thing consecrated. What is consecrated, sith Christs body is not?
            
            
               D. B.
               The bread.
            
            
               M. F.
               The bread remaineth not after consecration, and Christs body you confesse, is not consecrated by the Priest: therefore you have no consecrated Host.
            
            
               D. B.
               The bread is consecrated to be offered, because it is consecrated to bee made Christs body, which is offered.
            
            
               M. F.
               Your answer in a word to my 7 Argu. third demand. What becommeth of Christs body in the stomack? doth it remaine there still? then you have Christs

body at this time within you. And what need you often receive his body, if you have it still within you? doth it goe out of the stomack? when and which way? Is it turned into the substance of our body? or evaporeth into ayre? or is it altogether annihilated?
            
            
               D. B.
               None of all these. But it ceaseth to be, as the soule in a part of the body that is cut off from the rest.
            
            
               M. F.
               
                  Chius ad Choum. I speake of a body, you answer of a soule. The soule of a man, because it is a spirituall substance, may in an instant invisibly disfuse it selfe through the whole body, and contract it selfe in like manner, when a part is cut off, or rather stay her influxe into that part; but a bodie that hath parts of quantity and soliditie of substance cannot penetrate another body, nor quit the former place, but by a true locall motion, visible and divisible, and that in time.
            
            
               D. B.
               Christs body is more spirituall then our soule.
            
            
               M. F.
               What, according to the substance? If Christs body bee more spirituall then our soule, it must needs be a Spirit. for we speake not now of qualities or spirituall graces? Note this by the way. It savoureth of heresie. Let me bee so

much beholding to you, before I leave, to get of you a direct answer to this Syllogisme.
               Every bodily substance truly existent in a place, that neither abideth in that place, nor removeth to another, nor is changed into something els, is truly annihilated or brought to nought or nothing.
               The body of Christ, according to your beliefe, was really existent in the stomack, and neither continueth there still, neither goeth out of the stomack, neither is converted into another substance or thing.
               
                  Ergo it is there truly annihilated.
            
            
               D. B.
               Thus you dispute: Christs body is annihilated in the stomacke. Ergo it is annihilated simpliciter, I denie your argument.
            
            
               M. F.
               You denie your owne argument not mine. I undertooke not to proove that Christs body is annihilated simpliciter, simply, but that it is annihilated in the stomacke, which it seemes you denie not, nor can, standing to your owne grounds. Yet because you are so briefe with me, thus I proove the argument.
               That which is made absolutely nothing

in the stomacke, cannot be something elsewhere.
               Christs body as you grant is turned into nothing in the stomack.
               
                  Ergo it cannot be something elsewhere.
            
            
               D. B.
               Your Major is most false.
            
            
               M. F.
               That which is made simply nothing, is yet something. Nothing is a contradiction, if this be not.

                  led off from farther objecting, D. Bagshaw opposeth as followeth.
            
            
               D. B.
               Christs body may be in more places at once. Ergo it is in the Sacrament.
            
            
               M. F.
               I denie your argument.
            
            
               D. B.
               This is the reason why you denie Christs body to be in the Sacrament, because you suppose it cannot be in more places at once. Ergo if it may be in more places at once it may be in heaven and in the Sacrament.
            
            
               
               M. F.
               This argument as little followes as the former. Ex particulari non fas est Syllogizare. Though this reason were not good, yet we have many other strong and invincible.
            
            
               D. B.
               
                  It is no wickednesse to eat Christs flesh in the Sacrament. Ergo your argument drawne from the impiety of eating Christs flesh with the mouth is of no force.
               
            
            
               M. F.
               S. Austin indeed alleadgeth this for a reason, to proove that Christs words, unlesse you eate my flesh, Ioh. 6. cannot be meant properly, but figuratively, because it is an horrible wickednesse to eate the flesh of a live man. I approve of this reason and will maintaine it. Yet if you could overthrow it, it would not prove your argument: you know Aristotle distinguisheth inter argumenta 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   &amp; 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . These arguments of yours, if you could prove them, are but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , they are not 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , they demonstrate not the conclusion of your faith, that Christ is really and corporally in the Sacrament. At the most they prove but that he might be in the Sacrament, for ought they bring to the contrarie that insist upon the former reasons. Let us heare one Syllogisme from you.
            
            
               
               D. B.
               The words of Christ are litterally to be taken, except you can bring some just exception against the literall exposition.
               But you can bring no just exception against the literall exposition.
               
                  Ergo the words of the institution are litterally to be understood, and by consequence the Sacrament is Christs true body.
            
            
               M. F.
               All the arguments I have hitherto used, are so many exceptions against the literall exposition. But to restraine you to some certaine reasons, I say the words of the institution cannot be taken properly, because all the circumstances of the Text are against it: first, Christ took bread and brake it, &amp; pointing to it, said, This is my body, and he added, doe tlois in remembrance of me. And after he had given the cup, said, I will drinke no more of this fruit of the vine. From all which circumstances many strong arguments may be drawne. Bread cannot properly be Christs body. Christs body cannot be given in remembr
                     •…
                  nce of it selfe. That which is the fruit of the vine is not properly Christs blood. Moreover, Christ in these words, This is my body, instituted a

Sacrament, and therefore this sacred forme of speech is to be mystically and Sacramentally understood, answerable to the like used in the matter of Sacraments. Gen. 17. 10. This is my Covenant, speaking of Circumcision which was but a signe of the Covenant. Exod. 12. 11. It is the Lords Passeover, speaking of the Lambe, which was but a figure of the Passeover, 1 Cor. 10. The Rock was Christ, that is a figure of Christ. Luk. 22. this cup is the New Testament, that is, a sacred signe or memorial of the New Testament. The literall exposition of the words is repugnant to the Articles of our faith, clearely deduced from those words of our Saviour, Ioh 16. I leave the world and go to the Father, where it followeth immediatly now thou speakest plainely, now thou usest no parable. It is said, Act. the 3. that the heavens must containe Christ, according to his humane nature, till his second comming. Now if Christ, according to
                     •…
                  is humane nature have lest the world, he is not in the world: if he be contained in the heavens, then he is not without the leavens upon the earth.
            
            
               D. B.
               Thus I overthrow your reason. Christs body was contained in heaven

after his Ascention, and there he remaines.
               And yet he was since that upon earth and stood by S. Paul, Acts 23. 11.
               
                  Ergo your strongest argument hath no force at all.

                     liarner. yours also understand those words Act. 3. of the ordinary residence of Christ not denying that Christ if he pleased might extraordinarily and miraculously leave his place in heaven for a while, to doe some great work upon earth: which as it breaketh the force of your argument, so it no way disableth mine; For if heaven be the place of Christs ordinarie residence, it followeth that he is not daily and ordinarily according to the substance of his body, upon earth, to wit, on the Altar as you beleeve, Secondly, I answer to your Minor, that S. Paul Act. 23. speaketh of a vision in the night, not of any reall or corporall presence of Christ.
            
            
               D. B.
               He saith, that the Lord stood by him, and spake unto him, therefore it was no vision.

               I denie your argument. S. Peter saith, Act. 10. that he saw heaven opened,

                  Tobia, and yet all this was but done in a vision, nay the same word (

               D. B.
               
                  S. Luke saith, Act. 23. 11. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which is the very word S. Paul useth, Act. 22. 13. where he speaketh of Ananias comming unto him. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . But Ananias truly stood by S. Paul, not in vision only. Ergo Christ likewise stood by him, and did not onely appeare so to do.
            
            
               M. F.
               The same word in divers places of Scripture may be diversly taken, according to the diversity of the matter and circumstances of the Text.
               
                  Ananias was a man that could not otherwise present himselfe to S. Paul then by comming to him &amp; visibly standing by him, Christ by his divine power might.
               
                  
Besides Ananias was not in heaven, but upon earth, &amp; therfore he might stand by S. Paul visibly &amp; locally, without any miracle or apparition. But Christ, as we are both agreed, was at this present in heaven, sitting at the right hand of the Father, &amp; therfore could not otherwise be present with S. Paul, then in spirit, or by vision, which I am induced to beleeve the rather, because the Text saith, this was done in the night, the most proper time for a vision. The night following, the Lord stood by him, and said, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               D. B.
               This is petere principium, you suppose that which is in question, to wit, that Christ could not at the same time be really present in body in heaven and in earth.
            
            
               M. F.
               I never heard that an answer could petere principium in dissolving an Argument. Petere principium in my understanding is to beg that to be granted to a man which he ought to prove. A respondent, as a respondent, is not to proove, but to hold and maintaine his own grounds against contrarie oppositions. The burthen of prooving lieth now upon you, M. Doctor, refell mine interpretations if you can, or make it appeare by some other argument, that Christ since his Ascention hath beene truly upon earth in body.
            
            
               D. B.
               S. Paul truly saw him and heard him, Acts 9. 22,

               The Argument followeth not S. Paul truly saw Christ, therfore Christ was truly upon earth.
            
            
               D B.
               S. Paul being upon earth could not see Christ in heaven; Ergo if he truly saw Christ, he saw him upon earth, if he truly saw him upon earth, he was truly upon earth.

                  see Christ in heaven, as well as S. Steven, Act. 7. v. 55, 56. Steven being full of the Holy Ghost looked stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Iesus standing at the right hand of God, and said, behold I see the heavens opened, &amp; the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.
            
            
               D. B.
               S. Stevens might be a vision. I proove my proposition. The senses of our bodie cannot apprehend an object so farre distant, as is the heaven from the earth: therfore S. Paul being upon earth, could not see Christ in heaven with his bodily eyes.
            
            
               M. F.
               Do we not see the Sun in the heaven, and it is said that the face of Christ in his transfiguration shone like the Sun: but my direct answer to your proposition is, that howsoever the eyes of S. Paul and S. Steven by the strength of nature could not apprehend Christ sitting at the

hand of his Father in heaven, yet being miraculously enlightened &amp; elevated as the Schooles speake, by divine vertue, they might easily. Heere M. D. Bagshaw at the first undertook to proove, that sense elevated could not discerne a thing so farre off. But afterwards perceiving it to be a matter of too great difficulty to proove, took advantage of a Popish Gentlemans speech, that helpt him out with a falshood, saying, the proposition to bee prooved was not, that sense elevated could not apprehend an object so farre off, but that S. Pauls senses were not elevated, which though it were an untruth, as many there present testified, yet M. Featley to gra

                  fie M. D. Bagshaw left of his hold, and gave M. D. Bagshaw leave to proove the proposition he desired, to wit, that S. Pauls senses were not elevated, which he endevoured to do after this manner.
            
            
               D. B.

                  ames, then of all the Apostles, last of all he was seene also of me. But the other Apostles saw Christ with their senses not elevated. Ergo S. Paul saw him without any elevation of sense.
            
            
               M. F.
               S. Paul though his senses were helped, saw him as truly as any of the other. A man by helpe of a perspective may discerne an object farther off, yet sees as truly and more certainly then without the same.

               This must needs be the meaning of the words, the latter words (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) cannot be referred in any tolerable construction to any other word then 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . And therfore 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   here signifieth Christs blood, which he saith, is the New Testament in his blood. And with these words he arose from his chaire, and brake off the disputation.

               I held it fit for the satisfaction of those vvho desire to knovv the truth to add to his former answer First, that Saint Basil in moral reg. 21. c. 3. readeth the words in S. Luke 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and not as they and we now reade, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   Secondly, that admitting the words to be so read as our adversaries vvould have them, I say yet still these words (which is shed for you) must be referred to Christs blood, as S. Matthew and S Mark referre them, and for the Grammaticall construction we have the like, Apoc. 8. 9.
