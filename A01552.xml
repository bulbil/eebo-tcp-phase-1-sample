            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  To the Reader.
                  HAuing had the Honour to be continually
with my Lord, in compiling
of this Worke; And to be employed
therein; I haue thought it
not amisse, (with his Lordships
good leaue and liking,) for the better satisfaction
of those that shall reade it, to make knowne somewhat
of his Lordships Intentions, touching the
Ordering, and Publishing of the same. I haue
heard his Lordship often say; that if hee should
haue serued the glory of his owne Name, he had
been better not to haue published this Naturall
History: For it may seeme an Indigested Heap
of Particulars; And cannot haue that Lustre,
which Bookes cast into Methods haue: But that
he resolued to preferre the good of Men, and
that which might best secure it, before any thing
that might haue Relation to Himselfe. And hee
knew well, that ther was no other way open, to
vnloose Mens mindes, being bound; and (as
it were) Maleficiate, by the Charmes of deceiuing
Notions, and Theories; and therby made

Impotent for Generation of VVorkes; But onely
no wher to depart from the Sense, and cleare experience;
But to keepe close to it, especially in the
beginning: Besides, this Naturall History was a
Debt of his, being Designed and set downe for a
third part of the Instauration. I haue also heard
his Lordship discourse, that Men (no doubt)
will thinke many of the Experiments conteined in
this Collection, to bee Vulgar and Triuiall;
Meane and Sordid; Curious and Fruitlesse: And
therfore he wisheth, that they would haue perpetually
before their Eyes, what is now in doing;
And the Difference betweene this Naturall History,
and others. For those Naturall Histories,
which are Extant, being gathered for Delight and
Vse, are full of pleasant Descriptions and Pictures;
and affect and seeke after Admiration, Rarities,
and Secrets. But contrariwise, the Scope which
his Lordship intendeth, is to write such a Naturall
History, as may be Fundamentall to the Erecting
and Building of a true Philosophy: For the
Illumination of the Vnderstanding; the Extracting
of Axiomes; and the producing of many Noble
Works, and Effects. For he hopeth, by this meanes,
to acquit Himselfe of that, for which hee taketh
Himselfe in a sort bound; And that is, the Aduancement
of all Learning and Sciences. For hauing
in this present VVorke Collected the Materialls
for the Building; And in his Novum
Organum (of which his Lordship is yet to publish

a Second Part,) set downe the Instruments and
Directions for the Worke; Men shall now bee
wanting to themselues, if they raise not Knowledge
to that perfection, whereof the Nature of
Mortall men is capable. And in this behalfe, I
haue heard his Lordship speake complainingly;
That his Lordship (who thinketh hee deserueth
to be an Architect in this building,) should be forced
to be a VVork-man and a Labourer; And to
digge the Clay, and burne the Brick; And more
then that, (according to the hard Condition of the
Israelites at the latter end) to gather the Strawe
and Stubble, ouer all the Fields, to burn the Bricks
withall. For he knoweth, that except hee doe it,
nothing will be done: Men are so sett to despise
the Meanes of their owne good. And as for
the Basenes of many of the Experiments; As long
as they be Gods VVorks, they are Honourable
enough. And for the Vulgarnes of them; true Axiomes
must be drawne from plaine Experience,
and not from doubtfull; And his Lordships course
is, to make VVonders Plaine, and not Plaine
things VVonders; And that Experience likewise
must be broken and grinded, and not whole, or
as it groweth. And for Vse; his Lordship hath
often in his Mouth, the two kindes of Experiments;
Experimenta Fructifera, and Experimenta
Lucifera: Experiments of Vse, and Experiments
of Light; And he reporteth himself, whether he
were not a strange Man, that should thinke that

Light hath no Vse, because it hath no Matter.
Further, his Lordship thought good also, to add
vnto many of the Experiments themselues, some
Glosse of the Causes; that in the succeeding work of
Interpreting Nature, and Framing Axiomes, all
things may be in more Readines. And for the
Causes herein by Him assigned; his Lordship
perswadeth Himselfe, they are farr more certaine,
then those that are rendred by Others; Not for
any Excellency of his owne Witt, (as his Lordship
is wont to say) but in respect of his continuall
Conuersation with Nature, and Experience.
He did consider likewise, that by this Addition of
Causes, Mens mindes (which make so much hast
to find out the Causes of things;) would not think
themselues vtterly lost, in a Vast VVood of Experience,
but stay vpon these Causes, (such as they
are) a little, till true Axiomes may be more fully
discouered. I haue heard his Lordship say also,
that one great Reason, why he would not put
these Particulars into any exact Method, (though
he that looketh attentiuely into them, shall finde
that they haue a secret Order) was, because hee
conceiued that other men would now thinke,
that they could doe the like; And so goe on
with a further Collection: which if the Method
had been Exact, many would haue despaired to
attaine by Imitation. As for his Lordships loue
of Order, I can referr any Man to his Lordships
Latine Booke, De Augmentis Scientiarum;
                     
which (if my Iudgment be any thing) is written
in the Exactest Order, that I know any Writing
to bee. I will conclude with an vsuall Speech
of his Lordships.This Epistle is the same, that should haue been prefixed to this Booke, if his Lordship had liued. That this Worke of his Naturall
History, is the World, as GOD made it,
and not as Men haue made it; For that it hath
nothing of Imagination.

HISTORIE.
                  I. Century.
                  DIGG a Pitt vpon the Sea shore, somewhat aboue 
the High-water Marke, and sincke it as
deepe as the Low-Water marke; And as the Tide
commeth in, it will fill with Water, Fresh and Potable.Experiments in Consort, touching the Straining and Passing of Bodies, one through another: which they Call Percolation.
                     
This is commonly practized vpon the
Coast of Barbary, where other fresh Water is wanting.
And CAESAR knew this well, when he
was besieged in Alexandria: For by Digging
of Pitts in the Sea shoare, hee did frustrate the Laborious Workes of
the Enemies, which had turned the Sea-Water vpon the Wells of
Alexandria; And so saued his Army, being then in Desperation. But
Caesar mistooke the Cause, For he thought that all Sea-Sandes had Naturall
Springs of Fresh Water. But it is plaine, that it is the Sea-Water;
because the Pitt filleth according to the Measure of the Tide: And
the Sea-water passing or Strayning through the Sandes, leaueth the
Saltnesse.
                  I remember to haue Read, that Triall hath beene made of Salt Water
                     
passed through Earth; through Tenn Vessells, one within an other,
and yet it hath not lost his Saltnesse, as to become potable: But the
same Man saith, that (by the Relation of Another,) Salt Water drained
through twenty Vessells, hath become Fresh. This Experiment seemeth
to crosse that other of Pitts, made by the Sea side; And yet but in part,
if it be true, that twentie Repetitions doe the Effect. But it is worth the
Note, how poore the Imitations of Nature are, in Common course of
Experiments, except they be led by great Iudgement, and some good
Light of Axiomes. For first, ther is no small difference betweene a

Passage of Water through twenty small Vessells; And through such a
distance, as betweene the Low water, and High water Marke. Secondly,
there is a great difference betweene Earth and Sand. For all Earth
hath in it a kinde of Nitrous Salt, from which Sand is more free: And
besides Earth doth not straine the Water so finely, as Sand doth. But
ther is a Third Point, that I suspect as much, or more, then the other
Two: And that is, that in the Experiment of Transmission of the Sea-water
into the Pitts, the Water riseth; But in the Experiment of Transmission
of the Water through the Vessells, it falleth: Now certaine it
is, that the Salter Part of Water, (once Salted throughout) goeth to the
Bottome. And therfore no meruaile, if the Draining of Water by descent,
doth not make it fresh: Besides, I doe somewhat doubt, that the
very Dashing of the Water, that commeth from the Sea, is more proper
to strike of the Salt part, then wher the Water slideth of her owne
Motion.
                  
                      It seemeth Percolation or Transmission, (which is commonly called
Straining,) is a good kinde of Separation; Not onely of Thicke from
Thin, and Grosse from Fine,; But of more subtile Natures; And varieth
according to the Bodie through which the Transmission is made.
As if through a wollen Bagg, the Liquour leaueth the Fatnesse; If
through Sand, the Saltnesse; &amp;c. They speake of Seuering Wine from
Water, passing it through Iuy wood, or through other the like porous
Body; But Non Constat.
                  
                  
                      The Gumm of Trees (which wee see to be commonly shining and
cleare) is but a fine Passage or Straining of the Iuice of the Tree,
through the Wood and Bark. And in like manner, Cornish Diamonds,
and Rock Rubies, (which are yet more resplendent then Gumms) are the
fine Exudations of Stone.
                  
                  
                     
                     Aristotle giueth the Cause, vainely, why the Feathers of Birdes are
of more liuely Colours, then the Haires of Beastes; for no Beast hath any
fine Azure, or Carnation, or Greene Haire. He saith, It is, because
Birds are more in the Beames of the Sunn, then Beasts; But that is manifestly
vntrue; For Cattle are more in the Sun then Birds, that liue
commonly in the Woods, or in some Couert. The true Cause is, that
the Excrementious Moisture of liuing Creatures, which maketh as
well the Feathers in Birds, as the Haire in Beasts, passeth in Birds
through a finer and more delicate Strainer, then it doth in Beastes: For
Feathers passe through Quills; And Haire through Skin.
                  
                      The Clarifying of Liquors by Adhesion is an Inward Percolation; And
is effected, when some Cleauing Body is Mixed and Agitated with the
Liquours; wherby the grosser Part of the Liquor sticks to that Cleauing
Body; And so the finer Parts are freed from the Grosser. So the
Apothecaries clarify their Sirrupes by whites of Eggs, beaten with the
Iuices which they would clarify; which Whites of Eggs, gather all
the Dreggs and grosser Parts of the Iuyce to them; And after the Sirrupe
being sett on the Fire, the whites of Egges themselues harden, and

are taken forth. So Ippocrasse is clarified by mixing with Milke; And
stirring it about; And then passing it through a Wollen Bagge, which
they call Hippocrates Sleeue: And the Cleauing Nature of the Milke
draweth the Powder of the Spices, and Grosser parts of the Liquour to
it; And in the passage they stick vpon the Woollen Bagge.
                  The Clarifying of Water, is an Experiment tending to Health; besides 
the pleasure of the Eye, when Water is Crystaline. It is effected
by casting in and placing Pebbles, at the Head of a Current; that the
Water may straine through them.
                  It may be, Percolation doth not onely cause Clearenesse and Splendour,
but Sweetnes of Sauour; For that also followeth, as well as
Clearenes, when the Finer Parts are seuered from the Grosser. So it is
found, that the Sweates of Men that haue much Heat, and exercise
much, and haue cleane Bodies, and fine Skins, doe smell sweet; As was
said of Alexander; And we see, commonly, that Gumms haue sweet
Odours.
                  TAke a Glasse, and put Water into it, and wett your Finger, and draw
it round about the Lipp of the Glasse, pressing it somewhat hard;
And after you haue drawne it some few times about; it will make the
Water friske and sprinckle vp, in a fine Dew.Experiments in Consort touching Motion of Bodies vpon their Pressure.
                     
This Instance doth excellently
Demonstrate the Force of Compression in a Solid Body. For
whensoeuer a Solid Body (as Wood, Stone, Mettall, &amp;c.) is pressed,
ther is an inward Tumult in the parts therof; seeking to deliuer themselues
from the Compression: And this is the Cause of all Violent
Motion. Wherin it is strange in the highest Degree, that this Motion
hath neuer been obserued, nor inquired; It being of all Motions, the
most Common, and the Chiefe Roote of all Mechanicall Operations.
This Motion worketh in round at first, by way of Proofe, and Search,
which way to deliuer it selfe; And then worketh in Progresse, wher
it findeth the Deliuerance easiest. In Liquours this Motion is visible: For
all Liquours strucken make round Circles, and withall Dash; but in
Solids, (which breake not,) it is so subtile, as it is inuisible; But neuertheless
bewrayeth it selfe by many Effects; As in this Instance wherof
we speake. For the Pressure of the Finger furthered by the wetting
(because it sticketh so much the better vnto the Lipp of the Glasse,) after
some continuance, putteth all the small Parts of the Glasse, into
worke; that they strike the Water sharpely; from which Percussion
that Sprinkling commeth.
                  If you strike or pierce a Solid Body, that is brittle, as Glasse, or Sugar,
                     
it breaketh not onely, wher the immediate force is; but breaketh all about
into shiuers and fitters; The Motion, vpon the Pressure, searching
all wayes; and breaking where it findeth the Body weakest.
                  The Powder in Shot, being Dilated into such a Flame, as endureth not 
                     Compression; Moueth likewise in round, (The Flame being in the Nature
of a liquid Body:) Sometimes recoyling; Sometimes breaking the Piece;
                     
But generally discharging the Bullett, because ther it findeth easiest Deliuerance.
                  
                      This Motion vpon Pressure, and the Reciprocall therof, which is
Motion vpon Tensure; we vse to call (by one common Name) Motion of Libertie; which is, when any Body, being forced to a Preter-Naturall
Extent, or Dimension, deliuereth and restoreth it selfe to the Naturall:
As when a Blowne Bladder (Pressed) riseth againe; or when
Leather or Cloath tentured spring backe. These two Motions (of which
ther be infinite Instances,) we shall handle in due place.
                  
                      This Motion vpon Pressure is excellently also demonstrated in Sounds;
As when one Chimeth vpon a Bell, it soundeth; But as soon as he layeth
his hand vpon it, the Sound ceaseth: And so, the Sound of a Virginall
String, as soone as the Quill of the Iack falleth vpon it, stoppeth. For
these Sounds are produced, by the subtile Percussion of the Minute
parts, of the Bell, or String, vpon the Aire; All one, as the Water is
caused to leape by the subtile Percussion of the Minute parts of the
Glasse, vpon the Water, wherof we spake a little before in the 9th.
Experiment. For you must not take it to be, the locall Shaking of the
Bell, or String, that doth it. As we shall fully declare, when we come hereafter to handle Sounds.
                  
                  TAke a Glasse with a Belly and a long Nebb; fill the Belly (in part)
with Water: Take also another Glasse, whereinto put Claret Wine
and Water mingled; Reverse the first Glasse, with the Belly vpwards,
Stopping the Nebb with your fingar; Then dipp the Mouth of it within
the Second Glasse, and remoue your Fingar: Continue it in that
 posture for a time; And it will vnmingle the VVine from the Water:
The VVine ascending and setling in the topp of the vpper Glasse; And
the VVater descending and setling in the bottome of the lower Glasse.
                     Experiments in Consort touching Separations of Bodies by Weight
                     
The passage is apparent to the Eye; For you shall see the VVine, as it
were, in a small veine, rising through the VVater. For handsomnesse
sake (because the Working requireth some small time) it were good
you hang the vpper Glasse vpon a Naile. But as soone as ther is gathered
so much pure and vnmixed water in the Bottome of the Lower
Glasse, as that the Mouth of the vpper Glasse dippeth into it, the Motion
ceaseth
                  
                      Let the Vpper Glasse be VVine, and the Lower VVater; ther followeth
no Motion at all. Lett the Vpper Glasse be VVater pure, the Lowwer
VVater coloured; or contrariwise; ther followeth no Motion at all.
But it hath been tried, that though the Mixture of VVine and VVater,
in the Lower Glasse, be three parts VVater, and but one VVine; yet it
doth not dead the Motion. This Separation of VVater and VVine appeareth
to be made by Weight; for it must be of Bodies of vnequall Weight,
or ells it worketh not; And the Heauier Body must euer be in the vpper
Glasse. But then note withall, that the VVater being made pensile, and
ther being a great VVeight of VVater in the Belly of the Glasse, sustained

by a small Pillar of VVater in the Neck of the Glasse; It is that, which
sesteth the Motion on worke: For VVater and VVine in one Glasse, with
long standing, will hardly seuer.
                  This Experiment would be Extended from Mixtures of seuerall Liquors,
                     
to Simple Bodies, which Consist of seuerall Similare Parts: Try
it therfore with Broyne or Salt water, and Fresh water; Placing the Salt
water (which is the heauier) in the vpper Glasse; And see whether the
Fresh will come aboue. Try it also with VVater thick Sugred, and Pure
water; and see whether the water which commeth aboue, will loose his
Sweetnes: For which purpose it were good ther were a little Cock
made in the Belly of the vpper Glasse.
                  
                  IN Bodies containing Fine Spirits, which doe easely dissipate, when
you make Infusions, the Rule is; A short Stay of the Body in the Liquour
receyueth the Spiritt; And a longer Stay confoundeth it; because
it draweth forth the Earthy Part withall; which embaseth the
finer.Experiments in Consort touching Iudicious &amp; Accurate Infusions, both in Liquors, and Aire.
                      And therfore it is an Errour in Phisicians, to rest simply vpon the
Length of stay, for encreasing the vertue. But if you will haue the Infusion
strong, in those kinde of Bodies, which haue fine Spiritts, your 
way is, not to giue Longer time, but to repeat the Infusion of the Body
oftner. Take Violetts, and infuse a good Pugill of them in a Quart of
Vineger; Lett them stay three quarters of an houre, and take them
forth; And refresh the Infusion with like quantity of new Violetts, seuen
times; And it will make a Vineger so fresh of the Flower, as if a
Twelue-moneth after, it be brought you in a Saucer, you shall smell it
before it come at you. Note, that it smelleth more perfectly of the
Flower, a good while after, then at first.
                  This Rule, which wee haue giuen, is of singular vse, for the Preparations 
of Medecines, and other Infusions. As for Example; the Leafe of
Burrage hath an Excellent Spiritt, to represse the fuliginous Vapour
of Dusky Melancholy, and so to cure Madnes: But neuerthelesse, if
the Leafe be infused long, it yieldeth forth but a raw substance, of no
Vertue; Therfore I suppose, that if in the Must of Wine, or Wort of
Beere, while it worketh, before it be Tunned, the Burrage stay a small
time, and be often changed with fresh; It will make a Soueraigne
Drink for Melancholy Passions. And the like I conceyue of Orenge
Flowers.
                  
                  
                     Rubarb hath manifestly in it Parts of contrary Operations: Parts that 
purge; And parts that binde the body: And the first lay looser, and
the latter lay deeper: So that if you infuse Rubarb for an houre, and
crush it well, it will purge better, and binde the Body lesse after the
purging, then if it stood twenty foure houres; This is tried: But I conceiue
likewise, that by Repeating the Infusion of Rubarb, seuerall times,
(as was said of Violetts,) letting each stay in but a small time; you may
make it as strong a Purging Medecine, as Scammony. And it is not a
small thing wonn in Phisick, if you can make Rubarb, and other Medecines
                     
that are Benedict, as strong Purgers, as those that are not without
some Malignity.
                  
                     
                     Purging Medecines, for the most part, haue their Purgatine Vertue,
in a fine Spirit; As appeareth by that they indure not boiling, without
much losse of vertue. And therfore it is of good vse in Phisick, if you
can retaine the Purging Vertue, and take away the Vnpleasant tast of
the Purger; which it is like you may doe, by this Course of Infusing
oft, with little stay. For it is probable, that the Horrible and Odious
Tast, is in the Grosser part.
                  
                      Generally, the working by Infusions, is grosse and blinde, except you
first try the Issuing of the seuerall Parts of the Body, which of them
Issue more speedily, and which more slowly; And so by apportioning
the time, can take and leaue that Quality, which you desire. This to
know, ther be two waies; The one to try what long stay, and what short
stay worketh, as hath been said: The other to try in Order, the succeding
Infusions, of one and the same Body, successiuely, in seuerall Liquors.
As for example; Take Orenge-Pills, or Rose-Mary, or Cinnamon,
or what you will; And let them Infuse halfe an houre in VVater:
Then take them out, and Infuse them againe in other VVater; And so
the third time: And then tast and consider the First water, the Second,
and the Third: And you will find them differing, not only in Strength
and Weaknes, but otherwise in Tast, or Odour; For it may bee the
First water will haue more of the Sent, as more Fragrant; And the
Second more of the Tast, as more bitter or Biting, &amp;c.
                  
                     
                     Infusions in Aire, (for so we may well call Odours) haue the same
diuersities with Infusions in VVater; In that the seuerall Odours (which
are in one Flower, or other Body) issue at seuerall times; Some earlier,
some later: So we finde that Violetts, Woodbines, Strawberries,
yield a pleasing Sent, that commeth forth first; But soone after an
ill Sent, quite differing from the Former; Which is caused, not so
much by Mellowing, as by the late Issuing of the Grosser Spirit.
                  
                      As we may desire to extract the finest Spirits in some Cases; So we
may desire also to discharge them (as hurtfull) in some other. So
VVine burnt, by reason of the Evaporating of the finer Spirit, enslameth
lesse, and is best in Agues: Opium leeseth some of his poisonous
Quallity, if it be vapoured out, mingled with Spirit of Wine, or the like:
Sean leeseth somewhat of his windines by Decocting; And (generally)
subtile or windy Spirits are taken off by Incension, or Evaporation.
And euen in Infusions in things that are of too high a Spirit, you were
better poure off the first Infusion, after a small time, and vse the latter.
                  
                     BVbbles are in the forme of a Hemisphere; Aire within, and a little
Skin of VVater without: And it seemeth somewhat strange, that
the Aire should rise so swiftly, while it is in the VVater; And when it
commeth to the topp, should be staid by so weake a Couer as that of
 the Bubble is.Experiment Solitary touching the Appetite of Continuation in liquids.
                      But as for the swift Ascent of the Aire, while is vnder

the VVater, that is a Motion of Percussion from the VVater; which it
selfe descending, driueth vpp the Aire; and no Motion of Leuity in the
Aire. And this Democritus called Motus Plaga. In this Common Experiment,
the Cause of the Enclosure of the Bubble is, for that the Appetite
to resist Separation, or Discontinuance, (which in solide Bodies
is strong) is also in Liquours, though fainter and weaker; As wee see in
this of the Bubble: we see it also in little Glasses of Spittle that children
make of Rushes; And in Castles of Bubbles, which they make by
blowing into water, hauing obtained a little Degree of Tenacity by
Mixture of Soape: Wee see it also in the Stillicides of water, which if
ther be water enough to follow, will Drawe themselues into a small
thredd, because they will not discontinue; But if ther be no Remedy,
then they cast themselues into round Dropps; which is the Figure, that
saueth the Body most from Discontinuance: The same Reason is of
the Roundnes of the Bubble, as well for the Skin of water, as for the
Aire within: For the Aire likewise auoideth Discontinuance; And therfore
casteth it self into a Round Figure. And for the stopp and Arrest of
the Aire a little while, it sheweth that the Aire of it selfe hath little, or
no Appetite, of Ascending.
                  THE Reiection, which I continually vse, of Experiments, (though
it appeareth not) is infinit; But yet if an Experiment be probable in
the Worke, and of great Vse, I receyue it, but deliuer it as doubtfull. It
was reported by a Sober Man, that an Artificiall Spring
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Making of Artificiall Springs.
                      may be made
thus: Finde out a hanging Ground, wher ther is a good quick Fall of 
Raine-water. Lay a Half-Trough of Stone, of a good length, 3. or 4.
foote deep within the same Ground; with one end vpon the high
Ground, the other vpon the lowe. Couer the Trough with Brakes a
good thicknes, and cast Sand vpon the Topp of the Brakes: You shall
see, (saith he) that after some showers are past, the lower End of the
Trough will runn like a Spring of water: which is no maruaile, if it
hold, while the Raine-water lasteth; But he said it would continue long
time after the Raine is past: As if the water did multiply it self vpon
the Aire, by the helpe of the Coldnesse and Condensation of the Earth,
and the Consort of the first Water.
                  THE French, (which put off the Name of the French Disease; vnto
the Name of the Disease of Naples,) doe report, that at the Siege
of Naples, ther were certaine wicked Merchants, that Barrelled vpp
Mans flesh,
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Venemous Quality of Mans Flesh.
                      (of some that had been, lately slaine in Barbary) and sold
it for Tunny; And that vpon that foule and high Nourishment, was the 
Originall of that Disease. Which may well be; For that it is certaine,
that the Caniballs in the West Indies, eate Mans flesh; And the West Indies
were full of the Pockes when they were first discouered: And at this
day the Mortallest poisons, practised by the West Indians, haue some Mixture
of the Bloud, or Fatt, or Flesh of Man: And diuers Witches, and

Sorceresles, aswell amongst the Heathen, as amongst the Christians, haue
fedd vpon Mans flesh, to aid (as it seemeth) their Imagination, with
High and foule Vapours.
                  IT seemeth that ther be these waies (in likelihood) of Version of Vapours,
or Aire, into Water and Moisture.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Version and Transmutation of Aire into Water.
                      The first is Cold; which
doth manifestly Condense; As wee see in the Contracting of the Aire
in the Weather-Glasse; whereby it is a Degree nearer to water. Wee see
it also in the Generation of Springs, which the Ancients thought (very
 probably) to be made by the Version of Aire into water, holpen by the
Rest, which the Aire hath in those Parts; wherby it cannot dissipate.
And by the Coldnes of Rockes; for ther Springs are chiefly generated.
Wee see it also in the Effects of the Cold of the Middle Region (as they
call it) of the Aire; which produceth Dews, and Raines. And the Experiment
of Turning water into Ice, by Snow, Nitre, and Salt, (wherof
wee shall speake hereafter,) would be transferred to the Turning
of Aire into Water. The Second way is by Compression; As in Stillatories,
wher the Vapour is turned back, vpon it self, by the Encounter of
the Sides of the Stillatory; And in the Dew vpon the Couers of Boyling
Potts; And in the Dew towards Raine, vpon Marble, and Wainscott.
But this is like to doe no great effect; Except it be vpon Vapours, and
grosse Aire, that are allready very neare in Degree to Water. The
Third is that, which may be searched into, but doth not yet appeare;
which is, by Mingling of moist Vapours with Aire; And trying if
they will not bring a Returne of more Water, then the water was at
first: For if so; That Increase is a version of the Aire: Therfore putt
water into the Bottome of a Stillatory, with the Nebb stopped; Weigh
the Water first; Hang in the Middle of the Stillatory a large Spunge;
And see what Quantitie of Water you can crush out of it; And what it
is more, or lesse, compared with the water spent; For you must vnderstand,
that if any Version can be wrought, it will be easeliest done in
small Pores: And that is the Reason why wee prescribe a Spunge. The
Fourth way is Probable also, though not Appearing; Which is, by
Receiuing the Aire into the small Pores of Bodies; For (as hath been said)
euery thing in small Quantity is more easy for version; And Tangible
Bodies haue no pleasure in the Consort of Aire, but endeauour to subact
it into a more Dense Body: But in Entire Bodies it is checked; because
if the Aire should Condense, ther is nothing to succeed: Therfore
it must be in loose Bodies, as Sand, and Powder; which wee see, if
they lye close, of themselues gather Moisture.
                  IT is reported by some of the Ancients; That Whelps, or other Creatures,
if they be put Young, into such a Cage, or Boxe, as they cannot
rise to their Stature, but may encrease in Breadth, or length;
will growe accordingly, as they can gett Roome: which if it be
 true, and faisible, and that the young Creature so pressed, and straightened,

doth not therupon die; It is a Meanes to produce Dwarfe Creatures,
and in a very Strange Figure.Experiment Solitary touching Helpes towards the Beauty and good Features of Persons.
                      This is certaine, and noted long
since; That the Pressure or Forming of Parts of Creatures, when they
are very young, doth alter the Shape not a little; As the Stroaking of
the Heads of Infants, between the Hands, was noted of Old, to make
Macrocephali; which shape of the Head, at that time, was esteemed. And
the Raising gently of the Bridge of the Nose, doth preuent the Deformity
of a Saddle Nose. Which obseruation well weighed, may teach
a Meanes, to make the Persons of Men, and Women, in many kindes,
more comely, and better featured, then otherwise they would be; By
the Forming and Shaping of them in their Infancy: As by Stroaking vp
the Calues of the Leggs, to keepe them from falling downe too lowe;
And by Stroaking vp the Forehead to keepe them from being lowforeheaded.
And it is a common Practise to swath Infants, that they
may growe more straight, and better shaped: And wee see Young Women,
by wearing straight Bodies, keepe themselues from being Grosse,
and Corpulent.
                  
                     ONions, as they hang, will many of them shoot forth; And so will
Penniroiall; And so will an Herb called Orpin; with which they

Stick, and setting it against a wall.Experiments Solitary touching the Condensing of Aire, in such sort as it may put on Weight, and yield Nourishment.
                      We see it like wise, more especially,
in the greater Semper-vine, which will put out Branches, two or three
yeares: But it is true, that commonly they wrapp the Root in a Cloth
besmeared with Oyle, and renue it once in halfe a Yeare. The like is reported
by some of the Ancients, of the Stalks of Lillies. The Cause 
is; For that these Plants haue a Strong, Dense, and Succulent Moisture,
which is not apt to exhale; And so is able, from the old store, without
drawing helpe from the Earth, to suffice the sprouting of the Plant:
And this Sprouting is chiefly in the late Spring, or early Sommer;
which are the Times of Putting forth. We see also, that Stumps of
Trtes, lying out of the ground, will put forth Sprouts for a Time. But it
is a Noble Triall, and of very great Consequence, to try whether these
things, in the Sprouting, doe increase Weight; which must be tried, by
weighing them before they be hangd vp; And afterwards againe,
when they are sprouted. For if they encrease not in Weight; Then it is
no more but this; That what they send forth in the Sprout, they leese
in some other Part: But if they gather Weight, then it is Magnale Naturae;
For it sheweth that Aire may be made so to be Condensed, as to
be conuerted into a Dense Body; wheras the Race and Period of all
things, here aboue the Earth, is to extenuate and turne things to be
more Penumaticall, and Rare; And not to be Retrograde, from Pneumaticall to
that which is Dense. It sheweth also, that Aire can Nourish;
which is another great Matter of Consequence. Note, that to try this,
the Experiment of the Semper-viue must be made without Oiling the
Cloth; For els, it may be, the Plant receiueth Nourishment from the
Oile.
                  
                     
                     FLame and Aire doe not Mingle, except it be in an Instant; Or in the
vitall Spiritts of vegetables, and liuing Creatures.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Cō
                           mixture of Flame and Aire, and the great Force therof. In Gunpowder, the
Force of it hath been ascribed, to Rarefaction of the Earthy Substance
into Flame; And thus farr it is true: And then (forfooth) it is become
another Element; the Forme wherof occupieth more place;
And so, of Necessity, followeth a Dilatation: And therfore, lest two
 Bodies should be in one place, ther must needes also follow an Expulsion
of the pellet; Or Blowing vp of the Mine. But these are Crude
and Ignorant Speculations. For Flame, if ther were nothing els, except
it were in very great quantity, will be suffocate with any hard Body,
such as a Pellet is, Or the Barrell of a Gunn; So as the Flame would
not expell the hard Body; But the hard Body would kill the Flame,
and not suffer it to kindle, or spread. But the Cause of this so potent
a Motion, is the Nitre, (which wee call otherwise Salt-Petre;) which
hauing in it anotable Crude and windy Spirit, first by the Heate of the
Fire suddainly dilateth it self; (And wee knowe that simple Aire, being
preternaturally attenuated by Heate, will make it self Roome, and
breake and blowe vp that which resisteth it;) And Secondly, when
the Nitre hath Dilated it self, it bloweth abroad the Flame, as an Inward
Bellowes. And therfore wee see that Brimstone, Pitch, Camphire, Wilde-Fire,
and diuers other Inflammable Matters, though they burne cruelly,
and are hard to quench; Yet they make no such fiery winde, as Gunpowder
doth: And on the other side, wee see that Quick Siluer, (which
is a most Crude and Watry Body) heated, and pent in, hath the like force
with Gunpowder. As for liuing Creatures, it is certaine, their Vitall Spiritts
are a Substance Compounded of an Airy and Flamy Matter; And
though Aire and Flame being free, will not well mingle; yet bound
in by a Body that hath some fixing, they will. For that you may best see
in those two Bodies, (which are their Aliments,) water, and Oyle; For
they likewise will not well mingle of themselues, but in the Bodies of
Plants, and liuing Creatures, they will. It is no maruaile therfore, that
a small Quantity of Spiritts, in the Cells of the Braine, and Canales of
the Sinewes, are able to moue the whole Body, (which is of so great
Masse,) both with so great Force, as in Wrestling, Leaping; And with
so great Swiftnes, As in playing Diuision vpon the Lute. Such is the
force of these two Natures, Aire and Flame, when they incorporate.
                  TAke a small waxe Candle, and putt it in a Socket, of Brasse, or Iron;
Then sett it vpright in a Porringer full of Spirits of Wine, heated:
Then sett both the Candle, and Spiritt of Wine, on fire, and you shall see
the Flame of the Candle, open it self, and become 4. or 5. times bigger
 then otherwise it would haue been; and appeare in Figure Globular
and not in Piramis.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Secret Nature of Flame.
                      You shall see also, that the Inward Flame of the
Candle keepeth Colour, and doth not waxe any whitt blewe towardes
the Colour of the Outward flame of the Spiritt of Wine. This is a Noble

                     Instance; where in two things are most remarkable; The one; that one
Flame within another quencheth not; but is a fixed Body, and continueth
as Aire, or Water doe. And therefore Flame would still ascend vpwards
in one greatnesse, if it were not quenched on the Sides: And the
greater the Flame is at the Bottome, the higher is the Rise. The other,
that Flame doth not mingle with Flame, as Aire doth with Aire, or Water
with Water, but only remaineth contiguous; As it commeth to passe
betwixt Consisting Bodies. It appeareth also, that the forme of a Piramis
in Flame, which we vsually see, is meerely by Accident, and that the
Aire about, by quenching the Sides of the Flame, crusheth it, and extenuateth
it into that Forme; For of it selfe it would be Round: And
therefore Smoake is in the Figure of a Piramis Reuersed; For the Aire
quencheth the Flame, and receiueth the Smoake. Note also, that the
Flame of the Condle, within the Flame of the Spirit of Wine, is troubled;
And doth not onely open and moue vpwards, but moueth wauing, and
to and fro: As if Flame of his owne Nature (if it were not quenched,)
would rowle and turne, as well as moue vpwards. By all which, it
should seeme, that the Caelestiall Bodies, (most of them,) are true Fires
or Flames, as the Stoicks held; More fine (perhaps) and Rarified, than
our Flame is. For they are all Globular, and Determinate,; They haue
Rotation; And they haue the Colour and Splendour of Flame: So that
Flame aboue is Durable, and Consistent, and in his Naturall place; But
with vs, it is a Stranger, and Momentany, and Impure; Like Vulcan that
haked with his Fall.
                  Take an Arrow, and hold it in Flame, for the space of ten pulses; And
when it commeth forth, you shall finde those Parts of the Arrow, which
were on the Outsides of the Flame, more burned, blacked, and turned
almost into a Coale; whereas that in the Middest of the Flame, will be,
as if the Fire had scarce touched it.Experiment Solitory touching the Different force of Flame in the Middest and on the Sides.
                      This is an Instance of great consequence
for the discouery of the Nature of Flame; And sheweth manifestly,
that Flame burneth more violently towards the Sides, than in the
Middest: And, which is more, that Heat or Fire is not violent or furious,
but where it is checked, and pont. And therfore the Peripatetickes (howsoeuer
their opinion of an Element of Fire aboue the Aire is iustly exploded;)
in that Point they acquit themselues well: For being opposed,
that if there were a Spbeare of Fire, that incompassed the Earth so
neare hand, it were impossible but all things should be burnt vp; They
answer, that the pure Elementall Fire, in his owne place, and not irritate,
is but of a Moderate Heat.
                  
                  It is affirmed constantly by many, as an vsuall Experiment; That a
Lampe of Vre, in the Bottome of a Mine, will be tumbled, and stirred, by
two Mens strength; which if you bring it to the Topp of the Earth, will
aske Six Mens strength at the least to stirre it.Experiment Solitary touching the Decrease of the Naturall motion of Grauity in great distance from the Earth; or within some depth of the Earth.
                      It is a Noble Instance,
and is fit to be tried to the full: For it is very probable, that the Motion
                     
                     
                     of Grauitie worketh weakly, both farre from the Earth, and also within
the Earth: The former, because the Appetite of Vnion of Dense Bodies
with the Earth, in respect of the distance, is more dull; The latter,
because the Body hath in part attained his Nature, when it is some
Depth in the Earth. For as for the Mouing to a Point or Place (which
was the Opinion of the Ancients) it is a meere Vanity.
                  
                      It is strange, how the Ancients tooke vp Experiments vpon credit, and
yet did build great Matters vpon them.Experiment Solitary touching the Contraction of Bodies in Bulke, by the Mixture of the more Liquid Body with the more Solid.
                      The Obseruation of some of
the best of them, deliuered confidently, is That a Vessell filled with Ashes,
will receiue the like quantity of Water, that it would haue done, if it had
been empty. But this is vtterly vntrue; for the Water will not goe in by
a Fifth part. And I suppose, that that Fifth part is the difference of the
lying close, or open, of the Ashes; As we see that Ashes alone, if they be
hard pressed, will lye in lesse roome: And so the Ashes with Aire betweene,
lye looser; and with Water, closer. For I haue not yet found
certainly, that the Water, it selfe, by mixture of Ashes, or Dust, will
shrinke or draw into lesse Roome.
                  It is reported of credit, that if you lay good store of Kernells of
Grapes, about the Root of a Vine; it will make the Vine come earlier, and
prosper better.Experiment Solitary touching the Making Vines more fruitfull.
                      It may be tried with other Kernells, laid about the Root
of a Plant of the same kinde; As Figgs, Kernells of Apples, &amp;c. The Cause
 may be, for that the Kernells draw out of the Earth Iuice fit to nourish
the Tree, as those that would be Trees of themselues, though there were
no Root; But the Root being of greater strength, robbeth and deuoureth
the Nourishment, when they haue drawne it: As great Fishes deuoure
little.
                  The Operation of Purging Medicines, and the Causes thereof, haue
béene thought to be a great Secret; And so according to the slothfull
manner of Men, it is referred to a Hidden Propriety, a Specificall vertue,
                      and a Fourth Qualitie, and the like Shifts of Ignorance.Experiments in Consort touching Purging Medicines.
                      The Causes of
Purging are diuers; All plaine and perspicuous; And throughly maintained
by Experience. The first is, That whatsoeuer cannot be ouercome
and disgested by the Stomacke, is by the Stomacke, either put vp by
Vomit, or put downe to the Guts; And by that Motion of Expulsion in the
Stomacke, and Guts, other Parts of the Body, (as the Orifices of the Veines,
and the like) are moued to expell by Consent. For nothing is more frequent
than Motion of Consent in the Body of Man. This Surcharge of
the Stomacke, is caused either by the Qualitie of the Medicine, or by the
Quantitie. The Qualities are three: Extreme Bitter, as in Aloes, Coloquintida,
&amp;c. Loathsome and of horrible taste; As in Agarick, Black Hellebore,
&amp;c. And of secret Malignity, and disagreement towards Mans Bodie,
many times not appearing much in the Taste; As in Scammony, Mechoacham,
Antimony, &amp;c. And note well, that if there be any Medicine,
                     
that Purgeth, and hath neither of the first two Manifest Qualities; it is to
be held suspected, as a kinde of Poysons; For that it worketh either by
Corrosion; or by a secret Malignitie and Enmitie to Nature: And therfore
such Medicines are warily to be prepared, and vsed. The Quantitie of
that which is taken, doth also cause Parging; As we see in a great Quantitie
of New Milke from the Cow; yea and a great Quantitie of Meat; For
Surfets many times turne to Purges, both vpwards, and downwards.
Therefore we see generally, that the working of Purging Medicines, commeth
two or three houres after the Medicines taken; For that the Stomacke
first maketh a proofe, whether it can concoct them. And the like
happeneth after Surfets; or Milke in too great Quantitie.
                  
                  A second Cause is Mordication of the Orifices of the Parts; Especially 
of the Mesentery veines; As it is seene, that Salt, or any such thing
that is sharpe and biting, put into the Fundament, doth prouoke the
Part to expell; And Mustard prouoketh Sneezing: And any Sharpe
Thing to the Eyes, prouoketh Teares. And therfore we see that almost
all Purgers haue a kinde of Twiching and vellication, besides the Griping
which commeth of wind. And if this Mordication be in an ouer-high
Degree, it is little better than the Corrosion of Poyson; And it commeth
to passe sometimes in Antimony; Especially if it be giuen, to Bodies not
repleat with Humors; For where Humors abound, the Humors saue
the Parts.
                  The third Cause is Attraction: For I doe not deny, but that Purging 
Medicines haue in them a direct Force of Attraction; As Drawing Plasters
haue in Surgery: And we see Sage, or Bettony brused, Sneezing-powder,
and other Powders or Liquors (which the Physitians call Errhines,)
put into the Nose, draw Flegme, and water from the Head; And so it
is in Apophlegmatismes, and Gargarismes, that draw the Rheume downe
by the Pallate. And by this Vertue, no doubt, some Purgers draw more
one Humour, and some another, according to the Opinion receiued:
As Rubarb draweth Choller; Sean Melancholy; Agarick Flegme; &amp;c.
But yet, (more or lesse) they draw promiscuously. And note also, that
besides Sympathy, between the Purger and the Humour, there is also another
Cause, why some Medicines draw some Humour more than another.
And it is, for that some Medicines work quicker than others: And
they that draw quick, draw only the Lighter, &amp; more fluide Humours;
they that draw flow, worke vpon the more Tough, and Viscous Humours.
And therfore Men must beware, how they take Rubarb, and the
like, alone, familiarly; For it taketh only the Lightest part of the Humour
away, and leaueth the Masse of Humours more obstinate. And
the like may be said of Worme-wood, which is so much magnified.
                  The fourth Cause is Flatnosity; For Wind stirred moueth to expell:
And we finde that (in effect) all Purgers haue in them a raw Spirit, or
Wind; which is the Principall Cause of Tortion in the Stomach, and Belly.
And therfore Purgers leese (most of them) the vertue, by Decoction
vpon the Fire; And for that Cause are gluen chiefly in Infusion, Iuyce,
or Powder.
                  
                     
                      The fifth Cause is Compression, or Crushing: As when Water is Crushed
out of a Spunge: So we see that Taking Cold moueth Loosenesse by Contraction
of the Skinn, and outward Parts; And so doth Cold likewise
cause Rheumes, and Defluxions from the Head; And some Astringent
Plasters crush out purulent Matter. This kind of Operation is not found
in many Medicines: Mirabalanes haue it; And it may be the Barkes of
Peaches; For this Vertue requireth an Astriction; but such an Astriction,
as is not gratefull to the Body; (For a pleasing Astriction doth rather
Binde in the Humours, than Expell them:) And therfore such Astriction
is found in Things of an Harrish Taste.
                  
                      The Sixth Cause is Lubrefaction, and Relaxation. As we see in Medicines
Emollient; Such as are Milke, Honey, Mallowes, Lettuce, Mercuriall,
Pelletory of the Wall, and others. There is also a secret Vertue of Relaxation
in Cold: For the Heat of the Body bindeth the Parts and Humours
together, which Cold relaxeth: As it is seene in Vrine, Bloud, Pottage, or
the like; which, if they be Cold, breake, and dissolue. And by this kinde
of Relaxation, Feare looseneth the Belly; because the Heat retiring inwards
towards the Heart, the Gutts and other Parts are relaxed; In the
same manner, as Feare also causeth Trembling in the Sinewes. And of
this Kinde of Purgers are some Medicines made of Mercury.
                  
                  
                      The Seuenth Cause is Abstersion; which is plainly a Scouring off, or
Incision of the more viscous Humors, and making the Humors more fluide;
And Cutting betweene them, and the Part. As is found in Nitrous Water,
which scoureth Linnen Cloth (speedily) from the Foulenesse. But
this Incision must be by a Sharpnesse, without Astriction: Which wee
finde in Salt, Worm-wood, Oxymel, and the like.
                  
                      There be Medicines, that moue Stooles, and not Vrine; Some other,
Vrine, and not Stooles, Those that Purge by Stoole are such as enter not
at all, or little into the Mesentery Veines; But either at the first are not
digestible by the Stomach, and therefore moue immediatly downwards
to the Gutts; Or else are afterwards reiected by the Mesentery Veines,
and so turne likewise downwards to the Gutts; and of these two kindes
are most Purgers. But those that moue Vrine, are such, as are well digested
of the Stomach, and well receiued also of the Mesenfery Veines; So
they come as farre as the Liuer, which sendeth Vrine to the Bladder, as
the Whey of Bloud: And those Medicines being Opening and Piercing,
doe fortifie the Operation of the Liuer, in sending downe the wheyey
Part of the Bloud to the Reines. For Medicines Vrinatiue doe not worke
by Reiection, and Indigestion, as Solutiue doe.
                  
                      There be diuers Medicines, which in greater Quantity, moue Stock,
and in smaller, Vrine: And so contrariwise, some that in greater Quantity,
moue Vrine, and in Smaller, Stoole. Of the former sort is Rubarb, and
some others. The Cause is, for that Rubarb is a Medicine, which the Stomach
in a small Quantity doth digest, and ouercome, (being not Flatuous,
nor Loathsome;) and so sendeth it to the Mesentery Veines; And
so being opening, it helpeth downe Vrine: But in a greater Quantitie,

the Stomach cannot ouercome it, and so it goeth to the Gutts. Pepper by
some of the Ancients is noted to be of the second sort; which being in
small Quantity, moueth wind in the Stomach and Gutts, and so expelleth
by Stoole; But being in greater Quantity, dissipateth the Wind; And
it selfe gotteth to the Mesentery veines; And so to the Liuer, and Reines;
where, by Heating and Opening, it sendeth downe Vrine more plentifully.
                  Wee haue spoken of Euacuating of the Body; wee will now speake
something of the Filling of it by Restoratines in Consumptions, and Emaciating
Diseases.
                     Experiments in Consort touching Meats and Drinks that are most Nourishing.
                      In Vegetables, there is one Part that is more Nourishing
than another; As Graines, and Roots nourish more, than the Leaues; In
so much as the Order of the Foliatanes was put downe by the Pope, as finding
Leaues vnable to Nourish Mans Body. Whether there be that difference 
in the Flesh of Liuing Creatures, is not well inquired: As whether
Liuers, and other Entrails, be not more Nourishing, than the Outward
Flesh. We find that amongst the Romans, a Gooses Liuer was a great
Delicacy; In so much as they had Artificiall Meanes to make it faire,
and great; But whether it were more Nourishing, appeareth not. It is
certaine, that Marrow is more Nourishing than Fat. And I conceiue
that some Decoction of Bones, and Sinewes, stamped, and well strained,
would bee a very Nourishing Broth: Wee finde also that Scotch Skinck,
(which is a Pottage of strong Nourishment,) is made with the Knees,
and Sinewes of B
                           •
                        est, but long boiled: letty also, which they vse for a Restoratiue,
is chiefly made of K
                           •
                        uckles of Veale. The Pulp that is within
the Crafish or Crabb, which they spice and butter, is more Nourishing
than the Flesh of the Crabb or Crafish. The Yolkes of Egges are clearely
more Nourishing than the Whites. So that it should seeme, that the
Parts of Liuing Creatures, that lye more Inwards, nourish more than the
Outward Flesh: Except it bee the Braine; which the Spirits prey too
much vpon, to leaue it any great Vertue of Nourishing. It seemeth for
the Nourishing of Aged Men, or Men in Consumptions, some such
thing should be Deuised, as should be halfe Chylus, before it be put into
the Stomach.
                  Take two large Capons; perboile them vpon a soft fire, by the space 
of an houre, or more, till in effect all the Bloud be gone. Adde in the
Decoction the Pill of a Sweet Limon, or a good part of the Pill of a Citron,
and a little Mace. Cut off the Shanckes, and throw them away. Then
with a good strong Chopping-knife, mince the two Capons, bones and
all, as small as ordinary Minced Meat; Put them into a large neat Boulter;
Then take a Kilderkin, sweet, and well feasoned, of foure gallons of
Beere, of 8.
                        •
                     . strength, new as it commeth from the Tunning; Make
in the Kilderkin a great Bung-hole of purpose: Then thrust into it, the
Boulter (in which the Capons are) drawne out in length; Let it steepe in
it three Dayes, and three Nights, the Bung-hole open, to worke; Then
close the Bung-hole, and so let it continue, a Day and a halfe; Then

draw it into bottles, and you may drinke it well after three dayes Botteling;
And it will last six weeks (approued.) It drinketh fresh, flowreth
and mantleth exceedingly; It drinketh not newish at all; It is an
excellent Drinke for a Consumption, to be drunke either alone, or Carded
with some other Beere. It quencheth Thirst, and hath no whit of
windinesse. Note, that it is not possible, that Meat and Bread, either in
Broths, or taken with Drink, as is vsed, should get forth into the veines,
and outward Parts, so finely, and easily, as when it is thus Incorporate,
and made almost a Chylus aforehand.
                  
                      Triall would bee made of the like Brew with Potado Roots, or Burr
Roots, or the Pith of Artichoakes, which are nourishing Meats: It may
be tried also, with other flesh; As Phesant, Partridge, Young Porke, Pigge,
Venison, especially of young Deere, &amp;c.
                  
                      A Mortresse made with the Brawne of Capons, stamped, and strained,
and mingled (after it is made) with like quantitie, (at the least,) of
Almond Butter; is an excellent Meat to Nourish those that are weake;
Better than Blanck-Manger, or Ielly: And so is the Cullice of Cocks, boyled
thick with the like Mixture of Almond Butter: For the Mortresse, or Cullice,
of it selfe, is more Sauoury and strong; And not so fit for Nourishing
of weake Bodies; But the Almonds that are not of so high a taste
as Flesh, doe excellently qualifie it.
                  
                     
                     Indian Maiz hath (of certaine) an excellent Spirit of Nourishment;
But it must be throughly boyled, and made into a Maiz-Creame
like a Barley Creame. I iudge the same of Rize, made into a Creame;
For Rize is in Turky, and other Countries of the East, most fed vpon;
But it must be throughly boyled in respect of the Hardnesse of it: And
also because otherwise it bindeth the Body too much.
                  
                     
                     Pistachoes, so they be good, and not musty, ioyned with Almonds in Almond
Milke; Or made into a Milke of themselues, like vnto Almond
Milke, but more greene, are an excellent Nourisher. But you shall doe
well, to adde a little Ginger, scraped, because they are not without some
subtill windinesse
                  
                     
                     Milke warme from the Cow, is found to be a great Nourisher, and a
good Remedy in Consumptions: But then you must put into it, when
you milke the Cow, two little bagges; the one of Powder of Mint, the
other of Powder of Red Roses; For they keepe the Milke somewhat from
Turning, or Crudling in the stomach; And put in Sugar also, for the
same cause, and partly for the Tasts sake; But you must drinke a good
draught that it may stay lesse time in the stomach, left it Cruddle: And
let the Cup into which you milke the Cow, bee set in a greater Cup
of hot water, that you may take it warme. And Cow-milke thus prepared,
I iudge to be better for a Consumption, than Asse-milke, which (it is true)
turneth not so easily, but it is a little harrish; Marry it is more proper
for Sharpnesse of Vrine, and Exulceration of the Bladder, and all manner
of Lenifyings. Womans milke likewise is prescribed, when all faile;
but I commend it not; as being a little too neere the Iuyce of Mans Body,

to be a good Nourisher; Except it be in Infants, to whom it is
Naturall.
                  
                     Oyle of Sweet Almonds, newly drawen, with Sugar, and a little 
                     Spice, spread vpon Bread tosted, is an Excellent Nourisher; But then to
keepe the Oyle from frying in the Stomach, you must drinke a good
draught of Milde Beere after it; And to keepe it from relaxing the Stomach
too much, you must put in a little Powder of Cinnamon.
                  The Yolkes of Eggs are of themselues so well prepared by Nature for 
Nourishment; As (so they be Potched, or Reare boiled) they need no
other Preparation, or Mixture; yet they may be taken also rawe, when
they are new laid, with Malmesey, or Sweet wine; You shall doe well to
put in some few Slices of Eryngium Roots, and a little Amber-grice; For
by this meanes, besides the immediate Facultie of Nourishment, such
Drinke will strengthen the Backe; So that it will not draw downe
the Vrine too fast; For too much Vrine doth alwaies hinder Nourishment.
                  
                     Mincing of meat, as in Pies, and buttered Minced Meat, saueth the Grinding 
of the Teeth; And therefore, (no doubt) it is more Nourishing;
Especially in Age; Or to them that haue weake Toeth; But the Butter
is not so proper for weake Bodies; And therfore it were good to moisten
it with a little Claret wine, Pill of Limon, or Orenge, cut small, Sugar,
and a very little Cinnamon, or Nutmegg. As for Chaetts, which are likewise
minced Meat, in stead of Butter, and Fat, it were good to moisten
them, partly with Creame, or Almond, or Pistachomilke, or Barly, or Maiz
Creame; Adding a little Coriander Seed, and Carraway Seed, and a very
little Saffron. The more full Handling of Alimentation we reserue to the
due place.
                  Wee haue hitherto handled the Particulars which yeeld best, and easiest,
and plentifullest Nourishment; And now we will speake of the best Meanes
of Conueying, and Conuerting the Nourishment.
                  The First Meanes is, to procure that the Nourishment may not be robbed,
and drawen away; wherin that, which we haue already said, is very
Materiall; To prouide, that the Reines draw not too strongly an ouer-great
Part of the Bloud into Vrine. To this adde that Precept of Aristotle,
that Wine be forborne in all Consumptions; For that the Spirits of
the Wine, doe prey vpon the Roseide Iuyce of the Body, and inter-common
with the Spirits of the Body, and so deceiue and robbe them of
their Nourishment. And therefore if the Consumption growing from
the weaknes of the Stomach, doe force you to vse Wine; let it alwaies be
burnt, that the Quicker Spirits may euaporate; or at the least quenched
with two little wedges of Gold, six or seuen times repeated. Adde also
this Prouision, That there be not too much Expence of the Nourishment,
by Exhaling, and Sweating: And therfore if the Patient be apt to sweat,
it must be gently restrained. But chiefly Hippocrates Rule is to bee followed;
who aduiseth quite contrary to that which is in vse: Namely,
that the Linnen, or Garment next the Flesh, be in Winter drie, and oft

changed; And in Sommer seldome changed, and smeared ouer with
Oyle; For certaine it is, that any Substance that is fat, doth a little fill
the Pores of the Body, and stay Sweat, in some Degree. But the more
cleanly way is, to haue the Linnen smeared lightly ouer, with Oyle of
Sweet Almonds; And not to forbeare shifting as oft as is fit.
                  
                      The Second Meanes is, to send forth the Nourishment into the Parts,
more strongly; For which, the working must be by Strengthening of the
Stomach; And in this, because the Stomach is chiefly comforted by Wine,
and Hot things, which otherwise hurt; it is good to resort to Outward
Applications to the Stomach: Wherin it hath beene tried, that the Quilts
of Roses, Spices, Mastick, Wormewood, Mint, &amp;c. are nothing so helpfull,
as to take a Cake of New bread, and to bedew it with a little Sack, or Alegant;
And to drie it; And after it be dried a little before the Fire, to
put it within a cleane Napkin, and to lay it to the Stomach: For it is
certaine, that all Flower hath a potent Vertue of Astriction; In so much
as it hardeneth a peece of flesh, or a Flower, that is laid in it: And
therefore a Bagge quilted with Bran, is likewise very good; but it drieth
somewhat too much; and therefore it must not lye long.
                  
                      The Third Meanes (which may be a Branch of the former) is to send
forth the Nourishment the better by Sleepe. For we see, that Beares, and
other Creatures that sleepe in the Winter, wax exceeding fat: And certaine
it is, (as it is commonly beleeued) that Sleepe doth Nourish much;
Both for that the Spirits do lesse spend the Nourishment in Sleepe, then
when liuing Creatures are awake: And because (that which is to the present
purpose) it helpeth to thrust out the Nourishment into the Parts.
Therefore in Aged men, and weake Bodies, and such as abound not
with Choller, a short Sleepe after dinner doth helpe to Nourish; For in
such Bodies there is no feare of an ouer-hastie Disgestion, which is the
Inconuenience of Postmeridian Sleepes. Sleepe also in the Morning, after
the taking of somewhat of easie Digestion; As Milke from the Cow,
Nourishing Breth, or the like; doth further Nourishment: But this
would bee done, sitting vpright, that the Milke or Broth may passe the
more speedily to the bottome of the Stomach.
                  
                      The Fourth Meanes is to prouide that the Parts themselues may
draw to them the Nourishment strongly. There is an Excellent Obseruation
of Aristotle; That a great Reason, why Plants (some of them) are
of greater Age, than Liuing Creatures, is, for that they yearely put forth
new Leaues, and Boughes; whereas Liuing Creatures put forth (after
their Period of Growth,) nothing that is young, but Haire and Nailes;
which are Excrements, and no Parts. And it is most certaine, that whatsoeuer
is young, doth draw Nourishment better, than that which is
Old; And then (that which is the Mystery of that Obseruation) young
Boughes, and Leaues, calling the Sap vp to them; the same Nourisheth
the Body, in the Passage. And this we see notably proued also, in that
the oft Cutting, or Polling of Hedges, Trees, and Herbs, doth conduce
much to their Lasting. Transferre therefore this Obseruation to the

Helping of Nourishment in Liuing Creatures: The Noblest and Principall
Vse whereof is, for the Prolongation of Life; Restauration of some
Degree of Youth; and Inteneration of the Parts: For certaine it is, that
there are in Liuing Creatures Parts that Nourish, and Repaire easily; And
Parts that Nourish and repaire hardly, And you must refresh, and renew
those that are easie to Nourish, that the other may be refreshed,
and (as it were) Drinke in Nourishment, in the Passage. Now wee see
that Draught Oxen, put into good Pasture, recouer the Flesh of young
Beese; And Men after long Emaciating Diets, wax plumpe, and fat,
and almost New: So that you may surely conclude, that the frequent
and wise Vse of those Emaciating Diets, and of Purgings; And perhaps
of some kinde of Bleeding; is a principall Meanes of Prolongation of Life;
and Restoring some Degree of Youth: For as we haue often said, Death
commeth vpon Liuing Creatures like the Torment of McZentius;
                     
                        Mortua quinetiam iungebat Corporavinis,
                        Componens Manibus
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            Manus, at
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            Oribus Ora.
                     
For the Parts in Mans Body easily reparable, (as Spirits, Bloud, and Flesh,)
die in the Embracement of the Parts hardly reparable, (as Bones, Nerues,
and Membranes;) And likewise some Entrails (which they reckon amongst
the Spermaticall Parts) are hard to repaire: Though that Diuision
of Spermaticall, and Menstrnall Parts, be but a Conceit. And this
same Obseruation also may be drawne to the present purpose of Nourishing
Emaciated Bodies: And therefore Gentle Frication draweth
forth the Nourishment, by making the Parts a little hungry, and heating
them; whereby they call forth Nourishment the better. This Frication
I wish to be done in the Morning. It is also best done by the
Hand, or a peece of Scarlet wooll, wet a little with Oile of Almonds, mingled
with a small Quantity of Bay-sals, or Saffron. We see that the very
Currying of Horses doth make them fat, and in good liking.
                  The Fifth Meanes is, to further the very Act of Assimilation of Nourishment;
                     
which is done by some outward Emollients, that make the Parts
more apt to Assimilate. For which I haue compounded an Ointment of
Excellent Odour, which I call Roman Ointment, vide the Receit. The vse
of it would be betweene Sleepes; For in the latter Sleepe the Parts Assimilate
chiefly.
                  There be many Medicines, which by themselues would doe no Cure,
but perhaps Hurt; but being applyed in a certaine Order, one after another,
doe great Cures.Experiment Solitary touching Filum Medicinale.
                      I haue tried (my selfe) a Remedy for the Gout,
which hath seldome failed, but driuen it away in 24. Houres space: It 
is first to apply a Pultasse; Of which vide the Receit; And then a Bath or
Fomentation, of which vide the Receit; And then a Plaister, vide the Receit.
The Pultasse relaxeth the Pores, and maketh the Humour apt to Exhale.
The Fomentation calleth forth the Humour by Vapours; But yet
in regard of the way made by the Pultasse. Draweth gently; And therfore
draweth the Humour out; and doth not draw more to it; For it

is a Gentle Fomentation, and hath withall a Mixture, (though very little)
of some Stupefactine. The Plaister is a Moderate Astringent Plaister,
which repelleth New Humour from falling. The Pultasse alone would
make the Part more soft, and weake; And apter to take the Defluxion
and Impression of the Humour. The Fomentation alone, if it were too
weake, without way made by the Pultasse, would draw forth little; If too
strong, it would draw to the Part, as well as draw from it. The Plaister
alone, would pen the Humour already contained in the Part, and so
exasperate it, as well as forbid new Humour. Therefore they must be all
taken in Order, as is said. The Pultasse is to be laid to for two or three
Houres: The Fomentation for a Quarter of an Houre, or somewhat better,
being vsed hot, and seuen or eight times repeated: The Plaister to
continue on still, till the Part be well confirmed.
                  There is a secret Way of Cure, (vnpractized;) By Assuetude of that
which in it selfe hurteth.Experiment Solitary touching Cure by Custome.
                      
                     Poysons haue beene made, by some, Familiar,
as hath beene said. Ordinary keepers of the Sicke of the Plague, are seldome
 infected. Enduring of Torture, by Custome, hath been made more
casie: The Brooking of Enormous Quantity of Meats, and so of Wine or
Strong Drinke, hath beene, by Custome, made to be without Surfet, or
Drunkennesse. And generally Diseases that are Chronicall, as Coughes.,
Phthisickes, some kindes of Palseyes, Lunacies, &amp;c. are most dangerous
at the first: Therefore a wise Physitian will consider whether a Disease
be Incurable; Or whether the Iust Cure of it be not full of perill; And
if he finde it to bee such, let him resort to Palliation; And alleuiate
the Symptome, without busying himselfe too much with the perfect
Cure: And many times, (if the Patient be indeed patient,) that Course
will exceed all Expectation. Likewise the Patient himselfe may striue, by
little and little, to Ouercome the Symptome, in the Exacerbation, and so,
by time, turne Suffering into Nature.
                  Diuers Diseases, especially Chronicall, (such as Quartan Agues;) are somtimes
cured by Surset, and Excesses; As Excesse of Meat, Excesse of Drinke,
Extraordinary Fasting, Extraordinary Stirring, or Lassitude, &amp; the like.Experiment Solitary touching Cure by Excesse.
                      The
 Cause is, for that Diseases of Cotinuance get an Aduētitious Strength frō
Custome, besides their Materiall Cause from the Humours: So that the
Breaking of the Custome doth leaue them only to their first Cause; which
if it be any thing weake will fall off. Besides, such Excesses doe Excite and
Spur Nature, which thereupon riseth more forcibly against the Disease.
                  
                  There is in the Body of Man a great Consent in the Motion of the seuerall
Parts.Experiment Solitary touching Cure by Motion of Consent.
                      We see, it is Childrens sport, to proue whether they can
rub vpon their Brest with one hand, and pat vpon their Fore-head with
another; And straight-waies, they shall sometimes rubbe with both
 Hands, or pat with both hands. We see, that when the Spirits, that
come to the Nosthrills, expell a bad Sent, the Stomach is ready to Expell

by Vomit. We finde that in Consumptions of the Lungs, when Nature
cannot expell by Cough, Men fall into Fluxes of the Belly, and then
they dye. So in Pestilent Diseases, if they cannot be expelled by Sweat,
they fall likewise into Loosenesse, and that is commonly Mortall. Therfore
Physitians should ingeniously contriue, how by Motions that are in
their Power, they may excite Inward Motions that are not in their Power,
by Consent: As by the Stench of Feathers, or the like, they cure the Rising
of the Mother.

                        Experiment Solitary touching Cure of Diseases which are contrary to Predist sition.
It importeth, that Diseases, contrary to the Complexion, Age, Sexe,
Season of the yeare, Diet, &amp;c. are more dangerous, than those that are
Concurrent. A Man would thinke it should be otherwise; For that,
when the Accident of Sicknesse, and the Naturall Disposition, doe second
the one the other, the Disease should be more forcible: And so (no 
doubt) it is; if you suppose like Quantity of Matter. But that, which
maketh good the Aphorisine, is; Because such Diseases doe shew a greater
Collection of Matter, by that they are able to ouercome those Naturall
Inclinations to the Contrary. And therefore in Diseases of that kinde,
let the Physitian apply himselfe more to Purgation, than to Alteration; Because
the Offence is in the Quantity; and the Qualities are rectified of
themselues.
                  
                     Physitians do wisely prescribe, that there be Preparatiues vsed before
Iust Purgations; For certaine it is, that Purgers doe many times great
Hurt, if the Body be not accommodated, both before, and after the
Purging.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Preparations before Purging, and setling of the Body afterward. The Hurt that they doe, for want of Preparation before Purging,
is by the Sticking of the Humours, and their not comming faire
away; Which causeth in the Body great Perturbations, and ill Accidents,
during the Purging; And also, the diminishing, and dulling
of the Working of the Medicine it selfe, that it purgeth not sufficiently.
Therefore the worke of Preparation is double; To make the Humours
fluide, and mature; And to make the Passages more open: For both
those helpe to make the Humours passe readily. And for the former of
these, Sirrups are most profitable; And for the Latter, Apozumes, or
Preparing Broaths; Clisters also helpe, lest the Medicine stop in the Guts,
and worke gripingly. But it is true, that Bodies abounding with Humours;
And fat Bodies; And Open weather; are Preparatines in themselues; because
they make the Humours more fluide. But let a Physitian beware,
how he purge after hard Frostie Weather, and in a Leane Body, without
Preparation. For the Hurt, that they may doe after Purging; It is caused
by the Lodging of some Humours in ill Places: For it is certaine, that
there be Humours, which somewhere placed in the Body, are quiet, and
doe little hurt; In other Places, (especially Passages,) doe much mischiefe.
Therefore it is good, after Purging, to vse Apozumes, and Broths,
not so much Opening as those vsed before Purging, but Absterfine and

                     Mundifying Clisters also are good to conclude with, to draw away the
Reliques of the Humours, that may haue descended to the Lower Region
of the Body.

                      First by Astringents, and Repercussiue
Medicines. Secondly by Drawing of the Spirits and Bloud inwards;
which is done by Cold; As Iron, or a Stone laid to the neck doth stanch
 the Bleeding at the Nose; Also it hath beene tryed, that the Testicles,
being put into sharp Vineger, hath made a suddaine Recesse of the Spirits,
and stanched Bloud. Thirdly by the Recesse of the Bloud by
Sympathy. So it hath beene tried, that the part that bleedeth, being
thrust into the Body of a Capon, or Sheepe, new ript and bleeding,
hath stanched Bloud; The Bloud, as it seemeth, sucking and drawing
vp, by similitude of substance, the Bloud it meeteth with, and so it selfe
going backe. Fourthly by Custome and Time; So the Prince of Aurange,
in his first hurt, by the Spanish Boy, could finde no meanes to stanch
the Bloud, either by Medicine or Ligament; but was faine to haue the Orifice
of the Wound stopped by Mens Thumbes, succeeding one another,
for the space at least of two Dayes; And at the last the bloud by Custome
onely retired. There is a fifth Way also in vse, to let Bloud in an
Aduerse Part, for a Revulsion.
                  
                  It helpeth, both in Medicine, and Aliment, to Change and not to
continue the same Medicine &amp; Aliment still.Experiment Solitary touching Change of Aliments and Medicines.
                      The Cause is, for that Nature
by continuall Vso of any Thing, groweth to a Sacietie, and Dulnesse, either
of Appetite, or Working. And we see that Assuetude of Things Hurtfull
                      doth make them leese their force to Hurt; As Poyson, which with
vse some haue brought themselues to brooke. And therefore it is no
maruaile, though Things helpfull, by Custome, leese their force to Helpe. I
count Intermission almost the same thing with Change; For that, that
hath beene intermitted, is after a fort new.
                  It is found by Experience, that in Diets of Guaiacum, Sarza, and the
like (especially if they be strict,) the Patient is more troubled in the beginning,
then after continuance; Which hath made some of the more
 delicate Sort of patients, giue them ouer in the middest; Supposing
that if those Diets trouble them so much at first, they shall not be able
to endure them to the End.Experiment Solitary touching Diets.
                      But the Cause is, for that all those Diets, doe
drie vp Humours, Rheumes, and the like; And they cannot Drie vp vntil
they haue first attenuated; And while the Humour is attenuated, it is
more Fluid, then it was before, and troubleth the Body a great deale
more vntill it be dried vp, and consumed. And therefore Patients must
expect a due time, and not checke at them at the first.
                  The Producing of Cold is a thing very worthy the Inquisition;
both for Vse, and Disclosure of Causes.Experiments in Consort touching the Production of Cold.
                      For Heat and

                     Cold are Natures two Hands, whereby she chiefly worketh:
And Heat we haue in readinesse, in respect of the Fire; But
for Cold we must staie till it commeth; or seecke it in deepe
Caues, or high Mountaines: And when all is done, we cannot
obtaine it in any great degree: For Furnaces of Fire are farre
hotter, then a Sommers Sunne; But Vaults, or Hills are not
much Colder then a Winters Frost.
                  
                  The first Meanes of Producing Cold, is that which Nature presenteth 
vs withall; Namely the Expiring of Cold out of the Inward Parts of the
Earth in Winter, when the Sun hath no power to ouercome it; the Earth
being (as hath beene noted by some) Primum Frigidum. This hath beene
asserted, as well by Auncient as by Moderne Philosophers: It was the Tenet
of Parmenides. It was the opinion of the Authour of the discourse in
Plutarch (for I take it that booke was not Plutarches owne) De prime Frigide.
It was the opinion of Telesius, who hath renewed the Philosophy of
Parmenides, and is the best of the Nouellists.
                  
                  The Second Cause of Cold is the Contact of Cold Bodies; For Cold is 
Actiue and Transitiue into Bodies Adiacent, as well as Heat: which is
seene in those things that are touched with Snow or Cold water. And therefore,
whosoeuer will be an Inquirer into Nature, let him resort to a Conseruatory
of Snow and Ice; Such as they vse for delicacy, to coole Wine in
Summer: Which is a Poore and Contemptible vse, in respect of other
vses, that may bee made of such Conseruatories.
                  
                  The Third Cause is the Primary Nature of all Tangible bodies: For it is 
well to be noted, that all Things whatsoeuer (Tangible) are of themselues
Cold; Except they haue an Accessory Heat by fire; Life; or Motion:
For euen the Spirit of Wine, or Chy
                           •
                        icall Oyles, which are so hot in Operation,
are to the first Touch Cold; And Aire it selfe compressed, and Condensed
a little by blowing, is Cold.
                  
                  The Fourth Cause is the Density of the Body; For all Dense Bodies are 
                     Colder then most other Bodies; As Mettalls, Stone, Glasse; And they are longer
in Heating than Softer Bodies. And it is certaine, that Earth, Dense,
Tangible, hold all of the Nature of Cold. The Cause is, for that all
Matters Tangible being Cold, it must needs follow, that where the Matter
is moist Congregate, the Cold is the greater.
                  The Fifth Cause of Cold, or rather of increase and vehemence of 
                     Cold, is a Quicke Spirit inclosed in a Cold Body: As will appeare to any that
shall attentiuely consider of Nature in many Instances. Wee see Nitre
(which hath a Quicke Spirit) is Cold; more Cold to the Tongue, then
a Stone; So Water is Colder then Oile, because it hath a Quicker Spirit; For
all Oile, though it hath the Tangible Parts better digested then Water, yet
hath it a duller Spirit: So Snow is Colder then Water, because it hath more
Spirit within it: So we see that Salt put to Ice (as in the producing of the
Artificiall Ice) increaseth the Actiuity of Cold: So some In
                           ••
                        cta which haue

                     Spirit of Life, as Snakes, and Silkwormes, are, to the touch, Cold. So
Quick-filuer is the Coldest of Mettals, because it is Fullest of Spirit.
                  
                  
                      The Sixth Cause of Cold is the Chasing and Driuing away of Spirits, such
as haue some Degree of Heat: For the Banishing of the Heat must needs
leaue any Body Cold. This we see in the Operation of Opium, and Stupefactiues,
vpon the Spirits of liuing Creatures: And it were not amisse
to trie Opium, by laying it vpon the Top of a Weather-glasse, to see whether
it will contract the Aire: But I doubt it will not succeed: For besides
that the vertue of Opium will hardly penetrate thorow such a Body
as Glasse, I conceiue that Opium, and the like, make the Spirits fly rather
by Malignity, then by Cold.
                  
                  
                      Seuenthly, the same Effect must follow vpon the Exhaling or Drawing
out of the warme Spirits, that doth vpon the Flight of the Spirits.
There is an Opinion, that the Moone is Magneticall of Heat, as the Sun
is of Cold, and Moisture: It were not amisse therefore to trie it, with
Warme waters; The one exposed to the Beames of the Moone; the other
with some Skreene betwixt the Beames of the Moone and the water; As
we vse to the Sunne for Shade; And to see whether the former will coole
sooner. And it were also good to inquire, what other Meanes there may
be, to draw forth the Exile heat, which is in the Aire; for that may be a
Secret of great Power to Produce Cold weather.
                  
                  We haue formerly set downe the Meanes of turning Aire
into water, in the Experiment 27.Experiments in Cōsort touching the Version and Transmutation of Aire into water.
                      But because it is Magnale
Nature; And tendeth to the subduing of a very great effect;
And is also of Manifold vse; we will adde some Instances in
Consort that giue light thereunto.
                  
                      It is reported by some of the Ancients, that Sailers haue vsed, euery
Night, to hang Fleeces of wooll on the sides of their Ships, the Wooll towards
the water; And that they haue crushed fresh Water out of them,
in the Morning, for their vse. And thus much we haue tried, that a
Quantitie of Wooll tied loose together, being let downe into a deepe
Well; And hanging in the Middle, some three Fathome from the water,
for a night, in the Winter time; increased in weight, (as I now remember)
to a fifth Part.
                  
                      It is reported by one of the Ancients, that in Lydia, neare Pergamus,
there were certaine Worke-men, in time of Warres, fled into Caues; And
the Mouth of the Caues being stopped by the Enemies, they were famished.
But long time after the dead Bones were found; And some Vessels
which they had carried with them; And the vessels full of Water;
And that Water, thicker, and more towards Ice, than Common Water:
which is a Notable Instance of Condensation, and Induration, by Buriall
under Earth, (in Caues,) for long time; And of version also (as it should
seeme,) of Aire into Water; if any of those vessels were Emptie. Trie
therefore a small Bladder hung in Snow; And the like in Nitre; And the

like in Quick-filuer: And if you finde the Bladders fallen, or shrunke; you
may be sure the Aire is condensed by the Cold of those Bodies; As it
would be in a Caue vnder Earth.
                  
                  It is reported of very good credit, that in the East Indies, if you set a 
Tub of Water open, in a Roome where Cloues are kept, it will be drawne
dry in 24 houres; Though it stand at some distance from the Cloues.
In the Countrey, they vse many times, in deceit, when their wooll is
new shorne, to set some Pailes of water by, in the same Roome; to increase
the weight of the wooll: But it may be, that the Heat of the Wooll,
remaining from the body of the Sheepe; or the Heat gathered by the
lying close of the wooll, helpeth to draw the watry Vapour; But that is
nothing to the Version.
                  
                  It is Reported also credibly, that Wooll new shorne, being laid casually 
vpon a Vessell of Verinyce, after some time, had drunke vp a great
part of the Veriuyce, though the Vessell were whole without any Flaw
and had not the Bung-hole open. In this Instance, there is (vpon the by)
to be noted, the Percolation, or Suing of the Veriuyce through the wood;
For Veriuyce of it selfe would neuer haue passed thorow the wood: So as,
it seemeth, it must be first in a kinde of Vapour, before it passe.
                  It is especially to be noted, that the Cause, that doth facilitate the 
                     Version of Aire into water, when the Aire is not in grosse, but subtilly
mingled with Tangible Bodies, is, (as hath beene partly touched before,)
for that Tangible Bodies haue an Antipathy with Aire; And if they finde
and Liquid Body, that is more dense, neare them, they will draw it: And
after they haue drawne it, they will condense it more, and in effect incorporate
it; For wee see that a Spunge, or Wooll, or Sugar, or a Woollen
cloth, being put but in part, in Water, or Wine, will draw the Liquour
higher, and beyond the place, where the Water or wine commeth. We
see also, that Wood, Lute-strings, and the like, doe swell in moist Seasons:
As appeareth by the Breaking of the Strings, the Hard Turning of the
Pegs, and the Hard drawing forth of Boxes, and Opening of Wainseet deeres;
which is a kinde of Infusion: And is much like to an Infusion in water,
which will make wood to swell: As we see in the Filling of the Chops
of Boules, by laying them in water. But for that part of these Experiments,
which concerneth Attraction; we will reserue it to the proper Title
of Attraction.
                  
                  There is also a Version of Aire into water, seene in the Sweating of 
                     Marbles, and other Stones. And of Wainsces before and in moist weather:
This must be, either by some Moisture the Body yeeldeth; Or else by the
Moist Aire thickned against the hard body. But it is plaine, that it is the
latter; For that we see Wood painted with Oyle Colour, will sooner gather
drops in a moist Night, than Wood alone: which is caused by the
Smoothnesse and Closenesse; which letteth in no part of the Vapour,
and so turneth it backe, and thickeneth it into Dew. We see also, that
Breathing vpon a Glasse, or Smooth body, giueth a Dew; And in Frosty
Mornings (such as we call Rime frosts) you shall finde drops of Dew vpon

the Inside of Glasse-windowes; And the Frost it selfe vpon the ground
is but a Version or Condensation, of the Moist vapours of the Night, into
a watry substance: Dewes likewise, and Raine, are but the Returnes of
Moist vapours Condensed; The Dew, by the Cold onely of the Sunnes
departure, which is the gentler Cold; Raines, by the Cold of that, which
they call the Middle Region of the Aire; which is the more violent
Cold.
                  
                  
                      It is very probable (as hath beene touched) that that, which will
turne Water into Ice, will likewise turne Aire Some Degree nearer vnto
water. Therefore trie the Experiment of the Artificiall Turning water into
Ice (whereof we shall speake in another place) with Aire in place of water,
and the Ice about it. And although it be a greater Alteration to
turne Aire into water, than water into Ice: yet there is this Hope, that by
Continuing the Aire longer time, the effect will follow; For that Artificiall
Conuersion of water into Ice, is the worke of a few Houres; And
this of Aire may be tried by a Moneths space, or the like.
                  
                     Induration, or Lapidification, of Substances more Soft, is
likewise another degree of Condensation; And is a great Alteration
in Nature.Experiments in Consort, touching Induration of Bodies.
                      The Effecting and Accelerating thereof is very
worthy to be inquired. It is effected by three Meanes. The
first is by Cold; vvhose Property is to Condense, and constipate,
as hath beene said. The Second is by Heat; which is not proper,
but by consequence; For the Heat doth attenuate; And
by Attenuation doth send forth the Spirit and moister Part
of a Body; And vpon that, the more grosse of the Tangible
Parts doe contract and serre themselues together; Both to Auoid
Vacuums (as they call it;) And also to Munite themselues
against the Force of the Fire, which they haue suffered. And
the Third is by Assimilation; when a Hard Body Assimilateth
a Soft, being contiguous to it.
                  The Examples of Induration, taking them promiscuously,
are many: As the Generation of Stones within the Earth,
which at the first are but Rude Earth, or Clay: And so of Mineralls,
which come (no doubt) at first, of luyces Concrete,
which afterward indurate: And so of Porcellane, which is an
Artificiall Cement, buried in the Earth a long time: And so the
Making of Bricke, and Tile: Also the Making of Glasse, of a
certaine Sand, and Brake-Roots, and some other Matters: Also
the Exudations of Rock-Diamonds, and Crystall, which harden

with time: Also the Induration of Bead-Amber, which at
first is a soft Substance; As appeareth by the Flies, and Spiders,
which are found in it; And many more: But wee will speake
of them distinctly.
                  For Indurations by Cold, there bee few Trialls of it; For wee haue 
no strong or intense Cold here on the Surface of the Earth, so neare the
Beames of the Sunne, and the Heauens. The likeliest Triall is by Snow,
and Ice; For as Snow and Ice, especially being holpen, and their Cold actiuated
by Nitre, or Salt, will turne Water into Ice, and that in a few houres;
So it may be, it will turne wood, or Stiffe Clay, into Stone, in longer time.
Put therefore, into a Conseruing Pit of Snow, and Ice, (adding some quantity
of Salt, and Nitre,) a Peece of Wood, or a Peece of Tough Clay, and let
it lye a Moneth, or more.
                  Another Triall is by Metalline Waters, which haue virtuall Cold in 
them. Put therefore Wood, or Clay, into Smiths water, or other Metalline
water; And try whether it will not harden in some reasonable time. But
I vnderstand it, of Metalline waters, that come by Washing, or Quenching;
And not of Strong Waters that come by dissolution; for they are
too Corrosiue to consolidate.
                  It is already found, that there are some Naturall Spring-waters, that 
will Inlapidate Wood; So as you shall see one peece of Wood, whereof
the Part aboue the Water shall continue Wood; And the Part vnder the
Water shall be turned into a kinde of Grauelly Stons. It is likely those Waters
are of some Metalline Mixture; But there would be more particular
Inquiry made of them. It is certaine, that an Egge was found, hauing lien
many yeeres in the bottome of a Moate, where the Earth had somewhat
ouergrowen it; And this Egge was comen to the Hardnesse of a
Stone; And had the Colours of the white and Yolke perfect: And the
Shell shining in small graines like Sugar, or Alablaster.
                  Another Experience there is of Induration by Cold, which is 
already found; which is, that Metalls, themselues are hardned by often
Heating and Quenching in Cold Water: For Cold euer worketh most potently
vpon Heat Precedene.
                  For Induration by Heat it must be considered, that Heat, by the Exhaling 
of the Moister Parts, doth either harden the Body; As in Bricks,
Tiles,  Or if the Heat be more fierce, maketh the grosser part it selfe,
Runne and Melt; As in the making of ordinary Glosse; And in the Vitrification of Earth, (As wee see in the Inner Parts of Farneces;) And in the
Vitrification of Brick; And of Mettals. And in the former of these, which
is the Hardening by baking, without Melting, the Heat hath these degrees;
First it Indurateth; and then maketh Fragile; And lastly it doth Inciuerate
and Calcinate.
                  
                  But if you desire to make an Induration with Toughnesse, and lesse 
Fragility; A middle way would be taken; Which is that which Artistotle
hath well noted; But would be throughly verified. It is, to decoct Bodies in

                     water, for two or three dayes; But they must bee such Bodies, into
which the Water will not enter; As Stone, and Metall. For if they be Bodies
into which the Water will enter, then long Seething, will rather Soften
than indurate them. As hath beene tried in Eggs &amp;c. Therefore, Softer
Bodies must be put into Bottles; And the Bottles hung into Water seething,
with the mouths open, aboue the Water; that no Water may get
in; For by this Meaues, the virtuall Heat of the Water will enter; And
such a Heat, as will not make the Body adust, or fragile; But the Substance
of the Water will be shut out. This Experiment wee made; And it
sorted thus. It was tried with a Peece of Free-stone, and with Pewter, put
into the Water at large. The Free-stone we found receiued in some water;
For it was softer, and easier to scrape, then a peece of the same Stone
kept drie. But the Pewter into which no water could enter, became more
white, and liker to Siluer, and lesse flexible, by much. There were also
put into an Earthen Bottle, placed as before, a good Pellet of Clay, a
Peece of Cheese, a Peece of Chalke, and a Peece of Free-stone. The Clay, came
forth almost of the Hardnesse of Stone; The Cheese likewise very hard,
and not well to be cut: The Chalke and the Free-stone much harder than
they were. The colour of the Clay inclined not a whit to the Colour of
Bricke, but rather to white, as in ordinary Drying by the Sunne. Note,
that all the former Trialls were made by a Boyling vpon a good hot Fire,
renewing the water as it consumed, with other hot water; But the Boyling
was but for twelue houres onely; And it is like that the Experiment
would haue beene more effectuall, if the Boyling had beene for two or
three daies, as we prescribed before.
                  
                      As touching Assimilation, (for there is a degree of Assimilation euen
in Inanimate bodies) wee see Examples of it in some Stones in ClayGrounds,
lying neare to the top of the Earth, where Pebble is; In which you
may manifestly see diuers Pebbles gathered together, and a Crust of Cement
or Stone betweene them, as hard as the Pebbles themselues: And it
were good to make a Triall of purpose, by taking Clay, and putting in it
diuers Pebble-Stones, thicke set, to see whether in continuance of time,
it will not be harder then other Clay of the same lump, in which no Pebbles are set. Wee see also in Ruines of old Walls, especially towards the
bottome, the Morter will become as hard as the Brick; wee see also, that
the Wood on the sides of Vessles of Wine, gathereth a Crust of Tartar, harder
then the wood it selfe; And Scales likewise grow to the Teeth, harder
then the Teeth themselues.
                  
                      Most of all, Induration by Assimilation appeareth in the Bodies of
Trees, and liuing Creatures: For no Nourishment that the Tree receiueth,
or that the liuing Creature receiueth, is so hard as Wood, Bone, or Horne, &amp;c.
but is Indurated after by Assimilation.
                  
                  The Eye of the vnderstanding, is like the Eye of the Sense: For as
 you may see great Obiects through small Crannies, or Leuells, So you

may see great Axiomes of Nature, through small and Contemptible Instances.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Version of water into Aire.
                     
The Speedy Depredation of Aire vpon watry Moisture, and Version
of the same into Aire, appeareth in nothing more visible, than in the
sudden Discharge, or vanishing, of a little Cloud of Breath, or Vapour,
from Glasse, or the Blade of a Sword, or any such Polished Body; Such
as doth not at all Detaine, or Imbibe the Moisture; For the Mistinesse
scattereth and breaketh vp suddenly. But the like Cloud, if it were Oyly,
or Fatty, will not discharge; Not because it sticketh faster; But because
Aire preyeth vpon Water; And Flame, and Fire, vpon Oyle; And therefore,
to take out a Spot of Grease, they vse a Coale vpon browne Paper;
because Fire worketh vpon Grease, or Oyle, as Aire doth vpon Water.
And we see Paper oyled, or Wood oyled, or the like last long moist; but Wet
with Water, drie, or putrifie sooner, The Cause is, for that Aire meddleth
little with the Moisture of Oyle.
                  
                  There is an Admirable demonstration, in the same trifling Instance
of the little Cloud vpon Glasse, or Gemmes or Blades of Swords, of the Force
of Vnion, euen in the least Quantities, and weakest Bodies, how much it
Conduceth to Preseruation of the present Forme; And the Resisting of 
a New.Experiment Solitary touching the Force of Vnion.
                      For marke well the discharge of that Cloud; And you shall
see it euer breake vp, first in the Skirts, and last in the middest. We see
likewise, that much Water draweth forth the Iuyce of the Body Infused;
But little water, is imbibed by the Body: And this is a Principall Cause,
why in Operation vpon Bodies, for their Version or Alteration, the Triall
in great Quantities, doth not answer the Triall in small; And so deceiueth
many; For that (I say) the greater Body, resisteth more any Alteration
of Forme, and requireth farre greater Strength in the Actiue Body,
that should subdue it.
                  We haue spoken before, in the fifth Instance, of the Cause of Orient
Colours, in Birds; which is by the Finenesse of the Strainer; we will now
endeuour to reduce the same Axione to a Worke.
                     
                        Experiment Solitary touching the Producing of Feathers and Haires of diuers Colours. For this Writing of
our Sylue Syluerum, is (to speake properly) not Neturall History, but a
high kinde of Naturall Magicke. For it is not a Description only of Nature,
but a Breaking of Nature, into great and strange Workes. Trie
therefore, the Anointing ouer of Pigeons, or other Birds, when they
are but in their downe; Or of Whelps, cutting their Haire as short as
may be; Or of some other Beast; with some oyntment, that is not hurtfull
to the Flesh; And that will harden, and sticke very close; And see
whether it will not alter the Colours of the Feathers, or Haire. It is receiued,
that the Pulling off, the first Feathers of Birds, cleane, will make
the new come forth white: And it is certaine, that White is a penurious
Colour, &amp; where Moisture is scant. So Blew Violets, &amp; other Flowers, if
they be starued, turne Pale and White; Birds, and Horses, by Age, or
Scarres, turne white: And the Hoare Haires of Men, come by the same
reason, And therefore in Birds, it is very likely, that the Feathers that

come first, will be many times of diuers Colours, according to the Nature
of the Bird; For that the Skin is more porous; But when the Skin
is more shut, and close, the Feathers will come White. This is a good
Experiment, not only for the Producing of Birds, and Beasts of strange
Colours; but also, for the Disclosure of the Nature of Colours themselues;
which of them require a finer Porositie, and which a grosser.
                  It is a worke of Prouidence, that hath beene truly obserued by some;
That the Yolke of the Egge, conduceth little to the Generation of the Bird;
But onely to the Nourishment of the same: For if a Chicken be opened,
when it is new hatched; you shall finde much of the Yolke remaining.
                        Experiment Solitary touching the Nourishment of Liuing Creatures before they be brought forth.
And it is needfull, that Birds, that are shaped without the Females
 Wombe; haue in the Egge, as well Matter of Nourishment, as Matter
of generation for the Body. For after the Egge is laid, and seuered from
the Body of the Hen; It hath no more Nourishment from the Hen; But
onely a quickening Heat when shee sitteth. But Beasts, and Men need
not the matter of Nourishment within themselues; Because they are
shaped within the Wombe of the Female, and are Nourished continually
from her Body.
                  It is an Inueterate and receiued Opinion, that Cantharides applyed
to any Part of the Body, touch the Bladder, and exulcerate it, if they stay
on long.
                        Experiments in Cōsort touching Sympathy and Antipathy for Medicinall vse. It is likewise Receiued, that a kinde of Stone, which they bring
out of the West Indies, hath a peculiar force to moue Grauell, and to
dissolue the Stone; In so much, as laid but to the wrest, it hath so forcibly
 sent downe Grauell, as Men haue beene glad to remoue it; It was so
violent.
                  
                      It is receiued and confirmed by daily Experience, that the Soales of
the Feet haue great Affinity with the Head, and the Mouth of the Stomach:
As we see, Going wet-shod, to those that vse it not, affecteth both:
Applications of hot Powders to the Feet attenuate first, and after drie the
Rheume: And therefore a Physitian, that would be Mysticall, prescribeth,
for the Cure of the Rheume, that a Man should walke Continually
vpon a Camomill Alley; Meaning, that he should put Camomill within
his Sockes. Likewise Pigeons bleeding, applyed to the Soales of the Feet,
ease the Head: And Soporiferous Medicines applied vnto them, prouoke
Sleepe.
                  
                  
                      It seemeth, that as the Feet haue a Sympathy with the Head; So the
Wrests and Hands, haue a Sympathy with the Heart; We see the Affects
and Passions of the Heart, and Spirits, are notably disclosed by the Pulse:
And it is often tried, that Iuyces of Stock-Gilly-Flowers, Rose-Campian,
Garlicke, and other things; applied to the Wrests, and renewed; haue
cured long Agues. And I conceiue, that washing with certaine Liquours,
the Palmes of the Hands, doth much good: And they doe well in Heats
of Agues, to hold in the Hands, Egges of Alablaster, and Balls of Crystall.
                  
                  Of these things we shall speake more, when we handle the Title of Sympathy
and Antipathy, in the proper Place.
                  
                     The Knowledge of man (hitherto) hath beene determined by the
View, or Sight; So that whatsoeuer is Inuisible, either in respect of the
Finenesse of the Body it selfe; Or the Smallnesse of the Parts; Or of the Subtilty
of the Motion; is little inquired.Experiment Solitary touching the Secret Processes of Nature.
                      And yet these be the Things that
Gouerne Nature Principally; And without which, you cannot make any 
true Analysis and Indication of the Proceedings of Nature. The Spirits
or Pneumaticals, that are in all Tangible Bodies, are searce knowne.
Sometimes they take them for Vacuum; wheras they are the most Actiue
of Bodies. Sometimes they take them for Aire; From which they differ
exceedingly, as much as Wine from Water; And as Wood from
Earth. Sometimes they will haue them to be Naturall Heat, or a Portion
of the Element of Fire; Wheras some of them are crude, and cold. And
Sometimes they will haue them to be the Vertues and Qualities of the
Tangible Parts, which they see; whereas they are Things by themselues.
And then, when they come to Plants and liuing Creatures, they call
them Soules. And such Superficiall Speculations they haue; Like Prospectiues,
that shew things inward, when they are but Paintings. Neither
is this a Question of Words, but infinitely materiall in Nature.
For Spirits are nothing else but a Naturall Body, rarified to a Proportion,
&amp; included in the Tangible Parts of Bodies, as in an Integument. And
they be no lesse differing one from the other, than the Dense or Tangible
Parts: And they are in all Tangible Bodies whatsoeuer, more or lesse: And
they are neuer (almost) at rest: And from them, and their Motions, principally
proceed Arefaction, Colliquation, Concoction, Maturation, Putrefaction,
Viuification, and most of the Effects of Nature: For, as we haue figured
them in our Sapientiâ Veterum, in the Fable of Proserpina, you shall
in the Infernall Regiment heare little Doings of Pluto, but most of proserpina:
For Tangible Parts in Bodies are Stupide things; And the Spirits
doe (in effect) all. As for the differences of Tangible Parts in Bodies, the
industry of the Chymists hath giuen some light, in discerning by their
Separations, the Oily, Crude, Pure, Impure, Fine, grosse Parts of Bodies, and
the like. And the Physitians are content to acknowledge, that Herbs,
and Drugs haue diuers parts; As that Opiums hath a Stupefactiue Part,
and a Heating Part; The one mouing Sleepe, the other a Sweat following;
And that Rubarb hath Purging Parts, and Astringent Parts, &amp;c.
But this whole Inquisition is weakly and Negligently handled. And for
the more subtill differences of the Minute Parts, and the Posture of them
in the Body, (which also hath great Effects) they are not at all touched:
As for the Motions of the Minute Parts of Bodies, which doe so great Effects,
they haue not beene obserued at all; because they are Inuisible,
and incurre not to the Eye; but yet they are to be deprehended by Experience:
As Democritus said well, when they charged him to hold, that
the World was made of such little Moats, as were seene in the Sunne;
Atomus (saith he) necessitate Rationis &amp; Experientia esse connincitur; Atomum enim
nemo vnquam vidit. And therefore the Tumult in the parts of
Solide Bodies, when they are compressed, which is the Cause of all

                     Flight of Bodies thorow the Aire, and of other Mechanicall Motions, (as
hath beene partly touched before, and shall be throughly handled in
due place,) is not seene at all. But neuerthelesse, if you know it not, or
enquire it not attentiuely and diligently, you shall neuer be able to discerne,
and much lesse to produce, a Number of Mechanicall Motions. Againe,
as to the Motions Corporall, within the Enclosures of Bodies, wherby
effects (which were mentioned before) passe betweene the Spirits,
and the Tangible Parts; (which are, Arefaction, Colliquation, Concoction,
Maturation, &amp;c.) they are not at all handled. But they are put off by the
Names of Vertues, and Natures, and Actions, and Passions, and such other
Logicall Words.
                  It is certaine, that all Powers in Nature, Heat is the chiefe; both in
the Frame of Nature, and in the workes of Art.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Power of Heat.
                      Certaine it is likewise,
that the Effects of Heat, are most aduanced, when it worketh vpon a Body,
 without losse or dissipation of the Matter; for that euer betrayeth
the Account. And therefore it is true, that the power of Heat is best
perceiued in Distillations, which are performed in close Vessels, and Receptacles.
But yet there is a higher Degree; For howsoeuer Distillations
doe keepe the Body in Cells, and Cloisters, without Going abroad;
yet they giue space vnto Bodies to turne into Vapour; To returne into
Liquour; And to Separate one part from another. So as Nature doth
Expatiate, although it hath not full Liberty: wherby the true and Vltime
Operations of Heat are not attained. But if Bodies may be altered
by Heat, and yet no such Reciprocation of Rarefaction, and of Condensation,
and of Separation, admitted; then it is like that this Proteus of Matter,
being held by the Sleeues, will turne and change into many Metaworphoses.
Take therefore a Square Vessell of Iron, in forme of a Cube,
and let it haue good thicke and strong Sides. Put into it a Cube of
Wood, that may fill it as close as may be; And let it haue a Couer of Iron,
as strong (at least) as the Sides; And let it be well Luted, after the manner
of the Chymists. Then place the Vessell within burning Coales, kept
quicke kindled, for some few houres space. Then take the Vessell from
the Fire, and take off the Couer, and see what is become of the Wood. I
conceiue that since all Inflammation, and Euaporation are vtterly prohibited,
and the Body still turned vpon it Selfe, that one of these two Effects
will follow: Either that the Body of the Wood will be turned into a kinde
of Amalgama,
                     Amalgama (as the Chymists call it;) Or that the Finer Part will bee
turned into Aire, and the Grosser sticke as it were baked, and incrustate
vpon the Sides of the Vessell; being become of a Denser Matter, than the
Wood it selfe, Crude. And for another Triall, take also Water, and put it
in the like Vessell, stopped as before; But vse a gentler Heat, and remoue
the vessell sometimes from the Fire; And againe, after some small time,
when it is Cold, renue the Heating of it: And repeat this Aloeration some
few times: And if you can once bring to passe, that the Water, which is
one of the Simplest of Bodies, be changed in Colour, Odour, or Taste,

after the manner of Compound Bodies, you may be sure that there is a
great Worke wrought in Nature, and a Notable Entrance made into
strange Changes of Bodies, and productions: And also a Way made,
to doe that by Fire, in small time, which the Sunne and Age do in long
time. But of the Admirable Effects of this Distillation in Close, (for so
we will call it) which is like the Wombes and Matrices of liuing creatures,
where nothing Expireth, nor Separateth; We will speake fully, in the
due place; Not that we Aime at the making of Paracelsus Pigmey's; Or
any such Prodigious Follies; But that we know the Effects of Heat will
be such, as will scarce fall vnder the Conceit of Man; If the force of it
be altogether kept in.
                  There is nothing more Certaine in Nature, than that it is impossible
for any Body, to be vtterly Annibilated; But that, as it was the worke of
the Omnipotency of God, to make Somewhat of Nothing; So it requireth
the like Omnipotency, to turne Somewhat into Nothing.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Impossibility of Annibilation.
                      And therefore
it is well said, by an Obscure Writer of the Sect of the Chymists; That 
there is no such way to effect the Strange Transmutations of Bodies, as to
endeuour and vrge by all meanes, the Reducing of them to Nothing. And
herein is contained also a great Secret of Preseruation of Bodies from
Change; For if you can prohibit, that they neither turne into Aire, because
no Aire commeth to them; Not goe into the Bodies Adiacent, because
they are vtterly Heterogeneall; Nor make a Round and Circulation
within themselues; they will neuer change, though they be in their Nature
neuer so Perishable, or Mutable. We see, how Flies, and Spiders,
and the like, get a Sepulcher in Amber, more Durable, than the Monument,
and Embalming of the Body of any King. And I conceiue the like
will be of Bodies put into Quick-siluer. But then they must be but
thinne; As a leafe, or a peece of Paper, or Parchment; For if
they haue a greater Crassitude, they will alter in their
owne Body, though they spend not. But of this,
We shall speake more, when we handle
the Title of Conseruation
of Bodies.

                  All Sounds, are either Musicall Sounds, which we call Tones; Wherunto 
there may be an Harmony; which Sounds are euer Equall; As Singing,
the Sounds of Stringed, and Wind-Instruments, the Ringing of Bells, &amp;c.
Or Immusicall Sounds; which are euer Vnequall; Such as are the Voice in
Speaking, all Whisperings, all Voices of Beasts, and Birds, (except they bee
Singing Birds;) all Percussions, of Stones, Wood, Parchment, Skins (as in
Drummes;) and infinite others.
                  The Sounds that produce Tones, are euer from such Bodies, as are in 
their Parts and Pores Equall; As well as the Sounds themselues are Equall;
And such are the Percussions of Metall, as in Bells; Of Glasse, as in
the Fillipping of a Drinking Glasse; Of Aire, as in Mens voices whilest they
Sing, in Pipes, Whistles, Organs, Stringed Instruments, &amp;c. And of Water;
as in the Nightingale-Pipes of Regalls, or Organs, and other Hydranlickes;
                     
which the Ancients had, and Nere did so much esteeme, but are now lost.
And if any Man thinke, that the String of the Bowe, and the String of the
Viall, are neither of them Equall Bodies; And yet produce Tones; he is
in an errour. For the Sound is not created between the Bowe or Plectrum,
and the String; But between the String and the Aire; No more
then it is between the Finger or Quill, and the String, in other Instruments.
So there are (in effect) but three Percussions that create Tones; Percussions
of Metalls, (comprehending Glasse, and the like;) Percussions of Aire;
and Percussions of Water.
                  
                  
                      The Diapason or Eight in Musicke is the sweetest Concord; Insomuch,
as it is in effect an Vnison; As we see in Lutes, that are strung in the Base
Strings with two strings, one an Eight aboue another; Which make but
as one Sound. And euery Eighth Note in Ascent, (as from Eight to Fifteene:
from Fifteene to twenty two, and so in infinitum,) are but Scales of Diapason.
The Cause is darke, and hath not beene rendred by any; And therfore
would be better contemplated. It seemeth that Aire, (which is the Subiect
of Sounds) in Sounds that are not Tones, (which are all vnequall,
as hath beene said) admitteth much Varietie; As wee see in the Voices of
Liuing Creatures; And likewise in the Voices of seuerall Men; (for we are
capable to discerne seuerall Men by their Voices;) And in the Coniugation of
Letters, whence Articulate Sounds proceed; Which of all others are most
various. But in the Sounds which we call Tones, (that are euer Equall)
the Aire is not able to cast it selfe into any such varietie; But is forced to
recurre into one and the same Posture or Figure, onely differing in Greatnesse
and Smalnesse. So we see Figures may be made of lines, Crooked
and Straight, in infinite Varietie, where there is Inequalitie; But Circles,
or Squares, or Triangles Equilaterall, (which are all Figures, of Equall lines)
can differ but in Greater, or Lesser.
                  
                      It is to be noted (the rather left any Man should thinke, that there is
any thing in this Number of Eight, to create the Diapason), that this Computation
of Eight, is a thing rather receiued, than any true Computation.
For a true Computation ought euer to bee, by Distribution into equall
Portions. Now there be interuenient in the Rise of Eight (in Tones) two
Beemolls, or Halfe-notes; So as if you diuide the Tones equally, the Eight
is but Seuen whole and equall Notes; And if you subdiuide that into Halfe
Notes, (as it is in the Stops of a Lute), it maketh the Number of thirteene.
                  
                  
                      Yet this true; That in the ordinary Rises and Falles of the Voice of
Man, (not measuring the Tone by whole Notes, and halfe Notes, which
is the Equall Measure;) there fall out to be two Beemols (as hath beene
said) betweene the Vnison and the Diapason: And this Varying is naturall.
For if a Man would endeuour to raise or fall his Voice, still by HalfeNotes,
like the Stops of a Lute; or by whole Notes alone, without Halfes;
as farre as an Eight; he will not be able to frame his Voice vnto it. Which
sheweth, that after euery three whole Notes Nature requireth, for all Harmonicall
vse, one halfe Note to be interposed.
                  
                      It is to be considered, that whatsoeuer Vertue is in Numbers, for

Conducing to Concent of Notes, is rather to bee ascribed to the Ante-Number,
than to the Entire Number; As namely, that the Sound retarneth
after Six, or after Twelue; So that the Seuenth, or the Thirteenth, is
not the Matter, but the Sixth, or the Twelfth; And the Seuenth and the
Thirteenth are but the limits and Boundaries of the returne.
                  
                  The Concords in Musick which are Perfect, or Semiperfect, betweene 
the Vnison, and the Diapason, are the Fifth, which is the most Perfect; the
Third next; And the Sixth which is more harsh: And as the Ancients
esteemed, and so doe my selfe and some Other yet, the Fourth which they
call Diatessaron. As for the Tenth, Twelfth, Thirteenth, and so in infinitum;
they be but Recurrences of the Former; viz. of the Third, the Fifth, and
the Sixth; being an Eight respectiuely from them.
                  For Discords, the Second, and the Seuenth, are of all others the most 
odious, in Harmony, to the Sense; whereof the One is next aboue the
Vnison, the Other next vnder the Diapason: which may shew, that Harmony
requireth a competent distance of Notes.
                  
                  In Harmony, if there be not a Discord to the Base, it doth not disturbe 
the Harmony, though there be a Discord to the Higher Parts; So the Discord
be not of the Two that are Odious; And therfore the ordinary Concent
of Foure Parts consisteth of an Eight, a Fifth, and a Third to the
Base: But that Fifth is a Fourth to the Treble, and the Third is a Sixth.
And the Cause is, for that the Base striking more Aire, doth ouercome
and drowne the Treble. (vnlesse the Discord be very Odious;) And so
hideth a small Imperfection. For we see, that in one of the lower Strings
of a Lute, there soundeth not the Sound of the Treble, not any Mixt
Sound, but onely the Sound of the Base.
                  
                  We haue no Musicke of Quarter-Notes; And it may be, they are not 
capable of Harmony; For we see the Halfe-Notes themselues doe but
interpose sometimes. Neuerthelesse we haue some Slides, or Relishes,
of the Voice, or Strings, as it were continued without Notes, from one
Tone to another, rising or falling, which are delightfull.
                  The Causes of that which is Pleasing, or Ingrate to the Hearing, may 
receiue light by that, which is Pleasing or Ingrate to the Sight. There be
two Things Pleasing to the Sight, (leauing Pictures, and Shapes aside,
which are but Secondary Obiects; And please or displease but in Memory;)
these two are, Colours, and Order. The Pleasing of Colour symbolizeth
with the Pleasing of any Single Tone to the Eare; But the Pleasing
of Order doth symbolize with Harmony. And therfore we see in
Garden-knots, and the Frets of Houses, and all equall and well-answering
Figures, (as Globes, Pyramides, Cones, Cylinders, &amp;c.) how they please;
whereas Vnequall Figures are but Deformities. And both these Pleasures,
that of the Eye, and that of the Eare, are but the Effects of Equality; Good
Proportion, or Correspondence: So that (out of Question,) Equality, and
Correspondence, are the Causes of Harmony. But to finde the Proportion of
that Correspondence, is more abstruse; wherof notwithstanding we shall
speake somewhat, (when we handle Tones,) in the generall Enquiry of
Sounds.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                     Tones are not so apt altogether to procure Sleep, as some other Sounds;
As the Wind, the Purling of Water, Humming of Bees, a Sweet Voice of
one that readeth, &amp;c. The Cause whereof is, for that Tones, because
they are Equall, and slide not, doe more strike and erect the Sense, than
the other. And Ouermuch Attention hindreth Sleepe.
                  
                  
                      There be in Musick certaine Figures, or Tropes; almost agreeing with
the Figures of Rhetoricke; And with the Affections of the Minde, and
other Senses. First, the Diuision and Quauering, which please so much in
Musick, haue an Agreement with the Glittering of Light; As the MooneBeames
playing vpon a Waue. Againe, the Falling from a Discord to a
Concord, which maketh great Sweetnesse in Musick, hath an Agreement
with the Affections, which are reintegrated to the better, after some
dislikes: It agreeth also with the Taste, which is soone glutted with that
which is sweet alone. The Sliding from the Close or Cadence, hath an
Agreement with the Figure in Rhetoricke, which they call Praeter Expectatum;
For there is a Pleasure euen in Being deceined. The Reports, and
Fuges, haue an Agreement with the Figures in Rhetorick, of Repetition,
and Traduction. The Tripla's, and Changing of Times, haue an Agreement
with the Changes of Motions; As when Galliard Time, and Measure
Time, are in the Medley of one Dance.
                  
                  
                      It hath been anciently held, and obserued, that the Sense of Hearing,
and the Kinds of Musick, haue most Operation vpon Manners; As to
Incourage Men, and make them warlike; To make them Soft and Effeminate;
To make them Graue; To make them Light; To make them
Gentle and inclined to Pitty, &amp;c. The Cause is, for that the Sense of
Hearing striketh the Spirits more immediatly, than the other Senses; And
more incorporeally than the Smelling: For the Sight, Taste, and Feeling,
haue their Organs, not of so present and immediate Accesse to the Spirits,
as the Hearing hath. And as for the Smelling, (which indeed worketh
also immediatly vpon the Spirits, and is sorcible while the Obiect
remaineth,) it is with a Communication of the Breath, or Vapour of the
Obiect Odorate: But Harmony entring easily, and Mingling not at all, and
Comming with a manifest Motion; doth by Custome of often Affecting
the Spirits, and Putting them into one kinde of Posture, alter not a
little the Nature of the Spirits, euen when the Obiect is remoued. And
therefore we see, that Tunes and Aires, euen in their owne Nature, haue
in themselues some Affinity with the Affections; As there be Merry
Tunes, Dolefull Tunes, Solemne Tunes; Tunes inclining Mens mindes to
Pitty;
Warlike Tunes; &amp;c. So as it is no Maruell, if they alter the Spirits;
considering that Tunes haue a Predisposition to the Motion of the
Spirits in themselues. But yet it hath been noted, that though this variety
of Tunes, doth dispose the Spirits to variety of Passions, conforme
vnto them; yet generally, Musick feedeth that disposition of the Spirits
which it findeth. We see also that seuerall Aires, and Tunes, doe please
seuerall Nations, and Persons, according to the Sympathy they haue with
their Spirits.
                  
                  
                     
                     Perspectiue hath been with some diligence inquired; And
so hath the Nature of Sounds, in some sort, as far as concerneth
Musick.
                     Experiments in Consort touching Sounds; and first touching the Nullity, and Entity of Sounds.
                      But the Nature of Sounds in generall, hath been superficially
obserued. It is one of the subrillest Peeces of Nature.
And besides, I practise, as I doe aduise; which is, after
long Inquiry of Things, Immerse in Matter, to interpose
some Subiect, which is Immateriate, or lesse Materiate; Such
as this of Sounds; To the end, that the Intellect may be Rectified,
and become not Partiall.
                  It is first to be considered, what Great Motions there are in Natute,
which passe without Sound, or Noise. The Heauens turne about, in a
most rapide Motion, without Noise to vs perceiued; Though in some
Dreames they haue been said to make an excellent Musick. So the Motions
of the Comets, and Fiery Meteors (as Stella Cadens, &amp;c.) yeeld no
Noise. And if it be thought, that it is the Greatnesse of distance from
vs, whereby the Sound cannot be heard; We see that Lightnings, and
Coruscations, which are neere at hand, yeeld no Sound neither. And yet
in all these, there is a Percussion and Diuision of the Aire. The Windes
in the Vpper Region (which moue the Clouds aboue (which we call the
Racke) and are not perceiued below) passe without Noise. The lower
Windes in a Plaine, except they be strong, make no Noise; But amongst
Trees, the Noise, of such Windes will be perceiued. And the Windes (generally)
when they make a Noise, doe euer make it vnequally, Rising and
Falling, and sometimes (when they are vehement,) Trembling at the
Height of their Blast. Raine, or Haile falling, (though vehemently,)
yeeldeth no Noise, in passing through the Aire, till it fall vpon the
Ground, Water, Houses, or the like. Water in a Riuer (though a swift
Streame) is not heard in the Channell, but runneth in Silence, if it be of
any depth; But the very Streame vpon Shallowes, of Grauell, or Pebble,
will be heard. And Waters, when they beat vpon the Shore, or are
straitned, (as in the falls of Bridges;) Or are dashed against themselues,
by Windes, giue a Roaring Noise. Any peece of Timber, or Hard Body,
being thrust forwards by another Body Contiguous, without knocking,
giueth no Noise. And so Bodies in weighing, one vpon another, though
the Vpper Body presse the lower Body downe, make no Noise. So the Motion
in the Minute Parts of any solide Body, (which is the Principall
Cause of Violent Motion, though vnobserued;) passeth without Sound;
For that Sound, that is heard sometimes, is produced onely by the Breaking
of the Aire; And not by the Impulsion of the Parts. So it is manifest;
That where the Anteriour Body giueth way, as fast as the Posteriour
commeth on, it maketh no Noise; be the Motion neuer so great,
or swift.
                  
                     Aire open, and at large, maketh no Noise, except it be sharply percussed; 
As in the Sound of a String, where Aire is percussed by a hard,

and stiffe Body; And with a sharp loose; For if the String be not strained,
it maketh no Noise. But where the Aire is pent, and straitned, there
Breath, or other Blowing, (which carry but a gentle Percussion,) suffice
to create Sound; As in Pipes, and winde-Instruments. But then you
must note, that in Recorders, which goe with a gentle Breath, the Concaue
of the Pipe, were it not for the Fipple, that straitneth the Aire, (much more
than the Simple Concaue;) would yeeld no Sound. For as for other windeInstruments,
they require a forcible Breath; As Trumpets, Cornets, Hunters-hornes,
&amp;c. Which appeareth by the blowne-cheeks of him that
windeth them. Organs also are blowne with a strong winde, by the Bellowes.
And note againe, that some kinde of winde-Instruments, are
blowne at a small Hole in the side, which straitneth the Breath at the first
Entrance; The rather, in respect of their Trauerse, and Stop aboue the
Hole, which performeth the Fipples Part; As it is seene in Flutes, and
Fifes, which will not giue Sound, by a Blast at the end, as Recorders, &amp;c.
doe. Likewise in all Whistling, you contract the Mouth; And to make
it more sharp, Men sometimes vse their Finger. But in Open Aire, if you
throw a Stone, or a Dart, they giue no Sound: No more doe Bullets, except
they happen to be a little hollowed in the Casting; Which Hollownesse
penneth the Aire: Not yet Arrowes, except they be ruffled in
their Feathers, which likewise penneth the Aire. As for Small whistles,
or Shepheards Oa
                           ••
                         Pipes; they giue a Sound, because of their extreame
Slendernesse, whereby the Aire is more pent, than in a Wider Pipe.
Againe, the Voices of Men, and Liuing Creatures, passe through the
throat, which penneth the Breath. As for the Iewes Harpe, it is a sharp
Percussion; And besides, hath the vantage of penning the Aire in the Mouth.
                  
                     
                     Solide Bodies, if they be very softly percussed, giue no Sound; As when
a man treadeth very softly vpon Boards. So Chests or Doores in faire
weather, when they open easily, giue no Sound. And Cart-wheeles squeak
not, when they are liquoured.
                  
                      The Flame of Tapers, or Candles, though it be a swift Motion, and
breaketh the Aire, yet passeth without Sound. Aire in Ouens, though
(no doubt) it doth (as it were) boyle, and dilate it selfe, and is repercussed;
yet it is without Noise.
                  
                  
                     
                     Flame percussed by Aire, giueth a Noise; As in Blowing of the Fire by
Bellowes; Greater, than if the Bellowes should blow vpon the Aire it
selfe. And so likewise Flame percussing the Aire strongly, (as when Flame
suddenly taketh, and openeth,) giueth a Noise; So, Great Flames, whiles
the one impelleth the other, giue a bellowing Sound.
                  
                  
                      There is a Conceit runneth abroad, that there should be a white Powder,
which will discharge a Peece without Noise; which is a dangerous
Experiment, if it should be true: For it may cause secret Murthers.
But it seemeth to me vnpossible; For, if the Aire pent, be driuen forth,
and strike the Aire open, it will certainly make a Noise. As for the white
Powder (if any such thing be, that may extinguish, or dead the Noise,)

it is like to be a Mixture of Petre, and Sulphur, without Coale. For Petre
alone will not take Fire. And if any Man thinke, that the Sound may be
extinguished, or deaded, by discharging the Pent Aire, before it commeth
to the Mouth of the Peece, and to the Open Aire; That is not probable;
For it will make more diuided Sounds; As if you should make a
Crosse Barrell hollow, thorow the Barrell of a Peece, it may be, it would
giue seuerall Sounds, both at the Nose, and at the Sides. But I conceiue,
that if it were possible, to bring to passe, that there should be no Aire
pent at the Mouth of the Peece, the Bullet might fly with small, or no
Noise, For first it is certaine, there is no Noise in the Percussion of the
Flame vpon the Bullet. Next the Bullet, in piercing thorow the Aire, maketh
no Noise; As hath beene said. And then, if there be no Pent Aire
that striketh vpon Open Aire, there is no Cause of Noise; And yet the
Flying of the Bullet will not be stayed. For that Motion (as hath beene
oft said) is in the Parts of the Bullet, and not in the Aire. So as triall must
be made by taking some small Concaue of Metall, no more than you mean
to fill with Powder; And laying the Bullet in the Mouth of it, halfe out
into the Open Aire.
                  
                  I heard it affirmed by a Man, that was a great Dealer in Secrets, but 
he was but vaine; That there was a Conspiracy (which himselfe hindred,)
to haue killed Queene Mary, Sister to Queene Elizabeth, by BurningGlasse,
when shee walked in Saint Iames Parke, from the Leads of the
House. But thus much (no doubt) is true; That if Burning-Glasses could
be brought to a great strength, (as they talke generally of Burning-Glasses,
that are able to burne a Nauy,) the Percussion of the Aire alone, by
such a Burning-Glasse, would make no Noise; No more than is found in
Cornscations, and Lightnings, without Thunders.
                  
                  I suppose, that Impression of the Aire with Sounds, asketh a time to 
be conueighed to the Sense; As well as the Impression of Species visible:
Or else they will not be heard. And therefore, as the Bullet moueth so
swift, that it is Inuisible; So the same Swiftnesse of Motion maketh it Inaudible: For we see, that the Apprehension of the Eye, is quicker than
that of the Eare.
                  
                  All Eruptions of Aire, though small and slight, giue an Entity of Sound;
                     
which we call Crackling, Pussing, Spitting, &amp;c. As in Bay-salt, and Bayleaues,
cast into the Fire; So in Chesnuts, when they leape forth of the
Ashes; So in Greene Wood laid vpon the Fire, especially Roots; So in
Candles that spit Flame, if they be wet; So in Rasping, Sneezing, &amp;c. So
in a Rose-leafe gathered together into the fashion of a Purse, and broken
vpon the Fore-head, or Backe of the Hand, as Children vse.
                  The Cause giuen of Sound, that it should be an Elision of the Aire
(wherby, if they meane any thing, they meane a Cutting, or Diuiding, or
else an Attenuating of the Aire) is but a Terme of Ignorance: And the
Motion is but a Catch of the Wit vpon a few Instances; As the Manner
is in the Philosophy Receiued.Experiments in Cōsort touching Production. Conseruation, and Dilation of Sounds; And the Office of the Aire therein. And it is common with Men, that if they

haue gotten a Pretty Expression, by a Word of Art, that Expression, goeth
currant; though it be empty of Matter. This Conceit of Elision, appeareth
most manifestly to befalse, in that the Sound of a Bell, String, or the
 like, continueth melting, some time, after the Percussion; But ceaseth
straight-waies, if the Bell, or String, be touched and stayed: wheras, if it
were the Elision of the Aire, that made the Sound, it could not be, that
the Touch of the Bell, or String, should extinguish so suddenly that Motion,
caused by the Elision of the Aire. This appeareth yet more manifestly,
by Chiming with a Hammer, vpon the Out-side of a Bell; For the
Sound will be according to the inward Concaue of the Bell; whereas the
Elision, or Attenuation of the Aire, cannot be but onely betweene the
Hammer,
and the Out-side of the Bell, So againe, if it were an Elision, a
broad Hammer, and a Bodkin, strucke vpon Metall, would giue a diuers
Tone; As well as a diuers Loudnesse: But they doe not so; For though
the Sound of the one be Louder, and of the other Softer, yet the Tone is
the same. Besides, in Eccho's, (wherof some are as loud as the Originall
Voice, there is no new Elision; but a Repercussion onely. But that which
conuinceth it most of all, is, that Sounds are generated, where there is
no Aire at all. But these and the like Conceits, when Men haue cleared
their vnderstanding, by the light of Experience, will scatter, and
breake vp like a Mist.
                  
                      It is certaine, that Sound is not produced at the first, but with some
Locall Motion of the Aire, or Flame, or some other Medium; Nor yet without
some Resistance, either in the Aire, or the Body Percussed. For if there
be a meere Yeelding, or Cession, it produceth no Sound; As hath beene
said. And therin Sounds differ from Light, and Colours; which passe
thorow the Aire, or other Bodies, without any Locall Motion of the Aire;
either at the first, or after. But you must attentiuely distinguish, betweene
the Locall Motion of the Aire, (which is but Vehiculum Caussae, A
Carrier of the Sounds,) and the Sounds themselues, Conueighed in the
Aire. For as to the former, we see manifestly, that no Sound is produced
(no not by Aire it selfe against other Aire, as in Organs, &amp;c.) but with
a perceptible Blast of the Aire; And with some Resistance of the Aire
strucken. For euen all Speech, (which is one of the gentlest Motions of
Aire,) is with Expulsion of a little Breath. And all Pipes haue a Blast,
as well as a Sound. We see also manifestly, that Sounds are carried with
Wind: And therefore Sounds will be heard further with the Wind, than
against the Wind; And likewise doe rise and fall with the Intension or
Remission of the Wind. But for the Impression of the Sound, it is quite another
Thing; And is vtterly without any Locall Motion of the Aire, Perceptible;
And in that resembleth the Species visible: For after a Man
hath lured, or a Bell is rung, we cannot discerne any Perceptible Motion
(at all) in the Aire, a long as the Sound goeth; but only at the first. Neither
doth the Wind (as far as it carrieth a Voice,) with the Motion therof,
confound any of the Delicate, and Articulate Figurations of the Aire,
in Variety of Words. And if a Man speake a good loudnesse, against

the Flame of a Candle, it will not make it tremble much; though most,
when those Letters are pronounced, which contract the Mouth; As F,
S,V, and some others. But Gentle Breathing, or Blowing without speaking,
will moue the Candle far more. And it is the more probable, that Sound
is without any Locall Motion of the Aire, because as it differeth from the
Sight, in that it needeth a Locall Motion of the Aire at first; So it paralleleth
in so many other things with the Sight, and Radiation of Things visible;
Which (without all question) induce no Locall Motion in the Aire,
as hath beene said.
                  Neuerthelesse it is true, that vpon the Noise of Thunder, and great 
                     Ordnance; Glasse windowes will shake; and Fishes are thought to be
frayed with the Motion, caused by Noise vpon the water. But these Effects
are from the Locall Motion of the Aire, which is a Concomitant
of the Sound, (as hath beene said;) and not from the Sound.
                  
                  It hath beene anciently reported, and is still receiued, that Extreme 
Applanses, and Shouting of People assembled in great Multitudes, haue
so rarified, and broken the Aire, that Birds flying ouer, haue fallen
downe, the Aire being not able to support them. And it is beleeued by
some, that Great Ringing of Bells in populous Cities, hath chased away
Thunder: and also dissipated Pestilent Aire: All which may be also from
the Concussion of the Aire, and not from the Sound.
                  
                  A very great Sound, neare hand, hath strucken many Dease; And at 
the Instant they haue found, as it were, the breaking of a Skin or Parchment
in their Eare: And my Selfe standing neare one that Lured loud,
and shrill, had suddenly an Offence, as if somewhat had broken, or
beene dislocated in my Eare; And immediately after, a loud Ringing;
(Not an ordinary Singing, or Hissing, but far louder, and differing;) so
as I feared some Deafenesse. But after some halfe Quarter of an Houre
it vanished. This Effect may be truly referred vnto the Sound: For (as
is commonly receiued) an ouer-potent Obiect doth destroy the Sense;
And Spirituall Species, (both Visible, and Audible,) will worke vpon the
Sensories, though they moue not any other Body.
                  In Delation of Sounds, the Enclosure of them preserueth them, and 
causeth them to be heard further. And wee finde in Roules of Parchment,
or Trunckes, the Mouth being laid to the one end of the Rowle
of Parchment, or Truncke, and the Eare to the other, the Sound is heard
much further, than in the Open Aire; The Cause is, for that the Sound
spendeth, and is dissipated in the Open Aire; But in such Concaues it is
conserued, and contracted. So also in a Peece of Ordnance, if you speak
in the Touch-hole, and another lay his Eare to the Mouth of the Peece,
the Sound passeth, and is farre better heard, than in the Open Aire.
                  
                  It is further to be considered, how it proueth and worketh, when 
the Sound is not enclosed all the Length of his Way, but passeth partly
through open Aire; As where you speake some distance from a
Truncke; or where the Eare is some distance from the Truncke; at the other
End; Or where both Mouth and Eare are distant from the Truncke. And

it is tried, that in a long Truncke, of some eight or ten foot, the Sound is
holpen, though both the Mouth, and the Eare be a handfull, or more,
from the Ends of the Truncke; And somewhat more holpen, when the
Eare of the Hearer is neare, than when the Mouth of the Speaker. And it
is certaine, that the Voice is better heard in a Chamber from abroad, than
abroad from within the Chamber.
                  
                  
                      As the Enclosure, that is Round about and Entire, preserueth the Sound;
So doth a Semi-Concaue, though in a lesse degree. And therefore, if you
diuide a Truncke, or a Cane into two, and one speake at the one end, and
you lay your Eare at the other, it will carry the Voice further, than in the
Aire at large. Nay further, if it be not a full Semi-Concaue; but if you
doe the like vpon the Mast of a Ship, or a long Pole, or a Peece of Ordnance
(though one speake vpon the Surface of the Ordnance, and not at any of
the Bores;) the Voice will be heard further, than in the Aire at large.
                  
                      It would be tried, how, and with what proportion of disaduantage,
the Voice will be carried in an Horne, which is a line Arched; Or in a
Trumpet, which is a line Retorted; Or in some Pipe that were Sinuous.
                  
                      It is certaine, (howsoeuer it crosse the Receiued Opinion) that
Sounds may be created without Aire, though Aire be the most fauourable
Deferent of Sounds. Take a Vessell of Water, and knap a paire of Tongs
some depth within the Water, and you shall heare the Sound of the
Tongs well, and not much diminished; And yet there is no Aire at all
present.
                  
                      Take one Vessell of Siluer, and another of Wood, and fill each of them
full of Water, and then knap the Tongs together, as before, about an
handfull from the Bottome, and you shall finde the Sound much more
Resounding from the Vessell of Siluer, than from that of Wood; And yet
if there be not water in the Vessell, so that yo knap the Tongs in the
Aire, you shall finde no difference, betweene the Siluer and Woodden
Vessell. Whereby, beside the maine point of creating Sound without
Aire, you may collect two Things: The one, that the Sound communicateth
with the Bottome of the Vessell: The other, that such a Communication
passeth farre better, thorow Water, than Aire.
                  
                  
                      Strike any Hard Bodies together, in the Middest of a Flame, and you
shall heare the Sound, with little difference, from the Sound in the
Aire.
                  
                  
                      The Pneumaticall Part, which is in all Tangible Bodies, and hath some
Affinity with the Aire, performeth, in some degree, the Parts of the
Aire; As when you knocke vpon an Emptie Barrell, the Sound is (in part)
created by the Aire on the Out-side; And (in part) by the Aire in the
Inside; For the Sound will be greater or lesser, as the Barrell is more
Emptie, or more full; But yet the Sound participateth also with the
Spirit in the Wood, thorow which it passeth, from the Outside to the Inside:
And so it commeth to passe, in the Chiming of Bells, on the Outside;
where also the Sound passeth to the Inside: And a number of other

like Instances, whereof we shall speake more, when we handle the
Communication of Sounds.
                  
                  It were extreame Grossenesse to thinke, (as wee haue partly touched 
before,) that the Sound in Strings is made, or produced, betweene the
Hand and the String, or the Quill and the String, or the Bow and the
String: For those are but Vehicula Motûs, Passages to the Creation of the
Sound; the Sound being produced betweene the String and the Aire;
And that not by any Impulsion of the Aire from the first Motion of the
String; but by the Returne or Result of the String, which was strained by
the Touch, to his former Place: which Motion of Result is quicke and
sharpe; Wheras the first Motion, is soft and dull. So the Bow tortureth
the String continually, and thereby holdeth it in a Continuall Trepidation.
                  
                  Take a Truncke, and let one whistle at the one End, and bold your
Eare at the other, and you shall finde the Sound strike so sharpe, as you
can scarce endure it.Experiments in Cōsort touching the Magnitude, and Exiluy, and Damps of Sounds.
                     
The Cause is, for that Sound diffuseth it selfe in
round; And so spendeth it Selfe; But if the Sound, which would scatter
in Open Aire, be made to goe all into a Canale; It must needs giue greater
force to the Sound. And so you may note, that Enclosures doe not 
onely preserue Sound, but also Encrease and Sharpen it.
                  A Hunters Horne, being greater at one end, than at the other, doth 
encrease the Sound more, than if the Horne were all of an equall Bore.
The Cause is, for that the Aire, and Sound, being first contracted at the
leffer End, and afterwards hauing more Roome to spread at the greater
End; doe dilate themselues; And in Comming out strike more Aire;
whereby the Sound is the Greater, and Baser. And euen Hunters Hornes,
which are sometimes made straight, and not Oblique, are euer greater
at the lower end. It would be tried also in Pipes, being made far larger
at the lower End: Or being made with a Belly towards the lower End,
And then issuing into a straight Concaue againe.
                  There is in Saint Iames Fields, a Conduit of Bricke, vnto which ioyneth 
a low Vault; And at the End of that, a Round House of Stone: And
in the Bricke Conduit there is a Window; And in the Round House a Slit
or Rift of some little breadth: If you crie out in the Rift, it will make a
fearfull Roaring at the Window. The Cause is the same with the former;
For that all Concaues, that proceed from more Narrow to more
Broad, doe amplifie the Sound at the Comming out.
                  
                     Hawkes Bells, that haue Holes in the sides, giue a greater Ring, than 
if the Pellet did strike vpon Brasse, in the Open Aire. The Cause is the
same with the first Instance of the Trancke; Namely, for that the Sound
Enclosed with the Sides of the Bell, commeth forth at the Holes vnspent,
and more strong.
                  In Drums, the Closenesse round about, that preserueth the Sound
                     
from dispersing, maketh the Noise come forth at the Drum-Hole, farre
more loud, and strong, than if you should strike vpon the like Skin, extended

in the Open Aire. The Cause is the same with the two precedent.
                  
                     
                     Sounds are better heard, and further off, in an Euening, or in the
Night, than at the Noone, or in the Day. The Cause is, for that in the Day,
when the Aire is more Thin, (no doubt) the Sound pierceth better; But
when the Aire is more Thicke, (as in the Night) the Sound spendeth and
spreadeth abroad lesse: And so it is a Degree of Enclosure. As for the
Night, it is true also, that the Generall Silence helpeth.
                  
                      There be two Kinds of Reflexions of Sounds; The one at Distance,
which is the Eccho; Wherein the Originall is heard distinctly, and the
Reflexion also distinctly; Of which we shall speake hereafter: The other
in Concurrence; When the Sound Reflecting (the Reflexion being neare
at hand) returneth immediatly vpon the Originall, and so iterateth it not,
but amplifieth it. Therefore we see, that Musicke vpon the water soundeth
more; And so likewise Musicke is better in Chambers Wainscotted,
than Hanged.
                  
                      The Strings of a Lute, or Violl, or Virginalls, doe giue a far greater
Sound, by reason of the Knot, and Board, and Concaue vnderneath, than
if there were nothing but onely the Flat of a Board, without that Hollow
and Knot, to let in the Vpper Aire into the Lower. The Cause is, the
Communication of the Vpper Aire with the Lower; And Penning of
both from Expence, or Dispersing.
                  
                      An Irish Harpe hath Open Aire on both sides of the Strings: And
it hath the Concaue or Belly, not along the Strings, but at the End of the
Strings. It maketh a more Resounding Sound, than a Bandora, Orpharion,
or Citterne, which haue likewise Wire-strings. I iudge the Cause to be, for
that Open Aire on both Sides helpeth, so that there be a Concaue; Which
is therefore best placed at the End.
                  
                      In a Virginall, when the Lid is downe, it maketh a more exile Sound,
than when the Lid is open. The Cause is, for that all Shutting in of Aire,
where there is no competent Vent, dampeth the Sound. Which maintaineth
likewise the former Instance; For the Belly of the Lute, or Vi
                           •
                        ll,
doth pen the Aire somewhat.
                  
                      There is a Church at Glocester, (and as I haue heard the like is in some
other places;) where if you speake against a Wall, softly, another shall
heare your Voice better a good way off, than neare hand. Enquire more
particularly of the Frame of that Place. I suppose there is some Vault,
or Hollow, or Isle, behinde the Wall, and some Passage to it towards
the further end of that Wall, against which you speake; So as the Voice,
of him that speaketh, slideth along the Wall, and then entreth at some
Passage, and communicateth with the Aire of the Hollow; For it is preserued
somewhat by the plaine wall; but that is too weake to giue a
Sound Audible, till it hath communicated with the backe Aire.
                  
                  
                      Strike vpon a Bowstring, and lay the Horne of the Bow neare your
Eare, and it will encrease the Sound, and make a degree of a Tone. The
Cause is, for that the Sensory, by reason of the Close Holding, is percussed

before the Aire disperseth. The like is, if yo hold the Horne
betwixt your Teeth. But that is a plaine Delation of the Sound; from the
Teeth, to the Instrument of Hearing; For there is a great Entercourse
betweene those two Parts; As appeareth by this; That a Harsh Grating
Tune setteth the Teeth on edge. The like falleth out, if the Horne of the
Bow be put vpon the Temples; But that is but the Slide of the Sound
from thence to the Eare.
                  If you take a Rod of Iron, or Brasse, and hold the one end to your 
Eare, and strike vpon the other, it maketh a fat greater Sound, than the
like Stroke vpon the Rod, not so made Contiguous to the Eare. By
which, and by some other Instances, that haue beene partly touched, it
should appeare; That Sounds doe not onely slide vpon the Surface of a
Smooth Body, but doe also communicate with the Spirits, that are in
the Pores of the Body.
                  I remember in Trinity Colledge in Cambridge, there was an Vpper 
Chamber, which being thought weake in the Roofe of it, was supported
by a Pillar of Iron, of the bignesse of ones Arme, in the middest of the
Chamber; Which if you had strucke, it would make a little flat Noise
in the Roome where it was strucke; But it would make a great Bombe in
the Chamber beneath.
                  The Sound which is made by Buckets in a Well, when they touch vpon 
the Water; Or when they strike vpon the side of the Well; Or when
two Buckets dash the one against the other; These Sounds are deeper,
and suller, than if the like Percussion were made in the Open Aire. The
Cause is, the Penning and Enclosure of the Aire, in the Concaue of the
Well.
                  
                  
                     Barrells placed in a Roome vnder the Floare of a Chamber, make all 
                     Noises in the same Chamber, more Full and Resounding.
                  
                     So that there be fine wayes (in generall,) of Maioration of Sounds: Enclosure
Simple; Enclosure with Dilatation; Communication; Reflexion
Concurrent; and Approach to the Sensory.
                  For Exility of the Voice, or other Sounds: It is certaine, that the 
                     Voice doth passe thorow Solide and Hard Bodies, if they be not too thick.
And thorow Water; which is likewise a very Close Body, and such an
one, as letteth not in Aire. But then the Voice, or other Sound, is reduced,
by such passage, to a great Weaknesse, or Exility. If therefore you
stop the Holes of a Howkes Bell, it will make no Ring, but a flat Noise, or
Rattle. And so doth the Aëtites, or Eagles Stone, which hath a little
Stone within it.
                  And as for Water, it is a certaine Triall: Let a Man goe into a Bath,
                     
and take a Paile, and turne the Bottome vpward, and carry the Mouth
of it, (Euen,) downe to the Leuell of the Water; and so presse it downe
vnder the Water, some handfull and an halfe, still keeping it euen, that it
may not tilt on either side, &amp; so the Aire get out: Then let him that is in
the Bath, diue with his Head so far vnder Water, as he may put his Head
into the Paile; &amp; there wil come as much Aire bubling forth, as will make

Roome for his Head. Then let him speak; and any that shal stand without,
shal heare his Voice plainly; but yet made extreme sharp and exile, like the
Voice of Puppets: But yet the Articulate Sounds of the Words will not be cō
                     founded.
Note that it may be much more handsomely done, if the Paile
be put ouer the Mans head aboue Water, and then he cowre downe, and
the Paile be pressed downe with him. Note that a Man must kneele or sit,
that he may be lower than the Water. A Man would thinke, that the Sicilian
Poet had knowledge of this Experiment; For he saith; That Hercules
Page Hylas went with a Water-pot, to fill it at a pleasant Fountaine,
that was neere the Shore, and that the Nymphs of the Fountaine fell in
loue with the Boy, and pulled him vnder Water, keeping him aliue; And
that Hercules missing his Page, called him by his Name, aloud, that all
the Shore rang of it; And that Hylas from within the Water, answered
his Master; But (that which is to the present purpose) with so small and
exile a Voice, as Hercules thought he had beene three miles off, when the
Fountaine (indeed) was fast by.
                  
                      In Lutes, and Instruments of Strings, if you stop a String high, (whereby
it hath lesse Scope to tremble) the Sound is more Treble, but yet more
dead.
                  
                      Take two Sawcers, and strike the Edge of the one against the Bottome
of the other, within a Paile of Water; And you shall finde, that as you
put the Sawcers lower, and lower, the Sound groweth more flat; euen
while Part of the Sawcer is aboue the Water; But that Flatnesse of Sound
is ioyned with a Harshnesse of Sound; which (no doubt) is caused by the
Inequalitie of the Sound, which commeth from the Part of the Sawcer
vnder the Water, and from the Part aboue. But when the Sawcer is
wholly vnder the Water, the Sound becommeth more cleare, but farre
more low; And as if the Sound came from a farre off.
                  
                      A Soft Body dampeth the Sound, much more than a Hard; As if a Bell
hath Cloth, or Silke wrapped about it, it deadeth the Sound more, than
if it were Wood. And therefore in Clericalls, the Keyes are lined; And
in Colledges they vse to line the Tablemen.
                  
                      Triall was made in a Recorder, after these seuerall manners. The Bottome
of it was set against the Palme of the Hand; stopped with Wax
round about; set against a Damaske Cushion; Thrust into Sand; Into
Ashes; Into Water, (halfe an Inch vnder the Water;) Close to the Bottome
of a Siluer Basin; And still the Tone remained: But the Bottome
of it was set against a Woollen Carpet; A Lining of Plush; A Locke of
Wooll, (though loosely put in;) Against Snow; And the Sound of it
was quite deaded, and but Breath.
                  
                     
                     Iron Hot produceth not so full a Sound, as when it is Cold; For while
it is hot, it appeareth to be more Soft, and lesse Resounding. So likewise
Warme Water, when it falleth, maketh not so full a Sound, as Cold: And
I conceiue it is softer, and neerer the Nature of Oyle; For it is more slippery;
As may be perceiued, in that it scowreth better.
                  
                      Let there be a Recorder made, with two Fipples at each end one; The

                     Truncke of it of the length of two Recorders, and the Holes answerable
toward each end; And let two play the same Lesson vpon it, at an Vnison;
And let it be noted, whether the Sound be confounded; or amplified;
or dulled. So likewise let a Crosse be made, of two Trunckes
(thorow-out) hollow; And let two speake, or sing, the one long-waies,
the other trauerse: And let two heare at the opposite Ends; And note,
whether the Sound be confounded; amplified; or dulled. Which two
Instances will also giue light to the Mixture of Sounds; wherof we shall
speake hereafter.
                  A Bellowes blowne in at the Hole of a Drum, and the Drum then 
strucken, maketh the Sound a little flatter, but no other apparent Alteration.
The Cause is manifest; Partly for that it hindreth the Issue of the
Sound; And partly for that it maketh the Aire, being blowne together,
lesse moueable.
                  The Loudnesse, and Softnesse of Sounds, is a Thing distinct from the
Magnitude and Exility of Sounds; For a Base String, though softly strucken,
giueth the greater Sound; But a Treble String, if hard strucken, will
be heard much further off.
                        Experiments in Consort touching the Loudnesse or Sofinesse of Sounds; and their Carriage at longer or shorter Distance.
And the Cause is, for that the Base String
striketh more Aire; And the Treble lesse Aire, but with a sharper Percussion.
                  It is therefore the Strength of the Percussion, that is a Principall Cause
of the Loudnesse or Softnesse of Sounds: As in knocking harder or softer; 
Winding of a Horne stronger or weaker; Ringing of a Hand-bell harder 
or softer, &amp;c. And the Strength of this Percussion, consisteth, as much,
or more, in the Hardnesse of the Body Percussed, as in the Force of the Body
Percussing: For if you strike against a Cloth, it will giue a lesse Sound;
If against Wood, a greater; If against Metall, yet a greater; And in
Metals, if you strike against Gold, (which is the more pliant,) it giueth
the flatter Sound; If against Siluer, or Brasse, the more Ringing Sound.
As for Aire, where it is strongly pent, it matcheth a Hard Body. And
therefore we see in discharging of a Peece, what a great Noise it maketh.
We see also, that the Charge with Bullet; Or with Paper wet, and hard
stopped; Or with Powder alone, rammed in hard; maketh no great
difference in the Loudnesse of the Report.
                  The Sharpnesse or Quicknesse of the Percussion, is a great Cause of the 
                     Loudnesse, as well as the Strength: As in a Whip, or Wand, if you strike
the Aire with it; the Sharper and Quicker you strike it, the Louder Sound
it giueth. And in playing vpon the Lute, or Virginalls, the quicke Stroke
or Touch, is a great life to the Sound. The Cause is, for that the Quicke
Striking cutteth the Aire speedily; wheras the Soft Striking doth rather
beat, than cut.
                  The Communication of Sounds (as in Bellies of Lutes, Empty
Vessells, &amp;c.) hath beene touched obiter, in the Maioration
of Sounds: But it is fit also to make a Title of it apart.Experiments in Consort touching the Communication of Sounds.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                      The Experiment for greatest Demonstration of Communication of
Sounds, is the Chiming of Bells; where if you strike with a Hammer vpon
the Vpper Part, and then vpon the Midst, and then vpon the Lower,
you shall finde the Sound to be more Treble, and more Base, according
vnto the Concaue, on the Inside; though the Percussion be onely on
the Outside.
                  
                      When the Sound is created betweene the Blast of the Mouth, and the
Aire of the Pipe, it hath neuerthelesse some Communication with the
Matter of the Sides of the Pipe, and the Spirits in them contained; for
in a Pipe, or Trumpet, of Wood, and Brasse, the Sound will be diuers; So
if the Pipe be couered with Cloth, or Silke, it will giue a diuers Sound,
from that it would doe of it selfe; So, if the Pipe be a little wet on the Inside,
it will make a differing Sound, from the same Pipe dry.
                  
                  
                      That Sound made within Water, doth communicate better with a
hard Body thorow Water, than made in Aire, it doth with Aire; Vide
Experimentum, 134.
                  We haue spoken before (in the Inquisition touching Musicke,)
of Musicall Sounds, wherunto there may be a Concord
or Discord in two Parts; Which Sounds vve call Tones: And
likewise of Immusicall Sounds; And haue giuen the Cause, that
the Tone proceedeth of Equality, and the other of Inequality.
And we haue also expressed there, what are the Equall Bodies
that giue Tones, and what are the Vnequall that giue none.Experiments in Cōsort touching Equality, and Inequality of Sounds.
                      But
now we shall speake of such Inequality of Sounds, as proceedeth,
not from the Nature of the Bodies themselues, but is
Accidentall; Either from the Roughnesse, or Obliquity of the
Passage; Or from the Doubling of the Percutient; Or from
the Trepidation of the Motion.
                  
                  
                      A Bell, if it haue a Rift in it, whereby the Sound hath not a cleare
Passage, giueth a Hoarse and Iarring Sound; So the Voice of Man, when
by Cold taken the Wesill groweth rugged, and (as we call it) furred,
becommeth hoarse. And in these two Instances, the Sounds are Ingrate;
because they are meerely Vnequall: But, if they be Vnequall in Equality,
then the Sound is Gratefull, but Purling.
                  
                      All Instruments, that haue either Returnes, as Trumpets; Or Flexions,
as Cornets; Or are Drawne vp, and put from, as Sackbuts; haue a Purling
Sound; But the Recorder, or Flute, that haue none of these Inequalities,
giue a cleare Sound. Neuerthelesse, the Recorder it selfe, or Pipe
moistened a little in the Inside, soundeth more solemnly, and with a little
Purling, or Hissing. Againe, a Wreathed String, such as are in the
Base Strings of Banderaes, giueth also a Purling Sound.
                  
                  
                      But a Lute-string, if it be meerely Vnequall in his Parts, giueth a Harsh

and Vntuneable Sound; which Strings we call False, being bigger in one
Place than in another; And therefore Wire-strings are neuer False. We
see also, that when we try a False Lute-string, wee vse to extend it hard
betweene the fingers, and to fillip it; And if it giueth a double Species, it
is True; But if it giueth a treble, or more, it is False.
                  
                  
                     Waters, in the Noise they make as they runne, represent to the Eare 
a Trembling Noise; And in Regalls, (where they haue a Pipe, they call the
Nightingale-Pipe, which containeth Water) the Sound hath a continuall
Trembling: And Children haue also little Things they call Cockes,
which haue Water in them; And when they blow, or whistle in them,
they yeeld a Trembling Noise; Which Trembling of Water, hath an assinity
with the Letter L. All which Inequalities of Trepidation, are rather
pleasant, than otherwise.
                  
                      All Base Notes, or very Treble Notes, giue an Asper Sound; For that
the Base striketh more Aire, than it can well strike equally: And the Treble
cutteth the Aire so sharpe, as it returneth too swift, to make the
Sound Equall: And therefore a Meane, or Tenor, is the sweetest Part.
                  We know Nothing, that can at pleasure make a Musicall, or Immusicall 
Sound, by voluntary Motion, but the Voice of Man, and Birds. The
Cause is, (no doubt) in the Weasill or Wind-pipe, (which we call Aspera
Arteria,) which being well extended, gathereth Equality; As a Bladder
that is wrinckled, if it be extended, becommeth smooth. The Extension
is alwaies more in Tones, than in Speech: Therefore the Inward
Voice of Whisper can neuer a giue Tone: And in Singing, there is (manifestly)
a greater Working and Labour of the Throat, than in Speaking; As
appeareth in the Thrusting out, or Drawing in of the Chinne, when
we sing.
                  The Humming of Bees, is an Vnequall Buzzing; And is conceiued, by 
some of the Ancients, not to come forth at their Mouth, but to be an

                        Inward Sound, But (it may be) it is neither; But from the motion of their
Wings; For it is not heard but when they stirre.
                  All Metalls quenched in Water, giue a Sibilation or Hissing Sound; 
(which hath an Affinity with the letter Z.) notwithstanding the Sound
be created betweene the Water or Vapour, and the Aire. Seething also, if
there be but small Store of Water, in a Vessell, giueth a Hissing Sound;
But Boyling in a full Vessell, giueth a Bubling Sound, drawing somewhat
neare to the Cocks vsed by Children.
                  Triall would be made, whether the Inequality, or Interchange of the 
                     Medium, will not produce an Inequality of Sound; As if three Bells were
made one within another, and Aire betwixt Each; And then the outermost
Bell were chimed with a Hammer, how the Sound would differ
from a Simple Bell. So likewise take a Plate of Brasse, and a Plancke of
Wood, and ioyne them close together, and knock vpon one of them, and
see if they doe not giue an vnequall Sound. So make two or three Partitions or Wood in a Hogshead, with Holes or Knots in them; And marke
the difference of their Sound, from the Sound of an Hogshead, without
such Partitions.
                  
                  
                     It is euident, that the Percussion of the Greater Quantity of Aire, causeth
the Baser Sound; And the lesse Quantity, the more Treble Sound.
                     Experiments in Consort,  touching the 
                           
                              •••
                            treble, and the 
                           
                              •••
                            Base Tones, or Musicall Sounds.
                      The
Percussion of the Greater Quantity of Aire, is produced by the Greatnesse
of the Body Percussing; By the Latitude of the Concaue, by which the Sound
                      passeth; and by the Longitude of the same Concaue. Therfore we see that a
Base string, is greater than a Treble; A Base Pipe hath a greater Bore than
a Treble; And in Pipes, and the like, the lower the Note Holes be, and
the further off from the Mouth of the Pipe, the more Base Sound they
yeeld; And the nearer the Mouth, the more Treble. Nay more, if you
strike an Entire Body, as an Andiron of Brasse, at the Top, it maketh a
more Treble Sound; And at the Bottome a Baser.
                  
                  
                      It is also euident, that the Sharper or Quicker Percussion of Aire causeth
the more Treble Sound; And the Slower or Heauier, the more Base
Sound. So we see in Strings; the more they are wound vp, and strained;
(And thereby giue a more quicke Start-backe;) the more Treble is the
Sound; And the slacker they are, or lesse wound vp, the Baser is the
Sound. And therfore a Bigger String more strained, and a Lesser String,
lesse strained, may fall into the same Tone.
                  
                  
                     
                     Children, Women, Eunuchs haue more small and shrill Voices, than
Men. The Reason is, not for that Men haue greater Heat, which may
make the Voice stronger, (for the strength of a Voice or Sound, doth make
a difference in the Loudnesse or Softnesse, but not in the Tone;) But from
the Dilatation of the Organ; which (it is true) is likewise caused by
Heat. But the Cause of Changing the Voice, at the yeares of Puberty, is
more obscure. It seemeth to be, for that when much of the Moisture of
the Body, which did before irrigate the Parts, is drawne downe to the
Spermaticall vessells; it leaueth the Body more hot than it was; whence
commeth the Dilatation of the Pipes: For we see plainly, all Effects of
Heat, doe then come on; As Pilosity, more Roughnesse of the Skinne,
Hardnesse of the Flesh, &amp;c.
                  
                      The Industry of the Musitian, hath produced two other Meanes of
Strayning, or Intension of Strings, besides their Winding vp. The one is the
Stopping of the String with the Finger; As in the Necks of Lutes, Viols,
&amp;c. The other is the Shortnesse of the String; As in Harps, Virginalls, &amp;c.
Both these haue one, and the same reason; For they cause the String to
giue a quicker Start.
                  
                      In the Straining of a String, the further it is strained, the lesse Superstraining
goeth to a Note; For it requireth good Winding of a String,
before it will make any Note at all: And in the Stops of Lutes, &amp;c. the
higher they goe, the lesse Distance is betweene the Frets.
                  
                      If you fill a Drinking-Glasse with Water, (especially one Sharp below,
and Wide aboue,) and fillip vpon the Brim, or Outside; And after empty
Part of the Water, and so more and more, and still try the Tone by Fillipping;
you shall finde the Tone fall, and be more Base, as the Glasse is
more Empty.
                  
                     The Iust and Measured Proportion of the Aire Percussed, towards
the Basenesse or Treblenesse of Tones, is one of the greatest
Secrets in the Contemplation of Sounds.
                     Experiments in Consort touching the Proportion of Treble and Base Tones.
                      For it discouereth the
true Coincidence of Tones into Diapasons; Which is the Returne
of the same Sound. And so of the Concords and Discords, betweene
the Vnison, and Diapason; Which we haue touched
before, in the Experiments of Musicke; but thinke fit to resume
it here, as a principall Part of our Enquiry touching
the Nature of Sounds. It may be found out in the Proportion
of the Winding of Strings; In the Proportion of the Distance
of Frets; And in the Proportion of the Concaue of Pipes, &amp;c.
But most commodiously in the last of these.
                  Try therfore the Winding of a String once about, as soone as it is 
brought to that Extension, as will giue a Tone; And then of twice about;
And thrice about, &amp;c. And marke the Scale or Difference of the Rise of
the Tone: Wherby you shall discouer, in one, two Effects; Both the
Proportion of the Sound towards the Dimension of the Winding; And the
Proportion likewife of the Sound towards the String, as it is more or lesse
strained. But note that to measure this, the way will be, to take the
Length in a right Line of the String, vpon any Winding about of the
Pegge.
                  As for the Steps, you are to take the Number of Frets; And principally 
the Length of the Line, from the first Stop of the String, vnto such
a Stop as shall produce a Diapason to the former Stop, vpon the same
String.
                  
                  But it will best (as it is said) appeare, in the Bores of Wind-Instruments:
                     
And therfore cause some halfe dozen Pipes, to be made, in length, and
all things else, alike, with a single, double, and so on to a sextuple Bore;
And so marke what Fall of Tone euery one giueth. But still in these three
last Instances, you must diligently obserue, what length of String, or Distance
of Stop, or Concaue of Aire, maketh what Rise of Sound. As in the
last of these (which (as we said) is that, which giueth the aptest demonstration,)
you must set downe what Encrease of Concaue goeth to the
Making of a Note higher; And what of two Notes; And what of three
Notes; And so vp to the Diapason: For then the great Secret of Numbers,
and Proportions, will appeare. It is not vnlike, that those that make Recorders,
&amp;c. know this already: for that they make them in Sets. And likewise
Bell-founders in fitting the tune of their Bells. So that Enquiry may
saue Triall. Surely, it hath beene obserued by one of the Ancients, that
an Empty Barrell knocked vpon with the finger, giueth a Diapason to the
Sound of the like Barrellfull; But how that should be, I doe not well vnderstand;
For that the knocking of a Barrellfull, or Empty, doth scarce
giue any Tone.
                  
                  
                     
                      There is required some sensible Difference in the Proportion of creating
a Note, towards the Sound it selfe, which is the Passiue: And that it
be not too neare, but at a distance. For in a Recorder, the three vppermost
Holes, yeeld one Tone; which is a Note lower than the Tone of the
first three. And the like (no doubt) is required in the Winding or Stopping
of Strings.
                  
                  There is another Difference of Sounds, which we will call
Exteriour, and Interiour.
                     Experiments in Consort touching Exteriour, and Interiour Sounds.
                      It is not Soft, nor Loud: Nor it is not
Base, nor Treble: Nor it is not Musicall, nor Immusicall: Though
it be true, that there can be no Tone in an Interiour Sound: But
on the other side, in an Exteriour Sound, there may be both
Musicall and Immusicall. We shall therfore enumerate them, rather
than precisely distinguish them; Though (to make some
Adumbration of that we meane) the Interiour is rather an Impulsion
or Contusion of the Aire, than an Elision or Section of the
same. So as the Percussion of the one, towards the other, differeth,
as a Blow differeth from a Cut.
                  
                  
                      In Speech of Man, the Whispering, (which they call Susurrus in Latine,)
whether it be louder or softer, is an Interiour Sound; But the Speaking out,
is an Exteriour Sound; And therfore you can neuer make a Tone,
not sing in Whispering; But in Speech you may: So Breathing, or Blowing
by the Mouth, Bellowes, or Wind, (though loud) is an Interiour Sound; But
the Blowing thorow a Pipe, or Concaue, (though soft) is an Exteriour. So
likewise, the greatest Winds, if they haue no Coarctation, or blow not
hollow, giue an Interiour Sound; The Whistling or hollow Wind yeeldeth
a Singing, or Exteriour Sound; The former being pent by some other
Body; The latter being pent in by his owne Density: And therfore we
see, that when the Wind bloweth hollow, it is a Signe of Raine. The
Flame, as it moueth within it selfe, or is blowne by a Bellowes, giueth a
Murmur or Interiour Sound.
                  
                  
                      There is no Hard Body, but strucke against another Hard Body, will
yeeld an Exteriour Sound, greater or lesser: In so much as if the Percussion
be ouer-soft, it may induce a Nullity of Sound; But neuer an Interiour
Sound; As when one treadeth so softly, that he is not heard.
                  
                      Where the Aire is the Percutient, pent, or not pent, against a Hard
Body, it neuer giueth an Exteriour Sound; As if you blow strongly with
a Bellowes against a Wall.
                  
                     
                     Sounds (both Exteriour and Interiour,) may be made, as well by
Suction, as by Emission of the Breath: As in Whistling, or Breathing.
                  
                  It is euident, and it is one of the strangest Secrets in Sounds, that the
whole Sound is not in the whole Aire onely; But the whole Sound is also in
 euery small Part of the Aire.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching Articulation of Sounds.
                      So that all the curious Diuersity of Articulate
                     
                     Sounds, of the Voice of Man, or Birds, will enter at a small Cranny,
Inconfused.
                  The Vnequall Agitation of the Winds, and the like, though they bee 
materiall to the Carriage of the Sounds, further, or lesse way; yet they
doe not confound the Articulation of them at all, within that distance
that they can be heard; Though it may be, they make them to be heard
lesse Way, than in a Still; as hath beene partly touched.
                  Ouer-great Distance confoundeth the Articulation of Sounds; As we 
see, that you may heare the Sound of a Preachers voice, or the like, when
you cannot distinguish what he saith. And one Articulate Sound will
confound another; As when many speake at once.
                  In the Experiment of Speaking vnder Water, when the Voice is reduced 
to such an Extreme Exility, yet the Articulate Sounds, (which are
the Words,) are not confounded; as hath beene said.
                  I conceiue, that an Extreme Small, or an Extreme Great Sound, cannot 
be Articulate; But that Articulation requireth a Mediocrity of Sound:
For that the Extreme Small Sound confoundeth the Articulation by Contracting;
And the Great Sound, by Dispersing: And although (as was formerly
said) a Sound Articulate, already created, will be contracted into
a small Cranny; yet the first Articulation requireth more Dimension.
                  It hath beene obserued, that in a Roome, or in a Chappell, Vaulted below,
and Vaulted likewise in the Roofe, a Preacher cannot be heard so
well, as in the like Places not so Vaulted. The Cause is, for that the Subsequent
Words come on, before the Precedent words vanish: And therfore
the Articulate Sounds are more confused, though the Grosse of the
Sound be greater.
                  The Motions of the Tongue, Lips, Throat, Pallat, &amp;c. which goe to the 
                     Making of the seuerall Alphabeticall Letters, are worthy Enquiry, and pertinent
to the present Inquisition of Sounds: But because they are subtill,
and long to describe, we will refer them ouer, and place them amongst
the Experiments of Speech. The Hebrewes haue beene diligent in it, and
haue assigned, which Letters are Labiall, which Dentall, which Gutturall,
&amp;c. As for the Latines, and Grecians, they haue distinguished betweene
Semi-vowels, and Mutes; And in Mutes, betweene Mute Tenues, Media,
and Aspirata; Not amisse; But yet not diligently enough. For the speciall
Strokes, &amp; Motions, that create those Sounds, they haue little enquired:
As that the Letters, B. P. F. M. are not expressed, but with the Contracting, or Shutting of the Mouth; That the Letters N. and B. cannot be
pronounced, but that the Letter N. will turne into M. As Hecatonba, will
be Hecatomba. That M. and T. cannot be pronounced together, but P.
will come betweene; as Emtus, is pronounced Emptus; And a Number
of the like. So that if you enquire to the full; you will finde, that to the
Making of the whole Alphabet, there will be fewer Simple Motions required,
than there are Letters.
                  
                  The Lungs are the most Spongy Part of the Body; And therefore 
ablest to contract, and dilate it selfe: And where it contracteth it selfe,

it expelleth the Aire; which thorow the Artire, Throat, and Mouth, maketh
the Voice: But yet Articulation is not made, but with the helpe of
the Tongue, Pallate, and the rest of those they call Instruments of voice.
                  
                  
                      There is sound a Similitude, betweene the Sound that is made by
Inanimate Bodies, or by Animate Bodies, that haue no Voice Articulate; and
diuers Letters of Articulate Voices: And commonly Men haue giuen such
Names to those Sounds, as doe allude vnto the Articulate Letters. As
Trembling of Water hath Resemblance with the Letter L; Quenching of
Hot Mettalls, with the Letter Z; Snarling of Dogs, with the Letter R; The
Noise of Scritchowles, with the Letter Sh; Voice of Cats, with the Dypthong
Eu; Voice of Cuckoes, with the Dypthong On; Sounds of Strings,
with the Letter Ng: So that if a Man, (for Curiosity, or Strangenesse
sake,) would make a Puppet, or other Dead Body, to
pronounce a Word; Let him consider, on the one Part,
the Motion of the Instruments of Voice; and on
the other part the like Sounds made in Inanimate
Bodies; And what Conformity
there is that causeth the Similitude
of Sounds; And by that
he may minister light to
that Effect.
               
               
                  
                  NATVRALL
HISTORIE.
                  III. Century.
                  ALL Sounds (whatsoeuer) moue Round; That is to 
say; On all Sides; Vpwards; Downwards; Forwards;
and Backwards.
                     
                        Experiments in Consort, touching the Motions of Sounds, in what Lines they are Circular, Oblique, Straight; Vpwards, downwards; Forwards; Backwards. This appeareth in all Instances.
                  
                  
                     Sounds doe not require to bee conueyed to the
Sense, in a Right Line, as Visibles doe, but may be Arched;
Though it be true, they moue strongest in a
Right Line; Which neuerthelesse is not caused by
the Rightnesse of the Line, but by the Shortnesse of the distance; Linea
recta breuissima. And therefore we see, if a Wall be betweene, and you
speake on the one Side, you heare it on the other; Which is not because
the Sound Passeth thorow the Wall; but Archeth ouer the Wall.
                     
                  
                  If the Sound be Stopped and Reperenssed, it commeth about on the other 
Side, in an Oblique Line. So, if in a Coach, one side of the Boot be
downe, and the other vp; And a Begger beg on the Close Side; you
would thinke that he were on the Open Side. So likewise, if a Bell or
Clocke, be (for Example) on the North-side of a Chamber; And the
Window of that Chamber be vpon the South; He that is in the Chamber,
will thinke the Sound came from the South.
                  
                     Sounds, though they spread round, (so that there is an Orbe, or Sphericall 
Area of the Sound;) yet they moue strongest, and goe furthest in
the Fore-lines, from the first Locall Impulsion of the Aire. And therefore
in Preaching, you shall heare the Preachers Voice, better, before
the Pulpit, than behinde it, or on the Sides, though it stand open. So
a Plarquebuz, or Ordnance, will be further heard, forwards, from the
Mouth of the Peece, than backwards, or on the Sides.
                  It may bee doubted, that Sounds doe moue better, Downwards 
                     
than Vpwards, Pulpits are placed high aboue the People. And when
the Ancient Generalls spake to their Armies, they had euer a Mount of
Turfe cast vp, whereupon they stood: But this may be imputed to the
Stops and Obstacles, which the voice meeteth with, when one speaketh
vpon the leuell. But there seemeth to be more in it: For it may bee,
that Spirituall Species, both of Things Visible and Sounds, doe moue better
Downewards than Vpwards. It is a strange Thing, that to Men standing
below on the Ground, those that be on the Top of Pauls, seeme
much lesse then they are, and cannot bee knowne; But to Men aboue,
those below seeme nothing so much lessened, and may bee knowne;
yet it is true, that all things to them aboue, seeme also somewhat contracted,
and better collected into Figure: as Knots in Gardens shew best
from an Vpper window, or Tarras.
                  
                      But to make an exact Triall of it, let a Man stand in a Chamber, not
much aboue the Ground, and speake out at the window, through a
Trunke, to one standing on the Ground, as softly as he can, the other
laying his Eare close to the Truncke: Then viâ versa, let the other speake
below keeping the same Proportion of Softnesse; And let him in the
Chamber lay his Eare to the Trunck: And this may be the aptest Meanes,
to make a Iudgement, whether Sounds descend, or ascend, better.
                  After that Sound is created, (which is in a moment,) wee finde
it continueth some small time, melting by little and little.Experiments in Cōsort touching the Lasting and Perishing of Sounds; And touching the Time they require to their Generation, or Delation.
                      In this there
is a wonderfull Errour amongst Men, who take this to be a Continuance
of the First Sound; whereas (in truth) it is a Renouation, and not a Continuance: For the Body percussed, hath by reason of the Percussion, a Trepidation
wrought in the Minute Parts; and so reneweth the Percussion of
the Aire. This appeareth manifestly, because that the Melting Sound of
a Bell, or of a String strucken, which is thought to be a Continuance,
                      ceaseth as soone as the Bell or String are touched. As in a Virginall, as
soone as euer the Iacke falleth, and toucheth the String, the Sound ceaseth;
And in a Bell, after you haue chimed vpon it, if you touch the
Bell, the Sound ceaseth, And in this you must distingush, that there are
two Trepidations: The one Manifest, and Locall; As of the Bell, when
it is Pensile: The other Secret, of the Minute Parts; such as is described
in the 9th Instance. But it is true, that the Locall helpeth the Secret
great'y. We see likewise that in Pipes, and other winde Instruments, the
Sound lasteth no longer, than the breath bloweth. It is true, that in
Organs, there is a confused Murmur for a while, after you haue plaied;
But that is but while the Bellowes are in Falling.
                  
                      It is certaine, that in the Noise of great Ordnance, where many
are shot off together, the Sound will be carried, (at the least) twenty
Miles vpon the land, and much further vpon the Water. But then it
will come to the Eare; Not in the Instant of the Shooting off, but it
will come an Houre, or more later. This must needs be a Continuance of
the First Sound; For there is no Trepidation which should renew it. And

the Touching of the Ordnance would not extinguish the Sound the sooner:
So that in great Sounds the Continuance is more than Momentany.
                  To try exactly the time wherein Sound is Delated. Let a Man stand in 
a Steeple, and haue with him a Taper; And let some Vaile be put before
the Tapar;
And let another Man stand in the Field a Mile off.
Then let him in the Steeple strike the Bell; And in the same Instant
withdraw the Vaile; And so let him in the Field tell by his Pulse what
distance of Time there is, betweene the Light seene, and the Sound heards
For it is certaine that the Delation of Light is in an Instant. This may be
tried in farre greater Distances, allowing greater Lights and Sounds.
                  
                  It is generally knowne and obserued, that Light, and the Obiect of 
                     Sight, moue swifter than Sound; For we see the Flash of a Peece is seene
sooner, than the Noise is heard. And in Flewing wood, if one be some
distance off, he shall see the Arme lifted vp for a second Stroke, before
he heare the Noise of the first. And the greater the Distance, the greater
is the Preuention: As we see in Thunder, which is farre off; where
the Lightning Precedeth the Cracke a good space.
                  
                     Colours, when they represent themselues to the Eye, fade not, nor 
melt not by Degrees, but appeare still in the same Strength; But Sounds
melt, and vanish, by little and little. The Cause is, for that Colours participate
nothing with the Motion of the Aire; but Sounds doe. And it is
a plaine Argument, that Sound participateth of some Locall Motion, of
the Aire, (as a Cause Sinè quônon.) in that, it perisheth so suddenly; For
in euery Section, or Impulsion of the Aire, the Aire doth suddenly restore
and reunite it selfe; which the Water also doth, but nothing so
swiftly.
                  In the Trialls of the Passage, or Not Passage of Sounds, you
must take heed, you mistake not the Passing By the Sides of a
Body, for the Passing thorow a Body: And therefore you must
make the Intercepting Body very close; For Sound will passe
thorow a small Chincke.Experiments in Consort, touching the Passage and Interceptions of Sounds.
                     
                  
                  Where Sound passeth thorow a Hard, or Close Body (as thorow Water;
                     
thorow a Wall; thorow Metall, as in Hawkes Bells stopped; &amp;c.)
the Hard, or Close Body, must be but thinne and small; For else it deadeth
and extinguisheth the Sound vtterly. And therefore, in the Experiment
of Speaking in Aire vnder Water, the Voice must not be very deepe within
the Water: For then the Sound pierceth not. So if you speake on the
further side of a Close Wall, if the Wall be very thicke, you shall not be
heard:
And if there were an Hogshead emptie, whereof the Sides were
some two Foot thicke, and the Bunghole stopped; I conceiue the Resounding
Sound, by the Communication of the Outward Aire, with the
Aire within, would be little or none, But onely you shall heare the Noise
of the Outward Knocke, as if the Vessell were full.
                  
                     
                      It is certaine, that in the Passage of Sounds thorow Hard Bodies, the
Spirit of Pneumaticall Part of the Hard body it selfe, doth cooperate;
But much better, when the Sides of that Hard Body are strucke, than
when the Percussion is onely within, without: Touch of the Sides: Take
therefore a Hawkes Bell, the holes; stopped vp, and hang it by a threed,
within a Bottle Glasse; And stop the Mouth of the Glasse, very close
with Wax; And then shake the Glasse, and see whether the Bell giue
any Sound at all, or how weake? But note, that you must in stead of the
Threed, take a Wire; Or else let the Glasse haue a great Belly; lest
when you shake the Bell, it dash vpon the Sides of the Glasse.
                  
                      It is plaine, that a very Long, and Downe-right Arch, for the Sound to
passe, will extinguish the Sound quite; So that that Sound, which would
be heard ouer a wall, will not be heard ouer a Church; Nor that Sound,
which will be heard, if you stand some distance from the wall, will be
heard if you stand close vnder the Wall.
                  
                     
                     Soft and Foraminous Bodies, in the first Creation of the Sound, will
dead it; For the Striking against Cloth, or Furre, will make little Sound;
As hath beene said: But in the Passage of the Sound, they will admit it
better than Harder Bodies; As we see, that Curtaines, and Hangings, will
not stay the Sound much; But Glasse-windowes, if they be very Close,
will checke a Sound more, than the like Thicknesse of Cloth. Wee see
also, in the Rumbling of the Belly, how easily the Sound passeth thorow
the Guts, and Skin.
                  
                      It is worthy the Enquiry, whether Great Sounds, (As of Ordnance, or
Bells,) become not more Weake, and Exile, when they passe thorow
Small Crannies. For the Subtilties of Articulate Sounds, (it may be,) may
passe thorow Small Crannies, not confused; But the Magnitude of the
Sound (perhaps,) not so well.
                  The Mediums of Sounds are Aire; Soft and Porous Bodies; Also Water.
                     Experiments in Cōsort touching the Medium of Sounds.
                     
And Hard Bodies refuse not altogether to be Mediums of Sounds. But
all of them are dull and vnapt Deferents, except the Airè.
                  
                  
                      In Aire, the Thinner or Drier Aire, carrieth not the Sound so well, as
 the more Dense; As appeareth in Night Sounds; And Euening Sounds;
And Sounds in moist Weather, and Southerne Winds. The reason is
already mentioned in the Title of Maioration of Sounds; Being for that
Thinne Aire is better pierced; but Thicke Aire preserueth the Sound better
from Wast; Let further Triall be made by Hollowing in Mists, and
Gentle Showers: For (it may be) that will somewhat dead the Sound.
                  
                  
                      How farreforth Flame may be a Medium of Sounds, (especially of
such Sounds as are created by Aire, and not betwixt Hard Bodies) let it be
tried, in Speaking where a Bonsire is betweene; But then you must allow,
for some disturbance, the Noise that the Flame it selfe maketh.
                  
                      Whether any other Liquours, being made Mediums, cause a Diuersity
of Sound from Water, it may be tried: As by the Knapping of the
Tongs; Or Striking of the Bottome of a vessell, filled either with Milke,

or with Oyle; which though they be more light, yet are they more vnequall
Bodies than Aire.
                  Of the Natures of the Mediums, we haue now spoken; As for the Disposition
of the said Mediums, it doth consist in the Penning, or not Penning of
the Aire; Of which we haue spoken before, in the Title of Delation of
Sounds: It consisteth also in the Figure of the Concaue, through which it
passeth; Of which we will speake next.
                  How the Figures of Pipes, or Concaues, through which
Sounds passe; Or of other Bodies deferent; conduce to the
Varietie and Alteration of the Sounds; Either in respect of the
Greater Quantitie, or lesse Quantitie of Aire, which the Concaues
receiue; Or in respect of the Carrying of Sounds longer
or shorter way; Or in respect of many other Circumstances;
they haue beene touched, as falling into other Titles.
                     Experiments in Consort, what the Figures of the Pipes, or Concanes, or the Bodies Diferent conduce to the Sounds.
                      But
those Figures, which we now are to speake of, wee intend to
be, as they concerne the Lines, through which Sound passeth;
As Straight; Crooked; Angular; Circular; &amp;c.
                  The Figure of a Bell pertaketh of the Pyramis, but yet comming off,
and dilating more suddenly. The Figure of a Hunters Horne, and Cornet,
is oblique; yet they haue likewise Straight Heroes; which if they be of
the same Bore with the Oblique, differ little in Sound; Saue that the
Straight require somewhat a stronger Blast. The Figures of Recorders,
and Flates, and Pipes are straight; But the Recorder hath a lesse Bore, and
a greater; Aboue, and below. The Trumpts hath the Figure of the Letter
S: which maketh that Purling Sound, &amp;c. Generally, the Straight Like
hath the cleanest and roundest Sound, And the Crooked the more Hoarse,
and larring.

                      of the Sounds.
I my selfe haue tried, that a Bell of Gold yeeldeth an excellent Sound, not
infariour to that of Siluer, or Brasse, but rather better: yet wee see that a

peece of Money of Gold soundeth farre more flat than a peece of Money
of Siluer.
                  
                  
                      The Harpe hath the Concaue, not along the Strings, but acrosse the
Strings; And no Instrument hath the Sound so Melting, and Prolonged,
as the Irish Harpe. So as I suppose, that if a Virginall were made with a
double Concaue; the one all the length as the Virginall hath; the other at
the End of the Strings, as the Harpe hath; It must needs make the Sound
perfecter, and not so Shallow, and Iarring. You may trie it, without
any Sound-Board along, but only Harpe-wise, at one End of the Strings:
Or lastly with a double Concaue, at Each end of the Strings one.
                  There is an apparent Diuersitie betweene the Species Visible, and Audible,
in this; That the Visible doth not mingle in the Medium, but the Audible
doth.Experiments in Consort touching the Mixture of Sounds.
                      For if wee looke abroad, wee see Heauen, a number of Stars,
Trees, Hills, Men, Beasts, at once. And the Species of the one doth not
 confound the other. But if so many Sounds came from seuerall Parts,
one of them would vtterly confound the other. So wee see, that Voices
or Consorts of Musicke doe make an Harmony by Mixture, which Colours
doe not. It is true neuerthelesse, that a great Light drowneth a smaller,
that it cannot be seene; As the Sunne that of a Gloworme; as well as a
Great Sound drowneth a lesser. And I suppose likewise, that if there
were two Lanthornes of Glasse, the one a Grimsin, and the other an
Azure, and a Candle within either of them, those Coloured Lights
would mingle and cast vpon a White Paper 
                        •
                      Purple Colour. And euen
in Colours, they yeeld a faint and weake Mixture: For white walls make
Roomes more lightsome than blacke, &amp;c. But the Cause of the Confusion
in Sounds, and the Inconfusion in Species Visible, is, For that the Sight
worketh in Right Lines, and maketh seuerall Cones; And so there can be
no Coincidence in the Eye, or Visuall Point: But Sounds, that moue in
Oblique and Arcuate Lines, must needs encounter, and disturbe the one
the other.
                  
                      The sweetest and best Harmony is, when euery Part, or Instrument, is
not heard by it selfe, but a Conflation of them all; Which requireth to
stand some distance off. Euen as it is in the Mixture of Perfumes; Or the
Taking of the Smells of seuerall Flowers in the Aire.
                  
                  
                      The Disposition of the Aire, in other Qualities, except it be ioyned with
Sound, hath no great Operation vpon Sounds: For whether the Aire be
lightsome or darke, hot or cold, quiet or stirring, (except it be with
Noise) sweet-smelling, or stinking, or the like: it importeth not much:
Some petty Alteration or difference it may make.
                  
                      But Sounds doe disturbe and alter the one the other: Sometimes the
one drowning the other, and making it not heard; Sometimes the one
larring and discording with the other, and making a Confusion; Sometimes
the one Mingling and Compounding with the other; and making
an Harmony.
                  
                      Two Voices of like lowdnesse, will not be heard, twice as farre, as one

of them alone; And two Candles of like light, will not make Things
seene twice as farre off, as one. The Cause is profound. But it seemeth
that the Impressions from the Obiects of the Senses, doe mingle respectiu
                        •
                     
                     ly,
euery one with his kinde; But not in proportion, as is before demonstrated:
And the reason may be, because the first Impression, which is
from Priuatiue to Actiue, (As from Silence to Noise, or from Darknesse to
Light,) is a greater Degree, than from Lesse Noise, to More Noise, or
from Lesse Light, to More Light. And the Reason of that againe may be;
For that the Aire, after it hath receiued a Charge, doth not receiue a
Surcharge, or greater Charge, with like Appetite, as it doth the first
Charge. As for the Encrease of Vertue, generally, what Proportion it
beareth to the Encrease of the Matter, it is a large Field, and to be handled
by it selfe.
                  All Reflexions Concurrent doe make Sounds Greater; But if the Body
that createth, either, the Originall Sound, or the Reflexion, be cleane and
smooth, it maketh them Sweeter.Experiments in Consort touching Melioration of Sounds.
                      Triall may be made of a Lute, or
Violl, with the Belly of polished Brasse, in stead of Wood. We see that
euen in the Open Aire, the Wire String is sweeter, than the String of 
                     Guts. And we see that for Reflexion, Water excelleth; As in Musick neare
the Water; Or in Eccho's.
                  
                  It hath beene tried, that a Pipe a little moistened on the inside, but yet 
so as there be no Drops left, maketh a more solemne Sound, than if
the Pipe were dry: But yet with a sweet Degree of Sibilation, or Purling.
As we touched it before in the title of Equality. The Cause is, for that
all Things Porous, being superficially wet, and (as it were) betweene
dry and wet, become a little more Euen and Smooth; But the Purling,
(which must needs proceed of Inequality,) I take to be bred betweene
the Smoothnesse of the in ward Surface of the Pipe, which is wet; And
the Rest of the Wood of the Pipe, vnto which the Wet commeth nor,
but it remaineth dry.
                  In Frosty weather, Mosicke within doores soundeth better. Which 
may be, by reason, not of the Disposition of the Aire, but of the Wood
or String of the Instrument; which is made more Crispe, and so more
porous and hollow: And we see that Old Lutes sound better than New,
for the same reason. And so doe Lute Strings that haue beene kept
long.
                  
                     Sound is likewise Meliorated by the Mingling of open Aire with Pent 
Aire; Therefore Triall may be made, of a Lute or Violl with a double
Belly; Making another Belly with a Knot oliet the Strings; yet so, as
there be Roome enough for the Strings, and Roome enough to play below
that Belly. Triall may be made also of an Irish Harpe, with a Concaue
on both Sides; Whereas

                     seth to haue it but on one Side. The
doubt may be, lest it should make too much Resounding; wherby one
Note would ouertake anot

                  If you sing into the Hole of a Drum, it maketh the Singing more 
                     
sweet. And so I conceiue it would, if it were a Song in Parts, sung into
seuerall Drums; And for handsomnesse and strangeness sake, it would
not be amisse to haue a Curtaine betweene the Place where the Drums
are, and the Hearers.
                  
                  
                      When a Sound is created in a Wind-Instrument, betweene the Breath
and the Aire, yet if the Sound be communicate with a more equall Body
of the Pipe, it meliorateth the Sound. For (no doubt) there would be
a differing Sound in a Trumpet, or Pipe of Wood; And againe in a Trumpet
or Pipe of Brasse. It were good to try Recorders and Hunters Hornes of
Brasse, what the Sound would be.
                  
                     
                     Sounds are meliorated by the Intension of the Sense; where the Common
Sense is collected most, to the particular Sense of Hearing, and the
Sight suspended: And therefore, Sounds are sweeter, (as well as greater,)
in the Night, than in the Day; And I suppose, they are sweeter to blinde
Men, than to Others: And it is manifest, that betweene Sleeping and Waking, (when all the Senses are bound and suspended) Musicke is farre
sweeter, than when one is fully Waking.
                  
                  It is Thing strange in Nature, when it is attentiuely considered;
How Children, and some Birds, learne to imitate Speech.
                     Experiments in Cōsort touching the Imitation of Sounds.
                      They take no
Marke (at all) of the Motion of the Mouth of Him that speaketh; For

                     Birds are as well taught in Darke, as by Light. The Sounds of Speech
are very Curious and Exquisite: So one would thinke it were a Lesson
hard to learne. It is true, that it is done with time, and by little and little,
and with many Essayes and Proffers: But all this dischargeth not
the Wonder. It would make a Man thinke (though this which we shall
say may seeme exceeding strange) that there is some Transmission of
Spirits; and that the Spirits of the Teacher put in Motion, should worke
with the Spirits of the Learner, a Pre-disposition to offer to Imitate;
And so to perfect the Imitation by degrees. But touching Operations
by Transmissions of Spirits, (which is one of the highest Secrets in
Nature,) we shall speake in due place; Chiefly when we come to enquire
of Imagination. But as for Imitation, it is certaine, that there is in Men, and other Creatures, a predisposition to Imitate We see how ready
Apes and Monkies are, to imitate all Motions of Man: And in the
Catching of Dottrells, we see, how the Foolish Bird playeth the Ape
in Gestures: And no Man (in effect) doth accompany with others, but
he learneth, (ere he is aware,) some Gesture, or Voice, or Fashion of the
other.
                  
                      In Imitation of Sounds, that Man should be the Teacher, is no Part of
the Matter; For Birds will learne one of another; And there is no Reward,
by feeding, or the like, giuen them for the Imitation; And besides,
you shall haue Parrots, that will not only Iimitate Voices, but Laughing,
Knocking, Squeaking of a Doore vpon the Hinges, or of a Cart-wheele;
And (in effect) any other Noise they heare.
                  
                      No Beast can imitate the Speech of Men, but Birds onely; For the Ape

it selfe that is so ready to imitate otherwise, attaineth not any degree of
Imitation of Speech. It is true, that I haue knowne a Dog, that if one
how led in his Eare, he would fall a how ling a great while. What should
be the Aptnesse of Birds, in comparison of Beasts, to imitate the Speech
of Man, may be further enquired. We see that Beasts haue those Parts,
which they count the Instruments of Speech, (as Lips, Teeth, &amp;c.) liker vnto
Man, than Birds. As for the Necke, by which the Throat passeth; we see
many Beasts haue it, for the Length, as much as Birds. What better Gorge, or Attire, Birds haue, may be further enquired. The Birds that are
knowne to be Speakers, are, Parrots, Pyes, layes, Dawes, and Rauens. Of
which Parrots haue an adunque Bill, but the rest not.
                  But I conceiue, that the Apinesse of Birds, is not so much in the Conformitie
                     
of the Organs of Speech, as in their Attention. For Speech must
come by Hearing, and Learning; And Birds giue more heed, and marke
Sounds, more than Beasts; Because naturally they are more delighted
with them, and practise them more; As appeareth in their Singing. We
see also, that those that teach Birds to sing, doe keepe them Waking, to
increase their Attention. We see also, that Cock-Birds, amongst SingingBirds,
are euer the better Singers; which may be, because they are more
liuely, and listen more.
                  
                     Labour, and Intention to imitate voices, doth conduce much to Imitation:
                     
And therfore we see, that there be certaine P
                        •

represent the voices of Players of Enterludes, so to life, as if you see them
not, you would thinke they were those Players themselues; and so the
Voices of other Men that they heare.
                  There haue beene some, that could counterfeit the Distance of Voices,
                     
(which is a Secondary Obiect of Hearing,) in such sort; As when they
stand fast by you, you would thinke the Speech came from a farre off, in
a fearefull manner. How this is done, may be further enquired. But I
see no great vse of it, but for Imposture, in counterseiting Ghosts or
Spirits.
                  There be three Kindes of Reflexions of Sounds, A Reflexion
Concurrent; A Reflexion Iterant, which we call Eccho; And
a Super-reflexion, or an Eccho of an Eccho, wherof the first hath
beene handled in the Title of Magnitude of Sounds: The Latter
two we will now speake of.Experiments in Consort, touching the Reflexion of Sounds.
                     
                  
                  The Reflexion of Species Visible, Mirrours, you may command; Because 
passing in Right Lines, they may be guided to any Point: But the
Reflexion of Sounds is hard to master; Because the Sound filling great
Spaces in Arched Lines, cannot be so guided: and therfore we see there
hath not beene practised, any Meanes to make Artificiall Eccho's. And
no Eccho already knowne returneth in a very narrow Roome.
                  The Naturall Eccho's are made vpon Walls, Woods, Rockes, Hills, and 
                     Banckes; As for Waters, being neare, they make a Concurrent Eccho; But

being further off, (as vpon a large Riuer) they make an Iterant Eccho: For
there is no difference betweene the Concurrent Eccho, and the Iterant, but
the Quicknesse, or Slownesse of the Returne. But there is no doubt, but
Water doth helpe the Delation of Eccho; as well as it helpeth the Delution
of Originall Sounds.
                  
                  
                      It is certaine, (as hath beene formerly touched,) that if you speake
thorow a Truncke, stopped at the further end, you shall finde a Blast returne
vpon your Mouth, but no Sound at all. The Cause is, for that the
Closenesse, which preferueth the Originall, is not able to preserue the Reflected
Sound: Besides that Eccho's are seldom created, but by loud Sounds.
And therfore there is lesse hope of Artificiall Eccho's in Aire, pent in a
narrow Concaue. Neuerthelesse it hath beene tried, that One leaning
ouer a Well, of 25. Fathome deepe, and speaking, though but softly,
(yet not so soft as a whisper,) the Water returned a good Audible Eccho.
It would be tried, whether Speaking in Caues, where there is no Issue,
faue where you speake, will not yeeld Eccho's, as Wells doe.
                  
                      The Eccho commeth as the Originall Sound doth, in a Round Orbe of
Aire: It were good to try the Creating of the Eccho, where the Body
Repercussing maketh an Angle: As against the Returne of a Wall,
&amp;c. Also we see that in Mirrours, there is the like Angle of Incidence,
from the Obiect to the Glasse, and from the Glasse to the Eye. And if
you strike a Ball side-long, nor full vpon the Surface, the Rebound will
be as much the contrary way; Whether there be any such Re
                           •
                        ilience in
Eccho's, (that is, whether a Man shall heare better, if he stand aside the
Body Repercussing, than if he stand where he speaketh, or any where in
a right Line betweene;) may be tried. Triall likewise would be made,
by Standing nearer the Place of Repercussing, than he that speaketh;
And againe by Standing further off, than hee that speaketh; And so
Knowledge would be taken, whether Eccho's, as well as Originall Sounds,
be not strongest neare hand.
                  
                      There be many Places, where you shall heare a Number of Eccho's,
one after another: And it is, when there is Variety of Hills, or Woods,
some nearer, some further off: So that the Returne from the further, being
last created, will be likewise last heard.
                  
                      As the Voice goeth round, as well towards the Backe, as towards the
Front of him that speaketh; So likewise doth the Eccho; For you haue
many Back-Eccho's to the Place where you stand.
                  
                      To make an Eccho, that will report, three, or foure, or fiue Words,
distinctly, it is requisite, that the Body Repercussing, be a good distance
off: For if it be neare, and yet not so neare, as to make a Concurrent Eccho,
it choppeth with you vpon the sudden. It is requisite likewise, that
the Aire be not much pent. For Aire, at a great distance, pent, worketh
the same effect with Aire, at large, in a small distance. And therefore in
the Triall of Speaking in the Well, though the Well was deepe, the Voice
came backe, suddenly; And would beare the Report but of two
Words.
                  
                     For Eccho's vpon Eccho's, there is a rare Instance thereof in a Place,
which I will now exactly describe. It is some three or foure Miles from
Paris, neere a Towne called Pont-charenton; And some Bird-bolt shot,
or more, from the Riuer of Seane. The Roome is a Chappell, or small
Church. The Walls all standing, both at the Sides, and at the Ends. Two
Rowes of Pillars, after the manner of Isles of Churches, also standing;
The Roofe all open, not so much as any Embowment neere any of the
walls left. There was against euery Pillar, a Stacke of Billets, aboue a
Mans Height; which the Watermen, that bring Wood downe the
Seane, in Stacks, and not in Boats, laid there (as it seemeth) for their
ease. Speaking at the one End, I did heare it returne the Voice thirteene
seuerall times; And I haue heard of others, that it would returne sixteene
times: For I was there about three of the Clocke in the Afternoone:
And it is best, (as all other Eccho's are) in the Euening. It is manifest,
that it is not Eccho's from seuerall places, but a Tossing of the Voice,
as a Ball, to and fro; Like to Reflexions in Looking-glasses; where if you
place one Glasse before, and another behinde, you shall see the Glasse behinde
with the Image, within the Glasse before; And againe, the Glasse
before in that; and diuers such Super-Reflexions, till the species speciei at
last die. For it is euery Returne weaker, and more shady. In like manner,
the Voice in that Chappell, createth speciem, speciei, and maketh succeeding
Super-Reflexions; For it melteth by degrees, and euery Reflexion is weaker
than the former: So that, if you speake three Words, it will (perhaps)
some three times report you the whole three Words; And then
the two latter Words for some times; And then the last Word alone for
some times; Still fading, and growing weaker. And whereas in Eccho's
of one Returne, it is much to heare foure or fiue Words; In this Eccho
of so many Returnes, vpon the matter, you heare aboue twenty Words,
for three.
                  The like Eccho vpon Eccho, but only with two Reports, hath beene 
obserued to be, if you stand betweene a House, and a Hill, and lure towards
the Hill. For the House will giue a Backe-Eccho; One taking it
from the other, and the latter the weaker.
                  There are certaine Letters, that an Eccho will hardly expresse; As S,
                     
for one; Especially being Principiall in a Word. I remember well, that
when I went to the Eccho at Pont-Charenton, there was an Old Parisian,
that tooke it to be the Worke of Spirits, and of good Spirits. For, (said
he) call Saten, and the Eccho will not deliuer backe the Deuils name; But
will say, Va
                           •
                        'on; Which is as much in French, as Apage, or A
                           •
                        oid. And
thereby I did hap to finde, that an Eccho would not returne S, being but
a Hissing and an Interiour Sound.
                  
                  
                     Eccho's are some more sudden, and chop againe, as soone as the Voice
                     
is deliuered; As hath beene partly said: Others are more deliberate, that
is, giue more Space betweene the Voice, and the Eccho; which is caused by
the locall Nearenesse, or Distance: Some will report a longer Traine of
Words; And some a shorter: Some more loud (full as loud as the Originall,
                     
and sometimes more loud;) And some weaker and fainter.
                  
                      Where Eccho's come from seuerall Parts, at the same distance, they
must needs make (as it were) a Quire of Eccho's, and so make the Report
greater, and euen a Continued Eccho; which you shall finde in some Hills,
that stand encompassed, Theater-like.
                  
                      It doth not yet appeare, that there is Refraction in Sounds, as well as in
Species Visible. For I doe not thinke, that if a Sound should passe through
diuers Mediums, (as Aire, Cloth, Wood) it would deliuer the Sound, in a
differing Place, from that vnto which it is deferred; which is the Proper
Effect of Refraction. But Maioration, which is also the Worke of Refraction,
appeareth plainly in Sounds, (as hath beene handled at full;) But
it is not by Diuersitie of Mediums.
                  
                  We haue obitèr, for Demonstrations sake, vsed in diuers
Instances, the Examples of the Sight, and Things Visible, to illustrate
the Nature of Sounds.
                     Experiments in Cōsort touching the Consent and Dissint between Visibles &amp; Audibles,
                      But wee thinke good now to
prosecute that Comparison more fully.
                  
                     CONSENT OF VISIBLES,
and Audibles.
                     
                        
                        BOth of them spread themselues in Round, and fill a whole Floare or
Orbe, vnto certaine Limits: And are carried a great way: And
doe languish and lessen by degrees, according to the Distance of
the Obiects from the Sensories.
                     
                        
                        Both of them haue the whole Species in euery small Portion of the Aire,
or Medium; So as the Species doe passe through small Crannies, without
Confusion: As we see ordinarily in Leuels, as to the Eye; And in Crannies,
or Chinks, as to the Sound.
                     
                     
                        
                        Both of them are of a sudden and easie Generation and Delation; And
likewise perish swiftly, and suddenly; As if you remoue the Light; Or
touch the Bodies that giue the Sound.
                     
                     
                        
                        Both of them doe receiue and carry exquisite and accurate Differences;
As of Colours, Figures, Motions, Distances, in Visibles; And of Articulate
Voices, Tones, Songs, and Quauerings, in Audibles.
                     
                     
                        
                        Both of them in their Vertue and Working, doe not appeare to emit any
Corporall Substance into their Mediums, or the Orbe of their Vertue;
Neither againe to raise or stirre any euident locall Motion in their Mediums,
as they passe; But only to carrry certaine Spirituall Species; The Perfect
Knowledge of the Cause whereof, being hitherto scarcely attained, wee
shall search and handle in due place.
                     
                        
                        Both of them seeme not to generate or produce any other Effect in Nature,
                        
but such as appertaineth to their proper Obiects, and Senses, and
are otherwise Barren.
                     But Both of them in their owne proper Action, doe worke three manifest 
                        Effects. The First, in that the Stronger Species drawneth the E
                              •
                           sser;
As the Light of the Sunne, the light of a Glow-worme; The Report of
an Ordnance, the Voice; The Second, in that an Obiect of Surcharge or
Excesse destroyeth the Sense; As the Light of the Sunne the Eye, a violent
Sound (neare the Eare) the Hearing: The Third, in that both of them
will be reuerberate; As in Mirrours; And in Eccho's.
                     
                     
                        Neither of them doth destroy or hinder the Species of the other, although 
they encounter in the same Medium; As Light or Colour hinder not
Sound; Nor 
                           
                              •
                           contr

                           .
                     
                     
                        Both of them affect the Sense in Liuing Creatures, and yeeld Obiects of 
Pleasure and Dislike: Yet neuerthelesse, the Obiects of them doe also (if
it be well obserued) affect and worke vpon dead Things; Namely, such
as haue some Conformity with the Organs of the two Senses; As Visibles
worke vpon a Looking-glasse, which is like the Pupill of the Eye; And
Audibles vpon the Places of Eccho, which resemble, in some sort, the Cauerne
and structure of the Eare.
                     
                        Both of them doe diuersly worke, as they haue their Medium diuersly disposed.
                        
So a Trembling Medium (as Smoake) maketh the Obiect seeme
to tremble; and a Rising or Falling Medium (as Winds) maketh the
Sounds to rise, or fall.
                     To Both, the Medium, which it the most Prop

                           •
                         and Conducible,
is Aire; For Glasse or Water, &amp;c. are not comparable.
                     In Both of them, where the Obiect is Fine and Accurate, it conduceth 
much to haue the Sense Intentiue, and Erect; In so much as you contract
your Eye, when you would see sharply; And erect your Eare, when
you would heare attentiuely; which in Beasts that haue Eares moueable,
is most manifest.
                     The Beames of Light, when they are multiplyed, and conglomerate, generate 
                        Heat; which is a different Action, from the Action of Sight: And
the Multiplication and Conglomeration of Sounds doth generate an extreme
Rarefaction of the Aire; which is an Action materiate, differing
from the Action of Sound; If it be true (which is anciently reported)
that Birds, with great shouts, haue fallen downe.
                  
                  
                     
                     DISSENTS OF VISIBLES,
and Audibles.
                     
                         THe Species of Visibles soeme to be Emissions of Beames from the
Obiect seene; Almost like Odours; saue that they are more Incorporecall:
But the Species of Audibles seeme to Participate
more with Locall Motion, like Percussions or Impressions made vpon the
Aire. So that whereas all Bodies doe seeme to worke in two manners;
Either by the Communication of their Natures; Or by the Impressions and
Signatures of their Motions; The Diffusion of Species Visible seemeth to
participate more of the former Operation; and the Species Audible of the
latter.
                     
                         The Species of Audibles seeme to be carried more manifestly thorow
the Aire, than the Species of Visibles: For (I conceiue) that a Contrary
strong Wind will not much hinder the Sight of Visibles, as it will doe
the Hearing of Sounds.
                     
                     
                         There is one Difference, aboue all others, betweene Visibles and Audibles,
that is the most remarkable; As that wherupon many smaller
Differences doe depend: Namely, that Visibles, (except Lights,) are
carried in Right Lines; and Audibles in Ar
                              •••
                            Lines. Heriee it commeth
to passe, that Visibles doe not intermingle; and confound one another,
as hath beene said before; But Sounds doe. Hence it commeth, that the
Solidity of Bodies doth not much hinder the Sight, so that the Bodies
be cleare. and the Pores in a Right Line as in Glasse, Crystall, Diamonds,
Water, &amp;c. But a thin Scarse, or Handkerchiefe, though they
be Bodies nothing so solide, hinder the Sight: Whereas (contrariwise)
these Porous Bodies doe not much hinder the Hearing, but solide Bodies
doe almost stop it, or at the least attenuate it. Hence also it commeth,
that to the Reflexion of Visibles, small Glasses suffice; but to the
Reuerberation of Audibles, are required greater Spaces, as hath likewise
beene said before.
                     
                        
                        Visibles are seene further off, than Sounds are heard; Allowing neuerthelesse
the Rate of their Bignesse; For otherwise a great Sound will be
heard further off, than a Small Body seene.
                     
                        
                        Visibles require (generally) some Distance betweene the Obiect, and
the Eye, to bee better seene; Whereas in Audibles, the nearer the Approch
of the Sound is to the Sense, the better. But in this there may be
a double Errour. The one, because to Seeing, there is required Light;
And any thing that toucheth the Pupill of the Eye (all ouer,) excludeth
the Light. For I haue heard of a Person very credible, (who himselfe was
cured of a Cataract in one of his Eyes,) that while the Siluer Needle
did worke vpon the Sight of his Eye, to remoue the Filme of the Cataract,

he neuer saw any thing more cleare or perfect, than that white
Needle: Which (no doubt,) was, because the Needle was lesser than
the Pupill of the Eye; and so Cooke not the Light from it. The other Errour
may be, for that the Obiect of Sight doth strike vpon the Pupill of
the Eye, directly without any interception; wheras the Caue of the Eare
doth hold off the Sound a little from the Organ: And so neuerthelesse
there is some Distance required in both.
                     
                        Visibles are s

                         Motion

heretofore, but are proper for this Title.
                     
                     I conceiue also, that the Species of Audibles doe hang longer in the 
Aire, than those of Visibles: For although euen those of Visibles, doe
hang some time, as we see in Rings turned, that shew like Spheres; In
Lute-strings fillipped, A Fire-brand caried along, which leaueth a Traine
of Light behinde it; and in the Twilight; And the like: Yet I conceiue
that Sounds stay longer, because they are carried vp and downe with
the Winde: And because of the Distance of the Time, in Ordnance a discharged,
and heard twenty Miles off.
                     In Visibles, there are not sound Obiects so odious and in grate to the 
                        Sense, as in Audibles. For foule Sights doe rather displease, in that they

                         those foule Sights doe not much offend; But
in Audibles, the Grating of a Saw, when it is sharpned, doth offend so
much, as it Fen

                     In Visibles, after great Light, if you come suddenly into the Darke;
                        
Or contrariwise, out of the Darke into a Glaring light, the Eye is dazled
for a time; and the Sight confused; not whether any such Effect be after
great Sounds, or after a deepe Silence, may be better enquired. It is an

we should see Colours out of a Right line. But as this is in Colours, so otherwise
it is in the Body of Light. For when there is a Skreene between
the Candle and the Eye, yet the Light passeth to the Paper wheron One
writeth; So that the Light is seene, where the Body of the Flame is not
seene; And where any Colour (if it were placed where the Body of the
Blame is) would not be seene. I iudge that Sound is of this Latter Nature:

For when two are placed on both sides of a Wall, and the Voice
is heard, I iudge it is not onely the Originall Sound, which passeth in an
Arebed Line; But the Sound, which passeth aboue the Wall in a Right
Line, begetteth the like Motion round about it, as the first did, though
more weake.
                     All Concords and Discords of Musicke, are, (no doubt,) Sympathies,
and Antipathies of Sounds.
                        Experiments in Consort, touching the Sympathy or Antipathy of sounds, one with another. And so (likewise) in that Musicke, which we
call Broken Musicke, or Consort Musicke; Some Consorts of Instruments are
sweeter than others; (A Thing not suffciently yet obserued:) As the
Irish Harpe, and Base Viall agree well: The Recorder and Stringed Musick
                         agree well: Organs and the Voice agree well; &amp;c. But the Virginalls and
the Lute; Or the Welch-Harpe, and, Irish-Harpe; Or the Voice and Pipes
alone, agree not so well; But for the Melieration of Musicke, there is yet
much lest (in this Point of Exquisite Consorts) to try and ehquire.
                     
                         There is a Common Obseruation, that if a Lute, or Viall, be layed
vpon the Backe, with a small Straw vpon one of the Strings; And another
Lute or Viall be laid by it; And in the other Lute or Viall, the Vnison
to that String be strucken; it will make the String, moue; Which will
appeare both to the Eye, and by the Strawes Falling off. The like will
be, if the Diapason or Eight to that String be strucken, either in the same
Lute, or Viall, or in others lying by; But in one of these there is any Report of Sound, that can be discerned, but onely Motion.
                     
                         It was deuised, that a Viall should haue a Lay of Wire Strings below,
as close to the Belly, as a Lute; And then the Strings of Guts mounted
vpon a Bridge, as in Ordinary Vialls; To the end, that by this means,
the vpper Strings strucken, should make the lower resound by Sympathy,
and so make the Musicke the better; Which, if it be to purpose, then
Sympathy worketh, as well by Report of Sound, as by Motion. But this
deuice I conceiue to be of no vse; because the vpper Strings, which are
stopped in great variety, cannot maintaine a Diapason or Vnison, with the
Lower, which are neuer stopped, But if it should be of vse at all; it must
be in Instruments which haue no Stops; as Virginalls, and Harpes; wherin
triall may be made of two Rowes of Strings, distant the one from the
other.
                     
                         The Experiment of Sympathy may be transferred (perhaps) from Instruments
of Strings, to other Instruments of Sound. As to try if there
were in one Steeple, two Bells of Vnison, whether the striking of the one
would moue the other, more than if it were another Accord: And so
in pipes, (if they be of equall Bore, and Sound,) whether a little Straw
or Feather would moue in the one Pipe, when the other is blowne at an
Vnison.
                     
                     
                         It seemeth, both in Eare, and Eye, the Instrument of Sense hath a
Sympathy or Similitude with that which giueth the Reflexion; (As hath
beene touched befor.) For as the Sight of the Eye is like a Crystall, or
Glasse, or Water; So is the Eare a sinuous Caue, with a hard Bone, to

stop and reuerberate the Sound; Which is like to the Places that report
Eccho's.
                     
                     When a Man Yawneth, he cannot Heare so well.Experiments in Consort, touching the Hindring or Helping of the Hearing.
                         The Cause is, for
that the Membrane of the Eare is extended; And so rather casteth off
the Sound, than draweth it to.
                     We Heare better when we hold our Breath, than contrary; In so
much as in all Listening to attaine a Sound a farre off, Men hold their Breath.
The Cause is, For that in all Expiration, the Motion is Outwards; 
And therefore, rather driueth away the voice, than draweth it: And 
besides we see, that in all Labour to doe things with any strength, we
hold the Breath: And listening after any Sound, that is heard with difficulty,
is a kinde of Labour.
                     
                     Let it be tryed, for the Helpe of the Hearing, (and I conceiue it likely 
to succeed,) to make an Instrument like a Tunnell; The narrow Part
whereof may be of the Bignesse of the Hole of the Eare; And the Broader
End much larger, like a Bell at the Skirts; And the length halfe a
foot, or more. And let the narrow End of it be set close to the Eare:
And marke whether any Sound, abroad in the open Aire, will not be
heard distinctly, from further distance; than without that Instrument;
being (as it were) an Eare-Spectacle. And I haue heard there is in Spaine,
an Instrument in vse to be set to the Eare, that helpeth somewhat those
that are Thicke of Hearing.
                     If the Mouth be shut close, neuerthelesse there is yeelded by the 
Roofe of the Mouth, a Murmur, Such as is vsed by dumbe Men: But if
the Nostrills be likewise stopped, on such Murmur can be made; Except
it be in the Bottome of the Pallate towards the Throat. Whereby it appeareth
manifestly, that a Sound in the Mouth, except such as aforesaid,
if the Mouth be stopped, passeth from the Pallate, thorow the Nostrills.
                     
                     The Repercussion of Sounds, (which we call Eccho,) is a great Argument
of the Spirituall Essence of Sounds.

                         For if it were Corporeall,) the Repercussion
should be created in the same maner, and by like Instruments,
with the Originall Sound
                              •
                           . But we see what a Number of Exquisite Instruments
must concurre in Speaking of Words, where of there is no such
Matter in the Returning of them; But onely a plaine Stop, and Repercussion.
                        
                     
                     The Exquisite Differences of Articulate Sounds, carried along in the 
                        Aire, shew that they cannot be Signalures or Impressions in the Aire, as
hath beene well refuted by the Ancients. For it is true, that Seales make
excellent Impressions: And so it may be thought of Sounds in their first
Generation: But then the Delation and Continuance of them without any
new Sealing, shew apparently they cannot be Impressions.
                     All Sounds are suddenly made, and doe suddenly perish; But neither 
that, nor the Exquisite Differences of them, is Matter of so great
Admiration: For the

                        gs, and Warblings to Lutes, and Pipes,

are as swift; And the Tongue, (which is no very fine Instrument,) doth
in Speech, make no fewer Motions, than there be Letters in all the
Words, which are vttered. But that Sounds should not onely be so
speedily generated, but carried so farre euery way, in such a momentany
time, deserueth more Admiration. As for Example; If a Man stand
in the middle of a Field, and speake aloud, he shall be heard a Furlong
in round; And that shall be in Articulate Sounds; And those shall be
Entire in euery little Portion of the Aire; And this shall be done in the
Space of lesse than a Minute.
                     
                         The Sudden Generation and Perishing of Sounds, must be one of these
two Waies. Either that the Aire suffereth some Force by Sound, and
then restoreth it selfe; As Water doth; Which being diuided, maketh
manny Circles, till it restore it selfe to the naturall Consistence: Or otherwise,
that the Aire doth willingly imbibe the Sound as gratefull, but
cannot maintaine it; For that the Aire hath (as it should seeme) a secret
and hidden Appetite of Receiuing the Sound at the first; But then other
Grosse and more Materiate Qualities of the Aire straightwaies
suffocate it; Like vnto Flame, which is generated with Alacrity, but
straight quenched by the Enmity of the Aire, or other Ambient Bodies.
                     
                        There be these Differences (in generall) by which Sounds
are diuided; 1. Musicall, Immusicall; 2. Treble, Base; 3. Flat,
Sharpe; 4. Soft, Loud; 5. Exteriour, Interiour, 6. Cleane, Harsb or Purling; 7. Articulate, Inarticulate.
                     We haue laboured (as may appeare,) in this Inquisition of
Sounds, diligently; Both because Sound is one of the most Hidden
Portions of Nature, (as we said in the beginning:) And
because it is a Vertue which may be called Incorporeall, and
Immateriate; wherof there be in Nature but few. Besides, we
were willing, (now in these our first Centuries,) to make a Patterne
or President of an Exact Inquisition; And we shall doe
the like hereafter in some other Subiects which require it. For
we desire that Men should learne and perceiue, how seuere a
Thing the true Inquisition of Nature is; And should accustome
themselues, by the light of Particulars, to enlarge their
Mindes, to the Amplitude of the World; And not reduce the
World to the Narrownesse of their Mindes.
                     
                        Metalls giue Orlens and Fine Colours in Dissolutions; As Gold giueth

an excellent Yellow; Quick-Siluer an excellent Greene; Tinne giueth
an excellent Azure: Likewise in their Putrefactions, or Rusts; As
Vermilion, Verdegrease, Bise, Cirrus, &amp;c.Experiment Solitary touching the Orient Colours, in dissolution of Metalls.
                         And likewise in their vitrifications. The Cause is, for that by their Strength of Body, they are able 
to endure the Fire, or Strong Waters, and to be put into an Equall
Posture; And againe to retaine Part of their principall Spirit; Which
two Things, (Equall Posture, and Quicke Spirits) are required chiefely,
to make Colours lightsome.
                     It conduceth vnto Long Life, and to the more Placide Motion of
the Spirits, which thereby doe lesse prey and consume the Iuyce of
the Body; Either that Mens Actions bee free and voluntary; That nothing
bee done Inuitâ Mineruâ, but Secundum Genium: Or on the 
other side, that the Actions of Men bee full of Regulation, and Commands
within themselues: For then the Victory and Performing of
the Command, giueth a good Disposition to the Spirits; Especially
if there bee a Proceeding from Degree to Degree; For then
the Sense of Victory is the greater.Experiment Solitary touching Prolongation of Life. An example of the former of these,
is in a Countrey life; And of the latter, in Monkes and Philosophers, and
such as doe continually enioyne themselues.
                     It is certaine, that in all Bodies, there is an Appetite of Vnion,
and Euitation of Solution of Continuity: And of this Appetite
there bee many Degrees; But the most Remarkable, and fit to bee
distinguished, are three.Experiment Solitary touching Appetite of Vnion in Bodies.
                         The first in Liquours; The second in Hard
Bodies: And the third in Bodies Cleaning or Tenacious. In Liquours,
                        
this Appetite is weake: We see in Liquours, the Thredding of them
in Stillicides, (as hath beene said;) The Falling of them in Round
Drops, (which is the forme of Vnion;) And the Staying of them,
for a little time, in Bubbles and Froth. In the second Degree or
Kinde, this Appetite is strong; As in Iron, in Stone, in Wood, &amp;c. In
the third, this Appetite is in a Medium betweene the other two: For
such Bodies doe partly follow the Touch of another Body; And
partly sticke and continue to themselues; And therefore they roape,
and draw themselues in Threds; As wee see in Pitch, Glew, Birdlime,
&amp;c. But note, that all Solide Bodies are Cleaning, more or lesse:
And that they loue better the Touch of somewhat that is Tangible,
than of Aire, For Water, in small quantity, cleaueth to any Thing
that is Solide; And so would Metall too, if the weight drew it not off.
And therefore Gold Foliate, or any Metall Foliate, cleaueth: But those
Bodies which are noted to bee Clammy, and Cleauing, are such, as
haue a more indifferent Appetite (at once,) to follow another Body;
And to hold to Themselues. And therefore they are commonly
Bodies ill mixed; And which take more pleasure in a Forraine

Body, than in preseruing their owne Consistence; And which haue little
predominance in Drought, or Moisture.

                              ons of Heat and Time.
                         
                        Heat drieth Bodies,
that doe easily expire; As Parchment, Leaues, Roots, Clay,
&amp;c. And, so doth Time or Age arefie; As in the same Bodies, &amp;c.
Heat dissolueth and melteth Bodies, that keepe in their Spirits; As
 in diuers Liquefactions; And so doth Time, in some Bodies of a softer
Consistence: As a manifest in Honey, which by Age waxeth more
liquid: And the like in Sugar; And so in old Oyle, which is euer
more cleare, and more hot in Medicinable vse. Heat causeth the
Spirits to search some Issue out of the Body; As in the Volatility of
Metalls; And so doth Time; As in the Rust of Metalls. But generally Heat
doththat in small time, which Age doth in long.
                     Some Things which passe the Fire are softest at first, and by
Time grow hard; As the Crumme of Bread.Experiment Solitary touching the differing Operations of Fire, and Time.
                         Some are harder
when they come from the Fire, and afterwards giue againe, and
grow soft, as the Crust of Bread, Bisket, Sweet Meats, Salt, &amp;c.
The Cause is, for that in those things which waxe Hard with Time, the
 Worke of the Fire is a Kinde of Melting: And in those that waxe
Soft with Time, (contrariwise,) the woke of the Fire is a Kinde
of Baking; And whatsoeuer the Fire baketh, Time doth in some degree
dissolue.
                     
                        Motions passe from one Man to another, not so much by Exciting
Imagination; as by Inuitation; Especially if there be an Aptnesse or
Inclination before.Experiment Solitary touching Motions by Inuitation. Therefore Gaping, or Yawning, and Stretching
                         doe passe from Man to Man; For that that causeth Gaping and Stretching
is, when the Spirits are a little Heauy, by any Vapour, or the
like. For then they striue, (as it were,) to wring out, and expell that
which loadeth them. So Men drowzy, and desirous to sleepe; Or before
the Fit of an Ague; doe vse to Yawne and Stretch; And doe
likewise yeeld a Voice or Sound, which is an Interiection of Expulsion:
So that if another be apt and prepared to doe the like, he followeth by
the Sight of another. So the Laughing of another maketh to Laugh.
                     
                     There be some knowne Diseases that are Infectious; And Others
that are not.Experiment Solitary, touching Infectious Disease.
                         Those that are Infectious, are; First, such as are chiefly
in the Spirits, and not so much in the Humours; And therefore passe
 easily from Body to Body: Such are Pestilences, Lippitudes; and such
like. Secondly, such as Taint the Breath; Which wee see passeth manifestly
from Man to Man; And not inuisibly, as the Affects of the
Spirits doe: Such are Consumptions of the Lungs, &amp;c. Thirdly such
as come forth to the Skinne; And therefore taint the Aire, or the Body
                        
                        Adiacent; Especially if they consist in an Vnctuous Substance, no
apt to dissipate; Such are Scabs, and Lepronsie. Fourthly, such as are
meerely in the Humours, and not in the Spirits, Breath, or Exhalations:
And therefore they neuer infect, but by Touch onely; and such a Touch
also, as commeth within the Epidermis; As the Venome of the French
Poxe, And the Biting of a Mad Dog.
                     
                     Most Powders grow, more Close and Coherent by Mixture of Water,
than by Mixture of Oyle, though Oyle be the thicker Body; As
Meale; &amp;c.Experiment Solitary touching the incorporation of Powders and Liquours
                         The Reason is the Congruity of Bodies; which if it be
more, maketh a Perfecter Imbibition, and Incorporation; Which in
most Powders is more betweene Them and Water, than betweene Them
                        
and Oyle: But Printers Colours ground, and Ashes, doe better incorporate
with Oyle.
                     
                     Much Motion and Exercise is good for some Bodies; And Sitting,
and lesse Motion for Others.Experiment Solitary, touching Exercise of the Body.
                         If the Body be Hot, and Void of Superflous
Moistures, too much Motion hurteth: And it is an Errour in Physitians, to
call too much vpon Exercise. Likewise Men ought to beware, that they 
vse not Exercise, and a Spare Diet both: But if much Exercise, then a Plentifull
Diet, And if Sp

of Exercise are, First, that it sendeth Nourishment into the Parts more
forcibly. Secondly, that it helpeth to Exceme by Sweat, and so maketh
the Parts assimilate the more perfectly. Thirdly, that it maketh the Substance
of the Body more Solide and Compact; And so lesse apt to be Consumed
and Depredated by the Spirits. The Euills that come of Exercise,
are: First, that it maketh the Spirits more Hot and Predatory. Secondly,
that it doth absorbe likewise, and attenuate too much the Moisture
of the Body. Thirdly, that it maketh too great

if it be violent,) of the Inward Parts; which delight more in Rest.
But generally Exercise, if it be much, is no Friend to Prolongation of
Life; Which is one Cause, why Women liue longer than Men, because
they stirre lesse.

                         Some other, (though pleasant,)
Glutteth sooner; As Sweet Meats, Fat Meats, &amp;c. The Cause is, for
that Appetite consisteth in the Emptinesse of Mouth of the Stomacke; 
Or possessing it with somewhat that is Astringent; and therfore
Cold and Dry. But things that are Sweet and Fat, are more Filling:
And do swimme and hang more about the Mouth of the Stomacke;
And goe not downe so speedily: And againe turne sooner
to Choler, which is hot, and euer abateth the Appetite. Wee see also,
that another Cause of Society, is an Ouer-custome; and of Appetite is Nouelty:
And therefore Meats, if the same be continually taken, induce
Loathing. To giue the Reason of the Distast of Society, and of the Pleasure
                        
in Nouelty; and to distinguish not onely in Meats and Drinkes,
but also in Motions, Loues, Company, Delights, Studies, what they
be that Custome maketh more gratefull; And what more tedious;
were a large Field. But for Meats, the Cause is Attraction,
which is quicker, and more excited towards that which is
new, than towards that whereof there remaineth a Rellish
by former vse. And (generally) it is a Rule, that
whatsoeuer is somewhat Ingrate at first, is made
Gratefull by Custome; But whatsoeuer
is too Pleasing at first, groweth
quickly to satiate.

                         Parts; For that

The third, by the Resining the Spirit it selfe, which therby giueth
to the Liquour more Splendour, and more Lustre.
                  
                      First, for Separation; It is wrought by Weight; As in the ordinary
Residence or Settlement of Liquours: By Heat: By Motion: By Precipitation,
or Sublimation; (That is, a Calling of the seuerall Parts, either vp,
or downe, which is a kinde of Attraction:) By Adhesion; As when a Body
more Viscous is mingled and agitated with the Liquour: which Viscous
Body (afterwards seuered) draweth with it the grosser Parts of
the Liquour; And Lastly, By Percolation or Passage.
                  
                  
                      Secondly, for the Euen Distribution of the Spirits; It is wrought By
Gentle Heat; And By Agitation or Motion; (For of Time we speake not,
because it is that, we would anticipate &amp; represent:) And it is wrought
also, By Mixture of some other Body, which hath a vertue to open the
Liquour, and to make the Spirits the better passe thorow.
                  
                      Thirdly, for the Refining of the Spirit, it is wrought likewise By Heat;
By Motion; And by Mixture of some Body which hath Vertue to attenuate.
So therefore (hauing shewen the Causes) for the Accelerating of Clarification,
in generall, and the Enducing of it; take these Instances, and
Trialls.
                  
                  
                      It is in common Practise, to draw Wine, or Beere, from the Lees,
(which we call Racking;) wherby it will Clarifie much the sooner: For
the Lees, though they keepe the Drinke in Heart, and make it lasting; yet
withall they cast vp some Spissitude: And this Instance is to be referred
to Separation.
                  
                  
                      On the other side, it were good to try, what the Adding to the Liquour more Lees than his owne will worke; For thought the Lees doe
make the Liquour turbide, yet they refine the Spirits. Take therfore a
Vessell of New Beere; And take another Vessell of New Beere, and Rack
the one Vessell from the Lees, and powre the Lees of the Racked Vessell
into the vnracked Vessell, and see the Effect: This Instance is referred to
the Refining of the Spirits.
                  
                  
                      Take New Beere, and put in some Quantitie of Stale Beere into it,
and see whether it will not accelerate the Clarification, by Opening the
Body of the Beere, and Cutting the Grosser Parts, wherby they may fall
downe into Lees. And this Instance againe is referred to Separation.
                  
                  
                      The longer Malt, or Herbs, or the like, are Infused in Liquour, the
more thicke and troubled the Liquour is; But the longer they be decocted
in the Liquour, the clearer it is. The Reason is plaine, because in infusion,
the longer it is, the greater is the Part of the Grosse Body, that
goeth into the Liquour: But in Decoction, though more goeth forth,
yet it either purgeth at the Top, or fettleth at the Bottome. And therfore
the most Exact Way to Clarifie is; First to Infuse, and then to take
off the Liquour, and Decoct it; as they doe in Beere, which hath Malt first
Infused in the Liquour, and is afterwards boiled with the Hop. This also
is referred to Separation.
                  
                  
                      Take Hot Embers, and put them about a Bottle filled with New Beere,
                     
almost to the very Neck: Let the Bottle be well stopped, lest it flie out:
And continue it, renewing the Embers euery day, by the space of Ten
Dayes; and then compare it with another Bottle of the same Beere set-by.
Take also Lime both Quenched, and Vnquenched, and set the Bottles in
them, vt Supra. This Instance is referred, both to the Euen Distribution,
and also to the Refining of the Spirits by Heat.
                  
                  Take Bottles, and Swing them; Or Carry them in a Wheels-Barrow, vpon 
                     Rough Ground; twice in a day: But then you may not fill the Bottles
full, but leaue some Aire; For if the Liquour come close to the Stopple,
it cannot play, nor flower: And when you haue shaken them well, either
way, poure the Drinke into another Bottle, stopped close, after the vsuall
manner; For if it stay with much Aire in it, the Drinke will pall; neither
will it settle so perfectly in all the Parts. Let it stand sorce 24. houres:
Then take it, and put it againe into a Bottle with Aire, vt supra: And
thence into a Bottle Stopped, vt supra: And so repeat the same Operation
for seuen dayes. Note that in the Emptying of one Bottle into another,
you must doe it swiftly, lest the Drinke pall. It were good also, to trie it
in a Bottle with a little Aire below the Neck, without Emptying. This
Instance is referred to the Euen Distribution and Refining of the Spirits by
Motion.
                  
                  As for Percolation, Inward, and Outward, (which belongeth to Separation,)
Triall would be made, of Clarifying by Adhesion, with Milks put
into New Beere, and stirred with it: For it may be that the Grossar Part
of the Beere will cleave to the Milke: The Doubt is, whether the Milke
will feuer 
                        •
                      ell againe; Which is soone tried. And it is vsuall in Clarifying
Ippoerasse to put in Milke; Which after seuereth and carrieth with it the
Grosser Parts of the Ippoerasse, as hath beene said elsewhere. Also for the
better Clarification by Persolation, when they run New Beere, they vse to
let it passe through a Strainer; And it is like the finer the Strainer is, the
clearer it will be.
                  The Accelerating of Maturation Wee will now enquire of.Experiments in Consort touching Maturation, and the Accelerating thereof. And 
                           •••
                        ft touching the Maturation and Quickning or Drinks. And next touching the Maturation of Fruits.
                     
And of Maturation it selfe.
It is of three Natures. The Maturation
of Fruits. The Maturation of Drinkes: And the Maturation
of Impostumes, and Vlcers. This last we referre to another
Place, where wee shall handle Experiments Medicinall.
There be also other Maturations, as of Metalls, &amp;c. whereof
we will speake as Occasion serueth. But we will begin with
that of Drinkes, because it hath such a Affinitie with the Clarification
of Liquours.
                  
                  For the Maturation of Drinkes, it is wrought by the congregation of the 
                     Spirits together, whereby they digest more perfectly the Grosser Parts:
And it is effected partly, by the same meanes, that Clarification is, (wherof wee spake before;) But then more, that an Extreme Clarification doth

spread the Spirits so Smooth, as they become Dull, and the Drinke dead,
which ought to haue a little Flouring. And therefore all your Cleare
Amber Drinke is flat.
                  
                      We see the Degrees of Maturation of Drinkes; In Must; In Wine, as it
is drunke; And in Vinegar. Whereof Must hath not the Spirits well Congregated;
Wine hath them well vnited; so as they make the Parts somewhat
more Oylie: Vinegar hath them Congregated, but more Ieiune, and
in smaller Quantitie; The greatest and finest Spirit and Part being exhaled:
For we see Vinegar is made by setting the Vessell of Wine against the
hot Sun: And therefore Vinegar will not burne; For that much of the Finer
Parts is Exhaled.
                  
                      The Refreshing and Quickning of Drinke Palled, or Dead, is by Enforcing
the Motion of the Spirit: So wee see that Open Weather relaxeth the
Spirit, and maketh it more liuely in Motion. Wee see also Bottelling of
Beere, or Ale, while it is New, and full of Spirit, (so that it spirteth when
the Stopple is taken forth) maketh the Drinke more quicke and windie.
A Pan of Coales in the Cellar doth likewise good, and maketh the Drinke
worke againe. New Drinke, put to Drinke that is Dead, prouoketh it to
worke againe; Nay, which is more, (as some affirme,) A Brewing of New Beere,
set by Old Beere, maketh it worke againe. It were good also to
Enforce the Spirits by some Mixtures, that may excite and quicken them;
As by Putting into the Bottles, Nitre, Chalke, Lime, &amp;c. We see Creame
is Matured, and made to rise more speedily, by Putting in Cold Water;
which, as it seemeth, getteth downe the Whey.
                  
                  
                      It is tried, that the Burying of Bottles of Drinke well stopped, either in
drie Earth, a good depth; Or in the Bottome of a Well within Water; And
best of all the Hanging of them in a deepe Well somewhat aboue the Water,
for some forthnights space, is an Excellent Meanes of making Drink fresh,
and quicke: for the Cold doth not cause my Exhaling of the Spirits at
all; As Heat doth, though it rarifieth the rest that remaine: But Cold maketh
the Spirits vigorous, and irritateth them, whereby they Incorporate
the Parts of the Liquour perfectly.
                  
                      As for the Maturation of Fruits; It is wrought by the Calling forth of
the Spirits of the Body outward, and so Spreading them more Smoothly:
And likewise by Digesting, in some degree, the Grosser Parts: And this
is Effected, by Heat; Motion; Attraction; And by a Rudiment of Putrefaction:
For the Inception of Putrefaction hath in it a Maturation.
                  
                  
                      There were taken Apples, and laid in Straw; In Hay; In Flower;
In Chalke; In Lime; Couered ouer with Onions; Couered ouer with
Crabs; Closed vp in Wax; Shut in a Box; &amp;c. There was also an
Apple hanged vp in Smoake: Of all which the Experiments sorted in this
Manner.
                  
                      After a Moneths Space, the Apple Enclosed in Wax, was as Greene
and Fresh as at the first Putting in, and the Kernells continued White. The
Cause is, for that all Exclusion of Open Aire, (which is euer Predatory)
maintaineth the Body in his first Freshnesse, and Moisture: But the Inconuenience

is, that it tasteth a little of the Wax: Which, I suppose, in a
Pomgranate, or some such thick-coated Fruit, it would not doe.
                  The Apple Hanged in the Smoake, turned like an Old Mellow Apple,
                     
Wrinkled, Drle, Soft, Sweet Yellow within. The Cause is, for that such
a degree of Heat, which doth neither Melt, nor Scorch, (For we see that
in a greater Heat, a Roast Apple Softneth and Melteth; And Pigs feet,
made of Quarters of Wardens, scorch and haue a Skin of Cole) doth
Mellow, and not Adure: The Smoake also maketh the Apple (as it were)
sprinkled with Soot, which helpeth to Mature. We see than in Drying of
Peares, and Prunes, in the Ouen, and Remouing of them often as they
begin to Sweat, there is a like Operation; But that is with a farre more
Intense degree of Heat.
                  
                  The Apples couered in the Lime and Ashes, were well Matured; As appeared 
both in their Yellownesse, and Sweetnesse. The Cause is, for
that that Degree of Heat which is in Lime, and Ashes, (being a Smoothering
Heat) is of all the rest most Proper; for it doth neither Liquefie, nor
Atefie; And that is true Maturation, N
                        ••
                      that the Taste of those Apples
was good; And therefore it is the Experiment fittest for Vse.
                  The Apples, Conered with Crabs, and Onions, were likewise well Matured.
                     
The Cause is, not any, Heat; But for that the Crab and the Onions
draw forth the

                  The World hath beene much abused by the Opinion of
Making of Gold:
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Making of Gold.
                      The Worke it selfe I iudge to be possible;
But the Meanes (hitherto propounded) to effect it, are, in the
Practise, full of Errour and Imposture; And in the Theory,
full of vnsound Imaginations. For to say, that Nature hath
an Intention to make all Metals Gold; And that, if she were deliuered
from Impediments, she would performe her owne
Worke; And that, if the Crudities, Impurities, and Leprosities
of Metals were cured, they would become Gold; And that a
little Quantitie of the Medicine, in the Worke of Proiection,
will turne a Sea of the Baser Metall into Gold, by Multiplying:
All these are but dreames: And so are many other Grounds
of Alchymy. And to helpe the Matter, the Alchymists call in
likewise many Vanities, out of Astrologie; Naturall Magicke;
Superstitious Interpretations of Scriptures; Auricular Traditions;
Faigned Testimonies of Ancient Authors; And the like.
It is true, on the other side, they haue brought to light not a
few profitable Experiments, and thereby made the World
some amends. But wee, when wee shall come to handle the
Version and Transmutation of Bodies; And the Experiments
concerning Metalls, and Mineralls; will lay open the true
Wayes and Passages of Nature, which may leade to this great
Effect. And wee commend the wit of the Chineses, who despaire
of Making of Gold, but are Mad vpon the Making of
Siluer: For certaine it is, that it is more difficult to make Gold,
(which is the most Ponderous and Materiate amongst Metalls)
of other Metalls, lesse Ponderous, and lesse Materiate;
than (viâ versâ) to make Siluer of Lead, or Quick-Siluer; Both which are more Ponderous than Siluer; So that they

need rather a further Degree of Fixation, than any Condensation.
In the meanetime, by Occasion of Handling the Axiomes
touching Maturation, we will direct a Triall touching the Maturing
of Metalls, and therby Turning some of them into Gold;
For we conceiue indeed, that a perfect good Concoction, or Disgestion, or Maturation of some Metalls, will produce Gold.
And here we call to minde, that wee knew a Dutch-man, that
had wrought himselfe into the beleese of a great Person, by
vndertaking that he could make Gold: Whose discourse was,
that Gold might be made; But that the Alchymists Ouer-fired
the Worke: For (he said) the Making of Gold did require a
very temperate Heat, as being in Nature a Subterrany worke,
where little Heat commeth; But yet more to the Making of
Gold, than of any other Metall; And therefore, that he would
doe it with a great Lampe, that should carry a Temperate and
Equall Heat: And that it was the Worke of many Moneths.
The Deuice of the Lampe was folly; But the Ouer-firing
now vsed; And the Equall Heat to be required; And the
Making it a Worke of some good Time; are no ill Discourses.
                  We resort therefore to our Axiomes of Maturation, in Effect
touched before. The First is, that there be vsed a Temporate
Heat; For they are euer Temperate Heats that Disgest, and
Mature: Wherein we meane Temperate, according to the Nature
of the Subiect; For that may be Temperate to Fruits, and
Liquours, which will not worke at all vpon Metalls. The Second
is, that the Spirit of the Metall be quickened, and the Tangible
Parts opened: For without those two Operations, the
Spirit of the Metall, wrought vpon, will not be able to disgest
the Parts. The Third is, that the Spirits doe spread themselues
Euen, and moue not Subsultorily; For that will make the Parts
Close, and Pliant. And this requireth a Heat, that doth not
rise and fall, but continue as Equall as may be. The Fourth is,
that no Part of the Spirit be emitted, but detained: For if there be
Emission of Spirit, the Body of the Metall will be Hard, and
Churlish. And this will be performed, partly by the Temper
of the Fire; And partly by the closenesse of the Vessell. The

Fifth is, that there be Choice made of the likeliest and best Prepared
Metall, for the Version: For that will facilitate the Worke.
The Sixth is, that you giue Time enough for the Worke: Not to
prolong Hopes (as the Alchymists doe;) but indeed to giue
Nature a conuenient Space to worke in. These Principles are
most certaine, and true; Wee will now deriue a direction of
Triall out of them; Which may (perhaps) by further Meditation,
be improued.
                  
                      Let there be a Small Furnace made, of a Temperate Heat; Let the
Heat be such, as may keepe the Metall perpetually Moulten, and no more;
For that aboue all importeth to the Worke. For the Materiall, take
Siluer, which is the Metall that in Nature Symbolizeth most with Gold;
Put in also, with the Siluer, a Tenth Part of Quick-siluer, and a Twelfth
Part of Nitre, by weight; Both these to quicken and open the Body of
the Metall: And so let the Worke be continued by the Space of Six Moneths,
at the least. I wish also, that there be, at some times, an Iniection
of some Oyled Substance; Such as they vse in the Recouering of Gold,
which by Vexing with Separations hath beene made Churlish: And
this is, to lay the Parts more Close and Smooth, which is the Maine
Worke. For Gold (as we see) is the Closest (and therefore the Heauiest)
of Metalls: And is likewise the most Flexible, and Tensible. Note, that
to thinke to make Gold of Quick-Siluer, because it is the heauiest, is a
Thing not to be hoped; For Quick-Siluer will not endure the Mannage
of the Fire. Next to Siluer, I thinke Copper were fittest to bee the Materiall.
                  
                  Gold hath these Natures: Greatnesse of Weight; Closenesse of Parts;
Fixation; pliant
                           •
                        esse, or Softnesse; Immunity from Rust; Colour or Tincture of Yellow.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Nature of Gold.
                      Therfore the Sure Way, (though most about,) to make

                     Gold, is to know the Causes of the Seuerall Natures before rehearsed,
and the Axiomes concerning the same. For if a Man can make a Metall,
that hath all these Properties, Let Men dispute, whether it be Gold,
or no?
                  The Enducing and Accelerating of Putrefaction, is a Subiect
of a very Vniuersall Enquiry: For Corruption is a Reciprocall
to Generation.
                     Experiments in Consort touching the Enducing and Accelerating of Putrefaction.
                      And they Two, are as Natures two Termes or
Bundaries; And the Guides to Life and Death, Putrefaction is
the Worke of the Spirits of Bodies, which euer are Vnquiet to
Get forth, and Congregate with the Aire, and to onioy the Sunbeames:
The Getting forth, or Spreading of the Spirits, (which
is a Degree of Getting forth,) hath fine Differing Operations. If

the Spirits be detained within the Body, and moue more violently,
there followeth Colliquation; As in Metalls, &amp;c. If more
Mildely, there followeth Disgestion, or Maturation, As in
Drinkes, and Fruits. If the Spirits be not meerely Detained,
but Protrude a little, and that Motion be Confused, and Inordinate,
there followeth Putrefaction; Which euer dissolueth
the Consistence of the Body into much Inequality; As in
Flesh, Rotten Fruits, Shining Wood, &amp;c. And also in the Rust of
Metalls. But if that Motion be in a certaine Order, there followeth
Viuification, and Figuration; As both in Liuing Creatures
bred of Putrefaction, and in Liuing Creatures Perfect. But
if the Spirits issue out of the Body, there followeth Deficcation,
Induration, Consumption, &amp;c. As in Bricke, Euaporation of Bodies
Liquid, &amp;c.
                  The Meanes to Enduce and Accelerate Putrefaction, are; First by Adding 
some Crude pr Watry Moisture; As in Wetting of any Flesh, Fruit,
Wood, with Water, &amp;c. For contrariwise Vnctuous and Oyly Substances preserue.
                  The Second is by Inuitation or Excitation; As when a Rotten Apple
                     
lyeth close to another Apple that is Sound; Or when Dung (which is a
substance, already Putrified) is added to other Bodies. And this is also
notably seene in Church-yards, where they bury much; Where the
Earth will consume the Corps, in farre shorter time, than other Earth
will.
                  The Third is, by Closenesse, and Stopping, which detaineth the Spirits,
in Prison, more than they would; And thereby irritateth them to seeke
Issue; As in Corne, and Cloaths, which waxe Musty; and therefore
Open Aire (which they call Aer perstabilis) doth preserue: And this
doth appeare more Euidently in Agnes, which come (most of them,) of
Obstructions, and Penning the Humours, which thereupon Putrisie.
                  
                  The Fourth is, by Solution of Continuity; As we see an Apple will rot 
sooner, if it be Cut or Pierced; And so will Wood, &amp;c. And so the
Flesh of Creatures aliue, where they haue receiued any Wound.
                  The Fifth is, either by the Exhaling, or by the Driuing back of the 
                     Principall Spirits, which preserue the Consistence of the Body; So that
when their Gouernment is Dissolued, euery Part returneth to his Nature,
or Homogeny. And this appeareth in Vrine, and Blond, when
they coole, and thereby breake; It appeareth also in the Gangrene, or
Mortification of Flesh, either by Opiates, or by Intense Colds. I conceiue
also the same Effect is in Pestilences, for that the Malignity of the Infecting
Vapour, daunceth the Principall Spirits, and maketh them fly, and leaue
their Regiment; And then the Humours, Flesh, and Secondary Spirits, doe
dissolue, and breake, as in an Anarchy.
                  
                  
                     
                      The Sixth is, when a Forraine Spirit, Stronger and more Eager than
the Spirit of the Body, entreth the Body; As in the Stinging of Serpents.
And this is the Cause (generally) that vpon all Poysons followeth Swelling:
And we see Swelling followeth also, when the Spirits of the Body it selfe,
Congregate too much; As vpon Blowes, and Bruises; Or when they
are Pent in too much, as in Swelling vpon Cold. And we see also, that the
Spirits comming of Putrefaction of Humours in Agues, &amp;c. Which may
be counted as Forraine Spirits, though they be bred within the Body,
doe Extinguish and Suffocate the Naturall Spirits, and Heat.
                  
                  
                      The Seuenth is, by such a Weake Degree of Heat, as setteth the Spirits
in a little Motion, but is not able, either to disgest the Parts, or to Issue the Spirits;
As is seene in Flesh kept in a Roome that is not Coole; Whereas
in a Coole and Wet Larder it will keepe longer. And wee see, that
Viuisication (whereof Putrefaction is the Bastard Brother,) is effected by
such Soft Heats; As the Hatching of Egges; The Heat of the
Wombe, &amp;c.
                  
                      The Eight is, by the Releasing of the Spirits; which before were close
kept by the Solidnesse of their Couerture, and thereby their Appetite
of Issuing checked; As in the Artificiall Rusts induced by strong Waters,
in Iron, Lead, &amp;c. And therefore Wetting hasteneth Rust, or Putrefaction
of any thing, because it softeneth the Crust, for the Spirits to
come forth.
                  
                      The Ninth is, by the Enterchange of Heat and Cold, or Wet and dry;
As wee see in the Moulding of Earth in Frosts, and Sunne; And in
the more hasty Rotting of Wood, that is sometimes wet, sometimes
dry.
                  
                      The Tenth is, by Time, and the Worke Procedure of the Spirits themselues,
which cannot keepe their Station; Especially if they be lost to
themselues; And there be not Agitation or Locall Motion. As wee
see in Corne not stirred; And Mens Bodies not exercised.
                  
                      All Moulds are Inceptions of Putrefaction; As the Moulds of Pyes,
and Flesh; the Moulds of Orenges, and Limons; which Moulds afterwards
turne into Wormes, or more odious Putrefactions: And therfore (commonly)
proue to be ill Odour. And if the Body be Liquid, and not
apt to Putrifie totally, it will cast vp a Mother in the Top; As the Mothers
of Distilled Waters.
                  
                  
                     
                     Mosse is a kinde of Mould, of the Earth, and Trees. But it may be
better sorted as a Rudiment of Germination; To which we referre it.
                  It is an Enquiry of Excellent vse, to Enquire of the Meanes
of Preuenting or Staying Putrefaction, For therein consisteth
the Meanes of Conseruation of Bodies; For Bodies haue two
Kindes of Dissolutions; The one by Consumption, and Deficcation;
The other by Putrefaction.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching Pro
                           
                              ••••••
                           
                         and Preuenting Putrefaction.
                      But as for the Putrefactions
                     
of the Bodies of Men, and Liuing Creatures, (as in Agues,
Wormes, Consumptions of the Lungs, Impostumes, and Vlcers
both Inwards and Outwards,) they are a great Part of
Physicke, and Surgery: And therefore we will reserue the Enquiry
of them to the proper Place, where we shall handle Medicinal
Experiments of all Sorts. Of the rest we will now Enter
into an Enquiry: wherein much light may be taken, form
that which hath beene said, of the Meanes to Enduce or Accelerate
Putrefaction; For the Remouing that, which caused Putrefaction,
doth Preuent and Auoid Putrefaction.
                  
                  The First Meanes of Prohibiting or Checking Putrefaction, is Cold:
                     
For so wee see Meat and Drinke will last longer, Vnputrified, or
Vnsowred, in Winter, than in Summer: And we see that Flowers, and
fruits, put in Conseruatories of Snow, keepe fresh. And this worketh
by the Detention of the Spirits, and Constipation of the Tangible Parts.
                  
                  The Second is Astriction: For Astriction prohibiteth Dissolution: As 
we see (generally) in Medicines, whereof such as are Astringents doe inhibite
Putrefaction; And by the same reason of Astringency, some small
Quantity of Oile of Vitrioll, will keepe Fresh Water long from Putrefying.
And this Astriction is in a substance that hath a Virtuall Cold; And
it worketh (partly) by the fame Meanes that Cold doth.
                  The Third is, the Excluding of the Aire; And againe, the Exposing
                     
                     to the Aire; For these Contraries, (as it commeth often to passe;) worke
the same Effect, according to the Nature of the Subiect Matter. So we
see, that Beere, or Wine, in Bottles close stopped, last long; That the
Garners vnder Ground keepe Come longer than those aboue Ground;
and that Fruit closed in Waxe keepeth fresh: And likewise Bodies put in
Honey, and Flower, keepe more fresh; And Liquours, Drinkes, and Iuices,
with a little Oyle cast on the Top keepe fresh. Contratiwise, we see that
Cloth and Apparell, not Aired, doe breed Moathes, and Mould; And the
Diuersity is, that in Bodies that need Detenties of Spirits, the Excluston
of the Aire doth good; As in Drinkes, and C
                           ••••
                        : But in Bodies that need
Emission of Spirits, to discharge some of the Superfluous Moisture, it
doth hurt, for they require Atring.
                  
                  The fourth is Motion, and Stirring; For Putrefaction asketh Rest; For 
the Subtill Motion, which Putrefaction requireth, is disturbed by any Agitation;
And all Locall Motion keepeth Bodies Integrall, and their Parts
together; As we see that Turning ouer of Corne in a Garner; Or Letting
it runne like an Houre-glasse, from an vpper Roome into a Lower,
doth keepe it Sweet; And Running Waters putrefie not; And in Mens
Bodles. Exercise hindreth Putrefaction; And contrariwise Rest, and
Want of Motion, or Stoppings, (whereby the Runne of Humours, or
the Motion of Perspiration, is stayed,) further Putrefaction; As we part
partly touched a little before.
                  
                     
                      The Fifth is, the Breathing forth of the Aduentitious Moisture in Bodies;
For as Wetting doth hasten Putrefaction; So Connenient Drying. (wherby
the more Radicall Moisture is onely kept in,) putteth backe Putrefaction:
So we see that Herbs, and Flowers, if they be dried in the Shade; Or
dried in the hot Sunne, for a small time, keepe best. For the Emission of
the Loose and Aduentitious Moisture, doth betray the Radicall Moisture;
And carryeth it out for Company.
                  
                      The Sixth is, the Strengthning of the Spirits of Bodies; For as a Great
Heat keepeth Bodies from Putrefaction; But a Tepide Heat enclineth them
to Putrefaction: So a Strong Spirit likewise preserueth, and a Weake or
Faint Spirit disposeth to Corruption. So we finde that Salt-water corrupteth
not so soone as Fresh: And Salting of Oisters, and Powdring
of Meat, keepeth them from Putrefaction, It would be tried also, whether
Chalke put into Water, or Drinke doth not preserue it from Putrefying,
or speedy Souring. So wee see that Strong Beere, will last longer
than Small; And all Things, that are hot and Aromaticall, doe helpe
to preserue Liquours, or Powders, &amp;c. Which they doe, as well by
Strengthning the Spirits, as by Soaking out the loose Moisture;
                  
                  
                      The Seuenth is, Separation of the Cruder Parts, and thereby making
the Body more Equall; for all vnperfect Mixture is apt to Putrefie; And
Watry Substances are more apt to Putrefie, than Oyly. So we see Distilled
Waters will last longer than Raw waters; And Things that haue
passed the Fire, doe last longer, than those that haue not passed the Fire;
As Dried Peares, &amp;c.
                  
                      The Eighth is, the Drawing forth continually of that part, where the Putrefaction beginneth: Which is (commonly) the Loose and watry Moisture;
Not onely for the Reason before giuen, that it prouoketh the Radicall
Moisture to come forth with it; But because being detained in the
Body, the Putrefaction taking hold of it, insecteth the rest: As we see in
the Embalming dead Bodies; And the same Reason is of Preseruing Herbs,
or Fruits, or Flowers, in Branne, or Meale.
                  
                  
                      The Ninth, is the Commixiture of any Thing that is more Oily, or Sweet:
For such Bodies are least apt to Putrefie, the Aire working little vpon
them; And they not putrefying preserue the rest. And therefore we see
Syrrups, and Ointments, will last longer, than Iuyces.
                  
                  
                      The Tenth is, the Commixture of somewhat that is Dry; For Putrefaction
beginneth first from the Spirits; And then from the Moisture; And that that is dry is vnapt to puttrefie: And therefore
Smoake preserueth Flesh; As wee see in Bacon, and Neats-Tongues, and Martlemas
Beese, &amp;c.
                  
                      The Opinion of some of the Ancients, that Blowne Aires doe preserue Bodies, longer than other Aires, seemeth to Mee Probable; For
that the Blowne Aires, being Ouer-charged and Compressed, will hardly
receiue the Exhaling of any Thing, but rather repulse it. It was tried
in a Blowne Bladder, whereinto Flesh was put, and likewise a Flower, and
it sorted not; For Dry Bladders will not Blow: And New Bladders rather

further Putrefaction: The way were therfore, blow strongly, with
a Paire of Bellowes, into a Hogshead, putting into the Hogshead (before)
that which you would haue preserued; And in the instant that you
withdraw the Bellowes, stop the Hole close.
                  The Experiments of Wood that Shineth in the Darke, we haue diligently
driuen, and pursued.Experiment Solitary, touching Wood Shining in the Darke.
                      The rather, for that of all Things, that giue
Light here below, it is the most Durable. And hath least Apparent Motion,
Fire and Flame are in continuall Expence; Sugar shineth onely
while it is in Scraping; And Salt-water while it is in Dashing; Glowing
                     
                     
                        ••
                     es haue their Shining while they liue or a little after; Onely Scales
of Fishes (Putrified) seeme to be of the same Nature with Shining Wood;
And it is true, that all Putrefaction hath with it an Inward Motion, as
well as Fire, or Light. The Triall sorted thus. 1. The Shining is in some
Peeces more Bright, in some more Di
                           •••
                        ; but the most Bright of all
doth not attaine to the Light of a Glow-w
                           ••••
                        . 2. The Woods that haue
beene tried to shine, are chiefly Sallow, and Willow; Also the A
                           ••
                        , and
Husle; It may be, it holdeth in others. 3. Both Roots, and Bodies doe
shine, but the Roots better. 4. The Colour of the Shining Part, by Daylight,
is in some Peeces White, in some Peeces inclining to Red; Which
in the Countrey they call the White, and Red Garret. 5. The Part that
Shineth, is, (for the most part) somewhat Safe, and Moist to feele to;
But some was sound to be Firme and Hard; So as it might be figured
into a Crosse, or into Beads, &amp;c. But you must not looke to haue an Image,
or the like, in any Thing that is Lightsome; For euen a face in
Iron red Hot will not be seene, the Light confounding the small differences
of Lightsome and Darksome, which shew the figure. 6. There
was the Shining Part pared off, till you came to that, that did not Shine;
But within two Dayes the Part Contiguous began also to Shine, being
laid abroad in the Dew; So as it seemeth the Putrefaction spreadeth.
7. There was other dead Wood of like kinde, that was Laid abroad, which
Shined not at the first; But after a Nights lying abroad began to Shine.
8. There was other Wood, that did First Shine; And being laid dry in the
House, within fiue or six daies, Lost the Shining; And laid abroad againe,
Recouered the Shining: 9. Shining woods, being laid in a Dry
Roome, within a Seuen night, lose their Shining; But being laid in a
Cellar, or Darke Roome, kept the Shining. 10. The Boring of Holes, in that
kinde of Wood, and then laying it abroad, seemeth to conduce to
make it Shine: The Cause is, for that all Solution of Continuity doth helpe
on Putrefaction, as was touched before. 11. No Wood hath beene yet
tried to Shine, that was cut downe aliue, but such as was Rotted, both in
Stocke, and Root, while it grew. 12. Part of the Wood that Shined, was
Steeped in Oyle, and retained the Shining a Forthnight. 13. The like succeeded
in some Steeped in Water, and much better. 14. How long the
Shining will continue, if the Wood be laid abroad euery Night, and taken
in and Sprinckled with Water in the Day, is not yet tryed. 15. Triall was

made of laying it abroad in Frostie weather, which hurt it not. 16. There
was a great Peece of a Root which did shine, and the Shining Part was Cut
off, till no more Shined; Yet after two Nights, though it were kept in a
drie Roome, it got a Shining.
                  
                  The Bringing, forth of liuing Creatures may be accelerated in two Respects:
The one, if the Embryon ripeneth and perfecteth sooner: The
other if there be some Cause from the Mothers Body, of Expulsion or Putting
 it downe: whereof the Former is good, and argueth Strength; The
Latter is ill, and commeth by Accident or Disease.Experiment Solitary touching the Acceleration of Birth
                      And therefore the
Ancient Obseruation is true, that the Childe borne in the Seuenth Mo
                           •••
                        th,
doth commonly well; But Borne in the Eighth Moneth, doth (for the
most part) die. But the Cause assigned is Fabulous; Which is, that in
the Eighth Moneth, should be the Returne of the Raigne, of the Planet
Saturne: which (as they say) is a Planet Maligne; whereas in the Seuenth
is the Raigne of the Moone, which is a Planet Propitious. But the
true Cause is, for that where there is so great a Preuention of the Ordinary
time, it is the lustinesse of the Childe; But when it is lesse, it is some Indisposition
of the Mother.
                  
                  To Accelerate Growth or Stature, it must proceed; Either from the
Plentie of the Nourishment; Or from the Nature of the Nourishment;
Or from the Quickening and Exciting of the Naturall Heat.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Acceleration of growth and Stature.
                      For the first,
Excesse of Nourishment is hurtfull; For it maketh the Childe Corpulent;
And Growing in Breadth, rather than in Heighth. And you may take
 an Experiment from Plants, which, if they spread much, are seldome
tall. As for the Nature of the Nourishment; First, it may not be too Drie;
And therefore Children in Dayrie Countries doe wax more tall, than
where they feed more vpon Bread, and Flesh. There is also a receiued
Tale; That Boyling of Dasie Roots in Milke (which it is certaine are great
Driers) will make Dogs little. But so much is true, that an Ouer-drie
Nourishment in Childhood putteth backe Stature. Secondly, the Nourishment
must be of an Opening Nature; For that Attenuateth the Iuice,
and furthereth the Motion of the Spirits, vpwards. Neither is it without
cause, that Xenophon, in the Nouriture of the Persian Children, doth
so much commend their Feeding vpon Cardamon; which (hee saith)
made them grow better, and be of a more Actiue Habit. Cardamon is in
Latine Nasturtium; And with vs Water-Cresses; Which, it is certaine, is
an Herbe, that whilest it is young, is Friendly to Life. As for the Quickening
of Naturall Heat, it must be done chiefly with Exercise; And therefore
(no doubt) much Going to Schoole, where they sit so much, hindreth
the Growth of Children; whereas Countrey People, that goe not
to Schoole, are commonly of better Stature. And againe Men must beware,
how they giue Children, any thing that is Cold in Operation; For
euen Long Sucking doth hinder both Wit, and Stature. This hath beene
tried, that a Whelpe, that hath beene fed with Nitre in Milke, hath become

very little, but extreme liuely: For the Spirit of Nitre is Cold. And
though it be an Excellent. Medicine, in Strength of yeares, for Prolongation
of Life; yet it is, in Children and young Creatures, an Enemy
to Growth: And all for the same Reason, For Heat is requisite to
Growth: But after a Man is come to his Middle Age, Heat consumeth
the Spirits; which the Coldnesse of the Spirit of Nitre doth helpe to
condense, and correct.
                  There be two Great Families of Things; You may terme
them by seuerall Names; Sulphureous and Mercuriall, which
are the Chymists Words: (For as for their Sal, which is their
Third Principle, it is a Compound of the other two;) Inflammable
and Not Inflammable; Mature and Crude; Oily and Watry.
                     Experiments in Consort touching Sulphur and Mercury, two of Paracel
                              •
                           es Principles.
                     
For we see that in Subterranies there are, as the Fathers of
their Tribes, Brimstone and Mercury: In Vegetables, and Liuing
Creatures there is Water and Oyle: In the Inferiour Order
of Pneumaticalls there is Aire and Flame: And in the Superiour,
there is the Body of the Starre, and the Pure Sky. And these
Paires, though they be vnlike in the Primitiue Differences of
Matter, yet they seeme to haue many Consents: For Mercury
and Sulphure are principall Materialls of Metalls; Water and
Oyle, are principall Materialls of Vegetables, and Animals; And
seeme to differ but in Maturation, or Concoction: Flame (in
Vulgar Opinion) is but Aire Incensed; And they both haue
Quicknesse of Motion, and Facility of Cession, much alike:
And the Interstellar Sky, (though the Opinion be vaine, that
the Starre is the Denser Part of his Orbe,) hath notwithstanding
so much Affinity with the Starre, that there is a Rotation
of that, as well as of the Starre. Therefore, it is one of the greatest
Magnalia Naturae, to turne Water, or Watry Iuyce, into Oile
or Oily Iuyce: Greater in Nature, than to turne Siluer, or
Quick-siluer, into Gold.
                  
                  The Instances we haue, wherein Crude and Watry Substance turneth 
into Fat and Oily, are of foure kindes. First in the Mixture of Earth
and Water; which mingled by the helpe of the Sunne, gather a Nitrous
Fatnesse, more than either of them haue seuerally; As we see, in that
they put forth Plants, which need both Iuyces.
                  The Second is in the Assimilation of Nourishment, made in the Bodies
                     
of Plants, and Liuing Creatures; Where of Plants turne the Iuyce of
meere Water and Earth, into a great deale of Oily Matter: Liuing Creatures,
                     
though much of their Fat, and Flesh, are out of Oily Aliments, (as
Meat, and Bread,) yet they Assimilate also in a Measure their Drinke of
VVater, &amp;c. But these two Wayes of Version of Water into Oyle, (namely
by Mixture, and by Assimilation) are by many Passages, and Percolations,
and by long Continuance of soft Heats, and by Circuits of
Time.
                  
                      The third is in the Inception of Putrefaction; As in Water Corrupted;
And the Mothers of Waters Distilled; Both which haue a kinde of Fatnesse,
or Oyle.
                  
                  
                      The Fourth is in the Dulcoration of some Metalls; As Saccharum
Saturni, &amp;c.
                  
                      The Intention of Version of Water into a more Oily Substance, is by
Disgestion; For Oile is almost Nothing else but Water disgested; And this
Disgestion; is principally by Heats Which Heat must be either Outward, or
Inward: Againe, it may be by Prouocation, or Excitation; Which is
caused by the Mingling of Bodies already Oily, or Disgested; For they
will somewhat Communicate their Nature with the rest. Disgestion also
is strongly effected by direct Assimilation, of Bodies Crude into Bodies
Disgested; As in Plants, and Liuing Creatures, whose Nourishment is far
more Crude than their Bodies: But this Disgestion is by a great Compasse,
as hath beene said. As for the more full Handling of these two
Principles, whereof this is but a Taste; (the Enquiry of which is one of
the Profoundest Enquiries of Nature,) We leaue it to the Title of Version
of Bodies; And likewise to the Title of the First Congregations of Matter;
Which like a Generall Assembly of Estates, doth giue Law to all
Bodies.
                  
                  A Chameleon is a Creature about the Bignesse of an Ordinary Lizard:
His Head vnproportionably bigge; His Eyes great: He moueth
his Head without the writhing of his Necke, (which is inflexible,) as a

                     Hogge doth: His Backe crooked; His Skin Spotted with little Tumours,
lesse Eminent nearer the Belly; His Taile slender, and long: On each
Foot he hath fiue Fingers; three on the Outside, and two on the Inside;
His Tongue of a maruellous Length in respect of his Body, and hollow
at the end; Which he will launch out to prey vpon Flses.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Chameleons.
                      Of Colour
Greene, and of a dusky Yellow, brighter and whiter towards the
Belly; Yet spotted with Blew, White, and Red. If hee be laid vpon
Greene, the Greene predominateth; If vpon Yellow, the Yellow; Not
so if he be laid vpon Blew, or Red, or White; Onely the Greene Spots
receiue a more Orient Lustre: Laid vpon Blacke, he looketh all Blacke,
though not without a Mixture of Greene. He feedeth not only vpon
Aire, (though that be his principall Sustenance;) For sometimes hee
taketh Flies, as was said; yet some that haue kept Chameleons a whole
yeare together, could neuer perceiue that euer they fed vpon any Thing
else but Aire; And might obserue their Bellies to swell after they had
exhausted the Aire, and closed their Iawes; Which they open commonly

against the Rayes of the Sunne. They haue a foolish Tradition
in Magicke, that if a Chameleon be burnt vpon the Top of a House, it will
raise a Tempest; Supposing (according to their vaine Dreames of Sympathies)
because he nourisheth with Aire, his Body should haue great
vertue to make Impression vpon the Aire.
                  It is reported by one of the Ancients, that in Part of Media, there are
Eruptions of Flames out of Plaines; And that those Flames are cleare, and
cast not forth such Smoake, and Ashes, and Pummice, as Mountaine
Flames doe.Experiment Solitary, touching Subterrany Fires.
                      The Reason (no doubt) is, because the Flame is not pent,
as it is in Mountaines, and Earth-quakes which cast Flame. There be also 
some Blinde Fires, vnder Stone, which flame not out, but Oile being powred
vpon them, they flame out. The Cause whereof is, for that it seemeth,
the Fire is so choaked, as not able to remoue the Stone, it is Heat,
rather than Flame; Which neuerthelesse is sufficient to Enflame the
Oyle.
                  
                  It is reported, that in some Lakes, the Water is so Nitrous, as if Foule
Cloaths be put into it, it scoureth them of it selfe: And if they stay any
whit long, they moulder away.Experiment Solitary, touching Nitre.
                      And the Scouring Vertue of Nitre is 
the more to be noted, because it is a Body Cold; And we see Warme Water
scoureth better than Cold. But the Cause is, for that it hath a Subtill
Spirit, which seuereth and diuideth any thing that is soule, and Viscous,
and sticketh vpon a Body.
                  Take a Bladder, the greatest you can get; Fill it full of Winde, and
tye it about the Necke with a Silke thred waxed; And vpon that put
likewise Wax very close; So that when the Neck of the Bladder dryeth,
no Aire may possibly get in, nor out.Experiment Solitary touching Congealing of Aire.
                      Then bury it three or foure foot 
vnder the Earth, in a Vault, or in a Conferuatory of Snow, the Snow being
made hollow about the Bladder; And after some Forthnights distance,
see whether the Bladder be shruncke: For if it be, then it is plaine, that
the Coldnesse of the Earth, or Snow, hath Condensed the Aire, and
brought it a Degree nearer to Water: Which is an Experiment of great
Consequence.
                  It is a Report of some good credit, that in Deepe Caues, there are
Pensile Crystall, and Degrees of Crystall that drop from aboue; And in
some other, (though more rarely) that rise from below.Experiment Solitary touching Congealing of Water into Crystall.
                      Which though
it be chiefly the Worke of Cold, yet it may be, that Water, that passeth
thorow the Earth, gathereth a Nature more clammy, and fitter to 
Congeale, and become Solide, than Water of it selfe. Therfore Triall
would be made, to lay a Heape of Earth, in great Frosts, vpon a Hollow
Vessell, putting a Canuase betweene, that it falleth not in: And poure
Water vpon it, in such Quantitie, as will be sure to soake thorow; And
see whether it will not make an harder Ice in the bottome of the Vessell,

and lesse apt to dissolue, than ordinarily. I suppose also, that if you make
the Earth narrower at the bottome, than at the Top, in fashion of a Sugar
Loafe Reuersed, it will helpe the Experiment. For it will make the
Ice, where it Issueth, lesse in Bulke; And euermore Smalnesse of Quantity
is a Helpe to Version.
                  
                  Take Damaske Roses, and pull them; Then dry them vpon the Top
of an House, vpon a Lead or Tarras, in the hot Sunne, in a cleare day,
betweene the Houres (onely) of twelue and two; or there abouts.Experiment Solitary touching Preseruing of Roseleaues, both in Colour, &amp; Smell.
                      Then
put them into a Sweet Dry Earthen Bottle, or a Glasse, with narrow
Mouthes, stuffing them close together, but without Bruising: Stop the

                     Bottle, or Glasse, close, and these Roses will retaine, not onely their Smell
Perfect, but their Colour fresh, for a yeare at least. Note, that Nothing
doth so much destroy any Plant, or other Body, either by Putrefaction,
or Arefaction, as the Aduentitious Moisture, which hangeth loose in the
Body, if it be not drawne out. For it betrayeth and tolleth forth the Innate
and Radicall Moisture, along with it, when it selfe goeth forth. And
therefore in Liuing Creatures, Moderate Sweat doth preserue the Iuyce
of the Body. Note that these Roses, when you take them from the Drying,
haue little or no Smell; So that the Smell is a Second Smell, that issueth
out of the Flower afterwards.
                  The Continuance of Flame, according vnto the diuersity of the Body
Enflamed, and other Circumstances, is worthy the Enquiry; Chiefly,
for that though Flame be (almost) of a Momentany Lasting, yet it receiueth
the More, and the Lesse: we will first therefore speake (at large) of

                     Bodies Enflamed, wholly, and Immediately, without any Wieke to helpe
the Inflammations.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching the Continuance of Flame.
                      A Spoonefull of Spirit of Wine, a little heated, was
taken, and it burnt as long as came to 116. Pulses. The same Quantity
of Spirit of Wine, Mixed with the Sixth Part of a Spoonefull of Nitre,
burnt but to the space of 94. Pulses. Mixed with the like Quantity of
Bay-salt, 83. Pulses. Mixed with the like Quantity of Gunpowder, which
dissolued into a Blacke water, 110. Pulses. A Cube, or Pellet of Yellow
Waxe, was taken, as much as halfe the Spirit of Wine, and set in the Middest,
and it burnt onely to the space of 87. Pulses. Mixed with the Sixth
Part of a spoonefull of Milke, it burnt to the space of 100. Pulses; And
the Milke was crudled. Mixed with the Sixth Part of a spoonefull of
Water, it burnt to the space of 86. Pulses; With an Equall Quantity of
Water, onely to the space of 4. Pulses. A small Pebble was laid in the
Middest; and the Spirit of Wine burnt to the space of 94. Pulses. A
Peece of Wood, of the Bignesse of an Arrow, and about a Fingers
length, was set vp in the Middest, and the Spirit of Wine burnt to the
space of 94. Pulses. So that the Spirit of Wine Simple, endured the
longest; And the Spirit of Wine with the Bay-salt, and the Equall Quantity
of Water, were the shortest.
                  
                      Consider well, whether the more speedy Going forth of the flame, becaused,

by the Greater Vigour of the Flame in Burning; Or by the Resistance
of the Body mixed, and the Auersion thereof to take Flame: Which
will appeare by the Quantitie of the Spirit of Wine, that remaineth after
the Going out of the Flame. And it seemeth cleerely to be the latter; For
that the Mixture of Things least apt to burne, is the Speediest in going
out. And note, by the way, that Spirit of Wine burned, till it goe out of
it selfe, will burne no more; And tasteth nothing so hot in the Mouth,
as it did; No nor yet sowre, (as if it were a degree towards Vinegar,)
which Burnt Wine doth; but flat and dead.
                  Note, that in the Experiment of Wax aforesaid, the Wax dissolued in 
the burning, and yet did not incorporate it selfe, with the Spirit of Wine,
to produce one Flame; but wheresoeuer the Wax floated, the Flame forsooke
it, till at last it spread all ouer, and put the Flame quite out.
                  The Experiments of the Mixtures of the Spirit of Wine enflamed, are 
Things of discouerie, and not of Vse: But now wee will speake of the
Continuance of Flames, such as are vsed for Candles, Lamps, or Tapers;
consisting of Inflammable Matters, and of a Wieke that prouoketh Inflamation.
And this importeth not only Discouerie, but also Vse and Profit;
For it is a great Sauing, in all such Lights, if they can be made as faire
and bright as others, and yet last longer. Wax Pure made into a Candle,
and Wax Mixed seuerally into Candle-stuffe, with the Particulars that
follow; (viz Water, Aqua-vitae, Milke, Bay-salt, Oyle, Butter, Nitre,
Brimstone, Saw-dust,) Euery of these bearing a Sixth Part to the Wax;
And euery of these Candles mixed, being of the same Weight and Wieke
with the Wax Pure, proued thus in the Burning, and Lasting. The Swiftest
in Consuming was that with Saw-dust; Which first burned faire, till
some part of the Candle was consumed; and the Dust gathered about the
Snaste; But then it made the Snaste bigge, and long, and to burne duskishly,
and the Candle wasted in halfe the time of the Wax Pure. The
next in Swiftnesse, were the Oyle, and Butter, which consumed, by a
Fifth part, swifter than the Pure Wax. Then followed in Swiftnesse the
Cleare Wax it selfe. Then the Bay-Salt, which lasted about an Eighth part
longer than the Cleare Wax. Then followed the Aqua-vita, which lasted
about a Fifth part longer than the Cleare Wax. Then followed the Milke,
and Water, with little difference from the Aqua-vita, but the Water slowest.
And in these foure last, the Wieke would spit forth little Sparks. For
the Nitre, it would not hold lighted aboue some Twelue Pulses; But all
the while it would spit out Portions of Flame, which afterwards would
goe out into a vapour. For the Brimstone, it would hold lighted, much
about the same time with the Nitre; But then after a little while, it would
harden and cake about the Snaste; So that the Mixture of Bay-Salt with
Wax, will winne an Eighth part of the time of lasting, and the Water a
Fifth.
                  After the Seuerall Materialls were tried, Triall was likewise made of 
seuerall Wickes; As of Ordinary Cotton; Sowing Thred; Rush; Silke;
Straw; and Wood. The Silke, Straw, and Wood, would flame a little, till

they came to the Wax, and then goe out: of the Other Three, the Thred
consumed faster than the Cotton, by a Sixth part of Time: The Cotton
next: Then the Rush consumed flower than the Cotton, by at least a third
part of time. For the Bignesse of the Flame, the Cotton, and Thred, cast a
Flame much alike; and the Rush much lesse, and dimmer. Quare, whether
Wood, and Wiekes both, as in Torches, consume faster, than the Wiekes
Simple?
                  
                  
                      We haue spoken of the Seuerall Materialls, and the Seuerall Wiekes:
But to the lasting of the Flame, it importeth also; Not only what the Materiall
is, but in the same Materiall, whether it be Hard, Soft, Old, New,
&amp;c. Good Housewines, to make their Candles burne the longer, vse to
lay them (one by one) in Bran, or Flower, which make them harder,
and so they Consume the flower: Insomuch, as by this meanes, they
will out-last other Candles, of the same Stuffe, almost Halfe in Halfe. For
Bran and Flower haue a Vertue to Harden: So that both Age, and lying
in the Bran, doth helpe to the Lasting. And wee see that Wax Candles
last longer than Tallow Candles, because Wax is more firme, and hard.
                  
                      The Lasting of Flame also dependeth vpon the easie Drawing of the
Nourishment; As we see in the Court of England, there is a Seruice which
they call All-night; which is (as it were) a great Cake of Wax, with the
Wieke in the Middest; whereby it commeth to passe, that the Wieke
fetcheth the Nourishment further off. Wee see also that Lamps last longer,
because the Vessell is farre broader, than the Bredth of a Taper, or
Candle.
                  
                      Take a Turretted Lampe of Tinne, made in the forme of a Squire; The
Heighth of the Turret being thrice as much, as the length of the lower
part, whereupon the Lampe standeth: Make only one Hole in it, at the
End of the Returne furthest from the Turret. Reuerse it, and fill it full
of Oile, by that Hole; And then set it vpright againe; And put a Wieke
in at the Hole; And lighten it: You shall finde, that it will burne flow,
and a long time. Which is caused, (as was said last before,) for that the
Flame fetcheth the Nourishment a Farre off. You shall finde also, that as
the Oile wasteth, and descendeth, so the Top of the Turret, by little and
little, filleth with Aire; which is caused by the Rarefaction of the Oile
by the Heat. It were worthy the Obseruation, to make a Hole, in the
Top of the Turret, and to trie, when the Oile is almost consumed, whether
the Aire made of the Oile, if you put to it a Flame of a Candle, in the
letting of it forth, will Enflame. It were good also to haue the Lampe
made, not of Tinne, but of Glasse, that you may see how the Vapour, or
Aire gathereth, by degrees, in the Top.
                  
                      A fourth Point, that importeth the lasting of the Flame, is the Closenesse
of the Aire, wherein the Flame burneth. Wee see, that if Wind
bloweth vpon a Candle, it wasteth apace. We see also, it lasteth longer in
a Lanthorne, than at large. And there are Traditions of Lamps, and Candles,
that haue burnt a very long time, in Caues, and Tombes.
                  
                  
                      A Fifth Point, that importeth the Lasting of the Flame, is the Nature
                     
of the Aire, where the Flame burneth; whether it be Hot or Cold;
Moist or Drie. The Aire, if it be very Cold, irritateth the Flame, and maketh
it burne more fiercely; (As Fire scorcheth in Frostie weather;)
And so furthereth the Consumption. The Aire once heated, (I conceiue)
maketh the Flame burne more mildly, and so helpeth the Continuance.
The Aire, if it be Drie, is indifferent: The Aire, if it be Moist, doth in a
Degree quench the Flame: (As wee see Lights will goe out in the Dumps
of Mines:) And howsoeuer maketh it burne more dully: And so helpeth
the Continuance.
                  
                  
                     Burialls in Earth serue for Preseruation; And for Condensation; And
for Induration of Bodies.
                     Experiments in Consort touching Burialls or Insusions of diuers Bodies in Earth.
                      And if you intend Condensation, or Induration
you may burie the Bodies so, as Earth may touch them: As if you will
make Artificiall Porcellane, &amp;c. And the like you may doe for Conseruation,
if the Bodies be Hard, and Solid; As Clay, Wood, &amp;c. But if you 
intend
Preseruation of Bodies, more Soft and Tender, then you must doe
one of these two: Either you must put them in Cases, whereby they may
not touch the Earth; Or else you must vault the Earth, whereby it may
hang ouer them, and not touch them; For if the Earth touch them, it
will doe more hurt, by the Moisture, causing them to putrifie, than good
by the virtuall Cold, to conserue them; Except the Earth be very Drie,
and Sandie.
                  An Orenge, Limon, and Apple, wrapt in a Linnen Cloth, being buried 
for a Forthnights Space, foure Foot deepe within the Earth, though it
were in a Moist Place, and a Rainie Time, yet came forth, no wayes
Mouldie, or Rotten, but were become a little harder than they were;
Otherwise fresh in their Colour; But their Iuyce somewhat flatted. But
with the Buriall of a Forthnight more they became Putrified.
                  A Bottle of Beere, buried in like manner, as before, became more 
liuely, better tasted, and Clearer, than it was. And a Bottle of Wine in
like manner. A Bottle of Vinegar, so buried, came forth more liuely, and
more Odoriferous, smelling almost like a Violet. And after the whole
Moneths Buriall, all the Three came forth, as fresh and liuely, if not
better, than before.
                  It were a profitable Experiment, to presrue Orenges, Limons, and Pomgranates,
                     
till Summer; For then their Price will be mightily increased.
This may be done, if you put them in a Pot or Vessell, well couered, that
the Moisture of the Earth come not at them; Or else by putting them in a
Conseruatorie of Snow. And generally, whosoeuer will make Experiments
of Cold, let him be prouided of three Things; A Conseruatorie of
Snow; A good large Vault, twenty foot at least vnder the Ground; And
a Deepe Well;
                  
                  There hath beene a Tradition, that Pearle, and Cora

that haue lost their Colours, may be recouered by Burying in the
Earth: Which is a thing of great profit, if it would sort: But vpon Triall
of Six Weekes Buriall, there followed no Effect. It were good to trie it,

in a Deepe Well; Or in a Conseruatory of Snow, where the Cold may be
more Constringent; And so make the Body more vnited, and thereby
more Resplendent.

                         winds. The Cause is, for that when
the Southerne Winds blow, the Humours doe (in some Degree) melt,
and waxe fluide, and so flow into the Parts; As it is seene in Wood, and
 other Bodies, which, when the Southerne Winds blow, doe swell. Besides,
the Motion and Actiuity of the Body consisteth chiefly in the Sinewes,
which, when the Southerne Wind bloweth, are more relaxe.
                  It is commonly seene, that more are Sick in the Summer, and more
Dye in the Winter; Except it be in Peslilent Diseases, which commonly
raigne in Summer, or Autumne.

                      The Reason is, because Diseases are bred
(indeed) chiefly by Heat; But then they are Cured most by Sweat, and

                     Purge; which in the Summer commeth on, or is prouoked, more Easily:
As for Pestilent Diseases, the Reason why most Dye of them in Summer,
is because they are bred most in the Summer; For otherwise those that
are touched are in most Danger in the Winter.
                  
                  The Generall Opinion is, that Yeares Hot and Moist, are most Pestilent; Vpon the Superficiall Ground, that Heat and Moisture cause Putrefaction.

In England it is found not true; For, many times, there haue
 beene great Plagues in Dry Yeares. Whereof the Cause may be, for that
Drought in the Bodies of Islanders, habituate to Moist Aires, doth Exasperate
the Humours, and maketh them more apt to Putrifie, or Enflame:
Besides, it tainteth the Waters (commonly,) and maketh them
lesse
wholesome. And againe in Barbary, the Plagues breake vp in the
Summer-moneths, when the Weather is Hot and Dry.
                  
                  Many Diseases, (both Epidemicall, and others,) breake forth at Particular times.

well within Water, as aboue,) haue not beene palled or deaded at all; But

as good, or somewhat better, than Bottles of the same Drinks, and Stalenesse,
kept in a Celler. But those which did hang aboue Water, were apparently
the best; And that Beere did flower a little; whereas that vnder
Water did not, though it were Fresh. The Milke sowred, and began to
Purrifie. Neuerthelosse it is true, that there is a Village neare Blois, where
in Deepe Canes they doe thicken Milke; In such sort, that it becommeth
very pleasant; Which was some Cause of this Triall of Hanging Milke
in the Well: But our proofe was naught; Neither doe I know, whether
that Milke in those Caues, be first boysed; It were good therefore to try
it with Milke Sodden, and with Creame; For that Milke of it selfe is
such a Compound Body, of Creame, Curds, and Whey, as it is eas

the Ripening and Clarifying of it.

                     Experiment Solitary, touching Stutting
                      The Cause may be, (in most,) the Refrigeration
of the Tongue; Whereby it is lesse apt to moue. And therfore
we see, that Naturalls doe generally Stut: And we see that in those that 
                     Stut, if they drinke Wine moderately, they Stut lesse, because it heateth:
And so we see, that they that Stut, doe Stut more in the first Offer to
speake, than in Continuance; Because the Tongue is, by Motion, somewhat
heated. In some also, it may be, (though rarely,) the Drinesse of
the Tongue; which likewise maketh it lesse apt to moue, as well as Cold;
For it is an Affect that commeth to some Wise and Great Men; As it did

                     Smells, and other Odours, are Sweeter in the Aire, at some Distance,
than neare the Nose; As hath beene partly touched heretofore.Experiments in Consort, touching Smells.
                      The
Cause is double: First the finer Mixture, or Incorporation of the Smell:
For we see that in Sounds likewise, they are Sweetest, when we cannot 
heare euery Part by it selfe. The other Reason is, for that all Sweet
Smells haue ioyned with them, some Earthy or Crude Odours; And at
some distance the Sweet, which is the more Spirituall, is Perceiued; And
the Earthy reacheth not so farre.
                  
                     Sweet Smells are most forcible, in Dry Substances, when they are 
                     Broken; And so likewise in Orenges, or Limons, the Nipping of their
Rinde, giueth out their Smell more: And generally, when Bodies are
Moued or Stirred, though not Broken, they Smell more; As a SweetBagge
waued. The Cause is double: The one, for that there is a Greater
Emission of the Spirit, when Way is made: And this holdeth in the
Breaking, Nipping, or Crushing; It holdeth also, (in some Degree) in the
Mouing: But in this last, there is a Con
                        •
                     urrence of the Second Cause;
Which is the Impulsion of the Aire, that bringeth the Sent faster vpon
vs.
                  The daintiest Smells of Flowers, are out of those Plants, whose Leaues
                     
                     
                     smell not; As Violets, Roses, Wall-flowers, Gilly-flowers, Pinckes, Woodbines,
Vine-flowers, Apple-Bloomes, Lime-Tree Bloomes, Beane-Bloomes, &amp;c.
The Cause is, for that where there is Heat and strength enough in the
Plant, to make the Leaues Odorate, there the Smell of the Flower is rather
Euanide and Weaker, than that of the Leaues; As it is in Rose-Mary-Flowers,
Lauender-Flowers, and Sweet-Briar-Roses. But where there
is lesse Heat, there the Spirit of the Plant, is disgested and refined, and
feuered from the Grosser Iuyce, in the Esstorescence, and not before.
                  
                      Most Odours Smell best, Broken or Crusht, as hath beene said; But
Flowers Pressed or Beaten, doe leese the Freshnesse and Sweetnesse of
their Odour. The Cause is, for that when they are Crushed, the Grosser
and more Earthy Spirit commeth out with the Finer, and troubleth it;
Whereas in stronger Odours there are no such Degrees of the Issue of
the Smell.
                  
                  It is a Thing of very good Vse, to Discouer the Goodnesse of Waters,
                     Experiments in Consort touching the Goodnesse and Choice of Water.
                     
The Taste, to those that Drinke Water onely, doth somewhat: But other
Experiments are more sure.
First, try Waters by Weight; Wherein you
may finde some difference, though not much: And the Lighter you
 may account the Better.
                  
                      Secondly, try them by Boyling vpon an Equall Fire: And that which
consumeth away fastest, you may account the Best.
                  
                      Thirdly, try them in Seuerall Bottles, or Open Vessels, Matches in
euery Thing else, and see which of them Last Longest, without Stench,
or Corruption. And that which holdeth Vnputrified longest, you may
likewise account the Best.
                  
                      Fourthly, try them by Making Drinkes Stronger, or Smaller, with
the same Quantity of Mault; And you may conclude, that that Water,
which maketh the Stronger Drinke, is the more Concocted, and Nou-rishing;
though perhaps it be not so good for Medicinall vse. And such
Water (commonly) is the Water of Large and Nanigable Riuers: And likewise
in Large and Cleane Ponds of Standing Water: For vpon both them,
the Sunne hath more power, than vpon Fountaines, or Small Riuers.
And I concelue that Chalke-water is next them the best, for going
furthest
in Drinke: For that also helpeth Concoction; So it be out of a Deepe
Well; For then it Cureth the Rawnesse of the Water; But Chalkie Water,
towards the Top of the Earth, is too fretting; As it appeareth in Laundry
of Cloaths, which weare out apace, if you vse such Waters.
                  
                  
                      Fifthly, The Houswiues doe finde a Difference in Waters, for the
Bearing, or Not Bearing of Soape: And it is likely that the more Fat Water
will beare Soape best; For the Hungry Water doth kill the Vnctuous
Nature of the Soape.
                  
                  
                      Sixthly, you may make a Iudgement of Waters, according to the
Place, whence they Spring, or Come: The Rain-Water is, by the Physitians,
esteemed the Finest, and the best; But yet it is said to putrifie soonest;
which is likely, because of the Finenesse of the Spirit: And in Conseruatories
                     
of Raine-water, (such as they haue in Venice, &amp;c.) they are
and not so Choice waters; The worse, (perhaps,) because they are
Couered aloft, and kept from the Sunne. Snow-water is held vnwholesome;
In so much as the People, that dwell at the Foot of the SnowMountaines, or otherwise vpon the Ascent, (especially the Women,) by
drinking of Snow-water, haue great Bagges hanging vnder their
Throats. Well-water, except it be vpon Chalke, or a very plentifull
Spring, maketh Meat Red; which is an ill Signe. Springs on the Tops
of High-Hills are the best: For both they seeme to haue a Lightnesse,
and Appetite of Mounting; And besides they are most pure and Vnmingled;
And againe are more Percolated thorow a great Space of
Earth. For Waters in Valleyes, ioyne in effect vnder Ground with all
Waters of the same Leuell; Whereas Springs, on the Tops of Hills,
passe thorow a great deale of Pure Earth, with lesse Mixture of other
Waters.
                  
                  Seuenthly, Iudgement may be made of Waters by the Soyle whereupon 
the Water runneth; As Pebble is the Cleanest, and best tasted; And
next to that Clay-water; And Thirdly, Water vpon Chalke; Fourthly
that vpon Sand; And Worst of all vpon Mudde. Neither may you
trust Waters that Taste Sweet, For they are commonly found in Rising
Grounds of great Cities; which must needs take in a great deale
of Filth.
                  In Peru, and diuers Parts of the West Indies, though vnder the Line,
the Heats are not so Intolerable, as they be in Barbary, and the Skirts
of the Torrid Zone.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Temperate Heat vnder the AEquinoctiall.
                     
The Causes are, First the Great Brizes, which the
Motion of the Aire in great Circles, (such as are vnder the Girdle
of the World,) produceth; Which doe refrigerate; And therefore 
in those Parts Noone is nothing so hot, when the Brizes
are great, as about Nine or Ten of the Clocke in the Fore-Noone.
Another Cause is, for that the Length of the Night, and the Dewes
thereof, doe compense the Heat of the Day. A third Cause is the
Stay of the Sunne; Not in Respect of Day and Night, (for that
wee spake of before,) but in Respect of the Season; For vnder the
Line, the Sunne crosseth the Line, and maketh two Summers, and two
Winters; But in the Skirts of the Torrid Zone, it doubleth, and goeth
backe againe, and so maketh one Long Summer.
                  The Heat of the Sunne maketh Men Blacke in some Countries,
as in AEthiopia, and Ginny, &amp;c.Experiment Solitary, touching the Coloration of Blacke and Tawney Moores.
                      
                     Fire doth it not, as wee see in GlasseMen,
that are continually about the Fire. The Reason may be, because
Fire doth licke vp the Spirits, and Bloud of the Body, so as
they Exhale; So that it euer maketh Men looke Pale, and Sallow;
But the Sunne, which is a Gentler Heat, doth but draw the Bloud 
                     
to the Outward Parts; And rather Concooteth it, than Soaketh it;
And therefore wee see that all AEthiapes are Fleshy, and Plumpe,
and haue great Lips; All which betoken Moisture retained, and not
drawne out. Wee see also, that the Negroes are bred in Countries
that haue Plenty of Water, by Riuers, or otherwise: For Meroe,
which was the Metropolis of AEthiopia, was vpon a great Lake: And
Congo, where the Negroes are, is full of Riuers. And the Confines
of the Riuer Niger, where the Negroes also are, are well watered:
And the Region about Capo Verde, is likewise Moist, in so much as
it is pestilent through Moisture: But the Countries of the Abyssenes,
and Barbary, and Peru. where they are Tawney, and Oliuaster, and
Pale, are generally more Sandy, and Dry. As for the AEthiopes,
as they are Plumpe, and Fleshy; So (it may bee) they are Sanguine,
and ruddy Coloured, if their blacke Skinne would suffer it
to be seene.
                  Some Creatures doe moue a good while after their Head is off;
As Birds; Some a very little time; As Men, and all beasts; Some
moue, though cut in feuerall Pieces; As Snakes, Eeles, Wormes,
Flies, &amp;c.Experiment Solitary touching Motion after the Inflant of Death.
                      First therefore it is certaine, that the Immediate Cause
                      of Death, is the Resolution or Extinguishment of the Spirits; And
that the Destruction or Corruption of the Organs, is but the Mediate
Cause. But some Organs are so peremptorily necessary, that the
Extinguishment of the Spirits doth speedily follow; But yet so, as
there is an Interim of a Small Time. It is reported by one of the
Ancients, of credit, that a Sacrificed Beast hath lowed, after the Heart
hath beene feuered; And it is a Report also of Credit, that the
Head of a Pigge hath beene opened, and the Braine put into the
Palme of a Mans hand, trembling, without breaking any part of it,
or feuering it from the Marrow of the Back-bone; During which
time the Pigge hath beene, in all appearance, starke dead, and without
Motion; And after a small Time the Braine hath beene replaced,
and the Skull of the Pigge closed, and the Pigge hath a little
after gone about. And certaine it is, that an Eye vpon Reuenge
hath beene thrust forth, so as it hanged a pretty distance by the Visuall
Nerue; And during that time the Eye hath beene without any
Power of Sight; And yet after (being replaced) recouered Sight.
Now the Spirits are chiefly in the Head, and Cells of the Braine
which in Men, and Beasts are Large; And therefore, when the Head
is off, they moue little or Nothing. But Birds haue small Heads,
and therefore the Spirits are a little more dispersed in the Sinewes,
whereby Motion remaineth in them a little longer; In so much as
it is Extant in Story, that an Emperour of Rome, to shew the Certainty
of his Hand, did Shoote a great Forked Arrow at an Estrich,
as shee ranne swiftly vpon the Stage, and strooke off her Head;

And yet shee continued the Race, a little way, with the Head off.
As for Wormes, and Flies, and Eeles, the Spirits are diffused almost
all ouer; And therefore they moue in
their Seuerall Pieces.

                  WE will now enquire of Plants or Vegetables:
And we shall doe it with diligence.Experiments in Consort, touching the Acceleration of Germination.
                     
They are the principall Part
of the Third Dayes Worke. They are
the first Producat, which is the Word
of Animation: For the other Words
are but the Words of Essence; And
they are of excellent and generall Vse,
for Food, Medicine, and a Number of Mechanicall Arts.
                  There were sowen in a Bed, Turnip-Seed, Radish-Seed, Wheat, Cucumber-Seed,
                     
and Pease. The Bed we call a Hot-Bed, and the Manner of it is
this. There was taken Horse-dung, old, and well rotted; This was laid
vpon a Banke, halfe a foot high, and supported round about with Planks;
And vpon the Top was cast Sifted Earth, some two Fingers deepe; And
then the Seed Sprinkled vpon it, hauing beene steeped all night in Water
Mixed with Cow dung. The Turnip-Seed, and the Wheat came vp halfe
an Inch aboue Ground, within two dayes after, without any Watring.
The Rest the third day. The Experiment was made in October; And (it
may be) in the Spring, the Accelerating would haue beene the speedier.
This is a Noble Experiment; For without this helpe, they would haue

beene foure times as long in comming vp. But there doth not occurre to
me, at this present, any vse thereof, for profit; Except it should be for
Sowing of Pease; which haue their Price very much increased, by the
early Comming. It may be tried also with Cherries, Strawberries, and
other Fruit, which are dearest, when they come early.
                  
                      There was Wheat, steeped in Water mixed with Cow-Dung; Other in
Water mixed with Horse-Dung; Other in Water mixed with Pigeon-Dung;
Other in Vrine of Man; Other in Water mixed with Chalke powdred;
Other in Water mixed with Soot; Other in Water mixed with Ashes;
Other in Water mixed with Bay-Salt; Other in Claret Wine; Other in
Malmsey; Other in Spirìt of Wine. The Proportion of the Mixture was,
a fourth Part of the Ingredients to the Water; Saue that there was not of
the Salt aboue an eighth Part. The Vrine, and Wines, and Spirit of Wine,
were Simple without Mixture of Water. The Time of the Steeping was
twelue houres. The Time of the Yeare October. There was also other
Wheat sowen vnsteeped, but watred twice a day with Warme water. There
was also other Wheat sowen Simple to compare it with the rest. The
Euent was; That those that were in the Mixture of Dung, and Vrine, and
Soot, Chalke, Ashes, and Salt, came vp within fix dayes: And those that
afterwards proued the Highest, Thickest, and most Lustie, were; First
the Vrine; And then the Dungs, Next the Chalke; Next the Soot; Next
the Ashes; Next the Salt; Next the Wheat Simple of it selfe, vnsteeped,
and vnwatered; Next the Watered twice a day with warme water; Next
the Claret Wine. So that these three last were slower than the ordinary
Wheat of it selfe; And this Culture did rather retard, than aduance. As
for those that were steeped in Malmsey, and Spirit of Wine, they came not
vp at all. This is a Rich Experiment for Profit; For the most of the Steel
pings are Cheape Things; And the Goodnesse of the Crop is a great
Matter of Gaine; If the Goodnesse of the Crop answer the Earlinesse of
the Comming vp: As it is like it will; Both being from the vigour of the
Seed; Which also partly appeared in the Former Experiments, as hath
beene said. This Experiment would be tried in other Graines, Seeds, and
Kernells: For it may be some Steeping will agree best with some Seeds.
It would be tried also with Roots steeped as before, but for longer time.
It would be tried also in Seuerall Seasons of the yeare, especially the
Spring.
                  
                  
                     
                     Strawberries watered now and then, (as once in three dayes,) with
Water, wherein hath beene steeped Sheepes-dung, or Pigeons-dong, will
preuent and come early. And it is like, the same Effect would follow in
other Berries, Herbs, Flowers, Graines, or Trees. And therefore it is an
Experiment, though vulgar in Strawberries, yet not brought into vse
generally: For it is vsuall to helpe the Ground with Mucke; And likewise
to Recomfort it sometimes with Mucke put to the Roots; But to
water it with Mucke water, which is like to be more Forcible, is not practised.
                  
                     
                     Dung, or Chalke, or Bloud, applied in Substance, (seasonably,) to the

Roots of Trees, doth set them forwards. But to doe it vnto Herbs,
without Mixture of Water or Earth, it may be these Helpes are too
Hot.
                  The former Meanes of Helping Germination, are either by the Goodnesse
                     
and Strength of the Nourishment; Or by the Comforting, and Exciting
the Spirits in the Plant, to draw the Nourishment better. And of
this latter kinde, concerning the Comforting of the Spirits of the Plant,
arealso the experiments that follow; Though they be not Applications
to the Root, or Seed. The Planting of Trees warme vpon a Wall, against
the South, or South-East Sunne, doth hasten their Comming on, and
Ripening; And the South-East is found to be better than the SouthWest,
though the South-West be the Hotter Coast. But the cause is
chiefly, for that the Heat of the Morning succeedeth the Cold of the
Night: and partly, because (many times) the South-west Sunne is too
Parching. So likewise the Planting of them vpon the Backe of a Chimney,
where a Fire is kept, doth hasten their Comming on, and Ripening:
Nay more, the Drawing of the Boughes into the Inside of a Roome, where
a Fire is continually kept, worketh the same Effect; Which hath beene
tried with Grapes; In so much as they will come a Moneth earlier, than
the Grapes abroad.
                  Besides the two Meanes of Accelerating Germination, formerly described; 
That is to say, the Mending of the Nourishment; and Comforting of
the Spirit of the Plant; there is a Third; Which is the Making way for
the Easie Comming to the Nourishment, and Drawing it. And therefore
Gentle Digging and Loosening of the Earth about the Roots of Trees; And
the Remening Herbs and Flowers into new Earth, once in two yeares,
(which is the same thing, For the new Earth is euer looser,) doth greatly
further the Prospering, and Earlinesse of Plants.
                  
                  But the most admirable Acceleration by Facilitating the Nourishment,
                     
is that of Water. For a Standard of a Damaske Rose with the Root on,
was set in a Chamber, where no Fire was, vpright in an Earthen Pan,
full of Faire Water, without any Mixture, halfe a foot vnder the Water,
the Standard being more then two foot high aboue the Water: Within
the Space of ten dayes, the Standard did put forth a faire Greene lease,
and some other little Buds, which stood at a stay, without any Shew of
decay or withering, more then seuen Daies. But afterwards that Leafe
faded, but the young Buds did sprout on; which afterward opened into
faire Leaues, in the space of three Moneths; And continued so a while
after, till vpon Remouall wee left the Triall. But note that the Leaues
were somewhat paler, and lighter-coloured, than the Leaues vse to be
abroad. Note that the first Buds were in the End of October; And it is
likely that if it had beene in the Spring time, it would haue put forth
with greater strength, and (it may be) to haue growne on to beare
Flowers. By this Meanes, you may haue, (as it seemeth,) Roses set in
the middest of a Poole, being supported with some stay; Which is Matter
of Rarenesse and Pleasure, though of small Vse. This is the more

strange, for that the like Rose-Standard was put, at the same time, into Water,
mixed with Horse-dung, the Horse-dung about the fourth Part to the
Water, and in foure Moneths space (while it was obserued) put not forth
any Leafe, though diuers Buds at the first, as the other.
                  
                      A Dutch Flower, that had a Bulbous Root, was likewise put, at the
same time, all vnder Water, some two or three Fingers deepe; And
within seuen dayes sprouted, and continued long after, further Growing.
There were also put in, a Beet-Root, a Borrage-Root, and a RaddishRoot,
which had al their Leaues cut almost close to the Roots; And within
six weekes had faire Leaues; And so continued, till the end of Nouember.
                  
                  
                      Note that if Roots, or Pease, or Flowers, may be Accelerated in their
Comming and Ripening, there is a double Profit; The one in the high
Price that those Things beare when they come early: The other in the
Swiftnesse of their Returnes: For in some Grounds which are strong,
you shall haue a Raddish, &amp;c. come in a Month; That in other Grounds
will not come in two; And so make double Returnes.
                  
                  
                     
                     Wheat also was put into the Water, and came not forth at all; So as
it seemeth there must be some Strength and Bulke in the Body, put into
the Water, as it is in Roots; For Graines, or Seeds, the Cold of the Water
will mortifie. But casually some Wheat lay vnder the Pan, which was
somewhat moistned by the Suing of the Pan; which in six weekes (as aforesaid)
looked mouldy to the Eye, but it was sprouted forth halfe a
Fingers length.
                  
                      It seemeth by these Instances of Water, that for Nourishment, the
Water is almost all in all, and that the Earth doth but keepe the Plant vpright,
and saue it from Ouer-heat, and Ouer-cold; And therefore is a
Comfortable Experiment for good Drinkers. It proueth also that our
former Opinion; That Drinke incorporate with Flesh, or Roots, (as in
Capon-Baere, &amp;c.) will nourish more easily, than Meat and Drinke taken
seuerally.
                  
                      The Nousing of Plants (I conceiue) will both Accelerate Germination,
and bring forth Flowers and Plants in the Colder Seasons: And as wee
House Hot-Countrey Plants, as Limons, Orenges, Myrtles, to saue them; So
we may House our owne Countrey Plants, to forward them, and make
them come in the Cold Seasons; In such sort, that you may haue Violets,
Strawberries, Pease, all Winter: So that you sow, or remoue them
at fit times. This Experiment is to be referred vnto the Comforting of the
Spirit of the Plant, by Warmth, as well as Housing their Boughes, &amp;c. So
then the Meanes, to Accelerate Germination, are in Particular eight, in
Generall three.
                  To make Roses, or other Flowers come late, it is an Experiment of
Pleasure.Experiments in Consort, touching the Putting backe or Retardation of Germination.
                      For the Ancients esteemed much of Rosa Sera. And indeed
the Nouember-Rose is the sweetest, hauing beene lesse exhaled by the
Sunne. The Meanes are these. First, the Cutting off their Tops, immediately
 after they haue done Bearing; And then they will come againe

the same yeare about Nouember: But they will not come iust on the
Tops, where they were cut, but out of those Shoots, which were as it
were,) Water-Boughes. The Cause is, for that the Sap, which otherwise
would haue fed the Top, (though after Bearing,) will, by the discharge
of that, diuert vnto the Side-Sprouts; And they will come to beare,
but later.
                  The Second is the Pulling off the Buds of the Rose, when they are 
                     Newly knotted; For then the Side-Branches will beare. The Cause is the
same with the former: For Cutting off the Tops, and Pulling off the Buds,
worke the same Effect, in Retention of the Sap for a time, and Diuersion
of it to the Sprouts, that were not so forward.
                  The Third is the Cutting off some few of the Top-Roughes in the 
                     Spring-time, but suffering the lower Boughes to grow on. The Cause is,
for that the Boughes doe helpe to draw vp the Sap more strongly; And
we see that in Powling of Trees, many doe vse to leaue a Bough or two
on the Top, to helpe to draw vp the Sap. And it is coparated also, that
if you graft vpon the Bough of a Tree, and cut off some of the old
Boughes, the new Cions will perish.
                  The Fourth is by Laying the Roots bare about christmus, some dayes.
The Cause is plaine, for that it doth

                      the Sap, from going vpwards,

Root a gaine with Earth; And then the Sap getteth vp, but later.

                  The Sixth is the Grasting of Kaser in May, which commonly Gardiners 
doe not till Inly; And then they beare not till the Next Yeare;
But if you graft them in May, they will beare the same yeare, but
late.
                  The Seuenth is, the Girding of the Body of the Tree about with some 
Pack-threed; For that also, in a degree, restraineth the Sap, and maketh
it come vp, more late, and more Slowly.

                  Men haue entertained a Conceit that sheweth prettily; Namely,
that if you grast a Late Comming Fruit, vpon a Stocke of a Fruit-tree that

                        
                           ••••••
                         early, the Graft will beare Fruit Early. At a Peach vpon a Cherry;
And contrariwise, if an Early-Comming Fruit vpon a Stocke of a
Fruit-Tree that Commeth late, the Grafe will beare Fruit late; As a Cherry
vpon a Peach. But these are but Imaginations, and vntrue. The Cause
is, for that the Cions ouerroleth the Stocke quite; And the Stocke is
but Passue onely, and giueth Aliment, but no Motion to the Graft.

Wherein there is no doubt, but the former Experiments of Acceleration,
will serue much to these Purposes. And againe, that
these Experiments, which we shall now set downe, doe serue
also for Acceleration; because both Effects proceed from the
Encrease of vigour in the Tree, But yet to auoid Confusion;
And because some of the Meanes are more proper for the
one Effect, and some for the other, wee will handle them
apart.
                  
                      It is an assured Experience, that an Heape of flint, or Stone, laid
about the Bottome of a Wilde-Tree, (as an Oake, Elme, Ash, &amp;c.) vpon
the first Planting, doth make it prosper double as much, as without it.
The Cause is, for that it retaineth the Moisture, which falleth at any time
vpon the Tree, and suffereth it not to be exhaled by the Sunne. Againe,
it keepeth the Tree warme, from Cold Blasts and Frosts, as it were in
an House. It may be also, there is somewhat in the Keeping of it steady
at the first. Quare, if Laying of Straw some Height about the Body of a
Tree, will not make the Tree forwards. For though the Root giueth the
Sap, yet it is the Body that draweth it. But you must note, that if you
lay Stones about the stalke of Lettuce, or other Plants, that are more
soft, it will ouer-moisten the Roots, so as the Wormes will eat them.
                  
                      A Tree, at the first Setting, should not be Shaken, vntill it hath taken
Root fully: And therefore some haue, put two little Forkes about the
Bottome of their Trees, to keepe them vpright; But after a yeares Rooting,
then Shaking doth the Tree good, by Loosening of the Earth,
and (perhaps) by Exercising (as it were) and Stirring the Sap of the
Tree.
                  
                  
                      Generally, the Cutting away of Boughes and Suckers at the Root and
Body, doth make Trees grow high; And contrariwise, the Powling and
Cutting of the Top, maketh them grow spread, and bushy. As wee see
in Pollards, &amp;c.
                  
                      It is reported, that to make hasty Growing Coppice-Woods, the way is,
to take Willow, Sallow, Poplar, Alder, of some seuen yeares growth;
And to set them, not vpright, but a-slope, a reasonable depth vnder the
Ground; And then, instead of one Root, they will put forth many, and
so carry more Shoots vpon a Stemme.
                  
                      When you would haue many new Roots of Fruit-trees, take a Low
Tree, and bow it, and lay all his Branches a-flat vpon the Ground, and
cast Earth vpon them; And euery Twigge will take Root. And this is a
very profitable Experiment for Costly Trees; (for the Boughtes will make

Stockes without charge;) Such as are Apricots, Peaches, Almonds, Cornelians,
Mulberries, Figs, &amp;c. The like is continually practised with Vines,
Roses, Muske-Roses, &amp;c.
                  From May to Iuly you may take off the Barke of any Bough, being of 
the Bignesse of three or foure Inches, and couer the bare Place, somewhat
aboue, and below, with Loame well tempered with Horse-dung,
binding it fast downe. Then cut off the Bough about Alhollontide in the
bare place, and set it in the Ground; And it will grow to be a faire Tree
in one Yeare. The Cause may be, for that the Baring from the Barke
keepeth the Sap from descending towards Winter, and so holdeth it in
the Bough; And it may be also that the Loame and Horse-Dung applied
to the bare place, doe moisten it, and cherish it, and make it more
apt to put forth the Root. Note, that this may be a generall Meanes
for keeping vp the Sap of Trees in their Boughes; Which may serue to
other Effects.
                  It hath beene practised in Trees, that shew faire, and beare not, to 
                     Bore a Hole thorow the Heart of the Tree, and thereupon it will beare.
Which may be for that the Tree before had too much Repletion, and was
oppressed with his owne Sap; For Repletion is an Enemy to Generation.
                  It hath beene practised in Trees, that doe not beare, to cleaue two 
or three of the Chiese Roots, and to put into the Cleft a small Pebble,
which may keepe it open, and then it will beare. The Cause may be, for
that a Root of a Tree may be (as it were,) Hide-bound, no lesse than the
Body of the Tree; But it will not keepe open without somewhat put
into it.
                  It is vsually practised, to set Trees that require much Sunne, vpon 
                     Walls against the South; As Apricots, Peaches, Plums, Vines, Figs, and the
like. It hath a double Commodity; The one, the Heat of the Wall by
Reflexion; The other, the Taking away of the Shade; For when a Tree
groweth round, the vpper Boughes ouer-shadow the lower; But when
it is spread vpon a Wall, the Sunne commeth alike, vpon the vpper, and
lower Branches.
                  It hath also beene practised (by some) to pull off some Leanes from 
the Trees so spread, that the Sunne may come vpon the Bough and Fruit
the better. There hath beene practised also a Curiosity, to set a Tree
vpon the North-Side of a Wall, and at a little height, to draw him thorow
the Wall, and spread him vpon the South-Side: Conceiuing that
the Root and lower Part of the Stocke should enioy the Freshnesse of
the Shade; And the Vpper Boughes, and Fruit, the Comsort of the
Sunne. But it sorted not; The Cause is, for that the Root requireth some
Comsort from the Sunne, though vnder Earth, as well as the Body:
And the Lower Part of the Body more than the Vpper, as wee see in
Compassing a Tree below with Straw.
                  The Lownesse of the Bough, where the Fruit commeth, maketh the 
                     Fruit greater, and to ripen better; For you shall euer see in Apricots,

Peaches, or Melo-Cotones, vpon a wall, the greatest Fruits towards the
Bottome. And in France the Grapes that make the Wine, grow vpon low
Vines, bound to small Stakes. And the raised Vines in Arbours make
but Veriuyce. It is true, that in Italy, and other Countries, where they
haue hotter Sunne, they raise them vpon Elmes, and Trees; But I conceiue,
that if the French Manner of Planting low, were brought in vse
there, their Wines would be stronger and sweeter. But it is more chargeable
in respect of the Props. It were good to try whether a Tree grafted
somewhat neare the Ground, and the lower boughes onely maintained,
and the higher continually proined off, would not make a larger
Fruit.
                  
                  
                      To haue Fruit in Greater Plenty, the way is, to graft, not onely vpon
young Stockes, but vpon diuers Boughes of an old Tree; for they will
beare great Numbers of Fruit; Whereas if you graft but vpon one
Stocke, the Tree can beare but few.
                  
                      The Digging yearely about the Roots of Trees, which is a great means,
both to the Acceleration and Melioration of Fruits, is practised in nothing
but in Vines; Which if it were transferred vnto other Trees, and Shrubs,
(as Roses, &amp;c.) I conceiue would aduance them likewise.
                  
                      It hath beene knowne, that a Fruit-Tree hath beene blowne vp (almost)
by the Roots, and set vp againe, and the next yeare bare exceedingly.
The Cause of this, was nothing but the Looseming of the Earth,
which comforteth any Tree, and is fit to be practised, more than it is, in
Fruit-Trees: For Trees cannot be so fitly remoued into New Grounds,
as Flowers and Herbs may.
                  
                      To reuiue an Old Tree, the Digging of it about the Roots, and Applying
new Mould to the Roots, is the way. We see also that DraughtOxen,
put into fresh Pasture, gather new and tender Flesh; And in all
Things, better Nourishment than hath beene vsed, doth helpe to renew;
Especially, if it be not onely better, but changed, and differing
from the former.
                  
                      If an Herbe be cut off from the Roots, in the beginning of Winter,
and then the Earth be troden and beaten downe hard, with the Foot
and Spade, the Roots will become of very great Magnitude in Summer.
The Reason is, for that the Moisture being forbidden to come vp in the
Plant, stayeth longer in the Root, and so dilateth it. And Gardiners vse
to tread downe any loose Ground, after they haue sowne Onions, or
Turnips, &amp;c.
                  
                      If Panicum be laid below, and about the Bottome of a Root, it will
cause the Root to grow to an Excessiue Bignesse. The Cause is, for that
being it selfe of a Spungy Substance, it draweth the Moisture of the
Earth to it, and so feedeth the Root. This is of greatest vse for Onions, Turnips, Parsnips, and Carrets.
                  
                  
                      The Shifting of Ground is a Meanes to better the Tree, and Fruit;
But with this Caution; That all Things doe prosper best, when they are
aduanced to the better: Your Nursery of Stockes ought to be in a more

Barren Ground, than the Ground is whereunto you remoue them.
So all Grasiers preferre their Cattell from meaner Pastures to better.
We see also, that Hardnesse in Youth lengthneth Life, because it leaueth
a Cherishing to the better, of the Body, in Age: Nay in Exercises,
it is good to begin with the hardest, as Dancing in Thicke
Shooes, &amp;c.
                  It hath beene obserued, that Hacking of Trees in their Barke, both 
downe-right, and acrosse, so as you make them rather in slices, than
in continued Hacks, doth great good to Trees; And especially deliuereth
them from being Hide-bound, and killeth their Mosse.
                  
                     Shade to some Plants conduceth to make them large, and prosperous,
more than Sun; As in Strawberries, and Bayes, &amp;c. Therefore amongst
Strawberries, sow here and there some Barrage-Seed; And you shall
finde the Strawberries vnder those Leaues farro more large than their
Fellowes. And Bayes you must plant to the North; Or defond them
from the Sunne by a Hedge-Row; And when you sow the Berries, weed
not the Borders, for the first halfe yeare; For the Weed giueth them
Shade.
                  
                  To increase the Crops of Ph
                           •••
                        , there would be considered, not only 
the Increasing the Lust of the Earth, or of the Plant, but the Sauing also
of that which is spilt. So they haue lately made a Triall, to Set Wheat;
which neuerthelesse hath beene left off, because of the trouble and
paines; Yet so much is true, that there is much saued by the Setting, in
comparison of that which is Sewen; Both by keeping it from being
picked vp by Birds; And by Auoiding the Shallow lying of it, whereby
much that is sowen taketh no Root.
                  It is prescribed by some of the Ancients, that you take Small Trees,
                     
vpon which Figs or other Fruit grow, being yet vnripe, and couer the
Trees in the Middle of Autamne with dung, vntill the Spring; And
then take them vp in a warme day, and replant them in good Ground;
And by that meanes, the former yeares Tree will be ripe, as by a new
Birth; when other Trees of the fame kinde, doe but blossome. But this
seemeth to haue no great Probabilitie.
                  It is reported, that if you take Nitre, and mingle it with Water, to the 
thicknesse of Honey, and therewith anoint the Bud, after the Vine is cut,
it will sprout forth within eight dayes. The Cause is like to be, (if the
Experiment be true,) the Opening of the Bud, and of the Parts Contiguous,
by the Spirit of the Nitre; For Nitre is (as it were) the Life of
Vegetables.
                  
                  Take Seed, or Kernells of Apples, Peares, Orenges; Or a Peach, or a 
                     Plum Stone, &amp;c. And put them into a Squill, (which is like a great
Onion,) and they will come vp much earlier than in the Earth it selfe.
This I conceiue no be as a Kinde of Grafting in the Root; For as the
Stocke of a Graft yeeldeth better prepared Nourishment to the Graft,
than the Crude Earth; So the Squill doth the like to the Seed. And I
suppose the same would be done, by Putting Kernells into a Turnip, or

the like; Saue that the Squill is more Vigorous, and Hot. It may be
tried also, with putting Onion-Seed into an Onion-Head, which thereby
(perhaps) will bring forth a larger, and earlier Onion.
                  
                  
                      The Pricking of a Fruit in seuerall places, when it is almost at his Bignesse,
and before it ripeneth, hath beene practised with successe, to ripen
the Fruit more suddenly. Wee see the Example of the Biting of
Waspes, or Wormes, vpon Fruit, whereby it (manifestly) ripeneth the
sooner.
                  
                      It is reported, that Alga Marina (Sea-weed) put vnder the Roots of
Coleworts, and (perhaps) of other Plants, will further their Growth.
The vertue (no doubt) hath Relation to Salt, which is a great Helpe
to Fertilitie.
                  
                      It hath beene practised, to cut off the Stalkes of Cucumbers, immediately
after their Bearing, close by the Earth; And then to cast a prettie
Quantitie of Earth vpon the Plant that remaineth; and they will
beare the next yeare Fruit, long before the ordinary time. The Cause
may be, for that the Sap goeth downe the sooner, and is not spent in
the Stalke or Lease, which remaineth after the Fruit. Where note,
that the Dying, in the winter, of the Roots of Plants, that are Annuall,
seemeth to be partly caused by the Ouer-Expence of the Sap into
Stalke, and Leaues; which being preuented, they will super-annate,
if they stand warme.
                  
                      The Pulling off many of the Blossomes from a Fruit-Tree, doth make
the Fruit fairer. The Cause is manifest; For that the Sap hath the lesse
to nourish. And it is a Common Experience, that if you doe not pull
off some Blossomes, the first time a Tree bloometh, it will blossome it
selfe to death.
                  
                      It were good to trie, what would be the Effect, if all the Blossomes
were pulled from a Fruit-Tree; Or the Acornes and Chesnut-buds, &amp;c.
from a Wilde Tree, for two yeares together. I suppose that the Tree
will either put forth, the third yeare, bigger, and more plentifull Fruit;
Or else, the same yeares, larger Leaues, because of the Sap stored vp.
                  
                      It hath beene generally receiued, that a Plant Watered with Warme
Water, will come vp sooner and better, than with Cold Water, or with
Showers. But our Experiment of Watering Wheat with Warme Water
(as hath beene said) succeeded not; which may be, because the Triall
was too late in the Yeare, vix. in the End of October. For the Cold
then comming vpon the Seed, after it was made more tender by the
Warme Water, might checke it.
                  
                      There is no doubt, but that Grafting (for the most Part) doth meliorate
the Fruit. The Cause is manifest; For that the Nourishment is better
prepared in the Stocke, than in the Crude Earth: But yet note well,
that there be some Trees, that are said to come vp more happily from
the Kernell, than from the Graft; As the Peach, and Melocotone. The
Cause I suppose to he, for that those Plants require a Nourishment of
great Moisture; And though the Nourishment of the Stocke be finer,

and better prepared, yet it is not so moist, and plentifull, as the Nourishment
of the Earth. And indeed we see those Fruits are very Cold
Fruits in their Nature.
                  It hath beene receiued, that a Smaller Peare, grafted vpon a Stocke
                     
that beareth a greater Peare, will become Great. But I thinke it is as
true, as that of the Prime-Fruit vpon the Late Stocke; And è conuerso;
which we reiected before: For the Cions will gouerne. Neuerthelesse
it is probable enough, that if you can get a Cions to grow vpon a Stocke
of another kinde, that is much moister than his owne Stocke, it may
make the Fruit Greater, because it will yeeld more plentifull nourishment;
Though it is like it will make the Fruit Baser. But generally, the
Grafting is vpon a dryer Stock; As the Apple vpon a Crab; The Peare vpon
a Thorne; &amp;c. Yet it is reported, that in the Low-Conntries they will
graft an Apple-Cions vpon the Stocke of a Colewort, and it will beare a
great flaggy Apple: The Kernell of which, if it be set, will be a Colewort,
and not an Apple. It were good to try, whether an Apple-Cions will prosper,
if it be grafted vpon a Sallow, or vpon a Poplar, or vpon an Alder,
or vpon an Elme, or vpon an Horse-Plumme, which are the moistest of
Trees. I haue heard that it hath beene tryed vpon an Elme, and succeeded.
                  It is manifest by Experience, that Flowers Remoued wax greater, because 
the Nourishment is more easily come by, in the loose Earth. It
may be, that Oft Regrafting of the same Cions, may likewise make Fruit
greater; As if you take a Cions, and graft it vpon a Stocke the first yeare;
And then cut it off, and graft it vpon another Stocke the second yeare;
and so for a third; Or fourth yeare; And then let it rest, it will yeeld
afterward, when it beareth, the greater Fruit.
                  
                  Of Grafting there are many Experiments worth the Noting, but those
we reserue to a proper Place.
                  It maketh Figs better, if a Fig-Tree, when it beginneth to put forth 
Leaues, haue his Top cut off. The Cause is plaine, for that the Sap hath
the lesse to seed, and the lesse way to mount: But it may be, the Figge
will come somewhat later, as was formerly touched. The same may be
tried likewise in other Trees.
                  
                  It is reported, that Mulberries will be fairer, and the Trees more 
fruitfull, if you bore the Truncke of the Tree thorow, in seuerall places,
and thrust into the Places bored, Wedges of some Hot Trees, as Turpentine,
Mastick-Tree, Guaiacum, Inniper, &amp;c. The Cause may be, for that Aduentiue
Heat doth cheare vp the Natiue Iuyce of the Tree.
                  
                  It is reported, that Trees will grow greater, and beare better Fruit,
                     
if you put Salt, or Lees of Wine, or Bloud to the Root. The Cause may be
the Encreasing the Lust or Spirit of the Root; These Things being more
forcible, than ordinary Composts.
                  
                  It is reported by one of the Ancients, that Artichoakes will be lesse 
prickly, and more tender; if the Seeds haue their Tops dulled, or grated
off vpon a Stone.
                  
                     
                     
                     Herbes will be tenderer, and fairer; if you take them out of Beds,
when they are newly come vp, and remoue them into Pots, with better
Earth. The Remoue from Bed to Bed was spoken of before; But that
was in seuerall yeares; This is vpon the sudden. The Cause is the same
with other Remoues, formerly mentioned.
                  
                     
                     Coleworts are reported by one of the Ancients, to prosper exceedingly,
and to be better tasted, if they be sometimes watred with Salt-Water;
And much more with Water mixed with Nitre; The Spirit of which is
lesse Adurent than Salt.
                  
                  
                      It is reported, that Cucumbers will proue more Tender, and Dainty,
if their Seeds be Steeped (a little) in Milke; The Cause may be, for that the
Seed being mollified with the Milke, will be too weake to draw the grosser
Iuyce of the Earth, but onely the finer. The same Experiment may
be made in Artichoakes, and other Seeds, when you would take away,
either their Flashinesse, or Bitternesse. They speake also, that the like
Effect followeth, of Steeping in Water mixed with Honey; But that seemeth
to me not so probable, because Honey hath too quicke a Spirit.
                  
                      It is reported that Cucumbers will be lesse Watry, and more Melonlike,
it in the Pit where you set them, you fill it (halfe way vp) with Chaffe,
or small Stickes, and then powre Earth vpon them; For Cucumbers, as it
seemeth, doe extremely affect Moisture; And ouer-drinke themselues;
Which this Chaffe, or Chips, forbiddeth. Nay it is further reported, that
if when a Cucumber is growne, you fet a Pot of water about fiue or six inches
distance from it, it will, in 24, houres, shoot so much out, as to
touch the Pot; Which if it be true, it is an Experiment of an higher Nature
than belongeth to this Title: For it discouereth Perception in Plants,
to moue towards that which should helpe and comfort them, though
it be at a distance. The ancient Tradition of the Vine is far more strange:
It is, that if you set a Stake, or Prop, some distance from it, it will grow
that way; Which is farre stranger (as is said) than the other; For that
Water may worke by a Sympathy of Attraction: But this of the Stake seemeth
to be a Reasonable Discourse.
                  
                      It hath beene touched before, that Terebration of Trees doth make
them prosper better. But it is found also, that it maketh the Fruit sweeter,
and better. The Cause is, for that notwithstanding the Terebration,
they may receiue Aliment sufficient; And yet no more than they can
well turne, and disgest; And withall doe sweat out the coursest and vnprofitablest
Iuyce; Euen as it is in Lining Creatures, which by Moderate
Feeding, and Exercise, and Sweat, attaine the soundest Habite of
Body.
                  
                      As Terebration doth Meliorate Fruit, so, vpon the like reason, doth
Letting of Plants Blond; As Pricking Vines, or other Trees, after they be
of some Growth; And thereby letting forth Gumme, or Teares; Though
this be not to continue, as it is in Terebration, but at some Seasons. And
it is reported, that by this Artifice, Bitter Almonds haue beene turned
into Sweet.
                  
                  
                     The Ancients for the Dulcorating of Fruit, doe commend SwinesDung
                     
aboue all other Dung; Which may be, because of the Moisture of
that Beast, whereby the Excrement hath lesse Acrimony; For wee see
Swines and Pigges Flesh is the Moistest of Fleshes.
                  It is obserued by some, that all Herbs wax sweeter, both in Smell 
and Taste, if after they be growne vp some reasonable time, they be cut,
and so you take the latter Sprout. The Cause may be, for that the longer
the Iuyce stayeth in the Root, and Stalke, the better it concocteth. For
one of the Chiefe Causes, why Graines, Seeds, and Fruits, are more Nourishing
than Leanes, is the Length of time, in which they grow to Maturation.
It were not amisse to keepe backe the Sap of Herbs, or the like,
by some fit meanes, till the end of Summer; whereby (it may be) they
will be more Nourishing.
                  As Grafting doth generally aduance and Meliorate Fruits, aboue that 
which they would be, if they were set of Kernells, or Stones, in regard
the Nourishment is better concocted; So (no doubt) euen in Grafting,
for the same cause, the Choise of the Stocke doth much; Alwayes prouided,
that it be somewhat inferiour to the Cions: For otherwise it dulleth
it. They commend much the Grafting of Peares, or Apples, vpon a
Quince.
                  
                  Besides the Meanes of Melioration of Fruits, before mentioned, it is 
set downe as tryed, that a Mixture of Bran, and Swines-Dung; Or Chaffe
and Swines-Dung; (especially laid vp together for a Moneth to rot,)
is a very great Nourisher, and Comforter to a Fruit-Tree.
                  
                  It is deliuered, that Onions wax greater, if they be taken out of the 
Earth, and laid a drying twenty dayes, and then set againe; And yet
more, if the outermost Pill be taken off all ouer.
                  It is deliuered by some, that if one take the Bough of a Low Fruittree,
                     
newly budded, and draw it gently, without hurting it, into an
Earthen Pot perforate at the bottome to let in the Plant, and then Couer
the Pot with Earth, it will yeeld a very large Fruit, within the
Ground. Which Experiment is Nothing but Potting of Plants, without
Remouing, and Leauing the Fruit in the Earth. The like, (they say,)
will be effected, by an Empty Pot without Earth in it, put ouer a Fruit,
being propped vp with a Stake, as it hangeth vpon the Tree; And the
better, if some few Pertusions be made in the Pot. Wherein, besides
the Defending of the Fruit, from Extremity of Sunne or Weather,
some giue a reason, that the Fruit, Louing and Coueting the open
Aire and Sunne, is inuited by those Pertusions, to spread and approch,
as neare the open Aire, as it can; And so enlargeth in Magnitude.
                  
                  All Trees, in High and Sandy Grounds, are to be set deepe; And in Watry 
Grounds, more shallow. And in all Trees, when they be remoued (especially
Fruit-Trees) care ought to be taken, that the Sides of the Trees be
coasted, (North and South, &amp;c.) as they stood before. The same is said
also of Stone out of the Quarry, to make it more durable; Though that

seemeth to haue lesse reason; Because the Stone lyeth not so neare the
Sunne, as the Tree groweth.
                  
                     
                     Timber Trees in a Coppice Wood, doe grow better, than in an Open
Field; Both because, they offer not to spread so much, but shoot vp still
in Height; And chiefly because they are defended from too much Sun
and Wind, which doe checke the Growth of all Fruit; And so (no
doubt) Fruit-Trees, or Vines, set vpon a Wall, against the Sunne, betweene
Elbowes or Buttresses of Stone, ripen more, than vpon a Plaine
Wall.
                  
                      It is said, that if Potado Roots, be set in a Pot filled with Earth, and
then the Pot with Earth be set likewise within the Ground, some two or
three Inches, the Roots will grow greater, than Ordinary. The Cause
may be, for that Hauing Earth enough within the Pot to nourish them;
And then being stopped by the Bottom of the Pot from putting Strings
downward, they must needs grow greater in Breadth, and Thicknesse.
And it may be, that all Seeds or Roots, Potted, and so set into the Earth,
will prosper the better.
                  
                      The Cutting off the Leaues of Radish, or other Roots, in the beginning
of Winter, before they wither; And Couering againe the Root,
something high with Earth; Will preserue the Root all Winter, and
make it bigger, in the Spring following, as hath beene partly touched
before. So that there is a double Vse of this Cutting off the Leaues: For
in Plants, where the Root is the Esculent, as Radish, and Parsnips, it will
make the Root the greater: And so it will doe to the Heads of Onions.
And where the Fruit is the Esculent, by Strengthning the Root, it will
make the Fruit also the greater.
                  
                      It is an Experiment of great pleasure, to make the Leaues of Shady
Trees, larger than ordinary. It hath beene tryed (for certaine) that a Cions
of a Weech-Elme, grafted vpon the Stocke of an Ordinary Elme, will
put forth Leaues, almost as broad as the Brimme of ones Hat. And it
is very likely, that as in Fruit-Trees, the Graft maketh a greater Fruit; So
in Trees that beare no Fruit, it will make the greater Leaues. It would be
tryed therefore in Trees of that kinde chiefly; As Birch, Asp, Willow;
And especially the Shining Willow, which they call Swallow-Taile, because
of the pleasure of the Leafe.
                  
                      The Barrennesse of Trees, by Accident, (besides the Weaknesse of the
Soile, Seed, or Root; And the Iniury of the Weather) commeth either of
their Ouer-growing with Mosse, Or their being Hide-bound; Or their Planting
too deepe; Or by Issuing of the Sap too much into the Leaues. For all
these there are Remedies mentioned before.
                  Wee see that in Liuing Creatures, that haue Male and Female,
there is Copulation of seuerall Kindes; And so Compound
Creatures; As the Mule, that is generated betwixt the Horse
and the Asse; And some other Compounds, which we call Monsters,

though more rare: And it is held, that that Prouerbe,
Africa semper aliquid Monstri parit; commeth, for that the
Fountaines of Waters there, being rare, diuers Sorts of Beasts
come from seuerall Parts to drinke; And so being refreshed,
fall to couple, and many times with seuerall Kinds.
                        Experiments in Consort touching Compound Fruits and Flowers. The Compounding
or Mixture of Kinds in Plants is not found out;
Which neuerthelesse, if it be possible, is more at command,
than that of liuing Creatures; For that their Lust requireth a
voluntary Motion: wherefore it were One of the most Noble
Experiments touching Plants, to finde it out: For so you
may haue great Varietie of New Fruits, and Flowers yet vnknowne.
Grafting doth it not: That mendeth the Fruit, or
doubleth the Flowers, &amp;c. But it hath not the Power to make
a New Kinde. For the Cions euer ouer-ruleth the Stocke.
                  
                  It hath beene set downe by one of the Ancients, that if you take two 
                     Twigs of seuerall Fruit Trees, and flat them on the Sides, and then binde
them close together, and set them in the ground, they will come vp in
one Stocke; But yet they will put forth their seuerall Fruits, without any
Commixture in the Fruit. Wherein note (by the way) that Vnitie of Continuance,
is easier to procure, than Vnitie of Species. It is reported also,
that Vines of Red and White Grapes, being set in the Ground, and the vpper
Parts being flatted, and bound close together, will put forth Grapes
of the seuerall Colours, vpon the same Branch; And Grape-Stones of seuerall
Colours within the same Grape: But the more, after a yeare or
two; The Vnitie (as it seemeth) growing more Perfect. And this will
likewise helpe, if from the first Vniting, they be often Watred; For all
Moisture helpeth to Vnion. And it is prescribed also, to binde the Bud,
as soone as it commeth forth, as well as the Stocke; At the least for a
time.
                  They report, that diuers Seeds, put into a Clout, and laid in Earth 
well dunged, will put vp Plants Contiguous; Which (afterwards) being
bound in, their Shoots will Incorporate. The like is said of Kernels, put
into a Bottle, with a Narrow Mouth, filled with Earth.
                  It is reported, that young Trees of seuerall kindes, set contiguous,
without any binding, and very often Watred, in a Fruitfull Ground, with
the very Luxurie of the Trees will incorporate, and grow together.
Which seemeth to me the likeliest Meanes, that hath beene propounded;
For that the Binding doth hinder the Naturall Swelling of the Tree;
which, while it is in Motion, doth better vnite.
                  
                  There are many Ancient and Receiued Traditions and
Obseruations, touching the Sympathy and Antipathy of Plants:
                     
For that some will thriue best growing neere others; which
they impute to Sympathy: And some worse; which they impute
to Antipathy.
                     Experiments in Consort touching the Sympathy and Antipathy of Plants.
                      But these are Idle and Ignorant Conceits;
And forsake the true Indication of the Causes; As the most
Part of Experiments, that concerne Sympathies and Antipathies
doe. For as to Plants, neither is there any such Secret
Friendship, or Hatred, as they imagine; And if we should be
content to call it Sympathy, and Antipathy, it is vtterly mistaken;
For their Sympathy is an Antipathy, and their Antipathy
is a Sympathy: For it is thus; Wheresoeuer one Plant draweth
such a particular Iuyce out of the Earth; as it qualifieth the
Earth; So as that Iuyce which remaineth is fit for the other
Plant, there the Neighbourhood doth good; Because the
Nourishments are contrary, or seuerall: But where two
Plants draw (much) the same Iuyce, there the Neighbourhood
hurteth; For the one deceiueth the other.
                  
                      First therfore, all Plants that doe draw much Nourishment from the
Earth, and so soake the Earth, and exhaust it; hurt all Things that grow
by them; As Great Trees, (especially Ashes,) and such Trees, as spread
their Roots, neere the Top of the Ground. So the Colewort is not an
Enemy (though that were anciently receiued) to the Vine only; But it
is an Enemy to any other Plant; Because it draweth strongly the fattest
Iuyce of the Earth. And if it be true, that the Vine, when it creepeth
neere the Colewort, will turneaway; This may be, because there it findeth
worse Nourishment; For though the Root be where it was, yet (I
doubt) the Plant will bend as it nourisheth.
                  
                      Where Plants are of seuerall Natures, and draw seuerall Iuyces out of
the Earth, there (as hath beene said) the One set by the other helpeth:
As it is set downe by diuers of the Ancients, that Rew doth prosper
much, and becommeth stronger, if it be set by a Figge-Tree: which (we
conceiue) is caused, Not by Reason of Friendship, but by Extraction
of a Contrary Iuyce: The one Drawing Iuyce fit to result Sweet, the
other bitter. So they haue set downe likewise, that a Rose set by Garlicke
is sweeter: Which likewise may be, because the more Fetide Iuyce of
the Earth goeth into the Garlicke; And the more Odorate into the Rose.
                  
                  
                      This wee see manifestly, that there be certaine Corne-Flowers, which
come seldome or neuer in other places, vnlesse they be set; But onely
amongst Corne: As the Blew-Bottle, a kinde of Yellow Mary Gold, Wilde
Poppy, and Fumitorie. Neither can this be, by Reason of the Culture
of the Ground, by Plowing, or Furrowing; As some Herbs, and Flowers,
will grow but in Ditches new Cast; for if the Ground lie sallow, and
vnsowne, they will not come: So as it should seeme to be the Corne,
                     
that qualifieth the Earth, and prepareth it for their Growth.
                  This Obseruation, if it holdeth, (as it is very probable,) is of great 
vse, for the Meliorating of Taste in Fruits, and Esculent Herbs; And of
the Sent of Flowers. For I doe not doubt, but if the Figge-Tree doe make
the Rew more strong, and bitter, (as the Ancients haue noted,) good
store of Rew planted about the Figge-Tree, will make the Figge more
sweet. Now the Tastes that doe most offend in Fruits, and Herbs, and
Roots, are Bitter; Harrish; Sowre; And Watrish, or Flashy. It were good
therefore to make the Trials following.
                  Take Wormewood, or Rew, and set it neere Lettuce, or Goleflory, or 
                     Arti
                           •
                        hoake; And see whether the Lettuce, or the Coleflory, &amp;c. become
not the sweeter.
                  Take a Seruice-Tree, or a Cornelian-Tree, or an Elder-Tree, which wee 
know haue Fruits of harsh and binding Iuyce, and set them neere a Vine,
or Figge-Tree, and see whether the Grapes, or Figs, will be the sweeter.
                  Take Cucumbers, or Pumpions, and set them (here and there) amongst 
                     Muske-Melons, and see whether the Melons will not be more Winy, and
better tasted. Set Cucumbers (likewise) amongst Radish, and see whether
the Radish will not be made the more Biting.
                  Take Sorrell, and set it amongst Rosps, and see whether the Rasps will 
not be the sweeter.
                  Take Common Briar, and set it amongst Violets, or Wall-Flowers, and 
see whether it will not make the Violets, or Wall-Flowers sweeter, and lesse
Earthy in their Smell. So set Lettuce, or Cucumbers, amongst Rosemary,
or Bayes, and see whether the Rosemary, on Bayes, will not be the more
Odorate, or Aromaticall.
                  Contrariwise, you must take heed, how you set Herbs together, that 
draw much the like Iuyce. And therefore I thinke Rosemary will leese
in Sweetnesse, if it be set with Lauender, or Bayes, or the like. But yet,
if you will correct the strength of an Herbe, you shall doe well to set
other like Herbs by him, to take him downe; As if you should set
Tansey by Angelica, it may be, the Angelica would be the weaker, and
fitter for Mixture in Perfume. And if you should set Rew by Common
Wormewood, it may be, the Wormewood would turne to be like Roman
Worniewood.
                  
                  This Axiome is of large extent; And therefore would be seuered, and 
refined by Triall. Neither must you expect to haue a Grasse Difference by
this kinde of Culture, but only Further Perfection.
                  
                  Triall would be also made in Herbs Poisonous, and Purgatine, whose ill 
Qualitie (perhaps) may be discharged, or attempted, by Setting stronger
Poisons; or Purgatines, by them.
                  It is reported, that the Shrub called Our Ladies Seale; (which is a 
Kinde of Briony,) and Coleworts, set neere together, one or both will
die. The Cause is, for that they be both great Depredatours of the
Earth, and one of them starueth the other. The like is said of a Reed,
and a Brake; Both which are succulent; And therefore the One deceiueth

the Other. And the like of Hemlocke and Rew; Both which draw
strong luyces.
                  
                      Some of the Ancients, and likewise diures of the Moderne Writers,
that haue laboured in Natural Magicke, haue noted a Sympathy, between
the Sunne, Moone, and some Principall Starres; And certaine Herbs, and
Plants. And so they haue denominated some Herbs Solar, and some Lunar;
And such like Toyes put into great Words. It is manifest, that
there are some Flowers, that haue Respect to the Sunne, in two Kindes;
The one by Opening and Shutting; And the other by Bowing and Inclining
the Head. For Mary-golds, Tulippa's, Pimper
                           •
                        ell, and indeed most
Flowers, doe open or spread their Leaues abroad, when the Sunne shineth
serene and faire: And againe, (in some part,) close them, or gather
them inward, either towards Night, or when the Skie is ouercast. Of
this there needeth no such Solemne Reason to be assigned; As to say,
that they reioyce at the presence of the Sunne; And mourne at the Absence
thereof. For it is Nothing else, but a little Loading of the Leaues,
and Swelling them at the Bottome, with the Moisture of the Aire;
whereas the drie Aire doth extend them: And they make it a Peece of
the wonder, that Garden Clauer will hide the Stalke, when the Sunne
sheweth bright; Which is Nothing, but a full Expansion of the leaues.
For the Bowing and Inclining the Head; it is found in the great Flower of
the Sunne; in Mary-golds; Wart wort; Mallow Flowers; and others. The
Cause is somewhat more Obscure than the former; But I take it to be no
other, but that the Part against which the Sunne beateth, waxeth more
faint and flaccide in the Stalke; And thereby lesse able to support the
Flower.
                  
                  
                      What a little Moisture will doe in Vegetables, euen though they be
dead, and seuered from the Earth, appeareth well in the Experiment of
Inglers. They take the Beard of an Oate; which (if you marke it well,) is
wreathed at the Bottome, and one smooth entire Straw at the Top. They
take only the Part that is Wreathed, and cut off the other, leauing the
Beard halfe the Breadth of a finger in length. Then they make a little
Crosse of a Quill, long-wayes of that Part of the Quill, which hath the
Pith; And Crosse-wayes of that peece of the Quill without Pith; The
whole Crosse being the Breadth of a Finger high. Then they pricke the
Bottome where the Pith is, and thereinto they put the Oaten-beard, leauing
halfe of it sticking forth of the Quill: Then they take a little white
Box of wood, to deceiue Men, as if somewhat in the Box did worke the
Feat: In which, with a Pinne, they make a little Hole, enough to take
the Beard, but not to let the Crosse sinke downe, but to sticke. Then likewise
by way of Imposture, they make a Question; As, Who is the Fairest
Woman in the Company? Or, Who hath a Gloue, or Card? And
canse Another to name diners Persons: And vpon euery Naming, they
sticke the Crosse in the Box, hauing first put it towards their Mouth, as
if they charmed it; And the Crasse stirreth not; But when they come to
the Person that they would take; As they hold the Orasse to their Mouth,

they touch the Beard with the Tip of their Tongue, and wet it; And
so sticke the Crosse in the Box; And then you shall see it turne finely
and softly, three or foure Turnes; Which is caused by the vntwining
of the Beard by the Moisture. You may see it more euidently, if you
sticke the Crosse betweene your fingers, in Stead of the Box; And therfore
you may see, that this Motion, which is effected by so little Wet, is
stronger than the Closing or Bending of the Head of a Marigold.
                  
                  It is reported by some, that the Herb called Rosa-Solis, (wherof they 
make Strong Waters,) will at the Noone-day, when the Sunne shineth
hot and bright, haue a great Dew vpon it. And therefore, that the right
Name is Ros Solis: which they impute to a Delight and Sympathy, that
it hath with the Sunne. Men fauour Wonders. It were good first to be
sure, that the Dew that is found vpon it, be not the Dew of the Morning
Preserued, when the Dew of other Herbs is breathed away; for it
hath a smooth and thicke Leafe, that doth not discharge the Dew so
soone, as other Herbs that are more Spungy and Porous. And it may
be Purslane, or some other Herb, doth the like, and is not marked. But
if it be so, that it hath more Dew at Noone, than in the Morning, then
sure it seemeth to be an Exudation of the Herb is solfe. As Plums sweat
when they are set into the Ouen: for you will not (I hope) thinke, that
it is like Gedeons Fleeel of Wood, that the Dew should fail vpon that, and
no where else.
                  It is certaine, that the Honey-dews are found more vpon Oahe-le

Flowers that haue deepe Sockets, doe gather in the Bottome, a kinde of
Honey; As Honey-Suckles; (both the Woodbine, and the Trisoile;) Dillier;
and the like. And in them certainly the Flower beareth part with
the Dew.
                  
                  The Experience is, that the Froth, which they call Woodsears, (being 
like a kinde of Spittle,) is found but vpon certaine Herbs, and those Hot
Ones; As Lauender-cotton, Sage, Hissope, &amp;c. Of the Cause of
this enquire further; For it seemeth a Secret. There falleth also Mildew
vpon Corne, and smutteth it; But it may be, that the same salleth
also vpon other Herbs, and is not obserued.

creeping to the Pot of Water, is far stranger than this.
                  The Altering of the Sent, Colour, or Taste, of Fruit, by Infusing, Mixing,
or Letting into the Barke, or Rost, of the Tree, Herb, or Flower, any
Coloured, Aromaticall, or Medicinall; Substance; are but Fancies.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching the Making Herbs and Fruits Medicinable.
                      The Cause
is, for that those Things haue passed their Period, and nourish not. And
 all Alteration of Vegetables, in those Qualitles, must be by somewhat,
that is apt to goe into the Nourishment of the Plant. But this is true;
that where Kine feed vpon Wilde Garlicke, their Milke tasteth plainly of
the Garlicke: And the Flesh of Muttons is better tasted where the Sheepe
feed vpon Wilde Thyme, and other wholesome Herbs. Galen also speaketh
of the Curing of the Scirrus of the Liuer, by Milke of a Cow, that feedeth
but vpon certaine Herbs; And Honey in Spaine smelleth (apparently)
of the Rosemary, or Orenge, from whence the Bee gathereth it: And
there is an old Tradition of a Mayden that was fed with Napellus; (which
is counted the Strongest Poyson of all Vegetables;) which with vse did
not hurt the Maid, but poisoned some that had Carnall Company with
her. So it is obserued by some, that there is a vertuous Bexoar, and another
without vertue; which appeare to the shew alike; But the Vertuous
is taken from the Beast, that feedeth vpon the Mountaines, where
there are Theriacall Herbs; And that without Vertue; from those that
feed in the Valleyes, where no such Herbs are. Thus far I am of Opinion;
That as Steeped Wines and Beeres, are very Medicinall; and likewise
Bread tempred with diuers Powders; So of Meat also, (as Flesh,
Fish, Milke, and Egges,) that they may be made of great vse for Medicine,
and Diet, if the Beasts, Fowle, or Fish, be fed with a speciall kinde of
food, fit for the Disease. It were a dangerous Thing also for secret Empoysonthents.
But whether it may be applyed vnto Plants, and Herbs. I
doubt more; Because the Nourishment of them is a more common
Iuyce; which is hardly capable of any speciall Quality, vntill the Plant
doe assimilate it.
                  
                      But lest our Incredulity may preiudice any profitable Operations in
this kind, (especially since Many of the Ancients haue set them down,)
We thinke good briefly to propound the foure Meanes, which they haue
deuised of Making Plants Medicinable. The First is by Slitting of the
Root, and Infusing into it the Medicine; As Hellebore, Opium, Scammony,
Triacle, &amp;c. And then binding it vp againe. This seemeth to me the least
probable; Because the Root draweth immediately from the Earth; And
so the Nourishment is the more Common, and lesse Qualified: And
besides, it is a long time in Going vp, ere it come to the Fruit. The Second
Way is, to Perforate the Body of the Tree, and there to Infuse the
Medicine: Which is somewhat better: For if any Vertue be receiued
from the Medicine, it hath the lesse way, and the lesse time, to goe vp.
The Third is, the Steeping of the Seed or Kernell in some Liquour, wherein

the Medicine is Infused: Which I haue little Opinion of, because the
Seed, (I doubt,) will not draw the Parts of the Matter, which haue the
Propriety: But it will be farre the more likely, if you mingle the Medicine
with Dung; For that the Seed naturally drawing the Moisture of
the Dung, may call in withall some of the Propriety. The fourth is, the
Watring of the Plant oft, with an Infusion of the Medicine. This, in one
respect, may haue more force than the rest; Because the Medication is
oft renewed; Whereas the rest are applyed but at one time: And
therefore the Vertue may the sooner vanish. But still I doubt, that
the Root is somewhat too stubborne to receiue those fine Impressions;
And besides, (as I said before,) they haue a great Hill to goe vp. I
iudge therefore the likeliest way to be the Perforation of the Body
of the Tree, in senerall Places, one aboue the other; And the Filling
of the Holes with Dung mingled with the Medicine.
And the Watring of those Lumpes of Dung, with
Squirts of an Infusion of the Medicine in
Dunged water, once in three
or foure Daies.
               
               
                  
                  
                  NATVRALL
HISTORIE.
                  VI. Century.
                  OVR Experiments we take care to be, (as
we haue often said,) either Experimenta Fructifera,
or Lucifera; Either of
Vse, or of Discouery: For we hate Impostures; And despise Curiosities.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching Curiosities about Fruits and Plants.
                      Yet because
we must apply out Selues somewhat
to Others, wee will set downe
some Curiofities touching Plants.
                  
                  It is a Curiosity, to haue seuerall Fruits vpon one Tree; And the more,
when some of them come Early, and some come Late; So that you,
may haue, vpon the same Tree, Ripe Fruits all Sommer. This is easily
done, by Grafting of Seurall Cians, vpon seuerall Boughes of a Stock,
in a good Ground, plentifully sed. So you may haue all Kindes of Cherries,
and all kindes of Plums, and Peaches, and Apricots, vpon one Tree;
But I conceiue the Diuer sity of Fruits must be such, as will grast vpon
the same Stocke. And therefore, I doubt, whether you can haue Apples,
or Peares, or Orenges, vpon the same Stocke, vpon which you graft
Plummes.
                  
                  It is a Curiosity to haue Fruits of Diuers Shopes, and Figures. This is 
easily performed by Moulding them, when the Fruit is young, with
Moulds of Earth, or Wood. So you may haue Cucumbers &amp;c. as Long

as a Cane; Or as Round as a Spheare; Or formed like a Crosse. You
may haue also Apples, in the sorme of Peares, or Limons. You may haue
also Fruit in more Accurate Figures; As we said of Men, Beasts, or Birds,
according as you make the Moulds. Wherein you must vnderstand,
that you make the Mould big enough, to containe the whole Fruit,
when it is growne to the greatest: For else you will choake the Spreading
of the Fruit; Which otherwise would spread it selfe, and fill the
Concaue, and so be turned into the Shape desired; As it is in Mouldworkes
of Liquid Things. Some doubt may be conceiued, that the
Keeping of the Sunne from the Fruit, may hurt it: But there is ordinary
experience of Fruit that groweth Couered. Quare also, whether
some small Holes, may not be made in the Wood, to let in the Sunne.
And note, that it were best to make the Moulds partible, glued, or cemented
together, that you may open them, when you take out the
Fruit.
                  
                  
                      It is a Curiosity, to haue Inscriptions, or Engrauings, in Fruit, or Trees.
This is easily performed, by Writing with a Needle, or Bodkin, or Knife,
or the like, when the Fruit, or Trees are young; For as they grow, so the
Letters will grow more large, and Graphicall.

                      You may haue Trees apparrelled with Flowers, or Herbs, by Boring
Holes in the Bodies of them, and Putting into them Earth Holpen with
Mucke, and Setting Seeds, or Slips, of Wielets, Stramberries, Wilde-Thyme
Camamill, and such like in the Earth. Wherein they doe but grow, in the
Tree, as they doe in Pots; Though (perhaps) with some Feeding from
the Trees. It would be tried also with Shoots of Vines and Roots of RedRoses;
For it may be, they being of a more Ligueout Nature, will incorporate
with the Tree it selfe.
                  
                      It is an ordinary Curiosity, to Forme Trees and Sbrubs, (as Rosemary,
Inniper, and the like,) into Sundry Shapes; which is done by Moulding
them within, and Cutting them without. But they are but lame
Things, being too small to keepe Figure: Great Castles made of Trees
vpon Frames of Timber, with Turrets, and Arches, were anciently matters
of Magnificence.
                  
                      Amongst Cariofities, I shall place Colouration, though it be somewhat
better: For Beauty in Flowers is their Preheminence. It is obserued by
some, that Gilly-flowers, Sweet-Williams, Yielets, that are Coloured, if they
be neglected, and neither Watred, not New Monlded, nor Transplanted,
will turne White. And it is probable, that the White with much culture,
may turne Coloured. For this is certaine, that the White Colour
commeth of Scarcity of Nourishment; Except in Flowers that are
onely White, and admit no other Colours.
                  
                  
                      It is good therefore, to see what Natures doe accompany what Colours;
For by that you shall haue Light, how to induce Colours, by Producing
those Natures. Whites are more Inodorate, (for the most part)

than Flowers of the same kinde Coloured; As is found in Single White
Violets, White-Roses, White Gilly-Flowers, White Stock-Grlly-Flowers, &amp;c.
Wee finde also, that Blossomes of Trees, that are White, are commonly
Inodorate; As Cherries, Pearas; Pl
                           •••••
                        s; Whereas those of Apples,
Crabs, Almonds, and Peaches, are Blushy, and Smell Sweet. The Cause
is, for that the Substance that maketh the Flower, is of the thinnest
and sinest of the Plant; Which also maketh Flowers to be of so dainty
Colours. And if it bee too Sparing, and Thinne, it attaineth no
Strength of Odour; Except it be in such Plants, as are very Succulent;
Whereby they need rather to be scanted in their Nourishment, than
replenished, to haue them sweet. As we fee in White Satyrian, which is
of a Dainty Smell; And in Beane-Flowers, &amp;c. And againe, if the
Plant be of Nature, to put forth White Flowers onely, and those not
thinne, or dry, they are commonly of rancke and fulsome Smell; As
May-Flowers, and White Lillies.
                  
                  Contrariwise, in Berries, the White is commonly more Delicaee,
and Sweet in Taste, than the Coloured; As wee see in White Grapes;
In White Raspes; In White Strawberries; In White Carra
                           •
                        , &amp;c. The
Cause is, for that the Coloured are more iuyced, and courfer iuyced; And
therefore not so well and equally Concocted; But the White are better
proportioned, to the Disgestion of the Plant.
                  
                  But in Fruits, the White commonly is meaner; As in Peare-Plums,
Da
                           •
                        asi
                           •
                        s, &amp;c. And the Choicest Plammes are Blacke, The Malberry,
(which though they call it a Berry, is a Fruit,) is better the Blacke, than
the White. The Haruest White-Pl
                           •
                        mme, is a base Pl

                        mme; And the Verdoccie
and White Date-Plamme, are no very good Plummes. The Cause
is, for that they are all Ouer-watry: Whereas an higher Concoction
is required for Sweetnesse, or Pleasure of Taste; And therefore all
your dainty Plummes, are a little dry, and come from the Stone; As
the Muscle-Plumme, the Damasin-Plumme, the Peach, the Apricet, &amp;c.
Yet some Fruits, which grow not to be Blacke, are of the Nature of
Berries, sweetest such as are Paler; As the Cae
                           •
                        r-Cherry, which inclineth
more to White, is sweeter than the Red; But the Egriot is more
sowre.
                  Take Gilly-Flower Seed, of one kinde of Gilly-Flower: (As of the 
                     Cloue-Gilly-Flower, which is the most Common;) And sow it; And
there will come vp Gilly-Flowers, some of one Colour, and some of another,
casually, as the Seed meeteth with Nourishment in the Earth;
So that the Gardiners finde, that they may haue two or three Roots amongst
an hundred, that are rare, and of great Price: As Purple, Carnation
of Seuerall Stripes; The Canse is, (no doubt,) that in Earth, though
it be contiguous, and in one Bed, there are very feuerall luyees; And as
the Seed doth casually meet with them, so it commethforth. And it is
noted especially, that those which doe come vp Purple, doe alwayes
come vp Single; The Iuyee, as it seemeth, not being able to suffice a
Succulent Colour, and a Double Leafe. This Experiment of seuerall Colours,

comming vp from one Seed, would be tried also in Larkes-Foot,
Moukes-Head, Rappy, and Hollyoke.
                  
                  
                      Few Fruits are coloured Red within; The Queene-Apple is; And
another Apple, called the Rose Apple; Mulberries likewise; and Grapes,
though most toward the Skinne. There is a Peach also, that hath a
Circle of Red towards the Stone: And the Egriot-Cherry is somewhat
Red within; But no Peare, nor Warden, not Plumme, nor Apricet, although
they haue (many times) Red sides, are Coloured Red within.
The Canse may be enquired.
                  
                      The Generall Colour of Plants is Greene; which is a Colour that no
Flower is of. There is a Greenish Prime-Rose, but it is Pale, and scatce a
Greene; The Leaues of some Trees turne a little Murry, or Reddish; And
they be commonly Young Leaues that doe so; As it is in Oakes, and Vines,
and Hasle. Leaves tot into a Yellow; And some Hollies haue part of their
Leaues Yellow, that are, (to all seeming,) as Fresh and Shining, as the
Greene. I suppose also, that Yellow is a lesse Succulent Colour, than Greene;
And a degree nearer White. For it hath beene noted, that those Yellow
Leaues of Holly stand euor towards the North, or North-East. Some
Roots are Yellow, as Carress; And some Plants Bloud-Red, Stalke and
Leafe, and all; as Amaranthus. Some Herbs incline to Purple, and Red;
As a Kinde of Sage doth, and a Kinde of Mint, and Rosa Solis, &amp;c. And
Some haue White Leaues, as another Kinde of Sape, and another kinde

Sheweth, that Flowers are made of a Refined luyce, of the Earth; And
so are Fruits: But Leaues of a more Courfe, and Common.
                  
                      It is a Curiosity also to make Flowers Double; Which is effected by
Often Remouing them into New Earth; As on the contrary Part, Double
Flowers, by neglecting, and not Remouing, proue Single And the
Way to doe it speedily, is to sow or set Seeds, or Slips of Flowers; And
as soone as they come vp, to remoue them into New Ground, that
is good. Enquire also, whether Inoculating of Flowers, (as Stock-GillyFlowers,
Roses, Muske-Roses. &amp;c.) doth not make them Double. There is
a Cherry-Tree, that hath Double Blossomes; But that Tree beareth no Fruit;
And, it may be, that the same Meanes, which applied to the Tree, doth
extremely accelerate the Sap to rise, and breake sorth. Would make
the Tree spend it selfe in Flowers, and those to become Double; Which
were a great pleasure to see; Especially in Apple-Trees, Peach-Trees,
and Almond-Trees, that haue Blossomes Blush-Coloured.
                  
                  
                      The Making of Fruits, without Core or Stone, is likewise a Curiosity;
And somewhat better: Because whatsoeuer maketh them so, is like to
make them more Tender and Delicate. If a Cions or Shooe, fit to be set
in the Ground, haue the Pith finely taken forth, (and not altogether,
but some of it left, the better to saue the life,) it will beare a Fruit with
little, or no Core, or Stone. And the like is said to be, of diuiding a
Quicke-Tree downe to the Ground, and Taking out the Pith, and then
binding it vp againe.

than vpon the Graft. For the Stocke, though it glueth a finer Nourishment,
yet it giueth a scanter, than the Earth at large.
                  
                     Seeds, if they be very Old, and yet haue strength enough to bring forth 
a Plant, make the Plant degenerate. And therefore skilfull Gardiners
make triall of the Seeds, before they buy them, whether they be good or
no, by Putting them into Water gently Boyled; And if they be good,
they will sprout within Halfe an Houre.
                  It is strange which is reported, that Basill too such exposed to the 
                     Sunne, doth turne into Wilde Thyme: Although those two Herbs seeme
to haue small Affinitie; but Basill is almost the only Hot Herbe, that hath
Fat and Succulent Leaues; Which Oylinesse, if it be drawne forth by
the Sunne, it is like it will make a very great Change.
                  There is an old Tradition, that Boughs of Oake, put into the Earth,
will put forth Wilde Vines: Which if it be true, (no doubt,) it is not the
Oake that turneth into a Vine, but the Oake-Bough Putrifying, qualifieth
the Earth, to put forth a Vine of it selfe.
                  
                     
                      It is not impossible, and I haue heard it verified, that vpon Cutting
downe of an Old Timber-Tree, the Stub hath put out sometimes a Tree of
another Kinde; As that Beech hath put forth Birch; Which, if it be
true, the Cause may be, for that the old Stub is too scant of Iuyce, to put
forth the former Tree; And therefore putteth forth a Tree of a smaller
kindey that needeth lesse Nourishment.
                  
                      There is an Opinion in the Countrey, that if the same Ground be oft sowen,
with the Graine that grew vpon it, it will, in the end, grow to be

And generally it is a Rule, that Plants, that are brought forth by Culture,
as Corne, will sooner change into other Species, than those that come of
themselues: For that Culture giueth but an Aduentitious Nature, which
is more easily put off.
                  This worke of the Transmutation of Plants, one into another,
is inter Magnalia Naturae: For the Transmutation of Species
is, in the vulgar philosophie, pronounced Impossible:
And certainly, it is a thing of difficultie, and requireth deepe
Seatch into Nature: But feeing there appeare some manifest
Instances of it, the Opinion of Impossibilitie is to be reiected;
And the Meanes thereof to be found out. Wee see, that in
Liuing Creatures, that come of Putrefaction, there is much
Transmutation, of one into another; As Catterpillers turne into
Flies, &amp;c. And it should seeme probable, that what soeuer
Creature, hauing life, is generated without Seed, that Creature
will change out of one Species into another. For it is the
Seed, and the Nature of it, which locketh and boundeth in
the Creature, that it doth not expatiate. So as wee may well
conclude, that seeing the Earth, of it selfe, doth put forth
Plants, without Seed, therefore Plants may well haue a Transmigration
of Species. Wherefore Wanting Instances, which
doe occurre, wee shall giue Directions of the most likely
Trialls: And generally, wee would not haue those, that read
this our Worke of Sylua Syluarum, account it strange, or thinke
that it is an Ouer-Haste, that wee haue set downe Particulars
vntried; For contrariwise, in our owne Estimation, we account
such Particulars, more worthy, than those that are already

tried and knowne. For these Later must be taken as
you finde them; But the Other doe leuell Point blanke at the
Inuenting of Causes, and Axiomes.
                  
                  Flast therefore you must make account, that if you will haue one 
                     Plant change into another, you must haue the Nourishment ouer-rule the
Seed; And therefore you are to practise it by Nourishments as contrary,
as may be, to the Nature of the Harbs; So neuerthelesse as the Herbe may
grow; And likewise with Seeds that are of the Weakest Sort, and haue
least Vigour. You shall doe well therefore, to take Marsh-Herbs, and
Plant them vpon Tops of Hills, and Champaignes; And such plants as
require much Moisture, vpon Sandy and very drie Grounds. As for
Example, Marsh-Maltowes, and Sedge, vpon Hills; Cucumber and Let

                  The second Rule shall be to burie some few Seeds, of the Herbe you 
would change, amongst other Seeds; And then you shall see, whether

But you shall doe well, to put the Seed you would change, into

                     Earth, with some other plants Braised, or Shanes, either in Leafe or

                      what Herbs, some 
                           •••

it; And in that to set the Seed you would change: as for example, sake
from vnder Walls, or the like, where Nettles put forth in abundance, the Earth which you shall there finde, without any String, or Root of
the Nettles; And Pot that Earth, and set in it Stock-gilly, flowers, or
Wall Flowers, &amp;c. Or sow in the Seeds of them; And see what the
Euent will be: Or take Earth, that you haue prepared to put forth Mushromes,
                     
of it selfe, (whereof you shall finde some Instances following;)
And sow in it Purslane Seed, or Lettuce-Seed; For in these Experiments,
it is likely enough, that the Earth being accustomed to send forth one
Kinde of Nourishment, will alter the new Seed.
                  
                  
                      The fifth Rule shall be, to make the Herbe grow Contrary to his Nature;
As to make Ground-Herbes rise in Heighth: As for example; Carry
Camomill, or Wilde-Thyme, or the Greene Strawberry, vpon Sticks, as
you doe Heps vpon Poles; And see what the Euent will be.
                  
                      The sixth Rule shall be, to make Plants grow out of the Sunne, or Open
Aire; For that is a great Mutation in Nature; And may induce a
Change in the Seed: As barrell vp Earth, and sow some Seed in it, and
put it in the Bottome of a Pond; Or put it in some great hollow Tree;
Trie also the Sowing of Seeds, in the Bottomes of Caues; And Pots
with Seeds sowne, hanged vp in Wells, some distance from the Water,
and see what the Euent will be.
                  It is certaine, that Timber-Trees in Coppice-Words, grow more vpright,
and more free from Vnder-Boughs, than those that stand in the Field;
The Cause whereof is, for that Plants haue a Naturall Motion, to get to
the Sunne; And besides, they are not glutted with too much Nourishment;
For that the Coppice shareth with them; And Repletion euer hindreth
 Stature; Lastly, they are kept warme; And that euer in Plants

                     Trees, that are, of themselues, full of Heat, (which Heat appeareth
by their Inflammable Gumms,) as Firrs, and Pines, mount of themselues
in Heighth without Side-Boughs, till they come towards the Top. The
Cause is, partly Heat; And partly Tenuitie of Iuyce; Both which send
the Sap vpwards. As for Iuniper, it is but a Shrub, and groweth not
bigge enough in Body, to maintaine a tall Tree.
                  
                  
                      It is reported, that a Good Strong Canuas, spread ouer a Tree grasted
low, soone after it putteth forth, will dwarfe it, and make it spread. The
Cause is plaine; For that all Things that grow, will grow as they finde
Roome.
                  
                     
                     Trees are generally set of Roots, or Kernells; But if you set them of
Slips, (as of some Trees you may, by name the Mulberry), some of the
Slips will take; And those that take, (as is reported,) will be DwarfeTrees.
The Cause is, for that a Slip draweth Nourishment more weakly,
than either a Root, or Kernell.
                  
                  
                      All Plants, that put forth their Sap hastily, haue their Bodies not proportionable
to their Length; And therefore they are Winders, and Creepers;
As Iuy, Briony, Hops, Woodbine: Whereas Dwarsing requireth a
slow Putting forth, and lesse Vigour of Mounting.
                  The Scripture saith, that Salomon wrote a Naturall History,
from the Cedar of Libanus, to the Mosse growing vpon the Wall:
                     
For so the belt Translations haue it.Experiments in Consort, touching the And it is true that Mosse

                     Mosse groweth chiefly vpon Ridges of Houses, tiled or thatched, And 
vpon the Crests of Walls. And that Mosse is of a lightsome, and pleasant
Greene. The Growing vpon Slopes is caused, for that Mosse, as on the
one side it commeth of Moisture and Water, so on the other side the
Water must but Slide, and not Stand or Poole. And the Growing vpon
Tiles, or Walls, &amp;c. is caused, for that those dried Earths, hauing not
Moisture sufficient to put forth a Plant, doe practise Gormination by Putting
forth Mosse; Though when by Age, or otherwise, they grow to
relent and resolue, they sometimes put forth Plants; As Wall-Flowers.
And almost all Mosse hath here and there little Stalkes, besides the low
Thrumme.
                  
                     Mosse groweth vpon Alleyes, especially such as lye Cold, and vpon 
the North; As in diuers Tarrasses: And againe, if they be much trodden;
Or if they were, at the first, grauelled; For wheresoeuer Plants
are kept downe, the Earth putteth forth Mosse.

grow to Mosse, by Tilling them for a yeare, or two: Which also dependeth
vpon the same Cause; For that, the more Sparing and Staruing
Iuyce of the Earth, in sufficient for Plants, doth breed Mosse.
                  
                  
                     Old Trees are more Mossy, (farre) than Young; For that the Sap is 
not so francke as to rise all to the Boughes, but tireth by the way, and
putteth out Mosse.
                  
                  
                     Fountaines haue Mosse growing vpon the Ground about them; 
                     Muscosi Fontes;—
The Cause is, for that the Fountaines draine the Water from the Ground
Adiacent, and leaue but sufficient Moisture to breed Mosse: And besides,
the Coldnesse of the Water conduceth to the same.
                  The Mosse of Trees, is a kinde of Haire; For it is the Iuyce of the 
                     Tree, that is Excerned, and doth not Affimilate. And vpon great Trees
the Mosse gathereth a Figure, like a Leafe.
                  
                  The Moister Sort of Trees yeeld little Mosse; As we see in Aspes, Poplars,
Willowes, Beeches, &amp;c. Which is partly caused, for the Reason that
hath beene giuen, of the francke Putting vp of the Sap into the Boughes;
And partly, for that the Barkes of those Trees, are more Close and
Smooth, than those of Oakes, and Ashes; Whereby the Mosse can the
hardlier issue out.
                  In Clay-Grounds, all Fruit-Trees grow full of Mosse, both vpon Body
                     
and Boughes; Which is caused, partly by the Coldnesse of the Ground,
whereby the Plants nourish lesse; And partly by the Toughnesse of the
Earth, whereby the Sap is shut in, and cannot get vp, to spread so franckly,
as it should doe.
                  
                     
                      Wee haue said heretofore, that if Trees be Hide-bound, they wax
lesse Fruitfull, and gather Mosse: And that they are holpen by Hacking,
&amp;c. And therefore by the Reason of Contraries, if Trees be bound in
with Cords, or some Outward Bands, they will put forth more Mosse:
Which (I thinke) happeneth to Trees that stand Bleake, and vpon the
Cold Winds. It would also be tried, whether, if you couer a Tree,
somewhat thicke vpon the top, after his Powling, it will not gather
more Mosse. I thinke also, the Watring of Trees with Cold Fountaine-Water,
will make them grow full of Mosse.
                  
                  
                      There is a Mosse the Perfumers haue, which commeth out of AppleTrees,
that hath an Excellent Sent. Quare particularly for the Manner
of the Growth, and the Nature of it. And for this Experiments, sake, being
a Thing of Price, I haue set downe the last Experiments, how to multiply,
and call on Mosses.
                  
                  Next vnto Mosse, I will speake of Mushromes; Which are
likewise an Vnperfect Plant. These Mushromes haue two
strange Properties; The One, that they yeeld so Delicious a
Meat; The other, that they come vp so bastily; As in a Night;
And yet they are Vnsowne. And therefore, such as are Vpstarts
in State, they call, in reproch, Mushromes. It must needs bee
therefore, that they be made of much Moisture; And that
Moisture Fat, Grosse, and yet somewhat Concocted. And
(indeed) we finde, that Mushromes cause the Accident, which
we call Incubus, or the Mare, in the Stomacke. And therefore
the Surfet of them may Suffocate, and Empoyson. And this
sheweth, that they are Windy; And that Windinesse is Grosse,
and Swelling; Not Sharpe, or Griping. And vpon the same
reason Mushromes are a venereous Meat.
                  
                      It is reported, that the Barke of White, or Red Poplar, (which are of
the Moistest of Trees,) cut small, and cast into Furrowes well dunged, will
cause the Ground to put forth Mushromes, at all Seasons of the Yeare, fit
to be eaten. Some adde to the Mixture Leanen of Bread, resolued in
Water.
                  
                  
                      It is reported, that if a Hilly-Field, where the Stubble is standing,
bee set on Fire, in a Showry Season, it will put forth great Store of
Mushromes.
                  
                  
                      It is reported, that Harts-Horne, Shauen, or in Small Peeces, mixed
with Dung, and watred, putteth vp Mushromes. And we know HartsHorne
is of a Fat and Clammy Substance: And it may be Oxe-Horne
would doe the like.
                  
                      It hath beene reported, though it be searce credible, that Iuy hath
growne out of a Stags-Horne; Which they suppose, did rather come

from a Confrication of the Horne vpon the Iuy than from the Horne it
selfe. There is not knowne any Substance, but Earth, and the Procedures
of Earth, (as Tile, Stone, &amp;c.) that yeeldeth any Mosse, or Herby Substance.
There may be Trial made of some Seeds, as that of Fennel-Seed, Mustard
Seed, and Rape-Seed, put into some little Holes, made in the Hornes of
Stags, or Oxen, to see if they will grow.
                  There is also another Vnperfect Plant, that (in shew) is like a great 
                     Mushrome: And it is sometimes as broad as ones Hat; Which they call
a Toads-Stoole: But it is not Esculent; And it groweth (commonly) by
a dead Stub of a Tree; And likewise about the Roots of Rotten Trees:
And therefore seemeth to take his Iuyce from Wood Putrified. Which
sheweth, by the way, that Wood-Putrified yeeldeth a franke Moisture.
                  
                  There is a Cake, that groweth vpon the Side of a Dead Tree, that 
hath gotten no Name, but it is large, and of a Chesnut Colour, and
hard, and pithy; Whereby it should seeme, that euen Dead Trees forget
not their Putting forth; No more than the Careasses of Mens Bodies,
that put forth Haire, and Nailes, for a Time.
                  There is a Cod, or Bag, that groweth commonly in the Fields; That 
at the first is hard like a Tennis-Ball, and white; And after groweth of a
Mushrome Colour, and full of light Dust vpon the Breaking: And is
thought to be dangerous for the Eyes, if the Powder get into them;
And to bee good for Kibes. Belike it hath a Corrosiue, and Fretting
Nature.
                  
                  There is an Herb called Iewes-Eare, that groweth vpon the Roots,
                     
and Lower Parts of the Bodies of Trees; Especially of Elders, and sometimes
Ashes. It hath a strange Property; For in Warme-water, it swelleth,
and openeth extremely. It is not greene, but of a dusky browne
Colour. And it is vsed for Squinancies, and Inflammations in the Throat;
Whereby it seemeth to haue a Mollifying, and Lenifying Vertue.
                  There is a Kinde of Spongy Excrescence, which groweth chiefly vpon 
the Roots of the Laser-Tree; And sometimes vpon Cedar, and other
Trees. It is very White, and Light, and Friable: Which we call Agarick.
It is famous in Physicke for the Purging of Tough flegme. And it is
also an excellent Opener for the Liuer: But Offensiue to the Stomack; And
in Taste it is, at the first, Sweet, and after Bitter.
                  
                  We finde no Super-Plant, that is a Formed Plant, but Misseltoe. They 
haue an idle Tradition, that there is a Bird, called a Missel-Bird, that feedeth
vpon a Seed, which many times shee cannot disgest, and so expelleth
it whole with her Excrement: which falling vpon a Bough of a Tree,
that hath some Rift, putteth forth the Misseltoe. But this is a Fable: For
it is not probable, that Birds should feed vpon that they cannot disgest.
But allow that, yet it cannot be for other Reasons: For First, it is found
but vpon certaine Trees; And those Trees beare no such Fruit, as may allure
that Bird to sit, and feed vpon them. It may be, that Bird feedeth
vpon the Misseltoe-Berries, and so is often found there; Which may haue
giuen occasion to the Tale. But that which maketh an End of the Question,

is, that Misseltoe hath beene found to put forth vnder the Boughes,
and not (onely) aboue the Boughes: So it cannot be any Thing that falleth
vpon the Bough. Misseltoe groweth chiefly vpon Crab-Trees, AppleTrees;
sometimes vpon Hasses; And rarely vpon Oakes; The Misseltoe
whereof is counted very Medicinall. It is cuer greene, Winter and Summer;
And beareth a White Glistering Berry: And it is a Plant, vtterly
differing from the Plant, vpon which it groweth. Two things therfore
may be certainly set downe: First, that Super-fatation must be by Abundance
of Sap, in the Bough that putteth it forth: Secondly, that that Sap
must be such, as the Tree doth excerne, and cannot affimilate; For else
it would goe into a Bough; And besides, it seemeth to be more Fat and
Vnctuous, than the Ordinary Sap of the Tree; Both by the Berry, which
is Clammy; And by that it continueth greene, Winter and Summer,
which the Tree doth not.
                  
                      This Experiment of Misseltoe may giue Light to other Practises.
Therefore Triall would be made, by Ripping of the Bough of a Crab-Tree,
in the Barke; And Watring of the Wound euery Day, with Warme Water
Dunged, to see if it would bring forth Misseltoe, or any such like
Thing. But it were yet more likely to try it, with some other Watring,
or Anointing, that were not so Naturall to the Tree, as Water is; As
Oyle, or Barme of Drinke, &amp;c. So they be such Things as kill not the
Bough.
                  
                  
                      It were good to try, what Plants would put forth, if they be forbidden
to put forth their Naturall Boughes: Poll therefore a Tree, and couer
it, some thicknesse, with Clay on the Top; And see what it will put
forth. I suppose it will put forth Roots; For so will a Cions, being turned
downe into Clay: Therefore, in this Experiment also, the Tree would be
closed with somewhat, that is not so Naturall to the Plant, as Clay is.
Try it with Leather, or Cloth, or Painting, so it be not hurtfull to the Tree.
And it is certaine, that a Brake hath beene knowne to grow out of a
Pollard.
                  
                  
                      A Man may count the Prickles of Trees to be a kinde of Excrescence;
For they will neuer be Boughes, nor beare Leaues. The Plants that haue
Prickles, are Thornes, blacke and white; Brier; Rose; Limon-Trees; CrabTrees;
Goose-Berry; Berbery; These haue it in the Bough, The Plants that
haue Prickles in the Leafe, are; Holly; Iuniper; Whin-bush; Thistle; Nettles
also haue a small Venemous Prickle; So hath Borrage a small prickle, but
harmelesse. The Cause must be Hasty Putting forth; Want of Moisture; And
the Closenesse of the Barke; For the Haste of the Spirit to put forth, and the
Want of Nourishment to put forth a Bough, and the Closenesse of the Barke,
cause Prickles in Boughes; And therefore they are euer like a Pyramis,
for that the Moisture spendeth after a little Putting forth. And for
Prickles in Leaues, they come also of Putting forth more Iuyce into the
Leafe, than can spread in the Leafe smooth; And therefore the Leaues otherwise
are Rough, as Borrage and Nettles are. As for the Leaues of Holly,
they are Smooth, but neuer Plaine, but as it were with Folds, for the same
Cause.
                  
                  
                     There be also Plants, that though they haue no Prickles, yet they 
haue a Kinde of Downy or Veluet Rine, vpon their Leaues; As Rose Campion,
Stock-Gilly-Flowers, Colts-Foot; which Downe or Nap commeth of
a Subtill Spirit, in a Soft or Fat Substance. For it is certaine, that both
Stock-Gilly-Flowers, and Rose-Campions, stamped, haue beene applied,
with successe,) to the Wrests of those that haue had Tertian, or Quartan
Agues; And the Vapour of Colts-Foot hath a Sanatiue vertue, towards
the Lungs; And the Leafe also is Healing in Surgery.
                  
                  Another Kinde of Excrescence is an Exudation of Plants, ioyned with 
                     Putrefaction; As we see in Oake-Apples, which are found chiefly vpon
the Leaues of Oakes; And the like vpon Willowes: And Countrey People
haue a kinde of Prediction, that if the Oake-Apple, broken, be full of
Wormes, it is a Signe of a Pestilent Yeare; Which is a likely Thing, because
they grow of Corruption.
                  There is also vpon Sweet, or other Brier, a fine Tuse, or Brush of 
                     Mosse, of diuers Colours; Which if you cut, you shall euer finde full
of little white Wormes.
                  
                  It is certaine, that Earth taken out of the Foundations of Vaults and
Houses, and Bottomes of Wells, and then put into Pots, will put forth Sundry
Kindes of Herbs: But some Time is required, for the Germination;
For if it be taken, but from a Fathome deepe, it will put forth the First
Yeare; If much deeper, not till after a Yeare, or Two.

                  The Nature of the Plants growing out of Earth so taken vp, doth follow 
the Nature of the Mould it selfe; As if the Mould be Soft, and Fine,
it putteth forth Soft Herbs; As Grasse, Plantine, and the like; if the Earth
be Harder and Courser, it putteth forth Herbs more Rough, as Thistles,
Firres, &amp;c.
                  It is Common Experience, that where Alleyes are close Grauelled, the 
                     Earth putteth forth, the first yeare, Knot-grasse, and after Spire-grasse. The
Cause is, for that the Hard Grauell, or Pebble at the first Laying, will not
suffer the Grasse to come forth vpright, but turneth it to finde his way
where it can; But after that the Earth is somewhat loosened at the Top,
the Ordinary Grasse commeth vp.
                  It is reported, that Earth, being taken out of Shady and Watry 
Woods, some depth, and Potted, will put forth Herbs of a Fat and Iuycy
Substance; As Penny-wort, Purslane, Hausleeke, Penny-royall, &amp;c.
                  The Water also doth send forth Plants, that haue no Roots fixed in 
the Bottome; But they are lesse Perfect Plants, being almost but Leaues,
and those Small ones; Such is that we call Duck-Weed; Which hath a
Leafe no bigger than a Thyme-Leafe, but of a fresher Greene, and putteth
forth a little String into the Water, farre from the Bottome. As for
the Water-Lilly, it hath a Root in the Ground, And so haue a Number of
other Herbs that grow in Ponds.
                  
                  It is reported by some of the Ancients, and some Moderne Teftimony
                     
likewife, that there be some Plants, that grow vpon the Top of the Sea;

Being supposed to grow of some Concretion of Slime from the Water,
where the Sunne beateth hot, and where the Sea stirreth little. As for
Alga Marina, (Sea-weed,) and Eryngium (Sea-Thistle,) both haue Roots;
but the Sea-weed vnder the Water, the Sea-Thistle but vpon the Shore.
                  
                  
                      The Ancients haue noted, that there are some Herbs, that grow
out of Snow, laid vp close together, and Putrified; And that they are
all Bitter; And they name one specially, Flomus, which wee call MothMullein
It is certaine, that Wormes are found in Snow commonly, like
Earth-Wormes; And therefore it is not vnlike, that it may likewise put
forth Plants.
                  
                  
                      The Ancients haue affirmed, that there are some Herbs, that grow
out of Stone; Which may be, for that it is certain, that Toads haue been
found in the Middle of a Free-Stone. We see also, that Flints, lying
aboue Ground, gather Mosse; And Wall-Flowers, and some other Flowers,
grow vpon Walls; But whether vpon the Maine Bricke, or Stone, or whether
out of the Lime, or Chinckes, is not well obserued; For Elders and
Ashes haue beene seene to grow out of Steeples: But they manifestly
grow out of Clefts; In so much as when they grow big, they will disioyne
the Stone. And besides it is doubtfull, whether the Mortar it selfe putteth
it forth, or whether some Seeds be not let fall by Birds. There be
likewife Rock-Herbs; But I suppose those are, where there is some Mould,
or Earth.
It hath likewife beene found, that great Trees growing vpon
Quarries, haue put downe their Root into the Stone.
                  
                  
                      In some Mines in Germany, as is reported, there grow in the Bottome
Vegetables; And the Worke-Folkes vse to say, they haue Magicall Vertue;
And will not suffer Men to gather them.
                  
                      The Sea-Sands seldome beare Plants. Whereof the Cause is yeelded,
by some of the Ancients, for that the Sunne exhaleth the Moisture;
before it can incorporate with the Earth, and yeeld a Nourishment for
the Plant. And it is affirmed also, that Sand hath (alwayes) his Root in
Clay; And that there be no Veines of Sand, any great depth within the
Earth.
                  
                  
                      It is certaine, that some Plants put forth for a time, of their owne
Store, without any Nourishment from Earth, Water, Stone, &amp;c. Of which
Vide the Experiment 29.
                  It is reported, that Earth, that was brought out of the Indies, and other
Remote Countries, for Ballast of Ships, cast vpon some Grounds in Italy,
did put forth Fortaine Herbs, to vs in Europe not knowne; And, that

                     Plants brought out of Hot Countries, will endeuour to put forth, at
the same Time, that they vsually do in their owne Climate; And therfore
to preserue them, there is no more required, than to keepe them from
the Iniury of Putting backe by Cold. It is reported also, that Graine out

of the Hotter Countries translated into the Colder, will be more forward,
than the Ordinary Graine of the Cold Countrey. It is likely, that this will
proue better in Graines, than in Trees; For that Graines are but Annuall;
And so the Vertue, of the Seed is not worne out; Whereas in a Tree, it is
embased by the Ground, to which it is Remoued.
                  Many Plants, which grow in the Hotter Countries; being set in the 
                     Colder, will neucrthelesse, euen in those Cold Countries, being sowne of
Seeds, ate in the Spring, come vp and abide most Part of the Summer;
As we finde it in Orenge, and Limon-Seeds, &amp;c. The Seeds whereof,
Sowen in the End of Aprill, will bring forth Excellent Sallets, mingled
with other Herbs. And I doubt not, but the Seeds of Cloue-Trees, and
Pepper-Seeds, &amp;c. if they could come hither Greene enough to be sowen,
would doe the like.
                  There be some Flowers, Blossomes, Graines, and Fruits, which come
more Early; And Others which come more Late in the Yeare.Experiments in Consort, touching the Seasons in which Plants come forth. The
Flowers that come early, with vs, are; Prime-Roses, Violets, Anemonies,
Water-Daffadillies, Crocus Vernus, and some early Tulippa's. And they
are all Cold Plants; Which therefore, (as it should seeme,) haue a quicker 
                     Perception, of the Heat of the Sunne Increasing, than the Hot Herbs
haue; As a Cold Hand will sooner finde a little Warmth, than a Hot. And
those that come next after, are Wall-Flowers, Cowflips, Hyacinths, Rosemary-Flowers,
&amp;c. And after them, Pincks, Roses, Flowerdelnces, &amp;c.
And the latest are Gilly-Flowers, Holly-oakes, Larkes-Foot, &amp;c. The Earliest
Blossomes are, the Blossomes of Peaches, Almonds, Cornelians, Mezerions,
&amp;c. And they are of such Trees, as haue much Moisture, either Watrie,
or Oylie. And therefore Grocus Vernus also, being an Herbe, that
hath, an Oylie luyce, putteth forth early. For those also finde the Sunne
sooner than the Drier Trees. The Graines are, first Rye and Wheat; Then
Oats and Barley; Then Pease and Beanes. For though Greene Pease and
Beanes be eaten sooner, yet the Drie Ones, that are vsed for Horse-Meat,
are ripe last; And it seemeth that the Fatter Graine commeth first. The
Earliest Fruits are, Strawberries, Cherries, Gooseberries, Corrans; And
after them Early Apples, Early Peares, Apricots, Rasps; And after them
Damasins, and most Kinde of Plums, Peaches, &amp;c. And the latest are
Apples, Wardens, Grapes, Nuts, Quinces, Almonds, Sloes, Brier-Berries,
Heps, Medlars, Seruices, Cornelians, &amp;c.
                  It is to be noted, that (commonly) Trees that ripen latest, blossome 
soonest: As Peaches, Cornelians, Sloes, Almonds, &amp;c. And it seemeth to
be a Worke of Prouidence, that they blossome so soone; For otherwise,
they could not haue the Sunne long enough to ripen.
                  There be Fruits, (but rarely,) that come twice a Teare; as some Peares,
Strawberries, &amp;c. And it seemeth they are such, as abound with Nourishment;
Whereby after one Period, before the Sunne waxeth too
weake, they can endure another. The Violet also, amongst Flowers,
commeth twice a Yeare; Especially the Double White; And that also

is a Plant full of Moisture. Roses come twice, but it is not without Ca

                      In Muscbuia, though the Corne come not vp, till late Spring, yet their
Haruest is as Early as Ours. The Cause is, for that the Strength of the
Ground is kept in with the Snow; And wee see with vs, that if it be a
long Winter, it is commonly a more Plentifull Teare: And after those
kinde of Winters likewise, the Flowers, and Corne, which are Earlier, and
Later, doe come commonly at once, and at the same time; Which
troubleth the Husbandman many times; For you sh

and Damaske Roses, come together; And likewise the Harnest of Wheat
and Barley. But this happeneth euer, for that the Earlier staieth for the
Later; And not that the Later commeth sooner.
                  
                      There be diuers Fruit-Trees, in the Hot Countries, which haue Blossomes,
and Young Fruit, and Ripe Fruit, almost all the Yeare, succeeding
one another. And it is said, the Orenge hath the like with vs, for a great
Part of Summer; And so also hath the Figge. And no doubt, the Naturall
Motion of Plants, is to haue so; But that either they want luyce to
spend; Or they meet with the Cold of the Winter: And therefore this
Circle of Ripening cannot be, but in Succulent Plants, and Hot Countries.
                  
                  
                      Some Herbs are but Annuall, and die, Root and all, once a Yeare; As
Borrage, Lettuce, Cucumbers, Muske-Melons, Bafill, Tobacco, Mustard-Seed,
and all kindes of Corne; Some continue many Yeares; As Hyssope,
Germander, Lanander, Fennell, &amp;c. The Cause of the Dying is double;
The first is the Tendernesse and Weaknesse of the Seed, which maketh the
Period in a small time; As it is in Borrage, Lettnce, Cucumbers, Corne, &amp;c.
And therefore none of these are Hot. The other Cause is, for that some
Herbs can worse endure Cold; As Basill, Tobacco, Mustard-Seed. And
these haue (all) much Heat.
                  
                  The Lasting of Plants is most in those that are Largest of Body; As
Oakes, Elme, Ches-Nut, the Loat-Tree, &amp;c. And this holdeth in Trees;
But in Herbs it is often contrary; For borage, Colewort, Pompions, which
are Herbs of the Largest Size, are of small Durance; Whereas Hyssope,
 Winter-Sauoury, Germander, Thyme, Sage, will last long.Experiments in Consort touching the Lasting of Herbs and Trees.
                      The Cause is,
for that Trees last according to the Strength, and Quantitie of their Sap
and Iuyce; Being well munited by their Barke against the Iniuries of the
Aire: But Herbs draw a Weake luyce; And haue a Soft Stalke; And
therefore those amongst them which last longest, are Herbs of Strong
Smell, and with a Sticky Stalke.
                  
                  
                     
                     Trees that beare Mast, and Nuts, are commonly more lasting, than
those that beare Fruits; Especially the Moister Fruits: As Oakes, Beeches,
Chesnuts, Wall-nuts, Almonds, Pine-Trees, &amp;c. last longer than Apples,
Peares, Plums, &amp;c. The Cause is the Fatnesse and Oylinesse of the Sap;
Which euer wasteth lesse, than the more Watry.
                  
                  
                     
                     Trees, that bring forth their Leaues late in the Yeare, and cast them likewise
late, are more lasting, than those that sprout their Leaues Early, or

shed them betimes. The Cause is, for that the late Comming forth sheweth
a Moisture more fixed; And the other more loose, and more easily resolued,
And the same Cause is, that Wilde-Trees last longer than Garden-Trees;
And in the same kinde, those whose Fruit is Acide, more than
those whose Fruit is sweet.
                  Nothing procureth the Lasting of Trees, Bushes, and Herbs, so much,
as often Cutting: For euery Cutting causeth a Renouation of the Iuyee of
the Plant; That it neither goeth so farre, nor riseth so faintly, as when
the Plant is not Cut: Insomuch as Annuall Plants, if you cut them seasonably,
and will spare the vse of them, and suffer them to come vp still
young, will last more Yeares than one; As hath beene partly touched;
Such as is Lettuce, Purslane, Cucumber, and the like. And for Great Trees,
we see almost all Ouer-growne-Trees, in Church-yards, or neare Ancient
Buildings, and the like, are Pollards, or Dottards, and not Trees at their
full Height.
                  Some Experiment would be made, how by Art to make Plants more 
                     Lasting, than their ordinary Period; As to make a Stalke of Wheat, &amp;c.
last a whole yeare. You must euer presuppose, that you handle it so, as
the Winter killeth it not; For we speake onely of Prolonging the Naturall
Period. I conceiue, that the Rule will hold; That whatsoeuer maketh
the Herbe come later, than at his time, will make it last longer time: It
were good to try it, in a Stalke of Wheat, &amp;c. set in the Shade, and encompassed
with a Case of Wood, not touching the Straw, to keepe out
Open Aire.
                  
                  As for the Preseruation of Fruits, and Plants, as well vpon the Tree,
or Stalke, as gathered, we shall handle it vnder the Title of Conseruation of
Bodies.
                  
                  The Particular Figures of Plants we leaue to their Descriptions;
                     Experiments in Consort touching the seuerall Figures of Plants.
                      But
some few Things, in generall, we will obserue. Trees and Herbs, in the
Growing forth of their Boughes, and Branches, are not Figured, and keep
no Order. The Cause is, for that the Sap, being restrained in the Rinde,
and Barke, breaketh not forth at all; (As in the Bodies of Trees, and 
                     Stalkes of Herbs.) till they begin to branch; And then, when they make
an Eruption, they breake forth casually, where they finde best way, in
the Barke, or Rinde. It is true, that some Trees are more scattered in their
Boughes; As Sallow-Trees, Warden-Trees, Quince-Trees, Medlar-Trees, Limon-Trees,
&amp;c. Some are more in the forme of a Pyramis, and come almost
to todd; As the Peare-Tree, (which the Critickes will haue to borrow
his name of 
                        ••
                     , Fire,) Orenge-Trees, Firre-Trees, Service-Trees, LimeTrees,
&amp;c. And some are more spred and broad; As Beeches, Hornebeame,
&amp;c. The rest are more indifferent. The Cause of Scattering the Boughes,
is the Hasty breaking forth of the Sap; And therefore those Trees rise
not in a Body of any Height, but branch neare the Ground. The Cause
of the Pyramis, is the Keeping in of the Sap, long before it branch; And
the spending of it when it beginneth to branch, by equall degrees. The

                     Spreading is caused by the Carrying vp of the Sap, plentifully, without
Expence; And then putting it forth speedily, and at once.
                  
                      There be diuers Herbs, but no Trees, that may be said to haue some
kinde of Order, in the Putting forth of their Leaues: For they haue
Ioynts, or Knuckles, as it were Stops in their Germination; As haue GillyFlowers,
Pinckes, Fennell, Corne, Reeds, and Canes. The Cause whereof is,
for that the Sap asoendeth vnequally, and doth (as it were) tire and stop
by the way. And it seemeth, they haue some Closenesse, and Hardnesse
in their Stalke, which bindreth the Sap from going vp, vntill it hath gathered
into a Knot, and so is more vrged to put forth. And therefore,
they are most of them hollow, when the Stalke is dry. As Fennell-Stalke,
Stubble, and Canes.
                  
                  
                     
                     Flowers haue (all) exquisite Figures; And the Flower-Numbers are
(chiefly) Fiue, and Foure; As in Prime-Roses, Brier-Roses, Single MuskeRoses,
Single Pinkes, and Gilly-Flowers, &amp;c. which haue fiue Leaues:
Lillies, Flower-de-luces, Borage, Buglosse, &amp;c. which haue foure Leaues.
But some put forth Leaues not Numbered; But they are euer small Ones;
As Mary-Golds, Trisoile, &amp;c. We see also, that the Sockets, and Supporters
of Flowers, are Figured; As in the Fiue Brethren of the Rose; Sockets
of Gilly-Flowers, &amp;c. Leaues also are all Figured, Some Round, Some
Long; None Square; And many iagged on the Sides; Which Leaues
of Flowers seldome are. For I account the Iagging of Pinkes, and GillyFlowers,
to be like the Inequality of Oake-leaues, or Vine-leaues, or the
like; But they seldome or neuer haue any small Purles.
                  
                  Of Plants,
                     Experiments in Consort, touching some Principal
                              •
                            Differences in Plants.
                      some few put forth their Blossomes before their Leaues;
As Almonds, Peaches, Cornelians, Black-Thorne, &amp;c. But most put forth
some Leaues before their Blossomes; As Apples, Peares, Plums, Cherries,
White-Thorne, &amp;c. The Cause is, for that those, that put forth their Blossomes
                      first, haue either an Acute and Sharpe Spirit; (And therfore commonly
they all put forth earely in the Spring, and ripen very late; As
most of the Particulars before mentioned;) Or else an Oyly Iuyce, which
is apter to put out Flowers, than Leaues.
                  
                  
                      Of Plants, some are Greene all Winter; Others cast their Leaues. There
are Greene a
                        •
                     l Winter; Holly, Iny, Box, Firre, Eugh, Cypresse, Iuniper, Bayes,
Rose-Mary, &amp;c. The Cause of the Holding Greene, is the Close and Compact
Substance of their Leaues, and the Pedicles of them. And the Cause
of that againe, is either the Tough and Viscous Iuyce of the Plant; Or the
Strength and Heat thereof. Of the first Sort is Holly; Which is of so Viscous
a Iuyce, as they make Bird-lime of the Barke of it. The Stalke of Iuy
is Tough, and not Fragile, as we see in other small Twigs dry. Firre
yeeldeth Pitch. Box is a fast and heauy Wood, as we see it in Bowles. Eugh
is a Strong and Tough Wood, as we see it in Bowes. Of the second Sort is
Iuniper, which is a Wood Odorate, and maketh a hot Fire. Bayes is likewise
a Hot and Aromatical Wood; And so is Rose-Mary for a Shrub. As
for the Leaues, their Density appeareth, in that, either they are Smooth

and Shining, as in Bayes, Holly, Iuy, Box, &amp;c. Or in that they are Hard
and Spiry, as in the rest. And Triall would be made of Grasting of RoseMary,
and Bayes, and Box, vpon a Holly-Stocke; Because they are Planes
that come all Winter. It were good to try it also with Grafts of other
Trees, either Fruit-Trees, or Wilde-Trees; To see whether they will not
yeeld their Fruit, or beare their Leaues, later, and longer in the Winter;
because the Sap of the Holly putteth forth most in the Winter. It may
be also a Mexerion-Tree, grafted vpon a Holly, will proue both an Earlier,
and a Greater Tree.
                  
                  There be some Plants, that beare no Flower, and yet beare Fruit:
                     
There be some, that beare Flowers, and no Fruit: There be some that
beare neither Flowers, nor Fruit. Most of the great Timber-Trees, (as
Oakes, Beeches, &amp;c.) beare not apparent Flowers: Some few (likewise) of
the Fruit-Trees; As Mulberry, Wall-unt, &amp;c. And some Shrubs, (as Iuniper,
Holly, &amp;c.) beare no Flowers. Diuers Herbs also beare Seeds, (which
is as the Fruit,) and yet beare no Flowers; As Parslane, &amp;c. Those that
beare Flowers and no Fruit, are few; At the Double Cherry, the Sallow,
&amp;c. But for the Cherry, it is doubtfull, whether it be not by Art, or Culture;
For if it be by Art, then Triall would be made, whether Apples,
and other Fruits Blossomes, may not be doubled. There are some Few,
that beare neither Fruit, nor Flower; As the Elme, the Poplers, Box,
Brakes, &amp;c.
                  There be some Plants, that shoot still vpwards, and can Support
                     
themselues; As the greatest Part of Trees and Plants: There be some
Other, that Creepe along the Ground; Or Winde about other Trees, or
Props, and cannot support themselues; As Vines, Iuy, Briar, Briony, Woodbines,
Hop's, Climatis, Camomill, &amp;c. The Cause is, (as hath beene partly
touched,) for that all Plants, (naturally) moue vpwards; But if the Sap
put vp too fast, it maketh a slender Stalks, which will not support the
weight: And therefore these latter Sort are all Swift and Hasty Commers.
                  The first and most Ordinary Holpe is Stercoration.
                     Experiments in Consort touching all Manner of Composts, and Helps of Ground.
                      The Sheeps-Dung
is one of the best; And next, the Dung of Kine: And thirdly, that of
Horses: Which is held to be somewhat too hot, vnlesse it be mingled.
That of Pigeons for a Garden, or a small Quantity of Ground, excelleth.
The Ordering of Dung is; If the Ground be Arable, to spread it immediately
before the Plonghing and Sowing; And so to Plough it in: For 
if you spread it long before, the Sunne will draw out much of the Fatnesse
of the Dung: If the Ground be Grazing Ground, to spread it somewhat
late, towards Winter; That the Sunne may haue the lesse Power
to dry it vp. As for speciall Composts for Gardens, (as a Hot Bed, &amp;c.) we
haue handled them before.
                  The Second Kind of Compost, is, the Spreading of diuers Kinds of Earths;
                     
As Marle, Chalke, Sea-Sand, Earth vpon Earth, Pond-Earth; And the Mixtures
of them. Marle is thought to be the best; As hauing most Fatnesse;

And not Heating the Ground too much. The next is Sea-Sand; Which
(no doubt) obtaineth a speciall Vertue, by the Salt: For Salt is the first
Rudiment of life. Chalke ouer heateth the Ground a little. And therfore
is best vpon Gold Clay-Grounds, or Moist Grounds: But I heard a great Husband
say, that it was a common Errour, to thinke that Chalke helpeth
Arable Grounds, but helpeth not Grazing Grounds; Wheras (indeed) it helpeth,
Grasse, as well as Corne: But that which breedeth the Errour is, because
after the Chalking of the Ground, they weare it out with many Crops,
without Rest; And then (indeed) afterwards it will beare little Grasse,
because the Gound is tired out. It were good to try the laying of Chalke
vpon Arable Grounds, a little while before Ploughing; And to Plough it
in, as they doe the Dung; But then it must be Friable first, by Raine, or
Lying: As for Earth, it Copasseth it Selfe; For I knew a Great Garden, that
had a Field (in a manner) powred vpon it; And it did beare Fruit excellently
the first yeare of the Planting: For the Surface of the Earth is cuer
the Fruitfullest. And Earth so prepared hath a double Surface. But it is
true, as I cō
                     
                        •
                     eiue, that such Earth, as hath Salt-Petre bred in it, if you can
procure it without too much charge, doth excell. The way to hasten the
Breeding of Salt-Petre, is to forbid the Sunne, and the Growth of Vegetables,
And therefore, if you make a large Houell, thatched, ouer some
Quantity of Ground; Nay if you doe but Plancke the Ground ouer, it
will breed Salt-petre. As for Pond-Earth, or Riuer-Earth, it is a very good
Compost; Especially if the Pond haue beene long vncleansed, and so the
Water be not too Hungry: And I iudge it will be yet better, if there be
some Mixture of Chalke.
                  
                  
                      The Third Helpe of Ground, is, by some other Substances, that haue a
Vertue to make Ground Fertile; though they be not meerely Earth: wherin
Ashes excell; In so much as the Countries about AEtna, and Vesuuius,
haue a kinde of Amends made them, for the Mischiefe the Eruptions
(many times) doe, by the exceeding Fruit fulnesse of the Soyle, caused by
the Ashes, scattered about. Soot also, though thinne spred, in a Field, or
Garden, is tried to be a very good Compost. For Salt, it is too Costly: But
it is tryed, that mingled with Seed-Corne, and sowen together, it doth
good: And I am of Opinion, that Chalke in Powder, mingled with SeedCorne,
would doe good; Perhaps as much as Chalking the Ground all ouer.
As for the Steeping of the Seeds, in seuerall Mixtures with Water, to
giue them Vigour; Or Watring Grounds with Compost-Water; We haue
spoken of them before.
                  
                      The Fourth Helpe of Ground, is, the Suffering of Vegetables to dye into
the Ground; And so to Fatten it; As the Stubble of Corne, Especially PeaseBrakes
cast vpon the Ground, in the Beginning of Winter, will make it very
Fruitfull. It were good (also) to try, whether Leaues of Trees swept together,
with some Chalke and Dung mixed, to giue them more Heart,
would not make a good Compost: For there is nothing lost, so much as
Leaues of Trees; And as they lye scattered, and without Mixture, they
rather make the Ground soure, than otherwise.
                  
                     The Fifth Helpe of Ground, is Heat and Warmth. It hath beene anci

                      to burne Heath, and Ling, and Sedge, with the vantage of

                     Wind, vpon the Ground: Wee see, that Warmth of Walls and Enclo

                        ••
                     th Ground: We see againe, that the Foldings of Sheepe helpe Ground.
                     
                        〈…〉
                     ll by their Warmth, as by their Compost: And it may be doubted,

                        •••
                     ther the Couering of the Ground with Brakes, in the Beginning of the Winter, (where of we spake in the last Experiment,) helpeth it not, by reaso
                        •
                      of the Warmth. Nay some very good Husbands doe suspect, that the
Gathering vp of Flints, in Flinty Ground, and Laying them on Heapes,
(which is much vsed,) is no good Husbandry; For that they would keep
the Ground Warme.
                  The Sixth Helpe of Ground is, by Watering, and Irrigation; which is 
in two Munners: The one by Letting in, and Shutti gout Waters, at seasonable
Tunes: For Water, at some Seasons, and with reasonable
dry, deth good; But at some other Seasons, and with too long Stay,
doth 
                        •••
                     . And this serueth onely for Meadowes, which are along some
Rtuer. The other way is, to bring Water, from some Hanging Grounds,
where there are Springs, into the Lower Grounds, carrying it in some

                        •••
                      
                     Furrowes; And from those Furrowes, drawing it trauerse to spread
the Water. And this maketh an excellent Improuement, both for Corne,
and Grasse. It is the richer, if those Hanging Grounds be fruitfull, because
it washeth off some of the Fatnesse of the Earth: But howsoeuer it profiteth
much. Generally, where there are great Ouerflowes, in Fens, or
the like, the drowning of them in the Winter, maketh the Summer following
more fruitfull: The Cause may be, for that it keepeth the Ground
warme, and nourisheth it: But the Fen-Men hold, that the Sewers must
be kept so, as the Water may not stay too long in the Spring, til the Weeds
and Sedge be growne vp; For then the Ground will be like a Wood,
which keepeth out the Sunne; And so continueth the Wet; Whereby
it will peuer graze (to purpose) that yeare. Thus much for Irrigation.
But for Anoydances, and Draynings of water, where
there is too much, and the Helps of Ground in
that kinde, wee shall speake of
them in another
Place.
               
               
                  
                  
                  NATVRALL
HISTORIE.
                  VII. Century.
                  THe Differences betweene Animate and Inanimate
Bodies,
                     Experiments in Consort, touching the Assinities, and Differences, betweene Plants and Inanimate Bodies.
                      we shall handle fully vnder the
Title of Life, and Liuing Spirits, and Powers.
We shall therefore make but a briefe Mention
of them in this Place. The Maine Differences
are two. All Bodies haue Spirits,
and Pneumaticall Parts within them: But the 
Maine Differences betweene Animate and
Inanimate, are two: The first is, that the
Spirits of Things Animate, are all Continued
with themselues, and are Branched in Veines, and secret Canales, as Bloud
is: And in Liuing Creatures, the Spirits haue not only Branches, but certaine
Cells or Seats, where the Principall Spirits doe reside, and whereunto
the rest doe resort: But the Spirits in Things Inanimate are shut in,
and cut off by the Tangible Parts; And are not peruious one to another;
As Aire is in Snow. The Second Maine Difference is, that the Spirits of
Animate Bodies, are all in some degree, (more or lesse,) kindled and inflamed;
And haue a fine Commixture of Flame, and an Aeriall Substance.
But Inanimate Bodies haue their Spirits no whit Inflamed, or Kindled.
And this Difference consisteth not in the Heat or Coolenesse of Spirits;
For Cloues and other Spices, Naphtha and Petroleum, haue exceeding
Hot Spirits, (hotter a great deale than Oyle, Wax, or Tallow, &amp;c.) but not
Inflamed. And when any of those Weake and Temperate Bodies come

to be Inflamed, then they gather a much greater Heat, than others haue
Vn-inflamed; besides their Light, and Motion, &amp;c.
                  
                      The Differences, which are Secondary, and proceed from these two
Radicall Differences, are; First, Plants are all Figurate and Determinate,
which Inanimate Bodies are not; For looke how farre the Spirit is able to
Spread and Continue it selfe; So farre goeth the Shape, or Figure; And
then is determined. Secondly, Plants doe nourish; Inanimate Bodies doe
not: They haue an Accretion, but no Alimentation. Thirdly, Plants haue
a Period of Life; which Inanimate Bodies haue not. Fourthly, they haue a
Succession, and Propagation of their Kinde; which is not in Bodies Inanimate.
                  
                  
                      The Differences betweene Plants, and Metalls or Fossiles, besides those
foure before mentioned, (For Metalls I hold Inanimate,) are these: First,
Metalls are more Durable than Plants: Secondly, they are more Solid and
Hard: Thirdly, they are wholly Subterrany; Whereas Plants are part
aboue Earth, and part vnder Earth.
                  
                  
                      There be very few Creatures, that participate of the Nature of Plants,
and Metalls both; Corall is one of the Nearest of both Kindes: Another is
Vitrioll, for that is aptest to sprout with Moisture.
                  
                  
                      Another speciall Affinitie is betweene Plants and Mould or Putrefaction:
For all Putrefaction (if it dissolue not in Arefaction) will in the
end issue into Plants, or Liuing Creatures bred of Putrefaction. I account
Mosse, and Mushromes, and Agaricke, and other of those kindes, to be but
Moulds of the Ground, Walls, and Trees, and the like. As for Flesh, and
Fish, and Plants themselues, and a Number of other things, after a Mouldinesse,
or Rottensesse, or Corrupting, they will fall to breed Wormes.
These Putrefactions, which haue Affinitie with Plants, haue this Difference
from them; That they haue no Succession or Propagation, though
they Nourish, and haue a Period of Life, and haue likewise some Figure.
                  
                  
                      I left once, by chance, a Citron cut, in a close Roome, for three Summer-Moneths,
that I was absent; And at my Returne, there were grown
forth, out of the Pith cut, Tufts of Haires, an Inch long, with little blacke
Heads, as if they would haue beene some Herbe.

                         of them
are these that follow. They haue both of them Spirits Continued, and
Branched, and also Inflamed: But first in Liuing Creatures, the Spirits
haue a Cell or Seat, which Plants haue not; As was also formerly said:
And secondly, the Spirits of Liuing Creatures hold more of Flame, than
the Spirits of Plants doe. And these two are the Radicall Differences. For
the Secondary Differences, they are as follow. First, Plants are all Fixed
to the Earth; Whereas all Liuing Creatures are seuered, and of themselues.
 Secondly, Liuing Creatures haue Locall Motion; Plants haue not.
Thirdly, Liuing Creatures nourish from their Vpper Parts, by the Mouth
chiefly; Plants nourish from below, namely from the Roots. Fourthly,
Plants haue their Seed and Seminall Parts vppermost; Liuing Creatures
                     
haue them lower-most: And therefore it was said, not elegantly alone,
but Philosophically; Homoest Planta inuerse; Man is like a Plant turned vpwards;
For the Root in Plants, is as the Head in Liuing Creatures. Fifthly,
Liuing Creatures haue a more exact Figure than Plants. Sixthly, Liuing
Creatures haue more Diuersity of Organs within their Bodies, and (as it
were) Inward Figures, than Plants haue. Seuenthly, Liuing Creatures haue
Sense, which Plants haue not. Eighthly, Liuing Creatures haue Voluntary
Motion, which Plants haue not.
                  For the Difference of Sexes in Plants, they are oftentimes by name 
distinguished; As Male-Piony, Female-Piony; Male-Rose-mary, FemaleRose
mary; Hee-Holly, Shee-Holly; &amp;c. but Generation by Copulation (certainly)
extendeth not to Plants. The nearest Approach of it, is between
the Hee-Palme, and the Shee-Palme; which, (as they report,) if they
grow neare, incline the One to the other: In so much as, (that which
is more strange,) they doubt not to report, that to keepe the Trees vpright
from Bending, they tye Ropes, or Lines, from the one to the other,
that the Contact might be enjoyed by the Contact of a Middle Body. But
this may be Faigned, or at least Amplified. Neuerthelesse, I am apt
enough to thinke, that this same Binarium of a Stronger and a Weaker,
like vnto Masculine and Feminine, doth hold in all Liuing Bodies. It is confounded
sometimes; As in some Creatures of Putrefaction, wherein no
Markes of Distinction appeare: And it is doubled sometimes; As in
Hermaphrodites: But generally there is a Degree of Strength in most
Species.
                  
                  The Participles or Consiners betweene Plants and Liuing Creatures, are 
such chiefly, as are Fixed, and haue no Locall Motion of Remoue, though
they haue a Motion in their Parts; Such as are Oysters., Cockles, and such
like. There is a Fabulous Narration, that in the Northerne Countries,
there should be an Herbe that groweth in the likenesse of a Lambe, and
feedeth vpon the Grasse, in such sort, as it will bare the Grasse round about.
But I suppose, that the Figure maketh the Fable; For so we see,
there be Bee-Flowers, &amp;c. And as for the Grasse, it seemeth the Plant,
hauing a great Stalke and Top, doth prey vpon the Grasse, a good way about, by drawing the Iuyce of the Earth from it.

                      in one yeare, as of
it selfe it taketh Root againe: And so multiplieth from Root to Root;
Making of one Tree a kinde of Wood. The Cause is the Plenty of the Sap,
and the Softnesse of the Stalke, which maketh the Bough, being ouerloaden,
and not stiffely vpheld, weigh downe. It hath Leaues, as broad
as a little Target, but the Fruit no bigger than Beanes. The Cause is, for
that the Continuall Shade increaseth the Leaues, and abateth the Fruit;
which neuerthelesse is of a pleasant Taste. And that (no doubt) is caused,
by the Supplenesse and Gentlenesse of the Iuyce of that Plant, being
that which maketh the Boughes also so Flexible.
                  It is reported by one of the Ancients, that there is a certaine Indian
                     
                     
                     Tree, hauing few, but very great, Leaues, three Cubits long, and two
broad; And that the Fruit, being of good Taste, groweth out of the
Barke. It may be, there be Plants, that poure out the Sap so fast, as they
haue no leisure, either to diuide into many Leaues, or to put forth Stalks
to the Fruit. With vs Trees (generally) haue finall Leaues, in comparison.
The Fig hath the greatest; And next it the Vine, Mulberry, and Sycamore;
And the Least are those of the Willow, Birch, and Thorne. But
there be found Herbs with farre greater Leaues than any Tree; As the
Burre, Gourd, Cucumber, and Cole-wort. The Cause is, (like to that of the
Indian Fig,) the hasty and plentifull Putting forth of the Sap.
                  
                  
                      There be three Things in vse for Sweetnesse; Sugar, Honey, Manna.
For Sugar, to the Ancients it was scarce knowne, and little vsed. It is
found in Canes: Quare, whether to the first Knuckle, or further vp? And
whether the very Barke of the Cane it selfe do yeeld Sugar, or no? For Honey,
the Bee maketh it, or gathereth it; But I haue heard from one, that
was industrious in Husbandry, that the labour of the Bee is about the
Wax; And that he hath knowne in the beginning of May, Honey-Combs
empty of Honey; And within a forthnight, when the Sweet Dewes fall,
filled like a Cellar. It is reported also by some of the Ancients, that there
is a Tree called Occhus, in the Valleyes of Hyrcanis, that distilleth Honey
in the Mornings. It is not vnlike, that the Sap and Teares of some Trees,
may be sweet. It may be also, that some sweet Iuyces, fit for many vses,
may be concocted out of Fruits, to the Thicknesse of Honey, or perhaps
of Sugar; The likeliest are Raisins of the Sunne, Figs, and Corrans: The
Meanes may be enquired.
                  
                      The Ancients report of a Tree, by the Persian Sea, vpon the ShoreSands,
which is nourished with the Salt-Water; And when the Tide ebbeth,
you shall see the Roots, as it were, bare without Barke, (being as it
seemeth corroded by the Salt,) &amp; grasping the Sands like a Crab; Which
neuerthelesse beareth a Fruit. It were good to try some Hard Trees, as a
Seruice-Tree, or Firre-Tree, by setting them within the Sands.
                  
                  
                      There be of Plants, which they vse for Garments, these that follow.
Hempe; Flax; Cotton; Nettles, (whereof they make Nettle-Cloth;) Sericum,
which is a Growing Silke; They make also Cables of the Barke of
Lime-Trees. It is the Stalke that maketh the Filaceous Matter, commonly;
And sometimes the Downe that groweth aboue.
                  
                      They haue, in some Countries, a Plant of a Rosy Colour, which shutteth
in the Night, Openeth in the Morning, and Openeth wide at Noone;
which the Inhabitants of those Countries say is a Plant that Sleepeth. There
be Sleepers enow then; For almost all Flowers doe the like.
                  
                      Some Plants there are, but rare, that haue a Mossy or Downy Root;
And likewise that haue a Number of Threds, like Beards; As Mandrakes;
wherof Witches and Impostours make an vgly Image, giuing it the Forme
of a Face at the Top of the Root, and leaue those Strings to make a broad
Beard downe to the Foot. Also there is a Kinde of Nard, in Creet, (being
a Kinde of Phu) that hath a Root hairy, like a Rough-Footed-Doues
                     
foot, So as you may see, there are of Roots, Bulbous Roots, Fibrous Roots,
and Hirsute Roots. And, I take it, in the Bulbous, the Sap hasteneth most
to the Aire, and Sunne: In the Fibrous, the Sap dollghreth more in the
Earth, and therefore putteth downward: And the Hirsute is a Middle
betweene both; That besides the Putting forth vpwards, and downwards,
putteth forth in Round.
                  There are some Teares of Trees, which are kembed from the Beards of 
                     Goats: For when the Goats bite and crop them, especially in the Mornings,
the Dew being on, the Teare commeth forth, and hangeth vpon
their Beards: Of this Sort is some kinde of Ladanum.
                  
                  The Irrigation of the Plaine-Tree by Wine, is reported by the Ancients,
                     
to make it Fruitfull. It would be tried likewise with Roots; For vpon
Seeds it worketh no great Effects.
                  The way to carry Farraine Roots, a long Way, is to vessell them 
close in Earthan Vessells. But if the Vessells be not very Great, you must
make some Holes in the Bottome, to giue some Refreshment to the
Roots; Which otherwise (as it seemeth) will decay, and suffocate.
                  The ancient Cinnamon, was, of all other Plants, while it grew, the 
Dryest; And those Things, which are knowne to comfort other Plants,
did make that more Sterill: For in Showers it prospered worst: It grew
also amongst Bushes of other kindes, where commonly Plants doe not
thriue: Neither did it loue the Sunne: There might be one Cause of all
those Effects; Namely, the sparing Nourishment, which that Plant required.
Quare how farre Cassia, which is now the Substitute of Cinnamon,
doth participate of these Things.
                  It is reported by one of the Ancients that Cassia when it is gathered,
is put into the Skins of Beasts, newly fleyed; And that the Skins Corrupting,
and Breeding Wormes, the Wormes doe deuoure the Pith and
Marrow of it, and so make it Hollow; But meddle not with the Barke,
because to them it is bitter.
                  There were, in Ancient Time, Vines, of farre greater Bodies, than 
we know any; For there haue beene Cups made of them, and an Image
of Iupiter. But it is like they were Wilde-Vines; For the Vines, that they
vse for Wine, are so often Cut, and so much Digged and Dressed, that
their Sap spendeth into the Grapes, and so the Stalke cannot increase
much in Bulke. The Wood of Vines is very durable, without Rotting. And
that which is strange, though no Tree hath the Twigges, while they are
greene, so brittle, yet the Wood dryed is extreme Tough; And was vsed
by the Captaines of Armies, amongst the Romans, for their Cudgells.
                  
                  It is reported, that in some Places, Vines are suffered to grow like 
                     Herbs, spreading vpon the Ground; And that the Grapes of those Vines
are very great. It were good to make tryall, whether Plants that vse to
be borne vp by Props, will not put forth greater Leaues, and greater
Fruits, if they be laid along the Ground; As Hops, l
                           •
                        y, Wood bine, &amp;c.
                  
                     Quinces, or Apples, &amp;c. if you will keepe them long, drowne them 
in Honey; But because Honey (perhaps) will giue them a Taste Ouerlushious,

it were good to make Triall in Powder of Sugar; Or in Syrrup
of Wine onely Boyled to Height. Both these would likewise be tried in
Orenges, Limons, and Pomgranats; For the Powder of Sugar, and Syrrup
of Wine, will serue for more times than once.
                  
                      The Conseruation of Fruit would be also tried in Vessells, filled with
fine Sand, or with Powder of Chalke; Or in Meale and Flower; Or in Dust
of Oake-wood; Or in Mill.
                  
                  
                      Such Fruits, as you appoint for Long Keeping, you must gather before
they be full Ripe; And in a Faire and Dry Day, towards Noone; And
when the Wind bloweth not South; And when the Moone is vnder the
Earth; And in Decrease.
                  
                  
                      Take Grapes, and hang them in an Empty Vessell, well Stopped; And
set the Vessell, not in a Cellar, but in some dry Place; And it is said, they
will last long. But it is reported by some, they will keepe better, in a
Vessell halfe full of Wine, so that the Grapes touch not the Wine.
                  
                  
                      It is reported, that the Preseruing of the Stalke, helpeth to preserue
the Grape; Especially if the Stalke be put into the Pith of Elder, the Elder
not touching the Fruit.
                  
                  
                      It is reported by some of the Ancients, that Fruit put in Bottles, and
the Bottles let downe into Wells vnder Water, will keepe long.
                  
                      Of Herbs and Plants, some are good to eat Raw; As Lettuce, Endiue,
Purslane, Tarragon, Cresses, Cucumbers, Muske-Melons, Radish, &amp;c. Others
onely after they are Boyled, or haue Passed the Fire; As Parsley, Clary,
Sage, Parsnips, Turnips, Asparagus, Artichoakes, (though they also being
young are eaten Raw:) But a Number of Herbs are not Esculent at all;
As Worme-wood, Grasse, Greeke-Corne, Centory, Hyssope, Lauender, Balme,
&amp;c. The Causes are, for that the Herbs, that are not Esculent, do want the
two Tastes, in which Nourishment resteth; Which are, Fat, and Sweet;
And haue (contrariwise) Bitter and Ouer-strong Tastes, or a Iuyce so
Crude, as cannot be ripened to the degree of Nourishment. Herbes and
Plants, that are Esculent Raw, haue Fatnesse, or Sweetnesse, (as all Esculent
Fruits;) Such are Onions, Lettuce, &amp;c. But then it must be such a
Fatnesse, (for as for Sweet Things, they are in effect alwayes Esculent,) as
is not Ouer-grosse, and Loading of the Stomach; For Parsnips and Leeks
haue Fatnesse; But it is too Grosse and Heauy without Boyling. It must
be also in a Substance somewhat Tender; For we see Wheat, Barley, Artichoakes,
are no good Nourishment, till they haue Passed the Fire; But
the Fire doth ripen, and maketh them soft and tender, and so they become
Esculent. As for Radish, and Tarragon, and the like, they are for
Condiments, and not for Nourishment. And euen some of those Herbes,
which are not Esculent, are notwithstanding Poculent; As Hop's, Broome,
&amp;c. Quare what Herbs are good for Drinke, besides the two aforenamed;
For that it may (perhaps) ease the Charge of Brewing, if they
make Beere to require lesse Malt, or make it last longer.
                  
                     
                     Parts fit for the Nourishment of Man, in Plants, are, Seeds, Roots, and
Fruits; But chiefly Seeds, and Roots. For Leaues, they giue no Nourishment,
                     
at all, or very little: No more doe Flowers, or Blossomes, or Stalkes.
The Reason is, for that Roots, and Seeds, and Fruits, (in as much as all
Plants consist of an Oyly and Watry Substance commixed,) haue more of
the Oyly Substance; And Leaues, Flowers, &amp;c. of the Watry. And secondly,
they are more Concocted; For the Root, which continueth euer in the
Earth, is still Concocted by the Earth. And Fruits, and Graines, (we see)
are halfe a yeare, or more, in Concocting; Whereas Leaues are out, and
Perfect in a Moneth.
                  
                     Plants (for the most part) are more strong, both in Taste, and Smell,
                     
in the Seed, than in the Leafe, and Root. The Cause is, for that in Plants,
that are not of a Fierce and Eager Spirit, the Vertue is increased by
Concoction, and Maturation, which is euer most in the Seed; But in Plants,
that are of a Fierce and Eager Spirit, they are stronger whilest the Spirit
is enclosed in the Root; And the Spirits doe but weaken, and dissipate,
when they come to the Aire, and Sunne; As we see it in Onions, Garlicke,
Dragon, &amp;c. Nay there be Plants, that haue their Roots very Hot, and
Aromaticall; And their Seeds rather Insipide; As Ginger. The Cause is (as
was touched before,) for that the Heat of those Plants is very Dissipable;
which vnder the Earth is contained and held in; But when it commeth
to the Aire, it exhaleth.
                  The Iuyces of Fruits are either Watry, or Oyly. I reckon amongst 
the Watry, all the Fruits out of which Drinke is expressed; As the Grape,
the Apple, the Peare, the Cherry, the Pomgranate, &amp;c. And there are some
others, which, though they be not in vse for Drinke, yet they appeare to
be of the same Nature; As Plummes, Serukes, Mulberries, Rasps, Orenges,
Limons, &amp;c. And for those Iuyces, that are so fleshy, as they cannot
make Drinke by Expression, yet (perhaps) they may make Drinke by
Mixture of Water;
                     Pocula
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         admistis imitantur vitea Sorbis.
And it may be Heps and Brier-Berries would doe the like. Those that
haue Oyly Iuyce, are; Oliues, Almonds, Nuts of all sorts, Pine-Apples, &amp;c.
And their Iuyces are all Inflammable. And you must obserue also, that
some of the Watry Iuyces, after they haue gathered Spirit, will Burne and
Enflame; As Wine. There is a Third Kinde of Fruit, that is sweet, without
either Sharpnesse, or Oylinesse: Such as is the Fig, and the Date.
                  
                  It hath beene noted, that most Trees, and specially those that beare 
                     Mast, are fruitfull but once in two yeares. The Cause (no doubt) is, the
Expence of Sap; For many Orchard-Trees, well Cultured, will beare diuers
yeares together.
                  There is no Tree, which besides the Naturall Fruit, doth beare so many 
                     Bastard-Fruits, as the Oake doth: For besides the Acorne, it beareth
Galls, Oake-Apples, and certaine Oake-Nuts, which are Inflammable; And
certaine Oake-Berries, sticking close to the Body of the Tree, without
Stalke. It beareth also Misseltoe, though rarely. The Cause of all these
may be, the Closenesse and Solidenesse of the Wood, and Pith of the Oake;
Which maketh seuerall Iuyces finde seuerall Eruptions. And therefore,

if you will deuise to make any Super-Plants, you must euer giue the Sap
Plentifull Rising, and Hard Issue.
                  
                      There are two Excrescences, which grow vpon Trees; Both of them
in the Nature of Mushromes: The one the Romans called Boletus; Which
groweth vpon the Roots of Oakes; And was one of the Dainties of their
Table; The other is Medicinall, that is called Agaricke, (whereof we haue
spoken before,) which groweth vpon the Tops of Oakes; Though it be
affirmed by some, that it groweth also at the Roots. I doe conceiue, that
many Exerescences of Trees grow chiefly, where the Tree is dead, or faded;
For that the Naturall Sap of the Tree, corrupteth into some Preternaturall
Substance.
                  
                  
                      The greater Part of Trees beare Most, and Best, on the Lower Boughs;
As Oakes, Figs, Wall-Nuts, Peares, &amp;c. But some beare Best on the TopBoughes;
As Crabs, &amp;c. Those that beare best below, are such, as Shade
doth more good to, than Hurt. For generally all Fruits beare best lowest;
Because the Sap tireth not, hauing but a short Way: And therefore in
Fruits spred vpon Walls, the Lowest are the Greatest, as was formerly
said; So it is the Shade that hindereth the Lower Boughes; Except it be
in such Trees, as delight in Shade; Or at least beare it well. And therfore,
they are either Strong Trees, as the Oake; Or else they haue large Leaues,
as the Wallnut and Fig; Or else they grow in Pyra
                           •
                        is, as the Peare. But
if they require very much Sunne, they beare best on the Top; As it is in
Crabs, Apples, Plummes, &amp;c.
                  
                      There be Trees, that beare best, when they begin to be Old; As Almonds,
Peares, Vines, and all Trees that giue Mast. The Cause is, for that all
Trees that beare Mast, haue an Oyly Fruit; And Young Trees haue a more
Watry Iuyce, and lesse Concocted; And of the same kinde also is the Almond.
The Peare likewise, though it be not Oyly, yet it requireth much
Sap, and well Concocted; For we see it is a Heauy Fruit, and Solide;
Much more than Apples, Plummes, &amp;c. As for the Vine, it is noted, that
it beareth more Grapes when it is Young; But Grapes that make better
Wine, when it is Old; For that the Iuyce is better Concocted: And wee
see that Wine is Insflammable; So as it hath a kinde of Oylinesse. But the
most Part of Trees, amongst wich are Apples, Plummes, &amp;c. beare best
when they are Young.
                  
                  
                      There be Plants, that haue a Milke in them, when they are Cut; As
Figs, Old Lettuce, Sowe-Thistles, Spurge, &amp;c. The Cause may be an Inception
of Putrefaction: For those Milkes haue all an Acrimony; though one
would thinke they should be Lenitiue. For if you write vpon Paper, with
the Milke of the Fig, the Letters will not be seene, vntill you hold the
Paper before the Fire, and then they wax Browne; Which sheweth that
it is a Sharpe or Fretting Iuyce: Lettuce is thought Poysonous, when it
is so Old, as to haue Milke; Spurge is a kinde of Poyson in it Selfe; And
as for Sowe-Thistles, though Coneyes eat them, yet Sheepe and Cattell will
not touch them; And besides the Milke of them, rubbed vpon
Warts, in short time, weareth them away: Which sheweth the Milke
                     
of them to be Corrosine. We see also, that Wheat, and other Corne sowen,
if you take them forth of the Ground, before they sprout, are full of
Milke; And the Beginning of Germination is euer a Kinde of Putrefaction
of the Seed. Euphorbium also hath a Milke, though not very white,
which is of a great Acrimony. And Saladine hath a yellow Milke, which
hath likewise much Acrimony; For it cleanseth the Eyes. It is good also
for Cataracts.
                  
                  
                     Mushromes are reported to grow, as well vpon the Bodies of Trees,
                     
as vpon their Roots, or vpon the Earth: And especially vpon the Oake.
The Cause is, for that Strong Trees, are towards such Excresc
                           ••
                        ces, in
the Nature of Earth; And therfore put forth Mosse, Mushromes, and
the like.
                  There is hardly found a Plant, that yeeldeth a Red Iuyce, in the Blade,
                     
or Eare; Except it be the Tree that beareth Sanguis Draconis: Which
groweth (chiefly) in the Island Soquotra: The Herb Amaranthus, (indeed,)
is Red all ouer; And Brasill is Red in the Wood: And so is Red Sunders.
That Tree of the Sanguis Draconis, groweth in the forme of a Sugar-loafe.
It is like, that the Sap of that Plant, concocteth in the Body of the Tree.
For woe see that Grapes, and Pomegranats, are Red in the Iuyce, but are
Greene in the Teare: And this maketh the Tree of Sanguis Draconis, lesser
towards the Top; Because the Iuyce hasteneth not vp; And besides it is
very Astringent; And therefore of Slow Motion.
                  It is reported, that Sweet Mosse, besides that vpon the Apple-Trees,
                     
groweth likewise (sometimes) vpon Poplars; And yet (generally) the
Poplar is a Smooth Tree of Barke, and hath little Mosse. The Mosse of the
Larix Tree burneth also Sweet, and sparkleth in the Burning, Quaere of
the Mosses of Oderate Trees; As Cedar, Cypres, Lignum Aloës, &amp;c.
                  The Death that is most without Paine, hath been noted to be, vpon 
the Taking of the Petium of Hemloche; which in Humanity was the Forme
of Execution of Capitall Offenders in Athens. The Poyson of the Aspe, that
Cleopatra vsed, hath some affinity with it. The Cause is, for that the Torments
of Death are chiefly raised by the Strife of the Spirits; And these
Vapours quench the Spirits by Degrees; Like to the Death of an extreme
Old Man. I conceiue it is lesse Painfull than Opium:, because Opium hath
Parts of Heat mixed.
                  There be Fruits, that are Sweet before they be Ripe; As Mirabolanes;
                     
So Reuuell-Seeds are Sweet before they ripen, and after grow Spicy. And
some neuer Ripen to be Sweet; As Tamarinds, Berberries, Crabs, Sloes, &amp;c.
The Cause is, for that the former Kinde haue 
                        •••
                     eh and subtill Heat,
which causeth Earely Sweetnesse; The latter haue a Cold and Acide
Iuyce, which no Heat of the Sunne can sweeten. But as for the Mirabelane,
it hath Parts of Contrary Natures; For it is Sweet, and yet Astringont.
                  
                  There bee few Herbes that haue a Salt Taste; And contrariwise all 
                     Bloud of Liuing Creatures hath a Saltnesse: The Cause may be, for that
Salt, though it be the Audiment of Life, yet in Plants the Originall Taste
                     
remaineth not; For you shall haue them Bitter, Sowre, Sweet, Biting, but
seldome Salt: But in Liuing Creatures, all those High Tastes may happen
to be (sometimes) in the Humours, but are seldome in the Flesh, or Substance;
Because it is of a more Oyly Nature; which is not very Susceptible
of those Tastes; And the Saltnesse it selfe of Bloud, is but a light, and
secret Saltnesse: And euen among Plants, some doe participate of Saltnesse,
as Alga Marina, Sampire, Scorny-Grasse, &amp;c. And they report, there
is, in some of the Indian-Seas, a Swimming Plant, which they call Salgazus,
spreading ouer the Sea, in such sort, as one would thinke it were a
Meadow. It is certaine, that out of the Ashes of all Plants, they extract a
Salt, which they vse in Medicines.
                  
                  
                      It is reported by one of the Ancients, that there is an Herb growing in
the Water, called Lincostis, which is full of Prickles: This Herbe putteth
forth another small Herbe out of the Leafe; which is imputed to some
Moisture, that is gathered betweene the Prickles, which Putrified by the
Sunne, Germinateth. But I remember also I haue seene, for a great Rarity,
one Rose grow out of another, like Honey-Suckles, that they call Top
and Top-gallants.
                  
                  
                     
                     Barley, (as appeareth in the Malting,) being steeped in Water three
dayes, and afterwards the Water drained from it, and the Barley turned
vpon a dry floare, will sprout, halfe an Inch long at least: And if it be
let alone, and not turned, much more; vntill the Heart be out. Wheat
will doe the same. Try it also with Pease, and Beanes. This Experiment
is not like that of the Orpin, and Semper-Vine; For there it is of the old
Store, for no Water is added; But here it is nourished from the Water.
The Experiment would be further driuen: For it appeareth already,
by that which hath beene said, that Earth is not necessary to the first
Sprouting of Plants; And we see that Rose-Buds set in Water, will Blow:
Therefore try whether the Sprouts of such Graines may not be raised to a
further Degree; As to an Herbe, or Flower, with Water onely; Or some
small Commixture, of Earth: For if they will, it should seeme by the
Experiments before, both of the Malt, and of the Roses, that they will
come far faster on in Water, than in Earth: For the Nourishment is easilier
drawne out of Water, than out of Earth. It may giue some light also, that
Drinke infused with Flesh, as that with the Capon, &amp;c. will nourish faster
and easilier, than Meat and Drinke together. Try the same Experiment
with Roots, as well as with Graines: as for Example, take a Turnip, and
steepe it a while, and then dry it, and see whether it will sprout.
                  
                     
                     Malt in the Dren
                           •
                        bing will swell; And in such a manner, as after
the Putting forth in Sprouts, and the drying vpon the Keele, there will
be gained at least a Bushell in eight, and yet the Sprouts are rubbed off;
And there will be a Bushell of Dust besides the Malt: Which I suppose
to be, not onely by the loose, and open Laying of the Parts, but by
some Addition of Substance, drawne from the Water, in which it was
steeped.
                  
                     
                     Malt gathereth a Sweetnesse to the Taste, which appeareth yet more

in the Wort. The Dulcoration of Things is worthy to be tried to the full;
For that Dulcoration importeth a degree to Nourishment: And the Making
of Things Inalimentall, to become Alimentall, may be an Experiment
of great Profit, for Making new Victuall.
                  
                  Most Seeds in the Growing, leaue their Huske or Rinde about the Root;
                     
But the Onion will carry it vp, that it will be like a Cap vpon the Top of
the Young Onion. The Cause may be, for that the Skin or Huske is not
easie to breake; As we see by the Pilling of Onions, what a Holding Substance
the Skin is.
                  
                     Plants, that haue Curled Leaues, doe all abound with Moisture; Which 
commeth so fast on, as they cannot spread themselues Plaine, but must
needs gather together. The Weakest Kinde of Curling is Roughnesse; As
in Clary, and Burre. The Second is Curling on the Sides; As in Lettuce,
and Young Cabbage: And the Third is Folding into an Head; As in Cabbage
full growne, and Cabbage-Lettuce.
                  
                  It is reported, that Firre, and Pine, especially if they be Old and Putrified,
                     
though they shine not, as some Rotten Woods doe, yet in the sudden
Breaking they will sparkle like Hard Sugar.
                  
                  The Roots of Trees doe, (some of them,) put downwards deepe into 
the Ground; As the Oake, Pine, Firre, &amp;c. Some spread more towards
the Surface of the Earth; As the Ash, Cypresse-Tree, Oline, &amp;c. The Cause
of this latter may be, for that such Trees as loue the Sunne, doe not willingly
descend farre into the Earth; And therefore they are (commonly)
Trees, that shoot vp much; For in their Body, their desire of Approach
to the Sunne, maketh them spread the lesse. And the same Reason, vnder
Ground, to auoid Recesse from the Sunne, maketh them spread the
more. And wee see it commeth to passe in some Trees, which haue
beene planted too deepe in the Ground, that forloue of Approach to the
Sunne, they forsake their first Root, and put out another more towards
the Top of the Earth. And wee see also, that the Oliue is full of Oylie Iuyce;
And Ash maketh the best Fire; And Cypresse is an Hot Tree. As for the
Oake; which is of the former sort, it loueth the Earth, And therefore
groweth slowly. And for the Pine, and Firre likewise, they haue so
much Heat in themselues, as they need lesse the Heat of the Sunne. There
be Herbs also, that haue the same difference; As the Herbe they call Morsus
Diaboli; Which putteth the Root downe so low, as you cannot pull it
vp without Breaking; Which gaue Occasion to the N

that it was said, it was so wholesome a Root, that the Deuill, when it was
gathered, bit 
                        ••
                      for Enny. And some of the Ancients doe report, that
there was a Goodly Firre; (which they desired to remoue whole,) that
had a Root vnder Ground eight Cubits deepe; And so the Root came vp
broken.

                     Ground, will die. The Cause may be, for that the Vnbarke Part draweth
the Nourishment best, but the Barke continueth it only.
                  
                     
                     Grapes will continue Fresh, and Moist, all Winter long, if you hang
them, Cluster by Cluster, in the Roofe of a Warme Roome; Especially, it
when you gather the Cluster, you take off with the Cluster some of the
Stocke.
                  
                  
                      The Reed or Cane is a Watry Plant, and groweth not but in the Water;
It hath these Properties; That it is Hollow; That it is Knuckled both
Stalke, and Root; That being Drie, it is more Hard and Fragile, than
other Wood; That it putteth forth no Boughs. though many Stalkes come
out of one Root. It differeth much in Greatnesse; The smallest being fit
for Thatching of Houses; And Stopping the Chinkes of Ships; Better
than Glew, or Pitch. The Second Bignesse, is vsed for Angle-Rods,
and Staues; And in China for beating of Offenders vpon the Thighs.
The differing Kindes of them are; The Common Reed; The Cassia Fistula;
And the Sugar-Reed. Of all Blants, it boweth the easiest, and riseth
againe. It seemeth, that amongst Plants, which are nourished with
Mixture of Earth and Water, it draweth most Nourishment from Water;
which maketh it the Smoothest of all others in Barke; And the Hollowest
in Body.
                  
                  
                      The Sap of Trees, when they are let Bloud, is of differing Natures.

Barke, with a Stone, it will come forth; If you pierce it deeper with a
Toole, it will be drie. The Trees, which haue the Moistest Iuyces in their
Fruit. haue commonly the Moistest Sap in their Body; For the Vines and
Peares are very Moist; Apples somes hat more Spongie: The Milke of the

Length, Straightnesse, and Lightnesse: Some for Pale; As Oake: Some
for Fuell; As Ash: And so of the rest.
                  The Comming of Trees and Plants in certaine Regions, and net in others,
is sometimes Casuall: For many haue beene translated, and haue
prospered well; As Damaske-Roses, that haue not beene knowne in England
aboue an hundred yeares, and now are so common. But the liking
of Plants in certaine Soiles, more than in others, is meerly Naturall; As
the Firre and Pine loue the Mountaines; The Poplar; Willow, Sallow, and
Alder, loue Riuers, and Moist Places: The Ash loueth Coppices; But is
best in Standards alone: luniper loueth Chalke; And so doe most FruitTrees:
Sampire groweth but upon Rocks: Reeds and Ofiers grow where
they are washed with Water: The Vine loueth Sides of Hills, turning
vpon the South-East Sun, &amp;c.
                  The Putting forth of certaine Herbs discouereth of what Nature the 
                     Ground where they put forth, is: As Wilde Thyme sheweth good Feeding

                  There are found, in diuers Countries, some other Plants, that grow 
out of Trees and Plants, besides Misseltes: As in Syria, there is an Herbe
called Cassytas that groweth out of tall Trees, and windeth it selfe about
the same Tree where it groweth; And sometimes about Thornes. There
is a kinde of Polypode, that groweth out of Trees, though it windeth not.
So likewise an Herbe called Fannes, vpon the Wilde Oline. And an Herbe

                     Cold and Easterly Winds, are thought to be great Enemies to Fruit; yet
neuerthelesse South Winds are also found to doe Hure; Especially in the
Blossoming time; And the more, if Showers follow. It seemeth, they call
forth the Moisture too fast. The West Winds are the best. It hath beene
obserued also that Greene and Open Winters doe hurt Trees; Insomuch as
if two or three such Winters come together, Almond-Trees, and some
other Trees, will dye. The Cause is the same with the former, because
the Lust of the Earth ouerspendeth it selfe; Howsoeuer some other of
the Ancients haue commended Warme Winters.
                  
                  
                     Snowes, lying long, cause a Fruitfull Yeare: For first, they keepe in 
the Strength of the Earth; Secondly, they water the Earth, better than
Raine; For in Snow, the Earth doth (as it were) sucke the Water, as out
of the Teate. Thirdly, the Moisture of Snow is the finest Moisture; For
it is the Froth of the Cloudy Waters.
                  
                  
                     Showers, if they come a little before the Ripening of Fruits, doe good 
to all Shoculent and Moist Fruits; As Vines, Oliues, Pomegranates; Yet
it is rather for Plenty, than for Goodnesse; For the best Wines are in
the Driest Vintages: Small Showers are likewise good for Corne, so as

                     Parching Heats come not vpon them. Generally, Night-Showers are better
than Day-Showers; For that the Sunne followeth not so fast vpon
them. And we see, euen in Watring by the Hand, it is best, in Summer
time, to water in the Euening.
                  
                  
                      The Differences of Earths, and the Triall of them, are worthy to be
diligently inquired. The Earth, that with Showers doth easiliest Soften,
is commended; And yet some Earth of that kinde will be very Dry,
and Hard before the Showers. The Earth that casteth vp from the
Plough, a Great Clod, is not so good, as that, which casteth vp a Smaller
Clod. The Earth, that putteth forth Mosse easily, and may bee called
Mouldy, is not good. The Earth, that smelleth well vpon the Digging,
or Ploughing, is commended; As containing the Iuyce of Vegetables
almost already prepared. It is thought by some, that the Ends of low
Raine-Bowes, fall more vpon one kinde of Earth than vpon another: As
it may well be; For that that Earth is most Roscide: And therfore it is
commended for a Signe of good Earth. The Poorenesse of the Herbs, (it
is plaine,) shew the Poorenesse of the Earth; And especially if they be in
Colour more darke: But if the Herbs shew Withered, or Blasted at the
Top, it sheweth the Earth to be very Cold: And so doth the Mossinesse
of Trees. The Earth, whereof the Grasse is soone Parched with the Sun,
and Toasted, is commonly Forced Earth, and Barren in his owne Nature.
The Tender, Chessoine, and Mellow Earth, is the best; Being meere Mould,
betweene the two Extreames of Clay, and Sand; Especially if it be not
Loamy, and Binding. The Earth, that after Raine, will scarce be Ploughed,
is commonly Fruitfull; For it is Cleaning, and full of Iuyce.
                  
                  
                      It is strange, which is obserued by some of the Ancients, that Dust helpeth
the Fruitfulnesse of Trees; And of Vines, by name: Insomuch as
they catt Dust vpon them of purpose. It should seeme, that that Powdring,
when a Shower commeth, maketh a kinde of Soyling to the
Tree, being Earth and Water, finely laid on. And they note, that Countries,
where the Fields and Wayes are Dusty, beare the best Vines.
                  
                  
                      It is commended by the Ancients, for an Excellent Helpe to Trees, to
lay the Stalks and Leaues of Lupines about the Roots; Or to Plough
them into the Ground, where you will sowe Corne. The Burning also
of the Cuttings of Vines, and Casting them vpon land, doth much Good.
And it was generally receiued of old, that the Dunging of Grounds, when
the West Wind bloweth, and in the Decrease of the Moone, doth greatly
helpe; The Earth (as it seemeth) being then more thirsty, and open, to
receiue the Dung.
                  
                  
                      The Grafting of Vines vpon Vines, (as I take it,) is not now in vse:
The Ancients had it, and that three wayes: The First was Insition, which
is the Ordinary Manner of Grafting: The Second was Terebration,
through the Middle of the Stocke, and Putting in the Cions there: And
the Third was Paring of two Vines, that grow together, to the Marrow,
and Binding them close.
                  
                      The Diseases and ill Accidents of Corne, are worthy to be enquired;

And would be more worthy to be enquired, if it were in Mens Power to
helpe them; Whereas many of them are not to be remedied. The Mildew
is one of the Greatest; which (out of question) commeth by Closenesse
of Aire; And therefore in Hills, or large Champaigne Grounds, it seldome
commeth; Such as is with vs York's Worad. This cannot be remedied,
otherwise than that in Countries of Small Enclosure, the Grounds
be turned into larger Fields: Which I haue knowne to doe good in
some Farmes. Another Disease is the Putting forth of Wilde Oats, whereinto
Corne oftentimes, (especially Barley,) doth degenerate. It happeneth
chiefly from the Weaknesse of the Graine that is sowen; For if it be
either too Old, or Mouldy, it will bring forth Wilde Oats. Another Disease
is the Saciety of the Ground; For if you sow one Ground still with
the same Corne, (I meane not the same Corne that grew vpon the same
Ground,) but the same Kinde of Graine; (As Wheat, Barley, &amp;c.) it will
prosper but poorely: Therefore besides the Resting of the Ground, you
must vary the Seed. Another ill Accident is, from the Winds, which hurt
at two times; At the Flowring, by Shaking off the Flowers; And at the
full Ripening, by Shaking out the Corne. Another ill Accident is, Drouth,
at the Spindling of the Corne; Which with vs is rate; But in Hotter
Countries, common: Insomuch as the Word, Calamitas, was first deriued
from Calamus, when the Corne could not get out of the Stalke. Another
ill Accident is, Ouer-wet at Sowing-Time; which with vs breedeth
much Dearth; Insomuch as the Corne neuer commeth vp; And (many
times) they are forced to resow Sommer-Corne, where they sowed Winter-Corne.
Another ill Accident is Bitter Frosts, continued, without Snow;
Especially in the Beginning of the Winter, after the Seed is new Sowen.
Another Disease is Wormes; which sometimes breed in the Root, and
happen vpon Hot Sunnes, and Showers, immediately after the Sowing;
And another Worme breedeth in the Eare it Selfe; Especially when Hot
Sunnes breake often out of Clouds. Another Disease is Weeds; And they
are such, as either Choake, and Ouershadow the Corne, and beare it
downe; Or starue the Corne, and deceiue it of Nourishment. Another
Disease is, Ouer-Rancknesse of the Corne; Which they vse to remedy, by
Mowing it after it is come vp; Or putting Sheepe into it. Another ill Accident
is Laying of Corne with great Raines, neare, or in Harnest. Another
ill Accident is, if the Seed happen to haue touched Oyle, or any Thing,
that is Fat; For those Substances haue an Antipathy with Nourishment of
Water.
                  
                  The Remedies of the Diseases of Corne haue beene obserued as followeth.
The Steeping of the Graine, before Sowing, a little time in Wine,
is thought a Presernatiue: The Mingling of Seed-Corne with Ashes, is
thought to be good: The Sowing at the Wane of the Moone, is thought
to make the Corne sound: It hath not beene practised, but it is thought
to be of vse, to make some Miscellane in Corne; As if you sow a few
Beanes with Wheat, your Wheat will be the better. It hath beene obserued,
that the Sowing of Corne with Honsleeke, doth good. Though Graine, that

toucheth Oyle, or Fat, receiueth hurt, yet the Steeping of it, in the Dregs
of Oyle, when it beginneth to Putrifie, (which they call Amurca,) is
thought to assure it against Wormes. It is reported also, that it Corne
be Mowed, it will make the Graine Longer, but Emptier, and hauing
More of the Huske.
                  
                  
                      It hath beene noted, that Seed of a yeare old, is the Best; And of
two or three yeares is Worse, And that which is more Old, is quite Barren;
Though (no doubt) some Seeds and Graines last better than others.
The Corne, which in the Vanning lieth lowest, is the best; And the Corne,
which broken or bitten retaineth a little Yellownesse, is better than that
which is very White.
                  
                  
                      It hath beene obserued, that of all Roots of Herbs, the Root of Sorrell
goeth the furthest into the Earth; Insomuch as it hath bin knowne to go
three Cubits deepe; And that it is the Root that continueth fit (longest)
to be set againe, of any Root that groweth. It is a Cold and Acide Herbe,
that (as it seemeth) loueth the Earth, and is not much drawne by the
Sunne.
                  
                  
                      It hath beene obserued, that some Herbs like best, being watred with
Salt-Water; As Radish, Beet, Rew, Pennyroyall; This Triall would be extended
to some other Herbs; Especially such as are Strong; As Tarragon,
Mustard-Seed, Rocket, and the like.
                  
                      It is strange that is generally receiued, how some Poysonous Beasts
affect Odorate and Wholesome Herbs; As that the Snake loueth Fennell;
That the Toad will be much vnder Sage; That Frogs will be in Cinque foile.
It may be, it is rather the Shade, or other Couerture, that they take liking
in, than the Vertue of the Herbe.
                  
                  
                      It were a Matter of great Profit, (saue that I doubt it is too Coniecturall
to venture vpon,) if one could discerne, what Corne, Herbs, or
Fruits, are like to be in Plenty, or Scarcity, by some Signes and Prognosticks.
in the Beginning of the Yeare: For as for those, that are like to be in
Plenty, they may be bargained for, vpon the Ground; As the Old Relation
was of Thales; who to shew how easie it was for a Philosopher to be
rich, when he fore-saw a great Plenty of Oliues, made a Monopoly of them.
And for Scarcity, Men may make Profit in keeping better the Old Store.
Long Continuance of Snow is beleeued to make a Fruitfull Yeare of Corne:
An Earely Winter, or a very Late Winter, a Barren Yeare of Corne: An Open
and Serene Winter, an ill Yeare of Fruit: These we haue partly touched
before: But other Prognostickes of like Nature are diligently to be
enquired.
                  
                      There seeme to be, in some Plants, Singularities, wherein they differ
from all Other; The Oliue hath the Oyly Part, only on the Outside; Wheras
all other Fruits haue it in the Nut, or Kernell. The Firre hath (in effect)
no Stone, Nut, nor Kernest; Except you will count the little Graines
Kernells. The Pom granate and Pine Apple haue onely, amongst Fruits,
Graines distinct in seuerall Cells. No Herbs haue Curled Leaues, but Cabbage,
and Cabbage-Lettuce. None haue double Leaues, one belonging to

the Stalke, another to the Fruit or Seed, but the Artichoke: No Flower
hath that kinde of Spread that the Woodbine hath. This may be a large
Field of Contemplation; For it sheweth that in the Frame of Nature,
there is, in the Producing of some Species, a Composition of Matter,
which happeneth oft, and may be much diuersified: In others, such as
happeneth rarely, and admitteth little Variety: For so it is likewise in
Beasts: Dogs haue a Resemblance with Wolnes, and Foxes; Horses with
Asses, Kine with Bustes; Hares with Coneyes; &amp;c. And so in Birds: Kites
and Kastrells haue a Resemblance with Hawkes; Common-Doues with

                     Beasts are more Hairy than Men; And Sauage Man more than Ciuill;
And the Plumage of Birds exceedeth the Pilosity of Beasts.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Pilosity and Plumage.
                      The Cause of
the Smoothnesse in Men, is not any Abundance of Heat, and Moisture,
                      though that indeed causeth Pilosity; But there is requisite to Pilosity, not
so much Heat and Moisture, as Excrementitious Heat and Moisture: (For
whatsoeuer assimilateth, goeth not into the Haire:) And Excrementitious
Moisture aboundeth most in Beasts, and Men that are more Sauage.
Much the same Reason is there of the Plumage of Birds; For Birds assimilate
lesse, and excerne more than Beasts: For their Excrements are
euer liquid, and their Flesh (generally) more dry: Besides, they haue
not Instruments for Vrine; And so all the Excrementitious Moisture goeth
into the Feathers: And therefore it is no Maruell, though Birds bee
commonly better Meat than Beasts, because their Flesh doth assimilate
more finely, and secerneth more subtilly. Againe, the Head of Man hath
Haire vpon the first Birth, which no other Part of the Body hath. The
Cause may be Want of Perspiration: For Much of the Matter of Haire, in
the other Parts of the Body, goeth forth by Insensible Perspiration; And
besides, the Skull being of a more solide Substance, nourisheth and assimilateth lesse,
and excerneth more: And so likewise doth the Chinne;
We see also that Haire commeth not vpon the Palmes of the Hands, nor
Soales of the Feet; Which are Parts more Perspirable. And Children
likewise are not Hairy, for that their Skins are more Perspirable.
                  
                  
                     Birds are of Swifter Motion than Beasts: For the Flight of many Birds
is Swifter, than the Race of any Beasts.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Quicknesse of Motion in Birds.
                      The Cause is, for that the Spirits
in Birds, are in greater Proportion, in comparison of the Bulke of their
Body, than in Beasts: For as for the Reason that some giue, that they
are partly Carried, whereas Beasts goe, that is Nothing; For by that
 Reason Swimming should be swifter, than Running: And that Kinde of
Carriage also, is not without Labour of the Wing.
                  
                  The Sea is Clearer, when the North wind bloweth, than when the
South-wind.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the different Clear enesse of the Sea.
                      The Cause is, for that Salt-Water hath a little Oylinesse in the
Surface thereof; As appeareth in very Hot Daies: And againe, for that
the Southerne Wind relaxeth the Water somewhat; As no Water Boyling
                      is so Cleare as Cold Water.

And lastly, Broken and Incinerate: Sealding Water doth none of these.Experiment Solitary touching the different Heats of Fire and Boiling Water.
                     
The Cause is, for that by Fire, the Spirit of the Body is first Refined, and
 then Emitted; Whereof the Refining, be Attenuation causeth the Light;
                     
And the Emission, first the Fragilitie, and after the Dissolution into Ashes:
Neither doth any other Body enter: But in Water the Spirit of the Body
is not Refined so much; And besides Part of the Water entreth; Which
doth increase the Spirit, and in a degree extinguish it: Therefore wee see
that Hot Water will quench Fire. And againe wee see, that in Bodies,
wherein the Water doth not much enter, but only the Heat passeth, Hot
Water worketh the Effects of Fire: As in Egges Boyled, and Roasted, (into
which the Water entreth not at all,) there is scarce difference to be discerned;
But in Fruit, and Flesh, whereinto the Water entreth, in some
part, there is much more difference.
                  The Bottome of a Vessell of Boyling Water, (as hath beene obserued,) is
not very much Heated; So as Men may put their Hand vnder the Vessell,
and remoue it.Experiment Solitary touching the Qualification of Heat by Moisture.
                      The Cause is, for that the Moisture of Water, as it quencheth
Coales, where it entreth; So it doth allay Heat, where it toucheth:
And therefore note well, that Moisture, although it doth not passe thorow
Bodies, without Communication of some Substance, (As Heat and
Cold doe;) yet it worketh manifest Effects; not by Entrance of the Body,
but by Qualifying of the Heat, and Cold; As wee see in this Instance:
And wee see likewise, that the Water of Things distilled in Water,
(which they call the Bath,) differeth not much from the Water of Things
Distilled by Fire: Wee see also, that Pewter-Dishes, with Water in them,
will not Melt easily; But without it, they will: Nay wee see more, that
Butter, or Oyle, which in themselues are Inflammable, yet by Vertue of
their Moisture, will doe the like.
                  It hath beene noted by the Ancients, that it is dangerous to Picke ones
Eare, whilest he Yawneth.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Yawning.
                      The Cause is, for that in Yawning, the Inner
Parchment of the Eare is extended, by the Drawing in of the Spirit, and 
                     Breath; For in Yawning, and Sighing both, the Spirit is first strongly
Drawne in, and then strongly Expelled.
                  It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that Sneezing doth cease the
Hiccough.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Hiccough. The Cause is, for that the Motion of the Hiccough, is a Lifting
vp of the Stomacke: which Sneezing doth somewhat depresse, and diuert
the Motion another way. For first wee see, that the Hiccough commeth of 
                     Fulnesse of Meat, (especially in Children, which causeth an Extension
of the Stomacke: Wee see also, it is caused by Acide Meats, or Drinkes,
which is by the Pricking of the Stomacke: And this Motion is ceased, either
by Diuersion; Or by Detention of the Spirits: Diuersion, as in Sneezing;
Detention, as wee see Holding of the Breath, doth helpe somewhat
to cease the Hiccough: And putting a Man into an Earnest Studie doth
the like; As is commonly vsed: And Vinegar put to the Nostbrills, or
Gargarized, doth it also; For that it is Astringent, and inhibiteth the
Motion of the Spirits.
                  
                  
                     
                     Looking against the Sunne, doth induce Sneezing.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Sneezing
                      The Cause; is not
the Heating of the Nosthrills; For then the Holding vp of the Nosthrills
against the Sunne, though one Winke, would doe it, But the Drawing
                      downe of the Moisture of the Braine: For it will make the Eyes, run with
Water; And the Drawing of Moisture to the Eyes, doth draw it to the
Nosthrills, by Motion of Consent; And so followeth Sneezing; As contrariwise,
the Tickling of the Nosthrills within, doth draw the Moisture to
the Nosthrills, and to the Eyes by Consent; For they also will Water. But
yet, it hath beene obserued, that if one be about to Sneeze, the Rubbing
of the Eyes, till they run with Water, will preuent it. Where of the Cause
is, for that the Humour, which was descending to the Nosthrills, is diuerted
to the Eyes.
                  
                  The Teeth are more, by Cold Drinke, or the like, affected, than the
other Parts.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Tendernesse of the Teeth.
                      The Cause is double: The One, for that the Resistance of
Bone to Cold, is greater than of Flesh; for that Flesh shrinketh, but the
Bone resisteth, whereby the Cold becommeth more eager: The Other is,
 for that the Teeth are Parts without Bloud; Whereas Bloud helpeth to
qualifie the Cold: And therefore wee see, that the Sinnewes are much affected
with Cold; For that they are Parts without Bloud: So the Bones in
Sharpe Colds wax Brittle; And therefore, it hath beene seene, that all
Contusions of Bones, in Hard Weather, are more difficult to Cure.
                  It hath been noted, that the Tongue receiueth, more easily, Tokens of
Diseases, than the other Parts; As of Heats within, which appeare most
in the Blacknesse of the Tongue.

                      Againe, Pied Cattell are spotted in their

                     Tongues, &amp;c. The Cause is, (no doubt,) the Tendernesse of the Part; which
thereby receiueth more easily all Alterations, than any other Parts of the
Flesh.
                  
                  When the Mouth is out of Taste, it maketh Things taste, sometimes

                      The
Cause is, the Corrupting of the Moisture about the Tongue; Which many
 times turneth Bitter, and Salt, and Loathsome; But Sweet neuer; For the
rest are Degrees of Corruption.

                  It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that Much vse of Venus doth
Dimme the Sight; And yet Eunuchs, which are vnable to generate, are
(neuerthelesse) also Dimme Sighted.
                     Experiments in Consort touching Venus.
                      The Cause of Dimnesse of Sight, in
the Former, is the Expence of Spirts; In the Latter, the Ouer-moisture
                     
of the Braine: For the Ouer-moisture of the Braine doth thicken the Spirits
Visuall. and obstructeth their Passages; As we see by the Decay, in
the Sight, in Age; Where also the Diminution of the Spirits concurreth
as another Cause: we see also that Blindnesse commeth by Rheumes, and

                        
                           •••
                        . Now in 
                        •••
                     . there are all the Notes of Moisture; As the
Swelling of their Thighes, the Loosenesse of their Belly, the Smoothnesse
of their Skinne, &amp;c.
                  The Pleasure in the Act of Venus is the greatest of the Pleasures of 
the Senses: The Matching of it with Itch is vnproper; though that also
be Pleasing to the touch. But the Conses are Profound. First, all the Organe
of the Senses qualifie the Nations of the Spirits; And make so many
Seuerall Species of Motions, and Pleasures or Displeasures thereupon, as
there be Dinersitics of Organs. The Instruments of Sight, Hearing, Taste,
and Smell, are of seuerall frame; And so are the Parts for Generation.
Therefore Sealiger doth well, to make the Pleasure of Generation a Sixth
Sense; And if there were any other differing Organs, and Qualified Perfraction
for the spirits to passe; there would be more than the Fiue Senses;
Neither doe we well know, whether some Beasts, and Birds, haue
not Senses that we know not: And the very some of Dogs is almost a
sense it selfe. Secondly, the Pleasures of the Touch, are greater and

deeper, than those of the other Senses; As we see in Warming vpon Cold;
Or Refrigeration vpon Heat: For as the Paines of the Touch, are greater
than the Offences of other Sense; So likewise are the Pleasures. It is true,
that the Affecting of the Spirits immediately, and (as it were) without an
Organ, is of the greatest Pleasure; Which is but in two things: Sweet
Smells; And Wine, and the like Sweet Vapours. For Smells, wee see their
great and sudden Effect in fetching Men againe, when they swoune: For
Drinke, it is certaine, that the Pleasure of Drunkennesse, is next the Pleasure
of Venus: And Great Ioyes (likewise) make the Spirits moue, and
touch themselues: And the pleasure of Venus is somewhat of the same
Kinde.
                  
                      It hath beene alwayes obserued, that Men are more inclined to Venus
in the Winter, and Women in the Summer. The Cause is, for that the Spirits,
in a Body more Hot and dry, (as the Spirits of Men are,) by the Summer
are more exhaled, and dissipated; And in the Winter more condensed,
and kept entire: But in Bodies that are Cold and Moist, (as Womens
are,) the Summer doth Cherish the Spirits, and calleth them forth; the
Winter doth dull them. Furthermore, the Abstinence or Intermission of
the Vse of Venus, in Moist and Well Habituate Bodies, breedeth a Number
of Diseases; And especially dangerous Impostumations. The Reason is
euident; For that it is a Principall Euacuation, especially of the Spirits:
For of the Spirits, there is scarce any Euacuation, but in Venus, and Exercise.
And therefore the Omission of either of them, breedeth all Diseases
of Repletion.
                  
                  The Nature of Viuification is very worthy the Enquiry:
And as the Nature of Things, is commonly better perceiued,
in Small, than in Great, and in vnperfect, than in perfect, and
in Parts, than in whole: So the Nature of Viuification is best
enquired in Creatures bred of Putrefaction.
                     Experiments in Consort touching the Insecta.
                      The Contemplation
whereof hath many Excellent Fruits. First, in Disclosing the Originall
of of Viuification. Secondly, in Disclosing the Originall of Figuration. Thirdly, in Disclosing many Things in the Nature
of Perfect Creatures, which in them lye more hidden. And
Fourthly, in Traducing, by way of Operation, some Obseruations
in the Insecta, to worke Effects vpon Perfect Creatures.
Note that the word Insecta, agreeth not with the Matter, but
we euer vse it for Breuities sake, intending by it Creatures bred
of Putrefaction.
                  
                  
                      The Insecta are found to breed out of seuerall Matters: Some breed
of Mud, or Dung; As the Earth-wormes, Eeles, Snakes, &amp;c. For they are
both Putrefactions: For Water in Mud doth Puttifie, as not able to Preserue
it selfe: And for Dung, all Excrements are the Refuse and Putrefactions
                     
of Nourishment. Some breed in Wood, both Growing, and Cut down.
Quare in what Woods most, and at what Seasons? We see that the Worms
with many Feet, which round themselues into Balls, are bred chiefly vnder
Logs of Timber, but not in the Timber; And they are said to be found
also, (many times,) in Gardens, where no Logs are. But it seemeth their
Generation requireth a Couerture, both from Sunne, and Raine, or Dew;
As the Timber is; And therfore they are not Venemous, but (contrariwise)
are held by the Physitians to clarifie the Bloud. It is obserued also that Cimices
are found in the Holes of Bed-Sides. Some breed in the Haire of Liuing
Creatures; As Lice, and Tikes; which are bred by the Sweat close
kept, and somewhat are fied by the Haire. The Excrements of Liuing Creatures,
do not only breed Insecta, when they are Excerned, but also while
they are in the Body; As in Wormes, whereto Children are most subiect,
and are chiefly in the Guts. And it hath beene lately obserued by Physitians,
that in many Pestilent Diseases, there are Wormes found in the vpper
Parts of the Body, where Excrements are not, but onely Humours Putrified.
Fleas breed Principally of Straw or Mass, where there hath beene a
little Moisture; Or the Chamber and Bed-straw kept close, and not Aired.
It is receiued that they are killed by Strewing Worme-wood in the Rooms.
And it is truly obserued, that Bitter Things are apt, rather to kill, than engender
Putrefaction; And they be Things, that are Fat, or Sweet, that are
aptest to Putrifie. There is a Worme, that breedeth in Meale, of the shape
of a large white Magget, which is giuen as a great Dainty to Nightingales.
The Moath breedeth vpon Cloth, and other Lanifices; Especially if they
be laid vp dankish, and wet. It delighteth to be about the Flame of a Candle.
There is a Worme called a Wenill, brad vnder Ground, and that feedeth
vpon Roots; As Parsnips, Carrets, &amp;c. Some breed in Waters, especially
shaded, but they must be Standing-waters; As the Water-Spider, that hath
six Legs. The Fly called the Oad-fly, breedeth of somewhat that Swimmeth
vpon the Top of the Water, and is most about Ponds. There is a
Worme that breedeth of the Dregs of Wine Decayed; which afterwards,
(as is obserued by some of the Ancients,) turneth into a Gnat. It hath bin
obserued by the Ancients, that there is a Worme that breedeth in old Snow,
and is of Colour Reddish, and dull of Motion, and dieth soone after it
commeth out of Snow. Which should shew, that Snow hath in it a secret
Warmth; For else it could hardly Viuisie. And the Reason of the Dying
of the Worme, may be the sudden Exhaling of that little Spirit, as soone
as it commeth out of the Cold, which had shut it in. For as Butterflies
quicken with Heat, which were benummed with Cold; So Spirits may
exhale with Heat, which were Preserued in Cold. It is affirmed both by
Ancient and Moderne Obseruation, that in Furnaces of Copper, and Brasse,
where Chalcites, (which is Vitrioll,) is often cast in, to mend the working,
there riseth suddenly a Fly, which sometimes moueth, as if it tooke hold
on the walls of the Furnace; Sometimes is seene mouing in the Fire below;
And dieth presently, as soone as it is out of the Furnace. Which is
a Noble Instance, and worthy to be weighed; for it sheweth that as well

                     Violent Heat of Fire, as the Gentle Heat of Liuing Creatures, will Viuifie, if
it haue Matter Proportionable. Now the great Axiome of Viuification is,
that there must be Heat to dilate the Spirit of the Body; An Actiue Spirit
to be dilated; Matter Viscous or Tenacious, to hold in the Spirit; And that
Matter to be put forth, and Figured. Now a Spirit dilated by so ardent a
Fire, as that of the Furnace, as soone as euer it cooleth neuer so little,
congealeth presently. And (no doubt) this Action is furthered by the
Chalcites, which hath a Spirit, that will Put forth and germinate, as we see
in Chymicall Trialls. Briefly, most Things Putrified bring forth Insecta of
seuerall Names; But wee will not take vpon vs now, to Enumerate
them all.
                  
                      The Insecta haue beene noted by the Ancients, to feed little: But this
hath not beene diligently obserued; For Grashoppers eat vp the Greene
of whole Countries; And Silke-wormes deuoure Leaues swiftly; And
Ants make gret Prouision. It is true, that Creatures, that Sleepe and rest
much, Eat little; As Dormise, and Bats, &amp;c. They are all without Bloud:
Which may be, for that the Iuyce of their Bodies, is almost all one; Not
Bloud, and Flesh, and Skin, and Bone, as in Perfect Creatures; The Integrall
Parts haue Extreme Variety, but the Similar Parts little. It is true, that
they haue, (some of them,) a Disphragme, and an Intestine; And they
haue all Skins; Which in most of the Insecta are cast often. They are
not (generally) of long Life: Yet Bees haue beene knowne to liue seuen
yeares: And Snakes are thought, the rather for the Casting of their Spoils,
to liue till they be Old: And Eeles, which many times breed of Putrefaction,
will liue and grow very long: And those that Enterchange from
Wormes to Flyes in the Summer, and from Flyes to Wormes in the Winter,
haue beene kept in Boxes oure kyears at the least. Yet there are certain
Flyes, that are called Ephemera, that liue but a day. The Cause is, the Exility
of the Spirit; Or perhaps the Absence of the Sunne; For that if they
were brought in, or kept close, they might liue longer. Many of the Insecta,
(as Butterflies, and other Flies,) reuiue easily, when they seeme
dead, being brought to the Sunne, or Fire, The Cause whereof is, the
Diffusion of the Vitall Spirit, and the Easie Dilating of it by a little Heat.
They stirre a good while, after their Heads are off, or that they be cut in
Pecces; Which is caused also, for that their Vitall Spirits are more diffused
thorow-out all their Parts, and lesse confined to Organs, than in
Perfect Creatures.
                  
                  
                      The Insecta haue Voluntary Motion, and therefore Imagination; And
whereas some of the Ancients haue said, that their Motion is Indeterminate,
and their Imagination Indefinite, it is negligently obserued; For
Arts goe right forwards to their Hills; And Bees doe (admirably)
know the way, from a Flowry Heath, two or three Miles off, to their
Hiues. It may be, Gnats, and Flyes, haue their Imagination more mutable,
and giddy, as Small Birds likewise haue. It is said by some of the
Ancients, that they haue onely the Sense of Feeling; which is manifestly
vntrue: For if they goe forthright to a Place, they must needs haue

Sight: Besides they delight more in one Flower, or Herbe, than in
another, and therefore haue Taste: And Bees are called with Sound
vpon Brasse, and therefore they haue Hearing: Which sheweth likewise
that though their Spirit be diffused, yet there is a Seat of their Senses
in their Head.
                  
                  Other Obseruations concerning the Insecta, together with the Enumeration
of them, wee referre to that place, where wee meane to handle
the Title of Animal's in generall.
                  A Man Leapeth better with Weights, in his Hands, than without.Experiment Solitary touching Leaping.
                     
The Cause is, for that the Weight, (if it be proportionable,) strengthneth
the Sinneues, by Contracting them. For otherwise, where no Contraction
                     
is needfull, Weight hindereth. As wee see in Horse-Races, Men
are curious to fore-see, that there be not the least Weight, vpon the one
Horse, more than vpon the other. In Leaping with Weights, the Armes
are first cast backwards, and then forwards, with so much the greater
Force: For the Hands goe backward before they take their Raise.
Quaere, if the contrary Motion of the Spirits, immediately before the
Motion wee intend, doth not cause the Spirits, as it were, to breake
forth with more Force: As Breath also drawne, and kept in, commeth
forth more forcibly: And in Casting of any Thing, the Armes, to
make a greater Swing, are first cast backward.
                  Of Musicall Tones, and Vnequall Sounds, wee haue spoken before;
But touching the Pleasure, and Displeasure of the Senses, not so fully.Experiment Solitary, touching the Pleasures, and Displeasures of the Senses, especially of Hearing.
                     
                     Harsh Sounds, as of a Sawe, when it is sharpened; Grinding of one Stone
against another; Squeaking, or Skriching Noise; make a Shiuering or
Horrour in the Body, and set the Teeth on edge. The Cause is, for that
the Obiects of the Eare, doe affect the Spirits (immediately) most 
with Pleasure and Offence. We see, there is no Colour that affecteth
the Eye much with Displeasure: There be Sights, that are Horrible,
because they excite the Memory of Things that are Odious, or Fearefull;
But the same Things Painted doe little affect. As for Smells, Tastes,
and Touches, they be Things that doe affect, by a Participation, or Impulsion
of the Body, of the Obiect. So it is Sound alone, that doth immediately,
and incorporeally, affect most: This is most manifest in
Musicke; and Concords and Discords in Musicke: For all Sounds, whether
they be sharpe, or Flat, if they be Sweet, haue a Roundnesse and
Equality; And if they be Harsh, are Vnequall: For a Discord it selfe is
but a Harshnesse of Diners Sounds Meeting. It is true, that Inequality,
not Stayed vpon, but Passing, is rather an Encrease of Sweetnesse:
As in the Purling of a Wreathed String; And in the Rancity of a
Trumpet; And in the Nightinghale-Pipe of a Regall; And in a Discord
straight falling vpon a Concord: But if you stay vpon it, it is
Offensiue; And therefore, there bee these three Degrees of Pleasing,
                     
and Displeasing in Sounds; Sweet Sounds; Discords and Harsh Sounds,
which we call by diuers Names, as Skriching, or Grating, such
as wee now speake of. As for the Setting of the Teeth on
Edge, we see plainly, what an Intercourse there is, betweene
the Teeth, and the Organ of the Hearing,
by the Taking of the End of a Bow, betweene
the Teeth, and Striking
vpon the String.

Sigillata communis, and Bolus Arminus:
Whereof Terra Lemnia is the Chiefe. The 
                     Vertues of them are, for Curing of Wounds,
Stanching of Bloud, Stopping of Flaxes and
Rheumes, and Arresting the Spreading of Poison,
Infection, and Putrefaction: And they
haue, of all other Simples, the Perfectest and
Purest Qualitie of Drying, with little or no Mixture of any other Qualitie.
Yet it is true, that the Bole-Arminicke is the most Cold of them; And that
Terra Lemnia is the most Hot; For which Cause, the Island Lemnos, where
it is digged, was in the Old Fabulous Ages consecrated to Vulcan.

                      which are gathered from the sides of Rocks, being as it were a
large, but tough, Mosse. It is the more to be noted, because that there be
but few Substances, Plant-like, that grow deepe within the Sea; For they
are gathered sometimes fifteene Fathome deepe; And when they are laid 
                     
on Shoare, they seeme to be of great Bulke; But crushed together, will
be transported in a very small Roome.
                  It seemeth, that Fish, that are vsed to the Salt-Water, doe neuerthelesse
delight more in Fresh.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Sea-Fish put in Fish Waters.
                      Wee see, that Salmons, and Smelts, loue to
get into Riuers, though it be against the Streame. At the Hauen of Constantinople,
you shall haue great Quantities of Fish that come from the

                     Euxine-Sea; that when they come into the Fresh Water, doe inebriate and
turne vp their Bellies; So as you may take them with your Hand. I doubt,
there hath not beene sufficient Experiment made of Putting Sea-Fish into
Fresh Water, Ponds, and Pooles. It is a Thing of great Vse, and Pleasure:
For so you may haue them new at some good distance from the Sea: And
besides, it may be, the Fish will eat the pleasanter, and may fall to breed:
And it is said that Colchester Oysters, which are put into Pits, where the
Sea goeth and commeth, (but yet so, that there is a Fresh Water Comming
also to them, when the Sea voideth,) become by that meanes Fatter,
and more Growne.
                  The Turkish-Bow giueth a very Forcible Shoot; Insomuch as it hath
beene knowne, that the Arrow hath pierced a Stecle Target, or a Peece
of Brasse of two Inches thicke: But that which is more strange, the Arrow,
if it be Headed with Wood, hath beene knowne to pierce thorow a
 Peece of Wood, of eight Inches thicke. And it is certaine, that wee had
in vse at one time, for Sea-Fight, short Arrowes, which they called
Sprights, without any other Heads, saue Wood sharpned; which were
discharged out of Muskets, and would pierce thorow the Sides of Ships,
where a Bullet would not pierce. But this dependeth vpon one of the
greatest Secrets in all Nature; Which is, that Similitude of Substance
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Attraction by Simulitude of Substance.
                      will
cause Attraction, where the Body is wholly freed from the Motion of
Grauitie: For if that were taken away, Lead would draw Lead, and Gold
would draw Gold, and Iron would draw Iron, without the helpe of the
Load-Stone. But this same Motion of Weight or Grauitie, (which is a meere
Motion of the Matter, and hath no Affinitie with the Forme, or Kinde,)
doth kill the other Motion, except it selfe be killed by a violent Motion;
As in these Instances of Arrowes; For then the Motion of Attraction by
Similitude of Substance, beginneth to shew it selfe. But wee shall handle
this Point of Nature fully in due Place.
                  They haue in Turkey, and the East, certaine Confections, which they
call Seruetts, which are like to Candied Conserues; And are made of Sugar
and Limons, or Sugar and Citrons, or Sugar and Violets, and some
other Flowers; And some Mixture of Amber for the more delicate Persons;
 And those they dissolue in Water, and thereof make their Drinke
because they are forbidden Wine by their Law.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching certaine Drinkes in Turkey.
                      But I doe much maruell
that no Englishman, or Dutehman, or German, doth set vp Brewing in Constantinople;
Considering they haue such Quantitie of Barley. For as so

the generall Sort of Men, Frugalitie may be the Cause of Drinking Water;
For that it is no small Sauing, to pay nothing for ones Drinke: But the
better Sort mought well be at the Cost. And yet I wonder the lesse at it,
because I see France, Italie, or Spaine, haue not taken into vse, Beere, or
Ale; Which (perhaps) if they did, would better both their Healths, and
their Complexions. It is likely it would be Matter of great Gaine to any,
that should begin it in Turkey.
                  
                  In Bathing in Hot Water, Sweat (neuerthelesse) commeth not in the
Parts vnder the Water.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching Sweat.
                      The Cause is; First, for that Sweat is a Kinde of
Colliquation. And that Kinde of Colliquation is not made, either by an 
                     Ouer-Drie Heat, or an Ouer-Moist Heat. For Ouer-Moisture doth somewhat
extinguish the Heat; As wee see that euen Hot Water quencheth
Fire: And Ouer-Drie Heat shutteth the Pores: And therefore Men will
sooner Sweat couered before the Sunne, or Fire, than if they stood Naked;
And Earthen Bottles, filled with Hot Water, doe prouoke, in Bed, a
Sweat more daintily, than Bricke-bats Hot. Secondly, Hot Water doth
cause Euaporation from the Skin; So as it spendeth the Matter, in those
Parts vnder the Water, before it issueth in Sweat. Againe, Sweat commeth
more plentifully, if the Heat be increased by Degrees, than if it be
greatest at first, or equall. The Cause is, for that the Pores are better opened
by a Gentle Heat, than by a more Violent; And by their opening the
Sweat issueth more abundantly. And therefore Physitians may doe well,
when they prouoke Sweat in Bed, by Bottles, with a Decoction of Sudorisicke
Herbs in Hot Water, to make two Degrees of Heat in the Bottles; And
to lay in the Bed, the lesse Heated first, and after halfe an Houre the more
Heated.
                  
                  
                     Sweat is Salt in Taste; The Cause is, for that, that Part of the Nourishment,
                     
which is Fresh and Sweet, turneth into Bloud, and Flesh; And the
Sweat is only that Part which is Separate, and Excerned. Bloud also Raw
hath some Saltnesse, more than Flesh; because the Assimilation into Flesh,
is not without a little and subtile Excretion from the Bloud.
                  
                  
                     Sweat commeth forth more out of the Vpper Parts of the Body, than 
the Lower; The Reason is, because those Parts are more replenished with
Spirits; And the Spirits are they that put forth Sweat: Besides, they are
lesse Fleshy, and Sweat issueth (chiefly) out of the Parts that are lesse
Fleshy, and more Dry; As the Forehead, and Breast.
                  
                  Men Sweat more in Sleepe, than Waking; And yet Sleepe doth rather 
stay other Fluxions, than cause them; As Rheumes, Loosenesse of the Body,
&amp;c. The Cause is, for that in Sleepe, the Heat and Spirits doe naturally
moue inwards, and there rest. But when they are collected once within,
the Heat becommeth more Violent, and Irritate; And thereby expelleth
Sweat.
                  
                  
                     Cold Sweats are (many times) Mortall, and neere Death; And alwayes 
ill, and Suspected; As in Great Feares, Hypochondricall Passions, &amp;c. The
Cause is, for that Cold Sweats come by a Relaxation or Forsaking of the

                     Spirits, wherby the Moisture of the Body, which Heat did keepe firme in
the Parts, seuereth, and issueth out.
                  
                      In those Diseases, which cannot be discharged by Sweat, Sweat is ill,
and rather to be stayed; As in Diseases of the Lungs, and Fluxes of the
Belly; But in those Diseases, which are expelled by Sweat, it easeth and
lightneth; As in Agues, Pestilences, &amp;c. The Cause is, for that Sweat in
the Latter Sort is partly Criticall, and sendeth forth the Matter that offendeth;
But in the Former, it either proceedeth from the Labour of
the Spirits, which sheweth them Oppressed; Or from Motion of Consent,
when Nature not able to expell the Disease, where it is seated, moueth
to an Expulsion indifferent ouer all the Body.
                  
                  The Nature of the Glo-wormexs is hitherto not well obserued.Experiment Solitary, touching the GloWorme.
                      Thus
much we see; That they breed chiefly in the Hottest Moneths of Summer;
And that they breed not in Champaigne, but in Bushes, and Hedges. Wherby
 it may be conceiued, that the Spirit of them is very fine, and not to
be refined, but by Summer Heats: And againe, that by reason of the
Finenesse, it doth easily exhale. In Italy, and the Hotter Countries, there is
a Fly they call Lucciole, that shineth as the Glo-worme doth; And it may

But yet the two former Obseruations hold; For they are not seene,
but in the Heat of Summer; And Sedge, or other Greene of the Fens, giue
as good Shade, as Bushes. It may be the Glo-wormes of the Cold Countries
ripen not so farre as to be Winged.

                     Feare causeth Palenesse; Trembling; The Standing of the
Haire vpright; Starting; and Skritching. The Palenesse is caused, for that
the Bloud runneth inward, to succour the Heart. The Trembling is caused,
for that through the Flight of the Spirits inward, the Outward Parts
are destituted, and not sustained. Standing Vpright of the Haire is caused,
 for that by the Shutting of the Pores of the Skin, the Haire that lyeth asloape,
must needs Rise, Starting is both an Apprehension of the Thing feared,
(And, in that kinde, it is a Motion of Shrincking;) And likewise an
Inquisition, in the beginning, what the Matter should be; (And in that
kinde it is a Motion of Erection;) And therefore, when a Man would listen
suddenly to any Thing, he Starteth; For the Starting is an Erection
of the Spirits to attend. Skritching is an Appetite of Expelling that which
suddenly striketh the Spirits: For it must be noted, that many Motions,
though they be vnprofitable to expell that which hurteth, yet they are
Offers of Nature, and cause Motions by Consent; As in Groaning, or Crying
vpon Paine.
                  
                  
                     
                     Griefe and Paine cause Sighing; Sobbing; Groaning; Screaming; and
Roaring; Teares; Distorting of the Face; Grinding of the Teeth; Sweating.
Sighing is caused by the Drawing in of a greater Quantity of Breath to refresh
the Heart that laboureth: like a great Draught when one is thirsty.

                     Sobbing is the same Thing stronger. Groaning, and Screaming, and Roaring,
are caused by an Appetite of Expulsion, as hath beene said: For when
the Spirits cannot expell the Thing that hurteth, in their Strife to do it,
by Motion of Consent, they expell the Voice. And this is, when the Spirits
yeeld, and giue ouer to resist; For if one doe constantly resist Paine, he
will not groane. Teares are caused by a Contraction of the Spirits of
the Braine; Which Contraction by consequence astringeth the Moisture
of the Braine, and thereby sendeth Teares into the Eyes. And this Contraction,
or Compression causeth also Wringing of the Hands; For Wringing
is a Gesture of Expression of Moisture. The Distorting of the Face is
caused by a Contention, first to beare and resist, and then to expell; Which
maketh the Parts knit first, and afterwards open. Grinding of the Teeth
is caused (likewise) by a Gathering and Serring of the Spirits together to
resist; Which maketh the Teeth also to set hard one against another.
Sweating is also a Compound Motion by the Labour of the Spirits, first to
resist, and then to expell.
                  
                     Ioy causeth a Chearefulnesse, and Vigour in the Eyes; Singing; Leaping; 
Dancing; And sometimes Teares. All these are the Effects of the Dilatation,
and Comming forth of the Spirits into the Outward Parts; Which
maketh them more Linely, and Stirring. We know it hath beene seene,
that Excessiue Sudden Ioy, hath caused Present Death, while the Spirits did
spread so much, as they could not retire againe. As for Teares, they are
the Effects of Compression of the Moisture of the Braine. vpon Dilatation
of the Spirits. For Compression of the Spirits worketh an Expression of the
Moisture of the Braine, by Consent, as hath beene said in Griefe. But then
in Ioy, it worketh it diuersly; viz. by Prepulsion of the Moisture, when
the Spirits dilate, and occupy more Roome.
                  
                     Anger causeth Palenesse in some, and the Going and Comming of the 
Colour in Others: Also Trembling in some, Swelling; Foaming at the
Month; Stamping; Bending of the Fist. Palenesse, and Going, and Comming
of the Colour, are caused by the Burning of the Spirits about the
Heart; Which to refresh themselues call in more Spirits from the Outward
Parts. And if the Palenesse be alone, without Sending forth the Colour
againe, it is commonly ioyned with some Feare; But in many there
is no Palenesse at all, but contrariwise Rednesse about the Cheekes, and
Gills; Which is by the Sending forsh of the Spirits in an Appetite to Reuenge.
Trembling in Anger is likewise by a Calling in of the Spirits; And
is commonly, when Anger is ioyned with Feare. Swelling is caused, both
by a Dilatation of the Spirits by Ouer-Heating, and by a Liquefaction or
Boyling of the Humours thereupon. Foaming at the Mouth is from the
same Cause, being an Ebullition. Stamping. and Bending of the Fist, are
caused by an Imagination of the Act of Reuenge.
                  
                  
                     Light Displeasure or Dislike, causeth Shaking of the Head; Frowning,

                        es. These Effects arise from the same Causes that
Trembling, and Horrour doe; Namely, from the Retiring of the Spirits.
but in a lesse degree. For the Shaking of the Head is but a Slow and

Definite Trembling; And is a Gesture of Slight Refusall: And we see also,
that a Dislike causeth (often) that Gesture of the Hand, which wee vse,
when we refuse a Thing, or warne it away. The Frowning, and Knitting
of the Browes, is a Gathering, or Serring of the Spirits, to resist in some
Measure. And we see also, this Knitting of the Browes will follow vpon
earnest Studying, or Cogitation of any Thing, though it bee without
Dislike.
                  
                  
                     
                     Shame causeth Blushing; And Casting downe of the Eyes. Blushing is
the Resort of Bloud to the Face; Which in the Passion of Shame is the
Part that laboureth most. And although the Blushing will be seene in the
whole Breast, if it be Naked, yet that is but in Passage to the Face.
As for the Casting downe of the Eyes, it proceedeth of the Reuerence a
Man beareth to other Men; Whereby, when he is ashamed, he cannot
endure to looke firmely vpon Others: And we see that Blushing, and the
Casting downe of the Eyes both, are more when we come before Many;
Ore Pompeij quid mollius? Nunquàm non coram pluribus erubuit: And likewise
when we come before Great, or Reuerend Persons.
                  
                  
                     
                     Pity causeth sometimes Teares; And a Flexion or Cast of the Eye
aside. Teares come from the same Cause that they doe in Griefe: for Pity
is but Griefe in Anothers Behalfe. The Cast of the Eye is a Gesture of Auersion,
or Loathnesse to behold the Obiect of Pity.
                  
                  
                     
                     Wonder causeth Astonishment, or an Immoueable Posture of the Body;
Casting vp of the Eyes to Heauen; And Lifting vp of the Hands. For Astonishment,
it is caused by the Fixing of the Minde vpon one Obiect of Cogitation,
whereby it doth not spatiate and transcurre, as it vseth: For in
Wonder the Spirits fly not, as in Feare; But onely settle, and are made
lesse apt to moue. As for the Casting vp of the Eyes, and Lifting vp of
the Hands, it is a Kinde of Appeale to the Deity; Which is the Authour,
by Power, and Prouidence, of Strange Wonders.
                  
                  
                     
                     Laughing causeth a Dilatation of the Mouth, and Lips; A Continued
Expulsion of the Breath, with the loud Noise, which maketh the Interiection
of Laughing; Shaking of the Breast, and Sides; Running of the Eyes
with Water, if it be Violent, and Continued. Wherein first it is to be
vnderstood, that Laughing is scarce (properly) a Passion, but hath his
Source from the Intellect; For in Laughing there euer precedeth a Conceit
of somewhat Ridiculous, And therefore it is Proper to Man. Secondly,
that the Cause of Laughing is but a Light Touch of the Spirits, and not
so deepe an Impression as in other Passions. And therefore, (that which
hath no Affinity with the Passions of the Minde) it is moued, and that in
great vehemency, onely by Tickling some Parts of the Body: And we see
that Men euen in a Grieued State of Minde, yet cannot sometimes forbeare
Laughing. Thirdly, it is euer ioyned with some Degree of Delight:
And therefore Exhilaration hath some Affinity with Ioy, though it be a
much Lighter Motion: Res seneraest verum Gandium. Fourthly, that the
Obiect of it is Deformity, Absurdity, Shrew'd Turnes, and the like. Now to
speake of the Causes of the Effects before mentioned, whereunto these

                     Generall Notes giue some Light, For the Dilatation of the Mouth and Lips,
Continued Expulsion of the Breath and Voice, and Shaking of the Breast and
Sides, they proceed (all) from the Dilatation of the Spirits; Especially being
Sudden. So likewise, the Running of the Eyes with Water, (as hath
beene formerly touched, where we spake of the Teares of Ioy and Griefe,)
is an Effect of Dilatation of the Spirits. And for Suddennesse, it is a great
Part of the Matter: For we see, that any Shrew'd Turne that lighteth vpon
Another; Or any Deformity, &amp;c. moueth Laughter in the Instant;
Which after a little time it doth not. So we cannot Laugh at any Thing
after it is Stale, but whilest it is New: And euen in Tickling, if you Tickle
the Sides, and giue warning; Or giue a Hard or Continued Touch, it doth
not moue Laughter so much.
                  
                     Lust causeth a Flagrancy in the Eyes; and Priapisme. The Cause of 
both these is, for that in Lust, the Sight, and the Touch, are the Things
desired: And therefore the Spirits resort to those part
                        •
                     , whch are most
affected. And note well in generall, (For that great Vse may be made
of the Obseruation,) that (euermore) the Spirits, in all Passions, resort
most to the Parts, that labour most, or are most affected. As in the last,
which hath been mentioned, they resort to the Eyes, and Venereous Parts:
In Feare, and Anger, to the Heart: In Shame to the Face: And in Light
Dislikes to the Head.
                  
                  It hath beene obserued by the Ancients and is yet beleeued, that the
Sperme of Drunken Men is Vnfruitfull.
                     Experiments in Consort touching Drunkennesse.
                      The Cause is, for that it is Ouer-moistened,
and wanteth Spissitude. And we haue a merry Saying, that they
that goe Drunke to Bed, get Daughters.

strongly. The 
                        ••••
                      is, for that the Spirits of the Wine, oppresse the Spirits
Animall, and 
                        •••
                      pate Part of the Place, where they are; And so
make them Weake to moue. And therefore Drunken Men are apt to fall
asleepe: And Opiates, and Stupefactines, (as Poppy, Henbane, Hemlocke,
&amp;c.) induce a kinde of Drunkennesse, by the Grossenesse of their Vapour;
As Wine doth by the Quantity of the Vapour. Besides, they rob the Spirits
Animall of their Matter, whereby they are nourished: For the Spirits of
the Wine prey vpon it, as well as they: And so they make the Spirits lesse
Supple, and Apt to moue.
                  
                     Drunken Men imagine euery Thing turneth round; They imagine 
also that Things Come vpon them; They See not well Things a farre off;
Those Things that they See neare hand, they See out of their Place; And
(sometimes) they see Things double. The Cause of the Imagination that
Things turne Round, is, for that the Spirits themselues turne, being compressed
by the Vapour of the Wine: (For any Liquid Body vpon Compression,
turneth, as we see in Water:) And it is all one to the Sight, whether
the Visuall Spirits moue, or the Obiect moueth, or the Medium moueth.
And we see that long Turning Round breedeth the same Imagination.

The Cause of the Imagination that Things come vpon them, is, for that the
Spirits Visuall themselues draw backe; which maketh the Obiect seeme
to come on; And besides, when they see Things turne Round, and
Moue, Feare maketh them thinke they come vpon them. The Cause
that they cannot see Things a farre off, is the Weaknesse of the Spirits; for
in euery Megrim, or Vertige, there is an Obtenebration ioyned with a Semblance
of Turning round; Which we see also in the lighter Sort of Swonnings.
The Cause of Seeing things out of their Place, is the Refraction: of the
Spirits Visuall; For the Vapour is as an Vnequall Medium; And it is, as the
Sight of Things, out of place, in Water. The Cause of Seeing Things double,
is, the Swift and Vnquiet Motion of the Spirits, (being Oppressed,)
to and fro; For, (as was said before,) the Motion of the Spirits Visuall, and
the Motion of the Obiect, make the same Appearances; And for the Swift
Motion of the Obiect, we see, that if you fillip a Lute-String, it sheweth
double, or Treble.
                  
                     
                     Men are sooner Drunke with Small Draughts, than with Great. And
againe, Wine Sugred inebriateth lesse, than Wine Pure. The Cause of the
Former is, for that the Wine descendeth not so fast to the Bottome of the
Stomach; But maketh longer Stay in the Vpper Part of the Stomach, and
sendeth Vapours faster to the Head; And therefore inebriateth sooner.
And, for the same Reason, Sops in Wine, (Quantity for Quantity,) inebriate
more, than Wine of it selfe. The Cause of the Latter is, for that the
Sugar doth inspissate the Spirits of the Wine, and maketh them not so
easie to resolue into Vapour. Nay further, it is thought, to be some Remedy
against Inebriating, if Wine Sugred be taken after Wine Pure. And
the same Effect is wrought either by Oyle, or Milke, taken vpon much
Drinking.
                  
                  The Vse of Wine, in Dry, and Consumed Bodies, is hurtfull; In Moist,
and Full Bodies, it is good. The Cause is, for that the Spirits of the Wine
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Helpe or Hint of Wine, though Moderately vsed.
                     
doe prey vpon the Dew, or Radicall Moisture, (as they terme it,) of the
Body, and so deceiue the Animall Spirits. But where there is Moisture
Enough, or Superfluous, there Wine helpeth to disgest, and desiccate
 the Moisture.
                  
                  The Catterpiller is one of the most Generall of Wormes, and breedeth
of Dew, and Leaues: For we see infinite Number of Catterpillers,
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Catterpillers.
                     
which breed vpon Trees, and Hedges; By which the Leaues of the Trees,
                      or Hedges, are in great Part consumed; As well by their Breeding out of
the Leafe, as by their Feeding vpon the Leafe. They breed in the Spring
chiefly, because then there is both Dew, and Leafe. And they breed commonly
when the East Winds haue much blowne: The Cause whereof is,
the Drinesse of that Wind: For to all Viuification vpon Putrefaction, it is
requisite the Matter be not too Moist: And therefore we see, they haue
Copwebs about them, which is a signe of a Slimy Drinesse: As we see vpon
the Ground, whereupon, by Dew, and Sunne, Copwebs breed all ouer.

We see also the Greene Catterpiller breedeth in the Inward Parts of Roses,
especially not blowne, where the Dew sticketh: But especially Catterpillers,
both the greatest, and the most, breed vpon Cabbages, which haue
a Fat Leafe, and apt to Putrifie. The Catterpiller towards the End of Summer
waxeth Volatile, and turneth to a Butterfly, or perhaps some other
Fly. There is a Catterpiller, that hath a Furre, or Downe vpon him, and seemeth
to haue Affinity with the Silke-worme
                  
                  The Flyes Cantharides are bred of a Worme, or Catterpiller, but peculiar
to certaine Fruit-Trees; As are the Fig-tree, the Pine-tree, and the
Wilde Briar; All which beare Sweet Fruit; And Fruit that hath a kinde
of secret Biting, or Sharpnesse: For the Fig hath a Milke in it, that is Sweet,
                     
and Corrosiue: The Pine-Apple hath a Kernell that is Strong and Absterside:
The Fruit of the Briar is said to make Children, or those that Eat
them, Scabbed. And therefore, no maruell though Cantharides

but is bred of a Duller Matter. The Body of the Cantharides is bright
coloured; And it may be, that the delicate-coloured Dragon-Flies, may
haue likewise some Corrosiue Quality.
                  
                  
                     Lassitude is remedied by Bathing, or Annointing with Oyle, and Warme
water.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching Lassitude.
                      The Cause is, for that all Lassitude is a kinde of Contusion, and Compression
of the Parts; And Bathing, and Annointing giue a Relaxation, or
Emollition: And the Mixture of Oyle, and Water, is better than either of 
them alone; Because Water Entreth better into the Pores, and Oyle after
Entry softneth better. It is found also, that the Taking of Tobacco doth
helpe and discharge Lassitude. The Reason whereof is, partly, because by
Chearing or Comforting of the Spirits it openeth the Parts Compressed,
or Contused: And chiefly, because it refresheth the Spirits by the Opiate
Vertue thereof; And so dischargeth Wearinesse; as Sleepe likewise
doth.

                  The Casting of the Skin, is by the Ancients compared, to the Breaking
of the Secundine, or Call; but not rightly: For that were to make
euery Casting

                      of the Skin a New Birth: And besides, the Secundine is but
a generall Couer, not shaped according to the Parts; But the Skin is shaped
according to the Parts. The Creatures, that cast their Skin, are; The 
                     Snake, the Viper, the Grashopper, the Lizard, the Silke worme, &amp;c. Those
that cast their Shell, are; The Lobster, the Crab, the Crafish, the Hodmandod
or Dedman, the Tortoise, &amp;c. The Old Skins are found, but the Old
Shells neuer: So as it is like, they scale off, and crumble away by degrees.
And they are knowne, by the Extreme Tendernesse and Softnesse
                     
of the New Shell; And somewhat by the Freshnesse of the Colour of it.
The Cause of the Casting of Skin, and Shell, should seeme to be the great
Quantity of Matter in those Creatures, that is fit to make Skin, or Shell;
And againe, the Loosenesse of the Skin, or Shell, that sticketh not close to
the Flesh. For it is certaine, that it is the New Skin, or Shell, that putteth
off the Old: So we see, that in Deere, it is the Young Horne, that putteth
off the Old; And in Birds, the Young Feathers put off the Old: And
so Birds, that haue much Matter for their Beake, cast their Beakes; the
New Beake Putting off the Old.

more Wholesome.Experiments in Consort touching the Postures of the Body.
                      The Reason is, the better Comforting of the Stomach,
which is by that lesse Pensile: And we see, that in Weake Stomachs, the
 Laying vp of the Legs high, and the Knees almost to the Mouth, helpeth,
and comforteth. We see also that Gally-Slanes, notwithstanding
their Misery otherwise, are commonly Fat and Fleshy; And the Reason
is, because the Stomach is supported somewhat in Sitting; And is Pensile
in Standing, or Going. And therefore, for Prolongation of Life, it is
good to choose those Exercises, where the Limbes moue more than the
Stomach, and Belly; As in Rowing, and in Sawing being Set.
                  
                  
                     
                     Megrims and Giddinesse are rather when we Rise, after long Sitting,
than while we Sit. The Cause is, for that the Vapours, which were gathered
by Sitting, by the Sudden Motion, fly more vp into the Head.
                  
                  
                     
                     Leaning long vpon any Part maketh it Numme, and, as wee call it,

the Spirits to haue free Accesse; And therefore, when wee come out
of it, wee feele a Stinging or

                      The
Cause is plaine; For that those Creatures being engendred of Putrefaction,
                      when they abound, shew a generall Disposition of the Yeare, and Constitution
of the Aire, to Diseases of Putrefaction. And the same Prognesticke, (as hath beene said before,) holdeth, if you finde Wormes in OakeApples.
For the Constitution of the Aire, appeareth more subtilly, in any
of these Things, than to the Sense of Man.
                  
                  It is an Obseruation amongst Country-People, that Yeares of Store of

it to Gods Prouidence, that, (as the Scripture saith) reacheth euen to the
Falling of a Sparrow; And much more is like to reach to the Preseruation

                      The Naturall Cause also may be the Want of
Heat, and Abundance of Moisture, in the Summer precedent; Which putteth
forth those Fruits, and must needs leaue great Quantity of Cold Vapours,

same Name, as Blacke as Soot, and of a Strong Sent, but not Aromaticall;
Which they take, beaten into Powder, in Water, as Hot as they can
drinke it: And they take it, and sit at it, in their Coffa-Houses, which are
like our Tauernes.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Medicines that Condense, and Releeue the Spirits.
                      This Drinke comforteth the Braine, and Heart, and
helpeth Disgestion. Certainly this Berry Coffa; The Root, and Leafe Betel;
                     
The Leafe Tobacco; And the Teare of Poppy, (Opium,) of which the
Turks are great Takers, (supposing it expelleth all Feare;) doe all Condense
the Spirits, and make them Strong, and Aleger. But it seemeth
they are taken after seuerall manners; For Coffa and Opium are taken
downe; Tobacco but in Smoake; And Betel is but champed in the Mouth,
with a little Lime. It is like there are more of them, if they were well
found out, and well corrected. Quare of Henbane-Seed; Of Mandrake;
Of Saffron, Root, and Flower; Of Folium Indum; Of Amber-grice; Of
the Assyrian Amomum, if it may be had; And of the Scarlet Powder,
which they call Kermez; And (generally) of all such Things, as doe inebriate,
and prouoke Sleepe. Note that Tobacco is not taken in Root, or
Seed, which are more forcible euer than Leaues.
                  
                  The Turkes haue a Blacke Powder, made of a Minerall called Alcohole;
Which with a fine long Pencill they lay vnder their Eye-lids; Which doth
colour them Blacke; Whereby the White of the Eye is set off more white.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Faintings of the Body.
                     
With the same Powder they colour also the Haires of their Eye-lids, and 
of their Eye-browes, which they draw into Embowed Arches. You shall
finde that Xenophon maketh Mention, that the Medes vsed to paint their
Eyes. The Turkes vse with the same Tincture, to colour the Haire of their
Heads and Beards Blacke: And diuers with vs, that are growne Gray,
and yet would appeare Young, finde meanes to make their Haire blacke,
by Combing it, (as they say,) with a Leaden Combe, or the like. As for
the Chineses, who are of an ill Complexion, (being Oliuaster,) they paint
their Cheekes Scarlet; Especially their King, and Grandes. Generally,
Barbarous People, that goe Naked, doe not onely paint Themselues, but
they pownce and raze their Skinne, that the Painting may not be taken
forth; And make it into Works. So doe the West Indians; And so did
the Ancient Picts, and Brittons; So that it seemeth, Men would haue
the Colours of Birds Feathers, if they could tell how; Or at least, they will
haue Gay Skins, instead of Gay Cloathes.
                  
                  It is strange, that the Vse of Bathing, as a Part of Diet, is left.Experiment Solitary, touching the Vse of Bathing and Annointing.
                      With
the Romans, and Grecians, it was as vsuall, as Eating, or Sleeping: And
so is it amongst the Turkes at this day: Whereas with vs it remaineth but
as a Part of Physicke. I am of Opinion, that the Vse of it, as it was with
the Romans, was hurtfull to Health; For that it made the Body Soft, and 
easie to Waste. For the Turkes it is more proper, because that their Drinking

Water, and Feeding vpon Rize, and other Food of small Nourishment,
maketh their Bodies so Solide, and Hard, as you need not feare
that Bathing should make them Froathie. Besides, the Turkes are great
Sitters, and seldome walke; Whereby they Sweat lesse, and need Bathing
more. But yet certaine it is, that Bathing, and especially Annointing, may
be so vsed, as it may be a great Helpe to Health, and Prolongation of Life.
But hereof we shall speake in due Place, when we come to handle Experiments
Medicinall.
                  
                  The Turkes haue a Pretty Art of Chamoletting of Paper, which is not
with vs in vse.Experiment Solitary, touching Chamoletting of Paper.
                      They take diuers Oyled Colours, and put them seuerally
(in drops) vpon Water; And stirre the Water lightly; And then wet their

                     Paper, (being of some Thicknesse,) with it; And the Paper will be Waued,
and Veined, like Chamolet, or Marble.
                  
                  It is somewhat strange, that the Bloud of all Birds, and Beasts, and
Fishes, should be of a Red Colour, and only the Bloud of the Cuttle should
be as Blacke as Inke.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching CuttleInke.
                      A Man would thinke, that the Cause should be the

                     High Concoction of that Bloud; For wee see in ordinary Puddings, that the
Boyling turneth the Bloud to be Blacke; And the Cuttle is accounted a delicate
Meat, and is much in Request.
                  It is reported of Credit, that if you take Earth, from Land adioyning
to the Riuer of Nile; And preserue it in that manner, that it neither come
to be Wet, nor Wasted; And Weigh it daily, it will not alter Weight
vntill the seuenteenth of Iune, which is the Day when the Riuer beginneth
 to rise; And then it will grow more and more Ponderous, till the Riuer
commeth to his Heighth Which if it be true, it cannot be caused,
but by the Aire, which then beginneth to Condense; And so turneth
within that Small Mould into a degree of Moisture; Which produceth
Weight.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Encrease of Weigh, in Earth.
                      So it hath beene obserued, that Tobacco, Cut, and Weighed,
and then Dried by the Fire, loseth Weight; And after being laid in the
open Aire, recouereth Weight againe. And it should seeme, that as soone
as euer the Riuer beginneth to increase, the whole Body of the Aire thereabouts
suffereth a Change: For (that which is more strange,) it is credibly
affirmed, that vpon that very Day, when the Riuer first riseth,
great Plagues, in Caire, vse suddenly to breake vp.
                  Those that are very Cold, and especially in their Feet, cannot get to
Sleepe.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching Sleepe.
                      The Cause may be, for that in Sleepe is required a Free Respiration,
which Cold doth shut in, and hinder: For wee see, that in great Colds, one
 can scarce draw his Breath. Another Cause may be, for that Cold calleth
the Spirits to succour; And therefore they cannot so well close; and goe
together in the Head; Which is euer requisite to Sleepe. And for the
same Cause, Paine, and Noise hinder Sleepe; And Darknesse (contrariwise)
furthereth Sleepe.
                  
                  
                     Some Noises (whereof wee spake in the 112. Experiment) helpe 
                     Sleepe; As the Blowing of the Wind, the Trickling of Water, Humming of
Bees, Soft Singing, Reading, &amp;c. The Cause is, for that they moue in the
Spirits a gentle Attention; And whatsoeuer moueth Attention, without
too much Labour, stilleth the Naturall and discursiue Motion of the
Spirits.
                  
                  
                     Sleepe nourisheth, or at least preserueth Bodies, a long time, without 
other Nourishment. Beasts that sleepe in Winter, (as it is noted of Wilde
Beares,) during their Sleep wax very Fat, though they Eat nothing. Bats
haue beene found in Ouens, and other Hollow Close Places, Matted
one vpon another; And therefore it is likely that they Sleepe in the Winter
time, and eat Nothing. Quare, whether Bees doe not Sleepe all Winter,
and spare their Honey? Butterflies, and other Flies, doe not onely
Sleepe, but lye as Dead all Winter; And yet with a little Heat of Sunne, or
Fire, reuine againe. A Dormonse, both Winter and Summer, will Sleepe
some dayes' together, and eat Nothing.
                  
                  To restore Teeth in Age, were Magnale Naturae.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching Teeth and Hard Substances in the Bodies of Liuing Creatures.
                      It may be
thought of. But howsoeuer the Nature of the Teeth deserueth
to be enquired of, as well as the other Parts of Liuing Creatures
Bodies.
                  
                  There be Fiue Parts in the Bodies of Liuing-Creatures, that are of Hard
                     
Substance; The Skull; The Teeth; The Bones; The Hornes; and the Nailes.
The greatest Quantity of Hard Substance Continued, is towards the
Head. For there is the Skull of one Entire Bone; There are the Teeth;
There are the Maxillary Bones; There is the Hard Bone, that is the Instrument
of Hearing; And thence issue the Hornes: So that the Building of
Liuing Creatures Bodies, is like the Building of a Timber-House, where the
Walls, and other Parts haue Columnes, and Beames; But the Roofe is, in
the better Sort of Houses, all Tile, or Lead, or Stone. As for Birds, they haue
Three other Hard Substances proper to them; The Bill, which is of like
Matter with the Teeth; For no Birds haue Teeth: The Shell of the Egge:
And their Quills: For as for their Spurre, it is but a Naile. But no Liuing-Creatures,
that haue Shells very hard; (As Oysters, Cockles, Mussles,
Scallops, Crabs, Lobsters, Cra-fish, Shrimps, and especially the Tortoise,)
haue Bones within them, but onely little Gristles.
                  
                  
                     Bones, after full Growth, continue at a Stay: And so doth the Skull:
Hornes, in some Creatures, are cast, and renued: Teeth stand at a Stay
except their Wearing: As for Nailes, they grow continually: And Bills
and Beakes will ouer-grow, and sometimes be cast; as in Eagles, and
Parrots.
                  
                  Most of the Hard Substances fly to the Extremes of the Body, As Skull,
Hornes, Teeth, Nailes, and Beakes: Onely the Bones are more Inward, and
clad with Flesh. As for the Entrailes, they are all without Bones; Saue
that a Bone is (sometimes) found in the Heart of a Stag; And it may be
in some other Creature.
                  
                  
                     
                      The Skull hath Braines, as a kinde of Marrow, within it. The
Back-Bone hath one Kinde of Marrow, which hath an Affinity with
the Braine; And other Bones of the Body haue another. The Iaw-Bones
haue no Marrow Seuered, but a little Pulpe of Marrow diffused. Teeth
likewise are thought to haue a kind of Marrow diffused, which causeth
the Sense, and Paine: But it is rather Sinnew; For Marrow hath no
Sense; No more than Bloud. Horne is alike throughout; And so is the
Naile.
                  
                  
                      None other of the Hard Substances haue Sense, but the Teeth: And
the Teeth haue Sense, not onely of Paine, but of Cold.
                  
                  
                     But we will leaue the Enquiries of other Hard Substances, vnto their
seuerall Places; And now enquire onely of the Teeth.
                  
                      The Teeth are, in Men, of three Kindes: Sharpe, as the Fore-Teeth;
Broad, as the Back-Teeth, which we call the Molar-Teeth, or Grinders; And
Pointed-Teeth, or Canine, which are betweene both. But there haue beene
some Men, that haue had their Teeth vndiuided, as of one whole Bone,
with some little Marke in the Place of the Diuision; As Pyrrhus had.
Some Creatures haue Ouer-long, or Out-growing Teeth, which wee call
Fangs, or Tuskes; As Boares, Pikes, Salmons, and Dogs though lesse. Some
Liuing Creatures haue Teeth against Teeth; As Men, and Horses; And
some haue Teeth, especially their Master-Teeth, indented one within Another,
like Sawes; As Lions; And so againe haue Dogs. Some Fishes haue
diuers Rowes of Teeth in the Roofes of their Mouthes; As Pikes, Salmons,
Trouts, &amp;c. And many more in Salt-Waters. Snakes, and other Serpents,
haue Venomous Teeth; which are sometimes mistaken for their Sting.
                  
                  
                      No Beast that hath Hornes, hath Vpper Teeth; And no Beast, that
hath Teeth aboue, wanteth them below: But yet if they be of the same
kinde, it followeth not, that if the Hard Matter goeth not into Vpper
Teeth, it will goe into Hornes; Not yet 
                        ••
                      
                     conuerse; For Doe's, that haue
no Hornes, haue no Vpper Teeth.
                  
                  
                     
                     Horses haue, at three yeares old, a Tooth put forth, which they call
the Colts Tooth; And at foure yeares old there commeth the Mark-Tooth,
which hath a Hole, as big as you may lay a Pease within it; And that weareth
shorter and shorter, euery yeare; Till that at eight yeares old, the
Tooth is smooth, and the Hole gone; And then they say; That the Marke
is out of the Horses Mouth.
                  
                  
                      The Teeth of Men breed first, when the Childe is about a yeare and
halfe old: And then they cast them, and new come about seuen yeares
old. But diuers haue Backward-Teeth come forth at Twenty, yea some
at Thirty, and Forty. Quare of the manner of the Comming of them
forth. They tell a Tale of the old Countesse of Desmond, who liued till
she was seuen-score yeares old, that she did Dentire, twice, or thrice; Casting
her old Teeth, and others Comming in their Place.
                  
                     
                     Teeth are much hurt by Sweet-Meats; And by Painting with Mercury;
And by Things Ouer-hot; And by Things Ouer-cold; And by Rheumes. And
the Paine of the Teeth, is one of the sharpest of Paines.
                  
                  
                     Concerning Teeth, those Things are to be Considered. 1. The 
                     Preseruing of them. 2. The Keeping of them White. 3. The Drawing of
them with Least Paine. 4. The Staying and Easing of the Tooth-ach. 5. The
Binding in of Artificiall Teeth, where haue beene strucken out.
6. And last of all, that Great One, of Restoring Teeth in Age. The Instances
that giue any likelihood of Restoring Teeth in Age, are; The Late
Comming of Teeth in some; And the Renewing of the Beakes in Birds,
which are Commateriall with Teeth. Quare therefore more particularly
how that commeth. And againe, the Renewing of Hornes. But yet
that hath not beene knowne to haue beene prouoked by Art; Therfore let Triall be made, whether Hornes may be procured to grow in Beasts
that are not Horned, and how? And whether they may be procured to
come Larger than vsuall; As to make an Oxe, or a Deere, haue a Greater
Head of Hornes? And whether the Head of a Deere, that by Age is more
Spitted, may be brought againe to be more Branched; For those Trialls,
and the like, will shew, whether by Art such Hard Matter can be called,
and prouoked. It may be tryed also, whether Birds may not haue some
thing done to them, when they are Young, wherby they may be made to
haue Greater, or Longer Bills; Or Greater and Longer Tallons? And whether
Children may not haue some Wash, or Something to make their
Teeth Better, and Stronger? Corall is in vse as an Helpe to the Teeth of
Children.
                  
                  Some Liuing Creatures generate but at certaine Seasons of the Yeare;
As Deere, Sheepe, Wilde Conneyes, &amp;c.Experiments in Consort, touching the Generation and Bearing of Liuing Creatures in the Wombe.
                     
And most Sorts of Birds, and
Fishes: Others at any time of the Yeare, as Men; And all Domesticke Creatures;
As Horses, Hogges, Dogges, Cats, &amp;c. The Cause of Generation at
all Seasons seemeth to be Fulnesse: For Generation is from Redundance.
This Fulnesse ariseth from two Causes; Either from the Nature of the 
                     Creature, if it be Hot, and Moist, and Sanguine; Or from Plenty of Food.
For the first, Men, Horses, Dogges, &amp;c. which breed at all Seasons, are full
of Heat, and Moisture; Dones are the fullest of Heat and Moisture amongst
Birds, and therefore breed often; The Tame Doue almost continually. But
Deere are a Melancholy Dry Creature, as appeareth by their Fearefulnesse,
and the Hardnesse of their Flesh. Sheepe are a Cold Creature, as appeareth
by their Mildnesse, and for that they seldome Drinke. Most sort of Birds
are of a dry Substance in comparison of Beasts, Fishes are cold. For the second Cause, Fulnesse of Food; Men, Kine, Swine, Dogs, &amp;c. seed full; And
we see that those Creatures, which being Wilde, generate seldome, being
Tame, generate often; Which is from Warmth, and Fulnesse of Food. We
finde, that the Time of Going to Rut of Deore is in September; For that
they need the whole Summers Feed and Grasse, to make them fit for Generation.
And if Raine come Earely about the Middle of September, they
goe to Rut somewhat the sooner; If Drought, somewhat the later. So
Sheepe, in respect of their small Neat. generate about the same time, or
somewhat before. But for the most part, Creatures that generate at certaine

                     Seasons, generate in the Spring; As Birds, and Fishes; For that the
End of the Winter, and the Heat, and Comfort of the Spring prepareth
them. There is also another Reason, why some Creatures generate at certaine
Seasons: And that is the Relation of their Time of Bearing, to the
time of Generation: For no Creature goeth to generate, whilest the
Female is full; Nor whilest shee is busie in Sitting or Rearing her Young.
And therefore it is found by Experience, that if you take the Egges, or
Young Ones, out of the Neasts of Birds, they will fall to generate againe,
three or foure times, one after another.
                  
                      Of Liuing Creatures, some are Longer time in the Wombe, and some
Shorter. Women goe commonly nine Moneths; The Cow and the Ewe
about six Moneths; Doe's goe about nine Moneths; Mares eleuen
Moneths; Bitches nine Weekes; Elephants are said to goe two Yeares;
For the Receiued Tradition of ten Yeares is Fabulous. For Birds there is
double Enquiry; The Distance betweene the Treading or Coupling, and
the Laying of the Egge; And againe betweene the Egge Layed, and the
Disclosing or Hetching. And amongst Birds, there is lesse Diuersity of Time,
than amongst other Creatures; yet some there is: For the Hen sitteth
but three Weekes; The Turky-Hen, Goose, and Ducke, a Moneth: Quare
of others. The Cause of the great Difference of Times, amongst Liuing
Creatures, is, Either from the Nature of the Kinde; Or from the Constitution
of the Wombe. For the former, those that are longer in Comming to
their Maturity or Growth, are longer in the Wombe; As is chiefly seene in
Men; And so Elephants which are long in the Wombe, are long time in
Comming to their full Growth. But in most other Kindes, the Constitution
of the Wombe, (that is, the Hardnesse or Drinesse thereof,) is concurrent
with the former Cause. For the 
                        
                           ••
                        lt hath about foure yeares of Growth;
And so the Fawne; And so the Calfe. But Whelps, which come to their
Growth (commonly) within three Quarters of a yeare, are but nine
Weekes in the Wombe. As for Birds, as there is lesse Diuersity, amongst
them, in the time of their Bringing forth; So there is lesse Diuersity in
the time of their Growth; Most of them comming to their Growth within
a Twelue-Moneth.
                  
                      Some Creatures bring forth many Young Ones at a Burthen; As Bitches,
Hares, Conneyes, &amp;c. Some (ordinatily) but One; As Women, Lionesses,
&amp;c. This may be caused, either by the Quantity of Sperme required
to the Producing One of that Kinde; which if lesse be required, may
admit greater Number; If more, fewer: Or by the Partitions and Cells
of the Wombe, which may feuer the Sperme.
                  
                  There is no doubt, but Light by Refraction will shew greater, as well
as Things Coloured.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching Species Visible.
                     
For like as a Shilling, in the Bottomes of the Water. will
shew greater; So will a Candle in a Lanthorne, in the Bottome of the Water.
                      I haue heard of a Practise, that Glo-wormes in Glasses were put in the
Water, to make the Fish come. But I am not yet informed, whether
when a Diuer Diueth, hauing his Eyes open, and swimmeth vpon his

                     Backe; whether (I say) he seeth Things in the Aire greater, or lesse. For it
is manifest, that when the Eye standeth in the Finer Medium, and the Obiect
is in the Grosser, things shew greater; But contrariwise, when the
Eye is placed in the Grosser Medium, and the Obiect in the Finer, how it
worketh I know not.
                  It would be well boulted out, whether great Refractions may not be 
made vpon Reflexions, as well as vpon Direct Beames. For Example, We
see that take an Empty Basen, put an Angell of Gold, or what you will, into
it; Then goe so farre from the Basen, till you cannot see the Angell, because
it is not in a Right Line; Then fill the Basen with Water, and you
shall see it out of his Place, because of the Reflexion. To proceed therefore,
put a Looking-Glasse into a Basen of Water; I suppose you shall not
see the Image in a Right Line, or at equall Angles, but aside. I know not,
whether this Experiment may not be extended so, as you might see the
Image, and not the Glasse; Which for Beauty, and Strangenesse, were a
fine Proofe: For then you should see the Image like a Spirit in the Aire.
As for Example, If there be a Cesterne or Poole of Water. you shall place
ouer against it a Picture of the Deuill, or what you will, so as you doe not
see the Water. Then put a Looking-Glasse in the Water: Now if you can
see the Deuills Picture aside, not seeing the Water, it will looke like a Deuill
indeed. They haue an old Tale in Oxford, that Friar Bacon walked
betweene two Steeples: Which was thought to be done by Glasses, when
he walked vpon the Ground.
                  
                  A Weighty Body put into Motion, is more easily impelled, than at first
when it Resteth.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching Impulsion, and Percussion.
                     
The Cause is, Partly because Motion doth discusse the
Torpour of Solide Bodies, Which beside their Motion of Grauity, haue in
them a Naturall Appetite, not to moue at all; And partly, because a Body
that resteth, doth get, by the Resistance of the Body vpon which it resteth,
a stronger Compression of Parts, than it hath of it Selfe: And therefore
needeth more Force to be put in Motion. For if a Weighty Body be Pensile,
and hang but by a Thred, the Percussion will make an Impulsion very
neare as easily, as if it were already in Motion.
                  
                  A Body Ouer-great, or Ouer-small, will not be throwne so farre, as a 
                     Body of a Middle Sixe: So that (it seemeth) there must be a Commensuration,
or Proportion, betweene the Body Moued, and the Force, to make it
moue well. The Cause is, because to the Impulsion, there is requisite the
Force of the Body that Moueth, and the Resistance of the Body that is Moued:
And if the Body be too great, it yeeldeth too little; And if it be too
small, it resisteth too little.
                  It is Common Experience, that no Weight will presse or cut so strong,
being laid vpon a Body, as Falling, or strucken from aboue. It may be
the Aire hath some part in furthering the Percussion: But the chiefe Cause
I take to be, for that the Parts of the Body Moued, haue by Impulsion, or
by the Motion of Grauity continued, a Compression in them, as well downwards,
as they haue when they are throwne, or Shot thorow the Aire,
                     
forwards. I conceiue also, that the quicke Loose of that Motion, preuenteth
the Resistance of the Body below; And Priority of the Force, (alwaies,)
is of great Efficacy; As appeareth in infinite Instances.
                  
                  
                     Tickling is most in the Soles of the Feet, and vnder the Arme-Holes,
and on the Sides.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Titillation.
                     
The Cause is, the Thinnesse of the Skin in those Parts;
Ioyned with the Rarenesse of being touched there. For all Tickling is a
 light Motion of the Spirits, which the Thinnesse of the Skin, and Suddennesse,
and Rarenesse of Touch, doe further: For we see, a Feather, or a Rush,
drawne along the Lip. or Cheeke, doth tickle; Whereas a Thing more
Obtuse, or a Touch more Hard, doth not. And for Suddennesse; We see
no Man can tickle himselfe: Wee see also, that the Palme of the Hand,
though it hath as Thinne a Skin as the other Parts Mentioned, yet is not
Ticklish, because it is accustomed to be Touched. Tickling also causeth
Laughter. The Cause may be, the Emission of the Spirits, and so of the
Breath, by a Flight from Titillation; For vpon Tickling, we see there is euer
a Starting, or Shrinking away of the Part, to auoid it; And we see also,
that if you Tickle the Nosthrills, with a Feather, or Straw, it procureth
Sneezing; Which is a Sudden Emission of the Spirits, that doe likewise
expell the Moisture. And Tickling is euer Painfull, and not well endured.
                  It is strange, that the Riuer of Nilus, Ouer-flowing, as it doth, the
Country of AEgypt, there should be neuerthelesse little or no Raine in that
Country.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Scarcity of Raine in AEgypt:
                     
The Cause must be, Either in the Nature of the Water; Or in
the Nature of the Aire; Or of Both. In the Water, it may be ascribed, either
 vnto the Long 
                           •••
                        
                      of the Water: For Swift Running Waters vapour,
not so much as Standing Waters; Or else to the Concoction of the Water;
For Waters well Concocted vapour not so much, as Waters Raw; No more
than Waters vpon the Fire doe vapour so much, after some time of Boyling,
as at the first. And it is true, that the Water of Nilus is sweeter than
other Waters in Taste; And it is excellent Good for the Stone, and Hypochondriacall
Melancholy; Which sheweth it is Lenefying: And it runneth
thorow a Countrey of a Hot Climate, and flat, without Shade, either
of Woods, or Hills; Whereby the Sunne must needs haue great Power
to Concoct it. As for the Aire, (from whence I conceiue this Want of
Showers commeth chiefly;) The Cause must be, for that the Aire is, of
it selfe, Thin and Thirsty; And as soone as euer it getteth any Moisture
from the Water, it imbibeth, and dissipateth it, in the whole body of the
Aire; And suffereth it not to remaine in Vapour; Whereby it might
breed Raine.
                  
                  It hath beene touched in the Title of Percolations, (Namely such as
are Inwards,) that the Whites of Eggs, and Milke, doe clarifie; And it is
certaine, that in AEgypt, they prepare and clarifie the Water of Nile, by
 putting it into great Iarres of Stone, and Stirring it about with a few

Stamped Almonds; Wherewith they also besmeare the Mouth of the
Vessell; And so draw it off, after it hath rested some time.Experiment Solitary, touching Clarification.
                      It were good,
to trie this Clarifying with Almonds, in New Beere, or Must, to hasten, and
perfect the Clarifying.
                  
                  There be scarce to be found any Vegetables, that haue Branches, and
no Leaues; except you allow Corall for one.Experiment Solitary touching Plants without Leaues
                      But there is also in the Desarts of S. Macario in AEgypt, a Plant which is Long, Leauelesse, Browne
of Colour, and Branched like Corall, faue that it closeth at the Top. This 
being set in Water within House, spreadeth and displayeth strangely; And
the People thereabouts haue a Superstitious Beleefe, that in the Labour
of Women, it helpeth to the Easie Deliuerance.
                  
                  The Crystalline Venice Glasse, is reported to be a Mixture, in equall
Portions, of Stones, brought from Pauia, by the Riuer Ticinum; And the
Ashes of a Weed called by the Arabs Kall, which is gathered in a Desart
betweene Alexandria and Rosetta; And is by the AEgyptians vsed first 
for Fuell; And then they crush the Ashes into Lumps, like a Stone; And
so sell them to the Venetians for their Glasse-workes.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Materials of Glasse.
                     
                  
                  It is strange, and well to be noted, how long Carkasses haue continued
Vncorrupt, and in their former Dimensions; As appeareth in the Mummies
of AEgypt; Hauing lafted, as is conceiued, (some of them,) three
thousand yeeres.Experiment Solitary, touching Prohibition of Putrefaction, and the Long Conseruation of Bodies.
                      It is true, they finde Meanes to draw forth the Braines,
and to take forth the Entrailes, which are the Parts apteft to corrupt. But
that is nothing to the Wonder: For wee see, what a Soft and Corruptible 
                     Substance the Flesh, of all the other Parts of the Body, is. But it should
seeme, that according to our Obseruation, and Axiorne, in our hundredth
Experiment, Putrefaction, which we conceiue to be so Naturall a Period
of Bodies, is but an Accident; And that Matter maketh not that Haste to
Corruption, that is conceiued. And therefore Bodies, in Shining-Amber;
In Quicke-Siluer; In Balmes, (whereof wee now speake;) In Wax; In
Honey; In Gummes; And (it may be) in Conseruatories of Snow; &amp;c. are
preserued very long. It need not goe for Repetition, if we resume againe
that which wee said in the aforesaid Experiment, concerning Annihilation;
Namely, that if you prouide against three Causes of Putrefaction,
Bodies will not corrupt: The First is, that the Aire be excluded; For that
vndermineth the Body, and conspireth with the Spirit of the Body to dissolue
it. The Second is, that the Body Adiacent and Ambiens be not Commateriall,
but meerely Heterogeneall towards the Body that is to be
presured: For if Nothing can be receiued by the One, Nothing can issue
from the Other, Such are Quick-Siluer, &amp; White-Amber, to Herbs, and
Flies, and such Bodies. The Third is, that the Body to be preserued, be
not of that Grasse, that it may corrupt within it selfe, although no Part
of it issue into the Body Adiacent: And therefore it must be rather Thinne,
and Small, than of Bulke. There is a Fourth Remedie also, which is;

That if the Body to be preserued be of Bulke, as a Corps is, then the Body
that Incloseth it, must haue a Vertue to draw forth, and drie the Moisture
of the Inward Body; For else the Putrefaction will play within, though
Nothing issue forth. I remember Liuy doth relate, that there were found,
at a time, two Coffins of Lead, in a Tombe; Whereof the one contained
the Body of King Numa; It being some foure hundred yeares after his
Death: And the other, his Bookes of Sacred Rites and Ceremonies, and the
Discipline of the Pontises; And that in the Coffin that had the Body, there
was Nothing (at all) to be seene, but a little light Cinders about the Sides;
But in the Coffin that had the Bookes, they were found as fresh, as if they
had beene but newly Written; being written in Parchment, and couered
ouer with Watch-Candles of Wax, three or foure fold. By this it seemeth,
that the Romans. in Numa's time, were not so good Embalmers, as the
AEgyptians were; Which was the Cause that the Body was vtterly consumed.
But I finde in Plutarch, and Others, that when Augustus Caesar
visited the Sepulchre of Alexander, the Great, in Alexandria, he found the
Body to keepe his Dimension; But withall, that, notwithstanding all the
Embalming, (which no doubt was of the best,) the Body was so Tender,
as Caesar touching but the Nose of it, defaced it. Which maketh mee
finde it very strange, that the Egyptian Mummies should be reported to be
as Hard as Stone-Pitch: For I finde no difference but one; Which indeed
may be very Materiall; Namely, that the Ancient AEgyptian Mummies,
were shrowded in a Number of Folds of Linnen, besmeared with Gums,
in manner of Seare-Cloth; Which it doth not appeare was practised vpon
the Body of Alexander.
                  
                  Neare the Castle of Catie, and by the Wells of Assan, in the Land of
Idumea, a great Part of the Way, you would thinke the Sea were neare
hand, though it be a good distance off: And it is Nothing, but the Shining
of the Nitre, vpon the Sea-Sands; Such Abundance of Nitre the

                     Shores there doe put forth.Experiment Solitary, touching the Abundance of Nitre in certaine Sea-Shoares.
                     
                  
                  The Dead-Sea, which vomiteth vp Bitumen, is of that Crassitude, as
Liuing Bodies bound Hand and Foot, cast into it, haue beene borne vp
and not sunke.Experiment Solitary, touching Bodies that are borne vp by Water.
                      Which sheweth, that all Sinking into Water, is but an
Ouer-Weight of the Body, put into the Water, in respect of the Water: So
 that you may make Water so strong, and heauy, of Quicke-Siluer, (perhaps,)
or the like, as may beare vp Iron: Of which I see no Vse, but Imposture.
Wee see also, that all Metalls, except Gold, for the same reason
swimme vpon Quicke-Siluer.
                  
                  It is reported, that at the Feet of a Hill, neare the More mortuum, there
is a Blacke Stone, (whereof Pilgrims make Fires,) which burneth like a
Coale, and diminisheth not; But only waxeth Brighter, and Whiter.Experiment Solitary, touching Fuell, that consumeth little, or nothing.
                     
That it should doe so, is not strange; For wee see Iron Red Hot burneth,
 and consumeth not: But the Strangenesse is, that it should continue any

time so: For Iron, as soone as it is out of the Fire, deadeth straight waies.
Certainly, it were a Thing of great Vse, and Profit, if you could finde
out Fuell, that would burne Hot, and yet last long, Neither am I altogether
Incredulous, but there may be such Candles, as they say are made
of Salamanders Wooll; Being a Kinde of Minerall, which whiteneth also
in the Burning, and consumeth not. The Question is this; Flame must
be made of somewhat; And commonly it is made of some Tangible Body,
which hath Weight: But it is not impossible, perhaps, that it should be
made of Spirit, or Vapour, in a Body; (which Spirit on Vapour hath no
Weight;) such as is the Matter of Ignis 
                           •••••
                        s. But then you will say,
that that Vapour also can last but a short time: To that it may be answered,
That by the helpe of Oile, and Wax, and other Candle-Stuffe, the Flame
may continue, and the Wieke not burne.
                  
                     Sea-Coale last longer than Char-Coale; And Char-Coale of Roots, being
coaled into great Peeces, last longer than Ordinary Char-Coale, Turfe,
and Peat, and Cow-Sheards, are cheape Fuels, and last long.Experiment Solitary Oeconomicall touching Cheape Fuell.
                      
                     Small-Coale,
or Briar-Coale, powred vpon Char-Coale, make them last longer. Sedge
is a cheape Fuell to Brew, or Bake with; the rather because it is good for 
Nothing else. Triall would be made of some Mixture of Sea-Coale with
Earth, or Chalko; For if that Mixture be, as the Sea-Coale-Men vse it, priuily,
to make the Bulke of the Coale greater, it is Deceit; But if it be vsed
purposely, and be made knowne, it is Sauing.
                  It is, at this Day, in vse, in G
                        ••••
                      to couch Pat-Sheards or Vessels of
Earth, in their Walls, to gather the Wind from the Top; and to passe it
downe in Spouts into Roomes.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Gathering of Wind for Freshnesse.
                      It is a Deuice for Freshnesse, in great Heats:
And it is said, there are some Roomes in Italie, and Spaine, for Freshnesse,
and Gathering the Winds, and Aire, in the Heats of Summer. But they be 
but Pennings of the Winds, and Enlarging them againe, and Making them
Reuerberate, and goe round in Circles, rather than this Deuice of Spouts in
the Wall.
                  
                  There would be vsed much diligence, in the Choice of some Bodies,
and Places, (as it were,) for the Testing of Aire; to discouer the Wholesomenesse
or Vnwholesomenesse, as well of Seasons, as of the Seats of Dwellings.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Trials of Aires.
                     
It is certaine, that there be some Heuses, wherein Confitures, and 
                     Pies, will gather Mould, more than in Others. And I am perswaded,
that a Peece of Raw Flesh, or Fish, will sooner corrupt in some Aires,
than in Others. They be noble Experiments, that can make this Discouerie;
For they serue for a Naturall Diuination of Seasons; Better than
the Astronomer can by their Figures: And againe, they teach Men where
to chuse their Dwelling, for their better Health.
                  
                  There is a Kinde of Stone, about Bethles
                           •
                        , which they grinde to Powder,
and put into Water, whereof Cattell drinke; Which maketh them

giue more Milke.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Increasing of Milke in Milch Beasts. Surely, there would be some better Trialls made of
Mixtures of Water in Ponds for Cattell, to make them more Milch; Or to

                     Fatten them; Or to Keepe them from Murraine, It may be, Chalke, and
Nitre, are of the best.
                  It is reported, that in the Valley, neare the Mountaine Carmel, in Iudea,
there is a Sand, which, of all other, hath most Affinitie with Glasse; Insomuch
as other Mineralls, laid in it, turne to a Glassie Substance, without
the Fire; And againe Glasse put into it, turneth into the Mother-Sand.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Sand of the Nature of Glasse.
                     
                      The Thing is very strange, if it be true: And it is likeliest to be Caused by
some Naturall Fornace, or Heat in the Earth: And yet they doe not speake
of any Eruption of Flames. It were good to trie in Glasse-Workes, whether
the Crude Materialls of Glasse, mingled with Glasse, already made, and
Re-moulten, doe not facilitate the Making of Glasse with lesse Heat.
                  
                  In the Sea, vpon the South-West of Sicilie, much Corall is found.Experiment Solitary, touching the Growth of Corall.
                      It is
a Sub-Marine Plan. It hath no Leanes: It brancheth only when it is vnder
Water; It is Soft, and Greene of Colour; But being brought into the
Aire, it becommeth Hard, and Shining Red, as wee see. It is said also,
 to haue a White Berry; But wee finde it not brought ouer with the Corall.
Belike it is cast away as nothing worth: Inquire better of it, for the Difcouerie
of the Nature of the Plant.
                  
                  The Manns of Calabria is the best, and in most Plenty.Experiment Solitary, touching the Gathering of Manna.
                      They gather
it from the Leafe of the Mulberry Tree; But not of such Mulberry Trees,
as grow in the Valley's. And Manns falleth vpon the Leaues by Night, as
other Deawes doe. It should seeme, that before those Deawes come vpon

                     Trees in the Valley's, they dissipate, and cannot hold out. It should
seeme also, the Mulberry-Leafe, it selfe, hath some Coagulating Vertue,
which inspissateth the Deaw, for that it is not found vpon other Trees:
And wee see by the Silke-Worme, which feedeth vpon that Leafe, what's
Dainty Smooth Iuyce it hath; And the Leaues also, (especially of the
Blacke Mulberry,) are somewhat Bristly, which may helpe to preserue
the Deaw. Certainly, it were not amisse, to obscrue a little better, the
Deawes that fall vpon Trees, or Herbs, Growing on Mountaines; For, it
may be, many Deawes fall, that spend before they come to the Valleys.
And I suppose, that he that would gather the best May-Deaw for Medicine,
should gather it from the Hills.
                  
                  It is said, they haue a manner, to prepare their Greeke-Wines, to keepe
them from Fuming, and Inebriating, by adding some Sulphur, or Allome:
Whereof the one is Vnctnous, and the other is Astringent.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Correcting of Wine.
                      And certaine it
 is, that those two Natures doe best represse Fumes. This Experiment
would be transferred, vnto other Wine, and Strong Beere, by Putting in
some like Substances, while they worke; Which may make them both
to Fume lesse, and to Inflame lesse.
                  
                     It is conceiued by some, (not improbably,) that the reason, why
Wilde-Fires, (Whereof the principall Ingredient is Bitumen,) doe not
quench with Water, is, for that the first Concretion of Bitumen is a Mixture,
of a Fiery, and Watry Substance: So is not Sulphur.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Materialls of WildFire.
                      This appeareth,
for that in the Place neare Puteoli, which they call the Court of Valcan, you 
shall heare, vnder the Earth, a Horrible Thundring of Fire, and Water,
conflicting together: And there breake forth also Spouts of Boyling Water.
Now that Place yeeldeth great Quantities of Bitumen; Whereas
AEtna, and Vesuuius, and the like, which consist vpon Sulphur, shoot
forth Smoake, and Ashes, and Pumice, but no Water. It is reported also,
that Bitumen Mingled with Lime, and Put vnder Water, will make, as it
were, an Artificiall Rocke; The Substance becommeth so Hard.
                  There is a Cement, compounded of Floure, Whites of Egges, and Stone
powdred, that becommeth Hard as Marble; wherewith Piscina mirabilis,
neare Cuma, is said to haue the Walls Plastered.Experiment Solitary, touching Plaster growing as Hard as Marble.
                      And it is certaine, and
tried, that the Powder of Load-Stone, and Flint, by the Addition of
Whites of Egges, and Gumm-Dragon, made into Paste, will in a few dayes 
harden to the Hardnesse of a Stone.
                  
                  It hath beene noted by the Ancients, that in Full or Impure Bodies,
Vlcers or Hurts in the Leggs, are Hard to Cure; And in the Head more
Easie.Experiment Solitary touching Iudgement of the Cure in some Vlcers and Hurts.
                      The Cause is, for that Vlcers or Hurts in the Leggs require Deficcation,
which by the Defluxion of Humours to the Lower Parts is hindred;
Whereas Hurts and Vlcers in the Head require it not; But contrariwise
Drinesse maketh them more apt to Consolidate. And in Moderne Obseruation,
the like difference hath beene found, betweene French-Men,
and English-Men; Where of the ones Constitution is more Dry, and the
others more Moist. And therefore a Hurt of the Head is harder to cure in
a French-Man, and of the Legge in an English-Man.
                  
                  It hath beene noted by the Ancients, that Southerne Winds, blowing
much, without Raine, doe cause a Feuourous Disposition of the Yeare; But
with Raine, not.Experiment Solitary, touching the Healthfulnesse or Vnhealthfulnesse of the Southerne Wind.
                      The Cause is, for that Southerne Winds doe, of themselues,
qualifie the Aire, to be apt to cause Feuers; But when Showers
are ioyned, they doe Refrigerate in Part, and Checke the Sultry Heat
of the Southerne Wind. Therefore this holdeth not in the Sea-Coasts, because
the Vapour of the Sea, without Showers, doth refresh.
                  
                  It hath beene noted by the Ancients, that Wounds which are made
with Brasse, heale more easily, than Wounds made with Iron.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Wounds.
                      The
Cause is, for that Brasse hath, in it selfe, a Sanatiue Vertue; And so in
the very Instant helpeth somewhat: But Iron is Corrosiue, and not Sanatiue.
                     
And therefore it were good, that the Instruments which are
vsed by Chirurgians about Wounds, were rather of Brasse, than Iron.
                  
                  
                     In the Cold Countries, when Mens Noses, and Eares are Mortified, and
(as it were) Gangrened with Cold, if they come to a Fire, they rot off
presently.Experiment Solitary touching Mortification by Cold.
                      The Cause is, for that the few Spirits, that remaine in those

                     Parts, are suddenly drawne forth, and so Putrefaction is made Compleat.
But Snow Put vpon them, helpeth; For that it preserueth those Spirits
that remaine, till they can reuiue; And besides, Snow hath in it a Secret
Warmth: As the Monke proued out of the Text; Qui dat Niuem sicut Lanam,
Gelu sicut Cineres spargit. Whereby he did inferre, that Snow did
warme like Wooll, and Frost did fret like Ashes. Warme Water also doth
good, Because by little and little it openeth the Pores, without any sudden
Working vpon the Spirits. This Experiment may be transferred vnto
the Cure of Gangrenes, either Comming of themselues, or induced by
too much Applying of Opiates: Wherein you must beware of Dry Heat,
and resort to Things that are Refrigerant, with an Inward Warmth, and
Vertue of Cherishing.
                  Weigh Iron, and Aqua Fortis, seuerally; Then dissolue the Iron in
the Aqua Fortis: And weigh the Dissolution; And you shall finde it to
 beare as good Weight, as the Bodies did seuerally: Notwithstanding a
good deale of Wast, by a thicke Vapour, that issueth during the Working:
Which sheweth, that the Opening of a Body, doth increase the Weight.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Weight.
                     
This was tried once, or twice, but I know not, whether there were any
Errour, in the Triall.
                  
                  Take of Aqua-Fortis two Ounces, of Quick-siluer two Drachmes; (For
that Charge the Aqua-Fortis will beare;) The Dissolution will not beare
a Flint, as big as a Nutmeg: Yet (no doubt) the Increasing of the Weight
of Water, will increase his Power of Bearing: As we see Broine, when it
 is Salt enough, will beare an Egge.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Super-Natation of Bodies.
                      And I remember well a Physitian,
that vsed to giue some Minerall Baths for the Gout. &amp;c. And the Body
when it was put into the Bath, could not get downe so easily, as in Ordinary
Water. But it seemeth, the Weight of the Quick-siluer, more than
the Weight of a Stone; doth not compense the Weight of a Stone, more
than the Weight of the Aqua-Fortis.
                  
                  Let there be a Body of Vnequall Weight; (As of Wood and Lead, or
Bone and Lead;) If you throw it from you with the Light-End forward
it will turne, and the Weightier End will recouer to be Forwards; Vnlesse
the Body be Ouer-long.Experiment Solitary, touching the Flying of Vnequall Bodies in the Aire.
                      The Cause is, for that the more Dense Body, hath
 a more Violent Pressure of the Parts, from the first Impulsion; Which is
the Cause, (though heretofore not found out, as hath been often said,)
of all Violent Motions: And when the Hinder Part moueth swifter, (for
that it lesse endureth Pressure of Parts,) than the Forward Part can make
way for it, it must needs be, that the Body turne ouer: For (turned) it
can more easily draw forward the Lighter Part. Ga

                        laeus noteth it well;
That if an Open Trough, wherein Water is, be driuen faster than the Water
                     
can follow, the Water gathereth vpon an heape, towards the Hinder End,
where the Motion began; Which he supposeth, (holding confidently
the Motion of the Earth,) to be the Cause of the Ebbing and Flowing of the
Ocean; Because the Earth ouer-runneth the Water. Which Theory, though
it be false, yet the first Experiment is true. As for the Inequality of the
Pressure of Parts, it appeareth manifestly in this; That if you take a Body
of Stone, or Iron, and another of Wood, of the same Magnitude, and Shape,
and throw them with equall Force, you cannot possibly throw the
Wood, so farre, as the Stone, or Iron.
                  
                  It is certaine, (as it hath beene formerly, in part, touched,) that Water
may be the Medium of Sounds.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Water, that it may be the Medium of Sounds.
                      If you dash a Stone against a Stone in
the Bottome of the Water, it maketh a Sound. So a long Pole strucke vpon
Grauell, in the Bottome of the Water, maketh a Sound. Nay, if you
should thinke that the Sound commeth vp by the Pole, and not by the
Water, you shall finde that an Anchor, let downe by a Roape, maketh a 
                     Sound; And yet the Roape is no Solide Body, whereby the Sound can
ascend.
                  All Obiects of the Senses, which are very Offensiue, doe cause the Spirits
to retire; And vpon their Flight, the Parts are (in some degree) destitute;
And so there is induced in them a Trepidation and Horrour.
                     Experiment Solitary, of the Flight of the Spirits vpon Odious Obiects.
                      For
Sounds, we see that the Grating of a Saw, or any very Harsh Noise, will set
the Teeth on edge, and make all the Body Shiuer. For Tastes, we see that 
in the Taking of a Potion, or Pills, the Head, and the Necke shake. For Odious
Smells, the like Effect followeth, which is lesse perceiued, because
there is a Remedy at hand, by Stopping of the Nose: But in Horses, that
can vse no such Help, we see the Smell of a Carrion, especially of a Dead
Horse, maketh them fly away, and take on, almost as if they were Mad.
For Feeling, if you come out of the Sunne, suddenly, into a Shade, there
followeth a Chilnesse or Shiuering in all the Body. And euen in Sight,
which hath (in effect) no Odious Obiect, Comming into Sudden Darknesse,
induceth an Offer to Shiuer.
                  
                  There is, in the City of Ticinum, in Italy, a Church, that hath Windownes
onely from aboue: It is in Length an Hundred Feet, in Breadth
Twenty Feet, and in Height neare Fifty; Hauing a Doore in the Middest.Experiment Solitary, touching the Super-Reflexion of Eccho's.
                     
It reporteth the Voice, twelue or thirteene times, if you stand by the
Close End-Wall, ouer against the Doore. The Eccho fadeth, and dyeth by 
little and little, as the Eccho at Pont-charenton doth. And the Voice soundeth,
as if it came from aboue the Doore. And if you stand at the Lower
End, or on either Side of the Doore, the Eccho holdeth; But if you stand
in the Doore, or in the Middest iust ouer against the Doore, not. Note
that all Eccho's sound better against Old Walls, than New; Because they
are more Dry, and Hollow.
                  
                  
                     Those Effects, which are wrought by the Percussion of the Sense, and
by Things in Fact, are produced likewise, in some degree, by the Imagination.

Therefore if a Man see another eat Soure or Acide Things, which
set the Teeth on edge, this Obiect tainteth the Imagination. So that hee
that seeth the Thing done by another, hath his owne Teeth also set on
 edge. So if a Man see another turne swiftly, and long; Or if he looke
vpon Wheeles that turne, Himselfe waxeth Turne-sicke. So if a Man be
vpon an High Place, without Railes, or good Hold, except he be vsed to
it, he is Ready to Fall: For Imagining a Fall, it putteth his Spirits into the
very Action of a Fall. So Many vpon the Seeing of others Bleed, or Strangled,
or Tortured, Themselues are ready to faint, as if they Bled, or were
in Strife.
                  
                  Take a Stocke-Gilly-Flower, and tye it gently vpon a Sticke, and put
them both into a Stoope Glasse, full of Quick-siluer, so that the Flower be
couered: Then lay a little Weight vpon the Top of the Glasse, that may
 keepe the Sticke downe; And looke vpon them after foure or fiue daies;
And you shall finde the Flower Fresh, and the Stalke Harder, and lesse
Flexible, than it was.Experiment Solitary, touching Preseruation of Bodies.
                      If you compare it with another Flower, gathered
at the same time, it will be the more manifest. This sheweth, that Bodies
doe preserue excellently in Quick-siluer; And not preserue only, but, by
the Coldnesse of the Quick-siluer, Indurate; For the Freshnesse of the
Flower may be meerely Conseruation; (which is the more to be obserued
because the Quick-Siluer presseth the Flower;) But the Stiffenesse of
the Stalke, cannot be without Induration, from the Cold (as it seemeth,)
of the Quick-siluer.
                  
                  It is reported by some of the Ancients, that in Cyprus, there is a
Kinde of Iron, that being cut into Little Peeces, and put into the Ground,
if it be well Watred, will increase into Greater Peeces.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Growth, or Multiplying of Metalis.
                      This is certaine,
and knowne of Old; That Lead will multiply, and Increase; As hath
beene seene in Old Statua's of Stone, which haue beene put in Cellars;
                      The Feet of them being bound with Leaden Bands; Where (after a time,)
there appeared, that the Lead did swell; Insomuch as it hanged vpon
the Stone like Warts.
                  
                  I call Drowning of Metalls, when that the Baser Metall, is so incorporate
with the more Rich, as it can by no Meanes be separated againe:
which is a kinde of Version, though False: As if Siluer should be inseparably
incorporated with Gold; Or Copper, and Lead, with Siluer.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Drowning of the mne Base Metall in the more Pretious.
                      The Ancient
Electrum had in it a Fifth of Siluer to the Gold; And made a Compound
                     
                     Metall, as fit for most vses, as Gold; And more Resplendent, and
more Qualified in some other Properties; But then that was easily Separated.
This to doe priuily, or to make the Compound passe for the
Rich Metall Simple, is an Adulteration, or Counterfeiting: But if it be
done Auowedly, and without Disguizing, it may be a great Sauing of

the Richer Metall. I remember to haue heard of a Man, skilfull in Metalls,
that a Fifteenth Part of Siluer, incorporate with Gold, will not be Recouered
by any Water of Separation; Except you put a Greater Quantity
of Siluer, to draw to it the Lesse; which (he said) is the last Refuge in Separations.
But that is a tedious way, which no Man (almost) will thinke
on. This would be better enquired; And the Quantity of the Fifteenth
turned to a Twentieth; And likewise with some little Additionall, that
may further the Intrinsique Incorporation. Note that Siluer in Gold will be
detected by Weight, compared with the Dimension; But Lead in Silver,
(Lead being the Weightier Metall,) will not be detected; If you take
so much the more Siluer, as will counteruaile the Ouer-Weight of the
Lead.
                  
                  
                     Gold is the onely Substance, which hath nothing in it Volatile, and
yet melteth without much difficulty.Experiment Solitary touching Fixation of Bodies.
                      The Melting sheweth that it is not
Ieiune, or Scarce in Spirit. So that the Fixing of it, is not Want of Spirit
to fly out, but the Equall Spreading of the Tangible Parts, and the 
                     Close Coaceruation of them: Whereby they haue the lesse Appetite, and
no Meanes (at all) to issue forth. It were good therefore to try, whether
Glasse Re-moulten doe leese any Weight? For the Parts in Glasse are
euenly Spred; But they are not so Close as in Gold; As we see by the
Easie Admission of Light, Heat, and Cold; And by the Smalnesse of the
Weight. There be other Bodies, Fixed, which haue little, or no Spirit:
So as there is nothing to fly out; As wee see in the Stuffe, whereof
Coppells are made; Which they put into Furnaces; Vpon which Fire
worketh not: So that there are three Causes of Fixation; The Euen
Spreading both of the Spirits, and Tangible Parts; The Closenesse of the
Tangible Parts; And the Ieiunenesse or Extreme Comminution of Spirits:
Of which Three, the Two First may be ioyned with a Nature Liquefiable;
The Last not.
                  It is Profound Contemplation in Nature, to consider of the Emptinesse,
(as we may call it,) or Insatisfaction of seuerall Bodies; And of their
Appetite to take in Others.Experiment Solitary, touching the Restlesse Nature of Things in Themselues, and their Desire to Change.
                      
                     Aire taketh in Lights, and Sounds, and Smells,
and Vapours; And it is most manifest, that it doth it, with a kinde of
Thirst, as not satisfied with his owne former Consistence; For else it
would neuer receiue them in so suddenly, and easily. Water, and all Liquours,
doe hastily receiue Dry and more Terrestriall Bodies, Proportionable:
And Dry Bodies, on the other side, drinke in Waters, and Liquours:
So that, (as it was well said, by one of the Ancients, of Earthy and Watry
Substances,) One is a Glue to another. Parchment, Skins, Cloth, &amp;c. drinke
in Liquours, though themselues be Entire Bodies, and not Comminuted, as
Sand, and Ashes; Nor apparently Porous: Metalls themselues doe receiue
in readily Strong-Waters; And Strong-Waters likewise doe readily
pierce into Metalls, and Stones: And that Strong-Water will touch vpon
Gold, that will not touch vpon Siluer; And è conuerso. And Gold,
                     
which seemeth by the Weight, to be the Closest, and most Solide Body,
doth greedily drinke in Quick-Siluer. And it seemeth, that this Reception
of other Bodies, is not Violent: For it is (many times) Reciprocall,
and as it were with Consent. Of the Cause of this, and to what Axiome
it may be referred, consider attentiuely; For as for the Pretty Assertion,
that Matter is like a Common Strumpet, that desireth
all Formes, it is but a Wandring Notion. Onely Flame
doth not content it selfe to take in any other Body;
But either, to ouercome and turne another
Body into it Selfe, as by Victory;
Or it Selfe to dye, and

HISTORIE.
                  IX. Century.
                  IT is certaine, that all Bodies whatsoeuer,
though they haue no Sense, yet
they haue Perception: For when one
Body is applied to another, there is a
Kinde of Election, to embrace that
which is Agreeable, and to exclude
or expell that which is Ingrate: And
whether the Body be Alterant, or Altered,
euermore a Perception precedeth Operation: For else all
Bodies would be alike One to Another.Experiments in Consort, touching Perception in Bodies Insensible, tending to Natural Diuination, or Subtill Trials.
                      And sometimes this
Perception, in some Kinde of Bodies, is farre more Subtill than
the Sense; So that the Sense is but a dull Thing in Comparison
of it: Wee see a Weather-Glasse, will finde the least difference
of the Weather, in Heat, or Cold, when Men finde it not.
And this Perception also, is sometimes at Distance, as well as

vpon the Touch; As when the Load-Stone draweth Iron; or
Flame fireth Naphtha of Babylon, a great distance off. It is
therefore a Subiect of a very Noble Enquiry, to enquire of the
more Subtill Perceptions; For it is another Key to open Nature,
as well as the Sense; And sometimes Better. And besides,
it is a Principall Meanes of Naturall Diuination; For that
which in these Perceptions appeareth early, in the great Effects
commeth long after. It is true also, that it serueth to
discouer that which is Hid, as well as to foretell that which is
to Come; As it is in many Subtill Trialls; As to trie whether
Seeds be old, or new, the Sense cannot informe: But if you
boile them in Water, the New Seeds will sprout sooner: And
so of Water, the Taste will not discouer the best Water; But
the Speedy Consuming of it, and many other Meanes, which
we haue heretofore set downe, will discouer it. So in all Physiognomy,
the Lineaments of the Body will discouer those Naturall
Inclinations of the Minde, which Dissimulation will conceale,
or Discipline will suppresse. Wee shall therefore now
handle only, those two Perceptions, which pertaine to Naturall
Diuination, and Discouery: Leauing the Handling of Perception
in other Things, to be disposed Elsewhere. Now it is
true, that Diuination is attained by other Meanes; As if you
know the Causes; If you know the Concomitants; you may
iudge of the Effect to follow: And the like may be said of
Discouery; But wee tie our Selues here, to that Diuination and
Discouery chiefly, which is Caused by an Early, or Subtill
Perception.
                  
                  The Aptnesse or Propension of Aire, or Water, to Corrupt
or Putrifie, (no doubt,) is to be found before it breake forth
into manifest Effects of Diseases, Blastings, or the like. Wee
will therefore set downe some Prognosticks of Pestilentiall
and Vnwholsome Yeares.
                  
                  
                      The Wind blowing much from the South, without Raine; And
Wormes in the Oake-Apple; haue beene spoken of before. Also the Plenty
of Frogs, Grashappers, Flies, and the like Creatures bred of Putrefaction,
doth portend Pestilentiall Yeares.
                  
                  
                     
                     Great, and Early Heats in the Spring, (and namely in May,) without
Winds, portend the same; And generally so doe Yeares with little Wind,
or Thunder.
                  
                  
                     
                     Great Droughts in Summer, lasting till towards the End of August, and 
some Gentle Showres vpon them; And then some Drie Weather againe;
Doe portend a Pestilent Summer, the Yeare following: For about the
End of August, all the Sweetnesse of the Earth, which goeth into Plants,
and Trees, is exhaled; (And much more if the August be dry;) So that
nothing then can breathe forth of the Earth, but a grosse Vapour, which
is apt to Corrupt the Aire: And that Vapour, by the first Showres, if they
be Gentle, is released, and commeth forth abundantly. Therefore they
that come abroad soone after those Showres, are commonly taken with
Sicknesse: And in Affricke, no Body will stirre out of doores, after the
first Showres. But if the Showres come vehemently, then they rather
wash and fill the Earth, than giue it leaue to breathe forth presently. But
if Drie Weather come againe, then it fixeth and continueth the Corruption
of the Aire, vpon the first Showres begun; And maketh it of ill Influence,
euen to the Next Summer; Except a very Frostie Winter discharge it;
Which seldome succeedeth such Droughts.
                  
                  The Lesser Infections, of the Small Pockes, Purple Feuers, Agues, in 
the Summer Precedent, and houering all Winter, doe portend a great
Pestilence in the Summer following; For Putrefaction doth not rise to his
height at once.
                  It were good to lay a Peece of Raw Flesh, or Fish, in the Open Aire;
                     
And if it Putrefie quickly, it is a Signe of a Disposition in the Aire to Putrefaction.
And because you cannot be informed, whether the Putrefaction
be quicke or late, except you compare this Experiment with the like Experiment
in another Yeare, it were not amisse, in the same Yeare, and at
the same Time, to lay one Peece of Flesh, or Fish, in the Open Aire, and
another of the same Kinde and Bignesse, within Doores: For I iudge,
that if a generall Disposition be in the Aire to Putrefie, the Flesh, or Fish,
will sooner Putrefie abroad, where the Aire hath more power, than in
the House, where it hath lesse, being many wayes corrected. And this
Experiment would be made about the End of March: For that Season is
likest to discouer, what the Winter hath done; And what the Summer
following will doe vpon the Aire. And because the Aire (no doubt)
receiueth great Tincture, and Infusion from the Earth; It were good to
trie that Exposing of Flesh, or Fish, both vpon a Stake of Wood, some
heighth aboue the Earth, and vpon the Flat of the Earth.
                  
                  Take May-Dew, and see whether it putrifie quickly, or no? For that 
likewise may disclose the Qualitie of the Aire, and Vapour of the Earth,
more or lesse Corrupted.
                  
                  A Drie March, and a Drie May, portend a Wholesome Summer, if there 
be a Showring Aprill betweene: But otherwise, it is a Signe of a Pestilentiall
Yeare.
                  
                  As the Discouerie of the Disposition of the Aire, is good for the Prognosticks
                     
of Wholesome, and Vnwholesome Yeares; So it is of much more
vse, for the Choice of Places to dwell in: At the least, for Lodges, and Retiring
Places for Health; (For Mansion Houses respect Prouisions, as well

as Health; Wherein the Experiments aboue mentioned may serue.
                  
                      But for the Choice of Places, or Seats, it is good to make Triall, not
only of Aptnesse of Aire to corrupt, but also of the Moisture and Drinesse
of the Aire; and the Temper of it, in Heat, or Cold; For that may concerne
Health diuersly. Wee see that there be some Houses, wherein Sweet
Meats will relent, and Baked Meats will mould, more than in others; And
Wainscoats will also sweat more; so that they will almost run with Water:
All which, (no doubt,) are caused chiefly by the Moistnesse of the Aire,
in those Seats. But because it is better to know it, before a Man buildeth
his House, than to finde it after, take the Experiments following.
                  
                      Lay Wooll, or a Sponge, or Bread, in the Place you would trie, comparing
it with some other Places; And see whether it doth not moisten,
and make the Wooll, or Sponge, &amp;c. more Ponderous, than the other?
And if it doe, you may iudge of that Place, as Situate in a Grosse, and
Moist Aire.
                  
                  
                      Because it is certaine, that in some Places, either by the Nature of the
Earth, or by the Situation of Woods, and Hills, the Aire is more Vnequall,
than in Others; and Inequalitie of Aire is euer an Enemy to Health;
It were good to take two Weather-Glasses, Matches in all things, and to
set them, for the same Houres of One day, in seuerall Places, where no
Shade is, nor Enclosures: And to marke, when you set them, how farre
the Water commeth; And to compare them, when you come againe,
how the Water standeth then: And if you finde them Vnequall, you may
be sure that the Place where the Water is lowest, is in the Warmer Aire,
and the other in the Colder. And the greater the Inequalitie be, of the
Ascent, or Descent of the Water, the greater is the Inequalitie of the Temper
of the Aire.
                  
                  
                      The Predictions likewise of Cold and Long Winters, and Hot and Drie
Summers, are good to be knowne; As well for the Discouerie of the Causes,
as for diuers Prouisions. That of Plenty of Hawes, and Heps, and
Briar-Berries, hath beene spoken of before. If Wainscast, or Stone, that
haue vsed to Sweat, be more drie, in the Beginning of Winter; Or the
Drops of the Eaues of Houses come more slowly downe, than they vse; it
portendeth a Hard and Frostie Winter. The Cause is, for that it sheweth
an Inclination of the Aire, to Drie Weather; which in Winter is euer ioyned
with Frost.
                  
                  
                      Generally, a Moist and Coole Summer, portendeth a Hard Winter. The
Cause is, for that the Vapours of the Earth, are not dissipated in the Summer,
by the Sunne; And so they rebound vpon the Winter.
                  
                  
                      A Hot and Drie Summer, and Autumne, and especially if the Heat and
Drought extend farre into September, portendeth an Open Beginning of
Winter; And Colds to succeed, toward the latter Part of the Winter, and
the Beginning of the Spring: For till then, the former Heat and Drought
beare the Sway; And the Vapours are not sufficiently Multiplied.
                  
                      An Open and Warme Winter portendeth a Hot and Drie Summer: For
the Vapours disperse into the Winter Showres; Whereas Cold and Frost
                     
keepeth them in, and transporteth them into the late Spring, and Summer
following.
                  
                     Birds that vse to change Countries, at certaine Seasons, if they come 
Earlier, doe shew the Temperature of Weather, according to that Country
whence they came: As the Winter-Birds, (namely Woodcocks, Feldefares,
&amp;c.) if they come earlier, and out of the Northerne Countries, with vs
shew Cold Winters. And if it be in the same Country, then they shew a
Temperature of Season, like vnto that Season in which they come: As
swallowes, Bats, Cuckooes, &amp;c. that come towards Summer, if they come
early, shew a Hot Summer to follow.
                  The Prognosticks, more Immediate, of Weather to follow soone after,
are more Certaine than those of Seasons. The Resounding of the Sea vpon
the Shoare; And the Murmur of Winds in the Woods, without apparent
Wind; shew Wind to follow: For such Winds, breathing chiefly out of
the Earth, are not at the first perceiued, except they be pent, by Water,
or Wood. And therefore a Murmur out of Caues likewise portendeth as
much.
                  The Vpper Regions of the Aire, perceiue the Collection of the Matter 
of Tempest, and Winds, before the Aire here below: And therefore the
Obscuring of the Smaller Starres is is a Signe of Tempests following. And
of this kinde you shall finde a Number of Instances in our Inquisition De
Ventis.
                  
                  
                     Great Mountaines haue a Perception of the Disposition of the Aire to 
                     Tempests, sooner than the Valley's or Plaines below: And therefore they
say in Wales, when certaine Hills haue their Night-Cups on, they meane
Mischiefe. The Cause is, for that Tempests, which are for the most part
bred aboue, in the Middle Region, (as they call it,) are soonest perceiued
to collect in the Places next it.
                  The Aire, and Fire, haue Subtill Perceptions of Wind Rising, before 
                     Men finde it. Wee see the Trembling of a Candle will discouer a Wind that
otherwise wee doe not feele; And the Flexuous Burning of Flames doth
shew the Aire beginneth to be vnquiet; And so doe Coales of Fire by
Casting off the Ashes more than they vse. The Cause, is, for that no Wind,
at the first, till it hath strooke and driven the Aire, is Apparent to the
Sense: But Flame is easier to moue, than Aire: And for the Ashes, it is
no maruell, though Wind vnperceiued shake them off; For wee vsually
trie, which way the Wind bloweth, by casting vp Grasse, or Chaffe, or
such light Things, into the Aire.
                  
                  When Wind expireth from vnder the Sea; As it causeth some Resounding
                     
of the Water, (whereof wee spake before,) so it causeth some Light
Motions of Bubbles, and White Circles of Froth. The Cause is, for that the
Wind cannot be perceiued by the Sense, vntill there be an Eruption of a
great Quantitie, from vnder the Water; And so it getteth into a Body:
Whereas in the first Putting vp it commeth in little Portions.
                  We spake of the Ashes, that Coales cast off; And of Grasse, and Chaffe
                     
carried by the Wind; So any Light Thing that moueth, when we finde no

                     Wind, sheweth a Wind at hand: As when Feathers, or Downe of Thistles,
fly to and fro in the Aire.
                  
                  For Prognosticks of Weather from Liuing Creatures, it is to
be noted; That Creatures that Liue in the Open Aire, (Sub Diô,)
must needs haue a Quicker Impression from the Aire, than Men
that liue most within Doores; And especially Birds, who liue
in the Aire, freest, and clearest; And are aptest by their Voice
to tell Tales, what they finde; And likewise by the Motion of
their Flight to expresse the same.
                  
                     
                     Water-Fowles, (as Sea-Gulls, More-Hens, &amp;c.) when they flocke and
fly together, from the Sea towards the Shores; And contrariwise, LandBirds,
(as Crowes, Swallowes, &amp;c.) when they fly from the Land to the
Waters, and beat the Waters with their Wings; doe fore-shew Raine, and
Wind. The Cause is, Pleasure, that both Kindes take in the Moistnesse, and
Density of the Aire: And so desire to be in Motion, and vpon the Wing,
whither soeuer they would otherwise goe: For it is no Maruell, that Water-Fowle
doe ioy most in that Aire, which is likest Water; And LandBirds
also, (many of them,) delight in Bathing, and Moist Aire. For the
same Reason also, many Birds doe proine their Feathers; And Geese doe
gaggle; And Crowes seeme to call vpon Raine: All which is but the
Comfort they seeme to receiue in the Relenting of the Aire.
                  
                  
                      The Heron, when she foareth high, (so as sometimes she is seene to
passe ouer a Cloud,) sheweth Winds: But Kites flying aloft, shew Faire
and Dry Weather. The Cause may be, for that they both mount most into
the Aire, of that Temper, wherein they delight: And the Heron, being
a Water-Fowle, taketh pleasure in the Aire, that is Condensed: And
besides, being but Heauy of Wing, needeth the Helpe of the Grosser
Aire. But the Kite affecteth not so much the Grossenesse of the Aire, as
the Cold and Freshnesse thereof; For being a Bird of Prey, and therefore
Hot, she delighteth in the Fresh Aire; And (many times) flyeth against
the Wind; As Trouts, and Salmons swimme against the Streame. And
yet it is true also, that all Birds finde an Ease in the depth of the Aire;
As Swimmers doe in a Deepe Water. And therefore when they are aloft,
they can vphold themselues with their Wings Spred, scarce mouing
them.
                  
                     
                     Fishes, when they play towards the Top of the Water, doe commonly
foretell Raine. The Cause is, for that a Fish hating the Dry, will not
approach the Aire, till it groweth Moist; And when it is Dry, will fly it,
and Swimme Lower.
                  
                     
                     Beasts doe take Comfort, (generally,) in a Moist Aire; And it maketh
them eat their Meat better: And therefore Sheepe will get vp betimes
in the Morning, to feed, against Raine: And Cattell, and Deere,
and Conneyes, will feed hard before Raine: And a Heifer, will put vp his
Nose, and snuffe in the Aire, against Raine.
                  
                  
                     The Trifoile, against Raine, swelleth in the Stalke; and so standeth 
more vpright; For by Wet, Stalkes doe erect, and Leaues bow downe.
I here is a Small Red Flower in the Stubble-Fields, which Country People
call the Wincopipe; Which if it open in the Morning, you may be sure
of a faire Day to follow.
                  Euen in Men, Aches, and Hurts, and Cornes, doe engrieue, either towards 
                     Raine, or towards Frost: For the One maketh the Humours more
to Abound; And the Other maketh them Sharper. So we see both Extremes
bring the Gout.
                  
                  
                     Wormes, Vermine, &amp;c. doe fore-shew (likewise) Raine: For Earthwormes
                     
will come forth, and Moules will cast vp more, and Fleas bite
more, against Raine.
                  
                  
                     Solide Bodies likewise fore-shew Raine. As Stones, and Wainscot, when 
they sweat: And Boxes, and Peggs of Wood, when they Draw, and Wind
hard; Though the Former be but from an Outward Cause; For that the
Stone, or Wainscot, turneth and beateth backe the Aire against it selfe;
But the latter is an Inward Swelling of the Body of the Wood it selfe.
                  
                     Apetite is moued chiefly by Things that are Cold, and Dry: The
Cause, is for that Cold is a Kinde of Indigence of Nature, and calleth vpon
Supply; And so is Drinesse: And therefore all Soure Things, (as Vinegar,
Iuyce of Limons, Oyle of Vitrioll, &amp;c.) prouoke Appetite.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Nature of Appetite in the Stomach.
                      And the Disease,
which they call Appetitus Caninus, consisteth in the Matter of an Acide
                     
and Glassy Flegme, in the Mouth of the Stomach. Appetite is also moued
by Soure Things; For that Soure Things, induce a Contraction in the Nerues,
placed in the Mouth of the Stomach; Which is a great Cause of Appetite.
As for the Cause, why Onions, and Salt, and Pepper, in Baked Meats, moue
Appetite, it is by Vellication of those Nerues; For Motion whetteth. As for
Worme-Wood, Oliues, Capers, and others of that kinde, which participate
of Bitternesse, they moue Appetite by Abstersion. So as there be foure
Principall Causes of Appetite; The Refrigeration of the Stomach, ioyned
with some Drinesse; Contraction; Vellication; And Abstersion: Besides
Hunger, which is an Emptinesse: And yet Ouer Fasting doth (many times)
cause the Appetite to cease; For that Want of Meat maketh the Stomach
draw Humours; And such Humours as are Light, and Cholericke, which
quench Appetite most.
                  It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that where a Raine-Bow seemeth
no hang ouer, or to touch, there breatheth forth a Sweet Smell.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Sweetnesse of Odour from the Rainbow.
                      The
Cause is, for that this happeneth but in certaine Matters, which haue in
themselues some Sweetnesse; Which the Gentle Dew of the Raine-Bow
doth draw forth. And the like doe Safe Showers; For they also make 
the Ground Sweet: But none are so delicate as the Dew of the Rain-bow,
where it falleth. It may be also, that the Water it selfe bath some Sweetnesse:
For the Raine-Bow consisteth of a Glo
                           ••
                        eration of Small Drops,
which cannot possibly fall, but from the Aire, that is very Low: And

therefore may hold the very Sweetnesse of the Herbs, and Flowers, as a
Distilled Water: For Raine, and other Dew, that fall from high, cannot
preserue the Smell, being dissipated in the drawing vp: Neither doe we
know, whether some Water it selfe, may not haue some degree of Sweetnesse. It is true, that wee finde it sensibly in no Poole, Riuer, nor Fountaine;
But good Earth, newly turned vp, hath a Freshnesse, and good
Sent; Which water, if it be not too Equall, (For Equall Obiects neuer
moue the Sense.) may also haue. Certaine it is, that Bay-Salt, which is
but a kinde of Water Congealed, will sometimes smell like Violets.
                  
                  To Sweet Smells Heat is requisite, to Concoct the Matter; And
some Moisture to Spread the Breath of them. For Heat, we see that Woods,
and Spices, are more Odorate in the Hot Countries, than in the Cold: For

                     Moisture, we see that Things too much Dried, lose their Sweetnesse: And
Flowers growing, smell better in a Morning, or Euening, than at Noone.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Sweet Smells.
                     
Some Sweet Smells are destroyed by Approach to the Fire; As Violets,
Wall-Flowers, Gilly-Flowers, Pinckes; And generally all Flowers that
haue Coole and Delicate Spirits. Some continue both on the Fire, and
from the Fire, As Rose-Water, &amp;c. Some doe scarce come forth, or at
least not so pleasantly, as by meanes of the Fire; as Iuniper, Sweet Gums,
&amp;c. And all Smells, that are Enclosed in a Fast Body: But (generally)
those Smells are the most Gratefull, where the Degree of Heat is Small;
Or where the Strength of the Smell is allayed; For these Things doe rather
wooe the Sense, than Satiate it. And therefore the Smell of Violets,
and Roses, exceedeth in Sweetnesse that of Spices, and Gummes; And the
Strongest Sort of Smells, are best in a weft, a farre off.
                  It is certaine, that no Smell issueth, but with Emission of some Corporeall
Substance; Not as it is in Light, and Colours, and in Sounds.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Corportall Substance of Smells.
                      For wee
see plainly, that Smell doth spread nothing that distance, that the other
doe. It is true, that some Woods of Orenges, and Heathes of Rose-Mary, will
 Smell a great way into the Sea, perhaps twenty Miles; But what is that,
since a Peale of Ordnance will do as much, which moueth in a small compasse?
Whereas those Woods, and Heathes, are of Vast Spaces: Besides
we see that Smells doe adhere to Hard Bodies; As in Persuming of Gloues,
&amp;c. which sheweth them Corporeall; And doe Last a great while, which
Sounds, and Light doe not.
                  The Excrements of most Creatures Smell ill; Chiefly to the same
Creature that voideth them: For we see, besides that of Man, that Pigeons,
and Horses thriue best, if their Houses, and Stables be kept Sweet;
And so of Cage-Birds: And the Cat burieth that which shee voideth:
 And it holdeth chiefly in those Beasts, which feed vpon Flesh.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Fetide and Fragrant Odours.
                      
                     Dogs (almost)
onely of Beasts, delight in Fetide Odours; Which sheweth there
is somewhat in their Sense of Smell, differing from the Smells of other
Beasts. But the Cause, why Excrements smell ill, is manifest; For that the

                     Body it selfe reiecteth them; Much more the Spirits: And we see, that
those Excrements, that are of the First Digestion; Smell the worst; As the
Excrements from the Belly: Those that are from the Second Digestion, lesse
ill; As Vrine; And those that are from the Third, yet lesse; For Sweat
is not so bad, as the other two; Especially of some Persons, that are full
of Heat. Likewise most Putrefactions are of an Odious Smell: For they
smell either Fetide, or Mouldy. The Cause may be, for that Putrefaction
doth bring forth such a Consistence, as is most Contrary to the Consistence
of the Body, whilst it is Sound: For it is a meere dissolution of that Forme.
Besides, there is another Reason which is Profound: And it is, that the
Obiects that please any of the Senses, haue (all) some Equality, and (as it
were) Order, in their Composition: But where those are wanting, the Obiect
is euer Ingrate. So Mixture of many Disagreeing Colours is euer vnpleasant
to the Eye: Mixture of Discordant Sounds is vnpleasant to the
Eare: Mixture, or Hotch-Potch of many Tastes, is vnpleasant to the Taste:
Harshnesse and Ruggednesse of Bodies, is vnpleasant to the Touch: Now it
is certaine, that all Putrefaction, being a Dissolution of the first Forme, is a
meere Confusion, and Vnformed Mixture of the Part. Neuerthelesse, it is
strange, and seemeth to Crosse the former Obseruation, that some Putrefactions and Excrements doe yeeld Excellent Odours; As Ciuet, and
Muske; And as some thinke Amber-Greece: For diuers take it, (though
vnprobably,) to come from the Sperme of Fish: And the Mosse, wee spake
of from Apple-Trees, is little better than an Excretion. The Reason may
be, for that there passeth in the Excrements, and remaineth in the Putrefactions, some good Spirits; especially where they proceed from Creatures,
that are very Hot. But it may be also ioyned with a further Cause,
which is more Subtill; And it is, that the Senses loue not to be Ouerpleased;
But to haue a C
                           ••••••
                        
                      of somewhat is in it selfe Ingrate.
Certainly, we see how Discords in Musicke, falling vpon Concords,
make the Sweetest Straines: And we see againe, what Strange Tastes delight
the Taste; As Red-Herrings, Caueary, Parmizan, &amp;c. And it may be,
the same holdeth in Smells. For those kinde of Smells, that we haue mentioned,
are all Strong, and doe Pull and Vellicate the Sense. And wee
finde also, that Places where Men Vrine, commonly haue some smell of
Violets: And Vrine, if one hath eaten Nutmegge, hath so too.
                  The Sloathfull, Generall, and Indefinite Contemplations,
and Notions, of the Elements, and their Coniugations; Of the
Influences of Heauen; Of Heat, Cold, Moisture, Drought; Qualities,
Active, Passive; And the like; haue swallowed vp the true
Passages, and Processes, and Affects, and Consistences of Matter,
and Naturall Bodies. Therefore they are to be set aside, being

but Notionall, and ill Limited; And Definite Axiomes are to
be drawne out of Measured Instances: And so Assent to be
made to the more Generall Axiomes, by Scale. And of these
Kindes of Processes of Natures, and Characters of Matter, we
will now set downe some Instances.
                  
                  All Putrefactions come chiefly from the Inward Spirits of the Body;
And partly also from the Ambient Body, be it Aire, Liquour, or whatsoeuer
else.Experiment Solitary, touching the Causes of Putrefaction.
                      And this last, by two Meanes: Either by Ingresse of the Substance
                      of the Ambient Body, into the Body Putrified; Or by Excitation and Sollicitation
of the Body Putrified, and the Parts thereof, by the Body Ambient.
As for the Receiued Opinion, that Putrefaction is caused, either by Cold,
or Peregrine and Preternaturall Heat, it is but Nugation: For Cold in
Things Inanimate, is the greatest Enemy that is, to Putrefaction; though
it extinguisheth Viuification, which euer consisteth in Spirits Attenuate.
which the Cold doth congeale, and coagulate. And as for the Peregrins
Heat, it is thus farre true; That if the Proportion of the Aduentiue Heat,
be greatly Predominant, to the Naturall Heat, and Spirits of the Body, it
tendeth to Dissolution, or Notable Alteration. But this is wrought by Emission,
or Suppression, or Suffocation, of the Natiue Spirits; And also by
the Disordination, and Discomposture of the Tangible Parts; And other
Passages of Nature; And not by a Conflict of Heats.
                  
                  In Versions, or Maine Alterations of Bodies, there is a Medium between
the Body, as it is at first, and the Body Resulting; which Medium is Corpus
imperfectè Mistum, and is Transitory, and not durable; As Mists, Smoaks,
Vapours, Chylus in the Stomach, Liuing Creatures in the first Vinification: And
 the Middle Action, which produceth such Imperfect Bodies, is fitly called,
(by some of the Ancients,) Inquination, or Inconcoction, which is a Kinde
of Putrefaction; For the Parts are in Confusion, till they settle, one way,
or other.Experiment Solitary, touching Bodies Vnperfectly Mixt.
                  
                  The word Concoction, or Digestion, is chiefly taken into vse from Liuing
Creatures, and their Organs; And from thence extended to Liquours,
and Fruits, &amp;c. Therefore they speake of Meat Concocted; Vrine and Excrements
 Concocted; And the Foure Disgestions, (In the Stomach; In the
Liuer; In the Arteries and Nerues; And in the Seuerall Parts of the Body;)
are likewise called Concoctions: And they are all made to be the
Workes of Heat: All which Notions are but ignorant Catches of a few
Things, which are most Obuious to Mens Obseruations. The Constantest
Notion of Concoction is, that it should signifie the Degrees of Alteration,
of one Body into another, from Crudity to Perfect Concoction; Which
is the Vltimity of that Action, or Processe: And while the Body to be Conuerted
and Altered, is too strong for the Efficient, that should Conuert, or
Alter it, (whereby it resisteth and holdeth fast in some degree the first

                     Forme, or Consistence;) it is (all that while,) Crude, and Inconcoct; And
the Processe is to be called Crudity and Inconcoction. It is true, that Concoction
is, in great part, the Worke of Heat; But not the Worke of Heat alone:
For all Things, that further the Conuersion, or Alteration, (as Rest,
Mixture of a Body already Concocted, &amp;c.) are also Meanes to Concoction.
And there are of Concoction two Periods; The one Assimilation, or Absolute
Conuersion and Subaction; The other Maturation: whereof the Former
is most conspicuous in the Bodies of Liuing Creatures; In which
there is an Absolute Conuersion, and Assimilation of the Nourishment into
the Body: And likewise in the Bodies of Plants: And againe in Metalls,
where there is a full Transmutation. The other, (which is Maturation,) is
seene in Liquours, and Fruits; wherein there is not desired, nor pretended,
an vtter Conuersion, but onely an Alteration to that Forme, which is
most sought, for Mans vse; As in Clarifying of Drinkes; Ripening of
Fruits, &amp;c. But note, that there be two Kindes of Absolute Conuersions;
The one is, when a Body is conuerted into another Body, which was before;
As when Nourishment is turned into Flesh; That is it which wee
call Assimilation. The other is, when the Conuersion is into a Body meerely
New, and which was not before; As if Siluer should be turned to
Gold; or Iron to Copper: And this Conuersion is better called, for distinctions
sake, Transmutation.
                  
                  There are also diuers other Great Alterations of Matter, and Bodies, besides
those that tend to Concoction, and Maturation; For whatsoeuer doth
so alter a Body, as it returneth not againe to that it was, may be called
Alteratio Maior: As when Meat is Boyled, or Roasted, or Fried, &amp;c.Experiment Solitary, touching Alterations, which may be called Maiors. Or
when Bread and Meat are Baked; Or when Cheese is made of Curds, or
Butter of Creame, or Goales of wood, or Brickes of Earth; And a Number 
of others. But to apply Notions Philosophicall to Plebcian Termes;
Or to say, where the Notions cannot fitly be reconciled, that there wanteth
a Terme, or Nomenclature for it; (as the Ancients vsed;) They be
but Shifts of Ignorance; For Knowledge will be euer a Wandring and Indigested
Thing, if it be but a Commixture of a few Notions, that are at hand
and occurre, and not excited from sufficient Number of Instances, and
those well collated.
                  The Consistences of Bodies are very diuers: Dense, Rare; Tangible,
Pneumaticall, Volatile, Fixed; Determinate, Not Determinate,
Hard, Soft; Cleauing, Not Cleauing; Congealeable, Not Congealeable;
Liquefiable, Not Liquefiable; Fragile, Tough; Flexible
Inflexible; Tractile, or to be drawen forth in length, Intractile;
Porous, Solide; Equall, and Smooth, Vnequall, Venous, and Fibrous,
                     
and with Graines, Entire; And diuers Others; All
which to referre to Heat, and Cold; and Moisture, and Drought,
is a Compendious and Inutile Speculation. But of these see principally
our Abecedarium Nature; And otherwise Sparfim in
this in our Sylua Syluarum: Neuerthelesse in some good part,
We shall handle diuers of them now presently.
                  
                     Liquefiable, and Not Liquefiable, proceed from these Causes: Liquefaction
is euer caused by the Detention of the Spirits, which play within
the Body, and Open it.Experiment Solitary touching Bodies Liquefiable, and not Liquefiable.
                      Therefore such Bodies, as are more Turgide of
Spirit; Or that haue their Spirits more Sraitly Imprisoned; Or againe
 that hold them Better Pleased and Content; are Liquefiable: For these
three Dispositions of Bodies, doe arrest the Emission of the Spirits. An Example
of the first two Properties is in Metalls; And of the Last in Grease,
Pitch, Sulphure, Butter, Wax, &amp;c. The Disposition not to Liquefie proceedeth
from the Easie Emission of the Spirits; whereby the Grosser Parts
contract; And therefore, Bodies Ieiune of Spirits; Or which part with
their Spirits more Willingly; are not Liquefiable; As Wood, Clay, Freestone,
&amp;c. But yet, euen many of those Bodies, that will not Melt, or will
hardly Melt, will notwithstanding Soften; As Iron in the Forge; And a
Sticke bathed in Hot Ashes, which thereby becommeth more Flexible.
Moreouer, there are some Bodies, which doe Liquefie, or dissolue by Fire;
As Metalls, Wax, &amp;c. And other Bodies, which dissolue in Water; As Salt,
Sugar, &amp;c. The Cause of the former proceedeth from the Dilatation of
the Spirits by Heat: The Cause of the Latter proceedeth from the Opening
of the Tangible Parts, which desire to receiue the Liquour. Againe,
there are some Bodies, that dissolue with both; As Gumme, &amp;c. And
those be such Bodies, as on the One Side haue good store of Spirit; And
on the other Side, haue the Tangible Parts Indigent of Moisture; For the
former helpeth to the Dilating of the Spirits by the Fire; And the Latter
stimulateth the Parts to Receiue the Liquour.
                  
                  Of Bodies, some are Fragile; And some are Tough, and Not Fragile;
And in the Breaking, some Fragile Bodies breake but where the Force is;
Some shatter and fly in many Peeces.Experiment Solitary touching Bodies Fragile, and Tough.
                      Of Fragility the Cause is an Impotency
to be Extended: And therefore Stone is more Fragile than Metall;
                      And so Fictile Earth is more Fragile than Crude Earth; And Dry Wood
than Greene. And the Cause of this Vnaptnesse to Extension, is the Small
Quantity of Spirits; (For it is the Spirit that furthereth the Extension or
Dilatation of Bodies;) And it is euer Concomitant with Porosity, and
with Drinesse in the Tangible Parts: Contrariwise, Tough Bodies haue more
Spirit, and sewer Pores, and Moister Tangible Parts: Therefore wee see
that Parchment, or Leather will stretch, Paper will not; Woollen Cloth will
tenter, Linnen scarcely.
                  
                     All Solide Bodies consist of Parts of two seuerall Natures; Pneumaticall,
and Tangible; And it is well to be noted, that the Pneumaticall Substance
is in some Bodies, the Nature Spirit of the Body; And in some
other, plaine Aire that is gotten in; As in Bodies desiccate, by Heat, or
Age: For in them, when the Natiue Spirit goeth forth, and the Moisture
with it, the Aire with time getteth into the Pores.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Two Kindes of Pneumaticals in Bodies
                      And those Bodies are 
euer the more Fragile; For the Natiue Spirit is more Yeelding, and Extensiue,
(especially to follow the Parts,) than Aire. The Natiue Spirits also
admit great Diuersitie; As Hot, Cold, Active, Dull, &amp;c. Whence proceed
most of the Vertues, and Qualities (as wee call them) of Bodies: But
the Aire intermixt, is without Vertues, and maketh Things Infioide, and
without any Extimulation.
                  
                  The Concretion of Bodies is (commonly) solued by the Contrary; As
Ice, which is congealed by Gold, is dissolued by Heat; Salt and Sugar,
which are Excocted by Heat, are Dissolued by Cold, and Moisture.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Concretion, and Dissolution of Bodies.
                      The
Cause is, for that these Operations, are rather Returnes to their former
Nature, than Alterations: So that the Contrary cureth. As for Oyle, it 
doth neither easily congeale with Cold, nor thicken with Heat. The
Cause of both Effects, though they be produced by Contrary Efficients,
seemeth to be the Same; And that is, because the Spirit of the Oyle, by
either Meanes, exhaleth little; For the Cold keepeth it in; and the Heat,
(except it be Vehement,) doth not call it forth. As for Cold, though it
take hold of the Tangible Parts, yet as to the Spirits, it doth rather make
them Swell, than Congeale them: As when Ice is congealed in a Cup,
the Ice will Swell in stead of Contracting; And sometimes Rift.
                  Of Bodies, some (wee see) are Hard, and some Soft: The Hardnesse
is caused (chiefly) by the Ieiunenesse of the Spirits; And their Imparitie
with the Tangible Parts: Both which, if they be in a greater degree, maketh
them, not only Hard, but Fragile, and lesse Enduring of Pressure;
                     
As Steele, Stone, Glasse, Drie Wood, &amp;c.Experiment Solitary, touching Hard and Soft Bodies.
                      
                     Softnesse commeth (contrariwise)
by the Greater Quantitie of Spirits; (which euer helpeth to Induce
Yeelding and Cession;) And by the more Equall Spreading of the Tangible
Parts, which thereby are more Sliding, and Following; As in Gold, Lead,
Wax, &amp;c. But note, that Soft Bodies, (as wee vse the word,) are of two
Kinds; The one, that easily glueth place to another Body, but altereth
not Bulke, by Rising in other Places: And therefore wee see that Wax, if
you put any Thing into it, doth not rise in Bulke, but only giueth Place:
For you may not thinke, that in Printing of Wax, the Wax riseth vp at
all; But only the depressed Part giueth place, and the other remaineth as
it was. The other, that altereth Bulke in the Cession; As Water, or other
Liquours, if you put a Stone, or any Thing into them, they giue place
(indeed) easily, but then they rise all ouer: Which is a False Cession; For
it is in Place, and not in Body.
                  
                  
                     All Bodies Ductile, and Tensile, (as Metals that will be drawne into
Wires; Wooll and Towe that will be drawne into Yarne, or Thred;) haue
in them the Appetite of Not Discontinuing, Strong; Which maketh them
follow the Force, that pulleth them out; And yet so, as not to Discontinue
                      or forsake their owne Body.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Bodies Ductile, and Tensile.
                      
                     Viscous Bodies, (likewise,) as Pitch,
Wax, Bird-Lime, Cheese toasted, will draw forth, and roape. But the
difference betweene Bodies Fibrous, and Bodies Viscous, is Plaine; For all
Wooll, and Towe, and Cotton, and Silke, (especially raw Silke,) haue, besides
their Desire of Continuance, in regard of the Tenuitie of their Thred, a
Greedinesse of Moisture; And by Moisture to ioyne and incorporate with
other Thred; Especially if there be a little Wreathing; As appeareth by
the Twisting of Thred; And the Practise of Twirling about of Spindles.
And wee see also, that Gold and Siluer Thred cannot be made without
Twisting.
                  
                  The Differences of Impressible; and Not Impressible Figurable; and Not
Figurable; Mouldable and Not Mouldable; Scissile and Not Scissile; And
many other Passions of Matter, are Plebcian Notions, applied vnto the Instruments
and Vses which Men ordinarily practise; But they are all but
the Effects of some of these Causes following; Which we will Enumerate
 without Applying them, because that would be too long.Experiment Solitary, touching other Passions of Matter, and Characters of Bodies.,
                      The First is
the Cession, or Not Cession of Bodies, into a Smaller Space or Roome, keeping
the Outward Bulke, and not flying vp. The Second is the Stronger
or Weaker Appetite, in Bodies, to Continuitie, and to flie Discontinuitie.
The Third is the Disposition of Bodies, to Contract, or Not Contract;
And againe, to Extend, or Not Extend. The Fourth is the Small Quantitie,
or Great Quantitie, of the Pneumaticall in Bodies. The Fifth is the
Nature of the Pneumalicall, whether is 
                           ••
                         Natiue Spirit of the Body, or
Common Aire. The Sixth is, the Nature of the Natiue Spirits in the Body,
whether they be Actiue and Eager, or Dull and Gentle. The Seuenth is
the Emission or Detention of the Spirits in Bodies. The Eighth is the Dilatation,
or Contraction of the Spirits in Bodies, while they are detained.
The Ninth is the Collocation of the Spirits in Bodies; whether the Collocation
be Equall, or Vnequall; And againe, whether the Spirits be Coaceruate,
or Diffused. The Tenth is the Densitie, or Raritie of the Tangible
Parts. The Eleuenth is the Equalitie or Inequalitie of the Tangible Parts.
The Twelfth is the Disgestion, or Cruditie of the Tangible Parts. The
Thirteenth is the Nature of the Matter, whether Sulphureous or Mercuriall,
Watrie or Oylie, Drie and Terrestriall, or Moìst and Liquid; which
Natures of Sulphureous and Mercuriall, seeme to be Natures Radicall, and
Principiall. The Fourteenth is the Placing of the Tangible Parts, in Length,
or Transuerse; (As it is in the Warpe, and the Woofe, of Textiles;) More
Inward, or More Outward; &amp;c. The Fifteenth is the Porofitie, or Imporositie
betwixt the Tangible Parts; And the Greatnesse, or Smalnesse of the
Pores. The Sixteenth is the Collocation and Pesture of the Pores. There
may be more Causes; but these doe occurre for the Present.
                  
                     Take Lead, and melt it, and in the Middest of it, when it beginneth
to Congeale, make a little Dint, or Hole, and put Quicke-Siluer wrapped
in a Peece of Linnen into that Hole, and the Quicke-Siluer will fix,
and run no more, and endure the Hammer.Experiment Solitary, touching Induration by Sympathic.
                      This is a Noble Instance of
Induration, by Consent of one Body with another, and Motion of Excitation
                     
to Imitate; For to ascribe it only to the Vapour of Lead, is lesse Probable.
Quare whether the Fixing may be in such a degree, as it will be
Figured like other Metals? For if so, you may make Works of it for
some purposes, so they come not neere the Fire.
                  
                  
                     Sugar hath put downe the vse of Honey; Insomuch as wee haue lost
those Obseruations, and Preparations of Honey, which the Ancients had,
when it was more in Price.Experiment Solitary touching Honey and Sugar.
                      First, it seemeth that there was, in old time,
Tree-Honey, as well as Bee-Honey; Which was the Teare or Bloud issuing 
from the Tree: Insomuch as one of the Ancients relateth, that in Trebisond,
there was Honey issuing from the Box-Trees, which made Men Mad.
Againe, in Ancient time, there was a Kinde of Honey, which either of
the owne Nature, or by Art, would grow as Hard as Sugar; And was
not so Lushious as Ours. They had also a Wine of Honey, which they
made thus. They crushed the Honey into a great Quantitie of Water, and
then strained the Liquour; After they boyled it in a Copper to the halfe:
Then they powred it into Earthen Vessels, for a small time; And after
tunned it into Vessels of Wood, and kept it for many years. They haue
also, at this day, in Russia, and those Northerne Countries, Mead Simple,
which (well made, and seasoned) is a good wholesome Drinke, and very
Cleare. They vse also in Wales, a Compound Drinke of Mead, with
Herbs, and Spices. But meane-while it were good, in recompence of
that wee haue lost in Honey, there were brought in vse a Sugar Mead
                           •
                        
                      (for
so wee may call it,) though without any Mixture at all of Honey; And
to brew it, and keepe it stale, as they vse Mead; For certainly, though
it would not be so Abster siue, and Opening, and Solutiue a Drinke as
Mead; yet it will be more gratefull to the Stomach, and more Lenitiue,
and fit to be vsed in Sharpe Diseases. For wee see, that the vse of Sugar in
Beere, and Ale, hath good Effects in such Cases.
                  It is reported by the Ancients, that there was a Kinde of Steele, in
some places, which would polish almost as white and bright as Siluer.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Finer Sort of Base Metals.
                     
And that there was in India a Kinde of Brasse, which (being polished)
could scarce be discerned from Gold. This was in the Naturall Vre; But
I am doubtfull, whether Men haue sufficiently refined Metals, which we 
count Base; As whether Iron, Brasse, and Tinne, be refined to the Heighth?
But when they come to such a Finenesse, as serueth the ordinary vse, they
trie no further.
                  There haue beene found certaine Cements vnder Earth, that are very
Soft; And yet, taken forth into the Sunne, harden as Hard as Marble:
                     
There are also ordinary Quarries in Sommerset-Shire, which in the Quarry
                     
cut soft to any Bignesse, and in the Building proue firme, and hard.Experiment Solitary touching Coments and Quarries.
                     
                  
                  
                     Liuing Creatures (generally) doe change their Haire with Age, turning
to be Gray, and White: As is seene in Men, though some Earlier,
some Later; In Horses, that are Dappled, and turne White; In Old
Squirrels, that turne Grisly; And many Others.Experiment Solitary, touching the Altering of the Colour of Haires and Feathers.
                      So doe some Birds;
As Cygnets; from Gray turne White; Hawkes, from Browne turne more

                     White: And some Birds there be, that vpon their Moulting, doe turne
Colour; As Robin-Redbrests, after their Moulting, grow to be Red againe,
by degrees; So doe Gold-Finches vpon the Head. The Cause is, for that
Moisture doth (chiefly) colour Haire, and Feathers; And Drinesse turneth
them Gray and White; Now Haire in Age waxeth Drier: So doe
Feathers. As for Feathers, after Moulting, they are Young Feathers, and
so all one as the Feathers of Young Birds. So the Beard is younger than
the Haire of the Head, and doth (for the most part,) wax Hoare later.
Out of this Ground, a Man may deuise the Meanes of Altering the Colour
of Birds, and the Retardation of Heare-Haires. But of this see the fifth
Experiment.
                  
                  The Difference betweene Male and Female, in some Creatures, is not
to be discerned, otherwise than in the Parts of Generation: As in Horses
and Mares, Dogs and Bitches, Doues He and She, and others.Experiment Solitary, touching the Differences of Liuing Creatures, Male &amp; Female.
                      But some
differ in Magnitude, and that diuersly; For in most the Male is the greater;
As in Man, Pheasants, Peacocks, Turkey's; and the like: And in some few,
 as in Hawkes, the Female. Some differ in the Haire, and Feathers, both in
the Quantitie, Crispation, and Colours of them; As He-Lions are Mi
                           •
                        sute,
and haue great Maines; The She's are smooth like Cats. Bulls are more
Crispe vpon the Fore-head than Cowes; The Peacocke, and Pheasant-Cocke,
and Gold-Finch-Cocke, haue glorious and fine Colours; The Henn's haue
not. Generally, the Hees in Birds haue the fairest Feathers. Some differ
in diuers Features; As Bucks haue Hornes, Doe's none; Rammes haue more
wreathed Hornes than Ewes; Cocks haue great Combes and Spurres, Henns
little or none; Boares haue great Fangs, Sowes much lesse; The TurkyCocke
hath great and Swelling Gills, the Hen hath lesse; Men haue generally
Deeper and Stronger Voices than Women. Some differ in Facultie;
As the Cocks amongst Singing Birds, are the best Singers. The Chiefe
Cause of all these, (no doubt,) is, for that the Males haue more Strength
of Heat than the Females; Which appeareth manifestly in this, that all
young Creatures Males, are like Females; And so are Eunuchs, and Gelt
Creatures of all kinds, liker Females. Now Heat causeth Greatnesse of
Growth, generally, where there is Moisture enough to worke vpon: But
if there be found in any Creature, (which is seene rarely,) an Ouer-great
Heat in proportion to the Moisture, in them the Female is the greater;
As in Hawkes, and Sparrowes. And if the Heat be ballanced with the
Moisture, then there is no Difference to be seene betweene Male and Female:
                     
As in the Instances of Horses, and Dogs. Wee see also, that the
Hornes of Oxen, and Cowes, for the most part, are Larger than the Bulls;
which is caused by abundance of Moisture, which in the Hornes of the
Bull faileth
                        •
                      Againe, Heat causeth Pilosuy, and Crispation; And so likewise
Beards in Men. It also expelleth finer Moisture which Want of Heat
cannot Expell: And that is the Cause of the Beauty and Variety of Feathers:
Againe, Heat doth put forth many Excreseences, and much Solide
Matter, which Want of Heat cannot do: And this is the Cause of Hornes,
and of the Greatnesse of them; And of the Greatnesse of the Combes and
Spurres of Cocks, Gills of Turky-Cocks, and Fangs of Boares. Heat also dilateth
the Pipes, and Organs, which causeth the Deepnesse of the Voice. Againe,
Heat refineth the Spirits, and that causeth the Cock-Singing Bird, to
Excell the Hen.
                  
                  There be Fishes greater than any Beasts; As the Whale is farre greater
than the Elephant.

                      And Beasts are (generally) greater than Birds. For
Fishes, the Cause may be, that because they Liue not in the Aire, they
haue not their Moisture drawne and Soaked by the Aire, and Sun-Beames.
Also they rest alwaies, in a manner, and are supported by the Water,
whereas Motion and Labour doe consuine. As for the Greatnesse of Beasts,
                     
more than of Birds, it is caused, for that Beasts stay Longer time in the
Wombe, than
Birds, and there Nourish, and Grow; Whereas in Birds,
after the Egge Lay'd, there is no further Growth, or Nourishment from
the Female: For the Sitting doth Vinifie, and not Nourish.
                  We haue partly touched before the Meanes of Producing Fruits,
without Coares, or Stones.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching Exessasion of Fruits.
                      And this we adde further, that the Cause must
be Abundance of Moisture; For that the Coare, and Stone are made of a
Dry Sap
                           •
                        . And we see that it is possible, to make a Tree put forth onely 
in Blossome, without Fruit; As in Cherries with Double Flowers; Much
more into Fruit without Stone, or Coares. It is reported, that a Cions of an
Apple, grafted vpon a Colo
                           •••
                         Stalke, sendeth forth a great Apple without
a Coare. It is not vnlikely, that if the Inward Pith of a Tree, were taken
out, so that the Iuyce came onely by the Barke, it would worke the
Effect. For it hath beene obserued, that in Pollards, if the Water get in on
the Top, and they become Hollow, they put forth the more. We adde
also, that it is deliuered for certaine by some, that if the Cions be grafted,
the Small End downwards, it will make Fruit haue little or no
Coares, and Stones.

                      that

a Triall to make Tobacco more Aromaticall, and better Concocted here in
England, were a Thing of great profit. Some haue gone about to doe
it by Drenching the English Tobacco, in a Decoction or Infusion of Indian
Tobacco: But those are but Sophistications, and Toyes; For Nothing
that is once Perfect, and hath run his Race, can receiue much Amendment.
You must euer resort to the Beginnings of Things for Melioration.
The Way of Maturation of Tobacco must, as in other Plants, be, from the
Heat, Either of the Earth, or of the Sunne: We see some Leading of this
in Musk-Melons; which are sowen vpon a Hot Bed, Dunged below, vpon
a Bancke turned vpon the South Sunne, to giue Heat by Reflexion;
Laid vpon Tiles, which increaseth the Heat, And Couered with Straw
to keepe them from Cold. They remoue them also, which addeth some
Life: And by these Helpes they become as good in England, as in Italy,
or Prouence. These, and the like Meanes, may be tried in Tobacco. Enquire
also of the Steeping of the Roots, in some such Liquour, as may giue them
Vigour to put forth Strong.
                  
                     Heat of the Sunne, for the Maturation of Fruits; Yea and the Heat of
Viuification of Liuing Creatures; are both represented and supplied, by the
Heat of Fire; And likewise, the Heats of the Sunne, and Life, are represented
one by the other.Experiment Solitary touching seuerall Heats, working the same Effects.
                      
                     Trees, set vpon the Backes of Chimneyes, doe ripen
Fruit sooner. Vines, that haue beene drawne in at the Window of
 a Kitchen, haue sent forth Grapes ripe a Month (at least) before others.
Stoues, at the Backe of Walls, bring forth Orenges here with vs. Egges, as
is reported by some, haue beene hatched in the warmth of an Ouen. It
is reported by the Ancients, that the Estrich Layeth her Egs vnder Sand,
where the Heat of the Sunne disclosed them.
                  
                     Barley in the Boyling swelleth not much; Wheat swelleth more; Rize
extremely; In so much as a Quarter of a Pint (vnboyled) will arise to a
Pint boyled.Experiment Solitary, touching Swelling and Dilatation in Boyling.
                      The Cause (no doubt) is, for that the more Close and Compact
the Body is, the more it will dilate: Now Barley is the most Hollow;

                     Wheat more Solide than that; and Rize most Solide of all. It may be
also that some Bodies haue a Kinde of Lentour, and more Depertible Nature
than others; As we see it Euident in Colouration; For a Small Quantity
of Saffron, will Tinct more, than a very great Quantity of Bresill,
or Wine.

By certaine Speciall Maturations; As by Laying them in Hay, Straw, &amp;c.
 And by Fire; As in Roasting, Stewing, Baking, &amp;c. The Cause of the
Sweetnesse by Rowling, and Pressing, is Emollition, which they properly
enduce; As in Beating of Stock-Fish, Flesh, &amp;c. By Rottennesse is, for that
the Spirits of the Fruit, by Putrefaction, gather Heat, and thereby disgest

the Harder Part: For in all Putrefactions, there is a Degree of Heat. By
Time and Keeping is, because the Spirits of the Body, doe euer feed vpon
the Tangible Parts, and attenuate them. By Seuerall Maturations is, by
some Degree of Heat. And by Fire is, because it is the Proper Worke of
Heat to Refine, and to Incorporate; And all Sourenesse consisteth in
some Grossenesse of the Body: And all Incorporation doth make the Mixture
of the Body, more Equall, in all the Parts; Which euer induceth a
Milder Taste.

                      For
those that are not Edible, the Cause is, for that they haue (commonly)
too much Bitternesse of Taste; And therefore those Creatures, which are
Fierce and Cholerick, are not Edible; As Lions, Wolnes, Squirrells, Dogs,
Foxes, Horses, &amp;c. As for Kine, Sheepe, Goats, Deere, Swine, Conneyes,
Hares, &amp;c. We see they are Milde, and Fearefull. Yet it is true, that Horses,
which are Beasts of Courage, haue beene, and are eaten by some
Nations; As the Scythians were called Hippophagi; And the Chineses eat
Horse-flesh at this day; And some Gluttons haue vsed to haue Colts-flesh
baked. In Birds, such as are Carniuor a, and Birds of Prey, are commonly
no Good Meat; But the Reason is, rather the Cholerick Nature of those
Birds, than their Feeding vpon Flesh; For Puits, Gulls, Shouelers, Duckes,
doe feed vpon Flesh, and yet are Good Meat: And wee see, that those
Birds, which are of Prey, or feed vpon Flesh, are good Meat, when they
are very Young; As Hawkes, Rookes out of the Neast, Owles, &amp;c. Mans
Flesh is not Eaten. The Reasons are Three: First, because Men in Humanity
doe abhorre it: Secondly, because no Liuing Creature, that Dyeth of
it selfe, is good to Eat: And therefore the Ca

                      (themselues) eat no
Mans-flesh, of those that Dye of Themselues, but of such as are Slaine. The
Third is, because there must be (generally) some Disparity, between the
Nourishment, and the Body Nourished; And they must not be Ouer-neere,
or like: Yet we see, that in great Weaknesses, and Consumptions, Man haue
beene sustained with Womans Milke: And Ficinus fondly (as I conceiue)
aduiseth, for the Prolongation of Life, that a Veine be opened in the Arme
of some wholesome Young Man; And the Bloud to be sucked. It is said,
that Witches doe greedily eat Mens flesh; which if it be true, besides a Diuellish
Appetite in them, it is likely to proceed, for that Mans flesh may
send vp High and Pleasing Vapours, which may stirre the Imagination;
And Witches Felicity is chiefly in Imagination, as hath beene said.
                  There is an Ancient Receiued Tradition of the Salamander, that it
liueth in the Fire, and hath force also to extinguish the Fire.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Salamander.
                      It must
haue two Things, if it be true, to this Operation: The One a very Close
Skin, whereby Flame, which in the Midst is not so hot, cannot enter: For 
we see that if the Palme of the Hand be annointed thicke with White of
Egge, and then Aquanita be poured vpon it, and Enflamed, yet one may
endure the Flame a pretty while. The other is some Extreme Cold and

                     Quenching vertue, in the Body of that Creature, which choaketh the Fire.
We see that Milke quencheth Wilde-Fire, better than Water, because it
entreth better.
                  
                     Time doth change Fruit, (as Apples, Peares, Pomgranats, &amp;c.) from
more Soure, to more Sweet: But contrariwise Liquours, (euen those that
are of the Iuyce of Fruit,) from more Sweet to more Soure; As Wort,
Must, New Veriuyce, &amp;c.Experiment Solitary, touching the Contrary Operations of Time, vpon Fruits, and Liquours.
                      The Cause is, the Congregation of the Spirits together:
For in both Kindes, the Spirit is attenuated by Time; But in the
 first Kinde, it is more Diffused, and more Mastered by the Grosser Parts,
which the Spirits doe but disgest: But in Drinkes the Spirits doe raigne,
and finding lesse Opposition of the Parts, become themselues more
Strong; Which causeth also more Strength in the Liquour; Such, as if
the Spirits be of the Hotter Sort, the Liquour becommeth apt to Burne;
But in Time, it causeth likewise, when the Higher Spirits are Euapourated,
more Sourenesse.
                  
                  It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that Plates of Metall, and
especially of Brasse, applied presently to a Blow, will keepe it downe
from Swelling.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Blowes and Bruises.
                      The Cause is Repercussion, without Humectation, or Entrance
                      of any Body: for the Plate hath onely a Virtuall Cold, which doth
not search into the Hurt; Whereas all Plasters, and Ointments doe enter.
Surely, the Cause, that Blowes and Bruises enduce Swellings, is, for that
the Spirits resorting to Succour the Part that Laboureth, draw also the
Humours with them: For we see, that it is not the Repulse, and the Returne
of the Humour in the Part Strucken, that causeth it; For that
Gouts, and Tooth-Aches cause Swelling, where there is no Percussion
at all.
                  The Nature of the Orris Root, is almost Singular; For there be few
Odoriferous Roots; And in those that are, in any degree, Sweet, it is but
the same Sweetnesse with the Wood, or Leafe: But the Orris is not Sweet
                      in the Leafe; Neither is the Flower any thing so Sweet as the Root.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Orris Root.
                      The
Root seemeth to haue a Tender dainty Heat; Which when it commeth
aboue Ground, to the Sunne, and the Aire, vanisheth: For it is a great
Mollifier; And hath a Smell like a Violet.
                  
                  It hath been obserued by the Ancients, that a great Vessell full, drawne
into Bottles; And then the Liquour put againe into the Vessell; will not
fill the Vessell againe, so full as it was, but that it may take in more Liquour:
And that this holdeth more in Wine, than in Water.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Compression of Liquours.
                      The Cause
                      may be Triuiall; Namely, by the Expence of the Liquour, in regard some
may sticke to the Sides of the Bottles: But there may be a Cause more
Subtill; Which is, that the Liquour in the Vessell, is not so much Compressed,
as in the Bottle; Because in the Vessell, the Liquour meeteth with
Liquour chiefly; But in the Bottles a Small Quantity of Liquour, meeteth

with the Sides of the Bottles, which Compresse it so, that it doth not
Open againe.
                  
                     Water, being contiguous with Aire, Cooleth it, but Moisteneth it
not, except it Vapour.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Working of Water vpon Aire Contiguous.
                      The Cause is, for that Heat, and Cold haue a Virtuall
Transition, without Communication of Substance; but Moisture not: And
to all Madefaction there is required an Imbibition: But where the Bodies
are of such seuerall Leuity, and Grauity, as they Mingle not, there can
follow no Imbibition. And therefore, Oyle likewise lyeth at the Top of 
the Water, without Commixture: And a Drop of Water, running swiftly
ouer a Straw, or Smooth Body, wetteth not.
                  
                     Starre-light Nights, yea and bright Moone-shine Nights, are Colder
than Cloudy Nights.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Nature of Aire.
                      The Cause is, the Drinesse and Finenesse of the Aire,
which thereby becommeth more Piercing, and Sharpe? And therefore
Great Continents are colder than Islands: And as for the Moone, though 
it selfe inclineth the Aire to Moisture, yet when it shineth bright, it argueth
the Aire is dry. Also Close Aire is warmer than Open Aire; which
(it may be) is, for that the true Cause of Cold, is an Expiration from the
Globe of the Earth, which in open Places is stronger; And againe, Aire
it selfe, if it be not altered by that Expiration, is not without some Secret
Degree of Heat: As it is not likewise without some Secret Degree of
Light: For otherwise Cats, and Owles, could not see in the Night; But
that Aire hath a little Light. Proportionable to the Visuall Spirits of those
Creatures.
                  
                  The Eyes doe moue 
                        ••••••
                      way; For when one Eye moueth
to the Nosthrill, the other moueth from the Nosthrill.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching the Eyes, and Sight.
                      The Cause is
Motion of Consent, which in the Spirits, and Parts Spirituall, is Strong.
But yet Vse will induce the Contrary: For some can Squint, when they 
will: And the Common Tradition is, that if Children be set vpon a Table,
with a Candle behinde them, both Eyes will moue Outwards; As affecting
to see the Light, and so induce Squinting.
                  
                  We see more exquisitely with One Eye Shut, than with Both Open.
                     
The Cause is, for that the Spirits Visuall vnite themselues more, and so
become Stronger. For you may see, by looking in a Glasse, that when
you shut one Eye, the Pupill of the other Eye, that is Open, Dilateth.
                  The Eyes, if the Sight meet not in one Angle, See Things Double. The 
                     Cause is, for that Seeing two Things, and Seeing one Thing twice, worketh
the same Effect: And therefore a little Pellet, held betweene two
Fingers, laid a-crosse, seemeth Double.
                  
                  
                     Pore-blinde Men, see best in the Dimmer Lights; And likewise haue 
their Sight Stronger neare hand, than those that are not Pore-blinde; And
can Reade and Write smaller Letters. The Cause is, for that the Spirits
Visuall, in those that are Pore-blinde, are Thinner, and Rarer, than in others;
And therefore the Greater Light disperseth them. For the same

                     Cause they need Contracting; But being Contracted, are more strong,
than the Visuall Spirits of Ordinary Eyes are; As when we see thorow a
Leuell, the Sight is the Stronger: And so is it, when you gather the Eyelids
somewhat close: And it is commonly seene in those that are Poreblinde,
that they doe much gather the Eye-lids together. But Old Men,
when they would see to Reade, put the Paper somewhat a farre off. The
Cause is, for that Old Mens Spirits Visuall, contrary to those of Pore-blinde
Men, vnite not, but when the Obiect is at some good distance, from
their Eyes.
                  
                  
                     
                     Men see better, when their Eyes are ouer-against the Sunne, or a Candle,
if they put their Hand a little before their Eye. The Reason is, for that
the Glaring of the Sunne, or the Candle, doth weaken the Eye; wheras the
Light Circumfused is enough for the Perception. For we see, that an Ouerlight
maketh the Eyes Dazell; Insomuch as Perpetuall Looking against
the Sunne, would Cause Blindnesse. Againe, if Men come out of a Great
Light, into a Darke Roome; And contrariwise, if they come out of a
Darke Roome, into a Light Roome, they seeme to haue a Mist before their
Eyes, and see worse, than they shall doe, after they haue stayed a little
while, either in the Light, or in the Darke. The Cause is, for that the Spirits
Visuall, are vpon a Sudden Change, disturbed, and put out of Order;
And till they be recollected, doe not performe their Function well.
For when they are much Dilated by Light, they cannot Contract suddenly;
And when they are much Contracted by Darknesse, they cannot Dilate
suddenly. And Excesse of both these, (that is, of the Dilatation, and
Contraction of the Spirits Visuall,) if it belong, Destroyeth the Eye. For
as long Looking against the Sunne, or Fire, hurteth the Eye by Dilatation;
So Curious Painting in Small Volumes, and Reading of Small Letters, doe
hurt the Eye by Contraction.
                  
                  
                      It hath beene obserued, that in Anger, the Eyes wax Red; And in
Blushing, not the Eyes, but the Eares, and the Parts behinde them. The
Cause is, for that in Anger, the Spirits ascend and wax Eager; Which is
most easily seene in the Eyes, because they are Translucide; Though
withall it maketh both the Cheekes, and the Gills Red; But in Blushing, it
is true, the Spirits ascend likewise to Succour, both the Eyes, and the
Face, which are the Parts that labour: But then they are repulsed by
the Eyes, for that the Eyes, in Shame doe put backe the Spirits, that ascend
to them, as vnwilling to looke abroad: For no Men, in that Passion,
doth looke strongly, but Deiectedly; And that Repulsion from the
Eyes, Diuerteth the Spirits and Heat more to the Eares, and the Parts by
them.
                  
                      The Obiects of the Sight, may cause a great Pleasure and Delight in
the Spirits, but no Paine, or great Offence; Except it be by Memory, as hath
beene said. The Glimpses and Beames of Diamonds that strike the Eye; Indian
Feathers, that haue glorious Colours; The Comming into a Faire
Garden; The Comming into a Faire Roome richly furnished; A Beautifull
Person; And the like; doe delight and exhilarate the Spirits much. The

                     Reason, why it holdeth not in the Offence, is, for that the Sight is the most
Spirituall of the Senses; whereby it hath no Obiect Grosse enough to offend
it. But the Cause (chiefly) is, for that there be no Actiue Obiects to
offend the Eye. For Harmonicall Sounds, and Discordant Sounds, are both
Actiue, and Positiue: So are Sweet Smels, and Stinks: So are Bitter, and
Sweet, in Tastes: So are Ouer-Hot, and Ouer-Cold, in Touch: But Blacknesse,
and Darknesse, are indeed but Priuatiues; And therefore haue little
or no Actiuitie. Somewhat they doe Contristate, but very little.
                  
                     Water of the Sea, or otherwise, looketh Blacker when it is moued, and
Whiter when it resteth.Experiment Solitary, touching the Colour of the Sea, or other Water.
                      The Cause is, for that by meanes of the Motion,
the Beames of light passe not Straight, and therefore must be darkened,
whereas, when it resteth, the Beames doe passe Straight. Besides, Splendour
hath a Degree of Whitenesse; Especially if there be a little Repercussion:
                     
For a Looking-Glasse with the Steele behinde, looketh Whiter, than
Glasse Simple. This Experiment deserueth to be driuen further, in Trying
by what Meanes Motion may hinder Sight.
                  
                  
                     Shell-Fish haue beene, by some of the Ancients, compared and sorted
with the Insecta; But I see no reason why they should; For they haue
Male, and Female, as other Fish haue: Neither are they bred of Putrefaction;
Especially such as doe Moue.Experiment Solitary touching ShellFish.
                      Neuerthelesse it is certaine, that 
                     Oisters, and Cockles, and Mussles, which Moue not, haue no discriminate
Sex: Quare in what time, and how they are bred? It seemeth that Shells
of Oisters are bred where none were before; A 
                        〈◊〉
                      tried, that the great
Horse-Mussle, with the fine shell, that breedeth in Ponds, hath bred within
thirty yeares: But then, which is strange, it hath beene tried, that they
doe not only Gape, and Shut, as the Oisters doe, but Remone from one
Place to Another.
                  The Senses are alike Strong, both on the Right Side, and on the Left;
But the Limmes on the Right Side are Stronger.Experiment Solitary, touching the Right Side, and the Left.
                      The Cause may be, for
that the Braine, which is the Instrument of Sense, is alike on both Sides;
But Motion, and Habilities of Mouing, are somewhat holpen from the Liner,
which lieth on the Right Side. It may be also, for that the Senses are 
put in Exercise, indifferently, on both Sides, from the Time of our Birth;
But the Limmes are vsed most on the Right Side, whereby Custome helpeth;
For wee see that some are Left-Handed: Which are such, as haue
vsed the Left-Hand most.
                  
                     Frictions make the Parts more Fleshie, and Full: As wee see both in
Men; And in Carrying of Horses, &amp;c.Experiment Solitary touching Frictions.
                      The Cause is, for that they draw
greater Quantitie of Spirits and Blond to the Parts: And againe, because 
they draw the Aliment more forcibly from within: And againe, because
they relax the Pores, and so make better Passage for the Spirits, Blond,
and Aliment: Lastly, because they dissipate and disgest any Inutile or Excrementitious

Moisture, which lieth in the Flesh: All which helpe Assimilation.
Frictions also doe more F

                        ll, and Impinguate the Body, than Exercise.
The Cause is, for that in Frictions, the Inward Parts are at rest;
Which in Exercise are beaten (many times) too much: And for the same
Reason, (as we haue noted heretofore,) Gally-Slaues are Fat and Fleshie,
because they stirre the Limmes more, and the Inward Parts lesse.
                  All Globes afarre off appeare Flat.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Globes appearing Flat at Distance.
                      The Cause is, for that Distance, being
a Secundary Obiect of Sight, is not otherwise discerned, than by more
or lesse Light; which Disparitie when it cannot be discerned, all seemeth
One: As it is (generally) in Obiects not distinctly discerned; For so Letters,
                      if they be so farre off, as they cannot be discerned, shew but as a
Duskish Paper: And all Engrauings, and Embossings, (afarre off) appeare
Plaine.

                     Experiment Solitary touching Shadows.
                      The Cause is,
for that the little Moats, which wee see in the Sunne, doe euer Stirre,
though there be no Wind; And therefore those Mouing, in the Meeting
 of the Light and the Shadow, from the Light to the Shadow, and from
the Shadow to the Light, doe shew the Shadow to Moue, because the Medium
Moueth.

                     Experiment Solitary touching the Rowling and Breaking of the Seas
                      The
Cause is, for that the Impulsion being the same in Both; Where there is
great Quantitie of 
                        •••
                     , and likewise Space Enough; there the Water
Rowleth, and Moueth, both more Slowly, and with a Sloper Rise, and
 Fall: But where there is lesse Water, and lesse Space, and the Water dasheth
more against the Bottome; there it moueth more Swiftly, and more
in Precipice; For in the Breaking of the Wanes there is euer a Precipice.
                  
                  It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that Salt-Water Boyled, or
Boyled and Cooled againe, is more Potable, than of it selfe Raw: And yet
the Taste of Salt, in Distillations by Fire, riseth not; For the Distilled Water
will be Fresh.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Dulcoration of Salt Water.
                      The Cause may be, for that the Salt Part of the Water,
                      doth partly rise into a Kinde of Scumme on the Top; And partly goeth
into a Sediment in the Bottome: And so is rather a Separation, than an
Euaporation. But it is too grosse to rise into a Vapour: And so is a Bitter
Taste likewise; For Simple Distilled Waters, of Wormewood, and the like,
are not Bitter.
                  It hath beene set downe before, that Pits vpon the Sea-Shoare, turne
into Fresh Water, by Percolation of the Salt through the Sand: But it is
further noted, by some of the Ancients, that in some Places of Affricke,
after a time, the Water in such Pits will become Brackish againe.Experiment Solitary touching the Returne of Saltnesse in Pits vpon the SeaShore.
                      The
Cause is, for that after a time, the very Sands, thorow which the SaltWater
                      passeth, become Salt; And so the Strainer it selfe is tincted with

                     Salt. The Remedie therefore is, to digge still New Pits, when the old
wax Brackish; As if you would change your Strainer.
                  
                  It hath beene obserued by the Ancients, that Salt Water, will dissolue
Salt put into it, in lesse time, than Fresh Water will dissolue it.Experiment Solitary touching Attraction by Similitude of Substance.
                      The Cause
may be, for that the Salt in the Precedent Water, doth, by Similitude of
Substance, draw the Salt new put in, vnto it; Whereby it diffuseth in the
Liquour more speedily. This is a Noble Experiment, if it be true; For it 
sheweth Meanes of more Quicke and Easie Infusions; And it is likewise
a good Instance of Attraction, by Similitude of Substance. Trie it with
Sugar put into Water, formerly Sugred; And into other Water Vnsugred.
                  
                  Put Sugar into Wine, part of it aboue, part vnder the Wine; And you
shall finde, (that which may seeme strange,) that the Sugar aboue the
Wine, will soften and dissolue sooner, than that within the Wine.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Attraction.
                      The
Cause is, for that the Wine entreth that Part of the Sugar, which is vnder 
the Wine, by Simple Infusion, or Spreading; But that Part aboue the
Wine, is likewise forced by Sacking: For all Spungie Bodies expell the
Aire, and draw in Liquour, if it be Contiguous: As wee see it also in
Spunges, put part aboue the Water. It is worthy the Inquiry, to see how
you may make more Accurate Infusions, by Helpe of Attraction.
                  
                  
                     Water in Wells is warmer in Winter, than in Summer: And so Aire in
Caues.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Heat vnder Earth.
                      The Cause is, for that in the Hither Parts, vnder the Earth, there
is a Degree of some Heat; (As appeareth in Sulphureous Veines, &amp;c.)
Which shur close in, (as in Winter,) is the More; But if it Peripire, (as 
it doth in Summer,) it is the Lesse.
                  It is reported, that amongst the Leucadians, in Ancient time, vpon a
Superstition, they did vse to Precipitate a Man, from a High Cliffe into
the Sea; Tying about him, with Strings, at some distance, many great
Fowles; And fixing vnto his Body diuers Feathers, spred, to breake the 
                     Fast.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Flying in the Aire.
                      Certainly many Birds of good Wing, (As Kites, and the like,)
would beare vp a good Weight, as they file; And Spreading of Feathers,
thinne, and close, and in great Bredth, will likewise beare vp a great
Weight; Being euen laid, without Tilting vpon the Sides. The further
Extension of this Experiment for Flying may be thought vpon.
                  There is, in some Places, (namely in Cephalonia,) a little Shrub,
which they call Holy-Oake, or Dwarfe-Oake: Vpon the Leaues whereof
there riseth a Tumour, like a Blister; Which they gather, and rub out of
it, a certaine Red Dust, that conuerteth (after a while) into Wormes,
                     
which they kill with Wine, (as is reported,) when they begin to Quicken:
With this Dust they die Scarlet.

Candle lighted in the Bottome of a Basen of Water; And turne the Mouth
of the Pot, or Glasse, ouer the Candle, and it will make the Water rise. They
 ascribe it, to the Drawing of Heat; Which is not true: For it appeareth
plainly to be but a Motion of Nexe, which they call Ne detur vacuum;
And it proceedeth thus. The Flame of the Candle, as soone as it is couered,
being suffocated by the Close Aire, lesseneth by little and little: During
which time, there is some little Ascent of Water, but not much: For
the Flame Occupying lesse and lesse Roome, as it lesseneth, the Water
succeedeth. But vpon the Instant of the Candles Going out, there is a sudden
Rise, of a great deale of Water; For that the Body of the Flame filleth
no more Place; And so the Aire, and the Water succeed. It worketh the
same Effect, if in stead of Water, you put Flower, or Sand, into the Basen:
Which sheweth, that it is not the Flames Drawing the Liquour, as Nourishment;
As it is supposed; For all Bodies are alike vnto it; As it is euer
in Motion of Nexe; Insomuch as I haue seene the Glasse, being held by
the Hand, hath lifted vp the Basen, and all: The Motion of Nexe did so
Claspe the Bottome of the Basen. That Experiment, when the Basen was
lifted vp, was made with Oyle, and not with Water; Neuerthelesse this is
true, that at the very first Setting of the Mouth of the Glasse, vpon the Bottome
of the Basen, it draweth vp the Water a little, and then standeth at a
Stay, almost till the Candles Going out, as was said. This may shew some
Attraction at first: But of this we will speake more, when we handle Attractions
by Heat.
                  
                  Of the Power of the Gelestiall Bodies, and what more Secret
Influences they haue, besides the two Manifest Influences
of Heat, and Light, We shall speake, when we handle Experiments
touching the Celestiall Bodies: Meane-while, wee will
giue some Directions for more certaine Trials, of the Vertue
and Influences of the Moone; which is our Nearest Neighbour.

                  The Influences of the Moone, (most obserued,) are Foure.
The Drawing forth of Heat: The Inducing of Putrefaction:
The Increase of Moisture: The Exciting of the Motions of
Spirits.
                  
                  
                     For the Drawing forth of Heat, we haue formerly prescribed, to take 
                     Water Warme, and to set Part of it against the Moone-Beames, and Part of
it with a Skreene betweene; And to see whether that which standeth Exposed
to the Beames, will not Coole sooner. But because this is but a
Small Interposition, (though in the Sunne wee see a Small Shade doth
much,) it were good to try it, when the Moone shineth, and when the
Moone shineth not at all; And with Water Warme in a Glasse-Bottle, as well
as in a Dish; And with C
                           •••
                        rs; And with Iron Red-Hot; &amp;c.
                  For the In
                           •••
                        ing of Putrefaction, it were good to try it with Flesh, or 
                     Fish, Exposed to the Moone-Beames; And againe Exposed to the Aire,
when the Moone shineth not, for the like time; To see whether will corrupt
sooner: And try it also with Capon, or some other Fowle, laid abroad,
to see whether it will mortifie, and become tender sooner? Try
it also with Dead Flies, or Dead Wormes, hauing a little Water cast vpon
them, to see whether will Putrifie sooner. Try it also with an Apple, or
Orenge, hauing Holes made in their Tops, to see whether will Rot or
Mould sooner
                        •
                      Try it also with Holland-Cheese, hauing Wine put into it,
whether will breed Mites sooner, or greater?
                  For the Increase of Moisture, the Opinion Receiued is; That Seeds
                     
will grow soonest; And Haire, and Nailes, and Hedges, and Herbs, Cut,
&amp;c. will grow soonest, if they be Set, or Cut, in the Increase of the Moone.
Also that Braines in Rabits, Wood-cocks, Calues, &amp;c. are fullest in the Full
of the Moone: And so of

in Pits.

                        ••••
                      and set some of them immediately 
after the Change; And others of the same kinde immediately
after the Full: Let them be as Like as can be: The Earth also the Same
as neare as may be; And therefore beft in Pots: Let the Pots also stand,
where no Raine, or Sunne may come to them, lest the Difference of the
Weather confound the Experiment: And then see in what Time, the Seeds
Set in the Increase of the Moone, come to a certaine Height; And how
they differ from chose that are Set in the Decrease of the Moone.
                  
                  It is like, that the Braine of Man waxeth Moister, and Fuller, vpon 
the Full of the Moone: And therefore it were good for those that haue
Moist Braines, and are great Drinkers, to take Fume of Lignum Aloës, RoseMary

And therefore it were good to Purge, some day, or two, after the Full;

                        •••
                      of the Motion of the Spirits, you must note that 
the Growth of Hedges, Herbs, Haire, 
                     
                        •••
                      is caused from the Moone, by

                        •••
                      of the Spirits, as well as by Increase of the Moisture. But for Spirite
in particular, the great Instante is in 
                        
                           •••

                  There may be other Secret Effects of the Influence of the Moone,
                     
which are not yet brought into Obseruation. It may be, that if it so fill

out, that the Wind be North, or North-East, in the Full of the Moone, it
increaseth Cold; And if South, or South-West, it disposeth the Aire, for a
good while, to Warmth, and Raine; Which would be obserued.
                  
                      It may be, that Children, and Young Cattell, that are Brought forth in
the Full of the Moone, are stronger, &amp; larger, than those that are brought
forth in the Wane: And those also which are Begotten in the Full of the
Moone: So that it might be good Husbandry, to put Rams, and Bulls to
their Females, somewhat before the Full of the Moone. It may be also,
that the Egs lay'd in the Full of the Moone, breed the better Bird: And a
Number of the like Effects, which may be brought into Obseruation:
Quare also, whether great Thunders, and Earth-Quakes, be not most
in the Full of the Moone?
                  
                  The Turning of Wine to Vinegar, is a Kinde of Putrefaction: And
in Making of Vinegar, they vse to set Vessels of Wine ouer against the

                     Noone-Sunne; which calleth out the more Oyly Spirits, and leaueth the
Liquour more Soure, and Hard.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Vinegar. We see also, that Burnt-Wine is more
Hard, and Astringent, than Wine Vnburnt. It is said, that Cider in Nauigations
vnder the Line ripeneth, when Wine or Beere soureth. It were good
to set a Rundlet of Veriuyce ouer against the Sunne, in Summer, as they
doe Vinegar, to see whether it will Ripen, and Sweeten.
                  There be diuers Creatures, that Sleepe all Winter; As the Beare, the
Hedge-hog, the Bat, the Bee, &amp;c.Experiment Solitary, touching Creatures that Sleepe all Winter.
                      These all wax Fat when they Sleepe, and
egest not. The Cause of their Fattening, during their Sleeping time, may
be the Want of Assimilating, For whatsoeuer Attimilation not to Flesh,
 turneth either to Sweat, or Fat. These Creatures, for part of their Sleeping
Time, haue been obserued not to Stirre at all; And for the other
part, to Stirre, but not to Remoue. And they get Warme and Close Places
to Sleepe in. When the Flemmings Wintred in Noua Zembla, the Beares,
about the Middle of Nouember, went to Sleepe; And then the Foxes began
to come forth, which durst not before. It is noted by some of the
Ancients, that the Shee-Beare breedeth, and lyeth in with her Young, during
that time of Rest: And that a Beare, Big with Young, hath seldome
beene seene.
                  Some Liuing Creatures are Procreated by Copulation betweene Male,
and Female: Some by Putrefaction; And of those which come by Putrefaction, many doe (neuerthelesse) afterwards procreate by Copulation.
                     Experiment Solitary touching the Generating of Creatures by Copulation, and by Putrefaction.
                     
For the Cause of both Generations: First, it is most certaine, that the
Cause of all Viuification, is a Gentle and Proportionable Heat, working vpon
 a Glutinous and Yeelding Substance: For the Heat doth bring forth Spirit
in that Substance: And the Substance, being Glutinous, produceth Two
Effects: The One, that the Spirit is Detained, and cannot Breake forth:
The Other, that the Matter being Gentle, and Yeelding, is driuen forwards
by the Motion of the Spirits, after some Swelling into Shape, and Members.
                     
Therefore all Sperme, all Menstruous Substance, all Matter whereof Creatures
are produced by Putrefaction, haue euermore a Closenesse, Lentour,
and Sequacity. It seemeth therefore, that the Generation by Sperme onely,
and by Putrefaction, haue two Different Causes. The First is, for that
Creatures, which haue a Definite and Exact Shape, (as those haue which
are Procreated by Copulation,) cannot be produced by a Weake, and Casuall
Heat; Nor out of Matter, which is not exactly Prepared, according
to the Species. The Second is, for that there is a greater Time required,
for Maturation of Perfect Creatures; For if the Time required in Viuification
be of any length, then the Spirit will Exhale, before the Creature be
Mature: Except it be Enclosed in a Place where it may haue Continuance
of the Heat, Accesse of some Nourishment to maintaine it, and Closenesse
that may keepe it from Exhaling. And such Places are the Wombes, and
Matrices, of the Females. And therefore all Creatures, made of Putrefaction,
are of more Vncertaine Shape; And are made in Shorter Time; And
need not so Perfect an Enclosure, though some Closenesse be commonly
required. As for the Heathen Opinion, which was, that vpon great Mutations
of the World, Perfect Creatures were first Engendred of Concretion; As well as Frogs, and Wormes, and Flies, and such like,
are now; Wee know it to be vaine: But if any such
Thing should be admitted, Discoursing according
to Sense, it cannot be, except you admit
a Chaos first, &amp; Commixture of Heauen,
and Earth. For the Frame of
the World, once in Order, cannot
effect it by any Extesse,
or Casualtie.

It was, that the World was
One, Entire, Perfect, Liuing Creature;
Insomuch as Apolloni
                           •

                           •
                        a, a
Pythagorean Prophet, affirmed, that the Ebbing and Flowing
of the Sea, was the Respiration of the World, drawing in Water
as Breath, and putting it forth againe. They went on, and
inferred; That if the World were a Liuing Creature, it had a
Soule, and Spirit; Which also they ha
                        •••
                      calling it Spiritus
Mundi; The Spirit or Soule of the World: By which they did
not intend God; (for they did admit of a Deitie besides;) But

only the Soule, or Essentiall Forme of the Vniue
                           •
                        se. This
Foundation being laid, they mought build vpon it, what they
would; For in a Liuing Creature, though neuer so great, (As
for Example, in a great Whale,) the Sense, and the Affects of
any one Part of the Body, instantly make a Transcursion tho
                        •
                     
rowout the whole Body: So that by this they did insinuate,
that no Distance of Place, nor Want or Indisposition of Matter,
could hinder Magicall Operations; But that, (for Example,)
wee mought here in Europe, haue Sense and Feeling of that,
which was done in China: And likewise, we mought worke
any Effect, without, and against Matter: And this, not Holpen
by the Cooperation of Angels, or Spirits, but only by the Vnitie
and Harmonie of Nature. There were some also, that staid
not here; but went further, and held; That if the Spirit of
Man, (whom they call the Microcosme,) doe giue a fit touch
to the Spirit of the World, by strong Imaginations, and Beleefes,
it might command Nature; For Paracelsus, and some
darksome Authors of Magicke, doe ascribe to Imagination Exalted,
the Power of Miracle-working Faith. With these Vast
and Bottomelesse Follies, Men haue been (in part) entertained.
                  But wee, that hold firme to the Works of God; And to the
Sense, which is Gods Lampe; (Lucerna Dei Spiraculum Hominis;)
willen quire, with all Sobrietie, and Seueritie, whether
there be to be found, in the Foot-steps of Nature, any
such Transmission and Influx of Immateriate Vertues; And
what the Force of Imagination is; Either vpon the Body Imaginant,
or vpon another Body: Wherein it will be like that
Labour of Hercules, in Purging the Stable of Augeas, to separate
from Superstitious, and Magicall Arts, and Obseruations,
any thing that is cleane, and pure Naturall; And not to be either
Contemned, or Condemned. And although wee shall
haue occasion to speake of this in more Places than One, yet
we will now make some Entrance thereinto.
                  
                     Men are to be Admonished, that they doe not with-draw Credit,
from the Operations by Transmission of Spirits, and Force of Imagination,
because the Effects faile sometimes.

                           , touching
Transmission
of Spirits,
and the Force
of Imagination.
                      For as in Infection, and Contagion
from Body to Body, (as the Plague, and the like,) it is most certaine, that

the Infection is receiued (many times) by the Body Passiue, but yet is by
the Strength, and good Disposition thereof, Repulsed, and wrought out,
before it be formed into a Disease; So much more in Impressions from
Minde to Minde, or from Spirit to Spirit, the Impression taketh, but is Encountred,
and Ouercome, by the Minde and Spirit, which is Passiue, before
it worke any manifest Effect. And therefore, they worke most vpon
Weake Mindes, and Spirits: As those of Women; Sicke Persons; Superstitious,
and Fearfull Persons; Children, and Young Creatures;
                     Nescio quis teneros Oculus mihi fascinat Agnos:
The Poet speaketh not of Sheepe, but of Lambs. As for the Weaknesse of
the Power of them, vpon Kings, and Magistrates; It may be ascribed, (besides
the maine, which is the Protection of God, ouer those that Execute
his Place,) to the Weaknesse of the Imagination of the Imaginant: For it is
hard, for a Witch, or a Sorcerer, to put on a Beleefe, that they can hurt
such Persons.
                  
                  
                     Men are to be Admonished, on the other side, that they doe not easily 
giue Place and Credit to these Operations, because they Succeed many
times; For the Cause of this Successe, is (oft) to be truly ascribed, vnto
the Force of Affection and Imagination, vpon the Body Agent; And then
by a Secondary Meanes, it may worke vpon a Diuers Body: As for Example;
If a Man carry a Planets Seale, or a Ring, or some Part of a Beast, beleeuing
strongly, that it will helpe him to obtaine his Loue; Or to keepe
him from danger of hurt in Fight; Or to preuaile in a Suit; &amp;c. it may
make him more Actiue, and Industrious; And againe, more Confident,
and Persisting, than otherwise he would be. Now the great Effects that
may come of Industrie, and Perseuerance, (especially in Ciuill Businesse,)
who knoweth not? For wee see Audacitie doth almost binde and mare
the weaker Sort of Minds; And the State of Humane Actions is so variable,
that to trie Things oft, and neuer to giue ouer, doth Wonders:
Therefore, it were a Meere Fallacie and Mistaking, to ascribe that to the
Force of Imagination, vpon another Body, which is but the Force of Imagination
vpon the Proper Body: For there is no doubt, but that Imagination,
and Vehement Affection, worke greatly vpon the Body of the Imaginant:
As wee shall shew in due place.
                  
                     Men are to be Admonished, that as they are not to mistake the Causes
                     
of these Operations; So, much lesse, they are to mistake the Fact, or Effect;
And rashly to take that for done, which is not done. And therefore,
as diuers wise Indges haue prescribed, and cautioned, Men may
not too rashly beleeue, the Confessions of Witches, nor yet the Enidence
against them. For the Witches themselues are Imaginatiue, and beleeue
oft-times, they doe that, which they doe not: And People are Credulous
in that point, and ready to impute Accidents, and Naturall Operations, to
Witch Craft. It is worthy the Obseruing, that both in Ancient, and Late
times; (As in the Thassalian Witches, and the Meetings of Witches that
haue beene recorded by so many late Confessions;) the great Wonders
which they tell, of Carrying in the Aire; Transforming themselues into

other Bodies; &amp;c. are still reported to be wrought, not by Incantations,
or Ceremonies; But by Ointments, and Annointing themselues all ouer.
This may iustly moue a Man to thinke, that these Fables are the Effects of
Imagination: For it is certaine, that Ointments doe all, (if they be laid on
any thing thicke,) by Stopping of the Pores, shut in the Vapours, and send
them to the Head extremely. And for the Particular Ingredients of those
Magicall Ointments, it is like they are Opiate, and Soporiferous. For Annointing
of the Fore-head, Necke, Feet, Back-Bone, we know is vsed for Procuring
Dead Sleepes: And if any Man say, that this Effect would be better
done by Inward Potions; Answer may be made, that the Medicines,
which goe to the Ointments, are so strong, that if they were vsed inwards,
they would kill those that vse them: And therefore they worke Potently,
though Outwards.
                  We will diuide the Seuerall Kindes of the Operations, by
Transmission of Spirits, and Imagination; Which will giue no
small Light to the Experiments that follow. All Operations by
Transmission of Spirits, and Imagination haue this; That they
Worke at Distance, and not at Touch; And they are these being
distinguished.
                  
                      The First is the Transmission or Emission, of the Thinner, and more
Airy Parts of Bodies; As in Odours, and Infections; And this is, of all the
rest, the most Corporeall. But you must remember withall, that there be
a Number of those Emissions, both Wholesome, and Vnwholesome, that giue
no Smell at all: For the Plague, many times, when it is taken, giueth no
Sent at all: And there be many Good and Healthfull Aires, that doe appeare
by Habitation, and other Proofes, that differ not in Smell from other
Aires. And vnder this Head, you may place all Imbibitions of Aire,
where the Substance is Materiall, Odour-like; Whereof some neuerthelesse
are strange, and very suddenly diffused; As the Alteration, which
the Aire receiueth in AEgypt, almost immediately, vpon the Rising of the
Riuer of Nilus, whereof we haue spoken.
                  
                      The Second is the Transmission or Emission of those Things that wee
call Spirituall Species; As Visibles, and Sounds: The one whereof wee
haue handled; And the other we shall handle in due place. These moue
swiftly, and at great distance; But then they require a Medium well disposed;
And their Transmission is easily stopped.
                  
                      The Third is the Emissions, which cause Attraction of Certaine Bodies
at Distance; Wherein though the Loadstone be commonly placed in the
First Ranke, yet we thinke good to except it, and referre it to another
Head: But the Drawing of Amber, and let, and other Electricke Bodies;
And the Attraction in Gold of the Spirit of Quick-Siluer, at distance; And
the Attraction of Heat at distance; And that of Fire to Naphtha; And
that of some Herbs to Water, though at distance; And diuers others; We
shall handle, but yet not vnder this present Title, but vnder the Title of
Attraction in generall.
                  
                     The Fourth is the Emission of Spirits, and Immateriate Powers and 
                     Vertues, in those Things, which worke by the Vniuersall Configuration,
and Sympathy of the World; Not by Formes, or Colestiall Influxes, (as is
vainly caught and receiued,) but by the Primitiue Nature of Matter, and
the Seeds of Things. Of this kinde is, (as we yet suppose,) the Working of

                  The Fifth is the Emissions of Spirits; And this is the Principall in our 
Intention to handle now in this Place Namely, the Operation of the Spirits
of the Minde of Man, vpon other Spirits: And this is of a Double Nature:
The Operations of the Affections, if they be Vehement; And the
Operation of the Imagination, if it be Strong. But these two are so Conp

                        lestiall Bodies, and Motions.
                  
                  The Seuenth is the Operations of Sympathy; Which the Writers of 
                     Naturall Magicke haue brought into an Art, or Precept: And it is this;
That if you desire to Super-induce, any Vertue or Disposition, vpon a Person,
you should take the Liuing Creature, in which that Vertue is most Emine
                           ••
                        ,
and in Perfection: Of that Creature you must take the Parts,
wherein that Virtue chiefly is Collecate: Againe, you must take those
Parts, in the Time, and Act, when that Vertue is most in Exercise; And
then you must apply it to that Part of Man, wherein that Vertue chiefly
Consisteth. As if you would Super-induce Courage and Fortitude, take a
Lion, or a Coche; And take the Heart, Teeth, or Paw of the Lion; Or the
Heart, or Spurre of the Cocke: Take those Parts immediately after the
Lion, or the Cocke haue beene in Fight; And let them be worne, vpon a
Mans Heart, or Wrest. Of these and such like Sympathies, we shall speake
vnder this present Title.
                  
                  The Eighth and last is, an Emission of Immateriate Vertues; Such as 
we are a little doubtfull to Propound; It is so predigious: But that it
is so conste

                     ouched by many: And wee hour set it downe, as a
Law to our Selues, to examine things to the Bottome; And not to receiue
vpon Credit, or reiect vpon Improbabilities, vntill there hath passed
a due Examination. This is, the Sympathy of Indiuiduals: For as

there is a Sympathy of Species; So, (it may be) there is a Sympathy of Indiuiduals:
That is, that in Things, or the Parts of Things, that haue beene
once Contiguous, or Entire, there should remaine a Transmission of Vertue,
from the One to the Other: As betweene the Weapon, and the Wound.
Whereupon is blazed abroad the Operation of Vnguentum Teli: And so
of a Peece of Lard, or Sticke of Elder, &amp;c. that if Part of it be Consumed
or Putrified, it will worke vpon the other Part Seuered. Now wee will
pursue the Instances themselues.

beene said.Experiments

of Spirits
in Vapour, or
Exhalation, Odour-like.
                      And they report, that where it is found, it hath a Sent, of the
Smell of a Mellow Apple; And (as some say) of May-Flowers: And it is
also receiued, that Smels of Flowers, that are Mellow and Lushious, are ill
for the Plague; As White Lillies, Cowslips, and Hyacinths.
                  
                  
                      The Plague is not easily receiued by such, as continually are about
them, that haue the Plague; As Keepers of the Sicke, and Physitians; Nor
 againe by such as take Antidotes, either Inward, (as Mithridate; InniperBerries;
Rue, Leafe and Seed; &amp;c.) Or Outward, (as Angelica, Zedoary,
and the like, in the Mouth; Tarre, Galbanum, and the like, in Perfume;)
Nor againe by Old People, and such as are of a Dry and Cold Complexion.
On the other side, the Plague taketh soonest hold of those, that come out
of a Fresh Aire; And of those that are Fasting; And of Children; And it
is likewise noted to goe in a Bloud, more than to a Stranger.
                  
                  
                      The most Pernicious Infection, next the Plague, is the Smell of the
Iayle; When Prisoners haue beene Long, and Close, and Nastily kepti
Whereof we haue had, in our time, Experience, twice or thrice; when
both the Iudges that sate vpon the Iayle, and Numbers of those that attended
the Businesse, or were present, Sickned vpon it, and Died. Therfore
it were good wisdome, that in such Cases, the Iayle were Aired, before
they be brought forth.
                  
                      Out of question, if such Foule Smels be made by Art, and by the
Hand, they consist chiefly of Mans Flesh, or Sweat, Putrified; For they
are not those Stinckes, which the Nosthrils streight abhorre, and expell,
that are most Pernicious; But such Aires, as haue some Similitude with
Mans Body; And so insinuate themselues, and betray the Spirits. There
may be great danger, in vsing such Compositions, in great Meetings of
People, within Houses; As in Churches; At Arraignments; At Playes and
Solemnities; And the like; For Poysoning of Aire is no lesse dangerous
than Poysoning of Water; Which hath beene vsed by the Turkes in the
Warres; And was vsed by Emanuel Commenus towards the Christians,
when they passed thorow his Countrey to the Holy Land. And these Empoisonments
of Aire, are the more dangerous in Meetings of People; Because
the much Breath of People, doth further the Reception of the Infection:
And therefore, where any such Thing is feared, it were good, those
Publique Places were perfumed, before the Assemblies.
                  
                  
                      The Empoysonment of Particular Persons, by Odours, hath beene reported

to be in Perfumed Gloues, or the like: And it is like, they Mingle
the Poyson that is dexdly, with some Smels that are Sweet, which also
maketh it the sooner receiued. Plagues also haue been raised by Annointings
of the Chinckes of Doores, and the like; Nor so much by the Touch,
as for that it is common for Men, when they finde any thing Wet vpon
their Fingers, to put them to their Nose; Which Men therefore should
take heed how they doe. The best is, that these Compositions of Infectious
Aires, cannot be made without Danger of Death, to them that make
them. But then againe, they may haue some Antidotes to saue themselues,
So that Men ought not to be secure of it.
                  There haue beene, in diuers Countries, great Plagues, by the Putrefaction,
                     
of great Swarmes of Grasse-Hoppers, and L

                        custs, when they haue
beene dead, and cast vpon Heaps.
                  It hapneth oft in Mines, that there are Damps, which kill, either by 
                     Suffocation, or by the Poysonous Nature of the Minerall: And those that
deale much in Refining, or other Workes about Metals, and Minerals,
haue their Braines Hurt and Stupefied by the Metalline Vapours. Amongst
which, it is noted, that the Spirits of Quick-Siluer, euer fly to the Skull,
Teeth, or Bones; In so much as Gilders vse to haue a Peece of Gold in
their Mouth, to draw the Spirits of the Quick-Siluer; Which Gold afterwards
they finde to be Whintened. There are also certaine Lakes, and
Pits, such as that of Anernus, that Poyson Birds, (as is said,) which fly ouer
them; Or Men, that stay too long about them.
                  The Vapour of Char-Code, or Sea-Coale, in a Close Roome, hath killed 
many: And it is the more dangerous, because it commeth without
any Tll Smell; But stealeth on by little and little; Enducing only a F

without any Manifest Strangling. When the Dutch-Men Wintred
at Noua Zembla, and that they could gather no more Stickes, they fell to
make Fire of some Sea-Coale they had, wherewith (at first) they were
much refreshed; But a little after they had sit about the Fire, there grew
a Generall Silence, and lothnesse to speake amongst them; And immediately
after, One of the Weakest of the Company, fell downe in a
Swoune; Whereupon they doubting what it was, opened their doore,
to let in Aire, and so saued themselues. The Effect (no doubt) is
wrought by the Inspissation of the Aire; And so of the Breath, and Spirits.
The like ensueth in Roomes newly Plastered, if a Fire be made in
them; Whereof no lesse Man than the Emperour Ioninianus Died.

in those that are in the Roome.
                  
                  It is an Ancient Tradition, that Bleare-Byes infect Sound-Eyes; And 
that a Menstruous Woman, looking vpon a Glasse, doth rust it. Nay they

haue an Opinion, which seemeth Fabulous; That Menstruous Women, going
ouer a Field, or Garden, doe Corne and Herbes good by Killing the
Wormes.

                     Perfumes Conuenient doe dry and strengthen the Braine; And stay
Rbeumes and Defluxions; As we finde in Fame of Rose-Mary dryed, and
Lignum Aloës, and Calamus, taken at the Mouth, and Nosthrils; And no
doubt there be other Perfumes, that doe moisten, and refresh; And are
fit to be vsed in Burning Agues, Consumptions, and too much Wakefulnesse;
Such as are, Rose-Water, Vinegar, Limon-Pills, Violets, the Leanes of
Vines sprinckled with a little Rose-Water, &amp;c.
                  
                      They doe vse in Sudden Faintings, and Swonnings, to put a Handkerchiefe

or a Little Vinegar, to the Nose; Which gathereth
together againe the Spirits, which are vpon point to resolue, and fall

                     Tobacco comforteth the Spirits, and dischargeth Wearinesse; Which
it worketh partly by Opening; But chiefly by the Opiate Vertue, which
condenseth the Spirits. It were good therefore to try the Taking of
Fumes by Pipes, (as they doe in Tobacco,) of other Things; As well to
dry, and comfort, as for other Intentions. I wish Triall be made of the
Drying Fume, of Rose-Mary, and Lignum Aloës, before mentioned, in Pipe;
And so of Nutmeg, and Folium Indum; &amp;c.
                  
                      The Following of the Plough, hath been approued, for Refreshing the
Spirits, and Procuring Appetite: But to doe it in the Ploughing for Wheat,
or Rye, is not so good; Because the Earth hath spent her Sweet Breath,
in Vegetables, put forth in Summer. It is better therefore to doe it, when
you sow Barley. But because Ploughing is tied to Seasons, it is best to
take the Aire of the Earth, new turned vp, by Digging with the Spade; Or
Standing by him that Diggeth. Gentlewomen may doe themselues much
good by kneeling vpon a Cushion, and Weeding. And these Things you
may practise in the best Seasons; Which is euer the Early Spring. before
the Earth putteth forth the Vegetables; And in the Sweetest Earth you
can chuse. It would be done also, when the Dew is a little off the Ground,
lest the Vapour be too Moist. I knew a great Man, that liued Long, who
had a Cleane Clod of Earth, brought to him euery Morning, as he sate in
his Bed; And he would hold his Head ouer it, a good pretty while. I
Commend also, sometimes, in Digging of New Earth, to poure in some
Malmesey, or Greeke Wine; That the Vapour of the Earth, and Wine together,
may comfort the Spirits, the more; Prouided alwaies, it be not taken,
for a Heathen Sacrifice, or Libation to the Earth.
                  
                  
                      They haue, in Physicke, Vse of Pomanders, and Knots of Powders, for
Drying of Rheumes, Comforting of the Heart, Prouking of Sleepe, &amp;c. For
though those Things be not so Strong as Perfumes, yet you may haue
them continually in your Hand; whereas Perfumes you can take but at

                     Times; And besides, there be diuers Things, that breath better of themselues,
than when they come to the Fire; As Nigella Romana, the Seed

                  There be two Things, which (inwardly vsed) doe Coole and condense 
the Spirits; And I wish the same to be tried outwardly in Vapours.
The One is Nitre, which I would haue dissoluted in Malmesey, or GreekeWine,
and so the Smell of the Wine taken; Or if you would haue it more
forcible, poure of it vpon a Fire-pan, well heated, as they doe Rose-Water,
and Vinegar. The other is, the Distilled Water of Wilde Poppy; which
I wish to be mingled, at halfe, with Rose-Water, and so taken with some
Mixture of a few Clones, in a Perfuming-Pan. The like would be done
with the Distilled Water of Saffron Flowers.
                  
                  
                     Smells of Muske, and Amber, and Ciuit, are thought to further Venereous 
Appetite: Which they may doe by the Refreshing and Calling forth
of the Spirits.
                  
                  
                     Incense, and Nidorous Smells, (such as were of Sacrifices,) were thought 
to Intoxicate the Braine, and to dispose Men to Deuotion: Which they
may doe, by a kinde of Sadnesse, and Contristation of the Spirits: And
partly also by Heating, and Exalting them. Wee see, that amongst the
Iewes, the Principall Perfume of the Sanctuary, was forbidden all Common
Vses.
                  
                  There be some Perfumes, prescribed by the Writers of Naturall Magicke,
                     
which procure Pleasant Dreames; And some others, (as they
say,) that procure Propheticall Dreames; As the Seeds of Flax, Fleawort,
&amp;c.
                  It is certaine, that Odours doe, in a small Degree, Nourish; Especially 
the Odour of Wine: And we see Men a hungred, doe loue to smell
Hot Bread. It is related, that Democritus, when he lay a dying, heard a
Woman, in the House, complaine, that she should be kept from being at
a Feast, and Solemnity, (which she much desired to see,) because there
would be a Corps in the House; Whereupon he caused Loaues of New
Bread to be sent for, and opened them; And powred a little Wine into
them; And so kept himselfe aliue with the Odour of them, till the Feast
was past. I knew a Gentleman, that would fast (sometimes) three or
foure, yea fiue dayes, without Meat, Bread, or Drinke; But the same Man
vsed to haue continually, a great Wispe of Herbes, that he smelled on:
And amongst those Herbes, some Esculent Herbs of strong Sent; As Onions,
Garlicke, Leekes, and the like.
                  They doe vse, for the Accident of the Mother, to burne Feathers, and 
other Things of Ill Odour: And by those Ill Smells, the Rising of the Mother
is put downe.
                  There be Aires, which the Physitians aduise their Patients to remoue 
vnto, in Consumptions, or vpon Recouery of Long Sicknessess Which (commonly)
are Plaine Champaignes, but Grasing, and not Ouen-growne with
Heath, or the like: Or else Timber-Shades, as in Forrests, and the like. It is
noted also, that Groues of Bayes doe forbid Pestilent Aires; Which was

accounted a great Cause of the Wholesome Aire of Antiochia. There be
also some Soyles that put forth Odorate Herbes of themselues; As Wilde
Thyme; Wilde Maioram; Penny-Roiall; Camomill; And in which the BriarRoses
smell almost like Muske-Roses; Which (no doubt) are Signes that
doe discouer an Excellent Aire.
                  
                  
                      It were good for Men, to thinke of hauing Healthfull Aire, in their
Houses; Which will neuer be, if the Roomes be Low-roosed, or full of Windowes,
and Doores; For the one maketh the Aire Close, and not Fresh;
And the other maketh it Exceeding Vnequall; Which is a great Enemy
to Health. The Windowes also should not be high vp to the Roofe, (which
is in vse for Beauty, and Magnificence,) but Low. Also Stone-Walls are
not wholesome; But Timber is more wholesome; And especially Brick.
Nay it hath beene vsed by some, with great Successe, to make their
Walls thicke; And to put a Lay of Chalke betweene the Brickes, to take
away all Dampishnesse.
                  
                  These Emissions, (as we said before,) are handled, and ought to be
handled, by themselues, vnder their Proper Titles: That is, Visibles, and
Andibles, each a-part: In this Place, it shall suffice to giue some generall
Obseruations, Common to both.Experiment Solitary touching the Emissions of Spiritual Species which Affect the Senses.

Thirdly, they Worke at Large Distances.

Nor leaue no Worke behinde them; But are Energies meerely; For their
Working vpon Mirrours, and Places of Eccho, doth not alter any Thing in
those Bodies; But it is the same Action with the Originall, onely Repercussed.
And as for the Shaking of windowes, or Rarefying the Aire by
Great Noyses; And the Heat caused by Burning-Glasses; They are rather
Concomitants of the Andible, and Visible Species, than the Effects of them.
Sixthly, they seeme to be ofso Tender, and Weake a Nature, as they affect
onely such a Rare, and Attenuate Substance, as is the spirit of Liuing
Creatures.

                  There was an AEgyptian South-Sayer, that made Anthonius beleeue,
that his Genius, (which otherwise was Braue, and Confident,) was, in the
Presence of Octanianus Caesar, Poore, and Cowardly: And therefore, he
aduised him, to absent himselfe, (as much as he could,) and remoue far
from him. This South-Sayer was thought to be suborned by Cleopatra,
                      to make him liue in AEgypt, and other Remote Places from Rome. Howsouer
 the Conceit of a Perdominant or Mastering Spirit, of one Man

                     There are Conceits, that some Men, that are of an Ill, and Melancholy 
Nature, doe incline the Company, into which they come, to be Sad;
and Ill disposed; And contrariwise, that Others, that are of a Iouiall Nature,
doe dispose the Company to be Merry and Cheerefull. And againe,
that some Men are Lucky to be kept Company with, and Employed; And Others
Vnlucky. Certninly, it is agreeable to Reason, that there are, at the
least, some Light Effluxions from Spirit to Spirit, when Men are in Presence
one with another, as well as from Body to Body.
                  
                  It hath beene obserued, that Old Men, who haue loued Toung Company,
                     
and beene Conuersant continually with them, haue beene of Long
Life; Their Spirits, (as it seemeth,) being Recreated by such Company.

Auditours, and Disciples; As Gorgias, Protagoras, Isocrates, &amp;c. Who liued

and Earnestnesse, and Persisting and Importunity, there should be
some Secret Binding, and Stooping of other Mens Spirits, to such
Persons.
                  
                  The Affections (no doubt) doe make the Spirits more Powerfull, and 
                     Actiue; And especially those Affections, which draw the Spirits into the
Eyes: Which are two: Loue, and Enuy, which is called Oculus Malus. As
for Loue, the Platonists, (some of them,) goe so farre, as to hold that the
Spirit of the Louer, doth passe into the Spirits, of the Person Loued;
Which causeth the desire of Returne into the Body, whence it was Emitted:
Whereupon followeth that Appetite of Contact, and Coninuction.
which is in Louers. And this is obserued likewise, that the Aspects that
procure Loue, are not Gazings, but Sudden Glances, and Dartings of the
Eye. As for Enuy, that emitteth some Maligne and Poysonous Spirit,
which taketh hold of the Spirit of Another; And is likewise of greatest
Force, when the Cast of the Eye is Oblique. It hath beene noted also, that
it is most Dangerous, when an Enuious Eye is cast vpon Persons in Glory,
and Triumph, and Ioy. The Reason whereof is, for that, at such times, the
Spirits come forth most, into the Outward Parts, and so meet the Percussion
of the Enuious Eye, more at Hand: And therefore it hath beene noted,
that after great Triumphs, Men haue beene ill disposed, for some
Daies following. We see the Opinion of Fascination is Ancient, for
both Effects; Of Procuring Loue; And Sicknesse caused by Envy: And
Fascination is euer by the Eye. But yet if there be any such Infection from
Spirit to Spirit, there is no doubt, but that it worketh by Presence, and
not by the Eye alone; Yet most Forcibly by the Eye.
                  
                  
                     Feare, and Shame, are likewise Infection; For we see that the Starting
                     
of one will make another ready to Start: And when one Man
is out of Conntenance in a Company, others doe likewise Blush in his behalfe.
                  
                     Now we will speake of the Force of Imagination vpon other
Bodies; And of the Meanes to Exalt and Strengthen it.
Imagination, in this Place, I vnderstand to be, the Representation
of an Indiuiduall Thought. Imagination is of three Kinds:
The First Ioyned with Beleefe of that which is to Come: The
Second Ioyned with Memory of that which is Past: And the
Third is of Things Present, or as if they were Present; For I
comprehend in this, Imaginations Faigned, and at Pleasure;
As if one should Imagine such a Man to be in the Vestments of
a Pope; Or to haue Wings. I single out, for this time, that
which is with Faith, or Beleefe of that which is to Come. The
Inquisition of this Subiect, in our way, (which is by Induction,)
is wonderfull hard; for the Things that are reported,
are full of Fables; And New Experiments can hardly be made,
but with Extreme Caution, for the Reason which wee will
hereafter declare.
                  The Power of Imagination is in three Kindes; The First,
vpon the Body of the Imaginant; Including likewise the Childe
in the Mothers Wombe; The Second is, the Power of it vpon
Dead Bodies, as Plants, Wood, Stone, Metall, &amp;c. The Third is,
the Power of it, vpon the Spirits of Men, and Liuing Creatures:
And with this last we will onely meddle.
                  The Probleme therefore is, whether a Man Constantly and
Strongly Beleeuing, that such a Thing shall be; (As that such an
One will Loue Him; Or that such an One will Grant him his Request;
Or that such an One shall Recouer a Sicknesse; Or the
like;) It doth helpe any thing to the Effecting of the Thing it
selfe. And here againe we must warily distinguish; For it is
not meant, (as hath beene partly said before,) that it should
helpe by Making a Man more Stout, or more Industrious; (In
which kinde a Constant Beleefe doth much;) But meerely by
a Secret Operation, or Binding, or Changing the Spirit of Another:
And in this it is hard, (as we began to say,) to make any
New Experiment; For I cannot command my Selfe to Beleeue
what I will, and so no Triall can be made. Nay it is worse;
For whatsoeuer a Man Imagineth doubtingly, or with Feare,
must needs doe hurt, if Imagination haue any Power at all;

For a Man representeth that oftner, that he feareth, than the
contrary.
                  The Helpe therefore is, for a Man to worke by Another, in
whom he may Create Beleefe, and not by Himselfe; Vntill
Himselfe haue found by Experience, that Imagination doth
preuaile; For then Experience worketh in Himselfe Beleefe;
If the Beleefe, that such a Thing shall be, be ioyned with a Beleefe,
that his Imagination may procure it.
                  For Example; I related one time to a Man, that was Curious, and 
Vaine enough in these Things; That I saw a Kinds of Iugler, that had a
Paire of Cards, and would tell a Man what Card he thought. This Pretended
Learned Man told me; It was a Mistaking in Me; For (said he)
it was not the Knowledge of the Mans Thought, (for that is Proper to
God,) but it was the Inforcing of a Thought vpon him, and Binding his
Imagination by a Stronger, that he could Thinke no other Card. And
thereupon he asked me a Question, or two, which I thought he did but
cunningly, knowing before what vsed to be the Feats of the Iugler. Sir,
(said hee,) doe you remember whether he told the Card, the Man thought,
Himselfe, or bade Another to tell it. I answered (as was true;) That be bade
Another tell it. Whereunto he said; so I thought: For (said he) Himselfe
could not haue put on so strong an Imagination; But by telling the other the
Card, (who beleeued that the Iugler was some Strange Man, and could doe
Strange Things,) that other Man caught a strong Imagination. I harkened
vnto him, thinking for a Vanity he spoke prettily. Then he asked me another
Question: Saith he; Doe you remember, whether he had the Man think
the Card first, and afterwards told the other Man in his Eare, what he should
thinke, Or else that he did whisper first in the Mans Eare, that should tell the
Card, telling that such a Man should thinke such a Card, and after bade the
Man thinke a Card? I told him, as was true; That he did first whisper the
Man in the Eare, that such a Man should thinke such a Card: Vpon this the
Learned Man did much Exult, and Please himselfe, saying; Loe, you may
see that my Opinion is right: For if the Man had: thought first, his Thought
had beene Fixed; But the other Imagining first, bound his Thought. Which
though it did somewhat sinke with mee, yet I made it Lighter than I
thought, and said; I thought it was Confederacy, betweene the Iugler,
and the two Seruants: Though (Indeed) I had no Reason so to thinke:
For they were both my Fathers Seruants; And he had neuer plaid in the
House before. The Iugler also did cause a Garter to be held vp; And
tooke vpon him, to know, that such a One, should point in such a Place,
of the Garter; As it should be neare so many Inches to the Longer End,
and so many to the Shorter; And still he did it, by First Telling the Imaginer,
and after Bidding the Actour Thinke.
                  
                  Hauing told this Relation, not for the Weight thereof, but

because it doth handsomely open the Nature of the Question;
I returne to that I said; That Experiments of Imagination, must
be practised by Others, and not by a Mans Selfe. For there be
Three Meanes to fortifie Beleefe: The First is Experience: The
Second is Reason: And the Third is Authoritie: And that of
these, which is farre the most Potent, is Authoritie: For Beleefe
vpon Reason, or Experience, will Stagger.
                  
                      For Authoritie, it is of two Kindes; Beleefe in an Art; And Beleefe
in a Man. And for Things of Beleefe in an Art; A Man may exercise
them by Himselfe; But for Beleefe in a Man, it must be by Another. Therfore,
if a Man beleeue in Astrologie, and finde a Figure Prosperous; Or
beleeue in Naturall Magicke, and that a Ring with such a Stone, or such a
Peece of a Liuing Creature, Carried, will doe good; It may helpe his
Imagination: But the Beleefe in a Man is farre the more Actiue. But howsoeuer,
all Authoritie must be out of a Mans Selfe, turned (as was said,)
either vpon an Art, or vpon a Man: And where Authoritie is from one
Man to another, there the Second must be Ignorant, and not Learned, or
Full of Thoughts; And such are (for the most part) all Witches, and Superstitious
Persons; Whose Beleefes, tied to their Teachers, and Traditions,
are no whit controlled, either by Reason, or Experience: And vpon the
same Reason, in Magicke, they vse (for the most part,) Boyes, and Young
People; whose Spirits easiliest take Beleefe, and Imagination.
                  
                  Now to fortifie Imagination, there be three Wayes: The
Authoritie whence the Beleefe is deriued; Meanes to Quicken
and Corroborate the Imagination; And Meanes to Repeat it,
and Refresh it.
                  
                      For the Authoritie, wee haue already spoken: As for the Second;
Namely the Meanes to Quicken, and Corroborate the Imagination; Wee see
what hath beene vsed in Magicke; (If there be in those Practises any thing
that is purely Naturall;) As Vestments; Characters; Words; Seales;
Some Parts of Plants, or Liuing Creatures; Stones; Choice of the Houre;
Gestures and Motions; Also Incenses, and Odours; Choice of Societie, which
increaseth Imagination; Diets and Preparations for some time before. And
for Words, there haue beene euer vsed, either Barbarous Words, of no
Sense, lest they should disturbe the Imagination; Or Words of Similitude,
that may second and feed the Imagination: And this was euer as well in
Heathen Charmes, as in Charmes of latter Times. There are vsed also
Scripture-Words; For that the Beleefe, that Religious Texts, and Words,
haue Power, may strengthen the Imagination: And for the same Reason,
Hebrew Words, (which amongst vs is counted the Holy Tongue, and the
Words more Mysticall,) are often vsed.
                  
                      For the Refreshing of the Imagination, (which was the Third Meanes
of Exalting it;) Wee see the Practises of Magicke, as in Images of Wax,
                  
                  
                     and the like, that should Melt by little, and little; Or some other Things
Buried in Mucke, that should Putrifie by little and little; Or the like:
For so oft as the Imaginant doth thinke of those Things, so oft doth he
represent to his Imagination, the Effect of that he desireth.
                  If there be any Power in Imagination, it is lesse credible, that it should 
be so Incorporcall and Immateriate a Vertue, as to worke at great Distances;
Or through all Mediums Or vpon all Bodies: But that the Distance must
be Competent; The Medium not Aduerse; And the Body Apt and Proportionate.
Therefore if there be any Operation vpon Bodies, in Absence,
by Nature; it is like to be conueyed from Man to Man, as Fame is;
As if a Witch, by Imagination, should hurt any afarre off, it cannot be
naturally, but by Working vpon the Spirit of some, that commeth to
the Witch; And from that Party vpon the Imagination of Another; And
so vpon Another; till it come to one that hath resort to the Party Intended;
And so by Him to the Party intended himselfe. And although they
speake, that it sufficeth, to take a Point, or a Peece of the Garment, or the
Name of the Party, or the like; yet there is lesse Credit to be giuen to those
Things, except it be by Working of euill Spirits.
                  
                  The Experiments, which may certainly demonstrate the
Power of Imagination, vpon other Bodies, are few, or none:
For the Experiments of Witchcraft, are no cleare Proofes;
For that they may be, by a Tacite Operation of Maligne Spirits:
We shall therefore be forced, in this Enquire, to resort to
New Experiments: Wherein wee can giue only Directions of
Trialls, and not any Positiue Experiments. And if any Man
thinke, that wee ought to haue staied, till wee had made Experiment,
of some of them, our selues, (as wee doe commonly
in other Titles,) the Truth is, that these Effects of Imagination
vpon other Bodies, haue so little Credit with vs, as we
shall trie them at leisure: But in the meane Time, we will lead
others the way.
                  When you worke by the Imagination of Another, it is necessary, that 
He, by whom you worke, haue a Precedent Opinion of you, that you
can doe Strange Things; Or that you are a Man of Art, as they call it;
For else the Simple Affirmation to Another, that this or that shall be, can
worke but a weake Impression, in his Imagination.
                  
                  It were good, because you cannot discerne fully of the Strength of 
                     Imagination, in one Man more than another, that you did vse the Imagination
of more than One; That so you may light vpon a Strong One. As
if a Physitian should tell Three, or Foure, of his Patients Seruants, that
their Master shall surely recouer.
                  The Imagination of One, that you shall vse, (such is the Variety of 
                     Mens Mindes,) cannot be alwaies alike Constant, and Strong; And if the

Successe follow not speedily, it will faint and leese Strength. To remedy
this, you must pretend to Him, whose Imagination you vse, seuerall Degrees
of Meanes, by which to Operate; As to prescribe him, that euery
three Dayes, if he finde not the Successe Apparent, he doe vse another
Root, or Part of a Beast, or Ring, &amp;c. As being of more Force; And if that
faile, Another; And if that, Another; till Seuen Times. Also you must
prescribe a good Large Time for the Effect you promise; As if you
should tell a Seruant of a Sick-Man, that his Master shall recouer, but it
will be Fourteene daies, eare he findeth it apparently, &amp;c. All this to
entertaine the Imagination, that it wauer lesse.
                  
                      It is certaine, that Potions, or Things taken into the Body: Incenses and
Perfumes taken at the Nosthrills; And Ointments of some Parts; doe
(naturally) worke vpon the Imagination of Him that taketh them. And
therefore it must needs greatly Cooperate with the Imagination of him,
whom you vse, if you presribe him, before he doe vse the Receit, for the
Worke which he desireth, that he doe take such a Pill, or a Spoonefull of
Liquour, Or burne such an Incense; Or Annoint his Temples, or the Soles
of his Feet, with such an Ointment, or Oyle: And you must chuse, for the
Composition of such Pill, Perfume, or Ointment, such Ingredients, as doe
make the Spirits, a little more Grosse, or Muddy: Whereby the Imagination will fix the better.
                  
                      The Body Passiue, and to be Wrought Vpon, (I meane not of the Imaginant,)
is better wrought vpon, (as hath beene partly touched,) at some
Times, than at other: As if you should prescribe a Seruant, about a Sick
Person, (whom you haue possessed, that his Master shall recouer,) when
his Master is fast asleepe, to vse such a Root, or such a Root. For Imagination
is like to worke better vpon Sleeping Men, than Men Awake, As wee
shall shew when we handle Dreames.
                  
                  
                      We finde in the Art of Memory, that Images Visible, worke better
than other Conceits: As if you would remember the Word Philosophy,
you shall more surely doe it, by Imagining that such a Man, (For Men are
best Places,) is reading vpon Aristotles Physickes; Than if you should
Imagine him to say; I'le goe study Philosophy. And therefore, this Obseruation
would be translated to the Subiect wee now speake of: For the
more Lustrous the Imagination is, it filleth and fixeth the better. And
therefore I conceiue, that you shall, in that Experiment, (whereof wee
spake before,) of Binding of Thoughts, lesse faile, if you tell One, that such
an One shal name one of Twenty Men, than if it were One of Twenty Cards.
The Experiment of Binding of Thoughts, would be Diuersified, and tried
to the Full: And you are to note, whether it hit for the most part, though
not alwaies.
                  
                      It is good to consider, vpon what Things, Imagination hath most
Force: And the Rule, (as I conceiue,) is, that it hath most Force vpon
Things, that haue the Lightest, and Easiest Motions. And therefore aboue
all, vpon the Spirits of Men: And in them, vpon such Affections, as
moue Lightest; As vpon Procuring of Loue; Binding of Lust, which is

euer with Imagination; vpon Men in Feare; Or Men in Irresolution; And
the like. Whatsoeuer is of this kinde would be throughly enquired. Trialls
likewise would be made vpon Plants. and that diligently: As if you
should tell a Man, that such a Tree would Dye this yeare; And will him,
at these and these times, to goe vnto it, to see how it thriueth. As for
In
                           ••
                        imate Things, it is true, that the Mount of Shuffling of Cards, or Casting
of Dice, are very Light Motions; And there is a Folly very vsuall, that
Gamesters imagine, that some that stand by them, bring them ill Lucke.
There would be Triall also made, of holding a Ring by a Threed in a
Glasse, and telling him that holdeth it, before, that it shall strike so many
times against the Side of the Glasse, and no more; Or of Holding a Key
betweene two Mens Fingers, without a Charme; And to tell those that
hold it, that at such a Name, it shall goe off their Fingers: For these two
are Extreme Light Motions. And howsoeuer I haue no Opinion of these
things, yet so much I conceiue to be true; That Strong Imagination hath
more Force vpon Things Liuing, Or that haue, been Liuing, than Things
meerely Inauimate; And more Force likewise vpon Light, and Subtill
Motions, than vpon Motions Vehement, or P
                           •
                        nderous.
                  
                  It is an vsuall Obseruation, that if the Body of One Murthered, be 
brought before the Murtherer, the Wounds will bleed a-fresh, Some doe
affirme, that the Dead Body, vpon the Presence of the Murtherer, hath
opened the Eyes; And that there haue beene such like Motions, as well
where the Party Murthered hath beene Strengled, or Drew
                           •
                        ed, as where
they haue beene Killed by Wounds, It may be, that this participateth of
a Miracle, by Gods Iust Iudgement, who vsually bringeth Murthers to
Lights But if it be Naturall, it must be referred to Imagination.
                  
                  The Tying of the Point vpon the day of Mariage, to make Men Impotent 
towards their Wiues, which (as we haue formerly touched,) is so
frequent in Zant, and Gascony, if it be Naturall, must be referred to the
Imagination of Him that Tieth the Point. I conceiue it to haue the lesse
Affinity with Witchcraft, because not Peculiar Persons onely, (such as
Witches are,) but any Body may doe it.
                  There be many Things that worke vpon the Spirits of Man, by Secret
Sympathy, and Antipathy; The Vertues of Pretious Stones worne, haue
beene anciently and generally Receiued: And curiously assigned to
Worke seuerall Effects.
                     Experiments in Consort, touching the Secret Vertue of Sympathy, and Antipathy
                      So much is true; That Stones haue in them fine
Spirits; As appeareth by their Splendour: And therefore they may worke
by Consort vpon the Spirits of Men, to Comfort, and Exhilarate them.
Those that are the best, for that Effect, are the Diamond. the Emerald, the
Iacinth Orientall, and the Gold-Stone, which is the Yellow Topaze. As for
their particular Proprieties, there is no Credit to be giuen to them. But
it is manifest, that Light, aboue all things, excelleth in Comforting the Spirits
of Men: And it is very probable, that Light Varied doth the same Effect,
with more Nouelty. And this is one of the Causes, why Pretious
Stones comfort. And therefore it were good to haue Tincted Lanthornes.
                     
or Tincted Skreenes, of Glasse Coloured into Greene, Blew, Carnation, Crimson,
Purple, &amp;c. And to vse them with Candles in the Night. So likewise
to haue Round Glasses, not onely of Glasse Coloured thorow, but with Colours
laid betweene Crystals, with Handles to hold in ones Hand. Prismes
are also Comfortable Things. They haue of Paris-Worke, Looking-Glasses,
bordered with broad Borders of small Crystall, and great Counterfete
Pretious Stones, of all Colours, that are most Glorious and Pleasant to behold;
Especially in the Night. The Pictures of Indian Feathers, are likewise
Comfortable, and Pleasant to behold. So also Faire and Cleare
Pooles doe greatly comfort the Eyes, and Spirits; Especially when the
Sunne is not Glaring, but Ouercast; Or when the Moone shineth.
                  
                      There be diuers Sorts of Bracelets fit to Comfort the Spirits; And they
be of Three Intentions: Refrigerant; Corroborant; and Aperient. For Refrigerant,
I wish them to be of Pearle, or of Corall, as is vsed: And it hath
beene noted that Corall, if the Party that weareth it be ill disposed, will
wax Pale: Which I beleeue to be true, because otherwise Distemper of
Heat will make Corall lose Colour. I Commend also Beads, or little Plates
of Lapis Lazuli; And Beads of Nitre, either alone, or with some Cordiall
Mixture.
                  
                  
                      For Corroboration and Confortation, take such Bodies as are of Astringent
Quality, without Manifest Cold. I commend Bead-Amber; which is
full of Astriction, but yet is Vnctuous, and not Cold; And is conceiued to
Impinguate those that weare such Beads: I commend also, Beads of HartsHorne,
and Iuory, which are of the like Nature; Also Orenge-Beads; Also
Beads of Lignum Aloës, Macerated first in Rose-Water, and Dryed.
                  
                  
                      For Opening, I Commend Beads, or Peeces of the Roots of Cardius Benedictus:
Also of the Roots of Piony the Male; And of Orris; And of Calamus
Aromaticus; And of Rew.
                  
                  
                      The Crampe, (no doubt,) commeth of Contraction of Sinnewes;
Which is Manifest, in that it commeth either by Cold, or Drinesse; As after
Consumptions, and Long Agues: For Cold and Drinesse doe (both of
them)
Contract, and Corrugate. We see also, that Chasing a little aboue
the Place in paine, easeth the Crampe; Which is wrought by the Dilatation,
of the Contracted Sinnewes, by Heat. There are in vse, for the Preuention
of the Crampe, two Things; The one Rings of Sea Horse Teeth, worne
vpon the Fingers; The other Bands of Greene Periwinckle, (the Herbe,) tied
about the Calfe of the Leg, or the Thigh, &amp;c. where the Crampe vseth to
come. I doe finde this the more strange, because Neither of these haue
any Relaxing Vertue, but rather the Contrary. I iudge therefore, that their
Working, is rather vpon the Spirits, within the Nerues, to make them striue
lesse; Than vpon the Bodily Substance of the Nerues.
                  
                  
                      I would haue Triall made of two other Kindes of Bracelets, for Comforting the Heart, and Spirits; The one of the Trechisch of Vipers, made into
little Peeces of Beads; For since they doe great Good Inwards, (especially
for Pestilent Agues, it is like they will be Effectuall Outwards; Where
they may be applied in greater Quantity. There would be Trochish likewise

made of Snakes; Whose Flesh dried, is thought to haue a very Opening,
and Cordiall Vertue. The other is, of Beads made of the Scarlet Powder,
which they call Kermes; Which is the Principall Ingredient in their Cordiall
Confection Alkermes: The Beads would be made vp with AmberGrice,
and some Pomander.
                  
                  It hath beene long receiued, and confirmed by diuers Trialls; That 
the Root of the Male-Piony, dried, tied to the Necke, doth helpe the Falling-Sicknesse;
And likewise the Incubus, which wee call the Mare. The
Cause of both these Diseases, and especially of the Epilepsie from the Stomach,
is the Grossenesse of the Vapours, which rise and enter into the Cells
of the Braine: And therfore the Working is, by Extreme, and Subtill Attenuations; Which that Simple hath. I iudge the like to be in Castoreum,
Muske, Rew-Seed, Agnus Castus Seed, &amp;c.
                  There is a Stone, which they call the Bloud-Stone, which worne is 
thought to be good for them that Bleed at the Nose: Which (no doubt)
is by Astriction, and Cooling of the Spirits. Quare, if the Stone taken out
of the Toads Head, be not of the like Vertue? For the Toade loueth Shade,
and Coolenesse.
                  
                     Light may be taken from the Experiment of the Horse-Tooth-Ring,
                     
and the Garland of Periwinckle, how that those things, which asswage
the Strife of the Spirits, doe helpe diseases, contrary to the Intention desired:
For in the Curing of the Crampe, the Intention is to relax the Sinnewes;
But the Contraction of the Spirits, that they striue lesse, is the best
Helpe: So to procure easie Tranailes of Women, the Intention is to bring
downe the Childe; But the best Helpe is, to stay the Comming downe too
Fast: Whereunto they say, the Toad-Stone likewise helpeth. So in Pestilent
Feaners, the Intention is to expell the Intection by Sweat, and Enapouration; But the best Meanes to doe it, is by Nitre, Diascordium, and other
Coole Things, which doe for a time arrest the Expulsion, till Nature
can doe it more quietly. For as one faith prettily; In the Quenching of
the Flame of a Pestilent Ague, Nature is like People, that come to quench the
Fire of a House; which are so busie, as one of them letteth another. Surely, it
is an Excellent Axiome, and of Manifold Vse, that whasoeuer appeaseth
the Contention of the Spirits, furthereth their Action.
                  
                  The Writers of Naturall Magick, commend the Wearing of the Spoile
                     
of a Snake, for Preseruing of Health; I doubt it is but a Conceit; For that
the Snake is thought to renue her Touth, by Casting her Spoile. They
might as well take the Beake of an Eagle, or a Peece of a Harts-Horne, because those Renue.
                  It hath beene Anciently Receiued, (For Pericles the Athenian vsed it,)
and it is yet in vse, to weare little Bladders of Quick-Siluer, or Tablets of
Arsenicke, as Preseruatines against the Plague: Not as they conceiue, for
any Comfort they yeeld to the Spirits, but for that being Poysons themselues,
they draw the Venome to them, from the Spirits.
                  
                  
                     Vide the Experiments 95.96. and 97. touching the Seuerall Sympathies,
                     
and Antipathies, for Medicinall Vse.
                  
                  
                     
                      It is said, that the Guts or Skin of a Wolfe being applyed to the Belly,
doe cure the Cholicke. It is true, that the Wolfe is a Beast of great Edacity, and Disgestion; And so, it may be, the Parts of him comfort the
Bowels.
                  
                  
                      We see Scare-Crowes, are set vp to keep Birds from Corne, and Fruit;
It is reported by some, that the Head of a Wolfe, whole, dried, and hanged
vp in a Done-House, will scare away Vermine; Such as are Weasils, Polcats,
and the like. It may be, the Head of a Dog will doe as much; For
those Vermine with vs, know Dogs better than Wolues.
                  
                  
                      The Braines of some Creatures, (when their Heads are roasted) taken
in Wine, are said to strengthen the Memory: As the Braines of Hares;
Braines of Hens; Braines of Deeres, &amp;c. And it seemeth, to be incident
to the Braines of those Creatures, that are Fearefull.
                  
                      The Ointment, that Witches vse, is reported to be made, of the Fat of
Children, digged out of their Granes; Of the Iuyees of Smallage, Wolfebane,
and Cinquefoile; Mingled with the Meale of fine Wheat. But I suppose
that the Soperiferous Medicines are likest to doe it; Which are Henbane,
Hemlocke, Mandrake, Moone-Shade, Tabacco, Opium, Saffron, PoplarLeaues, &amp;c.
                  
                      It is reported by some, that the Affections of Beasts, when they are
in Strength, doe adde some Vertue, vnto Inanimate Things; As that the
Skin of a Sheepe, deuoured by a Wolfe, moueth Itching; That a Stone, bitten
by a Dog in Anger, being throwne at him, drunke in Powder, prouoketh Choler.
                  
                  
                      It hath beene obserued, that the Diet of Women with Childe, doth
worke much vpon the Infant; As if the Mother eat Quinces much, and
Coriander-Seed, (the Nature of both which is to represse and stay Vapours,
that ascend to the Braine,) it will make the Childe Ingenious: And on
the contrary side, if the Mother eat (much) Onions, or Beanes, or such Vapourous
Food; Or drinke Wine, or Strong Drinke, immoderately; Or Fast
much; Or be giuen to much Musing; (All which send, or draw Vapours
to the Head,) It endangereth the Childe to become Lunaticke, or of Ionperfect
Memory: And I make the same Iudgement of Tobacco, often taken
by the Mother.
                  
                  
                      The Writers of Naturall Magicke report, that the Heart of an Ape, worne
neare the Heart, comforteth the Heart, and increaseth Audacity. It is
true, that the Ape is a Merry and Bold Beast. And that the same Heart
likewise of an Ape, applied to the Necke, or Head, helpeth the Wit; And
is good for the Falling-Sicknesse: The Ape also is a Witty Beast, and hath
a Dry Braine; Which may be some Cause of Attenuation of Vapours in the
Head. Yet it is said to moue Dreames also. It may be, the Heart of a Man
would doe more, but that is more against Mens Mindes to vse it; Except
it be in such as weare the Reliques of Saints.
                  
                  
                      The Flesh of a Hedge-Hog, Dressed, &amp; Eaten, is said to be a great Drier:
It is true, that the Iuyce of a Hedge-Hog, must needs be Harsh, and Dry, because
it putteth forth so many Prickles: For Plants also, that are full of

                     Prickles, are generally Dry: As Briars, Thornes, Berberries: And therefore
the Ashes of a Hedge-Hog are said to be a great Desiccatiue of Fistula's.
                  
                  
                     Mummy hath great force in Stanching of Bloud; which, as it may be 
ascribed to the Mixture of Balmes, that are Glutinous; So it may also partake
of a Secret Propriety; In that the Bloud draweth Mans Flesh. And it
is approued, that the Mosse, which groweth vpon the Skull of a Dead
Men, vnburied, will stanch Bloud potently. And so doe the Dregs, or
Powder of Bloud, seuered from the Water, and
Dried.
                  
                  It hath beene practised, to make White Swallowes, by Annointing of 
the Egs with Oyle. Which Effect may be produced, by the Stopping of the
Pores of the Shell, and making the Iuyce, that putteth forth the Feathers
afterwards, more Penurious. And it may be, the Annointing of the Egs,
will be as Effectuall, as the Annointing of the Body; Of which Vide the
Experiment 93.
                  
                  It is reported, that the White of an Egge, or Bloud, mingled with 
                     Salt-Water, doth gather the Saltnesse, and maketh the Water sweeter. This
may be by Adhesion; As in the 6. Experiment of Clarification: It may be
also, that Bloud, and the White of an Egge, (which is the Malter of a Liuing
Creature,) haue some Sympathy with Salt: For all Life hath a Sympathy
with Salt. We see that Salt, laid to a Cut Finger, healeth it; So as it
seemeth Salt draweth Bloud, as well as Bloud draweth Salt.
                  
                  It hath beene anciently receiued, that the Sea-Hare, hath an Antipathy
                     
with the Lungs, (if it commeth neare the Body,) and erodeth them.
Where of the Cause is conceiued to be, a Quality it hath of Heating the
Brath, and Spirits; As Cantharides haue vpon the Watery Parts of the Body;

                      conclude vpon them. I would haue it first throughly
inquired, whether there be any Secret Passages of Sympathy, betweene

                     Persons of neare Bloud; As Parents, Children, Brothers, Sisters, NurseChildren,
Husbands, Wiues, &amp;c. There be many Reports in Historie, that
vpon the Death of Persons of such Nearenesse, Men haue had an inward
Feeling of it. I my Selfe remember, that being in Paris, and my Father
dying in London, two or three dayes before my Fathers death, I had a
Dreame, which I told to diuers English Gentlemen; That my Fathers
House, in the Countrey, was Plastered all ouer with Blacke Mortar. There
is an Opinion abroad, (whether Idle or no I cannot say,) That louing
and kinde Husbands, haue a Sense of their Wiues Breeding Childe, by some
Accident in their owne Body.
                  
                  
                      Next to those that are Neare in Bloud, there may be the like Passage,
and Instincts of Nature, betweene great Friends, and Enemies: And
sometimes the Reucaling is vnto Another Person, and not to the Party
Himselfe. I remember Philippus Commineus, (a graue Writer,) reporteth;
That the Arch-Bishop of Vienna, (a Reuerend l'relate,) said (one
day) after Masse, to King Lewis the eleuenth of France; Sir, your Mortall
Enemie is dead; What time Duke Charles of Burgundie was Slaine, at the
Battell of Granson, against the Switzers. Some triall also would be made,
whether Pact or Agreement doe any thing; As if two Friends should
agree, that such a Day in euery Weeke, they being in farre Distant Places,
should Pray one for Another; Or should put on a Ring, or Tablet, one
for anothers Sake; Whether if one of them should breake their Vow and
Promise, the other should haue any Feeling of it, in Absence.
                  
                  
                      If there be any Force in Imaginations and Affections of Singular Persons;
It is Probable the Force is much more in the Ioynt Imaginations and
Affections of Multitudes: As if a Victorie should be won, or lost, in Remote
Parts, whether is there not some Sense thereof, in the People whom
it concerneth; Because of the great Ioy, or Griefe, that many Men are
prossest with, at once? Pius Quintus, at the very time, when that Memorable
Victorie was won, by the Christians, against the Turks, at the
Nauall Battell of Lepanto, being then hearing of Causes in Consistorie,
brake off suddenly, and said to those about him; It is now more time, we
should giue thanks to God, for the great Victorie he hath granted vs, against
the Turks. It is true, that Victorie had a Sympathie with his Spirit; For
it was meerely his Worke, to conclude that League. It may be, that
Reuelation was Diuine; But what shall wee say then, to a Number of
Examples, amongst the Grecians, and Romans? Where the People, being
in Theaters at Playes, haue had Newes of Victories, and Ouerthrowes, some
few dayes, before any Messenger could come.
                  It is true, that that may hold in these Things, which is
the generall Root of Superstition; Namely, that Men obserue
when Things Hit, and not when they Misse: And commit
to Memory the one, And forget and passe ouer the other.
But touching Diuination, and the Misgiuing of Mindes, wee

shall speake more, when wee handle in generall, the Nature
of Mindes, and Soules, and Spirits.
                  
                  Wee haue giuen formerly some Rules of Imgination; And touching 
the Fortifying of the Same. Wee haue set downe also some few Instances,
and Directions, of the Force of Imagination, vpon Beasts, Birds, &amp;c. vpon
Plants; And vpon Inanimate Bodies: Wherein you must still obserue,
that your Trialls be vpon Subtill and Light Motions, and not the contrary;
For you will sooner, by Imagination, binde a Bird from Singing,
than from Eating, or Flying: And I leaue it to euery Man, to
choose Experiments, which himself thinketh most Commodious; Giuing
now but a few Examples of euery of the Three Kindes.
                  Vse some Imaginant, (obseruing the Rules formerly prescribed,) for 
                     Binding of a Bird from Singing; And the like of a Dogge from Barking.
Trie also the Imagination of some, whom you shall accommodate with
things to fortifie it, in Cocke-Fights, to make one Cocke more Hardy, and
the other more Cowardly. It would be tried also, in Flying of Hawkes;
Or in Coursing of a Deere, or Hare, with Grey-hounds; Or in Horse-Races;
And the like Comparatiue Motions: For you may sooner by Imagination,
quicken or slacke a Motion, than raise or cease it; As it is easier to make
a Dogge goe slower, than to make him stand still that he may not run.
                  In Plants also, you may trie the Force of Imagination, vpon the 
                     Lighter Sort of Motions: As vpon the Sudden Fading, or Liuely Comming
vp of Herbs; Or vpon their Bending one way, or other; Or vpon their
Closing, and Opening; &amp;c.
                  For Inanimate Things, you may trie the Force of Imagination, vpon 
Staying the Working of Beere, when the Barme is put in; Or vpon the
Comming of Butter, or Cheese, after the Cherming, or the Rennet bee
put in.
                  It is an Ancient Tradition, euery where alleaged, for Example of Secret 
Proprieties and Influxes, that the Torpede Marina, if it be touched
with a long Stick, doth stupefie the Hand of him that toucheth it. It is
one degree of Working at Distance, to worke by the Continuance of a
Fit Medium; As Sound will be conueyed to the Eare, by striking vpon a
Bow-String, if the Horne of the Bow be held to the Eare.
                  
                  The Writers of Naturall Magicke, doe attribute much to the Vertues,
                     
that come from the Parts of Liuing Creatures; So as they be taken from
them, the Creatures remaining still aliue: As if the Creature still liuing
did infuse some Immateriate Vertue, and Vigour, into the Part Seuered. So
much may be true; that any Part, taken from a Liuing Creature, newly
Slaine, may be of greater force, than if it were taken from the like Creature
dying of it Selfe, because it is fuller of Spirit.
                  
                  Triall would be made, of the like Parts of Indiuidualls, in Plants, and 
                     Liuing Creatures; As to cut off a Stocke of a tree; And to lay that, whith
you cut off, to Putrifie, to see whether it will Decay the Rest of the
Stocke: Or if you should cut off part off the Taile, or Legge of a Dogge,
                     
or a Cat, and lay it to Putrifie, and so see whether it will Fester, or keepe
from Healing, the Part which remaineth.
                  
                      It is receiued, that it helpeth to Continue Loue, if one weare a Ring,
or a Bracelet, of the Haire of the Party Beloued. But that may be by the
Exciting of the Imagination: And perhaps a Gloue, or other like Fauour,
may as well doe it.
                  
                      The Sympathie of Indiuiduals, that haue beene Entire, or haue Touched,
is of all others the most Incredible: Yet according vnto our faithfull
Manner of Examination of Nature, wee will make some little mention
of it. The Taking away of Warts, by Rubbing them with Somewhat that
afterwards is put to waste, and consume, is a Common Experiment: And
I doe apprehend it the rather, because of mine owne Experience. I had,
from my Childhood, a Warts, vpon one of my Fingers: Afterwards when
I was about Sixteene Yeeres old, being then at Paris, there grew vpon
both my Hands a Number of Warts, (at the least an hundred,) in a
Moneths Space. The English Embassadours Lady, who was a Woman farre
from Superstition, told me, one day; She would helpe me away with
my Warts: Whereupon she got a Peece of Lard, with the Skin on, and
rubbed the Warts all ouer, with the Fat Side; And amongst the rest that
Wart, which I had had from my Childhood; Then she uailed the Peece of
Lord, with the Fat towards the Sunne, vpon a Poast of her Chamber Window,
which was to the South, The Successe was, that within fiue weekes
space, all the Warts went quite away: And that Wart, which I had so
long endured, for Company. But at the rest I did little maruell, because
they came in a Short time, and might goe away in a Short Time againe:
But the Going away of that, which had staid so long, doth yet sticke
with mee. They say the like is done, by the Rubbing of Warts with a
Greene Elder Sticke, and then Burying the Sticke to Rot in Mucke. It
would be tried, with Cornes, and Wenns, and such other Excrescences.
I would haue it also tried, with some Parts of Liuing Creatures, that are
nearest the Nature of Excrescences; As the Combes of Cocks, the Spurres
of Cocks, the Hornes of Beasts, &amp;c. And I would haue it tried both
wnyes; Both by Rubbing those Parts with Lord, or Elder, as before;
And by Cutting off some Peece of those Parts, and laying it to Consume;
To see whether it will Worke any Effect, towards the Consumption of
that Part, which was once Ioyned with it.
                  
                      It is constantly Receiued, and touched, that the Anointing of the
Weapon, than maketh the Wound, will heale the Wound it selfe. In this Experiment, vpon the Relation of Men of Credit, (though my selfe, as yet,
am not fully inclined to beleoue it,) you shall note the Points following.
First the Ointment, wherewith this is done, is made of Diuers Ingredients;
whereof the Strangest and Hardest to come by, are the Mosse vpon
the Skull of a dead Men, Vnburied; And the Fats of a Beare, and a Beare,
killed in the Act of Generation. These two last I could easily suspect to be
prescribed at a Starting Hole; That if the Experiment proued not, it
mouight be pretended, that the Beasts were not killed in the due Time;

For as for the Mosse, it is certaine, there is great Quantitie of it in Ireland,
vpon Slaine Bodies, laid on Heaps, Vnburied. The other Ingredients are,
the Bloud-Stone in Powder, and some other Things, which seeme to haue
a Vertue to Stanch Bloud; As also the Mosse hath. And the Description
of the Whole Ointment is to be found in the Chymicall Dispensatorie of
Crollius. Secondly, the same Kinde of Ointment, applied to the Hurt it
selfe, worketh not the Effect; but only applied to the Weapon. Thirdly,
(which I like well) they doe not obserue the Confecting of the Ointment,
vnder any certaine Constellation; which commonly is the Excuse of Magicall Medicines, when they faile, that they were not made vnder a fit
Figure of Heauen. Fourthly, it may be applied to the Weapon, though
the Party Hurt be at great Distance. Fifthly, it seemeth the Imagination of
the Party, to be Cured, is not needfull to Concurre; For it may be
done, without the Knowledge, of the Party Wounded; And thus much
hath beene tried, that the Ointment (for Experiments sake,) hath beene
wiped off the Weapon, without the knowledge of the Party Hurt, and
presently the Party Hurt, hath beene in great Rage of Paine, till the Weapon was Reannointed. Sixthly, it is affirmed, that if you cannot get the
Weapon, yet if you put an Instrument of Iron, or Wood, resembling the
Weapon, into the Wound, whereby it bleedeth, the Annointing of that
Instrument will serue, and worke the Effect. This I doubt should be a
Deuice, to keepe this strange Forms of Cure, in Request, and Vse; Because
many times you cannot come by the Weapon it selfe. Seuenthly,
the Wound must be at first Washed cleans, with White Wine, or the Parties
owne Water; And then bound vp close in Fine Linnen, and no more
Dressing renewed, till it be whole. Eighthly, the Sword it selfe must be
Wrapped vp Close, as farre as the Ointment goeth, that it taketh no Wind.
Ninthly, the Ointment, if you wipe it off from the Sword, and keepe it,
will Serue againe; and rather Increase in Vertue, than Diminish. Tenthly,
it will Cure in farte Shorter Time, than Ointments of Wounds commonly
doe. Lastly, it will Cure a Beast, as well as a Man; which I like best of
all the rest, because it subiecteth the Matter, to an Easie Triall.
                  
                  I would haue Men know, that though I reprehend, the Easie Passing
ouer, of the Causes of Things, by Ascribing them to Secret and Hidden
Vertues, and Proprieties; (For this hath arrested, and laid asleepe, all
true Enquiry, and Indications;) yet I doe not vnderstand, but that in the 
                     Practicall Part of Knowledge, much will be left to Experience, and Probation,
whereunto Indication cannot so fully reach: And this not onely in
Specie, but in Indiuiduo.
                     Experiment Solitary touching Secret Proprieties.
                      So in Physicke, if you will cure the Iaundies, it is
not enough to say, that the Medicine must not be Cooling; For that will
hinder the Opening which the Disease requireth: That it must not be Hot;
For that will exasperate Choler: That it must goe to the Gall; For there
is the Obstruction which causeth the Disease, &amp;c. But you must receiue
from Experience, that Powder of Chamapytis, or the like, drunke in Beere,
is good for the Iaundies: So againe, a wise Physitian doth not continue

still the same Medicine, to a Patient; But he will vary, if the first Medicine
doth not apparently succeed; For of those Remedies, that are good for
the Iaundies, Stone, Agues, &amp;c. that will doe good in one Body, which
will not doe good in Another; According to the Correspondence the
Medicine hath to the Indiuduall Body.
                  
                  The Delight which Men haue in Popularity, Fame, Honour, Submission,
and Subiection of other Mens Mindes, Wills, or Affections, (although these
Things may be desired for other Ends,) seemeth to be a Thing, in it selfe,
without Contemplation of Consequence, Gratefull &amp; agreeable to the

                     Nature of Man.
                     Experiment Solitary, touching the Generall Sympathy of Mens Spirits.
                      This Thing (surely) is not without some Signification,
as if all Spirits and Soules of Men, came forth out of one Diuine Limbus;
Else why should Men be so much affected with that, which others
thinke, or say? The best Temper of Mindes desireth Good
Name, and True Honour: The Lighter, Popularity, and
Applause; The more depraued, Subiection, and Tyranny;
As is seene in great Conquerours, and
Troublers of the World: And yet more in
Arch-Heretickes; for the Introducing
of new Doctrines, is likewise
an Affectation of Tyranny,
ouer the Vnderstandings,
and
Beleefes of
Men.

                  To the Reader.
                  THis Fable my Lord deuised, to the
end that He might exhibite therein,
a Modell or Description of a
Colledge, instituted for the Interpreting
of Nature, and the Producing
of Great and Marueilous Works for the
Benefit of Men; Vnder the Name of Salomons
House, or the Colledge of the Sixe Dayes Works.
And euen so farre his Lordship hath proceeded,
us to finish that Part. Certainely, the Modell is
more Vast, and High, then can possibly be imitated
in all things; Notwithstanding most Things
therin are within Mens Power to effect. His
Lordship thought also in this present Fable, to
haue composed a Frame of Lawes, or of the best
State or Mould of a Common-wealth; But foreseeing
it would be a long VVorke, his Desire of
Collecting the Naturall History diuerted him,
which He preferred many degrees before it.
                  This VVorke of the New Atlantis (as

much as concerneth the English Edition) his Lordship
designed for this Place; In regard it hath so
neare Affinity (in one Part of it) with the Preceding
Naturall History.

                  NEW ATLANTIS.
                  WEE sayled from Peru, (wher wee had continued
by the space of one whole yeare,)
for China and Iapan, by the South Sea; taking
with vs Victuals for twelue Moneths;
And had good Windes from the
East, though soft and weake, for fiue Moneths
space, and more. But then the Winde
came about, and setled in the West for many dayes, so as we
could make little or no way, and were sometimes in purpose
to turne back. But then againe ther arose Strong and
Great Windes from the South, with a Point East; which
carried vs vp, (for all that we could doe) towards the North:
By which time our Victualls failed vs, though we had made
good spare of them. So that finding our selues, in the
Midst of the greatest Wildernesse of Waters in the World,
without Victuall, we gaue our Selues for lost Men, and
prepared for Death. Yet we did lift vp our Harts and
Voices to GOD aboue, who sheweth his Wonders in the
Deepe; Beseeching him of his Mercy, that as in the Beginning
He discouered the Face of the Deepe, and brought forth
Dry-Land; So he would now discouer Land to vs, that we
mought not perish. And it came to passe, that the next Day
about Euening, we saw within a Kenning before vs, towards
the North, as it were thick Cloudes, which did put
vs in some hope of Land; Knowing how that part of the
South Sea was vtterly vnknowne; And might haue Islands,
or Continents, that hithertoo were not come to light.
                  
                     Wherefore we bent our Course thither, wher we saw the
Appearance of Land, all that night; And in the Dawning of
the next Day, we might plainly discerne that it was a Land;
Flatt to our sight, and full of Boscage; which made it shew
the more Darke, And after an Houre and a halfs Sayling, we
entred into a good Hauen, being the Port of a faire Citty;
Not great indeed, but well built, and that gaue a pleasant
view from the Sea: And we thinking euery Minute long, till
we were on Land, came close to the Shore, and offred to
land. But straightwayes we saw diuers of the People, with
Bastons in their Hands, (as it were) forbidding vs to land;
Yet without any Cries or Fiercenesse, but onely as warning
vs off, by Signes that they made. Wherevpon being not a little
discomforted, we were aduising with our selues, what
we should doe. During which time, ther made forth to vs
a small Boate, with about eight Persons in it; wherof One
of them had in his Hand a Tipstaffe of a yellow Cane, tipped
at both ends with Blew, who came aboard our Shipp,
without any shew of Distrust at all. And when he saw one
of our Number, present himselfe somewhat afore the rest,
he drew forth a little Scroule of Parchment, (somewhat
yellower then our Parchment, and shining like the Leaues
of Writing Tables, but otherwise soft and flexible,) and deliuered
it to our foremost Man. In which Scroule were written
in Ancient Hebrew, and in Ancient Greeke, and in good
Latine of the Schoole, and in Spanish, these wordes; Land yee
not, none of you; And prouide to be gone, from this Coast, within sixteene
daies, except you haue further time giuen you. Meanewhile, if
you want Fresh Water, or Victuall, or helpe for your Sick, or that
your Ship needeth repaire, write downe your wants, and you shall
haue that, which belongeth to Mercy. This Scroule was Signed
with a Stampe of Cherubins Wings, not spred, but hanging
downwards; And by them a Crosse. This being deliuered,
the Officer returned, and left onely a Seruant with vs to receyue
our Answeare. Consulting hereupon amongst our
Selues, we were much perplexed. The Deniall of Landing,
&amp; Hasty Warning vs away, troubled vs much; On the otherside,

to finde that the People had Languages, and were so
full of Humanity, did comfort vs not a little. And aboue all,
the Signe of the Crosse to that Instrument, was to vs a great
Reioycing, and as it were a certaine Presage of Good. Our
Answer was in the Spanish tongue; That for our Shipp, it
was well; For we had rather mett with Clames, and contrary
windes, then any Tempests. For our Sick, they were many, and in
very ill Case; So that if they were not permitted to Land, they ran
danger of their Liues. Our other Wants we sett downe in
particular, adding; That we had some little store of Merchandize,
which if it pleased them to deale for, it might supply our Wants,
without being chargeable vnto them. We offred some Reward
in Pistoletts vnto the Seruant, and a peece of Crimson Veluett
to be presented to the Officer: But the Seruant tooke
them not, nor would scarce looke vpon them; And so left
vs, and went back in another little Boate, which was sent
for him.
                  About three Houres after we had dispatched our Answear,
ther came towards vs, a Person (as it seemed) of
place. He had on him a Gowne with wide Sleeues, of a
kinde of Water Chamolett, of an excellent Azure Colour,
farre more glossy then ours: His vnder Apparell was Green;
And so was his Hatt, being in the forme of a Turban, daintely
made, and not so huge as the Turkish Turbans; And
the Lockes of his Haire came downe below the Brimms
of it. A Reuerend Man was he to behold. Hee came in a
Boate, gilt in some part of it, with foure Persons more onely
in that Boate; And was followed by another Boate,
wherein were some Twenty. When he was come within
a Flight-shott of our Shipp, Signes were made to vs, that
we should send forth some to meet him vpon the Water;
which we presently did in our Shipp-Boate, sending the
principall Man amongst vs saue one, and foure of our Number
with him. When we were come within sixe yards of
their Boate, they called to vs to stay, and not to approach
further; which we did. And therupon the Man, whom I
before described, stood vp, and with a loud voice, in Spanish,
                     
asked; Are yee Christians? We answered; We were; fearing
the lesse, because of the Crosse we had seen in the Subscription.
At which Answear the said Person lift vp his
Right Hand towards Heauen, and drew it softly to his
Mouth, (which is the Gesture they vse, when they thank
GOD;) And then said: If yee will sweare, (all of you,) by the Meritts
of the SAVIOVR, that yee are no Pirates; Nor haue shed
bloud, lawfully, nor vnlawfully, within fourtie daies past; you may
haue License to come on Land. Wee said; Wee were all ready to
take that Oath. Wherupon one of those that were with him,
being (as it seemed) a Notary, made an Entry of this Act.
Which done, another of the Attendants of the Great Person,
which was with him in the same Boate, after his Lord
had spoken a little to him, said aloud; My Lord would haue
you know, that it is not of Pride, or Greatnes, that 
                           •
                        e commeth not
aboard your Shipp; But for that, in your Answear, your declare,
that you haue many Sick amongst you, he was warned by the Conseruatour
of Health, of the Citty, that he should keepe a distance.
We bowed our selues towards him, and answered; Wee
were his humble Seruants; And accounted for great Honour, and
singular Humanity towards vs, that which was allready done;
But hoped well, that the Nature, of the Sicknes, of our Men, was
not infectious. Sc he returned; And a while after came the
Notary to vs aboard our Ship; Holding in his hand a Fruit
of that Cuntry, like an Orenge, but of colour between
Orenge tawney and Scarlett; which cast a most excellent
Odour. He vsed it (as it seemeth) for a Preseruatiue against
Infection. He gaue vs our Oath; By the Name of Iesus, and his
Merits: And after told vs, that the next day, by sixe of the
Clocke, in the Morning, we should be sent to, and brought
to the Strangers House, (so he called it,) wher we should be
accommodated of things, both for our VVhole, and for our
Sick So he left vs; And when we offred him some Pistoletts
he smiling said; He must not be twice paid, for one Labour:
Meaning (as I take it) that he had Salary sufficient of the
State for his Seruice. For (as I after learned) they call an Officer,
that taketh Rewards, Twice-paid.
                  
                  
                     The next Morning earely, ther came to vs the same Officer,
that came to vs at first with his Cane, and told vs; He
came to conduct vs to the Strangers House; And that hee had
preuented the Houre, because we might haue the whole day before
vs, for our Businesse. For (said he) If you will follow my Aduice
ther shall first goe with me some few of you, and see the
place, and how it may be made conuenient for you; And then you
may send for your Sick, and the rest of your Number, which yee
will bring on Land. We thanked him, and said; That this
Care, which he tooke of desolate Strangers, GOD would reward.
And so sixe of vs went on Land with him: And when we
were on Land, he went before vs, and turned to vs, and
said; He was but our Seruant, and our Guide. Hee ledd vs
through three faire Streets; And all the way we went,
ther were gathered some People on both sides, standing in
2 Rowe; But in so ciuill a fashion, as if it had beene, not
to wonder at vs, but to welcome vs: And diuers of them,
as we passed by them, put their Armes a little abroad;
which is their Gesture, when they bid any welcome. The
Strangers House is a faire and spacious House, built of Brick,
of somewhat a blewer Colour then our Brick; And with
handsome windowes, some of Glasse, some of a kinde of
Cambrick oyl'd. He brought vs first into a faire Parlour
aboue staires, and then asked vs; What Number of Persons
we were? And how many sick? We answered, We were in all,
(sick and whole,) one and fifty Persons, whereof our sick were
seuenteene. He desired vs to haue patience a little, and to stay
till he came back to vs; which was about an Houre after;
And then hee led vs to see the Chambers, which were
prouided for vs, being in number nineteene. They hauing
cast it (as it seemeth) that foure of those Chambers, which
were better then the rest, might receiue foure of the principall
Men of our Company; And lodge them alone by
themselues; And the other 15. Chambers were to lodge vs
two and two together. The Chambers were handsome
and cheerefull Chambers, and furnished ciuilly. Then
he ledd vs to a long Gallery, like a Dorture, where hee

shewed vs all along the one side (for the other side was
but VVall and VVindow,) seuenteene Cells, very neat
ones, hauing partitions of Cedar wood. VVhich Gallery,
and Cells, being in all fourty, (many more then we needed,)
were instituted as an Infirmary for sick Persons. And he
told vs withall, that as any of our Sick waxed well, he might
be remoued from his Cell, to a Chamber: For which purpose,
there were sett forth ten spare Chambers, besides the
Number we spake of before. This done, he brought vs
back to the Parlour, and lifting vp his Cane a little, (as they
doe when they giue any Charge or Commaund) said to vs;
Yee are to know, that the Custome of the Land requireth, that after
this day, and too morrow, (which we giue you for remouing of your
people from your Ship,) you are to keepe within dores for three daies.
But lett it not trouble you, nor doe not think your selues restrained,
but rather left to your Rest and Ease. You shall want nothing, and
there are sixe of our People appointed to attend you, for any Busines
you may haue abroad. VVee gaue him thankes, with all Affection
and Respect, and said; GOD surely is manifested in
this Land. VVee offred him also twenty Pistoletts; But he
smiled, and onely saide; What? twice paid! And so he left vs.
Soone after our Dinner was serued in; VVhich was right
good Viands, both for Bread, and Meate: Better then any
Collegiate Diett, that I haue knowne in Europe. VVe had also
Drinke of three sorts, all wholesome and good; VVine of
the Grape; A Drink of Graine, such as is with vs our Ale,
but more cleare: And a kinde of Sider made of a Fruit of
that Cuntry; A wonderfull pleasing and Refreshing Drink.
Besides, ther were brought in to vs, great store of those Scarlett
Orenges, for our Sick; which (they said) were an assured
Remedy for sicknes taken at Sea. Ther was giuen vs also, a
Boxe of small gray, or whitish Pills, which they wished
our Sicke should take, one of the Pills, euery night before
sleepe; which (they said) would hasten their Recouery.
The next day, after that our Trouble of Carriage, and Remouing
of our Men, and Goods, out of our Shipp, was
somewhat setled and quiett, I thought good to call our

Company together, and when they were assembled, said
vnto them; My deare Frends; Let vs know our selues, and
how it standeth with vs. We are Men cast on Land, as Ionas
was, out of the Whales Belly, when we were as buried in the
Deepe: And now we are on Land, wee are but between Death
and Life; For we are beyond, both the Old World, and the New;
And whether euer wee shall see Europe, GOD onely knoweth.
It is a kinde of Miracle hath brought vs hither: And it must bee
little lesse, that shall bring vs hence. Therefore in regard of
our Deliuerance past, and our danger present, and to come, let
vs looke vp to GOD, and euery man reforme his owne wayes.
Besides we are come here amongst a Christian People, full of
Piety and Humanity: Let vs not bring that Confusion of face
vpon our selues, as to shew our vices, or vnworthinesse before
them. Yet there is more. For they haue by Commandement,
(though in forme of Courtesie) Cloistered vs within these Walls, for
three dayes: Who knoweth, whether it be not, to take some tast
of our manners and conditions? And if they finde them bad, to
banish vs straight-wayes; If good to giue vs further time. For
these Men, that they haue giuen vs for Attendance, may withall
haue an eye vpon vs. Therefore for GODS loue, and as we
loue the weale of our Soules and Bodies, let vs so behaue our selues,
as wee may be at peace with GOD, and may finde grace in the
Eyes of this People. Our Company with one voice thanked
me for my good Admonition, and promised me to liue soearly
and ciuilly, and without giuing any the least occasion
of Offence. So we spent our three dayes ioyfully, and without
care, in expectation what would be done with vs,
when they were expired. During which time, we had euery
houre ioy of the Amendment of our Sick; who thought
themselues cast into some Diuine Poole of Healing; They
mended so kindely, ans so fast.
                  
                     The Morrow after our three dayes were past, ther came
to vs a new Man, that we had not seen before, clothed in
Blew as the former was, saue that his Turban was white,
with a small red Crosse on the Topp. He had also a Tippet
of fine Linnen. At his Comming in, he did bend to vs a
                     
                     little, and put his Armes abroad. Wee of our parts saluted
him in a very lowly and submissiue manner; As looking
that from him, wee should receyue Sentence of Life, or
Death. He desired to speak with some few of vs: Wherupon
sixe of vs onely staied, and the rest auoyded the
Roome. He said; I am by Office Gouerner of this House of
Strangers, and by Vocation I am a Christian Priest; and therfore
am come to you, to offer you my seruice, both as Strangers, and
chiefly as Christians. Some things I may tell you, which I
thinke you will not be vnwilling to heare. The State hath giuen
you Licence to Stay on Land, for the space of sixe weekes: And
let it not trouble you, if your occasions aske further time, for the
Law in this point is not precise; And I doe not doubt, but my selfe
shall be able, to obtaine for you, such further time, as may be conuenient.
Yee shall also vnderstand, that the Strangers House,
is at this time Rich, and much aforehand; For it hath layd vp
Reuenew these 37. years: For so long it is, since any Stranger
arriued in this part: And therfore take yee no care; The
State will defray you all the time you stay: Neither shall you
stay one day the lesse for that. As for any Merchandize yee haue
brought, yee shall be well vsed, and haue your returne, either in
Merchandize, or in Gold and Siluer: For to vs it is all one. And
if you haue any other Request to make, hide it not. For yee
shall finde, we will not make your Countenance to fall, by the
Answer ye shall receiue. Onely this I must tell you, that none of
you must goe aboue a Karan, (that is with them a Mile and
an halfe) from the walles of the Citty, without especiall leaue.
We answered, after we had looked awhile one vpon another,
admiring this gracious and parent-like vsage; That
we could not tell what to say: For wee wanted words to expresse
our Thankes; And his Noble free Offers lest vs nothing to aske.
It seemed to vs, that we had before vs a picture of our Saluation
in Heauen: For wee that were a while since in the Iawes of
Death, were now brought into a place, where we found nothing but
Consolations. For the Commandement laid vpon vs, we would not
faile to obey it, though it was impossible, but our Hearts should be
enflamed to tread further vpon this Happy and Holy Ground.

                     Wee added; That our Tongues should first cleaue to the Roofes
of our Mouthes, ere we should forget, either his Reuerend Person,
or this whole Nation, in our Prayers. Wee also most humbly
besought him, to accept of vs as his true seruants, by as iust
a Right, as euer Men on Earth were bounden; laying and
presenting, both our persons, and all we had, at his feete.
He said; He was a Priest, and looked for a Priests reward;
which was our Brotherly loue, and the Good of our Soules and Bodies.
So he went from vs, not without teares of Tendernesse
in his Eyes; And left vs also confused with Ioy
and Kindnesse, saying amongst our selues; That wee were
come into a Land of Angells, which did appeare to vs dayly, and
preuent vs with Comforts, which we thought not of, much lesse expected.
                  
                     The next day about 10. of the Clocke, the Gouernour
came to vs againe, and after Salutations, said familiarly;
That he was come to visit vs; And called for a Chaire, and
satt him downe; And we being some 10. of vs, (the rest
were of the meaner Sort; or else gone abroad;) sate down
with him. And when we were sett, he began thus. Wee
of this Island of Bensalem (for so they call it in their Language)
haue this; That by meanes of our solitary Situation;
and of the Lawes of Secrecy, which we haue for our Trauellers;
and our rare Admission of Strangers; we know well most part of the
Habitable World, and are our selues vnknowne. Therefore because
he that knoweth least, is sittest to aske Questions, it is more Reason,
for the Entertainement of the time, that yee aske mee Questions,
then that I aske you. We answered; That wee humbly
thanked him, that he would giue vs leaue so to doe: And that wee
conceiued by the tast wee had already, that ther was no wordly
thing on Earth, more worthy to be knowne, then the State of that
happy Land. But aboue all (We said) since that wee were mett
from the feuer all Ends of the World; and boped assuredly, that
we should meete one day in the Kingdome of Heauen (for that
we were both parts Christians) wee desired to know (in respect
that Land was so remote, and so diuided by vast and vnknowne
Seas, from the Land, wher our SAVIOVR walked on Earth)

who was the Apostle of that Nation, and how it was conuerted to
the Faith? It appeared in his face, that he tooke great Contentment
in this our Question: Hee said; Yee knit my Heart
to you, by asking this Question in the first place; For it sheweth
that you First seeke the Kingdome of Heauen; And I shall
gladly, and briefly, satis fie your demaund.
                  About twenty Yeares after the Ascension of our SAVIOVR, it
came to passe, that ther was seen by the People of Renfusa, (a Citty
vpon the Easterne Coast of our Island,) within Night, (the Night
was Cloudy, and Calme,) as it might be some mile into the Sea, a
great Pillar of Light; Not sharp, but in forme of a Columne, or
Cylinder, rising from the Sea, a great way vp towards Heauen;
and on the topp of it was seene a large Crosse of Light, more bright
and resplendent then the Body of the Pillar. Vpon which so
strange a Spectacle, the People of the Citty gathered apace together
vpon the Sands, to wonder; And so after put themselues into
a number of small Boates, to goe nearer to this Marueilous sight.
But when the Boates were come within (about) 60. yeards of
the Pillar, they found themselues all bound, and could goe no further;
yet so as they might moue to goe about, but might not approach
nearer: So as the Boates stood all as in a Theater, beholding
this Light, as an Heauenly Signe. It so fell out, that ther was
in one of the Boates, one of our Wise Men, of the Society of Salomons
House; which House, or Colledge (my good Brethren)
is the very Eye of this Kingdome; Who hauing a while attentiuely
and deuoutly viewed, and contemplated this Pillar, and Crosse, fell
downe vpon his face; And then raysed himselfe vpon his knees,
and listing vp his Hands to Heauen, made his prayers in this
manner.
                  
                     LOrd God of Heauen and Earth; thou hast
vouchsafed of thy Grace, to those of our Order,
to know thy Workes of Creation, and the Secretts of
them; And to discerne (as farre as appertaineth
to the Generations of Men) Between Diuine Miracles,

Workes of Nature, Works of Art, and Impostures
and Illusions of all sorts. I doe here acknowledge
and testifie before this People, that the Thing
which we now see before our eyes, is thy Finger,
and a true Miracle. And for-as-much, as we learne
in our Bookes, that thou neuer workest Miracles,
but to a Diuine and Excellent End, (for the Lawes
of Nature are thine owne Lawes, and thou exceedest
them not but vpon great cause) wee most
humbly beseech thee, to prosper this great Signe;
And to giue vs the Interpretation and vse of it in
Mercy; Which thou doest in some part secretly
promise, by sending it vnto vs.
                  VVhen he had made his Prayer, hee presently found the Boate
he was in, moueable and vnbound; whereas all the rest remained
still fast; And taking that for an assurance of Leaue to approach,
he caused the Boate to be softly, and with silence, rowed towards
the Pillar. But ere he came neere it, the Pillar and Crosse of
Light brake vp, and cast it selfe abroad, as it were, into a Firmament
of many Starres; which also vanished soone after, and
there was nothing lest to be seen, but a small Arke, or Chest of
Cedar, dry, and not wett at all with water, though it swam. And
in the Fore-end of it, which was towards him, grew a small greene
Branch of Palme; And when the wise Man had taken it, with
all reuerence, into his Boate, it opened of it selfe, and there were
found in it, a Booke, and a Letter; Both written in fine Parchment,
and wrapped in Sindons of Linnen. The Booke conteined
all the Canonicall Bookes of the Old and New Testament,
according as you haue them; (For we know well what the Churches
with you receiue;) And the Apocalypse it selfe; And
Some other Bookes of the New Testament, which were not at
that time written, were neuerthelesse in the Booke. And for the
Letter, it was in these words.
                  
                     
                     IBartholomew, a Seruant of the Highest, and
Apostle of IESVS CHRIST, was warned by
an Angell, that appeared to me, in a vision of Glory,
that I should commit this Arke to the flouds of
the Sea. Therefore, I doe testifie and declare, vnto
that People, where GOD shall ordaine this Ark
to come to Land, that in the same day, is come vnto
them Saluation and Peace, and Good Will, from
the Father, and from the LORD IESVS.
                  
                  There was also in both these writings, as well the Booke, as
the Letter, wrought a great Miracle, Conforme to that of the Apostles,
in the Originall Gift of Tongues. For there being at
that time, in this Land, Hebrewes, Persians, and Indians, besides
the Natiues, euery one redd vpon the Booke, and Letter, as
if they had been written in his owne Language. And thus was
this Land saued from Infidelity, (as the Remaine of the Old World
was from Water) by an Ark, through the Apostolicall and Miraculous
Euangelisme of Saint Bartholomew. And here hee
paused, and a Messenger came, and called him from vs. So
this was all that passed in that Conference.
                  
                  
                     The next Day, the same Gouernour came againe to vs,
immediately after Dinner, and excused himselfe, saying;
That the Day before, he was called from vs, somewhat abruptly,
but now he would make vs amends, and spend time with vs; if we
held his Company, and Conference agreeable. Wee answered;
That wee held it so agreeable and pleasing to vs, as wee forgot both
Dangers past, and Feares to come, for the time wee heard him
speake; And that wee thought, an Houre spent with him, was
worth Yeares of our former life. He bowed himselfe a little
to vs, and after we were set againe, he said; Well, the Questions
are on your part. One of our Number said, after a little
Pause; That there was a Matter, wee were no lesse desirous to
know, then fearefull to aske, least wee might presume too farre.

But encouraged by his rare Humanity towards vs, (that could
scarce thinke our selues Strangers, being his vowed and professed
Seruants,) We would take the Hardines to propound it: Humbly
beseeching him, if hee thought it not fit to bee answered, that hee
would pardon it, though he reiected it. Wee said; VVee well obserued
those his words, which hee formerly spake, that this happy
Island, wher we now stood, was knowne to few, and yet knew must
of the Nations of the World; which we found to be true, considering
they had the Languages of Europe, and knew much of our State
and Businesse; And yet we in Europe, (notwithstanding all the
remote Discoueries, and Nauigations of this last Age) neuer
heard any of the least Inkling or Glimse of this Island. This we
found wonderfull strange; For that all Nations haue Enterknowledge
one of another, either by Voyage into Forraigne Parts, or
by Strangers that come to them: And though the Trauailer into
a Forreine Countrey, doth commonly know more by the Eye,
then he that stayeth at home can by relation of the Trauailer;
Yet both wayes suffice to make a mutuall Knowledge, in some degree,
on both parts. But for this Island, wee neuer heard tell of
any Shipp of theirs, that had been Seene to arriue vpon any Shore
of Europe; No, nor of either the East or West Indies, nor yet
of any Shipp of any other part of the World, that had made returne
from them. And yet the Maruell rested not in this; For the
Situation of it (as his Lordship said,) in the secret Conclaue of
such a vast Sea mought cause it. But then, that they should
haue Knowledge of the Languages, Bookes, Affaires, of those
that lye such a distance from them, it was a thing wee could
not tell what to make of; For that it seemed to vs a condition
and Proprietie of Diuine Powers and Beings, to be hidden
and vnseene to others, and yet to haue others open, and as
in a light to them. At this speach the Gouernour gaue a
gracious smile, and sayd; That we did well to aske pardon
for this Question we now asked; For that it imported, as if we
thought this Land, a Land of Magicians; that sent forth Spirits
of the Ayre into all parts, to bring them Newes and Intelligence of
other Countries. It was answered by vs all, in all possible humblenes,
but yet with a Countenance taking knowledge, that
                     
                     we knew he spake it but merrily; That we were apt enough to
think, ther was some what supernaturall in this Island; but yet rather
as Angelicall, then Magicall. But to let his Lordship know truely,
what it was, that made vs tender and doubtful to aske this Question,
it was, not any such conceit, but because we remembred, he had giuen
a Touch in his former Speach, that this Land had Lawes of Secrecy
touching Strangers. To this he said; You remember it aright:
And therefore in that I shall say to you, I must reserue some particulars,
which it is not lawfull for mee to reueale; but there will bee
enough left, to giue you satisfaction.
                  You shall vnderstand (that which perhaps you will scarce think
credible) that about three thousand Yeares agoe; or somewhat more,
the Nauigation of the World (specially for remote Voyages) was
greater then at this Day. Doe not thinke with your selues, that I
know not how much it is encreased with you, within these sixescore
Years: I know it well; And yet I say, greater then, than now:
Whether it was, that the Example of the Ark, that saued the Remnant
of Men, from the vniuersall Deluge, gaue Men confidence to
aduenture vpon the Waters; Or what it was; but such is the
Truth. The Phoeniceans, and specially the Tyrians, had great
Fleetes. So had the Carthaginians their Colony, which is yet
further West. Toward the East the Shipping of Egypt, and of Palestina
was likewise great. China also, and the great Atlantis,
(that you call America) which haue now but Iunks, and Canoa's, abounded
then in tall Ships. This Island, (as appeareth by faithfull
Registers of those times) had then fifteene hundred strong Ships,
of great content. Of all this, there is with you sparing Memory, or
none; But we haue large Knowledge thereof.
                  At that time, this Land was knowne and frequented by
the Shipps and Vessells of all the Nations before named.
And (as it commeth to passe) they had many times Men of
other Countries, that were no Saylers, that came with them;
As Persians, Chaldeans, Arabians; So as almost all Nations
of Might and Fame resorted hither; Of whom we haue some
Stirps, and little Tribes with vs, at this day. And for our owne
Ships, they went sundry Voyages; as well to your Streights, which
you call the Pillars of Hercules, As to other parts in the

                     Atlantique and Mediterrane Seas; As to Paguin, (which is the
same with Cambaline) and Quinzy, vpon the Orientall Seas,
as farre as to the Borders of the East Tartary.
                  
                  At the same time, and an Age after, or more, the Inhabitants of
the great Atlantis did flourish. For though the Narration and Description,
which is made by a great Man with you; that the Descendents
of Neptune planted there; and of the Magnificent Temple,
Pallace, Citie, and Hill; And the manifold streames of goody Nauigable
Riuers, (which as so many Chaines enuironed the same Site,
and Temple;) And the seuerall Degrees of Ascent, wherby Men did
climb vp to the same, as if it bad bin a Scala Caeli; be all Poetical &amp;
Fabulous: Yet so much is true, that the said Country of Atlantis; As
well that of Peru then Called Coya, as that of Mexico then named
Tyrambel, were mighty &amp; proud Kingdomes, in Armes, Shipping,
and Riches: So Mighty, as at one time, (or at least within the space
of 10. Yeares,) they both made two great Expeditions; They of
Tirambel through the Atlantique to the Mediterrane Sea; and
they of Coya through the South Sea vpon this our Island: And
for the former of these, which was into Europe, the same Authour
amongst you, (as it seemeth,) had some relation from the Egyptian
Priest, whom he citeth. For assuredly such a thing ther
wa
                        •
                     . But whether it were the Ancient Athenians, that had the
glory of the Repulse, and Resistance of those Forces, I can say
nothing: But certaine it is, there neuer came backe, either Ship,
or M
                        •
                     r, from that Voyage. Neither had the other Voyage of those
of Coya vpon vs, had better fortune, if they had not met with
Enemies of greater clemency. For the King of this Island, (by
name Altabin,) a wife Man, and a great Warrier; Knowing
well both his owne strength, and that of his Enemies; handled
the matter so, as he cut off their Land-Forces, from their Ships;
and encoyled both their Nauy, and their Campe, with a greater
Power then theirs, both by Sea and Land: And compelled them
to render themselues without striking stroke: And after they were
at his Mercy, contenting himselfe onely with their Oath, that they
should no more beare Armes against him, dismissed them all in
safety. But the Diuine Reuenge ouertooke not long after those
proud Enterprises. For within lesse then the space of one Hundred

Yeares, the Great Atlantis was vtterly lost and destroyed: Not
by a great Earthquake, as your Man saith; (For that whole Tract
is little subiect to Earthquakes;) But by a particular Deluge or
Inundation; Those Countries hauing, at this Day, farr greater Riuers,
and farr higher Mountaines, to poure downe waters, then any
part of the Old World. But it is true, that the same Inundation
was not deepe; Not past fourty foote, in most places, from the
Ground; So that, although it destroyed Man and Beast generally,
yet some few wild Inhabitants of the Wood escaped. Birds also were
saued by flying to the high Trees and Woods. For as for Men, although
they had Buildings in many places, higher then the Depth of
the Water; Yet that Inundation, though it were shallow, had a long
Continuance; whereby they of the Vale, that were not drowned,
perished for want of Food, and other things necessary. So
as maruaile you not at the thin Population of America, nor at
the Rudenesse and Ignorance of the People; For you must account
your Inhabitants of America as a young People; Younger
a thousand yeares, at the least, then the rest of the World: For
that ther was so much time, betweene the Vniuersall Floud,
and their Particular Inundation. For the poore Remnant of
Humane Seed, which remained in their Mountaines, Peopled
the Countrey againe slowly, by little and little; And being
simple and sauage People, (Not like Noah and his Sonnes,
which was the chiefe Family of the Earth) they were not able
to leaue Letters, Arts, and Ciuillity, to their Posterity; And
hauing likewise in their Mountanous Habitations beene vsed,
(in respect of the Extreame Cold of those Regions,) to cloath
themselues with the Skinns of Tygers, Beares, and great Hairy
Goates, that they haue in those Parts; When after they
came downe into the Valley, and found the Intollerable Heates
which are there, and knew no meanes of lighter Apparell; they
were forced to beginn the Custome of Going Naked, which continueth
at this day. Onely they take great pride and delight,
in the Feathers of Birds; And this also they tooke from those their
Auncestours of the Mountaines, who were inuited vnto it, by
the infinite Flights of Birdes, that came vp to the high Grounds,
while the Waters stood below. So you see, by this maine Accident

of Time, wee lost our Traffique with the Americans, with
whom, of all others, in regard they lay nearest to vs, wee had
most Commerce. As for the other Parts of the World, it is
most manifest, that in the Ages following, (whether it were in
respect of Warres, or by a naturall Reuolution of Time,) Nauigation
did euery wher greatly decay; And specially, farre
Voyages, (the rather by the vse of Gallies, and such Vessells
as could hardly brooke the Ocean,) were altogether left and omitted.
So then, that part of Entercourse, which could bee from
other Nations, to Sayle to vs, you see how it hath long since
ceased; Except it were by some rare Accident, as this of yours.
But now of the Cessation of that other Part of Entercourse, which
mought be by our Sayling to other Nations, I must yeeld you
some other Cause. For I cannot say, (if I shall say truely,)
but our Shipping, for Number, Strength, Marriners, Pylots,
and all things that appertaine to Nauigation, is as great as euer;
And therefore why we should sit at home, I shall now giue you an account
by it selfe; And it will draw nearer, to giue you satisfaction, to
your principall Question.
                  There raigned in this Island, about 1900. yeares agoe, a
King, whose memory of all others we most adore; Not Superstitiously,
but as Diuine Instrument, though a Mortall Man:
His Name was Solamona: And we esteeme him as the Law-giuer
of our Nation. This King had a large heart, inscrutable
for good; And was wholly bent to make his kingdome
and People Happy. He therefore taking into Consideration,
how sufficient and substantiue this Land was, to maintaine it self,
without any ayd (at all) of the Forrainer; Being 5600.
Miles in circuit, and of rare Fertility of Soyle, in the greatest
part thereof; And finding also the Shipping of this Country
mought bee plentifully set on worke, both by Fishing, and by
Transportations from Port to Port, and likewise by Sayling
vnto some small Islands that are not farre from vs, and are vnder
the Crowne and Lawes of this State; And recalling into
his Memory, the happy and flourishing Estate, wherein this Land
then was; So as it mought bee a thousand wayes altered to the
worse, but scarse any one way to the better; thought nothing

wanted to his Noble and Heroicall Intentions, but onely (as farr
as Humane foresight mought reach) to giue perpetuitie to that,
which was in his time so happily established. Therefore amongst
his other Fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdome, he did ordaine
the Interdicts and Prohibitions, which wee haue touching Extrance
of Strangers; which at that time (though it was after
the Calamity of America) was frequent; Doubting Nouelties,
and Commixture of Manners. It is true, the like Law, against
the Admission of Strangers without License, is an Ancient
Law, in the Kingdome of China, and yet continued in vse.
But ther it is a poore Thing; And hath made them a curious, ignorant,
fearefull, foolish Nation. But our Law-giuer made
his Law of another temper. For first, hee hath preserved all
points of Humanity, in taking Order, and making Prouision for
the Reliefe of Strangers distressed; whereof you haue tasted.
At which Speach (as reason was) wee all rose vp, and
bowed our selues. Hee went on. That King also still desiring
to ioyne Humanity and Pollicy together; And thinking it
against Humanity, to detaine Strangers here against their wills;
And against Pollicy, that they should returne, and discouer their
Knowledge of this Estate, he tooke this Course: He did or daine,
that of the Strangers, that should be permitted to Land, as many
(at all times) mought depart as would; But as many as
would stay, should haue very good Conditions, and Meanes to
liue, from the State. Wherein hee saw so farre, that now in
so many Ages since the Prohibition, wee haue memory not of one
Shipp that euer returned, and but of thirteene Persons only
at seuerall times, that chose to returne in our Bottomes.
What those few that returned may haue reported abroad I know
not. But you must thinke, Whatsoeuer they haue said, could
bee taken where they came, but for a Dreame. Now for our
Trauelling from hence into Parts abroad, our Law-giuer
thought fit altogether to restraine it. So is it not in China. For
the Chineles sayle where they will, or can; which sheweth, that
thier Law of Keeping out Strangers, is a Law of Pusillanimity,
and feare. But this restraint of ours, hath one onely Exception,
which is admirable; Preseruing the good which commeth

by communicating with Strangers, and auoyding the Hurt;
And I will now open it to you. And here I shall seeme a little to
digresse, but you will by and by finde it pertinent. Yee shall vnderstand,
(my deare Friends,) that amongst the Excellent Acts
of that King, one aboue all hath the preheminence. It was the Erection,
and Institution of an Order, or Society, which wee call Salomons
House; The Noblest Foundation, (as wee thinke,) that
euer was vpon the Earth; And the Lanthorne of this Kingdome.
It is dedicated to the Study of the Works, and Creatures of GOD.
Some thinke it beareth the Founders Name a little corrupted, as
if it should be Solamona's House. But the Records write it, as it
is spoken. So as I take it to bee denominate of the King of the Hebrewes,
which is famous with you, and no Stranger to vs.
For wee haue some Parts of his works, which with you are lost;
Namely that Naturall History, which hee wrote of all Plants,
from the Cedar of Libanus, to the Mosse that groweth out
of the Wall; And of all things that haue Life and Motion.
This maketh me thinke, that our King finding himselfe to Symbolize,
in many things, with that King of the Hebrewes (which
liued many yeares before him) honoured him with the Title of
this Foundation. And I am the rather induced to be of this Opinion,
for that I finde in ancient Records, this Order or Societie
is sometimes called Salomons House; And sometimes the
Colledge of the sixe Daies Workes: wherby I am satisfied,
That our Excellent King had learned from the Hebrewes;
That GOD had created the World, and all that therin is, within
sixe Dayes; And therefore hee instituting that House, for the
finding out of the true Nature of all Things, (wherby GOD
mought haue the more Glory in the Workemanship of them, and
Men the more fruit in the vse of them,) did giue it also that
second Name. But now to come to our present purpose. When
the King bad forbidden, to all his People, Nauigation into any
Part, that was not vnder his Crowne, he made neuerthelesse
this Ordinance; That euery twelue yeares ther should be set forth,
out of this Kingdome, two Ships, appointed to seuerall Voyages;
That in either of these Shipps, ther should be a Mission of
three of the Fellowes, or Brethren of Salomons House;
                     
whose Errand was onely to giue vs Knowledge of the Affaires
and State of those Countries, to which they were designed; And
especially of the Sciences, Arts, Manufactures, and Inuentions of
all the World; And withall to bring vnto vs, Bookes, Instruments,
and Patternes, in euery kinde: That the Ships, after they
had landed the Brethren, should returne; And that the Brethren
should stay abroad till the new Mission. These Ships are
not otherwise fraught, then with Store of Victualls, and good
Quantitie of Treasure to remaine with the Brethren, for the
buying of such Things, and rewarding of such Persons, as they
should thinke fit. Now for me to tell you, how the Vulgar sort
of Marriners are contained from being discouered at Land; And
how they that must be put on shore for any time, colour themselues
vnder the Names of other Nations; And to what places these
Voyages haue beene designed; And what places of RendezVous
are appointed for the new Missions; And the like Circumstances
of the Practique; I may not doe it; Neither is it
much to your desire. But thus you see, wee maintaine a Trade,
not for Gold, Siluer, or Iewels; Nor for Silkes; Nor for Spices;
Nor any other Commodity of Matter; But onely for GODS
first Creature, which was Light: To haue Light (I say) of the
Growth of all Parts of the World. And when hee had said
this, he was silent; And so were wee all. For indeed
wee were all astonished, to heare so strange things
so probably told. And hee perceiuing, that wee were
willing to say somewhat, but had it not ready, in
great Courtesie tooke vs off, and descended to aske vs Questions
of our Voyage and Fortunes, and in the end concluded,
that we mought doe well, to thinke with our selues,
what Time of stay wee would demand of the State; And
bad vs not to scant our selues; For he would procure such
time as wee desired. Wherevpon wee all rose vp, and presented
our selues to kisse the skirt of his Tippet; But hee
would not suffer vs; and so tooke his leaue. But when it
came once amongst our People, that the State vsed to offer
Conditions to Strangers, that would stay, wee had Worke
enough to get any of our Men to looke to our Shipp; And

to keepe them from going presently to the Gouernour,
to craue Conditions. But with much adoe wee refrained
them, till we mought agree what Course to take.
                  
                  We took our selues now for free men, seeing ther was no
danger of our vtter Perdition; And liued most ioyfully, going
abroad, and seeing what was to be seen, in the Citty, and places
adiacent, within our Tedder; And obtaining Acquaintance
with many of the Citty, not of the meanest Quallity;
At whose hands we found such Humanity, and such a Freedome
and desire, to take Strangers, as it were, into their Bosome,
as was enough to make vs forget all that was deare to
vs, in our owne Countries: And continually we mett with
many things, right worthy of Obseruation, &amp; Relation: As
indeed, if ther be a Mirrour in the World, worthy to hold
Mens Eyes, it is that Countrey. One day there were two of
our Company bidden to a Feast of the Family, as they call it.
A most Naturall, Pious, &amp; Reuerend Custome it is, shewing
that Nation to be compounded of all Goodnes. This is the
manner of it. It is granted to any Man, that shall liue to see
thirty Persons, descended of his Body, aliue together, and all
aboue 3. yeares old, to make this Feast, which is done at the
Cost of the State. The Father of the Family, whom they call
the Tirsan, two dayes before the Feast, taketh to him three of
such Friends as he liketh to chuse; And is assisted also by the
Gouernour of the Citty, or Place, where the Feast is celebrated;
And all the Persons of the Family, of both Sexes, are summoned
to attend him. These two dayes the Tirsan sitteth in
Consultation, cōcerning the good Estate of the Family. Ther,
if ther be any Discord or sutes betweene any of the Family,
they are compounded and appeased. Ther, if any of the
Family bee Distressed or Decayed, order is taken for their
Reliefe, and competent meanes to liue. Ther, if any bee
subiect to vice, or take ill Courses, they are reproued and
Censured. So likewise, Direction is giuen touching Marriages,
and the Courses of life, which any of them should
take, with diuers other the like Orders and Aduises. The
Gouernour assisteth, to the end, to put in Execution, by his

Publicke Authority, the Decrees and Orders of the Tirsan,
if they should bee disobeyed; Though that seldome needeth;
Such Reuerence and Obedience they giue; to the
Order of Nature. The Tirsan doth also then, euer chuse
one Man from amongst his Sonnes, to liue in House with
him; Who is called, euer after, the Sonne of the Vine. The
Reason will hereafter appeare. On the Feast day, the Father
or Tirsan commeth forth after Diuine Seruice, into a
large Roome, where the Feast is celebrated; which Roome
hath an Halfe-Pace at the vpper end. Against the wall,
in the middle of the halfe-pace, is a Chaire placed for him,
with a Table and Carpet before it. Ouer the Chaire is
a State, made Round or Ouall, and it is of Iuy; An Iuy
somewhat whiter then ours, like the Leafe of a Siluer
Aspe, but more shining; For it is greene all Winter. And
the State is curiously wrought with Siluer and Silke of diuers
Colours, broyding or binding in the Iuy; And is euer
of the worke, of some of the Daughters of the Family;
And vailed ouer at the Topp, with a fine Nett of Silke
and Siluer. But the Substance of it, is true Iuy; wherof,
after it is taken downe, the Friends of the Family, are
desirous to haue some Leafe or Sprigg to keepe. The Tirsan
commeth forth with all his Generation or Linage, the
Males before him, and the Females following him; And
if there be a Mother, from whose Body the whole Linage
is descended, there is a Trauerse placed in a Lost aboue,
on the right hand of the Chaire, with a priuy Dore, and a
carued Window of Glasse, leaded with Gold and blew;
Wher shee sitteth, but is not seene. When the Tirsan is
come forth, he sitteth downe in the Chaire; And all the
Linage place themselues against the wall both at his back,
and vpon the Returne of the Halfe-pace, in Order of their
yeares, without difference of Sexe, and stand vpon their
Feete. When hee is sett, the Roome being alwaies full of
Company, but well kept and without Disorder, after
some pause, there commeth in from the lower ende of
the Roome, a Taratan, (which is as much as an Herald;
                     
And on either side of him two young Lads; Wherof one
carrieth a Scrowle of their shining yellow Parchment;
And the other a Cluster of Grapes of Gold, with a long
Foote or Stalke. The Herald, and Children, are cloathed
with Mantles of Sea-water greene Sattin; But the Heralds
Mantle is streamed with Gold, and hath a Traine.
Then the Herald with three Curtesies, or rather Inclinations,
commeth vp as farre as the Halfe-pace; And ther
first taketh into his Hand the Scrowle. This Scrowle is
the Kings Charter, containing Guift of Reuenew, and manany
Priuiledges, Exemptions, and Points of Honour,
granted to the Father of the Family; And it is euer stiled
and directed; To such an one, Our welbeloued Friend and
Creditour: Which is a Title proper onely to this Case. For
they sa
                        •
                     , the King is Debter to no Man, but for Propagation
of his Subiects, The Seale set to the Kings Charter,
is the Kings Image, Imbossed or moulded in Gold; And
though such Charters bee expedited of Course, and as of
Right, yet they are varied by discretion, according to the
Number and Dignitie of the Family. This Charter the
Herald readeth aloud; And while it is read, the Father
or Tirsan, standeth vp, supported by two of his Sonnes,
such as hee chooseth. Then the Herald mounteth the HalfPace,
and deliuereth the Charter into his Hand; And with
that there is an Acclamation, by all that are present,
in their Language, which is thus much; Happy are the people
of Bensalem. Then the Herald taketh into his Hand
from the other Child the Cluster of Grapes, which is of
Gold; Both the Stalke, and the Grapes. But the Grapes
are daintely enamelled; And if the Males of the Family be
the greater number, the Grapes are enamelled Purple, with
a little Sunne fett on the Topp; If the Females, then
they are enamelled into a greenish yellow, with a Cressant
on the Topp. The Grapes are in number as many
as there are Descendents of the Family. This Golden
Cluster, the Herald deliuereth also to the Tirsan; Who presently
deliuereth it ouer, to that Sonne, that hee had formerly

chosen, to bee in House with him; Who beareth
it before his Father, as an Ensigne of Honour, when
he goeth in publicke euer after; And is thereupon called
the Sonne of the Vine. After this Ceremony ended, the
Father or Tirsan retireth; And after some time commeth
forth againe to Dinner, where he sitteth alone vnder the
State, as before; And none of his Descendants sit with
him, of what Degree or Dignitie soeuer, except he hap
to be of Salomons House. Hee is serued onely by his owne
Children, such as are Male; who performe vnto him all
seruice of the Table vpon the knee; And the Women only
stand about him, leaning against the wall. The
Roome belowe the Halfe-pace, hath Tables on the sides
for the Ghests that are bidden; Who are serued with
great and comely order; And towards the end of Dinner
(which in the greatest Feasts with them, lasteth neuer
aboue an Houre and an halfe) there is an Hymne sung, varied
according to the Inuention of him that composeth it,
(for they haue excellent Poesie;) But the Subiect of it is,
(alwayes,) the prayses of Adam, and Noah, and Abraham;
Wherof the former two Peopled the World, and the last
was the Father of the Faithfull: Concluding euer with a
Thankesgiuing for the Natiuitie of our Sauiour, in whose
Birth, the Births of all are onely Blessed. Dinner being
done, the Tirsan retireth againe; And hauing withdrawne
himselfe alone into a place; where hee maketh some priuate
Prayers, hee commeth foorth the third time, to giue
the Blessing; with all his Descendants, who stand about
him, as at the first. Then he calleth them forth by one
and by one, by name, as he pleaseth, though seldome the
Order of Age bee inuerted. The person that is called,
(the Table being before remoued,) kneeleth downe before
the Chaire, and the Father layeth his Hand, vpon
his Head, or her Head, and giueth the Blessing in these
Wordes; Sonne of Bensalem, (or Daughter of Bensalem,) thy
Father saith it; The Man by whom thou hast Breath and Life
speaketh the word; The Blessing of the Euerlasting Father,

the Prince of Peace, and the Holy Doue, bee vpon thee, and
make the dayes of thy Pilgrimage, good, and many. This he
saith to euery of them; And that done, if there be any of
his Sonnes, of eminent Meritt and Vertue, (so they be not
aboue two,) hee calleth for them againe; And saith, laying
his Arme ouer their shoulders, they standing; Sonnes,
it is well yee are borne, giue God the prayse, and perseuere to
the end. And withall deliuereth to either of them a Iewel,
made in the Figure of an Eare of Wheat, which they euer after
weare in the front of their Turban, or Hat. This done,
they fall to Musick and dances, And other Recreations, after
their manner, for the rest of the day. This is the full order
of that Feast.
                  
                  
                     By that time, sixe or seuen Dayes were spent, I was fallen
into straight Acquaintance, with a Merchant of that Citty,
whose Name was Ioabin Hee was a Iew and Circumcised:
For they haue some few Stirps of Iewes, yet remaining
amongst them, whom they leaue to their owne Religion.
Which they may the better doe, because they are
of a farre differing Disposition from the Iewes in other
Parts. For whereas they hate the Name of CHRIST; And
haue a secret inbred Rancour against the People amongst
whom they liue; These (contrariwise) giue vnto our SAVIOVR
many high Attributes, and loue the Nation of Bensalem,
extreamely. Surely this Man, of whom I speake,
would euer acknowledge, that CHRIST was borne of a
Virgin; And that hee was more then a Man; And hee
would tell how GOD made him Ruler of the Seraphims,
which guard his Throane; And they call him also the
Milken Way, and the Eliah of the Messiah; And many other
High Names; which though they be inferiour to his
Diuine Maiestie, Yet they are farre from the Language of
other Iewes. And for the Countrey of Bensalem, this Man
would make no end of commending it. Being desirous
by Tradition amongst the Iewes there, to haue it beleeued,
that the People thereof were of the Generations of Abraham,
by another Sonne, whom they call Nachorans; And

that Moses by a secret Cabala ordained the Lawes of Bensalem
which they now vse; And that when the Messiah
should come, and sit in his Throne at Hierusalem, the
King of Bensalem, should sit at his feete, whereas other
Kings should keepe a great distance. But yet setting aside
these Iewish Dreames, the Man was a wise Man, and
learned, and of great Pollicy, and excellently seene in the
Lawes and Customes of that Nation. Amongst other
Discourses, one day, I told him, I was much affected with
the Relation I had, from some of the Company, of their
Custome, in holding the Feast of the Family; For that (me
thought) I had neuer heard of a Solemnity, wherein Nature
did so much preside. And because Propagation of Families,
proceedeth from the Nuptiall Copulation, I desired
to know of him, what Lawes and Customes they had
concerning Marriage; And whether they kept Marriage
well; And whether they were tyed to one Wife; For that
wher Population is so much affected, and such as with
them it seemed to be, ther is commonly Permision of Plurality
of Wiues. To this he said; You haue Reason for to commend
that excellent Institution of the Feast of the Family. And
indeed wee haue Experience, that those Families, that are partakers
of that Blessing of that Feast, doe flurkish and prosper euer after,
in an extraordinary manner. But heare mee now, and I will
tell you what I know. You shall vnderstand, that there is not
vnder the Heauens, so chast a Nation, as this of Bensalem;
Nor so free from all Pollution, or foulenesse. It is the Virgin of
the World. I remember, I haue redd in one of your Europaean
Bookes, of an holy Hermit amongst you, that desired to see the
Spirit of Fornication, and there appeared to him, a little foule
vgly Aethiope. But if he hed desired to see the Spirit of
Chastitie of Bensalem, it would haue appeared to him, in the likenes
of a faire beautifull Cherubin. For there is nothing, amongst Mortall Men, more faire and admirable, then the Chast Mindes
of this People. Know therefore, that with them ther are no
Stewes, no dissolute Houses, no Curtisans, nor any thing of that
kind. Nay they wonder (with detestation) at you in Europe, which

permit such things. They say ye haue put Marriage out of office:
For Marriage is ordained a Remedy for vnlawfull Concupiscence;
And Naturall Concupiscence seemeth as a spurr to Marriage. But
when Men haue at hand a Remedy, more agreeable to their corrupt
will, Marriage is almost expulsed. And therefore that are
with you seene infinite Men, that marry not, but chuse rather a
libertine and impure single Life, then to be yoaked in Marriage;
And many that doe marry, marry late, when the Prime and
Stength of their Yeares is past. And when they doe marry, what
is Marriage to them, but a very Bargaine; Wherin is sought
Alliance, or Portion, or Reputation, with some desire (almost indifferent)
of Issue; And not the faithfull Nuptiall Vnion of Man
and Wife, that was first instituted. Neither is it possible, that
those that haue cast away so basely, so much of their Strength,
should greatly esteeme Children, (being of the same Matter,) as
Chast Men doe. So Likewise during Marriage is the Case much
amended▪ as it ought to bee if those things were tolerated onely
for necessitie? No, but they remaine still as a very Affront to
Marriage. The Haunting of those dissolute places, or resort to
Curtizans, are no more punished in Married Men, then in Batchellers,
And the depraued Custome of change, and the Delight in
Meretricious Embracements, (wher sinne is turned into Art,)
maketh Marriage a dull thing, and a kinde of Imposition, or Taxe.
They heare you defend these things, as done to auoyd greater Euills;
As Aduoutries, Deflouring of Virgins, Vnnaturall lust, and the
like. But they say this is a preposterous Wisdome; And they call it
Lot's offer, who to saue his Guests from abusing, Offered his
Daughters: Nay they say further, That ther is little gained in this;
For that the same Vices and Appetites, doe still remayne and abound
Vnlawfull Lust being like a Furnace, that if you stopp
the Flames altogether, it will quench; But if you giue it
any vent, it will rage. As for Masculine Loue, they haue no
touch of it, And yet ther are not, so faithfull and inuiolate Freindshipps,
in the world againe, as are ther: And to speake generally,
(as I said before,) I haue not read of any such Chastity,
in any People, as theirs: And their vsuall saying is, That whosoeuer
is vnchast cannnot reuerence himselfe: And they say;

                     That the Reuerence of a Mans selfe, is, next Religion, the
chiefest Bridle of all Vices. And when hee had faid
this, the good Iew paused a little; Whereupon, I farr more
willing to heare him speake on, then to speake my selfe; yet
thinking it decent, that vpon his pause of Speech, I should
not be altogether silent, said onely this; That I would say to
him, as the Widow of Sarepta said to Elias; that he was come
to bring to Memory our Sinnes; And that I confesse the Righteousnesse
of Bensalem, was greater then the Righteousnesse of
Europe. At which speech hee bowed his Head, and
went on in this manner. They haue also many wise and excellent
Lawes touching Marriage. They allow no Polygamy.
They haue ordained that none doe intermarry or contract, vntill a
Moneth hee past from their first Inter viewe. Marriage without
consent of Parents they doe not make void, but they mulct it
in the Inheritours: For the Children of such Marriages, are not
admitted to inherit, aboue a third Part of their Parents Inheritance.
I haue read in a Booke of one of your Men, of a
Faigned Common-wealth, wher the Married Couple are
permitted, before they Contract, to see one another Naked. This
they dislike: For they thinke it a Scorne, to giue a Refusall after
so Familiar Knowledge: But because of many hidden Defects
in Men and Womens Bodies, they haue a more ciuill Way:
For they haue neare euery Towne, a Couple of Pooles, (which
they call Adam and Eues Pooles,) wher it is permitted to one
of the Friends of the Man, and another of the friends of the
Woman, to see them seuerally bath Naked.
                  And as wee were thus in Conference, ther came one
that seemed to be a Messenger, in a rich Huke, that spake
with the Iew: Whereupon hee turned to mee, and said;
You will pardon mee, for I am commanded away in hast. The
next Morning he came to me againe, ioyfull as it seemed,
and said; There is word come to the Gouernour of the Citty,
that one of the Fathers of Salomons House, will be here this
day Seuen-night: Wee haue seene none of them this Dozen
Yeares. His Comming is in State; But the Cause of his comming
is secret. I will prouide you, and your Fellowes, of a good

Standing, to see his Entry. I thanked him, and told him; I
was most glad of the Newes. The Day being come he made
is Entry. He was a Man of middle Stature, and Age,
comely of Person, and had an Aspect as if he pittied Men.
He was cloathed in a Roabe of fine black Cloath, with
wide Sleeues, and a Cape. His vnder Garment was
of excellent white Linnen, downe to the Foote, girt
with a Girdle of the same; And a Sindon or Tipett
pett of the same about his Neck. He had Gloues,
that were curious, and sett with Stone; And Shoes of
Peach-coloured Veluet. His Neck was bare to the Shoulders.
His Hatt was like a Helmett, or Spanish Montera; And
his Locks curled below it decently: They were of Colour
browne. His Beard was cutt round, and of the same colour
with his Haire, somewhat lighter. He was carried in
a rich Chariott, without Wheeles, Litter-wise; With two
Horses at either end, richly trapped in blew Veluett Embroydered;
and two Footmen on each side in the like Atire.
The Chariott was all of Cedar, gilt, and adorned
with Crystall; Saue that the Fore-end had Pannells of Saphires,
set in Borders of Gold; And the Hinder end the
like of Emerauds of the Peru Colour. Ther was also a Sunn
of Gold, Radiant, vpon the Topp, in the Midst; And on the
Topp before, a small Cherub of Gold, with Wings displayed.
The Chariott was couered with Cloath of Gold tissued vpon
Blew. He had before him fifty Attendants, young Men
all, in white Satten loose Coates to the Mid Legg; And Stockins
of white Silk; And Shoes of blew Veluet; And Hatts of
blew Veluett; with fine Plumes of diuerse Colours, sett
round like Hat-bands. Next before the Chariott, went two
Men, bare headed, in Linnen Garments downe to the
Foote, girt, and Shoes of blew Veluett; Who carried, the
one a Crosier, the other a Pastorall Staffe like a Sheephooke:
Neither of them of Mettall, but the Crosier of
Balme-wood, the Pastorall Staffe of Cedar. Horse-Men
he had none, neither before, nor behinde his Chariott: As
it seemeth to anoyd all Tumult and Trouble. Behinde

his Chariott, went all the Officers and Principalls of the
Companies of the Citty. He sate alone, vpon Cushions,
of a kinde of excellent Plush, blew; And vnder his Foote
curious Carpetts of Silk of diuerse Colours, like the Persian,
but farr finer. He held vp his bare Hand, as he
went, as blessing the People, but in Silence. The Street
was wonderfully well kept; So that ther was neuer any
Army had their Men stand in better Battell-Array, then
the People stood. The Windowes likewise were not
crouded, but euery one stood in them, as if they had been
placed. When the shew was past, the Iew said to me;
I shall not be able to attend you as I would, in regard of some
charge the Citty hath lay'd vpon me, for the Entertaining of this
Great Person. Three dayes after the Iew came to me
againe, and said; Yee are happy Men; for the Father of Salomons
House taketh knowledge of your Being here, and commanded
me to tell you, that he will admitt all your Company to his presence,
and haue priuate Conference with one of you, that ye shall
choose: And for this hath appointed the next day after too Morrow.
And because he meaneth to giue you his Blessing, he hath appointed
it in the Forenoone. We came at our Day, and Houre,
and I was chosen by my Fellowes for the priuate Accesse.
We found him in a faire Chamber, richly hanged, and carpetted
vnder Foote, without any Degrees to the State.
He was sett vpon a Low Throne richly adorned, and a
rich Cloath of State ouer his Head, of blew Sattin Embroidered.
He was alone, saue that he had two Pages of
Honour, on either Hand one, finely attired in White.
His Vnder Garments were the like that we saw him weare
in the Chariott; but in stead of his Gowne, he had on
him a Mantle with a Cape, of the same fine Black, fastned
about him. When we came in, as we were taught, we
bowed Lowe at our first Entrance; And when we were
come neare his Chaire, he stood vp, holding forth his
Hand vngloued, and in Posture of Blessing; And we euery
one of vs stooped downe, and kissed the Hemme of his
Tippett. That done, the rest departed, and I remayned.

Then hee warned the Pages forth of the Roome, and
caused mee to sit downe beside him, and spake to me thus
in the Spanish Tongue.
                  
                  
                     GOD blesse thee, my Sonne; I will giue
thee the greatest Iewell I haue: For I will
impart vnto thee, for the Loue of GOD and
Men, a Relation of the true State of Salomons
House. Sonne, to make you know the true state
of Salomons House, I will keepe this order.
First I will set forth vnto you the End of our
Foundation. Secondly, the Preparations and
Instruments we haue for our Workes. Thirdly,
the seuerall Employments and Functions wherto
our Fellowes are assigned. And fourthly, the
Ordinances and Rites which we obserue.
                  The End of our Foundation is the Knowledge
of Causes, and Secrett Motions of Things;
And the Enlarging of the bounds of Humane Empire,
to the Effecting of all Things possible.
                  The Preparations and Instruments are these.
We haue large and deepe Causes of seuerall Depths:
The deepest are sunke 600. Fathome: And some
of them are digged and made vnder great Hills
and Mountaines: So that if you reckon together
the Depth of the Hill, and the Depth of the
Caue, they are (some of them) aboue three

Miles deepe. For wee finde, that the Depth
of a Hill, and the Depth of a Caue from the
Flat, is the same Thing; Both remote alike,
from the Sunn and Heauens Beames, and from
the Open Aire. These Caues we call the Lower
Region; And wee vse them for all Coagulations,
Indurations, Refrigerations, and Conseruations
of Bodies. We use them likewise for
the Imitation of Naturall Mines; And the Producing
also of New Artificiall Mettalls, by Compositions
and Materialls which we vse, and lay
ther for many years. Wee vse them also sometimes,
(which may seeme strange,) for Curing of
some Diseases, and for Prolongation of Life, in
some Hermits that choose to liue ther, well accommodated
of all things necessarie, and indeed liue
very long; By whom also we learne many things.
                  We haue Burialls in seuerall Earths, wher we
put diuerse Cements, as the Chineses doe their
Porcellane. But we haue them in greater Varietie,
and some of them more fine. We haue also
great variety of Composts, and Soiles, for the
Making of the Earth Fruitfull.
                  We haue High Towers; The Highest about
halfe a Mile in Heigth; And some of them likewise
set vpon High Mountaines: So that the Vantage
of the Hill with the Tower, is in the highest
of them three Miles at least. And these
Places wee call the Vpper Region; Accounting
the Aire betweene the High Places, and the

                     Lowe, as a Middle Region. VVee vse these
Towers, according to their seuerall Heights, and
Situations, for Insolation, Refrigeration, Conseruation;
And for the View of diuers Meteors,
As Windes, Raine, Snow, Haile; And some
of the Fiery Meteors also. And vpon them, in
some Places, are Dwellings of Hermits, whom
wee visit sometimes, and instruct what to obserue.
                  We haue great Lakes, both Salt, and Fresh;
wherof we haue vse for the Fish, and Fowle. We
vse them also for Burialls of some Naturall Bodies:
For we finde a Difference in Things buried
in Earth, or in Aire below the Earth; and things
buried Water. VVe haue also Pooles, of which
some doe straine Fresh Water out of Salt; And
others by Art doe turne Fresh Water into Salt.
VVe haue also some Rocks in the Midst of the Sea;
And some Bayes vpon the Shore for some Works,
wherin is required the Ayre and Vapour of the
Sea. VVe haue likewise Violent Streames and
Cataracts, which serue vs for many Motions:
And likewise Engines for Multiplying and Enforcing
of VVindes, to set also on going diuerse
Motions.
                  
                  VVe haue also a Number of Artificiall VVels,
and Fountaines, made in Imitation of the Naturall
Sources and Baths; As tincted vpon Vitrioll,
Sulphur, Steele, Brasse, Lead, Nitre, and
other Mineralls. And againe wee haue little

                     VVells for Infusions of many Things, wher the
VVaters take the Vertue quicker and better, then
in Vessels, or Basins. And amongst them we haue
a VVater, which wee call VVater of Paradise,
being, by that we doe to it, made very Soueraigne
for Health, and Prolongation of Life.
                  
                  We haue also Great and Spatious Houses, wher
we imitate and demonstrate Meteors; As Snow,
Haile, Raine, some Artificiall Raines of Bodies,
and not of VVater, Thunders, Lightnings; Also
Generations of Bodies in Aire; As Froggs,
Flies, and diuerse Others.
                  We haue also certaine Chambers, which wee
call Chambers of Health, wher wee qualifie the
Aire as we thinke good and proper for the Cure of
diuerse Diseases, and Preseruation of Health.
                  
                  We haue also faire and large Baths, of seuerall
Mixtures, for the Cure of Diseases, and the
Restoring of Mans Body from Arefaction: And
Others for the Confirming of it in Strength of
Sinnewes, Vitall Parts, and the very Iuyce and
Substance of the Body.
                  
                  We haue also large and various Orchards, and
Gardens; Wherin we do not so much respect Beauty,
as Variety of Ground and Soyle, proper for diuerse
Trees, and Herbs: And some very spatious, wher
Trees, and Berries are set, wherof we make diuerse
Kinds of Drinks, besides the Vine-yards. In
these wee practise likewise all Conclusions of Grafting,
and Inoculating, as well of VVilde-Trees,
                     
as Fruit-Trees, which produceth many Effects. And
we make (by Art) in the same Orchards, and
Gardens, Trees and Flowers, to come earlier, or
later, then their Seasons; And to come vp and
beare more speedily then by their Naturall Course
they doe. We make them also by Art greater much
then their Nature; And their Fruit greater, and
sweeter, and of differing Tast, Smell, Colour,
and Figure, from their Nature. And many of
them we so Order as they become of Medicinall
Vse.
                  
                  Wee haue also Meanes to make diuerse Plants,
rise by Mixtures of Earths without Seedes; And
likewise to make diuerse New Plants, differing
from the Vulgar; and to make one Tree or Plant
turne into another.
                  We haue also Parks, and Enclosures of all Sorts,
of Beasts, and Birds; which wee vse not onely for
View or Rarenesse, but likewise for Dissections,
and Trialls; That therby we may take light, what
may be wrought vpon the Body of Man. Wherin
we finde many strange Effects; As Continuing
Life in them, though diuerse Parts, which you
acount Vitall, be perished, and taken forth; Resussitating
of some that seeme Dead in Appearance;
And the like. We try also all Poysons,
and other Medicines vpon them, as well of Chyrurgery,
as Phisicke. By Art likewise, we make
them Greater, or Taller, then their Kinde is; And
contrary-wise Dwarfe them and stay their Grouth:
                     
Wee make them more Fruitfull, and Bearing then
their Kind is; And contrary-wise Barren and not
Generatiue. Also we make them differ in Colour,
Shape, Actiuity, many wayes. We finde Meanes
to make Commixtures and Copulations of diuerse
Kindes; which haue produced many New Kindes,
and them not Barren, as the generall Opinion is.
We make a Number of Kindes, of Serpents,
Wormes, Flies, Fishes, of Putrefaction; Wherof
some are aduanced (in effect) to be Perfect Creatures,
like Beastes or Birds; And haue Sexes, and
doe Propagate. Neither doe we this by Chance,
but wee know before hand, of what Matter and
Commixture, what Kinde of those Creatures
will arise.
                  Wee haue also Particular Pooles, wher we make
Trialls vpon Fishes, as we haue said before of Beasts,
and Birds.
                  
                  We haue also Places for Breed and Generation
of those Kindes of Wormes, and Flies, which
are of Speciall Vse; Such as are with you your Silkwormes,
and Bees.
                  
                  I will not hold you long with recounting of our
Brew-Howses, Bake-Howses, and Kitchins,
wher are made diuerse Drinks, Breads, and Meats,
Rare, and of speciall effects. Wines we haue of
Grapes; And Drinkes of other Iuyce, of Fruits,
of Graines, and of Rootes; And of Mixtures
with Honey, Sugar, Manna, and Fruits dryed,
and decocted: Also of the Teares or Woundings,
                     
of Trees; And of the Pulp of Canes. And
these Drinkes are of seuerall Ages, some to the
Age or Last of fourtie yeares. We haue Drinks
also brewed with seuerall Herbs, and Roots, and
Spices; Yea with seuerall Fleshes, and WhiteMeates;
Wherof some of the Drinkes are such,
as they are in effect Meat and Drinke both: So
that Diuerse, especially in Age, doe desire to liue
with them, with little or no Meate, or Bread. And
aboue all wee striue to haue Drinks of Extreame
Thin Parts, to insinuate into the Body, and yet
without all Biting, Sharpenesse, or Fretting; Insomuch
as some of them, put vpon the Back of your
Hand, will, with a little stay, passe through to the
Palme, and yet taste Milde to the Mouth. Wee
haue also VVaters, which we ripen in that fashion,
as they become Nourishing; So that they are indeed
excellent Drinke; And Many will vse no
other.Breads we haue of seuerall Graines, Roots,
and Kernells; Yea and some of Flesh, and
Fish, Dryed; With diuerse kindes of Leauenings,
and Seasonings: So that some doe extreamely
moue Appetites; Some doe Nourish so,
as diuerse doe liue of them, without any other
Meate; Who liue very long. So for Meates,
wee haue some of them so beaten, and made tender,
and mortified, yet without all Corrupting,
as a VVeake Heate of the Stomach will turne
them into good Chylus; As well as a Strong
Heate would Meate otherwise prepared. We haue

some Meates also, and Breads, and Drinks, which
taken by Men, enable them to Fast long after;
And some other, that vsed make the very Flesh of
Mens Bodies, sensibly, more Hard and Tough;
And their Strength farre greater, then otherwise
it would bee.
                  Wee haue Dispensatories, or Shops of Medicines.
Wherin you may easely thinke, if we haue
such Variety of Plants, and Liuing Creatures,
more then you haue in Europe, (for we know what
you haue,) the Simples, Druggs, and Ingredients
of Medicines, must likewise be in so much the
greater Variety. Wee haue them likewise of diuerse
Ages, and long Fermentations. And for
their Preparations, wee haue not onely all Manner
of Exquisite Distillations, and Separations, and
especially by Gentle Heates, and Percolations
through diuerse Strainers, yea and Substances;
But also exact Formes of Composition, wherby
they incorporate allmost, as they were Naturall
Simples.
                  
                  Wee haue also diuerse Mechanicall Arts, which
you haue not; And Stuffes made by them; As
Papers, Linnen, Silks, Tissues; dainty VVorks
of Feathers of wonderfull Lustre; excellent Dies,
and many others: And Shops likewise, as well
for such as are not brought into Vulgar vse amongst
vs, as for those that are. For you must know, that
of the Things before recited, many of them are
growne into vse throughout the Kingdome; But

yet, if they did flow from our Inuention, wee
haue of them also for Patternes and Principalls.
                  
                  Wee haue also Fournaces of great Diuersities,
and that keepe great Diuersitie of Heates:
Fierce and Quicke; Strong and Constant;
Soft and Milde; Blowne, Quiet, Dry, Moist;
And the like. But aboue all we haue Heates, in
Imitation of the Sunnes and Heauenly Bodies
Heates, that passe diuerse Inequalities, and (as it
were) Orbs, Progresses, and Returnes, wherby
we produce admirable effects. Besides wee haue
Heates of Dungs; and of Bellies and Mawes of
Liuing Creatures, and of their Blouds, and Bodies;
and of Hayes and Herbs layd vp moist; of
Lime vnquenched; and such like. Instruments
also which generate Heate onely by Motion. And
further, Places for Strong Insolations; And againe
Places vnder the Earth, which by Nature,
or Art, yeeld Heate. These diuerse Heates wee
vse, As the Nature of the Operation, which wee
intend, requireth.
                  Wee haue also Perspectiue-Houses, wher wee
make Demonstrations of all Lights, and Radiations:
And of all Colours: And out of Things
vncoloured and Transparent, wee can represent
vnto you all seuerall Colours; Not in RaineBowes,
(as it is in Gemms, and Prismes,) but of
themselues Single. Wee represent also all Multiplications
of Light, which wee carry to great Distance,
and make so Sharp, as to discerne small

                     Points and Lines. Also all Colourations of
Light; All Delusions and Deceits of the Sight, in
Figures, Magnitudes, Motions, Colours: All
Demonstrations of Shadowes. Wee finde also
diuerse Meanes yet vnknowne to you, of Producing
of Light, originally, from diuerse Bodies. Wee
procure meanes of Seeing Obiects a-farr off; As in
the Heauen, and Remote Places: And represent
Things Neare; as A-farr off; And Things A-farr
off as Neare; Making Faigned Distances. Wee
haue also Helps for the Sight, farr aboue Spectacles
and Glasses in vse. Wee haue also Glasses and
Meanes, to see Small and Minute Bodies, perfectly
and distinctly; As the Shapes and Colours
of Small Flies and Wormes, Graines and Flawes
in Gemmes which cannot otherwise be seen, Obseruations
in Vrine &amp; Bloud not otherwise to be seen.
Wee make Artificiall Raine-Bowes, Halo's, and
Circles about Light. Wee represent also all manner
of Reflexions, Refractions, and Multiplications

                     Wee haue also Sound-Houses, wher wee practise
and demonstrate all Sounds, and their Generation.
Wee haue Harmonies which you haue not, of Quarter-Sounds,
and lesser Slides of Sounds. Diuerse
Instruments of Musick likewise to you vnknowne,

Bells and Rings that are dainty and sweet.
Wee represent Small Sounds as Great and Deepe;
Likewise Great Sounds, Extenuate and Sharpe;
Wee make diuerse Tremblings and Warblings of
Sounds, which in their Originall are Entire. Wee
represent and imitate all Articulate Sounds and
Letters, and the Voices and Notes of Beasts and
Birds. Wee haue certaine Helps, which sett to the
Eare doe further the Hearing greatly. Wee haue
also diuerse, Strange and Artificiall Eccho's, Reflecting
the Voice many times, and as it were Tossing
it: And some that giue back the Voice Lowder
then it came; some Shriller, and some Deeper;
Yea some rendring the Voice, Differing in
the Letters or Articulate Sound, from that they
receyue. Wee haue also meanes to conuey Sounds
in Trunks and Pipes, in strange Lines, and
Distances.
                  
                  Wee haue also Perfume-Houses; wherwith we
ioyne also Practises of Tast. VVe Multiply
Smells, which may seeme strange. VVe Imitate
Smells, making all Smells to breath out of other
Mixtures then those that giue them. VVe make
diuerse Imitations of Tast likewise 
                        •
                      so that they

will deceyue any Mans Tast. And in this House
wee containe also a Confiture-House, wher wee
make all Sweet-Meats, Dry and Moist; And
diuerse pleasant Wines, Milks, Broaths, and
Sallets, farr in greater variety, then you haue.
                  Wee haue also Engine-Houses, wher are prepared
Engines and Instruments for all Sorts of
Motions. Ther we imitate and practise to make
Swifter Motions, then any you haue, either
out of your Musketts, or any Engine that you
haue: And to Make them, and Multiply
them more Easily, and with Small Force, by
VVheeles, and other Meanes: And to make
them Stronger, and more Violent, then yours are;
Exceeding your greatest Cannons, and Basilisks.
Wee represent also Ordnance and Instruments

                  Wee haue also Houses of Deceits of the Senses;
wher we represent all manner of Feates of Iugling,
False Apparitions, Impostures, and Illusions:
And their Fallaces. And surely you will
easily beleeue, that wee, that haue so many Things
truely Naturall, which induce Admiration, could
in a World of Particulars deceiue the Senses, if
wee would disguise those Things, and labour to
make them seeme more Miraculous. But we
doe hate all Impostures, and Lies: Insomuch as
wee haue seuerely forbidden it to all our Fellowes,
vnder paine of Ignominy and Eines, that they doe
not shew any Naturall worke or Thing, Adorned
or Swelling; but onely Pure as it is, and
without all Affectation of Strangenesse.
                  
                  These are (my Sonne) the Riches of Salomons
House.
                  
                  For the seuerall Employments and Offices
of our Fellowes; Wee haue Twelue that Sayle
into Forraine Countries, vnder the Names of
other Nations, (for our owne wee conceale;)
Who bring vs the Bookes, and Abstracts, and
Patternes of Experiments of all other Parts.
                     
These wee call Merchants of Light.
                  
                  Wee haue Three that Collect the Experiments
which are in all Bookes. These wee call Depredatours.
                  
                  Wee haue Three that Collect the Experiments
of all Mechanicall Arts; And also of
Liberall Sciences; And also of Practises which
are not Brought into Arts. These we call Mystery-Men.
                  
                  Wee haue Three that try New Experiments,
such as themselues thinke good. These wee call
Pioners or Miners.
                  
                  Wee haue Three that Drawe the Experiments
of the Former Foure into Titles, and Tables, to
giue the better light, for the drawing of Obseruations
and Axiomes out of them. These wee call
Compilers.
                  
                  Wee haue Three that bend themselues, Looking
into the Experiments of their Fellowes,
and cast about how to draw out of them Things
of Vse, and Practise for Mans life, and Knowledge
as well for VVorkes, as for Plaine Demonstration
of Causes, Meanes of Naturall
Diuinations, and the easie and cleare Discouery,
of the Vertues and Parts of Bodies. These wee
call Dowry-men or Benefactours.
                  
                  Then after diuerse Meetings and Consults of
our whole Number, to consider of the former Labours
and Collections, wee haue Three that take
care, out of them, to Direct New Experiments, of a

Higher Light, more Penetrating into Nature
then the Former. These wee call Lamps.
                  
                  Wee haue Three others that doe Execute the
Experiments so Directed, and Report them.
These wee call Inoculatours.
                  
                  Lastly, wee haue Three that raise the former
Discoueries by Experiments, into Greater Obseruations,
Axiomes, and Aphorismes. These
wee call Interpreters of Nature.
                  
                  Wee haue also, as you must thinke, Nouices
and Apprentices, that the Succession of the former
Employed Men doe not faile; Besides, a
great Number of Seruants and Attendants,
Men and Women. And this we doe also: We
haue Consultations, which of the Inuentions and
Experiences, which wee haue discouered, shall
be Published, and which not: And take all an
Oath of Secrecy, for the Concealing of those
which wee thinke fitt to keepe Secrett: Though
some of those we doe reuease sometimes to the State,
and some not.
                  For our Ordinances and Rites: Wee haue
two very Long, and Faire Galleries: In one of
these wee place Patternes and Samples of all
manner of the more Rare and Excellent Inuentions:
In the other wee place the Statuas of all
Principall Inuentours. These wee haue the Statua
of your Columbus, that discouered the

                     West-Indies: Also the Inuentour of Shipps:
Your Monke that was the Inuentour of Ordnance,
and of Gunpowder: The Inuentour of Musicke:
The Inuentour of Letters; The Inuentour
of Printing: The Inuentour of Obseruations
of Astronomy: The Inuentour of Works
in Mettall: The Inuentour of Glasse: The Inuentour
of Silke of the VVorne: The Inuentour
of VVine: The Inuentour of Corne and
Bread: The Inuentour of Sugars: And all
these, by more certaine Tradition, then you haue.
Then haue we diuerse Inuentours of our Owne,
of Excellent VVorkes: Which since you haue
not seene, it were too long to make Descriptions of
them; And besides, in the right Vnderstanding
of those Descriptions, you might easily erre. For
vpon euery Inuention of Valew, wee erect a Statua
to the Inuentour, and giue him a Liberall and
Honourable Reward. These Statua's are, some
of Brasse; some of Marble and Touchstone;
some of Cedar and other speciall VVoods guilt
and adorned; some of Iron; some of Siluer; Some
of Gold.
                  
                  Wee haue certaine Hymnes and Seruices, which
wee say dayly, of Laud and Thanks to GOD, for
his Marueillous VVorks: And Formes of Prayers
imploring his Aide and Blessing, for the Illumination
of our Labours, and the Turning of
them into Good and Holy Vses.
                  
                  Lastly, wee haue Circuites or Visits of diuers

Principall Citties of the Kingdome; wher, as it
commeth to passe, we doe publish such New Profitable
Inuentions, as wee thinke good. And wee
doe also declare Naturall Diuinations of Diseases,
Plagues, Swarmes of Hurtfull Creatures,
Scarcety, Tempests, Earthquakes, Great Inundations,
Cometts, Temperature of the Yeare,
and diuerse other Things; And wee giue Counsell
thereupon, what the People shall doe, for the
Preuention and Remedy of them.
                  And when Hee had sayd this, Hee stood vp: And I,
as I had beene taught, kneeled downe, and He layd his
Right Hand vpon my Head, and said; GOD blesse thee,
my Sonne; And GOD blesse this Relation, which I haue
made. I giue thee leaue to Publish it, for the Good of other
Nations; For wee here are in GODS Bosome, a Land vnknowne.
And so hee left mee; Hauing assigned a Valew
about two Thousand Duckets, for a Bounty to
mee and my Fellowes. For they giue great Largesses,
they come, vpon all occasions.
                  The rest was not Perfected.
