            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            The Printer to the Reader.
            
               IT hath bin an old saying, that vvhiles tvvo
doggs do striue for a bone, the thirde may
come and carie it avvay. And this prouerbe
may (as I feare) be wel verefied in me which
take in hand the imprinting of this poeticall
Poesie. For the case seemeth doubtful, and I vvill disclose
my coniecture. Master. H. VV. in the beginning of this
worke, hath in his letter (vvritten to the Readers) cunningly
discharged himselfe of any such misliking, as the
grauer sort of grey heared iudgers mighte (perhaps) conceiue
in the publicatiō of these pleasant Pamphlets. And
nexte vnto that learned preamble, the letter of. G. T. (by
vvhome as seemeth, the first coppie hereof vvas vnto the
same. H. VV. deliuered, doth with no lesse clerkly cūning
seeke to persvvade the readers, that he (also) vvoulde by
no meanes haue it published. Novv I feare very muche
(all these vvords notvvithstāding) that these tvvo gentlemen
vvere of one assent compact to haue it imprinted:
And yet, finding by experiēce that nothing is so vvel hādled
novv adayes, but that some malicious minds may either
take occasion to mislike it themselues, or else finde
meanes to make it odious vnto others: They haue therefore
(each of them) politiquely preuented the daunger of
misreport, and suffered me the poore Printer to runne avvay
vvith the palme of so perillous a victorie. Notwithstanding,
hauing vvel perused the vvorke, I find nothing
therein amisse (to my iudgemente) vnlesse it be tvvo or
three vvanton places passed ouer in the discourse of an amorous
enterprise: The vvhich for as much as the vvords

are cleanly (although the thing ment be somevvhat naturall)
I haue thought good also to let them passe as they
came to me, and the rather bicause (as master. H. VV.
hath vvell alleadged in his letter to the Reader) the well
minded mā may reape some commoditie out of the most
friuolous vvorks that are vvritten. And as the venemous
spider vvil sucke poison out of the most holesome herbe,
and the industrious Bee can gather hony out of the most
stinking vveede: Euen so the discrete reader may take a
happie exāple by the most lasciuious histories, although
the captious and harebraind heads can neither be encoraged
by the good, nor forevvarned by the bad. And thus
muche I haue thought good to say in excuse of some sauours,
which may perchance smell vnpleasantly to some
noses, in some part of this poeticall poesie. Novv it hath
vvith this fault a greater commoditie than common poesies
haue ben accustomed to present, and that is this, you
shall not be constreined to smell of the floures therein cō
               teined
all at once, neither yet to take them vp in such order
as they are sorted: But you may take any one flowre
by it selfe, and if that smell not so pleasantly as you vvold
wish, I doubt not yet but you may find some other which
may supplie the defects thereof. As thus, he vvhich wold
haue good morall lessons clerkly handled, let him smell
to the Tragedie translated out of Euripides. He that wold
laugh at a prety conceit closely conueyed, let him peruse
the comedie translated out of Ariosto. He that vvould
take example by the vnlavvfull affections of a louer bestovved
vppon an vnconstant dame, let them reade the
report in verse, made by Dan Bartholmevv of Bathe, or
the discourse in prose of the aduentures passed by master

F. I. vvhome the reader may name Freeman Iones, for
the better vnderstanding of the same: he that vvould see
any particuler pang of loue liuely displayed, may here approue
euery Pamphlet by the title, and so remaine contented.
As also diuers godly himnes and Psalmes may in
like manner be founde in this recorde. To conclude,
the worke is so vniuersall, as either in one place or
other, any mans mind may therevvith be satisfied.
The vvhich I aduenture (vnder
pretext of this promise) to present
vnto all indifferent eyes
as follovveth.

               The Prologue or argument.
               
                  I Suppose you are assembled here, supposing
to reape the fruite of my trauayles: and to be
playne, I meane presently to presente you
vvith a Comedie called Supposes, the verye
name vvherof may peraduenture driue into euery of
your heades a sundry Suppose, to suppose the meaning
of our supposes. Some percase vvill suppose we
meane to occupie your eares vvith sophisticall handling
of subtill Suppositions. Some other vvill suppose
vve go about to discipher vnto you some queint conceiptes,
vvhich hitherto haue bene onely supposed
as it vvere in shadovves: and some I see smyling as
though they supposed vve vvould trouble you vvith
the vaine suppose of some vvanton Suppose. But vnderstand,
this our Suppose is nothing else but a mystaking
or imagination of one thing for an other: for
you shall see the master supposed for the seruant, the
seruant for the master: the freeman for a slaue, and
the bondslaue for a freeman: the stranger for a vvell
knovven friend, and the familiar for a stranger. But
vvhat? I suppose that euen already you suppose me
very fonde, that haue so simply disclosed vnto you
the subtilties of these our Supposes: vvhere othervvise
in deede I suppose you shoulde haue hearde
almoste the laste of our Supposes, before you coulde
haue supposed anye of them arighte. Let this then
suffise.
            
            
               
               Supposes.

                  Scena. j.
                  BALIA, the Nourse. POLYNESTA, the yong vvoman.
                  
                     HEre is no body, come foorth Polynesta, let vs
looke about, to be sure least any man heare our
talke: for I thinke within the house the tables,
the plankes, the beds, the portals, yea and the
cupbords them selues haue eares.
                  
                     Pol.
                     You might as well haue sayde, the windowes and
the doores: do you not sée howe they harken?
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     Well you iest faire, but I would aduise you take
héede, I haue bidden you a thousande times beware, you
will be spied one day talking with Dulippo.
                     
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     And why should I not talke with Dulippo as well
as with any other, I pray you?
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     I haue giuen you a wherfore for this why many
times, but go too, followe your owne aduise till you ouerwhelme
vs all with soden mishappe.
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     A great mishappe I promise you: marie Gods
blessing on their heart that sette suche a brouche on my
cappe.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     Well, looke well about you: a man would thinke
it were inough for you secretly to reioyce, that by my helpe
you haue passed so many pleasant nightes togither, and yet
by my trouth I do it more than halfe agaynst my will, for
I would rather you had setled your fansie in some noble familie,
yea and it is no small griefe vnto me, that reiecting
the suites of so many nobles and gentlemen, you haue chosen
for your darling a poore seruaunt of your fathers, by
whome shame and infamie is the best dower you can looke
for to attayne.
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     And I pray you whome may I thanke but gentle
nourse, that continually praysing him, what for his personage,
his curtesie, and aboue all, the extreme passions of

his minde, in fine you would neuer cease till I accepted
him, delighted in him, and at length desired him with no
lesse affection, than he earst desired me.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     I can not denie, but at the beginning I did recommende
him vnto you (as in déede I may say that for my
selfe I haue a pitiful heart) séeing the depth of his vnbridled
affection, and that continually he neuer ceassed to fill mine
eares with lamentable complaynts.
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     Nay rather that he filled your pursse with bribes
and rewards.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     Well you may iudge of Nourse as you liste: In déede
I haue thought it alwayes a déede of charitie to helpe
the miserable yong men, whose tender youth consumeth
with the furious flames of loue: but be you sure if I had
thought you would haue passed to the termes you nowe
stande in, pitie nor pencion, peny nor pater noster shoulde
euer haue made Nurse once to opē hir mouth in the cause.
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     No of honestie, I pray you, who first brought him
into my chamber? who first taught him the way to my bed
but you? fie Nourse fie, neuer speake of it for shame, you
will make me tell a wise tale anone.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     And haue I these thanks for my good wil? why then
I sée wel I shall be counted the cause of all mishappe.
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     Nay rather the author of my good happe gentle
Nourse, for I would thou knewest I loue not Dulipo,
nor any of so meane estate, but haue bestowed my loue
more worthily than thou déemest, but I will say no more
at this time.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     Then I am glad you haue changed your minde yet.
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     Nay I neither haue changed, nor will change it.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     Then I vnderstande you not, how sayde you?
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     Mary I say that I loue not Dulipo, nor any
suche as he, and yet I neither haue changed nor wil change
my minde.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     I can not tell, you loue to lye with Dulipo very

well: this geare is Gréeke to me, either it hangs not well
togither, or I am very dull of vnder standing, speake plaine
I pray you.
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     I can speake no plainer, I haue sworne to y• cōtrary.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     Howe? make you so deintie to tell it Nourse, least
she shoulde reueale it? you haue trusted me as farre as
may be, I may shewe to you, in things that touche your
honor if they were knowne: and make you strange to tell
me this? I am sure it is but a trifle in comparison of those
things wherof heretofore you haue made me priuie.
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     Well, it is of greater importance than you thinke
Nourse, yet would I tell it you vnder condition and promise
that you shall not tell it agayne, nor giue any signe
or token to be suspected that you know it.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     I promise you of my honestie, say on.
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     Well heare you me then: this yong man whome
you haue alwayes taken for Dulipo, is a noble borne
Sicilian, his right name Erostrato, sonne to Philogono, one
of the worthiest men in that countrey.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     How Erostrato? is it not our neighbour, whiche?
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     Holde thy talking nourse, and harken to me, that I
may explane the whole case vnto thée: the man whome to
this day you haue supposed to be Dulipo, is (as I say) Erostrato,
a gentleman that came from Sicilia to studie in this
Citie, &amp; euen at his first arriuall met me in the stréet, fel enamored
of me, &amp; of suche vehement force were the passions
he suffred, that immediatly he cast aside both long gowne
and bookes, &amp; determined on me only to apply his study: and
to the end he might the more cōmodiously bothe sée me and
talke with me, he exchanged both name, habite, clothes and
credite with his seruāt Dulipo, whō only he brought with
him out of Sicilia, and so with the turning of a hand, of Erostrato
a gentleman, he became Dulipo a seruing man, and
soone after sought seruice of my father, and obteyned it.
                  
                  
                     Ba
                     Are you sure of this?
                  
                  
                     
                     Po.
                     Yea out of doubt, on the other side Dulippo took
                           •
                        
vppon him the name of Erostrato his maister, the habite,
the credite, bookes, and all things néedefull to a studente,
and in shorte space profited very muche, and is nowe estéemed
as you sée.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     Are there no other Sicylians héere: nor none that
passe this way, which may discouer them?
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     Uery fewe that passe this way, and fewe or none
that tarrie héere any time.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     This hath béen a straunge aduenture, but I pray
you howe hang these thinges togither? that the studente
whome you say to be the seruant, and not the maister, is
become an earnest suter to you, and requireth you of your
father in mariage?
                  
                  
                     Po.
                     That is a pollicie deuised betwéene them, to put
Doctor Dotipole out of conceite, the olde dotarde, he that
so instantly dothe lye vpon my father for me: but looke
where he comes, as God helpe me it is he, out vpon him,
what a luskie yonker is this? yet I had rather be a Noonne
a thousande times, than be combred with suche a Coystrell.
                  
                  
                     Ba.
                     Daughter you haue reason, but let vs go in before
he come any néerer.
                  
                  Polynesta goeth in, and Balya stayeth a little vvhyle
after, speaking a vvorde or tvvo to the doctor, and
then departeth.
               
               
                  Scena. ij.
                  CLEANDER, Doctor. PASIPHILO, Parasite.
BALYA, Nourse.
                  WEre there dames héere, or did mine eyes dazil?
                  
                     Pa.
                     Nay syr héere were Polynesta and hir nourse.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Was my Polynesta héere? alas I knewe hir not.
                  
                  
                     Ba.

                     Yes sir an excellent good Bibler, specially in a bottle:
Oh what a mounte of Uenus here is, but this lighte
serueth not very well, I will beholde it an other day, whē
the ayre is clearer, and tell you somewhat, peraduenture
to your contentation.

                     You shal do me great pleasure: but tell me, I pray
thé

                        Pasiphilo, whome doste thou thinke Polynesta liketh
better, Erostrato or me?
                  
                  
                     
                     Pa.
                     Why you out of doubt: She is a gentlewoman
of a noble minde, and maketh greater accompte of the reputation
she shall haue in marrying your worship, than
that poore scholer, whose birthe and parentage God knoweth,
and very fewe else.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Yet he taketh it vpon him brauely in the countrey.
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     Yea, where no man knoweth the cōtrarie: but let
him braue it, bost his birth, and do what he can, the vertue
and knowledge that is within this body of yours, is worth
more than all the countrey he came from.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     It becommeth not a man to prayse himselfe: but
in déede I may say, and say truely, that my knowledge
hath stoode me in better stéede at a pinche, than coulde all
the goodes in the worlde. I came out of Otranto when the
Turkes wonne it, and first I came to Padua, after hither;
where by reading, counsailing, and pleading, within twentie
yeres I haue gathered and gayned as good as ten thousande
Ducats.
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     Yea mary, this is the righte knowledge, Philosophie,
Poetrie, Logike, and all the rest, are but pickling sciences
in comparison to this.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     But pyckling in déede, whereof we haue a verse:
                     The trade of Lavve doth fill the boystrous bagges,
                     They svvimme in silke, vvhen others royst in ragges.
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     O excellent verse, who made it? Virgil?
                     
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     
                        Virgil? tushe it is written in one of our gloses.
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     Sure who so euer wrote it, the moral is excellent,
and worthy to be written in letters of golde: but to the
purpose: I thinke you shall neuer recouer the wealth that
you loste at Otranto.
                     
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     I thinke I haue doubled it, or rather made it foure
times as muche: but in déed, I lost mine only sonne there,
a childe of fiue yeres olde.
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     O great pitie.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Yea, I had rather lost all the goods in the worlde.

                     Alas, alas, by God and grafts of such a stocke are
very gayson in these dayes.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     I know not whether he were slayue, or the Turks
toke him and kept him as a bond slaue.
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     Alas, I could wéepe for compassion, but there is no
remedy but patience, you shall get many by this yong damsell
with the grace of God.

                     Yea, if I get hir.
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     Get hir? why doubt you of that?
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Why, hir father holds me off with delayes, so that
I must néedes doubte.

                     Content your selfe sir, he is a wise man, and desirous
to place his Daughter well, he will not be too rashe in hys
determination, he will thinke well of the matter, and lette
him thinke, for the longer he thinketh, the more good of you
shall he thinke: whose welth, whose vertue, whose skill, or
whose estimation can he compare to yours in this Citie?
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     And hast thou not tolde him that I would make his
Daughter a dower of two thousand Ducates?
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     Why, euen now, I came but from thence since.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     What saide he?
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     Nothing, but that Erostrato had profered the like.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     
                        Erostrato? how can he make any dower, and his father
yet aliue?
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     Thinke you I did not tell him so? yes I warrāt you,
I forgot nothing that may furder your cause, and doubt you
not, Erostrato shal neuer haue hir vnlesse it be in a dreame.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Well gentle Pasiphilo; go thy waies and tell Damon
I require nothing but his daughter, I will none of his
goods: I shal enrich hir of mine owne: &amp; if this dower of two
thousand Ducats séem not sufficiēt, I wil make it fiue hundreth
more, yea a thousand, or what so euer he will demānd
rather thē faile: go to Pasiphilo, shew thy selfe frēdly in working
this feate for me, spare for no cost, since I haue gone
thus farre, I wil be loth to be out

                  O Miserable couetous wretche, he findeth an excuse by
S Nicholas fast, because I should not dine with him,
as though I should dine at his owne dishe: he maketh goodly
feasts I promise you, it is no wonder though he thinke
me bounde vnto him for my fare: for ouer and besides that
his prouision is as skant as may be, yet there is great difference

betwéene his diet and mine. I neuer so much as s
                        •
                     ppe
of the wyne that he tasteth, I feede at the bords ende with
broune bread: Marie I reach always to his owne dishe, for
there are no more but that only on the table: Yet he thinks
that for one such diner I am bound to do him al the seruice
that I can, and thinks me sufficiently rewarded for all my
trauell, with one suche festiuall promotion: and yet peraduenture
some men thinke I haue great gaynes vnder him:
but I may say and sweare, that this dosen yere I haue not
gayned so muche in value as the poynts at my hose (which
are but thrée with codpéece poynt and al): he thinks that I
may féede vpon his fauour and fayre words: but if I could
not otherwise prouide for one, Pasiphilo were in a wyse
case. Pasiphilo hath mo pastures to passe in than one, I
warrant you: I am of housholde with this scholer Erostrato,
his riuale, as wel as with Domine Cleander, now with
the one, and then with the other, according as I sée their
Caters prouide good chéere at the market: and I finde the
meanes so to handle the matter, that I am welcome to
bothe. If the one sée me talke with the other, I make
him beléeue it is to harken newes in the furtherance of his
cause, and thus I become a broker on both sides. Well, let

déede I will trauell for none of them bothe: yet wyll I
séeme to worke wonders on eche hande. But is not this
one of Damons seruants that commeth foorth? it is, of him
I shall vnderstande where his master is. Whither goeth
this ioyly gallante?

                  Hard hap had I when I first begon this vnfortunate enterprise,
for I supposed the readiest medicine to my miserable
effect
                        •
                     s had bene to change name, clothes, &amp; credite with
my seruant, &amp; to place my selfe in Damons seruice, thinking
that as sheuering colde by glowing fire, thurst by drinke,
hunger by pleasant repasts, and a thousande suche like passions
finde remedie by their contraries, so my restles desire
might haue founde quiet by continuall contemplation. But
alas, I finde that only loue is vnsaciable, for as the flie playeth
with the flame till at last she is cause of hir owne decay,
so the louer that thinketh with kissing and colling to content
his vnbrideled apetite, is cōmonly sene the onely cause
of his owne consumption: Two yéeres are now paste since
vnder the colour of Damons seruice I haue bene a sworne
seruant to Cupid, of whō I haue receiued as muche fauour
&amp; grace as euer man founde in his seruice, I haue frée libertie
at al times to behold my desired, to talke with hir, to embrace
hir, yea (be it spoken in secrete) to lye with hir, I reape
the fruites of my desire, yet as my ioyes abounde, euen so

my paines encrease, I fare like the couetous man, that hauing
all the worlde at will, is neuer yet content, the more I
haue, the more I desire. Alas, what wretched estate haue I
brought my selfe vnto, if in the ende of all my farre fetches,
she be giuē by hir father to this olde doting doctor, this buzard,
this bribing villaine, that by so many meanes seketh to
obtaine hir at hir fathers hands? I know she loueth me best
of all others, but what may that preuaile when perforce she
shalbe constrained to marie another? Alas, y• pleasant taste
of my sugred ioyes doth yet remaine so perfect in my remē
                     brance,
that the least soppe of sorow séemeth more soure th

contentatiō might I haue passed these dreadful dolours.
And if this olde .M. impsimus (whom the pockes consume)
should wyn hir, then may I saye, farewell the pleasant talk,
the kind embracings, yea farewel the sight of my Polynesta,

to haue caste a blocke in his waye, by the meanes that
my seruaunt, who is supposed to be Erostrato, and with my
habite and credite is well estemed, should proffer himselfe a
suter, at the least to counteruaile the doctors profers: but
my maister knowing the wealth of the one, and doubting
the state of the other, is determined to be fed no longer with
faire wordes, but to accept the doctor, (whom he right well
knoweth) for his sonne in law: well, my seruaunt promised
me yesterday to deuise yet againe some newe conspiracie to
driue maister doctor out of conceite, and to laye a snare that
the foxe himselfe might be caughte in, what it is, I knowe
not, nor I saw him not since he went about it: I will goe sée
if he be within, that at least if he helpe me not, he maye yet
prolong my life for this once. But here commeth his lackie,

                     Ero.
                     Heare you me, yesternight in the euening I walked
out, and founde Pasiphilo, and with small entreating I
had him home to supper, where by suche meanes as I vsed,
he became my great friend, and tolde me the whole order
of our aduersaries determination: yea and what Damon
doth intende to do also, and hath promised me that frō
time to time, what he can espie he will bring me word of it.

                     I can not tel whether you know him or no, he is not
to trust vnto, a very flattering and a lying knaue.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     I know him very well, he can not deceiue me, and
this that he hath tolde me I know must néedes be true.

                     Ero.
                     Worsse? why what assurance coulde you suppose
that I might make without some speciall consent from Philogono
my father?
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Nay you can tell, you are better scholer than I.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     In déede you haue lost your time: for the books that
you tosse now a dayes, treate of smal science.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Leaue thy iesting, and procéede.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     I sayde further, that I receyued letters lately from
my father, whereby I vnderstoode that he woulde be héere
very shortly to performe all that I had profered: therfore I
required him to request Damō
                         on my behalf, that he would
stay his promise to the doctor for a fourthnight or more.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     This is somewhat yet, for by this meanes I shal be
sure to linger and liue in hope one fourthnight longer, but
at the fourthnights ende when Philogono commeth not,
how shall I then do? yea and though he came, howe may
I any way hope of his consent, when he shall sée, that to follow
this amorous enterprise, I haue set aside all studie, all
remembraunce of my duetie, and all dread of shame. Alas,
alas, I may go hang my selfe.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     Comforte your selfe man, and trust in me: there is
a salue for euery sore, and doubt you not, to this mischéefe
we shall finde a remedie.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     O friend reuiue me, that hitherto since I first attempted
this matter haue bene continually dying.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     Well, harken a while then: this morning I tooke
my horse and rode into the fieldes to solace my selfe, and as
I passed the foorde beyonds S. Anthonies gate, I met at the
foote of the hill a gentleman riding with two or thrée men,
and as me thought by his habite and his lookes, he should be

none of the wise
                           ••
                        . He saluted me, and I him: I asked him
from whence he came, and whither he would? he answered
that he had come from Venice, then from Padua, nowe
was going to Ferrara, and so to his countrey, whiche is
Scienna: As soone as I knowe him to be a Scenese, sodenly
lifting vp mine eyes, as it were with an admiration I sayd
vnto him, are you a Scenese, and come to Ferrara? why not,
sayde he: quoth I, halfe and more with a trembling voyce,
know you the daunger that should ensue if you be knowne
in Ferrara to be a Scenese? he more than halfe amased, desired
me earnestly to tell him what I ment.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     I vnderstande not wherto this tendeth.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     I beléeue you, but hearken to me.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Go too then.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     I answered him in this sorte: Gentleman, bicause
I haue heretofore founde very curteous entertaynement
in your countrey, béeing a student there, I accompt my selfe
as it were bounde to a Scenese, and therefore if I knewe of
any mishappe towards any of that countrey, God forbid but
I should disclose it: and I maruell that you knowe not of
the iniurie that your countreymen offered this other day to
the Embassadours of Countie Hercule.
                     
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     What tales he telleth me: what appertayne these
to me?
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     If you will harken a whyle, you shall finde them
no tales, but that they appertayne to you more than you
thinke for.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Foorth.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     I tolde him further, these Ambassadoures of
Countie Hercule had dyuers Mules, Waggons, and Charettes,
laden with diuers costly iewels, gorgious furniture,
&amp; other things which they caried as presents, passing that
way to the king of Naples▪
                         the which were not only stayd in
Sciene by the officers whō you cal Customers, but serched,
ransacked, tossed &amp; turned, &amp; in the end exacted for tribute, as

if they had bene the goods of a meane marchaunt.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Whither the diuell will he? is it possible that this
geare appertaineth any thing to my cause? I finde neither
head nor foote in it.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     O how impaciēt you are: I pray you stay a while.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Go to yet a while then.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     I procéeded, that vpon these causes the Duke sent
his Chauncelor to declare the case vnto the Senate there,
of whom he had the moste vncurteous answere that euer
was heard, whervpon he was so enraged with all of that
countrey, that for reuēge he had sworne to spoyle as many
of them as euer should come to Ferrara, and to sende them
home in their dublet and their hose.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     And I pray thée how couldest thou vpon the sudden
deuise or imagine suche a lye? and to what purpose?
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     You shall heare by and by a thing as fitte for our
purpose, as any could haue happened.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     I would fayne heare you conclude.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     You would fayne leape ouer the stile, before you
come at the hedge: I woulde you had heard me, and séene
the gestures that I enforced to make him beléeue this.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     I beléeue you, for I know you can counterfet well.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     Further I sayde, the duke had charged vpon great
penalties, that the Inholders and vitlers shoulde bring
worde dayly of as many Sceneses as came to their houses:
the gentlemā béeing (as I gessed at the first) a man of smal
sapientia, when he heard these newes, would haue turned
his horse an other way.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     By likelyhoode he was not very wise when he
would beléeue that of his cūntrey, which if it had bene true,
euery man must néedes haue knowen it.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     Why not? when he had not béene in his countrey
for a moneth paste, and I tolde him this had hapned within
these seuen dayes.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Belike he was of small experience.
                  
                  
                     
                     Ero.
                     I thinke, of as litle as maye be: but beste of all for
our purpose, and good aduenture it was, that I mette with
suche an one. Now harken I pray thée.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Make an ende I pray thée.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     He, as I say, when he hard these words, would haue
turned the bridle, &amp; I say
                           •
                        ing a countenance as thoughe I
were somewhat pensiue &amp; carefull for him, passed a while,
and after with a great sighe saide to him: gentleman, for the
curtesie that (as I said) I haue founde in your countrey, and
because youre affaires shall be the better dispatched, I will
finde the meanes to lodge you in my house, and you shall
saye to euerye man, that you are a Sicilan of Cathanea, your
name Philogono, father to me that am in dede of that countrey
and citie, called here Erostrato: and I (to pleasure you)
will (during youre abode here) doe you reuerence as you
were my father.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Out vpon me, what a grosse hedded foole am I? now
I perceiue whereto this tale tendeth.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     Well, and how like you of it?
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Indifferently, but one thing I doubt.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     What is that?
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Marie, that when he hathe bene here two or thrée
dayes, he shal heare of euery man that there is no such thing
betwene the Duke and the Towne of Sciene.
                     
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     As for that let me alone, I doe entertaine and will
entertaine him so wel, that within these two or thrée dayes
I will disclose vnto him all the whole matter, and doubte
not but to bring him in for performance of as muche as I
haue promised to Damon: for what hurte can it be to him,
when he shall binde a strange name and not his owne?
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     What, thinke you he will be entreated to stande
hounde for a dower of two thousand Ducates by the yeare?
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     Yea why not, if it were ten thousande, as long as he
is not in déede the man that is bounde?
                  
                  
                     Du.

purpose.

how can we doe any more?

shall lye in my house.

                  THis geare hath had no euill beginning, if it continue so
and fall to happie ende. But is not this the silly doctor
with the side bonet, the doting foole, that dare presume to
become a suter to such a péerlesse Paragons? O howe couetousnesse
doth blind the common sort of men: Damon more
desirous of the dower, than mindfull of his gentle &amp; gallant
daughter, hathe determined to make him his sonne in lawe
who for his age maye he his father in law, and hath greater
respect to the abundance of goods, than to his owne naturall
childe. He beareth well in minde to fill his owne purse, but
he litle remembreth that his daughters purse shalbe continually
emptie, vnlesse Maister Doctour fill it with double
ducke egges. Alas, I iest and haue no ioye, I will stand here
aside and laughe a litle at this lobcocke.
                  Dulippo espieth the Doctor and his man comming.

                     Cle.
                     I come to séeke Pasiphilo, to the ende he maye dyne
with me.
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     As though sixe mouthes and the cat for the seuenth,
be not sufficiente to eate an harlotrie shotterell, a pennieworthe
of chese, and halfe a score spurlinges, this is all the
dainties you haue dressed for you and your familie.
                  
                  
                     
                     Cle.
                     Ah gréedie gut, arte thou afearde thou shalt want?
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     I am afearde in déede, it is not the first time I haue
founde it so.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Shall I make some sporte with this gallant? what
shall I say to him?
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Thou arte afearde belike that he will eate thée and
the rest.
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     Nay, rather that he will eate your mule, both heare
and hyde.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Heare and hyde? and why not fleshe and all?
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     Bicause she hath none, if she had any fleshe, I thinke
you had eaten hir your selfe by this time.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     She may thanke you then, for your good attendance.
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     Nay she may thanke you for your small allowance.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     In faith now let me alone.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Holde thy peace drunken knaue, and espye me Pasiphilo.
                     
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Since I can doe no better, I will set such a staunce
betwéene him and Pasiphilo, that all this towne shall not
make them frendes.
                  
                  
                     Ca.
                     Coulde you not haue sent to séeke him, but you must
come your selfe? surely you come for some other purpose, for
if you would haue had Pasiphilo to dinner, I warant you he
would haue taried here an houre since.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Holde thy peace, here is one of Damons seruaunts,
of him I shall vnderstande where he is: good fellow arte not
thou one of Damons seruauntes?
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Yes sir, at your knamandement.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Gramercie, tell me then, hath Pasiphilo bene there
this day or no?
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Yes sir, and I thinke he be there still, ah, ah, ah.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     What laughest thou?
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     At a thing, that euery man may not laugh at.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     What?

                     Talke, that Pasiphilo had with my maister this day.
                  
                  
                     
                     Cle.
                     What talke I pray thée?

                     I may not tell it.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Doth it concerne me?
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Nay I will say nothing.

                     Tell me.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     I can say no more.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     I would but know if it concerne me, I praye thée tel

                     Du.
                     I would tell you, if I were sure you would not tell
it againe.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Beleue me I will kepe it close: Carion giue vs leaue

                     Du.
                     If my maister shoulde knowe that it came by me, I
were better die a thousande deathes.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     He shall neuer know it, say on.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     Yea, but what assurance shall I haue?
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     I lay thée my faith and honestie in paune.

                     A prettie paune, the fulkers will not lend you a farthing
on it.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Yea, but amongst honest men it is more worth than
golde.

                     Yea marie sir, but where be they? but will you nedes
haue me to tell it vnto you?

                     Du.
                     Yes it is of you, and I woulde gladly tell it you, bycause
I would not haue suche a man of worship so scorned
by a villaine ribaulde.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     I pray thée tell me then.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     I will tell you so that you will sweare neuer to tell
it to Pasiphilo, to my maister, nor to any other bodye.

                     If he knewe him as well as I, he woulde neuer goe

                     Cle.
                     And thou recknest it as madly: is it not Erostrato?

                     To whom?
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     To my maister, yea and to Polinesta herselfe sometimes.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Is it possible, Ah slaue, and what saith he?
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     More euill than I can imagine: that you are the miserablest
and most nigardly man that euer was.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Sayeth Pasiphilo so by me?
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     And that as often as he commeth to your house, he is
like to die for hunger, you fare so well.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     That the deuill take him else.
                  
                  
                     Du.
                     And that you are the testiest man, and most diuers to

                     You saye true sir, yet further he sayth, your arme

                     And he saith, that you desire this yong gentlewoman,
as much for other mens pleasure as for your owne.

be deuised? the thing once done can not be vndone. My
daughter is defloured, and vtterly dishonested, howe can I
then wype that blot off my browe? and on whome shall I
séeke reuenge? Alas, alas, I my selfe haue bene the cause of
all these cares, and haue deserued to beare the punishment
of all these mishappes. Alas, I should not haue committed
my dearest darling in custodie to so carelesse a creature as
this olde Nourse: for we sée by common proofe, that these
olde women be either péeuishe, or to pitifull: either easily
enclined to euill, or quickly corrupted with bribes and rewards.
O wife, my good wife (that nowe lyest colde in the

mourning nowe may I bemone that I misse thée: if thou

                        ed the clemencie of thy carefull father, and yet to
excuse thée giltlesse before God, and to condemne thée giltie
before the worlde, I can count none other but my wretched
selfe the caytife and causer of all my cares: for of all the dueties
that are requisite in humane lyfe, onely obedience is
by the parents to be required of the childe, where on ye other

side the parēts are bound, first to beget them, then to bring
thē foorth, after to nourish them, to preserue them from bodily
perils in the cradle, from daunger of soule by godly education,
to matche them in comfort enclined to vertue, to
banish them all ydle and wanton companie, to allow them
sufficiente for their sustentation, to cut of excesse the open
gate of sinne, seldome or neuer to smile on them vnlesse it
be to their encouragement in vertue, and finally, to prouide
them mariages in time cōuenient, lest neglected of vs, they
learne to sette either to much or to litle by themselues: fiue
yeares are past since I might haue maried hir, when by continuall
excuses I haue prolonged it to my owne perdition:
Alas, I shoulde haue considered, she is a collop of my owne
flesh, what should I thinke to make hir a princesse? Alas alas,
a poore kingdome haue I now caught to endue hir with:
it is too true, that of all sorowes this is the head source and
chiefe fountaine of all furies: the goods of the worlde are incertaine,
the gaines to be reioyced at, and the losse not greatly
to be lamented, only the children cast away, cutteth the
parents throate with the knife of inward care, which knife
will kill me surely, I make none other accoumpte.

vnpossible for a man nowe a daies to handle money

he could mainteine himselfe so brauely apparelled,
but now I perceiue the cause, he had the disbursing and receite
of al my masters affaires, the keys of the granair, Dulippo

he shal be sure of mo than one at a clap that catcheth hir, eyther
Adam or Eue within hir bellie: oh God how men may

Polynestas bed: yet all this while I thought not that anye

talke, wherevpon he sent for me, and forced me to confesse
all that you heard.

                     Sure I haue heard no lesse, and that the marchantes
bobbe them some times, but they play the knaues still.

                     Yea be you well assured, for suche an office is the inheritance
of a knaue, and an honest man will not meddle
with it.

                     Well, this passage shall seme pleasant vnto you whē
you shall finde your childe in health and well: but I praye
you sir why did you not rather send for him into Sicilia, thā
to come your selfe, specially since you had none other businesse?
peraduenture you had rather endanger your selfe by
this noysome iourney, than hazard to drawe him from hys
studie.
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     Nay, that was not y• matter, for I had rather haue
him giue ouer his studie altogether and come home.
                  
                  
                     Fer.
                     Why? if you minded not to make him learned, to
what ende did you send him hither at the first?
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     I will tell you: when he was at home he did as most
yong men doe, he played many mad prankes and did many
things that liked me not very well, and I thinking, that by
that time he had sene the worlde, he would learne to know
himselfe better, exhorted him to studie, and put in his electiō
what place he would go to. At the last he came hither, and I
thinke he was scarce here so sone as I felt the want of him,
in suche sorte, as from that daye to this I haue passed fewe
nightes without teares: I haue written to him very often
that he shoulde come home, but continually he refused still,
beseching me to continue his studie, wherin he doubted not
(as he said) but to profite greatly.
                  
                  
                     Fer.
                     In dede he is very much commended of all men, and
specially of the best reputed studentes.
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     I am glad he hath not lost his time, but I care not

greatly for so muche knowledge, I woulde not be without
the sighte of hym againe so long, for all the learning in the
worlde. I am olde nowe, and if God shoulde call mée in
his absence, I promise you I thinke it woulde driue me
into desperation.

                     It is commendable in a man to loue his childrē, but
to be so tender ouer them is more womanlike?
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     Well, I confesse it is my faulte: and yet I will tell
you another cause of my comming hither, more waightie
than this. Diuers of my countrey haue bene here since he
came hither, by whom I haue sente vnto him, and some of
thē haue bene thrice, some foure or fiue times at his house,
and yet could neuer speake with him: I feare he applies his
studie so, that he will not léese the minute of an houre from
his booke. What, alas, he might yet talke with his countrymen
for a while, he is a yong man, tenderly brought vp, and
if he fare thus continually night and day at his booke, it may
be enough to driue him into a frenesie.

                     Well sir, I thinke this whom I meane, is no suche
manner of man: but if he were, there is suche hatred and
euill will betwene him and this gentleman (whether he be
Erostrato or Dulippo, what so euer he be) that I warrant
you, he will doe what so euer he can do for you, were it but
to spite him.

                  Fained EROSTRATO.
                  WHat a mishappe was this? that before I coulde méete
with Erostrato, I haue light euen full in the lappe of
Philogano, where I was constrained to denye my name, to
denie my maister, and to faine that I knew him not, to contend
with him, and to reuile him, in such sort, that hap what
hap can, I can neuer hap well in fauour with him againe:
therfore if I could come to speake with the right Erostrato.
I will renounce vnto him both habite and credite, &amp; awaye
as fast as I can trudge into some strange countrey, where
I maye neuer sée Philogano againe. Alas, he that of a litle
childe hath brought me vp vnto this day, and nourished me
as if I had bene his owne: and in dede (to confesse ye trouth)
I haue no father to trust vnto but him. But loke where
Pasiphilo commeth, the fittest man in the worlde to goe on
my message to Erostrato.
                  
                  Erostrato espieth Pasiphilo comming tovvards him.

                  TWo good newes haue I heard to day alreadye, one that
Erostrato prepared a great feast this night: y• other, that

he séeketh for me, and I to ease him of his trauaile, least he
shoulde runne vp and downe séeking me, and bycause no
man loueth better thā I to haue an errand where good chéer
is, come in post hast euen home to his owne house: and loke
where he is.
                  
                     Ero.
                     
                        Pasiphilo, thou muste doe one thing for me if thou
loue me.

                     If I loue you not, who loues you, commaunde me?
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     Go then a litle there, to Damons house, aske for Dulipo,
and tell him.
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     Wot you what? I cannot speake with him, he is in
prison.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     In prison? how commeth that to passe? where is he
in prison?

                     Be you content to know he is in prison, I haue told

                     Ero.
                     If euer you will doe any thing for me, tell me.
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     I pray you desire me not, what were you the better
if you knew?
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     More than thou thinkest Pasiphilo by god.
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     Well, and yet it standes me vpon more than you
thinke, to kepe it secrete
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     Why Pasiphilo, is this the trust I haue had in you?
are these the faire promyses you haue alwayes made me?
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     By the masse I would I had fasted this night with
maister doctor, rather than haue come hither.
                  
                  
                     Ero
                     Well Pasiphilo, eyther tell me, or at fewe woordes
neuer thinke to bee welcome to thys house from hence
forthe.
                  
                  
                     Pas
                     Nay, yet I had rather léese all the gentlemen in
this towne, but if I tell you anye thing that displease you,
blame no body but your selfe now.

canst tell me no worsse tidings.
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     Well, since you would néedes haue it, I wil tell you:
he was taken a bed with your beloued Polynesta.

                     Alas, and dothe Damon knowe it?
                  
                  
                     Pa.
                     An olde trot in the house disclosed it to him, whervpon
he tooke bothe Dulipo and the Nurse which hath bene
the broker of all this bargayne, and clapte them bothe in
a cage, where I thinke they shall haue sowre soppes to
their swéete meates.
                  
                  
                     Ero.

                  I Was glad to rid him out of the way, least he shoulde sée
me burst out these swelling teares, which hitherto with
great payne I haue prisoned in my brest, &amp; least he should
heare the Eccho of my doubled sighes, which bounce from
the botome of my heuy heart. O cursed I, O cruell fortune,
that so many dispersed griefes as were sufficient to sub
                        •
                     ert
a legion of Louers, hast sodenly assembled within my carefull
carcase to freat this fearfull heart in sunder with desperation:
thou that hast kepte my master all his youthe
within the realme of Sicilia▪
                      reseruing the wind and waues
in a temperate calme (as it were at his commaunde) nowe
to conuey his aged limmes hither, neither sooner nor later,
but euen in the worst time that may be: if at any time
before thou haddest conducted him, this enterprise had bene

cut off without care in the beginning: and if neuer so little
longer thou hadst lingred his iorney, this happie day might
then haue fully finished our driftes and deuises. But alas,
thou hast brought him euē in the very worst time, to plunge
vs all in the pitte of perdition. Neither art thou content to
entangle me alone in thy ruinous ropes, but thou must also
catche the righte Erostrato in thy crooked clawes, to rewarde
vs bothe with open shame and rebuke. Two yeres
hast thou kepte secret our subtil Supposes, euen this day to
discipher them with a sorowfull successe. What shall I do?
Alas what shifte shall I make? it is too late nowe to imagine
any further deceite, for euery minute séemeth an houre
till I find some succour for the miserable captiue Erostrato.
Well, since there is no other remedie, I wil go to my master
Philogano, and to him will I tell the whole truthe of
the matter, that at the least he may prouide in time, before
his sonne féele the smart of some sharpe reuenge &amp; punishment:
this is the best, and thus will I do: yet I know, that
for mine owne parte I shal do bitter penance for my faults
forepassed: but suche is the good wil and duetie that I beare
to Erostrato, as euen with the losse of my life I muste not
sticke to aduenture any thing which may turne to his cō
                     moditie.
But what shall I do? shall I go séeke my master
about the towne, or shall I tarrie his returne hither? If I
méete him in the stréetes, he will crie out vpon me, neither
will he harken to any thing that I shall say, till he haue gathered
all the people woondring about me, as it were at an
Owle. Therefore I were better to abide here, and yet if he
tarrie long, I will go séeke him, rather than prolong the
time to Erostratos perill.

But is not this Dominus noster Cleandrus that commeth

                     I will tell you sir: when the Turkes won Otranto.

                     Oh, you put me in remembrance of my mishappes.

                     How sir?
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     For I was driuen among the rest out of the towne
(it is my natiue countrey) and there I lost more than euer
I shall recouer againe while I liue.
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     Alas, a pitifull case by saint Anne.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Well, procéede.
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     At that time (as I saide) there were certaine of oure
countrey that scoured those costes vpon the seas, with a
good barke well appoynted for the purpose, and had espiall
of a Turkey vessell that came laden from thence with great

aboundance of riches.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     And peraduenture most of mine.
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     So they boarded them, &amp; in the end ouercame them,
and brought the goods to Palermo, from whence they came,
and amongst other things that they had, was this villeine
my seruaunte, a boy at that time, I thinke not paste fiue
yeres olde.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Alas I lost one of that same age there.
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     And I beyng there, and lyking the Childes fauour
well, proffered them foure and twentie ducattes for him,
and had him.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     What? was the childe a Turke? or had the Turks
brought him from Otranto?
                     
                  
                  
                     Phi
                     They saide he was a Childe of Otranto, but what
is that to the matter? once .xxiiij Ducattes he cost me, that
I wot well.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Alas, I speake it not for that sir, I woulde it were he
whom I meane.
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     Why, whom meane you sir?

                     Beware sir, be not to lauishe.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Was his name Dulippo then? or had he not another
name?
                  
                  
                     Liti.
                     Beware what you say sir.
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     What the deuill hast thou to doe? Dulipo? no sir,
his name was Carino.

                     Yea, well said, tell all and more to, doe?
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     O Lord, if it be as I thinke, how happie were I? and
why did you change his name then?
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     We called him Dulippo, bycause when he cryed
as Children doe sometimes, he woulde alwayes cry on that
name Dulippo.

                     Well, then I sée well it is my owne onely Childe,
whom I loste, when I loste my countrey: he was named
Carino after his grandfather, and this Dulippo whom he
alwayes remembred in his lamenting, was his foster father

that nourished him and brought him vp.

                     He did remember them, and could name his mother
also, but sure I haue forgotten the name.

what of y•? a great matter I promise you, it is like enoughe

                     What nedeth me more euident tokens? this is my

                     Sir, také you héede, least he leade you to some mischiefe.
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     Alas Litio, if my sonne be loste what care I what
become of me?
                  
                  
                     Li.
                     Well, I haue tolde you my minde Sir, doe you as
you please.
                  
                  Exeunt: Damon and Psiteria come in.

                  DAMON. PSITERIA.
                  COme hither you olde kallat, you tatling huswife, tha
                        •
                     
the deuill cut oute your tong: tell me, howe could Pasiphilo
know of this géere but by you?
                  
                     Psi.
                     Sir, he neuer knewe it of me, he was the firste that
tolde me of it.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Thou liest olde drabbe, but I woulde aduise you tell
me the truth, or I wil make those olde bones rattle in your
skinne.
                  
                  
                     Psi.
                     Sir, if you finde me contrarie, kill me.
                  
                  
                     
                     Da.
                     Why? where should he talke with thée?
                  
                  
                     Psi.
                     He talked with me of it here in the stréete.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     What did you here?
                  
                  
                     Psi.
                     I was goyng to the weauers for a webbe of clothe
you haue there.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     And what cause coulde Pasiphilo haue to talke of it,
vnlesse thou began the matter first?
                  
                  
                     Psi.
                     Nay, he began with me sir, reuiling me, bycause I
had tolde you of it: I asked him how he knewe of it, and he
said he was in the stable when you examined me erewhile.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Alas, alas, what shall I doe then? in at dores olde
whore, I wil plucke that tong of thine out by the rootes one
day. Alas it gréeueth me more that Pasiphilo knoweth it,
than all the rest: he that will haue a thing kept secrete, let
him tell it to Pasiphilo, the people shall knowe it, and as
many as haue eares and no mo: by this time he hath tolde
it in a hundreth places. Cleander was the firste, Erostrato
the seconde, and so from one to another throughout the citie.
Alas, what dower, what mariage shall I nowe prepare for
my daughter? O poore dolorous Damon, more miserable
than miserie it selfe, would god it were true that Polinesta,
tolde me ere while: that he who hathe deflowred hir, is of
no seruile estate, as hitherto he hath bene supposed in my
seruice: but that he is a gentleman borne of a good parentage
in Sicilia. Alas, small riches should content me, if he be
but of an honest familie, but I feare that he hathe deuised
these toyes to allure my daughters loue. Well I wil goe examine
hir againe, my mind giueth me that I shall perceiue
by hir tale whether it be true or not. But is not this Pasiphilo
that commeth out of my neighbours house? what the
deuill ayleth him to leape and laughe so like a foole in the
high way?
                  
                  Pasiphilo commeth out of the tovvne laughing.
               
               
                  
                  Scena septima.
                  PASIPHILO. DAMON.
                  O God, that I might finde Damon at home.
                  
                     Da.
                     What the deuill would he with me?
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     That I may be the firste that shall bring him these
newes.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     What will he tell me, in the name of God?
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     O Lord, how happie am I? loke where he is.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     What newes Pasiphilo, that thou arte so merie?
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     Sir, I am mery to make you glād: I bring you ioyfull
newes.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     And that I haue nede of Pasiphilo.
                     
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     I knowe sir, that you are a sorowfull man for this
mishap that hath chaunced in your house, peraduenture you
thoughte I had not knowen of it: but let it passe, plucke vp
you sprites, and reioyce, for he that hath done you this iniurie
is so well borne, and hath so riche parents, that you may
be glad to make him your sonne in law.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     How knowest thou?
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     His father Philogano one of the worthiest men in
all Cathanea, is nowe come to the citie, and is here in your
neighbours house.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     What, in Erostratos house?
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     Nay in Dulipos house, for where you haue alwayes
supposed this gentlemā to be Erostrato, it is not so, but your
seruaunt whom you haue emprisoned hitherto, supposed to
be Dulipo, he is in dede Erostrato, and that other is Dulipo:
and thus they haue alwayes, euen since their first ariual in
this citie, exchaunged names, to the ende that Erostrato the
maister, vnder the name of Dulipo a seruaunte, mighte be
entertained in your house, and so winne the loue of your
daughter.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Well, then I perceiue it is euē as Polinesta told me.
                  
                  
                     
                     Pas.
                     Why, did she tell you so?
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Yea: But I thought it but a tale.
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     Well, it is a true tale: and here they will be with
you by and by, both Philogano this worthie man, and maister
doctor Cleander.
                     
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     
                        Cleander? what to doe?
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     
                        Cleander? Why therby lies another tale, the moste
fortunate aduenture that euer you heard: wot you what?
this other Dulipo, whom all this while we supposed to be
Erostrato, is founde to be the sonne of Cleander, whom he
lost at the losse of Otranto, and was after solde in Sicilia to
this Philogano, the strangest case that euer you heard: a mā
might make a Comedie of it, they wil come euen straight,
and tell you the whole circumstance of it themselues.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Nay I will first goe heare the storie of this Dulipo,
be it Dulipo or Erostrato that I heare within, before I
speake with Philogano.
                     
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     So shall you doe well sir, I will goe tell them that
they may stay a while, but loke where they come.
                  
                  Damō goeth in, Scenese, Cleander and Philogano come
vpon the stage.

                  SCENESE. CLEANDER. PHILOGANO.
                  SIr, you shall not nede to excuse the matter any further,
since I haue receiued no greater iniurie than by words:
let them passe like wind, I take them well in worthe,
and am rather well pleased than offended, for it shall bothe
be a good warning to me another time howe to trust euery
man at the first sighte▪ yea, and I shall haue good game hereafter
to tell this pleasant storye another day in mine owne
countrey.
                  
                     Cle.
                     Gentleman, you haue reason, and be you sure, that

as many as heare it, will take great pleasure in it, and you
Philogano may thinke, that god in heauen aboue, hath ordained
your comming hither at this presente, to the ende I
mighte rcouer my lost sonne, whom by no other meanes I
could euer haue founde oute.
                  
                  
                     Phi.
                     Surely sir I thinke no lesse, for I thinke that not so
muche as a leafe falleth from the tree, withoute the ordynance
of god. But let vs goe seke Damon, for me thinketh
euery day a yeare, euery houre a daye, and euery minute to
much till I see my Erostrato.
                     
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     I cannot blame you, goe we then, Carino take you
that gentleman home in the meane time, the fewer the better
to be present at such affaires.
                  
                  Pasiphilo stayeth their goyng in.

                  MAister doctor, will you not shewme this fauour, to tell
me the cause of your displeasure?
                  
                     Cle.
                     Gentle Pasiphilo, I muste néedes confesse I haue
done thée wrong, and that I beleued tales of thée, whiche in
déede I finde now contrary.
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     I am glad then that it procéeded rather of ignorance
than of malice.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Yea beleue me Pasiphilo.
                     
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     O sir, but yet you shoulde not haue giuen me suche
foule wordes.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     Well, content thy selfe Pasiphilo, I am thy frende
as I haue alwayes bene: for proofe whereof, come suppe

                  WE are come vnto you sir, to turne your sorowe into
ioye and gladnes: the sorow, we meane, that of force
you haue sustained since this mishappe of late fallen in your
house. But be you of good comfort sir, and assure your selfe,
that this yong man whiche youthfully and not maliciously
hath committed this amorous offence, is verie well hable
with consent of this worthie man his father, to make you
s
                        •
                     fficient amendes, being borne in Cathanea of Sicilia, of a
noble house, noway inferiour vnto you, and of wealth (by
the reporte of suche as knowe it) farre excéeding that of
yours.
                  
                     Phe.
                     And I here in proper person, doe presente vnto you
sir, not onely my assured frendship and brotherhoode, but do
earnestly desire you to accepte my poore childe (thoughe vnworthy)
as your sonne in lawe: and for recompence of the
iniurie he hath done you, I profer my whole lands in dower
to your daughter, yea and more would, if more I might.
                  
                  
                     Cle.
                     And I sir, who haue hitherto so earnestly desired
your daughter in mariage, doe now willingly yelde vp and
quite claime to this yong man, who both for his yeares, and
for the loue he beareth hir, is most méetest to be hir husbād:
for where I was desirous of a wife by whom I might haue
yssue, to leaue that litle which god hath sent me, nowe haue
I litle néede, that (thankes be to god) haue founde my déerely
beloued sonne, whom I loste of a childe at the siege of
Otranto.
                     
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Worthy gentleman, you frendship, your alliaunce,
and the nobilitie of your birthe are suche, as I haue muche

more cause to desire them of you, than you to request of me
that which is already graunted: therefore I gladly, and willingly
receiue the same, and thinke my selfe moste happie
now of all my life past, that I haue gottē so toward a sonne
in lawe to my selfe, and so worthye a father in lawe to my
daughter, yea and muche the greater is my contentation,
since this worthie gentleman maister Cleander, doth holde
himselfe satisfied. And now behold your sonne.
                  
                  
                     Ero.
                     O father.
                  
                  
                     Pas.
                     Beholde the naturall loue of the childe to the the father,
for inwarde ioye he cannot pronounce one worde, in
stéede wherof he sendeth sobbes and teares to tell the effect
of his inwarde intention. But why doe you abide here abrode?
will it please you to goe into the house sir?
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     
                        Pasiphilo hathe saide well, will it please you to goe
in sir?
                  
                  
                     Ne.
                     Here I haue brought you sir, bothe fetters &amp; boltes.
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Away with them now.
                  
                  
                     Ne.
                     Yea, but what shall I doe with them?
                  
                  
                     Da.
                     Marie I will tell thée Neuola, to make a righte ende
of our supposes, lay one of those boltes in the fire, and make
thée a suppositorie as long as mine arme, God saue the sample.
Nobles and gentlemen, if you suppose that our supposes

A Tragedie vvritten in
Greke by Euripides, translated

and Francis Kinvvelmershe
of Grayes Inne,

               The argument of the Tragedie
               To scourge the cryme of vvicked Laius,
               And vvrecke the foule Incest of Oedipus,
               The angry Gods styrred vp theyr sonnes, by strife
               VVith blades embrevved to reaue eche others life:
               The vvyfe, the mother, and the concubyne,
               VVhose fearefull hart foredrad theyr fatall fine,
               Hir sonnes thus dead, disdayneth longer lyfe,
               And slayes hirself vvith selfsame bloudy knyfe:
               The daughter she, surprisde vvyth childish dreade
               (That durst not dye) a lothsome lyfe doth leade,
               Yet rather chose to guyde hir banysht sire,
               Than cruell Creon should haue his desire.
               Creon is King, the type of Tyranny,
               And Oedipus, myrrour of misery.

and Musickes before euery Acte.
               
                  FIrst, before the beginning of the firste
Acte, did sounde a dolefull and straunge
noyse of violles, Cythren, Bandurion,
and suche like, during the which, there
came in vpon the Stage a King with an Imperiall
Crowne vpon his head, very richely apparelled,
a Scepter in his right hande, a Mounde
with a Crosse in his left hande, sitting in a Chariote
very richely furnished, drawne in by foure
kinges in their Dublettes and Hosen, with
Crownes also vpon their heades: Representing
vnto vs Ambition, by the hystorie of Sesostres
king of Egypt, who beeing in his time and reigne
a mightie Conquerour, yet not content to haue
subdued many Princes, and taken from them
their kingdomes and dominions, did in lyke maner
cause those Kinges whome he had so ouercome,
to drawe in his Chariote like Beastes and
Oxen, thereby to content his vnbrideled ambitious
desire. After he had beene drawne twyce
about the Stage, and retyred, the Musicke ceased,
and Iocasta the Queene issued out of hir
house, beginning the first Acte, as followeth.
               
                  Iocasta the Queene issueth out of hir Pallace,
before hir twelue Gentlemen very brauely apparelled,
following after hir eight Gentlewomen,

whereof foure be the Chorus that remayne on
the Stage after hir departure. At hir entrance
the Trumpettes sounded, and after she had
gone once aboute the Stage, she turneth
to one of hir moste trustie and
estemed seruaunts, and vnto him
she discloseth hir griefe,
as foloweth.

                  (Wherof to talke my heart it rendes in twaine)
                  Yet once againe, I must to thée recompte
                  The wailefull thing that is alredy spred,
                  Bycause I know, that pitie will compell
                  Thy tender hart, more than my naturall childe,

                     And as my duties be most infinite,
                     So infinite, must also be my loue:
                     Then if my life or spending of my bloude
                     May be employed to doe your highnesse good,

                     Contentedly forsake this withered corps,
                     
                        For ioy to thinke I neuer shewde my selfe

                     The hidden secrets of supernall powers,
                     Unto Diuines did make his ofte recourse,
                     Of them to learne when he should haue a sonne,

                     The wretched king (though all in vayne) did séeke
                     For to eschew that could not be eschewed:
                     And so, forgetting lawes of natures loue,
                     No sooner had this paynfull wombe brought foorth
                     His eldest sonne to this desired light,
                     But straight he chargde a trustie man of his

                     His seruant thus obedient to his hest,
                     Up by the héeles did hang this faultlesse Impe,
                     And percing with a knife his tender féete,
                     Through both the wounds did drawe the slender twigs,

                     Full many men haue broke the lawes of truth,

                     Of Pollinyce, than of that cruell wretch.
                     Besides that, Pollinyce whiles he remainde
                     In Thebes here, did euer loue me more,

discord by the history of two brethrē, whose
discord in their life was not onely to be wondred
at, but being buried both in one Tombe (as some
writers affirme) the flames of their funeralls did
yet part the one frō the other in like manner, and
would in no wise ioyne into one flame. After the
Funerals were ended and the fire consumed, the
graue was closed vp again, the mourners withdrew

Homoloydes entred Pollinyces accompanied with
vj. gentlemen and a page that carried his helmet

gorgets, for that they were permitted to come
into the towne in time of truce, to the end Iocasta

               The order of the fourth dumbe
shevve.
               BEfore the beginning of this fourth Acte, the
Trumpets sounded, the drummes and fifes,
and a greate peale of ordinaunce was shot of, in
the which ther entred vpon the stage .vj. knights
armed at al points, whereof three came in by the
Gates Electrae, and the other foure by the Gates
Homoloides, either parte beeing accompanied

with vij, other armed men: and after they had
marched twice or thrice about the Stage, the
one partie menacing the other by their furious
lookes and gestures, the .vj. knights caused their
other attendants to stand by, and drawing their
Swords, fell to cruell and couragious combate,
continuing therein, till two on the one side were
slayne: the third perceiuing, that he only remayned
to withstand the force of .iij. enemies, did politiquely
runne aside, wherewith immediatly one
of the .iij. followed after him, and when he hadde
drawen his enimie thus from his companie, hee
turned againe and slewe him: Then the seconde
also ranne after him, whome he slewe in like mā
                  ner,
and consequently the thirde, and then triumphantly
marched aboute the Stage with hys
sword in his hand. Hereby was noted the incomparable
force of concord betweene brethren, who
as long as they holde togither may not easily by
any meanes be ouercome, and being once disseuered
by any meanes, are easily ouerthrowen. The
history of the brethren Horatij &amp; Curiatij, who agreed
to like combate and came to like ende. After
that the dead carkasses were caried from the
Stage by the armed men on both parties, and
that the victor was triumphantly accompanied
out, also came in a messanger armed from the
campe, seeking the Queene, and to hir spake as
followeth.

                     And forwarde straighte with strength of chiualrie,
                     His flying foes couragiously pursude.
                     To long it were to make recompt of all
                     That wounded bene, or slaine, or captiue now,
                     The cloudy ayre was filled round aboute
                     With houling cries and wofull wayling plaints:
                     So great a slaughter (O renowmed Quéene)
                     Before this day I thinke was neuer séene.
                     Thus haue we now cut of the fruitlesse hope
                     The Grecians had, to sacke this noble towne.
                     What ioyfull end will happen herevnto
                     Yet know I not: the gods tourne all to good.
                     "To conquere, lo, is doubtlesse worthy praise,
                     "But wisely for to vse the conquest gotte,
                     "Hath euer wonne immortall sound of fame

                     This good successe was luckie sure, and such,
                     As for my parte I little loked for:

                     Sith hitherto your state is safe inough.

                     Those words of thine, do whelme my iealous mind

                     When your victorious sonne, with valiaunt force
                     Had chast his foes into their ioyning tents,
                     Euen there he staide, and straight at sound of trumpe
                     With stretched voice the herault thus proclaimde:
                     
                        You princely Gréekes, that hither be arriued
                     To spoile the fruite of these our fertile fields,
                     And vs to driue from this our Natiue soile,
                     O suffer not so many giltlesse soules
                     By this debate descend in Stigian lake,
                     For priuate cause of wicked Pollinice,
                     
                     But rather let the brethren, hand to hand,
                     By mutuall blowes appease their furious rage,
                     And so to cease from sheding further bloud:
                     And, to the end you all might vnderstand
                     The profite that to euery side may fall,
                     Thus much my Lord thought good to profer you,
                     This is his will, if he be ouercome,
                     Then Polinice to rule this kingly realme:
                     If so it happe (as reason would it should)
                     Our rightfull prince to conquere Polinice,
                     
                     That then no one of you make more adoo,
                     But straight to Argos. Ile hast home againe.
                     This, thus pronounst vnto the noble Gréeks,
                     No soner did the sound of trumpet cease,
                     But Polinice stept forth before the host,
                     And to these words this answere did he make:
                     O thou, (not brother) but my mortall foe,
                     Thy profer here hath pleased me so well,
                     As presently, without more long delay,
                     I yeld my selfe prepared to the field.
                     Our noble King no soner heard this vaunt,
                     But forth as fast he prest his princely steppes,
                     With eger mind, as hoouering falcon wonts

                     To comforte him, and put him then in mind,
                     
                        He fought for safetie of his country soile,
                     And that in him consisted all their hope.
                     To Polinice the king Adrastus swore,
                     If he escaped victor from the fielde,
                     As his retourn he would in Greece erecte

                  Out of this house, that nought but woe retaines,
                  Come forth I say, not for to sing or daunce,
                  But to preuent (if in our powers it lie)
                  That thy malicious brethren (swolne with ire)
                  And I alas, their miserable mother,
                  Be not destroide by stroke of dreadfull death.

                     Ah swete mother, ah my beloued mother,
                     Alas alas what cause doth moue ye now
                     From trembling voice to send such carefull cries?
                     What painefull pang? what griefe doth gripe you nowe?

                     They both haue vowde (I quake alas to tell)
                     With trenchant blade to spill ech others blood.
                     O cruell Eteocles, ah ruthlesse wretch,
                     Of this outrage thou only art the cause,
                     Not Pollinice, whom thou with hatefull spight
                     Hast reaued first of crowne and countrie soyle,
                     And now doest séeke to reaue him of his life.

                     But rather to preuent (if so we may)
                     That wicked déede, which only but to thinke,
                     Doth hale my hart out of my heauie brest.

                     You a weake old woman for worne with yeares,
                     And I God knowes a silly simple mayde?

                     (Where Nature rules) may happen to preuayle,
                     When reason, power, and force of armes do fayle,
                     But if the glowing heate of boyling wrath
                     So furious be, as it may not relent,
                     Then I atwixt them both will throw my selfe,
                     And this my brest shall beare the deadly blowes
                     That otherwise should light vpon my sonnes:
                     So shall they shead my bloud and not their owne.
                     Well now déere daughter, let vs hasten hence,
                     For if in time we stay this raging strife,
                     Then haply may my life prolonged be:
                     If ere we come the bloudy déede be done,
                     
                        Then must my ghost forsake this féeble corps:
                     And thou, deare childe, with dolour shalt bewaile,
                     Thy brothers death and mothers all at once.

                     She and none other sure, can comprehende
                     The dolefull griefe, the pangs and secret paine,
                     That presently doth pierce the princely brest
                     Of our afflicted Quéene: alas, I thinke
                     No martyrdome might well compare with hirs.
                     So ofte as I recorde hir restlesse state,
                     Alas me thinkes I féele a shiuering feare
                     Flit to and fro along my flushing vaines.
                     Alas for ruth, that thus two brethren shoulde,
                     Enforce themselues to shed each others bloude.
                     Where is the lawes of nature nowe become?
                     Can fleshe of fleshe, alas, can bloude of bloude,
                     So far forget it selfe, as slaye it selfe?
                     O lowring starres, O dimme and angrie skies,
                     O giltie fate, such mischiefe set aside.
                     But if supernall powers decreed haue,
                     That death must be the ende of this debate,
                     Alas what floudes of teares shall then suffise,

                        Eteocles had made his foemen flée

                     Lo he the cause, my cruell enimie.
                     The people wept to heare the wofull wordes

                     Thus sayde:
                     O mightie loue his daughter graunt to me,
                     That this right hande with this sharpe armed launce

                     It may eke pierce that cowarde harte of his,
                     And so him slea that thus vnworthily
                     Disturbes the quiet of our common weale.
                     So sayde Eteocles, and trumpets blowne,
                     To sende the summens of their bloudy fighte,
                     That one the other fiercely did encounter,
                     Like Lions two yfraught with boyling wrath,

                     Are bothe ybroke, and in a thousande shiuers

                     Beholde agayne, with naked sworde in hande,
                     Eche one the other furiously assaultes.
                     Here they of Thebes, there stoode the Greekes in doubt,
                     Of whom doth eche man féele more chilling dread,
                     Least any of the twayne should lose his life,
                     Than any of the twayne did féele in fight.
                     Their angry lookes, their deadly daunting blowes,
                     Might witnesse well, that in their heartes remaynde

                     The first that hapt to hurt was Polinice,
                     
                     Who smote the righte thighe of Eteocles:
                     
                     But as we déeme, the blow was nothing déepe,
                     Then cryed the Gréekes, and lepte with lightned harts,

               Epilogus.
               LO here the fruite of high aspiring minde,
               Who wéeues to mount aboue the mouing skies:
               Lo here the trappe that titles proud do finde,
               Sée, ruine growes when most we reache to ryse:
               Swéete is the name, and stately is the raigne
               Of kingly rule, and sway of royall seate,
               But bitter is the taste of Princes gayne,
               When climbing heads do hunte for to be great.
               Who would forecast the banke of restlesse toyle,
               Ambitious wightes do fraight their brestes withall,
               The growing cares, the feares of dreadfull foyle,
               The euill successe that on suche flightes do fall,
               He would not stayne his practise to atchiue
               The largest limites of the mightiest states.
               But oh, what fansies swéete do still relieue
               The hungry humor of these swelling hates?
               What poyson swéete inflameth highe desire?
               How soone the hawty heart is puft with pride?
               How soone is thirst of scepter set on fire?
               How soone in rising mindes doth mischiefe slyde?
               What bloudy sturres doth glut of honour bréede?
               Thambitious sonne doth ofte surpresse his syre:
               Where natures power vnfayned loue should spread,
               There malice raynes and reacheth to be higher.
               O blinde vnbridled searche of Soueraintie,
               O tickle trayne of euill attayned state,
               O fonde desire of princely dignitie,
               Who climbs too soone, he ofte repents too late.
               The golden meane the happie dothe suffise,
               They leaue the posting day in rare delight,
               They fill (not féede) their vncontended eyes,
               They reape suche rest as dothe begile the might,
               They not enuie the pompe of haughtie reigne,
               
                  Ne dreade the dinte of proude vsurping swoorde,
               But plaste alowe, more sugred ioyes attaine,
               Than swaye of loftie Scepter can afoorde.
               Cease to aspire then, cease to soare so high,
               And shunne the plague that pierceth noble breastes:
               To glittring courtes what fondnesse is to flée,
               When better state in baser Towers rests?

            A discourse of the aduentures
passed by Master F. I.

                  IN August last
passed my familiar friend
Master G. T. bestowed vppon
me y• reading of a written
Booke, wherin he had
collected diuers discourses &amp;
verses, inuented vppon sundrie
occasions, by sundrie
gentlemē (in mine opinion)
right commendable for their
capacitie. And herewithal my said friend charged me, that
I should vse them onely for mine owne particuler commoditie,
and eftsones safely deliuer the originall copie to
him againe, wherein I must confesse my selfe but halfe a
marchant, for the copie vnt
                  •
                him I haue safely redeliuered.
But the worke (for I thought it worthy to be publilished)
I haue entreated my friend A. B. to emprint: as
one that thought better to please a number by common
commoditie then to féede the humor of any priuate parson
by nedelesse singularitie. This I haue aduentured, for
thy contentation (learned Reader.) And further haue presumed
of my selfe to christen it by the name of A hundreth
sundrie Flowers: In which poeticall posie are setforth manie
trifling fantasies, humorall passions, and straunge affects
of a Louer. And therin (although the wiser sort wold
turne ouer the leafe as a thing altogether fruitlesse) yet I
my selfe haue reaped this commoditie, to sit and smile at
the fond deuises of such as haue enchayned them selues in
the golden fetters of fantasie, and hauing bewrayed them

selues to the whole world, do yet coniecture y• they walke
vnséene in a net. Some other things you may also finde
in this Booke, which are as voyde of vanitie, as the first
are lame for gouernement. And I must confesse that
(what to laugh at the one, &amp; what to learne by the other)
I haue contrary to the chardge of my said friend G. T.
procured for these trifles this day of publication. Wherat
if the aucthors onely repyne, and the number of other
learned mindes be thankfull: I may then boast to haue
gained a bushell of good will, in exchange for one pynt of
péeuish choler. But if it fal out contrary to expectatiō that
the readers iudgements agrée not with myne opinion in
their commendacions, I may then (vnlesse their curtesies
supplie my want of discretion) with losse of some labour,
accompt also the losse of my familier friendes, in doubt
whereof, I couer all our names, and referre you to the
well written letter of my friende G. T. next following,
whereby you may more at large consider of these occasions.
And so I cōmend the praise of other mens trauailes
together with the pardon of mine owne rashnes, vnto the
well willing minds of discrete readers. From my lodging

                  The letter of G. T. to his very friend
H. W. concerning this worke.
                  
                     REmembring the late conference passed betwene
vs in my lodging, and how you séemed
to estéeme some Pamphlets, which I
did there shew vnto you farre aboue their
worth in skill, I do straightwaye conclude
the same your iudgment to procede
of two especiall causes, one (and principall) the stedfast
good will, which you haue euer hitherto sithens our first

familiaritie borne towardes mée. An other (of no lesse
weight) the exceding zeale and fauour that you beare to
good letters. The which (I agrée with you) do no lesse
bloome and appeare in plea
                        •
                     aunt ditties or compendious
Sonets, deuised by gréen youthful capacities, than they do
fruitefully florish vnto perfection in the ryper workes of
graue and grayheared writers. For as in the last, the
yonger sort maye make a mirror of perfecte life: so in the
first, the most frosty bearded Philosopher, maye take iust
occasion of honest recreation, not altogether without holsome
lessons, tending to the reformation of manners.
For who doubteth but that Poets in their most feyned
fables and imaginations, haue metaphorically set forth
vnto vs the right rewardes of vertues, and the due punnishments
for vices? Marie in déede I may not compare
Pamphlets vnto Poems, neither yet may iustly aduant
for our natiue countrimen, that they haue in their verses
hitherto (translations excepted) deliuered vnto vs any
such notable volume, as haue bene by Poets of antiquitie,
left vnto the posteritie. And the more pitie, that amongst
so many toward wittes no one hath bene hitherto
encouraged to followe the trace of that worthy and famous
Knight Sir Geffrey Chaucer, and after many pretie
deuises spent in youth, for the obtayning a worthles victorie,
might consume and consummate his age in discribing
the right pathway to perfect felicitie, with the due
preseruation of the same. The which although some may
iudge ouer graue a subiect to be handled in stile metrical,
yet for that I haue found in the verses of eloquent Latinists,
learned Gréekes, &amp; pleasant Italians▪
                      sundrie directions,
whereby a man may be guided toward thattayning
of that vnspeakeable treasure, I haue thus farre lamented,
that our countreymen, haue chosen rather to winne
a passouer praise by the wanton penning of a few louing
layes, than to gayne immortall fame, by the Clarkely

handlinge of so profitable a Theame. For if quicknes of
inuencion, proper vocables, apt Epythetes, and store of
monasillables may help a pleasant brayne to be crowned
with Lawrell. I doubt not but both our countreymen &amp;

                     t good (I say) to present you with this writtē booke,
wherein you shall find a number of Sonets▪
                      layes, letters,
Ballades, Rondlets, verlayes and verses, the workes of
your friend and myne Master F. I. and diuers others,
the which when I had with long trauayle confusedly gathered
together, I thought it then Opere precium, to reduce
them into some good order. The which I haue done according
to my barreyne skill in this written Booke, commending
it vnto you to read and to peruse, and desiring
you as I onely do aduenture thus to participate the sight
therof vnto your former good will, euen so that you will
by no meanes make the same common: but after your
owne recreation taken therin y• you wil safely redeliuer
vnto me the originall copie. For otherwise I shall not
onely prouoke all the aucthors to be offended with mée,
but further shall léese the opertunitie of a greater matter,
halfe and more graunted vnto mée alreadie, by the
willing consent of one of them. And to be playne (with
you my friend) he hath written (which as farre as I can
learne) did neuer yet come to the reading or perusinge of
any man but himselfe: two notable workes. The one
called, the Sundry lots of loue. The other of his owne inuencion
entituled. The clyming of an Eagles neast. These
thinges (and especially the later) doth séeme by the name
to be a work worthy the reading. And the rather I iudge
so because his fantasie is so occupied in the same, as that
contrary to his wonted vse, he hath hitherto withhelde

it from sight of any his fa

                     iliers, vntill it be finished, you
may gesse him by his Nature. And therfore I requier
your secresie herein, least if he hear the contrary, we shall
not be able by any meanes to procure these other at his
handes. So fare you wel,

            WHen I had with no small entreatie obteyned of
Master F. I. and sundry other toward young gentlemen,
the sundry copies of these sundry matters, then
aswell for that the number of them was great, as also for
that I found none of them, so barreyne, but that (in my
iudgmēt) had in it Aliquid Salis, and especially being considered
by the very proper occasion whereuppon it was
written (as they them selues did alwayes with the verse
reherse vnto me the cause y• then moued them to write)
I did with more labour gather them into some order, and
so placed them in this register. Wherein as neare as I
could gesse, I haue set in the first places those which Master.
F. I. did compyle. And to begin with this his history
that ensueth, it was (as he declared vnto me) written vppon
this occasiō. The said F. I. chaunced once in the north
partes of this Realme to fall in company of a very fayre
gentlewoman whose name was Mistresse Elinor, vnto
whom bearinge a hotte affection, he first aduentured to
write this letter following.
            G. T.
            
               
                  MIstresse I pray you vnderstand that being altogether
a straunger in these parties, my good hap hath bene
to behold you to my (no small) contentation, and my
euill happ accompanies the same, with such imperfection
of my deserts, as that I finde alwayes a readie repulse in

mine owne frowardnes. So that consideringe the naturall
clymate of the countrie, I must say that I haue found fire
in frost. And yet comparing the inequalitie of my deserts,
with the least part of your worthines, I feele a continuall
frost, in my most feruent fire. Such is then thextremitie of
my passions, the which I could neuer haue bene content
to committe vnto this telltale paper, weare it not that I
am destitute of all other helpe. Accept therfore I beseeke
you, the earnest good will of a more trustie (than worthy)
seruaunt, who being therby encouraged, may supplie the
defects of his abilitie with readie triall of duetifull loyalty.
And let this poore paper (besprent with salt teares, and
blowen ouer with skalding sighes) be saued of you as a safe
garde for your sampler, or a bottome to wind your sowing
silke, that when your last nedelfull is wrought, you maye
returne to readinge therof and consider the care of hym

            THis letter by hir receiued (as I haue hard him say)
hir answere was this: She toke occasion one daye,
at his request to daunce with him, the which doinge,
she bashfully began to declare vnto him, that
she had read ouer the writinge, which he deliuered vnto
hir, with like protestation, that (as at deliuerie therof,
she vnderstode not for what cause he thrust the same into
hir bosome,) so now she coulde not perceyue therby any
part of his meaning, neuerthelesse at last semed to take
vppon hi the matte and though she disabled hir selfe,
yet gaue him thankes as &amp;c. Wheruppon he brake the
braule, and walkinge abrode deuised immediatly these

            I Haue heard the Aucthor saye, that these were the first
verses that euer he wrote vppon like occasion. The
which cōsidering ye matter precedent, may in my iudgement
be well allowed, and to iudge his doings by the effectes
he declared vnto me, that before he coulde put the
same in legible writinge, it pleased the sayd Mystresse Elinor
of hir curtesie thus to deale with him. Walking in a
garden among diuers other gentlemen &amp; gentlewomen,
with a little frowning smyle in passing by him, she deliuered
vnto him a paper, with these words. For that I vnderstand
not (quoth shee) th'intent of your letters, I pray
you take them here againe, and bestow them at your pleasure.
The which done and sayde, shée passed by without
change either of pace or countenaunce. F. I. somewhat
troubled with her angrie looke, did sodenly leaue the companie,
&amp; walking into a parke neare adioyning, in great
rage began to wreake his mallice on this poore paper, and
he same did rend and teare in péeces. When sodenly at a
glaunce he perceaued it was not of his owne hande writing,
and therewithall abashed, vppon better regard he
perceyued in one péece therof written (in Romaine) these
letters S H E: wherefore placing all the péeces therof, as

orderly as he could, he found therin written, these fewe
lynes hereafter followinge.

                  YOur sodeyn departure, from our pastime yesterday,
did enforce me for lacke of chosen cōpany to return
vnto my worke, wherein I did so long continew, till
at the last the bare bottome did drawe vnto my remembraunce
your straunge request. And although I founde
therin no iust cause to credite your coulored woordes, yet
haue I thought good hereby to requite you with like curtesie,
so that at least you shall not condemne me for vngratefull.
But as to the matter therin conteyned, if I could
perswade my selfe, that there were in mee any coales to
kyndle such sparkes of fire, I might yet peraduenture bee
drawen to beleue that your minde were frosen with like
feare. But as no smoke ariseth, where no cole is kindled, so
without cause of affection the passion is easie to be cured.
This is all that I vnderstand of your darke letters. And as
much as I meane to aunsweare.

            MY friend F. I. hath tolde me diuers times, that
imediatly vppon receit hereof, he grew in ielosy,
that the same was not her owne deuise. And ther
in I haue no lesse allowed his iudgment, then cō
               mended
his inuention of the verses, and letters before
rehersed. For as by the stile this letter of hirs bewrayeth
that it was not penned by a womans capacitie, so the
sequell of hir doings may discipher, that she had me ready
clearkes then trustie seruants in store. Well yet as the
perfect hound, when he hath chased the hurt deere, amidde
the whole heard, wil neuer giue ouer till he haue singled
it againe. Euen so F. I. though somewhat abashed with
this doubtfull shewe, yet still constant in his former intention,
ceased not by all possible meanes, to bringe this

Déere yet once agayne to the Bowes, wherby she might
be the more surely stryken: and so in the end enforced to
yeeld. Wherfore he thought not best to commit the sayde
verses willingly into hir custodie, but priuily lost them
in hir chamber, written in counterfeit. And after on the
next day thought better to replie, either vpon hir, or vppon
hir Secretary in this wyse as here followeth.
            G. T.
            
               
                  THE much that you haue answered is very much, and
much more than I am able to replye vnto: neuerthelesse
in myne owne defence, thus I alleage: that
if my sodein departure pleased not you, I cannot my selfe
therwith be pleased, as one that seeketh not to please many,
and more disirous to please you then any. The cause of
myne affection, I suppose you behold dayly. For (self loue
auoyded) euery wight may iudge of themselues as much as
reason perswadeth: the which if it be in your good nature
suppressed with bashfulnes, then mighty loue graunt, you
may once behold my wan cheekes wasshed in woe, that
therein my salt teares may be a myrrour to represent your
owne shadow, and that like vnto Narcissus you may bee
constrayned to kisse the cold waues, wherein your coūterfait
is so liuely portrayed. For if aboundance of other matters
fayled to drawe my gazing eyes in contemplacion of
so rare excellency, yet might these your letters both frame
in me an admiration of such diuine esprit, and a confusion
to my dull vnderstanding, which so rashly presumed
to wander in this endles Laberinthe. Such I esteeme you,
and thereby am become such, and Euen.
                  
                     HE. F.I.
                  
               
            
            THis letter finished and fayre written ouer, his chaūce
was to méete hir alone in a Gallery of the same house:
where (as I haue heard him declare) his manhood in this

kind of combat was first tryed, and therein I can compare
him to a valiant Prince, who distressed with power
of enemies had committed the safegard of his person to
treaty of Ambassade, and sodenly (surprised with a Camnassado
in his own trenches) was enforced toyéeld as prisoner.
Euen so my friend F.I. lately ouercome by y• beautifull
beames of this Dame Elynor, and hauing now cō
               mitted
his most secrete intent to these late rehearsed letters,
was at vnwares encountred with his friendly foe,
and constrayned either to prepare some new defence, or
else like a recreant to yéeld himself as already vāquished.
Wherfore (as in a traunce) he lifted vp his dazled eyes,
&amp; so continued in a certen kind of admiration, not vnlike
the Astronomer, who (hauing after a whole nights trauayle,
in grey morning found his desired starre) hath
fixed his hungry eies to behold the Comete long looked for:
wherat this gracious Dame (as one that could discerne ye
sun before hir chāber windowes were wide opē) did deign
to embolden the feinting Knight wt these or like words.
            I perceiue now (quod she) how mishap doth follow me,
that hauing chosen this walke for a simple solace, I am
here disquieted by the man that meaneth my distructiō
               ▪ &amp;
therwithal, as half angry, began to turne hir back, when
as my friend F.I. now awaked, gan thus salute hir.
            Mystres (quod he) and I perceiue now, y• good hap haūts
me, for being by lack of oportunitie constreined to cōmit
my welfare vnto these blabbing leaues of bewraying pape
(shewing y• in his hand) I am here recōforted wt happy
view of my desired ioye, &amp; therewithall reuerētly kissing
his hand, did softly distreine hir slende arme &amp; so stayed
hir departure. The first blow thus profered &amp; defended,
they walked &amp; talked trauersing diuers wayes, wherein
I doubt not but y• my friend. F.I. could quit himself resonably
well. And though it stood not with duty of a friend
that I should therin require to know hir secrets, yet of

him self he declared thus much, that after long talke shée
was contented to accept his proferd seruice, but yet still
disabling hir self, and séeming to maruell what cause had
moued him to subiect his libertie so wilfully, or at least
in a prison (as she termed it) so vnworthy. Whereunto I
néede not rehearse his answere, but suppose now, y• thus
they departed: sauing I had forgotten this, shée required
of him the last rehearsed letter, saying that his frist was
lost, &amp; now she lacked a new bottome for hir silke, the
which I warrāt you, he graūted: and so profering to take
an humble congé by Bezo las manos, shée graciously gaue
him the zuccado dez labros: and so for then departed. And
therupō recōpting hir words, he cōpyled these following,
which he termed Terza sequenza, to swéet Mystres SHE.

                  OF thee deare Dame, three lessons would I learne,
                  What reason first persuades the foolish Fly
                  (As soone as shee a candle can discerne)
                  To play with flame, till shee bee burnt thereby?
                  Or what may moue the Mouse to byte the bayte
                  Which strykes the trappe, that stops hir hungry breth?
                  What calles the Byrd, where snares of deepe deceit
                  Are closely caught to draw hir to hir death?
                  Consider well, what is the cause of this.
                  And though percase thou wilt not so confesse,
                  Yet deepe desire, to gayne a heauenly blisse,
                  May drowne the mynd in dole and darke distresse:
                  Oft is it seene (whereat my hart may bleede)
                  Fooles playe so long till they be caught in deed.
                  And then
                  It is a heauen to see them hop and skip,
                  And seeke all shiftes to shake their shackles of:
                  It is a world, to see them hang the lip.

                     nt to skorne and skof.
                  But as the Mouse, once caught in crafty trap,
                  May bounce and beate, agaynst the boorden wall,
                  
                     Till shee haue brought hir head in such mishape,
                  That doune to death hir fainting lymbes must fall:
                  And as the Flye once singed in the flame,
                  Cannot commaund hir wings to waue away:
                  But by the heele, shee hangeth in the same
                  Till cruell death hir hasty iourney stay.
                  So they that seeke to breake the linkes of loue
                  Stryue with the streame, and this by payne I prou

                  I first beheld that heauenly hewe of thyne,
                  Thy stately stature, and thy comly grace,
                  I must confesse these dazled eyes of myne
                  Did wincke for feare, when I first viewd thy face
                  But bold desire, did open them agayne,
                  And bad mee looke till I had lookt to long,
                  I pitied them that did procure my payne,
                  And lou'd the lookes that wrought me all the wrong:
                  And as the Byrd once caught (but woorks her woe)
                  That stryues to leaue the lymed winges behind:
                  Euen so the more I straue to parte thee fro,
                  The greater grief did growe within my minde:
                  Remediles then must I yeeld to thee,
                  And craue no more, thy seruaunt but to bee
                  
                     Tyll then and euer. HE. F. I.
                  
               
            
            WHen he had wel sorted this sequence, he sought oportunitie
to leaue it where she might finde it before it
were lost. And now the coles begā to kindle, wherof (but
ere whyle) she feig
                  •
               ed hir self altogither ignorant. The
flames began to break out on euery syde: &amp; she to quench
them, shut vp hir selfe in hir chamber solitarely. But as
the smithie gathers greater heat by casting on of water,
euen so the more she absented hir self from company, the
fresher was the grief which galded hir remembrance: so
that at last the report was spred thorough the house, that

Mystres Elinor was sicke. At which newes F. I. tooke
small comfort: neuerthelesse Dame Venus with good aspect
dyd yet thus much furder his enterprise. The Dame
(whether it were by sodain chaunge, or of wonted custome)
fell one day into a great bléeding at the nose. For
which accident the said F. I. amongst other prety cōceits,
hath a present remedy, wherby he tooke occasion (when
they of the house had all in vayne sought many ways to
stop hir bléeding) to worke his feate in this wyse: First
he pleaded ignorance, as though he knewe not hir name,
and therefore demaunded the same of one other Gentlewomā
in the house, whose name was Mistres Frances,
who when shée had to him declared that hir name was
Elinor, hée said these wordes or very lyke in effect: If I
thought I should not offend Mystres Elynor, I would not
doubt to stop hir bléeding, without eyther payne or difficulty.
This gentlewoman somewhat tyckled wyth hys
words, did incontinent make relacion thereof to the sayd
Mystres Elynor, who immediately (declaring that F. I.
was hir late receyued seruaunt) returned the sayd messanger
vnto him with especiall charge, that hée shoulde
employ his de
                  •
               oyre towards the recouery of hir health,
with whom the same F. I. repayred to the chamber of his
desired: and finding hir sette in a chayre, leaning on the
one side ouer a siluer bason: After his due reuereuce, hée
layd his hand on hir temples, and priuily rounding hir
in hir eare, desired hir to commaund a Hazell sticke and
a knyfe: the which being brought, hée deliuered vnto hir,
saying on this wyse. Mystres I wil speak certen words
in secret to my selfe, and doe require no more: but when
you heare me saie openly this word Amen, that you with
this knyfe will make a nycke vppon this hasell stycke:
and when you haue made fyue nickes, commaunde mée
also to cease. The Dame partly of good wil to the knight,
and partly to be stenched of hir bléeding, commaunded

hir mayd, and required the other gentils, somewhat to
stand asyde, which done, he began his oraisons, wherein
he had not long muttered before he pronounced Amen,
wherewith the Lady made a nyck on the stick with hir
knyfe. The said F. I. continued to an other Amen, when
the Lady hauing made an other nyck felt hir bléeding, began
to steynch: and so by the third Amen throughly steinched.
F. I. then chaunging his prayers into priuate talk,
said softly vnto hir. Mystres, I am glad that I am hereby
enabled to do you some seruice, and as the staunching of
your own bloud may some way recōfort you, so if y• shedding
of my bloud may any way content you, I beséech
you commaund it, for it shalbe euermore readily employed
in your seruice, and therwithal with a loud voyce pronounced
Amen: wherwith the good Lady making a nyck
did secretly answere thus. Good seruaunt (quod shée) I
must néeds think my self right happy to haue gained your
seruice and good will, and be you sure, that although ther
be in me no such desert as may draw you into this depth
of affection, yet such as I am, I shalbe alwayes glad to
shewe my self thankfull vnto you, and now, if you think
your self assured, that I shall bléede no more, doe thē prononce
your fifth Amen, the which pronounced, shée
made also hir fifth nicke, and held vp hir head, calling the
company vnto hir, and declaring vnto them, that hir bléeding
was throughly steinched. Well, it were long to tell,
what sundry opinions were pronounced vpon this acte,
and I doe dwell ouerlong in the discourses of this F. I.
especially hauing taken in hand only to copie out his verses,
but for the circumstāce doth better declare the effect,
I will returne to my former tale. F. I. tarying a while in
the chamber found oportunitie to loose his sequence néere
to his desired Mistres: And after congé taken departed.
After whose departuer the Lady arose out of hir chayre, &amp;
hir mayd going about to remoue the same, espied, &amp; tooke

vp the writing: the which hir mistres perceiuing, gan sodenly
cōiecture that y• same had in it some like matter to
the verses once before left in like maner, &amp; made semblāt
to mistrust that the same shuld be some words of cōiuration:
and taking it frō hir mayd, did peruse it, &amp; immediatly
said to the cōpany, that she would not forgo the same
for a great treasure. But to be plain, I think that (F. I. excepted)
she was glad to be rid of all cōpany, vntill shée had
with sufficient leasure turned ouer &amp; retossed euery card
in this sequēce. And not long after being now tickled thorough
all the vaines with an vnknown humour, aduentured
of hir self to cōmit vnto a like Ambassadour the discyphring
of that which hitherto she had kept more secret,
&amp; therupō wrot with hir own hand &amp; head in this wyse.
            G. T.
            
               
                  GOod seruant, I am out of al doubt much beholding vnto
you, and I haue great comfort by your meanes in the
steinching of my bloud, and I take great cōfort to reade
your letters, and I haue found in my chamber diuers songs
which I think to be of your making, and I promise you,
they are excellently made, I assure you that I wilbe
ready to doe for you any pleasure that I can, during my
lyfe: wherefore I pray you come to my chamber once in a
day, till I come abroad again, and I wilbe glad of your company,
and for because that you haue promised to bee my
HE: I will take vpon me this name, your SHE.
               
            
            THis letter I haue séene, of hir own hand writing: and
as therin the Reader may finde great difference of
Style, from hir former letter, so may you nowe vnderstand
the casue. Shée had in the same house a friend, a seruaunt,
a Secretary: what should I name him? such one
as shée estéemed in time past more than was cause in
tyme present, and to make my tale good, I will (by
report of my very good friend F. I.) discribe him vnto
you. Hée was in height, the proportion of twoo

               Pigmeys, in bredth the thicknesse of two bacon hogges, of
presumption a Gyant, of power a Gnat, Apishly wytted,
Knauishly mannerd, &amp; crabbedly fauord, what was there
in him then to drawe a fayre Ladies liking? Marry sir
euen all in all, a well lyned pursse, wherwith he could at
euery call, prouide such pretie conceytes as pleased hir
péeuish fantasie, and by that meanes he had throughly
(long before) insinuated him selfe with this amorous
dame. This manling, this minion, this slaue, this secretary,
was nowe by occasion rydden to London forsothe:
and though his absence were vnto hir a disfurnishing of
eloquence: it was yet vnto F. I. an opertunitie of good
aduaūtage, for when he perceiued the change of hir stile,
and therby grew in some suspicion that the same proceded
by absence of hir chiefe Chauncellor, he thought good
now to smyte while the yron was hotte, and to lend his
Mistresse such a penne in hir Secretaries absence, as he
should neuer be able at his returne to amende the well
writing thereof, wherfore according to hir commaund
he repayred once euery daye to hir chamber, at the least,
whereas he guided him selfe so wel, and could deuise such
store of sundry pleasure and pastymes, that he grew in
fauour not onely with his desired, but also with the rest
of the gentlewomen. And one daye passing the time amongst
them, their playe grew to this end, that his Mistresse,
being Quéene, demaunded of him these thrée questions.
Seruaunt (quod she) I charge you, aswell vppon
your allegiance being nowe my subiect, as also vppon
your fidelitie, hauing vowed your seruice vnto mée
that you aunswere me these thrée questions, by the very
truth of your secret thought. First, what thing in this vniuersall
world doth most reioyce and comforte you? F. I.
abasing his eyes towardes the ground, toke good aduisement
in his aunswere, when a fayre gentlewoman of
the company clapped him on the shoulder, saying, how

now sir, is your hād on your halfpeny? To whom he aunswered,
no fayre Lady, my hand is on my harte, and yet
my hart is not in myne owne handes: wherewithall abashed
turning towardes dame Elinor he sayed. My souereigne
&amp; Mistresse, according to the charge of your commaund,
and the dutie that I owe you, my tongue shal bewraye
vnto you the truth of myne intent. At this present
a rewarde giuen me without desert▪ doth so reioyce mée
with continuall remembraunce therof, that though my
mind be so occupied to thinke thereon, as that daye nor
night I can be quiet from that thought, yet the ioye and
pleasure which I conceiue in the same is such, that I can
neither be cloyed with continuaunce therof, nor yet afrayde,
that any mishap can counteruayle so great a treasure.
This is to me such a heauen to dwell in, as that I
féede by day, and repose by night, vpon the fresh record
of this reward, this (as he sayeth) he ment by the kysse
that she lent him in the Gallery, and by the profession of
hir last letters and wordes. Well, though this aunswere
be somewhat mistie, yet let my friendes excuse be: that
taken vppon the sodeyne he thought better to aunswere
darkely, then to be mistrusted openly. Hir second questiō
was, what thing in this life did moste greue his harte,
and disquiet his mind, whereunto he answered. That although
his late rehersed ioye were incomparable, yet the
greatest enimie that disturbed the same, was the priuie
worme of his owne giltie conscience, which accused him
euermore with great vnworthinesse: and that this was
his greatest grief. The Lady byting vppon the bit at his
cunning answeres made vnto these two questions, gan
thus replie, Seruant, I had thought to haue touched you
yet nearer with my third question, but I will refrayne
to attempt your pacience: and now for my third demaūd,
aunswere me directly in what manner this passion doth
handle you? and howe these contraries maye hang together

by any possibilitie of concorde? for your wordes are
strauunge. F. I. now rowsing him selfe boldly toke occasion
thus to handle his aunswere. Mistresse (quod he)
my wordes in dede are straunge, but yet my possion is
is much straunger, and theruppon this other day to content
mine owne fātasie I deuised a Sonet, which although
it be a péece of Cocklorells musicke, and such as I might
be ashamed to publish in this company, yet because my
truth in this aunswere may the better appeare vnto you,
I pray you vouchsafe to receiue the same in writing: and
drawing a paper out of his packet presented it vnto hir,
wherin was written this Sonet.
            
            G. T.
            
               
                  LOue, hope, and death, do stirre in me such strife,
                  As neuer man but I led such a life.
                  First burning loue doth wound my hart to death,
                  And when death comes at call of inward griefe
                  Colde lingering hope, doth feede my fainting breath
                  Against my will, and yeeldes my wound reliefe:
                  So that I liue, but yet my life is such,
                  As death would neuer greue me halfe so much.
                  No comfort then but only this I tast,
                  To salue such sore, such hope will neuer want,
                  And with such hope, such life will euer last,
                  And with such life, such sorrowes are not skant.
                  Oh straunge desire, O life with torments tost
                  Through too much hope, mine onely hope is lost.
                  
                     Euen HE F. I.
                  
               
            
            THis Sonet was highly commended, and in my iudgement
it deserueth no lesse, I haue heard F. I. saye,
that he borowed th'inuentiun of an Italian: but were it
a translation or inuention (if I be Iudge) it is both prety
and pithy. His dutie thus perfourmed, their pastimes ended,

and at their departure for a watch worde hée counselled
his Mistresse by little and little to walke abrodesayinge
that the Gallery neare adioyning was so pleasaunt,
as if he were halfe dead hée thought that by walking
therin he might bée halfe and more reuiued. Think
                  •
               
you so seruaunt (quod she?) and the last tyme that I walked
there I suppose I toke the cause of my mallady, but
by your aduise (and for you haue 
                  •
               o clerkly steynched my
bleeding) I will assaye to walke there to morow. Mistres
quod he, and in more ful accomplishment of my duetie towards
you, and in sure hope that you wil vse y• same one
lie to your owne priuate cōmoditie, wil there awaite vppon
you, &amp; betwene you &amp; me wil teach you the ful order
how to steynch the bléeding of any creature, wherby you
shall be as cuning as my selfe. Gramercy good seruaunt,
qd she, I thinke you lost the same in writing here yesterday,
but I cannot vnderstand it, and therfore to morrowe
(if I féele my selfe any thing amended) I wil send for you
thither to enstruct me throughly: thus they departed. And
at supper time, the Knight of the Castel finding fault that
his gestes stomacke serued him no better, began to accuse
the gro
                  •
               enes of his vyands, to whom one of the gentlewomen
which had passed the afternoone in his company,
aunswered. Nay sir qd she, this gentleman hath a passiō,
the which once once in a daye at the least doth kill his appetite.
Are you so well acquainted with the disposition of
his body qd the Lord of the house? by his owne saying, qd
she, &amp; not otherwise. Fayre Ladie qd 
               F. I. you either mistoke
me or ouerheard me then, for I told of a comfortable
humor which so 
                  •
               ed me with continual remēbrance of
ioye, as y• my stomack being ful therof doth desire in maner
none other vittayles. Why sir, qd y• host, do you then
liue by loue? God forbid Sir quod F. I. for then my
chéekes wold be much thinner then they be, but there are
diuers other greater causes of ioy, then y• doubtful lottes

of loue, and for myne owne part, to be playne, I cannot
loue, and I dare not hate. I would I thought so, quod the
gentlewoman. And thus with prety nyppes, they passed
ouer their supper: which ended, the Lord of the house require
                  •
               
               F. I. to daunce and passe the tyme with the gentlewoman,
which he refused not to doe. But sodenly, before
the musicke was well tuned, came out Dame Elynor in
hir night attyre, and said to the Lord, that (supposing the
solitarinesse of hir chāber had encreased hir maladie) she
came out for hir better recreaciō to sée them daūce, Wel
done daughter (quod the Lord.) And I Mistres (quod F.
I.) would gladly bestowe the leading of you about this
great chamber, to dryue away the fayntnesse of your feuer.
No good seruaunt, quod the Lady, but in my stéede, I
pray you daunce with this fayre Gentlewoman, pointing
him to the Lady that had so taken him vp at supper. F. I.
to auoyde mistrust, did agrée to hir request without furder
entreaty. The daunce begon, this Knight marched
on with the Image of S. Fraunces in his hand, and S. Elynor
in his hart. The violands at ende of the pauion staied
a whyle: in which time this Dame sayde to F. I. on
this wyse. I am right sorry for you in two respects, although
the familiarity haue hytherto had no great continuance
betwene vs: and as I do lament your case, so doo
I reioyce (for myne own contentation) that I shall now
sée a due triall of the experiment which I haue long desired.
This sayd, she kept silence. When F. I. (somewhat
astonied with hir straunge spéeche) thus aunswered: Mystres
although I cannot conceyue the meaning of your
wordes, yet by curtesy I am constrayned to yeelde you
thankes for your good will, the which appeareth no lesse
in lamenting of mishaps, than in reioycing at good fortune.
What experiment you meane to trye by mée, I
know not, but I dare assure you, that my skill in experiments
is very simple. Herewith the Instruments sounded

a new Measure, and they passed forthwardes leauing
to talke, vntill the noyse ceassed: which done, the gentlewoman
replied. I am sory sir, that you did erewhile, denie
loue and all his lawes, and that in so open audience.
Not so quod F. I. but as the word was roundly taken, so
can I readely aunswere it by good reason. Wel quod she,
how if the hearers will admit no reasonable aunswere?
My reason shall yet be neuerthelesse (quod he) in reasonable
iudgement. Herewith she smyled, and he cast a glance
towardes dame Elinor askances art thou pleased? Againe
the vyols called them forthwardes, and againe at the end
of the braule sayd F. I. to this gentlewoman: I pray you
Mistres, and what may be the second cause of your sorow
sustained in my behalfe? Nay soft quod she, percase I haue
not yet told you the first, but content your selfe, for the second
cause you shall neuer know at my handes, vntill I
sée due trial of the experiment which I haue long desired.
Why then (quod she) I can but wish a present occasion to
bring y• same to effect, to ye end that I might also vnderstād
ye mistery of your meaning. And so might you fail of
your purpose (quod she) for I meane to be better assured
of him that shall know the depth of mine intent in such a
secrete, than I do suppose that any creature (one except)
may be of you. Gentlewomā (quod he) you speak Greeke,
the which I haue now forgotten, and myne instructers
are to farre from mée at this present to expound your
words. Or els to neare (quod she) and so smiling stayed
hir talke, when the musick called them to another daūce.
Which ended, F. I. halfe afrayd of false suspect, and more
amazed at this straunge talke, gaue ouer, and bringing
Mistresse Fraunces to hir place was thus saluted by his
Mistresse. Seruaunt (quod she) I hadde done you great
wrong to haue daunced with you, con
                  ••
               dering that this
gentlewoman and you had former occasion of so waighty
conference. Mistresse sayd F. I. you had done mée great

pleasure, for by our conference I haue but brought my
braynes in a busie coniecture. I doubt not (sayd his Mistresse)
but you wil end that busines easely. It is hard said
F. I. to end the thing, wherof yet I haue founde no beginning.
His Mistresse with change of countenaunce
kept silence, whereat dame Fraunces reioycing, cast out
this bone to gnawe on. I perceyue (quod she) it is euill to
halt before a Creple. F. I. perceyuing now that his Mistresse
waxed angry thought good on hir behalfe thus to
aunswere: and it is euill to hop before them that runne
for the Bell: his Mistresse replied, and it is euill to hang
the Bell at their héeles which are alwayes running. The
L. of he Castle ouerhearing these proper quippes, rose
out of his chayre, and comming towards F. I. required
him to daunce a Gallyard. Sir sayd F. I. I haue hitherto
at your apoyntment but walked about the house, now if
you be desirous to sée one tomble a turne or twayne, it is
like ynough tyat I might prouoke you to laugh at mée,
but in good faith my dauncing dayes are almost done, and
therfore sir (quod he) I pray you speake to them that are
more nymble at tripping on the toe. Whilest hée was
thus saying dame Elynor had made hir Congey, and was
now entring the doore of hir chamber: when F. I. all amazed
at hir sodeyne departure followed to take leaue of his
Mistresse: but she more then angrie, refused to heare his
good night, and entring hir chamber caused hir mayde
to clappe the doore. F. I. with heauie cheare returned to
his company, and Mistresse Fraunces to toutch his sore
with a corosiue sayd to him softly in this wise. Sir you
may now perceyue that this our countrie cannot allowe
the French maner of dauncing, for they (as I haue heard
tell) do more commonly daunce to talke, then entreate to
daunce. F. I. hoping to driue out one nayle with another,
and thinking this a meane most conuenient to suppresse
all ielous supposes, toke Mistresse Fraunces by the hand
                  •
               
               
and with a heauie smyle aunswered. Mistresse and I
(because I haue séene the french maner of dauncing) will
eftsones entreat you to daunce a Bargynet: what meane
you by this quod Mistresse Fraunces. If it please you to followe
(quod he) you shall sée that I can iest without ioye,
and laugh without lust, and calling the musitions, caused
them softly to sound the Tyntarnell, when he clearing his
voyce did Alla Napolitana applie these verses following,
vnto the measure.
            G. T.
            
               IN prime of lustie yeares, when Cupid caught me in
               And nature taught the way to loue, how I might best begin:
               To please my wandring eye, in beauties tickle trade,
               To gaze on eche that passed by, a carelesse sporte I made.
            
            
               With sweete entising bayte, I fisht for many a dame,
               And warmed me by many a fire, yet felt I not the flame:
               But when at last I spied, the face that please me most,
               The coales were quicke, the wood was drie, &amp; I began to tost
                     •
                  .
            
            
               And smyling yet full oft, I haue beheld that face,
               When in my hart I might bewayle mine owne vnluckie case:
               And oft againe with lokes that might bewray my griefe,
               I pleaded hard for iust reward, and sought to find reliefe.
            
            
               What will you more? so oft, my gazing eyes did seeke
               To see the Rose and Lilly striue vppon that liuely cheeke:
               Till at the last I spied, and by good profe I found,
               That in that face was paynted playne, the pearcer of my woūd.
            
            
               Then (all to late) agast, I did my foote reitre,
               And sought with secrete sighes to quench my greedy skalding fire:
               But lo, I did preuayle asmuch to guide my will,
               As he that seekes with halting heele, to hop against the hill.
            
            
               
               Or as the feeble sight, would serche the sunny beame,
               Euen so I found but labour lost, to striue against the streame.
               Then gan I thus resolue, since liking forced loue,
               Should I mislike my happie choyce, before I did it proue?
            
            
               And since none other ioye I had but hir to see,
               Should I retire my deepe desire? no no it would not bee:
               Though great the duetie were, that she did well deserue,
               And I poore man, vnworthy am so worthy a wight to serue,
            
            
               Yet hope my comfort stayd, that she would haue regard
               To my good will, that nothing crau'd, but like for iust reward:
               I see the Faucon gent sometimes will take delight,
               To seeke the sollace of hir wing, and dally with a kite.
            
            
               The fayrest Woulf will chuse the foulest for hir make,
               And why? because he doth endure most sorrowe for hir sake▪
               
               Euen so had I like hope, when dolefull dayes were spent,
               When weary wordes were wasted well, to open true entent.
            
            
               When fluddes of flowing teares, had washt my weeping eyes,
               When trembling tongue had troubled hir, with loude lamenting cries:
               At last hir worthy wil would pitie this my playnt,
               And comfort me hir owne poore slaue, whom feare had made so faint.
            
            
               Wherfore I made a vow, the stonie rocke should start,
               Ere I presume, to let hir slippe out of my faithfull hart.
            
            
               Lenuoie.
               And when she sawe by proofe, the pith of my good will,
               She tooke in worth this simple song, for want of better skill.
               And as my iust deserts, hir gentle hart did moue,
               She was content to answere thus: I am content to loue.

            THese verses are more in number than do stand with

that the Epythetes are aptly applied, &amp; the verse of it self
pleasant enough) I note that by it he ment in cloudes to
discipher vnto Mistres Fraunces such matter as she wold
snatch at, and yit could take no good hold of the same. Furthermore,
it aunswered very aptly to the note which the
musike sounded, as the skilfull reader by due triall may
approue. This singing daunce, or daunsing song ended,
Mistres Fraunces giuing due thanks, séemed weary also
of the company, and profering to departe, gaue yit this
farewell to F. I. not vexed by choller, but pleased with
contentation, and called away by heauy sléepe: I am constreyned
(quod she) to bid you good night, and so turning
to the rest of the company, tooke hir leaue. Then the
Maister of the house commaunded a torch to light F. I. to
his lodging, where (as I haue heard him saye) the sodeyn
chaunge of his Mistres countenance, togither with the
straungenes of Mistresse Fraunces talke, made such an
encounter in his mynde, that he could take no reste that
night: wherefore in the morning rysing very earely (although

                here, for the truth is that F. I. himselfe had so

                  〈…〉
               
therin, that he neuer presented it, but to y• matter. Whē
he had long (and all in vayn) looked for the cōming of his
Mistres into hir appointed walk: he wandred into y• park
néere adioyning to the Castle wall; where his chaunce
was to méete Mistresse Fraunces, accompanied with one
other Gentlewoman, by whom he passed with a reuerēce

of curtesie: and so walking on, came into the side of a thicket▪
where he sat down vnder a trée to allay his sadnesse
with solitarines. Mistres Fraunces, partly of curtesie and
affection, and partly to content hir mind by continuance
of such talk as thei had commenced ouer night, entreated
hir companion to goe with hir vnto this trée of reformacion,
whereas they found the Knight with his armes vnfolded
in a heauy kind of contemplation, vnto whom Mistres
Fraunces stepped apace, (right softly) &amp; at vnwares
gaue this salutation. I little thought Syr Knight (quod
she) by your euensong yesternight, to haue found you presently
at such a morrow masse, but I perceiue you serue
your Saint with double deuotion: and I pray God graūt
you treble méede for your true intent. F. I. taken thus vpon
the sodeine, could none otherwise answer but thus:
I told you Mistresse (quod he) that I could laughe without

                  ••
               , and iest without ioye: and there withall starting
vp, with a more bolde countenance came towardes the
Dames, profering vnto them his seruice, to wayte vpon
thē home wards. I haue heard say oft times (qd Mistres
Fraunces) that it is hard to serue two Maisters at one
time, but we wilbe right glad of your company. I thank
you (quod F. I.) and so walking on with them, fell into
sundry discourses, still refusing to touch any part of
their former communicacion, vntill Mistresse Frauuces
sayd vnto him: by my troth (quod thée) I would bee your
debtour these two dayes, to aunswer me truely but vnto
one question that I will propound: fayre Gentlewoman
(quod hée) you shall not neede to becomme my bebtour,
but if it please you to quit question by questiō, I wil
be more ready to gratifie you in this request, than either
reason requireth, or than you would be willing to worke
my cōtentatiō. Master F. I. (qd she, &amp; y• sadly) peraduētur
you know but a litle how willing I would be to procure

your contentation, but you know that hitherto familiaritie
hath taken no déepe roote betwixt vs twayne. And
though I find in you no maner of cause whereby I might
doubt to commit this or greater matter vnto you, yit
haue I stayed hitherto so to doe, in doubt least you might
thereby iustly condempne mée both of arrogancy and
lack of discretion, wherwith I must yit foolishly affirm,
that I haue with great payne brydeled my tonge from
disclosing the same vnto you. Such is then the good will
that I beare towards you, the which if you rather iudge
to bée impudencie, than a friendly meaning, I may then
curse the hower that I first concluded thue to deale with
you: herewithall being now red for chaste bashefulnesse,
shée abased hir eyes, and stayed hir talke, to whom F. I.
thus aunswered. Mistresse Fraunces, if I should with so
excéeding villanie requite such and so excéeding courtesie,
I might not onely séeme to digenerate from all gentry,
but also to differ in behauiour from all the rest of my lyfe
spent: wherefore to be playne with you in few wordes,
I thinke my selfe so much bound vnto you for diuers respects,
as if abilitie doe not fayle mée, you shall fynde mée
myndfull in requitall of the same: and for disclosing your
mind to mée, you may if so please you aduenture it without
aduenture, for by this Sunne, quod hée, I will not
deceyue such trust as you shall lay vppon mée, and furthermore,
so farre foorth as I may, I wilbe yours in any
respect: wherfore I beséech you accept me for your faithfull
friend, and so shall you surely find mée. Not so, quod

                  pe (quod hée) if you so be pleasedand: thus agreed, they
two walked a parte from the other Gentlewoman, and
fell into sad talke, wherein Mistresse Fraunces dyd very
curteousely declare vnto him, that in déed, one cause of

hir sorrow susteyned in his behalfe, was that he had sayd
so openly ouer night, that hée could not loue, for shée perceyued
very well the affection betwéene him and Madame
Elynor, and she was also aduertised that Dame
Elynor stood in the portall of hir chamber, harkening to
the talke that they had at supper that night, wherefore
she séemed to be sory that such a woord (rashely escaped)
might become great hinderaunce vnto his desire: but a
greater cause of hir grief was (as she declared) that hys
hap was to bestowe his lyking so vnworthely, for shee
séemed to accuse Dame Elynor, for the most vnconstant
woman lyuing: In full profe whereof, she bewrayed vnto
F. I. how she the same Dame Elynor, had of long time
ben yéelded to the Mynion Secretary, whom I haue before
described: in whom though there bee (quod shée) no
one point of worthynesse, yit shameth she not to vse him

this not withstanding Dame Elynor had bene also sundry
tymes woone to choyce of chaunge, as she named vnto
F. I. two Gentlemen whereof the one was named
H. D. and that other H. K. by whom shee was during
sundry tymes of their feuerall aboad in those parties, entreated
to like 
                  •
               urteousie, for these causes the Dame
Fraunces séemed to mislike F. I. choice, and to lament
that she doubted in processe of time to sée him abused.
The experiment she ment was this, for that she thought
F. I. (I vse hir wordes) a man in euery respect very
woorthy to haue the seuerall vse of a more commodious
common, she hoped nowe to sée if his enclosure thereof
might be defensible against hir sayd Secretary, and such
like. These things and diuers other of great importance,
this courteouse Lady Fraunces did friendly disclose
vnto F. I. and furthermore, did both instruct and aduise
him how to procéede in his enterprise. Now to make my
talke good, and least the Reader might bee drawen in a

ielouse suppose of this Lady Fraunces; I must let you vnderstand
that shée was vnto F. I. a kinswoman, a virgin
of rare chastitie, singular capacitie, notable modestie,
and excellent beauty: and though F. I. had cast his
affection on the other (being a married woman) yit was
ther in their beauties no great difference: but in all other
good giftes a wonderfull diuersitie, as much as might be
betwene constancie &amp; 
                  •
               litting fantasie, betwene womāly
coūtenance &amp; girlish garishnes, betwene hot dissimulacion
&amp; temperate fidelitie. Now if any man will curiously
aske the question why F. I. should chuse the one and leaue
the other, ouer and besides the cōmon prouerbe? (So many
men so many minds) thus may be answered: we sée by cō

one is ouercome with lesse difficultie then that other.
Thus much in defence of this Lady Fraunces, &amp; to excuse
the choice of my friend F. I. who thought himself now no
lesse beholding to good fortune, to haue found such a trusty
friend, then bounden to Dame Venus, to haue wonne such
a Mistres. And to returne vnto my pretence, vnderstand
you, y• 
               F. I. (being now with these two fair Ladies come

not. Whē his assured Hope, perceiuing the same, gan thus
recomfort him: Good sir (qd she) if you trusted your trusty

therfore for that time arested there, &amp; a supersedias sent into
the great chāber vnto the Lord of the house, who expected
his cōming out of the parke. The dinner ended, &amp; he
throughly contented both wt welfare &amp; welcome, they fell
into sundry deuices of pastime: at last F. I. taking into

wher in I might well behold the aspectes and face of the

in Astronomy) trie the conclusions of myne aduentures.
And what found you therin (quod dame Fraunces?) you

               aried not long before his gracious Mistresse
had him to farewell, and to kepe his hower there
againe, when he should by hir be sommoned. Hereby F.
I. passed the rest of that daye in hope awayting the happy
time when his Mistresse shoulde sende for him. Supper
time came and passed ouer, and not long after came the
handmayd of the Lady Elynor into the great chamber, desiring
F. I. to repayre vnto their Mistresse, the which hée
willingly accomplished: and being now entred into hir

chamber, he might perceyue his Mistresse in hir nightes
attyre, preparinge hir selfe towardes bed, to whom F.
I. sayed: Why howe now Mistresse? I had thought this
night to haue sene you daunce (at least or at last) amongst
vs? By my troth good seruaūt (qd she) aduentured so soone
vnto the great chamber yesternight, that I find my selfe
somewhat sickly disposed, and therfore do streyne curtesie
(as you sée) to go the soner to my bed this night: but before
I slepe (quod she) I am to charge you with a matter
of waight, and taking him apart from the rest, declared
that (as that present night) she would talke with him
more at large in the gallery néere aioyning to hir chamber.
Here vppon F. I. discretely dissimuling his ioye, toke
his leaue and returned into the great chamber, where
he had not long continued before the Lord of the Castell
commaūded a torch to light him vnto his lodging, whereas
he prepared himselfe and went to bed, commaunding
his seruant also to go to his rest. And when he thought
aswell his seruaunt, as the rest of the houshold to be safe,
he arose again, &amp; taking his night gowne, did vnder the
same conuey his naked sword, and so walked to the gallerie,
where he found his good Mistresse walking in hir
night gowne and attending his comming. The Moone
was now at the full, the skies cleare, and the weather
temperate, by reason wherof he might the more playnely
and with the greater contentation behold his long desired
ioyes, and spreding his armes abrode to embrace
his louing Mistresse, he sayd: oh my deare Lady when
shall I be able with any desert to counteruayle the least
parte of this your bountifull goodnesse? The dame (whether
it were of feare in déede, or that the wylynes of womanhode
had taught hir to couer hir conceites with some
fyue dissimulation) stert backe from the Kning
                  •
               , and shriching
(but softly) sayd vnto him. Alas seruaunt what haue
I deserued, that you come against me with naked sword

as against an open enimie. F. I. perceyuing hir entent
excused himselfe, declaring that he brought the same for
their defence, &amp; not to offend hir in any wise. The Ladie
being therwith somwhat apeased, they began wt more cō
               fortable
gesture to expell the dread of the said late affright,
and sithens to become bolder of behauiour, more
familier in spéech, &amp; most kind in accomplishing of comon
comfort. But why hold I so long discourse in discribing
the ioyes which (for lacke of like experience) I cannot set
out to y• ful? Were it not that I knowe to whom I write,
I would the more beware what I write. F. I. was a
man, and neither of vs are sencelesse, and therfore I shold
slaunder him, (ouer and besides a greater obloquie to the
whole genealogie of Enaeas) if I should imagine that of
tender hart he would forbeare to expresse hir more tender
limbes against the hard floore. Suffised that of hir
curteouse nature she was content to accept bords for a
bead of downe, mattes for Camerike shéetes, and the
night gowne of F. I. for a counterpoynt to couer them,
and thus with calme cōtent, in stéede of quiet sléepe, they
be
                  •
               uiled the night, vntill the proudest sterre began to abandon
the fyrmament, when F. I. and his Mistresse,
were constrayned also to abandon their delightes, and
with ten thousand swéet kisses and straight embracings,
did frame themselues to play loth to depart. Wel, remedie
was there none, but dame Elynor must returne vnto
hir chamber, and F. I. must also conuey himselfe (as closely
as might be) into his chamber, the which was hard to
do, the day being so farre sprong, and hée hauing a large
base court to passe ouer before he could recouer his staire
foote doore. And though he were not much perceyued, yet
the Ladie Fraunces being no lesse desirous to sée an issue
of these enterprises, then F. I. was willing to couer them
in secresy, did watch, &amp; euen at the entring of his chamber
doore, perceyued the poynt of his naked sworde glistring

vnder the skyrt of his night gowne: wherat she smyled &amp;
said to hir selfe, this geare goeth well about. Wel, F. I.
hauing now recouered his chamber, he went to bedde, &amp;
there let him sléepe, as his Mistresse did on that otherside.
Although the Lady Fraunces being throughly tickled now
in all the vaynes, could not enioye such quiet rest, but arising,
toke another gentlewoman of the house with hir,
and walked into the parke to take the freshe ayre of the
morning. They had not long walked there, but they retorned,
and though F. I. had not yet slept sufficiently, for
one which had so farre trauayled in the night past, yet
they went into his chamber to rayse him, and comming
to his beds side, found him fast on sléepe. Alas

so it were quod dame Fraunces, but we will take awaye
somewhat of his, wherby he may perceyue that we were
here, and loking about the chamber, his naked sworde
presented it selfe to the handes of dame Fraunces, who
toke it with hir, and softly shutting his chamber doore againe,
went downe the stayres and recouered hir owne
lodging, in good order and vnperceyued of any body, sauing
onely that other gentlewoman which accompanied
hir. At the last F. I. awaked, and apparreling himselfe,
walked out also to take the ayre, and being throughly recomforted
aswell with remembraunce of his ioyes forepassed,
as also with the pleasaunt hermony which the
Byr
                  •
               es made on euery side, and the fragrant smel of the
redolent flowers and blossomes which budded on euery
braunche: hée did in these delightes compyle these verses
following.
            ¶The occasion (as I haue heard him rehearse) was by
encoūter that he had with his Lady by light of the moone:
and forasmuch, as the moone in middes of their delights
did vanish away, or was ouerspred with a cloud, thereuppon

he toke the subiect of his theame. And thus it ensueth,
called a imooneshine Banquet.
            G. T.
            
               DAme Cinthia hir selfe (that shines so bright,
               And deyneth not to leaue hir loftie place:
               But only then, when Phoebus shewes his face
               Which is hir brother borne and lends hir light,)
               Disdaynd not yet to do my Lady right:
               To proue that in such heauenly wightes as she,
               It sitteth best that right and reason be.
               For when she spied my Ladies golden rayes,
               Into the cloudes,
               Hir head she shrouds,
               And shamed to shine where she hir beames displayes.
            
            
               Good reason yet, that to my simple skill,
               I should the name of Cynthia adore:
               By whose high helpe, I might behold the more
               My Ladies louely lookes at mine owne wil,
               With deepe content, to gare, and gaze my fil:
               Of curteousie and not of darke disdaine,
               Dame Cinthia dis
                     •
                  losd my Lady playne,
               She did but lend hir light (as for a lyte)
               With friendly grace,
               To shewe hir face,
               That els would shew and shine in hir dispight.
            
            
               Dan Phoebus he with many a lowring loke,
               Had hir heheld of yore in angry wise:
               And when he could none other meane deuise
               To stayne hir name, this deepe deceipt he toke
               To be the bayt
                     •
                   that best might hide his hoke:
               Into hir eyes his parching beames he cast,
               
                  To skorche their skinnes, that gaz'd on hir full fast:
               Whereby when many a man was sonne burnt so
               They thought my Queene,
               The sonne had been
               With skalding flames, which wrought them all that wo▪
               
            
            
               And thus when many a looke had lookt so long,
               As that their eyes were dimme and dazled both:
               Some fainting hartes that were both leude and loth
               To loke againe from whence the error sprong,
               Gan close their eye for feare of further wrong:
               And some againe once drawne into the maze,
               Gan leudly blame the beames of beauties blaze:
               But I with deepe foresight did sone espie,
               How Phoebus ment,
               By false entent,
               To slaunder so hir name with crueltie.
            
            
               Wherfore at better leasure thought I best,
               To trie the treason of his trecherie:
               And to exalt my Ladies dignitie
               When Phoebus fled and drew him downe to rest
               Amid the waues that walter in the west.
               I gan behold this louely Ladies face,
               Whereon dame nature spent hir gifts of grace:
               And found therin no parching heat at all,
               But such bright hew,
               As might renew,
               An Angels ioyes in reigne celestiall.
            
            
               The curteouse Moone that wisht to do me good,
               Did shine to shew my dame more perfectly,
               But when she sawe hir passing iollitie,
               The Moone for shame, did blush as red as blood,
               And sh
                     •
                  onke a side and kept hir hornes in hood:
               
                  So that now when Dame Cynthia was gone,
               I might enioye my Ladies lokes alone,
               Yet honored still the Moone with true intent:
               Who taught vs skill,
               To worke our will,
               And gaue vs place, till all the night was spent.
            
            F. I.
            THis Ballade, or howsoeuer I shall terme it, percase
you will not like, and yet in my iudgement it hath
great good store of déepe inuention, and for the order of
the verse, it is not common, I haue not heard many of
like proporcion, some will accompt it but a dyddeldome:
but who so had heard F. I. sing it to the lute, by a note of
his owne deuise, I suppose he would esteme it to bée a
pleasaunt diddeldome, and for my part, if I were not
parciall, I woulde saye more in commendacion of it
than nowe I meane to do, leauing it to your and like
iudgementes. And nowe to returns to my tale, by that
time, that F. I. retorned out of the parke, it was dynner
time, and at dynner they all met, I meane both dame Elynor,
dame Fraunces, and F. I. I leaue to discribe that the
Lady Fraunces was gorgeously attired, and set forth with
very braue apparell, and Madame Elynor onely in hir
night gowne gyrt to hir, with a coyfe trymmed Alla Piedmonteze,
on the which she ware a little cap crossed ouer
the crowne with two bends of yellowe Sarcenet or
Cipresse, in the middest whereof she had placed (of hir
owne had writing) in paper this word, Contented. This
attyre pleased hir then to vse, and could not haue displeased
Mistresse Fraunces, had she not bene more priuy to the
cause, than to the thing it selfe: at least the Lord of the
Castle of ignoraunce, and dame Fraunces of great temp
                  •
               
               rance,
let it passe without offence. At dynner, bicause the
one was pleased with all former reconninges, and the

other made priuie to the accompt, there passed no word of
taunt or grudge, but omnia bene. After dynner dame Elinor
being no lesse desirouse to haue F. I. company, then
dame Fraunces was to take him in some pretie trippe,
they began to questiō how they might best passe the day:
the Lady Elynor séemed desirous to kepe her chamber, but
Mistresse Fraunces for another purpose séemed desirous
to ryde abrode thereby to take the open ayre: they agréed
to ryde a myle or twayne for sollace, and requested F. I.
to accompany them, the which willingly graunted. Eche
one parted from other, to prepare themselues, and now
began the sporte, for when F. I. was booted, his horses
sadled, and he ready to ryde, he gan mysse his Rapier,
wherat al astonied he began to blame his man, but blame
whom he would, found it could not be. At last the Ladies
going towardes horsebacke called for him in the base
Court, and demaunded if he were readie: to whom F. I.
aunswered. Madames I am more than readie, and yet
not so ready as I would be, and immediatly taking him
selfe in trip, he thought best to vtter no more of his conceipt,
but in hast more than good spéede mounted his horse,
&amp; comming toward y• dames presented him self, turning,
bounding, &amp; taking vp his courser to the vttermost of his
power in brauery: after suffering his horse to breath him
selfe, he gan also allay his owne choller, &amp; to the dames he
sayd. Fayre Ladies I am ready when it pleaseth you to
ryde where so you commaund. How ready soeuer you be
seruaunt, quod dame Elinor, it séemeth your horse is readier
at your commaunde then at oures. If he bée at my
commaund Mistresse (quod hée,) he shalbe at yours. Gramercy
good seruaunt (quod shée) but my meaning is,
that I feare he be to stirring for our cōpany. If he proue
so Mistres qd 
               F. I. I haue here a soberer palfrey to serue
you on. The Dames being mounted they rode forthwardes
by the space of a myle or very neare, and F. I.
               
(whether it were of his horses corage or his own choler)
came not so neare them as they wished, at last the Lady
Fraunces said vnto him: Maister I. you said that you had
a soberer horse, which if it be so, we wold be glad of your
company, but I beleue by your coūtinance, your horse &amp;
you are agréed. F. I. alighting called his seruaunt, chaū
               ged
horses with him, and ouertaking the Dames, said to
Mistres Fraunces: And why doe you thinke faire Lady
that my horse and I are agréed? Bicause by your countenance
(quod she) it seemeth your pacience is stirred. In
good faith, quod F. I. you haue gessed a right, but not with
any of you. Then we care the lesse seruaunt, quod Dame
Elinor▪
                By my troth Mistres. qd 
               F. I. (looking well about
him that none might heare but they two) it is with my
seruaunt, who hath lost my sword out of my chamber.
Dame Elinor little remembring the occasion, replied it
is no matter seruaunt, quod shee, you shall heare of it againe,
I warrant you, and presently wée ryde in Gods
peace, and I turst shall haue no néede of it: yet Mistresse
quod he, a weapon serueth both vses, aswell to defend,
as to offend. Now by my troth, quod Dame Fraunces, I
haue now my dream, for I dreamt this night that I was
in a pleasaunt meadow alone, where I met with a tall
Gentleman, apparelled in a night gowne of silke all embroadered
about with a gard of naked swords, and when
he came towardes me I séemed to be afraide of him, but
he recomforted me saying, be not afrayd fayre Lady, for
I vse this garment onely for myne own defence: and in
this sort went that warlicke God Mars what time hée
taught dame Venus to make Vulcan a hamer of the newe
fashion. Notwithstanding these comfortable wordes the
fright of the dreame awaked me, and sithens vnto this
hower I haue not slept at al. And what tyme of the night
dreamt you this quod F. I? In the grey morning about
daw
                  •
               ing of y• day, but why aske you quod dame Fran̄ces?

F. I. with a great sigh answered, because that dreames
are to be marched more at some hower of the night, then
at some other, why are you so cunning at the interpretation
of dreames seruaunt (quod the Lady Elynor?) not
very cunning Mistresse quod F.I. but gesse, like a young
scholler. The dames continued in these and like pleasant
talkes: but F. I. could not be mery, as one that estemed
the preseruation of his Mistresse honor no lesse then the
obtayning of his owne delightes: and yet to auoyde further
suspicion, he repressed his passions, asmuch as hée
could. The Lady Elynor more carelesse then consideratiue
of hir owne case, pricking forwardes said softly to F. I. I
had thought you had receiued small cause seruaunt to bée
thus dumpish, when I would be mery. Alas déere Mistresse
quod F. I. it is altogether for your sake, that I am
pensife: dame Fraunces with curtesie withdrewe hir sel
                  •
               e
and gaue them leaue when as F. I. declared vnto his Mistresse,
that his sword was taken out of his chamber, and
that he dreaded much by the wordes of the Lady Fraunces,
that she had some vnderstanding of the matter. Dame Elynor
now calling to remembraunce what had passed the
same night, at the first was abashed, but immediatly (for
these women be redely wyt
                  •
               ed) chered hir seruaunt, and
willed him to commit vnto hir the saluing of that s
                  •
               re.
Thus they passed the rest of the waye in pleasaunt talke
with dame Fraunces, and so returned towards the Castle
where F. I. suffered the two dames to go together, and
he alone vnto his chamber to bewayle his owne misgouernement.
But dame Elynor (whether it wer according
to olde custome, or by wylie pollicie) found meane that
night, y• the sword was conueyed out of Mistres Fraunces
chamber and brought vnto hirs and after redeliuerie
of it vnto F. I. she warned him to be more wary from
that time forthwards: well I dwell too long vppon these
particular poynts in discoursing this trif
                  •
               ing history, but

that the same is the more apte meane of introduction to y•
verses, which I meane to reherse vnto you, and I think
you wil not disdaine to read my conceipt with his inuention
about declaration of his commedie. The next that euer
F. I. wrote thē, vpon any aduēture hapned betwene
him and this fayre Lady, was this as I haue heard him
say, and vppon this occasion. After he grew more bold &amp;
better acquaynted with his Mistresse disposition, he aduentured
one Fryday in the morning to go vnto hir chā
               ber,
and theruppon wrote as followeth: which he termed
a Frydayes Breakefast.
            G. T.
            
               
                  TThat selfe same day, and of that day that hower,
                  When she doth raigne, that mockt Vulcane the Smith:
                  And thought it meete to harbor in hir bower,
                  Some gallant gest for hir to dally with.
                  That blessed hower, that blist and happie daye,
                  I thought it meete, with hastie steppes to go:
                  Vnto the lodge, wherein my Lady laye,
                  To laugh for ioye, or ells to weepe for wo.
                  And lo, my Lady of hir wonted grace,
                  First lent hir lippes to me (as for a kisse:)
                  And after that hir body to embrace,
                  Wherein dame nature wrought nothing amisse.
                  What followed next, gesse you that knowe the trade,
                  For in this sort, my Frydayes feast I made.
                  
                     F. I.
                  
               
            
            THis Sonet is short and swéete, reasonably well, according
to the occasion &amp;c. Many dayes passed these
two louers with great delight, their affayres being no
lesse politikely gouerned, than happely atchiued. And
surely I haue heard F. I. affirme in sad earnest, that hée
did not onely loue hir, but was furthermore so rauished
in Extasies with continual remembrance of his delights,

that he made an Idoll of hir in his inward conceypte. So
séemeth it by this challenge to beautie, which he wrote in
hir prayse and vppon hir name.

                  And chuse the cheapest chaffayre still, to please their fansie best.
                  But I whose stedfast eyes, could neuer cast a glance,
                  With wādring loke, amid the prease, to take my choice by chaūce
                  Haue wonne by due desert, a piece that hath no peere,
                  And left the rest as refuse all, to serue the market there:

but paynting, bolstring, forcing and such like the which
in his rage he iudgeth good ynough to serue the Courte:
and theruppon grew a great quarrell. When these verses
were by the negligence of his Mistresse dispersed into
sundry hands, and so at last to the reading of a Courtier.
Well F. I. had his desire if his Mistresse lyked them,
but as I haue heard him declare, she grew in ieolosie, that
the same were not written by hir, because hir name was
Elynor and not Hellen. And about this poynt haue bene
diuers and sundry opinions, for this and diuers other of
his most notable Poems, haue come to view of y• world,

this prayse vnto a Hellen, who deserued not so well

written in hir prayse as followeth.
            G. T.
            
               
                  THE stately Dames of Rome, their Pearles did weare,
                  About their neckes to beautifie their name:
                  But she (whom I do serue) hir peeres doth beare,
                  Close in hir mouth, and smiling shewes the same.
                  No wonder then, though eu'ry word she speakes,
                  A Iewell seem
                        •
                      in iudgment of the wise▪

                  Betwene two rocks, bedeckt with pearles of price.
                  
                     Hir haire of gold, hir front of Iuory,
                  (A bloudy hart within so white a brest)
                  Hir teeth of Pearle, lippes Rubie, christall eye,
                  Needes must I honour hir aboue the rest:
                  Since she is fourmed of none other moulde,
                  But Rubie, Christall, Iuory, Pearle, and Golde.
                  
                     F. I.
                  
               
            
            OF this Sonet I am assured that it is but a t
                  •
               anslation,
for I my selfe haue séene the inuention of an Italian,
and Master I. hath a little dylated the same, but
not much besides the sence of the first, and the addicion very
aptly applied: wherfore I cannot condempne his doing
therin, and for the Sonet, were it not a little to much
prayse (as the Italians do most commonly offend in the
superlatiue) I could the more commend it: but I hope the
partie to whom it was dedicated, had rather it were much
more, than any thing lesse. Well, thus these two Louers
passed many dayes in exceding contentation▪ 
               
                  •
                more than
speakeable pleasures, in which time F. I. did compyle very
many verses according to sundrie occasions proffred,
whereof I haue not obteyned the most at his handes▪ and
the reason that he denied me the same, was that (as he alleged)
they were for the most part sauced with a taste of
glory, as you know that in such cases a louer being charged
with ine
                  •
               priuable ioyes, and therewith enioyned
both by dutie and discretion to kepe the same couert, can
by no meanes deuise a greater consolation, than to commit
it into some cyphred wordes and figured spéeches in
verse, whereby he féeleth his harte halfe (or more than
halfe) eased of swelling. For as sighes are some present
ease to the pensife mind, euen so we find by experience,
that such secrete entre comoning of ioyes doth encrease
delight. I would not haue you conster my wordes to this

                  •
               ffecte, that I thinke a man cannot sufficiently reioyce in

the luckie lottes of loue, vnlesse he empart the same to
others: God forbid that euer I should enter into such a
                  •
               
heresie, for I haue alwayes bene of this opinion, that as
to be fortunate in loue, is one of the most inward contentatious
to mans mynde of all earthly ioyes: euen so if hée
do but once bewray y• same to any liuing creature, imemdiatlye
eyther dread of discouering doth bruse his brest
with an intollerable burden, or els he léeseth the principall
vertue which gaue effecte to his gladnes, not vnlike
to a Potycaries pot which being filled with swéete oyntmentes
or parfumes, doth reteyne in it selfe some sent
of the same, and being powred out doth returne to the
former state, hard, harshe, and of small sauour: So the
minde being fraught with delightes, as long as it can
kepe them secretly enclosed, may continually féede vppon
the pleasaunt record thereof as the well willing and readie
horse byteth on the brydle, but hauing once disclosed
them to any other, strayghtway we loose the hidden treasure
of the same, and are oppressed with sundry doubtfull
opinions and dreadfull conceipts. And yet for a man to
record vnto him selfe in the inward contemplation of his
mynde the often remembrance of his late receiued ioyes,
doth as it were ease the hart of burden, and ad vnto the
mynd a fresh supplie of delight, yea and in verse principally
(as I conceyue) a man may best contriue this way
of comforte in him selfe. Therfore as I haue sayde F. I.
swymming now in delightes did nothing but write such
verse as might accumilate his ioyes, to the extremitie
of pleasure, the which for that purpose he kept from mée,
as one more desirous to séeme obscure and defectiue,
than ouermuch to glory in his aduentures, especially for
that in the end his hap was as heauie, has hitherto he had
bene fortunate, amongst other I remembred one hapned
vppon this occasion. The husband of the Lady Elynor bebeing
all this while absent from hir, gan now retorne, &amp;

kept Cut at home, with whom F.I. found meanes so to
ensignuate himselfe, that familiaritie tooke déepe 
                  •
               oot
                  •
               
betwene them, and seldome but by 
                  ••
               elth you could 
                  ••
               nde
the one out of the others company. On a tyme the knight
ryding on hunting desired F. I. to accompany him, the
which he could not refuse to do, but like a lusty younker,
readie at all assayes, apparrelled him selfe in gréene, and
about his neck a Bugle, pricking &amp; gallowping amongst
the formost, according to the mannor of that countrie.
And it chaūced that the maried Knight thus gallowping
lost his horn, which some deuines might haue interpreted
to be but moulting, &amp; that by Gods grace, he might haue
a newe come vp againe shortly in stéede of that. Wel,
he came to F. I. requiring him to lend him his▪ Beugle,
for (sayd the Knight) I hard you not blowe this daye, and
I would fayne encourage the houndes, if I had a horne.
Quod F. I. although I haue not ben ouer lauishe of my
comming hitherto, I woulde you shoulde not doubt but
that I can tell howe to vse a horne well enough, and
yet I may little do if I maye not lende you a horne, and
therewithall tooke his Beugle from his necke, and lent
it to the Knight, who making in vnto the houndes, gan
assaye to rechate: but the horne was to hard for him to
wynde, whereat F. I. tooke pleasure, and sayde to him
selfe, blowe tyll thou breake that: I made thee one with
in these fewe dayes, that thou wilt neuer cracke whiles
thou liuest. And hereupon (before the fal of the Buck) deuised
this Sonet following, which at his home comming
he presented vnto his mistresse.
            G. T.
            
               
                  As some men say there is a kind of seed
                  Will grow to hornes if it be sowed thick:
                  
                     Wherwith I thought to trye if I could breed
                  A brood of buddes, well sharped on the prick:
                  And by good proofe of learned skill I found,
                  (As on some speciall soyle all seedes best frame)
                  So ielouse braynes doe breed the battle ground,
                  That best of all might serue to beare the same.
                  Then sought I foorth to find such supple soyle,
                  And cald to mynd thy husband had a brayne,
                  So that percase, by trauayll and by toyle,
                  His fruitfull front might turne my seed to gayne:
                  And as I groped In that ground to sowe it,
                  Start vp a horne, thy husband could not blow it.
                  
                     F.I.
                  
               
            
            THis Sonet treateth of a straung séede, but it tasteth
most of Rye, which is more cōmon amongst mē nowadays:
wel let it passe amōgst y• rest, &amp; he that liketh it not,
turn ouer y• leaf to another, I dout not but in this register
he may find some to content him, vnlesse he be to curious:
and here I will surcease to rehearse any more of his verses,
vntill I haue expressed how that his ioyes being now
exalted to the highest degrée, began to bend towardes declination.
For now the vnhappy Secretary whom I haue
before remembred, was returned from London, on whō
               F.I. had no sooner cast his eyes, but immediatly he fel into
a great passion of mynd, which might be compared vnto
a feauer. This fruit grew of the good instructions that
his Hope had planted in his mind, whereby I might take
iust occasion to forwarn euery louer, how they suffer this
venemous serpent ielousie to créepe into their conceipts:
for surely, of all other diseases in loue, I suppose that to be
vncurable, and would hold longer discourse therin, were

it not that both this tale and the verses of F. I. himselfe
hereafter to be recited, shalbe sufficient to speak for me in
this behalf. The louer (as I say vpon the sodein) was drouen
into such a malladie, as no meate might nourish his
body, no delights please his minde, no remembrance of
ioyes forepassed content him, nor any hope of the lyke to
come might recomfort him: hereat (some vnto whom I
haue imparted this tale) haue takē occasion to discōmend
his faynting hart, yit surely the cause inwardly, &amp; depely
considered, I cannot so lightly condempne him, for an old
saying is, that euery man can giue councell better than
follow it: and néeds must the conflicts of his thoughts be
straunge, betwene the remembraunce of his forepassed
pleasure, and the present sight of this monster whom before
(for lack of like instruction) he had not so throughly
marked and beh
                  •
               l
                  •
               . Well, such was the grief vnto him,
that he became sickly and kept his chamber. The Ladies
hauing receyued the newes therof, gan al at once lament
his misfortun, and of common consent agréed to visit him:
they marched thither in good equipage, I warrant you,
and found F. I. lying vpon his bed languishing, whō they
all saluted generally, and sought to recomforte, but especially
his Mistresse, hauing in hir hand a braunch of willow,
wherewith thée defended hir from the whot ayre, gā
thus say vnto him: Seruaunt (quod she) for that I suppose
your mallady to procéede of none other cause but only
slouthfulnesse, I haue brought this preaty rod to beate
you a little: nothing doubting, but when you féele the
smart of a twig or twayne, you will like a tractable yong
scholler, pluck vp your quickned spirits, &amp; cast this drowsines
apart. F. I. with a great sighe answered: Alas good
Mistres (quod he) if any like chastisement might quicken
me, how m
                  •
               ch more might the presence of all you louely
Dames? recomfort my dulled mynd whō to behold▪ were
sufficien
                  •
                to reuiue an eye now dazled with the dread of

death, and that not onely for the heauenly aspectes which
you represent, but also much the more for your excéeding
curtesie, in that you haue deigned to visit mée so vnworthy
a seruaunt: But good Mistres (quod he) as it were
shame for me to confesse that euer my hart could yéelde
for feare, so I assure you that my minde cannot be content
to induce infirmitie by sluggish conceyt: But in
trueth Mistresse I am sicke (quod he), and there withall
the trembling of his hart had sent vp such throbbing into
his throte, as that his voyce (now depriued of breath) cō
               maunded
the tong to be still. When Dame Elynor for
compassion distilled into teares, and drew towards the
window, leauing the other Gentlewomē about his bed,
who beinge no lesse sory for his grief, yit for that they
were none of them so touched in their secrete thoughtes,
they had bolder sprits and fréeer spéech to recomfort him:
amongest the rest the Lady Fraunces, (who in deede loued
him déepely, and could best coniecture the cause of his cō
               ceipts)
said vnto him: Good Trust (quod shée) if any helpe
of Phisick may cure your maladie, I would not haue you
hurt your selfe with these doubts which you séeme to retayne:
If choice of Dyet may helpe, behold vs here (your
cookes) ready to minister all things néedfull: if company
may dryue away your anoye, wee meane not to leaue
you solitary: if grief of mynde be cause of your infirmitie,
wée all here will offer our deuoyre to turne it into ioye:
if mishap haue giuen you cause to feare or dreade any
thing, remember Hope, which neuer fayleth to recomfort
an afflicted mind. And good Trust (quod she) (dis
                  •
                reining
his hand right hartely) let this simple profe of our
poore good willes be so accepted of you, as that 
                  •
               t may
work therby the effect of our desires. F. I. (as one in a
traunce) had marked very litle of hir curteouse talke, and
yet gaue hir thanks, and so held his peace: whereat the

Ladies (being all amazed) there became a silence in the
chamber on all sides. Dame Elynor fearing thereby that
she might the more easely be espyed, and hauing nowe
dryed vp hir teares, returned to F. I. recomforting him
by al possible meanes of common curtesie, promising that
since in hir sicknes he had not only staūched hir bléeding,
but also by his gentle company and sundry deuices of honest
pastime had dryuē away the pensiuenes of hir mind,
she thought hir selfe bound with like willingnes to do hir
best in any thing that might restore his health? and taking
him by the hand sayd further: Good seruaunt, if thou
beare in déed any true affection to thy poore Mistres, start
vpon thy féet agayn, and let hir enioye thyne accustomed
seruice to hir comfort, for sure (quod shée) I will neuer
leaue to visite this chamber once in a day, vntill I may
haue thée down with mée. F. I. hearing the harty words
of his Mistres, and perceyuing the earnest maner of hir
pronunciation, began to receyue vnspeakable comfort
in the same, and sayde. Mistres, your excéeding curtesie
were able to reuiue a man half dead, and to me it is both
great comfort, and it doth also gald my remembraunce
with a continuall smart of myn own vnworthinesse: but
as I would desire no longer lyfe, than til I might be able
to deserue some part of your bounty, so I will ende
                  •
               our
my selfe to liue, were it but onely vnto that ende, that I
might merit some part of your fauour with acceptable
seruice, and requite some deale the courtesie of all these
other faire Ladies, who haue so farre (aboue my desertes)
deigned to do me good. Thus said, the Ladies tarried not
long before they were called to Euensong, when his Mistres
taking his hand, kissed it saying: Farewell good seruaunt,
and I pray thée suffer not the malice of thy sicknesse
to ouercome the gentlenes of thy good hart. F.I. rauished
with ioy, suffered them all to depart, and was not

able to pronounce one word. After their departure, hée
gan cast in his mind the excéeding curtesie vsed towards
him by them all: but aboue all other the bounty of his
Mistresse, and therewithall tooke a sounde and firme opinion,
that it was not possible for hir to coūterfeit so déeply
(as in déed I beléeue that she then did not) whereby he
sodenly felt his hart greatly eased, and began in himselfe
thus to reason. Was euer man of so wretched a harte? I
am the most bounden to loue (quod he) of all them that
euer professed his seruice, I enioy one the fayrest that euer
was found, and I find hir the kindest that euer was
heard of: yit in myne owne wicked hart I could villaynously
conceiue that of hir, which being compared with
the rest of hir vertues is not possible to harbour in so noble
a mind. Hereby I haue brought my self without cause
into this féeblenes, and good reason that for so high an
offence I should be punished with great infirmitie: what
shall I then doe? yéeld to the same? no, but according to
my late protestation I will recomfort this languishing
mind of myne, to the end I may liue but onely to doe penaunce
for this so notable a crime so rashly committed:
and thus saying, he start from his bed, and gan to walke
towards the window: but the venimous serpent which
(as before I rehearsed) had stong him, could not bee content
that these medicines applied by the mouth of his
gentle Mistresse, should so soone restore him to guerison.
And although in déed they were such Mythrydate to F. I.
as that they had nowe expelled the rancour of the poyson,
yit that ougly hellish monster had left behinde hir in
the most secret of his bosome, (euen betwene the mynd
and the man) one of hir familiars named Suspect, which
gan work in the weake sprites of F. I. efects of no lesse
perill than before hée had conceyued: his head swelling
with these troublesome toyes, and his hart swimming in
the tempests of tossing fantasie: he felt his legges so féeble,

that he was cōstrained to lye down on his bed again,
and repeating in his own remembraunce euery woord
that his Mistres had spoken vnto him, he gan to dreade,
that she had brought the willow braunce to beate him
with, in token that he was of hir forsaken: for so louers
doe most commonly expound the will
                  •
                we garland, and
this to think, did cut his hart in twayne. A wonderfull
chaunge: and here a little to stay you, I will discribe (for
I think you haue not red it in Ariosto) the beginning,
the fall, the retourne, and the bying of this hellish byrd,
who in déed may well be counted a very limbe of the Diuill.
Many yeares since, one of the most dreadful dastards
in the world, and one of them that first deuised to weare
his beard at length, least the barbor might do him a good
turne sooner than he looked for it, and yit not so soone as
he deserued, had builded for his securitie a pile on the hyghest
and most inaccessible mount of all his Territories:
the which being fortified with strong walles, and enuironed
with déepe ditches, had no place of entrie, but one
onely doore so streight and narrow, as might by any possibility
receiue the body of one liuing man, from which he
ascended vp a ladder, &amp; so créeping thorough a maruelous
strayt hole, attained to his lodging, y• which was so dark &amp;
obscure, as scarcely either sunne or ayre could enter into
it: thus hee deuised to lodge in safetie, and for the more
suertie gan trust none other letting downe this ladder
but only his wife, and at the foote therof kept alwaies by
day light, a firce masti
                  •
                close enkeneled which neuer
sawe nor heard the face or voyce of any other creature
but onely of them two, him by night he trusted with the
scout of this prety passage, hauing neuerthelesse betwene
him and this dogge, a double doore with treble locks, quadriple
barres: and before all a port coulez of Iron: neyther
yit could he be so hardy as to sléep vntil he had caused
a gard of seruauntes (whome hée kept abroade for that
purpose) to searche all the corners adioyning to his fortresse,

and then betwene fearfull sweate and chyuering
cold, with one eye open and the other closed, he stole somtimes
a broken sléepe, deuided with many terrible dream
                  •
               s.
In this sort the wretch liued all to long, vntill at
last his wife being not able any longer to supporte this
hellish life, grew so hardy, as with his owne knife to dispatch
his carkas out of this earthly purgatory: the which
being done his soule (and good reason) was quickly conueyed
by Carone vnto hell: there Radamanthus Iudge of
that benche, commaunded him quickly to be thrust into a
boyling poole: and being therein plonged very often, he
neuer shriked or cryed, I skalde, as his other companions
there cried, but séemed so lightly to estéeme it, that
the Iudge thought méete to condempne him vnto the
most terrible place, where are such torments, as neyther
penne can write, tongue expresse, or thought conceyue:
but the myser (euen there) seemed to smyle and
to make small accompt of his punishment. Radamanthus
hereof enformed▪ sent for him, and demaunded the cause
why he made so light of his durance? he aunswered that
whyles he liued on earth, he was so continually afflicted
and oppressed with suspicion, as that now (only to thinke
that he was out of those meditacions) was sufficient armour
to defend him from all other torments. Radamanthus

that kingdome, and propounded this question, how &amp; by
what punishement they might deuise to touche him according
to his deserts? and herupō fell great disputation,
at last being cōsidered that he had already bin plonged in
the most vnspeakable torments, &amp; therat litle or nothing
had chaunged coūtenāce, therwithall y• no soule was sent
vnto thē to be relieued of his smart, but rather to be punished
for his former delights: it was cōcluded by y• general
ceūcel, yt he shold be eftsones sent into y• world &amp; restored
to the same body wherein he first had his resiance, so to
remain for perpetuity, and neuer to depart nor to perish.

Thus this body and soule being once againe vnited, and
now eftsones with the same pestilence infected, hée became
of a suspicious man Suspicion it selfe: and now the
wretch remembring the treason of his wyfe, who had so
willingly dispatched him once before, gan vtterly abhor
hir and fled hir company, searching in all countries some
place of better assurance: and when hée had in vayn trode
on the most part of the earth, he embarked himself to find
some vnknowen Iland wherein hée might frame s
                  •
               me
new habitacion, and finding none so commodious as hée
desired, he fortuned (sayling along by the shoare) to espie
a rock, more than sixe hundreth Cubits high, which hong
so suspiciously ouer the seas, as though it would threaten
to fall at euery little blast: this did Suspicion Imagine
to be a fit foundacion whereon he might buyld his second
Bower: hée forsooke his boate, and trauayled by land to
espie what entrie or accesse might be made vnto y• same,
and found from land no maner of entrie or accesse, vnlesse
it were that some curteouse Byrd of the ayre would
be Ambassadour, or conuey some Engins, as whilom the
Eagle did carrie Ganymedes into heauen. He then returned
to Seas, and approching néere to his rock, founde a
small streame of fresh water issuing out of the same into
the Seas: the which, although it were so little and so
straight, as might vnethes receiue a boate of bignes to
carry one liuing creature at once, yit in his conceipt hée
thought it more large and spacious than that broad way
called of our forefathers Via appia, or than that other named
Flaminia: hée abandoned his bark, and putting of hys
clothes, aduētured (for he was now assured not to drown)
to wade and swim against the streame of this vnknown
brooke, the which (a wondrous thing to tell, and skarcely
to be beléeued) came down from the very top and height
of this rock: and by the way he found six straight &amp; dangerous
places, wher the water séemed to stay his course,

passing vnder sixe straight and lowe bridges, and hard by
euery of those places, a pyle raysed vp in manner of a
Bulworke, the which were hollow, in such sort as lodginges
and other places necessary might in them commodiously
be deuised, by such one as coulde endure the hellishnes
of the place. Passing by these hée attayned with
much payne vnto the toppe of the Rocke, the which hée
found hollowed as the rest, and farre more fit for his securitie,
than otherwise apt for any cōmoditie. There gan
suspicion determyne to nestle him selfe, and hauing now
placed six chosen porters, to wit, (Dread, Mistrust, Wrath,
Desperation, Frensie, and Fury:) at these six straunge Bulworks,
he lodged him self in ye vij. al alone, for he trusted
no companye, but euer mistrustinge that his wyfe
should eftsones find him out, therein he shrieketh continually
like to a shrich owle to keepe the watch waking,
neuer content to sléepe by day or by night. But to be sure
that he shoulde not ouer sléepe him selfe, gan stuffe his

                  •
               ouch with Porpentines quilles, to the ende that when
heauy sleepe ouercame him, and he therby should be constrayned
to charge his pallad with more heauie burden,
those plumes might then pricke through and so awake
him. His garments were stéele vpon Iron, and that Iron
vppon Iron, and Iron againe, and the more he was armed,
the lesse he trusted to be out of daunger. He chopped
and changed continually now this, now that, new keyes,
new lockes, ditches newe skowred, and walles newly
fortified, and thus alwayes vncontented liueth this wretched
helhound Suspicion in this hellish dungion of habitation,
from whence he neuer remoueth his foote, but only
in the dead &amp; silent nights, when he may be assured that
all creatures (but him selfe) are whelmed in sound sléepe.
And then with stealing steps he stalketh about the earth,
enfecting, tormēting, and ve
                  •
               ing al kinds of people with
some part of his afflictions, but especially such as either

do sit in chayre of greatest dignitie and estimation, or els
such as haue atchiued some déere and rare emprise: Those
aboue al others he contynually galdeth with fresh woūds
of dread, least they might loose and forgo the roomes wherunto
with such long trauayle and good happes they had
atteyned, and by this meanes percase he had crept into
the bosome of F.I. who (as is before declared) did earst
swimme in the déepest seas of earthly delightes. Nowe
then I must thinke it high time to retorne vnto him, who
being now through feeblenes eftsones cast downe vppon
his be

with ielosie, did compyle this translation of Ariostoes

                     As for to serue Cupid that God aboue?
                     If that our mindes were not sometimes infect,

                     In pleasures place, to haue more perfect plight.
                     The thirstie mouth thinkes water hath good taste,

                     An absent life long led in great anoye,
                     When presence comes, doth turne from griefe to game,
                     To serue without reward is thought great payne,
                     But if dispayre do not therewith remayne,

                     This is that sore, this is that poysoned wound,

                     F. I.
                  
               
            
            
            THis is the translation of Ariosto his xxxj. song, all but
the last staffe, which séemeth as an allegory applied to
the rest. It will please none but learned eares, hée was
tyed to the inuention, troubled in mynd &amp;c. So I leaue it
to your iudgment, and returne to F.I. who continued on
his bed, vntill his bountifull Mistresse with the companie
of the other curteous dames retorned after supper to
his chamber, at their first entrie: Why how now seruāt
(quod dame Elynor) we hoped to haue found you on foote?
Mistresse quod F.I. I haue assayed my féete since your departure,
but I find them yet vnable to suporte my heauy
body, and therfore am constrayned as you sée, to acquaint
my selfe with these pyllowes. Seruaunt sayd she I am
right sory therof, but since it is of necessitie to beare sicknesse,
I will employ my deuoyre to allaye some parte of
your paynes, and to refreshe your weary limbes with
some comfortable matter: and therwithall calling hir
handmayde, deliuered vnto hir a bounche of pretie little
keyes, and whispering in hir eare, dispatched hir towards
hir chamber. The mayde taried not long, but returned
with a little Casket, the which hir Mistresse toke, opened
and drew out of the same much fyne lynnen, amongst the
which she toke a pillowhere very fyne and swéete, which
although it were of it selfe as swéete as might be, being
of long time kept in that odoriferous chest, yet did shée
with damaske water (and that the best that might bée I
warrant you) all to sprinckle it with hir owne handes,
which in my conceipt might much amende the matter.
Then calling for a fresh pyllowe, sent hir mayde to ayre
the same, and at hir returne put on this, thus perfumed
pillowheare. In meane time also she had with hir owne
hands attyred hir seruants head in a fayre wrought kerchif
taken out of the same Casket, then layde him
downe vppon this fresh and pleasaunt place, and pretely
as it were in sporte, bedewed his temples with swéete

water which she had ready in a casting bottle of Gold,
kissing his chéeke and saying: Good seruaunt be whole,
for I might not longe endure thus to attende thée,
and yit the loue that I beare towards thée, cannot be content
to see thée languish: Mistres sayd F.I. (and that with
a trembling voyce) assure your self, that if there remayn
in mée any sparke of lyfe or possibilitie of recouery, then
may this excellent bountie of yours be sufficient to reuiue
me without any further trauayle or payn vnto your
persone, for whom I am highly to blame, in that I do not
spare to put you vnto this trouble: and better if were
that such a wretch as I had dyed vnknowen, than thay by
your exceding curtesie you should fall into any mallady,
eyther by resorting vnto me, or by these your paynes taken
about me. Seruaunt (quod she) all pleasures séeme
paynefull to them that take no delight therin, and likewise
all toyle séemeth pleasaunt to such as set their felicitie
in the same, but for mee be you sure, I do it with so
good a wyll that I can take no hurt therby, vnlesse I shall
perceyue that it be reiected or neglected, as vnprofitable
or vncomfortable vnto you. To me Mistresse quod F.I. it
is such pleasure, as neither my féeble tongue can expresse,
nor my troubled mind conceyue. Why? are you troubled
in mynd then seruaunt quod dame Elynor? F.I now blushing
answered, but euen as all sicke men be Mistresse.
Herewith they staid their talke a while, and the first that
brake silence was the Lady Fraunces, who sayde: and to
driue away the troubles of your mynd good Trust, I wold
be glad if we could deuise some pastime amongst vs to
kepe you company, for I remember that with such deuises
you did greatly recomfort this fayre Lady when shée
languished in like sorte. She languished in déede gentle
Hope, quod F.I. but God forbid that she had languished
in like sort. Euery body thinketh their griefe greatest qd
dame Elynor, but in déede whether my griefe were the

more or the lesse, I am right sorie that youres is such as
it is: And to assay whither our passions proceded of like
cause or not, I would we could (according to this Ladies
saying) deuise some like pastimes to trie if your malladie
would be cured with like medicines. A gentle woman of
the company whom I haue not hitherto named, and that
for good respects, least hir name might altogether disclose
the rest, gan thus propound. We haue accustomed (quod
she) heretofore in most of our games to chuse a Kyng or
Quéene, and he or she during their gouernement haue
charged euery of vs eyther with commaundementes or
questions as best séemed to their maiestie: wherein to
speake mine opinion we haue giuen ouer large a skope,
neyther séemeth it reasonable that one shoulde haue the
power to discouer the thoughts▪ or at least to brydle the
affects of all the rest. And though in déede in questioning
(which doth of the twayne more nerely touche the mind)
euery one is at free libertie to aunswere what they list:
yet oft haue I heard a question demaunded in such sorte,
and vppon such sodayne, that it hath bene hardly answered
without mouing matter of contention. And in commaundes
also, sometimes it happeneth one to bée commaunded
vnto such seruice, as eyther they are vnfit to
accomplish (and then the parties weakenes is therby detected)
or els to do something that they would not, wherof
ensueth more grutch then game. Wherefore in myne
opinion, we shall do well to chuse by lot amongst vs a gouernour,
who for that it shalbe sufficient preheminence
to vse the chayre of maiestie, shalbe boūd to giue sentence
vppon all such arguments and questions as we shall orderly
propound vnto them, and from him or hir (as from
an oracle) we will receiue aunswere, and decyding of our
lytigious causes. This dame had stuffe in hir, an old courtier,
and a wylie wench, whome for this discourse I will
name Pergo, least hir name natural were to brode before,

and might not drinke of all waters. Wel this proportion
of Pergo pleased them wel, and by lot it happened that F.I.
must be moderator of these matters, and collector of these
causes: the which being so constituted, the Lady Elynor
said vnto this dame Pergo. You haue deuised this pastime
(qd she) &amp; because we thinke you to be most expert in the
handling therof, do you propound the first question, &amp; we
shalbe both the more readye and able to followe your
example: the Lady Pergo refused not, but began on this
wise. Noble gouernor (qd she) amongst the aduentures
that haue befallen me, I remember especially this one,
that in youth it was my chaunce to be beloued of a very
courtlike young gentleman, who abode neare the place
wherin my parents had their restaunce. This gentleman
whether it were for beauty▪ or for any other respect that
he sawe in me, I know not, but he was enamored of me,
&amp; that with an exceding vehement passion, &amp; of such force
were his affects, that notwistāding many repulses which
he had receiued at my hands, he séemed dayly to growe in
the renewing of his desires. I on the otherside, although
I could by no meanes mislike of him by any good reason,
considering that hée was of byrth no waye inferior vnto
me, of possessions not to bée disdeyned, of parson right
comely, of behauyour Courtly, of manners modest, of
mynde lyberall, and of verteous disposition: yet such
was the gaitie of my mynd, as that I coulde not be content
to lend him ouer large thongs of my loue, but alwayes
daungerously behaued my selfe towardes him,
and in such sorte, as hée coulde neyther take comforte of
myne aunsweres, nor yet once finde him selfe requited
with one good looke for all his trauayle. This notwithstanding,
the worthy Knigh
                  •
                continued his sute wyth
no lesse vehement affection than earst hée hadde begone
it, euen by the space of seuen yeares. At the last, whether
discomfited by my dealinges, or tyred by long trauayle,

or that he had percase light vppon the lake that
is in the forrest of Ardena, and so in haste and all
thristie, had dronke some droppes of disdayne, whereby
his hot flames were quenched, or that he had vndertaken
to serue no longer but his iust terme of apprenticehode,
or that the téeth of time had gnawen and tyred his dulled
sprites in such sorte, as that all béenommed hée was constrayned
to vse some other artificial balme for the quickning
of his sences, or by what cause moued I know not,
he did not onely leaue his long continued sute, but (as I
haue since perceyed) grew to hate me more deadly than
before I had disdayned him. At the first beginning of his
retyre I perceiued not his hatred, but imagined that being
ouer wearied he had withdrawen him self for a time.
And considring his worthynes, therwithall his constancie
of long time proued, I thought that I could not in the
whole world find out a fitter match to bestowe my selfe,
than on so worthy a person, wherefore I did by all possible
meanes procure that he might eftsones vse his accustomed
repayre vnto my parents: And further, in all places
where I happened to méete him, I vsed all the curtes
                  •
               es
towardes him that might bée contayned within the
bondes of modestie, but al was in vayne, for he was now
become more daungerous to be wonne, than the haggard
Faulcon. Our lottes being thus vnluckely chaunged, I
grewe to burne in desire, and the more daungerous that
he shewed him selfe vnto me, the more earnest I was by
all meanes to procure his consent of loue. At the last I
might perceiue that not onely he disdayned me, but as me
thought boyled in hatred against me: and the time that I
thus continued tormented with these thoughts, was also
iust the space of seuen yeares. Finally when I perceiued
no remedie for my parplexities, I assayed by absence to
weare away this malladie, and therfore vtterly refused
to come in his presence, yea or almost in any other company,

whereby I haue consumed in lost time the flower
of my youth, and am become as you sée (what with yeares,
and what with the tormēting passions of loue) pale,
wan, and full of wrinkles, neuerthelesse, I haue therby
gayned thus much, that at last I haue wond my self cléere
out of Cupids cheines, and remain carelesse at libertie.
            Now marke to what end I tell you this: first vii. yeares
passed in the which I could neuer be content to yéeld vnto
his iust desires: next other vii. yeares I spent in séeking
to recouer his lost loue: and sithens both those vii. yeares,
there are euen now on saint Valentines day last, other vii.
yeares passed, in the which (neither I haue desired to sée
him) nor he hath coueted to heare of me. My parents now
perceiuing how the crowes foot is crept vnder myne eye,
and remembring the long sute that this gentlemā had in
youth spent on me, considering therewithall that gréene
youth is well mellowed in vs both, haue of late sought to
perswade a marriage betwene vs, the which the Knight
hath not refused to heare of, and I haue not disdained to
thinke on: by their mediation we haue bin eftsoones
brought to Parlee, wherein ouer and besides the ripping
vp of many old griefes, this hath ben chiefly rehearsed &amp;
obiected betwene vs, what wrong and iniury eche of vs
hath done to other, and hereabouts wée haue fallen to
sharpe contention: he alledged, that much greater is the
wrong which I haue done vnto him, than that repulse
which hée hath sithens vsed to me: and I haue affirmed
the contrary, the matter yit hangeth in variance. Nowe,
of you worthy Gouernour I would be most glad to heare
this question decided, remembring that ther was no difference
in the times betwene vs: and surely, vnles your
iudgement helpe me, I am afraide my marriage wilbe
marred, and I may goe lead Apes in hell. F. I. aunswered,
good Pergo, I am sory to heare so lamentable a discourse
of your luckles loue, and much the sorier, in that I

must néedes giue sentence against you: for surely great
was the wrong that either of you haue done to other, and
greater was the néedelesse grief which causelesse eche of
you hath conceiued in this long time, but greatest in my
iudgement hath ben both the wrong and the grief of the
Knight, in that notwithstanding his deserts (which your
self confesse) he neuer enioyed any guerdone of loue at
your handes: And you (as you alledge) did enioy his loue
of long time togither, so that by the reckoning, it will fall
out (although being blinded in your owne conceypt) you
sée it not, that of the one &amp; twenty yeares you enioyed his
loue vii. at the least, but that euer he enioyed yours wee
cannot perceiue. And much greater is the wrong that rewardeth
euill for good, than that which requireth tip for
tap: further, it séemed that where as you went about in
time to trie him, you did altogither loose time which can
neuer be recouered: and not onely lost your owne time,
whereof you would séeme now to lament, but also compelled
him to leese his time, which he might (be it spoken
without offence to you) haue bestowed in some other
worthy place: and therefore, as that grief is much greater
which hath no kind of cōfort to allay it, so much more
is that wrong which al
                  ••
               gither without cause is offered.
And I (said Pergo) must néedes think, that much easier is
it for them to endure grief which neuer tasted of ioy, and
much lesse is that wrong which is so willingly profered
to be by recompence restored: for if this Knight will confesse
that he neuer had cause to reioice in all the time of
his s
                  •
               ruice, then with better cōtentation might he abyde
grief than I, who hauing tasted of the delight which I did
secretly cōceiue of his deserts, do think ech grief a present
death by the remembrance of those forepassed thoughts: &amp;
lesse wrong séemeth it to be destitut of y• thing which was
neuer obteyned, than to be depriued of a iewell whereof
we haue bin already possessed: so y• vnder your correction

I might cōclude, that greater hath bin my grief &amp; iniury
susteined, than that of the Knight. To whom F.I. replied,
as touching delight, it may not be denied but that euery
louer doth take delight in the inward cōtemplacion of his
mind, to think of the worthines of his beloued, &amp; therfore
you may not alledge that the Knight had neuer cause to
reioice, vnlesse you will altogither cōdempne your self of
vnworthines: Mary if you will say that he tasted not the
delights that louers séeke, then mark, who was the cause
but your self? And if you would accuse him of like ingratitude,
for that he disdained you in the latter vii. yeres, whē
as he might by accepting your loue, haue recōpenced him
self of all former wrongs you must remēber ther withal,
that the crueltie by you shewed towards him was such, y•
could by no meanes perceiue that your chaūge procéeded
of good will, but rather eftsones to hold him enchained in
vnknown links of subtil dealings, &amp; therfore not without
cause he douted you: &amp; yit without cause you reiected him.
He had oftē sought occasion, but by your refusals he could
neuer find him: you hauing occasiō fast by the foretop did
dally with him so long, til at last he slipped his head from
you, &amp; then catching at the bald nodd
                  •
               e, you foūd your self
y• cause, &amp; yit you would accuse another. To cōclude, greater
is the grief that is susteined without desert, and much
more is the wrong that is offred without cause. Thus F.
I. decided the question propounded by Pergo, &amp; expected
that some other Dame should propoūd another: but his
mistres (hauing hir hand on another halfpeny) gan thus
say vnto him. Seruant this pastime is good, and such as I
must néeds like of, to driue away your pensiue thoughts:
but sléeping time approcheth, &amp; I feare we disquiet you,
wherefore the rest of this time we will (if so like you) bestowe
in trimming vp your bed and to morrow we shall
méete here and nenew this new begon game with Madame
Pergo. Mistres (qd 
               F. I.) I must obey your will, and
most humbly thanke you of your great goodnesse, and

all these Ladies for their curtesie: Euen so, requiring you
that you will no further trouble your selues about me,
but let my seruaunt alone with conducting me to bed.
Yes seruaunt (quod she) I wil sée if you can sléepe any better
in my shéetes: and therewith commaunded hir handmayd
to fetch a paire of cleane shéetes, the which béeing
brought (maruailous fine and swéete) the Ladies Fraunces
and Elyn
                     •
                  r did curteously vnfold them, and layd them
on the bed, which done, they also entreated F. I. to vncloth
him and go to bed: being layd, his Mistres dressed
and couched the clothes about him, sithens moistened his
temples with rosewater, gaue him handkerchewes and
other fresh linnen about him, in dooing wherof, she whispered
in his eare, saying: Seruaunt, this night I will bée
with thée, and after with the rest of the Dames gaue him
good night and departed, leauing F. I. in a traunce betwene
hope and dispayre, trust and mistrust. Thus he lay
rauished, commaunding his seruaunt to goe to bed, and
fayning that himself would assay if he could sléepe. About
ten or eleauē of the clock came his Mistresse in hir night
gowne, who knowing all priuy wayes in that house very
perfectly, had conueied hir self into F. I. chamber, vnséene
and vnperceyued, and being nowe come vnto his
beds side knéeled down, and laying hir arme ouer him
sayed these or like wordes: My good Seruaunt, if thou
knewest what perplexiteis I suffer in beholding of thine
infirmities, it might then suffise, eyther vtterly to dryue
away thy mallady, or much more to augment thy griefs:
for I know thou louest me, and I think also that thou hast
had sufficient profe of myne vnfained good will, in remembrance
whereof, I fall into sundry passions: First, I
compt the happy lots of our first acquaintance, and therin
I call to mynde the equalitie of our affections, for I
think that there were neuer two louers conioyned with
fréeer consent on both parties: and if my ouerhasty deliuery

of yéelding words be not wrested hereafter to my
condempnacion, I can then assure my self to escape for euer
without desert of any reprofe: herewithall I can not
forget the sundry aduentures happened since we became
one hart deuided in two bodies, all which haue ben both
happily atchieued, and delectably enioyed: what resteth
then to consider but this thy present state? The first corosiue
that I haue felt, and the last cordiall that I looke for,
the end of my ioyes, and the beginning of my torments,
and hereat hir salt teares gan bathe the dying lips of hir
seruaunt: who hearing these wordes, and well considering
hir demeanor, began now to accuse him selfe of such
and so haynous treason, as that his gilty harte was constreined
to yéelde vnto a iust scourge for the same. Hée
swooned vnder hir arme: the which when she perceyued,
it were hard to tel what feares did most affright hir. But
I haue heard my friend F. I. cōfesse, that he was in a happy
traunce, and thought himself for diuers causes vnhappely
reuiued. For surely I haue heard him affirme, that
to dye in such a passion▪ had ben rather pleasant, than like
to panges of death. It were hard now to rehearse how hée
was reuiued, since there wer none present, but he dying,
(who could not declare) &amp; she liuing, whowold not disclose
so much as I meane to bewray. For my friēd F.I. hath to
me emported, that returning to life, the first thing which
he felt, was that his good mistres lay pressing his brest wt
the whole weight of hir body, and biting his lips with hir
friendly téeth: and peraduenture shée refrayned (either of
curtesie towards him, or for womanish feare, to hurt hir
tender hand) to strik him on the chéekes in such sorte, as
they doe that striue to call agayne a dying creature: and
therefore thought this the aptest meane to reduce him
vnto remembrance. F.I. now awaked, could no lesse do,
than of his curteous nature receyue his Mistresse into
his bed: Who, as one that knew that waye better, than

how to help his swooning, gan gently strip of hir clothes,
and louingly embracing him, gan demaund of him in this
sorte. Alas good Seruaunt (quod she) what kinde of maladie
is this that so extréemely doth torment thée? F.I.
with faynting spéech aunswered: Mistresse, as for my maladie,
it hath ben easely cured by your bountifull medicines
applied: But I must confesse, that in receiuing that
guerison at your handes, I haue ben constreined to fall
into an Extasie, through the galding remembrance of
myne own vnworthines: Neuerthelesse good Mistresse,
since I perceiue such fidelitie remayning betwene vs, as
that fewe wordes will perswade such trust as louers
ought to embrace, let these fewe wordes suffise to craue
your pardon, and doe eftsoones powre vpon me (your vnworthy
seruaunt) the haboundant waues of your accustomed
clemency: for I must confesse, that I haue so highly
offended you, as (but your goodnesse surpasse the malice
of my conceipts) I must remayne (and that right woorthely)
to the seuere punishment of my desertes: and so
should you but loose him who hath cast away him self, and
neither can accuse you, nor dare excuse him selfe of the
crime. Dame Elynor, who had rather haue found hir seruaunt
perfectly reuiued, than thus with straunge conceipts
encombred: and musing much at his darke spéech,
became importunat to know y• certainty of his thoughts.
And F.I. as one not maister of him selfe, gan at the last
playnly confesse howe he had mistrusted the chaunge of
hir vowed affections: Yea and (that more was) he playnly
expressed with whom, of whom, by whom, and too
whom shée bent hir better liking.
            Now, here I would demaund of you and such other
as are expert: Is there any geater impediment to the
fruition of a Louers delights, than to be mistrusted? or
rather, is it not the ready way to race all loue and former

good will out of remembrance, to tell a gilty mynd
that you doe mistrust it? It should séeme yes, by Dame
Elynor, who began nowe to take the matter whottely,
and of such vehemency were hir fancies, that shée nowe
fell into flat defiance with F. I. who although hée sought
by many faire wordes to temper hir chollerike passions,
and by yeelding him selfe to 
                  •
               et the conquest of an other,
yet could hée by no meanes determine the quarrell. The
softe pillowes being present at all these whot wordes,
put forth themselues as mediatours for a truce betwene
these enemies, and desired that (if they would néedes
fight) it might be in their presence but onely one pusshe
of the pike, and so from thenceforth to become friends again
for euer. But the Dame denied flatly, alleadging
that shée found no cause at all to vse such curtesie vnto
such a re
                  •
               reant, adding further many wordes of great
reproche: the which did so encourage F. I. as that hauing
now forgotten all former curtesies, he drewe vppon his
new pr
                  •
               fessed enimie, and bare hir vp with such a violence
against the bolster, that before shée could prepare
the warde, he thrust hir through both hands, and &amp;c. wherby
the Dame swoning for feare, was constreyned (for a
time) to abandon hir body to the enemies curtesie. At
last when shée came to hir selfe, shée rose sodeinly and determined
to saue hir selfe by flight, leauing F. I. with
many dispytefull wordes, and swearing that hee should
neuer (eftsoones) take hir at the like aduātage, the which
othe she kept better than hir former professd good will:
and hauing nowe recouered hir chamber (bicause shee
founde hir hurt to be nothing daungerous) I doubt not,
but shee slept quietly the rest of the night: As F. I. also
perswading himselfe that hée should with conuenient
leysure recouer hir from this hagger conceipt, tooke some
better rest towardes the morning, than hee had done
in many nights forepast. So let them both slèepe whyles

I turne my penne vnto the before named Secretary, who
being (as I sayd) come lately from London, had made
many proffers to renew his accustomed consultations:
but the sorrow which his Mistresse had conceyued in F.I.
his sicknesse, togither with hir continuall repayre to him
during the same, had ben such lettes vnto his attempts,
at is was long time before he could obtayne audience.
            At the last these newe accidentes fell so fauourably for
the furtherance of his cause, that he came to his Mistresse
presence, and there pleaded for himselfe. Nowe, if I
should at large write his allegations, togither with hir
subtile aunsweres, I should but comber your eares
with vnpleasaunt rehearsall of feminine frayeltie.
            To be short, the late disdayneful moode which she had cō
               ceyued
against F.I. togither with a scrupule which lay in
hir cōscience, touching the xi. article of hir beléeue, moued
hir presently with better will to cōsult with this Secretary,
aswel vpon a spéedy reueng of hir late receiued wrōgs
as also vpon the reformation of hir religion. And in very
déed, it fell out that the Secretary hauing bin of long time
absēt, &amp; therby his quils &amp; pēnes not worn so néer as they
were wont to be, did now prick such faire large notes, y•
his Mistres liked better to sing faburden vnder him, thā
to descant any longer vppon F. I. playne song: and thus
they continued in good accorde, vntill it fortuned that
Dame Fraunces came into hir chamber vppon such sodeyn
as shée had like to haue marred all the musick. Wel
thei cōueied their clifs as closely as they could, but yit not
altogither wtout some suspiciō giuen to y• said dame Fraū
                  ces,
who although shée could baue bin content to take any
payn in F.I. behalf, yit otherwise she would neuer haue
bestowed the watching about so wortheles a prise. After
womāly salutacions they fel into sundry discourses, y• 
               Secretaty
stil abyding in y• chāber with them. At last two or

thrée other gentlewomē of the Castle came into Madam
Elynors chamber, who after their Bon iour did all (vna
voce) séeme to lament the sicknes of F.I. and called vpon
the Dames Elinor and Fraunces, to go visite him againe.
The Lady Fraunces curteously consented, but Madame
Elinor first alledged that she hir selfe was also sickly, the
which she attributed to hir late paynes taken about F. I.
and sayd that onely for that cause she was constrayned to
kepe hir bed longer than hir accustomed hower. The
Dames (but especially the Lady Fraunces) gan streight
waies coniecture some great cause of sodaine change, and
so leauing dame Elynor, walked altogether into the parke
to take the ayre of the morning: And as they thus walked
it chaūced that Dame Pergo heard a Cuckoe chaunt, who
(because the pride of the spring was now past) cried Cuck
cuck Cuckoe in hir stameringe voyce. A ha (quod Pergo)
this foule byrd begines to flye the countrie, and yet before
hir departure, sée how spitefully she can deuise to salute
vs. Not vs (quod Dame Fraunces) but some other
whom she hath espyed: wherewith Dame Pergo looking
round about hir, and espying none other company sayd.
Why here is no body but we few womē 
               qd she. Thanks
be to God the house is not farre from vs (quod Dame
Fraunces.) Here at the wylie Pergo partely perceyuing
Dame Fraunces meaning replyed on this sort: I vnderstand
you not (quod she) but to leape out of this matter,
shall we go visite Maister F. I. and sée how he doth this
morning? Why quod dame Fraunces, do you suppose that
the Cuckoe called vnto him? Nay marry quod Pergo, for
(as farre as I know) he is not maried. As who should say
(quod Dame Fraunces,) that the Cuckoe enuieth none but
maryed folkes. I take it so sayd Pergo: the Lady Fraunces
aunswered. Yes suer I haue noted as euill lucke in loue
(after the cuckoes call) to haue happened vnto diuers vnmaried
folkes, as euer I did vnto the maried: but I can

be well content that we go vnto Master. I. for I promised
on the behalfe of vs al, that we wold vse our best deuoyre
to recomfort him vntill he had recouered health, and I do
much meruayle that y• Lady Elinor is now become so vnwilling
to take any trauayle in his behalfe, especially remembring
that but yesternigh she was so diligent to
bring him to bed, but I perceyue that all earthly thinges
are subiect vnto change. Euen so they be quod Pergo, for
you may behold the trées which but euen this other daye
were clad in gladsome gréene, and now their leaues begin
to fa
                  •
               e and change colour. Thus they passed talking
and walking vntill they returned vnto the Castle,
whereas they went straight vnto F.I. chamber, &amp; found
him in bed: why how now Trust (quod Dame Fraunces,)
w
                  •
               ll it be no better? Yes shortly I hope quod F.I. The
Ladies all saluted him &amp; he gaue them the gramercy: at
the last Pergo popped this question vnto him. And howe
haue you slept in your Mistres shéetes Master F. I. quod
she? reasonable well quod F. I. but I pray you where is
my Mistresse this morning? Mary sayd Pergo, wee left
hir in bed scarce well at ease. I am the more sorye quod
F. I. Why Trust (sayd Mistresse Fraunces) be of good comforte,
and assure your selfe that here are others who
would be as glad of your wel doing, as your Mistresse in
any respect. I ought not to doubt therof (quod F. I.) hauing
the proofe that I haue had of your great curtesies,
but I thought it my dutie to aske for my Mistresse being
absent. Thus they passed some time with him vntill they
were called away vnto prayers, and that being finished
they went to dinner, where they met Dame Elynor attired
in a night kerchief after the soolenest (the solempnest
fashion I should haue sayed,) who loked very drowsely
vpon all folkes vnlesse it were hir secretary, vnto whom
she deigned sometime to lend a fréendly glaunce. The
Lord of the Castle demaunded of hir howe F.I. did this

morning. She answered that she knew not, for she had
not séene him that day. You may do wel then daughter (qd
the Lord) to go now vnto him, &amp; to assay if he wil eate any
thing, &amp; if here be no meates that like him, I pray you
commaund (for him) any thing that is in my house. You
must pardon me sir (quod she,) I am sickly disposed, and
would be loth to take the ayre: why then go you Mistres
Fraunce (quod he) and take some body with you: and I
charge you sée that he lacke nothing. Mistresse Fraunces
was glad of the ambassade, &amp; arysing from the table with
one other gentlewoman, toke with hir a dishe of chickins
boyled in white broth, saying to hir father: I thinke this
meate méetest for Master I. of any that is here. It is so
(qoud he) daughter, and if he like not that, cause somewhat
els to be dressed for him according to his apetite.
Thus she departed and came to F. I. who being plonged
in sundry woes and thrilled with restlesse thoughtes,
was now beginning to aryse: but seing the Dames, couched
downe againe, and sayd vnto them. Alas fayre Ladies
you put your selues to more paynes than eyther I
do desire, or can deserue. Good Trust quod Dame Fraunces,
our paines are no greater than dutie requireth, nor
yet so great as we could vouchsafe in your behalfe, and
presently my father hath sent vs vnto you (quod she) with
this pittaunce, and if your apetite desire any one thing
more than other, wée are to desire likewise that you
will not refrayne to call for it. Oh my good Hope (quod
hée) I perceiue that I shall not dye as longe as you
maye make mée liue. And being nowe somedeale recomforted
with the remembraunce of his Mistres words
which shée hadde vsed ouer night at hir first comming,
and also thinkinge that although shée parted in choller,
it was but iustly prouoked by him selfe, and that at
leasure hée shoulde fyn
                  •
               e some salue for that soore also:
hée determyned to take the comforte of his assured Hope,
               
and so to expell all venomnes of mistrust before receyued:
wherfore raysing him selfe in his bed, he cast a
night gowne about his shoulders saying: It shall neuer
be sayd that my faynting hart can reiect the comfortable
Cordialles of so fréendly phisitions. Nowe by my troth
well sayed gentle Trust quod Dame Fraunces, and in so
doing assure your selfe of guerison with spéed. This thus
sayed, the curteous Dame became his keruer, &amp; hée with
a bold spirite gan tast of hir cookery, but the late conflicts
of his conceipts had so disaquainted his stomack from repastes,
that he could not well away with meate: and yet
neuerthelesse by little &amp; little receyued some nouryture.
When his Hope had crammed him as long as she coulde
make him féede, they deliuered the rest to the other gentlewoman,
who hauing not dyned, fell to hir prouander.
In which meane while the Lady Fraunces had much cō
               fortable
spéech with F.I. and declared that she perceyued
very well the cause of his malladie, but my Trust (quod
she) be all whole, and remember what I foretold you in
the beginning: neuerthelesse you must thinke that there
are remedies for all mischiefes, and if you wilbe ruled by
myne aduise, we will soone find the meane to ease you of
this mishap. F. I. toke comforte in hir discretion, and
fréendly kissing hir hand, gaue hir a cartlode of thankes
for hir great good will, promising to put to his vttermost
force, and euermore to be ruled by hir aduise. Thus they
passed the dynner while, the Ladie Fraunces alwayes refusing
to declare hir conceipt of the late change which she
perceyued in his Mistresse, for shée thought best first to
wynne his will vnto conformitie by little and little, and
then in the end to persuade him with necessitie. When
the other gentlewoman had vytayled hir, they departed,
requiring F.I. to arise and boldly to resist the fayntnesse
of his feuer, the which he promised and so bad them a Di
                     •
                  .
The Ladyes at their returne found the courte in Dame

               Elynors chamber, who had there assembled hir secretary,
Dam Pergo, and the rest: there they passed an hower or
twayne in sundry discourses, wherin Dame Pergo did alwaies
cast out some bone for Mistresse Fraunces to gnaw
vppon, for that in déede she perceyued hir harty affection
towardes F.I: whereat Mistresse Fraunces changed no
countenaunce, but reserued hir reuenge vntill a better
oportunitie. At last (quod Dame Fraunces vnto Mistresse
Elinor) and when will you go vnto your seruaunt fayre
Lady? When he is sicke and I am whole quod Dame Elynor.
That is euen now quod the other, for how sicke hée
is your self can witnesse: and how well you are we must
beare record. You may aswel be deceiued in my disposition
(quod Dame Elynor) as I was ouerséene in his sodain
alteration, and if he be sicke you are méetest to be his phisition:
for you sawe yesterday that my paines did little
profite towardes his recōfort. Yes surely sayd the other,
not onely I but all the rest had occasiō to iudge that your
curtesie was his chiefe comfort. Well quod Dame Elinor
you know not what I know. Nor you what I think quod
Dame Fraunces. Thinke what you list quod Elynor. In
déede quod Fraunces I may not thinke that you care, neither
will I die for your pleasure: and so halfe angry shée
departed. At supper they met againe, and the Maister
of the house demaūded of his daughter Fraunces how F.I.
did? Sir (quod she) he did eate somewhat at dinner, and
sithens I saw him not. The more to blame quod he, and
now I would haue al you gentlewomen take of the best
meates and go suppe with him: for company driueth away
carefulnesse, and leaue you me here with your leauinges
alone. Nay sir quod Mistresse Elynor, I pray you
giue me leaue to beare you company, for I dare not aduenture
thither. The Lord of the Castle was contented &amp;
dispatched away the rest: who taking with them such vyandes
as they thought méetest, went vnto F.I. chamber,

fynding him vp, and walking about to recouer strength,
whereat Dame Fraunces reioysed, and declared how hir
father had sent that company to attend him at supper.
F. I. gaue great thankes, and missing now nothing but
his Mistresse, thought not good yet to aske for hir, but
because he partly gessed the cause of hir absence, he contented
him selfe, hoping that when his lure was newe
garnished, he shoulde easely reclayme hir from those coye
conceiptes. They passed ouer their supper all in quiet,
and sone after Mistresse Fraunces, being desirous to requite
Dame Pergoes quippes, requested that they might
continue the pastime which Dame Pergo had begon ouer
night: whereunto they all consented, and the lot fell
vnto Dame Fraunces to propounde the second question,
who adressing hir spéeche vnto F. I. sayde in this wyse.
Noble gouernor, I will reherse vnto you a straūge historie,
not fayned, neither borowed out of any olde aucthoritie,
but a thing done in déede of late daies, and not farre
distant from this place where wee nowe remayne. It
chaunced that a gentleman our neighbour being maried
to a very fayre gentlewoman, liued with hir by the space
of fower or fiue yeares in great contentation, trusting
hir no lesse than he loued hir, and yet louing hir as much
as any man coulde loue a woman. On that otherside the
gentlewoman hadde woon (vnto hir beautie) a singular
commendation for hir chast and modest behauiour. Yet
it happened in time that a lustie younge gentleman (who
very often resorted to them) obtayned that at hir handes▪
which neuer any man coulde before him attayne: and to
be playne, he woon so much in hir affections, that forgetting
both hir owne dutie and hir husbandes kindnes, she
yéelded hir body at the commaundement of this louer, in
which pastime they passed long time by their polliticks
gouernement. At last the friendes of this Lady (and especially
thrée sisters which she had) espied ouermuch familiaritie

betwene the two louers, and dreading least it
might breake out to their cōmon reproch toke their sister
apart, and declared that the worlde did iudge scarce well
of the repayre of that gentleman vnto hir house: and
that if she did not foresée it in time, she shoulde not onely
leese the good credite which she hir selfe had hitherto possessed,
but furthermore should distayne their whole race
with common obloquy and reproch. These and sundry other
godly admonitions of these sisters could not sinke in
the mind of this gentlewoman, for she did not onely stand
in defiaunce what any man coulde thinke of hir, but also
séemed to accuse them, that because they saw hir estimation
(being their yonger) to growe aboue their owne, they
had therfore deuised this meane to set variance betwene
hir husbande and hir. The sisters séeing their holesome
counsell so reiected, and hir continue still in hir obstinate
opinion, adressed their spéech vnto hir husbande, declaring
that the worlde iudged not the best, neyther they
themselues did very wel like of the familiaritie betwene
their sister and that gentleman, and therfore aduised him
to forecast all perils, and in time to forbid him his house.
The husband (on that otherside) had also conceyued such
a goo
                  •
                opinion of his gest, &amp; had growen into such a stricte
famyliaritie with him, y• you might with more ease haue
remoued a stone wall, than once to make him thinke amisse,
eyther of his wyfe, or of hir louer: Yea and immediately
after this conference he would not sticke thus to
say vnto his wyfe. Besse: (for so in dée
                  •
               e was hir name)
thou hast thrée such busie bray
                  •
               ed si
                  •
               ters, as I thincke
shortly their heads will breake: they woulde haue me to
bée tellous of thée, no no Besse &amp;c. so that hee was not
onely farre from any such beliefe, but furthermore dyd
euery day encrease his curtesies towardes the louer. The
sisters being thus on all sides reiected, and yet perceiuing
more and more an vnseemely behauiour betwene their

sister and hir miniō, began to melt in their owne grease:
and such was their enraged pretēce of reuenge, that they
suborned diuers seruants in the house to watch so dilligently,
as that this treason might be discouered. Amōgst
the rest, one mayde of subtill spirite had so long watched
them, that at last she espied them go into a chamber together,
and locke the doore to them: whereuppon she ranne
with all hast possible to hir Maister, and tolde him that if
he would come with hir, shée woulde shewe him a very
straunge sight. The gentleman (suspectinge nothinge)
went with hir vntill he came into a chamber neare vnto
that wherein they had shut themselues, and she poynting
hir Maister to the keyhole, bad him looke through, where
he sawe the thing which most might mislike him to behold.
Where at he sodaynely drewe his Dagger, and turned
towardes the mayde, who fled from him for feare of
mischiefe: but when he could not ouer take hir in the heat
of his choller, he commaunded that she should forthwith
trusse vp that little which she had and to depart his seruice:
and before hir departure he found meanes to talke
with hir, threatening that if euer she spake any word of
this mystery in any place where she should come, it shuld
cost hir lyfe. The mayde for feare departed in silence, and
the Master neuer changed coūtenance eyther to his wife
or to hir peramour, but feyned vnto his wyfe that he had
turned away the mayde vppon that sodaine, for that shée
had throwen a Kitchin knife at him, whyles he went about
to correct a fault in hir &amp;c. Thus the good gentleman
dranke vp his owne swette vnséene euery day, encreasing
curtesie to the louer, and neuer chaunging countenaunce
to his wyfe in any thing, but onely that he refrayned
to haue such knowlege of hir carnally as he in times
past had, and other men haue of their wyues. In this sort
he continued by the space all most of halfe a yeare, neuerthelesse
lamenting his mishap in sollitary places. At last

(what moued him I know not) he fell agayn to company
with his wife as other men doo, and as I haue heard it
saied he vsed this pollicy: euery time that he had knowledge
of hir, he would leaue either in the bed, or in hir cusshencloth,
or by hir looking glasse, or in some place wher
shée must néedes find it, a piece of mony which then was
fallen to thrée halfpence: and I remember they called thē
Slippes. Thus he dealt with hir continually by the space
of foure or fiue monethes, vsing hir neuerthelesse very
kindly in all other respectes, &amp; prouiding for hir al things
necessary at the first call: But vnto his geast he still augmented
his curtesie, in suche sorte, that you would haue
thought them to be sworne brothers. Al this notwithstā
               ding
his wife much musing at these thrée half peny péeces
which she founde in this sorte, and furthermore, hauing
sundry times found hir husband in solitarie places
making great lamentation, she grew enquisitiue, what
should be the secret cause of these alteracions: vnto whō
he would none otherwise answere, but that any mā shuld
finde occasion to be more pensiue at one time than at another.
The wife notwithstanding encreasing hir suspect,
emported the same vnto hir louer, alledging therwithall
that shée doubted very much least hir husband had some
vehement suspiciō of their affaires. The louer encoraged
hir, &amp; likewise declared, y• if she would be importunate to
enquire the cause, hir husband would not be able to kéepe
it from hir: and hauing now throughly enstructed hir, she
dealt with hir husband in this sorte. One day when shee
knew him to be in his study alone, she came in to him, and
hauing fast locked the dore after hir, and cōueyed the key
into hir pocked, she began first with earnest entreaty, and
then with teares to craue that he would no longer kéepe
from hir the cause of his sodein alteration. The husband
dissimuled the matter still: at last she was so earnest to
know for what cause he left money in such sort at sundry

times, that he aunswered on this wise: Wyfe (quod he)
thou knowest how long we haue ben maried togither, &amp;
how long I made so deare accompt of thée as euer man
made of his wife: since which dayes, thou knowest also
how long I refreyned thy company, and how long again
I haue vsed thy company leauing the mony in this sorte,
and the cause is this. So lōg as thou didst behaue thy self
faithfully towards me, I neuer lothed thy company, but
sithens I haue perceiued thée to be a harlot, therfore did
I for a time refreine and forbeare to lie with thée: &amp; now
I can no longer forbeare it, I do giue thée euery time that
I lye with thée a slip, which is to make thée vnderstande
thine own whordome: and this reward is sufficient for a
whore. The wife began stoutly to stand at defiance, but
the husband cut off hir spéeche and declared when, where,
and how he had séene it: hereat the womā being abashed,
and finding hir conscience gilty of asmuch as he had alledged,
fel down on hir knées, &amp; with most bitter teares craued
pardon, confessing hir offence: whereat hir husband
(moued with pitie) &amp; melting likewise in fluds of lamentation,
recōforted hir promising that if from that day forwards
she would be true vnto him, he wold not only forgiue
al that was past, but become more tender &amp; louing
vnto hir than euer he was. What do I tary so long? they
became of accord: &amp; in full accōplishment therof, the gentlewoman
did altogither eschew the company, the speech,
&amp; (as much as in hir lay) the sight of hir louer, although hir
husband did continue his curtesie to wars him, and often
charged his wife to make him fair semblant. The Louer
was now onely left in perpleritie, who knewe nothing
what might be the cause of all these chaunges, &amp; that most
greeued him, he could by no meanes obteyne agayn the
spéech of his desired: hee watched all opportunities, hée
suborned messangers, he wrote letters, but all in vayne.
In the end shée caused to be declared vnto him a time and

place where she would méete him and speake with him.
Being mett, she put him in remembrance of all that had
passed betwene them: shhe layed also before him howe
trusty shée had bin vnto him in all professions: she confessed
also how faithfully hee had discharged the dutie of a
friend in all respects, and therewithall she declared that
hir late alteration and pensiuenes of mind was not with
out great cause, for that she had of late such a mishap, as
might change the disposition of any liuing creature: Yea
and that the case was such, as vnlesse she found present
remedy, hir death must néedes ensue and that spéedely: for
the preuenting whereof, she alledged that she had beaten
hir braynes with all deuises possible, and that in the end
she could think of no redresse but one, the which lay only
in him to accomplishe. Wherfore she besought him for all
the loue and good will which passed betwene them, nowe
to shew the fruites of true friendship, and to gratifie hir
with a frée graunt to this request. The louer who had always
ben desirous to pleasure hir in any thing, but now
especially to recouer hir woonted kindnesse, gan frankly
promise to accōplish any thing that might be to him possible,
yea though it were to his great detriment: and
therewithall did déepely blame hir in that she would so
long torment hir selfe with any grief, considering that it
lay in him to helpe it. The Lady aunswered, that she had
so long kept it from his knowledge, bycause she doubted
whether he would be contented to performe it or not, althogh
it was such a thing as he might easely graūt without
any maner of hurt to himself: &amp; yit that now in ye end
she was forced to aduēture vpon his curtesie, being no lō
               ger
able to bear ye burdē of hir grief the louer solicited hir
most earnestly to disclose it: and she (as fast) séemed to mistrust
y• he would not accōpl
                  •
               sh it. In the end she tooke out
a booke (which shée had brought for the no
                  •
               ce) and bound
him by oth to accōplish it. The louer mistrusting nothing

lesse than that ensued, tooke the othe willingly: which don
she declared al that had passed betwene hir &amp; hir husband:
his grief, hir repentance, his pardon, hir vow, &amp; in ye ende
of hir tale enioined the louer, that frō thenceforthwards,
he should neuer attempt to break hir cōstant determination:
the louer replied that this was vnpossible: but shée
plainly assured him, y• if he graūted hir that request, she
would be his friend in all honest &amp; godly wise: if not, shée
put him out of doubt that she would eschew his cōpany &amp;
flie from his sight as from a scorpion. The louer considering
that hir request was but iust, accusing his own gilty
conscience, remembring the great curtesies always vsed
by hir husband, &amp; therwithal séeing the case now brought
to such an issue, as y• by none other meanes than by this
it could be cōceiled frō knowledge of the world: but most
of all, being vrged by his oth, did at last giue an vnwilling
consent, &amp; yit a faithful promise to yéeld vnto hir wil in al
things: and thus being become of one assēt, he remaineth
the dearest friend &amp; most welcome gest that may be, both
to the Lady &amp; hir husband, and the man &amp; wife so kind (ech
to other) as if there neuer had bin such a breache betwene
them. Now, of you noble Gouernor I would fayn learn,
whether the perplexitie of the husband when he looked in
at the key hole, or of the wife when she knewe the cause
why the slippes were so scattered, or of the louer when he
knew what was his Mistres charge, was greater of the
thrée? I might haue put in also the troubled thoughts of
the sisters &amp; the mayd, when they sawe their good will reiected,
but let these thrée suffise. Gentle Hope (quod F. I.)
you haue rehearsed (&amp; that right eloquētly) a notable tale,
or rather a notable history, bycause you séeme to affirme,
that it was don in déed of late, &amp; not far hence. Wherein I
note fiue especiall pointes: that is a maruelous pacience
in the husband, no lesse repentance in the wyfe, no small
boldnesse of the mayd, but much more rashnesse in the sisters,

and last of all, a rare tractabilitie in the louer. Neuerthelesse
to returne vnto your question, I think the husbands
perplexitie greatest, bicause his losses abounded aboue
the rest, &amp; his iniuries were vncōparable. The Lady
Fraunces did not séeme to contrary him, but rather smyled
in hir sléeue at Dame Pergo, who had no lesse patience to
heare the tale recited, than the Lady Fraūces had pleasure
in telling of it, but I may not rehearse the cause why, vnlesse
I shuld tell all. By this time the sléeping houre aproched,
&amp; the Ladies prepared their departure, when as mistres
Fraūces said vnto F.I. Although percase I shal not do
it so handsomly as your mistres, yit good Trust (quod she)
if you vouchsafe it, I can be content to trim vp your bed
in ye best maner that I may, as one who would be as glad
as she to procure your quiet rest. I.F. gaue hir gret thāks
desiring hir not to trouble hirself, but to let his mā alone
with that charge: thus they departed, and how all parties
tooke rest that night I know not: but in the morning F.I.
began to cōsider wt himself that he might lye long enough
in his bed before his mistres would be apeased in hir péewish
cōceipts: wherfore he arose, &amp; being aparelled in his
night gown, tooke occasion to walk in the gallery néer adioyning
vnto his Mistres chāber: but ther might he walk
long enough ere his mistres would come to walk wt him.
When dinner time came he wēt into the great chamber
wheras the Lord of the castle saluted him being ioyful of
his recouery. F.I. giuing dewe thanks, declared that his
frendly entretainemēt togither with the great curtesie of
the gentlewomē was such, as might reuiue a mā althogh
he were half dead. I would be loth (qd the hoste) that any
gentlemā cōming to me for good wil shuld want any curtesie
of entertainmēt y• lieth in my power. Whē y• meat
was serued to the table, the gentlewomē came in all but
Dame Elynor &amp; mistres Pergo, the which F.I. marked very
well, &amp; it did somewhat abate his apetit. After dinner,

his Hope came vnto him and demaunded of him howe hée
would passe the day for his recreation? to whom he aunswered
euen as it best pleased hir. She deuised to walke
into the park, &amp; so by little &amp; litle to acquaint himself with
the ayre: he agréed, &amp; they walked togither being accōpanied
with one or two other gentlewomē. Here (least you
shuld grow in some wrong cōceit of F.I.) I must put you
out of dout, that although ther were now more cause that
he shuld mistrust his mistres than euer he had before receiued,
yit the vehemēt passions which he saw in hir whē
the first came to visit him, &amp; moreouer, the earnest words
which she pronoūced in his extremity, were such a refreshing
to his mind, as that he determined no more to trouble
himself wt like cōceitps: cōcluding further, y• if his mistres
wer not faulty, thē had he cōmittted a foule offēce in néedlesse
ielousie, &amp; that if she were faulty (especially with the
Secretary) thē no persuasion could amend hir, nor any passion
help him: and this was the cause y• enabled him after
such passing pangs to abyde the doubtfull conclusion, thus
manfully and valiātly to represse feintnesse of his mind:
nothing doubting but that he should haue wonne his Mistres
to pardon his presumption, &amp; louingly to embrace
his seruice in wonted maner, but he was far deceyued, for
she was now in another tewne, the which Mistres Fraū
                  ces
began partly to discouer vnto him as they walked togither:
for shée burdened him that his mallady procéeded
only of a disquiet mind. And if it did so my gentle Hope
(quod he) what remedy? My good Trust (quod she) none other
but to plant quiet where disquiet began to grow. I
haue determined so (qd he) but I must craue the helpe of
your assured friēship. Therof you may make accoūpt (qd
she) but wherin? F.I. walking apart with hir, begā to declare
that ther was some contētion hapened betwene his
mistres &amp; him: the Lady told him that she was not ignorant
therof. Thē he desired hir to treat so much in y• cause,

as they might eftsones come to Parlee: therof I dare assure
you (qd Mistresse Fraunces, &amp; at their retorne she led
F.I. into his Mistres chamber, whom thei found lying on
hir bed, whether galded with any grief, or weary of the
thing (which you wrot of) I know not, but there she lay:
vnto whō 
               F.I. gaue two or thrée salutatiōs before she séemed
to mark him. At last said the Lady Fraunces vnto hir,
your seruāt hearing of your sicknes, hath aduētured thus
far into the ayre to sée you. I thank him (qd Dame Elynor)
&amp; so lay still, refusing to giue him any coūtenāce. Wherat
F. I. perceyuing al the other gentlewomen fal to whispering,
thought good, boldly to plead his own case: &amp; aproching
the bed begā to enforce his vnwilling mistres vnto curtesie,
wherin he vsed such vehemēce as she could not well
by any meanes refuse to talke with him: but what their
talk was I may not take vpō me to tell you, vnlesse you
woul
                  •
                haue me fill vp a whole volume only with his matters,
and I haue dilated thē ouer largely already. Suffyseth
this to be knowne, that in the ende shee pretended to
passe ouer all old grudges, &amp; thenceforth to pleasure him
as accasion might serue: the which occasion was so long
in hapening, that in the end F.I. being now eftsones troubled
with vnquiet fantasies, &amp; forced to vse his pen again
as an Ambassadour betwene thē: one daye amongst the
rest found oportunitie to thrust a letter into hir bosome,
wherin he had earnestly requested another mooneshyne
banquet or frydayes breakfast to recomfort his dulled spirits,
wherunto the Dame yéelded this aunswer in writing,
but of whose endyting iudge you.
            G.T.
            
               
                  I can but smyle at your simplicity, who burden your
friends with an impossibility. The case so stood as I could
not though I would. Wherefore from henceforth eyther
learne to frame your request more reasonably, or else
stand content with a flat repulse.
                  
                     SHE.
                  
               
            
            
               
               F.I. liked this letter but a little: and being thereby drouen
into his accustomed vayne, he compiled in verse this
answere following, vppon these woords conteined in hir
letter, I could not though I would.
            
            G.T.
            
               
                  I could not though I would: good Lady say not so,
                  Since one good word of your good wil might soone redesse my w
                        •
                     
                  
                  Where would is free before, there could can neuer fayle:
                  For profe, you see how gallies passe where ships cā beare no sayle.
                  The weary mariner when skies are ouercast,
                  By ready will doth guyde his skill and wins the hauen at last.
                  The prety byrd that sings with pricke against hir brest,
                  Doth make a vertue of hir need to watch when others rest.
                  And true the prouerbe is, which you haue layed apart,
                  There is no hap can seeme to hard vnto a willing hart.
                  Then louely Lady myne, you say not as you should,
                  In doubtful termes to aunswer thus: I could not thogh I would.
                  Yes, yes▪ full well you know, your can is quicke and good:
                  And wilfull will is eke too swift toshed my giltlesse blood.
                  But if good will were bent as prest as power is,
                  Such will would quickly find the skill to mend that is amisse.
                  Wherfore if you desire to see my true loue spilt,
                  Commaund and I will slea my self, that yours may be the gilt.
                  But if you haue no power to say your seruaunt nay,
                  Write thus: I may not as I would, yit must I as I may.
                  
                     F.I.
                  
               
            
            THus F.I. replied vpon his Mistres aunswer, hoping
therby to recouer some fauour at hir hāds, but it wold
not be: so that now he had bene as likely (as at the first)
to haue fretted in fantasies, had not the Lady Fraunces
continually comforted him: and by little &amp; little she droue
such reason into his minde, that now he began to subdue
his humors with discretion, and to determine that if hée

might espie euident profe of his Mistresse frayeltie, hée
would then stand content with pacience perforce, &amp; giue
his Mistres the Bezo las manos. And it happened one day amongst
others, that he resorted to his Mistresse chamber
&amp; found hir (allo solito) lying vpon hir bed, &amp; the secretary
with Dame Pergo &amp; hir handmayd keping of hir cōpany.
Wherat F.I. somwhat repyning, came to hir and fell to
dalliāce, as one y• had now rather aduēture to be thought
presumptious than yéeld to be accompted bashfull, he cast
his arme ouer his Mistresse and began t
                  •
                accuse hir of
slogishnes, vsing some other bold partes, as well to prouoke
hir, as also to gréeue the other. The Lady séemed
little to delight in his dallying, but cast a glance at hir secretary
and therwith smyled, when as the Secretary &amp;
dame Pergo burst out into open laughter. The which F.I.
perceyuing, and disdayning hir ingratitude, was forced
to depart, and in that fantasie compyled this Sonet.
            G.T.
            
               
                  WIth hir in armes that had my hart in hold,
                  I stoode of late to plead for pittie so:
                  And as I did hir louely lookes behold,
                  She cast a glance vppon my ryuall foe.
                  His fleering face prouoked hir to smyle,
                  When my salte teares were drowned in disdayne:
                  He glad, I sad, he laught, (alas the while)
                  I wept for woe: I pyn'd for deadly payne.
                  And when I sawe none other boote preuayle,
                  But reasons rule must guide my skilfull minde:
                  Why then (quod I) olde prouerbes neuer fayle,
                  For yet was neuer good Cat out of kinde:
                  Nor woman true but euen as stories tell,
                  Woon with an egge, and lost againe with shall.
                  
                     F. I.
                  
               
            
            
               THis Sonet declareth that he began nowe to accompt
of hir as she deserued, for it hath a sharpe conclusion,
and it is somewhat too generall. Wel, as it is he lost it
where his Mistresse found it, and she immediatly emparted
the same vnto Dame Pergo, and Dame Pergo vnto
others: so that it quickely became common in the house.
Amongst others Mistresse Fraunces hauing recouered a
copie of it, did séeme to pardon the generallitie, and to be
well pleased with the perticularitie therof, the which she
bewrayed one day vnto F.I. in this wise. Of all the ioyes
that euer I had (my good Trust quod she) there is none
wherein I take more comforte than in your comformitie,
and although your present rage is such that you can bée
content to condemne a nomber vnknowen, for the transgression
of one too well knowne: yet I do rather reioyce
that you should iudge your pleasure ouer many, than to
be abused by any. My good Hope (quod he) it were not reason
that after such manifold proofes of your exceding curtesies,
I should vse straunge or contentious spéech with so
deare a friend, and in déede I must confesse that the opinion
which I haue conceiued of my Mistresse, hath stirred
my penne to write very hardly against all the feminine
gender, but I pray you pardon me (quod he) &amp; if it please
y
                  •
               u I wil recant 
                  ••
               tas also (percase) I was but 
                  •
               loyed with
Surquedry, and presumed to think more than may be proued.
Yea but how if it were proued quod Dame Fraunces?
If it were so (which God forbid quod he) then coulde
you not blame me to conceiue that opinion. Howsoeuer I
might blame you (quod she) I meane not to blame you,
but I demaund further, if it be as I thinke &amp; you suspect,
what will you then do? Surely (quod F. I.) I haue deter
               
                  •
               ed
to drinke vp mine owne sorowe secretely, and to bid
them both a Dieu. I like your farewell better than your
fantasie (quod she) and whensoeuer you can be content to
take so much paynes, as the Knight (which had a night

gowne garded with naked swordes) dyd take, I thinke
you may put your selfe out of doubt of all these thinges.
By these wordes and other spéech which she vttered vnto
him, F.I. smelt how the world went about, and therfore
did one day in y• grey morning aduēture to passe through
the gallery towards his Mistres chamber, hoping to haue
found the doore open, but he found the contrary, and there
attending in good deuocion, heard the parting of his Mistresse
and hir Secretary, with many kind words: wherby
it appeared that the one was very loth to departe
from the other. F.I. was enforced to beare this burden,
and after he had attended there as long as the light wold
giue him leaue, he departed also to his chamber, and aparaling
himselfe, could not be quiet vntill he had spoken
with his Mistresse, whom he burdened flatly with this
despitefull trechery: and she as fast denied it, vntill at
last being still vrged with such euident tokens as he alleged,
she gaue him this bone to g

did so (quod she) what than? Whereunto F.I. made none
answere, but departed with this farewell. My losse is mine
owne, and your gayne is none of yours, and soner can I recouer
my losse than you enioye the gaine which you gape after. And
whan he was in place sollitary, he compyled these following
for a fynall end of the matter.

                     And if I did what then?
                     Are you agreeu'd therfore?
                     The Sea hath fishe for euery man,

                     Thus did my Mistresse once,
                     Amaze my mind with doubt:

                     Eche fisherman can wishe,
                     That all the Sea at euery tyde,
                     Were his alone to fishe.
                  
                  
                     And so did I (in vaine,)
                     But since it may not be:
                     Let such fishe there as find the gaine,

                     And with such lucke and losse,
                     I will content my selfe:
                     Till tydes of turning time may tosse,

                     That euery man may see:
                     Then will I laugh and clappe my hands,

            A translation of
Ariosto allegorized.
            
               
                  WHen worthy Bradamant, had looked long in vain.
               To sée hir absent loue and Lord, Ruggier: returne
againe:
               Uppon hir lothed bed hir lustlesse limbes did cast,
               And in deceitfull dreames she thought, she saw him come
at last.
               But when with open arm
                     •
                  s, she ran him to embrace,
               With open eyes she foūd it false, &amp; thus cōplain'd hir case.
               That which me pleasd (qd she) was dreames which fancy
drewe,
               But that which me torments (alas) by sight I find it true.
               My ioye was but a dreame, and soone did fade away,
               But my tormenting c

               Why heare I not and sée, since now I haue my sences?
               That which in fained fading dreames appered by 
                     •

               Or whereto serue mine eyes, if sights they so mistake,
               As séeme to sée ech ioy in s

                  éepe, and woo whē they awake.
               The swéete &amp; slumbring sleape, did promise ioye &amp; peace,
               But these vnpleasaunt sights to rayse, such warres as
neuer cease.
               The sleape I felt was false, and séem'd to ease my grief,
               But that I sée is all to true, and yéeldes me no relief.
               If truth anoy me then, and fayned fancyes please me,
               God graunt I neuer heare nor sée, true thing for to disease
me.
               If sleaping yéeld me ioy, and waking worke me woe,
               God graunt I sleape, &amp; neuer wake, to 
                     •
                  ase my tormēt so.

                  lumbring soules, whom one dead drowsy sléepe
               Six monethes (of yore) in silence shutte, with closed eyes
did kéepe.
               Yet can I not compare, such sléepe to be like death,
               Nor yet such waking, as I wake, to be like vitall breath.
               For why my let doth fall, contrary to the rest,
               
                  I déeme it death when I awake, &amp; life while I do rest.
               Yet if such sléepe be like to death in any wise,
               O gentle death come quick at call, &amp; close my drery eyes.
               Thus sayd the worthy dame, whereby I gather this,
               No care can be cōpard to that, where true loue parted is.

               Lo Lady if you had but halfe like care for mée,
               That worthy Bradamant had then hir own Ruggier to sée:
               My readie will should be so prest to come at call,
               You should haue no such sight or dreame to trouble you
withall.
               Then when you list commaund, &amp; I wil come in hast,
               There is no hap shal hold me backe, good will shal roon so
fast.

               The crooked knot which canckred choller knit,
               And then recule with reconciled grace.
               Likewise I find it sayed in holy write,
               If thou entend to turne thy fearefull face,

               Of amitie: first yet to take away
               The grutch of grief, as thou doest me constrayne.
               By due desert whereto I now must yéeld,
               And drowne for aye in depth of Lethes lake,
               Disdaynefull moodes whom frendship cannot wéeld:
               Pleading for peace which for my parte I make

               ¶Two gentlemen did roon three courses at the rynge for
one kysse, to be taken of a fayre gentlewoman being then present,
with this condicion▪ that the winner shold haue the kisse,
and the loser be bound to write some verses vppon the gayne
or losse therof. Now it fortuned so that the wynner triumphed
saying, he much lamented that in his youth he had not seene
the warres. VVhereuppon the looser compiled these following

               Serue God thy Lord, and prayse him euermore.
               Search out the skill which learned bookes do teach,

Dames?

               And yet in all that choyce a worthy Romaine Knight,
               
                  Antonius who conquered proude Egypt by his might.
               Not all to please his eye, but most to ease his minde,
               Chose Cleopatra for his loue, &amp; left the rest behinde.
               A wondrous thing to read, in all his victory.
               He snapt but hir for his owne share, to please his fātasie.

               Well maye we iudge hir skinne the foyle, bycause hir
téeth were white.
               Percase hir louely lookes, some prayses did deserue,
               But brown I dare be bold she was▪ for so y• solle did serue.
               And could Antonius forsake the fayre in Roome?
               To loue this nutbrowne Lady best, was this an equall
doome?
               I dare wel say dames there, did beare him deadly grudge,
               His sentence had bene shortly sayed, if Faustine had bene

discusse.
               But I that read hir life, do find therin by fame,
               How cleare hir curtisie did shine, in honour of hir name.

               Which scornd the blasing sterres in Roome, to conquere
such a péece.

               Enshrinde with Snakes within his tombe, did yéeld hir
parting breath.

               From this I will skip to certaine verses written to a Gentlewomā
whom he liked very well, and yit had neuer any oportunity to
discouer his affection, being always brydled by ielouse lookes,
which attended them both, and therfore gessing by hir looks,
that she partly also liked him: he wrot in a booke of hirs as foloweth.
               
                  
                  THou with thy lookes on whom I looke full ofte,
                  And find therin great cause of déepe delight:
                  Thy face is faire, thy skin is smooth and softe,
                  Thy lippes are swéet, thine eyes are cleere and bright,
                  And euery part séemes pleasant in my sight.
                  Yit wote thou well, those lookes haue wrought my wo▪
                  
                  Bicause I loue to looke vpon them so.
               
               
                  For first those lookes allur'd myne eye to looke,
                  And streight myne eie stird vp my hart to loue:
                  And cruell loue with déepe deceitfull hooke,
                  Chokt vp my mind whom fancie cannot moue,
                  Nor hope reléeue, nor other helpe behoue:
                  But still to looke, and though I looke too much,
                  Néeds must I looke, bicause I sée none such.
               
               
                  Thus in thy lookes my loue and life haue hold,
                  And with such life my death drawes on apace:
                  And for such death no medcine can be told,
                  But looking still vpon thy louely face,
                  Wherein are painted pitie, peace, and grace.
                  Then though thy lookes should cause me for to dye,
                  Néedes must I looke, bicause I liue therby.
               
               
                  Since then thy lookes my lyfe haue so in thrall,
                  As I can like none other lookes but thine:
                  Lo here I yéeld my life, my loue, and all
                  Into thy hands, and all things else resigne,
                  But libertie to gaze vpon thyne eyen.
                  Which when I doe, then think it were thy part,
                  To looke again, and linke with me in hart.

               VVith these verses you shall iudge the quick capacity
of the Lady: for she wrot therunder this short
aunswer.
               
                  Looke as long as you list, but surely if I take you
looking, I will looke with you.
            
            
               And for a further profe of this Dames quick vnderstā
                  ding,
you shall now vnderstand, that soone after this answer
of hirs, the same Author chaūced to be at a supper in hir cō
                  pany,
where were also hir brother, hir husband, and an old
louer of hirs by whom she had bin long suspected. Nowe, although
there wanted no delicate viands to content them, yit
their chief repast was by entreglancing of lookes. For G. G.
being stoong with hot affection, could none otherwise relie
                     •
                  e
his passion but by gazing. And the Dame of a curteous
enclinatiō deigned (now and then) to requite the same with
glancing at him. Hir old louer occupied his eyes with watching:
and hir brother perceyuing all this could not absteyne
from winking, wherby he might put his Sister in remēbrāce,
least she should too much forget hirself. But most of all hir
husband beholding the first, and being euill pleased with the
second, scarse contented with the third, and misconstruing
the fourth, was constreyned to play the fifth part in froward
frowninge. This royall banquet thus passed ouer, G.G.
knowing that after supper they should passe the tyme in propounding
of Riddles, and making of purposes: contryued all
this conceipt in a Riddle as followeth. The which was no
sooner pronounced, but she could perfectly perceyue his intent,
and draue out one nayle with another, as also enseweth.
               His Riddle.
               I Cast myne eye and saw ten eies at once,
               All séemely set vpon one louely face:
               Two gaz'd, two glanc'd, two watched for the nonce,
               Two winked wyles, two fround with froward grace▪
               
               Thus euery eye was pitched in his place.
               And euery eye which wrought eche others wo,
               Said to itself, alas why lookt I so?
               And euery eye for ielouse loue did pine,
               And sigh'd and said, I would that eye were mine.
               Si fortunatus infoelix.
            
            
               
               In all this louely company was none that could and
would expound the meaning herof. At last the Dame hirself
answered on this wise. Sir, quod she, bicause your dark speech
is much too curious for this simple cōpanie, I wilbe so bold
as to quit one question with an other. And when you haue
answered myne, it maye fall out peraduenture, that I shall
somewhat the better iudge of yours.
               Hir Question.
               What thing is that which swims in blisse,
               And yit consumes in burning grief:
               Which being plast where pleasure is,
               Can yit recouer no relief.
               Which sées to sighe, and sighes to sée,
               All this is one, what may it bée?
            
            
               He held himselfe herwith contented: and afterwardes when they
were better acquainted, he chaunced once (groping in hir pocket)
to find a letter of hir old louers: and thinking it wer better
to wincke than vtterly to put out his eyes, seemed not too vnderstand
this first offence: but soone after finding a lēman (the
which he thought he saw hir old lemman put there) he deuised
therof thus, and deliuered it vnto hir in writing.
               I Groped in thy pocket pretty peat,
               And found a Lemman which I looked not:
               So found I once (which now I must repeat)
               Both leaues and letters which I liked not.
               Such hap haue I to find and séeke it not,
               But since I sée no faster meanes to bind, then
               I will (henceforth) take lemmans as I find them.
            
            
               The Dame within very short space did aunswere
it thus.
               A Lymone (but no Lemmane) Sir you found,
               For Lemmans beare their name to broad before:
               The which since it hath giuen you such a wound,
               That you séeme now offended very sore:
               
                  Content your self you shall find (there) no more.
               B
                     •
                  t take your Lemmans henceforth were you lust,
               For I will shew my letters where I trust.
            
            
               This Sonet of his shall passe (for me) without
any preface.
               WHen stedfast friendship (bound by holy othe)
               Did parte perforce my presence from thy sight.
               In dreames I might behold how thou wert loth
               With troubled thoughts to parte from thy delight.

               But when the dismold day did séeke to part
               From London walles thy longing mind for me.

               He wrote (at his friends request) in prayse of a Gentlewoman,
whose name was Phillip, as followeth.
               
                  OF all the byrds that I do know,
                  Phillip my sparow hath no peare:
                  For sit shée high or lye shée low,
                  Be shée far off, or be she neare,
                  There is no bird so fayre, so fyne,
                  Nor yit so fresh as this of myne.
               
               
                  Come in a morning merely
                  When Phillip hath ben lately fed,
                  Or in an euening soberly,
                  
                     When Phillip list to goe to bed:
                  It is a heauen to heare my phippe,
                  How she can chirpe with chery lippe.
               
               
                  She neuer wanders far abrode,
                  But is at hand when I doe call:
                  If I commaund she layes on lode,
                  With lips, with téeth, with tonge and all.
                  She chants, she chirpes, she maks such chéere,
                  That I beléeue she hath no péere.
               
               
                  And yit besides all this good sport,
                  My Phillip can both sing and daunce:
                  With newfond toyes of sundry sort,
                  My Phillip can both prycke and prance:
                  As if you say but fend cut phippe,
                  Lord how the peat will turne and skippe
               
               
                  Hir fethers are so fresh of hew,
                  And so well proyned euery day:
                  She lacks none oyle, I warrant you:
                  To trimme hir tayle both tryck and gay.
                  And though hir mouth be somewhat wyde,
                  Hir tonge is swéet and short beside.
               
               
                  And for the rest I dare compare,
                  She is both tender, swéete and soft:
                  She neuer lacketh daynty fare,
                  But is well fed and féedeth oft:
                  For if my phip haue lust to eate,
                  I warrant you Phip lacks no meat.
               
               
                  And then if that hir meat be good,
                  And such as like do loue alway:
                  She will lay lips theron by the
                        •
                     rood,
                  
                     And sée that none be cast away:
                  For when she once hath felt a fitte,
                  Phillip will crie still, yit, yit, yit.
               
               
                  And to tell trueth he were to blame,
                  Which had so fyne a Byrde as she,
                  To make him all this goodly game,
                  Without suspect or iellousie:
                  He were a churle and knew no good,
                  Would sée hir faynt for lacke of food.
               
               
                  Wherfore I sing and euer shall,
                  To praise as I haue often prou'd,
                  There is no byrd amongst them all,
                  So worthy for to be belou'd.
                  Let others prayse what byrd they will,
                  Swéete Phillip shalbe my byrd still.

               Now to begin with another man, take these verses written
to be sent with a ryng, wherein were engraued
a Patrich in a Merlines foote.
               
                  THe Partridge in the pretie Merlines foote,
                  Who feeles hir force supprest with fearefulnesse,
                  And findes that strength nor strife can do hir boote,
                  To scape the danger of hir déepe distresse:
                  These wofull wordes may séeme for to reherse
                  Which I must write in this waymenting verse.
               
               
                  What helpeth now (sayeth she) dame natures skill,
                  To die my fethers like the dustie ground?
                  Or what preuayles to lend me winges at will
                  Which in the ayre can make my bodie bound?
                  
                     Since from the earth the dogges me draue perforce,
                  And now aloft the Hauke hath caught my corse.
               
               
                  If chaunge of coollors, could not me conuey,
                  Yet mought my wings haue scapt the dogges despite:
                  And if my wings did fayle to flie awaye,
                  Yet m
                        •
                     ught my strength resist the Merlynes might.
                  But nature made the Merlyne mée to kyll,
                  And me to yéeld vnto the Merlines will.
               
               
                  My lot is like (déere Dame) beleue me well,
                  The quiet life which I full closely kept:
                  Was not content in happie state to dwell,
                  But forth in hast to gaze on thee it lept.
                  Desire the dogge did spring me vp in hast,
                  Thou wert the Hauke, whose tallents caught me fast.
               
               
                  What should I then, séeke meanes to flie away?
                  Or striue by force, to breake out of thy féete?
                  No, no, perdie, I may no strength assay,
                  To striue with thée ywis, it were not méete.
                  Thou art that Hauke, whom nature made to hent me,
                  And I the Byrd, that must therwith content me.
               
               
                  And since Dame nature hath ordayned so,
                  Hir happie heast I gladly shall embrace:
                  I yéeld my will, although it were to wo,
                  I stand content to take, my griefe for grace:
                  And seale it vp within my secrete hart,
                  Which seale receiue, as token of my smart.
               
               Spraeta tamen viuunt.
            
            
               To a Dame which challenged the aucthor bycause he
held his head alwayes downe, and looked
not vppon hir in his wonted wise.
               
                  YOu must not wonder, though you thinke it straunge,
               To sée me hold, my lowring head so lowe:
               And that mine eyes, take no delight to raunge,
               About the gleames, which on your face do growe.
               The Mouse which once hath broken out of trappe,
               Is seldome tysed▪ with the trustlesse bayte:
               But lieth aloofe, for feare of more mishappe,
               And feedeth still in doubt of déepe disceipt.
               The skorched flie, which once hath scapt the flame,
               Will hardly come, to play againe with fire:
               Wherby I learne, that greuous is the game,
               Which followes fancie dazled by desire.
               So that I wincke, or els hold downe my head,
               Bycause your blazing eyes, my bale haue bred.
               Spraeta tamen viuunt.
            
            
               A louing Lady being wounded in the spring time, and
now galded eftsones with the remembrance of
the spring, doth therfore thus bewayle.
               
                  THis tenth of March when Aries receyu'd,
                  Dame Phoebus rayes, into his horned head:
                  And I my selfe, by learned lore perceyu'd,
                  That Ver approcht, and frostie wynter fled.
                  I crost the Thames, to take the cherefull ayre,
                  In open féeldes, the weather was so fayre.
               
               
                  And as I rowed, fast by the further shore,
                  I heard a voyce, which séemed to lament:
                  Wherat I stay'd, and by a stately dore,
                  I left my Boate, and vp on land I went.
                  Till at the last by lasting payne I found,
                  The wofull wight, which made this dolefull sound.
               
               
                  
                  In pleasaunt garden (placed all alone)
                  I sawe a Dame, who sat in weary wise,
                  With scalding sighes, she vttred all hir mone,
                  The ruefull teares, downe rayned from hir eyes:
                  Hir lowring head, full lowe on hand she layed,
                  On knée hir arme: and thus this Lady sayed.
               
               
                  Alas (quod she) behold eche pleasaunt gréene,
                  Will now renew, his sommers liuery,
                  The fragrant flowers, which haue not long bene séene,
                  Will florish now, (ere long) in brauery:
                  The tender buddes, whom colde hath long kept in,
                  Will spring and sproute, as they do now begin.
               
               
                  But I (alas) within whose mourning mynde,
                  The graffes of grief, are onley giuen to growe,
                  Cannot enioy the spring which others finde,
                  But still my will, must wyther all in woe:
                  The cold of care, so nippes my ioyes at roote,
                  No sunne doth shine, that well can no them boote.
               
               
                  The lustie Ver, which whillome might exchange
                  My griefe to ioy, and then my ioyes encrease,
                  Springs now elsewhere, and showes to me but strange,
                  My winters woe, therfore can neuer cease:
                  In other coasts, his sunne full clere doth shyne,
                  And comfort lends to ey'ry mould but myne.
               
               
                  What plant can spring, that féeles no force of Ver?
                  
                  What flower can florish, where no sunne doth shyne?
                  These Bales (quod she (within my breast I beare,
                  To breake my barke, and make my pyth to pyne:
                  Néeds must I fall, I fade both roote and rynde,
                  My braunches bowe, at blast of eu'ry wynde.
               
               
                  
                  This sayed: she cast a glance and spied my face,
                  By sight wherof, Lord how the chaunged hew?
                  So that for shame, I turned backe a pace
                  And to my home, my selfe in hast I drew:
                  And as I could hir woofull wordes reherse,
                  I set them downe in this waymenting verse.
               
               
                  Now Ladies you, that know by whom I sing,
                  And féele the wynter, of such frozen wylls:
                  Of curtesie, yet cause this noble spring,
                  To send his sunne, aboue the highest hilles:
                  And so to shyne, vppon hir fading sprayes,
                  Which now in woe, do wyther thus alwayes.
               
               Spreta tamen viuunt.
            
            
               The careful louer combred with pleasure,
thus complayneth.
               NOw haue I found the way, to wéepe &amp; wayle my

                  ll,
               Now can I end my dolefull dayes, &amp; so content my
will.
               The way to wéepe inough, for such as list to wayle,
               Is this: to go abord ye ship, where pleasure beareth sayle.
               And there to marke the iests, of euery ioyfull wight,
               And with what wynde and waue they fleete, to nourish
their delight.
               For as the striken Deare, that séeth his fellowes féede,
               Amid the lustie heard (vnhurt,) &amp; féeles him selfe to bléede.
               Or as the séely byrd, that with the Bolte is brusd,
               And lieth a loofe among the leaues, of al hir péeres refusd.
               And heares them sing full shrill, yet cannot she reioyce,
               Nor frame one warbling note to passe, out of hir mournfull
voyce.
               Euen so I find by proofe, that pleasure dubleth payne,
               Unto a wretched wounded hart, which doth in woe remaine.
               
                  I passe where pleasure is, I heare some for sing ioye,
               I sée som laugh, some other daūce, in spight of dark anoy.
               But out alas my mind, amends not by their myrth,
               I déeme al pleasures to be paine, that dwel aboue y• earth.
               Such heauy humors féede, y• bloud that lends me breath,
               As mery medcines cannot serue, to kepe my corps from death.

               ¶The louer being disdaynfully abiected by a dame
of high calling, who had chosen (in his place) a playe fellowe
of baser condicion: doth therfore determine to step
a side, and before his departure giueth hir this farewell
in verse.
               
                  THy byrth, thy beautie, nor thy braue attyre,
                  (Disdainefull Dame, which doest me double wrong)
                  Thy high estate, which sets thy hart on fire,
                  Or new found choyce, which cannot serue thée long,
                  Shall make me dread, with pen for to reherse,
                  Thy skittish deedes, in this my parting verse.
               
               
                  For why thou knowest, and I my selfe can tell,
                  By many vowes, how thou to me wert 
                        •
                     ound:
                  And how for ioye, thy hart did séeme to swell,
                  And in delight▪ how thy desires were drownd.
                  When of thy will, the walles I did assayle,
                  Wherin fond fancie, fought for mine auayle.
               
               
                  And though my mind, haue small delight to vaunt,
                  Yet must I vowe, my hart to thée was true:
                  My hand was alwayes able for to daunt,
                  Thy slaundrous fooes, and kepe their tongues in mew.
                  My head (though dull) was yet of such deuise,
                  As might haue kept thy name alwayes in price.
               
               
                  
                  And for the rest my body was not braue,
                  But able yet, of substaunce to allay,
                  The raging lust, where in thy limbes did raue,
                  And quench the coales, which kindled thée to play.
                  Such one I was, and such alwayes wilbe,
                  For worthy Dames, but then I meane not thée.
               
               
                  For thou hast caught a proper paragon,
                  A théefe, a coward, and a Peacocke foole:
                  An Asse, a mylksop, and a minion,
                  Which hath none oyle, thy furious flames to coole,
                  Such one he is, a pheare for thée most fit,
                  A wandring guest, to please thy wauering wit.
               
               
                  A théefe I compt him, for he robbes vs both,
                  Thee of thy name, and me of my delight:
                  A cowerd is he noted where he goeth,
                  Since euery child, is matcht to him in might.
                  And for his pride no more, but marke his plumes,
                  The which to princke, he dayes and nights consumes.
               
               
                  The rest thy selfe, in secret sort can iudge,
                  He rydes not me, thou knowest his sadell best:
                  and thogh these tricks of thine, mought make me grudge
                  And kyndle wrath, in my reuenging brest:
                  Yet of my selfe, and not to please thy mind,
                  I stand content, my rage in rule to bind.
               
               
                  And farre from thée now must I take my flight,
                  Where tongues may tell, (and I not see) thy fall:
                  Where I may drincke these dragges of thy despight,
                  To purge my Melancholicke mind withall.
                  In secrete so, my stomacke will I sterue,
                  Wishing thée better than thou doest deserue,
               
               Spraeta tamen viuunt.
            
            
               
               An absent Dame thus complayneth.
               MUch like the séely Byrd, which close in Cage is pent,
               So sing I now, not notes of ioye, but layes of déepe lament.
               And as the hooded Hauke, which heares the Partrich spring,
               Who though she féele hir self fast tyed, yet beats hir bating wing:
               So striue I now to showe, my féeble froward will,
               Although I know my labour lost, to hop against the Hill.
               The droppes of darke disdayne, did neuer drench my hart,
               For well I know I am belou'd, if that might ease my smart.
               Ne yet the priuy coales, of glowing iellosie,
               Could euer kindle néedlesse feare, within my fantasie.
               The rigor of repulse, doth not renew my playnt,
               Nor choyce of change doth moue my mone, nor force me thus to faynt.
               Onely that pang of payne, which passeth all the rest,
               And canker like doth fret the hart, within the giltlesse brest.
               Which is if any bée, most like the panges of death,
               That present griefe now grypeth me, &amp; striues to stop my breath.
               When friendes in mind may méete, and hart in hart embrace,
               And absent yet are fayne to playne, for lacke of time and place:
               Then may I compt, their loue like séede, that soone is so wen,
               Yet lacking droppes of heauēly dew, with wéedes is ouergrowen.
               The Greyhound is agrée
                     •
                  'd, although he sée his game,
               If still in slippe he must be stayde, when he would chase the same.
               So fares it now by me▪ who know my selfe belou'd
               Of one the best, in eche respect, that euer yet was prou'd.
               But since my lucklesse lot, forbids me now to taste,
               The dulcet fruites of my delight, therfore in woes I wast.
               And Swallow like I sing, as one enforced so,
               Since others reape the gaineful crop, which I with pain did sowe.
               Yet you that marke my song, excuse my Swallowes voyce,
               And beare with hir vnpleasant tunes, which cannot well reioyce.
               Had I or lucke in loue, or lease of libertie,
               Then should you heare some swéeter notes, so cléere my throte would be.
               
                  But take it thus in grée, and marke my playnsong well,
               No hart féeles, so much hurt as that: which doth in absence dwell.

               ¶This question being propounded by a Dame vnto the writer
therof, to wit, why he should write Spreta tamen viuunt▪
he aunswereth thus.
               DEspysed things may liue, although they pyne in payne:
               And things ofte trodden vnder foote, may once yit rise again.
               The stone that lieth full lowe, may clime at last full hye:
               And stand aloft on stately tow'rs, in sight of euery eye.
               The cruell axe which fe

                  les the trée that grew full streight:
               Is worne with rust, when it renewes, and springeth vp on height.
               The rootes of rotten Réedes in swelling seas are seene:
               And when ech tyde hath toste his worst, they grow agein ful gréene.
               Thus much to please my self, vnpleasantly I sing:
               And shrich to ease my mourning minde, in spyte of enuies sting.
               I am now set full light, who earst was dearely lou'd:
               Som newfound choyce is more estéemd, thā y• which welwas prou'd
               Some Diomede is crept into Dame Cressydes hart:
               And trustie Troylus now is taught in vayne to playne his part.
               What resteth then for me? but thus to wade in wo:
               And hang in hope of better chaunce, when chaunge appointeth so.
               I sée no sight on earth, but it to Chaunge enclines:
               As little clowds oft ouercast, the brightest sunne that shines.
               No Flower is so fresh, but frost can it deface:
               No man so sure in any seate but he may léese his place.
               So that I stand content (though much against my mind)
               To take in worth this lothsome lot, which luck to me assynd,
               And trust to sée the time, when they that now are vp:
               May féele the whirle of fortunes whéele, and tast of sorrows cup.
               God knoweth I wish it not, it had ben bet for mée:
               Still to haue kept my quiet chayre in hap of high degrée.
               But since without recure, Dame Chaunge in loue must reign:
               
                  I now wish chaunge that sought no chaunge, but cōstant did remain.
               And if such chaunge do chaunce, I vow to clap my hands,
               And laugh at them which laught at me: lo thus my fancy stands.

               Now I must desire you with patience to hearken vnto the works
of another writer▪ who though he may not compare with the rest
passed, yit such things as he wrote vpon sundrie occasions,
I will rehearse, beginning with this
prayse of a Countesse.
               
                  DEsire of Fame would force my féeble skill,
                  To prayse a Countesse by hir dew desert:
                  But dread of blame holds back my forward will,
                  And quencht the coales which kindled in my hart.
                  Thus am I plongd twene dread and déepe desire,
                  To paye the dew which dutie doth require.
               
               
                  And when I call the mighty Gods in ayd
                  To further forth some fine inuention:
                  My bashefull spirits be full ill afrayd
                  To purchase payne by my presumption.
                  Such malice reignes (sometimes) in heauenly mynds▪
                  
                  To punish him that prayseth as he fynds.
               
               
                  For Pallas first whose filed flowing skill,
                  Should guyde my pen some pleasant words to write▪
                  
                  With angry mood hath fram'd a froward will,
                  To dashe deuise as oft as I endite.
                  For why? if once my Ladies gifts were knowen,
                  
                     Pallas should loose the prayses of hir own.
               
               
                  And bloudy Mars by chaunge of his delight
                  Hath made Ioues daughter now myne enemie:
                  In whose conceipt my Countesse shines so bright,
                  That Venus pynes for burning ielousie.
                  
                     She may go home to Vulcane now agayne:
                  For Mars is sworne to be my Ladies swayne.
               
               
                  Of hir bright beames Dan Phoebus stands in dread,
                  And shames to shine within our Horizon:
                  
                  Dame Cynthia holds in hir horned head,
                  For feare to loose by like comparison.
                  Lo thus shée liues, and laughes them all to skorne:
                  Countesse on earth, in heauen a Goddesse borne.
               
               
                  And I sometimes hir seruaunt, now hir friend,
                  Whom heauen and earth for hir (thus) hate &amp; blame:
                  Haue yit presumed in friendly wise to spend,
                  This ragged verse in honor of hir name.
                  A simple gift, compared by the skill:
                  Yit what may séeme so deare as such good will.
               
               Meritum petere, grauè.
            
            
               The Louer declareth his affection, togither
with the cause thereof.
               
                  WHen firs
                        •
                      I thée beheld in coulors black and whyt,
                  Thy face in forme wel framed wt fauor blooming stil:
                  My burning brest in cares did choose his chief delight,
                  With pen to painte thy prayse; contrary to my skill.
                  Whose worthinesse compar'd with this my rude deuise,
                  I blush and am abasht, this work to enterprise.
               
               
                  But when I call to mind thy sundry gifts of grace,
                  Full fraught with maners méeke in happy quiet mind:
                  My hasty hand forthwith doth scribble on apace,
                  Least willing hart might think, it ment to come behind.
                  Thus do both hand and hart these carefull méetres vse,
                  Twixt hope and trembling feare, my deutie to excuse.
               
               
                  Wherfore accept these liues, and banish dark disdayn,
                  
                     Be sure they come from one that loueth thée in chief:
                  And guerdon me thy friend in like with loue agayne,
                  So shalt thou well be sure to yéeld me such relief,
                  As onely may redresse my sorrowes and my smart:
                  For profe whereof I pledge (deare Dame) to thée my hart.
               
               Meritum petere, grauè.
            
            
               Another shorter discourse to the same
effecte.
               IF euer man yit found the Bath of perfect blisse,
               Then swim I now amid the Sea where nought but pleasure is.
               I loue and am beloued (without vaunt be it told)
               Of one more fayre than shée of Grece for whō proud Tr

               As bountifull and good as Cleopatra Quéene:
               As constant as Penelope vnto hir make was séene.
               What would you more? my pen vnable is to write
               The least desart that séemes to shine within this worthy wight.
               So that for now I cease, with hands held vp on hye,
               And craue of God that when I chaunge, I may be forst to dye.
               Meritum petere, grauè.
            
            
               The louer disdaynefully reiected contrary to former promise,
thus complayneth.
               
                  THe deadly droppes of darke disdayne,
                  Which dayly fall on my desarte.
                  The lingring suite long spent in vayne,
                  Wherof I féele no fruit but smart:
                  Enforce me now theis words to write:
                  Not all for loue, but more for spyte.
               
               
                  The which to thée I m

                     st rehearce,
                  Whom I did honor, serue and trust.
                  And though the musick of my verse
                  
                     Be plainsong tune both true and iust:
                  Content thée yit to heare my song,
                  For else thou doest me doobble wrong.
               
               
                  I must alledge, and thou canst tell
                  How faithfull I vowed to serue,
                  And how thou séemdst to like me well:
                  And how thou saydst I did deserue
                  To be thy Lord, thy Knight, thy King,
                  And how much more I list not sing.
               
               
                  And canst thou now (thou cruell one)
                  Condempne desert to déepe dispayre?
                  Is all thy promise past and gone?
                  Is faith so fled into the ayre?
                  If that be so, what rests for mée?
                  But thus in song to say to thée.
               
               
                  If Cressides name were not so knowen,
                  And written wyde on euery wall:
                  If brute of pryd were not so blowen
                  Upon Angelica withall:
                  For hault disdain thou mightst be she,
                  Or Cressyde for inconstancie.
               
               
                  And in reward of thy desart,
                  I hope at last to sée thée payed:
                  With déepe repentance for thy part,
                  Which thou hast now so lewdly playd.
                  
                     Medoro he must be thy make,
                  Since thou Orlando doest forsake.
               
               
                  Such is the fruit that groweth always
                  Uppon the root of rype disdayn:

                  When I may laugh and clappe my hands.
               
               
                  But yet for thée I must protest,
                  That sure the fault is none of thine,
                  Thou art as true as is the best,
                  That euer came of Cressedes lyne:
                  For constant yet was neuer none,
                  But in vnconstancie alone.

                     ishing,
                  Uppon the shore in woofull wise:
                  And crost the Seas out of my sight,
                  Wherby I lost my chiefe delight.
               
               
                  
                  She sayd that no such trustlesse flood,
                  Should kéepe our loues (long time) in twayne:
                  She sware no bread should do hir good,
                  Tyll she might sée my selfe againe.
                  She said and swore these words and mo,
                  But now I find them nothing so.
               
               
                  What resteth then for me to doo,
                  Thou salt sea foome come say thy mind?
                  Should I come drowne within thée too,
                  That am of true Leanders kind?
                  And headlong cast this corps of mine,
                  Into those gréedy guttes of thine?
               
               
                  No cruel, but in spite of thée,

                  My teares shall flowe in full degrée,
                  Tyll all my myrth may ebbe to mone.
                  Into such droppes I meane to melt,
                  And in such Seas my selfe to swelt,
               
               
                  Lenuoie.
                  Yet you déere Dame for whom I fade,
                  Thus steruing still in wretched state:

                  I lent a lyking to my parents choyse:
                  With hand and hart I gaue my frée consent,

                  And by his meanes the slime of false suspect,
                  Did (as I feare) my dearest friend infect.

                  The hardest hap that euer might befall,
                  The onely cause wherfore this song is song,
                  Is this alas: my loue, my Lord, my Roy,

               Eyther a needelesse or a bootelesse comparison
betwene two letters.
               
                  OF all the letters in the christs crosse rowe,
                  I feare (my swéete) thou louest B. the best,
                  And though there be good letters many mo,
                  As A.O.G.N.C.S. and the rest,
                  Yet such a liking bearest thou to B.
                  
                  That fewe or none thou thinckest like it to be.
               
               
                  And much I muse what madnesse should thée moue,
                  To set the Carl before the comely horse:
                  Must A. giue place, to B. for his behoue?
                  Are letters now so changed from their course?
                  Then must I learne (though much vnto my paine,)
                  To read (a new) my christ crosse rowe againe.
               
               
                  When I first learnd, A. was in high degrée,
                  A captaine letter, and a vowell too:
                  Such one as was alwayes a helpe to B,
                  
                  And lent him sound and taught him what to doo.
                  For take away the vowels from their place,
                  And how can then the consonants haue grace▪
                  
               
               
                  Yet if thou like a consonant so well,
                  Why should not G. seeme better farre then B?
                  
                  
                     G. spelleth God, that high in heauen doth dwell,
                  So spell we Gold and all good thinges with G.
                  
                  
                     B. serues to spell bold, baw
                        •
                     y, braynsicke, bolde,
                  Blacke, browne, and bad, yea worse than may be tolde.
               
               
                  In song, the G. cliffe kéepes the highest place,
                  Where B. sounds alwayes (or too sharpe or) flat:
                  In G. sol, re, vt: trebles haue trimme grace,
                  
                     
                     B. serues the base and is content with that.
                  Beleue me (swéete) G. giueth sound full swéete▪
                  
                  When B. cries buzze, as is for bases méete.
               
               
                  But now percase thou wilt one G. permit,
                  And with that G. thou meanest B. to ioyne:
                  Alas, alas, me thinkes it were not fit,
                  (To cloke thy faulte) such fine excuse to coyne.
                  Take dooble G. for thy most louing letter,
                  And cast of B. for it deserues no better.
               
               
                  Thus haue I played a little with thy B.
                  
                  Wherof the brand is thine, and mine the blame
                  The wight which woundes thy wandring will is he,

                        Amongst fiue hundreth Dames, presented to my view,
                     I find most cause by due desert, to like the best of you.
                     I sée your beautie such, as séemeth to suffise,
                     To bind my hart in lincks of loue, by iudgment of mine eyes.
                     And but your bountie quench, the coales of quicke desire,
                     I feare y• face of youres wil set, ten thousād harts on fire.
                     But bountie so aboundes, aboue all my desert,
                     As y• I quake &amp; shrink for fear, to shew you of my smart.
                     Yet since mine eye made choyce, my hart shal not repent,
                     But yéeld it selfe vnto your will, &amp; therwith stand cōtent.
                     God knowth I am not great, my power it is not much,
                     The greater glory shal you gain, to shew your fauor such.
                     And what I am or haue, all that I yéeld to you,
                     My hād &amp; sword shal serue alwaies, to proue my toung is true.
                     Then take me for your owne, &amp; so I wilbe still,
                     Beleue me now, I make this vow, in hope of your good will.
                     Which if I may obtein, God leaue me when I change,
                     This is the tale I ment to tell, good Lady be not strange.
                  
               
               Meritum petere, graue.
            
            
               ¶Three Sonets in sequence, written vppon this occasion.
The deuiser hereof amongst other friends had named
a gentlewoman his Berzabe: and she was content to
call him hir Dauid▪ The man presented his Lady with a
Booke of the Golden Asse, written by Lucius Apuleius,
and in the beginning of the Booke wrote this sequence.
You must conferre it with the Historie of Apuleius, for
els it will haue small grace.
               THis Apuleius was in Affricke borne,
               And tooke delight to trauayle Thessaly,
               
               As one that held his natiue soyle in skorne,
               In foraine coastes to féede his fantasie.
               And such a gaine as wandring wits find out,
               This yonker woon by will and weary toyle,
               A youth mispent, a doting age in douvt,
               
                  A body brusd with many a beastly broyle,
               A present pleasure passing on a pace,
               And paynting playne the path of penitence,
               A frollicke fauour foyld with foule disgrace,
               When hoarie heares should clayme their reuerence.
               Such is the fruite that growes on gadding 
                     •
                  rées,
               Such kynd of mell most moueth busie Bées.
               For Lucius he,
               Estéeming more one ounce of present sporte,
               Than elders do a pound of perfect witte:
               Fyrst to the bowre of Beautie doth resort,
               And there in pleasure passed many a fitte,
               His worthy race he (recklesse) doth forget,
               With small regard in great affayres he réeles,
               No counsell graue nor good aduice can set,
               His braynes in brake that whirled still on whéeles.
               For if Birhena could haue held him backe,
               From Venus Court where he now nousled was,
               His lustie limbes had neuer found the lacke
               Of manly shape: the figure of an Asse,
               Had not béene blazed on his bloud and bones,
               To wound his will with torments all attonce.
               But Fotys she▪
               
               Who sawe this Lording whitled with the cuppe,
               Of vaine delight wherof he gan to tast:
               Pourde out apace and fild the Mazor vp,
               With dronken dole, yea after that in hast.
               She greasd this gest with sauce of Sorcery,
               And fed his mind with knacks both queynt and strange:
               Lo here the treason and the trechery,
               Of gadding gyrles when they delight to raunge.
               For Lucius thinking to become a foule,
               Became a foole, yea more then that, an Asse,
               A bodding blocke, a beating stocke, an owle,
               Well wondred at in place where he did passe:
               
                  And spent his time his trauayle and his cost,
               To purchase paine and all his labour lost.
               Yet I poore I.
               Who make of thée my Fotys and my fréend,
               In like delights my youthfull yeares to spend:
               Do hope thou wilt from such sower sauce defend,
               Dauid thy King.
               Meritum petere graue.
            
            
               A Ryddle.
               A Lady once did aske of me,
               This pretie thing in priuetie:
               Good sir (quod she) fayne would I craue,
               One thing which you your selfe not haue:
               Nor neuer had yet in times past,
               Nor neuer shall while life doth last.
               And if you séeke to find it out,
               You loose your labour out of doubt:
               Yet if you loue me as you say,
               Then giue it me, for sure you may.
               Meritum petere, graue.
            
            
               To a gentlewoman who blamed him for
writing his friendly aduise in
verse vnto another louer
of hirs.

                  e which boyles within thy burning brest,
               And séekes to shape a sharpe reuenge, on them that loue thée best:
               May warne all faythfull friendes, in case of ieoperdie,
               How they shall put their harmelesse hands, betwene y• barck &amp; trée.
               And I among the rest, which wrote this weary song,
               Must needes alledge in my defence, that thou hast done me wrong.
               For if i
                     •

                  d to touch thy name,
               
                  And toucht the same without reproch, was I therfore to blame?
               And if (of great good will) I gaue my best aduise,
               Then thus to blame wt out cause why, me thinkes thou art not wise.
               Amongst old written tales, this one I beare in mind,
               A simple soule much like my selfe, did once a serpent find.
               Which (almost dead for colde) lay moyling in the myre
               When he for pittie toke it vp and brought it to the fyre.
               No soner was the Snake, cured of hir grief,
               But streight she sought to hurt the man, that lent hir such relief.
               Such Serp

                  nt séemest thou, such simple soule am I,
               That for the weight of my good will, am blam'd without cause why.
               But as it best beséemes, the harmelesse gentle hart,
               Rather to take an open wrong, than for to playne his part:
               I must and will endure, thy spite without repent,
               The blame is myne, the tryumph thine, and I am well content.

               An vncurteous farewell to an vnconstant
Dame.
               IF what you want, you (wanton) had at will,
               A stedfast mind, a faythfull louing hart:
               If what you speake you would perfourme it still,
               If from your word your déede could not reuert.
               If youthfull yeeres your thoughts did not so rule,
               As elder dayes may skorne your friendship frayle:
               Your doubled fanfie would not thus recule,

               Whose wauering wayes (since now I do them proue)
               By true report this witnesse with me beare:
               That if your friendship be not too deare bought,
               The price is great, that nothing giues for nought.
               Meritum petere, graue.
            
            
               
               A louer often warned, and once againe drouen into fantasticall
flames by the chase of company, doth thus
bewayle his misfor tunes.
               
                  I That my race of youthfull yeares had roon
                  Alwayes vntyed, and not (but once) in thrall,
                  Euen I which had the fieldes of fréedome woon,
                  And liu'd at large, and playde with pleasures ball:
                  Lo now at last am tane againe and taught,
                  To tast such sorowes, as I neuer sought.
               
               
                  I loue, I loue, alas I loue in déede,
                  I crie alas, but no man pitties me:
                  My woundes are wyde, yet séeme they not to bléede,
                  And hidden woundes are hardly heald we sée.
                  Such is my lucke to catch a sodeyne clappe,
                  Of great mischaunce in séeking my good happe.
               
               
                  My mourning mind which dwelt and dyed in dole,
                  Sought company for sollace of the same:
                  My cares were cold, and craued comforts coale,
                  To warme my wile with flakes of fréendly flame.
                  I sought and found, I crau'd and did obteyne,
                  I woo
                        •
                      my wish, and yet I got no gaine.
               
               
                  For whiles I sought the cheare of company,
                  Fayre fellowship did woonted woes reuiue:
                  And crauing medcine for my malladie,
                  Dame pleasures plaster prou'd a corosiue.
                  So that by myrth, I reapt no fruite but mone,
                  Much worse I feare than when I was alone.
               
               
                  The cause is this, my lot did light too late,
                  The Byrdes were flowen, before I found the nest:
                  
                     The stéede was stollen, before I shut the gate,
                  The cates consumd, before I smelt the feast.
                  And I fond foole with emptie hand must call,
                  The gorged Hauke, which likes no lure at all.
               
               
                  Thus still I toyle, to till the barreyne land,
                  And grope for grapes among the bramble briers:
                  I striue to sayle and yet I sticke on sand,
                  I déeme to liue, yet drowne in déepe desires.
                  These lots of loue, are fitte for wanton will,
                  Which findes too much, yet must be séeking still.
               
               Meritum petere, graue.
            
            
               The louer encouraged by former examples, determineth
to make vertue of necessitie.
               
                  WHen I record within my musing mind,
                  The noble names of wightes bewicht in loue:
                  Such sollace for my selfe therin I find,
                  As nothing may my fixed fansie moue:
                  But paciently I will endure my wo,
                  Because I sée the heauens ordayne it so.
               
               
                  For whiles I read and ryfle their estates,
                  In eu'ry tale I note mine owne anoye:
                  But whiles I marke the meanings of their mates,
                  I séeme to swimme in such a sugred ioye,
                  As did (percase) entise them to delight,
                  Though turnd at last, to drugges of sower despite.

                  I nam (as he) the wisest wight of all,
                  But well I wot, a woman holdes me thrall.
               
               
                  So am I like the proude Assirian Knight,
                  Which blasphem'd God, and all the world defied:
                  Yet could a woman ouercome his might,
                  And daunt his force in all his pompe and pride.
                  I Holyferne, am dronken brought to bead,

                  Whose force is like to that which Sampson had?

                  Yet Dalila, and Deyanyraes loue,
                  Did teach them both, such pangs as I must proue.

                     L'Escü d'amour, the shield of perfect loue,
                  The shield of loue, the force of stedfast faith,
                  The force of fayth which neuer will remoue,
                  But standeth fast, to byde the broonts of death:
                  That trustie targe, hath long borne of the blowes,
                  And broke the thrusts, which absence at me throwes.
               
               
                  In dolefull dayes I lead an absent life,
                  And wound my will with many a weary thought:
                  I plead for peace, yet sterue in stormes of strife,
                  I find debate, where quiet rest was sought.
                  These panges with mo, vnto my paine I proue,
                  Yet beare I all vppon my shield of loue.
               
               
                  In colder cares are my conceipts consumd,
                  Than Dido felt when false Enaeas fled:
                  In farre more heat, than trusty Troylus fumd,
                  When craftie Cressyde dwelt with Diomed.
                  
                  My hope such frost, my hot desire such flame,
                  That I both fryse, and smoulder in the same.
               
               
                  So that I liue, and dye in one degrée,
                  Healed by hope, and hurt againe with dread:
                  Fast bound by fayth when fansie would be frée,
                  Untyed by trust, though thoughts enthrall my head.
                  Reuiu'd by ioyes, when hope doth most abound,
                  And yet with grief, in depth of dollors drownd.
               
               
                  
                  In these assaultes I féele my féebled force
                  Begins to faint, thus weried still in woes:
                  And scarcely can my thus consumed corse,
                  Hold vp this Buckler to beare of these blowes.
                  So that I craue, or presence for relief,
                  Or some supplie, to ease mine absent grief.
               
               
                  Lenuoie.
                  To you (deare Dame) this dolefull plaint I make,
                  Whose onely sight may sone redresse my smart:
                  Then shew your selfe, and for your seruauntes sake,
                  Make hast post hast, to helpe a faythfull harte.
                  Mine owne poore shield hath me defended long,
                  Now lend me yours, for elles you do me wrong.
               
               Meritum petere, graue.
            
            
               I will now deliuer vnto you so many more of Master Gascoignes
Poems as haue come to my hands, who hath neuer
beene dayntie of h

                  s doings, and therfore I conceale
not his name: but his word or posie he hath often changed
and therfore I will deliuer his verses with such sundrie posies
as I receiued thē. And first I will begin with Gascoigns
Anatomie.
               TO make a louer knowne, by playne Anatomie,
               You louers all that li
                     ••
                   beware, lo here behold you me.
               Who though mine onely lookes, your pittie wel might moue,
               Yet euery part shall play his part to paint the pangs of loue.
               If first my féeble head, haue so much matter left,
               If fansies raging force haue not his féeble skill bereft.
               These locks that hang vnkempt, these hollowe dazled eyes,
               These chattring téeth, this trēbling tongue, wel tewed with carefull cries,
               These wan &amp; wrinckled chéeks, wel washt wt waues of wo,
               May stand for patterne of a ghost, where so this carkasse go.
               These shoulders they susteyne, the yoke of heauie care,
               And on my brused broken backe, the burden must I beare.
               
                  These armes are braunfalne now, with beating on my brest,
               This right hand weary is to write, this left hand craueth rest:
               These sides enclose the forge, where sorow playes the smith,
               And hot desire, hath kindled fire, to worke his mettall with.
               The anuile is my hearte, my thoughtes they strike the stroke,
               My lights &amp; lungs like bellows blowe, &amp; sighs ascēd for smoke.
               My secrete parts are so with secrete sorowe soken,
               As for the secrete shame therof, deserues not to be spoken.
               My thighes, my knées, my legs, and last of all my féete,
               To serue a louers turne, are so vnable and vnméete,
               That scarce they can beare vp this restlesse body well,
               Unlesse it be to sée the boure, wherin my loue doth dwell,
               And there by sight eftsoones to féede my gazing eye,
               And so content my hungrie corps tyll dolours doe me die:
               Yet for a iust rewarde of loue so dearely bought,
               I pray you say, lo this was he, whō loue had worne to nought.
               Euer or neuer.

               And therwithall so well hir graces all agrée,

               Although some lauishe lippes, which like some other best,

               Thereto I thus replie, God wotte they little knowe
               The hidden cause of that mishap, nor how the harm did grow.
               For when dame nature first had framde hir heauenly face,

                  Nor yet so flame, as might consume my smarte.

                  These things they tell, which séeke redresse of paine,

               To whome I dare auow, that I haue serued as well,
               And played my part as gallantly, as he that beares the bell:
               She cast me off long since, and holds me in disdaine,
               I cannot pranke to please hir now, my vaunting is but vaine.

               The gréenesse of my yeares, doth wither now so sore,
               That lusty loue leapes quite away, and liketh me no more.

               Be iudge then gentle death, and take my cause in hand,

               Dame Priams yōger son, found out ye fairest dame,
               That euer troade on Troyane mold, what followed of the same?
               I list not brute hir bale, let others spred it foorth,
               But for his part to spek my mind his choice was litle worth
               My meaning is but this, who marks the outward shewe
               And neuer gropes for grafts of grace which in ye mind shuld grow:
               May chance vpon such choise as trusty Troylus had
               And dwel in dole as Paris did, when he wold fayne be glad.
               How happie then am I? whose happe hath bin to finde
               A mistresse first that doth excell in vertues of the minde,
               And yet therewith hath ioind, such fauoure and such grace,
               As Pādars niece if she wer here wold quickly giue hir place,
               Within whose worthy brest, dame Bounty séekes to dwel.
               And saith to beawty, yéeld to me, since I do thée excell.
               Betwene whose heuēly eies, doth right remorce appeare,
               And pittie placed by the same, doth much amend hir chéere.
               Who in my dangers déepe, did deigne to do me good,
               
                  Who did reléeue my heuie heart, and sought to saue my bloud,
               Who first encreast my friends, and ouerthrew my foes,
               Who loued all them that wisht me well, an liked none but those.
               O Ladies giue me leaue, I praise hir not so farre,
               Since she doth passe you all, as much, as Tytan staines a starre.
               You hold such seruants deare, as able are to serue,
               She held me deare, whē I poore soule, could no good thing deserue.
               You set by them that swim in all prosperitie,
               She set by me when as I was in great calamitie.
               You best estéeme the braue, and let the purest passe,
               She best estéemd my poore good will, all naked as it was.
               But whether am I went? what humor guides my braine?
               I séeke to wey the woolsacke down, with one poore pepper graine.
               I séeme to penne hir praise, that doth surpasse myskill,
               I striue to row against the tide, I hoppe against the hill.

               Their beauties blaze are baytes which séeme of pleasant taste,

               Their smyling is deceipt, their faire wordes traynes of treason,
               Their witte alwayes so full of wyles, it skorneth rules of reason.
               Percase some present here, haue hearde my selfe of yore,

               Those trifling bookes, frō whose leud lore my tippet here I turne,
               And hencefoorth will I write, howe madde is that mans mynde,
               Which is entyst by any trayne to trust in womankynde.

               IF yelding feare, or cancred villanie,
               In Caesars haughtie heart had tane the charge,
               The walles of Rome had not bene rearde so hye,
               Nor yet the mightie empire lefte so large.
               If Menelaus could haue rulde his will
               With fowle reproch to loose his faire delight,
               Then had the stately towres of Troy stood still,
               And Greekes with grudge had dronke their owne despight.

               In Lauine lande had not possessed place,
               But true it is, where lottes doe light by chaunce,
               There Fortune helpes the boldest to aduaunce.

               For such as list in brauery so to bragge.

               But he that list with lauish hand to linke,
               (In like expence) a pennie with a pound,
               May chance at last to sitte aside and shrinke

               And change of crownes more quicke at call than he,
               Which let their lease and tooke their rent before.
               For he that rappes a royall on his cappe,
               Before he put one pennie in his pursse,
               Had néede turne quicke and broch a better tappe,
               Or else his drinke may chance go downe the wursse.

                  As myght beguyle a grauer guest than I.
                  The stately pompe of Princes and their péeres,
                  Did séeme to swimme in flouddes of beaten golde,

                     Was not vnlyke a heauen for to beholde,

                  So faire of hue, so freshe of their attire,
                  As might excell dame Cinthia for Fame,
                  Or conquer Cupide with his owne desire.
                  These and suche lyke were baytes that blazed still

                  Till all in haste I leapte aloofe from lande,
                  And hoyste vp soyle to catche a Courtly grace:
                  Eche lingring daye did séeme a worlde of woe,

                  My wandring eye in haste, (yea poste post haste)
                  Behelde the blazing badge of brauerie,
                  For wante wherof, I thought my selfe disgraste:

                  And comely cost beganne to playe his parte,

                     Thus all was good that myghte be got in haste,
                  To prinke me vp, and make mée higher plaste.
               
               
                  4 To prinke mée vp and make mée higher plaste,
                  All came to late that taryed any tyme,
                  Pilles of prouision pleased not my taste,

                  But when this hotte accompte was coldely scande,

                  And sawe expences grating on the grounde
                  Lyke lumpes of leade to presse my pursse full ofte,
                  When lyghte rewarde and recompence were founde,
                  Fléeting lyke feathers in the wynde alofte:

                  And as swifte baytes doe fléetest fyshe entice,
                  So haste makes waste, and therefore nowe I say,
                  
                     No haste but good, where wysedome makes the waye.

               Thus is the stage stakt out, where all these partes be plaide,
               And I the prologue should pronounce, but that I am afraide.
               First Cayphas playes the priest, and Herode sits as king,

               Pride in hir pocket playes bo péepe, and bawdrie in hir braine.
               Hir handmaides be deceipte, daunger, and dalliance,
               Riot and Reuell follow hir, they be of hir alliance:

               He says these iestes can get no grotes, &amp; al this geare goth wrong:

               Cost lost, the counter Tenor chanteth on apace,
               Thus all in discords stands the cliffe, and beggrie sings the base.
               The players loose their paines, where so few pens are sturring,
               Their garmēts weare for lacke of gains, &amp; fret for lacke of furring
               When all is done and past, was no part plaide but one,
               For euery player plaide the foole, till all be spent and gone.

               MY recklesse race is runne, gréene youth and pride be past,
               My riper mellowed yeares beginne to follow on as fast.
               My glancing lookes are gone, which wonted were to prie
               In euery gorgeous garish glasse that glistred in mine eie.
               My sight is now so dimme, it can behold none such,
               No mirroure but the merrie meane, can please my fansie much

               And in that noble glasse, I take delight to view,
               The fashions of the wonted worlde, compared by the new.
               
                  For marke who list to looke, each man is for him selfe,
               And beates his braine to hord &amp; heape this trash &amp; worldly pelfe.

               Giue Gaue is a good man, what neede we lash it out,

               And aske how chanceth this? or what meanes all this méede?
               Forsooth the common answer is, because the Lord hath neede.

               A text to trie the truth, and for this time full fitte,
               For where should we our lessons learne, but out of holy writte?
               First marke our only God, which ruleth all the rost,
               He sets a side all pompe and pride, wherein fond wordlings boast,
               He is not fedde with calues, as in the dayes of old,
               He cares but litle for their copes, that glister all of gold.
               His traine is not so great, as filthy Sathans band,
               A smaller heard may serue to féede, at our great masters hande.
               He likes no numbred prayers, to purchase popish méede,
               He askes no more but penitence, thereof Cur Lorde hath neede:
               
               Next marke the heathens Gods, and by them shall we sée,
               They be not now so good fellowes, as they were wont to be.
               
                  Ioue, Mars, and Mercurie, Dame Venus and the rest,
               They banquet not as they were wont, they know it were not best:
               They shrinke into the cloudes, and there they serue out néede,
               As planets and signes moueable, by destenies decréede.
               So kings and princes both, haue lefte their halles at large,
               Their priuie chambers cost enough, they cut off euery charge:
               And when an office falles, as chance sometimes may be,
               First kéepe it close a yere or twayne, then geld it by the sée.
               And giue it out at last, but yet with this prouiso,
               (A bridle for a brainsicke Iade) durante bene placito.
               
               Some think these ladders low, to climbe alofte with spéede:
               Well let them créepe at leisure thē, for sure the Lord hath neede.

               Percase their roomes be skant, not like their stately boure,
               A field bed in a corner coucht, a pallad on the floure.
               But what for that? no force, they make thereof no boast,
               They féede themselues with delycates, and at the princes cost.
               And as for all their men, their pages and their swaynes,
               They cloke thē vp with chynes of béefe, to multiply their gaines.
               Themselues lie néere to looke, when any leafe doth fall,
               Such croomes were wont to feede poore groomes, but now y• Lords licke al.
               And why? oh sir, because, both dukes &amp; lords haue néede,
               I mock not I, my text is true, beléeue it as your créede.
               Our prelates and our priests, can tell this text with me,
               They can hold fast their fattest fermes, and let no lease go frée.
               They haue both wife and childe, which may not be forgot,
               The scriptures say the Lord hath neeed, &amp; therfore blame thē not.

               Their halles were all to large, their tables were to long,
               The clouted shoes came in so fast, they kepte to great a throng,
               And at the porters lodge, where lubbers wont to féede,

               Gascoignes good nyghte.
               WHen thou hast spent the lingring day in pleasure and delight,
               Or after toyle and wearie way, dost séeke to rest at night:
               Unto thy paynes or pleasures past, adde this one labour yet,
               Ere sléepe close vp thyne eye too faste, do not thy God forget,
               But searche within thy secret thoughts what déeds did thée befal:
               And if thou fynde amisse in ought, to God for mercie call:
               Yea though thou find nothing amisse, which thou canst cal to mind
               Yet euermore remember this, there is the more behynde:
               And think howe well soeuer it be, that thou hast spent the day,
               It came of God, and not of thée, so to directe thy waye.
               Thus if thou trie thy dayly déedes, and pleasure in this payne,
               Thy lyfe shal clense thy corne from wéeds, &amp; thine shal be y• gaine:
               But if thy sinfull sluggishe eye, will venture for to winke,
               Before thy wading wyll maye trye, how far thy soule may sink,
               Beware and wake, for else thy bed, which soft &amp; smoothe is made,

               I see that sléepe is lent mée here, to ease my wearie bones,
               As death at laste shall eke appeare, to ease my greeuous grones.

               The streking arms, the yauning breath, which I to bedward vse,
               Are patternes of the pangs of death, when lyfe will me refuse:

               Which gréedily shal gnaw my flesh, and leaue the bones ful bare:
               The waking Cocke that early crowes to weare the nyght away,
               Puts in my mynde the trumpe that blowes before the latter day▪
               
               And as I ryse vp lustily, when sluggishe sléepe is paste,
               So hope I to ryse ioyfully, to Iudgement at the laste.
               Thus will I wake, thus will I sléepe, thus will I hope to ryse,
               Thus will I neyther wayle nor wéepe, but sing in godly wyse.
               My bones shall in this bed remayne, my soule in God shall trust,
               By whom I hope to ryse agayne from death and earthly dust.

She had a booke vvherein she had collected sundry

               TO binde a bushe of thornes amongst swete smelling floures,
               May make the posie séeme the worse, and yet the fault is ours▪
               
               
                  For throw away the thorne, and marke what will ensew,
               The posie then will shew it selfe, swéete, faire, and freshe of hew.
               A puttocke set on pearche, fast by a falcons side,
               Will quickly shew it selfe a kight, as time hath often tride.
               And in my musing minde, I feare to finde like fall,
               As iust reward to recompence my rash attempts withall.
               Thou bidst, and I must bowe, thou wilt that I shall write,
               Thou canst command my wery muse some verses to endite.
               And yet perdie, thy booke is fraughte with learned verse,
               Such skill as in my musing minde I can none like reherse.
               What followes then for me? but if I must néedes write,
               To set downe by the falcons side, my selfe a sillie kight.
               And yet the sillie kight, well weyed in each degrée,
               May serue sometimes (as in his kinde) for mans commoditie.
               The kight can wéede the worme, from corne and costly

               As mē can clēse the worthlesse wéedes, frō fruteful fallowed tilth.
               And onely set aside the hennes poore progenie,
               I cannot see who can accuse the kight for fellonie.
               The falcon, she must féede on partritch, and on quaile,

               Nor yet presume to houer by mount Hellycon on hye)
               I frendly yet presume, vppon my frends request,

               Thy Parents follow next, for honor and for awe,
               Thy frends vse alwayes faithfully, for so commands the lawe.
               Thy séemely selfe at last, thou shalte likewise regard,
               
                  And of thy selfe this lesson learne, and take it as reward:
               That loke how farre desertes, may seme in thée to shine,
               So farre thou maist set out thy selfe, without empeach or crime.

               It can scarce be that vertue dwell, in any earthly wight.
               But if in such selfe loue, thou séeme to wade so farre,
               As fall to fowle presumption, and iudge thy selfe a starre,
               Beware betimes and thinke, in our Etymologie,
               
               Such faults are plainly called pride, and in french Surquydrye.
               
               Lo thus can I pore kight, aduenture for to teach,
               The falcon flie, and yet forewarne, she row not past hir reach.
               Thus can I wéede the worme, which séeketh to deuoure
               The séeds of vertue, which might grow within thee euery houre.
               Thus can I kill the mowle, which else would ouerthrow
               The good foundacion of thy fame, with euery litle blowe.
               And thus can I conuey, out of thy comely brest,
               The sluttish heapes of p

                  euish pride, which might defile the rest.
               Perchance some falcons flie, which will not greatly grutch,
               To learne thée first to loue thy selfe, and then to loue to mutch.
               But I am none of those, I list not so to range,
               I haue mās meate enough at home, what néed I thē séeke change.
               I am no peacocke I: my fethers be not gay,
               And though they were, I sée my féete suche fonde affectes to stay.
               I list not set to sale a thing so litle, worth,
               I rather could kepe close my crease, than séeke to set it forth.
               Wherefore if in this verse, which thou commands to flowe,
               Thou chaunce to fall on construing, whereby some doubtes may grow,
               Yet grant this only boone, peruse it twise or thrise,
               Disgest it well eare thou condemne the depth of my deuise.
               And vse it like the nut, first cracke the outward shell,
               Then trie the kirnell by the tast, and it may please thée well.
               Do not as barbers do, which wash beards curiously,
               Then cut them off, then cast them out, in open stréetes to lie.
               Remember therewithall, my money is tied in chaines,

                  And though this verse scape out, take thou therat no marke,
               It is but like a hedlesse flie, that tumbleth in the darke.
               It was thine owne request, remember so it was,
               Wherefore if thou dislike the same, then licence it to passe
               Into my brest againe, from whence it flew in hast,
               Full like a kight which not deserues by falcons to be plast:
               And like a stubbed thorne, which may not séeme to serue,
               To stād with such swete smelling floures, like praises to deserue.
               Yet take this harmelesse thorne, to picke thy teeth withall,
               A tooth picke serues some vse perdie, although it be but small.

               There are thrée Ps almoste in euery place,
               From whiche I counsell thée alwayes to flée,
               And take good héede of them in any case,
               The first is poyson, perillous in déede
               To suche as trauayle with a heauie pursse:
               And thou my Batte beware, for thou haste néede,
               Thy pursse is lynde wyth paper, whyche is wursse:
               Thy billes of credite will not they thinkst thou,
               Be bayte to sette Italyan handes on woorke?
               Yes by my faye, and neuer worsse than nowe,
               When euery knaue hath leysure for to lurke,
               And knoweth thou commest for the shelles of Christe:
               Beware therefore, where euer that thou go,
               It maye fall out that thou shalte be entiste
               To suppe sometimes with a Magnifico,
               
               And haue a fico foysted in thy dishe,
               Bycause thou shouldest disgeste thy meate the better:
               Beware therefore, and rather féede on fishe,
               Than learne to spell fyne fleshe with suche a Letter.
               Some may presente thée with a pounde or twayne
               Of Spanishe soape to washe thy lynnen white:
               Beware therefore, and thynke it were small gayne,
               To saue thy shirte, and caste thy skinne off quite:
               Some cunning man maye teache thée for to ryde,
               And stuffe thy saddle all with Spanishe wooll,
               Or in thy stirrops haue a toye so tyde,
               As bothe thy legges may swell thy buskins full:
               Beware therefore, and beare a noble porte,
               Drynke not for thyrste before an other taste:
               Lette none outlandishe Taylour take disporte
               
                  To stuffe thy doublet full of suche Bumbaste,
               As it maye caste thée in vnkindely sweate,
               And cause thy haire ꝑ companie to glyde,
               Straungers are fyne in many a propre feate:
               Beware therefore, the seconde P. is Pryde,
               More perillous than was the fyrste by farre,
               For that infectes but onely bloud and bones,
               This poysons all, and myndes of men dothe marre,
               It fyndeth nookes to créepe in for the nones:
               Fyrste from the mynde it makes the hearte to swell,
               From thence the fleshe is pampred euery parte,
               The skinne is taughte in Dyers shoppes to dwell,
               The haire is curlde or frisled vp by arte:

               That moste men call them Deuils incarnate,
               
               So singular in theyr conceiptes they stande:
               Nowe sir, if I shall sée your maistershippe
               Come home disguysde and cladde in queynt araye,
               As wyth a pyketoothe byting on youre lippe,
               Your braue Mustachyos turnde the Turky waye,
               A Coptanckt hatte made on a Flemmishe blocke,
               A nyghtgowne cloake downe trayling to your 
                     •
                  oes,
               A slender sloppe close couched to youre docke,
               A curtold slipper, and a shorte sylke hose:
               Bearyng youre Rapier poynte aboue the hilte,
               And looking bigge lyke Marquise of al Beefe,
               
               Then shall I coumpte your toyle and trauayle spilte,
               Bycause my seconde P, with you is chéefe.
               But forwardes nowe, although I stande a whyle,
               My hindmoste P, is worsse than bothe these two,
               For it bothe soule and bodie dothe defyle,
               With fouler faultes than bothe those other doo.
               Shorte tale to make, this is a double P,
               
               (God shielde my Batte, shoulde beare it in his breast)
               
                  And with a dashe it spelleth Papistrie,
               
               A perlous P, and woorsse than bothe the reste:
               Nowe though I finde no cause for to suspecte
               My Batte in this, bycause he hath ben tryde,
               Yet since the polshorne Prelates can infecte
               Kings, Emperours, Princes, and the worlde so wyde.
               And since theyr brazen heauen beares suche a glosse,
               As moste that trauayle come home ꝑ Papist,
               
               Or else muche woorsse (whyche is a heauie lesse)
               Drowned in errours lyke an Atheist:
               
               Therefore I thoughte it méete to warne my frende
               Of this foule P, and so an ende of Ps.
               
               Nowe for thy diet marke my tale to ende,
               And thanke me then, for that is all my fées.
               Sée thou excéede not in thrée double Vs,
               
               The fyrste is Wyne, whiche maye enflame thy bloud,
               The seconde, Women, suche as haunte the stewes,
               The thirde is Wilfulnesse, whiche dooth no good.
               These thrée eschue, or temper them alwayes:
               So shall my Batte prolong his youthfull yéeres,
               And sée long George agayne, with happie dayes,
               Who if he bée as faythfull to his feeres,
               As hée was wonte, wyll dayly praye for Batte,
               
               And for Pencoyde: and if it fall oute so,
               That Iames a Parrye doo but make good that,
               Whiche he hath sayde: and if he bée (no, no)
               The beste companyon that long George can fynde,
               Then at the Spavve I promyse for to bée
               In Auguste nexte, if God turne not my mynde,
               Where as I woulde bée glad thy selfe to sée:
               Tyll then farewell, and thus I ende my song,
               Take it in grée, for else thou doest mée wrong.

                  FYe Captaines fie, your tongs are tied to close,
                  Your souldiers eke by silence purchase shame:
                  Can no man penne in metre nor in prose,
                  The life, the death, the valiante acts, the fame,
                  The birth, behauioure, nor the noble name,
                  Of such a féere as you in sight haue lost?
                  Alas such paines would quickly quite the cost.
               
               
                  
                     Bourcher is dead, whome each of you did knowe,
                  Yet no man writes one word to painte his praise,
                  His sprite on high, his carkasse here belowe,
                  Do both condemne your doting idle dayes:
                  Yet ceasse they not to sound his worthy wayes,
                  Who liued to die, and died againe to liue,
                  With death deere bought, he did his death forgiue.

                  Alas the while, his life so soone should end?
               
               
                  To serue his Prince his life was euer prest,
                  To serue his God, his death he thought but dew,
                  In all attempts as frowarde as the best,
                  And all to forwards whiche we all may rew,
                  His life so shewed, his death eke tried it true:
                  For where Gods foes in thickest prease did stande,
                  
                     Bourcher caught bane with bloudy sword in hande.
               
               
                  
                  And marke the courage of a noble harte,
                  When he in bedde lay wounded wondrous sore,
                  And heard allarme, he soone forgat his smarte,
                  And callde for armes to shewe his seruice more:

                  Still praysing God, and so gaue vp the ghost.
               
               
                  Now muze not reader though we stones can speake,
                  Or write sometimes the déedes of worthy ones,
                  I could not hold although my harte should breake,
                  Bycause here by me buried are his bones,
                  But I must tell this tale thus for the nones.
                  When men crie mumme and keepe such silence long,
                  Then stones must speake, els dead men shall haue wrong.

                  Zechynes of glistering golde, two thousand was his price,
               The which to pay his lands must leape, for else he were vnwise.
               Beléeue me now my lords although the losse be mine,
               Yet I confesse them better solde, than like a slaue to pine.
               "For lands may come againe, but libertie once lost,

               My selfe now know the case, who like my fathers lot,
               Was like of late for to haue lost my libertie god wot.
               My father (as I say) enforste to leaue his lande
               In mortgage to my mothers kinne, for ready coine in hande,

               And first his raunsome paide, with that which did remaine,
               He rigged vp a proper Barke, was called Leffort Brittayne.
               
               And like a venturer (besides him séemely selfe)
               Determined for to venture me and all his worldly pelfe.
               Perhaps some hope of gaine perswaded so his minde,
               For sure his hauty harte was bent, some great exployte to finde.
               How so it were, the winds now hoysted vp our sayles,
               We furrowing in the foming floudes, to take our best auailes.
               Now hearken to my words, and marke you well the same,
               
                  For now I will declare the cause wherefore I hither came.
               My father (as I say) had set vp all his rest,
               And tost on seas both day and night, disdayning idlenesse,
               We lefte our forelands end, we past the coast of France,
               
               We reacht the cape of Finestre our course for to aduance.
               We past Marrocchus streights, and at the last descried,
               The fertile coasts of Cyprus soile, which I my selfe first spied.
               My selfe (a forewarde boy) on highest top was plast,
               And there I sawe the Ciprian shoare, whereto we sailde in hast.
               Which when I had declared vnto the masters mate,
               He lepte for ioy and thanked God, of that our happie state.
               "But what remaines to man, that can continue long?
               "What sunne can shine so cleare and bright but clouds may rise amōg?
               Which sentence soone was proued, by our vnhappie hap,
               We thought our selues full nere our frendes, &amp; light in

               The Turke y• tirāt he, with siege had girte the walles,
               Of famouse Famagosta then and sought to make them thrals.
               And as he lay by lande, in strong and stately trenche,
               So was his power prest by sea, his christian foes to drenche.
               Uppon the waltring waues, his foistes and gallies fléete,
               More forrest like than orderly, for such a man most méete.
               This heauie sight once seene, we turnd our course a pace,
               And set vp all our sailes in haste, to giue such furie place.
               But out alas, our wills, and winds were contrarie,
               For raging blasts did blowe vs still vppon our enimie.
               My father séeing then, whereto he néedes must go,
               And that the mightie hand of God, had it apointed so,
               Most like a worthy knight (though certeine of his death)
               Gan cleane forget al wailing words as lauish of his breath.
               And to his christian crew, this (too shorte) tale he told,
               To comfort them which séemd to faint, &amp; make the coward bolde,
               "Fellowes in armes, quoth he, although I beare the charge,

               Wherat they doubt not long, for though our power was slender,
               We sent them signes by Canon shot, that we ment not to rēder.
               Then might we see them chafe, them might we heare them rage,
               And all at once they bent their force, about our sillie cage.
               Our ordinance bestowed, our men them selues defend,
               On euerie side so thicke beset, they might not long contend.
               But as their captaine wild, each man his force did strayne,
               To send a Turke (some two or thrée) vnto the hellishe trayne.
               And he him selfe which sawe, he might no more abide,
               Did thrust amid the thickest throng, and so with honoure died.
               With him there died likewise, his best approued men.
               The rest did yeld as men amazd, they had no courage then.
               Amongst the which my selfe, was tane by Turks alas,
               And with the Turks a turkish life, in Turkie must passe.
               I was not done to death for so I often craude,
               But like a slaue before the Gates, of Famagosta saude.
               That péece once put to sacke, I thither was conueyed.
               And vnder safegard euermore, I sillie boye was stayed.
               There did I sée such sights as yet my hart do pricke,
               I sawe the noble Bragadine, when he was fleyd quick.
               First like a slaue enforst to beare to euery breach,
               Two baskets laden full with earth Mustaffa did him teach.
               By whome he might not passe before he kisse the ground,
               These cruell torments (yet with mo) that worthy souldier foūd.
               His eares cut from his head, they set him in a chaire,
               And from a maine yard hoisted him alofte into the aire,
               That so he might be shewed with crueltie and spight,
               Unto vs all, whose weping eies did much abhore the sight.

               The christian crew came on, in forme of battaile pight,
               And like a cressent cast them selues preparing for to fight.
               On other side the Turkes, which trusted power to much,
               Disorderly did spread their force, the will of God was such.
               Well, at the last they met, and first with cannons thunder,
               Each other sought with furious force to slit their ships in sunder.

               That so I might at laste reedifye the walles,
               Which my good father had decayde by tossing fortunes balles:

               Upon my natiue countrey coastes with happie hap at laste:
               And if your honours please this honour me to doo,
               In Englishe hauens to harbour you, &amp; sée our Cities too:
               Lo London is not farre, where as my friends woulde be

               And to these louely lordes, whiche are Magnificoes,
               
               I did declare the whole discourse in order as it rose:
               That you my Lorde who are our chiefest Mountacute,
               
               And he whome Englishe Mountacutes their onely stay impute,
               Had

                  ounde the meanes this day to matche your sonne and heire,
               In marriage with a worthie dame which is bothe fresh and faire,
               And (as reportes are spread) of goodly qualities,
               A virgin trayned from hir youth in godly exercise,
               Whose brother had lykewise your daughter tane to wyfe,
               And so by double lynkes enchaynde themselues in louers lyfe:
               These noble Mountacutes whiche were from Venice drouen,
               By tempest (as I tolde before) wherwith they long had strouen
               Gan nowe giue thankes to God whiche so did them conuey,
               To sée such honours of their kinne in suche a happie day:
               And straight they me entreat, whom they might wel commande,
               That I should come to my Lord first them to recommaunde,
               And then this boone to craue, that vnder your protection
               They mighte be bolde to enter here, deuoyde of all suspection,
               And so in friendly wyse for to concelebrate,
               This happie matche solemnized, according to your state.
               Lo this is all they craue, the whiche I can not doubt,
               But that your Lordship soone will graūnt, with more, if more ye mought:
               Yea were it for no more, but for the Curtesye,
               Whiche (as I say) they shewed to me in great extremitie:
               They are Venetians, and though from Venice reft,
               They come in suche Venetian roabes as they on seas had left:
               And since they be your frendes, and kinsmen too by blood,
               I trust your entertainment will be to them right good:
               They will not tarrie long, lo nowe I heare thei
                     •
                   drumme,
               Beholde, lo nowe I sée them here in order howe they come,
               Receyue them well my lorde, so shall I pray alwayes,
               That God vouchsafe to blesse this house with many happie days.
            
            
               
               After the maske was done, the Actor tooke master. Tho. Bro. by the
hand and brought him to the Venetians, vvith these vvords:
               
                  GVardate Signori, my louely Lords behold,
               This is another Mountacute, hereof you may be bold.
               Of such our patrone here, The viscount Mountacute,
               
               Hath many comely sequences, well sorted all in sute.
               But as I spied him first I could not let him passe,
               I tooke the carde that likt me best, in order as it was.
               And here to you my lords, I do present the same,
               Make much of him, I pray you then, for he is of your name,
               For whome I dare aduance, he may your tronchman be,
               Your herald and ambassadour, let him play all for me.
            
            
               Then the Venetians embraced and receiued the same master
Tho. Brovvne, and after they had a vvhile vvhispered
vvith him, he tourned to the Bridegroomes
and Brides, saying thus.
               BRother, these noble men to you now haue me sent,
               As for their tronchman to expound theffect of their intent.
               They bid me tell you then, they like your worthy choice,
               And that they cannot choose therein but triumph and reioice.
               As farre as gesse may giue, they séeme to praise it well,
               They say betwene your ladies eyes doth Gentilezza dwell.
               I terme it as they do, their englishe is but weake,
               And I (God knowes) am all to yong beyond sea speach to speake.
               And you my sister eke they séeme for to commend,
               With such good words as may be séeme a cosin and a friend.
               They like your chosen pheare, so pray they for your sake,
               That he may alwayes be to you, a faithfull louing make.
               This in effect is all, but that they craue a boone,
               That you will giue them licence yet, to come and sée you soone.
               Then will they speake them selues, such english as they can,
               I feare much better than I speake, that am an english man.
               Lo now they take their leaues of you and of your dames,
               
                  Hereafter shal you sée their face and know them by their names.
            
            
               Then vvhen they had taken their leaues the Actor did
make an ende thus.
               And I your Seruidore, vibascio le mani.
               
               These words I learnt amongst them yet, although I learnte not many.

               MY worthy Lord, I pray you wonder not,
               To see your wodman shoote so ofte awrie,
               Nor that he stands amased like a sot,
               And lets the harmlesse deare (vnhurt) go by.
               Or if he strike a doe which is but carren,
               Laugh not good Lord, but fauoure such a fault,
               Take well I worth, he wold faine hit the barren,
               But though his harte be good, his happe is naught:
               And therefore now I craue your Lordships leaue,
               To tell you playne what is the cause of this:
               First if it please your honour to perceiue,
               What makes your wodman shoote so ofte amisse,
               
                  Beléeue me L. the case is nothing strange,
               He shootes awrie almost at euery mark
                     •
                  ,
               His eyes haue bene

                  o vsed for to raunge,
               That now God knowes they be both dimme and darke.
               For proofe he beares 
                     •
                  he note of follie nowe,
               Who shotte sometimes to hit Philosophie,
               And aske you why? for sooth I make auow,
               Bycause his wanton wittes went all awrie.
               Next that, he shot to be a man of lawe,
               And spent some time with lea
                     •
                  ned Litleton,
               Yet in the end, he proued but a dawe,
               For lawe was darke and he had quickly done.
               Then could he wish Fitzharbert such a braine,
               As Tully had, to write the law by arte,
               So that with pleasure, or with litle paine,
               He might perhaps, haue caught a trewants parte.
               But all to late, he most mislikte the thing,
               Which most might helpe to guide his arrow streight,
               He winked wrong, and so let slippe the string,
               Which cast him wide, for all his queint conceit.
               From thence 
                     •
                  e shotte to catch a courtly grace,
               And thought euen there to wield the world at will,
               But out alas he much mistooke the place,
               And shot awrie at euery rouer still.
               The blasing baits which drawe the gazing eye,
               Unfethered there his first affect
                     •
                  on,
               No wonder then although he shot awrie,
               Wanting the fethers of discretion.
               Yet more than them, the marks of dignitie,
               He much mistooke and shot the wronger way,
               Thinking the purse of prodigalitie,
               Had bene best meane to purchase such a pray,
               He thought the flattring face which fleareth still,
               Had bene full fraught with all fi

                  elitie,

                  Could not haue varied from the veritie.
               But when his bonet butte

                  ed with gold,
               His comelie cape begarded all with gay,
               His bumbast hose, with linings manifold,
               His knit silke stocks and all his queint aray,
               Had pickt his pu

                  se of all the Peter pence,
               Which might haue paide for his promotion,
               Then (all to late) he found that light expence,

                  ite quencht out the courts deuotion.
               So that since then the tast of miserie,
               Hath bene alwayes full bitter in his bit,
               And why? forsooth bicause he shot awrie,
               Mistaking still the markes which others hit.
               But now behold what marke the man doth find,
               He shootes to be a souldier in his age,
               Mistrusting all the vertues of the minde,
               He trusts the power of his personage.
               As though long limmes led by a lusty hart,

                  ght yet suffice to make him rich againe,
               But flussing fraies haue taught him such a parte,
               That now he thinks the warres yeld no such gaine.
               And sure I feare, vnlesse your lordship deigne,
               To traine him yet into some better trade,
               It will be long before he hit the veine,
               Whereby he may a richer man be made.
               He cannot climbe as other catchers can,
               To leade a charge before himselfe be led,
               He cannot spoile the simple sakeles man,
               Which is content to féede him with his bread.
               He cannot pinch the painefull souldiers pay,
               And sheare him out his share in ragged shéetes,
               He cannot stop to take a gredy pray
               Upon his fellowes groueling in the stréetes.
               He cannot pull the spoile from such as pill,
               And séeme full angrie at such foule offence,
               
                  Although the gayne content his gréedie will,
               Under the cloake of contrarie pretence:
               And nowe adayes, the man that shootes not so,
               Maye shoote amisse, euen as your Woodman dothe:
               But then you maruell why I lette them go,
               And neuer shoote, but saye farewell forsooth:
               Alas my Lorde, whyle I doe muze hereon,
               And call to mynde my youthfull yeares myspente,
               They giue mée suche a boane to gnawe vpon,
               That all my senses are in silence pente.
               My mynde is rapte in contemplation,
               Wherein my dazeled eyes onely beholde,
               The blacke houre of my constellation,
               Whyche framed mée so lucklesse on the molde:
               Yet therewithall I can not but confesse,
               That vayne presumption makes my heart to swell,
               For thus I thinke, not all the worlde (I) guesse,
               Shootes bet than I, nay some shootes not so well.
               In Aristotle somewhat did I learne,
               To guyde my manners all by comelynesse,
               And Tullie taught me somewhat to discerne
               Betwéene swéete spéeche and barbarous rudenesse.
               Olde Parkyns, Rastall, and Dan Bractens bookes,
               Did lende mée somewhat of the lawlesse Lawe,
               The craftie Courtyers with their guylefull lookes,
               Muste néedes put some experience in my mawe:
               Yet can not these with manye maystries mo,
               Make me shoote streyght at any gaynfull pricke,
               Where some that neuer handled such a bow,
               Can hit the white, or touch it neare the quicke,
               Who can nor speake, nor write in pleasant wise,
               Nor leade their life by Aristotles rule,
               Nor argue well on questions that arise,
               Nor pleade a case more than my Lord Maiors mule,
               Yet can they hit the marks that I do misse,
               
                  And winne the meane which may the man mainteine,
               Nowe when my mynde dothe mumble vpon this,
               No wonder then although I pyne for payne:
               And whyles myne eyes beholde this mirroure thus,
               The hearde goeth by, and farewell gentle does:
               So that your lordship quickely may discusse
               What blyndes myne eyes so ofte (as I suppose.)
               But since my Muse can to my Lorde reherse
               What makes me musse, and why I doe not shoote,
               Let me imagine in this woorthlesse verse:
               If right before mée, at my standings foote
               There stoode a Doe, and I shoulde strike hir deade,
               And then shée proue a carrion carkas too,
               What figure might I fynde within my head,
               To scuse the rage whiche rulde mée so to doo?
               Some myghte interprete by playne paraphrase,
               That lacke of skill or fortune ledde the chaunce,

               And made hir bolde is stande before mée so,
               Till I had thrust myne arrowe to hir harte,
               That by the sodaine of hir ouerthrowe,
               I myght endeuour to amende my parte,
               And turne myne eyes that they no more beholde,
               Suche guylefull markes as séeme more than they be:
               And though they glister outwardely lyke golde,
               Are inwardly but brasse, as men may sée:
               And when I see the milke hang in hir teate,

               Thus haue I tolde my Lorde, (God graunt in season)

                  THe figure of this world I can compare,
                  To Garden plots, and such like pleasaunt places,
                  The world bréedes men of sundry shape and share,
                  As herbes in gardens, grow of sundry graces:
                  Some good, some bad, some amiable faces,
                  Some foule, some gentle, some of 
                        •
                     roward mind,
                  Subiect like bloome, to blast of euery wind.
               
               
                  And as you sée the floures fresh of hew,
                  That they proue not alwayes the holsomest,
                  So fairest men are not alwayes found true:
                  But euen as withred weedes fall from the rest,
                  So flatterers fall naked from their neast:
                  When truth hath tried, their painting tising tale,
                  They loose their glosse, and all their iests séeme stale.
               
               
                  Yet some do present pleasure most estéeme,
                  Till beames of brauerie wither all their welth,
                  And some againe there be can rightly déeme,
                  Those herbes for best, which may mainteine their helth.
                  Considering well, that age drawes on by stelth,
                  And when the fairest floure is shronke and gone,
                  A well growne roote, will stand and shifte for one.
               
               
                  Then thus the restlesse life which men here leade,
                  May be resembled to the tender plant,
                  In spring it sprouts, as babes in cradle bréede,

                  And as the grounde or grasse whereon it grewe,
                  Was fatte or leane, euen so by it appeares,
                  If barreyn soyle, why then it chaungeth hewe,
                  It fadeth faste, it flits to fumbling yeares,
                  But if he gathered roote amongst his féeres,

                  IF any floure that there is growne,

                  If here to walke you take delyght,

               A Straunge conceyte, a vayne of newe delight,
               Twixte weale and woe, twixte ioy and bitter griefe,

                  A tipe of heauen, a liuely hew of hell,

               A life, a death, a drearie tale to tell▪
               
               But since I know the pith of my pastaunce

               And buildeth Castels in the Welkin wide,
               In hope thereby to dwell with wealth and ease.
               But he the Lord (whome my good Lord doth know)
               Can bind or lose, as best to him shall please,
               Can saue or spill, raise vp or ouerthrowe,

               And so him selfe (per Companye and seazon)
               For spite, for hate, or else for hope of gayne.
               This must we thinke that Alba would not spare
               To giue out gold for such a sinfull déede:
               And glistring gold can oftentimes ensnare,
               More perfect witts than Holland soyle doth bréede.
               But let that passe, and let vs now compare
               Our owne fond fact with this his foule offence.

               Yea moreth an that (how voyde were we of sense)

               He powrde out Dutch to drowae vs all in drinke,

               That English merchants euer bend their bowe
               To shoote at Breyll, where now our flight should fall,
               They send their shafts farder for greater gayne.
               So that this hauen is yet (quoth he) vnkouth,
               And God graunt now that England may attayne
               Such gaines by Breyll, (a gospell on that mouth)
               As is desired: thus spake the master playne.

               And when we had with prayers praysd the Lord,

               The selly shyppe was sowst and smytten sore,

               For there were some (of whome I will not say
               That I was one) which neuer changed hew,
               But pumpt apace, and labord euery way
               To saue themselues, and all their louely erew,
               Which cast the best fraight ouerboorde awaye,
               Both corne and cloth, and all that was of weight,
               Which halde and pulde at euery helping corde,
               Which prayed to God and made their conscience streight.
               As for my self: I here protest my Lorde,
               My words were these: O God in heauen on height,
               Behold me not as now a wycked wyght,
               A sacke of sinne, a wretch ywrapt in wroth,

               And of thy mercy pittie this our plight.
               Euen thou good God which of thy grace didst saye
               That for one good, thou wouldst all Sodome saue,
               Behold vs all: thy shyning beames displaye,
               Some here (I trust) thy goodnesse shall engraue,
               To be chast vessells vnto thée alwaye,
               And so to liue in honour of thy name:
               Beleue me Lord, thus to the Lord I sayde.
               But there were some (alas the more their blame)

                  ch in the pumpe their onely comfort layde,

               Alas (quod I) our pumpe good God must be
               Our sayle, our sterne, our tackling, and our trust.
               Some other cryed to cleare the shipboate frée,
               To saue the chiefe and leaue the rest in dust.
               Which word once spoke (a wondrous thing to sée)
               All hast post hast, was made to haue it done:
               
                  And vp it commes in hast much more than spéede.
               There did I sée a woful worke begonne,
               Which now (euen now) doth make my hart to bléede.
               Some made such hast that in the boate they wonne,
               Before it was aboue the hatches brought.
               Straunge tale to tell, what hast some men shall make
               To find their death before the same be sought.
               Some twixt the boate and shippe their bane do take,
               Both drownd and flayne with braynes for hast crusht out.
               At last the boate halfe fraighted in the aire
               Is hoyst aloft, and on the seas downe set,
               When I that yet in God could not despaire,
               Still plioe the pumpe, and patiently did let
               All such take boate as thither made repaire.
               And herewithall I safely may protest
               I might haue woonne the boate as well as one,
               And had that séemd a safetie for the rest
               I should percase euen with the first haue gone,
               But when I saw the b

               And therewithall with cherefull looke might sée
               My chiefe companions whome I held most deare
               (Whose companie had thither trained me)
               Abiding still aboord our shippe yfeare:
               Nay then (quoth I) good God thy will be done,
               For with my féeres I will both liue and dye.
               And eare the boate farrefrom our sight was gon
               The waue so wrought, that they which thought to flée
               And so to scape, with waues were ouerronne.
               Lo how he striues in vayne that striues with God,
               For there we lost the flowre of the band,
               And of our crew full twenty soules and odde,
               The Sea sucks vp, whiles we on hatches stand
               In smarting feare to féele that selfe same rodde.
               Well on (as yet) our battred barke did passe,
               
                  And brought the rest within a myle of lande,
               Then thought I sure now néede not I to passe,
               For I can swymme and so escape this sande.
               Thus dyd I déeme all carelesse like an Asse,
               When sodaynely the wynde our foresayle tooke,
               And turnd about and brought vs eft to Seas.
               Then cryed we all cast out the ancor hooke,
               And here let byde, such helpe as god may please:
               Which ancor cast, we soone the same forsooke,
               And cut it off, for feare least therevpon
               Our shippe should bowge, then callde we fast for fire,
               And so dischargde our great gunnes euerychone,

               But all in vayne, for succor sent they none.
               At last a Hoye from Sea came flynging fast,
               And towards vs helde course as streight as lyne.
               Then myght you sée our hands to heauen vp cast

               It turnd away and left vs still in carke,
               This tale is true (for now to lye were sin)
               It lefte vs there in dreade and daungers darke.
               It lefte vs so, and that within the sight

               Where inwardly they be but hollow geare,
               As weake as wynde, which with one pufft vp goeth.

               Athough in dede (as they haue suffred Spayne)
               The ende therof euen now doth rest in doubt.
               Well as for that, let it (for me) remayne
               In God his hands, whose hand hath brought me out,
               To tell my Lord this tale now tane in hand,
               As how they traine their treasons all in drinke,
               And when themselues for dronk can scarcely stand,

               Or else he can (but let it passe in rime)
               Dissemble déepe, and mocke sometimes the more.
               Well, drunkenesse is here good companye,
               And therewithall per consequence it falles,

                     I will be bold (by his leaue) for to tell,
                     The restlesse state wherein he long did dwell.
                  
                  
                     Learned he was, and that became him best,
                     For though by birth he came of worthy race,
                     Yet beuty, birth, braue personage, and the rest,
                     In euery choyce, must néedes giue learning place:
                     And as for him he had so hard a grace,
                     That by aspect he séemde a simple man,
                     And yet by learning much renowne he wan.
                  
                  
                     His name I hide, and yet for this discourse,
                     Let call his name Dan Ba

                           •

                     In déede the rage which wroong him ther, was rathe,
                     As by this tale I thinke your selfe will gesse,
                     And then (with me) his lothsome life confesse.
                  
                  
                     For though he had in all his learned lore
                     Both redde good rules to bridle fantasie,
                     And all good authours taught him euermore,
                     To loue the meane, and leaue extremitie,
                     Yet kind had lent him such a qualitie,
                     That at the last he quite forgat his bookes,

                  Which all to long hath held my lingring life,
                  And here aloofe now haue I hid my head,
                  From companie, thereby to stint my strife.
                  This solitarie place doth please me best,
                  Where I may weare my willing mind with mone,
                  And where the sighes which boyle out of my brest,
                  May skald my heart, and yet the cause vnknowne.
                  All this I do, for thée my swéetest sowre,
                  For whome (of yore) I counted not of care,
                  For whome with hungrie iawes I did deuoure
                  The secret baite which lurked in the snare:
                  For whome I thought all foreine pleasures payne,
                  For whome againe, all paine did pleasure séeme,
                  But only thine, I found all fansies vayne,
                  But onely thine, I did no dolours déeme.
                  Such was the rage, that whylome did possesse
                  The priuie corners of my mazed mind:
                  When hote desire, did coumpt those torments lesse
                  Which gaind the gaze that did my fredome bind.
                  And now (with care) I can record those dayes,
                  And call to mind the quiet life I led
                  Before I first beheld thy golden rayes,
                  When thine vntruth yet troubled not my hed.
                  Remember thou, as I cannot forget,
                  How I had layd, both loue, and lust aside,
                  And how I had my fixed fancie set,
                  In constant vow, for euer to abide.
                  The bitter proofe of pangs in pleasure past,
                  The costly tast, of hony mixt with gall:
                  The painted heauen, which turnde to hell at last
                  The fréedome faind, which brought me but to thrall.
                  The lingring sute, well fed with fresh delayes.
                  
                     The wasted vowes which fled with euery winde:
                  The restlesse nights, to purchase pleasing dayes,
                  The toyling dayes to please my restlesse minde.
                  All these (with mo) had brused so my brest,
                  And graft such griefe within my gronyng heart,
                  That I had left dame fansie and the rest
                  To gréener yeares, which might endure the smart.
                  My wearie bones did beare away the skarres,
                  Of many a wounde, receyued by disdayne:
                  So that I founde the fruite of all those warres,
                  To be naught else but pangs of vnknowne payne.
                  And now myne eyes were shut from such delight,
                  My fansie faynt, my hote desires were colde,
                  When cruell hap, presented to my sight,
                  Thy maydens face, in yeares which were not olde.
                  I thinke the goddesse of reuenge deuysde,
                  So to be wreackt on my rebelling will,
                  Bycause I had in youthfull yeares dispysde,
                  To taste the baytes, which tyste my sansie still.
                  How so it were, God knowes, I cannot tell:
                  But if I lye, you heauens, the plague be myne,
                  I sawe no sooner, how delight did dwell
                  Betwéene those lytle infants eyes of thine,
                  But streight a sparkling cole of quicke desire,
                  Did kyndle flame within my frozen heart,
                  And yelding fansie softly blewe the fire,
                  Which since hath bene the cause of all my smart.
                  What néede I say? thy selfe for me can sweare,
                  How much I tendred thée in tender yeares:
                  Thy life was then to me (God knowes) full deare,
                  My life to thée is light, as nowe appeares.
                  I loued thée first, and shall do to my laste,

                  For loue of thée full many paynes I past,
                  For deadly hate thou séekest me to kyll.

                  Nor Hanyball, with martiall feates endude,
                  Did so much please himselfe in pollicie,

                  With hole Alarmes I comforted my men,
                  In formost ranke I stoode before the rest,

                  Bycause she did forsake him that was true,

                  I founde naught else but tricks of Cressides kynde,

                  No chaunge of meate prouokes mine appetite,
                  Nor sauce can serue to taste my meates withall,
                  Then I deuise the iuyce of grapes to dight,
                  For Suger and for Sinamon I call,
                  For Ginger, Graines, and for eche other spyce,
                  Where with I mixe the noble wine apace,
                  My fellowes prayse the depth of my deuise,
                  And say it is as good as Ippocrace.
                  As Ippocrace say I? and then I swelt,
                  My faynting lymmes streight fall into a sowne,
                  Before the taste of Ippocrace is felt,
                  The naked name in dolours doth me drowne,
                  For then I call vnto my troubled mynd,
                  That Ippocrace hath bene thy dayly drincke,
                  That Ippocrace hath walkt with euery winde
                  In bottells that were fylled to the brincke.
                  With Ippocrace thou banquetedst full ofte,
                  With Ippocrace thou madst thy selfe full merry,
                  Such chéere had set thy new loue so alofte,
                  That olde loue now was scarsely worth a cherry.
                  And then againe I fall into a traunce,
                  But when my breth returnes against my will,
                  Before my tongue can tell my wofull chaunce,
                  I heare my fellowes how they whisper still.
                  One sayth that Ippocrace is contrary,
                  Unto my nature and comple

                     ion,
                  Whereby they iudge that all my maladye,
                  Was long of that by alteration.
                  
                     An other sayth, no, no this man is weake,
                  And for such weake, so hote things are not best,
                  Then at the last I heare no liar speake,
                  But one which knowes the cause of myne vnrest,
                  And saith, this man is (for my life) in loue,
                  He hath receiued repulse, or dronke disdaine,
                  Alas crie I: and ere I can remoue,

                  Thus driue I foorth, my dolefull dining time,
                  And trouble others with my troubles still,
                  But when I here, the bell hath passed prime
                  Into the Bathe I wallow by my will,
                  That there my teares (vnséene) might ease my griefe,
                  For though I sterue yet haue I fed my fill,
                  In priuie pangs I count my best reliefe.
                  And still I striue in wery woes to drench.
                  But when I plondge▪ then wo is at an ebbe,
                  My glowing coles are all to quicke to quench,
                  And I (to warme) am wrapped in the webbe,
                  Which makes me swim against the wished waue,
                  Lo thus (déere wench) I leade a lothsome life,
                  And gréedely I séeke the gréedy graue,
                  To make an end of all these stormes and strife.
                  But death is deafe, and heares not my desire,
                  So that my dayes continue still in dole,
                  And in my nights, I féele the secret fire,
                  Which close in embers, coucheth like a cole,
                  And in the day hath bin but raked vp,
                  With couering ashes of my companie,
                  Now breaks it out, and boyles the carefull cuppe,
                  Which in my hart, doth hang full heauily.
                  I melt in teares, I swelt in chilling sweat,
                  My swelling heart, breaks with delay of payne
                  I fréeze in hope, yet burne in hast of heate,
                  I wish for death, and yet in life remaine.
                  
                     And when dead sléepe doth close my dazeled eyes,
                  Then dreadfull dreames my dolors do encrease,
                  Me thinks I lie awake in wofull wise,
                  And see thée come, my sorrowes for to cease.
                  Me seemes thou saist (my good) what meaneth this?
                  What ayles thée thus to languish and lament?
                  How can it be that bathing all in blisse,
                  Such cause vnknowne disquiets thy content?
                  Thou doest me wrong to kéepe so close from me
                  The grudge or griefe, which gripeth now thy heart,
                  For well thou knowest, I must thy partner be
                  In bale, in blisse, in solace, and in smarte.
                  Alas, alas, these things I déeme in dreames,
                  But when mine eyes are open and awake,
                  I sée not thée, wherewith the flowing streames,

                  I take my pen and paper for the nonce,
                  I lay aside this folish riding time,
                  And as my troubled head can bring to passe,
                  I thus bewray the torments of my time:

                     I stroue each way to stop my fainting breath.
                     Shorte tale to make, I slept so farre in strife,
                     That still I sought,
                     With all my thought,
                     Some happie helpe to leaue my lothed life.
                  
                  
                     But hope was he that held my hand abacke,
                     From quicke dispatch of all my g
                           •
                        iping griefe,
                     When heate of hate had burnt my will to wracke,
                     Then hope was cold and lent my life reliefe,
                     In euery choyce hope challengde to be chiefe.
                     When coldest crampes had cleane or
                           •
                         come my harte,
                     Then hope was hotte, and warnde my weary smart,
                     When hart was hardie, hope was still in dread,
                     When hart was faint,
                     With feares attaint,
                     Then hardie hope held vp my fearefull head.
                  
                  
                     Thus when I found that neither flowing teares
                     Could drowne my hart in waues of wery wo,
                     Nor hardy hand could ouercome my feares,
                     
                        To cut the sacke of all my sorrow so,
                     Nor death would come, nor I to death could go.
                     And yet I felt great droppes of secret smart▪
                     
                     Distilling still within my dying harte:
                     I then perceiud that only Care was he,
                     Which as my frend,
                     Might make an end,
                     Of all these paines, and set my fansie frée.
                  
                  
                     Wherefore (oh Care) graunt thou my iust request▪
                     
                     Oh kill my corps, oh quickly kill me now,
                     Oh make an end and bring my bones to rest,
                     Oh cut my thred (good Care) I care not how,
                     Oh Care be kind: and here I make a vowe,
                     That when my life out of my brest shall parte▪
                     
                     I will present thée with my faithfull harte▪
                     
                     And send it to thée as a Sacrifice,
                     Bycause thou hast,
                     Uouchsaft at last,
                     To end my furies in this friendly wise.
                  
                  Fato non fortuna.
               
               
                  WHat greater glory can a Keysar gaine,
                  If madde moode moue his subiects to rebell,
                  Than that at last (when all the traytours traine,
                  Haue trod the path▪ of déepe repentance well,
                  And naked néede with Cold and Hunger both,
                  Hath bitten them abrode in forren land,
                  Whereby they may their lewde deuises loth.
                  When harebraind hast, with cold aduise is scande)
                  If then at last, they come vpon their knée,
                  And pardon craue with due submission,
                  And for this cause, I thinke that Care of me,
                  Was moued most, to take compassion.
                  For now I find, that pittie pricks his mind,
                  
                     To sée me ploo
                        •
                     ged still in endlesse paine,
                  And right remorse, his princely hart doth bind,
                  To rule the rage wherein I do remaine.
                  I féele my teares do now begin to stay,
                  For Care from them their swelling springs doth soke,
                  I féele my sighes their labours now allaye,
                  For care hath quencht the coles that made them smoke.
                  I féele my panting harte begins to rest,
                  For Care hath staide the hammers of my hed,
                  I féele the flame which blazed in my brest,
                  Are now with carefull ashes ouerspred.
                  And gentle Care, hath whet his karuing knife,
                  To cut in twaine the thred of all my thrall,
                  Desired death now ouercommeth life,
                  And we still works to helpe in hast with all.
                  But since I féele these pangs approching so,
                  And lothed life begin to take his leaue,
                  Me thinks it méete, to giue before I go.
                  Such lands, and goodes, as I behind me leaue.
                  So to discharge my troubled conscience,
                  And eke to set an order for mine heire,
                  Who might (perhaps) be put to great expence,
                  To sue for that, which I bequeath him here.
                  Wherefore (déere wench) with all my full intent,
                  I thus begin to make my Testament.
                  Fato non fortuna.
               
               
                  His last will and Testament.
                  IN Ioue his mightie name, this eight and twentith day,
                  Of frosty bearded Ianuar, the enemie to May:
                  Since Adam was create, fiue thousand yeares I gesse,
                  Fiue hundreth, forty more and fiue, as stories do expresse.
                  I being whole of mind, (immortall Gods haue praise)
                  Though in my body languishing with pang
                        •
                      of paine alwayes,
                  
                     Do thus ordeyne my will which long in woes haue wepte,
                  Beseeching myne executours to sée it duely kepte.
                  Firste I bequeath my soule on Charons boate to tende,
                  Untill thy lyfe (my loue) at laste may light on luckie ende,
                  That there it may awayte, to wayte vpon thy ghost,
                  When y• haste quite &amp; clean forgot what prāks now please thée most.
                  So shal it wel be seene whose loue is lyke to myne:
                  For so I meane to trie my truth, and there till then to pine.
                  My bodie be enbalmde, and cloazed vp in chest,
                  With oyntments and with spiceries of euery swéete the best:
                  And so preserued still vntill the day doe come,
                  That death deuorce my loue frō life, &amp; trusse hir vp in tombe.
                  Then I bequeath my corps to couche beneath hir bones,
                  And there to féede the gréedie woorms that linger for the nones
                  To frette vpon hir fleshe, whiche is too fyne therefore,
                  This seruice may it doe hir yet, although it do no more.
                  My hearte (as heretofore) I must bequeath to Care,
                  And God he knowes, I thinke the gift to simple for his share,
                  But that he may perceiue, I meane to pay my dew,
                  I will it shall be taken quick, and borne him bleding new,
                  As for my funeralls, I leaue that toye at large,
                  To be as mine executors will giue thereto in charge.
                  Yet if my goods will stretch vnto my straunge deuice,
                  Then let this order be obseru'd, mine heire shall pay the price:
                  First let the torche bearers be wrapt in wéedes of woe,
                  Let all their lights be virgin waxe, bicause I lou'd it so.
                  And care not though the twist be course that lends them light,
                  If fansie fume, &amp; frewill flame, thē must they néeds burn bright.
                  Next them let come the quyer, with psalmes &amp; dolefull song,
                  Recording all my rough repulse and wraying all my wrong,
                  And when the deskant sings, in tréeble tunes aboue,
                  Then let fa burden, say (by lowe) I liu'd and dayde for loue:
                  
                  About my heauie hearse, some mourners wold I haue,
                  Who might the same accompany, and stand about the graue,
                  But let them be suche men, as may confesse with me,
                  
                     Howe contrary the lots of loue, to all true louers be.
                  Let Pacience be the Priest, the Clearke be Close conceit,
                  The Sexten be Symplicitie, which meaneth no disceit.
                  Let almes of Loue be delt, euen at the Chauncell dore,
                  And feede them there with fresh delayes, as I haue 
                        •
                     en of yore:
                  Then let the yongest sort, be set to ring Loues bells,
                  And pay Repentance for their paines, but giue thē nothing else,
                  Thus when the Dirge is done, let euery man depart,
                  And learne by me what harme it is to haue a faithfull hart.
                  Those little lands I haue, mine heyre must néedes possesse,
                  His name is Lust, the lands be losse, few louers scape with lesse.
                  The best of all my goods, which I not here rehearse,
                  Giue learned Poets for their paines, to deck my tomb wt verse:
                  And let them wryte these words vpon my carefull chest,
                  Lo here he lyes, that was as true (in loue) as is the best.
                  Alas I had forgot the persons dewe to paye,
                  And so my soule in Purgatory, might remaine alway.
                  Then for my priuie Tythes; as kysses caught by stealth,
                  Swete collings &amp; such other knachs as multiplyed my wealth:
                  I giue the Uicar here, to please his gredie will,
                  A deyntie dishe of suger soppes but saust with sorow still:
                  And twice a wéeke at least, let dight them for his dishe,
                  O
                        •
                      frydayes and on wednesdayes, to saue expence of fishe.
                  Now haue I much bequeathed and little left behynde,
                  And others mo must yet be serued or else I were vnkynde.
                  Wet eyes and wayling words, Executors I make,
                  And for their paines ten pounde of teares let either of thē take▪
                  
                  Let sorow at the last my Suprauisor be,
                  And stedfastnesse my surest stead, I giue him for his fée:
                  Yet in his pattent place this Sentence of prouiso,
                  
                  That he which loueth stedfastly, shall want no sa
                        •
                     se of sorow.
                  Thus now I make an ende, of this my wearie will,
                  And signe it with my simple hand, and set my seale there till.
                  And you which reade my words, although they be in rime,
                  Yet reason may perswade you eke, Thus louers dote sometime.
                  
               
               
                  
                  The Subscription and seale.
                  MY Mansion house was Mone: from Dolors dale I came,
                  I Fato: Non Fortuna, hight, lo now you know my name:
                  My seale is sorowes sythe, within a fielde of fame,
                  Which cuts in twaine a carefull hart, y• sweltreth in the same.
                  Fato non Fortuna.
               
               
                  ALas, lo now I heare the passing Bell,
                  Which Care appoynteth carefully to knoule,
                  And in my breast, I féele my hart now swell,
                  To breake the strings, which ioynde it to my soule.

                     e, which lent mine eyes their light,
                  Doth now waxe dym, and dazeled all with dread,
                  My senses all, will now forsake me quite,
                  And hope of health abandoneth my head,
                  My weary tongue can talke no longer now,
                  My trembling hand now leaues my penne to holde,
                  My ioynts now stretch, my body cannot bowe,
                  My skynne lokes pale, my blood now waxeth colde.
                  And are not these, the very pangs of death?
                  Yes sure (swéete hart) I know them so to be,
                  They be the pangs, which striue to stop my breath,
                  They be the pangs, which part my loue from thée.
                  What said I? Loue? Nay lyfe: but not my loue,
                  My life departes, my loue continues still:
                  My lothed lyfe may from my corpse remoue,
                  My louing Loue shall alwayes worke thy will.
                  It was thy will euen thus to trye my truth,
                  Thou hast thy will, my truth may now be séene,
                  It was thy will, that I should dye in youth,
                  Thou hast thy will my yeares are yet but grene.
                  Thy penance was that I should pyne in paine,
                  I haue performd thy penance all in wo,
                  
                     Thy pleasure was that I should here remayne,
                  I haue bene glad to please thy fansie so.
                  Now since I haue performed euery part
                  Of thy commaunde, as neare as tong can tell,
                  Content thée yet before my Muse departe,
                  To take this Sonet for my last farewell.
                  Fato non fortuna.
               
               
                  His Farewell.

                  For proofe wherof my spryte is Charons thrall,
                  And yet my corpse attendant on thy toome.
                  Farewell déere swéete, whose wanton will to please
                  Eche taste of trouble séemed mell to me,
                  Farewell swete déere, whose doubts for to appease,

                  And brought him eke fast bounde in follyes bands)
                  Of curtesye I kéepe them from your sight,
                  Let these suffise which of my selfe I wryte.
               
               
                  The highest trée that euer yet coulde growe,
                  Although full fayre it florysht for a season,
                  Founde yet at last some fall to bring it lowe,
                  This olde sayd sawe is (God he knoweth) not ge ason:
                  For when things passe the reache and bounds of reason
                  They fall at last, although they stande a time,
                  And bruse the more, the higher that they clyme.
               
               
                  So Bartholmew vnto his payne dyd proue.
                  For when he thought his happe to be most hie,
                  And that he onely reapt the frutes of loue,
                  And that he swelt in all prosperitie,
                  His comforte chaunged to calamitie:
                  And though I do him wrong to tell the same,
                  Yet reade it you, and let me beare the blame.
               
               
                  The Saint he serv'd became a craftie deuill,
                  His goddesse to an Idoll séemed to chaunge,
                  Thus all his good transformed into euill,
                  And euery ioy to raging griefe did raunge:
                  Which Metamorphosis was meruells straunge:
                  Yet shall you seldome otherwyse it proue,
                  Where wicked Lust doth beare the name of Loue.
               
               
                  
                  This sodayne chaunge when he began to spye,
                  And

                  He bounst and bet his head formentingly,
                  And from all companye himselfe he kept,
                  Whereby so farre in stormes of strife he stept,
                  That nowe he séemed an Image not a man,
                  His eyes so dead, his colour waxt so wan.
               
               
                  And I which alwayes bare him great good will,
                  (Although I knew the cause of all his griefe,
                  And what had traynde and tysed him theretyll,
                  And playne to speake, what moued his myschiefe,
                  Yet since I sought to ease him with releife:)
                  I did become importunate to knowe,
                  The secrete cause wheron this grudge shuld growe.

                  Which verse he wrote of Bathe (as earst was sayd)
                  And there I sawe him when he wrote the same,
                  I sawe him there with many moanes dysmayde,

               Alas alas how might my tong deuise

               To tell I say these tidings now of truth,
               Which may prouoke the craggy rocks to ruth?
            
            
               In depth of dole would God that I were drownde,

                  ttring ioyes might neuer find me out,
               Or graued so within the gréedy ground,
               As false delights might neuer bréede my doubt,
               Nor guilefull loue hir purpose bring about:
               Whose trustlesse traines in colours for to paint,
               I find by proofe my witts are all to faint.
            
            
               I am that man whome destenies ordeine,
               To beare each griefe that groweth on the mold,
               I am that man which proue vnto my paine,
               More pangs at once than can with tong be told,
               I am that man (hereof you may be bold)
               Whome heauen and earth did frame to scoffe and scorne,
               I, I am he which to that end was borne.
            
            
               Suffized not my selfe to tast the frute,
               Of 
                     •
                  ugred sowres which growe in gadding yeares,
               But that I must with paine of like pursute,
               Perceiue such pangs by paterne of my peares,
               And feele how fansies fume could fond my pheares:
               Alas I finde all fates against me bent,
               For nothing else I liue, but to lament.
            
            
               The force of frendship bound by holy oth,
               
                  Did drawe my will into these croked wayes,
               For with my frend I went to Bathe (though loth)
               To lend some comfort in his dolie dayes,
               The stedfast friend sticks fast at all assayes:
               Yet was I loth such time to spend in vaine,
               The cause whereof, lo here I tell you playne.
            
            
               By proofe I found as you may well perceiue,
               That all good counsell was but worne in wast,
               Such painted paines his passions did deceiue,
               That bitter gall was mell to him in tast,
               Within his will such rootes of ruine plast,
               As graffes of griefes were only giuen to growe,
               Where youth did plant and rash conceite did sowe.
            
            
               I sawe long since his eares were open aye
               To euery tale which fed him with some hope,
               As fast againe I sawe him turne away
               From graue aduise, which might his conscience grope,
               From reasons rule his fansie lightly lope,
               He only gaue his mind to get that gaine,
               Which most he wisht and least could yet attayne.
            
            
               Not I alone, but many mo with me,
               Had found what ficklenesse his Idoll vsed,
               And how she claimed Cressides heire to be,
               And how she had his great good will abused,
               And how she was of many men refused,
               Who tride hir tricks and knew hir by the kinde,
               Saue only him she made no louer blinde.
            
            
               But what for this? whose face is plainer séene,
               Than he which thinks he walketh in a net?
               Or who in bale hath euer déeper béene,
               Than he which thought his state might not be bet,
               
                  In such a iealosie these louers iet,
               That weale to them doth séeme to be but we,
               And griefe séemes ioy, they holde their fancies so.
            
            
               Tell him that reason ought to be his rule,
               And he allowed no reason but his owne,
               Tell him that best were quickly to recule,
               Before all force by feare were ouerthrowen,
               And that his part. &amp;c.
