            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            A Preface.
            
               FOR truth of this Hiſtory
enſuing, beſides circumſtances
of place, perſon,
time, occaſion, ſo exactly obſerved;
I referre my ſelfe to the
Relation of thoſe Godly men, who
in ſeverall languages have manifeſted
to the world the ſeverall paſſages
thereof: and although I am
not ignorant, that at the firſt they
were not only not credited, but alſo
diſcredited and ſlandered, by ſuch
as found them to bee a Blur to the
Romane Profeſsion, yet they lost not
their luſtre thereby, but being acquitted
by many Compurgators of
ſeverall Nations, and ſome of the
Romiſh Religion, being all of them
ſpectators of this Tragedie. It occaſioned

not only a further manifeſtation
and confirmation of the
truth, but alſo a large &amp; more frequent
confluence, to ſee that which
they had formerly only heard of.
This partly appeareth out of the
ſucceeding Story; but more fully
out of an Apology written by Vergerius
Biſhop of Iuſtinople, who
was accuſed for diſperſing the fame
of this Example to the ſtaine of
Popery, in which Apology to N.
Rottan, Suffragen of Padua, is
ſhortly and plainly declared, what
was ſaid, what was done, and who
were preſent. If that it be demanded,
what mooved mee to compile
this Treatiſe; Spira—tell them that
it ſhould teach feare and reverence,
and indeed among all thoſe that
come to ſee him, few or none returnes
unſhaken. Vergerius in his
firſt Epistle ſaith; I would faine
goe ſee him again, but I exceedingly

feare and tremble, and in his Apologie
ſaith, it is ſuch a rare example,
as I would willingly goe to
the furthest parts of the world to
heare or ſee the like. The Lady
Iane to her Fathers Chaplaine
(that had falne into Spira's ſinne)
ſaith, remember the lamentable eſtate
of Spira. I acknowledge that
there hath beene formerly a Booke
publiſhed in our Mother tongue,
concerning this ſubject, but as farre
as I can learne (for I could never
yet obtaine to ſee any one of them)
it was nothing ſo large and various
as this preſent Treatiſe, and as I
have heard, a tranſlation of onely
one of the Tractates, from whence I
have gathered this preſent Diſcourſe
in part. Concerning my care
and fidelitie in this buſineſſe, it is
ſuch as I may truely ſay without
changing of colour, that there is not
one ſentence of all this Worke attributed

unto the perſon of Spira, but
it hath it warrant, either from the
Epiſtles of Vergerius and Gribaldus,
Profeſſours of the Law in
Padua, or from the Diſcourſes of
Henry Scringer a Scotiſh man,
Sigiſmund Gelons a Tranſilvanian,
and Martin Bocha a Divine
of Baſill: neither have I taken any
other Libertie then as a Relation to
weave the aforeſaid Diſcourſes one
within another, ſo as thoſe which
under ſeverall Writers, were before
counted ſeverall, are now by
my indeavours reduced into one intire
Hiſtory, connexed by due ſucceſſion
of time and occaſion, as
punctually as could be aimed at, by
the circumſtances noted in the Writings
of thoſe holy and learned men
before named.

            A
RELATION OF
the fearefull eſtate of
FRANCIS SPIRA.
            
               IN the yeare 1548.
when the glorious
Sunne of the
Goſpel was but newly riſen
in Europe; in the daies
of the raigne of Edward
the Sixth of that name
King of England: In the
Territory, and under the
Iuriſdiction of the Citie
of Venice, being the very
border of Italy, in the

towne of Cittadella, lived
one Francis Spira, a Civill
Lawyer, an Advocate
of great rank and eſteeme,
being of knowne learning,
&amp; eloquence? of great
experience; of carriage
circumſpect and ſevere;
his ſpeech grave &amp; compoſed,
his countenance
ſharpe and auſtere; every
way befitting that authoritie
whereunto hee was
advanced; endowed vvith
outward bleſsings, of
wife, &amp; eleven children,
&amp; wealth in abundance:
what his worſt parts
were, I have no other

warrant, then his owne
words, which (if not tainted
overmuch, with the
bitterneſſe of a deſperate
mind, and bearing the
countenance rather of
paſsion, then of ſober
confeſsion) may ſeeme to
adde a period to all further
commendations.
            
               I was (ſaid hee) exceſſively
covetous of money, and
accordingly I applyed my
ſelfe to get by injuſtice, corrupting
juſtice by deceit, inventing
tricks to delude juſtice:
good cauſes I either
defended deceitfully, or ſold
them to the adverſary perfidiouſly;

ill cauſes I maintained
with all my might; I
wittingly oppoſed the known
truth, and the truſt committed
unto me, I either betrayed
or perverted. Thus having
worn out forty foure
yeares, or there abouts,
and the news of the new,
or rather newly revived
opinions of Luther comming
into thoſe parts, repreſented
an object of
noveltie unto him; who
being as deſirous to know
as hee was famous for
knowledge; ſuffered not
theſe wandring opinions
to paſſe unexamined, but

ſearching into the Scriptures,
and into all bookes
of Controverſie that hee
could get, both old and
new; and finding more
then fame or opinion, he
began to taſte their nature
ſo well, as he entertaines,
loves, and ownes them at
length; and with ſuch
zeale, as he became a profeſſor;
yea a teacher of
them, firſt to his wife,
children, and family, and
after to his friends, and
familiar acquaintance; &amp;
in compariſon, ſeemed to
neglect all other affaires;
intending ever to preſſe

this maine point, that We
muſt wholly, and only to depend
on the free, and unchangeable
love of God in
the death of Chriſt, as the
only ſure way to ſalvation:
and this was the ſumme
of all his diſcourſe, and
this continued for the
ſpace of ſixe yeares, or
there abouts; even ſo long
as this fire could keepe it
ſelfe within private wals;
but at length it brake
forth into publique meetings;
ſo as the whole
Province of Padua dawned
by the luſtre thereof.
The Clergie finding the

trade of their pardons to
decay; and their Purgatory
to waxe cold, began
to beſtirre themſelves;
gloſing their actions firſt
with calumnious aſperſions
upon the whole profeſsion,
then more plainly
ſtriking at Spira with
grievous accuſatiōs: And
to effect their purpoſe,
ſome promiſe labour, others
favour, ſome advice,
others maintenance; all
joyne to divide, either his
ſoule from his body, or
both from God.
            Now was Iohn Caſa
the Popes Legate reſident

at Venice, being by birth a
Florentine; and one that
wanted neither malice againſt
thoſe of this way,
nor craftines to effect his
malicious purpoſes: To
him theſe men repaire
with outcries againſt Spira;
that hee was the man
that cōdemned the received
rites of the Church;
deluded the Eccleſiaſticall
power, and ſcandalized
the policie thereof; one
of no meane ranke; being
a man of Account and authoritie,
and thereunto,
learned in the Scriptures,
elegant in ſpeech; and in

one word, a dangerous
Lutheran; having alſo
many diſciples, and therefore
not to be deſpiſed.
            At this began the Legate
to caſt his eye on the
terrible alteration that
lately had hapned in Germanie;
where, by the
means of one onely Luther,
the Romiſh Religion
had ſuffered ſuch a blow,
as that it could neither
bee cured by diſsimulation,
nor defended by
power; but the Clergie
muſt either mend their
manners, or loſe their
dignities: on the other

ſide, when hee ſaw how
propenſe the common
people inhabiting in the
bordering countries of Italy
vvere to entertaine
thoſe new opinions, hee
now thought it no time
to diſpute, or perſwade,
but with ſpeed repaires to
the Senate, and procures
authoritie from them to
ſend for Spira.
            
            
               Spira by this time had
conſidered vvith himſelfe
of the nature of his carriage,
how evident and
notorious it vvas, and
therefore ſubject to bee
envied by ſuch, as neither

liked his perſon nor Religion,
hee perceived that
his opinions were neither
retyred nor ſpeculative,
but ſuch as aymed
at the overthrovv of the
Romiſh Faction, and at
change of Policie,
vvherein at the beſt, he
could expect but a bloudy
victory, and that his
enemies vvanted neither
povver nor occaſion to
call him to account in
publique, vvhen he muſt
either Apoſtatize, and
ſhamefully give his former
life, yea his ovvn conſcience
the lye, or endure

the utmoſt malice of his
deadly enemies, or forſake
his wife, children,
friends, goods, authoritie;
yea, his deare Countrey;
and betake himſelfe to a
forraigne people, there to
endure a thouſand miſeries,
that do continually
waite upon a voluntary
exile. Being thus diſtracted,
and toſſed in the reſtleſſe
waves of doubt,
without guid to truſt to,
or haven to flye to for ſuccour;
on the ſudden Gods
Spirit aſsiſting, hee felt a
calme, and began to diſcourſe
with himſelfe in

this manner:
            Why wandreſt thou thus
in uncertainties, unhappy
man; caſt away feare, put
on thy ſhield, the ſhield of
faith; Where is thy wonted
courage, thy goodneſſe, thy
conſtancie? remember that
Chriſts glorie lies at the
ſtake, ſuffer thou without
feare, and hee will defend
thee, hee will tell thee what
thou ſhalt anſwer; hee can
beat downe all danger, bring
thee out of priſon, raiſe thee
from the dead; conſider Peter
in the dungeon, the Martyrs
in the fire, if thou makeſt
a good confeſſion, thou

mayeſt indeed goe to priſon,
or death, but an eternall reward
in heaven remaines
for thee; What haſt thou in
this world comparable to eternall
life, to everlaſting
happineſſe? if thou doſt otherwiſe,
thinke of the ſcandall;
(common people live by
example, thinking what ever
is done, is well done)
feare the loſſe of peace and
joy, feare hell, death, and eternall
wrath; or if thy
fleſh be ſo ſtrong, as to cauſe
thee to doubt of the iſſue, flie
thy Countrie; get thee away,
though never ſo far, rather
then denie the Lord of Life.
            
               
               Now was Spira in
reaſonable quiet, being
reſolved to yeeld to
theſe weightie reaſons;
yet holding it wiſedome
to examine all things,
hee conſults alſo with
fleſh and bloud; thus
the battaile doth renew,
and the fleſh beginnes
in this manner:
Bee well adviſed, fond
man, conſider reaſons on
both ſides, and then judge:
how canſt thou thus overweene
thine owne ſufficiencie,
as thou neither
regardeſt the examples
of thy Progenitors; nor

the judgment of the whole
Church; doſt thou not conſider
what miſerie this thy
raſhneſſe will bring thee
unto? thou ſhalt loſe thy ſubstance,
gotten with ſo much
care and travell, thou ſhalt
undergoe the moſt exquiſite
torments that malice it
ſelfe can deviſe, thou ſhalt
bee counted an heretique of
all: and to cloſe up all, thou
ſhalt die ſhamefully. What
thinkeſt thou of the loathſome
ſtinking dungeon, the
bloudie axe, the burning
fagot, are they delightfull?
Bee wiſe at length, and
keepe thy life and honour,

thou maiſt live to do much
good to good men, as God
commands thee, thou maiſt
be an ornament to thy Countrie;
and put caſe thy Countries
loſſe would bee of ſmall
eſteeme with thee; Wilt thou
bring thy friends alſo into
danger? thou haſt begotten
children, wilt thou now cut
their throats, &amp; inhumanely
butcher them, which may
in time bring honor to their
Countrie, glorie to God,
helpe and furtherance to his
Church: goe to the Legate
weake man, freely confeſſe
thy fault, and helpe all theſe
miſeries. Thus did the

cares of this world, and
the deceitfullneſſe of riches,
choke the good Seed
that was formerly ſowne;
ſo as fearing, hee faints,
and yeelds unto the allurements
of this preſent
world, &amp; being thus blinded,
he goes to the Legate
at Venice, and ſalutes him
with this news.
            
            Having for theſe divers
yeares entertained an opinion
concerning ſome Articles
of faith, contrary to
the Orthodox and received
judgement of the Church;
and uttered many things againſt
the authoritie of the

Church of Rome, and the
univerſall Biſhop: I humblie
acknowledge my fault
and errour, and my folly in
miſleading others: I therefore
yeeld my ſelfe in all obedience
to the Supreme Biſhop,
into the boſome of the
Church of Rome; never to
depart again from the Traditions
and Decrees of the
holy See: I am heartily ſorry
for what is paſt; and I
humbly begge pardon forſo
great an offence.
            The Legate perceiving
Spira to faint, he purſues
him to the utmoſt; hee
cauſeth a recitation of all

his Errours to be drawne
in writing, together with
the Confeſsion annexed
to it, and commands Spira
to ſubſcribe his name
there, which accordingly
he did; then the Legate
commands him to return
to his owne Towne; and
there to declare this Confeſsion
of his, and to acknowledg
the whole Doctrine
of the Church of
Rome to be holy, and true;
and to abjure the Opinions
of Luther, and other
ſuch Teachers, as falſe,
&amp; hereticall: Man knowes
the beginnings of ſinne, but

who bounds the iſſues thereof?
Spira having once loſt
footing, goes downe amaine,
he cannot ſtay, nor
gaine-ſay the Legate; but
promiſeth to accompliſh
his whole will and pleaſure;
he ſoone addreſſeth
himſelfe for his Iourney,
and being onward in the
way, bethinks himſelfe
of large ſpoyles hee had
brought away from the
Conflict with the Legate:
what glorious teſtimony
hee had given of
his great faith, and conſtancie
in Chriſts cauſe:
and to be plaine, how impiouſly

hee had denyed
Chriſt, and his Goſpell at
Venice; and what he promiſed
to do further in his
owne Country; and thus
partly with feare, and
partly with ſhame being
confounded; he thought
he heard a voyce ſpeaking
unto him in this manner.
            
               Spira, What doſt thou
heere? whither goeſt thou?
haſt thou unhappy man, given
thy hand-writing to the
Legate at Venice; yet ſee
thou doſt not ſeale it in thine
owne Countrey: doſt thou
indeed thinke eternall life
ſo meane, as that thou preferreſt

this preſent life before
it? doſt thou well in preferring
wife and children
before Chriſt? is the windie
applauſe of the people, better
indeed then the glorie of
God; and the poſſeſſion of
this worlds good more deare
to thee, then the ſalvation
of thine owne Soule? is the
ſmall uſe of a moment of
time more deſireable, then
eternall wrath is dreadfull?
Thinke with thy ſelfe what
Chriſt endured for thy ſake;
is it not equall thou ſhouldeſt
ſuffer ſomewhat for him?
Remember, man, that the
ſufferings of this preſent

life, are not comparable to
the glorie that ſhall bee revealed:
if thou ſuffereſt
with him, thou ſhalt alſo
raigne with him: thou canſt
not anſwer for what thou
haſt alreadie done; nevertheleſſe,
the gate of mercie
is not quite ſhut, take heed
that thou heapeſt not ſinne
upon ſinne, leſt thou repent
when it will be too late.
            Now was Spira in a
wilderneſſe of doubts,
not knowing which way
to turne him, nor what to
doe, yet being arrived in
his owne Countrey, and
amongſt his friends, with

ſhame enough hee relates
what he had done, and
what he had further promiſed
to doe; and how
the terrors of God on the
one ſide, and the terrour
of this world on the other
ſide, did continually
racke him; and therefore
hee deſired of them adviſe
in this ſo doubtfull a
caſe: his friends upon
ſmall deliberation anſwered;
that it was requiſite
hee ſhould take heed
that hee did not in any
wiſe betray his wife and
children, and all his
friends into danger, ſeeing

that by ſo ſmal a matter
as the reciting of a
little Schedule, which
might bee done in leſſe
ſpace then half an houre,
he might both free himſelfe
from preſent danger,
and preſerve many that
depended upon him; adding
moreover, that hee
could get no Credit in relenting
from that which
he had already in greateſt
part performed before
the Legate at Venice, and
that in the perfect accompliſhing
thereof, little or
no diſcredit could ariſe,
more then what by the

former action already he
had ſuſtained: on the
other ſide, if hee did not
performe his promiſe
made to the Legate, hee
could neither diſcharge
himſelfe of the ſhame
which he had already incurred;
nor avoyd farre
more heavy and inſupportable
injuries, then
probably he ſhould have
endured, if hee had perſiſted
obſtinately in his
former Opinions.
            This was the laſt blow
of the battaile, and Spira
utterly overcome, goes to
the Praetor, and proffers

to performe his foreſaid
promiſe made to the Legate,
who in the meane
time had taken order to
have all things ready, and
had ſent the inſtrument
of abjuration ſigned by
Spira, to the Praetor, by
the hands of a certaine
Prieſt. All that night the
miſerable man ware out
with reſtleſſe cares, without
any minute of reſt;
the next morning being
come, he gets up, and being
ready, he deſperately
enters into the publique
Congregation, where
Maſſe being finiſhed, in

the preſence of friends
and enemies, and of the
whole Aſſembly; being
by eſtimation neere two
thouſand people; yea,
and of Heaven it ſelfe, he
recites that infamous abjuration,
word for word,
as it was written: it being
done, he was fined at
thirtie pieces of gold,
which he preſently paid:
five whereof were given
to the Prieſt that brought
the abjuration, the other
twentie five were imployed
towards the making
of a Shryne to put the
Euchariſt in; then was

he ſent home reſtored to
his Dignities; goods,
wife, and children: No
ſooner was hee departed,
but he thought hee heard
a direfull voyce, ſaying to
him; thou wicked wretch,
thou haſte denyed mee,
thou haſt renounced the covenant
of thy obedience,
thou haſt broken thy vow,
hence Apoſtate, beare with
thee the ſentence of thy eternall
damnation: hee trembling
and quaking in
body and mind, fell down
in a ſwoune; reliefe was
at hand for the body,
but from that time forwards,
he never found

any 
                  〈◊◊◊◊〉
               
minde▪ but 
                  〈◊◊◊〉
               
in uncessant torment 
                  〈◊◊〉
               
profeſſed that he was
captived under the revenging
hand of the great
God: that hee heard continually
that fearefull ſentence
of Chriſt that juſt
Iudge▪ that hee knew he
was utterly undone: that
he could neither hope for
grace, nor Chriſts interceſsiō
wth God the Father
in his behalfe: thus was
his fault ever heavy on his
heart, and ever his Iudgement
before his eyes.
            Now began his friends

ſome of them to repent
too late of their raſh
counſell; others not looking
ſo high as the Iudgement
of God, laid all the
blame upon his Melancholicke
conſtitution;
that overſhadowing his
judgment, wrought in
him a kinde of madneſſe:
every on cenſured as his
fancy led him, yet for remedy
all agreed in this,
to uſe both the wholeſome
helpe of Phyſicians,
and the pious adviſe of
Divines, and therefore
thought it meet to convey
him to Padua, an Vniverſitie

of note, where plenty
of all manner of meanes
was to be had: this they
accordingly did, both
with his wife, children,
and whole family; others
alſo of his friends accompanying
him: and being
arrived at the houſe of
one Iames Ardin, in Saint
Leonards, Pariſh, they
ſent for three Phyſicians
of moſt note, who upon
due obſervation of the
effects, &amp; of other Symptomes
of his diſeaſe, and
ſome private conference
one with another, among
themſelves, returned their

verdict in this manner,
viz. That they could not
diſcerne that his body
was afflicted with any
danger or diſtemper originally
from it ſelfe, by
reaſon of the over-ruling
of any humour; but that
this Maladie of his did ariſe
from ſome griefe, or
paſsion of his minde,
which being overburthened,
did ſo oppreſſe
the ſpirits, as they wanting
free paſſage, ſtirred
up many ill humours,
whereof the body of man
is full; &amp; theſe aſcending
up into the braine, troubled
the fancie; ſhadowed

the ſeat of the judgment,
and ſo corrupted it: this
was the ſtate of his diſeaſe,
and that outward
part that was viſible to
the eye of nature, this they
endeavoured to reforme
by purgation, either to
conſume, or at leaſt to divert
the courſe of thoſe
humors from the braine;
but all their skil effected
nothing, which Spira
noting, ſaid: Alas poore
men, how farre wide are you;
doe you thinke that this diſeaſe
is to be cured by potions;
beleeve mee there
muſt bee another manner of

medicine, it is neither potions,
plaiſters, nor drugs,
that can helpe a fainting
ſoule caſt downe with ſenſe of
ſinne, and the wrath of God;
it is onely Chriſt that muſt
bee the Phyſician, and the
Goſpel the ſole Antidote.
            
            The Phyſicians eaſily
beleeved him, after they
had underſtood the whol
truth of the matter, and
therfore they wiſhed him
to ſeeke ſome ſpirituall
comfort. By this time the
fame of this man was
ſpred over all Padua, and
the neighbour Countrey,
partly for that he was a

man of Eſteeme, partly
becauſe as the diſeaſe, ſo
the occaſion was eſpecially
remarkeable; for this
vvas not done in a corner:
ſo as daily there
came multitudes of all
ſorts to ſee him: ſome out
of curioſitie onely to ſee
and diſcourſe: ſome out
of a pious deſire to try all
meanes that might reduce
him to comfort againe, or
at leaſt to benefit themſelves,
by ſuch a ſpectacle
of miſery, and of the juſtice
of God. Amongſt
theſe, Paulus Vergerius
Biſhop of Iuſtinopolis, and

               Mattheus Gribauldus, deſerve
eſpecially to bee
named, as the moſt principall
labourers for this
mans comfort. They
finde him now about fiftie
years of age, neither
affected with the dotage
of old age, nor with the
unconſtant headſtrong
paſsion of youth, but in
the ſtrength of his experience
and judgment; in
a burning heat calling exceſsively
for drinke; yet
his underſtanding active,
quicke of apprehenſion,
wittie in diſcourſe above
his ordinary manner, and

judiciouſly oppoſite: his
friends laboured him by
all faire meanes to receive
ſome nouriſhment, which
he obſtinately gaine-ſaying,
they forcibly infuſed
ſome liquid ſuſtenance
into his mouth, moſt of
which he ſpit out againe;
exceedingly chafing, and
in this fretting mood of
his, ſaid: As it is true that
all things worke for the beſt
to thoſe that love God;
               Rom. 8. 28. ſo to
the wicked all are contrary:
for whereas a plentifull
off-ſpring is the bleſſing
of God, and his reward, being
a ſtay to the weak eſtate

of their aged parents; to me
they are a cauſe of bitterneſſe
and vexation; they doe
ſtrive to make mee tire out
this miſery; I would faine
be at an end; I deſerve not
this dealing at their hands;
O that I were gone from
hence, that ſome body would
let out this weary Soule.
            
            His friends ſaluted
him, and asked him, what
hee conceived to be the
cauſe of his diſeaſe; forthwith
he brake out into a
lamentable diſcourſe of
the paſſages formerly related,
&amp; that with ſuch
paſsionate Elocution, that

hee cauſed many to weep
&amp; moſt to tremble. They
contrarily to comfort
him, propounded many
of Gods promiſes recorded
in the Scripture; and
many examples of Gods
mercy: My ſinne (ſaid he)
is greater then the mercy of
God. Nay, anſwered they,
the mercy of God is above
all ſin; God would have
all men to be ſaved: It is
true (quoth he) hee would
have all that he hath elected,

                     •
                  bee ſ
                     •
                  aved; he would not
have damned reprobates to
be ſaved; I am one of that
number; I know it, for I

willingly, and againſt my
knowledge denied Chriſt;
and I feele that hee hardens,
and will not ſuffer me
to hope.
            
            
               After ſome ſilence, one
asked him whether hee
did not beleeve that Doctrine
(to bee true) for
which hee was accuſed
before the Legate; hee
anſwered; I did beleeve it
when I denied it, but now
I neither beleeve that, nor
the Doctrine of the Romane
Church; I beleeve
nothing, I have no faith, no
truſt, no hope; I am a Reprobate
like Cain, or Iudas,
               
who caſting away all hope of
mercy, fell into deſpaire; and
my friends doe mee great
wrong, that they ſuffer me not
to goe to the place of unbeleevers
as I juſtly deſerve.
            Heere they beganne
ſharpely to rebuke him;
requiring, and charging
him that in any wiſe hee
did not violate the mercy
of God; to which he anſwered:
The mercy of God
is exceeding large and extends
to all the elect; but
not to mee, or any like to
mee, who are ſealed up
to wrath:
               Rom. 2. 15. 
               I tell you I deſerve
it, my owne conſcience

condemnes me; what needeth
any other Iudge. Chriſt
came (ſaid they) to take
away ſinne, and calling
for a book, they read unto
him the paſsion of
Chriſt, and comming to
his nayling to the Croſſe,
Spira ſaid: This indeed is
comfortable to ſuch as are
elected, but as for me wretch,
they are nothing but griefe
and torment, becauſe I contemned
them. Thus roaring
for griefe, &amp; toſsing himſelf
up &amp; downe upon the
bed as he lay, he intreated
them to read no more: As
Gribauldus was comming

to ſee him, Vergerius ſaid
to Spira, deare Sir heere is
Doctor Gribauldus, a
godly and faithfull friend
of yours, come to ſee you:
He is welcome (ſaid he)
but hee ſhall find mee ill:
Gribauldus replyed, Sir,
this is but an illuſion of
the divell, who doth what
he can to vexe you; but
turne you to God with
your whole heart, and he
is ready to ſhew you mercy;
the earth you know is
full of his mercy; it is He
that hath ſaid,Pſ. 119. that as often
as a ſinner repents of his
ſinne, hee will remember his

ſinnes no more. Conſider
this in the example of Peter
that was Chriſts familiar,
and an Apoſtle;
and yet denied him thrice
with an oath, and yet God
was mercifull unto him:
conſider the theefe that
ſpent his whole life in
wickedneſſe, and for all
that, did not God graciouſly
reſpect him in the
laſt minute of his life? Is
the Lords hand now
ſhortned that it cannot
ſave? to this Spira anſwered;Luk. 27. 61.
               If Peter grieved
and repented, it was becauſe
Chriſt beheld him

with a mercifull eye;
and in that he was pardoned,
it was not becauſe
hee wept, but becauſe
God was gracious
to him: but God reſpects
not me, and therefore
I am a reprobate: I
feel no comfort can enter
into my heart, there
is no place there but
onely for torments and
vexings of ſpirit: I tell
you my caſe is properly
mine own; no man ever
was in the like plight,
and therefore my eſtate
is fearefull.
            
            Then roaring out in

the bitterneſſe of his ſpirit,
ſaid: It is a fearefull
thing to fall into the hands of
the living God: the violence
of his paſsion and
action ſutable, did amaze
many of the beholders;
inſomuch as ſome
of them ſaid with a whiſpering
voyce, that he was
poſſeſſed; hee over-hearing
it, ſaid: Doe you
doubt it? I have a whole
Legion of divels that take
up their dwellings within
mee, and poſſeſſe me as their
owne; and juſtly too, for I
have denyed Chriſt. Whether
did you that willingly

or not (ſaid they) That is
nothing to the purpoſe (ſaid
Spira) Chriſt ſaith, whoſoever
denies mee before men,
               Matt. 10. 33.
               him will I deny before my
Father which is in Heaven:
Chriſt will not bee denied,
no not in word; and therefore
it is enough, though in
heart I never denied him.
            
            They obſerving his diſtemper
to ariſe from the
ſenſe and horror of the
paines of hell, asked him
whether he thought there
were worſe paines then
what he endured for the
preſent; he ſaid, that he
knew there were far worſe

paines then thoſe that hee
then ſuffered:Pſal. 1. for the wicked
ſhall riſe to their judgement,
but they ſhall not ſtand
in Iudgement: this I tremble
to thinke of: yet doe I
deſire nothing more, then
that I might come to that
place, where I may bee ſure
to feele the worſt, and to be
freed from feare of worſe to
come.
            
            I but you are to conſider
(ſaid one) that thoſe
opinions for which you
were accuſed before the
Legate were impious;
and therefore you are not
to thinke you denied

Chriſt, but rather that
you confeſſed him, acknowledging
the infallible
truth of the Catholike
Church. Truly (ſaid he)
when I did denie thoſe opinions,
I did think them to be
true, &amp; yet I did deny them.
            
            Goe to (ſaid others)
now then beleeve that
they are not. Now I cannot
(ſaid hee) God will
not ſuffer mee to beleeve
them, nor truſt in his mercy:
What would you have
mee doe? I would faine
attaine to this power, but
cannot, though I ſhould preſently
be burnt for it. But

why doe you (ſaid the other)
eſteeme this ſo grievous
a ſinne, when as the
learned Legate conſtrained
you to it, which hee
ſurely would not have
done, if your former opinions
had not beene
Erroneous: no, good
Francis, the divell beſets
thee, let not therefore the
grievouſneſſe of thy ſin,
(if anie ſuch be) amaze
thee. You ſay right (replyed
he) the divell hath
poſſeſt mee, and God
hath left me to his power;
for I finde I can neither
beleeve the Goſpel,

nor truſt in Gods mercie;
I have ſinned againſt
the holy Ghoſt;
and God by his immutable
Decree, hath
bound mee over to perpetuall
puniſhment,
without anie hope of
pardon;Rom. 9. 11. and Rom. 4. It is true that
the greatneſſe of ſin, or
the multitude of them,
cannot bind Gods mercie:
all thoſe manie ſins
that in the former part
of my life I have committed,
then did not ſo
much trouble mee, for I
truſted that God would
not lay them to my

charge: but now having
ſinned againſt the
holy Ghoſt, God hath
taken away from me all
power of repentance, &amp;
now brings all my ſins
to remembrance,Iam. 2. 10. and
thus guiltie of one, guiltie
of all. And therefore
it is no matter whether
my ſinnes be great
or ſmall, few or many;
they are ſuch as Chriſt's
bloud, nor Gods mercie
belongs to mee:Rom. 9. 18. God
will have mercie on
whom hee will have
mercie; and whom he
will he hardneth; this is

it that gnaws my heart,
hee hath hardned mee;
and I finde that he daily
more and more doth
harden mee; and therefore
I am out of hope:
I feele it, and therefore
cannot but deſpaire: I
tell you, there was never
ſuch a monſter as I am;
never was man alive a
ſpectacle of ſo exceeding
miſery: I knew
that juſtification is to be
expected by Chriſt; and
I denied, and abjured
it; to the end I might
keepe this fraile life
from adverſitie, and

my children from povertie;
and now behold,
how bitter this
life is to mee; and God
only knowes, what
ſhall become of this my
family; but ſurely no
good is likely to betide
it, but rather daily
worſe and worſe; and
ſuch a ruin at the length
as that one ſtone ſhall
not be left on another.
            
            But why ſhould you
(ſaid Gribauldus) conceit
ſo deepely of your ſinne,
ſeeing you cannot but
know that manie have
denied Chriſt, yet never

fell into deſpaire? Well
(ſaid hee) I can ſee no
ground of comfort for
ſuch, neither can I warrant
them from Gods
revēging hand in wrath;
though it pleaſeth God
yet to ſuffer ſuch to bee
in peace: and beſides,
there will a time of
change come, and then
they ſhall be throughly
tryed: and if it were
not ſo, yet God is juſt
in making mee an Example
to others; and I
cannot juſtly complain:
there is no puniſhment
ſo great but I have deſerved

it, for this ſo
heinous offence: I aſſure
you it is no ſmall
matter to denie Chriſt;
and yet it is more ordinary
then commonly
men doe conceive of:
it is not a deniall made
before a Magiſtrate as it
is with mee; for as often
as a Chriſtian doth
diſſemble the knowne
truth, as often as hee
approves of falſe worſhip,
by preſenting himſelfe
at it, ſo often as
hee doth not things
worthy of his calling,
or ſuch things as are unworthy

of his calling:
ſo often hee denies
Chriſt: thus did I, and
therefore am juſtly puniſhed
for it.
            
            Your eſtate (quoth Gribauldus)
is not ſo ſtrange
as you make it; Iob was
ſo farre gone, that hee
complained God had ſet
him as a marke againſt
him: and David that was
a man after Gods owne
heart, complained often
that God had forſaken
him, and was become
his enemy; yet both received
comfort againe comfort
your ſelfe therefore,

God will come at length,
though hee now ſeeme
farre off.
            
               O Brother (anſwered
Spira) I beleeve all this;
the divels beleeve and
tremble; but David was
ever elected and dearely
beloved of God; and
though he fell, yet God
tooke not utterly away
his holy Spirit; and
therefore was heard
when he prayed, Lord
take not thy holy Spirit
from mee: but I am in
another caſe, being ever
accurſed from the preſence
of God: neither

can I pray as he did, becauſe
his holy Spirit is
quite gone, and cannot
be recalled; &amp; therefore
I know I ſhall live in
continuall hardneſſe ſo
long as I live: O that I
might feele but the leaſt
ſenſe of the love of God
to mee, though but for
one ſmall moment, as I
now feele his heavie
wrath that burnes like
the torments of hell
within mee, and afflicts
my Conſcience with
pangs unutterable; verily
deſperation is hell it
ſelfe.
            
            
               
Heere Gribauldus ſaid,
I doe verily beleeve, Spira,
that God having ſo ſeverely
chaſtiſed you in
this life, correcteth you in
mercie heere, that he may
ſpare you hereafter, and
that he hath mercies ſealed
up for you in time to
to come.
            Nay (ſaid Spira) hence
doe I know that I am a reprobate,
becauſe he afflicteth
mee with hardneſſe of heart:
Oh that my body had ſuffered
all my life long, ſo that hee
would bee pleaſed to releaſe
my ſoule, and eaſe my Conſcience,
this burthened Conſcience.
            
               
               Gribauldus being deſirous
to eaſe his minde
from the continuall meditation
of his ſinne; as
alſo to ſound how for the
preſent he ſtood affected
to the Romiſh Church;
asked him what hee
thought became of the
ſoules of men ſo ſoone as
they departed out of the
bodie, to which hee anſwered.
            Although this bee not ſo
fully revealed in Scripture;
yet I verily beleeve that the
ſoules of the Elect goe preſently
to the Kingdome of
glory; and not that ſleep with

the bodie as ſome doe imagine.
            Verie well; ſaid one of
the ſpectators, why doe
the Scriptures then ſay,
that God brings downe
to hell,1 Sam. 2. 6. and raiſeth up;
ſeeing it cannot be meant
of the eſtate of the ſoule
after death, which as thou
ſayeſt, either goeth to
heaven without change,
or to hell without redemption:
it muſt be underſtood
of the eſtate of
the ſoule in this life; like
that wherein thou art at
this preſent: and oftentimes
wee ſee that God

ſuffers men to fall into the
jawes of deſpaire, and yet
raiſeth them up again, and
therefore deſpaire not, but
hope; it ſhall bee even
thus with thee in his good
time.
            This is the worke, (quoth
Spira) this the labour; for
I tell you, when I at Venice
did firſt abjure my profeſsion,
and ſo, as it were, drew
an Indenture, the Spirit of
God often admoniſht mee;
and when at Cittadella, I
did, as it were, ſet to my
ſeale; the Spirit of God often
ſuggeſted to mee, Doe
not write Spira, do not ſeale;

yet I reſiſted the Holy
Ghoſt, and did both; and at
that very preſent I did evidently
feele a wound inflicted
in my very will, ſo although
I can ſay, I would beleeve;
yet can I not ſay I
will beleeve; God hath denied
mee the power of will;
and it befalls mee in this my
miſerable eſtate, as with one
that is faſt in irons, and his
friends comming to ſee him,
doe pitie his eſtate, and doe
perſwade him to ſhake off his
ſetters, and to come out of
his bonds; which God knows
hee would faine doe, but
cannot, this is my very caſe;

you perſwade me to beleeve:
how faine would I doe it, but
cannot? O now I cannot.
Then violently graſping
his hands together, and
raiſing himſelfe up: Behold
(ſaid he) I am ſtrong,
yet by little and little I decay
and conſume, and my ſervants
would faine preſerve
this weary life; but at length
the will of God muſt be done,
and I ſhall periſh miſerably
as I deſerve: rejoyce yee
righteous in the Lord;Pſal. 32. 11. bleſſed
are you whoſe hearts the
Lord hath mollified.
            
               Then after ſome pauſe;
It is wonderfull, I earneſtly

deſire to pray to God with
my heart, yet I cannot; I ſee
my damnation, and I know
my remedy is onlie in Chriſt,
yet I cannot ſet my ſelfe to
laie hold on it; ſuch are
the puniſhments of the damned;
they confeſſe what I
confeſſe, they repent of their
loſſe of heaven, they envie
the Elect, yet their repentance
doth them no good,
for they cannot mend their
waies.
            
               As he was thus ſpeaking,
hee obſerved divers
flies that came about him,
and ſome lighted on him:
Behold (ſaid hee) now

alſoSignifies the god of flies. Belzebub comes to
his banquet, you ſhall ſhortly
ſee my end, and in mee an
example to manie of the juſtice
&amp; judgement of God.
            About this time came
in two Biſhops with divers
Schollers of the
Vniverſity, one of them
being Paulus Vergerius,
having obſerved Spira
more then any other, beeing
continually converſant
with him, told him
his eſtate was ſuch, as rather
ſtood in need of Prayer
then advice; and therefore
deſired him to pray
with him in the Lords

Prayer; Spira conſented,
and he began.
            
               Our Father which art in
heaven,) then breaking
forth into teares, he ſtopped;
but they ſaid, it is
well, your griefe is a good
ſigne: I bewaile (ſaid
he) my miſerie, for I
perceive I am forſaken
of God, and cannot call
to him from my heart,
as I was wont to doe; yet
let us goe on, ſaid Vergerius.
            
            
               Thy Kingdome come;)
O Lord (ſaid Spira)
bring mee alſo into this
Kingdome; I beſeech

thee ſhut mee not out.
Then comming to thoſe
words; Give us this day
our daily bread; he added;
O Lord, I have enough
and abundance to feed
this carkeiſe of mine;
but there is another
bread, I humbly begge
the bread of thy grace;
without which, I know
I am but a dead man.
            
            
               Leade us not into temptation;)
ſeeing Lord
that I am brought into
temptation, helpe mee
Lord that I may eſcape;
the enemie hath overcome;
helpe mee, I beſeech

thee, to overcome
this cruell Tyrant.
            
            Theſe things hee ſpake
with a mournfull voyce,
the teares trickling down
abundantly; and expreſſing
ſuch affection and
paſsion, as turned the
bowels of thoſe there
preſent, with griefe and
compunction; they then
turning to Spira, ſaid:
You know that none can
call Chriſt Ieſus the Lord,
but by the Holie Ghoſt:
you muſt therefore think
of your ſelfe according to
that ſoft affection, which
you expreſſe in your

prayers, inferring thereby
that God hath not
wholly caſt you off; or
bereaved you of his Spirit
utterly.
            
               I perceive (ſaid Spira)
that I call on him to
my eternall damnation;
for I tell you againe, it is a
new and unheard of example
that you finde in me: If Iu,
das (ſaid they) had but
outlived his dayes, which
by nature hee might have
done; hee might have
repented, and Chriſt
would have received him
to mercie; and yet hee
ſinned moſt grievouſly

againſt his Maſter, which
did ſo eſteeme of him, as
to honour him with the
dignitie of an Apoſtle, and
did maintaine and feed
him: Hee anſwered,
Chriſt did alſo feed and
honour mee, neither yet
is my fault one jot leſſe
then that of his; becauſe
it is not more honour
to bee perſonally
preſent with Chriſt in
the fleſh, then to bee in
his preſence now by illumination
of his holy
Spirit: and beſides, I
denie that ever Iudas
could have repented,

how long ſoever he had
lived; for grace was
quite taken from him,
as it is now from mee.
            
            O Spira (ſaid they) you
know you are in a ſpirituall
deſertion; you muſt
therefore not beleeve what
Satan ſuggeſts; hee was
ever a lyar from the beginning,
and a meere Impoſtour,
and will caſt a
thouſand lying fancies into
your minde, to beguile
you withall; you muſt rather
beleeve thoſe whom
you judge to be in a good
eſtate, and more able to
diſcerne of you then your

ſelfe; beleeve us, and wee
tell you, that God will be
mercifull unto you.
            O here is the knot (ſaid
Spira) I would I could beleeve;
But I cannot.
            Then he began to reckon
up what fearefull
dreames and viſions, hee
was continually troubled
withall; that hee
ſaw the divels come flocking
into his Chamber,
and about his bed, terrifying
him with ſtrange
noiſes; that theſe were
not fancies, but that hee
ſaw them as really as
the ſtanders by; and that

beſides theſe outward
terrours, hee felt continually,
a racking torture of
his minde, and a continuall
butchery of his conſcience,
being the very proper
pangs of the damned
wights in hell.
            Caſt theſe fancies (ſaid
Gribauldus) theſe are but
illuſions, humble your
ſelfe in the preſence of
God, and praiſe him.
            
               The dead praiſe not
the Lord (anſwered he)
nor they that goe down
into the pit:Pſal. 6. 5. wee that
are drowned in deſpaire,
are dead and

are already gone downe
into the pit: what hell
can there be worſe then
deſperation; or what
greater puniſhment? the
gnawing worme, unquenchable
fire, horrour;
confuſion, and
(which is worſe then
all) deſperation it ſelfe
continually tortures me;
and now I count my
preſent eſtate worſe
then if my ſoule (ſeparated
from my body)
were with Iudas and
the reſt of the damned;
and therefore, I now
deſire rather to be there,

then thus to live in the
body.
            
            One being preſent, repeated
certaine words out
of the Pſalmes:
               Pſal. 89. 30. If thy
children forſake my law
and walk not in my judgments;
I will viſite their
tranſgreſsions with rods,
and their iniquities with
ſtripes; nevertheleſſe my
loving kindneſſe I will
not utterly take from
them, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſſe
to faile: Marke
this, O Spira, my Covenant
I will not breake.
            Theſe promiſes (ſaid
Spira) belong onely to the

elect, which if tempted, may
fall into ſin, but are againe
lifted up and recovered out:
as the Prophet ſaith, though
he fall, he ſhall not be utterly
caſt downe, for the Lord
uphouldeth him: Therefore
Peter could riſe, for he was
Elected, but the reprobate
when they fall cannot riſe againe,
as appeares in Cain,
Saule, and Iudas: God
deales one way with the
Elect, and another way with
Reprobates.
            The next day hee prayed
with them in the Latine
tongue, and that with
excellent affection, as outwardly

appeared, bleſſed
bee God (ſaid Vergerius)
theſe are no ſignes of eternall
reprobation: you
muſt not O Spira, ſeeke
out the ſecret counſels of
Gods election and reprobation,
for no man
can know ſo long as hee
lives, whether by his
good or bad deeds, hee
bee worthy of Gods love
or anger:Eccleſ. 9. 1. Pſal. 88. 14. doe you not
know that the Prophet
David complained, that
God had caſt off his
Soule.
            
               I know all this (quoth
Spira) I know the mercies

of God are infinite, and doe
ſurpaſſe the ſinnes of the
whole world, and that they
are effectuall to all that beleeve,
but this faith, and this
hope, is the gift of God; O
that hee would give it mee;
but it is as impoſſible as to
drinke up the Sea at a
draught: as for that of Solomon,
if hee had ever tried
that which I feele by woefull
experience; hee would
never have ſpoken as he did;
but the truth is, never had
mortall man, ſuch an evident
experience of Gods anger
and hatred againſt him,
as I have; you that are in a

good eſtate, thinke repentance
and faith to be workes
of great facilitie, and therefore
you thinke it an eaſie
matter to perſwade a man to
beleeve; the whole need not
the Phyſician; and hee that
is well, can ſoone give counſell
to ſuch as are ill; but this
is the hell to mee, my heart is
hardned, I cannot beleeve;
many are called, but few are
choſen.
            Vpon what grounds
(ſaid they) doe you conceive
ſo ill an opinion of
your ſelfe?
            
               I once did know God
to bee my Father, not

onely by creation; but
by regeneration, I knew
him by his beloved
Sonne, the authour and
finiſher of our Salvation;
I could pray to him,
and hope for pardon of
ſinnes from him; I had
a taſte of his ſweetneſſe,
peace, and comfort:
now contrarily,
I know God not as a
Father but as an enemy;
what more? my heart
hates God, and ſeekes to
get above him: I have
nothing elſe to flie to
but terrour &amp; deſpaire.
            
            Belike you thinke then

(ſaid they) that thoſe
who have the earneſt and
firſt fruits of Gods Spirit,
may notwithſtanding fall
away?
            
               The judgements of
God are a deepe abiſſe,
(ſaid he) wee are ſoone
drowned if we enter into
them; he that thinks
he ſtandeth, let him take
heed leſt hee fall: as for
my ſelfe, I know I am
falne backe; and that
I once did know the
truth; though it may
be not ſo throughly: I
know not what elſe to
ſay, but that I am one of

that number, which
God hath threatned to
teare in pieces.
            
            Say not ſo (anſwered
they) for God may come,
though at the laſt houre;
keepe hold therefore, at
the leaſt by hope.
            
               This (quoth he) is my
caſe I tell you I cannot,
God hath deprived mee
of hope; this brings terror
to my minde, and
pines this hodie which
now is ſo weake, as it
cannot performe the ſeverall
offices thereof:Rom. 8. 16.
for as the Elect have the
Spirit teſtifying that

they are the ſonnes of
God, ſo the Reprobates
even while they live, do
often feele a worme in
their conſcience, whereby
they are condemned
already, and therefore
as ſoone as I perceived
this wound inflicted on
my minde and will, I
I knew that I wanted
the gifts of ſaving grace,
and that I was utterly
undone;1 Cor. 11. 33. God chaſteneth
his children with temporarie
afflictions,Rom. 1. 28. that
they may come as gold
out of the fire; but pupuniſheth
the wicked

with blindneſſe in their
underſtandings, &amp; hardneſſe
of heart; and woe
be to ſuch, from whom
God takes his holie Spirit.
            
            Here one rebuked him,
and told him, he gave too
much credit to ſence, that
hee was not to beleeve
himſelfe, but rather him
that was in a good eſtate,
and I teſtifie to you (ſaid
he) that God will be mercifull
to you.
            Nay (anſwered he) for
becauſe I am in this ill eſtate;
therfore can I beleeve
nothing but what is contrarie

to my ſalvation and comfort;
but you that are ſo confident
of your good ſtate, looke that
it bee true, for it is no ſuch
ſmall matter to be aſſured of
ſinceritie: a man had need
bee exceeding ſtronglie
grounded in the Truth, before
hee can bee able to affirme
ſuch a matter as you
now doe; it is not the performance
of a few outward
duties, but a mightie conſtant
labour, with all intention
of heart and affection;
with full deſire and endeavour,
continually to ſet forth
Gods glorie; there muſt bee
neither feare of Legates,

Inquiſitors, Priſons, nor
anie death whatſoever; manie
thinke themſelves happie
that are not; it is not every
one that ſaith, Lord,
Lord; that ſhall goe to
heaven.
            They came another day
and found him with his
eyes ſhut, as if hee had
beene drowzie, and verie
loath to diſcourſe; at
which time there came in
alſo a grave man from
Cittadella; who demanded
of Spira, if hee knew
him,Matth. 7. 22. or not; he lifting up
his eye-lids and not ſuddenly
remembring him,

the man ſaid to him; I
am Presbiter Antonie
Fontanina; I was with
you at Venice, ſome 8.
weeks ſince: O curſed
day (ſayd Spira) O
curſed day: O that I
had never gone thither,
would God I
had then died.
            
            Afterwards came in a
Prieſt called Bernardinus
Sardoneus: bringing
with him a booke of
Exorciſmes, to conjure
this divell: whom when
Spira ſaw, ſhaking his
head he ſaid:
            
               I am verily perſwaded

indeed, that God
hath left mee to the
power of the divells:
but ſuch they are, as
are not to be found in
your Letanie: neither
will they be caſt out by
ſpels: The Prieſt proceeding
in his intended
purpoſe; with a ſtrange
uncouth geſture, and a
loud voice, adjured the
Spirit to come into Spira's
tongue, and to anſwer:
Spira deriding his
fruitleſſe labour, with a
ſigh turned from him.
A Biſhop being there
preſent, ſaid to Spira,
               
brother God hath put
vertue into the Word
and Sacraments: and
wee have uſed the one
means, and find not that
effect which we deſire:
ſhall we trie the efficacie
of the Sacraments, ſurely
if you take it as a true
Chriſtian ought to receive,
the body and
bloud of Chriſt, it will
proove a ſoveraigne medicine
for your ſicke
ſoule.
            
               This I cannot do
(anſwered hee) for
they that have no right
to the promiſes, have

no right to the ſeales:
the Euchariſt was appointed
onely for beleevers:
if wee have
not faith, we eate and
drinke judgement to
our ſelves:1 Cor. 11. 29. I received
it about a moneth
ſince, but I did not
well in ſo doing, for
I tooke it by conſtraint,
and ſo I tooke
it to my deeper condemnation.
            
            Here Vergerius began
to importune him earneſtly
to beware, that
he did not wilfully reſiſt
grace, &amp; put himſelf out

of haven: charging him
vehemently, by all the
love that was betweene
them: by the love which
hee bare to his children,
yea to his owne
ſoule: that he would ſet
himſelfe ſeriouſly, to returne
to that faith and
hope, which once hee
had in the death of
Chriſt, with many ſuch
like words: Spira having
heard much of the
like matter formerlie:
&amp; being ſomewhat moved,
ſaid, You do but
repeat Vergerius, what
ſhould I hope? why

ſhould I beleeve? God
hath taken faith from
mee: ſhew mee then
whither I ſhall goe:
ſhew mee a haven
whereto I ſhall retire:
you tell mee of Gods
mercy, when as God
hath caſt mee off: you
tell mee of Chriſts interceſsion,
I have denied
him: you command
mee to beleeve,
I ſay I cannot: you
bring mee no comfort:
your command
is as impoſsible for
me to obey, as to keep
the Morall Law: if

you ſhould perſwade
one to love God, with
all his heart, ſoule and
ſtrength; and God
gives him not the
power, can he performe
your deſire?
doth not the church
teach us to ſing; direct
us, O Lord, to love thy
commandements: hypocrites
ſay that they
love God with all
their heart, but they
lye: for my part, I will
not lye, but tell you
plainely; ſuch is my
caſe, that though you
ſhould never ſo much

much importune mee
to hope or beleeve,
though I deſire it, yet
I cannot: for God (as
a puniſhment of my
wickedneſſe) hath taken
away from me all
his ſaving graces;
faith, hope, and all:
I am not the man
therefore that you take
mee for: belike you
thinke I delight in
this eſtate; if I could
conceive but the leaſt
ſparke of hope of a
better eſtate hereafter,
I would not refuſe
to endure the

moſt heavie weight
of the wrath of that
great God; yea, for
twenty thouſand years,
ſo that I might at
length attaine to the
end of that miſery,
which I now know
will bee eternall; but
I tell you, my will
is wounded: who
longs more to beleeve
then I doe? but
all the ground-worke
of my hope is quite
gone; for if the teſtimonies
of holy
Scripture bee true (as
they are moſt certainly

true) is not this as
true: whoſoever denies
mee before men,
him (ſaith Chriſt) will
I denie before my Father
which is in heaven?
is not this properly
my caſe, as if it had
purpoſely beene intended
againſt this very
perſon of mine? &amp;
I pray you, what ſhall
become of ſuch as
Chriſt denieth; ſeeing
there is no other
Name under heaven,
whereby you looke to
bee ſaved? what ſaith
Saint Paul to the

                  Hebrewes?
                  Heb. 6. It is impoſsible
for thoſe who
were once enlightned,
and have taſted of the
heavenly gift, &amp; were
made partakers of the
Holie Ghoſt, if they
fall away, to be renued
to repentance: what
can be more plaine againſt
me? Is not that
Scripture alſo; if wee
ſinne wilfully after
wee have received the
Knowledge of the
truth,and 10. 26. there remaineth
no more ſacrifice for
ſinne; but a certaine
looking for of judgement:

the Scripture
ſpeakes of mee, Saint
Paul means me, S.
Peter tels me,Pet. 2. 21. it had
been better I had not
knowne the way of
Righteouſneſſe, then
after I have knowne,
to turne from the holy
commandement: if it
had beene better I had
not known, and yet
then my condemnation
had beene moſt
certaine: doe you not
ſee evidently, that I
have wilfully denied
the known truth;
may juſtly expect not

onely damnation, but
worſe, if worſe may
be imagined: God
will have mee undergoe
the juſt puniſhment
of my ſinne, and
make mee an example
of his wrath for your
ſakes.
            
            
               The company preſent,
admired his diſcourſe,
ſo grievouſly accuſing
himſelfe of his
fore-paſt life; ſo gravely
and wiſely dilating, concerning
the judgements
of God, that they then
were convinced, that
it was not frenzie or

madneſſe, that had poſſeſſed
him: and being
as it were, in admiration
of his eſtate, Spira
proceeded againe in this
manner, Take heed to
your ſelves, it is no light or
eaſie matter to bee a Chriſtian;
it is not baptiſme,
or reading of the Scriptures,
or boaſting of faith
in Chriſt (though even
theſe are good) that can
proove one to be an abſolute
Chriſtian: you know
what I ſaid before, there
muſt be a conformity in
life; a Chriſtian muſt bee
ſtrong, unconquerable,

not carrying an obſcure
profeſſion, but reſolute;
expreſſing the image of
Chriſt, and holding out
againſt all oppoſition to
the laſt breath: hee muſt
give all diligence by righteouſneſſe,
and holineſſe, to
make his calling and election
ſure; many there are
that ſnatch at the promiſes
in the Goſpel, as if they
undoubtedly did belong to
them, and yet they remaine
ſluggiſh, and careleſſe,
and beeing flattered by
the things of this preſent
world, they paſſe in their
courſe in quietneſſe and

ſecuritie, as if they were the
onely happie men; whom
nevertheleſſe the Lord in
his providence hath ordained
to eternall wrath; as
you may ſee in S. Lukes
rich man,Luk. 16. thus it was with
mee, therefore take heed.
            Then came one of his
Nephews and offered
him ſome ſuſtenance,
which he diſdainfully
refuſing, ſo moved the
youngmans choler, that
hee charged him with
hypocriſie and diſsimulation,
or frenzie; to
whom Spira gravely anſwering,
ſaid:
            
               
You may interpret the
matter as you will; but I am
ſure, I am not only the Actor,
but the argument, and
matter of the Tragedy;
I would it were frenzie,
either fained or true; for
if it were fained, I could
put it off at pleaſure; if
it were a reall frenzy, yet
there were ſome hope left
of Gods mercie, whereas
now there is none; for I
know that God hath pronounced
mee an enemie,
and guiltie of high Treaſon
againſt his Majeſtie;
I am a caſt-away, a vaſſaile
of wrath: yet dare

you call it diſſembling and
frenzie; and can mocke
at the formidable example
of the heavie wrath of
God, that ſhould teach you
feare and terrour; but it
is naturall to the fleſh, either
out of malice or ignorance,
to ſpeake perverſly
of the workes of God, the
naturall man diſcerneth
not of the things that are
of God, becauſe they are
ſpiritually diſcerned.
            How can this be (ſaid
Gribauldus) that you can
thus excellently diſcourſe
of the judgements
of God, and of

the graces of his holie
Spirit, that you finde the
want of them, and earneſtly
deſire them; and
yet you thinke you
are utterly deprived of
them.
            Take this for certaine
(ſaid hee) I want the
maine grace of all, and
that which is abſolutely neceſſarie;
and God doth many
times extort moſt true
and ſtrange teſtimonies of
his Majeſties juſtice and
mercie; yea out of the
mouthes of verie reprobates,
for even Iudas, after
hee had betrayed his

Maſter,Mat. 27. 4. was conſtrained
to confeſſe his ſinne, and
to juſtifie the innocencie
of Chriſt; and therefore
if I doe the like, it is no
new or ſtrange matter:
God hath taken faith from
mee, and left mee other
common gifts, for my deeper
condemnation; by how
much the more I remember
what I had, and heare
others diſcourſe of what
they have, by ſo much the
more is my torment, in that
I know what I want, and
how there is no way to bee
relieved.
            Thus ſpake hee, the

teares all the while
trickling downe; profeſsing
that his pangs
were ſuch, as that the
damned wights in hell
endure not the like miſerie;
that his eſtate was
worſe, then that of Cain
or Iudas; and therefore
hee deſired to die: yet
behold (ſaith hee) the
Scriptures are accompliſhed
in mee;
               Rev. 9. 6. 
               they ſhall deſire
to die, and death ſhall flie
from them; and verily,
hee ſeemed exceedingly
to feare, leſt his life
ſhould bee drawne out
to a longer thread: and

finding no eaſe, or reſt,
ever and anone cried
out: O miſerable wretch;
O miſerable wretch; then
turning to the Company;
hee beſought
them in this manner.
            O Brethren, take a diligent
heed to your life;
make more account of the
gifts of Gods ſpirit then I
have done, learne to beware
my miſery, thinke not
you are aſſured Chriſtians,
becauſe you underſtand
ſomething of the Goſpel;
take heed you grow not
ſecure on that ground; be
conſtant and immoveable

in the maintaining of your
profeſſion, confeſſe even
untill death if you be called
thereto: he that loveth
father,Luk. 14. 26. mother, brothers,
ſiſters, ſons, daughters,
kindred, houſes, lands,
more then Chriſt, is not
worthie of him.
            Theſe words (ſaid
they) doe not ſound like
the words of a wicked
Reprobate.
            I doe but herein imitate
(ſaid Spira) the rich
Glutton in the Goſpel, who
though in hell; yet was
carefull that his brethren
ſhould not come to that

place of torment: and I
ſay to you Brethren, take
heed of this miſerable eſtate
wherein I am.
            Then turning himſelfe
to certaine young
men that were preſent,
hee deſired them to conceive
him aright: I
doe not ſpeak this, to
derogate from the certaintie
of ſaving faith,
and the promiſes of
the Goſpel, for they
are moſt ſure; but
take heed of relying
on that Faith that
works not a holy and
unblameable life, worthy

of a beleever;
credit mee, it will
faile, I have tried it:
I preſumed I had gotten
the right faith, I
preached it to others,
I had all places of
Scripture in memorie,
that might ſupport it:
I thought my ſelfe
ſure, and in the meane
time, living impiouſly
and careleſly, behold,
now the judgements
of God have overtaken
mee, not to
correction, but to condemnation;
and now
you would have mee

to beleeve, but it will
not bee; for I feele
too late; that good
things belong onely
to ſuch as are good;
whoſe ſinnes are covered
with Chriſts
death and bloud, as
with a vaile, and
guarded with his righteous
merits from the
floud of Gods warth,
even as with a mightie
wall; left miſerable
mortals ſhould bee
ſwallowed up with
the greatneſſe of their
ſinnes: But as for
mee, I have as it were

wilfully with mine
hands pulled downe
this rampire; behind
which I might have
reſted in ſafetie; and
now are the ſwelling
waters come even to
my ſoule: and I am
caſt away.
            
            One of his familiar
friends chanced to ſay,
that certainly he was overcome
with melancholy;
which being overheard,
Spira anſwered:
            
               Well, bee it ſo, ſeeing
you will needs
have it ſo; for thus

alſo is Gods wrath
manifeſted againſt me
in that hee hath taken
from mee the uſe of
mine underſtanding
and reaſon, ſo as I
can neither rightly eſteeme
and judge of
my diſtemper, nor
hope of remedie: you
ſee Brethren, what a
dangerous thing it is,
to ſtoppe or ſtay in
things that concerne
Gods glorie: eſpecially
to diſſemble upon
anie termes: what a
fearefull thing is it to
be neare, and almoſt a

Chriſtian; never was
the like example to
this of mine: and
therefore if you bee
wiſe, you will ſeriouſly
conſider therof;
Oh that God would
let looſe his hand from
me; that it were with
me now, as in times
paſt; I would ſcorn the
threats of the moſt
cruell Tyrants, beare
torments with invincible
reſolution, and
glorie in the outward
profeſsion of Chriſt,
till I were choked in
the flame, and my

body conſumed to aſhes.
            
            You ſay you are deſperate,
O Spira (ſaid
they) why then doe you
not ſtrive with ſome
weapon or other, violently
to make an end of
your life, as deſperate
men uſe to doe? Let mee
have a ſword (ſayd Spira)
why what would
you doe with it (quoth
they) I cannot tell you
(ſaid hee) what this
minde would move me to
upon occaſion; nor what I
would doe.
            
            They perceiving ſmal

effect of all this their labour;
but rather that he
grew worſe: for the avoiding
of concourſe of
people; for everie day
ſeldome fewer then 20▪
continued with him, &amp;
to ſtop the courſe of
fame, which was continually
blowne abroad
of him; they conſult to
carry him backe againe
into his owne countrey:
and thoſe his
friends that came to
comfort him, began to
take their leaves of him:
Vergerius among the reſt,
required that at their

parting they might pray
together with him: Spira
hardly conſented,
and as unwillingly performed:
for hee ſaid,
My heart is eſtranged
from God, I cannot
call him Father from
my heart; all good
motions are now quite
gone, my heart is full
of malediction, hatred,
and blaſphemy
againſt God; I finde I
grow more and more
hardned in heart, and
cannot ſtoope nor
helpe my ſelfe; your
prayers for mee ſhall

turne to your owne
benefit, they can doe
mee no good.
            
            
               Vergerius came to
take his leave of him,
whom Spira embracing,
ſaid, Although I know
that nothing can bring
any benefit to mee a
Reprobate; but that
every thing ſhall tend
to my deeper condemnation;
yet I give you
moſt hearty thankes,
for your kinde office
of love and good will;
and the Lord returne
it unto you with a

plentifull increaſe of
all good.
            
            The next day being
brought downe to his
intended Iourney, by
the way looking round
about him with a ghaſtly
looke, he ſaw a knife
lying on a Table, to
which he running haſtily
ſnatched hold of; as
intending to miſchiefe
himſelfe; but his friends
laying hold of him,
ſtopped him in his purpoſe:
whereupon with
indignation, hee ſaid,
I would I were, above

God, for I know hee
will have no mercy
on me.
            
            Thus went he homewards,
often ſaying,
that the envied the condition
of Cain and Iudas:
hee lay about 8. weekes
in this caſe, in a continuall
burning, neither deſiring,
nor receiving any
thing but by force,
and that without diſgeſtion:
ſo ſpent, that
hee appeared a perfect
Anatomie; expreſsing
to the view, nothing
but ſinewes and bones;

vehemently raging for
drinke; ever pining, yet
fearefull to live long;
dreadfull of hell, yet coveting
death; in a continuall
torment, yet his
own tormentour: and
thus conſuming himſelfe
with griefe and
horrour, impatience, &amp;
deſpaire; like a living
man in Hell; hee repreſented
an extraordinary
example of the juſtice
and power of God: and
thus (as farre as appeareth)
within a few dayes
after his arrivall at his

owne home, he departed
this preſent life. Yet
an occaſion to make us
remember, that ſecret
things belong unto the
Lord our God; but charitie
to man, to teach
him to hope all things.
            
               
EXtraordinary examples
of Divine Iuſtice,
God never intended
for a nine dayes
wonder: elſe would hee
when hee exemplifi'd
Lots wife have turned
her into a ſtatue of melting
ſnow, not of laſting
ſalt; which ſtood as
Ioſephus tells us, till his
age, after the deſtruction
of Ieruſalem: and as
ſome Travellers report,
till at this day: ut quoddam

hominibus praeſtaret
condimentum quo ſapiant
unde illud caveatur exemplum;
Aug. de. civit.
Dei. lib. 16. c. 30. for a
ſeaſon againſt corruption,
a preſervative againſt
Apoſtacie. This
Tragedy, when freſh
and new, was the converſion
and confirmation
of ſundry Worthies:
Vergerius a daily
ſpectator thereof, forſaking
a rich Biſhopricke
of Iuſtinopolis, and tents
of Antichriſt; went
to Baſil, and dyed a

worthy Proteſtant: many
Nations had Eyewitneſſes
of their owne
Students, then in the
Vniverſitie of Padua
who penned the Story,
the Copies wherof are
frequently revived: our
Engliſh ones were very
defective, and now
worne out of ſhoppes
and hands, ſundry manuſcripts
of this abroad
imperfect; which moved
mee to compare this
labour of a worthy
Gentleman (who faithfully
tranſlated it out of

               Italian, French, and
Dutch Letters) with the
Latine of Caelius Secundus,
Curio, Mattheus Gribauldus,
profeſſors of
the Civill Law in Padua:
Sigiſmund Gelous a
Tranſilvanian, Henricus
Scotus, all daily viſitors
of Spira, and finde it accord
with them. Touching
Spiraes perſon, I
finde (moſt learned writers)
to incline to the
right, and hopefull
hand: moved by his
ſweet, humble, and charitable
ſpeeches: ſome
few deſperate ones excepted,

that fell from
him in ſome little agonies,
which kept him
faſting and watching about
ſix moneths ſpace,
eating nothing but what
was forced downe his
throat. The ſum of Calvins
and Borrhaus their
their counſels (who
writ largely of the uſe
of this pattern) is that all
learne to take heed of
backe-ſliding, which
Gods ſoule abhorres;
and not to dally with
Conſcience, and hell on
earth, if juſtly incenſed;
more to be feared

then the Spaniſh Inquiſition,
or all the Strappadoes
and torments in
the world; and to take
heed of Spira's principall
Errors; which were
to diſpute with Satan
over buſily in time of
weakeneſſe: eſpecially
to reaſon, and conclude
from preſent
ſenſe: to Gods paſt
Reprobation, and future
Damnation: both
which is hard, if poſſible
for any man to
determine in his owne,
much more in others
caſes: ſo commending

thee to his grace who is
able to eſtabliſh thee to
the end: I bid thee farewell,
and hope well,
while the ſpace of Grace
laſteth, Dum ſpiras ſpera:
ſo mayeſt thou take
good and no hurt, by
the reading of this terrible
example.
