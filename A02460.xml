            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            A SERMON PREACHED AT NEVVPORT-PAIGNELL in the Countie of Buckingham. By R. H.
            2. COR. 5. 20, 21.
            
               Now then are wee ambaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you through vs, wee pray you in Chriſts ſteed, that yee bee reconciled vnto God:
               For he hath made him to be ſinne for vs, which knew no ſinne: that wee ſhould bee made the righteouſnes of God in him.
            
            LONDON. Printed for Robert Wilſon, and are to be ſold at his Shop at Grayes-Inne new Gate in Holborne. 1628.
         
         
            
            
            To the right worſhipfull, M. Iohn Tompſon Eſquier, one of her Maiesties auditors in the Eſchequer, and iuſtice of Peace and Quorum in her Maieſties ſhires of Buck. and Bedf. all increaſe of worſhip with all ſpirituall good.
            
            
               WHereas (worſhipfull Sir) God hath giuen you, not onely by your counſel to further, but alſo by your good enſample to prouoke, many careleſſe people to the hearing of the word: we cannot but reuerence this grace in you, and wiſh it many waies multiplied for our coū
               tries good. For when prophanes hath ſo poiſoned the harts of many, that they aske who is the Lord that they ſhould heare his voice, &amp; the world hath ſo ſwetned other, that they doe run to it, when they ſhould poſte to God. In vayne were our labours, except God ſtirred vp the hartes of ſome, which might be leaders to the people, to bring them into the houſe of God. And although at the firſt many more ſauage then this beaſt, are hayled perforce into the Arke, and come vnwilling, like ſuch which

are muffled and would not be touched of the ſunne: yet when through Gods mercie they ſhall ſee all drowned which are without, &amp; ſhal taſte of ſome of that grace God giueth vnto his; they will not a foote from the dore of his tabernacle but as mē whom the zeale of the Lords houſe hath eaten, they ſhall fall downe and worſhip confeſſing that the Lord is God. In regard wherof be not weary of well doing, but ſtirre vp the grace God hath giuen you, and know that God hath made you, not onely for your ſelfe, and for your houſhold: but alſo for the good of other. In the view of which your goodnes as I much doe ioy, ſo in lew of duety with all deſire of your farther good, I haue emboldned my ſelfe, to offer to your Worſhip this ſmall treaty of that great peace and reconciliation wee haue with God. The which, although now long fithence, in a great aſſembly, it hath beene moſt grauely handled by that bleſſed man of reuerend memory Iohn Foxe. Yet ſince our courſe is diuers as the learned may iudge, to ſatisfie other rather then my ſelfe, I haue ſuffered this although vnwilling to be drawne into the light. Thus commending it to Gods bleſsing and your Chriſtian fauours, my prayer is vnto this God

of peace, that he would giue vs peace with him and with our ſelues, that wee may ioy in this couenaunt of peace, witneſſed in his worde, and aſſured our heartes by the earneſt of his ſpirit, Amen. 
            
               From North Crowly, Maiij primo.
                
               Your worſhips in all dutie, Roger Hacket.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
            A Sermon preached at Newport Paignell in the countie of Buckes. taken out of the 2. Cor. 5. ver. 20.21.
            
            
               
                  Now then are wee ambaſſadors for Chriſt,2. Cor. 5. ver. 20. &amp; 21. as though God did beſeech you through vs, we pray you in Chriſt ſteed, that ye be reconciled vnto God:
                  For he hath made him to be ſinne for vs, which knew no ſinne: that we ſhould be made the righteouſnes of God in him.
               
            
            
               AS many Scriptures thorough the body of the Bible, doe moſte plainly lay forth, the worke, I ſhould ſay wonder, of our redemption &amp; reconciliation with God the father: ſo there is nothing, wherein a Chriſtian ſoule ſhould rather ſeeke to ſolace her ſelfe, then in the ſweet meditation of this moſt heauenly doctrine, by which ſhe may ſee that God is now reconciled vnto her, and that ſhee may through Chriſt merite, haue acceſſe with boldneſſe vnto the throne of grace, for as this maketh a mans heart to melt, &amp; his knees for feare to beate together, to conſider that God is his enemy, and that he will call him to

iudgement for al his ſinnes: ſo this filleth the hart with ioy and bones with gladneſſe, to record that God hath put away his ſinnes, and in great fauour hath reſpect vnto him for his good. In regard whereof it ſtandeth vs in hand that our heartes may be ſilled with this ſweetnes, and our ſoules haue their parte in this moſt heauenly ſolace, attentiuely to conſider the Apoſtle in this place. In the vnfolding of whoſe wordes, my purpoſe is, firſt briefly to lay downe his meaning, and then more amply to ſtand on thoſe points, which make for reconciliation betweene God and man.
            
               Now then are wee embaſſadors for Christ: as if the Apoſtle would ſay now then we come not of our owne heads, without lawfull warrant, for God hath put this word of reconcilement into our mouthes, he hath ſent vs in embaſſage vnto you, and giuen vs in commiſſion thus to ſpeake: Wherefore for Chriſt ſake if you will doe any thing for him we pray you, nay Chriſt praieth you, for his place now we do ſupply, and not only he but God in vs, and by vs praieth and beſeecheth that you would be reconciled vnto him. If you deſire his friendſhip, but yet feare his preſence becauſe of your ſinnes; beholde his mercie, he will not impute vnto you your ſins, but vnto you they ſhall be as though they had neuer beene. If

yet you doubt how this may be, ſince that you know that God is iuſte and puniſheth ſinne whereſoeuer he findeth it; looke on your ſauiour, &amp; that which God in mercy pardoneth in you, he puniſheth with all iuſtice in his ſonne. For he which was moſt innocent and knew no ſinne, hath your ſinnes imputed vnto him, and not onely imputed, but he is made ſinne for you, that is a ſacrifice for your ſins. Thus the chaſtiſement of your peace is layed on his ſhoulders, and for your ſins hee hath ſuffered, an hell of torments in his moſt bleſſed ſoule &amp; bodie. If yet you dare not preſume his preſence, becauſe you want your wedding garments: conſider, that he was therefore made ſinne for you, that you ſhould be made, (you cannot make your ſelues) not the righteouſnes of man which is inherent in you, but the righteouſnes of God which is imputed to you. And to make all without doubt you are made this righteouſnes of God, not in your ſelues, but in him, euen in Chriſt Ieſu, which for your ſake hath ſanctified himſelfe, and fulfilled all righteouſnes for you, ſo that as your ſinnes were not inherent in him, but in your ſelues; yet ſo imputed to him, as though they were his: ſo this righteouſnes, by which you are reputed righteous before your maker, is not inherent in you but in him, yet as if it were

yours, through Gods great mercy it is imputed vnto you. Wherefore now let euery good Chriſtian, in a good aſſurance of hope, come with boldneſſe vnto the throne of grace, ſince now to his endleſſe comfort he feeleth, that Chriſt hath borne the puniſhment of his ſinne, that hee might enioy the fruite of Chriſtes righteouſnes, which is all grace in this world and hereafter euerlaſting life.
            Out of this ſhort explication of the Apoſtles wordes, &amp; light touch of this moſt wounderful doctrine, we may for our better inſtruction obſerue, firſt who are to be reconciled, that is God and man: ſecondly by whom they are to be reconciled, that is by Ieſus Chriſt: thirdly by what meanes Chriſt reconcileth man vnto God, which is by taking away from man that which is mans, that is his ſinne: and by giuing vnto man that which is not mans, but Gods, euen the righteouſneſſe of God in him.
            Then firſt the chiefe partie that is to be reconciled is God, and he Mat 23 3

                   Ier 25.4 ſent his ſeruaunts earely and late, to recall his people from their ſinnes; and although they were euill entreated and put to ſhame, yet in the aboundance of his loue he proteſteth that Eze

Yet for all this God full of mercy and ready to forgiue, giueth, in commaund Act. 1.8 Mat. 28.19 to his Apoſtles, and to other ſucceſſors the paſtors and teachers in the Church, not to commaund but to pray, not in there owne name but in his, that yet at the length they would be reconciled vnto him.

Thus much for the firſt party our mercifull God that beſeecheth man to be reconciled vnto him, now followeth that wee ſhould ſpeake of the ſecond partie, which is Man &amp; his demeannor in this reconciliation towardes God.
            Now Man in the verſ. 19 verſe going before is called the world, the which word is ſometime taken for the wicked of the worlde, in which ſence our Sauiour ſpeaketh when he ſaieth I Iohn 17.9 praye not for the world, &amp; the Apoſtle ſaith, God 1. Cor. 11.3 chaſteneth vs in the worlde, leaſt wee ſhould be condēned with the world. In which ſence if wee take man, ſo farre is he from ſeeking to be reconciled with God, that ſomtime 
in the pride of his heart, he aſketh with Pharaoh 
               Ezod 5.2 who is the Lorde that I ſhould heare his voice. Yea, when we preach vnto ſuch Ier. 11.21 the glad tidinges of peace, they ſay vnto vs preach to vs no more in the name of the Lorde, thus when wee ſpeake of peace Luk. 19.42 they care not for thoſe thinges that make for their peace, but prepare themſelues to warre with God laying ſinne vppon ſinne, as though with the Giants they would plucke God out of heauen. Indeede before ſuch ſwine, it is vnmeete that we ſhould Mat. 7.6 caſt forth heauenly pearles, or publiſh the thinges that make for their peace. Becauſe God in his iuſtice hath ſo blinded their eies, that now they are hidden from their ſight. Yet becauſe ſuch which are reprobate 1. Reg. 8.39 Reu. 2.23 are knowen onely to God, becauſe he by his will reuealed, 1. Tim. 2.4 would haue all men to be ſaued &amp; come vnto the knowledge of his truth, &amp; hath commaunded vs to Marke 16.15 publiſh this word of Reconcilion vnto all: it ſtandeth vs in duety to harken to the heauenly voice, &amp; Luke 8.5 in ſcattering the ſeede of this his gracious promiſe leauing the ſucceſſe vnto the heauenly bleſſing of himſelfe. Thus muſt wee do becauſe God may call Mart. 20.9 them at the laſt houre of the day and who knoweth whether now. For hee can make the Exo. 17 6 ſtonie rocke to guſh out with water, and Luke 5.6 
               Peter (after his fruitleſſe labour)

at once to catch a great draught of fiſh. It is true men are loth to ſowe where they ſhall not reape, and againſt all likelyhood to beſtowe their hopeleſſe paines: yet let ſuch know that that

Thus then you ſee, that of ſome, vnto whom this worde is preached, in the eye of man there is ſmall hope, and yet God in great mercy will haue this word of reconcilement publiſhed to them.
            Now if we take the world for the elect of God in which ſence the Iohn 12.47 ſonne of man is ſaid to be ſent not to condemne the worlde but to ſaue the world, and againe that the Iohn 17.2 world may beleeue that thou haſt ſent me. A wonder it is to ſee, how wee prepare our ſelues vnto God; for it is ſo that amongſt vs their are ſome, that are content to be made friendes with God and this they make a parte of their deſire, but yet they Eccl. 11.9 feede God with delay Reu. 3.20 and put of from day to day, and wil haue God

vp their woundes as men of diſpaire, at the view of Gods mercie they ſpeake vnto him as Peter did to Ieſus,Luke 5.8 goe away from me for I am a ſinfull man. Whoſe caſe herein is ſo much the more happie, by how much they ſeeme to thēſelues to be more miſerable. For when GOD hath in this ſorte ſearched their woundes, &amp; launced them euen vnto the quick, then he powreth in oyle, and maketh them to feele the ſweet of his mercy, then he taketh away their ſins the cauſe of their feare, and ſo clotheth them with the robes of righteouſnes, that now in a good confidence of hope, and that with all boldneſſe they come into the preſence of God their father.

that he is eyther of the wicked ſort which either care not at all for comming vnto God, or which is worſe appoſe themſelues in defiance againſt him, or if he be of the better ſorte, then eyther he thinketh himſelfe vnworthy to be a friend of Gods, which is a readie ſteppe to his future bleſſednes, or if he purpoſeth to be Gods friend he either meaneth to be hereafter, or if forthwith, yet then he will haue God to receaue with him his earthly pleaſures and deſires, and howſoeuer in his greateſt faith and friendſhip with God, hee hath a liking ſometime vnto ſinne and although he be ſorie for it, yet he neuer leaueth louing and liking her, till he be deliuered from this body of his fleſhe, and is with Chriſt: thus much for the parties God and man which are to be reconciled.

                   2 7 none that can take away ſinne but God alone, or reſtore the image Rom. 8 29 that man hath depraued ſaue hee onely that made the image. Much may be ſpoken of the groſſe papiſts, to maintaine their fancies of many mediators. But all to no purpoſe as you ſee, for without all queſtion, Actes 4.12 amongſt men, there is no other name by which a man ſhalbe ſaued, ſaue onely the name of Ieſus Chriſt. And he that will not be content to be ſaued by him, but wil haue an other with him for his ſauiour, ſhal neither be holpen by any other, nor yet finde ſauing health in Chriſt. And in truth 2. Cor. 1.20 in whom are all the promiſes of God yea and men, but onely in Ieſu Chriſt Col. 1.20 in whom did it pleaſe the father to reconcile all things to himſelfe, and to ſet at peace with him both the thinges in heauen and the thinges in earth, but onely by Ieſus Chriſt, and the bloud of his croſſe, thus is he made not onely the Heb. 12 2 anchor but the finiſher

alſo of our faith, Mat. 1.21 Ieſus becauſe he ſaueth vs from our ſinnes; that one, yea Eph. 1.10 onely in whom God doth regather all thinges, both which are in earth and which are in heauen. Wherefore wee Iohn 14.1 that haue beleeued in the father, let vs beleeue in him, Gen. 27.21 for in him the father is well pleaſed, and for his ſake will be well pleaſed with vs. True Heb. 9.7 
               Iacob had not obteyned the bleſſing, if in his owne rayment he had come, and not in the robes of his eldeſt brother. True none but the Reu. 12.1 high prieſt and that but once in the yeere might enter into the holy of holieſt. True, none of the people might offer ſacrifice vnto God, but by the prieſt, yet Reu. 12.1 whē now Chriſt clotheth vs with his righteouſnes, whē he hath rent the Luk. 23 45 vaile and broken downe the partition wall, when he Reu. 1.6 made vs prieſtes, and leades vs by the hand vnto his father, wee cannot but hold vp our eyes and thanke God of this his great mercy ſhewed to vs in him. Thus we looke on him as Exo. 12.35 our onely Moſes which hath deliuered vs from the bōdage of our ſpirituall Pharaoh thus wee looke on him as our bleſſed Ieſus which hath giuen Ioſh. 14.1 vs right &amp; will inueſt vs in the poſſeſſion of our promiſed Canaan. Thus when wee behold Matt. 8.14 him curing euery ſore and euery ſicknes, we cannot but confeſſe that he is ſent of the father in whom onely for 
euery maladie and euery ſinne we ſhould find but one yet all ſufficient remedie Wherefore that which Barnard ſpake rauiſhed with the comfort he felt in our Sauiour, let vs ſay Pern. in

And Ioſh. 24.15 as Ioſhuah ſpake to the people, when he had laied Gods manifold benefits before their eies, now chuſe you what God you will ſerue, whether the Lord, or the Gods of the nations that are rouund about, but as for me and my houſe we will ſerue the Lord: in like ſort let euery right Chriſtian ſay, chuſe you what ſauiours and mediatours you will haue, whether the Lord Ieſu, or the gods of the papiſt: as for me and my houſe Ieſus ſhalbe a mediator, and that onely vnto vs. The whith if we ſhall doe as we ſeeme to ſay, God ſhall ſay to vs as he did of Marie which ſat at the feete of Ieſus and heard his voice, Luk. 10.4

               Martha is troubled about many things, but Marie hath choſen the better parte. Thus you haue heard, that this Ieſus is the onely mediator of this couenant, by which man is reconciled vnto God.
            Now Ieſus is the man by whom God in his goodnes doth ſaue the worlde, and whom he hath made the mediatour of this couenaunt of peace: ſo it is expedient for the full ſatiſfying of all Chriſtian mindes, in him to conſider

his two natures, his Godhead and his Manhood, for except he had beene God, he had not beene able, and except he had beene man, he had not beene fitte to accompliſh the worke of our redemption and to reconcile vs vnto God his father.
            Wherefore let vs firſt, conſider that this Ieſus is God, and the reaſons why it was expedient that he ſo ſhould be: he is God, for Col. 2.9 it pleaſed the father that in him ſhould dwel the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily and in truth, being the Mat. 3.17 ſonne of his father, not by adoption as are we but by eſſence, not by grace but by nature, being Col. 1.35 Hebr. 1 3 the very image of the father, and the engrauen forme euen of his ſubſtance, he could not but be God. For as euery creature bringeth forth their yong after their kinde, ſo the creator of all, muſt needes bring forth after his kinde God of God euen of the ſubſtaunce and eſſence of himſelfe. And therefore Paul ſpeaking of our ſauiour ſaith Phil. 2.6 that he was in the forme of God, and thought it no robbery to be equall with God, for although the perſon of the father is diſtinct from the perſon of the ſonne, yet in the eſſence and nature of the dietie, they are one, Iohn 10.30 1. Iohn 5.7 I and my father are one, wherefore as Chriſt ſpake to the diſciples of Iohn, which came to know whether he were that Meſſiah that ſhould come,

               Mat. 11.9 goe tell Iohn what you haue heard &amp; ſeene: Euen ſo may we anſwere to them, that doubt of the d
                  •
               etie of our Sauiour, goe tell what you haue heard of him. For when thou heareſt that the dead were raiſed by him and reſtored to life, that the diuels were caſt forth, and ſtood at his commaund: that he cured all ſicknes by his worde, that he calmed the waters when they did rage, and made the windes be huſh when they did bluſter, how cāſt thou but with Thomas fall at his feete &amp; ſpeake to his glory and thy ſoules good Iohn 20.28 
               My Lord &amp; my God: how canſt thou crie out with that elect veſſel, 1. Tim. 3.16 of a truth great is the miſtery of godlineſſe, God is manifeſted in the fleſh.
            Now as our Sauiour is God of the ſame nature with his father, ſo it is worth our labour to conſider, that it was moſt expedient yt he ſo ſhould be. For otherwiſe how could he ſatiſfie the wrath of his father due to our ſins, for when our ſins were infinite according to the infinite maieſtie of God whom they did treſpaſſe: it muſt needs be that he which is to ſatiſfie for thoſe infinite ſinnes, muſt either be of an infinite nature, or muſt for all infinity be for euer puniſhed. But now ſince the Act. 2.24 ſorrowes of death are fully loſed in our Sauiour, Ioh. 19 30 and he himſelf ſpake of them Conſummatum eſt, it is finiſhed, it muſt needes be

ſince Hebr. 2.14 he conquered death, and him that had the power of death which is the deuill, 2. Tim. 1.10 alſo as S. Paule ſpeaketh hee aboliſhed death and brought life and immortalitie vnto light, it muſt needes be that he ſhould be of an infinite nature and therefore God. For as none Marke 2.7 can forgiue ſinnes but God, ſo none can beare the burden of ſinne but God, for it draue Gen. 3.23 
               Adam out of paradiſe and Iude 1.6 the angels out of heauen. So that ſince Chriſt was to beare the burden of our ſinnes, which man and angell was not able to doe, it muſt needes be that he ſhould be greater then man or angell and that is God. Nay when he willed vs which Iohn 14.1 beleeued on his father to beleeue alſo on him, and when we may not Ier. 17.5 beleeue on any ſauing on the Lorde of hoſt, for if we do we bring a curſe vpon our ſoules, moſt conuenient it is that our ſauiour ſhould be God: eſpecially ſince the Lord ſaith of himſelfe that Iſa. 43 11 beſide him there is no Sauiour. To conclude if he were not God how ſhould his eares be open to our prayers,1. Sam. 1.14 1.19 how ſhould he ſee our ſighes and inward gronings, how ſhould his merite be auailable to all except he were omniſufficient of himſelfe, and and through the infinitie of himſelf, did make his merite of infinite price. Wherfore that he might be able to beare the burden of our ſin, and to ſatiſfie for the infinitie of the ſame, that

we might beleeue on him as we do on the father, &amp; that his merite might bee made auailable to all, it is expedient that he ſhould bee God.
            Now as he was God ſo is he alſo man, &amp; therfore the Apoſtle, when he had ſhewed that their was but one mediator betwixt God &amp; man, he after addeth 1. Tim. 2.6 the mā Chriſt Ieſu, for who Gen. 3.15 was to bruiſe the Serpentes head, but the ſeede of the woman,Gen. 17.19 in whom was al nations to be bleſſed, but in the ſeed of Abraham and Gal. 3.16 this ſeede as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh was Chriſt, from Ier. 23 5 whence came that righteous braunch that ſhould reigne as king, but from the Rom

            Thus haue you heard of the mediator that is betwixt God and man, the man Chriſt Ieſus, now are we to harken of the meanes, by which this Chriſt recōcileth vs vnto God his father: which is firſt in that he which knew no ſinne was made ſinne for vs, ſecondly in that wee which knew no righteouſneſſe were made the righteouſnes of God in him.
            In that our Sauiour is ſaide to know no ſinne, his meaning is not that ſinne is to him a matter ſtrange, a thing which he did neuer know, for Mat. 21.45 he taketh knowledge of ſinne, elſe how ſhould Mat. 22 12 he reproue the world becauſe of ſin, how ſhould he be the Act. 10 42 2. Tim 4.8 iudge of the world to giue to euery one according to his works. But as it is ſaide of the virgin Mary which knew man,Luke 1.34 and did conuerſe and liue amongſt them that yet notwithſtanding ſhee knew no

                like as Adam is ſaid to know Eue, and 1. Sam. 1.19 
               Elkanah Hanna which was his wife. In like ſort it is ſaid of our Sauiour that although he toke notice of ſin, &amp; did reproue it, yet he knew no ſinne as other men, by louing and liking of it, by being many waies polluted and defiled with it. And therfore he ſaith vnto the Iewes which Iohn 8.46 of you can reproue me of ſinne, nay although the prince of the world which is the diuel come euen to winnow and ſifte our Sauiour yet Iohn 14 30 he can find nothing in him, for as the author ſpeaketh to the Hebrewes, he is Heb. 7.26 holy harmeles, vndefiled, ſeperate frō ſinners and made higher that is purer then the heauens. And in deed how ſhould he holy others which is vnholy in himſelfe, &amp; ſanctifie other when himſelfe needeth to be ſanctified, he needed not to be ſanctified but for vs,Iohn 17.19 &amp; therefore that we might be holy euen as he alſo is holy he holied and ſanctified himſelfe. Yea that he might purge our conſciences frō dead works, through the eternall ſpirit he offered himſelfe Heb. 9.14 without ſpot, vnto God his father. Thus he 1 Pet. 2.22 knew no ſinne neither was there guile found in his mouth, thus neither could the Iewes reproue him of ſin, neither the prince of the world finde ſinne in him, thus was he pure, holy, vndefiled, ſeparate from ſinners,

and without ſpot.
            And in truth ſo it behoued him for to be, that ſo he might be made a ſacrifice for ſinne, that is as the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh ſinne for vs. For as in the old law it behoued Leuit. 1.10 Num 28.31 Deut. 15.21 that the ſacrifices for ſinne, ſhould be moſt pure without ſpot and blemiſh, ſo it behoued that he which gaue himſelfe a ſacrifice for our ſinnes, ſhould be alſo Heb 19.14 without ſpot or blemiſh, and as in the old law the ſacrifices for ſinne were called ſin, not becauſe in their natures ſo they were, but becauſe they had ſinne imputed to them; euen ſo our Sauiour here is made ſin, not becauſe he hath cōmitted ſinne, or ſinne was inherent in him as in vs: but becauſe he was made not of man but of God, a ſacrifice for our ſinnes, which were imputed vnto him. And therfore Austin. l. b. 2. contr. Maxi. 
               Auſtin when Christ was no ſinner, hee made him ſinne for vs, read the place diligently
                (ſaith that father) and leaſt happily thy booke be corrupted, or thy Latine interpreter haue erred, looke in the Greeke, and thou ſhalt finde not Chriſt to haue committed ſinne, but to be made ſinne of God the father for vs, that is a ſacrifice for our ſinne, (and a litle after) for thou ſhalt find in the bookes of the olde testament, the ſacrifices for ſinne to be called

               Exo. 29.14 In this ſence the calfe which was to be offered at the conſecrating of a prieſt,Catath is in the Engliſh called a

ſinne offering, but in the originall a ſinne in like ſorte, if any of the people had wittingly ſinned then he was to offer an hee Goate, if by ignorance a ſhe Goate; and the partie that had ſinned was to lay his hands vpon the head Leui 4.29 of the ſinne offering, &amp; to ſlay the ſinne offering before the Lorde, and the reaſon is added becauſe it was a ſinne offering.Catath In like manner the hee Goate in Num. 7.16 &amp; 22. &amp; 28. &amp; 34 &amp; 40. &amp; 46. &amp; 52. &amp;c. ſundry places of the ſeuēth chapter of the booke of Numbers is called in our vulgar tranſlation a ſinne offering but in the originall ſinne. Now then if the ſacrifices in the old law were called ſinnes, when yet in their nature they were not ſinnes, but ſacrifices onely for ſinne: in like ſorte may Ieſu Chriſt, the Iohn 1.29 onely vnſpotted and immaculate lambe Heb 10 1 of God in whom all the ſacrifices in the law were but figures, and Rom. 10.4 in whom they had their end and accompliſhmēt: like as they were called alſo ſinne, eſpecially when he is the onely ſacrifice auailable for to put away ſinne, Hebr. 10.4 &amp; 11 their was no power in al the ſacrifices of the law to do away ſinne, but onely in this that they had reſpect and reuerence vnto him. Thus then you ſee how that Ieſus Chriſt which knew no ſinne, but was moſt pure and moſt holy, and in all partes obedient to his fathers will, is yet notwithſtanding made ſinne, that is a ſacrifice for ſinne.
            
               And in this that he which knew no ſinne is yet notwithſtanding made a ſacrifice for ſinne, apparent it is, that he was not made a ſacrifice for the ſinne of himſelfe, for he knew no ſinne; but was moſt innocent and free from blame: but he was made a ſacrifice for the ſins of other, and had not onely their ſinnes imputed to him, but bore the puniſhment of them in his moſt bleſſed ſoule and body. From hence beginneth euery Chriſtian to comfort himſelf in the mercies of his God, when he ſeeth his ſinnes imputed vnto Chriſt, &amp; therefore cannot be imputed vnto him; for when man had ſinned, that which was done could not be vndone, yet ſuch is the mercy of God ſhewed towardes man in the fauour of Chriſt, that hee imputeth not vnto man his ſinne, but hath it in that account as though it had neuer beene, ſo that although as the ſcholeman ſpake a thing done cannot be but done if we reſpect the act; yet in the repute of God, which neuer thinketh nor accounteth of it, it is as though it had beene neuer done. The which that the Lord our God might perſwade vnto vs, ſometimes he ſaith Pſal. 85.2 our ſins are bound in a bundle and caſt into the bottome of the ſea, ſometime Iſa. 44.22 that he hath put away our tranſgreſſions as a cloude and our ſinnes as a miſt, ſomtime Pſa. 103.12 they are remoued from him as farre as

the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſometime Iſa. 38.17 that he hath caſt them behind him, ſometime Iſa. 43 25 that he will remember them no more, that they ſhalbe vnto him, as though they neuer were: yea and that wee might the better conceyue of his goodnes towards vs, concerning theſe our ſinnes which make vs to hang downe our heads, and to feare to come into his preſence, he ſheweth that he Reu. 20.12 hath croſt his bookes in which our ſinnes were written, nay that hee hath Col. 2.14 cancelled the handwriting that was againſt vs, that he hath Auſtin. retract. lib. 1. c. 19.
                acknowledged the receipt and giuen vs our quietus eſt. Inſomuch that now wee may ſafely walke abroad, becauſe we know he hath no writ to ſerue on vs, or action to commence againſt vs. Thus the feare of Gods diſpleaſure is ouerblowen, and the ſunne ſhine of his fauour reſteth on vs, becauſe our ſinnes are not imputed to vs. And to that end records the Rom. 4.6 Apoſtle, that heauenly note of that moſt kingly Prophet, bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not his ſinne, and although it is true of man that he will repent him ſometime of his kindnes the which he hath ſhewed, and will ſeeke to call backe his former goodnes, yet to the conſummation of our comfort it is not ſo with God he will not caſt vs in the teeth, nor lay to our charge the things he hath once pardoned, for

whom he pardoneth once he pardoneth euer, Iſa.

Wherfore we may with boldnes now lift vp our heades, ſince we doe moſt perfectly know that our ſinnes neither now are, nor yet euer ſhalbe imputed vnto vs.
            And if this be the firſt ſtep by which we begin to grow into fauour with our God, not to haue our ſinnes imputed to vs, ſurely th

Nay this for to attempt is not onely to builde vp the babell of confuſion vnto our ſelues, but vnder the ſhewe and colour of peace to giue defiance vnto God, and to make voide the means of that reconcilement which he hath offered in his ſonne: for if the Lord of mercy when he ſaw no other meanes to ſatiſfie his iuſtice, and to ſaue man, ſent his onely ſonne who in his bleſſed body, ſhould ſatiſfie his iuſtice for our ſinne, ſurely herewith not to be content, is to deſpiſe the wiſedome

and counſaile of God, &amp; to repute other their vaine ſatiſfactions, of greater merite then is the merite and paſſion of the Sonne. They anſwere for excuſe, that they content themſelues with the ordinaunce of God, and reſt in the merite and ſatiſfaction of the ſonne, but they ſay all that he did was for their originall ſinne, and ſuch ſinnes which were committed before they were baptiſed; but as for their actuall ſinne which follow baptiſme, and thoſe which they commit after they were entered into the couenant of grace, for them they ſay Chriſt hath not ſatiſfied, but hath merited only that for them man himſelf, by his faſtings and praiers, his watchings and almes deeds, ſhould ſatiſfie the iuſtice of the father. The which their moſt impious aſſertion how abhorrent it is from all Chriſtian truth, I pray you a while harken and conſider for of whom ſpake the Apoſtle Iohn but of the regenerat, and of what ſinnes but of their actual, &amp; when committed but as well after baptiſme as before, and who is then the propitiation for them but Ieſus Chriſt the righteous,1. Ihon 2.2. if any man ſinne wee haue an aduocate with the father Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes, and not onely for ours but for the ſinnes alſo of the whole worlde.

to a Chriſtian ſoule, to heare that God would pardon one fa

               lt but not another, ſo this would make but a little for the glorie of our Sauiour, to heare that he ſaued from ſome ſinnes but not from other▪ wherefore herein they eclipſe the glory of Chriſt, and magnifie their owne, for when our actuall ſinnes both in quantitie and qualitie are farre more grieuous then is the originall, in which we were borne. The ſatiſfaction for this one which is the leſſe they aſcribe vnto Chriſt, but the remedie of the other they chalenge to thēſelues, but beloued wee haue not ſo learned Chriſt. But wee knew that he is a Ieſus Matt. 1.21 which ſaueth his people not from their ſinne but from their ſinnes, euen al their ſinnes as Iohn ſpeaketh the 1. Iohn 1.7 bloud of Ieſus Chriſt clenſeth vs from all ſinne if from all, then from our actuall as well as originall, from this which wee daily commit as well as from that in which we were borne. So that as we find in ſcripture,Mat. 4.23 that Chriſt cured euery diſeaſe and infirmitie of the body, and ſome of that qualitie which could not be remedied by the power of man, euen ſo he cureth euery ſickneſſe of the ſoule, &amp; hath made himſelfe Iohn 3.14 a braſen ſerpent to be ſtinged one ſoueraigne medicine for al. Iohn 5 4 Deſcend therefore into this poole not of water but of the bloud of Chriſt not ſtirred by

an Angell, but by our Michaell who is as the Lord, Eph. 5.14 and although thou werſt dead in thy ſinnes, yet ſtand vp and the Lambe of God Iohn. .29. which taketh away the ſinnes of the worlde ſhall take away thine, euen thine actuall and originall all that thou haſt, and leaue none to be ſatiſfied by thee.
            All this ſome of the Papiſts will confeſſe, but yet yt they may ſtil maintein this diueliſh doctrine of mans ſatiſfaction, they are not afraid to ſay, that although Chriſt hath ſatiſfied for our actuall and originall ſinne, yet it is but for the guilt and filthines, it is not for the paine and puniſhment of the ſinne, ſo that although they graunt that our ſins by Chriſt in reſpect of the guilt are taken away, yet they leaue our ſinnes in reſpect of the puniſhment to be ſuſteined and ſatiſfied by vs. The which if it were ſo, how is it that the Scripture ſaieth Iſa. 53.5 that hee was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, broken for our iniquities, that the chaſticement of our peace was layed vpon his ſhoulders,verſ. 8 that he made his ſoule and offering ſacrifice for ſinne, and that with his ſtripes we are healed. Surely this wounding, breaking, chaſtiſing, ſcourging, infer a puniſhmēt which was inflicted not for his ſinnes, the which he neuer knew, but for ours which were imputed vnto him. And therfore S. 
               1. Pet. 2.24

he bare, they were a burden not his owne ſins but ours, and not the guilt onely but the puniſhment too, for it was on his body, whilſt yet he hangeth on the croſſe. And alas that at ſo great a light wee ſhould ſhut our eyes, why was he buffeted and ſcourged, why was he nailed and pearced, why was his head crowned with thornes, &amp; himſelfe crucified among theeues, why was his ſoule ſore troubled within, and frighted with the feare of his fathers wrath, why did he pray to his father to remoue this croſſe from him, and crie out as a ſoule that was forſakē, my God my God why haſt thou forſaken me: but that the Lorde in his great mercy to vs warde, but iuſtice towardes him, did puniſh in his bleſſed ſoule &amp; body the ſins of all the faithfull in the worlde ſurely beloued if we were to beare the puniſhment of our ſinnes then hath not Chriſt ſuffered for our ſinne, &amp; if he hath then do the Papiſt accuſe GOD of great iniuſtice, that he would puniſh vs for ſuch ſinne he hath already puniſhed in his ſonne. But God is iuſt let the Papiſt blatter what he will, and becauſe he hath ſaid it ſhall ſurely ſtand, for it is part of that new couenaunt which he promiſed to make, Ier. 31.34 I will forgiue their iniquitie &amp; will remember their ſins no more, if he forgiueth how doth he call them to puniſhment, if he wil

not remember, how doth he require ſatiſfactiō for them Auſtin. retract. lib. 1. c. 19.
                can a creditor forgiue the debt and yet require ſatiſfaction for the debt, no more can God be ſaid to forgiue vs our ſinne, and yet ſeeke to puniſh vs for our ſinne. 1. Iohn 2.2 If any man ſinne ſaith the Apoſtle, wee haue an aduocate Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes, not he ſaieth the papiſt but we, now whether the Apoſtle or papiſt is to be beleeued iudge you. And to ſpeake to men whoſe eies affectiō hath not wholy blinded, and from whoſe hartes wilful obſtinacie hath not taken away all ſenſe of reaſon, is this rightly to cōſider of the weight of ſinne and of his filth? is this equally to ballance the iuſtice of the almighty, &amp; the fiercenes of his wrath, kindled againſt the wickednes of men? ſurely if the puniſhment of ſinne could ſo haue beene ſatiſfied, and the wrath of the father hath ſo beene appeaſed, thou hadſt not ſent thy ſonne O bleſſed maker, neyther hadſt thou needed to haue died for vs O Emanuell. For we by our watchings &amp; faſtings, we by our hairie weedes and other penaunce, we by our many praiers and conſecrated water, wee by hearing of Maſſes and going in pilgrimage, will ſatiſfie for all ſuch puniſhment that is due for our ſinne. O fooliſh fleſh that thus preſumeſt before thy maker, if God

ſhould deale with thee according to iuſtice, &amp; the greeuouſnes of thy ſinne thou ſhouldeſt ſtand as Iob 9.3 a man wholy confounded, not able to ſatiſfie one of a thouſand; no not the leaſt that euer thou cōmitteſt in thy life, for when thy ſinne euen the leaſt of thy ſins is infinite, becauſe it was committed againſt the infinite maieſty of thy God, thy puniſhment therfore muſt be infinite, and therefore not to be ſatiſfied by thee in this finite life: and if thou canſt not ſatiſfie for one how wilt thou ſatiſfie for all, eſpecially when not onely in this that thou ſeekeſt to ſatiſfie, but alſo in the moſt holieſt of thy workes and ſoroweſt penaunce, thou often ſinneſt and treſpaſſeſſ God.

               This alſo ſome of the papiſtes do acknowledge, but yet not reſting on the good word of God, they diſtinguiſh betweene eternall and temporall puniſhments, and they are content to confeſſe that Chriſt hath ſatiſfied for their eternall puniſhment, but as for the temporall they ſay that they muſt ſatiſfie for it in themſelues. It cannot be denied but that God layeth on the ſonnes of men, many puniſhments in this life, the which are to be reputed temporall, becauſe they are in this life, which is but temporall, but yet theſe temporall puniſhments endured by men in this temporall life, or neither in part, nor in whole any part of ſatiſfaction, for our infinite and eternall ſinne. For if we conſider this as they are in the godly, ſome ſay that they are not puniſhments for ſinne, but rather fatherly admonitions that they ſhould not ſinne, becauſe for their ſinne Chriſt hath beene puniſhed, and hath ſatiſfied not in part but in whole whatſoeuer the iuſtice of God could require for them, or if wee conſider theſe as they are in the wicked, true it is that GOD ſometime beginneth to deale roughly with them, and to inflict in this life ſome part of the puniſhment which for euer hereafter they muſt in moſt grieuous manner ſuffer in hel. But yet ſince there is no proportion betwixt a finite puniſhment and an infinit

ſinne, ſince of the puniſhment and ſatiſfaction of theſe no Papiſt ſpeaketh: but of ſuch for whom Chriſt died, and for whoſe eternall puniſhment Chriſt hath ſatiſfied, wee leaue to ſpeake farther of theſe wicked ones, and call now enquire whether Chriſt hath not fully endured all puniſhment due for the ſins of the faithfull, but hath left ſome temporall puniſhment, as part of the ſatiſfaction due for their ſinnes, to be endured &amp; ſuffered by themſelues. The which if it be ſo as the papiſt ſpeaketh, not onely blaſphemy followeth our Sauiour becauſe his ſatiſfaction is made inſufficient, &amp; the ſin of man of greater filth then the merite of his moſt bleſſed paſſion: but alſo man ſpeaketh, with ouer great pride, that he preſumeth to ſatiſfie where Chriſt hath not ſatiſfied, and to make perfect which he hath left vnperfect vnto vs, or if it be true the which our Sauiour ſpeaketh Ioh. 19.2

for ſinne, and what is Christ elſe but ſinne it is a ſacrifice for ſinne. If Chriſt then be made ſinne that is a ſacrifice, on whom the puniſhment of ſinne was inflicted, and ſo made ſinne that he may put an end vnto our puniſhments, without all queſtion there is now no puniſhment for our ſinne, left to be endured and ſuffered by vs. Thou wilt ſay what are our inward griefes and torments of mind, what the conſcience of our ſinne and feare of Gods iuſtice, what the calamities and miſeries of our friends, what our ſickneſſes, yea &amp; death, nay ſinne it ſelfe, and a thouſand other euils more common to the ſaints of God, then other, but puniſhments of our ſinne. I graunt whatſoeuer other ſaith, that the Scripture calleth theſe Gen, 3.17 2 Sam. 12.10 Num. 12.14 the puniſhments of ſinne, &amp; after a ſort they are, becauſe they are the very fruites and effects of ſin, although God ſendeth not theſe Heb. 12.5 to puniſh ſinne in vs which he hath puniſhed in his ſonne. But either to make Iob 1 9 triall of our patience as he did of Iobs, or 2. Sam. 12.14 to ſhew how he hates ſinne as he did to Dauid, or to driue vs from 2. Cron 23 12 our ſinne as he did Manaſſeth, or Luk. 16.17 to winne vs to himſelfe as he did the prodigall child, or 1. Reg 19 4 to make vs loth the world as he did the godly,Rom. 7.24 and to grieue that we cānot ſerue him with that puritie we ſhould and as he requireth. Wherefore as Chryſoſtome ſpeaketh,

But yet they reply that God ſendeth miſeries on his children for none of theſe endes, but to puniſh ſinne which they haue committed be it ſo as they ſay, yet I denie as is before made manifeſt, that which all the Papiſt do ſo greatly labour that theſe endured puniſhments, make any recompence to God for our ſinne, or any whit ſatiſfie the wrath of the father conceaued againſt them. True it is that in the infancie of the Church certaine temporall puniſhments were inflicted on offenders, &amp; canonicall ſatiſfaction was required, but yet not to ſatiſfie God but the Church, not to make due recompence for the ſinne cōmitted but by this publike ſubmiſſion, to declare their vnfained ſorrow &amp; repentance for their ſinne,Tertull. lib. de paenit. the which kind of diſcipline as then, ſo now it is moſt behouefull for ye church and houſe of God. For by thoſe means not only the Church is in ſome ſorte ſatiſfied, which much grieueth at the fall of her children: but the offendant himſelfe is better occaſioned to conſider his wretched &amp; miſerable eſtate, and forced as it were to hate his ſinne, and to take held of the great mercy of his God. And not onely is this diſcipline behoueful for theſe, but for other alſo whereof ſome are in, other out of

the Church of God. For they that are in the church, by the puniſhment of other, are made more wary, leſt happily that which they ſee in other ſhould be alſo ſāpled in thēſelues; &amp; they that are out haue no cauſe to ſlander the good word of God, or to ſpeake euill of his ſpouſe, becauſe ſhee winketh not at the faultes of her children, or propoſeth vnto them liberty to ſin, but guideth their ſteps in the way of righteouſnes, &amp; puniſheth thē when they goe awrie. But to let this paſſe as a matter not pertinent to our purpoſe, out of that which hath bin ſpokē you ſee, that Chriſt Ieſus hath our ſins imputed vnto him, &amp; that by his obedience &amp; bleſſed paſſion, he hath deliuered vs not onely frō ſome ſins, but from all: not from the guilt and filth of them, but from the paine &amp; puniſhment too: &amp; that not from the paine eternal only, but alſo from all paine temporall in this life.
            Now then as you haue heard how that he was made ſinne for vs, ſo now it foloweth that we ſhould declare, how we are made the righteouſnes of God in him, where not what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh he was made ſinne not a ſinner but ſinne: nether was he made by man but by God, and to what end, that wee ſhould be made, we cannot make our ſelues, for we are Gods workmāſhip, &amp; what not righteous but righteouſnes, not of man but of God, and that

not in our ſelues but in Chriſt. The which ſpeach of the Apoſtle doth moſt manifeſtly declare, the meanes by which wee are reputed righteous in the ſight of God the father, euen by the righteouſnes which is in Chriſt not in vs, yet by Gods mercy imputed to vs, &amp; thorough faith receaued of vs, neither is not this ſence enforced on the Apoſtle beſides his meaning, but witneſſed by moſt auncient &amp; catholicke fathers, before this queſtion of inherent righteouſnes, was euer moued and debated in the church.Auſtin. enchi

                And therefore Austin, In the olde law the ſacrifices for ſinne were called ſinnes, the which ſacrifice for ſinne, he (that is Chriſt) was truly made, of whom the (ſacrifices of the lawe) were but ſhadowes.
                And after ſhewing how Chriſt was made a ſacrifice for ſinne, he ſaith, God to whom we were to be reconciled made him ſin for vs, that is a ſacrifice for our ſin, by whom he might reconcile vs ſo to himſelfe, he therefore was made ſin, that we might be made righteouſnes not ours but Gods, not in our ſelues but in him, euen as he that is Chriſt was made ſin not his owne but ours, not in himſelfe but in vs. And in the end he concludeth, this is that righteouſnes of God not by which he himſelf is iuſt, but by which we are made righteous before him. So that as our ſins cannot be ſaid to be inherent in Chriſt, but onely imputed vnto him, no more is his righteouſnes

inherēt in vs, but only by Gods mercy imputed to vs. Yet ſo that as he actually indured the paines of our imputed ſins, ſo ſhal we alſo actually inioy, yea &amp; in part now do, the fruite of his imputed righteouſnes, neither was this once barely ſpoken of this godly father, but as the Apoſtle Paule in his epiſtles ſhewed, that Chriſt 1. Cor. 1.30. was made vnto vs our righteouſnes, &amp; that we are Eph 2.8 Gal. 2.16 iuſtified onely by faith, that is by Chriſt apprehended by faith. So he ſpeaking of Chriſt ſaieth, Austin. de ciuit. li

And in the end concludeth, This is righteouſnes of God not by which God is righteous, but by the which God giueth vnto man, that mā might be righteous before him. Thus then you ſee that if we ſeeke to be found righteous before God wee muſt bring not that righteouſnes which is of our workes, but that righteouſnes which we haue not in our ſelues, but by faith in Chriſt Ieſu.Chryſoſt cō. in hunc loc

               My merite, ſaith he, is the mercy of God, and ſo long as he ſhal not be without mercy, ſo long I ſhall not be without merite: what then ſhall I ſing of my righteouſnes, nay I wil remember thy righteouſnes onely euen the righteouſnes of God which he giueth in Chriſt, for by this he iuſtifieth the world.Mat. 22.11 For as there is no ſitting at the ſupper of the great king, except we are clothed with our wedding garmēt, ſo there is no comming into the preſence of the Father, but with this robe of righteouſnes the righteouſnes of the ſonne. The which Pighius ſeing in this wiſe writeth: Pig. in cōtr. 2.
                
               Therfore it is that our righteouſnes is placed in Chriſts obediēce, becauſe the ſame is imputed to vs (which are incorporated into him) as though it were our owne, ſo that by it euen we are accounted righteous. And

frō him. And the ſame Pighius after not well vnderſtanding the fauorers of ye truth, would ſeeme in this cauſe to conclude againſt them but with them as his words do ſpeake: Pigh. de fide &amp; inst. cont. 2.
                
               But we ſay if we ſpeake formally and properly, that we are not iuſtified before God, either by our faith or by our loue, but by the onely righteouſnes of God which is in Chriſt. And that which Pighius ſpeaketh the ſame we ſpeake, with our Apoſtle, we are made the righteouſnes of God in him. Wherfore as Beda noteth out of Auſtin 
               Beda in ca. 10. epiſt. ad Rom. vpō the 126. Pſalme. Away with thy ſelfe away I ſay with thy ſelfe, for thou doeſt but hinder thy ſelfe, if thou ſhalt build thy ſelfe thou buildeſt thy ruines, for except the Lord builde the houſe in vaine doe they labour that doth build the ſame, do not therfore wil to haue thy righteouſnes leaſt thou be voided of the righteouſnes of Chriſt.
            
            What then wilt thou ſay ſhall I liue loſely &amp; be nothing ſtudious of good works, God forbid for you are Eph. 2.8 Gods workemanſhip created to good works, which God hath prepared that you ſhould walke in them. Although thoſe thy workes Rom. 8.14 doe not make thee righteous before God, yet Iames 2 22. they are fruites of that righteouſnes which thou haſt in Chriſt, &amp; by them thou cauſeſt Mat. 5.16 thy father to be glorified, &amp; 2. Pet. 1.10 ſealeſt vp thine election to thy ſelfe. Mat. 7.17. A good tree is knowen by his fruit, &amp; a true faith by his loue.

What ſhould we ſay they that are iuſtified in Chriſt Gal. 5.24 doe liue in Chriſt, nay Chriſt Gal 2.20 Eph. 5.8 liueth in them, &amp; his good ſpirite maketh them fruitfull vnto euery good worke, but this is not queſtioned at this time, what we ſhould be in this life, or how we ſhould be iuſtified before man, but by what meanes we ſhould ſtand iuſtified before God: and that wee ſay is not by our workes, but by the righteouſnes of God, which is found by faith in Ieſu Chriſt.
            But yet the weake Chriſtian will ſay, how can this be, one man may pay an others debt, but how can one ſatiſfie for an others ſinne, the Scripture ſayth,Ezech. 18.2 the father ſhall not eate a ſower grape, and the childes tooth ſhalbe turned an edge,verſ. 20 but that euery one ſhall beare his owne burden, and that the ſoule which ſinneth ſhall die the death. How then is the iuſtice of God ſatiſfied, that he which knew no ſinne ſhould be puniſhed for our ſinne, &amp; that we which are full of ſinne, ſhould reape the fruite of that righteouſneſſe that is in him. How? euen very well, becauſe he is not an other from thee, but is one with thee? for if we looke vpō that bleſſed vnion by which al faithfull ſoules are iayned vnto Chriſt, the man is not more ioyned to his wife, nor the ſcience to the ſtocke, nor the foode vnto the body which it doth nouriſh, nor in the body one member to

one other, or they al vnto the head, as is Chriſt Ieſu vnto his Church, and to euery faithfull ſoule, that truſteth and beleeueth in him. And therefore ſometime we are ſaid to be Rom. 12.4 one bodie in him, ſometime Eph. 4.16. to growe vp into him which is our head, ſometime 1. Cor. 6.15 to be members of Chriſt, ſometime to be Eph 5.30 bone of his bone and fleſh of his fleſh, ſometime to 1. Cor. 3.16 dwell in him and he in vs, ſometime to be Iohn. 17.20 one with him, what ſhould I ſay this the faithful know and thus wee muſt know, except as S. Paule ſpeaketh, we be reprobats 2 Cor. 13.5 know ye not your owne ſelues how that Ieſus Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobates. Thus beloued are we his vnworthy members Chryſoſt. ſer. de ſpirit. ſanct. vnited vnto him which is our head, by thoſe two moſt bleſſed handes, his ſpirit which he giueth vnto vs, and our faith which we reach to him.
            Then goe to let this bee graunted that Chriſt and the faithfull are but one, that he is the head of that miſticall body whereof they are members, &amp; then let vs ſee how the iuſtice of God is violated, whileſt he is puniſhed &amp; we rewarded. Thou ſayeſt in thy vſuall ſpeach that man ſeeth and man heareth, yet it is his eare that heareth, and eye that ſeeth, euen ſo thou mayeſt ſay that it is man that hath borne the puniſhment of ſin, although it is his head Chriſt Ieſu, that hath borne and endured the

ſame. For as in the naturall body that which is proper to the eye and to the eare, is attributed vnto the whole, in reſpect of that neare coniunction which each parte hath with the whole: ſo in the miſticall body of Ieſu Chriſt in reſpect of that ſpirituall and bleſſed vnion, that which is proper onely vnto Chriſt is attributed alſo to his Church. And therefore as wee ſee in ciuill pollicies, the wife is aduaunced to the honour of her huſband, and made either Counteſſe or Lady according to the honour of her huſbands ſtate: euen ſo the church which is the ſpouſe of Chriſt, although ſhe be of her ſelfe a daughter of the earth, a woman of no price, yet in reſpect of Chriſt who in marriage hath aduaunced her, ſhe is full of honour and pertaketh of all the honour of her head. So that of the faithfull we may ſay that wee Iohn 1.16 all haue receaued of his grace euen grace for grace. And as the Pſa. 131.2 oyle that was powred on Aarons head ranne downe to the ſkirtes of his garments and perfumed them, ſo the righteouſnes of our Aaron that is Ieſus Chriſt, although powred on his head yet perfumeth vs, and maketh vs gratious in the ſight of God. So that now as euery member is liued of the head, and hath their ſence and moouing from it: euen ſo haue wee our life from him, and all our ſence and motion which

is vnto good. Nay as the viler partes of the bodie doe partake of the worſhip and glory of the head, and are then honored when it is honoured, and then diſpiſed when it is diſpiſed: euen ſo in this ſpirituall vnion betwixt Chriſt and his faithfull members, although they be more vile in compariſon to Chriſt, then are the baſeſt partes of the body inferiour to the head: yet are they honoured when he is honored, and with the crowne of righteouſneſſe that ſetteth on his head, are they alſo crowned and made righteous. Thus then you ſee that it is not an other that hath ſuffered for you, nor an other by whom yee are made righteous, but it is the head that ſuffereth for his members, and the head that in himſelfe crowneth euery member, with the crowne of righteouſnes and of glory.
            Wherefore comfort your ſelues you that mourne in Sion, and are feared with Gods wrath, and the filth of your ſinne, for GOD which was your enimie is become your friend, and beſeecheth you to be reconciled vnto him: and although your ſinnes haue kept you backe, and defaced image hath made you aſhamed to approch his preſence, yet now he hath ſent his ſonne the brightnes of his glory not only by his ſuffering to take away your ſinnes, but by his obedience to reſtore you to

your former bewty, and to preſent your faultleſſe vnto himſelfe. Let vs therefore reſt on the goodnes of our God, and accept of his reconcilement perfourmed in his ſonne, let Reu. 4.10. vs caſt downe our crownes, and fall on our faces, and giue all glory to him that ſitteth on the throne, and to the Lambe for euermore, Amen. Reu. 7.12. Praiſe, glory &amp; wiſdome, and thanks, and honor, &amp; power, and might be vnto our God for euermore. Amen.
