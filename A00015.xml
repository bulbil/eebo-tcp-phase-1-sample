            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  MANY are the dombe warninges of Distruction, which the Almighty God hath lately scourged this our Kingdome with; And many more are the threatning Tokens, of his heauy wrath extended toward vs: All which in bleeding hearts, may inforce vs to put on the true garment of Repentance, and like vnto the Niniuits, vnfainedly solicite the sweet mercies of our most louing God: Therefore let vs now call to remembrance the late grieuous and most lamentable Plague of Pestilence, wherein the wrath of God tooke from vs so many thousandes of our friendes, kindred and acquaintance: let vs also call to remembraunce the most wicked and pretended malice, of the late Papisticall Conspiracie of Traytors, that with powder practised the subuersion of this beautifull Kingdome: And lastly let vs fir our eyes vpon theise late swellinges of the outragious Waters, which of late now hapned in diuers partes of this Realme, together with the ouerflowing of the Seas in diuers and sundry places thereof: whose fruitfull valeys, being now ouerwhelmed and drowned with these most vnfortunate and vnseasonable salt waters, doe fore-shew great Barrennes, and

Famin to ensue after it, (vnlesse the Almightie God of tis great infinit mercy and goodnesse doe preuent it.) But now oh England, be not ouercome with thine owne fully: Be not blinded with the ouermuch securitie of thy selfe, neyther sinke thou thy selfe in thine owne sinne:

That is to say, in the Counties of Glocester, Sommer et, together with the Countries of Monmoth, Glamorgan, Carmarthen, and diuers and sundry other places of South-wales: the like neuer in the memory of man, hath euer bin soeue or beard of: The suddayne terror whereof strooke such an amazed feare into the hearts of all the inhabitants, of those partes, that euery one prepared himselfe ready to entertayne the last Period of his liues Destruction: Doeming it altogether to be a second deluge: or an vniuersal, punishment by Water.
            For vpon the Tuesday being the 20 of Ianuary last, as atoresaid, about nine of the clocke in the morning, the Sunne being most fayrely and brightly spred, many of the Inhabitantes of those Countreys before mencioned, prepared the m

               lues to their affayres, some to one buisines, some to an other: euery man according to his calling. As the Plowmen setting foorth their Cattle to their labours, the Shepheardes feeding of their flockes, the Farmers ouer▪seeing of their grounds, and

looking so their cattle finding therein, and so euery one imploid in his busines as occasion required. Then they might see &amp; perceiue a far of, as it were in the Element, huge and mighty Hilles of water, tumbling one ouer another, in such sort as if the greatest mountaines, in the world, had ouer-whelmed the lowe Ualeyes or Marshy grounds. Sometimes it so dazled the eyes of many of the Spectators, that they immagined it had bin some fogge or miste, comming with great swiftnes towardes them: and with such a smoke, as if Mountaynes were all on fire: and to the view of some, it seemed as it: 
                  〈◊〉
                of thousandes of Arrowes had bin shot foorth all at one time, which came in such swiftnes, as it was verify thought, that the Fowles of the ayre could scarse fly so fast, such was the threatning furyes thereof.
            But assoone as the people of those Countries, perceiued that it was the violence of the Waters of the raging Seas, and that they began to exceede the compasse of their accustomed boundes, and making so furiously towardes them. happy were they that could make the best, and most speed away, many of them, leauing all their goods and substance, to the merciles Waters, being glad to escape away with life themselues: But so violent and swift were the outragioue waues, that pursued one an other, with such vehemencie, and the Waters multiplying so much in so short a time, that in lesse then fiue houres space▪ most part of those cuntreys (and especially the places which lay lowe,) were all ouer flowen, and many hundreds of people both men women, and children were then quite deuoured, by these outragious waters, such was the furie of the waues, of the Seas, the one of them dryuing the other forwardes with such force and swiftnes, that it is almost incredible for any to beleeue the same, except such as tasted of the smart thereof, and such as behelde the

same, with their eyes: Nay more, the Farmers, Husbandmen, and Shepheards, might beholde their goodly flockes of Sheepe, swimming vpon the Waters dead, which could by no meanes be recouered.
            Many Gentlemen, Yeomen and others, had great losses, of cattle, as Oxen, Kine, Bullockes, Horses, Colts, Sheepe, Swine, Nay not so much as their poultry about their houses, but all were ouer whelmed and drownd, by these merciles Waters: Many men that were rich in the morning when they rose out of their beds, were made poore before noone the saine day: such are the Judgements of the Almightie God, who is the geuer of all good thinges, who can and will dispose of them agayne at all times, according to his good will and pleasure, whensoeuer it shall seeme best vnto him. Many others like wise, had their habitations or dwelling houses all carryed away in a short time, and had not a place left them, so much as to shrowde themselues in.
            Moreouer, many that had great store of Corne and Grayne, in their Barnes and Garners in the morning had not within fiue boures space afterwardes, so much as one Grayne to make them bread withall: Neither had they so much left as a locke of Hay or Straw to seede their cattell which were left: Such was the great misery they susseyned by the fury of this watry Element, from which like, good Lord I beseech him of his influ e mercy and goodnes to deliuer vs all.
            The names of some of the Townes and Uillages which suffered great harmes and losses hereby were these, (Viz.)
            
            
               Bristoll and Aust this Aust is a village or town some 8. miles distant from Bristoll vpon the Seauerne side where all people are Ferryed ouer, that come out of Wales, into those partes of Gloucester and Sommersect-shire.
            
            
               All the countries along on both the sides of the riuer of Seauerne, from Gloucester to Bristoll, which is about some 20. miles was all ouer flowne, in some places 6. miles ouer, in some places more, in some lesse.
            Moreouer, all or the most parte, of the Bridges, betweene Gloucester and Bristoll, were all forcibly caried away with the Waters: besides many goodly buildings there abouts much defaced, and many of them carryed quite away: besides many other great losses of al kinds of Corne and Grayne, and cattle that were then lost.
            At Aust, many passengers that are Ferryed ouer there now, are saine to be guided by guides, all along the Can

               es, where the water still remayneth for the space of 3 or 4 myles, or else they wilbe, in great daunger of Drowning, the Water lyeth as yet so deepe there.
            Many dead Carkasses, both there, and in many other places, of the country, are dayly found floating vpon the Waters, and as yet cannot be knowne who they are, or what number of persons are drowned, by reason of the same Waters, which as yet in many places remaine very deepe: so great was the spoyle that thiese mercilesse Elementes there wrought and made.
            In Bristoll was much harme done, by the ouerflowing of the Waters, but not so much as in other places, many Cellars and Ware-houses, where great store of Marchandize was in, (as Wine, Salt, hops, Spices, and other such like Ware) were all spoyled. And the people of the Towne were inforced to be carried in Boates, vp and downe the said Cittie about their busines in the Fayre time there.
            Upon the other side of the Riuer of Seauerne, towardes a Towne called Chepstow, vpon the lower groundes, was much harme done, by the vyolence of the Water.
            There was in Chepstow a woman drown'd in her

bed: and also a Gyrle, by the like misfortune.
            Also, all along the same coastes. vp to Gold-clift, Matherne, Calicot-Moores, Redrift, Newport, Cardiffe, Cowbridge, Swansey, Laug

                  erne, Llanstephan, and diuers other places, of Glamorgan-shire, Munmoth-shire, Carmarthen-shire, and Cardigan▪shire: many great harmes were there done, and the waters raged so furiously▪ and with such great vehemencie, that it to supposed that in those partes, there cannot be so few persons drowned as 500: both Men. Women, and Children, besides the losse of aboundance of all kinde of Corno and Graine: together with their Hay, and other prouision which they had made for their Cattle.
            Moreouer, there were in the places afore mentioned, many thousandes of Cattle, which were 
                  ••
               eeding in the Lowe Ualeys, drownd and ouerwhelmed with the violence of the furious waters: as Oren kine, young beastes, horses, Sheepe, Swine, and such like, the number is deemed infinit: yea, and not so much as Turkies, Hens, Geese, Duckes, and other Poultry about their houses could once escape away, the Waues of the Sea so ouerwhelmed them.
            And that which is more straunge: There are not now found onely floating vpon the Waters still remaining, the dead Carkasses of many men women and children: But also an aboundance of all kinde of wilde Beasts, as Foxes, Hares, Connies, Rats, Moules and such like: some of them swimming one vpon an others Becke▪ thinking to haue saued themselues thereby▪ but all was in vaine, such was the force of the Waters that ouer▪pressed them.
            In a place in Munmoth shire, there was a maide went to milke her kine in the morning, but before she had fully ended her busines, the vehemencie of the Waters increased, and so suddenly environed her about, that she could not escape thence, but was enforced to make shift

                Banke to saue herselfe, which she did with much adoe, where she was constrained to abide all that day and night, vntill 8 of the clocke in the next morning in great distresse, what with the coldnes of the ayre and waters: and what with other Accidents that there hapned vnto her, she had bin like there to haue perished: had not the Almightie God of his infinit mercy and goodnes, preserued her, from such great perills and daungers, which were likely there to ensue vnto her.
            But there placing her selfe for saueguard of her life as aforesaid, hauing none other refuge to fly vnto: the Waters in such violent sort had so pursued her, that there was but a small distance of ground left vncouered with Waters, for her to abide vpon: There she remayned most pittyfully lamenting the great daunger of life that she was then in, expecting euery minute of an houre, to be ouerwhelmed with those mercylesse Waters: But the Almighty God, who is the Creator of all good things, when he thought méete, sent his holy Angell to commaund the Waters to cease their fury: and so returne into their accustomed bonuds againe, wherby according to his most blessed will and pleasure she was then preserued.
            In the meane space, during the continuance of her abode there, diuers of her friends practised all the means they could to recouer her, but could not, the Waters were of such a déepenes about her, and Boates they had none, in all those partes to succour her, such was their want in this distresse, that many perished through the want thereof.
            There was a Gentleman of worth, dwelling néere vnto the place where she was, who caused a goodly Gelding to be sadled, and set a man vpon the backe of him, thinking to haue fetcht her away, but such were the déepenes of the waters, that he durst not aduenture

the same, but retyred.
            At last some of her friends, deuised a deuise, and tyed two broad Troughes the one to the other, (such as in those countreys they vse to salt Bacon in) and put therin two lustie strong men, who with long Powles (stirring these troughes) (as if they had bin boates) made great shift to come to her, &amp;  so by this meanes, through Gods good helpe she was then saued.
            But now (gentle Reader) marke what befell, at this time, of the strangenes of other creatures: whom the Waters had violently oppressed: for the two men which tooke vpon them to fetch away the maide from the top of the Banke, can truely witnes the same as well as her selfe to be true, for they beheld the same with their Eyes.
            The Hill or Banke where the maide abode all that space▪ was all so couered ouer, with wilde beastes and vermin, that came thither to séeke for succour) that she had much adoe to saue her selfe, from taking of hurt by them: and much a-doe she had to kéepe them from créeping vpon and about her, she was not so much in daunger of the Water on the one side: as she was troubled with these Uermin on the other side.
            The beastes and Uermin that were there were these. (Viz)
            
            Dogs Cats, Moules, Foxes, Hares, Conyes, yea and not so much, as Mice and Rats: but were there in abundance and that which is more straunge: The one of them neuer once offred to annoy the other: although they were deadly enemies by Nature the one to an other: Yet in this daunger of life, they not once offred to expresse their naturall enuie: But in a gentle sort, they freely inioyed the libertie of life, which in mine opinion, was a most wonderfull worke in Nature.
            But now let vs leaue this matter touching this

maide, besides the other accidentes before rehearsed and let vs returne againe to these watry miseries: The counties of Glamorgan. Carmarthen, and Cardigan, and many other places in South-wales, haue likewise borne the heauy burden, of Gods wrath herein: And many were the liues of them that were lost through this watery destruction.
            Many there were which fled into the toys of high trées, and there were inforced to abide some three daies, some more, and some lesse▪ without any victuals at all, there suffring much colde besides many other calamities, and some of them in such sort, that through euermuch hunger and cold, some of them fell down againe out of the Trées, and so were like to perish for want of succour. Othersame, sate in the toys of high Trees as aforesaid, beholding their wiues, children, and seruants, swimming (remediles of all succour) in the Waters.
            Other some sitting in the tops of Trees might behold their houses ouerflowne with the waters. some their houses caryed quite away: and no signe or token left there of them.
            Many of them might sée, as they stood vpon the toys of high Hilles, their cattle pe

               , and could not tell how to succour them, and their Barnes, with all their store of Corne and Graine quite consumed, which was no small griefe vnto them.
            Many people and Cattle in diuers places of these Cuntreys, might haue beene saued in time, if that the cuntreys had beene any thing like furnished with bootes, or other prouision fit for such a sudden Accident, as this was, which as God himselfe knoweth▪ was little expected of them to haue fallen so suddenly vpon them.
            But seeing the cuntreys were so vnfurnished with Boates much harme was done, to the vtter vndooing of many thousandes.
            Some fled into the tops of churches and Stéeples,

to saue themselues, from whence they might beholde, themselues depriued aswell of all their substance, as also of al their ioys▪ which they had before receiued in their wiues and children, beware, whole R

               kes of Pease, Beanes, Dates, and other graine were seene a far of, to float vpon the Water too and fro, in the Countreys as if they had bin ships vpon the Seas.
            The Foundations of many Churches and houses, were in a manner decayed, and some caryed quite away, as in Cardisse, in the county of Glamorgan there was a great part of the Church next the Water side eaten downe, with the Water, many houses and Gardens there, which were neere the water side, were all ouerflowen, and much harme bone.
            Diuers other Churches lie hidden in the Waters, and some of them the tops are to be seene: and other some, nothing at all to be séene, but the very tops of the Steeples, and of some of them nothing at all, neyther steeple nor nothing else. Also many schooles of young schollers, in many places of those cuntreys, stood in great perplexitle, some of them aduenturing home to their parents were drowned by the way: Other some staying behinde in in Churches, did climbe vp to the tops of Steeples, where they were very neere starued to death for want of foode and fire: many by the help of boards and plankes of Wood, swam to dryland and so were preserued from vntimely Death, Many had Boates brought them, some 10 miles, some 15. some 20. where there was neuer seene any Boates before.
            Thus God suffred many of them to escape his yrefull wrath, in hope of their amendment of life: Some men that were riding on the high wayes were ouertaken with these mercilesse Waters, and were drowned.
            And againe many haue bin most strangely preserued.
            As for example, there was in the Countie of Glamorgan▪
                a man both blind and did ride and one which

had not bin able to stand vpon his legs in ten yeares before, he had his poore cottage broken downe by the force of the Waters, and himselfe, Bed and all caryed into the open fields, where being readie to sinke, and at the point to seeke a resting place, two fathoms deepe vnder the Waters: his hand by chaunce catcht holde of the Raster of an house swimming by the fiercenesse of the Windes, then blowing Easternely he was driuen safely to the Land, and so escaped.
            Also in an other place, there was a man Child of the age, of 5. or 6. yeares, which was kept swimming for the space of two houres, abone the Waters, by reason that his long Coates lay spread vpon the tops of the waters, and béeing at last, at the very poynt to sinke: there came by chaunce by, (floating vpon the tops of the Waters,) a fat Weather that was dead, very full of Wooll: The poore distressed Child perceiuing this good meanes of recouerie, caught fast hold on the Wethers Wool, and likewise with the winde he was driuen to dry land, and so saued.
            There wes also in the County of Carmarthen, a yaung Woman, who had foure small Children, and not one of them able to helpe it selfe: And the Mother then seeing the su

            Many more there were that through the handyworkes of God were preserued from this violent death o

some vppon Woodden plankes: some by clyming of Trées▪ some by remaining in the tops of high Stéeples and Churches, other some by making of spéed away with swift horses, and some by the meanes of Boates, sent out by their friendes to succour them: but there were not so many so straungely saued, but their were as many in number as straungely drownd.
            The lowe Marshes and Fenny groundes, néere Barstable in the Countie of Deuon were ouerflowne, so farre out, and in such outragious sort, that the cuntrey all along to Bridge-water was greatly distressed thereby, and much hurt there done it is a most pittifull sight to beholde what numbers of fat Oxen, were there Drawned: what flockes of Shéepe, what heades of kine, haue their bin lost, and Drowned in in these outragious Waters: there is little now remaining there, to be séene, but huge Waters like to the maine Ocean: The tops of Churches and Stéeples like to the tops of Rockes in the Sea. Great Reekes of Fodder for Cattle, are floating like Ships vpon the Waters, and dead Beastes swimming thereon: Now past feeding on the same, through the rigour of this Element of Water: The tops of Tréees, a man may beholde remaining aboue the Waters, Upon whose braunches, multitudes of all kinde of Turkies, Hens, and other such like Poultry were faine to sly vp into the Trées to saue their liues, where many of them perished to death, for want of reliefe, not being able to fly to dry land for succour, by reason of their weakenes.
