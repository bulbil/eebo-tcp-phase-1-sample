            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  IN ſearching famous Chronicles,
                  it was my chance to reade
                  A worthy Story ſtrange and true,
                  whereto I tooke good heed:
                  Betwixt a Farmer and his Son,
                  this rare example ſtands,
                  Which wel may moue the hardeſt hearts
                  to weepe and wring their hands.
               
               
                  The Farmer in the Countrey liu'd,
                  whoſe ſubſtance did excell;
                  He ſent therefore his eldeſt Sonne,
                  in Paris for to dwell,
                  Where he became a Marchant man,
                  and Trafficke great he vſed,
                  So that he was exceeding rich,
                  till he himſelfe abuſed.
               
               
                  For having now the World at will,
                  his mind was wholly bent
                  To gaming, wine, and wantonneſſe,
                  till all his goods were ſpent.
                  Yea, ſuch exceſſiue Riotouſneſſe
                  by him was ſhewed forth,
                  That he was three times more in debt
                  then all his wealth was worth.
               
               
                  At length his credit cleane was crackt,
                  and he in Priſon caſt,
                  And every man againſt him then
                  did ſet his action faſt.
                  There lay he lockt in Irons ſtrong,
                  for euer and for aye,
                  Vnable while his life did laſt,
                  his grieuous debt to pay.
               
               
                  And liuing in this wofull caſe,
                  his eyes with teares he ſpent:
                  The lewdneſſe of his former life,
                  too late he did repent:
                  And being void of all reliefe,
                  of helpe and comfort quite;
                  Vnto his father at the laſt,
                  he thus began to write.
               
               
                  Bow downe a while your déedfull eares,
                  my loving Father deare:
                  And grant I pray in gracious ſort,
                  my piteous plaint to heare.
                  Forgive the foule offences all
                  of your unthrifty Son;
                  Which through the lewdneſſe of his life,
                  hath now himſelfe undone.
               
               
                  O my good Father, take remorſe
                  on this my extreme need,
                  And ſuccour his diſtreſſed ſtate,
                  whoſe heart for woe doth bléed.
                  In direfull dungeon here I lye,
                  my feet in ſetters faſt:
                  Whom my moſt cruell Creditors
                  in Priſon ſo have caſt.
               
               
                  Let pity therefore pierce your brest,
                  and mercie moue your mind:
