            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

¶To the ryght worshypfull Master Iohn
Ramsay, lorde priour of Merton, Thomas
Paynell, chanon of Merton
sendeth gretynge.
            
               THis lyttell and fruitfull boke,
as you of your moste gentylle
nature, desyred me your obedient,
I haue translated into
englyshe, I feare some wyll
say, moche more gladly than counnyngly,
and that my wyll was farre more redy thā
my wytte: but howe soo euer I haue done,
if it may please your lordshyp, I holde me
well payde: for not only in this, but in all
other thinges, my desyre is, to do that, that
may be acceptable to your good mynde: other
that be lerned, &amp; lyke not my trāslation,
may sette it forthe in englyshe
more eloquently, and
so do bothe great profyte
and pleasure
to many one.
            Thus
god preserue your lordshyp
in good helthe.
         
      
      
         
            
            The compar. of a Vir. and Mar.
ERASMVS ROTERO. TO
the venerable colledge of vyrgins Machabeticas
at Coleyne, sendeth gretynge
in Christ Iesu, the sonne
a vyrgin, and Crowne
of all vyrgyns.
            
               YOVR DEVOVT
myndes good virgyns
doo ofte tymes
prouoke me,
with youre delycate
and swete p̄
               sentes,
that I shoulde by somme
maner of writynge, not onely celebrate
and laude your most precyouse
treasure, but also extolle
and cōmende vnto you, your intent
and purpose. In the tone ye
be ledde by a certayne relygious
desyre, sekynge nothynge els but
the glorye of god, the whyche in
his sayntis is very glorious: In

In the tother I perceyue ye seke
for spiritualle gayne, with your
pleasaunt and swete gyftes, delytynge
the mouthe, diligently labourynge
to opteyne of me those
thynges, that fede the sowle: this
is a very deuout captation, a holy
desyre, a ryght wyse and gaynfull
chaunge, and mooste comely
and seemely for wyse virgins: yf
I were the man that coude bring
forthe any thynge oute of the secrete
coffers of holy Scripture,
that might in like maner refreshe
your myndes, as your giftes and
presentes do refresshe my bodye.
You erre not in youre affeccyon,
but you faylle in youre election:
you loue that that is beste, but
you chose not him, that can satisfie
your holy desyres. And yet bicause
you shal not thynke me vtterly

vnkynde, I do not a lyttell
reioyce, to see in you (chosen virgyns
of god) this good mynde,
that is, thyrstynge nothynge els
but the glory of your spouse. For
it is an euident and a sure token
of a chast wyfe, to recken her husbandes
glory her owne. For truly
he, vnto whom you are specyally
spoused, is aboue al the children
of men the moste goodlyest,
and in all his actes and dedes he
is the moste glorious: Though
oone wolde contemplate and beholde
on euery syde the wonderfull
frame of this world, yet shall
he fynde hym more gloryouse in
the redemynge of the worlde, thā
in makynge therof.Gen. 1. He made the
worlde, and the hole company of
aungelles with tournynge of an
hande: but with his precyouse

bloudde he redemed that that he
made. The same wisedome, whiche
is Christe Iesus, and whiche
also is the wonderfull werkman
of this worke, to thentēt to make
a thynge more meruayllous, by
dyuine crafte he edified a howse
eternall, and a temple worthy for
god, that is the Churche, whiche
he as a kynge moste ryche, dydde
freshly garnishe and ornate with
all maner of spiritual ornamentis.
For what is golde, syluer, yuory,
what is the smaragde, the
Topase, the beryll, or the variable
shynynge of precious stones,
cōparring them to the rich giftis
of the holye ghooste, whiche are
prophecy, the gyfte of tongues,
the vertue of working myracles,
and the curynge of infyrmities,
peace, puritie, charitie, and sufferance?

This holle Edifice, made
of lyuely stones, with a wonderfull
agrement couched together,
ryseth vp to heuen,Act. 4. Christ beinge
the very corner stone, knyttethe
fast to gyther al the hole frame, yt
it can neither fall in ruyn nor decay.
These stones are the dyuers
orders of saynctis.Pro. 3. In this Temple
he reioyceth to dwell, lyke as
he saythe in an other place: My
delectacyons are to be with the
sonnes of men. He this magnyfycent
Salomon glorifieth hym
selfe in these rychesses: he is noo
where more meruayllous, noo
where more glorious, than in his
saynctis: to whom he hath vouchesafed
this honoure, to make
them his own membres: and acceptynge
them as his bretherne,
to make theym heires with hym

of the heuenly kyngedome. He
dyed for al: but yet his most glorye
and pleasure is in the bendis
of Martyrs, and in the companyes
of vyrgyns. These are the
most precious Iewels, of which
the churche of Christe dothe soo
stately auaunce her selfe of, the
whiche woteth nat wherof to glorye,
but in the onely gyftes of her
spowse. For what so euer thynge
is glorious in saynctis, the same
is the gyfte of Christe. O good
virgins, the delectations and ornamentis
of your spouse, are dyuerse
and variable. whā he goth
forth, he is beset about with sondrye
precious vertues, and with
innumerable kyndes of flowers:
but the rosis of martyrs, and lylyes
of virgins, do mooste specially
please aud delyte hym. And

no meruayl, though he loue that
that he is hym selfe, ye wherof he
is the very fountayne to al other.
I am (sayth he) Flos campi,
               Cant. 2. the flower
of the felde, and the lylie of
the valeyes. He is the prynce of
martyrs, for throughe hym martyrs
are myghty and stronge. He
is the chiefe capitain of virgins,
for by him virgins do subdue the
flesshe, and the desyres thereof.
After that he descended downe to
the erthe, and hadde spredde abrode
the fyre of charitie, wynter
passed away, and these freshe flowers
sprouted vp euery where in
our countreye. Howe scarse was
virginitie before? But after that
Christe had ones consecrate virginitie,
howe many thousandes
of yong men and women sprang
vp sodaynly through out all the

worlde, whiche wyllyngly gaue
them selfes to pure chastitie for
the kyngdom of god? After that
he, suffringe dethe on the crosse,
hadde taughte, that they were
very happye, that wolde dye for
goddis sake, howe many swarmes
of men &amp; women came forth,
that wyllyngely yea and gladly
suffered deathe for the glorye of
Christe? Doutlesse for this cause
it is, that your spouse glorieth in
the Cantycles, where he saythe
thus, Ryse vp, haaste you my svvete
loue and my fayre dooue, and come. For
novve vvynter is paste, the shoure is
goone, oure grounde is couered vvith
fresshe floures.
            
            ¶Howe barrayne shoulde our
erth haue ben, if he the same heuenly
sonne had not kendled our
hartis with ye hete his Charytie?

if he had not watred our mindes
with the showre of his grace?
            But what flourisheth fayrer then
the Euangelicall veer? What is
more plentyfulle? what is more
louely? The rosis ruddy hewe abydeth
not longe, the beautie of
the lilye fadeth soone, wheron a
certayne Pagane writeth thus:

                  Neyther smallage is lyuely,
                  Nor yet the shorte Lylie.
               
But those fresshe flowers, with
which the Churche is plentifully
furnyshed, do neuer wyther away.
For Christe is the immortal
lylie, &amp; gyueth immortall grace
to his lylyes. He is the Rose immortall,
whose fresshe and fayre
colour dothe neuer fade, and the
same perpetuitie he gyueth vnto
his. He is called Flos campi, that is
the flower of the felde, bycause of

the Iewes. Fieldes be apte and
mete for tillage. Amonge the Iewes
he was dyed with his owne
precious bloude, the whiche Iewes
Moyses and other prophettes
dydde eare and tylle, yet they
coude neuer cause them to bryng
forth suche fruites as they loked
fore. He was the lylie of the Ualleis
amonge the thorny and vntylled
gentiles, to whom it is perswaded,
that he became man, and
was borne of the Uirgin Marie
without spotte of synne. Surely
he was the euangelicall lilie, that
god the father so clothed, as neuer
Salomon was arrayed in al
his great glory. For why, neither
Salomon, nor yet none other,
was euer borne of a pure virgin,
defyled with no spotte of the fyrst
parent. Who so euer couple them

selfe by feyth to this lilie, bycause
they are made one fleshe and one
spirite with hym, they are pourged
from fylthy synnes, they receyue
the fayre white garment of
innocency, and be also made Lylies.
For so in the same place folowynge
saythe the spowse,Cant. 2. that
nameth hym self a lilie: Lyke as
the lylie is amonge thornes, so is
my loue amonge the doughters.
what thyng els is the lily amōge
thornes? but a virgyne amonge
wyues.
            ¶Matrymonye is an honeste
thynge, but it is besette aboute
with briers and thornes. For suche
as be maried, saythe Paule,1. Cor. 7.
shall haue trybulacyons of the
fleshe. If any man doubte, whether
matrimonye haue thornes,
lette hym enquere of maried women,

what greate grefes she endureth,
that hath to her husbāde
a frowarde felowe, a drunkarde,
a dycer, an aduoutrer, a waster,
what dysplesures growe of kinsfolke,
and what of wycked chyldrē,
and than (if he thinke it best)
lette hym denye a virgyn to be a
lylie amonge thornes? A virgyn
being free from the cares of this
worlde, myndeth those thynges
that perteyne to our lorde, howe
she maye please hym: She that
is maried, as it were hyther and
thyther haled and plucked with
dyuers and sondry cares, setteth
her mynde on many thynges.
            Surely all they that haue taken
on theym to folowe Christe, are
lylies, but specially virgyns. Amonge
them he the marueylous
spouse fedeth and taketh his delyte,

whyche is not enterteyned
with euery body.Cant. 2. He is my deere
derlyng and I his, which fedeth
amonge the lilies, vntyll the day
breake, and tyll the shadowes be
gone. Suche flowers he gathereth,
that he may make of them
a garlande that neuer wythereth
away in heuen: lyke as it is said
in an nother place:Cant. 2. My loue is
goone downe into his gardeyne,
vnto the swete smellinge beddes,
that he may refresshe him selfe in
the gardayns, and gather lilies.
Trewely of those lylies speaketh
the wyse man sayenge,Eccl. 39. Florisshe
you flowers as doth the lilie, and
gyue sweete sauour, and spredde
out your bowes in grace, singe a
songe of prayse, and blesse you
oure lorde in his workes. The
spouse beynge a vyrgyn, delyteth

in virgins songes. This is
the newe songe, that the Synagoge
knewe not, in the which she
was cursed, that brought forthe
no children. But there are in the
gospell innumerable, that synge
a newe songe, whiche were redemed
from the erthe, and called in
to the felowshyp of aungels, bycause
that they neyther mary nor
defyle theym selfe with women,Apoc. 14.
but folowe the lambe, whither so
euer he gothe, and are withoute
spotte before the throne of god.
            There be many withoute spot in
the syghte of men, but happy are
they that appere suche before the
throne of god: happye are they,
which to the laude of theyr newe
spouse, doo synge a newe songe,
inwardly reioysyng, and to them
selfe demeanyng great gladnes,

that they being pure and chaste,
do singe pure and cleane balades
in honour of their pure and clene
spowse. And ofte tymes your
quier to their spouse singeth this
melodious songe:
            
               ¶O IESV the Crowne of vyrgins,
whom she thy mother conceyued,
whiche alone a virgyne
dyd beare, accept o moste mekest
these our vowes.
            ¶O what greatte purytie is in
this virgin, he the prince of virgins,
and spowse and crowne of
virgins, was cōceyued of the heuenly
spirite, and borne of a vyrgin,
the glorious beautie of vyrgynite
not broken. Of wyues the
husbonde is the glory, but of virgins
Chryste is the glorye: The
whiche dothe fede among lilyes,
compassed aboute with crownes

of virgyns, hyghtynge and adournynge
his spowses with glorie,
and yeldynge to them rewardes.
Your spowse is a sheparde,
which gaue his life for his shepe,
and is yet stylle carefulle for his
flocke. For daily he saueth them,
dayly he calleth theym hoome ageyne
that straye abrode, dayely
he cureth, and dayely he feedeth
theym. He hathe also his delectations,
in whiche he taketh plesure,
he hathe his neere felowes,
whome he calleth husbandes, he
hath his playfeeres yonge maydens,
whome he calleth wyues.
            In spiritual thynges there is no
difference of sexes, but they are
named and called after theyr age
and merites. Christ hath but one
spouse, whiche is the churche, she
hath many to accompanye her, &amp;

euery one of them maye be called
a spouse. The spouse selfe is but
one, and yet hath he somme, that
he derely loueth, to whom he cō
               mytteth
his wyues, soo that they
also in maner may be called husbandes.
For if byshoppes mowe
rightously be called shepherdes,
sythe there is but one shepeherde
our lorde Iesus, what shall than
lette them to be called husbādes.
The wyues of this worlde, are
stately and proude of the gyftes
and dignitie of their husbandes,
they shewe and booste their gaye
garmentes and fresshe araye, for
such as haue no husbandes seme
as persones forsaken and destytute.
But the spowse Iesus, for
the despised ornamentes of this
worlde, doth gaily hight and adourne
his spowses with doweries

of the sowle: for the glorie of
the fleshe, whiche so soone vanysheth
away, he gyueth them immortall
glorie. Trewely to those
spouses, whiche folowynge the
example of the high shepeherde,
and lyke valyant champyons in
defence of his flocke, doo not refuse
to dye, he gyueth rewardes.
what rewardes? not a garlande
of oken leaues, or of laurell, not
an image, or a title, or some other
lyke rewarde, that the worlde
for dedes worthily done is wont
to gyue in recompence: but a garlande
euermore freshe and flourysshynge
in heuen, and a name
wryten in the booke of lyfe, that
neuer shall be blotted out by noo
age. This delitious and plesant
spouse, delyteth most specially in
this company, which for all that,

lotheth no wel disposed person, be
he neuer so poore.
            ¶There foloweth in the forsaid
hymne. Whyther soo euer thou
goest, virgins do folowe the, and
with laudes syngynge runne styl
after the, and with theyr sweete
songes make pleasant noyse. Cō
               cernyng
the fashion of the world
it is an vncomely thinge, to see a
virgyn wyllyngely rounne after
her spowse. But it were a fowler
syght, to see many virgins folow
one spouse. In thingis touching
the soule, it is otherwise, for there
is nothyng more goodly, then to
se many many virgins, that nere
accompany one spouse Iesu. Nor
it is noo meruayle, if they runne
after hym, as they were woode,
for loue of their spouse. For he allurethe
theym to hym by secrete

intycementes, whose louelynesse
passeth all humayne loue.Psal. 44. He is
the feyrest among the children of
men, flowynge full of grace are
his lyppes, the whose vysage to
beholde angels esteme most high
felycytie. He breatheth with his
swete smellyng sauors on whom
he wolle, and they on whome he
breatheth say:Cant. 1. Drawe me after
the, and we shall renne in the odour
of thy swete smelling oyntmentes.
They can not renne, excepte
they be drawen: they canne
not loue, excepte they be fyrste loued:
And they that be alredy drawen,
desyre to be more plentifully
drawen: they that rūne, couer
to rūne so fast, that they may approche
yet more nere to hym that
they loue. Trewely they felte and
perceyued his lyppes to flowe

full of grace, the whiche saye:Ioan. 6. O
lorde whither shall we goo? thou
haste the wordes of euerlastynge
lyfe. Al they that ꝓfesse the name
of Christe, folowe theyr sheparde
Iesus: but they al onely his vnseperable
feres, do folowe whyther
so euer he woll goo: they folow
hym euen to the very beatinges,
they folowe him euen to the
very persecution.
            ¶Our lorde Iesus, what tyme
he was in this world, ofte tymes
ledde after hym greate and huge
multitudes of al sortis of people:
but whan he shulde go to Hierusalem
to be slayn, fewe dyd accō
               panye
hym, but yet fewer, whan
he bearynge his Crosse, went towarde
the Mount of Caluerey.
But they which be the very felowes
of the spouse, whiche be true

virgins, coude not at this poynt
be plucked frome theyr spowse.
When he hynge vpon the crosse,
Peter, whiche was thoughte to
haue a wyfe, coulde no where be
founde, but the vyrgyns, Mary
the mother of Iesu and Iohn̄, abode
faste by the crosse, the other
women stoode afarre of, and behelde
what was doone. They folow
then, ye and that gladly and
wyllyngly: nor they folowe hym
not as dumme persons, but syngynge
balades, and makynge
swete melody.
            ¶They that be mennes wyues
haue no leysure to be in the dances,
they haue no leysure, no many
tymes they haue noo luste to
synge: they muste please theyr
husbandes, they must chyde and
braule with theyr maides and seruantes,

&amp; chastise theyr children.
Our virgins, being free from all
care and thought of this worlde,
do nothynge els, but in spiritual
quiers, synge swete hymmes to
theyr spouse. For they ascribe nothynge
to them selfe, but gyue al
the glory of theyr felicitie to him,
to whom onely they owe al thynges.
He this louer deliteth in suche
maner songes, he wol, he wol
his gyftes to be songe: he hateth
the phariseis songis, I fast twise
in the Saboth, I gyue the .x. of
my goodes to the pore, I am not
as other men be. The more chast
that a virgin is, the more shamefaste
she is. Here the voyce of a
very virgin:Luc. 1. Beholde the handmayde
of our lorde. And he hath
sene the humilitie of his handemayde.
In the cantycles he calleth

his spouse a douue. He desirethe
to beholde her shappe, and
coueteth to here her voyce:Cant. 2. Come
sayth he, my douue out of the caues
of the rockes, out of the holes
of the walle: O lette me see
thy vysage, and here thy voyce,
for swete is thy voyce, and fayre
is thy face. The soule hath his
face. The face is moste specially
estemed and iudged by the eies:
with the eies we shewe &amp; declare
our intēt: also with the eies with
out voyce we signifie the inward
affections of our myndes. The
eie of a vyrgin is symple, she enuyeth
not, she lyeth not in awayt
to disceyue, she suspectethe none
yuell, she myndeth not yll. The
face of suche oone delytethe the
spouse,Can. 2. which a lyttell after sayth
thus: Howe fayre arte thou my

loue, howe fayre art thou? Thou
haste douues eies.
            ¶Here some wyll saye, What
swetenes is in the complaynyng
and mourning voyce of a douue,
to delyte and please a man with?
The nyghtyngales voyce shulde
rather be called to this parable
and similitude. The rare and vehemente
loue maketh contynualle
complayntes, but yet pleasant
and moste acceptable to the
spouse. Here a lamentyng douue:
I desyre to be lowsed,Phil. 1. and to be
with Christ.Rom. 7. And ageyne: O wretched
man that I am, who shall
delyuer me from the body of this
deathe? Harken what an other
douue saythe, Wo is me,Psal 119. that I
dwel so long in this world.Psal. 136. And,
By the waters of Babylon we
sate downe and wepte, whan we

remembred the Syon.
            ¶These lamentable voices and
ful of sighynges, are most acceptable
in the eares of the spouse,
in such maner of songes he moch
delyteth.
            ¶And bycause they sayd, O mercyfull
lorde accepte our vowes, it
is tyme, that they nowe expresse
and declare, what they wold opteyn
of theyr spouse: Is it richesses,
is it honours, is it pleasures,
is it a kyngdome, is it long lyfe?
For those thinges care haue they
none, for ye vehemēt loue of their
spouse hath vtterly broughte thē
to despise those thinges. What is
it than? we praye the, encreace
our myndes yet more largely, &amp;
graunt, that we mowe vtterly be
ignorant of all corruption. They
aknowlege howe great a tresure

vyrgynitie is, that is, A cleane
mynde in a bodye vncorrupte.
They also aknowlege, that what
so euer he hath gyuen theym, he
wol vouchsafe to encreace it, and
to heape benefyte vpon benefyte.
Noo vyrgyn is soo pure, whiche
hath not, wherby she may yet
profite. For you shall scasely find
any virgin, whiche to thende the
body maye be vndefyled, offendeth
not otherwhile in thought.
Nor trewe virginitie resteth not
only in the gyft of chastitie, but
all vyce of the mynde is the corruption
of this virginitie. Who
soo euer swarueth from the true
feyth catholyke, his virginitie is
defiled.2. Cor. 11. Of this purenesse speaketh
Paule, writynge to the Corinthees:
I haue maried you vnto
one man, to bring a chaste virgine

vnto Christe: But I feare,
leste as the serpente begiled Eue
with his wylynesse, euen so your
wyttes shulde be corrupted from
the simplenes, which is in Christ
Iesu.
            
            ¶A vyrgin defyled with enuye,
backbityng, arrogancie, is woū
               ded
with corruption: Therfore
they pray, that theyr most munificent
spouse woll vouchesafe to
augment the gyftes that he hath
gyuen theym, and that he wolle
graunte them to be vtterly ignoraunt
of all woundes of corruption.
why saye they vtterly?
That is nother in mynde nor in
body. what is to say of all? what
soo euer the humayne affection
doth moue and styre vs to. This
vowe or request might seme vnreasonable,
ne were it that the

spowse is almyghty, and mooste
faythfull of his promyse. He wol
not that his shal be only lyke vnto
hym, but also he woll them to
be the selfe same. But let vs admytte,
that no manne in this lyfe
can atteine to that, that the quier
of vyrgins dothe desyre, yet the
request of this moste thankefull
quire shall not be made in vayn.
For that that they here throughe
fauour of their spowse are mindfulle
of, shall in the resurrection
chance them fully through theyr
spouses augmentynge.
            There are degrees in the Churche
milytant, and soo there be in
the churche triumphant. I wote
not whether I haue taryed you
longer than I shulde haue done
in declarynge this hymne: Truly
I repent me not, syth it is saynte

Ambroses. For besyde all other
argumentis, the word of thre syllables
in the ende of euery dimeter,
sheweth who is the authour.
wherin I suppose that man had
not so moche pleasure in the concent
of the meter, as he delyted in
the symbole of of the holye Trinitie.
The churche the spouse of
Christe hath many hymnes, but
I wote nat whether there be any
that sing with more ioy and gladnes
of al persons, than they, whiche
celebrate the spouse in the victories
of Martirs, or triumphes
of virgins.
            ¶But nowe to retourne againe
to those two flowers, farre passynge
all other most fragant, the
Rose and the Lilie. Lyke as the
deathe of Christe with his swete
odour drew many to the contēpt

and despysynge of this lyfe: soo
the virginitie of Christe allured
many a one to the loue of chastitie.
They that ar drawen of him,
beinge nowe theym selues made
flowers, haue drawen other.
            Christe sayde to Peter: Folowe
me.Ioan. 21. Howe manye haue folowed
Peter? Who denyeth, but that we
be moche bounde to the holy doctours,
the whiche (euery thynge
beynge in peace and reste) haue
taught vs the way of our lorde?
But how many mo hath the fragraunt
swetenes of the martyrs,
drawen to the professyon of the
gospell? Yea howe many mo the
example of virgins? It is a gret
thynge, boldely and connyngely
to dispute of the gospelle: But
the greattest poynte is, gladly to
dye for the gospell. It is a great

thynge, to despise and set nought
by the glorye and ryches of this
worlde, but it is farre greatter to
mortifie and slee the fleshe with
the concupiscencis thereof. And
the churche knoweth to whome
she is bounde. The churche (next
Christ) hath had none in more honour,
than they, which wyllyngly
and gladly offred theyr bodies
to be cruelly turmented, for the
glorie of their spouse, and for sauation
of the flocke, for the whiche
he hym selfe vouchesafed to
dye. They secondarily were had
in honour, whiche wyllyngly for
the kyngdome of god gaue them
selfe holly to lyue chaste. what a
great ioye and gladnes was it to
all the Churche, whan a martyr
constantly suffred dethe for Christis
sake? And howe great sorow

and lamentation, if any shranke
backe. Agayne, Howe greattely
dyd the churche reioyce, if a virgin,
that myght haue bē maried
to a man, wold rather put on the
holy vaile of chastite, and couple
her selfe to her spowse Chryste?
And how great sorowe was there
made, if any suche dydde caste of
her vayle, and wolde be maryed
to a man? Undoubted the losse of
a thynge, that is most dere, is very
greuous. with what feruente
loue dydde christen men in tyme
paste runne to the ashes of Martyrs?
Howe holy was the memorie
of them amonge all chrysten
men, whan dayly olde men, yong
men, honest matrones, and virgins,
runne thycke and threfolde
to the prysones, as it were vnto
places consecrate to god: whan

they wold kys the cheynes, with
whiche they were bounde: whan
the swerde, with which they were
martered, was reserued and kept
amonge the holy relykes? What
memorie is more ioyfull, &amp; more
hye and holy to the churche, than
of Martyrs? Whan do menne
synge with greatter gladnesse,
than in their yerely feastis? The
whose afflictions and peynes the
churche calleth vyctoryes, theyr
turmentes triumphes, theyr deathes
byrthes: nor in theyr celebratiōs
is no maner mournyng,
but all thynges full of ioye, fulle
of gratulation, full of preysing,
full of myrth and sporte. Nor the
eloquence of excellent lerned mē
hath ben more shewed or set forth
in any argument, than in celebrating
the laude and prayse of martyrs

and virgins. Herein Prudē
               tius,
in the kynd of verses called
Liricum carmen, exceded the greate
eloquēce of Pindarus, he passed
the elegancy of Horace, not possisyble
to be folowed. Herein the
trumpe bothe of the grekes and
latyns, soundeth out I wote not
what farre greatter and more diuine
than verse heroical. In this
argumente, Chrysostomus, Cyprianus,
Ambrosius, Hieronymus,
and many mo then can be
nombred, excell Ciceros aboundaunt
and flowynge style. What
thynge maye we coniecte to be
the cause? Truly the magnitude
of the martyrs dyd minister abū
               dāce
of eloquence, the feruētnes
of theyr myndes added strengthe
to theyr wordes, and deuotion alacritie.
Of what matter so euer

they write, theyr style is plentiful
and flowyng, But as oft as they
take in hande to endyte of martyrs
and virgins, now as it were
by diuine inspiration, they sowne
out, I wote not what thing farre
passynge mans capacitie. Those
thynges are not doone by mans
studye, but they are broughte to
passe by inspiration of the holye
goste, the whiche woll his saynctes
to be so glorified, in the whiche
he desyrously gothe about to
be seen most glorious. We wold
graunt those thynges to be done
by man, ne were it that god (whiche
inspireth the mindes of good
men) doth ornate the monumentes
of martyrs and virgins with
so manifold myracles. For where
are wycked spirytes more tourmented?
where are moo cured of

greuous sycknesses and diseases
that no phisitions coude heale?
            What emperour, what kynge is
he, with settynge vp of any images,
titles, steples, churches, collegis,
commandyng diuine worshyppes,
dyd opteyne so greatte
honour ye in this world? Doubtlesse
thus god dothe honour his
martyrs, the whiche semed here
poore abiectes and wretched caytyues.
Thus he honourethe his
vyrgyns, the whiche beynge as
deed to the worlde, sette surely al
theyr holle hope in theyr spowse
Iesu. And they also aknowlege,
that what so euer they haue, cometh
all of the lyberall gyfte of
theyr spouse. But the glorye of
martyrs doth not lyghtly glytter
and shyne but after the deathe:
            where as virginitie euen in this

lyfe is ful gay and glorious. For
who is so barbarous, that wyll
not fauour a virgin? In the very
myddes of the ruffelynge warres
the fierce and cruell ennemy
forbeareth virginitie. And if we
beleue histories, the dumme beastis,
ye the hugest, the wyldest, &amp;
most cruell of them all, beare reuerence
vnto vyrgynitie. Howe
greatly dydde the Romaynes in
olde tyme honour the relygious
virgyns, called virgines vestales?
what a naturall worshyppe and
glorie of virginitie is that, whiche
ydolaters do aknowlege, whiche
the barbarous ennemy dothe
reuerence, which the dumme beastis
doo perceyue, and to whiche
the wylde beastis obeye? If soo
great honour be done to the vyrgins
of this worlde, howe moche

more honorable is the virgin of
Christe? O good vyrgyne, take
on the this holy pride, and repute
what so euer pleasures or honors
this world braggeth of, to be far
vnder thy dignitie. It is a holye
thyng to pride in your spowse, &amp;
a deuout thyng to glorie in him,
to whome you owe all thynges.
            It is also a sure thynge, trusting
faythfully in hym, to rise and rebelle
agaynst the worlde, whiche
braggyngly shewethe forthe his
delectable pleasures. My mynd
is not at this tyme to write, what
so euer may be sayde in the laude
and praise of martirs or virgins.
You haue the bokes of Cyprian,
you haue the bokes of Ambrose,
of Tertullian and Hierome, of
which the two last, were wel nere
ouermoch in admiration of virginitie.

For the excellency of virginitie
wolde not soo be extolled,
that the preyse therof shoulde be
an iniurie to chaste matrimonie.
I recyte those thinges moste noble
vyrgins for this intente, that
you maye perceyue howe happy
and fortunate your College is,
the whose chaunce is to possesse
bothe those thynges, whiche she
the rich spouse of Christ the churche
holdeth moste speciall in this
worlde. For you haue in kepyng
those mooste fragrant and swete
coses, of the .vii. brethern of the
Machabees, and of theyr mother,
ye whose fecunditie brought
forth no children to her husband
but to god, she fortunately redoubed
ye losse of her virginitie, with
the martyrdome of so many sonnes
vyrgyns. She being a virgin

brought forth no frute, for yt of al
women was giuē but to one, but
yet she brought forthe bothe virgins
and martirs. Of her self she
coude gyue none example of virginitie,
but she perfourmed and
dyd as moch as laye in her to do.
She taughte her chyldren to be
virgins, she exhorted thē to martyrdome,
and wolde haue suffred
martyrdome before theym, saue
that she feared their constancye,
by reason of their tender youthe.
And soo the glorie of vyrginitie
chanced not to the mother alyke
with the chyldern, but touchyng
the martyrdome, the laude of the
mother is soo moche the more, in
that she beholdynge the cruelle
turmentes, suffred in eche of her
lyttel chyldren, what soo euer the
cruell tourmentours coude do to

the bodies of them. This is more
stronger, then by turmentyng at
ones to be rydde from all peyne.
For the parētes are more cruelly
tourmented in the persecutynge
of their chylderne than in theym
selfe. And that knowethe ryghte
well the wytty crueltie of tyrantes,
which wreste out by turmentyng
of the chyldren in theyr parentes
sighte, that they coude by
no maner of turmentes gette of
the parentes. Howe oft sawe she
beynge a woman and a mother,
her owne fleshe and bowels torrē
and rente to pieces? where was
nowe the feble freiltie of yt kynd?
where was the tender loue and
pitie that is wont to be more vehement
in mothers then in men?
Surely her deuout affection to
godwarde, ouercame al humain

pitie, and her feruent feythe ouercame
the feblenes of womanhed.
All hayle mooste happy virago,
whiche haste gyuen exaumple of
fortitude to all menne. All hayle
moste fayre lyttell floures of the
churche, whiche as rype delycacyes
before your tyme, you haue
preuented the springe tyde of the
gospell, and haue made a shewe
of euangelycal vertue, before the
gospell was shewed or knowen
to the worlde. For as yet this
voyce of hym, which being a virgin,
is borne of a virgin, was not
harde,Mat. 19. Blessed be they, that haue
gyuen them selfe to lyue in chastitie
for the kyngedome of god,
And yet the same prayse you by
preuention haue opteyned afore
hande.Mar. 16. Nor this was not as yet
harde,Mar. 8. who so wil be my disciple,

lette hym take vp his crosse and
folowe me, but you as fore runners,
dydde adumbrate Christis
passion. And nowe your sowles
in heuen doo folowe the lambe,
whither so euer he goeth: But as
for your vndefiled bodies (whiche
were partners of your tourmentes
and peynes, so in tyme to
come you shall receyue theym to
the felowshyp of euerlastyng felicitie)
there was noo place more
comely nor more conueniente to
kepe them in, than in a holy college
of virgins.
            ¶Nowe to you good vyrgyns,
that be the kepers of this so gret
a treasure, my wordes do theym
adresse. You haue in these yonge
children both an example of chastite,
which you ought to folow, &amp;
a crowne of martyrdome, that

you shoulde extolle, gloryfienge
your spouse, which stroue in thē,
whiche in them gote the victorie,
whiche in them dothe triumphe.
He hath in one self basket Lylies
myngled with roses. The bryght
beautie of the tone stryueth with
the tother, nor yet the tone is not
dusked or defaced of the tother:
but ye tone by reason the tother is
with him, doth ye more gaily glitter
and shyne, lyke as whan yuory
(as one sayd) is myngled with
purpull, or whan a shynyng precyous
stone is set in yolow gold.
The stryfe is so doubtefull, whether
is more glorious a martir or
a virgin, that if the matter shuld
be called in contention, I dare
not boldly say, whiche of theym
shoulde be preferred the tone before
the tother. Bothe the tone

and the tother are consecrate in
Christ: but yet we ar more boūde
to his crosse and passion, than to
his virginite. He giueth to them
the honorable title of blessednes,
whiche for the kyngdome of god
gyue them selfe to lyue in chastitie:
but yet he requirethe the folowynge
of the crosse. It semeth
a greatter thyng, that whā he requireth
it not, yet it maketh him
blessed, that wyllyngly wyll perfourme
it. And in the tyme of persecution
it is a right gret thinge,
for the glorye of god to haue the
mynde alwey prompte and redy
to suffre all kyndes of deathes.
            But tymes haue like as the See
hath, his tranquillities and quiete
caumes. And other while one
maye lefully escape the persecuters
handes. But if one be dryuen

to the last extremitie, the deathe
of the body is the ende of greuous
tourmentes, and the beginnynge
of felicitie. A virgin hath
a longe and a parpetuall stryfe
with her housholde ennemie, the
whiche she can neyther laufullye
slee, nor escape by flyghte. This
housholde fooe is the fleshe, the
whiche whether we woll or woll
not, we muste carie about, nowe
and then rebellynge agaynst the
spirite. And that it shal not seme
easye to any man to subdue this
ennemie, we haue redde of those
that were ouercome with wanton
entycementes of the flesshe,
the whiche coude not be vanquyshed
with the verye terrour and
drede of dethe.
            ¶Hytherto our collation hathe
pondered, whether of those two

shulde be more stronger: but me
semeth that virginitie in this, is
ye happier, that (as I by occasyon
sayde afore) the floure of martirdome,
doth not freshely sprede &amp;
florishe, but after deathe: where
as virginitie hathe her bryghte
beautie, her fayre fragrancy, her
grace and dignitie in this world.
Uirgynytie is the flower of the
sowle and mynde, but in the vysage,
in the eyes, and in all the
holle state of the body, there shyneth
a certayne angelicall purenesse,
and a flourysshynge clerenesse,
not acqueynted with olde
age, here as it were myndynge &amp;
thynkynge to be, that all we loke
fore after this lyfe, whyche lyue
deuoutely and godly in Chryste
Iesu. The mynde holle and vncorrupte
sparpleth abrode in the

bodye her vigour and strengthe,
lyke as the mynde infecte with
vices sheweth in maner a glimerynge
lighte, or rather maketh a
grisely shewe in the selfe shappe
of the body. For carnall pleasure
is a fowle blemyshe to a mannes
owne body. Why doo not the bodyes
of good blessed menne waxe
olde in the resurrection? bycause
nowe the soule shall rule theym,
which woteth not what olde age
meaneth. As deathe commeth of
synne, so doth syckenes and age.
Take synne away, and age shall
seme the lesse: and if age chaunce
to come, it shal chaunce more florishinge.
And therfore a virgyn
receyuethe nowe in this worlde
some parte of her felicitie, exhybytynge
in this mortall bodye a
certayne spece or fachion of the

immortalitie to come. The princis
of this worlde are noo moore
careful for theyr souldiours, than
they be for the thynge that they
come of, of the which whan nede
requireth, they gather yong soul
dyours, the whyche thynge if it
shulde fayle, howe shoulde they
furnysshe an armye? And nowe
for a certayne yeres there hathe
ben noo suche persecution vnder
christen princis, as was vsed in
tyme paste vnder Nero, Domitian,
Iulian, and Maxentius.
            But whether the Christen feythe
be in better caase vnder these or
noo, it lyeth not in me to define,
surely by them it was drawen into
a narrowe poynt. But how so
euer it be, if there shulde ageyne
chaunce persecution, the whyche
wolde require a martyr, where is

it more lykely that such a cōpany
shulde be gathered, than of them
the whiche despisynge al the fals
flatering vanities of this world,
haue cōsecrate theym selfes holly
to Iesu the celestiall spouse, the
which wyllyngly haue crucified
their fleshe to gether with the vicis
and concupiscencis thereof,
and for the loue of theyr spouse,
haue contempned and sette atte
noughte that same pleasure, for
the fauour of whiche only many
mortall menne desiren euermore
here to lyue. A true virgyn doth
differre very lyttell from a martyr.
A martir suffreth the executioner
to mangle his fleshe: a virgin
dayly dothe with good wyll
mortifie her fleshe, she beinge in
maner a turmentour of her selfe.
It is somewhat more maystry to

tame an ennemye taken, than to
kyl him. A martyr deliuereth his
body to be persecuted: A virgin
kepethe her body in lowe subiection,
and maketh it obedient vnto
the spirite. wherfore shall the
virgin of Christ trēble and feare
the handlyng of the executioner?
Shall she require rychesses, delycacies,
worldly pompe, worldly
welthe, or worldly pleasures,
whiche causen other to be verye
lothe to leaue this lyfe? All these
thinges she hath now cleane forsaken.
Shall nat she, whiche loueth
nothing in this world, whiche
is deed to the worlde, whose
lyfe is onely Christe, which dayly
maketh her turtyls mournynges,
couetynge to be nerer ioyned
to her dere beloued spouse, &amp;
to be imbraced &amp; clypped of hym,

wil she not (I say) gladly deꝑt out
of this wretched body, in the whiche
she woteth wel she trauayleth
as a pilgrim farre from her lord?
what men haue suffred the tourmentes
of martyrdom more meruailously
and strongly than virgine
Martyrs, Agnes, Cecilia,
Agatha, and other theyr felowes
innumerable? And therfore whā
a virgin is delyuered to the executioner,
she dothe not begynne
her martyrdome, but makethe
an ende of that that she beganne
longe before. If those thynges
seeme to any manne ouer harde
hyghe and difficile, lette hym remembre,
that the professyon of
a virgin is aboue the powers of
man, and egall with the dignite
of angels. But al they that weare
blacke vayles, are not virgins.

For lyke as they (accordynge to
saynte Paules doctryne) whiche
are true wydowes in dede,1. Timo. 5. be discerned
frome those, whiche by a
wronge name are called wydowes:
and as that widowe, whych
lyueth in delytes of this worlde,
is sayde to be deade: ryght soo a
virgin, whiche loueth any other
thynge in this worlde thanne her
spouse, is not a virgin. There ar
in the gospel wyse vyrgins,Mat. 25. whiche
by manifolde workes of mercy
and pitie, haue so prouided for
them selfe, that oyle in theyr lā
               pes
shall not fayle: there are in
like maner folysshe virgins. And
Hieremie bewayleth such vnwise
virgins:Tren. 1. for the dignitie of this
name is nothing mete and agreable
for her, the which although
her body hath not ben touched of

man, yet her mynde hath ben defiled
and spotted with filthy and
vncleane thoughtes. She that
lyueth syngle agaynste her wyll,
is maried: and she that wolde be
corrupted, if she might lefully, is
alredy corrupted. It is a thinge
of greattest difficultie, to represse
and kepe downe all cogitations
and inwarde thynkynges of a
wauering mynd: and yet ageinst
them assaylynge, there muste be
defence made with prayers, redynge
of holy bokes, fastynges,
deuoute and godly occupations:
for why to assent to them is very
poyson. Eua the fyrste virgin,
dyd commune and talke with the
serpente, and therof sprange all
yuels: her eies were not chast, the
which the wanton intycement of
the flatterynge apple dyd adulterate

and defyle. The gaye costly
apparaylle, the peynted face, the
pleasant and mery enditynges of
yonge men, the propre knackes
and gyftes sente to and fro, are
playne tokens and sygnes that
virginitie dieth. For whose pleasure
doth a virgin ones dedicate
to Christ, ornate and trimme her
selfe? Why dothe she coueyte the
companye of yonge men, the whiche
toke on her the veyle of relygion
bycause the worlde shoulde
not se and beholde that that was
consecrate to the spouse Christe.
            A woman that is maried, dothe
decke &amp; trymme her selfe to plese
her husbādes eies: but why shuld
a virgin that is maried to Christ
make her selfe gorgious and gay
for any erthely mans pleasure?
            Harke what she shuld say by the

mouthe of a lerned poete, but a
pagane,

                  For whom shuld I make me fayre &amp; gay,
                  Or whom to please, do my diligēnce
                  Whan of hym, that of my freshe array
                  The onely cause is, I haue the absence.
               
            
            If she so did neglect to make her
fresh, bicause her husbād was absent:
how dare a virgin make her
self friske &amp; galtard ī this world,
the whose spouse is in heuen? To
what intent doth she that is ones
betrouthed to Christe, stande lokynge
in a glasse? Yea she shuld
contemplate and behold her selfe
in the clere fountayn of holy scripture.
Why dothe she arraye hir
self in those garmētes, with whiche
he is offended? This clenlynesse
in the eies of your spowse
ar very dirty spottis, this bright
beautie but sluttysshe beggerye,
these swete sauours but stinking

smelles. He loueth a pure spirite,
a clene soule, and a well peynted
mynde. What so euer the worlde
hath, it is theirs, that make them
selfe gorgeous and gaye for the
worlde: the virgin of Christe is
more richely arrayed with despisynge
of those thynges, thanne
with the aboundance of theym.
She is more comely apparayled
with her heares clypped of, &amp; her
holy veyle, than any bride trymmed
in sylkes, gold, precious stones,
and purpull. For the dissembled
beautie, set out with feyned
colours, hath euer ben disalowed
of the Gentyles. The spowse of
Christe hath as many freshe garmentes,
that make her gay in the
syght of god, as she for her spouses
sake despysed ornamentes of
this worlde, for precious stones

she is ornated and decked with
vertues, in stede of pourpull she
hath charitie, for gold, wysdome,
for feyned colours symplenes of
mynde, for sylkes chastitie and
shamefastenes: for broches and
iewels, sobrenes and temperance
in al her wordes and dedes. The
fayre beautie of chastitie can not
be defyled with sluttysshe garmentes.
            ¶It dothe appere by olde monumentes
and wrytynges, howe
high and howe laudable a preise
it was for virgins, to wasshe the
feete of myserable creatures, to
washe poore folkes clothes, to attende
vpon sycke folke and serue
theym lowely, and for the loue of
Christ to handel and touch theyr
bodyes ful of sores and botches.
A virgin slubbred &amp; soylled with

those thynges, is most fayre and
beautyfull in the syght of Christ.
But for so moche as the institution
of holy and deuout virgins,
is now otherwise, let them stryue
amonge theym selfes in the offyces
and workes of charitie, and
prepare with theyr handes, wherwith
they may helpe and succour
the pore and nedy. And if it happē
a virgin at some tyme to haue
cōmunication with secular persons,
let this be her studye, that
they maye go awaye from her amended
by her talkynge, and she
her selfe nothynge appayred. Let
the example of the fyrste virgine
make you more wary and sly, the
which beinge corrupted by speakynge
with the serpente, threwe
her selfe into lamentable mysery.
A yonge manne with his slypper

countenaunce, with his wanton
eies, and with his rebaud tonge,
is wors thā any serpent. Se that
you folowe the newe virgin, leader
and princesse of your institution,
she talketh not with the serpent,
but being close shutte within
her secrete chaumbres, talketh
with the angelle, and therof began
all our helthe. A virgin that
talketh with an vnchaste yonge
man, speaketh with a serpente. A
virgin whiche with deuoute vowes
and prayers callethe vppon
god, which hath her meditation
in holy bokes, speaketh with the
angell, or rather with her spouse.
Whether of these two is mooste
sure? whether is moore honeste?
whether is more magnificent?
            Wherfore if at any tyme the desire
of those thynges, the whiche

as right swete &amp; noble the world
braggyngely bosteth, shall tikyl
your myndes: cal to remembrāce
as the trouthe is, that you haue
not forgone those thīges, but to
your great lucre to haue made a
chaunge. And therfore there is
nothyng more vnfortunate than
those, which letted by carnall lustis,
can neyther vse the commodities
of this worlde, which they
mooste desyre, nor yet theyr owne
pleasures. The worldly virgins
haue theyr playe felowes, they
haue theyr ornamētes, theyr sportes
and pastymes, theyr songes
and theyr daunces, but these thinges
such as they be, they haue no
longer than theyr freshe flourysshynge
and tender youthe endureth.
But as al these thinges are
to the virgins of Chryste trewe

and inwarde pleasures, soo they
be euerlastynge. These worldely
virgyns settynge a syde the garlande
of virginitie, do take and
put vppon theym the mantell of
mariage, without dout (as saynt
Paule saythe) a playne token of
bondage and thraldome. But virgins
dedicate to god, be alwaye
kepte close for theyr spouse, leste
the worlde an aduoutrer shuld se
theym. For Iesus is a ielous louer,
he can not suffre to haue his
dere derlynges sette and shewed
forthe to the syght of the worlde.
But whether is it more plesante
and more welthy to be the hande
mayde of a maried manne,Luc. 1. or the
hande mayde of Christe? Ecce inquit,
ancilla domini, Beholde (sayth
she) the hand mayde of our lord.
Who so euer is truely the hande

mayde of our lorde, is lady of the
world. O good virgin, interpretate
what thyng thy veyle betokeneth,
it is the sygne of a kyngedome,
and not of bondage. They
that are veyled and couered for
theyr husbandes pleasures, doo
professe a worldly bondage. Nor
the commaundement of maryed
men, good virgins, is not alway
lyghte and easye. Often tymes
where you wende to haue hadde
husbandes, you chaunce vppon
maisters harde to please, vppon
suche as are froward and neuer
contented, vpon such as be curst
and knauishe, vpon dycers, drū
               kerdes,
riotttous spenders, vpō
suche as be greatly indetted, vpō
suche as be scabbed and scuruy,
vppon frantycke felowes, and
vppon fyghters, besydes many

other more greuous and wycked
condicions or diseases, whiche I
speake not of. More ouer there
foloweth care of the householde,
care of children, busynes of kynsfolke
and frendes, stryfe in the
worlde, lacke of children, buryenge
of husbandes. For why the
affliction of the flesshe is of noo
symple sorte, the whiche sayncte
Paule signifieth vnto them, that
woll rather chose wedlocke than
virginitie. My pourpose is not
nowe by reason of this declamatiō
to discriue, what so euer grefe
or incommoditie foloweth mariage.
And yet to lerne them by experience
is but a wretched wysedome:
better it were to come by
the knowlege of them by redyng
the bokes of lerned men. But in
case you woll not gyue credence

to lerned mens writynges, than
call vnto you good virgyne one
of them, the whose chaunce was
to be verye welle and welthylye
maryed, and desyre her, that she
woll vouchesafe to telle and declare
to you the true story of her
mariage: you shal here suche rekenynges,
that you shal nothing
repent you of your pourpose.
            Nowe lay before your eies, the exaumples
of vyrgins, the whose
chaunce was mooste vnluckely
and vnwelthily to be bestowed &amp;
maried, of which there is a huge
great company: and thynk thus,
that what, soo euer chaunced to
them, might chance to you. What
so euer yuelles, what so euer calamities
and myseries chance to
them, that be maried to a mortal
man, can in no wise hurt or greue

those, the whiche truely, the whiche
with harte and mynde mary
them selfe to the immortal spouse
Iesu. Beleue me, your spouse Iesus
is in nothynge sorowfulle or
heuy, but in al thynges pleasant
and louely. He semed some tyme
to haue neyther fayre shape nor
goodly beaute, but he was neuer
more louely, than whan for the
loue of his spouse he dyd vppon
hym that same shape and forme.
What mayde is she, that wolde
not make farre moch more of her
wower, if he being a noble mans
sonne, wolde forsake his fathers
ryches &amp; tresure, &amp; clothed with a
homely husbandes wiede, wolde
runne to her cotage, being a pore
mayde to the intent to opteyn her
to his wyfe? But what yf he refuse
not to be greuously woūded

in hastynge hym to come to his
entierly beloued spouse? Shuld
not he, so poorely clothed and all
bloudy with his woundes, seme
more louely? whithout doubt he
shulde so seme to her that loueth
hym. Nowe thanne thynke with
your selfes, whether your spouse
shulde with a stately countenāce
be of you disdayned, whiche for
your sake lefte his fathers moste
royall palaice, descended downe
into this world, and cloking and
hydynge the maiestie of his dyuyne
nature, toke vppon hym
the shappe and fourme of a seruant,Phil. 1.
humblyng hym selfe to the
verye igmony and shame of the
crosse. A monasterie to a virgin
that louethe her spowse, is not a
prison (as some sklaunderously
do saye) but it is a paradyse. It

is not lefull for you to wāder and
walke aboute whither your luste
leadeth you: perdye this thynge
for virgyns is neyther surenor
honeste, and therfore you shulde
not desyre it. Excepte peraduenture
the example of Dina pleasethe
you. Uirgynitie is neyther
sorowfulle nor heuy, but a pleasaunt
thynge. Uyrgynitie hathe
her fayre orchardes to walke in
holye Scrypture, in the whiche
she may sporte and play amonge
that mooste goodlye companye
of her spowse. O good lord with
what maner companye? With
Tecla, with Cecilia, with Agatha,
with Theodora, with Eustochio,
and other innumerable.
Also virginitie hath her spiritual
garlādes, made and wrought
with fresshe flowers of dyuers

vertues: she hath her swete pommaunders
and sauours, soo that
virgins maye say with Sayncte
Paule, Bonus odor sumus deo in omni
loco, That is to saye, We be a
good sauoure vnto god in euery
place. Also the spowse hathe his
delicate and swete spirituall pomanders,
of whiche the fragrant
swetenesse excellethe all aromatike
sauours. Whatte is more amiable
than the name of Iesus?
His name is a sweete smellynge
sauour, that is sparpled abrode.
The virgins being drawen with
that sauoure, to folowe hym as
faste as they can runne, what tediousnesse
canne they haue or fele
in this lyfe?
            ¶A virgin also hath her swete
pommaunder, wherwith in lyke
maner she pleaseth her spowse.
            
               
               Dum esset,Cant. 1. inquit, rex in accubitu suo, nat
dus mea dedit odorem suum, That is
to saye, when the kynge satte at
his table, he smelled my sweete
nardus.Mar. 14. And in the gospel when
that Christe shulde be maryed to
his spowse the Churche, the woman
synner powred sweete smellynge
oyntmentes vpon hym.
            Uyrgyns haue theyr harpes of
Dauid, they haue the Psalter,
they haue theyr songes and spirytuall
hymnes, with whyche in
theyr hartis they synge contynuallye
to god, gyuynge thankes,
lawdynge and besechynge, and
sommetyme with dulce and softe
syghinges desyringe the presence
of theyr spouse, if he at any tyme
absent hym selfe for a season: for
otherwhyle he declineth and passeth
forth by, not to the intent he

woll leaue them, but to redintegrate
and renewe his loue with
theym. What thynge haue these
worldely virgins, be they neuer
so fortunate, that may be compared
to these solaces and plesures?
The place canne not seme strayt
and narowe to theym, to whom
within a shorte space after the vnmeasurablenes
of heuen is opened:
nor they canne not thynke
theym selfe to be sklenderlye accompained,
to whom within a lytel
whyle shal chance, to be in the
felowshyppe and company of all
saynctes. Why shulde I not say
within a lyttell whyle? For howe
longe I pray you, is all the holle
tyme of this present lyfe? in case
it happen a man to lyue tyl he be
very olde: whiche thynge to how
many dothe it chaunce? Wherfore

good virgynes, aknowlege
your felicitie and welth, and loke
that you haue no spite nor enuye,
that the world hath his iugglynges
of vayne delytes and plesures,
aknowlege your dignite, and
looke not you for the sluttysshe
and fylthye marchandyse of the
worlde. He sayth,Cant. 1. 
               Nis ite cognoueris
pulcherrima inter foeminas, O mooste
feyrest amonge womenne, but if
thou knowe thy selfe. The spouse
thretteneth his virgins, onelesse
they wyll aknowlege theyr blessednes.
But they aknowledge it
not, which repent, that they haue
bounde them selfes to liue a holy
chaste lyfe, nor they whiche gape
and loke after worldly vanities
and pleasures. Calle vnto youre
remembrance, to whome you be
spowsed, and loue and stycke to

hym with al your very hartes, in
whom ones you haue al thynges
the whiche are ioyfull and magnifycent.
Let the example of the
mooste holy yonge men animate
and courage you to be constant,
the which shall a great deale the
more reioyce &amp; be glad, that their
bodies as pledges be reserued &amp;
kepte in your Colledge, yf they
mowe perceyue, that you be folowers
of those theyr vertues, with
the which they pleased god. They
ornate and garnyshe your religious
company: soo in lyke maner
se that you with integritie of lyfe
and moste pure and honeste conuersations
hight them agayne.
            They chase rather to suffer many
and dyuers kyndes of tourmentes
and peynes, thenne they
wolde ones taaste hoggis fleshe.

Loke that you repute &amp; thynke it
to be hoggis fleshe, what so euer
is displesāt to your spouse. If you
wyll be emulaters and folowers
of this most goodly conflict, you
shall be part takers of theyr glory,
by the helpe of your spouse
Christ Iesu, whiche with
the father and the holy
gooste lyueth and
reygneth eternally.
            AMEN. ¶Thus endeth the comparation
