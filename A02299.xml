            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

I doe freely confeſſe vnto you, that, ſince I taſted the cares and trauels attending on this Imperiall dignitie: I haue repented a thouſand times, that euer I did vndertake it, becauſe, if it bee accounted Honour to enioy an Empire, there conſiſteth farre greater paine and labour, to order and gouerne it as it ought to be. But beſide, what enuie doth hee expoſe himſelfe to, &amp; multitude of miſlikes, that hath the charge of gouerning others? If hee be iuſt, hee is branded with cruelry: if mercifull, hee is contemned: if beautifull, tearmed lauiſh and prodigall: if hee hoorde vp money, then baſely couetous: if inclined to peace, then hee is a coward: If full of courage, proudly anbitious: if diſcreetly graue, ſurly and ſcornefull: if affably courteous, ſilly and ſimple: if affecting ſolitude a diſſembling hypocrite: if addicted to mirth and pleaſure, then wantonly diſſolute. In the end of all, te worthy Emperour thus concluded. Although willingly, I accepted this high office at the firſt: yet ſorrow hath (ſince) made mee ſhrinke vnder ſo brdenſom a charge: For, the Sea and dignitie are thinges pleaſing to looke

                  A GENER ALL PROLOGVE VPON THE BOOKE. ENTITVLED THE DYALL OF PRINCES: WITH THE FAmous Booke of MARCVS AVRELIVS, Compyled by the Reuerend Father in GOD, the Lord ANTONY of GVEVARA, Byſhop of Guadix: Confeſſor and Chronicler to Charles the fifth, Emperour of Rome: vnto whom, (and to all other Princes, and Noble-perſonages) this worke was directed.
                  
                  
                     
                        APolonius Thianeus diſputing with the ſchollers of Hiareas, ſaid: that among all the affections of nature, nothing is more naturall, then the deſire that all haue to preſerue life.
                  Omitting the diſpute of theſe great Phyloſophers herein, wee our ſelues hereof haue daily proofe: that to liue, men do trauell: to liue, byrds do flie: fiſhes do ſwimme: and to liue, beaſts do hide themſelues for feare of death. Finally, (I ſay) there is no liuing creature ſo brutiſh, that hath not a naturall deſire to liue.
                  If many of the auncient Paynims ſo little regarde life, that of their owne free willes, they offered themſelues death, they did it not for that they deſpiſed The heathē may teach Chriſtians how to liue. life, but becauſe they thought that for their little regarding life, wee would more highly eſteem their fame For, wee ſee men of hauty courages, ſeeke rather to winne a long-during-Fame, then to ſaue a ſhort laſting-life. How loth men are to die, is eaſily ſeen by the great paines they take to liue. For it is a naturall thing to all mortall men, to leaue their liues with ſorrowe and take their deaths with feare.
                  Admit that all doe taſte this corporall death, and that generally both good and euill doe die: yet is there great difference between the death of the one, and the death of the other.
                  If the good deſire to liue, it is onely for the greater deſire they haue to do more good: but if the euill deſire to liue, it is for that they would abuſe the world longer. For the children of vanity call no time good, but onely that wherein they liue, according to their owne deſires. I let you vnderſtand that are at this preſent, and you alſo that ſhall come heereafter: that I direct my writings vnto thoſe which embrace vertue, and not vnto ſuch as are borne away with vice.
                  
                     GOD doth not weigh vs, as we are, but as wee deſire to bee. And let no man ſay, I would, and cānot be good: for as wee haue the audacitie to commit a faulte, ſo (if we liſt) wee may enforce our ſelues to worke amendes. All our vndoing proceedeth of this, that wee outwardly make a ſhewe of vertue, but inwardly in the deede wee employ our whole power to vice: which is an abuſe, wherewith all the world is corrupted and deceiued. For

Heauen is not furniſhed but with good deedes, and hell is not repleniſhed but with Euill-deſires. I graunt that neyther man nor beaſt deſireth to die, but all trauell, to the ende they may liue: But I aske now this queſtion.
                  What doth it auayle a man to deſire his life to be prolonged, if the ſame be wicked, vngodly, and defamed? The man that is high-minded, proude, vnconſtant, cruell, diſdainfull enuious, full of hatred, angry, malicious, full of wrath, couetous, a Lyer, a Gluton, a Blaſphemer, 
                     
                        
                           〈…〉
                        . 
                     and in all his doings diſordred: Why will wee ſuffer him in the world?
                  
                  The life of a poor man that for need ſtealeth a gowne, or any other ſmall trifle is forthwith taken away: Why then is hee that diſturbeth the whole Common-wealth left aliue?
                  
                  Oh would to GOD there were no greater theeues in the world thē thoſe which robbe the temporall goods of the Rich, and that wee did not winke continually at them, which take away the good renowne, as well of the Rich, as of the Poore. But wee chaſtiſe the one, and diſſemble with the other, which is euidently ſeene, how the theefe that ſtealeth my neighbours gown is hanged forthwith, but hee that robbeth mee of my good-name, walketh ſtill before my doore.
                  The diuine Plato in the firſt booke of laws, ſaide: We ordaine and commaund, that hee which vſeth not himſelfe honeſtly, and hath not his houſe well-reformed, his Riches well gouerned, A worthy ſentence of Plato. his family well inſtructed, and liueth not in peace with his neighbors, that vnto him bee aſſigned Tutours, which ſhall gouerne him as a Foole, and as a vacabonde ſhall he be expulſed from the people, to the intent the common-wealth be not through him infected. For there neuer riſeth contention or ſtrife in a commonwealth, but by ſuch men as are alwayes out of order.
                  Truely, the diuine Plato had great reaſon in his ſayings, for the man that is vicious in his perſon, and doth not trauell in things touching his Houſe, nor keepeth his Familie in good order, nor liueth quietly in the Commonwealth, deſerueth to be baniſhed, and driuen out of the countrey.
                  Truely we ſee in diuers places mad men tyed and bound faſt, which if they were at libertie would not doe ſo much harme, as thoſe doe that daylie walke the ſtreetes at their owne willes and ſenſualitie. There is not at this day ſo great or noble a Lord, nor Ladie ſo delicate, but had rather ſuffer a blow on the head with a ſtone, then a blot in their good-Name, with an euilltongue. For the wound of the head in a month or two may well bee healed: but the blemiſh of their good-name during life will neuer be remoued.
                  
                     Laertius ſayth in his booke of the liues of Phyloſophers, that Dyogenes being asked of one of his neighbours, what they were that ordayned theyr Lawes? Aunſwered in this wiſe.
                  Thou ſhalt vnderſtand, my friend, that the earneſt whole deſire of our Fore-fathers, and all the intentions of the phyloſophers, was only to inſtruct A prettie ſentence. them in their Common-wealth, how they ought to ſpeake, how to be occupyed, how to eate, how to ſleepe, how to treat, how to apparrel, how to trauell, and how to reſt: And in this conſiſteth all the wealth of worldly wiſedome.
                  In deede this Phyloſopher in his aunſwer touched an excellent point: For the Law was made to none other end, but only to brydle him that liueth without Reaſon or Law.
                  
                  To men that will liue in reſt, and without trouble in this life, it is requiſite and neceſſarie that they chuſe to themſelues ſome kinde and manner of Liuing, whereby they may maintaine their houſe in good-order, and conforme

their liues vnto the ſame.
                  That eſtate ought not to be as the folly of the perſon doth deſire, nor as may bee moſt pleaſant to the delights of the bodie: but as reaſon teacheth them, and God commaundeth them, for the ſurer ſaluation of theyr ſoules. For, the Children of vanitie embrace that onely, which the ſenſuall appetite deſireth: and reiect that which Reaſon commaundeth.
                  
                  Since the time that Trees were created, they alwayes (remaining in their firſt nature vntill this preſent day) doe beare the ſame leafe and fruite: which things are plainly ſeen in this: that the Palme beareth Dates, the Fig-tree figs, the Nut-tree Nuttes, the Peare-tree Peares, the Apple-tree Apples, the Cheſtnut-tree cheſt-nuts, the Oke Acornes: and to conclude, I ſay, all things haue kept their firſt nature, ſaue onely the Sinnefull-Man, which hath fallen by malice.
                  The Planettes, the Starres, the Heauens, the Water, the Earth, the Ayre, and the Fire: the brute beaſts, and the The trees of the earth ſheweth the malice of man. Fiſhes, all continue in the ſame eſtate wherein they were firſt created: not complaining nor enuying the one the other. Man complaineth continually, hee is neuer ſatisfyed, and alwayes coueteth to chaunge his eſtate. For the ſhepheard would be a Husbandman, the husbandman a Sqiure, the Squire a Knight, the Knight a King, the King an Emperour, &amp;c. Therefore I ſay, that fewe is the number of them that ſeeke amendment of life: but infinite are they that trauell to better their eſtate, and to increaſe their goods.
                  The decay of the Common-wealth (at this preſent) through all the world is, that the drye and withered Okes, which haue been nouriſhed vpon the ſharpe mountains, would now ſeeme to be daintie. Date-trees cheriſhed in the pleaſant gardains. I meane, that thoſe which yeſterday could haue bin pleaſant with drye Acornes in a poore cottage at home: at this day will not eate but of delicate Diſhes in other mens houſes abrode.
                  
                  What eſtate men ought to take vpon them, to keepe their conſcience A good leſſon for all perſons to follow. pure, and to haue more reſt in theyr life, a man cannot eaſily deſcribe. For ther is no ſtate in the Church of God, but men may therin (if they will) ſerue God, and profite themſelues. For, there is no kinde of life in the world, but the wicked (if they perſeuer and continue therein) may ſlaunder their perſons, and alſo loſe their ſoules.
                  
                     Plinie in an Epiſtle that hee wrote to Fabatus his friend, ſaith: There is nothing among mortall men more common and daungerous, then to giue place to vaine imaginations, wherby a man beleeueth the eſtate of one to bee much better then the eſtate of another. And hereof it proceedeth, that the World doeth blinde men ſo, that they will rather ſeeke that which is an other mans by trauell and daunger, then to enioy their owne with quiet and reſt.
                  I ſay the ſtate of Princes is good, if they abuſe it not. I ſay the ſtate of the people is good: if they behaue themſelues obediently. I ſay the ſtate of the rich is good, if they will Godly vſe it. I ſay the eſtate of the Religious is good, if they be able to profite others. I ſay the eſtate of the communaltie is good, if they will content themſelues: I ſay the eſtate of the poore is good, if they haue pacience. For it is no merite to ſuffer troubles, if wee haue not pacience therein.
                  
                  During the time of this our miſerable life we cannot denie, but in euery eſtate there is both trouble &amp; danger. For then onely our eſtate ſhall be perfite, when we ſhall come gloriouſly in ſoule and bodie without the feare of death: and alſo when we ſhall reioyce without daungers in life.
                  
                     
Returning againe to our purpoſe, (Mightie Prince) although wee all be of value little, wee all haue little, we all can attaine little, wee all know little, we all are able to doe little, we all loue but little: yet in all this little, the ſtate of Princes ſeemeth ſome great and high thing. For that worldly men ſay, There is no ſuch felicitie in this life, as to haue authoritie to cōmaund many, and to be bound to obey none. But if eyther ſubiects knew how deere Princes by their power to command, or if princes knew how ſweet a thing it is to liue in quiet, doubtles the ſubjects would pittie their rulers, and the rulers would not enuie their ſubiects. For, full fewe are the pleaſures which Princes enjoy, in reſpect of the troubles that they endure.
                  Since then, the eſtates of Princes is greater then all, that hee may do more then all, is of more value then all, vpholdeth more then all: And finally, that from thence proceedeth the gouernement of all, it is more needefull that the Houſe, the Perſon, and the life of a Prince, be better gouerned and ordered then all the reſt. For, euen as by the meate-yard the Marchaunt meaſureth all his wares: So by the life whole of the Prince is meaſured the whole common-weale.
                  Many ſorrowes endureth the woman in nouriſhing a way-ward child: great trauell taketh a Schoolmaſter in A compariſon neceſſiry to be reſpected. teaching an vntoward ſcholler: much paines taketh an Officer in gouerning a multitude ouer-great. How great then is the paine and perill, wherevnto I offer my ſelfe, in taking vpon mee to order the life of ſuch an one, vpon whoſe life dependeth all the good eſtate of a Common-weale?
                  For, Noble Princes and great Lords ought of vs to bee ſerued, and not offended: wee ought to exhort them, not to vexe them: wee ought to encreate them, not to rebuke them: wee ought to aduiſe them, and not to defame them. Finally (I ſay) the right ſimple, reckon I that Surgion, which with the ſame plaiſters hee layed to a harde heele, ſeeketh to cure the tender Eyes: I meane by this compariſon, that my purpoſe is not to tell Princes and Noble-men in this booke what they be, but to warne them what they ought to bee: not to tell them what they do, but to aduiſe them what they ought to doe. For, that Noble-man which will not amende his life for remorſe of his owne conſcience: Iidoe thinke hee will doe it for the writing of my pen.
                  
                     Paulus Dyaconus the firſt Hyſtoriographer, in the ſecond booke of his Commentaryes, ſheweth an antiquitie, right worthie to remember, and alſo pleaſaunt to read: Although indeed to the hinderaunce of my ſelfe I ſhall rehearſe it.
                  It is, as of the Henne, who by long ſcraping on the Dung-hill, diſcouereth the knife, that ſhall cut her owne throate. Thus was the caſe, Hanniball the moſt A Sentence of Paulus Dyaconus: renowmed Prince and captain of Carthage (after hee was vanquiſhed by the aduenturous Scipio) fled into Aſia, to king Antiochus, a prince then liuing of great vertue, who receyued him into his realme, tooke him into his protection, and right honourably intertayned him in his houſe. And truly king Antiochus did heerein, as a pittyfull prince: For what can more beautifie the honour of a Prince, then to ſuccour Nobilitie in their needefull eſtate?
                  Theſe two Noble Princes vſed diuers exerciſes to ſpende the time honourablie: and thus they diuided their time. Sometime to hunt in the mountains, otherwhiles to diſporre them in the fields, oft to view their Armeys: But chiefly, they reſorted to the Schooles, to heare the Phyloſophers. And truely they did like wiſe and skilfull men. For there is no houre in a day otherwiſe 

ſo well employed, as in hearing a wiſe pleaſant tongued man. There was at a time in Epheſus a famous Philoſopher called Phormio, which openly and publikely read and taught the people of the realme. And one day as theſe two Princes came into the Schoole, the Philoſopher Phormio chaunged the matter whereupon he read, and of a ſudden began to talke of the meanes and wayes that Princes ought to vſe in warre, and of the order to bee kept in giuing battell: Such, ſo ſtrange, and high phraſed was the matter which hee talked of, that not onely they maruelled which neuer before ſaw him: but euen thoſe alſo that of long time had daily heard him. For herein curious and flouriſhing wits ſhew their excellency, in that they neuer want freſh matter to entreate vpon.
                  Greatly gloried the King Antiochus, that this Philoſopher (in preſēce of this ſtrange Prince) had ſo excellently ſpoken, ſo that ſtrangers might vnderſtand he had his realme ſtored with wiſe men: For couragious and noble Princes eſteem nothing ſo precious, as to haue men valiāt to defend their Frontiers, and alſo wiſe to gouerne their common-weales.
                  The Lecture read, King Antiochus demaunded of the Prince Hannibal, how he liked the talke of the Philoſopher Formio? to whom Hanibal ſtoutly anſwered, and in his anſwer ſhewed himſelfe to bee of that ſtoutneſſe he was the ſame day, when he wan the great battell at Cannas: for although noble hearted and couragious Princes loſe all their eſtates and realmes: yet they will neuer confeſſe their harts to be ouerthrowne nor vanquiſhed: And theſe were the words that at that time Hannibal ſayde. Thou ſhalt vnderſtand K. Antiochus that I haue ſeene diuers doting old men, yet I neuer ſaw a more dotard foole thē 
                     Phormio, whom thou calleſt ſuch a great Philoſopher: For the greateſt kinde of folly is, when a man that hath but a little vaine ſcience, preſumeth to teach not thoſe which haue onely ſcience, alſo ſuch as haue moſt certaine experience.
                  Tell me King Antiochus, what hart can brooke with patience, or what tongue can ſuffer with ſilence, to ſee a ſilly man (as this Philoſopher is) nouriſhed all his life time in a corner of Greece, ſtudying Philoſophie, to preſume, as hee hath done, to talke before the prince Hannibal of the affayres of warre, as though hee had beene eyther Lord of Affrique, or Captaine of Rome? Certes, hee eyther full little knoweth himſelfe, or elſe but little eſteemeth vs: For it appeareth by his vaine wordes, hee would ſeeme to know more in matters of warre, by that hee hath read in bookes, then doth Hanniball by the ſundry &amp; great battels which he hath fought in the fields.
                  Oh King Antiothus, how farre and how great is the difference, betweene the eſtate of Phyloſophers, and the ſtate of Captaines: betweene the skyll to reade in Schooles, and the knowledge to rule an Armey: betweene the ſcience that wiſe men haue in bookes, and the experience that the others haue in warre: betweene their skill to write with the penne, and ours to fight with the Sword: betweene one that for his paſtime is ſet round with deskes of bookes, and an other in perill of life, encompaſſed with troups of Enemyes. For, many there are which with great eloquence, in blazing deeds don in warres, can vſe their tongues: but fewe are thoſe that at the brunte haue hearts to aduenture their liues.
                  
                  This Phyloſopher neuer ſaw man of war in the field, neeer ſaw one Armey of men diſcomfited by an other, neuer

heard the terrible Trumpet ſound to the horrible &amp; cruel ſlaughter of men, neuer ſaw the Treaſons of ſome, nor vnderſtood the cowardnes of others, neuer ſaw how few they be that fight, nor how many ther are that run away. Finally (I ſay) as it is ſeemly for a Phyloſopher and a learned man, to praiſe the profite of peace: Euen ſo it is in his mouth a thing vncomely, to prate of the perills' of warre.
                  
                  
                     If this Phyloſopher hath ſeene no one thing with his Eyes that hee hath ſpoken, but onely read them in ſundry bookes, let him recount them to ſuch as haue neyther ſeene nor read them: For, warlike feates are better learned in the bloudy fields of Affricke, then in the beautifull ſchooles of Greece.
                  
                  Thou knoweſt right well (king Antiochus) that for the ſpace of thirty and ſixe yeares, I had continuall and daungerous warres, as well in Italie as in Spayne: In which Fortune did not fauour mee (as is alwayes her manner to vſe thoſe, which by great ſtoutneſſe and manhood, enterpriſe things high, and of much difficultie:) a witneſſe whereof thou ſeeſt mee here, who before my beard beganne to growe was ſerued: and now it is hoare, I my ſelfe beginne to ſerue.
                  I ſweare vnto thee by the God Mars (king Antiochus) that if any man did aske mee, how hee ſhould vſe and behaue himſelfe in warre: I would not aunſwer him one word. For they are things which are learned by Experience of deedes, and not by prating in words. Although Princes beginne warres by juſtice, and followe them The end of warre both fickle &amp; vnconſtant. with wiſedome, yet the ende ſtandeth vppon fickle Fortune, and not of force, nor pollicie.
                  Diuerſe and ſundrie other things Hannibal ſayde vnto king Antiochus: who ſo bee deſirous to ſee, let him reade in the Apothegmes of Plutarche: This example (Noble Prince) tendeth rather to this end, to condemne my boldneſſe, and not to commend my enterpriſe, ſaying that the affayres of the common wealth bee as vnknowne to mee, as the dangers of the warres were to Phormio. Your Maieſtie may iuſtly ſay vnto me, that I being a poor ſimple man (brought vp a great while in a rude Countrey) doe greatly preſume to deſcribe, how ſo puiſſant a Prince as your Highnes ought to gouerne himſelfe and his Realme: For of truth, the more ignorant a man is of the troubles and alterations of the world, the better he ſhall be counted in the ſight of God.
                  The eſtate of Princes is to haue great traines about them, and the eſtate of religious men is to bee ſolitary: for the ſeruant of God ought to be alwaies void from vaine thoughts, &amp; to be euer accompanied with holy meditations. The eſtate of Princes is alwayes vnquiet: but the ſtate of the religious is to bee encloſed: For otherwiſe he aboue all others may be called an Apoſtata, That hath his body in the Cell, and his heart in the market place.
                  To Princes it is neceſſary to commune and ſpeake with all men, but for the religious it is not decent to be cō
                     uerſant with the world: For ſolitary men (if they do as they ought) ſhould occupy their hands in trauel, their bodies in faſting, their tongue in prayer, and their heart in contemplation. The eſtate of Princes for the moſt part is employed to war, but the eſtate of religious is to deſire &amp; procure peace: For if the Prince would ſtudy to paſſe his bounds, and by battell to ſhed the bloud of his enemies: the religious ought to ſhed teares, and pray to God for his ſinnes. O that it pleaſed Almighty God, as I know what my bounden duty is in my heart, ſo that hee would giue me grace to accompliſh the ſame in my deedes.
                  
                     
Alas, when I ponder with my ſelfe the weightines of my matter, my Pen (through ſlouth and negligence is readie to fall out of my hand) and I halfe minded to leaue off mine enterprize. My intent is to ſpeake againſt my ſelfe in this caſe. For, albeit men may know the affaires of Princes by experience: yet they ſhall not know how to ſpeake nor write them but by ſcience.
                  Thoſe which ought to counſell princes, thoſe which ought to reforme the life of princes, and that ought to inſtruct them, ought to haue a cleare iudgement, an vpright minde, their words aduiſedly conſidered, their doctrine wholeſome, and their life without ſuſpition.
                  For, who ſo wil ſpeake of high things, hauing no experience of them: is like vnto a blinde man, that would leade and teach him the way, which ſeeth better then hee himſelfe. This is the ſentence of Xenophon the great, which ſaieth. There is nothing harder in this life, then to know a wiſe man. And the A ſpeech of Xenophon. reaſon which hee gaue was this.
                  
                     That a wiſe man cannot bee knowne, but by another wiſe man: wee may gather by this which Xenophon ſayeth: That as one wiſe man cannot be knowne but by another wiſe man: ſo likewiſe it is requiſite that he ſhould be, or haue bin a Prince, which ſhould write of the life of a Prince. For, hee that hath bin a marriner, and hath ſailed but one yeare on the Sea: ſhall bee able to giue better counſell and aduiſe, then he that hath dwelled ten yeares in the hauen.
                  
                     Xenophon wrote a booke touching the inſtitution of princes, &amp; bringeth in Cambyſes the king, how hee taught, and ſpake vnto king Cyrus his ſonne. And he wrote an other book likewiſe of the Arte of Chiualry, and brought in king Philip, how he ought to teach his ſonne Alexander to fight. For the philoſophers thought that writing of no authoritie, that was not entituled and ſet foorth vnder the Names of thoſe Princes, who had experience of that they wrote.
                  Oh if an aged Prince would with his penne (if not with word of mouth) declare, what miſfortunes haue happened ſince the firſt time hee beganne to raigne: how diſobedient his ſubjects haue bin vnto him, what griefes his ſeruants haue wroght againſt him, what vnkindneſſe his Friendes haue ſhewed him: what wiles his enemies haue vſed towards him, what daunger his perſon hath eſcaped: what jarres hath bin in his Pallace; what faultes they haue layde againſt him, how manie times they haue deceyued ſtraungers: Finally, what griefes hee hath had by day, and what ſorrowfull ſighs he hath fetched in the night: Truely I thinke (and in my thought I am nothing deceiued) that if a prince would declare vnto vs his whole life, and that hee would particularly ſhewe vs euery thing, wee would both wonder at that bodie which had ſo much ſuffered: and alſo we would be offended with that heart which had ſo greatly diſſembled.
                  It is a troubleſome thing, a dangerous thing, and an inſolent and proud enterpriſe, for a man to take vpon him with a penne to gouerne the Commonwealth, and with a Prince to reaſon of his life. For in deed men are not perſwaded to liue well by faire words, but by vertuous deedes. And therefore not How dāgerous a thing it is to meddle with Princes affaires. without cauſe I ſay, that hee is not wiſe, but very arrogant, that dare preſume vnasked to giue a Prince counſell. For princes in many things haue their mindes occupyed, and haughtely bent, and ſom of them alſo are affectionate, and whereas wee (peraduenture) thinke to haue them mercifull, wee finde them more angrie and heauie againſt vs.
                  For, counſell doeth more harme then profite, if the giuer thereof be not very wiſe, and hee alſo which receyueth it

                     very pacient. I haue not bin a Prince, for to know the trauels of Princes, nor am as preſident to counſell Princes: and yet I was ſo bolde to compile this Booke: it was not vpon preſumption to counſell a Prince, ſo much as by an humble ſort to giue mine aduiſe. For to giue counſell, I confeſſe I haue no credite: but to giue them aduiſe, it ſufficeth mee to bee a ſubiect.
                  What the order is in that I haue taken in this Booke: how profitable it is to all men, and how vnpleaſaunt to no man: how wholſom and profound doctrine in it is contayned, and how the Hiſtoryes bee heerein applyed: I will not that my pen doe write, but they themſelues ſhall judge, which ſhall read this worke.
                  
                     We ſee it oft come to paſſe that diuers Bookes doe looſe their eſtimation: not for that they are not very good and excellent: but becauſe the Authour hath been too preſumptuous and vaine-glorious. For, in mine opinion, for a man to praiſe his owne wrytings much, is nothing elſe but to giue men occaſion to ſpeake euill both of him, and of his workes.
                  
                  Now, let no man thinke that I haue written this which is written without great aduiſement and examination. I doe confeſſe, before the Redeemer of the whole world, that I haue conſumed ſo many yeares to ſeeke what I ſhould The paines that the Authour tooke in this booke. write, that theſe two yeares, one day hath ſcarcely eſcaped me, wherein my Pen hath not done his dutie, to write or correct in this worke. I confeſſe that I tooke great paines in writing it, for of truth it hath been written twice with mine owne hand, and thrice with another mans hand. I confeſſe I haue read and ſearched, in diuers and ſundrie partes, manie good and ſtraunge books, to the end I might finde good and pleaſaunt doctrine: and beſides that, I trauelled much to ſet and apply the Hyſtories to the purpoſe. For, it is an vnſeemely thing to applie an hyſtorie without a purpoſe, I had great reſpect, in that I was not ſo briefe in my wrytings, that a man might note mee to bee obſcure: nor yet in anie thing ſo long, that any man ſhould ſlaunder mee with too much talke.
                  
                     For, all the excellencie of Wryting conſiſteth, where many and goodly Sentences are declared in feweſt and apteſt words. For, oft times the long ſtile is loathſome and tedious both to the Hearers and Readers.
                  
                  
                     Nero the Emperour was in loue with a Ladie in Rome named Pompeia, the which in beautie (to his fantaſie,) exceeded all others. In the ende partly with intreatie, partly with Money The inordinate loue betweene Nero and Pompeia. and preſents, he obtained of her that hee deſired. For, in this caſe of loue, where prayers and importunities bee paciently heard, reſiſtance doth lacke.
                  The inordinate loue that Nero bare to Pompeia, proceeded of the yealow haires ſhe had: which were of the colour of Amber, and in praiſe of her he compiled diuers, and ſundry ſongs in Heroicall-Meeter: and with an inſtrument ſang them himſelfe in her preſence.
                  
                     Nero was a ſage Prince, wiſe, and excellently well learned in the Latine tongue, and alſo a good Muſitian: yet Plutarch in his book of the jeſts of noble women (to declare the vanitie and lightnes of Nero) reciteth this hiſtory: and deſcribing Pompeia, that her bodie was ſmall, her fingers long, her mouth proper, her eyelids thin, her noſe ſomwhat ſharpe, her teeth ſmall, her lips red, her necke white, her fore-head broad, and finally, her eyes great, and rowling, her breſt large &amp; well proportioned: What think you would Nero haue done, if hee had ſo affectionately ſet his fantaſie vpon al other her beautiful properties, ſince that for the loue only of her yellow locks, he was depriued both of his wiſdom, &amp; alſo ſenſes. For vaine &amp; light men loue commonly not
                     
                     that which reaſon commandeth but that which their appetite deſireth.
                  
                  The loue of the Emperour increaſed with folly ſo much, that not onely he counted ſeuerally al the haires that The folly of the Emperour Nero deſcribed. his louer Pompeia had on her head, but alſo gaue to euery hayre a proper name, and in prayſe of euery one of them made a ſong, inſomuch that this effeminate Prince ſpent more time in banqueting and playing with his louer Pompeia, then he did to reform and amend the faults of the common wealth: yea, his folly ſo much ſurmoū
                     ted all reaſon, that he commaunded a combe of golde to bee made, and therewith hee himſelfe combed her yellow locks. And if it chaunced that any one hayre in combing fell off, hee by and by cauſed it to be ſet in golde, offered it vp in the Temple to the Goddeſſe Iuno: For it was an ancient cuſtome among the Romanes, that the thinges which they entirely loued (whether it were good or euill) ſhould bee offered vp to their gods. And when it was once knowne that Nero was ſo in loue with thoſe haires of Pompeia which were of the color of amber, all the Ladies endeauoured themſelues, not onely to make artificially theyr hayre of that colour, but alſo to weare their garments and other attires of the ſame colour, in ſomuch that both men and women did vſe collers of amber, brooches, and ringes ſet with amber, and all their other iewels were of amber. For alwayes it hath beene ſeene, and euer ſhall be, that thoſe things whereunto the Prince is moſt addicted, the people follow, and aboue all other couet the ſame.
                  Before this Emperour Nero plaied this light part in Rome, the amber ſtones was had in little eſtimation, &amp; after that hee ſet ſo much by it, there was no precious ſtone in Rome, ſo much eſteemed: Yea, and furthermore, the Marchant gained nothing ſo much (whether it were in golde or ſilke) as he did in the amber ſtones, nor brought any kind of marchandize to Rome more precious, or more vendible then that was. I do maruell at this vanitie, foraſ-much as the children of the world do loue, deſire, and labour, more to follow the ſtraunge follie of another: then to furniſh and ſupplie their owne proper neceſſitie.
                  Therefore returning againe to my purpoſe, (moſt excellent Prince,) by this example you may coniecture what I would ſay, that is, that if this writing were accepted vnto Princes, I am aſſured it would be refuſed of no man: And if any man would ſlanderouſly talke of it, hee durſt not, remē
                     bring that your Maieſty hath receyued it: For thoſe things which Princes take to their cuſtody, wee are bound to defend, and it is not lawfull for vs to diminiſh their credite.
                  Suppoſe that this my worke were not ſo profound as it might be of this matter, nor with ſuch eloquence ſet out as many other bookes are: yet I dare bee bolde to ſay, that the Prince ſhall take more profit by reading of this worke, then Nero did by his loue Pompeia: For in the end by reading and ſtudying good bookes, men turn and become ſage and wiſe, and by keeping ill company, they are counted fooles and vitious.
                  My meaning is not, nor I am not ſo importunate and vnreaſonable, to perſwade Princes that they ſhould ſo fauour my doctrine, that it ſhould be in like eſtimation now in theſe parts, 
                        •
                     a the amber was there in Rome. But that onely which I require and demaund is, that the time which Nero ſpent in ſinging and telling the hayres of his loue Pompeia: ſhould now bee employed to redreſſe the wrongs &amp; faults of the common wealth. For the noble and worthy Prince ought

to employ the leaſt part of the day in the recreation of his perſon: After hee hath giuen audience to his Counſellours, to the Ambaſſadours, to the great Lords and Prelates, to the rich and poore, to his own countrey men &amp; ſtrangers, and after that he be com into his Priuy Chamber, then my deſire is, that hee would reade this Treatiſe, or ſom other better then this: for in Princes chambers oftentimes thoſe of the Priuie Chamber, and other their familiars loſe great time in reciting vaine and trifling matters, and of ſmall profit, the which might better bee ſpent in reading ſome good good booke.
                  In all worldly affayres that wee do, and in all our bookes which we compile, it is a great matter to bee fortunate: For to a man that fortune doth not fauour, diligence without doubt can little auaile. Admit that fortune were againſt mee, in that this my worke ſhould bee acceptable vnto your Maieſty, without compariſon it ſhould be a great griefe and diſhonour vnto mee to tel you what ſhould be good to reade for your paſtime, if on the other part you would not profite by my counſell and aduiſe: For my mind was not onely to make this booke, to the end Princes ſhould reade it for a paſtime, but to that end (in recreating themſelues) ſometimes they might thereby alſo take profit.
                  
                     Aulus Gelius in the 12. Chapter of his third booke entituled De nocte attica, ſayde that amongſt all the Schollers which the diuine Plato had, one A commendation of Demoſthenes the Philoſopher. was named Demoſtenes, a man among the Greekes moſt highly eſteemed, &amp; of the Romanes greatly deſired. Becauſe hee was in his liuing ſeuere, and in his tongue and doctrine a very Satyre. If Demoſthenes had come in the time of Phalaris the tyrant, when Grecia was peopled with tirants, and that hee had not beene in Platoes time, when it was repleniſhed with Philoſophers, truely Demoſthenes had been as cleare a lanterne in Aſia, as Cicero the great was in Europe.
                  
                  
                     Great good hap hath a notable man to bee born in one age, more then in another. 
                     How happy a thing it is to liue vnder a vertuous prince. 
                     I meane, that if a valiant Knight come in the time of a couragious and ſtout Prince ſuch a one truly ſhall bee eſteemed and ſet in great authority. But if hee come in the time of an other effeminate and couetous Prince, bee ſhall not bee regarded at all: For hee will rather eſteeme one that wel augment his treaſure at home, then him that can vanquiſh his enemies abroad.
                  
                  So likewiſe it chanceth to wiſe and vertuous men, which if they come in the time of vertuous and learned princes, are eſteemed and honoured: but if they come in time of vaine and vicious Princes, they make ſmall account of them. For it is an auncient cuſtom among vanities children, not to honour him which to the Common wealth is moſt profitable: but him which to the Prince is moſt acceptable.
                  The end why this is ſpoken (Moſt puiſſant Prince) is becauſe the two renowmed Philoſophers were in Greece both at one time: and becauſe the diuine Philoſopher Plato was ſo much eſteemed and made of, they did not greatly eſteeme the Philoſopher Demoſthenes: For the eminent &amp; high renowne of one alone, diminiſheth the fame and eſtimation (among the people) of many. Although Demoſthenes was ſuch a one indeed as wee haue ſayde, that is to witte, eloquent of tongue, ready of memory, ſharpe and quicke of witte, in liuing ſeuere, ſure and profitable in giuing of counſell, in renowne excellent, in yeares very auncient, and in Philoſophy a man right well learned: yet hee refuſed not to goe to the Schooles of Plato to heare morall Philoſophie. He

that ſhall reade this thing or heare it, ought not to maruel, but to follow it, and to profit likewiſe in the ſame, that is to vnderſtand, that one Philoſopher learned of another, and one wiſe man ſuffred himſelf to be taught of another: For knowledge is of ſuch a quality, that the more a man knoweth, dayly there encreaſeth in him a deſire to know more. All things of this life (after they haue beene taſted and poſſeſſed) cloyeth a man, wearieth and troubleth him, true ſcience onely excepted, which neuer doth cloy, weary, nor trouble them. And if it happen wee weary any, it is but the eyes, which are wearied with looking and reading: and not the ſpirite with ſeeling and taſting.
                  Many Lords, and my familiar friends doe aske mee how it is poſſible I ſhould liue with ſo much ſtudy? And I alſo demaund of them, how it is poſſible they ſhould liue in ſuch continuall idlenes? For conſidering the prouocation and aſſaults of the fleſh, the daungers of the world, the temptations of the deuil, the treaſons of enemies, &amp; importunity of friends: what hart can ſuffer ſo great and continuall trauell, but onely in reading and comforting himſelfe in bookes? Truely a man ought to haue more compaſsion of a ſimple ignorant man then of a poore man: For thereis no greater pouerty vnto a man then for to lacke wiſedom, whereby he ſhould know how to gouerne himſelfe.
                  Therefore following our matter, the caſe was ſuch, one day Demoſthenes (going to the ſchoole of Plato) ſaw in the market place of Athens a great aſſembly of people, which were hearing a Philoſopher newly come vnto that place: and hee ſpake not this without a cauſe, that there was a great company of people aſſembled. For that naturally the common people are deſirous to heare new and ſtrange things.
                  
                     Demoſthenes asked what Philoſopher hee was, after whom ſo many people went? and when it was aunſwered him that it was Caliſtratus the Philoſopher, a man which in eloquēce was very ſweete and pleaſant: hee determined to ſtay and heare him, to the end hee would know, whether it were true or vaine that the people tolde him: For oftentimes it hapneth that among the people ſome get thē
                     ſelues great fame, more by fauor, then by good learning.
                  The difference betwixt the diuine 
                        
                           〈…〉
                        . Philoſopher Plato and Caliſtratus was, in that Plato was exceedingly wel learned, and the other very eloquent: and thus it came to paſſe, that in liuing they followed Plato, and in eloquence of ſpeech they did imitate Caliſtratus. For, there are diuers men ſufficiently well learned, which haue profound doctrine, but they haue no way nor meanes to teach it vnto others.
                  
                     Demoſthenes hearing Caliſtratus but once, was ſo farre in loue with his doctrine, that he neuer after heard Plato: nor entered into his Schoole, for to harken to any of his lectures.
                  At which newes diuers of the Sages and Wiſe men of Grecia maruelled much, ſeeing that the tongue of a man was of ſuch power, that it had put all their doctrine vnto ſilence.
                  Although I apply not this example, I doubt not but that your Maieſty vnderſtandeth to what ende I haue declared it.
                  And moreouer I ſay, that although Princes and great Lordes haue in their Chambers Bookes ſo well corrected, and men in their Courts ſo well learned, that they may worthily keepe the eſtimation which Plato had in his Schoole: yet in this caſe it ſhould not diſpleaſe me

that the difference that was between Plato and Caliſtratus, ſhould bee betweene Princes and this Booke. God forbid, that by this ſaying men ſhould thinke, I meane to diſſwade Princes from the company of the ſage men, or from reading of any other booke but this; for in ſo doing, Plato ſhould bee reiected which was diuine, and Caliſtratus embraced which was more worldly. But my deſire is, that ſometimes they would vſe to reade this booke a little, for it may chaunce they ſhall finde ſome wholeſome counſell therein, which at one time or other may profite them in their affayres: For the good and vertuous Prince ought to graffe in their memory the wiſe ſayings which they reade, and forget the cankred iniuries and wrongs which are done them.
                  
                  I do not ſpeake it without a cauſe, that hee that readeth this my writing, ſhall finde in it ſome profitable counſell: For all that which hath bin written in it, hath beene euery word and ſentence with great diligence ſo well wayed and corrected, as if therein onely conſiſted the effect of the whole worke.
                  The greateſt griefe that learned men ſeele in their writing is, to thinke that if there bee many that view their doings to take profite thereby, they ſhall perceyue that there are as many more which occupie their tongues in the ſlaunder and diſprayſe thereof. In publiſhing this my worke, I haue obſerued the manner of them that plant a new garden, wherein they ſet Roſes which giue a pleaſant ſauour to the noſe, they make faire greene plattes to delight the eyes, they graft fruitfull trees to bee gathered with the hands; but in the end as I am a man: ſo haue I written it for men, and conſequently as a man I may haue erred: for there is not at this day ſo perfect a painter, but another will preſume to amend his worke.
                  Thoſe which diligently will endeauour themſelues to reade this booke, ſhall finde in it very profitable counſels, very liuely lawes, good reaſons, notable ſayings, ſentences very profound, worthy examples, and hiſtories very ancient: For to ſay the truth, I had a reſpect in that the doctrine was auncient, and the Stile new. And albeit your Maieſty bee the greateſt Prince of all Princes, and I the leaſt of all your Subiects, you ought not for my baſe condition to diſdaine to caſt your eyes vpon this booke, nor to thinke ſcorne to put that thing in proofe which ſeemeth good. For a good letter ought to be nothing the leſſe eſteemed, although it be written with an euill pen.
                  I haue ſayde, and will ſay, that Princes and great Lords, the ſtouter, the richer, and the greater of renowme they bee, the greater need they haue of all men of good knowledge about them, to counſell them in their affayres, and of good bookes which they may reade: and this they ought to doe as well in proſperity, as in aduerſity, to the end that their affayres in time conuenient, may be debated and redreſſed: For otherwiſe they ſhould haue time to repent, but no leaſure to amend.
                  
                     Plinie, Marcus Varro, Strabo, and Macrobius, which were Hiſtoriographers, Diuers Hiſtoriographers at controuerſie, what things were moſt authentike. no leſſe graue then true, were at great controuerſie, improouing what things were moſt authenticke in a common weale, and at what time they were of all men accepted.
                  
                     Seneca in an Epiſtle hee wrote to Lucullus, prayſed without ceaſing the Common wealth of the Rhodians, in the which (with much ado) they bent themſelues altogether to keepe one ſelfe thing, and after they had therupon agreede, they kept and maintained it inuiolably.
                  
                     
The diuine Plato in the ſixt booke entituled De Legibus ordained and commanded, that if any Cittizen did inuent any new thing, which neuer before was read, nor heard of, the inuentour thereof ſhould firſt practiſe the ſame for the ſpace of ten yeares in his own houſe, before it was brought into the Common-wealth, and before it ſhould bee publiſhed vnto the people, to the end, if the inuention were good, it ſhould be profitable vnto him: and if it were nought, that then the daunger and hurt thereof ſhould light onely on him.
                  
                     Plutarch in his Apothegmes ſayeth, that Lycurgus vpon grieuous penalties did prohibite, that none ſhould bee ſo hardy in his Common wealth to goe wandring into ſtrange Countries, nor that hee ſhould be ſo hardy to admit any ſtrangers to come into his houſe: and the cauſe why this law was made, was to the end ſtrangers ſhould not bring into their houſes things ſtrange, and not accuſtomed in their Common wealth, and that they trauelling through ſtrange countries, ſhould not learne new Cuſtomes.
                  The preſumption of men now adayes is ſo great, and the conſideration of the people ſo ſmall, that what ſoeuer a man can ſpeake, he ſpeaketh, what ſo euer he can inuent he doth inuent, what hee would hee doth write, and it is no maruell, for there is no man that wil ſpeak againſt them. Nor the common people in this caſe are ſo light, that amongſt them you may dayly ſee new deuiſes, and whether it hurt or profit the Common wealth they force not.
                  If there came at this day a vaine man amongſt the people, which was neuer ſeene nor heard of before, if hee bee any thing ſubtill: I aske you but this queſtion: Shall it not bee eaſie for him to ſpeake, and inuent what hee liſteth, to ſet forth what he pleaſeth, to perſwade that which to him ſeemeth good, and all his ſayings to be beleeued? truly it is a wonderfull thing, and no leſſe ſlaunderous, that one ſhould be ſufficient to peruert the ſenſes and iudgements of all, and all not able to repreſſe the lightneſſe and vanity of one. Things New things and vnaccuſtomed ought not to be vſed. that are new, and not accuſtomed, neyther Princes ought to allow, nor yet the people to vſe: For a newe thing ought no leſſe to bee examined and conſidered, before it be brought into the cōmon wealth, then the great doubts which ariſe in mens mindes. Ruffinus in the Prologue of his ſecōd Booke of his Apologie reprooueth greatly the Egyptians becauſe they were too full of deuiſes, and blamed much the Grecians, becauſe they were too curious in ſpeaking fine wordes: and aboue all other hee greatly prayſeth the Romanes; for that they were very hard of beleefe, and that they ſcarcely alwayes credited the ſayings of the Greekes, and becauſe they were diſcreete in admitting the inuentions of the Egyptians.
                  The Author hath reaſon to prayſe the one, and diſprayſe the other. For it proceedeth of a light iudgement, to credit all the thinges that a man heareth, and to doe all that he ſeeth.
                  Returning therefore now to our matter. Marcus Varro ſayde, that there were fiue things in the Worlde very hard to bring in, whereof none (after they were commonly accepted) were euer loſt or forgotten, for euen as things vainely begunne, are eaſily left of: ſo thinges with great feare accepted, are with much care and diligence to bee kept and obſerued.
                  The firſt thing that chiefly throghout all the World was accepted, was all men for to liue together: that is for to ſay, that they ſhould

make places, Towns, Villages, Citties and Common wealthes. For according to the ſaying of Plato, the firſt &amp; beſt inuentors of the common-wealth were the Antes, which (according to to the experience wee ſee) do liue together, trauell together, do go together, &amp; alſo for the winter they make prouiſion together: and furthermore The prouidence of the Ants. none of theſe Antes doe giue themſelues to any priuate thing, but all theirs is brought into their common wealth.
                  It is a maruellous thing to behold the common wealth of the ants, how nearely they trim their hils, to behold how they ſweepe away the graine, when it is wette, and how they drye it when they feele any moyſture, to behold how they come from their work and how the one doth not hurt the other: and to behold alſo how they do reioyce the one in the others trauell, and that which is to our greateſt confuſion is, that if it comes ſo to paſſe, 50000. Ants wil liue in a litle hillocke together, and two men onely cannot liue in peace and concord in a common wealth.
                  Would to God the wiſedome of men were ſo great to keep themſelus as the prudence of the ants is to liue: When the world came to a certaine age, and mens wits waxed more fine, then tirants ſprang vp which oppreſſed the poore, theeues that robbed the rich, rebels that robbed the quiet, murderers that ſlew the patient, the idle that eate the ſwet of other mens browes: all the which things conſidered by them which were vertuous: they agreed to aſſemble and liue together, that thereby they might preſerue the good, and withſtand the wicked. Macrobius affirmeth this in the ſecond booke of Scipions dreame, ſaying, That couetouſnes ond auarice was the greateſt cauſe why men inuented the commonwealth. Plinie in the ſeuenth booke 56. Chapter ſayth, the firſt that made ſmall aſſemblies were the Athenians; and the firſt that built great Cities, were the Egyptians.
                  
                  The ſecond thing that was accepted throughout al the world, were the letters which wee read, whereby wee take profite in writing. According whereunto Marcus Varro ſayth, the Egyptians prayſe themſelues and ſay, that they did inuent them, and the Aſſyrians affirme the contrary, and ſweare, that they were ſhewed firſt of all amongſt them.
                  
                     Plinie in the 7. booke ſayth, that in the firſt age, there was in the alphabet no more then 16. letters, &amp; that great A deſcription of the Alphabet. 
                     Palamedes at the ſiege of Troy, ladded other 4. and Ariſtotle ſaith, that immediatly after the beginning, there were found 18. letters. And that afterwards Palamedes did add but 2. and ſo there were 20. and that the Philoſopher Epicarmus did adde other 2. which were 22. it is no great matter, whether the Egyptians or the Aſſyrians firſt foūd the letters. But I ſay and affirme, that it was a thing neceſſary for a common wealth, and alſo for the encreaſe of mans knowledge: For if wee had wanted letters and writings, wee could haue had no knowledge of the time paſt, nor yet our poſterity could haue bin aduertiſed what was done in our daies.
                  
                     Plutarch in the ſecond booke entituled De viris illuſtribus, and Pliny in the ſeuenth booke, and 56. Chapter, doe greatly praiſe Pirotas, becauſe hee firſt found the fire in a flint ſtone.
                  They greatly commended Protheus, becauſe he inuented barneyes, and they highly extolled Panthaſuea, becauſe ſhe inuented the hatchet. They prayſed Citheus, becauſe hee inuented the bowe, and the arrowes, they greatly prayſed Pheniſius, becauſe hee inuented the Croſſebow, and the ſling.
                  
                     
They highly praiſed the Lacedemonians, becauſe they inuented the Helmet, the Speare, and the Sworde, and moreouer, they commende thoſe of Theſſalie, becauſe they inuented the combat on horſ-back: and they commend thoſe of Affrike, becauſe they inuented the fight by Sea. But I doe praiſe, and continually will magnifie, not thoſe which found the Art of fighting: and inuented weapons to procure warres, for to kill his neighbour: but thoſe which found Letters, for to learne Science, and to make peace betweene two Princes.
                  What difference there is to wet the Penne with inke and to paint the Speare with bloud: to be enuironed with bookes, or to be laden with weapons. To ſtudie how euery man ought to liue, or elſe to goe priuily and robbe in the Warres, and to kill his Neighbour. There is none of ſo vaine a iudgement, but will praiſe more the Speculation of the Sciences, then the practiſe of the warres. Becauſe that in the ende, he that learneth ſciences, learneth nought elſe but how he and others ought to liue. And he that learneth warlike feats, learneth none other thing, then how to ſlay his Neighbour, and to deſtroy others.
                  
                  The third thing, that equally of all was accepted, were lawes. For admit that all men now liued together in common, if they would not be ſubiect one to another, there would contention ariſe amongſt them, for that according to the ſaying of Plato, That there is no greater token of the deſtruction of a 
                     A worthy ſentence of Plato: 
                     Common-weale, then when many rulers are choſen therein.
                  
                  
                     Plinie in his ſeuenth booke, 56. chap: ſayth, that a Queene called Ceres, was the firſt that taught them to ſowe in the fields, to grinde in Milles, to paſte and bake in Ouens, and alſo ſhee was the firſt that taught the people to liue according to the Law. And by the meanes of theſe things our Fore-fathers called her a Goddeſſe.
                  Since the time we neuer haue ſeene heard, nor read of any realme, or other nation (as well ſtrange as barbarous) whatſoeuer they were, but haue had Lawes, whereby the good were fauoured: and alſo inſtitutions of grieuous paines, wherewith the wicked were puniſhed.
                  Although truely I had rather, and it were better, that the good ſhould loue reaſon: then feare the law. I ſpeake of thoſe which leaue to doe euill workes, for feare onely of falling into the puniſhments appoynted for euill doers. For, although men approue that which they do for the preſent, yet God condemaeth that which they deſire.
                  
                     Seneca in an epiſtle hee wrote vnto his friende Lucille, ſaide theſe wordes, Thou writeſt, vnto mee Lucille, that thoſe of Scicile, haue carryed a great quantitie of Corne into Spaine, and into Affrike, the which was forbidden by a Romaine law, and therefore they haue deſerued moſt grieuous puniſhment.
                  Now becauſe thou art vertuous, Thou mayeſt teache mee to doe well: and I that am olde, will teach thee to ſay well: and this is, becauſe that amongſt wiſe and vertuous men it is enough to ſay, that the Law commaundeth, appoynteth, and ſuffereth this thing, but in as much as it is agreeing with reaſon. For, the crowne of the good, is reaſon, and the ſcourge of the wicked, is the law.
                  The fourth thing that commonly through the worlde amongſt all men was accepted, was the Barbers. And let no man take this thing in mockery. For, if they doe reade Plinie, in the 59. chapter, and the ſeuenth booke, there they ſhall finde for a Trueth, that in thoſe former times, the Romaines were in Rome 454. yeares, without eyther powling or ſhauing

                     Marcus Varro ſaid, that Publius 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      was the firſt that brought the barbers from Scicilie to Rome: But admit it were ſo or otherwiſe: yet notwithſtanding, there was a great contention among the Romaines. For, they ſayd, they thought it a raſh thing for a man to commit his life vnto the curteſie of another.
                  
                     Dyoniſius the Syracuſian neuer truſted his Beard with any barbor, but when his Daughters were very little, they clipped his beard with ſiſers: but after they became great, hee would not put his truſt in them, to trimme his beard, but hee himſelfe did burne it with the ſhales of nuttes.
                  This Dyoniſius Syracuſan, was demaunded why hee would not truſt any Barbours with his beard? He aunſwered, Becauſe I know that there bee ſome which will giue more to the Barbor to take away my life, then I will giue to trimme my beard.
                  
                  
                     Plinie in the ſeuenth booke ſayeth, that the great Scipio called Affrican, and the Emperour Auguſtus, were the firſt that cauſed them in Rome to ſhaue their beards. And I thinke the end why Plinie ſpake theſe things, was to exalt theſe two Princes, which had as great courage to ſuffer the raſours to touch their throats: as the one for to fight againſt Hanniball in Affricke, and the other, againſt Sextus Pompeius in Scicilie.
                  
                  The fifte thing which commonly throgh the world was accepted, were the Dyalls and clockes which the Romains wanted a long time. For as Plinie and Marcus Varro ſay, the Romaines were without clockes in Rome, for the ſpace of 595. yeares.
                  The curious Hyſtoriographers declare 
                        
                           〈…〉
                        . three manner of dyalls that were in old time: that is to ſay, Dyalls of the houres, Dyalls of the Sunne, and Dyalls of the Water. The dyall of the Sunne Aneximenides Milleſius inuented: who was great Animandraes ſcholler. The dyall of the water Scipio Naſica inuented, &amp; the dyall of houres, one of the Schollers of Thales the phyloſopher inuented.
                  Now of all theſe Antiquities, which were brought into Rome, none of them were ſo acceptable to the Romaines, as the Dyalls were, whereby they meaſured the day by the houre. For, before they could not ſay, we will riſe at ſeuen of the clocke, wee will dine at ten, we will ſee one the other at twelue: at one wee will doe that wee ought to doe.
                  But before they ſayde, after the Sunne is vp wee wil doe ſuch a thing, and before it goe downe, wee will do that wee ought to doe.
                  The occaſion of declaring vnto you theſe fiue antiquities in this preamble, was to no other entent, but to call my Booke the Diall of Princes. The name of the Booke beeing new (as it is) may make the learning that is therin greatly to be eſteemed. God forbid that I ſhould bee ſo bolde to ſay, they haue been ſo long time in Spaine without dayes of learning, as they were in Rome without the Diall of the Sunne, the water, and of the houres: For that in Spaine haue beene alwaies Spayne cō

By great reaſon, and of greater occaſion, the Princes ought to bee commended, the knights, the people, their wits, and the fertility of their Countrey: but yet to all theſe goodneſſe, I haue ſeen many vnlearned bookes in Spaine, which as broken Dials deſerue to bee caſt into the fire to bee forged anew. I doe not ſpeake it without a cauſe, that many bookes deſerue to bee broken and burnt: For there are ſo many that without ſhame and honeſty doe ſet forth bookes of loue of the world, at this day as boldlie, as if they taught them to deſpiſe and ſpeake euill of the world.
                  
                     
It is pitty to ſee how many dayes and nights be conſumed in reading vaine bookes (that is to ſay) Orſon and Valentine, the Court of Venus, and the foure ſonnes of Amon, and diuers other vaine bookes, by whoſe doctrine I dare boldly ſay, they paſſe not the time but in perdition: for they learne not how they ought to flye vice, but rather what way they may with more pleaſure embrace it.
                  This Diall of Princes is not of ſand, nor of the Sunne, nor of the houres, nor of the water, but it is the Diall of Life. For the other Dials ſerue to know what houre it is in the night, and what houre it is of the day: but this ſheweth and teacheth vs, how wee ought to occupie our minds, and how to order our life.

                  The End of the generall Prologue.
               
               
                  
                  THE AVTHOVRS PROLOGVE SPEAKETH PARTICVLARLIE of the Booke, called MARCVS AVRELIVS which he tranſlated, and dedicated to the Emperour CHARLES the fift.
                  
                  
                     THe greateſt vanity that I finde in the world is, that vaine men are not onely content to be vaine in their life, but alſo procure to leaue a memory of their vanity after their death. For it is ſo thought good vnto vaine and light men which ſerue the world in vain works: that at the houre of death when they perceyue they can do no more, and that they can no longer preuaile, they offer themſelues vnto death, which now they ſee approch vpon them. Many of the World are ſo fleſhed in the World, that although it forſaketh them in deedes, yet they will not forſake it in their deſires. And I durſt ſweare, that if the World could grant them perpetuall life, they would promiſe it alwayes to remaine in their cuſtomable folly.
                  O what a number of vaine men are aliue, which haue neyther remembrance of God to ſerue him, nor of his glorie to obey him, nor of their conſcience to make it cleane: but like bruit beaſts fellow and runne after their voluptuous pleaſures. The bruit beaſt is angry if a man keepe him too much in awe: if he bee weary hee taketh his reſt, hee ſleepeth when hee lifteth, he eateth and drinketh when hee commeth vnto it, and vnleſſe hee be compelled hee doth nothing: hee taketh no care for the common-wealth, for he neither knoweth how to follow reaſon, nor yet how to reſiſt ſenſuality. Therefore if a man at all times ſhould eate when hee deſireth, reuenge himſelfe when he is moued, commit adulterie when hee is tempted, drinke when he is thirſty, &amp; ſleep when he is drouſie, wee might more properly call ſuch a one a beaſt nouriſhed in the mountaines, then a man brought vp in the common-wealth: For him properly wee may call a mā that gouerneth himſelfe like a man; that is to ſay, conformable vnto ſuch things as reaſon willeth, &amp; not where ſenſuality leadeth.
                  Let vs leaue theſe vaine men which are aliue, and talke of them that bee dead, againſt whom wee dare ſay, that whiles they were in the world, they followed the world, and liued according to the ſame. It is not to be maruelled at, that ſince they were liuing in the world, they were noted of ſome world point. But ſeeing their vnhappy and wicked life is ended: why will

they then ſmell of the vanities of the World in their graues? It is a great ſhame and diſhonour for men of noble and ſtout hearts, to ſee in one moment the end of our life, and neuer to ſee the end of our ſolly.
                  Wee neyther reade, heare nor ſee any thing more common, then ſuch men as bee moſt vnprofitable in the Common wealth, and of life moſt reprobate, to take vpon them moſt honour whiles they liue, and to leaue behind them the greateſt memory at their death.
                  What vanity can bee greater in the world, then to eſteeme the world, which eſteemeth no man, &amp; to make no account of God who ſo greatly regardeth all men? What greater folly can there bee in man, then by much trauell to encreaſe his goods, &amp; with vaine pleaſures to looſe his ſoule? It is an olde plague in mans nature, that many (or the moſt part of men) leaue the amendement of their life farre behind: to ſet their honour the more before.
                  
                     Suetonius Tranquillus in the firſt booke of the Emperours ſayth, that A notable ſentence. Iulius Caeſar. 
                     Iulius Caeſar (no further then in Spaine in the City of Cales, now called Calis) ſaw in the Temple the triumphes of Alexāder the great painted, the which when hee had well viewed, he ſighed maruellous ſore, and being asked why hee did ſo, hee anſwered: What a wofull caſe am I in, that am now of the age of thirty yeares, and Alexander at the ſame yeeres had ſubdued the whole world, and reſted him in Babylon. And I (being as I am) a Romane, neuer did yet thing worthy of prayſe in my life, nor ſhall leaue any renowne of mee after my death.
                  
                  
                     Dion the Grecian in the ſecond booke De audacia ſayeth, that the noble Druſius, the Almaine, vſed to viſite the graues and tombes of the famous and renowmed which were buryed in Italie, and did this alwayes, eſpecially at his going to warfare: And it was asked why hee did ſo? Hee anſwered. I viſit the ſepulchers of Scipio, and of diuers others which are dead, before whom all the Earth trembled, when they were aliue: For, in beholding their proſperous ſucceſſe, I did recouer both ſtrength and ſtoutneſſe.
                  He ſaith furthermore, that it encourageth a man to fight againſt his enemyes, remembring hee ſhall leaue of him a memory in time to come.
                  
                     Cicero ſaith in his Rhethorike, and alſo Plynie maketh mention of the ſame in an Epiſtle: that there came from Thebes (in Egipt) a knight to Rome, for no other purpoſe, but only to ſee whether it were true or no, that was reported of the notable things of Rome. Whom Moecenas demanded, what he perceyued of the Romaines, and what he thought of Rome?
                  
                  He anſwered: The memory of the abſent doth more content me, then the glory 
                     A worthy ſentence of 
                     of the preſent doth ſatisfie me. And the reaſon of this is. The deſire which men haue to extoll the liuing, &amp; to be equall vnto the dead: maketh things ſo ſtraunge in their life, that they deſerue immortal fame after their death. The Romaines reioyced not a little, to heare ſuch wordes of a ſtraungers mouth, wherby he praiſed them which were departed, and exalted them which yet liued.
                  Oh what a thing it is to conſider the auncient heathens, which neyther feared Hell, nor hoped for Heauen: and yet by remembrance of weaknes, they tooke vnto them ſtrength, by cowardnes they were boldened: throgh feare, they became hardy: of dangers they tooke encouragement: of enemyes, they made friends: of pouertie, they tooke patience: of malice, they learned experience. Finally (I ſay,) they denyed their owne willes, and followed the'opinions of others, only

to leaue behind them a memorie with the dead: and to haue a little honour with the dead.
                  Oh how many are they that truſt the vnconſtantneſſe of Fortune, onely to leaue ſome notable memorie behinde them. Let vs call to minde ſome worthie examples, whereby they may ſee that to be true, which I haue ſpokē.
                  What made king Ninus to inuent ſuch warres? Queene Semiramis, to make ſuch buildings? Vliſſes the Grecian to ſulke ſo many Seas? king Alexander, to conquere ſo many Lands? Hercules the Thebane, to ſet vp his Pillars where hee did? Caius Caſar the Romaine, to giue 52. battells at his pleaſure? Cyrus King of Perſia, to ouercome both the Aſiaes? Hanniball the Carthaginian, to make ſo cruell warres againſt the Romaines? Pyrrhus king of the Epirotes, to come down into Italie? Attila, King of the Hunnes, to defie all Europe? Truely they would not haue What was the occaſiō the ancients aduentured their liues. taken vpon them ſuch daungerous enterpriſes, onely vpon the wordes of them which were in thoſe dayes preſent? but becauſe we ſhould ſo eſteem them that ſhould come after.
                  Seeing then that wee bee men, and the children of men, it is not a little to bee maruelled at, to ſee the diuerſitie betweene the one and the other: and what cowardnes there is in the hearts of ſome, and contrarywiſe what courage in the ſtomackes of others. For, we ſee commonly now-adayes, that if there bee tenne of ſtoute courages, which are deſirous with honour to dye, there are ten thouſands cowards, which through ſhamefull pleaſures ſeeke to prolong their life.
                  The man that is ambitious, thinking him moſt happie, who with much eſtimation can keepe his renowm, and with little care regard his life. And on the other ſide, hee that will ſet by his life, ſhall haue but in ſmall eſtimation his renowme.
                  The Syrians, Aſſyrians, the Thebanes, the Chaldees, the Greekes, the Macedonians, the Rhodians, the Romaines, the Hunnes, the Germains, and the Frenchmen, if ſuch Noble-men (as amongſt theſe were moſt famous) had not aduentured their liues, by ſuch daungerous Enterprizes, they had neuer got ſuch immortall fame as they had done to leaue to their poſteritie.
                  
                     Sextus Cheronenſis in his third book, of the valiant deedes of the Romaines ſaith, that the famous captaine Marcus Marcellus (which was the firſt of all men that ſaw the backe of Hannibal in the field) was demaunded of one how he durſt enter into battell with ſuch a renowmed captaine as Hanniball was? To whom he anſwered: Friend, I am a Romaine borne, and a Captaine of Rome, and I muſt daily put my life in hazard for my Countreys ſake: for, ſo I ſhall make perpetuall my renowme. Hee was demaunded againe, why hee ſtroke his enemys with ſuch fiercenes, and why hee did ſo pittifully lament thoſe which were ouercome, after the victory gotten in battell? Hee aunſwered, the Captaine which is a Romane, and is not iudged to bee a tyrant, ought with his owne hand to ſhed the bloud of his enemies, and alſo to ſhed the teares of his eyes. A captaine Romane ought more to aduance him of his clemency, then of his bloudy victory.
                  And Marcus Aurelius ſayeth further, when a Romane captaine ſhall bee in the field, hee hath an eye to his enemies, with hope to vanquiſh thē: but after they bee vanquiſhed: hee ought to remember they are men, &amp; that he might haue been ouercome: For fortune ſheweth her ſelfe in nothing ſo common, as in the ſucceſſes of warre.
                  Certainely, theſe were words well beſeeming ſuch a man, and ſurely wee may boldly ſay, that all thoſe which

ſhall heare, or reade ſuch things, will commend the wordes which that Romane ſpake: but few are they that indeed would haue done the feates that hee did. For, there be many that are readie to praiſe in their wordes that which is good: but there are fewe that in their workes deſire to followe the ſame.
                  Such hearts are vnquiet, and much altered by ſight and enuie, that they bare towardes their Auncients which throgh manfulnes attained vnto great triumphs and glorie, let them remember, what daungers and trauells they paſſed through, before they came thereto. For, there was neuer Captaine that euer triumphed in Rome, vnleſſe hee had firſt aduentured his life a thouſand times in the field, I thinke I am not deceiued, in this that I will ſay. That is to ſay, all are deſirous to taſte of the marrow of Fame-preſent: but none will breake the bone, for feare of How difficult &amp; hard a matter it is to attaine to true honour. perill enſuing. If Honour could bee bought with deſire onely, I dare boldly ſay, it would bee more eſteemed in theſe dayes of the poore page, then it was in times paſt, of the valiaunt Romaine Scipio. For, there is not at this day ſo poore a man, but would deſire honour aboue all things.
                  What a dolefull caſe is this to ſee, many gentlemen, and young Knights, become euil diſpoſed vagabonds, and loyterers: the which hearing tel of any famous battell fought: &amp; that many of their eſtate &amp; profeſſion haue don valiaunt ſeates in the ſame; immediately therewith be ſtyrred, and ſet on fire through Enuyes heate: So that in the ſame furie, they chaunge their robes into armour: and with all ſpeede prepare themſelues to warre, to exerciſe the feates of armes. And finally, (like young men without experience) make importunate ſuite, and obtain licence and money of their Friends to go vnto the warres. But after that they are once out of their Countreys, and ſee themſelues in a ſtraunge place, their dayes euill and their nights worſe: At one time they are commaunded to Skyrmiſhe, and at an other time, to watch: when they haue victualls, they want lodging: and when the pay day commeth, that pay and the next alſo is eaten and ſpent.
                  With theſe and other like troubles and diſcommodities, the poore young men are ſo aſtonyed: eſpecially when they call to minde the goodly wide Hawles, ſo well hanged and trimmed, wherein they greatly delighted, to paſſe the time in Summer-ſeaſon.
                  When they remember their great chimneys at home, wherby they comforted their old limmes and how they vſed to ſit quietly vppon the Sunnie bankes in winter. For the remembrance of pleaſures paſt, greatly augmenteth the paines preſent. Notwithſtanding their Parents and friends, had admoniſhed them therof before. And now being beaten with their owne follie, and feeling theſe diſcommodities which they thought not of before: they determine to forſake the warres, and eache one to returne home vnto his owne againe.
                  But where as they asked licence but once to goe forth, now they were enforced to aske it ten times before they could come home. And the worſt is, they went forth loden with money, &amp; returne home loden with vices. But the end why theſe things are ſpoken, is, that ſage and vertuous men ſhould marke, by what trade the euill diſpoſed, ſeeke to gaine, which is not gotten by gaſing on the windowes, but by keeping the frontiers againſt their enemies: not with playing at Tables in the Tauernes, but with fighting in the fieldes, not trimmed with cloath of gold or ſilkes, but loden with armour and weapons: not praunſing their palfreyes, but diſcouering the ambuſhment: 

not ſleeping vntill noon, but watching all night: not by aduancing him of his apparrell and handſomneſſe, but for his ſtout couragiouſnes: not banqueting his friends but aſſaulting his enemies: though a knight do theſe things, yet he ought to conſider, that it is vanitie and fooliſhneſſe.
                  But ſeeing the world hath placed honour in ſuch a vaine thing, and that they can attaine to it by none other was, the young aduenturous Gentlemen ought to employ therunto their ſtrength with ſtout courage, to atchieue to ſome great acts, worthy of renowne: For in the end when the warre is iuſtly begunne, and that in defence of their Countrey, they ought to reioyce more of him that dyeth in the hands of his enemies, then of him which liueth accompanied with vices.
                  It is a great ſhame and diſhonour to men of Armes, and young Gentelmen being at home, to heare the prayſe of them which bee in the wars, for the young Gentlemen ought not to thinke it honour for him to heare or declare the newes of others: but that others ſhould declare the vertuous deedes of him.
                  Oh how many are they in the world this day puffed vp with pride: and not very wiſe which ſtill prate of great renowne, and yet paſſe their life with ſmall honeſty: For our predeceſſors fought in the field with their lances, but young men now a dayes fight at the table with their tongues. Admit that all vaine men deſire and procure to leaue a memory of their vanitie: yet they ought to enterpriſe ſuch things in their life, wherby they might winne a famous renowne (and not a perpetuall ſhame) after their death: For there are many departed which haue left ſuch memory of their works as moueth vs rather to pitty their follie, then to enuie their vertue.
                  I aske of thoſe that reade, or heare this thing; if they will be in loue with Nembroth the firſt Tyrant? with Semiramis, which ſinned with her owne ſonne: with Antenor, that betrayed The cruelty of Tyrants heee deſcribed, &amp; layd open. 
                     Troy his countrey: with Medea, that ſlew her children: with Tarquine that enforced Lucretia: with Brutus that ſlew Caeſar: with Sylla, that ſhed ſo much bloud: with Catilina, that played the Tyrant in his countrey: with Iugurtha, that ſtrangled his brethren: with Caligula, that committed inceſt with his ſiſters: with Nero that killed his mother: with Heliogabalus, that robbed the Temples: with Domitian, that in nothing delighted ſo much, as by ſtraunge handes to put men to death, and to driue away flyes with his owne hands?
                  Small is the number of thoſe that I haue ſpoken, in reſpect of thoſe which I could recite: of whom I dare ſay and affirme, that if I had beene as they, I cannot tell what I would haue done, or what I ſhould haue deſired: but this I know, it would haue beene more paines to mee, to haue wonne that infamie which they haue wonne, then to haue loſte the life which they haue loſt.
                  It profiteth him little, to haue his Ponds full of fiſh, and his parkes full of Deere, which knoweth neyther how to hunt, nor how to fiſh. I meane to ſhewe by this, that it profiteth a man little to be in great auctoritie, if hee be not eſteemed, nor honoured in the ſame. For to attaine to honour, wiſedome is requiſite: and to keepe it, patience is neceſſarie. With great conſiderations wiſe men ought to enterpriſe daungerous things. For I aſſure them they ſhall neuer winne honour, but where they vſe to recouer ſlander.
                  Returning therefore to our matter (puiſſant Prince,) I ſweare and durſt vndertake, that you rather deſire perpetuall 

renowme through death, then any idle reſt in this life.
                  And hereof I doe not maruell, for there are ſome that ſhall alwayes declare the proweſſes of good Princes, and others which will not ſpare to open the vices of euill tyrants. For althogh your Imperial eſtate is much, and your Catholike perſon deſerueth more; yet I beleeue with my heart, and ſee with theſe eyes, that your thoughts are ſo highly bent vnto aduenturous deedes, and your heart ſo couragious to ſet vpon them, that your Maieſty little eſteemeth the inheritance of your predeceſſors, in reſpect of that you hope to gaine to leaue to your ſucceſſors.
                  A Captaine asked Iulius Caeſar (as he declareth in his Commentaries) why he trauelled in the Winter in ſo hard froſt, and in the ſummer in ſuch extreame heate. Hee aunſwered, I will doe what lyeth in mee to doe, and afterward let the fatall deſtinies doe what they can: For the valiant knight that giueth in battel the onſet, ought more to bee eſteemed then fickle fortune whereby the victory is obtained, ſince fortune giueth the one, and aduentur guideth the other.
                  Theſe words are ſpoken like a ſtout and valiant Captaine of Rome: Of how many Princes doe we reade, whom truely I much lament to ſee, what flatteries they haue heard with their eares being aliue: and to reade what ſlaunders they haue ſuſtained after their death.
                  Princes and greate Lordes ſhould haue more regard to that which is ſpoken in their abſence, then to that which is done in their preſence: not to that which they heare, but to that which they would not heare: not to that which they tell them, but to that which they would not bee told of: not to that which is written vnto them beeing aliue, but to that which is written of them after their death: not to thoſe that tell them lyes: but to thoſe which (if they durſt) would tell them truth: For men many times refrayne not their tongues, for that Subiects bee not credited: but becauſe the Prince in his authority is ſuſpected.
                  The Noble and vertuous Prince A mans owne conſcience a iudge betweene truth and lyes: ſhould not flitte from the truth wherof hee is certified, neyther with flatteries and lyes ſhould he ſuffer himſelfe to bee deceyued: but to examine himſelfe, and ſee whether they ſerue him with truth, or deceyue him with lyes. For there is no better witnes and iudge of truth, and lyes, then is a mans owne conſcience.
                  I haue ſpoken all this, to the entent your Maieſty might know, that I will not ſerue you with that you ſhould not bee ſerued. That is, for to ſhew my ſelfe in my Writing a flatterer: For it were neyther meete nor honeſt, that flatteries into the eares of ſuch a noble Prince ſhould enter: neyther that out of my mouth (which teach the truth) ſuch vaine tales ſhould iſſue. I ſay, I had rather bee diſprayſed for true ſpeaking, then to bee honoured for flattery and lying.
                  For of truth, in your Highneſſe it ſhould bee much lightneſſe for to heare them, and in my baſeneſſe great wickedneſſe to inuent them.
                  Now againe, following our purpoſe I ſay, the Hiſtories greatly doe commend Lycurgus, that gaue lawes to the Lacedemonians. Numa Pompilius, that honoured and addorned the Churches. Marcus Marcellus, that had pitty and compaſsion on thoſe which were ouercome. Iulius Caeſar, that forgaue his enemies. Octautus that was ſo welbeloued of the people.
                  
                     Alexander that gaue rewardes and gifts to all men. Hector the Troian, became

hee was ſo valiant in wars. Hercules the Thebane, becauſe hee employed his ſtrength ſo well. Vliſſes the Grecian, becauſe hee aduentured himſelfe in ſo many dangers. Pyrrhus king of Epirotes, becauſe hee inuented ſo many engines. Catullns Regulus becauſe he ſuffred ſo many torments. Titus the Emperour, becauſe he was father to the Orphanes. Traianus, becauſe he edified ſumptuous &amp; goodly buildings. The good Marcus Aurelius, becauſe he knew more then al they. I doe not ſay, that it is requiſit for one Prince in theſe dayes, to haue in him all thoſe qualities, but I dare be bolde for to affirme this, that euen as it is vnpoſſible for one Prince to follow all: ſo likewiſe it is a great ſlaunder for him to follow none.
                  Wee doe not require Princes to doe all that they can, but for to apply themſelues to do ſom thing that they ought.
                  And I ſpeake not without a cauſe that which I haue ſayde before. For if Princes did occupie themſelues as they ought to doe, they ſhould haue no time to be vicious. Plinie ſayeth in an Epiſtle, that the great Cato, called Cenſor, did weare a Ring vpon his finger, wherein was written theſe words; Eſto amicus vnius, &amp; inimicus nullius: 
                     A poeſie which Cato the Cenſor had engrauen in his Ring. which is, be friend to one, and enemy to none.
                  He that would deepely conſider theſe few words, ſhall finde therein many graue ſentences. And to apply this to my purpoſe, I ſay the Prince that would well gouerne his common weale, ſhew to all equall iuſtice, deſire to poſſeſſe a quiet life, to get among all a good fame: and that coueteth to leaue of himſelfe a perpetuall memorie, ought to embrace the vertues of one, and to reiect the vices of all: I allow it very wel that Princes ſhould bee equall, yea and ſurmount and ſurpaſſe many: but yet I doe aduiſe thē not to employ their force, but to follow one: For often times it chanceth that many which ſuppoſe themſelues in their life to excell all when they are dead, are ſcarcelie found equall vnto any.
                  Though man hath done much, and blazed what he can: yet in the end he is but one, one mind, one power, one birth, one life, and one death. Then ſithence hee is but one, let no man preſume to know more then one. Of all theſe good Princes which I haue named in the rowle of iuſtice, the laſt was Marcus Aurelius, to the intent that he ſhould weaue his webbe: For ſuppoſe we reade of many Princes that haue compiled notable things, the which are to bee reade and knowne: but all that Marcus Aurelius ſayde, or did is worthy for to be knowne, and neceſſary to bee followed. I doe not meane this Prince in his Heathen law, but in his vertuous deedes.
                  Let vs not ſtay at his beleefe: but let vs embrace the good that hee did: For compare many Chriſtians with ſome of the Heathen, and looke how farre we leaue them behind in faith: ſo farre they excell vs in good and vertuous works. All the olde Princes in times paſt, had ſome Philoſophers to their familiars, as Alexander Ariſtotle, King Darius, Herodorus: Auguſtus Piſto, Pompeius, Plauto, Titus, Plinie, Adrian, Secundus, Traion, Plutarchus, Anthonius, Apolonius, Theodotius, Claudinus, Seuerus, Fabatus.
                  
                  Finally I ſay, that Phyloſophers then had ſuch aucthoritie in Princes pallaces: that children acknowledged them for Fathers, and Fathers reuerenced them as maſters.
                  Theſe Wiſe and Sage men were aliue in the company of Princes: but the good and vertuous Marcus Aurelius (whoſe doctrine is before

your Maieſty) is not aliue, but dead: Yet therefore that is no cauſe why his Doctrine ſhould not bee admitted: For it may bee (peraduenture) that this ſhall profite vs more, which hee wrote with his handes, then that which others ſpake with their tōgus.
                  
                     Plutarch ſayeth, in the time of Alexander the great, Ariſtotle was aliue, and Homer was dead. But let vs ſee how hee loued the one, and reuerenced the other: for of truth he ſlept alwayes with Homers booke in his How much Homer was helde in account. hands, and waking he read the ſame with his eyes, and alwayes kept the doctrine thereof in his memory, and layde (when he reſted) the booke vnder his head. The which priuiledge Ariſtotle had not: who at all times could not be heard, and much leſſe at all ſeaſons be beleeued: ſo that Alexander had Homer for his friend, and Ariſtotle for a maſter.
                  Other of theſe Philoſophers were but ſimple men: but our Marcus Aurelius was both a wiſe Philoſopher, and a very valiant Prince: and therfore reaſon would hee ſhould be credited before others: For as a prince hee will declare the troubles, and as a Philoſopher hee will redreſſe them. Take you therefore (Puiſaunt Prince) this wiſe Philoſopher and Noble Emperour, for a Teacher in your youth, for a Father in your gouernment, for a Captaine generall in your Warres: for a guide in your iourneyes, for a friend in your affayres, for an example in your vertues, for a Maſter in your ſciences, for a pure white in your deſires, and for equall match in your deedes.
                  I will declare vnto you the Life of an other beeing a Heathen, and not the life of an other beeing a Chriſtian: For looke how much glory this Heathen Prince had in this world beeing good and vertuous: ſo much paines your Maieſty ſhall haue in the other, if you ſhall bee wicked and vicious.
                  Beholde, behold, moſt Noble, and illuſtrious Prince, the Life of this Emperour, and you ſhal plainly ſee and perceyue, how cleare hee was in his iudgement, how vpright hee was in his iuſtice, how circumſpect in the courſe of his life, how louing to his friends, how patient in his troubles and aduerſities: how hee diſſembled with his enemies, how ſeuere againſt Tirants, how quiet among the quiet, how great a friēd vnto the Sage, and louer of the ſimple: how aduenturous in his warres, and amiable in peace, and chiefly, and aboue all things, how high in wordes, and proſound in ſentences.
                  Many and ſundry times I haue beene in doubt with my ſelfe, whether the heauenly and eternall Maieſty (which giueth vnto you Princes the Temporall Maieſty, for to rule aboue all other in power, and authoritie) did exempt you that are earthly Princes, more from humane fraylety, then hee did vs that be but Subiects, and at the laſt I know hee did not.
                  For I ſee euen as you are children of the World, ſo you doe liue according to the World. I ſee euen as you trauell in the Worlde: ſo you can know nothing but things of the world. I ſee becauſe you liue in the Fleſh, that you are ſubiect to the miſeries of the fleſh. I ſee though for a time you doe prolong your life: yet at the laſt you are brought vnto your graue, I ſee your trauel is great and that within your Gates there dwelleth no reſt. I ſee you are colde in the winter, and hote in the Summer. I ſee that hunger feeleth you, and thirſt troubleth you, I ſee your friendes forſake you, and your enemies aſſault you.
                  
                     
I ſay that you are ſadde and do lacke ioy, I ſee that you are ſicke, and bee not well ſerued. I ſee you haue much and yet that which you lacke is more.
                  What will you ſee more, ſeeing that Princes dye: O noble Princes, and great Lords, ſince you muſt dye, and become wormes meate, why doe you not in your life time ſearch for good counſell? If the Princes and noble men commit an errour, no man dare chaſtice them, wherefore they ſtand in greater need of aduiſe and counſell: For the traueller who is out of his way, the more he goeth forward, the more hee erreth. If the people doe amiſſe, they ought to be puniſhed: but if the Prince erre, he ſhould be admoniſhed. And as the Prince will, the people ſhould at his hands haue puniſhment: ſo it is reaſon that he at their hands ſhould receyue counſell.
                  For as the wealth of the one dependeth on the wealth of the other: ſo truly if the Prince bee vitious, the people cannot be vertuous. If your Maieſty will puniſh your people with words, commaund them to print this preſent worke in their hearts. And if your people would ſerue your Highneſſe with their aduiſe: let them likewiſe beſeech you to reade ouer this booke: For therin the Subiects ſhall finde how they may amend, and you Lords ſhall ſee all that you ought to doe, whether this preſent Worke be profitable or no, I will not that my pen ſhall declare: but they which do reade it ſhall iudge.
                  For wee Authours take pains to make and tranſlate, and others for vs to giue iudgement and ſentence: From my tender yeares vntill this preſent time, I haue liued in the World, occupying my ſelfe in reading and ſtudying humane and diuine Bookes: and although I confeſſe my debility to bee ſuch, that I haue not read ſo much as I might, nor ſtudyed ſo much as I ought: yet notwithſtanding all that I haue read, hath not cauſed me to muſe ſo much as the doctrine of Marcus Aurelius 
                     The commendation of the

                  The greateſt part of all his works were in Greeke: yet hee wrote alſo many in Latine. I haue drawn this out of Greeke through the helpe of my friends, and afterwards out of latine into our vulgar toung by the trauell of my hands.
                  Let all men iudge what I haue ſuffered in drawing it out of Greeke into Latine, out of the Latine into the vulgar, and out of a plaine vulgar into a ſweete and pleaſant Stile: For that banquet is not counted ſumptuous, vnleſſe there be both pleaſant meates and ſauoury ſauces.
                  To call ſentences to minde, to place the wordes, to examine languages, to correct ſillables: What ſwet I haue ſuffered in the hote ſummer, what bitter colde in the ſharpe winter, what abſtinence from meats when I deſired for to eate, what watching in the night when I would haue ſlept: What cares I haue ſuffered in ſtead of reſt that I might haue enioyed: Let other proue, if mee they will not credit.
                  The intention of my painefull trauels, I offer vnto the diuine Maieſty vpon my knees, and to your Highneſſe (moſt Noble Prince) I preſent this my worke, and do moſt humbly beſeech the omnipotent and eternall GOD, that the Doctrine of this Booke may bee as profitable vnto you, and to the common wealth in your Life, as it hath beene vnto me tedious, and hinderance to my health: I haue thought it very good to offer to your Maieſtie, the effect

of my labours, though you peraduenture will little regarde my paines: for the requiring of my travell, and rewarde of my good will. I require nought elſe of your Highneſſe, but that the rudeneſſe of my vnderſtanding, the baſeneſſe of my Stile, the ſmalneſſe of my eloquence, the euill order of my ſentences, the vanity of my words, bee no occaſion why ſo excellent and goodly worke ſhould bee little regarded: For it is not reaſon, that a good Horſe ſhould bee the leſſe eſteemed, for that the Rider knoweth not how to make him runne his carrere.
                  I haue done what I could doe; do you now that you ought to doe, in giuing to this preſent worke grauity, and to mee the Interpretor thereof authority.
                  I ſay no more, but humbly doe beſeech God to maintaine your eſtimation and power in earth: and that you may afterward enioy the fruition of his Diuine preſence in Heauen.
                  The End of the Authors Prologue.
               
               
                  
                  THE ARGVMENT OF THE BOOKE CALled THE DIALL OF PRINCES. Wherein the Authour declareth, his Intention and manner of proceeding.
                  
                  
                     
                        ARchimenedes, the great and famous Philoſopher, (to whom Marcus Marcellus for his knowledge ſake granted life, and after vſing Nigromancy deſerued death, being demanded what time was, ſayde, That Time was the inuentor of all nouelies and a Regiſter

                     certaine of Antiquities, which ſeeth of it ſelfe, the beginning, the middeſt, &amp; the ending of all things.
                  
                  And finally, time is he that endeth all. No man can deny but the definition of this Philoſopher is true: for if Time could ſpeake, he would certifie vs of ſundry things wherin we doubt, and declare them as a witnes of ſight. Admit all things periſh, and haue an end; yet one thing is exempted, and neuer hath end, which is truth, that amongſt all things is priuiledged in ſuch wiſe, that ſhee triumpheth of time, and not time of her: For according to the diuine ſaying, It ſhal bee more eaſie to ſee heauen and earth fall, then once truth to periſh.
                  
                  There is nothing ſo entier, but may bee diminiſhed, nothing ſo healthfull but may bee diſeaſed, nothing ſo ſtrong but may bee broken, neyther any thing ſo wel kept, but may be corrupted And finally, I ſay, There is nothing but by time is ruled &amp; gouerned, ſaue onely truth, which is ſubiect to none.
                  
                  The fruits of the Spring time haue no force to giue ſuſtenance, nor perfect ſweetneſſe to giue any fauour, but after that the Summer is paſt, and harueſt commeth, they ripe: and then all that wee e ate nouriſheth more, &amp; giueth a better taſte: I meane by this when the world began to haue wiſe men, the more Philoſophers were eſteemed for their good manners, the more they deſerued to bee reproued for their euill vnderſtanding, Plato in his ſecond booke of the Commonwealth

ſayde, That the auncient Philoſophers, as well Greekes as Egyptians, The ſaying 
                           •
                        o Plato. and Caldees, which firſt began to behold the ſtarres of heauen, and aſcended to the toppe of the mount Olimpus to view the influences, and motions of the Planets of the earth, deſerued rather pardon of their ignorance, then prayſe for theyr knowledge.
                  
                     Plato ſayde further, that the Philoſophers which were before vs, were the firſt that gaue themſelus to ſearch out the truth of the Elements in the Heauen, and the firſt which ſowed errors in thinges naturall of the earth.
                  
                     Homer in his Ilyades, agreeing with Plato, ſaieth: I condemne all that the auncient phyloſophers knewe, but I greatly commend them for that they deſired to know. Certes Homer ſaide well, and Plato ſaide not amiſſe: for, if amongſt the firſt Phyloſophers, this ignorance had not raigned, there had not beene ſuch contrary Sects in euery Schoole.
                  He that hath read, not the books, which are loſt, but the opinions which the auncient Phyloſophers had, will graunt mee, though the knowledge were one, yet their ſects were diuerſe: that is to ſay, Cinici, Stoyci, Academici, Platonici, and Epicurei: which were as variable, the one from the other in their opinions, as they were repugnant in their conditions.
                  I will not, neither reaſon requireth, that my Pen ſhould bee ſo diſmeaſured, as to reprooue thoſe which are dead, for to giue the glory all onely to them that are aliue: For, the one of them knew not all, neyther were the other ignorant of all.
                  If hee deſerue thanks that ſheweth mee the way, whereby I ought to goe, no leſſe then meriteth hee, which warneth mee of that place wherein wee may erre. The ignorance of our fore-Fathers, was but a guide to keepe vs from erring: for, the errour of them ſhewed vs the Trueth, to their much praiſe, and to our great ſhame. Therefore I dare boldly ſay, If wee that are now, had been then, wee had knowne leſſe then they knewe. And if thoſe were now, which were then, they would haue knowne more then we know. And that this is true it appeareth well: for that the auncient Phyloſophers, through the great deſire they had to knowe the Truth, of ſmall and large wayes, the which wee now will not ſee, nor yet walke therein. Wherefore wee haue not ſo much cauſe to be wayle their ignoraunce, as they had reaſon to complaine The opiniō of Aulus Gellius cō
                        cerning time. of our negligence. For, truth which is, (as Aulus Gellius ſaith) the daughter of Time, hath reuealed vnto vs the errours which wee ought to eſchewe: and the true doctrines, which wee ought to follow.
                  What is there to ſee, but hath bin ſeene? what to diſcouer, but hath bin diſcouered? what is there to read, but hath bin read? what to write, but hath bin written? what is there to knowe, but hath bin knowne? Now-adayes, humaine malice is ſo experte, men ſo well able, and our wittes ſo ſubtill, that wee want nothing to vnderſtand, neyther good, nor euill. And wee vndoe ourſelues by ſeeking that vaine knowledge, which is not neceſſary for our life. No man vnder the pretence of ignoraunce can excuſe his fault, ſince all men know, all men reade, and all men learne, that which is euident

                  Suppoſe the Plough-man, and the Learned-man, do goe to the Law, and you ſhall perceyue the Labourer (vnder that ſimple garment) to forge to his Counſellour halfe a dozen of malitious trickes to delude his aduerſarie as finely as the other that is learned, ſhall bee able to expound two or three Chapters of this booke. If men would employ their knowledge

to honeſty, wiſedome, patience and mercy, it were well: but I am ſorry they know ſo much, onely for that they ſubtilly deceiue, and by vſury abuſe their neighbours, and keepe that they haue vniuſtly gotten, and dayly getting more, inuenting new trades: Finally, I ſay, if they haue any knowledge, it is not to amend their life, but rather to encreaſe their goods. If the deuil could ſleep, as mē do, he might ſafely ſleepe: for whereas he waketh to deceyue vs, wee wake to vndo our ſelues: Well, ſuppoſe that all this heretofore I haue ſayde is true. Let vs now leaue aſide craft, and take in hand knowledge. The knowledge which we attaine to is ſmall, and that which wee ſhould attain to ſo great, that all that wee know, is the leaſt part of that wee are ignorant: Euen as in things naturall, the Elements haue their operations, according to the varietie of time: ſo morall Doctrines (as the aged haue ſucceeded) and ſciences were diſcouered. Truly all fruites come not together, but when one fayleth, another commeth in ſeaſon.
                  I meane, that neyther all the Doctors among the Chriſtians, nor all the Philoſophers among the Gentiles were concurrant at one time; but after the death of one good, there came another better. The chiefe wiſdome which meaſured all thinges by iuſtice, and diſpearſeth them according to his bounty, will not that at one time they ſhould bee all Wiſemen, and at another time all ſimple: For it had not beene reaſon that one ſhould haue had the fruit, and the other the leaues.
                  The old world that ranne in Saturnes dayes (otherwiſe called the golden world) was of a truth much eſteemed of them that ſaw it, and greatlie commended of them that wrote of it: That is to ſay, it was not guided by the Sages which did guild it: but becauſe there was no euill men, which did vnguilde it: For as the experience of the meane eſtate and Nobility teacheth vs, of one onely perſon dependeth as well the fame and renowne, as the infamy of a whole houſe and parentage.
                  That age was called golden, that is to ſay, of gold: and this our age is called yron, that is to ſay of iron. This difference was not, for that gold then was found, and now yron: nor for The reaſon why this is called the Iron-age. that in this our age there is want of them that be ſage: but becauſe the number of them ſurmounreth that be at this day malicious. I confeſſe one thing, and ſuppoſe many will fauour mee in the ſame.
                  
                     Phauorin the Philoſopher (which was maſter to Aulus Gelius, and his eſpeciall friend) ſaide oft-times, that the Phyloſophers in olde time, were holden in reputation: Becauſe there were fewe teachers, and many learners: We now-adayes ſee the contrarie: For infinite are they which preſume to bee Maiſters: but fewe are they which humble themſelues to be Schollers. A man may know how little Wiſe-men are eſteemed at this houre, by the great veneration that the Phyloſophers had, in the olde time.
                  What a matter is it to ſee Homer amongſt the Grecians, Salomon amōgſt the Hebrewes, Lycurgus amongſt the Lacedemonians: Phoromeus alſo amongſt the Greeks, Ptolomeus amongſt the Egiptians, Liuius amongſt the Romaines: and Cicero likewiſe amongſt the Latines: Appolonius amongſt the Indyans, and Secundus, amongſt the Aſsyrians?
                  
                  How happie were thoſe Phyloſophers, (to bee as they were, in thoſe dayes) when the world was ſo full of ſimple perſonnes, and ſo deſtitute of Sage men: that there flocked great numbers out of diuers countreys, and

ſtraunge Nations, not onely to heare their doctrine: but alſo to ſee theyr perſons.
                  The glorious Saint Hierome, in the prologue, to the Byble, ſayth: When Rome was in her proſperitie, then wrote Titus Lyuius his deedes: yet notwithſtanding, men came to Rome, more to ſpeake with Titus Linius, then to ſee Rome, or the high capitol therof. Marcus Aurelius writing to his friend Pulio, ſaide theſe wordes: Thou ſhalt vnderſtand (my Friende,) I was not choſen Emperor for the Noble bloud of my predeceſſors: nor, for the fauour I had amongſt them now preſent: For there were in Rome, of greater bloud, and Riches then I, but the (Emperour Adrian my Maiſter) ſet his eyes vpon mee: and the Emperor Anthonie my Father in law, choſe mee for his Sonne in law: for none other For what cauſe Marcus Aurelius was choſen Emperour. cauſe, but for that they ſaw me a friend of the Sages, and an enemie of the ignoraunt.
                  Happie was Rome to chuſe ſo wiſe an Emperour, and no leſſe happie was he to attaine vnto ſo great an Empire. Not for that hee was heire to his predeceſſours, but for that hee gaue his minde to ſtudie. Truely, if that Age were then happie to enioy his perſon: no leſſe happie ſhall ours bee now at this preſent, to enjoy his doctrine. Saluſt ſaith, they deſerued great glory, which did worthie feates: and no leſſer merited they, which wrote them in high ſtile.
                  What had Alexander the great bin, if Quintus-Curtius had not written of him? what of Vlyſſes, if Homer had not bin borne? what had Alcybiades bin, if Zenophon had not exalted him? what of Cyrus, if the phyloſopher Chilo had not put his actes in memorie? what had been of Pyrrus king of the Epyrotes, if Hermicles chronicles were not? what had bin of Scipio the great Affricane, if it had not bin for the Decades of Titus Liuius? what had been of Traian, if the renowmed Plutarch had not bin his friend? what of Nerua, and Anthonius the meeke, if Phocion the Greeke had not made mention of them? How ſhould wee haue knowne the ſtoute courage of Caeſar, and the great proweſſe of Pompeius, if Lucanus had not written them? what of the twelue Caeſars, if Suetonius Tranquillus had not compyled a booke of their liues? And how ſhould we haue knowne the antiquities of the Hebrues if the vpright Ioſeph had not beene?
                  Who could haue knowne the comming of the Lombardes, into Italie, if Paulus Dyaconus had not writ it? How could we haue knowne the comming in, and the going out of the Gothes in Spayne if the curious Roderious had not ſhowed it vnto vs?
                  By theſe things we haue ſpoken of before, the Readers may perceyue what is due vnto the Hyſtoriographers: who in my opinion, haue left as great memorie of them, for that they wrote with their pennes: as the Princes haue done, for that they did with their ſwords. I confeſſe I deſerue nor to be named amongſt the Sages, neyther for that I haue written and Tranſlated, nor yet for that I haue compoſed.
                  Therefore (the Sacred and diuine letters ſet aſide) there is nothing in the world ſo curiouſly written, but needeth correction: and as I ſay of the one, ſo will I ſay of the other, and that is: as I with my will doe renounce the glory, which the good for my learning would giue mee: ſo in like manner euill men ſhall not want, that againſt my will ſeeke to defame it.
                  Wee other writers, ſmally eſteeme that labour and paines wee haue to write, although indeede wee are not ignorant of a thouſaund enuious tongues, that will backbite it.
                  Many now adayes are ſo euil taught,

or to ſay better, ſo enuious, that when the Author laboreth in his ſtudy, they play in the ſtreetes: when he awaketh, they ſleepe, when he faſteth, they eate: when hee ſitteth turning the leaues of the booke: they goe hunting after vices abroade: yet for all that, they will preſume to iudge, depraue, and condemne an other mans doctrine, as if they had the authoritie that Plato had in Greece, or the eloquence that Cicero had in Rome.

                     liſhed, in hyſtories well grounded, in Greeke-letters very expert, and deſirous to ſpend his time with good bookes: this ſo Heroicall and noble a perſonage, I would deſire him to put my doctrine vnder his feete. For it is no ſhame, for a vertuous and wiſe man, to be corrected of an other wiſe man. Yet I would gladly know what patiēce can ſuffer, or heart can diſſemble, when two or three bee aſſembled together at meate, and after (at the table or otherwiſe) one of them taketh a booke at aduenture in his handes againſt that which another will ſay it is The diuerſity of mens opinions. too long, and another will ſay, it ſpeaketh not to the purpoſe: another, it is very obſcure: &amp; another, the words are not well couched: another will ſay, all that is ſpoken is fayned; One will ſay, hee ſpeaketh nothing of profite: another, hee is too curious, and the other, hee is too malicious. So that in ſpeaking thus, the doctrine remaineth ſuſpitious, and the Authour ſcapeth not ſcot-free.
                  Suppoſe them to be therefore ſuch that ſpeake it (as I haue ſpoken of) &amp; that at the Table do finde ſuch faults, ſure, they deſerue pardon: for they ſpeake not according to the Bookes which they haue read, but according to the cups of wine which they haue drunke: For that, Hee that taketh not in ieſt which is ſpoken at the Table, knoweth not what ieſting meaneth.
                  
                  It is an olde cuſtom to murmure at vertuous deedes, and into this rule entreth not onely thoſe that make them, but alſo thoſe which writethem afterwards.
                  Which thing ſeemeth to be true, for that Socrates was reproued of Plato, Plato of Ariſtotle, Ariſtotle of Auerois, Sicilius of Vulpitius, Lelius of Varro, Marinus of Ptolomeus, Ennius of Horace, Seneca of Aulus Gelius, Craſtoneſtes of Strabo, Theſſale of Gellian, Hermagoras of Cicero, Cicero of Saluſt, Origines of Saint Hierome, Hierome of Rufinus, Rufinus of Donatus. Donatus of Proſper, and Proſper of Lupus.
                  
                  Then ſith that in theſe men, and in their workes hath beene ſuch need of correction, which were men of great knowledge, and Lanternes of the World: It is no maruell at all that I haue ſuch fortune, ſince I know ſo little as I doe. Hee may worthily One ought not raſhly to cōdemne another mans wryting. bee counted vaine and light, which at the firſt ſight, as for onely once reading, will raſhly iudge that which a wiſe man with much diligence &amp; ſtudy hath written.
                  The Authors and Writers are oft times reproued, not of them which can tranſlate, and compile workes: but of thoſe which cannot reade, and yet leſſe vnderſtand them, to the entent ſimple folkes ſhould count them wiſe, and take their parts in condemning this worke, and eſteeme him for a great wiſe man. I take God to witneſſe who can iudge, whether my intention were good or ill, to compile this worke, and alſo I lay this my doctrine at the feet of wiſe and vertuous men, to the end they may be protectors, and defendours of the ſame: For I truſt in God, though ſom would come to blame (as diuers do) the ſimple words which I ſpake: yet others would not fayle to relate the good intention that I meant.
                  
                     
And to declare further I ſay, that diuers have written of the time of the ſayde Marcus Aurelius, as Herodian wrote little, Eutropius leſſe, Lampridius not ſo much, and Iulius Capitolinus ſomewhat more.
                  Likewiſe yee ought to know, that the Maſters which taught Marcus Aurelius ſciences, were Iunius Ruſticus, Cinna Catullus, Sextus Cheronenſis, which was nephew to the great Plutarke.
                  
                  Theſe three were thoſe, that principally, as witneſſes of ſight, wrote the moſt part of his life and doctrine. Many may maruel to heare tell of the doctrine of Marcus Aurelius, ſaying it hath beene kept hidde and ſecret a great while, and that of mine owne head I haue inuented it. And that there neuer was any Marcus Aurelius in the world. I know not what to ſay now vnto them; for it is euident to all thoſe which haue read any thing that Marcus Aurelius was husband to Fauſtine, father to Comodus, brother to Anntus Verus, and ſonne in Law to Antoninus Pius, the ſeuenth (of Rome) Emperour
                  Thoſe which ſay, I only haue made this doctrine, truly I thanke them for ſo ſaying, but not for their ſo meaning: For truly the Romanes would haue ſet my Image in Rome for perpetuall renowne, if ſo graue ſentences ſhould haue proceeded frō my head. Wee ſee that in our time which was neuer ſeene before, and heare that we neuer heard before. VVe practiſe not in a new world, and yet wee maruell that there is at this preſent a newe booke.
                  Not for that I was curious to diſcouer Marcus Aurelius, or ſtudious to tranſlate him. For, truely it is worthy he bee noted of wiſe perſons, and not accuſed of enuious tongues. For, it chaunceth oftentimes in Hunting, that the moſt ſimpleſt man killeth the Deare.
                  
                  The laſt thing which the Romaines conquered in Spayne, was Cantabria, which was a citie in Nauarre, ouer againſt La-grogne, and ſcituated in a high Countrey, where there is now a vaine of Vines. And the Emperour Auguſtus which deſtroyed it, made tenne bookes, De Bello Cantabrico: wherein are many thinges worthie of noting, and no leſſe pleaſaunt in reading, which happened vnto him, in the ſame conqueſt.
                  As Marcus Aurelius was brought mee from Florence, ſo was this other booke, Of the warres of Cantabria, brought mee from Colleyne. If perhaps I tooke paines to Tranſlate this booke, as few haue done which haue ſeene it, they would ſpeake the like of it, that they did of Marcus Aurclius. Becauſe men are ſo long in ſpeaking, and ſo briefe in ſtudying, that without any let or ſhame, they will auowe no Booke to be in the world this day, but that they haue eyther reade, or ſeene it.
                  I haue as much profited in this writing, which is humane: as other Doctours haue done in matters, which are diuine. It is not tranſlated word for word, but ſentence for ſentence. For wee other Enterpreters, are not bound to giue wordes by meaſure: but it ſufficeth vs to giue Sentences by weight.
                  I beganne to ſtudie this worke in the yeare, a thouſand, fiue hundred, and eyghteene: and vntill the yeare The time when the Author began to tranſlate the booke of Marcus Aurelius. a thouſand fiue hundred, twentie and ſoure, I could neyther vnderſtand, nor know wherein I was occupyed: and albeit I (kept it as ſecrete as I could) for the ſpace of ſixe yeares, yet it was knowne abroad: whervpon the Emperour his Majeſtie, being with the Feauer diſeaſed, ſent to mee for it, to paſſe the time away. And I (according to his commaundement) ſhewed him Marcus Aurelius that then was

vncorrected, and humbly beſeeching him ſayde: That for recompence of all my trau
                           •
                        l
                           •
                        , I deſired no other rewarde, but that no man in his Chamber might copie the Booke.
                  
                  And in the meane time proceeded to accompliſh the worke, becauſe I did not meane in ſuch manner to publiſh it: for otherwiſe, I ſaide his Majeſtie ſhould be euill ſerued, and I alſo of my purpoſe preuented: but my ſinnes cauſed that the Booke was coppyed, The booke of Marcus Aurelius, at the first imprinted, without the knowledge of the Authour. and conueyed from one to another: and by the hands of Pages ſunday times written, ſo that there increaſed daily in it errours, and faultes.
                  And ſince there was but one originall copie, they brought it vnto me to correct: which if it could haue ſpoken, would haue complained it ſelfe, more of them that did write it, then of thoſe that did ſteale it.
                  And thus when I had finiſhed the worke, &amp; thought to haue publiſhed it: I perceyued that Marcus Aurelius was now imprinted at Seuill: And in this caſe, I take the Readers to be judges, between mee and the imprinters, becauſe they may ſee, whether it may ſtand with Law, and juſtice, that a Booke which was to his Imperiall Maieſtie dedicated: the author thereof being but an jnfant, and the booke ſo vnperfite and vncorrected, without my conſent or knowledge ſhould bee publiſhed.
                  Notwithſtanding, they ceaſed not, but printed it againe in Portugall, and alſo in the Kingdome of Nauarre: And if the firſt impreſſion was faulty, truely the ſecond and the third were no leſſe. So that which was written for the wealth and good of all men generally, each man did applye to the profite of himſelfe particularly.
                  There chaunced another thing of this booke, called The golden booke of Marcus Aurelius, which I am aſhamed to ſpeake; but greater ſhame they ſhould haue, that ſo diſhoneſtly haue done. That is: ſome made themſelus to be authors of the whole worke: Others ſay, that parte of it was made, and compyled of their owne heads: the which appeareth in a booke in priut, wherein the authour did like a man voyd of all honeſty, &amp; in another booke, one vſed likewiſe the wordes which Marcus Aurelius ſpake to Fauſtine, when ſhee asked him the key of his Studie.
                  After theſe Theeues came to my knowledge, iudge you whether it were ynough to prooue my patience? For, I had rather they had robbed me of my goods, then taken away my renowme.
                  By this all men may ſee, that Marcus Aurelius was not then corrected, nor in any place perfect, whereby they might perceyue, that it was not my minde to Tranſlate Marcus Aurelius, but to make a Dyall for Princes: whereby all Chriſtian people may be gouerned and ruled. And as the doctrine is ſhewed for the vſe of manie: ſo I would profite my ſelfe, with that which the wiſe men had ſpoken and written. And in this ſort proceedeth the worke, wherein I put one or two chapters of mine, and after I put ſome Epiſtles of Marcus Aurelius, and other doctrine of ſome Auncient men.
                  Let not the Reader bee deceyued, to thinke hat the one, and the other is of the Authour. For, although the phraſe of the Language be mine, yet I confeſſe the greateſt part that I knew, was of another mans, althogh the Hiſtoriographers and Doctours, (with whom I was holpen) were manie: yet the doctrine which I wrote, was but one.
                  I will not denye, but I haue left out ſome things which were ſuperfluous: in whoſe ſteade I haue placed things more ſweete and profitable. So that it needeth good wittes, to make

which ſeemeth in one language to be groſſe, in another to giue it the apparance of gold.
                  I haue deuided into three books this preſent Dyall of Princes. The firſt treateth, that the Prince ought to bee a good Chriſtian.
                  The ſecond, how hee ought for to gouerne his wife and children.
                  The third teacheth, how he ſhould gouerne his perſon, and his Common wealth. I had begunne another booke, wherein was contained, how a Prince ſhould behaue himſelfe in his Court and Pallace, but the importunity of my friendes, cauſed me to withdraw my penne, to the end I might bring this worke to light.
                  The end of the Argument.

                        AFter the death of the Emperour Antoninus Pius, in the 695. years frō the foundatiō of Rome, and in the 173. Olimpiade: Fuluius Cato, and Cneus Patroclus, then being Conſuls: the fourth day of October, in the high Capitoll of Rome, at the ſute of the whole Romane people, &amp; with the aſſent of the ſacred Senate, Marcus Aurelius Antonius was proclaimed Emperour vniuerſall of the whole Romane Monarchie.
                     This noble Prince was naturally 
                           Marcus Aurelius a Romane born. of Rome borne, in the mount Celio, on the ſixt day before the Calends of May, which (after the Latines account) is the 26. day of Aprill. His Grandfather was called Annius Verus, and was choſen Senatour in the time of the Emperours Titos and Veſpaſian. His great Grandfather was named Annius Verus, which was borne in Spaine, in the free town of Gububa, when the wars were moſt cruell betweene Caeſar and Pompeius: at what time many Spaniards fledde to Rome, and many Romaines ranne into Spaine. By this meanes this Emperour had a great Grandfather, a Romane, and a great Grandmother, a Spaniard. His Father was named Annius Verus after his Grandfather, and Great Grandfather, by reaſon whereof the ancient Hiſtoriographers call him Marcus Antonius Verus.
                     
                     
                        
And true it is, that the Emperour Adrian called him Marcus Veriſsimus, for that hee neuer forged lye, nor ſwarued at any time from the truth. Theſe Annti Veri were a kindred in Rome (as Iulius Capitolinus reporteth) which vaunted themſelues to come of Numa Pompelius, and Quintus Curtius the famous Romane: which (to worke the Romane people ſafety and his owne perſon euerlaſting memory) willingly threw himſelfe into the Gulfe, A

This Emperours mother was called Domitta Camilla, as recounteth Cinna in the bookes that hee wrote of the Romaine pedigrees. That ſtocke of Camilli, was in thoſe daies highly honoured in Rome: for that they conuayed their diſcent from that Camillus, which was the renowmed and valiant Romane Captaine, who deliuered Rome when the Gaules had taken it, and beſieged the Capitoll. The men that ſprang of this linage, bare the name of Camilli, for remembrance of this Camillus. And the woman that came of the ſame ſtocke kept the name of Camilla, in memory of a daughter of the ſaid Camillus. This Camilla refuſed mariage, and choſe to liue among the vaſtall virgins: and there long ſpace remained, enduring a ſharpe and hard life. And ſhee was ſo vertuous a Romane, and preciſe in her life, that in the time of Seuerus Emperour of Rome, her Tombe was honoured as a Relique, whereon was engraued this Epitaph.

                     And this was written in Heroycall verſe in the Greeke tongue, with a maruellous haughty ſtile. But to our matter, yee ſhall vnderſtand, that the Romanes kept a certaine Law in the 12. Tables, the words whereof were theſe:
                     
                        Wee ordaine and commaund, that all the Romanes ſhall for euer haue ſpeciall 
                        A worthy law among the Romās. 
                        priuiledge in euery ſuch place, where their anceſtors haue done to the Romane people any notable ſeruice. For it is reaſon that where the Citizen aduentureth his life, there the City ſhould doe him ſome honour after his death. By vertue of this law all the family of Camilli euer enioyed the keeping of the high Capitoll, for that (by his force and policie) he chaſed the French men from the ſiege. Truly, it is not vnknowne, that this noble Knight and valiant Captaine Camillus did other things as great, and greater then this; but becauſe it was done within the circuit of Rome, it was eſteemed aboue all his other acts and proweſſe. And herein the Romanes ſwarued not far from reaſon, for that, amongſt all princely vertues, is eſteemed to bee the chiefeſt and worthieſt, which is employed to the profit of the common-wealth. The Romane Chronaclers with tears ceaſe not to lament the ruine of their Country, ſeing that variety of time, the multitude of Tyrants, the cruelty of ciuill wars, were occaſion that the ancient ſtate of the Romane gouernement, came to vtter deſtruction, and in ſteade thereof a new and euill trade of life to bee placed. And hereof no man ought to Chaunges of rulers breed flor

                        Pulto ſayth, That for no alteration which befell to the common weale, for no calamity that euer Rome ſuffered, that priuiledge was taken away from the linage of Camilli, (I meane the gouernment of the high Capitoll) except it were in the time of Silla the Conſull, when this family was ſore perſecuted, for none other cauſe but for that they fauored the Conſull Marius. This cruell Silla being dead, and the pittifull Iulius Caeſar preuayling, all the baniſhed men from Rome returned home againe to the common-wealth.
                     As touching the Aunceſtors of the Emperour Marcus Aurelius, what hath beene their trade of life, eſtate, pouerty, or riches, ſtanding in fauor or diſpleaſure, what proſperity or aduerſity they haue had or ſuffered, wee finde not in writings, though with great diligence they haue beene ſearched for. And the cauſe hereof was, for that the ancient writers of the Romane Hiſtories, touched the liues of Concerning the Father of Marcus Aurelius. the Emperors fathers (ſpecially when they were made Princes) more for the good merites that were in the children, then for the great eſtimation that came from the Fathers; Iulius Capitolinus ſayth, That Annius Verus (father of Marcus Aurelius) was pretor of the Rhodian Armies, and alſo warden in other Frontiers in the time of Trayan the good, Adrian the wiſe, and Anthony the mercifull. Which Emperours truſted none with their Armies, but diſcreet &amp; valiant men. For good Princes choſe alwayes ſuch Captaines, as can with wiſdom guide the Armie, and with valiantnes giue the battell. Though the Romanes had ſundry wars in diuers places, yet chiefly they kept great Garriſons alwayes in foure parts of the world. That is to ſay, in Bizantium (which now is Conſtantinople) to reſiſt the Parthiens: in Gades, (which now is called Galizia) to withſtand the Portugales: in the riuer of Rein to defend The Romanes foure Garriſons. themſelues from the Germaines: and at Coloſſus (which now is called the Ile of Rhodes) for to ſubdue the Barbarians.
                     
                     In the moneth of Ianuarie, when the Senate diſtributed their offices, Diſtribution of offices. the Dictator being appointed for ſixe monethes, and the two Conſuls choſen for one yeare: incontinently in the third place, they choſe foure of the moſt renowmed perſons to deſend the ſaid foure daungerous Frontiers. For the Romanes neyther feared the paines of hell nor truſted for reward in heauen: but ſought by all occaſions poſſible in their life time to leaue ſome notable memory of them after their death. And the Romaine was counted moſt valiant, and of the Senate beſt fauoured, to whom they committed the charge of the moſt cruell and dangerous warres. For their ſtrife was not to beare rule, and to be in office, or to get money: but to be in the Frontiers, to ouercome their enemies.
                     In what eſtimation theſe foure Frontiers were, wee may eaſily perceyue, Honourable Armies of the Romans by that wee ſee the moſt noble Romanes haue paſſed ſome part of their youth in thoſe places as Captaines, vntill ſuch time that (for more weighty affaires) they were appointed from thence to ſom other places. For at that time there was no word ſo grieuous and iniurious to a Citizen, as to ſay, Goe thou haſt neuer beene brought vp in the wars: and to proue the ſame by examples. The great Pompey paſſed the Winter ſeaſon in Conſtantinople: The aduenturous Scipio in Colonges, the couragious Caeſar in Gades, and the renowmed Marius in Rhodes. And theſe foure were not only in the Frontiers aforeſaid in their youth, but there they did ſuch valiant acts, that the memory of them remaineth euermore after

their death. Theſe thinges I haue ſpoken to proue, ſith wee finde that Marcus Aurelius father was Captain of one of theſe 4. Frontiers: it followeth, that he was a man of ſingular wiſdome and proweſſe. For as Scipio ſayd to his friend Maſiniſſa in Affrike, It is not poſſible for a Romane Captaine to want eyther wiſdome or courage, for thereunto they were predeſtined at their birth. Wee haue no authenticke authorities, that ſheweth vs frō whence, when, or how, in what countries, Gb

                           uation among the Roman Antiquaries and with what perſons this captaine paſſed his youth. And the cauſe is, for that the Romane Chroniclers were not accuſtomed to write the things done by their Princes, before they were created, but onely the acts of yong men, which from their youth had their hearts ſtoutly bent to great aduentures: and in my opinion it was well done. For it is greater honour to obtaine an Empire by policy and wiſdome, then to haue it by diſcent, ſo that there be no tyranny. Suetonius Tranquillus in his firſt booke of Emperours, counteth at large the aduenturous enterpriſes taken in hand by Iulius Caeſar in his yong age, and how far vnlikely they were from thought, that he ſhould euer obtaine the Romane Empire; writing this to ſhew vnto Princes, how earneſtly Iulius Caeſars heart was bent to win the Romane Monarchy, and likewiſe how wiſdom fayled him in behauing himſelfe therin.
                     A Philoſopher of Rome, wrote to Phalaris the Tirant, which was in Cicilia, 
                        The anſwere of Phalaris to a Romane Philoſopher asking him, Why hee poſſeſſed the realme ſo long by tyranny? Phalaris anſwered him againe in another Epiſtle in theſe few wordes. Thou calleſt mee tyrant, becauſe I haue taken this realme, and kept it 32. yeares. I graunt then, (quoth hee) that I was a tyrant in vſurping it: For no man occupyeth another mans right, but by reaſon he is a tyrant: But yet I will not agree to be called a Tyrant, ſith it is now xxxii. yeares ſince I haue poſſeſſed it. And though I haue atchieued it by tyranny, yet I haue gouerned it by wiſdome. And I let thee to vnderſtand, that to take another mans goods, it is an eaſie thing to conquere, but a hard thing to keepe an eaſie thing: for to keepe them, I enſure thee it is very hard. The Emperour Marcus Aurelius married the daughter of Antoninus Pius, the 16. Emperour of Rome, and ſhe was named Fauſtina, who as ſole Heyre had the Empire, and ſo through marriage Marcus Aurelius came to be Emperour. This Fauſtine was not ſo honeſt and chaſt, as ſhee was faire and beautifull. Shee had by him two ſonnes, Commodus and Veriſſimus.
                     
                     
                        Marcus Aurelius triumphed twice, The triumphes of Marcus Aurelius. once when he ouercame the Parthians, and another time when hee conquered the Argonants. He was a man very well learned, and of a deepe vnderſtanding. Hee was as excellent both in the Greeke and Latine, as hee was in his mothers tongue. Hee was very temperate in eating and drinking, hee wrote many things full of good learning and ſweete ſentences. He dyed in conquering the realme of Pannonia, which is now called Hungarie. His death was as much bewayled, as his life was deſired. And hee was loued ſo deare and entirely in the City of Rome, that euery Romane had a ſtatue of him in his houſe, to the end the memory of him (among them) ſhould neuer decay. The which was neuer read that they euer did for any other King or Emperour of Rome, no not for Auguſtus Caeſar, who was beſt beloued of all other Emperours of Rome.
                     Hee gouerned the Empire for the ſpace of eighteene yeere with vpright iuſtice, and died at the age of 63 yeeres with much honor, in the yeere

Climatericke, which is in the 63. years wherein the life of man runneth in great perill. For then are accompliſhed the nine ſeuens, or the ſeuen nines. Aulus Gelius writeth a Chapter The Climateriall yeares of mans life. of this matter, in the booke De noctibus Atticis. Marcus Aurelius was a Prince, of life moſt pure, of doctrine moſt profound, and of fortune moſt happy of all other Princes in the world, ſaue only for Fauſtine his wife, and Commodus his ſonne. And to the end we may ſee what Marcus Aurelius was from his infancy, I haue put here an Epiſtle of his, which is this.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II. Of a letter which Marcus Aurelius ſent to his friend Pulio, wherein he declareth the order of his whole life: and amongſt other things, he maketh mention of a thing that happened to a Romane Cenſor, with his Hoſt of Campagnia.
                     
                     
                        
                           MAreus Aurelius, only Emperour of Rome, greeteth thee his old friend Pulio, wiſheth health to thy perſon, &amp; peace to the commonwealth. As I was in the Temple of the Veſtall Virgins, a letter of thine was preſented vnto me, which was written long before, and greatly deſired of me: but the beſt therof is, that thou writing vnto me briefly, deſireſt that I ſhould write vnto thee at large: which is vndecent for the authority of him that is chiefe of the Empire, in eſpeciall, if ſuch one be couetous: for to a Prince there is no greater infamy then to be lauiſh of words, and ſcant of rewards. Thou writeſt to me of the griefe in thy leg, and that thy wound is great: and truly the paine thereof troubleth me at my heart, and I am right ſorry that thou wanteſt that which is neceſſary for thy health, and that good that I do wiſh thee. For in the end, all the trauels of this life may be endured, ſo that the body with diſeaſes be not troubled.
                     Thou letteſt me vnderſtand by thy letters, that thou art arriued at Rhodes and requireſt me to write vnto thee, how I liued in that place when I was yong, what time I gaue my minde to ſtudy, and likewiſe what the diſcourſe of my life was, vntill the time of my being Emperor of Rome. In this caſe truly I maruell at thee not a little, that thou ſhouldeſt aſke me ſuch a queſtion, and ſo much the more, that thou didſt not conſider, that I cannot with out great trouble and paine anſwere thy demand. For the doings of youth in a yong man were neuer ſo vpright &amp; honeſt, but it were more honeſt to The imperfections of young men deſerue no publication amend them, then to declare them. Annius Verus my father, ſhewing vnto me his fatherly loue (not accompliſhing yet fully 13. years) drew me frō the vices of Rome, and ſent mee to Rhodes to learn ſcience, howbeit better accompanied with books, then loden with money, where I vſed ſuch diligence, and fortune ſo fauored me that at the age of 26. years, I read openly natural and moral Philoſophy, and alſo Rhetoricke: and there was nothing gaue mee ſuch occaſion to ſtudy, and reade books, as the want of money; For pouerty cauſeth good mens children to be vertuous, ſo that they attaine to that by vertue, which others com vnto by riches. Truely friend Pulio, I found great want of the pleaſures of Rome, eſpecially at my firſt comming into the Iſle; but after I had read Philoſophy x. yeares at Rhodes, I tooke my ſelfe as one born in the countrey. And I think my conuerſation among them cauſed it ſeeme no leſſe. For it is a rule that neuer faileth, That vertue maketh a ſtranger grow naturall in a ſtrange country, and vice maketh the naturall a ſtranger in his owne countrey,
                        
Thou knoweſt well, how my Father A moſt wiſe and worthy obſeruation. 
                        Annius Verus was 15. years a Captain in the Frontiers againſt the barbarous by the commandement of Adrian my Lord and Maſter, and Antoninus Pius my Father in Law, both of them Princes of famous memory: which recommended mee there to their olde friends, who with fatherly counſell exhorted me, to forgette the vices of Rome, and to accuſtome my ſelfe to the vertues of Rhodes. And truely, it was but needfull for mee: For the naturall loue of the country oft times, bringeth damage to him that is borne therein, leading his deſire ſtill to returne home.
                     
                     Thou ſhalt vnderſtand, that the Rhodians are men of much courteſie, and requiting benenolences, which chanceth in few Iſles: becauſe that naturally they are perſons deceitfull, ſubtill, vnthankefull, and full of ſuſpition. I ſpeake this, becauſe my Fathers friends alwaies ſuccored me with counſel &amp; mony: which 2 things were ſo neceſſary, that I could not tell which of them I had moſt need of. For the ſtranger maketh his profite with money, to withſtand diſdainefull pouerty, &amp; profiteth himſelf with counſel to forget the ſweet loue of his country. I deſired then to reade Philoſophie in Rhodes, ſo long as my Father continued there Captaine. But that could not bee, for Adrian my Lord, ſent for me to return to Rome, which pleaſed me not a litle, albeit (as I haue ſaid) they vſed me as if I had beene borne in that Iland, for in the end, Although the eyes bee fedde with delight to 
                        The heart of a man is ſeldome ſatisfied. 
                        ſee ſtrange things, yet therefore the heart is not ſatiſfied. And this is all that touched the Rhodians. I will now tell thee alſo, how before my going thither, I was borne and brought vp in mount Celio (in Rome) with my father from mine infancie.
                     In the common wealth of Rome, there was a law vſed, and by cuſtome well obſerued, that no Citizen which enioyed any liberty of Rome (after their ſonnes had accompliſhed tenne yeares) ſhould bee ſo bold or hardy, to ſuffer them to walke the ſtreetes A notable cuſtome in Rome. like vacabonds. For it was a cuſtome in Rome, that the children of the Senators ſhould ſucke till two yeares of age, till foure they ſhould liue at their own willes, till ſixe they ſhould reade, till eight they ſhould write, til ten they ſhould ſtudy Grammer, and ten years accompliſhed they ſhould then take ſome craft or occupation, or giue themſelues to ſtudy, or goe to the warres: ſo that throughout Rome, no man was idle.
                     In one of the lawes of the twelue Tables were written theſe words. Wee ordaine and commaund, that euery Citizen that dwelleth within the circuite of Rome, or Liberties of the ſame, from ten yeares vpwards, to keepe his ſon well ordered.
                     
                     And if perchance the child being idle, or that no man teaching him any craft or ſcience, ſhould thereby peraduenture fall to vice, or commit ſome wicked offence, that then the Father (no leſſe then the Sonne) ſhould bee puniſhed. For there is nothing ſo much breedeth vice amongſt the people, as when the Fathers are too negligent, and the children bee too bold.
                     
                     And furthermore, another Law ſayde. Wee ordaine and commaund, that after tenne yeares bee paſt, for the firſt offence that the child ſhall commit in Rome, that the Father ſhall bee bound to ſend him forth ſome where elſe, or to bee bound ſurety for the good demeanour of his Sonne. For it is not reaſon, that the fond loue of the Father to the Sonne, ſhould bee an occaſion why the multitude ſhould bee ſlaunred: Becauſe all the wealth of the Empire 
                        The happines of any Kingdome. 
                        conſiſteth, in keeping and maintaining
                        
                        quiet men, and in baniſhing, and expelling ſeditious perſons.
                     
                     I will tell thee one thing (my Pulio) and I am ſure thou wilt maruell at it, and it is this. When Rome triumphed, and by good wiſdome gouerned all the world, the inhabitants in the ſame ſurmounted the number of two hundred thouſand perſons, which was a maruellous matter. Amongſt whom (as a man may iudge) there was a hundred thouſand children, But they which had the charge of them kept them in ſuch awe and doctrine, that they baniſhed from Rome one of the ſonnes of Cato Vticenſis, for breaking an earthen pot in a Maydens hands which went to fetch water. In like manner they baniſhed the ſonne of good Cinna, only for entring into a garden to gather fruit. And none of theſe two were as yet fifteene yeeres old. For at that time they chaſtiſed them more for the offences done in ieſt, then they do now for thoſe which are don in good earneſt.
                     Our Cicero ſayth in his booke De 
                        Cicero in lib de Legibus. 
                        Legibus, That the Romanes neuer tooke in any thing more pains, then to reſtrain the children (as well olde as the young) from idlenes. And ſo long endured the feare of their Law, and honour of their common wealth, as they ſuffered not their children like vagabonds idlely to wander the ſtreetes, For that 
                        Idlenes is the badge of all lewdnes. 
                        country may aboue all other bee counted happy, where each one enioyeth his owne labour, and no man liueth by the ſweate of another.
                     
                     I let thee know, my Pulio, that when I was a child (although I am not yet very old) none durſt bee ſo hardy to goe commonly through Rome without a token about him of the craft and occupation hee exerciſed, and wherby hee liued. And if any man had beene taken contrary, the children did not onely crie out of him in the ſtreets as of a foole; but alſo the Cenſour afterwards condemned him, to trauell with the captiues in common workes.
                     For in Rome they eſteemed it not leſſe ſhame to the child which was idle, then they did in Greece to the Philoſopher which was ignorant. And to the end thou mayeſt ſee this, I write vnto thee to be no new thing, thou oughteſt to know, that the Emperour cauſed to bee borne afore him a burning brand, and the Councel an Axe of Armes, the Prieſts a Hatte, in manner of a Coyſe: The Senatours a Cruſible on their Armes: the Iudges a little Balance, the Tribunes Maces, the Gouernours a Scepter, the Biſhoppes Hattes of flowers: the Oratours a Booke, the Cutlers a Sword, the Goldſmith a pot to melt gold: and ſo forth of all other offices, ſtrangers excepted, which went al marked after one ſort in Rome: For they would not agree, that a ſtranger ſhould be apparrelled and marked according to the children of Rome.
                     O my friend Pulio, it was ſuch a ioy then to behold the Diſcipline and proſperity of Rome, as it is now at this preſent ſuch a griefe to ſee the calamitie thereof, that by the immortall Gods I ſweare to thee, and ſo the God Mars guide my hand in Wars, that the man which now is beſt ordered, is not worth ſo much as the moſt diſſolute perſon was then. For then (amongſt a thouſand) they could not find one man vicious in Rome, and now amongſt twenty thouſand they cannot find one vertuous in all Italy.
                     
                     I know not why the Gods are ſo The golden and copper dayes of Rome. cruell againſt me, and fortune ſo contrary, that this forty yeares I haue done nothing but weepe and lament, to ſee the good men dye, and immediately to be forgotten: and on

the other ſide, to ſee wicked men liue, and to be alwayes in proſperity. Vniuerſally, the noble heart may endure all the troubles of mans life, vnleſſe it bee to ſee a good man decay, and the wicked to proſper; which my heart cannot abide, nor yet my tongue diſſemble. And touching this matter, my friend Pulio, I will write vnto thee one thing which I found in the booke of the high Capitoll, where hee treateth of the time of Marius and Silla, which truely is worthy of memory, and that is this.
                     There was at Rome a cuſtome, and a law inuiolable, ſith the time of Cinna, 
                        A famous Viſitation vſed by the ancient Romanes. that a Cenſour (expreſly commā
                        ded by the Senate) ſhould goe, and viſite the Prouinces which were ſubiect vnto it throughout all Italy, and the cauſe of thoſe viſitations was for three things. The firſt, to ſee if any complained of Iuſtice. The ſecond, to ſee in what caſe the Commonweale ſtood. The third, to the end, that yearely they ſhould render obedience to Rome. O my friend, Pulio, how thinkeſt thou? If they viſited Italie at this preſent, as at that time they ſuruaied Rome, how ful of errours ſhould they finde it? And what decay ſhould they ſee therin, thinkeſt thou? Truely, as thou knoweſt, they ſhould ſee the common wealth deſtroyed, Iuſtice not miniſtred, and moreouer Rome not obeyed, and not without iuſt cauſe. For, of right ought that common-wealth to be deſtroyed, which once of all other hath beene the flower, and moſt beautified with vertues, and after becommeth moſt abhominable, and defiled with vices.
                     
                     The caſe was ſuch that two years after the wars of Silla and Marius, the Cenſour went yeerly to Nola (which is a place in the Prouince of Campania) 
                        A towne in the middeſt of Campania. to viſite the ſame Country as the cuſtome was. And in thoſe dayes, the time and ſeaſon being very hote, and the Prouince quiet, not diſturbed with warres, and perceyuing that none of the people came to him. The Cenſour ſaid to the Hoſt which lodged him: Friend, I am a Iudge ſent from the Senatours of Rome to viſite this land. Therefore goe thy wayes quickly, and call the good men hither which be among the people: for I haue to ſay vnto them from the ſacred Senate. This Hoſt, (who peraduenture was wiſer then the Romane Iudge, although not ſo rich) goeth to the graues of the dead, which in that place were buried, and The folly of a Romane Cenſour. ſpake vnto them with a loude voyce ſaying, O yee good men, come away with mee quickly, for the Romane Cenſour calleth you.
                     
                     The Iudge perceyuing they came not, ſent him againe to call them: and the Hoſt as he did at the firſt time, ſo did he now at the ſecond. For when he was at the graues, with a loud voice he ſayd, O yee good men, come hither, for the cenſour of Rome would talke with you. And likewiſe they were called the third time with the ſelfe ſame words. And the Cenſour ſeeing no body come, was maruellous angry, and ſayde to the Hoſt: Sith theſe good men diſdain to come at my commandement, and ſhew their allegiance to the ſacred Senate of Rome

that were aliue, and not thoſe that are dead: the Hoſt made anſwere, O thou Romane Iudge, if thou wert wiſe, thou wouldeſt not maruell at that that I haue done. For I let thee vnderſtand, 
                        The wiſedome of a poore Hoſt of Nolo. 
                        in this our City of Nola, all the good men, (all I ſay) are now dead, and lye here buried in theſe graues. Therefore thou haſt no cauſe to maruell) nor yet to bee diſpleaſed with my aunſwere: but I rather ought to bee offended with thy demaund, willing me to enquire for good men, and thou thy ſelfe doſt offend with the euill dayly, Wherefore I let thee know (if thou bee ignorant thereof) if thou wilt ſpeake with any good man, thou ſhalt not finde him in all the whole world, vnleſſe the dead bee reuiued, or except the Goas will make a new creation. The Conſull Silla was fiue moneths our Captaine in this our City of Nola in Campania, ſowing the fruit which ye other Romaines gathered, that is to ſay, he left children without Fathers, Fathers without children, daughters without Mothers, and Husbands without Wiues, Wiues without Husbands, Vncles without Nephewes, Subiects without Lords, Lords without Tenants, Gods without Temples, Temples without Prieſtes, Mountaines without Heards, and fieldes without fruites. And the worſt of all is, that this wicked and curſed Silla diſpeopled this our City of good and vertuous men, and repleniſhed it with wicked and vitious perſons. Ruine and decay neuer deſtroyed the Walles ſo much, neyther the Mothes euer ſo many garments, nor the Worme rotted ſo much fruit, nor yet the Hayle beate downe ſo much corne; as the diſorder and vices of Sylla the Romane Conſull did harme, which hee brought vnto this land of Campania. And although the miſchiefe and euils that hee did heere to the men were manifold great, yet much greater herein was that which he did to their Cuſtomes and Manners.
                     
                     
                        For in the end the good men which hee beheaded, are now at reſt with the dead: but the vices which hee left vs in this Land, there are none but proude and arrogant men that delight to commaund.
                     
                     
                        In this land there are none other but enuious men, that know nought elſe but malice. In this land there are idle men, which doe nothing but looſe their time. In this land there are none but gluttons, which doe nothing but eate. In this land there are none but theeues, which entend nought elſe but robberies. In this land there are none but rebels, that do nothing but ſtirre ſedition. And if thou and all the Romanes eſteeme theſe men for good, tarry a while, I will goe to call them all to thee. For if wee ſhould kill and put into the ſhambles all the euill men, and weigh them as wee doe the fleſh of ſheepe, or other like be aſts: all the neighbours and Inhabitants of Italy ſhould haue meate ſufficient for to eate.
                     
                     
                        Behold Cenſour, in this land of Campania, they call none good but thoſe which are quiet, ſober, wiſe, and diſcreet men. They call none good but the patient, honeſt, and vertuous men. Finally I ſay, that wee call none good, but theſe men which will doe no harme, and will occupie themſelues in good workes. Without teares I ſpeake not that which I will ſay, that is, if wee ſeeke for any of them, wee ſhall find none but in their graues. For the iuſt iudgement of God it was, they ſhould repoſe themſelues in the entrailes of the earth, whom the publike weale deſerued not to haue aliue.
                     
                     
                        Thou commeſt to viſite this land, where thou ſhalt immediately be ſerued with the wicked, and to hide their faults, their deſolute life, and their vices, thou ſhalt not be a little ſolicited. Beleeue mee, if thou wilt not vndoe thy ſelfe, and be deceyued. Truſt thou rather theſe rotten bones, then their deceitfull hearts.
                        
                        For in the end, the examples of the dead that were good, doe profite men more to liue well, then the counſell of the liuing that bee wicked, doe interre and bury all thoſe that be now liuing.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. III. Marcus Aurelius concludeth the letter, and declareth at large the ſciences he learned, and all the Maſters which he had. And in the end, hee reciteth fiue not able things, in the obſeruance of which the Romanes were very curious.
                     
                     
                        I Haue recited theſe things vnto thee, my friend Pulio, to The harme enſuing by euill education of children. the end thou ſhouldeſt know, what an infinit number there is of the wicked ſort in the world, and how ſmall &amp; ſcant a number there is in Italy of the good; and this proceedeth of none other thing, but becauſe the Fathers doe not bring vp their children as our Anceſters did. It is vnpoſſible a yong child ſhould be vicious, if with due correction he had been inſtructed in vertues. Annius Verus my Father, in this caſe deſerueth as much prayſe, as I doe reproach. For whiles I was young, he neuer ſuffered me to ſleepe in bed, to ſit in chayre, to eate with him at his Table; neyther durſt I lift vp mine eies to looke him in the face. And oftentimes he ſayde vnto mee; Marcus, my ſonne, I had rather thou ſhouldeſt bee an honeſt Romane, then a diſſolute Philoſopher. Thou deſireſt mee to write vnto thee, how many Maſters I had, and what ſciences I learned in my youth. Know thou, that I had many good Maſters, though I am become an euill Scholler. I learned alſo diuers ſciences, though preſently I know little; not for that I forgot them, but becauſe the affaires of the Empire of Rome, excluded mee from them, and cauſed me to forſake them. For it is a general rule; That Science in that place is neuer permanent, where the perſon is not at liberty.
                     
                     I ſtudyed Grammer with a Maſter called Euphermon, who ſayde he was a Spaniard borne, and his head was hoare for age. In ſpeech he was very temperate, in correction ſomewhat ſeuere, and in life exceeding honeſt. For there was a law in Rome, that the childrens Maſters ſhould bee very old: So that if the Diſciple were ten yeares of age, the Maſter ſhould bee aboue fifty. I ſtudyed a long time Rethoricke, and the Law, vnder a Greeke called Alexander, borne in Lycaonya, which was ſo excellent an Oratour, that if hee had had as A Countrey of the leſſer Aſia, neere Phrygia. great a grace in writing with his pen, as he had eloquence in ſpeaking with his tongue: truly hee had beene no leſſe renowmed among the Grecians, then Cicero was honored among the Romans. After the death of this my Maiſter (at Naples) I went to Rhodes, &amp; heard Rhetoricke again of Oroſus of Pharanton, &amp; of Pulio, which truly were men expert, and excellent in the art of Oratorie, and eſpecially in making Comedies, Tragedies, &amp; Enterludes, they were very fine, and had a goodly grace. Commodus Calcedon was my firſt Maiſter in naturall Phyloſophy. He was a graue man, and in great credite with Adrian, he tranſlated Homer out of Greeke into Latin. After this man was dead, I tooke Sextus Cheronenſis for my Maiſter, who was Nephew to Plutarch the great, which Plutarch was Traianus Maiſter. I knew this Sextus Cheronenſis at 35. yeares of age, at what time I doubt, whether there hath beene any Phyloſopher

that euer was ſo well eſteemed throughout the Romane Empire as he. I haue him here vvith me, and although hee be foureſcore years old, yet continually he vvriteth the Hiſtories and geſts done of my time.
                     I let thee know my friend Pulio, that I ſtudyed the law two yeers, and the ſeeking of the lawes of many nations, was occaſion that I knew many Antiquities: and in this ſcience Volucius Mecianus vvas my maſter, a man vvhich could reade it vvell, and alſo diſpute of it better. So that on a time hee demaunded of me merily, and ſaid. Tel mee Marke, doeſt thou Conference betwixt Marcus and his Maſter. thinke there is any Law in the World that I knovv not? and I anſwered him; Tell mee Maſter, is there any Lavv in the World that thou obſerueſt.
                     The ſift yeere that I vvas at Rhodes there came a marnellous peſtilence, vvhich vvas the occaſion of the diſſolution of our Schoole, vvhich vvas in a narrovv and little place, and being there a certaine Painter, painting a rich and excellent Worke for the realme of Paleſtine, I then (for a truth) learned there to dravv and paint, and my Maſter vvas named Diogenetus, vvho in thoſe dayes vvas a famous Painter. He painted in Rome ſixe worthie Princes in one Table, and 6. other tirannous Emperours in an other. And amongſt thoſe euill, Nero the cruel was painted ſo liuely that he ſeemed aliue to all thoſe that ſavv him, and that Table vvherein Nero vvas ſo liuely dravvne, vvas by decrees of the ſacred Senate commanded to be burnt. For they ſayde, That a man of ſo wicked a life deſerued not to be repreſented in ſo goodly a Table. Others ſayde, that it was ſo naturall and perfect, that hee made all men afrayde that beheld him, and if he had been left there a few dayes, that hee would haue ſpoken as if he had been aliue. I ſtudyed the art of Necromancy a while, with all the kindes of Gyromancy and Chiromancie. In this ſcience I had no particular Maſter, but that ſometimes I went to heare Apolonius Lecture. After I was married to Fauſtine, I learned Coſmography in the City of Argelata, which is the chiefeſt towne of Illyrta, and my Maſters were Iunius Ruſticus, and Cyna Catudus, Chroniclers &amp; Councellours to Adrian my Maſter, and Antoninus my Father in Law. And becauſed I would not be ignorant in any of theſe things, that mans abilitie might attaine to, being at the wars of Dalia, I gaue my ſelfe to Muſicke, and was apt to take it, and my Maſter was named Geminus Comodus, a man of a quicke hand to play, and of as pleaſāt a voice to ſing, as euer I heard Romane tongue prompt to ſpeake.
                     This was the order of my life, and the time that I ſpent in learning. And (of good reaſon) a man ſo occupied cannot chuſe but bee vertuous. But I ſweare and confeſſe to thee, that I did not ſo much giue my ſelfe to ſtudie, but that euery day I loſt time enough. For Youth and the tender fleſh deſireth liberty, and although a man accuſtome it with trauels, yet he findeth vacant time in it alſo for his pleaſures. Although all the ancient Romaines were (in diuers things) very ſtudious; yet notwithſtanding, amongſt all ouer, and beſides theſe, there were fiue things whereunto they had euer a great reſpect: and to thoſe that therein offended, neyther requeſts auayled, rewards profited, nor law (olde nor new) diſpenſed, Truly their good wils are to be commended, and their diligence to bee exalted. For the Princes that gouern great Realms ought to employ their harts to make good lawes, and to occupie their eyes to ſee them duely excuted throughout the commonwealth.

Theſe fiue 
                           •
                        eings were theſe.
                     1 The firſt, they ordayned, that Fiue eſpecial reſpects among the Romanes. the Prieſts ſhould not be diſhoneſt. For in that Realme where Prieſts are diſhoneſt, it is a token that the Gods againſt the people are angry.
                     2 The ſecond, it was not ſuffered in Rome, that the Virgines Veſtals ſhould at their pleaſure ſtay abroad. For it is but reaſon, that ſhee which of her owne free will hath heretofore promiſed openly to bee good, ſhould now (if ſhee change her mind) be compelled in ſecret to bee chaſt.
                     3 The third, they decreede that the Iudges ſhould bee iuſt and vpright. For there is nothing that decayeth a common wealth more then a Iudge who hath not for all men one ballance indifferent.
                     4 The fourth was, that the Captaines that ſhould goe to the warres, ſhould not bee Cowards: for there is no like daunger to the Commonwealth, nor no like ſlaunder to the Prince, as to commit the charge of men to him in the Field, who will be firſt to commaund, and laſt to fight.
                     The fifth was, that they which had charge of bringing vp of children, ſhould not be vicious. For there is nothing more monſtrous and more ſlanderous, then he that is a Maſter of children, ſhould bee ſubiect and ſeruant to vices.
                     How thinkeſt thou, my friend Pulio, when all theſe things were obſerued in Rome: Thinkeſt thou that the youth was ſo diſſolute, as at this preſent? Thinkeſt thou indeed, that it is the ſame Rome, wherein (in times paſt) were ſo notable, good and auncient men? Beleeueſt thou that it is that Rome, wherein (in the golden age) the old men were ſo honeſt, and the children ſo wel taught, the Armies well ordered, and the Iudges and Senatours ſo vpright and iuſt? I call God to witneſſe, and ſweare to thee, that it is not Rome, neyther hath it any likeneſſe of Rome, nor yet any grace to be Rome, and hee that would ſay that this Rome was the olde Rome, knoweth little of Rome. The matter was this, that the auncient and vertuous Where the Gods are diſpleaſed, all goodnes decayeth. Romans being dead, it ſeemeth to the Gods, that we are not yet worthy to enioy their houſes. So that eyther this is not Rome, or elſe we bee not the Romanes of Rome. For conſidering the proweſſe and vertuous deedes of the auncient Romanes, and weighing alſo our diſſolute liues, it were a very great infamy for them to call vs their Succeſſors. I deſired my friend Pulio, to write vnto thee al theſe things, to the end thou mayeſt ſee what we were, and what wee are. For great things haue need of great power, and require a long time before they can grow, and come to their perfection, and then afterward at one moment, and with one blow, they fall down to the ground.
                     
                     I haue beene more tedious in my letter then I thought to haue beene, and now I haue tolde thee that, which with diligence (by reaſon of my great affaires) in three or foure times, I haue written of that that wanteth in thine, and is too much in mine. We ſhall make a reaſodable letter, and ſince I pardon thee for being too briefe, pardon thou mee alſo for being too long. I ſaw thee once enquire for Vnicornes horne in Alexandry, wherefore now I ſend thee a good peece, and likewiſe I ſend thee a horſe which in my iudgement is good. Aduertiſe mee if thy daughter Druſilla bee aliue, with whom I was wont to laugh, and I will helpe her to a marriage. The immortall Gods keepe mee, O my Pulio, thy wife, thy ſtepmother, and thy daughter, and ſalute them all from me, and Fauſtine.
                        
                        Marke of Mount Celio, Emperour of Rome, with his owne hand writeth vnto thee.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. IIII. Of the excellency of Chriſtian religion, which manifeſteth the true God, and diſproueth the vanity of the Ancients hauing ſo many Gods. And that in the olde time, when the enemies were reconciled in their houſes, they cauſed alſo, that the Gods ſhould embrace each other in the Temples.
                     
                     
                        HE that is the onely diuine Word begotten of the Father, Lord perpetuall of the Hierarchies, more auncient A moſt diuine and Chriſtian Confeſſion. then the Heauens, Prince of all Holineſſe, chiefe head from whom all had their beginning, the greateſt of all Gods, and Creator of all creatures, in the profoundneſſe of his eternall ſapience, accordeth all the Harmony and compoſition of Chriſtian Religion. This is ſuch a manner of ſure matter, and ſo well layed, that neyther the miſeries, which ſpring of the infections of naughtie Chriſtians can trouble, nor yet the boiſterous windes of the Heretiques are able to moue. For it were more likely that Heauen and Earth ſhould both periſh, then it ſhould ſuſpend for one day, &amp; that there ſhould be no Chriſtian Religion. The ancient Gods which were inuentors of worldly things, as the foundation of their reproued ſects was but a flying ſand, and an vnſtable ground, full of daungerous and erroneous abuſes, ſo ſome of thoſe poore wretches, looking perhaps like a ſhip running vpon a rocke, ſuſpecting nothing, were drowned, Other like ruined buildings were ſhaken in ſunder, and ſell down dead, Finally, theſe Gods which only bare the name of Gods, ſhall be for euermore forgotten. But hee onely ſhall bee perpetuall, which in God by God, and through God hath his beginning.
                     Many and ſundry were the multitude of the Nations which haue been in times paſt. That is to wit, the Sirians, the Aſſyrians, Perſians, Medians, Macedonians, Grecians, Cythians, Arginians, 
                        Diuerſity of Nations. 
                        Corinthians, Caldeans, Indians, Athenians, Lacedemonians, Africans, Vandales Sweuians, Allaines, Hungarians, Germaignes, Britons, Hebrews, Paleſtines, Gentiles, Iberthalides, Maurians, Lucitanians, Gothes and Spaniards. And truly, in al theſe looke how great the difference amongſt them in their cuſtomes and manners was, ſo much diuerſity was of the Ceremonies which they vſed, &amp; their Gods which they honoured. For the Gentiles had this errour, that they ſayd, one alone was not of power ſufficient to create ſuch a multitude as were created. If I were before all the Sages that euer were, they would not ſay the contrary, but without compariſon the gods whom they worſhipped and inuented were greater in multitude then the Realmes and Prouinces which they conquered and poſſeſſed. For by that folly the auncient Poets durſt affirme in their writings, that the Gods of one Nation and Country were mortall enemies vnto the Gods of another Prouince. So that the Gods of Troy enuied the Gods of Greece more then the Prince of Greece enuied the Prince of Troy.
                     
                     What a ſtrange thing was it to ſee the Aſſyrians in what reuerence they worſhipped the God Belus. The Egyptians the God Apis. The Caldeans the God Aſſas The Babilonians the deuouring Dragon.

The Pharaones the ſtatue of gold. The Paleſtines Belzebub. The Romans honoured the God Iupiter. The Affricans the God Mars The Corinthians the God Apollo. The Arabians God Aſtaroth. The Arginians the Sun. Thoſe of Acaia the Moone. The Cidonians Belphegorn. The Amonites Balim. The Indians Baccus. The Lacedemonians, Oſiges. The Macedonians did ſacrifice to Mercurie. The Epheſians to their goddeſſe Diana. The Greekes to Iuno. The Armenians to Liber. The Troians to Veſta. The Latines to Februa. The Tarentines to Ceres. The Rhodians, (as ſayth Apolonius Thianeus) worſhipped the God Ianus, and aboue all things, wee ought to maruell at this, That they ſtriued oftentimes amongſt themſelues, not ſo much vpon the poſſeſſions and ſeignories of Realmes, as vpon a certaine obſtinacie they had to maintaine the Gods of the one, to bee of greater power then the others: for they thought if their gods were not eſteemed, that the people ſhould be empoueriſhed, vnfortunate, and perſecuted.
                     
                        Pulio in his ſecond booke De diſſolatione regionum Orientarum, declareth that the firſt Prouince that rebelled againſt the Emperour Helius Adrianus (which was the fifteenth Emperour of Rome) was the land of Paleſtine, againſt which, was ſent a Captaine, named Iulius Seuerus, a man of great courage, and very fortunate, and aduenturous in Armes. This Captaine did not onely finiſh the warres, but hee wrought ſuch an outragious deſtruction in that land, that he beſieged 52. Cities, and razed them to the ground, and burned 680. Villages, and ſlew ſo many in battell skirmiſh, and by Iuſtice, that amounted to the number of 5000. perſons. For vnto the proud and cruell Captaines victory can neuer bee glorious, vnleſſe they water the ground with the bloud of their enemies.
                     And furthermore, in the Cities and Townes beſieged, the children, olde men and women, which dyed through hunger and peſtilence, were more in number, then thoſe which were ſlaine in the wars. For in wars the ſword of the enemies lighteth not vpon all, but peſtilence, and famine, hath no reſpect to any.
                     After this warre of the Paleſtines was ended, immediately after aroſe a more crueller betwixt the Alleynes, and Armenians. For there are many The occaſion of the warres betweene the Alleines

                            Armenians. that ſee the beginning of the troubles and miſeries which ariſe in Realmes; but there are few that conſider the end, and ſeeke to remedie the ſame. The occaſion of this warre was, as they came to the feaſt of the Mount Olimpus, they fell in diſputations, whether of their Gods were better, and which of them ought to bee preferred before other. Whereof there ſprang ſuch contradictions, and ſuch mortall hatred, that on euery part they were furiouſly moued to warres, and ſo vnder a colour to maintaine the gods which they honoured, both the common wealthes were brought into great pouerty, and the people alſo into great miſery.
                     The Emperour Helius Adrianus, ſeeing ſuch cruell warres to ariſe vpon ſo light occaſion, ſent thither the Captaine aboue named, Iulius Seuerus, to pacifie the Allaines and Armenians, and commaunded him that he ſhould perſecute thoſe with warres, which would not be ruled by his arbitremēt &amp; ſentence. For thoſe iuſtly deſerue the ſword, which with no reaſonable conditions will condiſcend vnto peace. But Iulius Seuerus vſed ſuch policy that he made thē good friends, and neuer touched them, nor came neare them. Which

thing was no leſſe acceptable to the Emperour, then profitable to the Realmes. For the Captaine which ſubdueth the Country by entreatie, deſerueth more honor then he which ouercommeth it by battell. The agreement of the peace was made vpon ſuch condition, that the Allaines ſhould take for their Gods the Armenian Gods, and the Armenians on the contrary, the Gods of the Allaines. And further, when the people ſhould embrace and reconcile themſelues to the Senate, that then the Gods ſhould kiſſe the one the other, and to be reconciled to the temple. The vanity of the Ancients was ſuch, and the blindneſſe of mortall men ſo great, &amp; ſo ſubiect were they to diueliſh deuiſes, that as eaſily as the eternall wiſedome createth a true man now a dayes: ſo eaſily then a vain man might haue inuented a falſe God. For the Lacedemonians had this opinion, that men had no leſſe power to inuent gods, then the gods had to create men.

                           PHaraſmaco in his 20 booke De libertate Deorum (whereof Cicero maketh mē
                        tion Cicero de natura Deorum. in his booke, De natura Deorum) ſayth, that when the Gothes tooke Rome, and beſieged the high Capitoll: there came amongſt them a Philoſopher called Bruxellus, the which (after the Gothes were repulſed out of Italy) remained with Camillus at Rome. And becauſe at that time Rome wanted Philoſophers, this Bruxellus was had in great veneration amongſt all the Romanes, ſo that hee was the firſt ſtranger of whom (being aliue) a ſtatue was euer made in the Senate: the Romanes vſed to make a ſtatue of the Romanes being aliue, but not to ſtrangers till after their death, The age of this Bruxellus was 113. whereof 65. hee had been an inhabitant of Rome. And among other things they recite 7. notable things of his life.
                     1 The firſt, that in 60. yeeres, no mā euer ſaw him iſſue out of the wals of Rome. For in the olde time the Sages were little eſteemed, if in their behauiours they were not iuſt and vpright.
                     2 The ſecond, that in 60. yeares no man heard him ſpeake an idle

                     3 The third, that in all his time they neuer ſaw him loſe one houre of time. For in a wiſe man there is no greater folly, then to ſee him ſpend a moment of an houre idely.
                     
                     4 The fourth, that in all his time, hee was neuer detected of any vice. And let no man thinke this to bee a ſmall matter. For few are they of ſo long life, which are not noted of ſome infamy after their death.
                     
                     The fifth, that in all the 60. years he neuer made quarrell, nor ſtriued with any man; and this thing ought to be no leſſe eſteemed then the other. For truly hee that liueth a long time without offering wrong to another, may be called a monſter in nature.
                     
                     6 The ſixt, that in 3. or 4. yeares hee neuer iſſued out of the temple, and in this caſe this philoſopher ſhewed him ſelfe to be a good man. For the vertuous man ought not to content himſelfe only to be void of vices: but he ought alſo to withdraw himſelfe from the vicious.
                     
                     
                        
7 The ſeuenth and laſt, that hee ſpake more often with the Gods then with men.
                     This Philoſopher now drawing neere to the houre of death, all the graue Senators came to viſite him, &amp; to thanke him for that he had liued ſo long amongſt them in ſo good conuerſation, and that ſo willingly hee cared and watched for the wealth of Rome. And likewiſe all the people of Rome were right ſorry for his ſickneſſe, and that they ſhould looſe the company of ſo excellent and vertuous a man. The good Philoſopher in the preſence of them al ſpake theſe words vnto the Senate.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VI. Of that the ſage Philoſopher Bruxellus ſpake to the Senate of Rome, at the houre of his death.
                     
                     
                        
                           SInce you are wiſe (O worthy Senatours) 
                        The ſpeech of Bruxellus at his death. 
                        mee thinketh you ſhould not lament my death, ſithens I my ſelfe ſo ioyfully doe receiue it. For wee ought not to lament the death weo take, but the wicked life wee leade. The man is very ſimple that dreadeth death, for feare to loſe the pleaſures of life. For death ought not to bee feared for loſſe of life, but becauſe it is a ſharpe ſcourge of the wicked life. I dye (noble Senatours) in ioy and pleaſure. Firſt, becauſe I doe not remember that euer I did any euill in all my life, or diſpleaſure to any of the Common-wealth. And I am certaine that the man which did no euill to men in his life, the Gods will doe him no harme at the houre of his death. Secondarily, I dye ioyfully, to ſee all Rome lament the loſſe of my life. For that man is very wicked and vnhappy whoſe life the people lament, and at whoſe death they doe reioyce. Thirdly, I dye ioyfully, onely to remember that the threeſcore yeers which I haue beene in Rome, alwayes I haue trauelled for the common wealth. For the iuſt Gods told mee, that there is no death with paine, but where life is without profite. Fourthly, I dye ioyfully, not ſo much for the profit I haue done to men, as for the ſeruice I haue done to the Gods. For regarding to how many profitable things we employ our life, we may ſay, wee liue onely the time which is employed to the ſeruice of God.
                     
                     
                        Ceaſing to ſpeake further of my perſon, I will (worthy Senatours) diſcloſe vnto you a highſecret which toucheth your Common wealth, and this it is. That our Father Romulus founded Rome, Numa Pompilius erected the high Capitoll, Aeneus Marcius encloſed it with wals, Brutus deliuered it from Tyrants, the good Camillus droue out the Frenchmē, Quintus Scicinnatus augmented her power: but I leaue it peopled with gods, which ſhall defend Rome better then walles or men. For in the end, the feare of one god is more worth the the ſtrength of all men. When I came to Rome it was a confuſion to ſee how it was peopled with men, and vnfurniſhed of Gods. For there was but fiue Gods, that is to ſay, Iupiter, Mars, Ianus, Berecinthia, and the Goddes Veſta. But now it is not ſo. For there remaineth for euery one a priuate god. Me thinketh it an vniuſt thing that Treaſuries ſhould bee full of gold, and the Temples voide of Gods. As there is 28000. houſholds, ſo you may account your ſelues happy, that I leaue you 28000 Gods: by the vertue of the which I coniure you O Romanes, that each of you bee contented with the God of his houſe, and haue no care to apply to himſelfe the Gods of the Common wealth. For he that emproprieth to himſelfe that which ought to be cō
                           mon to al, is to be blamed of God, &amp; hated of men.
                        
                        This ſhall bee therefore the order that you ſhall keepe and haue towards the Gods, if you wil not erre in their ſeruice. That is to vnderſtand, that yee ſhall keepe the mother Berecinthia, to pacifie the ire of the Gods: yee ſhall keepe the Goddeſſe Veſta, to turne from you the wicked deſtinies. Yee ſhall keepe the God Iupiter, and ſhall commit vnto him the gouernment of your Commonwealth. And alſo yee ſhall keepe him for the God aboue all gods in heauen and earth. For if Iupiter did not temper the ire, which the Gods about haue againſt you: there ſhould bee no memory of men heere beneath in earth. Of other particular gods which I leaue you, vſe your particular profite. But yet notwithſtanding in the meane ſeaſon (Romanes) take you heede to your ſelues, and if at any time fortune ſhould hee contrary, let no man be ſo hardy to ſpeake euill of the God which hee hath in his houſe. For the Gods tell mee, that it was ſufficient enough to diſſemble with them which ſerue them not, and not to pardon thoſe that offend them. And doe not deceiue your ſelues in ſaying that they are priuate Gods, and not able to help themſelues. For I let you know, that there is not ſo little a God, but is of power ſufficient to reuenge aniniury. O Romanes, it is reaſon, that all from henceforth liue ioyfully, and in peace, and furthermore, thinke your ſelues aſſured not to he ouercome by your enemies, becauſe now your neighbours of you, and not you of them, ſhall deſire to borrow Gods, and becauſe yee ſhall ſee mee no more, yee thinke I muſt dye, and I thinke becauſe I dye, I ſhall beginne to liue. For I goe to the Gods, and leaue among you the Gods, becauſe I depart.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VII. How the Gentiles thought that one God was not able to defend them from their enemies, and how the Romanes ſent throughout all the Empire to borrow Gods when they fought againſt the Gothes.
                     
                        IN the yeere of the foundatiō of Rome Paul. Oroſ De Mach. Mund. lib. 6 1164. which according to the count of the Latines, was 402. from the incarnation (as Paulus Oroſus in the ſixt booke, De machina mundi ſayth, and Paulus Diaconus in the 12. booke of the Romane Hiſtories,) The Gothes (which as Spartian ſayeth, were called otherwiſe Gethules, or Meſſagethes) were driuen out of their Country by the Huns, and came into Italy to ſeeke new habitations, and became naturall and built houſes.
                     At this time there was an Emperour of Rome named Valentine, a man of ſmall reputation and courage in warres, and endued with few good conditions, for that hee was of Arian his ſect. The Kings of theſe Gothes were two renowmed men, whoſe names were Randagagiſmus and Alaricus. Of the which two, Randagagiſmus was the chiefeſt and moſt puiſſant, and he had a noble minde, and a very good wit. He led with him at the leaſt 2000000. Gothes, the which all with him, and he with them made an oath, to ſhedde as much bloud of the Romanes as they could, and offer it to their Gods. For the barbarous people had a cuſtom, to noint the God (which was at that time in the Temple of Venus) with the bloud of their enemies, whom they had ſlain

The newes of the comming of this cruel Tyrant was publiſhed throughout all Italy.
                     
                     Whoſe determination was not onely to raze the wals of Rome downe to the earth, batter towers, dungeons, houſes, walles, and buildings: but alſo he purpoſed to aboliſh, and vtterly to bring to nought the name of Rome, and likewiſe of the Romanes.
                     Of this thing all the Italians were in very great and maruellous feare and the moſt puiſſant and couragious Knights and Gentlemen, agreede together preſently to retire within the Walles of Rome, and determined to dye in the place to defend the liberty thereof. Fot amongſt the Romanes there was an ancient cuſtome, that when they created a Knight, An ancient cuſtome among the Romanes: they made him to ſweare to keepe 3. things.
                     1 Firſt, he ſware to ſpend all the dayes of his life in the wars.
                     2 Secondarily, hee ſware that neyther for pouerty nor riches, nor for any other things, hee ſhould euer take wages but of Rome onely.
                     3 Thirdly, hee ſware, that hee would rather chuſe to dye in liberty, then to liue in captiuity.
                     After all the Romanes (ſcattered abroad in Italy) were together aſſembled in Rome, they agreede to ſend letters by their Purſeuants, not onely to their Subiects, but alſo to all their confederates. The effect whereof was this.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VIII. Of a Letter ſent from the Senate of Rome to all the Subiects of the Empire.
                     
                     
                        THe ſacred Senate, and all the people of Rome, to all their faithfull and louing Subiects, and to their deare friends and confederates, wiſheth health and victory againſt your enemies. The variety of time, the negligence of you all, and the vnhappy ſucceſſe of our aduentures. haue brought vs in proceſſe of time, that wheras Rome conquered realms, and gouerned ſo many ſtrange Seignories, now at this day commeth ſtrangers to conquere and deſtroy Rome; in ſuch ſort, that the barbarous people (whom we were wont to keepe for ſlaues) ſweare to become our Lords and Maſters. Wee let you know now, how all the barbarous nations haue conſpired againſt Rome our mother, and they with their King haue made a vow, to offer all the Romanes bloud to their Gods in the Temples. And peraduenture their pride and fierceneſſe beeing ſeene, &amp; our innocency knowne, Fortune will diſpoſe another thing. For it is a geuerous rule, That it is vnpoſſible for a 
                        A rule deſeruing obſeruation. 
                        Prince to haue the victory of that warre which by malice is begunne, and by pride and fierceneſſe purſued. It hath ſeemed good vnto vs (ſince their cauſe is vniuſt, and ours righteous) to endeuour our ſelues by all meanes how to reſiſt this barbarous people. For oft times that which by iuſtice was gotten, by negligence is lost. For the remedy of this miſchiefe to come the ſacred Senate hath prouided theſe things following, and for the

accompliſhing thereof your fauour, and aide is neceſſary.
                     1 Firſt of all, wee haue determined to repayre with all diligence our ditches, walles, gates, and bulwarkes, Conſiderations reſolued on b
                              •
                            the Romans for their owne good, and in theſe places to arme all our friends. But to accompliſh that, and diuers other for the neceſſity of warfare, we lacke money; for yee know well inough, That the warre cannot bee proſperous where enemies abound, and money is ſcarce.
                     
                     2 Secondarily, wee haue commaunded, that all thoſe which bee ſworne Knights and souldiers of Rome, repayre immediately to Rome, and therefore yee ſhall ſend vs all thoſe which are vnder the age of 50. and aboue the age of 20. For in great warres auncient men giue counſell, and young men and luſty to execute the ſame are required.
                     
                     3 We haue agreede and concluded, that the City bee prouided of victuals, munition, and defence at the leaſt for two yeares. Wherefore we deſire yee, that yee ſend vs from you the tenth part of wine, the fift part of fleſh, &amp; the third part of your bread: For we haue all ſworne to die, yet we meane not to dye for famine, aſſieged as fearefull men: but fighting in plain field, like valiant Romanes.
                     4 Fourthly, wee haue prouided, (ſince the vnknowne barbarous come to fight with vs) that you bring vs to Rome ſtrange Gods to helpe and defend vs. For you know well inough, that ſince great Conſtantine, we haue been ſo poore of Gods, that we haue not but one God, whom the Chriſtians do honour. Therefore we deſire you, that you wil ſuccor vs with your Gods in this our extreame neceſſity: For amongſt the Gods wee know no one alone ſufficient, to defend all the Romane people from their enemies. The wals therefore being well repayred, and all the young and warlike men in Garriſon in the City, the batteries well furniſhed, and the Treaſure houſe well repleniſhed with money, and aboue all, the Temples well adorned with Gods, wee hope in our Gods to haue the victory of our enemies. For in fighting with men, and not againſt Gods, a man ought alwayes to haue hope of victory: for there are no men of ſuch might, but by God and other me may be vanquiſhed. Fare ye wel, &amp;c.
                     After this letter was ſent through all the dominion of the Romaines, not tarrying for anſwere of the ſame, they forthwith openly blaſphemed the name of Chriſt, and ſet vp idols in the Temples, vſed the ceremonies of the Gentiles, and that which was worſe then that, they ſayde openly that Rome was neuer ſo oppreſſed with Tyrants, as it hath beene ſince they were Chriſtians.
                     And further they ſayde, if they called not againe all the Gods to Rome, the City ſhould neuer bee in ſafeguard, for that they haue diſhonored and offended their Gods, and caſt them out of Rome, and that thoſe barbarous people were ſent to reuēge their iniurie. But the diuine prouidēce which giueth no place to human malice to execute his forces, before the walles were repayred, and before the meſſengers brought anſwere, and before the ſtrange Gods could enter into Rome, Randagagiſmus King of the Gothes, with 2000000. of barbarous, (without the effuſion of Chriſtian bloud) ſuddenly in the mountains of Veſulanes, with famine, thirſt, and ſtones which fell from heauen, loſt all his Armie, not one left aliue but himſelfe, who had his head ſtrucken off in Rome. And this thing the eternal wiſdome brought to paſſe, to the end the Romanes ſhould ſee, that Ieſus Chriſt the true God of the Chriſtians, had no need of ſtrange Gods to defend his ſeruants.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. IX. Of the true and liuing God, and of the maruailes wrought in the olde Law, to manifeſt his diuine power, and of the ſuperſtition of the falſe Gods.
                     
                     
                        O Groſſe ignorance, &amp; vnſpeakable obſtinacy, O iudgements of God inſcrutable. The wilfull ignorance, and peruerſity of the Gentiles. What thinke theſe Gentiles by the true God? They ſearched the falſe Gods to helpe them, and had a liuing God of their owne: they ſought Gods full of guile and deceit, and worſe then that they thought it neceſſary, that that God (which created all things) ſhould be accompanied with their gods, to defend them which could make nothing. Let now all their gods come forth into the fieldes on the one ſide, and I will goe forth alone in godly company, that is to ſay with the high God on th'other part: And we will compare the deedes and proue the aydes of their falſe God, againſt and with the laſt worke of our true God. And they ſhall cleerely perceiue their falſehood and our truth. For the tongue that ſpeaketh of God can neuer beare with any lye, and that which ſpeaketh of Idols, can neuer diſcloſe any truth. If they eſteeme him much for creation of the world with his might: is it any leſſe to preſerue and gouerne it by his wiſdome? For many things are done in a moment, for the preſeruation wherof long times is requiſite, and much painefull trauaile neceſſary. I demand further what God of the gentiles could do that which our God hath done? that is to know, within one Arke to make quiet the Lyon with the Leoperd, the Wolſe with the Lambe, the Beare with the Cow, the Of the great concorde &amp; agreement of Noahs Arke. the Tigar with the Crocodill, the ſtoned horſe with the Mare, the Dogge with the Catte, the Foxe with the Hennes, the Hounds with the Hares, and ſo of other beaſtes: whoſe enmitie is greater thone againſt thother, then that of man is againſt men. For the enmity amongſt men proceedeth of malice, but that of beaſts proceedeth of nature.
                     
                     Alſo I demaund, what God (if it were not the true God ſo mighty) could ſlay and drowne (in one houre and moment) ſo many men, women, and beaſts: ſo that all thoſe which were in the world (eight onely excepted) periſhed in the deluge of Noe. The iudgement of God by ordinance, and their offences deſerue this ſo maruellous a dammage. For God neuer executed any notable puniſhment, but firſt it came through our wicked offences. And if this be counted for a great thing, I will that an other thing bee had in great eſtimation: which is, that if God ſhewed his rigorous iuſtice in this puniſhment, incontinently hee ſhewed his might and clemency in remedying it, in that of theſe eight perſons (which were but few) the generation did multiply in ſo great a number, that they did repleniſh many and great Realmes: whereon a man ought to maruell, for according as Ariſtotle ſayth, Great things are eaſily put to 
                        The ſaying of Ariſtotle. 
                        deſtruction, and brought to nought, but with great difficultie they are remedied and repaired againe.
                     
                     And further I demaund, what god of the Gentiles was ſo puiſſant to do this, which the God of the Hebrewes did, in that ancient and opulent Realme of the Egyptians? That is to witte, when hee would, and when it pleaſed him, hee made the riuers run bloud, infected the fleſh, darkned the

ayre, dryed the ſeas, and ſlew the firſt begotten, obſcured the Sunne, and did wonders in Canaan, and other wonderfull things in the redde Sea.
                     Finally, hee commaunded the Sea to drowne the Prince aliue with all his Egyptians, and that he ſhould let the Hebrewes paſſe by. If one of theſe falſe gods had done any one of theſe things, it had beene to be maruelled at: but the true God doing it, wee ſhould not maruell at it. For, according to our little vnderſtanding, it ſeemeth a great thing, but in reſpect of that the diuine power can do it is nothing. For where God putteth 
                        Weake is the arine of man, to reſiſt againſt God. 
                        to his hand, there are no men ſo mighty no beaſts ſo proud, nor heauen ſo hie, nor ſea ſo deepe that can reſiſt his power. For as he gaue them power, ſo can hee take it from them at his pleaſure.
                     Further, what God of the Gentiles (although they were aſſembled together) could haue had the power to haue deſtroyed one man onely, as the true God did, the which The mighty Army of Senacherib ouerthrowne. (in the time of King Zedechias) made an hundred and foureſcore thouſand of the campe of the Aſſyrians die, the Hebrewes being a ſleepe which were their mortall enemies. And truly in this caſe, God ſhewed to Princes, and great Lords, how little their money and their ſubtle wits preuayle them in feates of warre, when God hath determined another thing for their deſerts. For in the end, the firſt inuention of warres proceedeth of mans ambition, and worldly malice, but the victory of them proceedeth of the diuine pleaſure. What God of the Gentiles could haue done that which our true God did? when he brought vnder the feet of the renowmed Captaine Ioſhua, two and thirty Kings and Realmes, whom he depriued not onely from their lands, but alſo bereft them of their liues, in tearing them in peeces, and diuiding The ſucces of Ioſhua ouer Kings and Kingdomes. the miſerable Realmes into twelue Tribes. Thoſe Realmes (which in old time belonged vnto the Hebrews) were more then 2000. yeeres kept of them in tyranny, wherefore God would, that by the hands of Ioſhua, they ſhould bee reſtored.
                     And though God deferred it a long time, it was to giue them grieuous torments, and not for that God had forgotten them. And although Princes doe forgette many wrongs and tyrannies, yet notwithſtanding, riuers of bloud ceaſe not to runne before the face of the deuine Iuſtice. If all the ancient Gods had had power, would not they alſo haue holpen their Princes? ſince the gods loſt no leſſe in loſing their temples, then men loſt in loſing their Realmes: for it touched more the caſe of the Auncients, to loſe one little Temple, then for men to loſe a The God of Troy could not reſiſt the Grecian. noble Realme. We ſee that the gods of the Troians could not reſiſt the Greekes, but that both men and gods, gods and men came into Carthage, &amp; from Carthage into Trinacria, and from Trinacria, into Italy, and from Italy into Laurentum, and from Laurentum into Rome. So they went about flying, declaring that the gods of Troy, were no leſſe conquered of the Gods of Greece, then the Dukes and Captaines of Greece, were vanquiſhers of the Captaines of Troy, the which thing is hard to them that preſume to be Gods: For the true God doth not onely make himſelfe feared, but alſo beloued and feared both, That we ſay of the one, that ſame we may wel ſay of the other. That is to know, that all the Gods in the Realms and Temples, wherin they honoured and ſerued: but wee ſee the one deſtroyeth the other, as it is declared by the Hebrewes, which was in bondage of the

                        Aſſyrians: the Aſſyrians of the Perſians, the Perſians of the Macedonians, the Macedonians of the Medes, the Medes of the Greekes, the Greekes of the Penians, the Penians of the Romanes, the Romanes of the Gothes, the Gothes of the Mores: So that there was no Realme nor Nation, but was conquered.
                     Neyther the Writers can deny but they would haue exalted theyr Gods and Ceremonies, that the Gods and their Worſhippers ſhould not haue end. But in the end, both Gods and men had all end, except the Chriſtian Religion, which ſhall neuer haue end. For it is founded of that which hath neither beginning nor ending. One of the things which comforteth my heart moſt in the Chriſtian Religion, is to ſee, that ſince the time the Churches were founded, the Kinges and Princes moſt puiſſant haue been alwayes their enemies, and the moſt feeble and poore, alwayes greateſt helpers, and defenders of the ſame. O glorious militant Church, which now is no other then gold amongſt The dignity of the church militant. the ruſt, a roſe amongſt the thorns, come amongſt the chaffe, mary amongſt the bones, Margarites amongeſt the peble-ſtones, a holy ſoule amongſt the rotten fleſh, a Phoenix in the Cage, a ſhippe rocking in the raging Seas, which the more ſhee is beaten, the faſter ſhee ſayleth.
                     And there is no Realme ſo little, nor no man of ſo little fauour, but when other doe perſecute him, hee is by his friends, parents, and defendors fauoured and ſuccoured, ſo that many times thoſe which thinke to deſtroy are deſtroyed, and thoſe which ſeeme to take their part, were their chiefeſt enemies. Doth not that proceede of the great ſecret of God? For though God ſuffered the wicked to be wicked a while, God will not therefore ſuffer that one euill man procure another to doe euill.
                     The Paleſtines and thoſe of Hieruſalem, had not for their principall enemies but the Chaldeans, and the Chaldeans had for their enemies the Idumeans, the Idumeans the Aſſyrians, the Aſſyrians the Perſians, the Perſians the Ariginians, the Ariginians, the Athenians, the Athenians had for their principall enemies the Lacedemonians, 
                        The enmity of nations one againſt another. and the Lacedemonians the Sydonians, the Sidonians the Rhodians, and the Rhodians the Scythians, the Scythians the Hunnes, the Hunnes had the Alaines, the Alaines the Sweuians, the Sweuians the Vandales, the Vandales the Valerians, the Valerians the Sardinians, the Sardinians the Africanes, the Africanes the Romanes, the Romans the Dacians, the Dacians the Gothes, the Gothes the Frenchmen, the Frenchmen the Spaniards, and the Spaniards the Mores.
                     
                     And of all theſe Realmes, the one hath perſecuted the other. And not all one: but our holy mother the Church hath alwayes been oppreſſed and perſecuted with thoſe realms, and hath beene ſuccoured of none, but of Ieſu Chriſt onely, and he hath euer ſuccoured and defended it well: For the things that God taketh charge of although all the world were againſt thē, in the end it is impoſſible for them to periſh.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. X. How there is but one true God, and how happy theſe Realmes are, which haue a good Chriſtian to their King, and how the Gentiles affirme, that good Princes (after their death) were changed into Gods, and the wicked into Diuels, which the Authour proueth by ſundry examples.
                     
                     
                        ALthough the common opinion of the ſimple people was, Variety of opinions concerning the true God. that there was many gods, yet notwithſtanding, al the Philoſophers affirmed, that there was but one God, (who of ſome was named Iupiter) the which was chiefe aboue all other Gods
                     Others called him the firſt intelligence, for that hee had created all the World. Others called him the firſt cauſe, becauſe hee was the beginner of all things. It ſeemeth that Ariſtotle vnderſtood this thing, and was of this opinion, foraſmuch as he ſayth in his 12. booke of his Metaphyſickes. All ſuperiour and inferiour things would bee well ordered, and many things much better by the arbitrement 
                        Ariſt. in Metaph lib. 12. Mar. Var. in lib miſt. Theol. Cic. in lib. de nat. Deorum. 
                        of one, then by the aduiſe of many. Marcus Varro in his booke, De Theologia miſtica, and Cicero in his booke De natura Deorum, although theſe were Gentiles, and curious enough of the Temples, yet they doe mocke the Gentiles, which beleeued there were many Gods, and that Mars and Mercury, and likewiſe Iupiter, and the whole flocke of Gods (which the Gentiles ſet vp) were all mortall men as we are.
                     But becauſe they knew not, that there were good &amp; bad Angells, nor knew not that there was any Paradiſe to reward the good, nor Hell to torment the euill. They held this opinion, that good men after their death were Gods, and euill men deuils. And not contented with theſe fooliſh abuſes, the Deuill brought them into ſuch an errour, that they thought it conſiſted in the Senates power to make ſome Gods, and other Deuils For when there dyed at Rome any Emperour, if he had been well affected of the Senate, immediately hee was honoured for a God: and if hee dyed in diſpleaſure of the Senate, hee was condemned for a Deuill. And to the end we doe not ſpeake by fauour, but by writing. Herodian ſaith, that Fauſtine was the daughter of Antoninus Pius, and wife of Marcus Aurelius, which were Emperours, the one after the other. And truely there were few eyther of their Predeceſſors, or of their Succeſſors, which were ſo good as they were, and in mine opinion none more better: And therefore was ſhee made a Goddeſſe, and her father a God.
                     An Emperour that coueteth perpetuall memory, muſt note 5. things Emperours made Gods or Deuils by decree of the Senate Fiue things fitting an Emperour. which he ſhould haue in his life. That is to ſay, pure in life, vpright in iuſtice, aduenturous in feates of Armes, excellent in knowledge, and welbeloued in his Prouinces: which vertues were in theſe two excellent Emperours. This Empreſſe Fauſtine was paſſing fayre; and Writers prayſe her beauty in ſuch ſort, that they ſayd it was impoſſible for her to bee ſo beautiful, but that the Gods had placed ſome diuine matter in her. Yet notwithſtanding, this added thereunto, it is doubtfull, whether the beauty of her face was more prayſed, or the diſhoneſty of her life diſcommended. For her beauty maruelouſly amaſed thoſe that ſaw her, and her diſhoneſty offended them much that knew her.

Yet after the Emperour Marcus Aurelius had triumphed ouer the Parthians, as he went viſiting the Prouinces of Aſia, that goodly Fauſtine in foure dayes dyed at the mount Taurus, (by occaſion of a burning Feuer) and ſo annealed, was caryed to Rome.
                     
                     And ſince ſhee was the daughter of ſo good a Father, and wife of ſo dearly Romaine 
                              〈…〉
                            goddeſſe. beloued an Emperour, amongſt the Goddeſſes, ſhee was canonized; but conſidering her vnconſtant, or rather incontinent life, it was neuer thought that the Romaines would haue done her ſo much honour. Wherefore the Emperour reioyced ſo much, that he neuer ceaſed to render thankes vnto the Senate. For truely, a benefit ought to be acceptable to him that receyueth it eſpecially, when it commeth vnlooked for.
                     
                     The contrarie came to the death of Tiberius, third Emperour of Rome, which was not onely killed, &amp; drawne through the ſtreetes by the Romaines, but alſo the Prieſts of all the temples aſſembled together, and openly prayed vnto the gods, that they would not receyue him to them: and prayed to the Infernall Furies, that greeuouſlie they would torment him, ſaying: It is iuſtly required, that the Tyrant which diſprayſeth the life of the good in this 
                        A worthie ſaying. 
                        Life, ſhould haue no place amongſt the good after his death.
                     
                     Leauing the common Opinion of the rude people, which in the old time had no knowledge of the true GOD, and declaring the opinion of Ariſtotle, who called God the firſt cauſe: the opinion of the Stoyckes, which called him the firſt Intelligence: and the opinion of Cicero, who vnder the colour of Iupiter, putteth none other God but him: I ſay and confeſſe (according to the religion of Chriſtian Faith) there is but one onely GOD, which is the Creatour of Heauen and Earth: whoſe excellency and puiſſant Maieſtie is little to that our tongue cā ſpeake. For our vnderſtanding can not vnderſtand, nor our iudgement can determine, neyther our memory can comprehend, and much leſſe our tongue can declare it.
                     
                     That which Princes and all other Faithful ought to belieue of GOD, is, that they ought to know God to bee Almightie, and incomparable, a God immortall, incorruptible, immoueable, great, Omnipotent, a perfect and ſempiternall GOD; For all mans power is nothing, in reſpect of his diuine Maieſtie.
                     I ſay that our LORD GOD is the onely High God, that if the creature hath any good, it is but a mean good. For a man comparing well the good which hee poſſeſſeth, to the miſerie No goodneſſe but proceedeth from God. and calamity which perſecuteth him: without doubt, the euil which followeth after is greater then the good which accompanyeth him.
                     Alſo our GOD is immortall, and eternall, which like as he had no beginning, ſo ſhall hee neuer haue ending. And the contrarie is to the miſerable man, which if ſome ſee him borne, other ſee him die. For the byrth of the children, is but a memory of the graue to the aged. And GOD only is incorruptible, the which in his Beeing hath no other corruption, nor diminution: but all mortall men ſuffer corruption in their ſoules through Vice, and in their bodies through wormes; for in the end no mā is priuiledged, but that his body is ſubiect to corruption, and his ſoule to be ſaued or damned.
                     Alſo GOD is no changeling, and in this caſe though hee changeth his worke, yet hee changeth not his Eternall counſell. But in men it is all contrarie: For they oftentimes beginne their buſines with grauitie, and afterward change their counſell at a better time, and leaue it lightly.
                     I haue now ſhewed you that God

onely is incomprehenſible, the Maieſtie of whom can not be attained, nor his Wiſedome vnderſtanded, which thing is aboue mans intelligence. For there is no man ſo ſage nor profound, but that an other in an other time is as ſage and profound as he.
                     Alſo GOD onely is Omnipotent: For that he hath power not onely ouer the liuing, but alſo ouer the dead: not only ouer the good, but alſo ouer the euil. For the man which doth not feele his mercie, to giue him glory, he will make him feele his wrath, in giuing him paine. Oh ye Princes of this world, truely it is both iuſt and neceſſarie, that you acknowledge ſubiection vnto the Prince of Heauen and Earth, which in the end although yee be great, and thinke your ſelues to be All power is in the hand of of God. much worth, although that you haue much, and can do much, yet in reſpect of that Supreame Prince, you are nothing worth, neither can you doe any thing. For there is no Prince in the world this day, but can doe leſſe then he would, &amp; would more thē he hath. Since all that wee haue ſpoken of before is true, let Princes &amp; great Lords ſee how conſonāt it is to reaſon, that ſith all the creatures were not created but by one: Why then doe they not honour ONE aboue all? For as a Prince will not ſuffer that an other be called King in his Realme, ſo likewiſe GOD will not permit that any other ſhould be honoured in this world but he onely.
                     The Father did a great benefite to vs, for to create vs without the deſire of any man: and alſo the Sonne to redeeme and buy vs without the help of any man: and aboue all the holie Ghoſt to make vs Chriſtians without the deſerts of any man. For all the good deeds and ſeruices which we are able to doe, are not ſufficient to requite the leaſt benefit that he ſhewed vnto vs. Princes ought greatly to eſteem ſuch a gift, that God hath created thē men, &amp; not beaſts: and much more they ſhould eſteeme that they are made Lords and not ſeruants: but moſt of all they ought to reioyce that God hath made them Chriſtians and not Gentils, nor Moores. For it profiteth them little to haue ſcepters and Realms to condemne, if they ſhall not acknowledge the holy Church, without the which no man may or can bee ſaued.
                     Oh diuine Bountie! how many Paynims had bin better peraduenture then I: if thou hadſt choſen them for the Church? and if thou hadſt made me a Paynime, I had bene worſe then they. Thou leaueſt them which haue ſerued thee, and haſt choſen me a ſinner which offend thee. Oh Lord God thou knoweſt what thou doeſt, and where thou art: but I know not what I doe, nor what I ſpeake. For wee are bound to prayſe the workes of God, &amp; haue not licence to call them back. Thoſe Emperours and Painim Kings which haue been good, (as there hath been manie) ſo much leſſe they haue to anſwere, for that in time of charge they were not called. And likewiſe the contrarie to the wicked Chriſtian Princes: the more goodnes they haue receyued without meaſure: ſo much the more torments ſhalbe giuē them in eternall fire. For according to the ingratitude which they haue ſhewed, for the benefites by them receyued in this world: ſo ſhall the bitterneſſe of theyr paines bee, which they ſhall receyue in Hell.
                     Princes are much bound to doe wel, becauſe they were created of God reaſonable Wherefore Princes ſhould obey God. men; but they are much more bound, becauſe they be Chriſtians, &amp; more then others boūd, becauſe they were made mightie, and placed in ſo high eſtate. For the greateſt power is not for a Prince to haue and poſſeſſe much, but to profite much. They doe

not require of a little and weake Tree much, but that hee beare his Fruit in due time. For a great and high tree, is bound to giue wood to heate them that be a colde, ſhadow to refreſh the weary trauellours, &amp; fruit to comfort the needie, &amp; alſo it ought to defend it ſelfe from all importunate windes. For the vertuous Prince ought to bee a ſhadow and reſting place, where the good may couer themſelues beeing weary.
                     The Church doth moue vs to doe many things, and our conſcience willeth vs to obſerue more. But if the Princes will promiſe me they will doe two things onely, (that is to ſay) that they wilbe faithfull in the law of God, whom they honour, and that they wil not vſe tyrannie againſt their people, whom they gouerne: From henceforth I promiſe them the glory &amp; felicity which they deſire. For that prince only dieth in ſafegard, which dieth in the loue of our SAVIOVR IESVS CHRIST, and hath liued in the loue of his neighbour.
                     Princes and great Lords which preſume to bee good Chriſtians, ſhould watche greatly that all things might be done to the Seruice of GOD, begunne in God, followed in God, and ended in God. And if they wil watch in this, I let them knowe, that as touching the Exaltation of Faith, they ſhould watch ſo much, that all ſhould know, that for the defence of the ſame they are readie to dye. For if the Prince belieue that there is paine for the euill, and rewarde for the good in an other life: it is impoſſible but that hee amend his life, and gouerne well his Common-wealth.
                     Thinke this for a ſurety, that where the Princes feares not God, neyther themſelues nor their Realms can proſper. For the Felicitie or miſerie of Realms, proceedeth not of the paines and trauells that the Kings and people doe take: but of the merits which the Kings &amp; Realms deſerue. In great perill liueth that Realm, whoſe Prince is an euill Chriſtian: Happie &amp; ſure is that cōmonwealth, wherof the Prince hath a good conſcience: For the man that is of a good conſcience, will not do any euil thing to the cōmonwelth.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XI. Of ſundry Gods which the ancients worſhipped: Of the office of thoſe Gods, how they were reuenged of them when they diſpleaſed them, and of the twentie elect Gods.
                     
                     
                        THough to men of cleare iudgement, the works of God are great of themſelues, without any compariſon to others: yet that the white may be better knowne from the blacke, I will ſatisfie ſomwhat the curious reader, in reckoning vp a flocke of falſe Gods, that by them and theyr power, men ſhall ſee how much the Princes are bound to the true God.
                     The ancient Painyms had gods of diuers ſortes: howbeit the chiefe of How much men are bound to the Almightie God. all were theſe, which they called Diis electi. They would haue ſaid gods of heauen: which gods (as they thought) ſometime deſcended from Heauen to earth. Theſe gods were xx. in number: as Ianus, Saturnus, Iupiter, Genius Mercurius, Apollo, Mars, Vulcanus, Neptunus, Sol, Orcus, Vibar, Tellus, Ceres, Iuno, Minerna, Luna, Diana, Venus, Veſta.
                     
                     Theſe viii. laſt rehearſed were goddeſſes, and xii. of the firſt were gods, No man might take any of thoſe as his owne god, but as common and indifferēt to al. Their office was to profit all. I mean al of any one Realm, one Prouince ſingular, or one noble citie.

And firſt note, they had one god, whō they called Candus, whom they honoured much, and offred vnto him manie ſacrifices, to the ende that God might giue them wiſe children. And this if they had demanded of the True GOD, they ſhould haue had reaſon. For the impoſtumation of humane malice, is ſwelled in ſuch wiſe, that that man is in great jeopardie, whome God hath not indued with wiſe iudgement.
                     They had alſo an other Goddeſſe, whom they named Lucina: to whom they did commend women, quicke, and great with Childe, to ſende them ſafe deliuery. And without the walles of Rome, in a ſtreete called Salaria, ſhe had a great Church, wherein all the Romane women conceiued with childe, did ſacrifice to their goddeſſe Lucina: and as Fronten declareth, De veneratione Deorum: there they remayned nine dayes, and nine nightes, making their vowe.
                     
                        Numa Pompilius built the church of this Goddeſſe, which was plucked downe by the Conſull Rutilius, becauſe a Daughter of his (great with childe) made her vow, &amp; kept her nine vigilles, and vpon more deuotion was deſirous to bee deliuered in the ſaide Temple. Such was her miſhap, that her deliueric was not onely euill, but her death worſe. Whervpon Rutilius in his rage, cauſed the tēple ſecretly to be burned. For we read many times, that whē the Gentiles ſaw they were diſtreſſed, and in great neceſſity, they recommended themſelues to their Gods: and if they did not then ſuccour them in their neceſſitie, immediately they tooke from them their ſacrifice, beate downe their temples, or chaunged their Gods.
                     And further, the Gentiles had another God called Opis, which was called the God of the Babe-newborne: euen as Lucina was Goddeſſe of the Mother, which bare it.
                     The cuſtome was, that during all the nine monethes that the Woman was quicke with childe, ſhee carryed the image of the God Opis, hanging vpon her belly, tyed to her gyrdle, or ſowed to her Garments, and at the houre of her deliuerie, the Mid-wife, tooke in her handes the layde Image: and euen in the very byrth before herſelfe layde handes vpon it, ſhee firſt of all touched the Childe with the Idoll. If the childe were well borne, the parents that day made great Oblations to the Idoll: but if it were euill, or dead borne, ſtraight-wayes the Parents of the Childe did beate the Image of the poore God Opis to powder, or elſe burned it, or drowned it in the riuer.
                     Alſo the Gentiles worſhipped an other God, called Vaginatus, and vnto him they did great Sacrifice, becauſe theyr Children ſhould not weepe much: and therefore they carryed the image of this god Vaginatus hanged about their neckes, for the Gentiles thought it an euil ſigne and token, when the Babe wept much in his infancie, he ſhould haue very euill fortune in his Age.
                     They had alſo another God called God Guninus: him they honoured with Sacrifices, to the ende that hee ſhould be their Patrone, for the ſafetie of theyr Children, in their cradels. And thoſe which were poore, had the God Guninus, hanged vpon the cradels, but the Rich had very ſumptuous cradels, wherein were painted manie Gods, Gunini: Herodian, and Pulio, declareth in the life of Seuerus, how that when the Emperour Seuerus was in the warre againſt the Gaules, his wife (whoſe name was Iulia) was deliuered of a Daughter, which was his firſt. And it happened that a Siſter of this Iulia, named Meſa, natiue of Perſia, and of the Cittie of Meſa, ſent vnto her Siſter at Rome, a Cradell, all of an Vnicorns horne, and fine gold, and

about the ſame was paynted many images of the God Cuninus. The cradle was of ſo great value, that many yeares after it was kept in the treaſurie of Rome. Though indeed the Romanes kept thoſe things, more for the deſire of memorie, then for the loue of riches.
                     The Romaines had likewiſe an other god, whome they called god Ruminus, which was as much to ſay, as god of ſucking-babes, and to him, the Matrones of Rome offred diuers ſacrifices, to the end he would keepe their breaſts frō corruption, and giue them milke enough for their little children. And all the while they gaue the child ſucke, they had the image of this God about their necks, hanging downe to their breaſts. And euery morning before ſhe gaue the child ſucke, the mother ſent a diſhful of milk to offer the god Ruminus: and if ſhe happened to bee in ſuch place where there was no Church dedicated to the god Ruminus, then ſhe bathed her god Ruminus, which ſhe daily carryed with her, in milke.
                     They had alſo another God, whom they called god Stellinus, and him they impropered to their Children, when they began to goe. To this god the matrones offred many gifts that their children might not be lame, dwarfes, nor impotent, or decrepite, but that they might be able to goe well. For among the Romanes, thoſe that were criples or dwarfs, were had in ſuch cō
                        tempt, that they could neyther beare office in the Senate, nor be admitted Prieſts in the Temples.
                     
                        Hercules in his third Booke, De repub: 
                        Hercules de repub: ſaith, that Cornelia, (that worthy woman and Mother of the Gracchi,) had her two firſt ſonnes, the one Lame, and the other a Dwarfe.
                     Wherevpon ſuppoſing the God Stellinus had beene wrath with her, ſhee built him a temple, in the twelfth region, neere to the fieldes Gaditanus, amongſt the Gardens of Detha: and this temple remained till the time of Randagagiſmus, who beſieging Rome, deſtroyed the Temples, and brake vp their Gardens and buyldings round about Rome.
                     
                     They had alſo an other God, called Adeon, and his charge was, that when the Childe could goe well, hee ſhould goe to his mother, and make much of her. And albeit Cicero in his booke, De natura Deorum, putteth this God Cicero de natura Deorum. amongſt the other Gods, yet I do not remember, that I haue euer read that this god had any temple in Rome, till the time of Mammea, mother of the Emperour Antoninus. This excellent woman being left a widowe, and with two little children, deſiring that they might be wel and vertuouſly brought vp, and that they ſhould increaſe their loue towards her, ſhe built to the god Adeon, a ſumptuous temple in the xii. region Vaticanus, neer to the Gardens of Domicilius, and hard adioyning to that alſo, ſhee erected one other edifice called Sacellum Mammae, where ſhe abode ſolitarilie for a time. For the manner and cuſtome at that time was, that all widowes (which would bring vp their Children in good diſcipline) ſhould immediately ſeuer themſelues farre from the dangerous pleaſures of Rome.
                     
                     The ancients had alſo an other God called Mentallis, which was in effect god of wit. That is to wit, he had authoritie and power to giue Children good or euill ſence. And to this god the ancients did great ſacrifices, eſpecially the Greekes, much more then the Romanes. For as much as Seneca ſaith, that he doth maruell nothing at all of that the Greekes knew: but that which made him moſt to maruel, was of that they knewe not, ſince they had the temple of the God Mentallis within their ſchooles.

All the children whom they ſent to learne Philoſophy, were by the lawes of Athens bound to ſerue three yeeres in that Temple. And to omit that which Seneca ſpake of the Greekes, I dare boldly ſay and affirme (to many which at theſe dayes are liuing) that if it bee true, he gaue ſence and vnderſtanding to men, that they would to day, rather then to morrow withdraw themſelues to goe into thoſe Temples, and there offer their vowes. For nothing in the World hapneth to men more, then the want of witte and vnderſtanding how to gouerne themſelues, and liue in quiet.
                     They had alſo another God Volunus, and a Goddeſſe called Voluna, theſe two had the charge of affiance in Wedlocke, and therefore they were two, becauſe the one ſhould helpe the man, and the other ſhould helpe the woman. The manner vvas ſuch, that during the time of their marriage, each of them vvare the Image of their owne God about theyr necks, &amp; thoſe were of gold or ſiluer. And after they were married, the Bridegroome gaue vnto his Spouſe, the Goddeſſe Voluna, and the Bride vnto her husband the God Volunus. At ſuch times as the Conſuls were created at Rome, and the Kings baniſhed, and before the comming of the Emperours, a litle before the Cornelians moued ciuill commotions in Rome, there was one Conſul amongſt all theſe whoſe name was Balbus. It is ſayde he was the firſt that builded the Temple of Volunus and Voluna. It did ſtand in the ninth Ward of the City, neere vnto the gate Corinthia, and was called Scripta Balbi. And nigh vnto it was another building called Theatrum Balbi. All the Conſuls, Senatours, noble and renowned Barons were married in the Temple, which Balbus built. That night that Pompey the Great married Iulius Caeſars daughter, there were ſome that ſayd that Pompey refuſed to marry her in the Temple of the Gods Volunus, and Voluna, whereupon they diuined ſtraight that the marriage would not endure long betwixt them. As writeth Publius Victor in his third booke De nuptiis Antiquorum. The auncient Pub. Vict. De nuptiis Antiq. Pagans honoured a God called Agreſtes, as much to ſay, as the God of fields and fruites: to him they offered no ſacrifice but twice in the yeare that is to ſay, in Seede time, and in harueſt.
                     The Phrygians (that is the Troians and Cicilians) greatly obſerued this God Agreſtes, and it was for that in thoſe two Countries, there was gathered ſuch plenty of corne to make bread, that Phrygia was the great garner of Aſia, and Trinacria (that was Cicilia) was the Corne houſe of Europe. They had another God called Belus, which was Patrone of men of warre. For euen as the Chriſtians, when they come to the point to giue battell, make their prayers vnto God: ſo likewiſe the Auncients in the ſame point did kneele downe, and recommend themſelues to God Belus.
                     
                     
                        Liuie declareth, that in all other things which were done, and wherof the Romane Knights were accuſed in the battell of Cannas againſt Hannibal, was for that they did not recommend themſelues at all to the God Belus, when they ſhould giue battell, ſaying the Carthagians remained Conquerours, becauſe they a little before honoured the god Mars, and the Romaines were vanquiſhed, for that they offered no Sacrifice to God Belus. When Pirrus, King of the Epirotes (that is of Albany) came into Italy, and that the Romanes were aduertiſed, hee brought with him many Engines, and ſubtill inuentions for the war, they decreed to build a Tēple for god Belus within the wals

                        Rome, in the ninth warde neere the gate Carmentalle, and it was named Edes Beloe, in the front whereof was a maruellous ſumptuous and ſtately piller, wherein was grauen the order of battell.
                     The Gentiles had another God called the God of Victory, to whome the Romanes (more then any other Nation) did ſacrifices, to the end they might obtaine victory of their enemies. Of this God Victoria, there was many magnificent Temples in Rome, but the chiefeſt and the greateſt was adioyning to the gate Venia, in the twelfth warde, in the place called Della Victoria. It was built in the yeare of the foundation of Rome, foure hundreth, threeſcore and ſeuenteene. And it was for the occaſion of the victory, that Appius Claudius, and Quintus Fabius had in Sicill, the firſt time the Romane people fought againſt the Africanes, Herones beeing King. Of this warre and victory, roſe the cruell, long, and perillous warres betweene Rome and Affricke.
                     
                     There was another God amongſt the Gods, whom the Auncients called Honorius, which had the charge that the Inne-keepers ſhould honor and gently entertaine Pilgrimes and ſtrangers: ſo that they ſhould bee well handled through the Prouinces and Realmes whereby they paſſed. And there was a cuſtome in Rome, that euer when any Romane ſhould goe any voyage, his wife immediately ſhould goe to the Temple of God Honorius to doe her ſacrifices. In the 15. yeare after that Hannibal paſſed into Italy, the Romanes knew by a Propheſie, that as ſoone as they brought the Image of the Goddeſſe Berecinthia (mother of all the Gods) into Rome: ſo ſoone Hannibal ſhould retire out of Italy. And to bring this to paſſe, the Romanes ſent their Ambaſſadors into Phrygia, which is one part of Aſia, to the end they ſhould bring the Goddeſſe Berecinthia vnto Rome. And becauſe their Ambaſſadours ſhould goe well and returne ſafe, and that in comming and going through the Realms, they ſhould entertaine them well, and doe them honour: they built a Temple for the God Honorius within the walles of Rome, in the fourth ward, in a place which they called Forum Tranſitorium.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XII. Of other more naturall and peculiar Gods which the auncient people had.
                     
                     
                        And becauſe it ſhould not be too tedious a thing to name all Naturall &amp; peculiar Gods. the gods which the Gentiles worſhipped, and ſemblably, in whoſe time and raigne they honoured the moſt, and what Realms were more repleniſhed then others: And furthermore, for what cauſes ſo many Temples and buildings were ordayned and erected for them: I will make mention onely of theſe Gods which were called naturall Gods and particular Gods, and declate why the Gentiles honoured them.
                     And this onely moueth mee to it, becauſe that thoſe which ſhall ſee this my writing, may know what a ſpeciall grace God hath giuen to them, which are borne in the time of the Chriſtian Law,
                     Know you therefore, that the God Eſculanus was the God of Mines of gold and ſiluer. Pecunia was the goddeſſe of mettalles, and they prayed vnto her, to giue them treaſures and riches. Feſſoria was the Goddeſſe of

trauellers and Pilgrimes, and they prayed to her, that ſhee would not ſuffer them to bee weary that trauelled on foot.
                     
                        Pelonia was a Goddeſſe, which had the charge to driue the enemies out of the land.
                     
                        Eſculapius was the God and patrone of ſicke men, and if the maladie were great, they called vpon the God Apollo, which was Father to Eſculapius. Spinenſis was a God whome the Auncients prayed to keepe the corn from thiſtles and thornes. Rubigo, was a God which kept the vines from wormes, and the corne from Locuſts. Fortuna was the Goddeſſe of good fortune: and to her the auncient wiues of Rome made a Temple in the time of Silla and Marius. Muta was the Goddeſſe to whom the Auncients prayed, that ſhee would not ſuffer their enemies to ſpeak, when they would ſpeake euill of them. Genoria was a Goddeſſe that had the charge to chaſe ſlothfulnes from them, that recommended themſelues to her, &amp; the Greekes honoured her, eſpecially the Philoſophers, when they entred into ſtudy and Vniuerſities. Stimula was a Goddeſſe which haſtned thē of their buſineſſe, to the end they ſhould not forget any thing they had to doe. And her Image was at Rome ouer the gate of the Senate houſe, for ſhe was taken for an Aduocate of the pleaders.
                     
                        Murcia was a Goddeſſe, and an Aduocate for men and women which deſired not to bee leane or weake of their bodies: and to this Goddeſſe, the women of Rome offered many gifts, to the end they might bee fat: For in Rome, maydens and women are forſaken becauſe they bee leane and ſlender, and not for that they be foule and fat,
                     
                        Buſina properly was a Goddeſſe of the fields, and to her the Ancients offered ſacrifice, becauſe ſhe ſhould looke to the graſſe that grew in the fieldes. And the Scithians were great worſhippers of that Goddeſſe, becauſe they had no houſes in towns, but kept the fieldes euen with theyr flockes, which if they wanted graſſe, dyed immediately, and then they were vtterly vndone.
                     
                        Iugatiuus was he that was called the Cod of the high Mount, and to him the Ancients made a lodge and Altars in the toppe of the higheſt Mountaines, whereunto they went oftentimes to doe ſacrifice, eſpecially when it thundered and lightned.
                     
                        Vallonia was the Goddeſſe of the valleyes, and ſhe had the charge to bridle the waters that deſcended frō the mountaines, to the end they ſhould not endamage the medowes and milles whereby they paſſed.
                     
                        Ceres was a goddeſſe of all Nations honoured, for that ſhee was a Goddeſſe of corne, and of other ſoueraigne ſeedes: And the Ancients had a cuſtome to offer her a loafe of all the ſeedes and corne that they ſowed. Her Lodges and Altars to doe ſacrifice were in the fields, but beſides thoſe, ſhee had a Temple in Rome in the ninth Warde, in the fields of Mars. hard by the gardens of Lucullus, and it is ſayde, that out of this Temple came firſt the fountaine of Scipio.
                     
                     
                        Segecia was a Goddeſſe that had the charge to make the ſeeds to grow after they were ſowne. I doe not remember I haue read that ſhee had any Temple in Rome.
                     
                     
                        Tutillina was a Goddeſſe, whoſe office was to entreat Iupiter not to beate downe the corne with hayleſtones when it was ready for to bee reapt. And the Auncients painted her in ſuch ſort, that it ſeemed Iupiter did cauſe it to raine ſtones, and that this Goddeſſe Tutillina ſhould

gather them all. Shee had a Temple in Rome in the tenth warde, in the Market place of Apollo, neere vnto the houſe of Romulus. And at euery time when it thundered, immediately the Romanes lighted a great number of Candles in the Temple to appeaſe the goddeſſe that ſhee ſhould keepe their corne and ſeed from hurt.
                     
                        Flora was the mercifull goddeſſe of the Vines, that preſerued them frō froſt. And thoſe of Capua were great worſhippers of this Goddeſſe, for they ſay that they were the firſt that planted vines in Italy.
                     
                     
                        Matura was a Goddeſſe that had the charge to ripe grapes: and the Auncients vſed a cuſtome, to offer the firſt grapes which were ripe, in the place where the Goddeſſe was. And for the more part, euery man that had Vines, made in the field a lodge and an Altar to ſacrifice vnto her.
                     
                        Ruana was a Goddeſſe and Aduocate for them that gathered the corn and other graines, to the end they ſhould doe no hurt in cutting away the eare, nor ſhould marre the ſtraw and that in cutting, the corne ſhould not ſhake from the eare. And therefore the Auncients painted her, holding in her right hand a handfull of ſtraw, and the eares were whole.
                     
                        Forculus was the God of Lockeſmithes, and the Auncients ſacrificed to him, becauſe he ſhould locke faſt the dores, and ſhould not ſuffer them to bee broken open, nor picked, nor adultered keyes to bee made: The Ancients painted this God, holding a chain in one hand, and two doores in the other: His Image was ouer the Gate of Trigemine, and eſpecially ouer their doores that had enemies.
                     
                        Limentimen, was God of the hammers of the gates. I could not finde what the intention was to inuent this God, but as I thinke (not for that I haue found it written) they prayed this God, that when there ſhould come any enemy of theirs to the houſe, that hee ſhould cauſe thē ſtumble, and fall before the doore, if perhappes by negligence it were left open.
                     
                        Fortulus was the God of the gates, and the Ancients did paint him with two gates in his hands, and did ſacrifice to him, becauſe no man ſhould open the gates to the enemies when they ſlept: and to him the Romains did ſacrifice in all the gates of Rome, and thoſe which had enemies, would paint him in the gates of their houſe.
                     
                        Cardea was a Goddeſſe of the bars and hinges of the gates, and the cauſe why the Auncients did ſacrifice to her, was that no man ſhould breake the gates, nor lift vp the hinges, and that if they went about to put to their hands, immediately the hinges ſhould make a noyſe to awake the Maſter of the houſe, that hee might heare it, and know that his enemies were at the gate.
                     There was another God who was called Siluanus, and was moſt honored among the Auncients, eſpecially among all the Romanes. This God had the charge to keepe thoſe from perill and miſfortune that went for their pleaſures and recreation to the Gardens, as Plinie ſayth in an Epiſtle he wrote to Rutilius. The firſt that Plin. ad Rutil. built a Temple for the God Siluanus, was Mecenas, which was in the time of Auguſtus. And hee deſired aboue all other men, to make feaſts and banquets in Gardens. This Temple was in the eleuenth Warde, in the field of the Goddeſſe Venus, neare vnto the houſe of Murcea, which was deſtroyed in the time of the Emperour Antoninus Pius, through an Earthquake, whereby many buildings and houſes fell

in Rome.
                     
                     
                        Iugatiuus was the God of marriages, who had charge to make the loue which begunne in youth, to endure till the olde age.
                     It was wonderful to ſee how the women newly married went on pilgrimage for Deuotion vnto this God, and what gifts and preſents they offered in his Temple. Suetonius Tranquillus ſayeth, that there was a Temple of this God, but I finde not in writing by whom it was built, ſaying that Helius Spartanus ſayeth, that the Emperour Heliogabalus found much riches in the Temple of Iugatibus, the which hee tooke away to maintaine his wars.
                     
                        Bacchus was the God of drunkards, and the cuſtome in Rome was, that only mad men and fooles celebrated the feaſt of this God, and if there were found any of wit and vnderſtanding (were it neuer ſo little) they thruſt him forthwith out of the Temple, and ſought in his ſteade another drunkard. The Temple of Bacchus was in the 10. Warde, in the meadowes which they call Bacchanales, without the City, in the way of Salaria, by the Altars of the goddeſſe Februa, and it was built by the Gaules when they beſieged Rome in the time of Camillus. Februa was a Goddeſſe for the feuers, and they vſed in Rome when any was taken with the feauer, immediately to ſend ſome ſacrifice vnto her.
                     This Goddeſſe had no Temple at all, but her Image was in Pantheon, which was a Temple, wherein all the Gods were, and in this place they ſacrificed vnto her.
                     
                        Pauor was the God of feare, who had the charge to take feare from the Romanes hearts, and to giue them ſtoute courage againſt their enemies.
                     The Temple of this God Pauor was in Rome, in the ſixth Ward-, in the place of Mamuria, neare to the olde Capitoll: and euer when they had any enemies, the Romaines forth with offered in this place ſacrifices, and there was in the ſame Temple a ſtatue of Scipio the Affricane, all of ſiluer, which hee offered there, when hee triumphed ouer the Carthagenians.
                     
                     
                        Meretrix was the Goddeſſe of diſhoneſt women, and as Publius Victor ſayeth, There was in Rome, forty ſtreetes of common women, In the middeſt whereof the Temple of this Meretrix was.
                     It chanced in the time of Ancus Martius (the fourth King of the ſeuen Romane Kinges) that there was in Rome a Curtezan, Natiue of Laurento, which was ſo fayre, that with her body ſhee gained great riches, wher of ſhee made all the Romane people partakers. Wherefore in the memory of her the Romanes built there a temple, and made her Goddeſſe of all the common women in Rome.
                     
                     
                        Cloatina was Goddeſſe of the ſtoole, and to this Goddeſſe all thoſe commended themſelues which were troubled with the Collycke, to the ende ſhee would helpe them to purge their bellies.
                     
                        Quies was the Goddeſſe of reſt, and to her the Romanes did offer great Sacrifices, becauſe that ſhe ſhould giue them pleaſure and reſt, eſpecially on that day, when there was any triumph or ſolemnitie in Rome, they gaue in this Temple many giſtes, becauſe ſhee ſhould preſerue the glory and ioy of the triumphes.
                     
                        Numa Pompilius ſecond King of the Romaines, built the Temple of this Goddeſſe, and it was without the City, for to note that during the life of man in this world, hee could neyther haue pleaſure nor reſt.

                        Theatrica was a Goddeſſe, which had the charge to keepe the Theaters and Stages, when the Romanes celebrated their Playes: and the occaſion of inuenting of this Goddeſſe was, becauſe when the Romaines would ſet foorth theyr Tragedyes, they made ſo ſolemne Theaters, that there might well ſtand twentie thouſand men aboue, and as manie vnderneath, for to behold the ſpectacle. And ſometime it hapned, that for the great weight of them aboue, the wood of the Theaters and Stages brake, and killed all thoſe which were vnderneath: and ſo after this ſort all their paſtime turned into ſorrow.
                     The Romanes (which vvere prouided in all things) agreed to doe Sacrifice vnto the Goddeſſe Theatrica: to the ende ſhee ſhould preſerue them, from the dangers of the Theaters, and built her a Temple in the ninth ward, in the market-place of Cornelia: neere to the Houſe of Fabij.
                     
                     
                        Domitian the twelfth Emperour of Rome, deſtroyed this Temple, becauſe in his preſence one of the Theaters brake, and killed manie people. And for that the Goddeſſe Theatrica had not better preſerued them: hee made this Temple to be beaten down.
                     Peraduenture thoſe that haue read little, ſhall finde theſe things now ynough: but let them reade Cicero in his booke De Natura Deorum: Ihon Bocchas of the Genealogie of Gods, Cic: de na tu. Deorum. and Pulio, of the Auncients Gods: And Saint Auguſtine in the firſt, the eleuenth, and the eighteenth booke of Citie of God: and they ſhall finde a great number more, then is heere ſpoken of.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XIII. ¶ How Tiberius the Knight was choſen Gouernour of the Empyre, and afterwards created Emperour, onely for being a good Chriſtian. And how GOD depriued Iuſtinian the younger, both of his Empyre and Senſes, for beeing an Heretique.
                     
                     
                        THe fiftie Emperour of Rome, was Tiberius Conſtantinus: who ſucceeded Iuſtinian the younger, which was a cruell Emperour. And Paulus Dyaconus ſayeth, That hee was an enemie to the poore, a Thiefe to the Rich, a great louer of riches, and an enemie to himſelfe in ſpending them.
                     
                     For, the propertie of a couetous man, is to liue like a Beggar all the dayes of his life, and to be found rich at the houre of his death.
                     This Iuſtinian was ſo exceeding couetous, that hee commaunced ſtrong coffers and cheſts of yron to be made and brought into his Pallace, to keepe in ſafety the euil-gotten treaſures that he had robbed. And of this you ought not to maruell: for Seneca ſaith, That couetous Princes do not only ſuſpect their Subiects, but alſo themſelues.
                     
                     In thoſe daies the Church was greatly defiled by the hereſie of the Pelagians, and the maintayner of that Sect, was this wicked Prince Iuſtinian: So that for himſelfe hee procured riches, and for the Diuel he cheapned ſoules. For, thoſe that are once forſaken of the hand of GOD, doe not onely become Couetouſnes the root of all euill. ſeruaunts of the Deuills, but alſo labour to bring others to Hell.
                     Wherefore ſithence the ſinnes of men are diuers, and the judgements of GOD kept ſecrete, and yet the liuing

God is, ſo mercifull, that notwithſtanding his mercy would ſaue the ſoules, he will alſo with iuſtice chaſtice the bodies. And therefore ſeing the obſtinacy of this Emperour to bee ſuch, that the longer he liued, the more hee augmented his damnation, the wrath of God lighted vpon him, &amp; ſuddenly without any grudge The iuſt iudgement of God. or token of ſickneſſe, this Emperour Iuſtinian was bereued of his ſences, and became a foole, and becauſe the matter was ſo ſodaine, it cauſed in Rome great feare and admiration, for that the Prince was a foole, and all the Empire chaunged. And indeed this Emperour was ſo ſtrucken, that his life and folly ended both in one day. For the diſeaſes which God ſendeth to Princes, commeth not through fault of humours, but through the corruption of manners. Alſo there is no medicine that can reſiſt it, not yet any other thing that can remedy it. The people perceyuing how the Emperour through his ſinnes was (according to the diuine pleaſure) become a foole, agreede (ſith there was no remedie for his diſeaſe) to chooſe ſome good perſon, to whom the charge of the publike weale might be giuen: for truely a man needeth great patience and wiſdome to gouerne an other mans, thē for that which is his own proper. The lot befell to a Knight, Tiberius ſo called, a man for truth, both chaſt, iuſt, profitable, ſage, vertuous, hardy, mercifull, charitable, in feates of armes aduenturous, and aboue all a good Chriſtian.
                     And let not this thing bee little regarded, that the Prince be a good Chriſtian: For there is no ſtate ſo happy as that which is gouerned by a Prince of a good and faithfull conſcience, and becauſe hee wanted no vertues to adorne a Prince, hee was both feared of many, and beloued of all. Which thing ought not lightly to bee eſteemed; for it is the chiefeſt thing that belongeth to Princes, that is to ſay, for their gentle conuerſation to bee beloued, and for their vpright Iuſtice to be feared. This Emperour Iuſtinian had a wife, whoſe name was Sophia Auguſta, which was beautifull and ſage, and as touching her perſon of good renowne ſufficient. For women muſt take great reſpect, leſt they giue ſtrā
                        gers occaſion to ſpeake of them, but Good counſell for women. notwithſtanding all theſe things, this Dame was noted of couetouſneſſe: for ſhee toyled alwayes to hoarde vp money, and delighted to ſee and tell it, but to ſpend or giue it, was alwaies her greateſt griefe: For couetous perſons little regard to ſhorten their life, ſo that they may augment their riches.
                     
                        Tiberius Conſtantine, as Gouernour of the Empire (ſeeing the Empreſſe Sophia Auguſta rich, and deſiring more the profite of the Commonwealth, then the enrichment of himſelfe or of any other) did nothing elſe but build Monaſteries, repaire Hoſpitals, marry Orphanes, and redeeme Captiues. For ſpeaking according to the Chriſtian lawes, becauſe Difference betweene a good Prince &amp; a Tyrant. that a man hath more then neneſſary, ought to bee employed to the vſe of the poore, and to works of mercy.
                     Finally, this vertuous Prince did that which Chriſtian Princes ſhould doe, and not as tyrants doe, which made him of great excellency. For the property of a Tyrant is to heape great treaſures of other mens goods, and afterward to ſpend and conſume them viciouſly: but Tiberius found them gathered together by one, and hee diſperſed them to many. Sophia Auguſta, ſeeing Iuſtinian become a foole, &amp; not knowing how to gette more money of the people, nor how

to robbe the rich, and that Tiberius ſpent her riches without compaſſion, partly to ſatisfie her ſorrowfull heart, and partly to ſee, if in time to come, ſhee could remedy it, called one day Tiberius a part, and ſpake vnto him theſe words in ſecret.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XIIII. Of the words the Empreſſe Sophia ſpake vnto Tiberius Conſtantinus then being gouernour of the Empire, which onely tended to reproue him for that hee lauiſhly conſumed the Treaſure of the Empire gotten by her.
                     
                     
                        
                           THou remembreſt well Tiberius, that thogh 
                        The ſpeech of Sophia vnto Tiberius. 
                        thou art now after Iuſtinian Gouernor of the Empire: yet when thou waſt in Alexandrie, thou thoughteſt very little to deſerue it, and if thou diddeſt, thou thoughteſt thou couldeſt not attaine vnto it. For thou art a wiſe man, and the ſage man (according to the little or much which fortune giueth him) doth not raigne or ſlacke alwayes the bridle of his thoughts. Thoſe which haue a vaine hope, and thorow power only will inforce fortune to bee fauourable vnto them, ſhall liue alwayes a troubleſ me life.
                     
                     
                        For there is nothing that ſhortneth more the life of man then vain hope and idle thoughts. Thou beeing ſuch a man as thou art, and ſo well willed and beloued of Iuſtinian my husband, art demaunded of the Romane people, and choſen by the Senate, receyued by the Souldiers, and all the Empire reioyce at thy election.
                     
                     
                        And thou oughteſt not a little to regard it. For the willes of all doe not alwayes fauour one. I let thee to vnderſtand Tiberius, that it did not diſpleaſe mee thou ſhouldeſt bee Emperour of Rome, ſith Iuſtinian was depoſed, and if I had perceyued that which I doe perceyue, or had knowne that which I doe know, I am certaine that I had neyther ſayde with it, nor againſt it. For wee women are of ſo little credite, that it preuayleth vs more To approue the leaſt of that which other ſay, then it doth to ſpeake very well of our ſelues. Sith Fortune hath brought thee to ſo high an eſtate, I beſeech thee, admoniſh thee, &amp; aduiſe thee, that thou know how to keepe and gouerne thy ſelfe therein. For to ariſe to honour, It ſufficeth the body to ſweate water, but to maintaine it, it is neceſſary that the heart weepe bloud.
                     
                        Thou knoweſt right well, that to commaund more, to doe more, and to haue more then other (as touching the affayres of Princes) oftentimes is giuen more thorow worldly care, then for the deſert of the perſon. And this God ſuffereth very often, to the end wee may ſee thoſe diſcend, and fall thorow infamy, whom we ſaw mount and proſper by pride. Thou art a man, and I a woman: Thou haſt wiſdome and knowledge, but I haue large and long experience, and if thou knoweſt much, I haue ſeene in the world enough, but in faith for that I haue ſaid I tell thee, that men of thy ſort are vndone in the Pallace of Princes, by two wayes. The one, if they thinke they deſerue much, and they can doe little. For haughty minds bring alwayes alteration in the heart, The other is, that one alone will command the Emperour and the Empire, whereunto if any man come, it is by great trauell, and hee ſhall ſuſtaine it with danger, and ſhall poſſeſſe it but a ſhort time. For it is impoſſible that to a man of much arrogancy, Fortune ſhould bee too long faithfull.
                     
                     
                        Though thou be wiſe and ſage, I
                        
                        counſell thee alwayes to profite with another mans counſell, chiefly in things concerning the gouernement of the eſtate. For to know how to obey, and to know how to commaund, differ much.
                     
                     
                        For to know how to obey, commeth by nature: but to know how to command, commeth by long experience, Take this of me for a generall rule, that whereas thou ſeeſt thy Prayer to be acceptable, neuer take vpon thee commaundement: for by commandement thou ſhalt bee feared, and by prayer thou ſhalt be beloued: know thou Tiberius, the things that content them worſt, which are in the Courts of Princes: are to doe little, to haue little, and to be little worth. For the man that is without fauour, in his heart, is halfe dead. For the contrarie, the thing which moſt perilleth the Fauorites of Princes, and maketh them looſe theyr Friendſhip, is to bee of great power, and great in Authoritie, and moreouer then this, to profite more of will then knowledge, of authoritie then of reaſon. For a man cannot liue long in Friendſhip, which doth what he will, in the commonwealth.
                     
                     
                        I haue ſpoken all this, to the ende thou ſhouldeſt knowe that I greatly maruell at thy prudence, and haue no leſſe wonder of my patience. To ſee that the Treaſours which Iuſtinian heaped together by great trauell, kept and preſerued with great care, thou waſteſt without reſpect what thou doeſt.
                     
                     
                        Wherefore doe not maruell at this; For there is no patience can ſuffer to ſee the proper goods waſted and ſpent by the handes of an other, which with ſo great care hath bene gathered together.
                     
                     
                        I let thee to know Tiberius, that now wee haue neyther Money to keepe, nor to giue to others: which thing is very perillous for the Pallaces of Princes. For the ſame to haue great ſtore of Treaſurs, occaſioneth Princes to keep their enemies in feare.
                     
                     
                        It is neceſſary for Princes to be ſtoute and alſo rich, for by their ſtoutnes they may gouerne their owne, and by their riches, they way repreſſe theyr enemyes. It is not onely neceſſarie that the Prince bee not poore, but alſo it is requiſite that his Common-wealth be rich. For where people are poore, of theyr Enemyes they are nothing regarded. And where the Common-wealth is rich, the Prince cannot be greatly poore. I will not denie but that it is well done to helpe the poore, and ſuccour the needy: But yet I ſay, that no man ought to giue the Treaſour vnto any one in particular, which is and hath been long kept in ſtore, for the preſeruation of all. For oftentimes the Prince which is too liberall in giuing of his owne, is afterwards (through neceſſitie,) compelled 
                              •
                           o become a Tyrant, and ſo to take from others.
                     
                     I let thee know Tyberius, that thou ſhalt finde few Princes, but are eyther prowd, malignant, or vicious. For of a truth, Wantonnes, Libertie, Youth, and Riches, are commonly moſt cruell enemyes to honeſtie.
                     
                     
                        Notwithſtanding, I will not ſay that all Princes haue beene euill, but I will ſay (according to the old prouerbe) that there hath been too few good: And that thoſe which of Gods mercifull gift, eyther are or will be good and vertuous, ought to be greatly honoured. For no time ought to be called happy, but that wherein vertuous Princes doe raigne.
                     
                     
                        And furthermore I ſay to thee Tiberius, if Princes become Tyrants for want of Riches, ſo doe they become vicious, through aboundance of Treaſures: And in this caſe vicious Princes are chaſtened in the ſame vice. For Auarice hath ſuch power ouer them, that it ſuffereth them not to taſte theyr owne delight.
                     
                     
                        Againe, I let thee know Tiberius, that there are many Princes which are of good nature, &amp; yet becom Tyrants, for nothing elſe but becauſe they be oppreſſed with pouertie. For truely the Noble heart reſuſeth no danger, ſeeing himſelfe aſſaulted with pouertie.
                     
                     
                        
                        Therefore I demaund of thee which is better, or otherwiſe which of theſe two euils is leaſt: that the Prince bee poore, and with that a Tyrant, or that he be rich, and therewith vicious.
                     
                     
                        In mine opinion it were much better to be rich and vicious, then a Tyrant and poore, for in the end if he do euill by vice, hee ſhould bee euill vnto no man but to himſelfe: by riches he ſhould profite all the people. And if he be poore and a Tyrant, hee ſhould doe great euill to many, and by pouerty hee could profit no man. For the poore Prince cannot maintaine the rich, and much leſſe ſuccour the poore, without compariſon it is much more profitable to the Commonwealth, and more tollerable to men, that the Prince bee an euill man, and therewithall a good Prince: then an euil Prince, and therewithall a good man. For as Plato ſayeth, The Athenians would alwayes rather ſeeke a profitable then a ſtout Prince: and the Lacedemonians did erre, in willing rather a ſtoute Prince then profitable.
                     
                        Therefore ſee Tiberius, it is more ſure and profitable for the Common wealth, that Princes haue Treaſures to giue liberally among their ſeruants, then that they ſhould bee poore and enforced to oppreſſe the people with taxes and Subſidies. For Princes oft times through pouerty take occaſion to leuy great Subſidies in their realmes &amp; ſeigniories.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XV. The anſwer of Tiberius vnto the Empreſſe Sophia Auguſta, Wherein hee declareth that noble Princes need not boarde vp great treaſures: And of the hidden treaſure this good Emperour found by Reuelation, in the Pallace where he remained.
                     
                     
                        
                           TIberius heard very patiently the admonition of the Empreſſe, wherefore with great reuerēce hee aunſwered, and with ſweet and gentle words hee ſpake to her in this ſort.
                     
                        I haue heard and vnderſtood what you 
                        Tiberius anſwere. 
                        haue tolde mee, moſt noble Princeſſe Sophia, and alwayes Auguſta, and doe receyue your, gentle admonitions, moſt humbly thanking you for your louing counſell, which principally you giue me in ſo high a ſtile. For oftentimes ſicke men abhorre not meates, not for that the meates are not good, but becauſe they are not well dreſſed. If it were Gods pleaſure, I would I knew aſwell how to doe theſe things, as you know how to ſpeake them.
                     
                     
                        And doe not maruell, though I make hereof a doubt; for wee greatly deſire to prayſe vertuous workes, but to put them in practiſe, wee are very ſlow. Speaking therefore with ſuch reuerence, (as is due vnto ſo high a Lady) to euery one of theſe thinges which your Excellency hath tolde mee, I will aunſwere in one word. For it is reaſon ſith you haue ſpoken that which you perceiue of my deedes, that I ſpeake that which I gather of your wordes. You tell me that when I was in Alexandrie, I thought not to bee Gouernour of the
                        
                        Empire after Iuſtinian, &amp; that I thoght not my ſelfe worthy to deſerue it, nor yet looked to come vnto it.
                     
                     
                        To this I anſwere, that though by reaſon I gouerned my ſelfe at that time, yet I ought not to thinke to deſerue ſuch a dignitie, nor to come to ſo high an eſtate. For thoſe which by vertues deſerue great Dignities are but fewe: and ſewer are thoſe which attaine vnto them, though they deſerue them, But if this matter be iudged according to ſenſualitie, I tell you truely (Dame Auguſta,) that I thought not onely to deſerue it, but alſo I thought to come vnto it. And hereof maruell not, for it is an infallible rule; Where leaſt deſert is, often-times there is moſt preſumption.
                     
                     
                        You ſay you eſteemed mee for a wiſe man, and that by wiſedome I could ouer-come any difficult, or diſordinate appetite.
                     
                     
                        To this I anſwere, that you knewe my wiſedome, either in mine owne buſines, or elſe in other mens affaires. If in other mens affaires, (where it did coſt mee nought) I was alwayes a louer of iuſtice, For there is no man in the world ſo euill, that doth not deſire (if it bee without his owne coſt) to be counted liberall. But if you iudge mee (Dame Auguſta,) on mine owne buſineſſe, giue not too light credit. For I will that you know, there is no man ſo iuſt, nor of ſo cleare a iudgement, that doth not ſhewe himſelfe fraile 
                        The frailtie of man. 
                        in matters which touch his owne intereſt.
                     
                     
                        You ſay that men which haue their thoughts high, and their Fortunes baſe, liue alwayes a penſiue life.
                     
                     
                        Truely it is as you ſay, But in mine opinion, as the members of the bodyes are but inſtruments of the minde, ſo is it neceſſary for men to haue quicke and ſharpe wittes, if they will not be negligent. For if Alexander, Pyrrhus, Iulius Caeſar, Scipio, and Hanniball, had not beene high minded, they had neuer bene (as they were) ſo Famous, Noble, and ſtoute Princes.
                     
                     
                        I let you vnderſtand, moſt Noble Princeſſe, that men are not to be eſteemed as loſt, for hauing theyr thoughtes high, nor yet for hauing their hearts couragious, neither for being hardie and ſtout: but they are vndone, becauſe they beginne things through folly, purſue them without wiſedome, and atchieue them without diſcretion.
                     
                     
                        For, Noblemen enterpriſing great things, ought not to employ theyr force as their noble heart willeth, but as wiſedome and reaſon teacheth. You ſay, you maruell why I waſte the Treaſures without care, which Iuſtinian and you gathered together with great paine?
                     
                     
                        Now to this I anſwere, you ought not to maruell, if all the Treaſours you heaped together of ſo long time, were ſpent and conſumed in one day. For there is an ancient Malediction on riches hidden, and 
                        The ſaying of Epimenides. 
                        Treaſours buryed, which Epimenides caſteth out, ſaying theſe words: All the Treaſours hoorded vp by the Couetous, ſhall bee waſted by the Prodigall.
                     
                        You ſay, Through that I waſt in fewe dayes, you ſhall haue neither to giue, to waſte, nor yet to eate at the yeares ende.
                     
                        To this I anſwere (moſt gracious Princeſſe, that if you had beene as ready to relieue the Poore, as you and Iuſtinian were diligent to robbe the rich, then you ſhould iuſtly haue complained, and I worthily might well haue had iuſt cauſe to repent.
                     
                     
                        Till now wee haue not ſeene, but that of the Rich you haue made Poore: and notwithſtanding this, yet you haue not gotten enough to builde an Hoſpitall for the Poore. You ſay that Princes, to reſiſt theyr enemyes had neede of great Treaſures.
                     
                     
                        To this I anſwer, if Princes be proud, greedy, and of ſtrange Realmes, ambicious it is moſt certaine, that they had need of great ſubſtances and Treaſours to accompliſh and maintaine theyr diſordinate
                        
                        appetties. For the enae of a tyran nous Princ
                              ••
                           s, that he careth not whether by hooke or by crooke hee make himſelfe rich in his life.
                     
                     
                        But if the Prince be or will be a man repoſed, quiet, vertuou, patient peaceable, and 
                              〈◊〉
                            couetous of the goods of an other man, what need hath he of great treaſurs?
                     
                     
                        For to ſpeake truly, in Princes houſes there is more offence in that which aduaunceth, then in that which wanteth. I will not waſte many wordes in anſwering, ſith I am much more liberal of deeds then of wordes: But to conclude, that there is no Prince which in vertuous deedes waſteth ſo much, but if hee will, hee may ſpend much more. For in the 
                        
                           
                              〈…〉
                           . 
                        ende, Princes become not poore, for ſpending their goods and Treaſours vpon neceſſaries: but for making waſte vpon things ſuperfluous.
                     
                     
                        And take this word for all, that for this hee ſhall not be the poorer, but rather the richer. For moſt certainely, it is a generall rule in Chriſtian Religion, that God will giue more to his Seruants in one houre, then they will waſte in 20. yeares: Iuſtinian beeing Emperour 11, yeares, who (being a Foole, and very obſtinate in the hereſie of the Pelagians) dyed to the great offence of the Romaine people; whoſe death was as much deſired, as his life abhorred.
                     
                     
                        For the Tyrannous Prince, that maketh many weeping eyes in his life, ſhall cauſe many reioycing bearts at his death.
                     
                     
                        Iuſtinian being dead, Tiberius was elected Emperour, who gouerned the Empire, through ſo great wiſedome and Iuſtice, that no man was able to reproue him, if the Hyſtories in his time, did not deceyue vs. For it ſeldome happeneth to a Prince to be as he was, vpright in Iuſtice, pure in life, and cleane in Conſcience. For fewe are thoſe Princes which of ſome vices are not noted.
                     
                        Paulus Diaconus in his 18. booke of the Romaine Geſts, declareth a thing both ſtrange and maruellous, which beſel vnto this Emperour at that time, and very worthie to recite at this preſent. And it was, that in the Cittie of Conſtantinople, the Romaine Emperours had a Pallace very ſumptuous, and beſeming the authoritie of the Imperiall maieſtie, which was begun in the time of Conſtantine the Great, and afterwardes, as the ſucceſſion of good and euil Emperors was, ſo were the Buyldings decayed or repayred.
                     For it is the deede of a vertuous Prince, to aboliſh vices of the Common-wealth, and to make great and ſumptuous buildings in his countrey.
                     This Emperour Tiberius had ſpent The memorable deedes of Tiberius. much of his ſubſtance and Treaſour, for the redeeming of poore captiues, to build Hoſpitals, to erect Monaſteries, to marry and prouide for the Orphares, to ſucour poore people, and widdowes; In this and ſuch like, hee was ſo prodigall, that it came almoſt to paſſe, that hee had nothing to eate in his Pallace, And truely this was a bleſſed neceſſity. For Catholike Princes ought to think that wel imployed, which in the Seruice of Chriſt is beſtowed. And hereof this Emperour was not aſhamed, but he thought it a great honour, and that which onely grieued him was, to ſee the Empreſſe reioyce ſo much at his miſery. For the High and Noble hearts which feele themſelnes wounded, do not ſo much eſteeme their owne payne, as they do to ſee their enemyes reioyce at theyr griefe. God neuer forſooke them that for his ſake became poore, as appeareth by this.
                     It chanced one day that euen as the Emperor Tiberius walked in the middeſt of his Pallace, he ſaw at his feete a Marble-ſtone, which was in forme of the Croſſe of the Redeemer of the world. And becauſe it had bin too vniuſt a thing (as hee thought,) to haue ſpurned it with his feet, wherewith we

truſt from our enemies to bee deſended: he cauſed the ſtone to bee taken vp, not thinking any thing to bee there vnder, and immediately after they found another, wherein likewiſe Treaſure. found by Tiberius. was the forme of the Croſſe, and this beeing taken vp, they found an other in like manner, and when that was pluckt vp from the bottome. there was found a Treaſure, which contained the ſumme of two millions of Duckets; for the which the good Emperour Tiberius gaue vnto Almighty God moſt high thankes, and whereas before hee was liberall, yet afterwards hee was much more bountifull. For all thoſe treaſures hee diſtributed amongſt the poore &amp; needy people. Let therefore mightie Princes and great Lords, ſee, reade, &amp; profite by this example, and let them thinke themſelues aſſured, that for giuing 
                        A good Leſſon. 
                        almes to the poore, they need not feare to become poore: for in the end the vicious man cannot call himſelfe rich, nor the vertuous man cannot count himſelfe poore.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XVI. How the Chiefetaine Narſetes ouercame many battailes, onely for that his whole confidence was in God. And what hapned to him by the Empreſſe Sophia Auguſta: wherein may be noted the vnthankefulneſſe of Princes towards their ſeruants.
                     
                     
                        IN the yeare of the Incarnation of Chriſt, 528. Iuſtinian the Great, being Emperour, who Paul: Diacon: Lib: 18. de geſtis Roman. was the ſonne of Iuſtines ſiſter his Predeceſſor in the Empire) the Hiſtories ſay, in eſpecially Paulus Diaconus in the 18. booke De geſtis Romanorum: that there was a Knight of Greece in Rome, who from his tender yeares had bene brought vp in Italie. Hee was a man of meane ſtature, of a cholericke complexion, and in the law of Chriſt very deuout: which was no ſmall thing. For at that time not onely many knights, but almoſt all the Biſhops of Italie were Arrians.
                     
                     This Knights name was Narſetes, and becauſe he was ſo valiant in arms, and ſo aduenturous in warres, he was choſen Chieftaine generall of the Romane Empire. For the Romanes had this excellencie, that when they had a valiant and ſtout Captaine (although they might haue his weight of golde giuen them) they would neuer depart from his perſon. Hee enterpriſed ſo great things, he ouercame ſuch mightie Realms, and had ſuch notable victories ouer his enemyes, that the Romanes ſaid, he had in him the ſtrength of Hercules, the hardineſſe of Hector, the noblenes of Alexander, the pollicie of Pyrrhus, and the fortune of Scipio. For manie of the vaine Gentiles held opinion, that as the bodyes did diſtribute their goods in the life, ſo did the ſoules part theyr gifts, after the death.
                     This Narſetes was a pittifull Captain, and very conſtant in the Faith of Chriſt, liberall to giue almes, effectuous to build newe Monaſteryes, and in repairing Churches, a man very carefull. And truly it was a rare thing: For in great warres (vpon ſmal occaſions) Captains vſe to beat down churches: &amp; that which was greateſt of all was, that he feared God deuoutly, viſited The falſe opinion of the Gentils. the Hoſpitals, ſaid his deuotions with penitent teares, and aboue all, be reſorted very often to the Churches in the night.
                     And this excellencie was no leſſe then the other. For the Captaines in ſuch an houre are readier to kill men in their Campe, then to bewaile their ſinnes in the Church.
                     
                        
Finally, hee was a Chriſtian, and 
                           
                              〈…〉
                           . ſo deuoure, that God gaue him the victories more through the prayers which hee vſed, then through the weapons wherewith hee fought. For there was neuer man that ſaw him ſhed the bloud of his enemies in battell before he had ſhed the teares of his eyes in the Temple. And to the end Chriſtian Princes and Captaines may ſee how much better it is to pacific God by teares and prayers, then to haue their Campe full of ſouldiers and riches: of many of his doings I will declare part as heere followeth.
                     
                        Iuſtinian the Emperour beeing in Alexandrie, Totila King of the Gothes, did many miſchiefes, and great dammages throughout all Italy, ſo that the Romaines durſt not goe by the way, nor could bee in ſafeguarde in their houſes. For the Gothes in the The outrages of the Gothes. day kept the wayes, and in the night robbed and ſpoyled all the people, wherefore Iuſtinian the Emperour, not knowing the matter, ſent the noble Narſetes Captaine Generall againſt the Gothes, who being arriued in Italy, immediately confedered with the Lumbardes, the which at that time had their manſion in Hungarie, and ſent his meſſengers to King Albonius, (at that time their King) for ayde againſt the Gothes and in ſo doing, hee ſayde hee ſhould ſee how faithfull a friend hee would be to his friends, and how cruell an enemie to his enemies.
                     
                        Albonius hearing the meſſage of Narſetes was very glad, and without delay armed a great and puiſſant Army, which by the Adriatical ſea came into Italy: ſo that the aunſwere and the offer came both at one time with effect, and ſo together arriued in one day (for the ſuccour of Narſetes) the two Armies that is to ſay, that of the Romanes, and of the Lumbardes, the which aſſembled all in one, and marched vnder the banner of their Captaine Narſetes. Wherefore Totila King of the Gothes beeing aduertiſed, (as one that had not proued the happy fortune of Narſetes, nor the force of the Lumbardes) ſent to offer them the battell, which was giuen in the fields of Aquileia, and it was of both parts ſo fierce and cruell, that infinite were they that dyed: but in the end Totilla King of the Gothes was ouercome, and neyther hee, nor any of his hoaſt eſcaped aliue.
                     The good Captaine Narſetes, after the battell gaue many and noble gifts to the Lumbardes, and ſo with riches and victory they returned into Hungarie towards their King Albonius. And truly this Narſetes did as he was bound to doe, For the friend 
                        A worthy ſaying approned by Narſetes. 
                        cannot bee recompenced by riches, when for his friend he putteth his life in ieopardy.
                     
                     When the Lumbards were gone, Narſetes cauſed all the ſpoile of his Campe to bee deuided amongſt his ſouldiers, and that which belonged vnto him, he gaue it wholly to the poore Monaſteries: ſo that by this victory Narſetes got triple renown, that is to ſay, very bountifull, in that hee gaue to the Lumbardes, charitable, in that hee gaue to the poore, and valiant in that he vanquiſhed ſo puiſſant enemies.
                     
                        Dagobert King of France beyond the Alpes, being a couragious young Prince, and very deſirous of honour, (for no other cauſe but to leaue of him ſome memory) determined himſelfe in perſon to paſſe into Italy, although hee had no iuſt title thereunto. For the hearts puffed vp with pride little paſſe though they war of an vniuſt quarrell. His miſhap was ſuch, that the ſame day he paſſed the riuer of Rubico, where the Romanes
                        
in old time limited the marches of Italy, newes came to him that his own country was vp, and thoſe which were there, one rebelled againſt the other, that which was not without the great permiſſion of God. For it is but reaſon that that King ſhould loſe his own Realm by diuine iuſtice, which will take other mens only through mans folly. The King Dagobert aſſembling all the chiefeſt of his Realme to counſell, it was agreede and concluded by all, that hee alone in perſon ſhould returne into France, and for his reputation ſhould leaue al the Army in Italy. Whereof remayned captains, Buccelinus and Amingus. For itis better for a Prince to defend his Country by iuſtice, then to conquer another by tyranny. As this Army of Buccelinas was great, ſo was he couragious and wrought mapy and great dammages in Italy, eſpecially in the land of Campagnia. And worſe then that, al the riches that hee had ſacked, and al the captiues he had taken, hee would neyther reſtore, nor yet ſuffer them Buccelinus did many outrages in Italy. to be ranſomed: but ſo ſoone as hee tooke them, he ſent them vnto the King, as one that ſhewed himſelfe more deſirous to rob and ſpoile, then to fight and wage battell.
                     This Captaine Buccelinus then being in Campagnia, retired into a place called Tarentum with all his army becauſe of winter.
                     
                        Narſetes ſuddenly came vpon him, &amp; gaue him battell, that was between them very cruell, wherein Buccelinus was vanquiſhed, and left dead in the field amongſt the other Captaines of Gaule. Which newes brought to Amingus eares beeing the other Captaine of the Gaules, and ſeeing his companion dead, hee confedered with Auidinus Captaine of the Gothes, and they together came againſt the Romaines, which thing was not vnknowne to Narſetes, to giue the battel neer to Caietto, wheras thoſe Captains were conquered, and taken aliue. Of whom Amingus was beheaded by the commandement of Narſetes: &amp; Auidinus was ſent by him priſoner to the Emperour of Conſtantinople. The Captaine Narſetes wan another battell againſt Syndual King of Britons, which came into Italy with a huge multitude of people, to recouer the realme of Partinopilis, which now we call Naples: for he ſaid it appertained vnto him of right, as to one of the lynage of Hercules, who in ancient time was King of that Realme. This King Sindual within a time became friend vnto Narſetes, and behaued himſelfe outwardly as a friend and confederate: but in ſecret conſpired againſt the Romaines, and would haue beene King of the Romanes, and raigned alone in Italy, through the which there ſprang betweene him and Narſetes cruell wars, wherein Fortune was a long time variable: For there is not 
                        The inconſtancy of Fortune. 
                        ſo aduenturous a Captaine, to whom in long warres Fortune is alwayes proſperous.
                     
                     Finally, the King Sinduall and Narſetes agreed to hazard their men, and alſo their liues in one day vnto the diſctetion of Fortune, ſo that both the armies ioined together, and fought betweene Verona and Terento, where King Sindual was conquered, and taken aliue, and the ſame day with out any delay was hanged openly, And becauſe that Narſetes was not acuſtomed to vſe ſuch cruelty againſt thoſe that were ouercome, and eſpecially againſt Kinges and worthy Knights, he commanded his title to bee ſet on the gibbet, whereon the King hanged, which ſaid this:
                     
                        A ſimple cord here ſtopt King Synduals breath, 
                        King Synduals Epitaph.
                     
                     
                        By faultleſſe doome of hie Narſetes heſt,
                     
                     
                        Not that hee ſought by warlike deedes his death,
                     
                     
                        But that in peace he did a traytorreſt.
                     
                     
                        
Such and many other battels and victories had this aduenturous and good Captaine, not onely in the borders of Italy, but alſo in Aſia, where for many yeares hee had the gouernment of the Country. And as hee was a good Chriſtian, ſo Almighty God in all his affayres did proſper him.
                     After all theſe warres paſt, Iuſtinian the yonger ſent him to the kingdome of Conſtantinople to bee chiefe Gouernour of all thoſe Prouinces, &amp; although hee did well in warlike affayres: yet hee did much better in the adminiſtration of the commonwealth: For men that are accuſtomed to trauell in wars, haue a good learning how to gouerne the people in peace. For this occaſion (amongſt all mortall men) Narſetes was prayſed and eſteemed, that is, for his valiantneſſe in the battells which hee ouercame, for his riches through the ſpoyles that hee tooke, and for the iuſtice he miniſtred to all men where he ruled. Narſetes becauſe hee was a Grecian borne, was enuied of the Romanes, &amp; chiefly, becauſe hee dayly encreaſed both his honour and riches. For truly, vertue, honour and riches in a man are but a brand to light enuie to all the world. And this was the occaſion.
                     One day there came many noble Romaines to the Emperour Iuſtinian, and to the Empreſſe Sophia Auguſta, 
                        Ennie a foe to all vertue. to complaine of Narſetes, and of his behauiour and gouerning, and ſayde theſe wordes vnto him. wee let you know, moſt noble Prince, and Soueraigne Lady, that wee had rather (of the two) to ſerue the Gothes, then to obey the Greekes: and wee ſpeake this, becauſe that the Eunuch commaunded vs more to his owne ſeruice, then hee doth to that of yours, and the worſt is, that you know it not, and if you know it, at the leaſt you doe not remedie it, Chuſe therefore one of theſe two things, whether you wil deliuer vs from the gouernment of the Greeke, or ſuffer that wee put Rome and our ſelues into the hands of the Gothes: For it is leſſe griefe for the Romaines to be ſubiect to a puiſſant King, then to an effeminate Eunuch and tyrant.
                     
                     
                        Narſetes being preſent, hearing Narſetes reply. thoſe quarrels (as they ſay) ſaid thus: O noble Prince, if I haue committed any euill, it is vnpoſſible for mee to finde one that will doe mee good: but if I haue done well, no man ſhall be able to do me wrong.
                     
                     The Empreſſe Sophia of long time before had hated Narſetes: ſom ſayde it was becauſe he was an Eunuch, other thinke it was becauſe he was rich, and ſome other iudge, becauſe hee was in greater authority in the Empire then ſhee. Wherefore perceyuing ſhee had good occaſion and opportunity for the ſame, ſhee ſpake a word much to his reproach: which was this. Sith thou art an Eunuch, Narſetes, and not a man, it is not fitte for thee to haue a mans office, therfore 
                        The ſeuere ſentence of the Empreſſe. 
                        I commaund thee to worke with my handmaides, and there thou ſhalt ſerue to ſpin and weaue clothes.
                     
                     
                        Narſetes tooke this word heauily, and truely it was with great ſpight ſpoken. Wherefore he ſtoutly and couragiouſly ſpake vnto the Empreſſe Sophia theſe wordes, and ſayde: I had rather moſt exccellent Princeſſe, thou hadſt chaſtiſed me as a Noble Dame, then to haue reproued mee with a word, as a ſimple woman: but ſince it is ſo that you haue liberty and authority to commaund mee, know you alſo that I haue the ſelfe ſame to obey you, and therefore I take my leaue, and now I goe to weaue my webbe, which perhappes your ſelfe whileſt you liue, ſhal neuer vntwine.
                     
                     
                        Narſetes immediately went his way, and came into Itaty, vnto the

City of Naples, (chiefe and head of Campagnia) and from thence he diſpatched his Ambaſſadours immediately to the King of Hungarie, where the Lumbards at that time had theyr mantion place, counſelling them to forſake that land, ſo euil tilled, ſo barren, cold and little, and that they ſhould come and enhabite Italy, which was a plaine Country, fertile and ample, temperate and very rich, and that now or neuer they ſhould conquer it. And Narſetes therewith not contented, (but to prouoke his friends the more, and make them the more couetous) ſent them part of euery good thing that was in Italy, that is to ſay, light horſes, rich armour, ſweet, pleaſant and daintie fruites, fine mettals, and may kindes of ointments very odoriſerous, ſilkes, and Marchandiſes of many and diuers ſorts.
                     The Ambaſſadors arriued in Pannony, which now is called Hungarie, were honourably receyued, and the Lumbardes ſeeing that there were ſuch, and ſo many goodly things in Italy, determined to leaue Pannonia, and goe ſpoyle and conquer Italy, although it belonged to Rome, and were at that ſeaſon friends with the Romanes: yet notwithſtanding they had little reſpect to this. And hereat no man ought to maruell, for in that place there is neuer perfect friendſhip, where he that commandeth is conſtrayned to demaund helpe of others.
                     
                     The Lumbards determined for to paſſe into Italy, and at that time there was ſeene of the Italians viſibly in the ayre ſundry Armies of fire, that one cruellie killed the other. Which thing greatly feared the hearts of the people. For by this they knew that Strange ſights ſeene in the ayre. within a ſhort ſpace much of theyr bloud &amp; of their enemies alſo ſhould be ſhed: for it is an olde ancient cuſtome, that when any great matter doth chance to any Realme, firſt the Planets and Elements do declare the ſame by ſecret tokens: the ingratitude of the Emperour Iuſtinian againſt Narſetes his Captaine, and the euill The ingratitude of the Emperour againſt Narſetes. words which Sophia ſpake vnto him, were the occaſion that the Lumhards inuaded and deſtroied all Italy, which thing valiant Princes ought well to note, to keepe themſelues from ingratitude towards their ſeruants, who hath done them great ſeruice. For it is a generall rule, That the ingratitude of a great benefite maketh the ſeruants deſpayre of recempence, or of a faithfull jeruant, maketh him become a 
                        A good obſeruation. 
                        cruell and mortall enemie. And let not Princes truſt men, becauſe they bee natiue of their realms, brought vp &amp; nouriſhed in their Pallaces, and alwayes haue been faithfull in their ſeruices, that therefore they will not of good ſubiects be turned to euill, nor yet of faithfull become diſloyall. For ſuch imagination is vaine. For the Prince that in his doings is vnthankfull, cannot keepe nor retaine any honeſt man long in his ſeruice. One thing the noble Iuſtintan did with Narſetes, whereof all noble and ſage Princes ought to beware, that is to know, hee did not onely giue eare vnto his enemies, and beleeued them: but alſo before them he did diſhonour him, and ſhame him to his power, which thing made him vtterly to deſpayre. For there is nothing that ſpiteth a man more then to haue before his enemies any iniury or diſhonour done vnto him of his ſuperiour.
                     The Empreſſe Sophia therefore deſerued great reproach for ſpeaking ſuch diſhoneſt words to Narſetes, to ſend him to thread the needles in that occupation where the damſels wrought. For it is the duety of a Noble Princeſſe to mitigate the yre of Princes when they are angry, and not to prouoke thē further to anger.

                        Narſetes then alwayes doubting the Empreſſe Sophia, neuer after returned into Naples, where ſhee was, but rather came from Naples to Rome, a yeare before the Lambards came into Italy, where hee receyued all the Sacraments, and like a deuout Chriſtian hee dyed.
                     His body was carried to Alexandria 
                        
                           
                              〈…〉
                           . in a coſſin of ſiluer, all ſet with precious ſtones, and there was buried. And a man cannot tell whether the diſpleaſure were greater that all Aſia had not to ſee Narſetes aliue, or the pleaſure that Sophia had to ſee him dead. For the vnpatient heart, eſpecially of a woman, hath no reſt, vntill ſhee ſee her enemie dead.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XVII. Of a Letter the Emperour Marcus Aurelius ſent to the King of Sicilie, in which he recordeth the trauels they endured together in their youth, and reproueth him of his ſmall reuerence towards the Temples.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArcus Aurelius ſole Emperour of Rome 
                        Marcus. Aurelius ſpeech to Gorbon. borne in Mount Celio, called the old Tribune, wiſheth health and long life to thee Gorbin, Lord and King of Sicilie. As it is the cuſtome of the Romane Emperours, the firſt yeare of my raigne I wrote generally to all the Iſle: the ſecond yeare I wrote generally vnto thy Court and Pallace, and at this preſent I write more particularlie to thy perſon. And although that Princes haue great Realmes, yet they ought not therefore to ceaſe to communicate with their olde friendes. Since I tooke my penne to write vnto thee, I ſtayed my hand a great while from writing, and it was not for that I was ſlothfull, but becauſe I was aſhamed to ſee all Rome offended with thee: I let thee to know, moſt excellent Prince, that in this I ſay, I am thy true friend; for in my hart I feele thy trouble, and ſo ſayd Euripides, That which with the heart is loued, with the heart is lamented.
                     
                     But before I ſhew thee the cauſe of my writing, I will reduce into thy memory ſome thinges paſt of our youth, and thereby we ſhall ſee what wee were then, and what we are now: for no man doth ſo much reioyce of his proſperity preſent, as hee which calleth to mind his miſeries paſt.
                     Thou ſhalt call to mind, moſt excellent Prince, that wee two together did learne to reade in Capua, and after we ſtudyed a little in Tarentum: and from thence wee went to Rhodes, where I reade Rhethorike, and thou heardeſt Philoſophy. And afterwardes in the end of ten yeares, wee went to the wars of Pannonia, where I gaue my ſelfe to muſicke, for the affections of young men are ſo variable, that dayly they would know ſtrange Realmes and change offices.
                     And in all thoſe iournies with the force of youth, the ſweete company, with the pleaſant communication of Sciences, and with a vaine hope wee did diſſemble our extreame pouerty which was ſo great, that many times and often we deſired not that which many had, but that little which to few abounded.
                     Doeſt thou remember, that when Afflictions incident to all men. wee ſayled by the gulfe Arpin, to goe into Helleſpont, a long and tempeſtuous torment came vpon vs, wherein we were taken of a Pirate, and for our ranſome hee made vs row about nine moneths in a Galley, whereas I cannot tell which was greater, eyther

the want of bread, or the aboundance of ſtripes which wee alwayes endured? Haſt thou forgotten alſo that in the City of Rhodes, when wee were beſieged of Bruerdus, puiſſant King of Epirotes, for the ſpace of fourteene monethes, wee were ten without eating fleſh, ſaue onely two cats, the one which wee ſtole, and the other which wee bought? remember that thou and I (beeing in Tarent) were deſired of our Hoſt to go to the feaſt of the great Goddeſſe Dtana, into the which Temple none could enter that day, but thoſe which were new apparrelled. And to ſay the truth, we determined not to goe thither, thou becauſe thy garments were torne, and I becauſe my ſhoes were broken, and that both the times wee were ſicke in Capua, they neuer cured vs by diet; for our diſeaſes neuer proceeded of exceſſe but of extreame hunger. And oftentimes Retropus the Phyſition, for his pleaſure ſpake to vs, in the Vniuerſity &amp; ſayd: Alas children, you dye not through ſurfetting and much eating. And truely hee ſayde truth, for the Country was ſo deare, and our mony ſo ſcarce, that The miſeries of Marcus Aurelius. wee did neuer eate vntill the time we could endure no longer for famine. Doeſt thou not remember the great famin that was in Capua, for the which cauſe wee were in the war of Alexandria? wherein my fleſh did tremble, remembring the great perils which wee paſſed in the gulfe of Theberinth. What ſnowes at winter, what extreame heate all Summer, what generall famine in the fields, what outragious peſtilence amongſt the people? and worſt of all, what perſecution of ſtrangers, and what euill will we had of ours? remember alſo that in the city of Naples, when wee made our prayer, the Propheteſſe Flauia, ſhee tolde vs what ſhould become of vs, after vvee left our Studies. Shee tolde mee that I ſhould bee an Emperour, and ſayde that thou ſhouldeſt be a King.
                     To the which anſwere wee gaue ſuch credite: that wee tooke it not onely for a mocke, but alſo for a manifeſt iniury. And now I do not maruell, in that then we both maruelled wonderfull much. For enuious fortune practiſed her power more in plucking downe the rich, then in ſetting vp the poore. Beholde (excellent Princes) the great power of the Goddeſſe, the wheele of fortune, and the variety of times: who would haue thought when I had my hands all rough and ſcuruy with rowing in the Galley, that betweene thoſe hands the Scepter of the Romane Empire ſhould haue been put? Who vvould haue thought, when I was ſo ſicke for lacke of meate, that I ſhould euer haue ſurfetted by too much eating? Who vvould haue thought when I could not bee ſatiſfied vvith cattes fleſh, that I ſhould haue then glutted with too much dainty meates? Who vvould haue thought at that time, when I left going into the Temple, becauſe my ſhooes were broken, that another time ſhould come when I ſhould ride triumphing in Chariots, and vpon the ſhoulders of other men? who would haue thought that that which with my eares I heard of the Prophetes in Campagnia, I ſhould ſee heere with my eyes in Rome. O how many did hope (at the time we were in Aſia) to be gouernours of Rome, &amp; Lords of Sicille, which not onely fayled of the honour that they deſired, but alſo obtayned the death, which they neuer feared: for oftentimes it chaunceth to ambitious men, that in their greateſt ruffe, and when they thinke their honour ſpun and wouen, then their eſtate with the webbe of their life in one moment is

broken. If at that time one had demaunded the Tirant Laodicius (aſpiring to the Kingdome of Sicille) and Ruphus Caluus who looked to be Emperour of Rome, what they thought of themſelues: aſſuredly, they would haue ſworne their hope to haue been as certaine, as ours was doubtfull. For it is naturall to proud men, to delight themſelues, and to ſet their whole mind vpon vaine deuiſes. It is a ſtrange thing and worthy of memory, that they hauing the honour in their eyes fayled of it, and wee not thinking thereof in our hearts ſhould obtaine it.
                     But herein fortune ſhewed her might, that ſhee prouided hope for thoſe which looked for leaſt: and deſpayre for others that hoped for moſt, vvhich thing grieued them at the very heart. For no patience can endure to ſee a man obtaine that without trauell, which hee could neuer compaſſe by much labour. I cannot tell if I ſhould ſay, like a ſimple Romane, That thoſe things conſiſt in fortune: or if I ſhould ſay, like a good Philoſopher, That all the Gods doe ordaine them: For in the end, no Fortune nor chaunce can doe any thing without the Gods aſſent.
                     Let the proud and enuious trauell aſmuch as they will, and the ambitious take as much care as they can: All is worth nothing without the helpe of God. I ſay and affirme, that little auayleth humane diligence to attaine to great eſtates, if the Gods bee theyr enemies. Suppoſe that euill Fortune doe ordaine it, or that the God and Gods doe ſuffer it, I ſee thoſe which haue their thoughts high, oftentimes are but of baſe eſtate: and ſo in fine, to come to miſchiefe or extream pouerty, &amp; thoſe that haue their thoghts low, are humble of heart, and for the more part are greatly exalted by fortune. For many oftentimes dreame that they are Lords, and men of great eſtate, which when they are awake, finde themſelues ſlaues to all men.
                     The condition of honour is ſuch, as I neuer read the like: and therfore ſuch as haue to doe with her, ought to take good heed: For her conditions are ſuch, ſhee enquireth for him whom ſhe neuer ſaw, and ſhe runneth after him that flyeth from her, ſhe honoureth him that eſteemeth her not, and ſhe demaundeth him which willeth her not, ſhe giueth to him that requireth her not, and ſhe truſteth him whom ſhe knoweth not.
                     Finally, Honour hath this cuſtome, to forſake him that eſteemeth her: &amp; to remaine with him which little regardeth her. The curious Trauellers aske not what place this, or that is, but doe demand what way they muſt take to leade them to the place they goe. I meane the Princes and Noble men ought not directly to caſt their eyes vpon honour: but in the way of vertue, which bringeth them to honour. For dayly wee ſee many remaine defamed, onely for ſeeking honour: and others alſo exalted and eſteemed for flying from her.
                     O miſerable World, thou knoweſt I know thee well, and that which I The fickle eſtate or the worlde. know of thee is, That thou art a Sepulchre of the dead, a priſon of the liuing, a ſhoppe of vices, a Hangman of vertues, obliuion of antiquity, an enemy of things preſent, a pittefall to the rich, and a burden to the poore, a houſe of Pilgrimes, and a denne of theeues,
                     
                     Finally O World, Thou art a ſlaunderer of the good, a rauenour of the wicked, and a deceyuer and abuſer of all, and in thee O world, to ſpeake the trueth, It is almoſt impoſſible to liue contented, and much leſſe to liue in honour.
                     
                     For if thou wilt giue honour to the good, they thinke themſelues diſhonoured, and eſteeme thy honour as a thing of mockerie. And if perchance

they bee euill and light, thou ſuffereſt them to come often to honour by way of mockery, meaning infamy &amp; diſhonour vnto them.
                     O immortall Gods, I am oftentimes troubled in my thought, whoſe caſe I ſhould more lament, eyther the euill man aduanced without deſert, or the good man ouerthrowne without cauſe. And truely in this caſe, the pitifull man will haue compaſſion on them both. For if the euill liue, hee is ſure to fall, and if the good fal, wee doubt whether euer hee ſhall riſe againe. If all falles were alike all would bee healed and cured him one ſalue: but ſome fall on then feet, ſome on their ſides, others ſtumble, and fall not, and other fall downe right, but ſome do giue them a hand. I meane ſome there are which fall from their eſtate, and loſe no more but their ſubſtance: others fall, and for very ſorrow loſe not onely theyr goods, but their liues withall. Other there are who fall, who neyther loſe their liues nor goods, but their honour onely. So according to the diſcretion of Fortune, the more they haue, the more ſtill he taketh from thee, &amp; I greatly muſe why the Gods doe neuer remedy it: for when Fortune once beginneth to ouerthrow a poor man, ſhee doth not onely take all that hee hath from him, but all thoſe which may and will ſuccour him. So that the poore man is bound more to lament for another mans euil, then for his owne proper. There is a great difference betweene the miſhappe of the good, and aduentures of the Difference betweene the good &amp; the euill. euill. For of the ill we cannot ſay, that he diſcendeth, but that he falleth, and of the good, we may onely ſay, that he diſcendeth and falleth not. For in the end, true honour doth not conſiſt in the perfection and dignity that a man hath, but in the good life that hee leadeth, It is a miſery for to ſee the vaine men of this world, when they goe about to get any thing, and to compaſſe any great matter of importance, to marke their earely riſing in a morning, their late going to bed at night, and the looke which they caſt vpon other men, to note how importunate they are to ſome, and how troubleſome they are to others, and afterward (notwithſtanding their long ſure and great paine) an other man which 
                           •
                        ittle thought thereof, commeth to that honour, reioyſing and without trauell, which he before by ſo great pairs, and with ſo great expences of money hath ſought: ſo that in ſeeking honour by trauell, he commeth to infamy with ſhame. For I my ſelfe haue ſeen ſundry things loſt by negligence, and many moe by too much diligence.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XVIII. The Emperour proceedeth in his letter, to admoniſh Princes to bee fearefull of their Gods, and of the ſentence which the Senate gaue vpon this King, for pulling downe the Church.
                     
                     
                        AL theſe things (moſt excellent Prince) I haue tolde thee, and for none other cauſe but to aggrauate this caſe, and to ſhew the perill thereof. For the good Phiſitian (to take away the bitterneſſe of the pille) miniſtreth ſome ſweete ſugar to delight the Patient withall. The 20. day of the moneth of Ianuary (here before the Senate) was preſented a long and large information of thee, and it was ſent by the Conſull, which went to viſite that Iſle of Cicilla, which as thou knoweſt is an old order of Rome, from

three moneths to three moneths, to viſite all the Land and Countrey ſubiect to the ſame. For thoſe Princes are vniuſt, which haue more care to take vp their Rentes, then diligence to knowe if theyr people bee well ordered by Iuſtice. Of the information taken of thee and thy perſon (if my memorie deceyue me not) this was the effect: That thou art temperate in eating, moderate in expences: pittifull to Widdowes, Father to Orphanes gentle to thoſe that ſerue thee, patient with thoſe that offend thee, diligent to keepe and maintaine peace, and faithfull, to obſerue league, and thou art accuſed onely to bee negligent in the ſeruice of God.
                     
                     By one little Gate left open, oftentimes a great Citie beſieged is loſt: by one onely treaſon, the infinite ſeruices paſt are not eſteemed. I meane (moſt excellent Prince) that it little preuayleth to thinke much of worldly matters, and to forget all diuine ſeruices. For the good Prince ought firſt to ſhut the gate againſt vices, that they enter not into his ſubiects, before he doth fortifie the walles againſt his enemies.
                     Let euery man bee as hee will, and ſay what hee liſt, I for my part, thinke it ſure, That the man which is 
                        The d

                        not a ſtudious ſeruer of the Gods, all his vertues ſhall be turned into vices, ànd eſteemed as ſlaunders.
                     
                     For it it is a generall rule in high Philoſophie, That a worke is not called vertuous, becauſe I worke it onely, but it is vertuous, becauſe it is acceptable to the Gods,
                     
                     Oh excellent Prince, doeſt not thou know that there is no man ſo wiſe, neither ſo ſage, but erreth more through ignorance, then he doth good by wiſdome? And doſt not thou know that there is no man ſo iuſt, but wanteth much to execute true iuſtice? And finally (I ſay,) that there is no vertue ſo vertuous, but it wanteth more then it hath, to be perfite. Wherfore all our Iuſtice ought to be made perfit to the diuine Iuſtice: and the vertue which we lacke, ought to be ſupplyed vnder the great perfection, wherewith the Gods abound.
                     And therefore amongſt vs Romains we haue this law, (which is the chiefe of all the Philoſophers) That here amongſt mortall men, nor of mortall men, nor with mortall men, any thing is perfite, vnleſſe it bee by the Gods confirmed.
                     
                     Since men are feeble and frayle, it can not bee choſen but they ſhould commit many frailtyes. And in ſuch caſe the ſage Princes ought &amp; ſhould beare with all the fraylties that men commit: Thoſe excepted which are not iniurious to the Gods, whom (if it were poſſible,) vnwares ought to be puniſhed. For the Prince ſhould not be called a Prince, but a Tyrant, that is deſirous to reuenge his owne iniurie, and in chaſtening thoſe which are againſt the Gods, ſheweth himſelfe negligent.
                     Let them thinke what they liſt, and The difference betweene a good prince and a Tyrant. complaine what they will, that Prince which will enlarge his dominions, and giue occaſion that the ſeruice of God be diminiſhed: ſuch a man we wil not call a king that gouerneth, but a tirant:
                     If wee call him a Tyrant that ſpoyleth the people, ſleeth the men, perſecuteth the innocent, diſhonoureth Virgines, and robbeth Realmes.
                     Tell mee (moſt excellent Prince,) What lacketh hee of a Tyrant, that plucketh downe Churches, and little eſteemeth the Gods: There is no token more manifeſt, that the Prince is a Tyrant, then when hee taketh vpon him any thing which is diſtaſtfull, or any way contrarie to the will of the Gods. For he hath but ſmall regard towardes men, that ſo little feare the Gods.
                     
                        Lycurgus that moſt famous King of the Lacedemonians, ſaith in one

of his ancient lawes theſe words. Wee ordaine and commaund that no Lacedemonian preſume to receyue mercy or fauour of the Prince, which will not enforce himſelfe to ſerue the Gods. For he is not onely euill, but of all other moſt wicked. O excellent King, O glorious World, O fortunate Realme, wherein thoſe Ancients would their Prince ſhould bee ſo iuſt, that the gifts were not eſteemed, vnleſſe their liues were honeſt: for they thought that of no value which by the handes of euil men was giuē. Thou haſt done one thing very diſhoneſt (moſt noble Prince) the which to write vnto thee, I am aſhamed, which is, for to enlarge thy new Palace, thou haſt plucked down an old Temple, the which thing thou ſhouldeſt neyther haue done, nor yet haue thought: for in the end, though the ſtones of the Temple be of ſmall importance, yet the Gods to whom they were dedicated were of much value. Pardon me (excellent Prince) though I et thee vnderſtand that this fact hath beene done in ſuch ſort, that thereby I was amaſed, and all Rome alſo offended, the ſacred Senate thou haſt greatly vexed, and further, all iudge thee a diſſolute man, and all men procure that thou mayſt be extreamly puniſhed, and hereof maruell not: For in Rome they beleeue, that the Prince which dareth plucke downe Hee that violateth the Temple feareth not God. Temples, doth little feare the Gods. For that thou art a noble Prince, and an olde friend of mine, I haue trauelled to bring thee in fauour with the Senate, and becauſe thou haſt no means to excuſe thy errour committed, they doe not determine to forgiue thee this fault, before they ſee in thee a token of amendment. And of truth me thinketh they haue reaſon: For there is nothing that troubleth poore men more, then to ſee that they, and not the rich for theyr offences are chaſtiſed and puniſhed: That which the ſacred Senate hath ordayned is, that forthwith thou begin to build the Temple a new, and that it ſhould be more large, hie, beutifull, and richer then euer it was. So that thou take as much of thy Pallace to enlarge the Temple, as thou tookeſt of the Temple to beautifie thy Pallace. After thou haſt performed this, though now thou thinke thy ſelfe halfe diſhonoured, thou wilt then thinke thy ſelfe very happy. For not thou of the Gods, but the Gods of thee ſhall haue taken thy houſe to make their Temple. I beleeue well it will be great coſt and charges vnto thee before thou haſt finiſhed the Temple: Wherefore I ſend thee 40. thouſand ſexterces to helpe thy building, &amp; to the end it ſhould be more ſecret, I ſend thee them by my Secretary Panuntius, to whom, in all, and for all, thou ſhalt giue credite. I ſend thee likewiſe a coller of gold, which one brought me from the riuer of Nyle, and becauſe it was too narrow for mee, I ſuppoſe it will be fit for thee, one hath brought me moyles out of Spaine, whereof I ſend thee two. Panuntius my Secretary bringeth with him a very good Moyle, the which hee eſteemeth much: ſo that there is no man that can eyther buy her, or borrow her. I delight in her ſo much that I deſire thou cauſe her eyther to be bought or ſtollen, and ſent vnto mee here in Rome,

                        THe ancient Romane Hiſtoriographers agree, that at the beginning there were ſeuen Kinges, which gouerned Rome for the ſpace of 24. yeares. The ſecond whereof was named Pompilius, who amongſt all the other was moſt highly eſteemed, for none other cauſe, but for that hee was a great worſhipper of the Gods, and a ſumptuous builder of the Temples. For the Romane Princes were as much beloued for ſeruing the Gods, as they were honoured for vanquiſhing their enemies. This mā was of ſuch ſort, that he allowed Rome wholy for the Gods, &amp; made a houſe for himſelfe without the City. For it was an ancient Law in Rome that no An ancient 
                              〈…〉
                           . man ſhould bee ſo bolde to dwell in any houſe conſecrated for the gods.
                     The fift King of the Romanes was Tarquinius Priſcus. And as Tarquinius Superbus was vicious and abhorred of the people, ſo was this vertuous, and welbeloued of the Gods, &amp; was greatly prayſed in all his doings, becauſe hee feared God, and continually viſited the Temples, and not contented with thoſe which were finiſhed, but built alſo in the High Capitoll the ſacred Temple of Iupiter: For no Prince could build any houſe in Rome for himſelfe, vnleſſe firſt hee made a Temple for the Gods of the Common-wealth.
                     This Temple was had in ſo great reuerence, that as the Romanes honored Iupiter for the God aboue all other Gods, ſo was that Temple eſteemed aboue all other Temples. In the warres betweene the

                        The vow of Marcus Camillus. who though he were ſtout and hardy, yet before he went to the wars, he offered great ſacrifices to the Gods, and made a vow that if hee returned to Rome victorious, hee would build a ſolemne Temple. For it was the cuſtome in Rome, that immediately when the Romane Captaine would enterpriſe to doe any notable thing, he ſhould make a vow to build Temples. Now when Camillus returned afterwards victorious, hee did not onely build a Temple, but alſo furniſhed it with all manner of implements thereunto belonging, which he got by ſpoyle, and vanquiſhing his enemies. And ſith he was for this reprehended of ſome, ſaying that the Romane Captaines ſhould offer theyr hearts to the Gods, and diuide the Treaſures among the Souldiers: hee anſwered theſe words. I like a man did aske the Gods but one triumph: and they like Gods did giue mee many: Therefore conſidering this, it is but iuſt, ſ

that they gaue me double, in reſpect of that I demaunded: ſo likewiſe ſhall they eſteeme that which I doe giue, in reſpect of that which I promiſed. At that time when the cruell war was betwixt Rome, and the City of Neye, the Romanes kept it beſieged 5. yeares together, and in the end by policie tooke it. For it chaunceth ſundrie times in warre, that that City in ſhort time by policie is won, which by great ſtrength a long time hath been defended.
                     
                        Marcus Furius, Dictator of Rome, and at that time Captaine, commanded a Proclamation to be had throgh his Hoſt, that incontinently after the City was taken, none ſhould be ſo hardy as to kill any of the Citizens, but thoſe which were found armed. Which thing the enemies vnderſtanding, vnarmed themſelues, and ſo eſcaped.
                     And truly this example was worthy of nothing: For as the Captaines ought to ſhew themſelues fierce and cruell 
                        The duetie of euery good Captaine. 
                        at the beginning: ſo after the victorie had of their enemies, they ſhould ſhew themſelues meeke and pittifull.
                     
                     This Dictator Camillus, for an other thing hee did, was much commended aboue the reſidue. That is to ſay, hee did not onely not conſent to robbe the Temples. nor diſhonour the Gods; but hee himſelfe with great reuerence tooke the ſacred veſſels of the Temples, and the Gods which were therein, (eſpecially the Goddeſſe Iuno) and brought them all to Rome. For amongſt the Auncients there was a Law, that the Gods of them which were vanquiſhed, ſhould not come by lot to the Captaines being Conquerours: therfore hee made in the Mount Auentino a ſumptuous Temple, wherein hee placed all the Gods together, with all the holy Reliques which hee wanne. For the greater Triumph the Romans had ouer their enemies, ſo much the better they handled the Gods of the people vanquiſhed. Alſo you ought to know, that the Romaines after many victories, determined to make a crowne of golde very great &amp; rich, and to offer it to the God Apollo: but ſith the common Treaſure was poor, (becauſe there was but little ſiluer, and leſſe golde to make that crowne) The Romane Matrons defaced theyr Iewels and ouches of golde and ſiluer, to make the Crowne there withall. For in Rome there neuer wanted money (if it were demanded) for the ſeruice of Gods to repayre Temples, or to redeeme Captiues. The Senate eſteemed the well willing hearts of theſe women in ſuch ſort, that they graunted them three things: that is ſay, To weare on their heades Garlands of flowers, to goe in Chariots to the common places, and to goe 
                        The reward of well doing. 
                        openly to the feaſts of the Gods. For the auncient Romanes were ſo honeſt, that they neuer ware gold on theyr heades, neyther went they at any time to the feaſts vncouered.
                     A man ought not to maruell that the Romanes granted ſuch priuiledges vnto the ancient Matrones of Rome: For they vſed neuer to bee obliuious of any benefite receyued, but rather gentle, with thanks and rewards to recompence the ſame.
                     An other notable thing chanced in Rome, which was, that the Romanes ſent two Tribunes, the which were called Caulius and Sergius, into the Iſle of Delphos with greate preſents to offer vnto the God Apollo. For as Titus Liuius ſayeth, Rome yeerely ſent a preſent vnto the God Apollo, and Apollo gaue vnto the Romanes counſell. And as the Tribunes went out of the way, they fell into the hands of pirates and rouers on the ſea, which tooke them with their treaſures, and brought

them to the Cittie of Liparie. But the citizens vnderſtanding that thoſe preſents The 
                              〈…〉
                            into the hands of Pylates. were conſecrated to the God Apollo, did not onely deliuer them all their Treaſure againe: but alſo gaue them much more, &amp; guides therewith to conduct them ſafely, (both going and comming) from all peril and danger.
                     The Romaines beeing aduertiſed of theyr genlteneſſe, by the meſſengers, which were come ſafe and aliue, did ſo much reioyce, that they ordayned in Rome, that the Nobles of Liparie ſhould bee made Senatours of Rome, and all the others ſhould be confederates and of aliance vnto them. And they cauſed further that two prieſts of Liparie ſhould alwayes remaine in the Temple of Iupiter, which priuiledge was neuer granted to any other ſtrangers but to them onely. For the Romanes had ſo great zeale, and loue to their Gods, that in the ſeruices of the temples, they truſted none, but thoſe The great zeale of the Romains. which were natiue &amp; ancient of Rome, and alſo were both wiſe and vertuous.
                     When Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were in the warres againſt the Samnites and Tuſcanes, and likewiſe againſt the Vmbres, manie maruellous and terrible ſignes were ſeene in Rome, which things did not only feare thoſe that ſawe them, but alſo thoſe which heard of them. Vpon which occaſion the Romaines and the Romane Matrones (both night and day,) offered great ſacrifices to the gods. For they ſayd, if we can pacifie the wrath of the Gods in Rome, we ſhall neuer need to feare our enemies in the field.
                     The thing was this, that as the Romane Matrons went viſiting the temples, to appeaſe the ire of the Gods, many ſenators wiues came to the temple of chaſtitie, to offer ſacrifice. For in the time of the puiſſant power of the Romanes, the Women did ſacrifice in the temples of the Gods.
                     At that time Virginea, the daughter of Aureus Virgineus, the Conſul Plebeian, the which was forbidden to doe ſacrifice, for that ſhee was none of the Senators wiues, but a Plebeian; as The difference of women in Rome. much to ſay, as a Crafts-woman, and no Gentlemans-Daughter borne. For the Noblewomen were had in ſo great veneration, and ſo highly eſteemed, that all the other ſeemed (in reſpect of them) but hand-maydes and ſlaues.
                     The noble Romane Virginea, ſeeing her to be ſo repulſed and diſdained of the other matrones, made of her own houſe a temple, to the Goddeſſe of Chaſtitie, and with much deuotion and reuerence honoured her. The which thing being publiſhed abroade throughout Rome, manie other women came thither, to doe Sacrifice likewiſe. For Fortune is ſo variable, that oftentimes thoſe which of pride haue forbidden vs theyr houſes, come after by humilitie, to doe vs ſeruice at ours.
                     For this cauſe, this Virginea the Foundreſſe was ſo greatly prayſed, that the Romaines in her life made her Patrice, (that is, a Noble Romane) and after her death cauſed her Image and ſtatue to be made and ſet vp in the high Capitoll: and about this Image were ingrauen certain Greeke characters, the effect whereof was this.
                     PATRICE the great this Image doth preſent,
                     That in her life, did giue with minde deuout
                     The Gods her houſe, &amp; therefore to them went
                     When liuely breath, by death was chaſed out.
                     Of all theſe Hyſtories aboue-named, Titus Liuius, lib: 2. 5. and 9. 
                        Titus Liuius maketh mention, in his firſt Decade: the ſecond, fifth, and ninth book, and though he declareth them more at large, yet this ſhall ſuffice for my purpoſe, I haue ſought amongſt the Gentiles theſe fewe Examples, to reprooue Chriſtian Princes; Onely to the ende they might ſee
                        
                        how ſtudious and ſeruent our Fathers were in the ſeruice of their Idols, &amp; contrariwiſe how cold and negligent we are to honour and ſerue our true and liuing God.
                     
                     It is a ſhame to tell how the ancient Romanes with all their hearts, did ſerue the Gods without any vnderſtanding, and how thoſe which are Difference betweene the true God and the falſe. Chriſtians (for the moſt part) ſerue the true God, not in truth, but with hypocriſie and diſſimulation. For the children of this World will take no paines, but for to prouoke the pleaſures of the body.
                     Many wondred for what occaſion God did ſo much for them, and they did nothing for God? To this may bee anſwered, that if they had known one true God, all the ſacrifices they had done to their other Gods, they would haue done to him onely, and as God is iuſt, ſo hee rewarded them in their temporall proſperities, Not for that they did well but for that they deſired to doe well. For in our diuine Law, God doth not regard what wee are, but what wee deſire to hee.
                     
                     Chriſtian Princes maruell much what the occaſiō ſhould be, that they are not ſo fortunate as the Gentiles were. To this may bee aunſwered, that eyther they bee good or euill. If they bee good, truly God ſhould do them wrong, if for the payment of their faithfull ſeruices, hee ſhould recompence them with theſe worldly vanities: For without doubt, one onely louing countenance of God in the world to come, is more worth then all the temporall goods of this world preſent. But if theſe ſuch great Lords bee euill in their perſons, ambitions in gouerning their Dominions, not pittifull to widdowes and father leſſe, not fearefull of God, nor of his threatnings, and moreouer, neuer to haue mind to ſerue him, but onely when they ſee themſelues in ſome great ieopardy, in ſuch caſe God will not heare them, and much leſſe fauour them. For without doubt The ſeruice is more acceptable, which of free will proceedeth, then that which of neceſſity is offered.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XX. For fiue cauſes Princes ought to be better Chriſtians then their Subiects.
                     
                     
                        IN mine opinion, Princes ought, and are bound to bee vertuous for fiue cauſes. I ſay vertuous, Princes ought to excell their Subiects. in that they ſhould loue, &amp; fear God: for hee onely may bee called vertuous, which in the Catholike Faith of the Church, and in the feare of God hath alwayes remayned conſtant. Firſt Princes ſhould feare, loue, ſerue, and loue one only God whom they worſhip, for that they acknowledge him onely, and none other to bee the head both of heauen &amp; earth. For in the end, there is nothing ſo puiſſant but it is ſubiect to the diuine power.
                     And truely that Prince is in great perill of damnation of his ſoule, if in his gouernement he hath not alwayes before his eyes the feare and loue of the ſupreame Prince, to whom wee muſt render of all our doings an account.
                     For the Prince hath great occaſion to bee vicious, thinking that for the vice hee ſhall not be chaſtiſed. I haue read in diuers and ſundry writings, and I neuer found one ancient Prince to bee contented with one onely God, but that they had and ſerued many Gods. Iulius Caeſar carriedfiue

Gods painted in a Table, and Scipio the great carried ſeuen purtraied in mettall.
                     And furthermore, they were not contented to haue many: but yet in ſacrifices and ſeruices, they offered vnto them all. The Chriſtian Princes which keepe and haue but one very true and omnipotent God, are ſo vnthankefull, that they thinke it much to ſerue and giue acceptable ſeruice vnto him. And though peraduenture ſome ſay, that it is more painefull to ſerue one true God, then all theſe falſe Gods. To this I aunſwere, That to ſerue them it is both trauell and paine: but to ſerue our God, it is both ioy and felicity. For in ſeruing thoſe, it is coſtly, and without profite: and in ſeruing God great What pleaſure it is to ſerue the liuing God. profite enſueth. For thoſe Gods require great and rich ſacrifices, and our God demaundeth nothing but pure and cleane hearts.
                     Secondarily, Princes ſhould be better chriſtians then others, becauſe they haue more to looſe then al: And hee that hath more to loſe then any other, ought aboue all other to ſerue God: For euen as hee alone can giue him, ſo likewiſe hee alone, and none other can take from him. And if a Subiect take any thing from his neighbour, the Prince whome hee ſerueth, maketh him render it again: but if the Prince bee iniuried with any other Tyrant, hee hath none to complaine vnto, nor to demaunde helpe of, but onely of his mercifull God: For in the end, one that is of power cannot bee hurt, but by an other which is likewiſe mighty. Let Princes behold how the man that will make any great aſſault, firſt hee commeth running a farre of as faſt as he can. I meane, that the Prince which will haue God mercifull vnto him, ought to bee content with his onely God. For he in vaine demandeth helpe of him, to whom before he neuer did ſeruice.
                     Thirdly, Princes ought to be better Chriſtians then others, and this ſhall bee ſeene by that they ſuccour What is required in a good Prince the poore, prouide for thoſe that are vnprouided, and viſite the Temples, Hoſpitals and Churches, and endeanour themſelues to heare the Diuine Seruice, and for all theſe things they ſhall not onely receiue rewards, but alſo they ſhall receyue honour. For through their good example, others will doe the ſame. Princes not fearing God; nor his commandements, cauſe their Realmes and Subiects to fall into great miſery: for if fountains bee infected, it is vnpoſſible for the ſtreames (that iſſue thereof to bee pure, We ſee by experience that a Bridle maſtereth a horſe and a ſterne ruleth a ſhippe. I weane, that a Prince (good or bad) will leade after him all the whole Realme. And if he honor God, all the people do likewiſe, if hee ſerue God, the people alſo ſerue him, if he prayſe God, the Subiects alſo prayſe him, &amp; if he blaſpheme God, they likewiſe will doe the ſame. For it is vnpoſſible that a Tree ſhoulde bring forth other leaus or fruits, then thoſe which are agreeable to the humour that are in the roots. Princes aboue all other Creatures haue this preheminence, that if they bee good chriſtians, they ſhall not only receiue merite, for their own works, but alſo Like Prince like people. for all thoſe which others ſhall doe, becauſe they are occaſion that the people worke well. And for the contrary, they ſhall not only be puniſhed for the euill which they ſhall do, but alſo for the euill which by occaſion of their euill examples others ſhal commit. O Princes that now liue, how do I wiſh that ye ſhould ſpeake with ſome one of thoſe Princes which now are dead, eſpecially with thoſe that are condemned to eternal flames, thē yee

ſhould ſee that the greateſt torments which they ſuffer, are not for the euils that they did commit, but for the euils which through their occaſion were done: for oftentimes Princes and Prelates ſinne more, becauſe they diſſembled with others, then for that they do commit themſelues. O How circumſpect Princes ought to be. how circumſpect ought Princes and great Lords to be in that they ſpeake, and how diligently ought they to examine that they doe: for they ſerue not God onely for themſelues, but they ſerue him alſo generally for their ſubiects.
                     And contrariwiſe Princes are not onely puniſhed for their owne offences, but alſo for the ſinnes of theyr people: for the ſhepheard ought grieuouſly to bee puniſhed, when by negligence the rauening Wolfe deuoureth the innocent Lambe.
                     Fourthly, Princes ought to bee better Chriſtians then others becauſe that to God onely they muſt render account of their eſtates; for as much God onely is iuſt. as we are ſure that God, to whom we muſt render account is iuſt, ſo much the more we ſhould trauell to bee in his fauour, becauſe whether hee find or not find in our life any fault, yet for loue and pitty ſake hee may correct vs.
                     Men one with another make theyr accounts in this life, becauſe they are men, and in the end count they well or euill, all paſſeth amongſt men: becauſe they are men: but what ſhall the vnhappy Princes doe, which ſhall render no account but to God onely, who will not bee deceiued with words, corrupted with gifts, feared with threatnings, nor anſwered with excuſes.
                     Princes haue their Realms full of cruell Iudges, to puniſh the frailetic of man: they haue their courts full of Aduocates to plead againſt them that haue offended: they haue their Pallaces 
                           〈…〉
                         and Promoters, that note the offences of other men: They haue through all theyr Prouince, Auditours, that ouerſee the accounts of their routs, and beſides all this, they haue no remembrance of the day ſo ſtrict, wherein they muſt render an account of their wicked life.
                     Me thinkes (ſince all that which Princes receyue commeth from the hands of God) that the greateſt part of the time which they ſpend, ſhould bee in the ſeruice of God, and al their What vertue 
                              〈…〉
                            to bee in a good prince trade in God, and they ought to render no account of their life but vnto God: then ſith they are Gods in authority which they haue ouer temporall things they ought to ſhew themſelues to reſemble God more then others by vertues, For that Prince is more to be magnified which reformeth two vices among his people, then hee which conquereth ten Realmes of his enemies. But we wil deſire them from henceforth, They preſume not any more to bee Gods on the earth, but that they endeuour themſelues to bee good Chriſtians in the Commonwealth: For all the wealth of a Prince is, That hee bee ſtout with ſtrangers, and louing to his owne Subiects.
                     
                     Fiftly, Princes ought to bee better Chriſtians then others, For, the proſperity or aduerſity that chanceth vnto them, commeth directly from the hands of God onely, and none other: I haue ſeene ſundry times princes, which haue put their whole truſt and confidence in other Princes, to be on a ſodaine diſcomfited: and for the contrary, thoſe which haue litle hope in men, and great confidence in God haue alwayes proſpered, When man is in his chiefeſt brauery, and truſteth moſt to mens wiſedome, then the ſecret iudgement of God ſooneſt diſcomforteth him. I meane, that the conſederates

                        
and friends of Princes, might helpe and ſuccour them, but God will not ſuffer them to be holpen nor ſuccoured, to the ende they ſhould ſee their remedy proceedeth not by mans diligence, but by diuine prouidence. A Prince that hath a Realme, doth not ſuffer any thing to bee done therein without his aduice: therefore ſince God is of no leſſe power in Heauen, then Princes are on the earth: it is reaſon that nothing bee done without his conſent, ſince he taketh account God the beginner &amp; ender of all things. of all mens deedes, and as hee is the end of all things, ſo in him, and by him all things haue their beginning.
                     
                        O Princes, If you knew how ſmall a thing it is to bee hated of men, and how great a comfort to be beloued of GOD, I ſweare, that you would not ſpeake one word (althogh it were in ieſt) vnto men, neyther would you ceaſe, night nor day, to commend your ſelues vnto God: for God is more mercifull to ſuccour vs, then wee are diligent for to call vpon him.
                     
                     For in concluſion, the fauour which men can giue you, other men can take from you: but the fauour that God will giue you, no man can reſiſt it. All thoſe that poſſeſſe much God the giuer of all things. ſhould vſe the company of them which can doe much: and if it bee ſo, I let you Princes know, that all men cannot thinke ſo much together as God is able to doe alone: For the crye of a Lyon is more fearefull then the howling of a Wolfe. I confeſſe, that Princes and great Lords may ſometimes gaine, and winne of them ſelues: but I aske them whoſe fauour they haue neede of to preſerue and keepe them: we ſee oftentimes that in a ſhort ſpace many come to great authority, the which neyther mans wiſedome ſufficeth to gouerne, nor yet mans force to keepe. For the authority which the Romanes in ſixe hundred yeares gained, fighting againſt the Gothes, in the ſpace of three yeares they loſt. Wee ſee daily by experience, that a man for the gouernment of his owne houſe onely, needeth the counſell of his friends and neighbours: and doe Princes and great Lords thinke by their own heades onely, to rule and gouerne many realmes and dominions.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXI. What the Philoſopher Bias was: of his conſtancy when hee loſt all his goods, and of the ten lawes hee gaue, worthy to bee had in memory.
                     
                     
                        AMong all nations, &amp; ſorts of men, which auaunt themſelues to haue had with them ſage men, the Grecians were the chiefeſt, which had and thought it neceſſary to haue, not onely wiſe men to reade in theyr ſchooles: but alſo they choſe them to bee Princes in their dominions. For as Plato ſayeth, Thoſe which gouerned in thoſe dates were Philoſophers or elſe they ſayde, and did like Philoſohers.
                     
                     And Laertius writeth in his ſecond booke, De antiquitatibus Graecorum 
                        Laert. de antiq. Graec. That the Grecians auaunted themſelues much in this, that they had of all Eſtates perſons moſt notable, that is to ſay, Seuen women very ſage, ſeuen Queenes very honeſt, ſeuen Kings very vertuous, ſeuen Captaines very hardy, ſeuen Cities very notable, ſeuen buildings very ſumptuous, and ſeuen Philoſophers, very well Learned, which Philoſophers, were theſe that follow.
                     
                        
The firſt was Tales Mileſius, that inuented the Carde to ſayle by.
                     The ſecond was Solon, that gaue the firſt lawes to the Athenians.
                     
                     The third was Chilo, who was in the Orient for Ambaſſadour of the Athenians.
                     
                     The fourth was Pittacus Quintilenus, who was not onely a Philoſopher, but alſo Captaine of the Mitilenes.
                     
                     The fifth was Cleobolus, that diſcended from the ancient lynage of Hercules.
                     
                     The ſixt was Periander, that long time gouerned the realme of Corinth.
                     
                     The ſeuenth was Bias Prieneus, that was Prince of the Prieneans.
                     
                     Therefore as touching Bias, you muſt vnderſtand, that when Romulus raigned at Rome, and Ezechias in Iudea, there was great warres in Grecia betweene the Metinences, and the Prieneans: and of theſe Prieneans, Bias the Philoſopher was Prince and The wiſdome of Bias the Philoſopher Captaine, who becauſe hee was ſage, read in the Vniuerſity, and for that hee was hardy, was Chiefetain in the warre: and becauſe hee was wiſe, he was made a Prince, and gouerned the Common-wealth. And of this no man ought to maruell: for in thoſe daies the Philoſopher that had knowledge but in one thing, was little eſteemed in the Common-wealth. After many contentions had betweene the Metinenſes and Prienenſes, a cruel battell was fought, whereof the Philoſopher Bias was Captaine, and had the victory, and it was the firſt battell that euer any Philoſopher gaue in Greece. For the which victory Greece was proud to ſee their Philoſophers ſo aduenturous in wars, and hardy of their hands, as they were profound in their doctrine, and eloquent in their tongues.
                     And by chance one brought him a number of women, and maides to ſell, or if hee liſted to vſe them otherwiſe at his pleaſure: but this good Philoſopher, did not defile them nor ſell them, but cauſed them to bee apparrelled, and ſafely to bee conducted to their owne natiue Countries. And let not this liberty that he did, be had in litle eſtimation to deliuer the captiues, and not to defloure the virgins. For many times it chaunceth, that thoſe which are ouercome with the weapons of the Conquerours, are conquered with the delights of them that are ouercome. This deede amongſt the Greekes was ſo highly commended, and likewiſe of their enemies ſo prayſed, that immediatly the Metinences ſent Ambaſſadors to demaund peace of the Prienenſes.
                     
                     And they concluded together a perpetuall peace vpon condition, that they ſhould make for Bias an Bias the occaſion of peace. immortall Statue, ſith by his hands, and alſo by his vertues, hee was the occaſion of the peace, and ending of the wars betweene them. And truely they had reaſon, for hee deſerueth more prayſe which winneth the hearts of the enemies in his tents by good example: then hee which getteth the victory in the field by ſhedding of bloud.
                     The hearts of men are noble, and wee ſee dayly, That oftentimes one ſhal ſooner ouercome many by good, then many ouercome one by euill: And alſo they ſay that the Emperour Seuerus ſpake theſe words. By goodneſſe the leaſt ſlaue in Rome ſhall leade mee tyed with a hayre whether hee will: but by euill the moſt puiſſant man in the world cannot moue mee out of Italy For my heart had rather bee ſeruant to the good, then Lord to the euill.
                     
                        Valerius Maximus declareth, that when the City of Priene was taken by enemies, and put to ſacke the wife of Bias was ſlaine, his children taken

priſoners his goods robbed, the City beaten downe, and his houſe ſet on fire, but Bias eſcaped ſafe, and went to Athens.
                     
                     In this pittifull caſe the good Philoſopher Bias was no whit the ſadder, but rather ſang as he went by the way, and when hee perceyued that men maruelled at his mirth, hee ſpake vnto them theſe words. Thoſe which ſpeake of mee for wanting my City, my wife, and my children, and looſing all that I had, truely ſuch know not what Fortune meaneth, nor vnderſtand what Philoſophie is.
                     
                     The loſſe of children and temporall goods, cannot bee called loſſe, if the life bee ſaued, and the renowne remaine vndefiled. Whether this ſentēce be true or no, let vs profoundly conſider, if the iuſt God ſuffer that this City ſhould come into the hands of the cruell Tyrants, then this prouiſion is iuſt: For, There is nothing more conformable vnto Iuſtice, then that thoſe which receiue not the Doctrine of the Sages, ſhould ſuffer the crueltite of the Tirants.
                     
                     
                        Alſo though my enemies haue killed my wife, yet I am ſure it was not without the determination of the Gods, who after they had created her body, immediately appointed the end of her life.
                     
                     
                        Therfore why ſhuld I bewayle her death, ſince the Gods haue lent her life, vntill this day? The great eſtimation that we haue of this life, cauſeth that death ſeemeth vnto vs ſodayne, and that the life vnwares with death is ouertaken: but theſe are words of the children of vanitie, for that by the will of the Gods, death viſiteth vs, and againſt the willes of men, life for ſaketh vs. Alſo my Children bee vertuous Philoſophers, and albeit they be now in the hands of tirants, we ought not therefore to call them captiues, for a man may not call him a captiue which is laden with yrons, but him which is ouerwhelmed with vices. And although the fire haue burnt my houſe, yet I know not why I ought to be ſad: for of truth it was now olde, and the winde did blowe downe, he tiles, the wormes did waſte the wood, and the waters that ranne downe periſhed the walles, and it was olde and like to fall, and perchaunce would haue done greater diſpleaſure. For moſt commonly enuie, malice, and old houſes ſuddenly without any warning or knocking at the dore, aſſaulteth men▪ Finally, there came the fire which quited mee of many troubles: Firſt, of the trouble that I ſhould haue had in repayring 
                              •
                           : Secondarily, it ſaued mee money in plucking it downe. Thirdly, it ſaued me and mune heyres frō much coſt and many daungers. For ofentimes that which a man conſumeth in repayring an old houſe, would with aduantage buy him a new. Alſo thoſe which ſay that for the taking away of my goods, I lacke the goods of Fortune; ſuch haue no reaſon ſo thinke or ſay: for fortune neuer giueth temporall goods for a proper thing, but to thoſe whom ſhee liſt, &amp; when ſhee will diſpoſe them: therefore when Fortune ſeeth that thoſe më whom ſhee hath appointed as her diſtributers, do hoarde vp the ſame to them, and to theyr heyres: then ſhee taketh it from them, to giue it to another. Therfore by reaſon I ſhould not complaine that I haue loſt any thing: for Fortune recommendeth vnto any other the temporall goods: but I carrie patience and Philoſophie with me, ſo that they haue diſcharged me from all other, and haue no more charge but for my ſelfe alone.
                     
                     
                        Laertius declareth in his fifth booke of the ſayings of the Gretians: That this Byas determined to goe to the Playes of the Mount Olympus, wherevnto Laert de antiq. Graec. reſorted people of all Nations: and he ſhewed himſelfe in this place of ſo high an vnderſtanding, that hee was counted ſupreame and chiefe of all Phyloſophers, and wonne the name of a true Phyloſopher.
                     Other Philoſophers then being in

the ſame Playes (called Olymp calles,) asked him many queſtions, of diuerſe and ſundry matters: where of I will make mention here onely of ſome of the chiefeſt.
                     
                        
                           The Queſtions demaunded of the Phyloſopher Byas.
                        
                           THE firſt Queſtion was this: Tell mee who is the vnhappieſt 
                           Certaine queſtions reſolued by Byas. 
                           man in the Worlde? Byas anſwered; Hee is moſt vnhappie, that is not patient in aduerſitie. For, men are not killed with the aduerſities they haue, but with the impatience which they ſuffer.
                        
                        The ſecond was, What is moſt hardeſt and moſt troubleſome to iudge: He aunſwered. There is nothing more difficult, then to iudge a contention betwixt two Friends. For to iudge between two enemyes: the one remaineth a Friende: but to iudge betweene two Friendes, the one is made an enemie.
                        
                        The third was, What is moſt hardeſt to meaſure? Wherevnto Byas anſwered; There is nothing that needeth more circumſpections, then the meaſuring of Time: For the Time ſhould bee meaſured ſo iuſtly, that no Time ſhould want to doe well, nor any time ſhould abound to doe euill.
                        
                        The fourth was: What thing is that, which needeth no excuſe in the accompliſhment thereof? Byas anſwered, The thing that is promiſed, muſt of neceſſitie be performed. For otherwiſe, hee that doth looſe the credite of his word, ſhould loſe more then he that ſhould loſe the promiſe to him made.
                        
                        The fifth was, What thing that is, wherein the men (as well good as euill) ſhould take care? Then Byas anſwered: Men ought not in any thing to take ſo great care, as in ſeeking counſell, and counſellours: For the proſperous Times cannot bee maintained, nor the multitude of enemyes reſiſted, if it be not by wiſe men, and graue counſells.
                        
                        The ſixt was, What thing that is wherein men are praiſed to be negligent? and that is, in chooſing of Friendes. Hee anſwered. In one thing onely men haue licence to be negligent.
                        
                        
                           Slowly ought thy Friends to bee choſen, and they neuer after for any thing ought to be forſaken.
                        
                        The ſeuenth was, What is that which the afflicted man doth moſt deſire? Byas anſwered, It is the chaunce of Fortune: and the thing which the proſperous man doth moſt abhorre, is, to thinke that Fortune is ſomutable. For the vnfortunate man hopeth for euery chaunge of Fortune to be made better, and the wealthy man feareth through euery change to be depriued of his bouſe.
                        
                        Theſe were the Queſtions which the Philoſophers demaunded of Byas, in the Playes of the Mount Olympus, in the 60. Olympiade.
                        
                        The Phyloſopher Byas liued about 95. yeares, and as he drewe neere his death, the Prienenſes (ſhewing themſelues to be maruellous ſorrowfull for the loſſe of ſuch a famous man) deſired him earneſtly to ordayne ſome lawes, whereby they might know how to chooſe Captaines, or ſome Prince, which after him might guide and gouerne the Realme.
                        The Phyloſopher Byas (vnderſtanding their honeſt and iuſt requeſts, he (with his beſt counſell and aduiſement) gaue them certaine wholſome Lawes, in fewe wordes, which followe.
                        And of theſe Lawes the diuine Plato maketh mention in his Booke De Legibus, and likewiſe Ariſtotle, in the booke of Oecenomices.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        The Lawes which BIAS gvue to the Prienenſes.
                        
                           WEe ordayne and command, that no Laws made by Byas. man bee choſen to bee Prince among the people, vnleſſe hee bee (at leaſt) forty yeares of age. For gouernours ought to be of ſuch age, that neyther youth nor ſmall experience ſhould cauſe them to erre in their affayres, nor weakeneſſe thorow ouermuch age ſhould hinder them from taking paines.
                        Wee ordayne and commaund, that none bee choſen amongſt the Prienenſes Gouernour, if hee bee not well learned in the Greeke Letters: For there is no greater plague in the publike weale, then for him to lacke wiſedome which gouerneth the ſame.
                        Wee ordayne and commaund that there bee none amongſt the Prienenſes choſen Gouernour, vnleſſe hee hath beene brought vp in the warres ten yeares at the leaſt: for hee alone doth know how precious a thing peace is, which by experience hath felt the extreame miſeries of warre.
                        Wee ordayne and commaund, that if any haue beene noted to bee cruell, that hee bee not choſen for Gouernour of the people; for that man which is cruell, is likely to be a Tyrant.
                        Wee ordaine and commaund, that if the Gouernor of the Prienenſes bee ſo hardy, or dare preſume to breake the auncient lawes of the people, that in ſuch caſe hee be depriued from the office of the Gouernour, and likewiſe exiled from the people: For there is nothing that deſtroyeth ſooner a publike-Weale, then to ordaine new and fond lawes, to breake the good auncient Cuſtomes.
                        Wee ordaine and commaund that the Gouernour of the Prienenſes doe worſhip and honour the Gods, and that hee bee a louer of the ſacred Temples. For otherwiſe hee that honoureth not God, will neuer miniſter equall iuſtice vnto men.
                        Wee ordaine and command that the Prince of Prienenſes bee contented with the warres which his Aunceſters left him, and that he doe not forget newe matters to inuade any other ſtrange Countries: and if perchance he would, that no man in this caſe bee bound neyther with money, nor in perſon to follow or ſerue him. For the God Apollo told mee, that that man which wil take another mans goods from him by force, ſhall looſe his owne Iuſtice.
                        Wee ordaine and command that the Gouernour of the Prienenſes go to pray and worſhip the Gods twice in the weeke, and likewiſe to viſite them in the Temples, and if hee doe the contrary, he ſhall not onely bee depriued of the gouernement, but alſo after his death he ſhall not bee buried. For the Prince that honoreth not God in time of his life, deſerueth not his bones ſhould bee honoured with ſepnlture after his death.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP, XXII. How God from the beginning puniſhed men by his iuſtice, and eſpecially thoſe Princes that deſpiſe his Church, and how all wicked Chriſtians are Pariſhioners of Hell.
                     
                     
                        WHen the Eternall Creatour, (who meaſureth all the things by his Omnipotency, and weigheth them by God the Creator of all things. his effectuall wiſedome) created all things aſwell celeſtiall as terreſtriall, viſible as inuiſible, corporate as incorporate, not onely promiſed to the good which ſerued him, but alſo threatned the euil with plagues which offended him: For the iuſtice and mercy of GOD, goe alwayes together, to the intent the one ſhould encourage the good, and the other threaten the euill.
                     This thing ſeemeth to bee true: for that wee haue but one GOD, which hath created but one World, wherein hee made but one Garden, in the which Garden there was but one Fountaine, and neere to that Fountaine he appointed onely one man, one woman, and one Serpent: neere vnto which was alſo one tree only forbidden, which is a thing maruellous to ſpeake, and no leſſe fearefull to ſee, how God did put into the terreſtriall Paradiſe (the ſame day that the creation of the World was finiſhed) both a ſword and a gybet. The gybet was the tree forbidden, whereof they did eate: Wherefore our Fathers were condemned. And the ſword was the peniſhment, wherwith wee all (as miſerable children) at this day are beheaded: for truely they did eate the bitterneſſe of theyr fault: and we doe feele the griefe of their paine. I meane to ſhew how our God by his power doth rayſe vp that which is beaten downe, how with his wiſedome he guideth thoſe which are blind, how by his will hee diſſembleth with the euill doers; neyther wil I tell how hee through his clemency pardoneth the offences, and through his light lightneth the darkeneſſe, nor how through his righteouſneſſe, hee amendeth that which is broken, and through his liberality payeth more then wee deſerue.
                     But I will here declare at large, how our omnipotent God through his iuſtice chaſtiſeth thoſe which walke not in his pathes. O Lord God how ſure may thy faithfull ſeruants Rewards 
                              〈…〉
                            to the 
                              〈…〉
                            the wicked be, for their ſmall ſeruices to receyue great rewards: and contrary, the euill ought alwayes to liue in as great feare, leſt for their hainous offences thou ſhouldeſt giue them cruell puniſhments: for though God of his bounty will not leaue any ſeruice vnrewarded, nor of his iuſtice will omit any euill vnpuniſhed: yet for all that wee ought to know, that aboue all, and more then all, hee will rigorouſly chaſtice thoſe, which maliciouſly deſpiſe the Catholike faith. For Chriſt thinketh himſelfe as much iniured of thoſe which perſecute his Church, as of thoſe that layd handes on his perſon, to put him to death.
                     We reade that in times paſt, God ſhewed ſundry grieuous and cruell puniſhments, to diuers high Lords and Princes, beſides other famous &amp; renowned men. But rigour had neuer ſuch power in his hand, as it had againſt thoſe which honored that infamed Idoll, and violated the ſacred Temples.
                     For to God this is the moſt haynous offence, to forſake the holy Catholike faith in his life, and to deſpaire

in his mercy, at the houre of his death.
                     Would to God wee had ſo much grace to acknowledge our offences, as God hath reaſon to puniſh our ſins.
                     For if it were ſo, then wee would amend The mercifull goodnes of God. in time to come, and God would graunt vs a general pardon for all that is paſt. I ſee one thing wherin (as I thinke) I am not deceiued, which is this: that the fraylties and miſeryes which we cōmit, wee thinke them naturall, and in the ſatisfaction and amendment of the ſame, wee ſay they are ſtrange. ſo that we admit the fault, and condemne the paine which thereby we doe deſerue. The ſecret iudgements of God doe ſuffer it, and our offences do deſerue it: I doe not denie, but that the euill may holde and poſſeſſe this life at their pleaſure: but I ſweare vnto them, when they ſhall leaſt thinke of it, they ſhall loſe theyr life, to their great diſpleaſure: for the pleaſures of this life, are ſo vnconſtant, that wee ſcarce beginne to taſte them, when they fade out of our ſight.
                     It is a rule infallible, which both of the good and euill hath bin proued: that all naturallie deſire, rather to abound then to want: &amp; all that which greatly is deſired with great diligence is ſearched, and through great trauell is obtained: and that thing which by trauell is attained, with loue is poſſeſſed, &amp; that which by loue is poſſeſſed, with much ſorrow is loſt, bewailed, &amp; lamented. For in the end wee cannot deny, but that the watry eies do manifeſtly ſhew the ſorrowfull harts. To the fine wits and ſtout harts, this is a continuall torment and endles paine, and a worme that alway gnaweth: to call to minde that he muſt loſe the ioyfull life, which he ſo entirely loued: &amp; taſt the fearfull death, which ſo greatly he abhorred. Therfore to proue this matter which I haue ſpoken of before, it is but reaſon that Princes knowe (if they doe not know) that men as the diuine Prouidence exalteth them to high Eſtates, they not deſeruing them: So likewiſe his rigorous iuſtice will bring thē to nought, if they bee vnthankfull for his benefits. For the ingratitude or benefits receiued, maketh that man not worthy to receyue any moe. The more a man throgh benefits is bound, the more grieuous puniſhment (if he How God puniſheth ingratitude. be vnthankfull) hee deſerueth.
                     All wiſe men ſhould finde (if they apply their mindes therevnto) that in chaſtiſing God calleth thoſe offences firſt to his minde, which are furtheſt from the thoughts of men. For before the Tribunall of God our ſecret faults are alwayes caſting out bloud, to the end hee ſhould execute on our perſon open iuſtice. And further (I ſay) that in this caſe I do not ſee that the Prince is exempted more, though hee liue in great felicitie, then the poore labourer, who liueth in extreame miſerie.
                     And alſo we ſee it eft-ſoones by experience, that the ſudden Lightning, Tempeſts, and terrible Thunder, forſaketh the ſmall and lowe Cottages, and battereth forthwith the great and ſumptuous buyldings. Gods will and determination is, that foraſ-much as hee hath exalted them aboue all others, ſo much the more they ſhould acknowledge him for Lord aboue all others: For GOD did neuer create high Eſtates, becauſe they ſhould worke wickednes: but he placed them in that degree, to the end they ſhould thereby haue more occaſion to doe him ſeruice.
                     Euery Prince that is not a good Chriſtian, a ſeruent louer of the Catholike faith, nor wil haue any reſpect to the Diuine ſeruice: let him be aſſured that in this world hee ſhall loſe his renowme, and in the other he ſhall hazard his ſoule. For that all euill Chriſtians are the Pariſhioners of Hell.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP, XXIII.
                     
                        The Anthour proueth by twelue examples that Princes are ſharpely puniſhed, when they vſurpe boldly vpon the Churches, and violate their temples.
                     
                     
                        Why the children of Aaron were puniſhed.
                        
                           IT is now time that wee leaue to perſwade with wordes and reaſons, and to beginne to proue that which we haue ſayd, by ſome excellent hiſtories, and notable examples: For in the end, the hearts of men are ſtirred more through ſome little examples, then with a great multitude of words. In the firſt booke of Leuiticus 
                           Leuit. 10. the 10. Chapter, is declared, how in the time of Moſes, the ſonne in law of Iethro the Prieſt, (that was of Media) who was chiefe Prince of all the lynage of Seph, with whom the brother of Mary the Leper, had charge of the high Prieſthood. For among all the lawes where God at any God the onely ruler of all eſtates time put his hands vnto; hee prouided alwayes that ſome had the gouernement of ciuill affayres, and others the adminiſtration of the diuine miſteries.
                        This high Prieſt then had towe children, whoſe names were Nadab, and Abihu, which two were yong and beautifull, ſtout and ſage, and during their infancie ſerued their Father, &amp; helped him to doe ſacrifice. For in the old law they ſuffered that Prieſts ſhould not onely haue wiues &amp; children, but alſo that their children ſhould ſucceed them in their Temples, and inherite their benefices.
                        There came a great miſchance for the two children being apparrelled in white, their bodies bound with ſtolles, their hands naked, in one hād holding a Torch, and in the other the Sencer, being negligent to light the new fire, and contrary to that the law had ordayned, and taking coales which were prohibited, a maruellous thing was ſeene in the ſight of the people, which was, that ſodenly theſe two childrē fel flat on the earth dead, and all their ſacrifice burned.
                        Truly the ſentence was maruellous, but it was iuſt in ough. For they well deſerued to looſe their liues, ſithence they durſt ſacrifice the coales of an other.
                        This thing ſeemed to be true, for theſe young children ſaued theyr The iuſt iudgement of God. ſoules, and made ſatisfaction of the fault with their liues: but other wicked men God permitteth to liue a ſhort time, becauſe they ſhall looſe their ſoules for euer.
                     
                     
                        
                           The cauſe why the Azotes were puniſhed.
                        
                        
                           THe Realme of Paleſtine being deſtitute of a King, at that time an honorable olde man gouerned the realme, which was Father to two Knights, named Albino and Phinides; for at that time the children of Iſrael were not gouerned by Kings that did moleſt them by iniuries: but by ſage men which did maintaine them by iuſtice.
                        It chaunced that the Azotes made warre againſt the Paleſtines, and were a kind of the Arabians, ſtout and warlike, the which fought ſo couragiouſly, that the Paleſtines and Hebrewes
                           
were conſtrained to bring their Arke into the middeſt of the Battell: which was a Relicke, (as a man ſhould haue put the holie Sacrament) to deuide a great multitude of people. But Fortune ſhewed her countenaunce vnto them ſo frowningly, that they were not onely ouer-come, but alſo were ſpoyled of the Arke, which was their chiefe relicke. And beſides that, there were 4000. Paleſtines ſlaine. The Azotes carryed away the Arke, full of Relickes vnto their temple, in the Cittie of Nazote, and ſet it by Dagon, theyr curſed Idoll.
                        The moſt High &amp; true God (which will not ſuffer any to be coequall with The permiſsion of God. him in compariſon, or in anie thing that hee repreſenteth) cauſed this Idol to be ſhaken, thrown downe, and broken in pieces, no man touching it. For our God is of ſuch power, that to execute his Iuſtice he needeth not worldly helpe. God not contented thus (though the Idoll was broken in pieces, but cauſed thoſe to bee puniſhed likewiſe which worſhipped it: in ſuch ſort, that al the people of Azotes, Aſcalon, Geth, Acharon, and of Gaza, which were fiue auncient and renowmed The plague of God vpon Idolaters. Citties) were plagued, both man and woman inwardly, with the diſeaſe of the Emerodes: So that they could not eate ſitting, nor ride by the wayes on horſe-backe.
                        And to the end that all men might ſee that their offences were grieuous, (for the puniſhment they receyued by the diuine Iuſtice) he repleniſhed their Houſes, Places, Gardens, Seedes, and Fields, full of Rats; And as they had erred in honouring the falſe Idol, and forſaken the true God, So hee would chaſtice them with two Plagues, ſending them the Emerodes, to torment their bodyes, and the Rats, to deſtroy their goods. For to him that willingly giueth his ſoule to the diuel, it is but a ſmall matter, that God (againſt his will) depriue him of his goods.
                        This then being thus, I would now gladly knowe, whether of them committed moſt offence? Eyther the Azotes, which ſet the Arke in the Temple, which (as they thought,) was the moſt holieſt: or the falſe Chriſtians, which with a Sacrilegious boldneſſe, dare attempt (without anie feare of GOD,) to robbe and pill the Church goods, to theyr owne priuate commoditie in this world.
                        Truely the Law of the Azotes differed as much frō the Chriſtians, as the offence of the one differeth from the other. For the Azotes erred not, beleeuing that this Arke was the Figure of the True God; but we beleeue it, and confeſſe it, and without ſhame cōmit againſt it infinite vices.
                        By this ſo rare and ſeuere a ſudden puniſhment, mee thinks the Princes &amp; great Lords, ſhould not only therefore acknowledge the True God, but alſo Reuerence and honour thoſe things which vnto him are dedicated. For mans lawes (ſpeaking of the reuerence of a Prince,) doe no leſſe condemne him to die, that robbeth his houſe, then him which violently layeth hands on his perſon.
                     
                     
                        ¶ The cauſe why Prince Oza was puniſhed.
                        
                        IN the booke which the ſonne of Helcana wrote, that is the ſecond booke of the Kings, and the vi. Chapter, hee 2. Reg. 6. ſaith: That the Arke of Iſrael with his Relikes (which was Manna, the rodde, and two ſtones) ſtood in the houſe of Aminadab, which was the next neighbour to the citie of Gibeah, the ſonne of Eſay, (who at that time was King of the Iſraelites) determined to tranſpoſe the Relikes into his Cittie and houſe: For that it ſeemed to him a great infamy, that to a mortal Prince,

a houſe ſhould abound for his pleaſures, &amp; to the immortall God there ſhould want a Temple for his reliques.
                        The day therefore appointed when they ſhould carrie the Relique of Gibeah to Bethlehem, there met thirty thouſand Iſraelites, with a great number of Noble men which came with the King, beſides a greater number of ſtrangers. For in ſuch a caſe thoſe are more which come of their owne pleaſure, then thoſe which are commaunded. Beſides all the people they ſay, that all the Nobility of the Realme was there to the end the relique ſhould bee more honoured, and his perſon better accompanied. It chanced that as the Lords and people went ſinging and the King in perſon dancing, the wheele of the Chariot began to fall, and go out of the way, the which prince Oza ſeeing, by chance ſet to his hand, and his ſhoulder againſt it, becauſe the Arke where the Relique was ſhould not fall, nor breake: yet notwithſtanding that, ſuddenly and before them all, hee fell downe dead.
                        Therefore let this puniſhment be noted for truly it was fearefull, and ye ought to thinke, that ſince God, (for A good admonition for all Eſtates. putting his hand to the Chariot to holde it vp) ſtroke him with death, that a Prince ſhould not hope (ſeeking the deſtruction and decay of the Church) that God will prolong his life. O Princes, great Lords, and Prelates, ſith Oza with ſuch diligence loſt his life, what doe yee hope or looke for, ſith with ſuch negligence yee deſtroy and ſuffer the Church to fall? Yet once againe, I doe returne to exclaime vpon you. O Princes and great Lords, ſith Prince Oza deſerued ſuch puniſhment, becauſe without reuerence hee aduanced himſelfe to ſtay the Arke which fell, what puniſhment ought yee to haue, which through malice, helpe the Church to fall.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Why King Balthaſar was puniſhed,
                        
                        
                           
                              DArius King of the Perſes and Medes beſieged the auncient Babylon beſieged. City of Babylon in Chaldea, whereof Balthaſar ſonne of Nabuchodonozar the great was King and Lord: who was ſo wicked a child, that his father being dead, hee cauſed him to be cut in 300. peeces, &amp; gaue him to 300. hawkes to be eaten, becauſe hee ſhould not reuiue againe, to take the goods &amp; riches from him which he had left him. I know not what father is ſo fooliſh, that letteth his Son liue in pleaſures, and afterwards the entralles of the Hauke wherewith the ſonne hawked, ſhould be the wofull graue of the Father, which ſo many men lamented,
                        This Balthaſar then beeing ſo beſieged, determined one night to make a great feaſt and banquet to the Lords of his Realme that came to ayde him; and in this he did like a valiant and ſtout Prince, to the end the Perſes and Medes might ſee, that hee little eſteemed their power.
                        The noble and high hearts do vſe when they are enuironed with many trauels, to ſeeke occaſions to inuent pleaſures; becauſe to their men they may giue greater courage, and to their enemies greater feare. He declareth of Pirrus King of the Epirotes, when hee was beſieged very ſtraightly in the City of Tharenta, of the Romane Captaine Quintus Dentatus, that then hee ſpake vnto his Captaines in this ſort: Lordes and friendes bee yee nothing at all abaſhed, ſince I neuer here before ſaw ye afraid, though the Romans haue compaſſed our bodies yet we haue beſiged their harts
                           
                           For I let you to know, that I am of ſuch a complection, that the ſtraighter they 
                           The ſtout reſolution of Pirius. 
                           keepe my body, the more my heart is at large. And further I ſay, though the Romanes beate downe the walles, yet our hearts ſhall remaine inuincible. And though there bee no wall betweene vs, yet wee will make them know that the hearts of Greekes are harder to ouercome, then the ſtones of Tarentine are to be beaten downe.
                        
                        But returning to King Balthaſar. The banquet then being ended, and the greateſt part of the night beeing ſpent, Belthaſar the King being very well pleaſed that the banquet was made to his contentation (though he was not the ſobreſt in drinking wine) commaunded all the cups of gold &amp; ſiluer with the treaſure hee had, to be brought and ſet on the table, becauſe all the bidden gueſts ſhould drinke therein.
                        King Balthaſar did this, to the end the Princes and Lords, with al his Captains, ſhould manfully helpe him to defend the Siege, and alſo to ſhew that hee had much treaſure to pay them for their paines. For to ſay the truth, there is nothing that encourageth men of warre more, then to ſee their reward before their eyes: As they were drinking merily (at the banquet) of theſe cups which Nabuchodonozar had robbed from the Temple of Hieruſalem, ſuddenly by the power of God, and the deſert of his offences, there appeared a hand in the wall without a body or arme, The reward due to thoſe that contemne God. which with his fingers wrote theſe words, Mane, Thetel, Phares, which ſignifieth: O King Balthaſar, God hath ſeene thy life, and findeth that thy malice is now accompliſhed. Hee hath commaunded that thou and thy Realme ſhould bee weighed, and hath found that there lacketh a great deale of iuſt weight, wherfore he commaundeth, that thy life for thine offences bee taken from thee, and that thy Realme bee put into the hands of the Perſians and Medes, which are thine enemies.
                        
                        This viſion was not fruſtrare, for the ſame night without any longer delay, the execution of the ſentence was put in effect by the enemies. The King Balthaſar dyed, the Realme was loſt, the treaſures were robbed, the Noble men taken, and al the Chaldeans captiues,
                        I would now know, ſith Balthaſar was ſo extreamely puniſhed onely for giuing his Concubines &amp; friends drinke in the ſacred cups, what paine deſerueth Princes and Prelates then, which robbe the Churches for prophane things? how wicked ſoeuer Balthaſar was, yet hee neuer chaunged, gaue, ſold, nor engaged the treaſures of the Synagogue: but what ſhall wee ſay, and ſpeake of Prelates, which without any ſhame, waſte, change, ſell and ſpend the Church goods? I take it to be leſſer offence to giue drinke in a Chalice, as King Balthaſar did to one of his Concubines, then to enter into the Church by Symony, as many do now a daies. A good caneat for Magiſtrates This Tyrant was ouercome more by folly then by couetouſneſſe, but theſe others are vanquiſhed with folly, couetouſnes and Symony
                        What meaneth this alſo, that for the offence of Nabuchodonozar in Ieruſalem, his ſonne Balthaſar ſhould come and bee puniſhed? For this truely mee thinke not conſonant to reaſon, nor agreeable to mans Lawe, that the Father ſhould commit the Theft, and the ſonne ſhould requite it with ſeuen double. To this I anſwer, That the good child is bound to reſtore all the goods that his Father hath left him euill gotten. For hee that enioyeth the theft, deſerueth no leſſe puniſhment, then hee that committeth the theft. For in the end both are theeues, and deſerue to bee hanged on the gallows of the diuine iuſtice.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           Why King Ahab was puniſhed.
                        
                        
                           IN the fifth Booke of Malachie, that is to ſay, in the third booke of Kings, the 8. Chapter. It is declared, that Aſa being King of Iudea, and propheſying in Ieruſalem, at the time Omri was King of Iſrael, and after him ſucceeded Ahab his ſonne, being of the age of 22, yeares. This Ahab was not onely young of yeares, but younger of vnderſtanding, and was numbred among the wicked Kings: not onely euill, but too euil: for the Scriptures doe vſe to call them by names infamed, whoſe liues deſerued no memory. The The wickednes of Ahab. vices of this King Ahab were ſundry and diuers, whereof I will declare ſome as hereafter followeth. Firſt of all, hee followed altogether the life and ſteps of the King Ieroboam, who was the firſt that entiſed the children of Iſrael to commit Idolatrie: which thing turned to great reproach and infamy. For the Prince erreth not imitating the pathes of the good; but offendeth in following the wayes of the euill.
                        Secondarily, this King Ahab married the daughter of the King of the Idumeans, whoſe name was Iezabel, which was of the ſtocke of the Gentiles, and he of the Hebrewes. And for a truth the marriage was vnaduiſedly conſidered: for ſage Princes ſhould take wiues conformable to their lawes and conditions, vnleſſe they wil repent themſelus afterwards. Thirdly, hee built againe the City of Hierico, which by the commaundement of God was deſtroyed, and cōmanded that vpon grieuous pains it ſhould not bee reedefied againe: becauſe the offences that were therein committed were ſo great, that the Inhabitants did not onely deſerue to loſe their liues, but alſo that in Hierico there ſhould not one ſtone remaine vpon another.
                        Fourthly, King Ahab built a ſumptuous Temple to the Idol Baal, in the City of Samaria, and conſecrated a wood vnto him, which he had very pleaſant, and ſet in the Temple his Image of fine gold: ſo that in the raign of this curſed King, Baal the wicked Idol was ſo highly eſteemed, that not onely ſecretly, but alſo openly, they blaſphemed the true &amp; liuing God. The caſe was ſuch, that one day Ahab going againſt the King of Syria, to take him and his City called Ramoth Gilead, being in battell was ſhot into the breſt with an arrow, wherewith he not onely loſt his life, but alſo the dogges did lap vp his bloud that The puniſhment of Ahab. fell to the earth. O Princes and great Lords, if you will giue credite vnto mee you ſhall haue nothing more in recommendation then to bee good Chriſtians: Sith yee ſee that as this Prince in his life, did ſerue ſtrange Idols: ſo it was reaſon, that after his death, his bloud ſhould bee buried in the entrals of rauenous dogs.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           why King Manaſſes was puniſhed.
                        
                        
                           THe King Manaſſes was the ſonne of Ezechias, and Father of Amō, which were all Kinges. And truly they differed ſo much in manners and conditions, that a man could ſcarcely iudge, whether the vertues and proweſſes of the Father, were more to be deſired: or the

vice and wickedneſſe of the children to bee abhorred.
                        This Manaſſes was a wicked Prince, for as much as he built new Temples to Baal, and in the Cities made Hermitages for the Idols, and in the mountaines repayred all the Altars that heretofore were conſecrated to the Deuill. Hee conſecrated many Forreſts and Woods to the Idolls, he honoured the Starres as the Gods, &amp; did ſacrifice to the Planets and Elements: for the man that is abandoned by the hand of God, there is no wickedneſſe that his obſtinate heart doth not enterpriſe. So that hee had in his Pallace all manner of falſe Prophets, as Southſayers, Propheſiers, Witches, Sorcerers, Enchaunters, and Coniurers, the which dayly hee cauſed to giue ſacrifice to the Idols: and gaue ſuch credite to Sorcerers and Inchaunters, that his ſeruants were all for the moſt part Sorcerers, and in them was his chiefe delight and pleaſure. And likewiſe he was skilfull in all kind of miſchiefe, and ignorant in all vertues. He was ſo cruell, and ſpilt ſo much innocent bloud, that if it had beene water put together, and the bodies of them that he ſlew layd on heapes, it would both haue couered their carkaſes, and alſo haue drowned the liuing: Yet hee not contented with that I haue ſpoken off, ſet in the Temple of the Lord What miſchiefe followes the contemners of God. an olde Idoll that ſtood in the wood: for the puniſhment of which fact, God ſuffered his ſeruants to kill his eldeſt ſonne. And afterward God would not ſuffer theſe ſuch ſundry miſchiefes of mans malice, but of his diuine iuſtice cauſed theſe words to bee proclaimed in Hieruſalem. Sith the King Manaſſes hath beene ſo bolde to contemne mee, and himſelfe alone to commit the offences of all, I will chaſtice him alone with the ſame correction that hee hath ſhewed vnto others.
                        
                        By theſe words let Princes note here, how the diuine vengeance extendeth no further, then our offences deſerue, ſo that if our fault bee litle, the puniſhment which hee giueth vs is very temperate: but if the Prince bee ſtubborne and obſtinate in his wickedneſſe, let him be ſure that the puniſhment ſhall be extreame.
                     
                     
                        Why Iulius, Pompeius, Xerxes, Catilina, Germanicus, and Brennus were puniſhed.
                        
                           WHen Pompeius the Great paſſed into the Orient, with all the Hoſt of the Romaine people, and after he had ſubdued all Siria, Meſopotamia, Damaſco, and Arabia: hee paſſed into the Realme of Paleſtine, which otherwiſe was called Iudea, where he committed diuers and ſundry euils, ſo that many of the Romanes and Hebrues dyed there.
                        Finally, by force of Armes hee tooke the puiſſant City of Hieruſalem, which as Plinie ſayeth, was the beſt of all Aſia: And Strabo ſayeth of the ſituation of the World, that Rome was the chiefe of all Italy, and of Affricke the principall was Carthage, of Spaine Numantia: of Germany, Argentine: of Caldea, Babylon: of Egypt, Thebes: of Greece, Athens: of Phenice, Tira: of Cappadocea, Ceſare: of Thrace, Conſtantinople: and of Paleſtine, Hieruſalem.
                        
                        
                           Pompeius therefore not contented to kill all the Auncients of that warre, to impriſon the youth, to behead the elders, to force the mothers, to defile the virgins, to teare in peeces the children, to beat down buildings, The cruelty of Pompeius. and to rob the Treaſure

                           : but encreaſing euill vpon euill, and putting all

al the people to deſtruction, he made of the Temple a Stable for his horſes: which before God was abominable, that where alwayes heretofore he had beene a Conquerour, and triumphed ouer twenty two Kinges, euer after he was vnluckie, and ouercome in battell.
                        The famous rebell Catilina (as Saluſt 
                           The puniſhment of ſacriledge. affirmeth) had neuer beene ouercome, as if it had not beene for the robbing and deſtroying of the Temples, which were conſecrated to the Gods.
                        The noble Marcuus Marcellus (to whome no Romaine is to bee compared in vertues) the ſame day hee cauſed the Temple of the Goddeſſe Februa to be burnt, was himſelfe ſlaine in battell.
                        The noble Romaine Captaine Druſius Germanicus, that was ſo well willed and beloued, becauſe hee gaue a calfe meate to eate (which was the God of the Chaldeans (being prohibited and forbidden) within a moneth after dyed, whoſe death was greatly lamented in Rome.
                        
                        
                           Suetonius ſayeth, that after Iulius Caeſar, had robbed the Temple of the Gawles; the Gods alwayes made him afrayde in the night.
                        And Xerxes, which was the Sonne of King Darius, when he paſſed into Italy to wage battell, before all other things hee ſent foure thouſand Horſemen to Delphos (where the Temple of God Apollo was,) to beate it downe: for the pride of Xerxes was ſo great, that hee would not only ſubdue men, but alſo conquer the Gods:
                        It chanced, that euen as they approached neere the Temple to beate it downe, a ſodaine tempeſt fell vpon The pride of Xerxes euerthrown them, ſo that with ſtones and thunderbolts they were all killed in the fields, and ſo dyed.
                        
                           Brennus was one of the renowned Captaines of the Gothes, who ſith hee had conquered and ſubdued the Greekes, determined alſo to robbe the Treaſures of the Temples, ſaying that Gods ſhould giue vnto men, &amp; not men vnto Gods, and that it was great honour to the Gods, that with their goods, men ſhould bee made rich: But as they beganne to robbe the Temple, there fell a multitude of arrowes from heauen, that the Captaine Brennus dyed there, and all his The miſrable end of Brennus. men with him, not one left aliue.
                        After that Sextus Pompeius was vanquiſhed in the battell by ſea, neare vnto Sicilie, by Octauus Auguſtus, hee retired himſelfe into the Arkes Lacinii, where there was an auncient Temple conſecrated to the Goddeſſe Iuno, endowed with maruellous Treaſures.
                        And it chaunced one day, that his Souldiers asking him money, and he being then without, he commaunded them to beate down the Temple of the Goddeſſe Iuno, and to pay themſelus with the ſpoyle of her treaſure. Vhe Hiſtoriographers ſay, that within a while after it chanced, Sextus Pompeius to be taken of the knights of Marcus Antonius, and when hee was brought before Titus Generall of the Army, he ſpake vnto him theſe words I will you know Sextus Pompeius, I doe not condemne thee to dye for the offences thou haſt committed againſt my Lord Marcus Antonius: But becauſe thou haſt robbed and beaten downe the Temple of the Goddeſſe Iuno.

                     CHAP. XXIIII. How Valente the Emperour becauſe hee was an euill Chriſtian, loſt in one day both the Empire and his life, and was burned aliue in a ſheepecote.
                     
                     
                        WHen Iulian the Apoſtate was Emperour of Rome, hee ſent to conquer Hungary, of no iuſt title hee had to it, more then of ambition to vnite it to the Romane Empire, For tirannous Princes vſe all their force to vſurpe other realms by crueltie, and little regard whether they may doe it by iuſtice. And becauſe the Romane Empire was of great force, this ambitious Emperour Iulian, had in that warres a mighty and puiſſant Armie, which did wonderfull much harme through all the coū
                        tries they came. For the fruites of warres is, to bereaue the enemies of life, and to ſpoyle the men of theyr goods.
                     It chaunced one day as fiue knights went out of the Campe, to make a rode, they found a youngman that The valour of Gracian. carried a halter in his hand, and as they would haue taken it away from him, to haue tyed theyr horſes to let them feede, hee was ſo hardy and ſo ſtout, that hee defended himſelfe from them all: ſo that he had more ſtrength alone then they fiue altogether.
                     The Romane Knights amazed to ſee this young man defend himſelfe from them all ſo ſtoutely, very inſtantly deſired him to goe to the Romane Campe with them, and they promiſed him hee ſhould haue great entertainement: for the Romanes were ſo diligent, that they ſhould omit no good thing for want of money, ſo that it were for the publike weale. This young man was called Gracian, and was borne and brought vp in the Country of Pannonia, in a City they called Cibata: His lynage was not of the loweſt ſort of people, nor yet of the moſt eſteemed Cittizens, but were men that liued by the ſweate of their browes, and in loue of the common people. And truly it is no ſmall benefit that God had made him of a mean eſtate, for to be of baſe lynage, maketh men to bee deſpiſed, and not regarded: and to come of a noble bloud and high lynage, maketh men to be proud and lofty.
                     This young man being come into What maketh a man to be reſpected in this world. the Romaine Campe, the fame was immediately ſpred, how that he alone had vanquiſhed 5. Knights. And his ſtrength and courage was ſo highly eſteemed, that within a while after he was made Pretour of the Armie. For the Romaines, not according to fauour, but according to the ability of men, diuided the offices and degrees of honour in warres. Time therefore working his nature, and many eſtates being decayed, after this young Gracian was made Pretour of the Armie, and that hee was ſufficiently tryed in the warres, Fortune, which many times bringeth that to paſſe in a day, that mans malice cannot in many yeares, rayſed this Gracian to be Emperour of Rome: For truly one houre of good ſucceſſe is more worth, then all worldly fauour.
                     
                     This Gracian was not onely ſingular Gracian choſen Emperour. in ſtrength, couragious in battell, fortunate in all his affayres: but alſo hee was luckie of children: that is to ſay, hee had two ſonnes, which were Emperors of Rome, the one was called Valente, the other Valentinian. In this caſe the children might glory to haue a Father ſo ſtout: but the glory of the Father is greater to haue ſonnes of ſuch Nobility: For there is no greater felicity in this world;

then during life, to come to honour and riches: and after death, to leaue good children to enioy them. The eldeſt of the two ſonnes was the Emperour Valente, who ruled in the Orient for the ſpace of foure yeeres, and was the nine and thirtieth Emperour of Rome from Iulius Caeſar, though ſome doe beginne at the time of Octauian, ſaying, that hee was vertuous, and that Iulius Caeſar vſurped the Empire like a Tyrant. This Valente was beautifull of perſon, but poore of vertues: ſo that hee was more beautifull then vertuous, more couragious then mercifull, more rich then charitable, more cruell then pittifull. For there are many Princes that are very expert to deuiſe new orders in a common wealth, but there are few that haue ſtoute hearts to put the ſame in execution.
                     In thoſe dayes the Sect of Arrian the curſed Heretike flouriſhed, and The hereſie of Arian. the Emperour Valente was greatly blinded therein: inſomuch that hee did not onely fauour the Arrians, but alſo hee perſecuted the Chriſtians, which was ſhewed for ſo much as he killed, and cauſed to be killed (for that occaſion) many lay men, and tooke many Clerkes, and baniſhed many Biſhops, ouerthrew many Churches, robbed the goods of the Chriſtians, and did infinite other miſchiefes in the common welth: For the Prince which is infected with hereſie, and liueth without feare of the Church, there is neither miſchiefe nor treaſon but he will commit.
                     In the deſerts of Egypt in the mountaines of Armenia, and in the cities of Alexandrie, there was a great multitude of Fryers and religious men, amongſt whom were many Wiſemen, and pure of life, conſtant in the defence of the Church, and patient in perſecutions. For hee is a true religious man, that in time of peace is charitable to teach the ignorant, and bolde in the time of Schiſmes to confound the Heretikes, The deſcription of a religious man.
                     
                     The Emperour Valente was not onely a friend vnto the Arrians, and and an enemie to the Chriſtians, but alſo hee was a perſecuter of the deuoute and religious Fryers. For hee commaunded proclamations to be hid through all his Realmes and Domions, that all the religious that were young in yeares, whole of their bodies, and ſound of their limmes, ſhould immediately caſt off theyr Cowles and Hoodes, leauing theyr Monaſtery, and take Souldiers wages in the Campe: for hee ſayde Monaſteries were inuented for nothing elſe but to maintaine thoſe that were deformed, blinde, lame and maymed; and vpon this occaſion, hee ſhewed great tyranny: for many Monaſteries were left naked, many notable conſtitutions were broken, many hermites were martyred, many Fryers whipped, many notable Barons baniſhed, and many good men robbed of their goods. For the vertuous men deſired rather the bitter life of the Monaſtery then the ſweete and pleaſant liberty of the world.
                     This wicked Emperour yet not contented with theſe things, as by chance his wife commended vnto him the beauty of a Romane called The cruelty of Valente. 
                        Iuſtinia, without any more delay hee married her, not forſaking his firſt wife, and immediately made a law throughout all his Empire, that without incurring any danger, each Chrian might haue two wiues, and marry with them by the law of Matrimonie: for the tyrannous Princes (to cloake their vices) make and eſtabliſh the lawes of vices. The ſhame was not little that the Emperour Valente (againſt the commaundement of the Church) would marry with two women at one time: but the leſſe ſhame

hee had, the greater was his iniquitie to put it in execution, and to cauſe it to bee publiſhed through his realm as a Law: for a particular vice corrupteth but one alone, but a generall law deſtroyeth all.
                     At that time the puiſſant Gothes were in the parties of the Orient, the which were in feates of Armes very valiant and couragious: but in things of faith they were euil brought vp, although the greateſt part of them were baptized: for then the Church was very poore of Prelates, howbeit thoſe that they had were very notable men. After the Gothes were baptized, and the fury of the warres ſomwhat appeaſed, they ſent Ambaſſadours to the Emperour Valente, deſiring him that immediately, and forth with hee would ſend them holy Catholike Biſhoppes, by whoſe doctrine they might be inſtructed, &amp; brought to the Chriſtian faith: for it was ſuppoſed that the Emperour of Rome could haue no Biſhops in their countryes vnleſſe they were vertuous: this wicked Emperour, ſith hee was now entangled with hereſie, and that hee had peruerted the cuſtomes of good Emperours (that is, for hauing about him euill Biſhoppes) as he was now enuironed with al euils and miſchiefes, ſo hee ſent to the Gothes a Biſhop called Eudoxius, the which was a ranke Arrian: and brought with him many Biſhoppes, which were Heretikes, by the which the Kinges and Princes of the Gothes were Arrians, for the ſpace of two hundred yeares,
                     The Catholike Princes ought to take great care to Watch, and in watching to be warie and circumſpect, that they, their Realmes, neyther The duety of euery good Prince their Subiects ſhould in theyr time bee defiled with hereſie: For the plague of Heretikes and Hereſies, is not of light occaſion baniſhed the place where once it hath raigned.
                     Wee haue declared of the ſmall faith that this Emperour had in Ieſus Chriſt, and of the great miſchiefes he did to the Church. Let vs now ſee what was the end of his miſerable life. For the man of wicked life ſeldome commeth to good end. The matter was this, that as the Gothes were driuen out of the Realme by ſome of the Hunnes, they came immediately to the Realme of Thracia, which then was ſubiect to the Romanes. And the Emperour Valente without any couenant receiued them into his land, wherein hee committed great folly, and vſed little wiſedome: for it is a generall rule, where The folly and ouerſight of the Emperour. rebels, vagabonds, &amp; ſtrangers come to inhabite, there the Realme and dominions is deſtroyed.
                     The Gothes remained certain yeares among them, without any diſſention or quarrelling againſt the Romaines: but afterwards through the couetouſnes of Maximus chiefe Captain of the Romaines, who denyed the Gothes of their prouiſion, which ſo long time remained Friendes, aroſe betweene them ſo cruell warres, that it was the occaſion of the loſſe and vtter vndoing both of Rome and of all Italie. For truly there is no enmity doth ſomuch hurt, as that of Friends when they fall out at diſcord,
                     The Warres now being kindled, the Gothes were ſcattred through the Kingdome of Thrace, and they left no Forte but they battered downe, they came to no Townes, Villages, nor Cities but they ſacked and ſpoyled: They tooke no Women but they forced, and rauiſhed, they entred into no houſe but they robbed.
                     Finally, the Gothes in ſhort time ſhewed the poiſon that they had againſt the Romans: &amp; let no man maruell

that the Gothes committed ſo many cruel and hainous facts, ſith we that are Chriſtians doe commit dayly greater offences. For among rebels it is a common errour, that that which they rob in the warres, they ſay they are not bound to reſtore in peace. The Emperor Valente was then in the citie of Antioch, and ſith he had aſſembled there a great armie, and had great aide out of Italy, he determined himſelfe in perſon to goe into the campe of the Romans, and to giue the onſet againſt the Gothes, wherein hee ſhewed himſelfe more bold then wiſe for a Prince in battael cā do no more then one man, nor fight more then one man, and if he die, he is the occaſion of the death and deſtruction of them all. When both the hoſts of the Romaines and the Gothes ioyned, there was betweene them a cruell and mortall fight: ſo that in the firſt brunt the Gothes ſhewed themſelues ſo valiant, that they put to flight the Romans horſemen, leauing their footemen alone in great ieopardie, the which in ſhort ſpace after were diſcomfited and ſlaine, not one left aliue. For the barbarous ſware that that day the Gothes ſhould all die, or elſe vtterly they would deſtroy the name of the Romanes. And in this firſt charge the Emperour Valente was mortally wounded, who perceyuing he had his deathes wound, and that the battell was loſt, hee determined to flye and ſaue himſelfe; but when fortune beginneth to perſecute any man, ſhee leaueth him not vntill ſhee ſee him dead, or beaten downe without recouery.
                     Therefore as this wicked Emperour (thinking to ſaue himſelfe) came into a ſheepecote, the enemies ſeeing him, in the end ſet fire on the ſhepecote, and burnt him aliue. So in one day hee loft his perſon, his life, his honour, and his Empire.
                     
                        For it is meete that Princes and great Lords ſhould lift vp their eyes to conſider 
                        The miſerable end of the Emperour Valentinian. 
                        well the Hiſtorie of Valente, that they ſtray not from the Catholike Faith, that they diſhonour not Gods Miniſters and maintaine hereſyes. For as this accurſed Emperour Valente for his wicked doings was condignely puniſhed by the hands of Almighty God So let them be aſſured, the ſelfe ſame God will not pardon their offences. For it is a rule infallible, That that Prince which is not a good Chriſtian, ſhal fall into the hands of his cruell enemies.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXV. Of the Emperor Valentinian and Gracian his Sonne, which raigned in the time of Saint Ambroſe, which becauſe they were good Chriſtians, were alwayes fortunate, and that God giueth victory vnto Princes, more through the teares of them that pray, then thorow the weapons of thoſe that fight.
                     
                     
                        
                           IAlentinian and Valent were brethren, and the eldeſt of A cuſtome among the Romanes. them was Valentinian who ſucceeded in the Empire (after the death of his Father) to bee Pretor of the Armies. For amongſt the Romaines there was a Law in vre, that if the Father dyed in the fauour of the people, of right the ſonne without any other demand was heyre.
                     This Valentinian was a luſty yong man, of a ſanguine complexion, and of his body well ſhaped, and aboue all hee was a good Chriſtian, and of all the people generally welbeloued: For nothing adorneth the noble man more, then to bee counted

ciuill and courteous of behauiour.
                     At that time when the Emperour Iulian perſecuted moſt the Chriſtians: Valentinian was Pretour of the Armies; and when Iulian was aduertiſed that Valentinian was a Chriſtian, hee ſent vnto him, and bad him doe ſacrifice to the Idols of the Romane Emperor, or elſe to forſake the office of his Pretorſhip.
                     
                        Iulian would gladly haue killed Valentinian but he durſt not: for it was a Law inuiolable amongſt the Romanes, that no Citizen ſhould be put to death without the decree of the Senate, Valentinian receyuing the meſſage of this Emperour Iulian, aduertiſed of his will (which was to renounce his faith, or to leaue his office) hee did not onely reſigne his office, but therewithall forgaue the Emperour all the money hee ought him for arrerages of his ſernice. And becauſe hee would liue with a more quiet conſcience he went from Rome into a Cloyſter, where hee baniſhed himſelfe for two yeares and a halfe; &amp; for this hee was highly eſteemed and commended.
                     For it is a good ſigne, That man is 
                        The duty of euery good Chriſtian. 
                        a good Chriſtian, which of his owne free will renounceth worldly goods. Shortly after it happened that Iulian the Emperour went to conquere the Realme of Perſia, where in a battell hee was very ſore wounded, and fell downe dead in the preſent place. For to the miſhaps of Fortune, the Emperour with all his eſtate and pleaſures is as much ſubiect, as is the pooreſt man that lieth in the ſtreetes.
                     When the newes came to Rome that Iulian was dead, by the conſent of all, Valentinian was created Emperour; ſo that hee being baniſhed for Chriſts ſake, was called againe, and crowned Prince of the Romane Empire.
                     
                        Let no man care to looſe all that hee poſſeſſeth, let no man weigh to ſee himſelfe deſpiſed for Chriſtes ſake: For in the end men cannot in a thouſand yeeres ſo much abaſe vs, as God in one houre can exalt vs.
                     
                     In the ſame yeare, which was from the foundation of Rome 
                        
                           •
                        119 in a City called Atrobata, it rained very fine wooll, ſo that all the City became rich. In the ſame yeare, in the City of Conſtantinople, it hayled ſuch great ſtones, that they killed many men, &amp; left no heards in the fields aliue. At that ſame time there came an Earthquake throughout Italy, and ſo likewiſe in Sicille, that many houſes fell, and ſlew ſundry perſons, and aboue all, the ſea roſe in ſuch ſort, that it drowned many Cities nigh thereunto. Paulus Diaconus in the 11. booke The deſcription of the Emperour Valentinian 
                        De Legibus Romanorum, ſayeth, that the Emperour Valentinian was of a ſubtill wit, of graue countenance, eloquenr in ſpeech, yet hee ſpake little ſtout in his affaires, and diligent in his buſineſſe, in aduerſities patient, and a great enemie of the vicious, temperate in eating &amp; drinking, and a friend of religious perſons; ſo that they ſayde, hee reſembled the Emperour Aurelius. For after that the Emperour Marcus Aurelius dyed (with whom the felicitie of the Roman Empire ended) they euer vſed thēcefoorth in Rome to compare and liken the yong and new come Princes to the ancient Emperours their Anreceſſors. That is to ſay, if the Prince were couragious, they ſayde hee was like Iulius Caeſar, if he were vertuous, they ſayde he was an other Octauian: if he were fortunate, that hee was Tiberius, if hee were raſh, they ſay de he was Caligula, if he were cruell, they compared him to Nero, if hee were mercifull, they ſaid he was like to Traian, or Antoninus Pius, if he were beaucifull, they likened him to Titus, if idle they compared him to Domitian, if

he were patient, they called him Veſpaſius, if he were temperate they likened him to Adrian, if he were deuout to their gods, then he ſeemed Aurelianus. Finally, he that was ſage and vertuous, they compared him to the good Marcus Aurelius.
                     
                     This Emperour Valentinian was a good Chriſtian, and in all his affaires touching the Empire, very wiſe and circumſpect, and yet he was noted for one thing verie much, and that was, that hee truſted and fauoured his ſeruants ſo much, and was ſo led by his Friends, that through their occaſion, (they abuſing his loue and credite,) there aroſe many diſſentions amongſt the people.
                     
                        Seneca ſaide once vnto the Emperour Nero, I will that thou vnderſtand (Lorde) that there is no patience, 
                        The ſaying of Seneca. 
                        can ſuffer, that two or three abſolutely commaund all, not for that they are moſt vertuous, but for that they are moſt in fauour with thee.
                     
                     
                        O yee Noble Princes and great Lords, if you were as I am, I know not what you would doe: but if I were as you bee, I would behaue my ſelfe in ſuch ſorte to them of my houſe, that they ſhould be ſeruants, to ſerue and obey mee: and not to boaſt themſelues, to bee ſo farre in fauour as to commaund mee: For that Prince is not ſage, that to content a fewe getteth the hatred of all.
                     
                     The Emperour Valentinian dyed in the fiue and fiftie yeare of his byrth, and the eleuenth yeare of his Empire, The death of the Emperour. languiſhing of a long ſicknes, that his vaynes were ſo dryed vppe, that they could not drawe one drop of bloud out of his bodie. And at the day of his Funeralles, where the dead corps was greatly bewayled. Saint Ambroſe made an excellent Sermon, in commendation of him. For in thoſe dayes, when any Noble Prince departed, that loued and ſuccoured the Church, all the holy Biſhops met together at his buryall.
                     The two brethren beeing Emperours, that is to ſay, Valentinian and Valent, through the deſire of the Father in law of Gracian, who was father to his wife, and deſirous to haue one of his daughters childrē, choſe Valentiniā
                         to bring vp, who had a ſonne named Gracian, which was created Emperor ſo young, that as yet he had no beard. And truly the Senate would not haue ſuffered it, if the Father had not bin vertuous, and the childe ſage. But the Senate would haue done this, and more alſo for Valentinian, becauſe hee did deſerue it well of the Romaine people. For it is reaſon in diſtributing of the Offices, That Princes haue more repſect to the deſerts of the Fathers, then to the tender age of the Children.
                     
                     This young Gracian began to be ſo temperate, and was ſo good a Chriſtian in fauouring the Church, that it The wiſedome and diſcretion of young Gracian. was much quiet, and great pleaſure to the Romaine people to haue choſen him: and greater ioy to the Father, (being aliue) to haue begotten him: ſo that he left for him after his death, an immortall memorie of his life. For the childe that is vertuous, is alwayes the memorie of the Father after his death.
                     
                     In the yeare of the Foundation of Rome, a thouſand, an hundred, thirtie and two, the ſaid Gracian the younger was created ſole Heyre of the whole Empire, his vnckle Valent and his Father being departed the world. And after Gratian came to the Empire, many Biſhops which were baniſhed in the time of his Vnckle Valent, were reſtored to the Church againe, and banniſhed all the ſect of the Arrians out of his Region.
                     Truely he ſhewed himſelfe to bee a very religious and Catholike Prince. For there is no better iuſtice to confound humain malice, then to eſtabliſh the good in theyr eſtate.
                     
                     In the firſt yeare of the raigne of Gracian
                        
Emperour, all the Germanes and the Gothes rebelled againſt the Romane Empire, for they would not onely not obey him, but alſo they prepared an huge Army to inuade his Empire: Imagining that ſith Gracian was young, hee neyther had the wit, nor yet the boldneſſe to reſiſt them: For where the Prince is young, there oftentimes the people ſuffered 
                        The olde Prouerbe not alwayes true. 
                        much wrong, and the Realme great miſery,
                     
                     Newes came to Rome, how that the Gaules and Germaines were vp, the Emperour Gracian wrote to all the Catholike Biſhops, that they ſhould offer in their Churches great Sacrifices with prayers vnto God, and in Rome likewiſe it was ordayned, that generally proceſſions ſhould be had, to the end Almighty God ſhould moderate his ire againſt his people: For good Chriſtians firſt pacifie God with Prayers before they reſiſt their enemies with weapons. This good Prince ſhewed himſelfe to be no leſſe warlike in his outward affayres, then a good Chriſtian in his Religion: for God giueth victories vnto Princes more through tears then through weapons.
                     Theſe things thus finiſhed, and his affayres vnto God recommended, the noble Emperour Gracian determined to march on, and himſelfe in perſon to giue the battell. And truly as at the firſt hee ſhewed himſelfe to bee a good Chriſtian: ſo now he declared himſelfe to bee a valiant Emperour: For it were a great infamy and diſhonour, that a Prince by negligence or cowardnes ſhould loſe that which his Predeceſſors by force of armes had gotten. The army of the enemies exceeded farre the Romane army in number, and when they met together in a place called Argentaria, the Romaines being inferiour to their enemies in number, were afraide: For in the warres the great multitude of enemies and their puiſſant power, maketh ofttimes the deſired victorie to be doubtful. This thing ſeene of the Romanes, and by them conſidered, importunately they beſought the Emperour not to charge the battell, for they ſayde hee had not men ſufficient: And herein they had reaſon: For the ſage Prince ſhould not raſhly hazard his perſon in the warre: nor yet ſhould lightly put his life in the hands of Fortune. The Emperour Gracian not changing countenance, nor ſtopping in his words, to all the Knights which were about him, anſwered in this wiſe.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXVI. Of the godly Oration which the Emperour Gracian made to his Souldiers before hee gaue the battell.
                     
                     
                        VAliant Knights &amp; Companions in The Oration of the Emperour: warre, moſt thankefully I accept your ſeruice, in that you haue ſolde your goods, and do offer your liues here to accompany mee in the warres, and herein you ſhew your duties: for of right you ought to looſe your goods, and to venture your liues, for the defence and ſurety of your Country. But if I giue you ſome thanks for your company, know you that I giue much more for your good counſell which preſently you giue me: for in great conflicts ſeldome is found together, both good counſell and ſtout hearts. If I haue enterpriſed this battell in hope of mans power, then you had had reaſon that wee ſhould not giue the battell ſeeing the great multitude that they haue, and the ſmall number that wee are; for as you ſay, the weighty affayres

of the publike weale ſhould not vnaduiſedly bee committed to the incertainety of Fortune.
                     I haue taken vpon mee this daungerous and perillous warres: firſt truſting that on my part iuſticeremaineth, and ſith God is the ſame onely iuſtice, I truſt aſſuredly hee will giue mee the victory in this perillous conflict: For iuſtice auayleth Princes more that they haue, then the men of warre doe which they lead. Wherfore ſith my cauſe is iuſt, and that I haue God the onely Iudge therof on my ſide, me thinketh if for any worldly feare I ſhould ceaſe to giue the battell. I ſhould both ſhew my ſelfe to be a Prince of ſmall faith, and alſo blaſpheme God, ſaying hee were of ſmall iuſtice. For God ſheweth moſt his power there, where the fraileneſſe of man hath leaſt hope. Then ſith I beginne the warre, and that by mee the warre is procured, and for mee you are come to the warre, I haue determined to enter into the battell, and if I periſh therein, I ſhall bee ſure it ſhall bee for the memory of my perſon, and the ſaluation of my Soule: For to dye through iuſtice is not to dye, but to change death for life. And thus doing, if I loſe my life, yet therefore I loſe not my honour, and all this conſidered I doe that which for the Common-wealth I am bound, For to a Prince it were great infamy and diſhonour, that the quarrell being his owne, ſhould by the bloud of others be reuenged. I will proue this day in battell whether I was choſen Emperour by the diuine will or not: For if God this day cauſeth my life to bee taken frō me, it is a manifeſt token he hath a better in ſtore for me, and if through his mercy I be preſerued, it ſignifieth that for ſome other better thing he granteth me life. For in the end the ſword of the enemy is but the ſcourge of our offences. The beſt that I ſee therefore in this matter to bee done is, that till three dayes be paſſed the battell bee not giuen, and that wee confeſſe our ſelus this night, &amp; in the morning prepare our ſelus to receiue our Redeemer, and beſides this, that euery man pardon his Chriſtian brother, if he haue had any wrong or iniury done him: for oft times though the demaund of the war bee iuſt, yet many miſhaps befall therein, through the offences of thoſe which purſue &amp; follow the ſame.
                     After that three dayes are paſt, &amp; each thing according to my ſayings before accompliſhed in euery point as behoueth, then let God diſpoſe all things as hee ſhall ſee good, for now I am fully determined to aduenture my life in battell▪ Wherefore my valiant and ſtout warriours, doubt not at all, for this day I muſt eyther vanquiſh mine enemies, or elſe ſuffer death: and if I dye, I doe that which needes I muſt. Wherefore I will now ceaſe to exhort you any more, deſiring you to conſider that, whereunto your duties leadeth you, remembring that you are come as knights, and in the defence of your Country, you wage battell: for now we are come to that pinch, that deedes muſt more auaile The duety of euery good Souldier.
vs then words: for peace ought to be maintained by the tongue, but wars ought to be atchieued by ſword. Al theſe words then ended, and three dayes paſt, the Emperour in perſon gaue the battell, where the conflict &amp; ſlaughter on both ſides was very terrible: yet in the end the Emperour Gracian had the victory ouer his enemies, and there dyed in that conflict 30. thouſand Gothes and Almaines, and of the Romanes there were not ſlaine but fiue thouſand: For that Army only is preſerued, which to the diuine will is conformable. Let all other Princes take example by this noble Prince: let thē cōſider how it behoueth thē to be good
                        
                        Chriſtians, and that in great warres and conflicts they neede not feare the great number of their enemies: but they ought greatly to ſee that the wrath of God bee pacified: For the heart is more diſmaied with the ſecret ſinnes, then it is feared with the open enemies.

                        THe two brethren being Emperours, that is to ſay, Valentinian and Valente, in the coaſtes of Africke, &amp; the realme of Mauritania, a Tyrant vſurped the place of a King againſt the Romanes, who was named The tyranny of Thyrmus. 
                        Thyrmus, a man hardy in trauels, and in daungers ſtout: For the aduenturous hearts oftentimes doe commit many tyrannies.
                     This tyrant Thyrmus by much crueltie came poſſeſſed of the realme of Mauritania: and not contented therewith, but alſo by tyranny poſſeſſed a great part of Affricke, and prepared as (Hannibal did) an huge armie to paſſe into Italy, to dye in challenging the Empire of Rome.
                     
                     This was a renowmed Tyrant that neuer tooke pleaſure in any other thing ſo much, as to ſpoyle and robbe others of their goods.
                     The Romaines that in all their doings were very ſage, and of the tyranny of tyrants, ſufficiently moniſhed, immediately prepared a great Army to paſſe into Affricke, and to ſpoyle the realme, and to deſtroy the Tyrant by the commandement and decree of the Senate, and that for no pact or couenant the Tyrant ſhould liue. And without doubt this commaundement was iuſt: For to him that is a deſtroier of the Common-wealth, it is not puniſhment inough to take away his life.
                     At that time there was a Knight in Rome, whoſe name was Theodoſius, a man well ſtrucken in yeares, and yet better approued in warres, but he was not the richeſt: howbeit hee vaunted himſelfe (as truth was) to bee of the bloud of Traian the great Emperour, vpon which occaſion, he was greatly honoured and feared in Rome, for the Commons were ſo noble &amp; gracious towards their Princes, that all thoſe which from the good and vertuous Emperour deſcended, were of the whole Common-wealth greatly eſteemed.
                     This noble Theodoſius was of yeers ſo auncient, and ſo honoured in his olde age for his gray hayres, ſo noble of lynage, and ſo approued in warres, that he was by the authority of the Emperour Valentinian, by the conſent of al the Senate, and by the good wils of the whole people, choſen to to goe to the conqueſt of Affricke, &amp; truely their reaſon was good: For Theodoſius deſired much to fight againſt that Tyrant Thyrmus, and all the people were glad that ſuch a captaine led the Armie, So this Theodoſius imbarked with the Army, departed from Rome, and in fewe dayes arriued at Bona, which was a City greatly repleniſhed with people, ſituated in a hauen of the Sea in Affricke: And as he and his Army was landed, the tyrant Thyrmus forthwith encamped his Army in the field in the face

of the Romaines, and ſo all being planted in the plame, the one to aſſault, and the other to defend: immediatly the two Armies ioyned, and the one aſſaulting the other fiercely, on both ſides was great ſlaughter. So that thoſe which to day were conquered, to morrow did conquere: and thoſe which yeſterday were Conquerours, afterward remained conquered. For, in long warres Fortune chaungeth.
                     In the Prouince of Mauritania, there was a ſtrong Cittie called Obeliſta, and as the captaine Theodoſius, by his force occupyed all the Fielde, the Tyrant Thyrmus fortified himſelfe in the Citie, the which valiantly being aſſaulted of the Captain Theodoſius, and almoſt with his men, entring into the ſame: The Tyrant Thyrmus, (becauſe hee would not commit himſelfe vnto the faith of other men,) ſlewe himſelfe with his proper handes. For the The death of Thyrmus propertie of prowde and diſdainefull hearts, is rather to dye in libertie, then to liue in captiuitie.
                     At that time the Emperour Valent, by the arte of Nigromancie, wrought ſecretly, to knowe what lucke ſhould ſucceede in the Romane Empire. And by chaunce a certaine woman, (being an Enchauntereſſe,) had anſwer of the diuel, that that name which with theſe Letters ſhould bee written, ſhould be ſucceſſor to the Empire, and the Letters were theſe, T. E. O D: The Emperour Valent diligently enquired of all the names, which with theſe iiij. letters could be named? and they found that thoſe ſignified the Theodotes, the Theodores, and the Theodoſes: wherefore Valent forthwith put all thoſe to the ſword that were of that name.
                     Such was the wickednes of the Emperour Valent, ſuppoſing they would haue taken the Empire from him beeing aliue. For the tyrannous Prince liueth euer in iealouſie and ſuſpition.
                     The excellent Captaine Theodoſius, (the Tyrant Thyrmus being dead, and hauing ſubdued all Affricke to the Romane 
                        The wickednes of Valent. Empire) was burdened that hee was a ſecret Traytour to the Empire, and that hee compaſſed to winne the ſame by tiranny. For this cauſe therefore, the Emperour Valent gaue ſentence he ſhould be beheaded. And this was done, he neuer hearing of it, and much leſſe culpable thereof: For all Princes that are wilfull in their doings, are very abſolute of theyr ſentence. This came to the eares of Theodoſius, and ſeeing that he was condemned to be beheaded, hee ſent incontinent for the Byſhop of Carthage, of whom hee demaunded the water of holy Baptiſme, and ſo being baptiſed, and in the Faith of Chriſt inſtructed, was by the Hangman put to execurion. Of this ſo grieuous, outragious, and deteſtable Fact, euery man iudged this Theodoſius, to ſuffer as an innocent, and that the Emperour Valent had iudged euill, and like a Tyrant. For the innocencie of the good, is the great enemy of the euill.
                     At the ſame time, when Theodoſius demaunded Baptiſme, (according to the ſaying of Proſper in his chronicle) he ſaid vnto the Biſhop, which ſhould Baptiſe him, theſe words; O Biſhop 
                        The death of Theodoſius. 
                        Saint Roger, I doe Coniure thee, by the Creatour which made vs, and doe deſire thee for the Paſſion of IESƲ CHRIST, who redeemed vs, to giue me the water of Baptiſme: For I haue made a vowe to become a Chriſtian, if GOD graunted mee victorie, Wherefore I will accompliſh my vowes, for thoſe things which neceſſitie cauſeth vs to promiſe, our owne free will, ought to accompliſh. I am ſorrie with all my heart that being a Chriſtian, I can liue no longer, and ſith it is ſo, I offer my life for his ſake, and into his mercifull hands I commend my ſoule, I leaue a Sonne of mine who is called Theodoſius, and if the Fatherly loue beguyle me not, I thinke he will proue a vertuous and ſtout young
                        
                        man, and beſides that he will bee wiſe, and ſith by thy handes hee hath beene baptized, I require thee holy Father, that thou through thy wiſdom wilt bring him vp in the true faith: for if hee be a good Chriſtian, I truſt in God hee wil be a great man in the Empire.
                     
                     This Theodoſius was the Father of the great Emperor Theodoſius; ſo that the father was a Chriſtian, and the ſonne a Chriſtian.
                     Not long after the Emperour Valent had cauſed Theodoſius (which was father to the great Emperour Theodoſius) to bee executed, Valent by the commandement of God was by the Gothes perſecuted, and in the end put to death, and truely this was the iuſt The iudgement of God. iudgement of God. For he of right ſhould ſuffer death himſelfe, which vniuſtly procureth the death of others Rufinus in the ſecond booke of his hiſtories, ſaith, that after the Tyrant Thirmus was put to death by the captaine Theodoſius, and that the Emperour Valent had cauſed this Theodoſius to be put to death, and that the ſame Valent was ſlaine of the Gothes, the Romaines created a king in Africke, whoſe name was Hiſmarus, called for a right Chriſtian in that time, which was from the building of Rome, 377. There was in the City of Carthage a holy Biſhop called Silunaus, a man in humane and diuine letters excellently well learned, and ſith the King was ſo iuſt, and the Biſhop ſo holy, both the faith encreaſed, and alſo the affayres of the Common weale proſpered: For commonly the warres beginne rather through the pride of the higheſt, then through diſobedience in the loweſt. Therefore this holy Biſhoppe and good Chriſtian King, being deſirous in their time to giue good examples to the ſubiects, &amp; for the time to come to leaue good precepts, they celebrated in the City of Bona a Councell, with all the Biſhops of Affrikce, in the which King Hiſmarus was in perſon: For in ancient Councels the Kings were not onely there in perſons, but alſo all the Lords and high Eſtates of theyr Realmes.
                     Amongſt many excellent things which Rufinus mentioneth that were ordayned in this place, it ſeemed good vnto me to remēber heere theſe few, to the end Chriſtian Princes now preſent, may ſee what deuoute Chriſtians thoſe Kings were in times paſt.
                     
                        
                           A collection or purport of the Counſell of Hyponenſe.
                        
                           THeſe were the thinges which in the ſacred Councell of Hyponenſe were ordayned, where there was in perſon the Catholike King Hiſmarus, and the religious Biſhoppe Siluanus, and in that which was ordained, the King ſpake in ſome of them, and doth counſell in other ſome: becauſe in ſuch ſemblable affayres, it is both meete and requiſite, that the royall preheminence be reuerenced, and the authority of the Church not diminiſhed.
                        We ordaine that from two yeares to two yeares, all the Biſhoppes, Abbots, and 
                           The lawes ordained by the Counſel of Hyponenſe. 
                           Prelates of our Realme doe aſſemble, and celebrate a Prouinciall counſell, and that in this counſell there be no temporall matters ſpoken of, but of the diſorders and miſgouernances of Churches: For the Church is not loſt for the lacke or ſcarſitie of Money, but for the too great aboundance of riches.
                        
                        We ordaine, that all Prelates which are now and ſhall be hereafter, wee deſire that when they will call any counſell in our
                           
                           Realmes, that before the celebration of the ſame they certifie vs, leſt vnder that colour or cloake of a holy Counſel, there ſhould ſome ſuſpicious Aſſemblie bee had.
                        
                        Wee ordaine that from henceforth the Princes and great Lords be bound to repaire to the ſacred Counſell, with all the company of the holy Biſhops. For it were more meete they ſhould come to deſtroy falſe Heretickes, in winning their ſoules, then to fight againſt their Enemyes, in loſing theyr liues.
                        
                        Wee ordaine that the Prince which commeth not to the counſels through negligence, that vnto him the Sacrament of the Bodie of Chriſt be not miniſtred, vntill the next counſell be celebrated. And if perchance hee refuſe not to come through negligence, but through malice, wee will that they proceed againſt him as a ſuſpect perſon in the Faith of Chriſt, For the Chriſtian Prince that of malice only committeth an offence is not perfite in the holie Catholike Faith.
                        
                        Wee ordaine, that at the firſt aſſemblie of the Counſell, all the Prelates together openly, and afterwards eache one by himſelfe priuately ſhall ſay the Creede ſinging, the which thing finiſhed, the King himſelfe alone ſhall ſay the Creede likewiſe. For if the Prince be ſuſpected of the holy Catholike Faith, it is vnpoſſible that his people ſhould bee good Chriſtians.
                        
                        Wee ordaine, that in this Counſell the Prelates haue libertie and authortie to ſay vnto the King that that is comely and decent: and the King likewiſe to ſay in the Counſell what he thinketh beſt, ſo that the Prelates might tell the King without feare of his little care, he hath in deſtroying the Heretickes, and Hereſies of his Realme: and likewiſe the King might tell the Prelates their negligence that they vſe in the charge of their flocke. For the end and intention of Counſells ought not to be any otherwiſe then a ſcourge for offences paſt, and a reformation of the euils to come.
                        
                        We ordaine, that all the Princes of Affricke, immediately before they doe any other thing in the morning, doe openly and diligently come to Morning prayer. 
                           What is required of euery true Chriſtian. And wee will alſo, that there be preſent all his Courtiers, and priuate Counſellors, which with thē ought to enter into counſell. For that creature cannot giue any good counſell, who hath not reconciled himſelfe vnto God before
                        
                        Wee ordaine that the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Abbottes, continually, during the time of the counſell, doe euery day confeſſe themſelues to Almighty God, ſeruing him deuoutly: and that one of them doe preach vnto the people Gods word. For if euery Prelate bee bound to giue good example alone, then beeing all together, they ſhall giue it much better.
                        
                        Wee ordaine, that Princes (as much as lyeth in them) doe giue vnto their ſubiects good examples, and that on the Sabboth day in eſpeciall and other Feaſtiualldayes, they repayre vnto the Cathedrall Church, to heare diuine Seruice: and there reconciling themſelues to God, that they do publikely, in the preſence of the congregation, receyue the holy Communion and Supper of the Lord. For it would bee a great ſlander to Princes, which ought to reprehend others of theyr faultes, that a man ſhould neuer ſee them come to the Church, and be partakers of the holy Sacrament.
                        
                        Wee ordaine, that al Eaſter chiefly Princes doe goe to the church Cathedrall, and that the Metropolitane bee there in perſon, to celebrate the holy Communion: and the Goſpell beeing ſaid, the Prince himſelfe ſhalbe bound to ſay with a lowde voyce the Creede, confirmed in the ſacred counſell of Nicene: For that good Princes ought not only in theyr hearts to befaithful vnto IESƲS CHRIST, but are alſo bound openly with theyr mouthes to confeſſe it before the people.
                        
                        Wee ordaine, that Princes be not ſo hardie, to haue in their Court aboue two Biſhops: the one to giue him ghoſtly counſell,
                           
                           and the other to preach vnto him the word of God. And thoſe we will that the Councell aſſigne vnto him, and that they bee bound to finde two perſons of the moſt ancient and vertuous, which ſhall remaine in the Court no more but two yeares, and that afterwards others be placed there in their ſteades: For there is nothing more monſtrous, then to ſee the Church long without Prelates
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXVIII. What a godly thing it is to haue but one Prince to rule the publike weale: for there is no greater enemie to the common weale, then hee which procureth many to commaund therein, as by reaſons following it ſhall be proued,
                     
                     
                        OFt times with my ſelfe alone I conſider, that ſith the diuine prouidence, which dooth all No reſpect of perſons with God. things by weight &amp; meaſure, and that of her, and none other all creatures are ruled and gouerned, and that furthermore with God, there is no exception of perſons; for hee maketh the one rich, and the other poore: the one ſage, and the other ſimple: the one whole, and the other ſicke, the one fortunate, and the other vnlucky: the one ſeruant, and the other maſter: And let no man maruell though I muſe thereat: for the variety of time is the beginner of diſſentions among the people.
                     In mans iudgement it ſeemeth, that it were better all were alike in apparrell, all equall in commaunding, none greater then others in poſſeſſions, all to content themſelues with one kind of meate, and that the names commaunding and obeying were vtterly aboliſhed &amp; brought to naught. So that if the miſeries of the one, and proſperities of the other, were put out from that day forward, I proteſt there ſhould bee no enuy in the World.
                     Laying aſide mans opinion (which ought not to be compared to the diuine myſtery;) I demand now what reaſon ſufficed to thinke, that of two brethren (that is to ſay, Iacob and Eſau, both children of holy and deuout perſons) the diuine prouidence would the one ſhould be choſen, and the other deſpiſed, that the one ſhould commaund and the other obey, the one to be diſinherited beeing the eldeſt, and the other to inherite being the youngeſt? That which chaunced to Iacob with Eſau, the ſame chaunced to the children of Iacob and Ioſeph: who being partaker and choſen, God prouided and ordayned that to Ioſeph beeing the youngeſt, his brethren ſhould ſerue and obey him.
                     This thing was repined at of all the eleuen brethren, howbeit their intentions auayled not: for it is vnpoſsible for mans malice to diſorder that, which the diuine prouidence hath Man may purpoſe, but God diſpoſeth. appointed: wee ſee dayly nothing elſe but that which man decreeth in a long time God diſpoſeth otherwiſe in one moment. Truly it is not euill done, but well ordained. For in the end, ſith man is man, in few things hee can be eyther certaine or aſſured: and ſith God is God, it is vnpoſſible that in any thing hee ſhould erre. It is a great benefite of the Creator, to bee willing to reforme and correct the words of the Creatures. For if God would ſuffer vs to doe after our owne mindes, wee ſhould bee quite contrary to his pleaſure.
                     God without a great miſtery did not ordayne, that in one family there ſhould bee but one Father, among one people there ſhould be but one

Cittizen that ſhould commaund, in one Prouince there ſhould be but one Gouernour alone, and alſo that one King alone ſhould gouerne a prowde Realme, and alſo that by one onely Captaine a puiſſant Armie ſhould be ledde.
                     And furthermore and aboue all, he willeth that there bee but one Monarchiall King and Lord of the Worlde: Truely all theſe things are ſuch, that wee with our eyes doe ſee them, and know them not: wee heare them with our eares, and vnderſtand them not: we ſpeake them with our tongues, and knowe not what wee ſay. For truely mans vnderſtanding is ſo dull, that without doubt he is ignorant of more then he knoweth.
                     
                        Appolonius Thyaneus compaſſing the moſt part of Aſia, Affrike, and Europe: That is to ſay, from the bridge of Nilus, where Alexander was, vnto Gades where the pillers of Hercules were, hee beeing one day in Epheſe, in the Temple of Diana, the Prieſtes asked him, what thing hee wondered at moſt in all the world? For it is a general rule, that men which haue ſeene much, alwayes doe note one thing aboue another.
                     Although the Phyloſopher Appolonius greatlyer eſteemed the workes, then the ſpeaking of them that demanded the queſtion, yet foorthwith hee made them this anſwere.
                     
                        I let you know Prieſts of Diana, that I haue bin throughout France, England, Spayne, Germanie, through the Laces The ſpeech of Appolonius. 
                        and Lydians, Hebrues &amp; Greeks, Parthes &amp; Medes, Phrygians, and Corinthiās, and ſo with the Perſians, &amp; aboue in all the great Realme of India: For that alone is more woorth then all theſe Realms together. I will you vnderſtand that all theſe Realmes in many and ſundry things doe differ, as in languages, perſons, beaſts, mettals, waters, fleſh, cuſtoms, Lawes, Lands, buildings, in Apparell, and Forts, and aboue all, diuers in their Gods and Temples,
                     
                     
                        For the Language of the one differeth not ſo much from the language of the other, as the Gods of Europe, differ from the Gods of Aſia, and the Temples and Gods of Aſia and Europe, differ from them of Affricke. Amongſt all things which I haue ſeene, of two onely I did maruell, which is, that in all the parts of the world wherein I haue trauailed, I haue ſeene quiet men troubled by ſeditious perſons: the humble, ſubiect to the proude: the iuſt, obedient to the Tyrant. I haue ſeene the cruell, commaunding the mercifull: the coward ruling the hardie, the ignorant teaching the wiſe: and aboue all, I ſaw that the moſt Thieues did hang the innocent on the gallowes.
                     
                     The other thing whereat I maruelled, was this, That in all the places and 
                        A wort ſaving, 
                              〈◊〉
                            worthie obſeruation. 
                        where I haue bene, I knowe not, neyther could I finde any man that was euerlaſting, but that all are mortall, and in the end both high and low haue an ende: For manie are layd too night in theyr graue, which the next Day following thought to bè aliue.
                     
                     Leaue aſide the diuine iudgement, in that hee ſpake, hee ſaid highly, and like a Philoſopher: for it ſeemeth to bee a pleaſant thing, to ſee how men gouerne the World.
                     Therefore now to the matter: It is but reaſon we know the cauſe of this ſo ancient a noueltie, which is, That God willeth and ordayneth, that one onely command all, and that all together obey one. For there is nothing that God doeth (although the cauſe thereof bee vnknowne vnto vs), that wanteth reaſon in his Eternall wiſedome.
                     In this caſe (ſpeaking like a Chriſtian, I ſay) that if our Father Adam had What we loſt by the fall of Adam. obeyed one onely Commaundement of Almightie GOD, which was forbidden in the Terreſtriall Paradiſe, we had remained in liberty vpō the earth,

and ſhould haue bin Lords and maiſters ouer all; But ſith hee would not then obey the LORD, wee are now become the abiects and ſlaues of ſo many Lords.
                     
                        Oh wicked ſinne, accurſed be thou, ſith by thee onely the Worlde is brought into ſuch a bondage: without teares I cannot ſpeake that which I would, that through our firſt Fathers, (which ſubmitted themſelues to ſinne) we their childrē haue loſt the Seignoric of the world. For ſith they were priſoners vnto ſinne in their ſoules little auaileth the libertie of their bodies.
                     
                     There was great diuerſitie betwixt the opinions of Pythagoras, and the opinions of Socrates, for ſo much as thoſe of Socrates ſchoole ſaid: That it were better all things ſhould be common, and all men equall.
                     
                     The other of Pythagoras ſchole ſaide The difference of opinions. the contrarie: And that the Commonwealth were better, wherein each one had his owne proper, and all ſhould obey one, ſo that the one of them did admitte and graunt the name of ſeruants, and the others did deſpiſe the name of Lords,
                     
                     As Laertius in his firſt booke of the liſe of Phyloſophers, ſaide: that the Phyloſopher Demoſthenes was alſo of the ſame opinion, that to the ende the people ſhould be well gouerned, hee would two names ſhould be vtterly aboliſhed, and taken away: That is to ſay, Lords and ſubiects, Maiſters and ſeruants: For, the one deſirous to rule by fierceneſſe, and the others not willing to obey to tyrannie, would ſhed the bloud of the innocent, and would be violent againſt the poore: They would deſtroy the renowmed, and famous people, and Tyrannie would waxe ſtoute, the which things ſhould be taken away, if there were no ſeignorie, nor ſeruitude in the world: But notwithſtanding theſe things, the Philoſopher in his firſt booke of his Pollitiques, ſaith: That by foure naturall reaſons wee may prooue it to be very neceſſarie, that Princes doe commaund, and the people obey.
                     
                     The firſt reaſon is, of the parts of the Elements, ſimple, and mixt. For wee ſee by experience, that the Elements doe ſuffer, (to the ende they would be ioyned together) the one to haue more power then all: the which is ſhewed by experience. Foraſmuch as the Element of the Fire, the Element of the Ayre, and the Element of the Water doe obey, the Element of the Earth doth commaund.
                     For againſt their nature he bringeth them all to the Earth. But if all the noble and chiefeſt Elements were obedient to the moſt vile Element, only to forme a bodie mixt, it is a greater reaſon, that all obey to one vertuous perſon, that the Common-wealth might therby the better be gouerned,
                     The ſecond reaſon is, of the bodie and the ſoule, in the harmonie wherof the Soule is the miſtreſſe which commaundeth, The ſoule miſtreſſe of the body. and the bodie the ſeruant, which obeyeth: For the bodie neyther ſeeth, heareth, nor vnderſtandeth without the bodie.
                     The ſage Philoſopher by this inferreth, that the ſage men ſhould naturally be Lords ouer others. For in the world there is nothing more monſterous, then that Fooles ſhould commaund, and wiſe men obey.
                     The third reaſon taketh his ground on beaſts: For wee ſee by experience, that diuers beaſts by the onely knowledge of men are gouerned: therefore it is but meete that many men, which are more liker Beaſtes then the beaſts themſelues, do ſuffer themſelues to be gouerned and ruled by wiſe men. For the Commonweale is more profited by a brute beaſt, then it is by witles men. The 4. reaſon proceedeth of women: For we ſee, that they being created to the image of GOD, God cōmandeth &amp; ordaineth, that they ſhould be ſubiect to man, preſuppoſing their knowledge

not to be ſo great, as the knowledge of men. Therefore if this thing bee thus, why could not diuers mortaſl men (who without compariſon know leſſe then women) take themſelues for happy, that one alone would commaund and gouerne them: ſo that ſuch a one were a ſage and vertuous perſon.
                     Sith man is naturally politique, which is to bee a friend of company: the company engendreth enuie, and afterwardes diſcord nouriſheth war, and warre bringeth in tyranny, and tyranny deſtroyeth the Commonwealth: and the Common-wealth being loſt, all men thinke their liues in perill.
                     Therefore it is very neceſſary, that in the Common-wealth many bee gouerned by one alone: For to What is required in the gouernemēt of the common wealth. conclude, There is no Commonwealth well gouerned but by one alone. The great trauels and inconueniences which the Auncients found in times paſt, were the occaſiſion that it was ordayned in the publike weale, that all ſhould obey one: Sith that in a Campe one onely Captaine is obeyed, and in the Sea one Pilot followed, In the Monaſtery all obey one Prelate, and in the Church all obey one Biſhoppe; and ſince in a Hiue of Bees, one Bee onely leadeth all the reſt: It were not reaſon that men ſhould bee without one King, nor the Common-wealth without a Gouernour.
                     Theſe men that will not haue a King in a Common-wealth, are like vnto drones and waſpes, which without trauell eate the ſweate of others. And my opinion in this caſe ſhould be, that euery man that will not bee commanded, as an abiect of the common weale ſhould bee expulſed and caſt out thereof: For in a commonwealth there can bee no greater enemie then hee that deſireth that many ſhould rule therein. In that publike Weale, where one alone hath care for all, and all obey the commandements of one onely, there God ſhall bee ſerued, the people ſhall profit, the good ſhal bee eſteemed, and the euill deſpiſed, and beſides the Tyrantes ſhall bee ſuppreſſed. For a gouernance of many is not profitable, vnleſſe they refer themſelues to the iudgement of a few, and to the arbitrement of one alone. Oh how many people &amp; realms (becauſe they would not obey their Princes by iuſtice) haue ſince by cruell tyrants been gouerned with tyranny: For it is euen a iuſt plague, that they which deſire the ſcepters of righteous Princes, ſhould feele and proue the ſcourge of cruell tyrants. Alwaies it was, and ſhall be, that in the world, there was one to command, another to obey, one to gouerne, and another to be gouerned.
                     In this caſe let no man ſay, I am excepted: for vntill this day there hath no Prince nor Knight bin ſeene, but hath trauelled vnder this yoake: I warne and pray, and importunately require you all, that you be loyall, and faithfull ſeruants, to the end you may deſerue to haue louing Lords: For the Prince that is wicked cauſeth his ſubiects to rebel, &amp; the ſeditious ſubiect maketh his Lord becom a tyrant. It is a great thing to the people, their Princes be good or euill: For there are no Princes ſo ſtable, that alwayes wil diſemble the euill: nor there is no gouernor ſo very a tyrant, but ſomtimes will acknowledge 
                        God ſuffereth euill Gouernors for the offences of the people. 
                        the good. Oftentimes God ſuffereth that there be Emperors in the Empire, Kings in Realms, Lords in Cities, and Prelates in Churches, not all only as the Common wealth deſireth, nor as the good gouernment requireth, but as the offence of the multitude deſerueth: For we ſee many that haue the charge of ſoules, which deſerue not to keepe the ſheepe: That to be true, plainly appears:

For ſuch doe not gouerne but diſorder, they doe not defend but offend: they doe not reſiſt the enemies, but engage and fell the innocent: they are no Iudges but Tyrants: they are not gentle Paſtors but cruell Hangmen: they are not encreaſers of the Common-wealth, but deſtroyers of Iuſtice: they are not ordayners, of the Lawes but inuentors of tributes: their hearts wake not to good, but to inuent and worke all miſchiefe. And finally, God ſendeth vs ſuch Prelates and Gouernours, not for that they ſhould bee Miniſters of his lawes, but for that they ſhould bee ſcourgers of our offences.

                        IN the firſt booke of the Kings, the 8. Chapter, of the holy 1 Reg. 8. and ſacred ſcripture is ſayde: that Samuel (when hee was olde) in his ſtead placed his two ſonnes to gouerne the people, whoſe names were Iohel and Abiah, for that naturally the Fathers are deſirous to aduance their childrē to honour.
                     The ſonnes of Samuel were reſident and held the iudgement in the City of Beerſheba, which was the furtheſt part of Iudea, and the olde Samuel went to dwell in the City Ramah. The honourable and moſt auncient men, (among the people of Ieruſalem) aſſembled together, and decreede to ſend Ambaſſadours to Samuel, which ſhould bee the wiſeſt men of all the Synagogue: for the ancients in thoſe dayes were ſo circumſpect, that they neuer committed any affayres in the common wealth into the handes of young men. The Ancients then being arriued at Ramah, ſpake theſe words vnto Samuel.
                     
                     
                        Samuel, thou art now olde, and for thy yeares thou canſt not gouern the people, therefore thou like a pittifull Father haſt committed the gouernement of the people into the hands of thy children.
                     
                     
                        Wherfore we let thee know in this caſe, that thy children are couetous. Firſt, they doe receyue bribes of the ſuters. And ſecondarily, they doe great iniurie to the people: Therefore wee are come to require thee to giue vnto vs a King that may gouerne vs, and that might leade vs in battell: for we will no more Iudges to iudge vs, but Kings for to gouerne vs.
                     
                     The aged Samuel hearing the ambaſſage, was aſhamed of that the Ancients of Iudea had tolde him: firſt ſeeing his children to bee euill: Secondarily, becauſe they would take their offices from them, And truely herein Samuel had iuſt occaſion, both to bee aſhamed, and alſo ſorry.
                     For the enormities, vices and wickedneſſe of the young children The folly of youth. are ſwords that paſſe through the hearts of the old and auncient Fathers. Samuel ſeeing that the Hebrewes were determined to depriue them of their office, and gouernement of the people, had none other remedy but euen to make his mone to God of his griefe, and God hearing his complaints, ſaid vnto him: Samuel. Be not ſad, nor lament not, for their demaunding a King (as they doe) they doe not miſlike thy perſon, but they diſprayſe my prouidence, and maruell not though they forſake thy children, for they are ſomewhat too young, ſith they haue forſaken mee their God, and worſhip falſe Idols. Sith they demaund a King. I haue determined to giue them
                        
                        one, but firſt tell to them the conditions of the King, which are theſe.
                     
                     
                        The King whom I will giue you, ſhall take your Children, with your Charriots and beaſts, and ſhall ſend them loaden with burdens. And yet therewith not contented, hee ſhall make your children poaſtes by the way, Tribunes and Centurions in his Battells, and ſhal make them labourers and gardeners in his gardens, he ſhal make them ſow his ſeeds, &amp; paſte his bread, and furbiſh his harnes, and Armor.
                     
                     
                        You ſhall haue beſides both delicate and tender daughters, the which you ſhall little enioy: For the King that I will giue you, ſhall commaund them to keepe and attend 
                        The power and 
                              〈…〉
                            of a King. 
                        thoſe that are wounded in the wars, hee ſhall make them Cookes in his Pallace, and Caters of his expences.
                     
                     
                        The King that I will giue you, if hee handle your Sonnes and Daughters euil, much worſe hee will handle your goods. For on the beaſts and fertile Fieldes that you haue his Heard ſhall feede, he ſhal gather the beſt grapes of your vines, he ſhall chooſe of your Oliue trees the beſt olyues and oyles. And if any fruit afterwards remaine in your fieldes, hee will they ſhall bee gathered, not by you, but of his workemen: And afterwards the King that I wil giue you ſhal oppreſſe you much more.
                     
                     
                        For of euery pecke of corne, you ſhal giue him one, of ten ſheepe you muſt needes giue him one: ſo that of all things which you ſhal gather againſt your wils, you ſhal giue the tenth. Of your Slaues the King ſhall be ſerued ſooner then you: and he ſhall take all your Oxen that labour, and trauaile in your owne Poſſeſſions, and ſhall bring them to plough in his owne ground and tenements. So that you ſhall pay tribute, &amp; the King ſhall take his owne profit, for the wealth and commoditie of his Pallace.
                     
                     And all this which I haue rehearſed before, the King ſhall haue whom I will giue you. The Hiſtorie which here I haue declared, is not Ouid, nor yet the Eglogges of 
                           Ʋirgil, nor yet the fayning of Homer; but it is the ſentence and the very word of God.
                     O mortall ignoraunce, that wee demaund and know not why nor wherefore, to whom nor where, neither whē wee demaund, which cauſeth men to runne into ſundry errours. For fewe men are ſo wiſe that they offend not in chooſing, and that they can aske with reaſon. The folly of men.
                     
                     The Hebrewes asked (as they thinke) the better, and GOD giueth them the worſe, they aske one to gouern them, and God giueth them a Tyrant to deſtroy them: they aske one that ſhould maintaine them in Iuſtice, and hee threatneth them with tyrannie: they require one that ſhuld giue them, and hee giueth them one which robbeth them: They require one to deliuer them from bondage, &amp; hee ordaineth one to keepe them as ſlaues.
                     And finally, the Hebrewes truſting to be deliured of their Iudges, which ruled not according to their appetits. God ſhal giue thē a king that ſhal take away their goods from them by force.
                     Oh how many times ought wee to pray vnto GOD, to giue vs Princes in our Common-wealth, and Prelates in our Churches, which doe knowe how to gouerne vs, and miniſter vnto vs: How much we are boūd to pray vnto God for good Gouernors. not according to the weight of our ſoule, but according to the meaſure of his mercie?
                     
                        Plato ſaith in the firſt booke of lawes, that one of the moſt Excellent lawes which the Siciones had in theyr Prouince, was, to keepe their Cities, that they ſhould not chaunge nor alter any thing therein.
                     Truely thoſe Barbarous were ſage, in theyr doing: and Plato was very diſcreete to commende them therein; For nothing deſtroyeth a Commonwealth ſooner then to ſuffer chaunges ofttimes therein.
                     All theſe things ſeemed to bee true in the Hebrues, the which in their gouernment were very raſh and vndiſcrete.
                     
                        
For firſt they gouerned themſelues by Patriarckes, as Abraham was. After they were gouerned by Prophets, as Moſes. By Captaines, as Ioſuab: by Iudges, as Gedeon: by Kings, as Dauid: and after they gouerned themſelues by Byſhops, as Abdias was, and in the ende the Hebrewes not contented with all theſe, GOD ſuffered that they ſhould fal into the hāds of Antichus, Ptholomeus, &amp; Herodes, all Tirants.
                     This puniſhment fell (according to the iuſt iudgement of God) vpon them for theyr offences: for it was euen meete, that they that would not enioy the pleaſant libertie of Iudea, ſhould taſte the cruell ſeruitude of Babylon.
                     
                     The condition which chaunced in the gouernment, to the vnconſtant Hebrewes, the ſame happened vnto the proud Romains. The which in the beginning of their Empire were gouerned by Kings: afterwards by x. men: The gouernment of Rome. Then by the Conſuls: ſo by the Dictators: by the Cenſors: and afterwards, by the Tribunes, and Senators: and in the ende, they came to be gouerned by Emperours, and tyrannous Princes. The Romaines inuented all theſe alterations in their gouernmēts, for none other cauſe, but to ſee whether they could be deliuered from the commaundement of another. For the Romains in this caſe were ſo proud harted, that they had rather dye in libertie, then liue in captiuitie: God had ſo ordained it, and their wofull caſe did ſo promiſe it, when they were aboue all other Kings and Realmes of the Earth, that then the ſlaue ſhould be obedient to his yrons, and the ſubiect ſhould acknowledge the homage to his Maſter. And though that ſubiects doe moue warres, though Kings alſo do winne Realms, and Emperors conquer Empires: yet wil they, or nill they, both great and ſmall, ſhould acknowledge themſelues for ſeruants.
                     For during the time of our fleſhly life, we can neuer withdraw our ſelue from the yoke of ſeruitude. And ſay not you Princes, for that you are puiſſant Princes, that you are exempted from ſeruitude of men. For without doubt it is a thing more vntollerable, to haue theyr hearts burdened with thoughts, then their necks loden with The care of Princes. yrons.
                     If a ſlaue be good, they take from him ſome yrons: but to you that are Princes, the greater you are, the greater cares you haue. For the prince that for his Common-wealth taketh care, hath not one momēt of an houre quiet. A ſlaue hopeth to be deliuered in his life, but you cannot looke to be deliuered till after your death. They lay yrons on the ſlaue by weight, but thoughts burden you without meaſure. For the wofull hart is more burdened with one houre of care, then the body is preſſed with twēty pound of yron. A ſlaue or priſoner if hee be alone, many times fyleth off his yrons but you Princes when you are alone, are more grieuouſly tormented with thoughts: For ſolitary places are Arbours and Gardeins, to wofull and heauie hearts.
                     A ſlaue hath nothing to care for but himſelfe alone: but you that be princes haue to ſatisfie and pleaſe all men, For the Prince ſhould haue a time for himſelfe, and alſo for thoſe which are about him.
                     The diuine Plato ſaid well, that hee that ſhould haue the leaſt parte of a Prince, and belonging to a Prince, ought to be the Prince himſelfe. For to that ende the Prince ſhould bee all his owne, he ought to haue no part in himſelfe.
                     Though a ſlaue work &amp; trauel in the day, yet he ſleepes without care in the night: but you Princes paſſe the time in hearing importunate ſuites, and the nights in fetching innumerable ſighs.
                     
                        
Finally, I ſay, that in a ſlaue (be it well, or be it euill) all his paine is finiſhed in one yeare, or is ended at his death; but what ſhall a wofull Prince doe when he dyeth. If he were good there is but a ſhort memory of his goodneſſe: and if hee hath beene euill, his infamy ſhall neuer haue end.
                     I haue ſpoken theſe things to the end that great and ſmall, Lords and ſeruants ſhould confeſſe and acknowledge, the true Seigniory to be onely vnto him, who for to make vs Lords aboue, became a ſeruant heere beneath.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXX. When the Tyrants beganne to ratgne, and vpon what occaſion commaunding, and obeying firſt begann. And how the authority which the Prince hath, is by the ordinance of God.
                     
                     
                        CEaſing to ſpeake any further of the Poeticall Hiſtories, and auncient faynings, and ſpeaking the truth, according to the diuine Hiſtories, the firſt that did liue in this World, was our Father Adam, who did eate of the fruite forbidden, and that not ſo much for to treſpaſſe the commaundement of one, as for not to diſpleaſe his wife Eue: For many now a dayes, had rather ſuffer theyr conſcience a long time to bee infected: then one onely day to ſee theyr wiues diſpleaſed.
                     The firſt homicide of the worlde was Caine: The firſt that dyed in the World was Abel: The firſt that had two wiues in the World was Lamech. The firſt City of the World was by Enoch built in the fields of Edon: The firſt Muſition was Tubalcaim: The firſt which ſayled in the World, was Noe: The firſt Tyrant of the World was Nembroth: The firſt Prieſt was Melcriſedech: The firſt King of the World was Anraphel: The firſt Duke was Moyſes: The firſt which was called Emperour in the World, was Iulius Caeſar. For vntill this time, they which gouerned, were called Conſuls, Cenſors and Dictators. And from Iulius Caeſars hitherto haue beene called Emperours.
                     The firſt battell that was giuen in the world (as wee reade) was in the wilde valleyes, which now they call the dead and ſalt ſea: For a great part of that, that then was the maine land is novv the dead ſea. The holy Scriptures cannot deceyue vs, for it is full of all truth, and by them it is declared, that eighteene hundred yeares after the World beganne, there was no battell aſſembled, nor company that met to fight in the field: for at that time when they had no ambition nor couetouſneſſe, they knew not what battell meant.
                     It is reaſon therefore that in this writing we declare the cauſe, why the firſt battell was fought in the world, to the end Princes may thereof bee aduertiſed, and the curious Reader remaine therein ſatisfied.
                     The manner was this, that Baſſa being King of Sodome, Berſa King of The reaſon why warres firſt began. 
                        Gomorrhe, Senaab King of Adamee Semebar King of Seboime, and Vale King of Segor, were all fiue Tributaries to Chodor Lanmor King of the Elamites, which fiue Kings conſpired againſt him, becauſe they would pay him no tribute, and becauſe that they would acknowledge no homage vnto him. For the realmes paying tribute, haue alwayes rebelled and ſowed ſedition.
                     This rebellion was in the 13,

yeare of the raigne of Chodor Laomor, King of the Elamites, and immediately the yeare following, Anraphel king of Sernaar, Arioch king of Ponte, and Aradal King of the Allotali, ioyned with Chodor Laomor. All which together beganne to make warres, to deſtroy Cities and Countries vpon their enemies.
                     For the olde malice of the warre is, That where they cannot haue their enemies which are in the fault, they put to ſacke and deſtroy thoſe which are innocent and guiltleſſe.
                     
                     So the one aſſaulting, and the other deſending, in the end all come to the field, they gaue battell as two enemies, and the greateſt part was ouercome of the feweſt, and the feweſt remayned victorious ouer the greateſt, which thing God would ſuffer in the firſt battell of the world, to the end Princes might take example, that all the miſhappes of the Warres come not, but becauſe they are begun of an vniuſt occaſion.
                     If Chodor Laomor had helde himſelfe contented as his Predeceſſors did, and that hee had not conquered Realmes in making them ſubiect, and had not cauſed them to pay tribute, neyther they vnto him would haue denyed reaſon: nor hee with them would haue waged battell. For thorow the couetouſneſſe of the one, and the ambition of the other, enmities grew betweene the people.
                     This conſidered which wee haue ſpoken of Sygnorie, and of thoſe which came into contentions for ſignories.
                     Let vs now ſee from whence the firſt originall of ſeruitude came, and the names of ſeruantes and Lordes How ſeruitude began. which were in the old time, and whether ſeruitude was by the diſcorde of vertuous men, firſt brought into the World, or elſe inuented by the ambition of tyrants: for when the one commaundeth, and the other obeyeth, it is one of the nouelties of the world, as the holy Scripture declareth vnto vs in this manner. The holy Patriarch Noah had three ſons, which were Sam, Ham, and Iaphet: and the ſecond ſonne (which was Ham) begot Cuſn, and this Cuſn begotte Nimrod, Nimrod made himſelfe a Hunter of wilde beaſts in the woodes and mountaines: Hee was the firſt that beganne to play the Tyrant amongſt men, enforcing their perſons and taking their goods: and the Scripture called him Oppreſſor hominum, which is to ſay, an Oppreſſor The firſt tyrant that euer was. of men: For men of euill life alwaies commit much euill in a Commonwealth.
                     He taught the Chaldeans to honor the fire, hee was the firſt that preſumed to be an abſolute Lord, and the firſt that euer required of men homage and ſeruice.
                     This curſed tyrant ended his life in the golden World, wherein all things were in common, with the Common-wealth: For the Auncients vſed their goods in common: but their wils onely they reſerued to themſelues. They ought not ſo thinke in a light matter, for his perſō to haue been a tyrant, but they ought to think it a greater matter, to haue beene a rebel in a Common-wealth: &amp; much more they ought to eſteeme it as an euill matter in him, which hath beene (as hee was) a diſturber of the good cuſtomes of his country: but the moſt vniuſt of all is, to leaue behind him any euil cuſtom brought into the common wealth: for if hee deſerue great infamy which worketh euil in his life: truly he deſerueth much more, which trauelleth to bring that euill in vre after his death. Euſebius ſeemeth to affirm, that after Nimrod had deſtroied the realm of Chaldea by his plagues, came to Italy with 8. ſons, &amp; built the

of Cameſa, which afterwards, in Saturnes time was called Valentia, and in the time of Romulus it was called as it is at this preſent, Rome. And ſith this thing was thus, a man ought not to maruell, that Rome in auncient time was poſſeſſed with Tyrants, and with Tyrants beaten downe, ſince by ſo ſo famous and renowmed tyrants it was founded. For euen as Hieruſalem was the daughter of the patient, and the manſion of the quiet Kinges in Aſia: ſo was Rome the mother of proude Princes in Europe.
                     
                     The Hiſtories of the Gentiles, (which knew not the holy Scripture) declare in an other ſort the beginning of ſignorie and ſeruitude, and when they came into the world: for the Idolaters not onely did not know the Creator of the World, but alſo they were ignorant of many things which beganne in the world. They therfore ſay, that the Tyrant Nimrod (amongſt the others) had a ſonne called Belus, and that this Belus was the firſt that raigned in the land of Syria, and that hee was the firſt that inuented warres on the earth, and that hee Belus the firſt inuentor of wars ſet vp the firſt Monarche among the Aſſyrians, and in the end hee dyed after hee had raigned 65. yeares in Aſia, and left the world in great wars. The firſt Monarchie of the world, was that of the Aſſyrians, and continued 132. yeares.
                     The firſt King was Belus, and the laſt King was Sardanapalus, whome (at that time when he was ſlain) they found ſpinning with women, hauing a Diſtaffe in his hand, wherewith they vſe to ſpinne: and truly his vile death was too good for ſuch a cowardly King: For the Prince ought not to defend that with the Diſtaffe, that his Predeceſſors had wonne with the ſword.
                     
                     As wee haue ſayde Nimrod begat Belus, who had to wife Semyramis, which was the mother of Ninus, which Ninus ſucceeded his Father in tyranny, and in the Empire alſo: and both the Mother and the Sonne not contented to bee tyrants, inuented ſtatues of new Gods: For mans malice purſueth rather the euill, which the wicked doe inuent, then the good which vertuous men begin.
                     
                     We would haue ſhewed you, how the Grandfather, and the Father, the Mother and the Sonne, were Idolaters and warlike, to the end Princes and great Lords might ſee, that they beganne their Empires, more for that they were ambitious perſons, then for that they were good, patient, or vertuous men. Albeit that Nimrod was the firſt that euer committed any tyranny, and whether it bee true or not that Belus was the firſt that inuented warres, and that Chodor Laormor was the firſt that inuented battels, and that there bee others, wherof the Writings make no mention, euery man taking for himſelfe, and afterwards all together: thoſe vvere occaſions of euil enough in the world to agree vnto thoſe thinges. Our inclination is greatly to bee blamed: For thoſe which haue credite for their euill, are many: and thoſe which haue power to doe well, are but very few.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXXI. Of the golden age in times paſt, and worldly miſery which we haue at this preſent.
                     
                     
                        IN the firſt age, and golden world, all liued in peace, each man tooke care for his owne landes, euery one planted &amp; ſowed their trees, and corne, euery one gathered his fruites, and cut his vines, knedde their bread, and brought vp their children, and finally, all liued by their own proper ſweate and trauell; ſo that they all liued without the preiudice or hurt of any other.
                     O worldly malice, O curſed and wicked world, that thou neuer ſuffereſt things to remaine in one eſtate, and though I call thee curſed, maruell not thereat: for when wee are in moſt proſperity, then thou with death perſecuteſt vs moſt cruelly.
                     Without teares, I ſay not that I will ſay, that two thouſand yeares of the World were paſt before we knew what the World meant: God ſuffering The mutability of the World. it, and worldly malice inuented it, ploughes were turned into weapons, oxen to horſes, goades vnto launces, whips to arrowes, ſlings to Croſſebowes, ſimplicity into malice, trauell into idleneſſe, reſt to paine, peace to warre, loue to hatted, charity to cruelty, iuſtice to tyranny, profite to dammage, almes to theft, and aboue all, Faith into Idolatry.
                     And finally, the ſwet they had to profite in their owne goods, they turned to bloud-ſhedding, to the damage of the Common-wealth. And herein the World ſheweth it ſelfe to bee a world: herein worldly-malice ſheweth it ſelfe to bee malicious, in ſo much as the one reioyceth, and the other lamenteth: the one reioyceth to ſtumble, to the end that other may fall and breake their neckes, the one reioyceth to bee poore, to the end the other may not bee rich: the one reioyceth to bee diſprayſed, to the end the other may not be honoured: the one delighteth to bee ſad, to the end the other ſhould not bee merry: And to conclude, wee are ſo wicked, that wee baniſh the good from our owne houſe, to the end the euill might enter in at the gates of an other man.
                     When the Creator created the whole World, hee gaue to each thing immediately his place: that is to ſay, hee placed intelligence in the vppermoſt Heauen: hee placed the ſtarres in the Firmament, the planets in the orbes: the birdes in the ayre: the earth on the Center, the Fiſhes in the Water, the Serpents in the hoales, the beaſts in the mountaines: and to all in generall, he gaue place to reſt themſelues in.
                     Now let Princes and great Lords bee vaine-glorious, ſaying, that they they are Lords of the earth: for truly of all that is created, God onely is the true Lord thereof; becauſe the miſerable man for his part hath but the vſe of the fruit: for if wee thinke it reaſonable that wee ſhould enioy the profite of that which is created: then were it more conuenient wee ſhould acknowledge God to be the Lord thereof.
                     I doe not deny, but confeſſe, that God created all things, to the God made al things for the vſe of man. end they ſhould ſerue man vpon condition, that man ſhould ſerue God likewiſe: but when the creature ryſeth againſt God, immediately the Creator reſiſteth againſt man.
                     For it is but reaſon that hee bee

diſobeyed, who one onely commandement will not obey.
                     O what euill fortune hath the creature, onely for diſobeying the commandement of his Creator: for if man had kept his commaundement in Paradiſe, God had conſerued to the World the ſignorie: but the Creatures whom he created for his ſeruice are occaſion to him of great troubles: for the ingratitude of benefite heapeth great ſorrow to the diſcreet heart. It is great pity to behold the man that was in Paradiſe, and that might haue been in Heauen: and now to ſee him in the world, and aboue all to bee interred in the entrals of the earth: For in Terreſtrial Paradiſe he was innocent, and in heauen he had been bleſſed; but now he is in the world, enuironed with cares, and afterwards he ſhall bee throwne into his graue, and gnawne of the Wormes. Let vs now ſee the diſobedience wee had in the commaundement What man loft by Adams fall. of God, and what fruit we haue gathered in the world. For hee is very ſimple that dare commit any vice, taking no delight nor pleaſure thereof in his body. In my opinion through the ſinnes which our forefathers committed in Paradiſe, the ſeruitude remaineth in vs their children which are on the earth. For ſo much as if I enter into the water, I drowne, if I touch the fire I burne, if I come neare a dogge, hee biteth mee, if I threaten a horſe, hee eaſteth mee, if I reſiſt the winde it bloweth me downe, if I perſecute the ſerpent, hee ſpoyleth me, if I ſmite the beare hee deſtroyeth me, and to be briefe I ſay, that the man that without pitty eateth men in his life, the Worms ſhall eate his entrals in his life after his death.
                     O Princes and great Lords, lode your ſelues with cloth of gold, heape vp your great Treaſures, aſſemble many Armies, inuent Iuſts and turneis, ſeeke paſtimes and pleaſures, reuenge your ſelues of your enemies, ſerue your ſelues with your ſubiects, marry your children to mighty Kings, and ſet them in great eſtate: cauſe your ſelues to bee feared of your enemies, imploy your bodies to all pleaſures, leaue great poſſeſſions to your heyres, rayſe ſumptuous buildinges to leaue memory of your perſons: I ſweare by him that ſhall iudge mee, that I haue more compaſſion to ſee your ſinfull ſoules, then I haue enuy to ſee your vicious liues: for in the end all paſtimes will vaniſh away, and they ſhall leaue you for a gage to the hungry wormes of the earth.
                     O if Princes did conſider (though they haue beene borne Princes, created A warning for all ſorts of people. and nouriſhed in great eſtates) that the day they are borne, death immediately commeth to ſeeke the end of their life, and taketh them here and there when they are ſicke, now tumbling, then riſing; hee neuer leaueth them one houre vntill their wofull buriall: Therefore ſith it is true, (as indeed it is) that that which Princes poſſeſſe in this life is but ſmall, &amp; that which they hope in the other is ſo great: Truely I maruell why Princes, the which ſhall lye ſo ſtraight in the graue, dare lye in ſuch and ſo great largeneſſe in their life. To be rich, to be Lords, and to haue great eſtates, men ſhould not thereof at all bee proude, ſince they ſee how frayle mans condition is: for in the end life is but lone, but death is enheritage. Death is a patrimony and heritage, which ſucceſſiuely is inherited: but life is a right which dayly is ſurrendered. For death counteth vs ſo much his own, that oft times vnawares, hee Nothing ſo ſure as death. commeth to aſſault vs: &amp; life taketh vs ſuch ſtrangers, that oft times we not doubting thereof, it vaniſheth away

If this thing then bee true, why will Princes and great Lords preſume to commaund a ſtrange houſe, which is this life, as in their owne houſe which is the graue? Leauing aſide the ſayd opinions, I ſay that for ſinne onely ſcruitude came to dwell in vs, and entered into the world: for if there had beene no ſinners, wee ought to beleeue there had beene no Lords, nor ſeruants. For aſmuch as ſeruitude generally entreth into this World through ſinne: I ſay that the Seigniory of Princes is by the diuine commaundement; for he ſayeth: By mee the King doth gouerne, and by mee the Prince doth miniſter Iuſtice.
                     
                     I conclude in this ſort, with this reaſon: That ſince it is true, Princes are ſent by the hands of God for to gouerne vs, Wee are bound in all, and for 
                        The reaſon wee haue to obey our Prince. 
                        all to obey them: for there is no greater plague in a publike weale, then to be diſobedient to the Prince.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXII. How King Alexander the great, after hee had ouercome King Datius in Aſia, went to conquer the great Indea, and of that which happned vnto him with the Garamantes, and how the good life hath more power then any force of warre.
                     
                     
                        IN the yeare of the Creation of the World, 4970. in the firſt age of the World, and in the 4027. yeares of the foundation of Rome, Iado being High Prieſt in Hieruſalew, Decius and Mamilius at Rome Conſuls, in the third yeare of the Monarchie of the Greekes, Alexander the Great (ſonne to Philip King of Macedonia) gaue the laſt battell to Darius King of Perſia, wherein King Alexander eſcaped very ſore wounded, and Darius ſlaine, ſo that the whole Empire of the Perſians came vnder the gouernment of the Greeks: For the vnfortunate Princes do not onely loſe their liues with which they came into the world, but alſo the Realmes which they did inherite.
                     After that Darius was dead, and Alexander ſaw himſelfe Lord of the field, and that the Perſians and Medes were become ſubiect to the Grecians, though many Kings and Lords dyed in thoſe cruell batailes: yet it ſeemed to Alexander a trifle to be Gouernor of all Aſia, wherefore he determined in perſon to goe conquere the great India. For, Proude and ſtoute hearts obtayning that which they deſire, immediately beginne to eſteeme it as little. All The pride of Alexander. his Armies repayred, and placing gouernours in all the Realme of Aſia, Alexander departed to conquere the great India: for hee had promiſed &amp; ſworne to his gods, that through all the World there ſhould be but one Empire, and that that ſhould be his: and moreouer that hee would neuer paſſe thorow any ſtrange Realme or Country, but it ſhould giue obedience vnto him, or elſe forthwith hee would deſtroy it: for tyrannous harts haue neuer any regard to the damage of another, vntill they haue obtained their wicked deſires.
                     
                        Alexander then going to conquer Realmes, and deſtroy Prouinces: by chance one ſayde vnto him, That on the other ſide of the mountaine Riphei (towards the partes of India) was a barbarous Nation which were called Garamantes, as yet neuer conquered by the Perſians and Medes, Romaines, nor Greekes, neyther any of them euer triumphed ouer them: for they had no weapons, nor eſteemed them not,
                        
                        ſith they had no riches.
                     
                     King Alexander, (who for to conquer and ſubdue Realmes and ſtrange countreys was very diligent &amp; hardy and to ſee new things very deſirous,) determined, not onely to ſend to ſee that countrey, but alſo to goe himſelfe in perſon, and in that place to leaue of him ſome Memoriall: which thing forthwith he accompliſhed. For hee left them Altares, as Hercules left in Gades, pillars. For mans heart is ſo ſtout, that it Trauelleth not onely to compare with manie, but alſo to excell all.
                     The Embaſſadours of Alexander were ſent to Garamantes, to aduertiſe them of the comming of King Alexander the great, &amp; of the terrible and cruell battells, which he in the warres had ouercome: and to declare vnto them how the puiſſant K: Darius was ſlayne, and that all Aſia was vnder his ſubiection, and how euery Citie did yeelde themſelues: againſt whom he neyther lifted ſpeare nor ſword, becauſe all yeelded to his cōmandment. With theſe and ſuch other like things they would haue feared them, for that words oft times maketh men more afraide, eſpecially when they are ſpoken of braue ſtoute men, then doe the ſwords of cowards.
                     
                        Lucius Boſco ſaith, in his third booke of the antiquityes of the Grecians, (of whom the originall of this hyſtorie is drawne) that after the Embaſſadours of Alexander had ſpoken to the Garamantes, they were nothing at all troubled for the meſſage, neither did they fly away from Alexander, nor they prepared any warre, neyther tooke they in hand any weapon, nor yet they did reſiſt him, Yea, and the chiefeſt of all was, that no man of the Countrey euer departed out of his houſe.
                     Finally, they neyther anſwered the Ambaſſadors (of Alexander,) to theyr right meſſage, nor yet ſpake one word vnto them, concerning their coming. And truly the Garamantes had reaſon therein, and did in that right wiſely: For it is but meere follie for a man to perſwade thoſe men with words who enterpriſe any thing of will.
                     It is a maruellous matter to heare reported the hyſtories of theſe Garamantes, (that is to ſay) that all theyr houſes were of equall height, all men were apparelled alike, the one had no more authority then another, in feeding they were no glouttons, in drinking wine they were temperate, concerning pleas and debates, they were ignorant, they would ſuffer no idle man to liue among them, they had no weapons, becauſe they had no enemyes: and generally, they ſpake few words, but that which they ſpake was alwayes true.
                     King Alexander being ſomwhat informed of thoſe Garamantes, and their life, determined to ſend for them, and called them before his preſence, and inſtantly deſired them (if they had any wiſe men among them, to bring them vnto him, and by writing or by word of mouth, to ſpeake ſomewhat vnto him. For Alexander was ſuch a friend to ſage men, that all the realms which he ouercame, immediately he gaue to his men, excepting the Sages, which he kept for his owne perſon.
                     
                        Quintus Curtius, by king Alexander ſayth, that a Prince doth wel ſpende his treaſors to conquer many Realms, only to haue the conuerſation of one wiſe man. And truely he had reaſon: for to princes it is more profit in their life to bee accompanied with Sages: then after their deaths, to leaue great treaſours to their heires. Certaine of thoſe Garamantes thē being come before the preſence of Alex: the great, one among them (as they thoght the moſt ancientſt) himſelfe alone (the reſidue keeping ſilence,) in the name of them all ſpake theſe words.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXXIII. Of an Oration which one of the Sages of Garamantia made vnto King Alexander, a goodly leſſon for all ambitious men,
                     
                     
                        IT is a cuſtome, king Alexander, amongſt vs Garamantes, to ſpeake ſeldome one to another, &amp; ſcarſely neuer ſpeake to ſtrangers, eſpecially if they be buſie and vnquiet men: For, the tongue of an euil man is no other but a plaine demonſtration of his enuious heart.
                     When they tolde vs of thy comming into this countrey, immediately wee determined not to goe out to receyue thee, nor to prepare our ſelues to reſiſt thee, neyther to lifte vp our eyes to beholde thee, nor to open our mouthes to ſalute thee, neyther to moue our hands to trouble thee, nor yee to make warre to offend thee. For greater is the hate that we beare to riches and honours, which thou loueſt, then the loue is that thou haſt to deſtroy men, and ſubdue Countreyes, which we abhorre.
                     It hath pleaſed thee we ſhuld ſee thee, not deſiring to ſee thee, and wee haue obeied thee, not willing to obey thee, and that we ſhould ſalute thee, not deſirous to ſalute thee: wherewith wee are contented, vppon condition, that thou be patient to heare vs. For that which we will ſay vnto thee, ſhall tend more vnto amendmēt of thy life, then to diſſwade thee frō conquering our countrey. For it is reaſon that Princes which ſhal come hereafter doe know, why wee liuing ſo little, eſteeme that which is our owne: and why thou dying, takeſt ſuch paines to poſſeſſe that which is another mans.
                     O Alexander, I aske thee one thing, and I doubt whether thou canſt aunſwer me thereunto or no? For thoſe hearts which are proud, are alſo moſt commonly blinded.
                     Tell me whether thou goeſt? from whence thou commeſt? what thou meaneſt? what thou thinkeſt? what thou deſireſt? what thou ſeekeſt? what thou demandeſt? what thou ſearcheſt? A compendious reprehenſion. and what thou procureſt? and further, to what Realms &amp; Prouinces thy diſordinate appetite extendeth? Without a cauſe do I not demand thee this queſtion, what is that thou demandeſt and what it is that thou ſeekeſt: For I think thou thy ſelfe knoweſt not what thou wouldeſt? For proud and ambicious hearts know not what will ſatisfie them. Sith thou art ambitious, honor deceiueth thee: ſith thou art prodigall, couetouſnes beguyleth thee: ſith thou art yong, ignorance abuſeth thee: and ſith thou art proude, all the world laugheth thee to ſcorne: in ſuch ſort, that thou followeſt men and not reaſon: thou followeſt thine owne opinion, and not the counſell of an other, thou embraceſt flatterers, and repulſeſt vertuous men. For Princes and Noble men had rather bee commended with lyes, thē to be reproued with truth. I cannot tell to what ende you Princes liue ſo deceyued, and abuſed, to haue &amp; keepe in your pallaces more flattrers, iuglers, and fooles, then wiſe and ſage men. For in a princes pallace if there bee any which extolleth theyr doings, there are ten thouſand which abhorre their tyrannies. I perceiue by theſe deeds (Alexander) that the gods will ſooner end thy life, then then wilt end thy wars. The man that is brought vp in debates, diſcentions, and ſtrife, all his felicitie conſiſteth in burning, deſtroying, and bloud ſhedding: I ſee thee defended with weapōs, I ſee thee accōpanied with tirants, I ſee thee rob the tēples. I ſe thee without profit waſt the treaſors, I ſee thee murder the Innocent

and trouble the patient, I ſee thee euill willed of all, and beloued of none, which is the greateſt euill of all euils. Therefore how were it poſſible for thee to endure ſuch and ſo great trauels, vnleſſe thou art a foole, or elſe becauſe God hath appointed it to chaſtice thee.
                     The Gods ſuffer oftentimes that men being quiet. ſhould haue ſome weighty affayres, and that is not for that they ſhould be honoured: at this preſent, but to the end they ſhould be puniſhed for that which is paſt.
                     Tell mee I pray thee, peraduenture it is no great folly to empoueriſh many, to make thy ſelfe alone rich? It is not (peraduenture) folly that one ſhould commaund by tyranny, and that all the reſt loſe the poſſeſſion of their Seigniory. It is not folly perchance to loue (to the damnation of our ſoules) many memories in the world of our body. It is not folly perchance that the Gods approue thy diſordinate appetite alone, and condemne the will and opinion of all the World beſide: peraduenture it is not folly, to winne with the tears of the poore, and comfortleſſe widdowes) ſo great and bloudy victories: peraduenture it is no folly, willingly to wet the earth with the bloud of Innocents, onely to haue a vaine glorie in this World? Thou thinkeſt it no folly peraduenture (God hauing diuided the World into ſo many people) that thou ſhouldeſt vſurpe them to thee alone? O Alexander, Alexander, truly ſuch workes proceede not from a creature nouriſhed among men on the earth: but rather of one that hath beene brought vp among the infernall Furies of Hell: for wee are not bound to iudge men by the How wee ought to iudge of men. good nature they haue: but by their good and euill works which they do.
                     The man is curſed (if hee haue not been curſed, hee ſhalbe curſed) that liueth to the preiudice of all others in this world preſent, onely to be counted couragious, ſtoute, and hardie, in time to come. For the gods ſeldome ſuffered them to enioy that quietly in peace, which they haue gotten vniuſtly in the warres.
                     I would aske thee, what inſolencie moued thee to reuolte againſt the lord K. Darius? after whoſe death thou haſt ſought to conquer all the world? and thus thou doeſt not as a King that is an inhertitor, but as a tyrant, that is an oppreſſor, For him properly we cal a tirant, that without iuſtice &amp; reaſon taketh that which is another mans.
                     Eyther thou ſearcheſt iuſtic, or thou ſearcheſt peace, or elſe thou ſearcheſt riches, and our honor? Thou ſearcheſt reſt, or els thou ſearcheſt fauour of thy frends, or thou ſearcheſt vengeance of The propertie of a tyrant. thine enemies. But I ſweare vnto thee (Alex:) that thou ſhalt not find any of all theſe things, if thou ſeekeſt by this meanes, as thou haſt begun: For the ſweet Sugar is not of the nature of the bitter gumbe. How ſhall wee belieue thou ſearcheſt iuſtice, ſith againſt reaſon and iuſtice, by Tiranny thou ruleſt al the earth? how ſhal we belieue thou ſearcheſt peace, ſith thou cauſeſt them to pay tribute which receiue thee: and thoſe which reſiſt thee, thou handleſt thē like enemies? How can we belieue that thou ſearcheſt reſt, ſith thou troubleſt all the world? How can wee belieue thou ſearcheſt gentiles, ſith thou art the ſcourge and ſword of humaine frailnes? how can we belieue that thou ſearcheſt riches, ſith thine owne Treaſures ſuffiſeth thee not: neyther that which by thee vāquiſhed cōmeth into thy hands, nor that which the conque rors offer thee? How ſhall we belieue thou ſearcheſt profit to thy friēds, ſith that of thy old friends, thou haſt made new enemies? I let thee vnderſtand (Alex:) that the greateſt ought to teache the leaſt, &amp; the leaſt to obey the greatſt
                     
                        
And Friendſhip is onely amongſt equalls. But thou, (ſith thou ſuffereſt none in the World to bee equall and like vnto thee, looke not thou to haue any Friend in the world. For Princes oftentimes by ingratitude looſe faithfull Friends: and by ambition winne mortall enemies.
                     How ſhall we belieue thou ſearcheſt reuēge of thine enemies, ſith thou takeſt more vengeance of thy ſelfe, beeing aliue, then thine enemyes would take of thee, if they tooke thee priſoner? though perchance in times paſt they vſed thy Father Philip euill, and haue now diſobeyed thee his Sonne: It were farre better counſel for thee to make them thy Friends by gentlenes, then to confirme them Enemyes by crueltie. For the Noble and pitifull harts when they are reuenged of any, make of themſelues a butcherie.
                     Wee cannot with truth ſay, that thy Trauells are well employde to winne ſuch honor, ſith thy conuerſation and life is ſo vnconſtant? For truely honour conſiſteth not in that Flatterers ſay, but in that which Lords doe. For the great Familiaritie of the wicked, cauſeth the life to be ſuſpected.
                     
                        Honour is not gotten by liberall giuing of Treaſours at his death, but by ſpending it well in his life: For it is a ſufficient 
                        In what true Honor conſiſteth. 
                        profe, that the man which eſteemeth renowme, doth little regard Money: and it is an apparant token, that man who little eſteemeth Money, greatly regardeth his renowme.
                     
                     A man winneth not honor by murdering Innocents, but by deſtroying Tyrants: for all the harmony of the good gouernment of princes is, in the chaſtiſing How a Prince muſt winne honour. of the euil, &amp; rewarding the good.
                     Honour is not wonne in taking and ſnatching the goods of an other, but in giuing and ſpending his owne.
                     
                        For there is nothing that beautifieth the Maieſtie of a Prince more, then for to ſhew his noblenes in extending mercie and fauour vnto his ſubiects, and giuing gifts and rewards to the vertuous.
                     
                     And to conclude, I will let thee know who hee is, that winneth true honour in this life: and alſo: a perpetuall memorie after his death: and that is not hee which leadeth his life in Warres, but hee that taketh his death in peace.
                     O Alexander, I ſee thou art young, and that thou deſirſt honour, wherefore I let thee vnderſtand, that there is no man farther from true honor, then hee which greedily procureth and deſireth the ſame. For the ambitious men, not obtaining what they deſire, remaine alwaies defamed, and in winning and getting that which they ſearch, true honour notwithſtanding will not follow them.
                     Belieue mee in one thing Alexander, that the moſt trueſt honor ought through worthie deedes to bee deſerued, and by no meanes to bee procured: For all the honour which by tyrannie is wonne, in the ende by infamy is loſt.
                     I am ſorrie for thee Alexander: For How true honour is wonne. I ſee thou wanteſt Iuſtice, ſince thou loueſt Tyrannie: I ſee thou lackeſt peace, becauſe thou loueſt warre: I ſee thou art not Rich, becauſe thou haſt made all the world poore: I ſee thou lackeſt reſt, becauſe thou ſeekeſt contention and debate: I ſee thou haſt no honour, becauſe thou winneſt it by infamie: I ſee thou wanteſt friends, becauſe thou haſt made them thine enemies.
                     Finally, I ſee thou doeſt not reuenge thy ſelfe of thine enemyes, becauſe thou art (as they wold be) the ſcourge to thy ſelfe.
                     Then ſince it is ſo; why art thou aliue in this World, ſith thou lackeſt vertues, for the which life ought to be deſired? For truely that man, which without his owne profite, and to the dammage of an other leadeth his life, by Iuſtice ought forthwith to loſe his breath.
                     
                     
                        
For there is nothing that ſooner deſtroyeth the Weale publike, then to permit vnprofitable men therein to liue.
                     Therefore ſpeaking the truth, you Lords and Princes are but poore, I beleeue thou conquereſt the World, becauſe thou knoweſt not thy ſuperiour therein: and beſides that, thou wilt take life from ſo many, to the end that by their death thou mayeſt win renowne.
                     If cruell and warlike Princes (as thou art) ſhould inherite the liues of them whom they ſlay, to augment &amp; prolong their liues, as they doe inherite goods to maintaine their pride, although it were vnmeete, then warre were tollerable,
                     But what profiteth the ſeruant to loſe his life this day, and his Maſters death to bee differred but vntill the The propertie of a wiſe man. morrow? O Alexander, to be deſirous to commaund much, hauing reſpite to liue but little: mee thinketh it were a great folly and lacke of wiſdome. Preſumptuous and ambitious men which meaſure their works not with the few dayes they haue to liue, but with the arogant and haughty thoughts they haue to command: They leade their life in trauell, and take their death with ſorrow. And the remedy hereof is, that if the wiſe man cannot obtaine that which hee would, hee ſhould content himſelfe with that which hee may.
                     I let thee to know Alexander, that the perfection of men is not to ſee much, to heare much, to knowe much, to procure much, to come to much, to trauell much, to poſſeſſe much, and to bee able to do much: but it is to bee in the fauour of the Gods.
                     Finally, I tell thee, that that man is perfect, who in his owne opinion deſerueth not that hee hath, and in the opinion of another, deſerueth much more then that hee poſſeſſeth. Wee are of this opinion amongſt vs, that hee is vnworthy to haue honour, who by ſuch infamous meanes ſearcheth for it. And therefore thou, Alexander, deſerueſt to be ſlaue vnto many, becauſe thou thinkeſt to deſerue the ſignory ouer all. By the immortall Gods I ſweare, I cannot imagine the great miſchiefe which entred into thy breſt, ſo vnrighteouſly to kill King Darius (whoſe vaſſall and friend thou waſt onely) becauſe thou wouldeſt poſſeſſe the Empire of the whole World? For truly ſeruitude in peace is more worth then Signiory in warre. And hee that ſhall ſpeake againſt that I haue ſpoken, I ſay he, is ſicke, and hath loſt his taſte.

                            then thou art now being Lord of all the earth: for the exceſſiue trauell bringeth men out of all order.
                     Thou wilt not deny me Alexander, that the more thou getteſt, the more thou deſireſt: for the heart which with couetouſneſſe is ſet on fire, cannot with wood and bowes of riches,

but with the earth of the graue be ſatisfied and quenched.
                     Thou wilt not deny me (Alexander) but the aboundance that thou thy ſelfe haſt, ſeemeth vnto thee litle, and the little which an other man poſſeſſeth, ſeemeth vnto thee much: For the Gods, to the ambitious, and couetous harts gaue this for penance that neyther with inough, nor with too much they ſhould content them ſelues.
                     Thou wilt not denie mee (Alexander) if in deed thy heart bee couetous, that firſt the pleaſures of life ſhall end before thy couetouſneſſe: for where vices haue had power long time in the heart, there death, onely, and none other hath authority to plucke vp the rootes.
                     Thou wilt not deny mee (Alexander) that though thou haſt more then all, yet thou enioyeſt leaſt of any: for the Prince that poſſeſſeth much, is alwayes occupied in defending it: but The greedy deſires of man neuer ſatisfied. the Prince that hath little, hath Time and leaſure in quiet to enioy it.
                     Thou wilt not deny me (Alexander) though thou calleſt thy ſelf Lord of all, yet thou haſt but onely the name thereof, and others thy ſeruants and ſubiects haue all the profites: for the greedy and couetous hearts doe trauel and toyle to get, and in waſting that which they haue gotten, they pine away.
                     And finally (Alexander) thou wilt not deny me, that all that which thou haſt in the long conqueſt gotten, is little, and that which of thy wiſedom and quietnes thou haſt loſt, is much: For the Realms which thou haſt gotten are innumerable, but the cares, ſighes and thoughts which thou haſt heaped vpon thy heart, are innumerable.
                     I let thee know one thing, that you Princes are poorer then the poore Subiects: for hee is not rich that hath more then hee deſerueth, but he that deſireth to haue leſſe then poſſeſſeth. And that therefore Princes you haue nothing: For though you abound in great Treaſurs, yet notwithſtanding, you are poore of good deſire.
                     Now Alexander, let vs come to the poynt, and caſt account, and let vs ſee The man is happie that hath content. vs ſee to what ende thy Conqueſt will come? Either thou art a man, or thou art a god; And if thou bee anie of the gods, commaunde, or cauſe that wee be immortall: and if thou canſt doe any ſuch thing, then take vs and our goods withall. For perpetuity of the life, can by no riches be bought.
                     O Alexander, I let thee vnderſtand, that therefore wee ſeeke not to make warre with thee: For we ſee that both from thee, and alſo from vs, death will ſhortly take away the life. For hee is a very ſimple man, that thinketh alwayes to remaine in another mans houſe as in his owne.
                     
                     It thou Alexander, couldſt giue vs, (as God) euerlaſting life, eache man would trauell to defend his owne houſe; But ſith we know we ſhall dye ſhortly, we care little whether to thee or any other, our goods and riches remaine. For if it be follie to dwell in an other mans houſe as his owne, it is a greater follie to him that loſeth his life, in taking thought and lamenting for his goods.
                     Preſuppoſe that thou art not god, but a man; I coniure thee then, by the immortall gods, and doe require thee that thou liue as a man, behaue thy ſelfe as a man, and couet no more then an other man, neyther deſire How a man ought to conceyue of himſelfe. more nor leſſe then a man: for in the ende thou ſhalt dye as another man, and ſhalt be buryed as another man, and thou ſhalt bee throwne into the graue, and then there ſhalbe no more memorie of thee.
                     I tolde thee before that it greeued

mee to ſee thee ſo hardy and couragious, ſo apt and ſo young, and now it grieueth mee to ſee thee ſo deceyued with the world: and that which I perceyue of thee is, that then thou ſhalt know thy folly when thou ſhalt not be able to finde any remedy. For the proude Young man before hee feeleth the wound hath alreadie the ointment.
                     You which are Grecians call vs Barbarous, becauſe wee enhabite the mountaines.
                     But as touching this I ſay, that we reioice to be barbarous in our ſpeech and Greekes in our doings: and not as you which haue the Grecian tong, and doe barbarous workes.
                     For hee that doth well, and ſpeaketh rudely, is no barbarous man: but he which hath the tongue good, and the life euill. Sith I haue begun to that end nothing remaine vnſpoken, I will aduertiſe thee of our laws and life, and maruell not to heare it, but deſire to obſerue and keepe it: for infinite are they which extoll vertuous workes, but few are they which obſerue the ſame.
                     I let thee know (Alexander) that wee haue ſhort life, wee are few people, wee haue little lands, wee haue little goods, wee haue no couetouſnes, we haue few lawes, we haue few houſes, and we haue few friends, and aboue all we haue no enemies: for a Wiſe man ought to be friend to one, and enemie to none.
                     Beſides all this, wee haue amongſt vs great friendſhippes, good peace, great loue: much reſt, and aboue all, wee holde our ſelues contented: for it is better to enioy the quietneſſe of the graue, then to liue a diſcontented life.
                     Our Lawes are few, but in our opinions they are good, and are in ſeuen words onely included as here followeth.
                     
                        Wee ordaine that our children make no more Lawes then wee their Fathers doe leaue vnto them: for new Lawes maketh them to forget good and ancient

                        We ordaine that our Succeſſors ſhall haue no moe Gods then two, of the which the one God ſhall bee for the life, and the other for the death: for one God well ſerued is more worth, then many not regarded
                     
                     
                        Wee ordaine that all bee apparrelled with one cloath, and hoſed of one ſort, and that the one haue no more apparrell then the other: for the diuerſity of garments engendreth folly among the people.
                     
                     
                        Wee ordaine that when any woman which is maried hath had three children that then ſhee bee ſeparated from her husband, for the aboundance of children cauſeth men to haue couetous hearts. And if any woman hath brought forth any mo children, then they ſhould bee ſacrificed vnto the Gods before her eyes.
                     
                     
                        We ordaine that all men and women ſpeake the truth in all things, and if any bee taken in a lye, committing no other fault, that immediately hee bee put to death for the ſame: For one lyer is able to vndoe a whole multitude.
                     
                     
                        We ordaine that no woman liue aboue forty yeares, and that the man liue vntil fifty, and if they dye not before that time that then they be ſacrificed to the Gods: for it is a great occaſion for men to bee vicious, to thinke that they ſhall liue many yeares.

                        IT is a common and olde ſaying (which many times by Ariſtotle the noble and vertuous Prince hath beene repeated) That in the end all thinges are done to ſome purpoſe: for there is no worke neyther good nor euil
                              •
                            but he that doth it, meaneth to ſome end.
                     
                     If thou demaundeſt the Gardener to what end he watereth ſo oft his plants, hee will anſwere thee, it is to get ſome money for his hearbes. If thou demaundeſt why the riuer runneth ſo ſwift, a man will anſwere thee, that it his to the end it ſhould returne from whence it came.
                     If thou demaundeſt why the trees budde in the ſpring time, they will anſwere, to the end they may beare fruite in harueſt. If wee ſee a traueller paſſe the mountaines in the ſnow, the riuers with perill, the woods in feare, What gifts God beſtoweth vp on Princes, aboue other men. to walke in extreame heate in Sommer, to wander in the night time in the colde winter: and if by chance a man doth aske one of them ſaying: Friend, whether goeſt thou, wherefore takeſt thou ſuch paines? And hee aunſwereth, Truly ſir, I know no more then you to what end, neyther can I tell why I take ſuch paines. I aske thee now, what a wiſe man would anſwere to this innocent Traueller? Truly (hearing no more) hee would iudge him to bee a foole: for he is much infortunate, that for all his trauell looketh for no reward. Therefore to our matter, a Prince which is begotten as an other man, borne as an other man, liueth as an other man, dyeth as an other man: And beſides all this commaundeth all men, if of ſuch a one wee ſhould demaund, why God gaue him ſigniory, and that he ſhould anſwere hee knoweth not, but that he was borne vnto it.
                     In ſuch caſe let euery man iudge, how vnworthy ſuch a King is to haue ſuch authority. For it is vnpoſsible for a man to miniſter iuſtice, vnleſſe hee knew before what iuſtice meaneth.
                     Let Princes and noble men heare this word, &amp; imprint it in their memory, which is, that when the liuing God determined to make Kings and Lords in this world: hee did not ordaine them to eate more then others, to drinke more then others, to ſleepe more then others, to ſpeake more thē others, nor to reioyce more then others: but hee created them vpon condition, that ſith he had made thē to commaund more then others, they ſhould be more iuſt in their liues thē others.
                     It is a thing moſt vniuſt, and in the Common wealth very ſlaunderous, to ſee with what authority a puiſſant man commandeth thoſe that bee vertuous: and with how much ſhame, himſelfe is bound to all vices. I know not what Lord he is that dare puniſh his ſubiect for one onely offence committed, ſeeing himſelfe to deſerue for euery deede to bee chaſtiſed: For it is a monſtrous thing, that a blinde man ſhould take vpon him to leade him that ſeeth.
                     They demaunded great Cato the Cenſor what a King ought to doe, that he ſhould be beloued, feared, and not deſpiſed; he anſwered, The good Prince ſhould be compared to him that ſelleth Tryacle, who if the poyſon
                        
                        What is required in a Prince. 
                        hurteth him not, hee ſelleth bis Triacle well, I mean therby, that the puniſhment is takē in good part of the people, which is not miniſtred by the vitious man: For hee that maketh the Tryacle ſhall neuer bee credited, vnleſſe the proofe of his Triacle bee openly knowne and tryed: I meane that the good life is none other then a fine Triacle to cure the Commonwealth. And to whome is he more like, which with his tongue blazeth vertues, and imployeth his deedes to all vices: then vnto the man, who in the one hand holdeth poyſon to take away life; and in the other Triacle to reſiſt death? To the end that a Lord bee wholy obeyed, it is neceſſary that all that he commaundeth bee obſerued, firſt in his owne perſon: for no Lord can nor may withdraw himſelfe from vertuous works.
                     This was the anſwere that Cato the Cenſor gaue, which in mine opinion was ſpoken more like a Chriſtian then any Romane.
                     
                     When the true God came into the World, he employed 30. yeares onely in workes, and ſpent but two yeares and a halfe in teaching: For mans heart is perſwaded more with the worke hee ſeeketh, then with the word which hee heareth. Thoſe therfore which are Lords, let them learne and know of him which is the true Lord, and alſo let Princes learne why they are Princes: for he is not a Pylot which neuer ſayled on the ſeas. In mine opinion, if a Prince will know why he is a Prince, I would ſay to gouern well his people, to command well, and to maintaine all in iuſtice, and this ſhould not bee with words, to make them afrayde, neyther by works which ſhould offend them: but by ſweet words which ſhould encourage them, and by the good workes that ſhould edifie them: for the noble and gentle heart cannot reſiſt, him, that with a louing countenance commaundeth, Thoſe which will rule and make tame, fierce, and wilde beaſts, do threaten and rebuke them a hundred times, before they beate them once: and if they keepe them tyed, they ſhew them ſundrie pleaſures: So that the wildneſſe of the beaſt is taken away, onely by the gentle and pleaſant vſage of the man, therfore ſith wee haue this experience of brute &amp; ſauage beaſts (that is to ſay) that by their well doing, and by the gentle handling of them, they voluntarily ſuffer themſelues to bee gouerned: much more experience we reaſonable men ought to haue, that is to know, that being right and well gouerned, wee ſhould humbly, and willingly obey our ſoueraigne Lords: for there is no man ſo hard hearted, but by gentle vſage will humble himſelfe.
                     O Princes and noble men, I will tell you in one word, what the Lorde ought to doe in the gouernement of his common-wealth.
                     Euery Prince that hath his mouth full of truth, his hands open to giue rewards, and his eares ſtopped vnto lyes, and his heart open to mercy, ſuch a one is happy, and the realme which hath him, may well bee called proſperous, and the people may call themſelues fortunate: For where as truth, liberality, and clemency ruleth in the hart of a Prince, there wrongs, iniuries, &amp; oppreſſions do not raigne. And contrariwiſe, where the Prince hath his heart fleſhed in cruelty, his mouth full of tyrannies, his hands defiled with bloud, and enclineth his eares to heare lyes: ſuch a Prince is vnhappy, and much more the people the which by ſuch a one is gouerned: for it is vnpoſsible that there is peace and iuſtice in the common wealth, if hee which gouerneth it, bee a louer of lyes and flatteries.
                     
                        
In the yeare 440. before the Incarnation of Chriſt, which was in the year 244. of the foundation of Rome: Darius the fourth being King of Perſia, and Brutus and Lucius at Rome Conſuls, Thales the great Philoſopher flouriſhed in Greece, who was Prince of the ſeuen renowmed Sages: by the which occaſion, all the What time Thales the Philoſopher flouriſhed. Realme of Greece had, and recouered renowne: For Greece boaſted more of the ſeuen Sages which they had, then Rome did of all the valiant Captains ſhee nouriſhed.
                     There was at that time much contention betweene the Romanes and the Greekes, for ſo much as the Greekes ſayd, they were better, becauſe they had more Sages, and the Romanes ſaid the contrary, that they were better, becauſe they had alwayes more Armies.
                     The Greekes replyed againe, that there were no lawes made but in Greece. And the Romanes to this aunſwered, that though they were made in Greece, yet they were obſerued at Rome. The Greekes ſayde, that they had great Vniuerſities to make Wiſe men in. And the Romanes ſaid, that they had many great temples to worſhip their Gods in: for that in the end they ought to eſteeme more one ſeruice done to the immortall Gods, then all the other commodities that might come vnto men.
                     A Thebane Knight was demaunded, what hee thought of Rome and Greece: and hee anſwered, mee thinketh the Romanes are no better then the Greekes, nor the Greekes then the Romanes: For the Greekes glory in their tongues, and the Romanes in their Launces: but we referre it to vertuous works: For one good worke is more worth, then eyther the long ſtaues of the Romanes, or the eloquēt tongues of the Greekes,
                     
                     Therfore touching my matter, this Philoſopher Thales was the firſt that found the Pole (called the North Thales the firſt that found out the North ſtarre. ſtarre) to ſayle by, and the firſt that found the deuiſion of the yeares, the quantitie of the Sun and the Moone, and the firſt that ſayde ſoules were immortall, and that the World had a ſoule. And aboue all, hee would neuer marry; for the care to content a wife, and the thought to bring vp the children, doth much dull the wits of wiſe men.
                     This Philoſopher Thales was very poore, wherefore (ſome diſdayning him for his pouerty) to declare and ſhew that he was more rich then all they: hee bought the next yeare all the Oliues hee could get: for by Aſtronomy hee knew that in the thirde yeare there would be a great want &amp; ſcarſitie thereof throughout all the Country: Wherefore all were compelled to come to him for Oliues, which at his owne price he ſolde: &amp; in this ſort he ſhewed them that mocked him, that he willingly deſpiſed riches, and louingly embraced pouertie: For, he that willingly in this world is poore, ought not to be called poore.
                     
                     This Philoſopher Thales was a Mirror amongſt the Sages of Greece, and was greatly reuerenced of al the Kings of Aſia, and highly renowmed in Rome.
                     
                     And further he was ſo wiſe, and had ſo ready a wit, that to all ſodaine queſtions hee was demaunded, hee gaue preſent aunſwere forthwith, which thing declared him to bee of a maruellous wit, and truely it was a great matter: for the moſt part of mortall men cannot tell how to anſwere, nor what to demaund.
                     Many and diuers queſtions wee asked him, as Diogenes Laertius affirmeth, in the anſwering whereof hee ſhewed great wiſdome, the treaſure of memory, and ſubtilty of vnderſtanding.
                     
                        
Firſt, he was asked, What GOD was? Thales anſwered; Of all the moſt antiquities, GOD is the moſt auncient thing. For all the Ancients paſt neyther ſawe him take beginning, nor thoſe which ſhal come, ſhall ſee him haue ending. 
                        Queſtions reſolued by Thaks.
                     
                     Secondarily, hee was asked, What thing was moſt beautifull: he anſwered, The world: becauſe no Artificiall paynting could make the like.
                     
                     Thirdly he was asked, What was the greateſt thing: To that hee anſwered, Place, wherein all things doe ſtand. For the place which containeth all, of neceſſitie muſt be greater then all.
                     
                     Fourthly, it was asked him, Who knoweth moſt: he anſwered, That no man was wiſer then Time, becauſe Time alwayes onely inuented new things; and is he which renueth the olde.
                     
                     Fiftly, they asked him, What was the lighteſt thing? hee anſwered, the wit of man, becauſe that without trauel and danger it paſſeth the Sea, to diſcouer and compaſſe all the whole earth.
                     
                     Sixtly, they asked him, What was the ſtrongeſt thing: he ſaid, That man that is in neceſſitie: For neceſſitie reuiueth the vnderſtanding of the rude, and cauſeth the coward to be hardy in perill.
                     
                     Seuenthly, they asked him, What was the hardeſt thing to know? hee anſwered, for man to know himſelfe: For there ſhould bee no contentions in the world, if man knew himſelfe.
                     
                     Eightly, they asked him, What thing was ſweeteſt to obtaine: hee anſwered, Deſire: For the man reioyceth to remember the paines paſt, and to obtayne to that he deſireth preſent.
                     
                     Ninthly, they asked him, when the enuious man is quyet: he anſwered, when he ſeeth his enemy dead, or vtterly vndon For truely the proſperity of the enemie is a ſharpe knife to the enuious heart.
                     
                     Tenthly, hee was asked, What man ſhould doe to liue vprightly? Hee anſwered, to take the counſell to himſelfe, which hee giueth to another. For the vndoing of all men is, that they haue plentie of counſell for others, and want for themſelues.
                     
                     The eleuenth queſtion was, they aſked him, What profite he hath that is not couetous? whereunto hee anſwered: That ſuch a one is deliuered from the torments of his Auarice, and beſides that hee recouereth friends for his perſon: For riches tormenteth the Auaricious, becauſe hee ſpendeth them not.
                     
                     The twelfth, they asked him, What the Prince ſhould doe to gouerne others? hee anſwered, hee ought firſt to gouerne himſelfe, and then afterwards to gouerne others. For it is vnpoſſible the Rod ſhould bee right, where the ſhadow is crooked.
                     
                     By the occaſion of this laſt anſwer, I did bring in here all theſe queſtions, to the ende Princes and Rulers might Princes and Magiſtrates ſupporters of the common wealth ſee, how that euery one of them is as the rod of Iuſtice, and that the Common-wealth is none other but a ſhadow of them, which in all, and for all, ought to be right. For immediatly it is perceiued in the ſhadow of the Comon-wealth, if the Iuſtice or life of him which gouerneth, bee out of his order. Therfore concluding that all I haue ſpoken before, if a Prince would aske mee why he is a Prince: I would tell him in one word onely: that hee which is the High Prince, hath made you a Prince in this world, to the ende you ſhuld be a deſtroyer of heretikes, a father of orphanes, a friend of Sages, a hater of malicious, a ſcourge of Tyrants, a rewarder of good, a defender and protector of Churches, a plague of the wicked, a onely louer and friend of the Commonwealth, and aboue all you ought to bee an vpright miniſter of Iuſtice: beginning firſt with your owne perſon and Pallace: For in all things amendment is ſuffered, except in Iuſtice, which ought to bee equall, betweene the Prince and Commonwealth.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXXVI. What Plutarch the Philoſopher was: Of the wiſe words hee ſpake to Traian the Emperour: And how the good Prince is the head of the Publikeweale.
                     
                     
                        IN the time of Traiana the Emperour, there flouriſhed in his Court a Philoſopher named Plutarch, a man very pure, and of good life, wiſe in ſcience, and well eſteemed The deſcription of Plutarch. in Rome. For Traian the Emperor deſired greatly to haue Wiſe men in his companie, and to make notable and ſumptuous Buyldings in euery place where he came.
                     It was hee which wrote the liues of many noble Greekes and Romanes, and aboue all hee made a Booke entituled The doctrine of Princes, which hee offered to the Emperour Traian: in the which hee ſheweth his vertues, the zeale which he had to the Commonwealth, the highnes of his eloquēce, &amp; the profoundnes of his knowledge.
                     For he was elegant in writing, and pleaſant in ſpeaking: and among all other things which hee wrote in his booke, were theſe words following: moſt worthie to be noted, and written in Golden letters; And they are ſuch:
                     
                        I let thee to know Lord Traian, that thou and the Empire are but one myſticall bodie, in manner and forme of a liuely bodie: For they ſhould, and ought to be ſo correſpondent and agreeable, that the Emperor ſhould reioyce to haue ſuch ſubiects, and the Empire ought to be gladde to haue ſuch a Lord.
                     
                     
                        And to the ende wee may deſcribe the myſticall bodie, which is the Empyre, in the forme and ſhape of a natural man, you ſhall vnderſtand that the head which is aboue all, is the Prince which commaundeth all: the eyes whereby we ſee, are the good men in the Commonwealth whom we followe: the eares that heare what wee ſay, are the Subiects, which doe what wee commaund them: the tongue wherewith we ſpeake, are the Sages, of whom we heare the lawes and doctrines: the hayres which growe on our heads, are thoſe which are vexed and gricued, and that demaund iuſtice of the King: The handes and armes, are the Knights, which reſiſt the enemyes: the feet which ſuſtaineth the mēbers, are the tyllers of the ground which giueth meate to all Eſtates: the hard Bones that ſuſtaineth the feeble and ſoft Fleſh, are the Sage men, which endure the burden and trauell of the Common-wealth: the Hearts which we ſee not outwardly, are the Priuie Councellours,
                     
                     
                        Finally, the necke that knitteth the bodie with the Head, is the loue of the King, combined with the whole Realme, which make a Common-wealth,
                     
                     All the words abouenamed ſpake Plutarch the great, vnto Traian the Emperour. And truly the inuention and grace of him, proceeded of an high and deepe vnderſtanding; For the head hath three properties, which are very neceſſary for the gouernor of the Common-wealth.
                     The firſt is, that euen as the head is of all other members of the body the higheſt, ſo the authority of the Prince exceedeth the eſtates of all others.
                     For the Prince onely hath authoritie to commaund, and all others are bound to obey,
                     Admit there be many that are ſtout, rich, and noble men in the Commonwealth: The authoritie of Princes. yet all ought to knowe and acknowledge ſeruice to the Lorde of the ſame. For the noble and worthie Princes doe daily eaſe many of diuers ſeruices, but they will neuer exempt any man from their loyaltie and allegeance. Thoſe which are valiant

and mighty in a Realme, ſhould content themſelues with that wherewith the battlements doe vpon a Caſtle (that is to know) that they are hier then the rampers wherein men walke on the Wals, and lower then the pinnacles which are on the toppe: for the wiſe man of high eſtate, ought not to regard the Prince which is the high pinnacle, but ought to looke on the alleis, which are the poore comfortleſſe.
                     I would ſpeake a word, and it greeueth me (that is) whereas great Lords deſire in the commonwealth to commaund, is like vnto him that holdeth his armes and hands ouer his heade: For all that I haue heard, and for all What is moſt requiſite in the Common wealth. that I haue reade, and alſo for all that hath chanced in my time, I counſell, admoniſh, and warne all thoſe which ſhall come after this time, that if they will enioy their goods, if they will liue in ſafeguard, and if they will bee deliuered from tyranny, and liue quiet in the Common-wealth, that they doe not agree to haue in one Realme aboue one King and one Lord: For it is a generall rule, where there are many Rulers in a Common-wealth, in the end both it and all muſt periſh.
                     Wee ſee by experience, that Nature formed vs with many ſinewes, many bones, with much fleſh, with many fingers, and with many teeth: and to all this one only body had but one head: wherefore though with many eſtates the Common-wealth is ordayned: yet with one Prince alone it ought to bee ruled. If it conſiſted in mens hands to make a Prince they would then alſo haue the authority to put him down: but being true, as it is moſt true indeede, that the Prince is conſtituted by God, none but God alone ought to depriue &amp; depoſe him of his eſtate, but thinges that are meaſured by the diuine iudgment, man hath no power with razour to cut them. I know not what ambition the mean can haue? neither what enuie the loweſt can haue, nor what God the only letter vp of Princes. pride the higheſt can haue, to command, and not to obey, ſince wee are ſure, that in this myſticall body of the Common-wealth, hee which is moſt worth, ſhalbe no more eſteemed, then the fingers, or paring the nailes, or the falling of an haire from the head.
                     Let euery man the fore liue in peace in his common-wealth, and acknowledge obedience vnto his prince: and he that will not do ſo, away with him: for euen as the onely offence proceedeth of him, ſo let the onely paine reſt vpon him. For it is an old ſaying, That hee that taketh vp the ſword againſt his Maiſter, will ſhortly after lay his head at his feete. The ſecond condition is, To compare the King to the head, becauſe the head is the beginning of Mans life. The moſt part of things that euer God created, according to their natures, worke their operations, as in growing high, and towards the heauens.
                     We ſee the vapors aſcend high, the Trees budde out on high, the ſourges of the Sea mount high, and the nature Man differeth from all other creatures. of Fire is alwayes to aſcend &amp; mount on high: onely the miſerable Man, groweth downwards, and is brought low, by reaſon of the feeble and fraile fleſh, which is but Earth, &amp; commeth of earth, and liueth on earth: and in the ende returneth to earth againe, from whence he came.
                     
                        Ariſtotle ſaith well, That Man is as a Tree, planted with the rootes vpwardes: whoſe roote is the head, and the ſtocke is the bodie: the braunches are the armes, the barcke is the Fleſh, the knoties are the bones, the ſappe is the heart: (which with the braine, is the ſeate of the ſoule, firſt liuing, and laſt dying:) the rottennes is malice, the gumme is loue, the flowers are wordes: and the Fruites, are the good workes.
                     
                     
                        
To make the man to goe vprightly, his head ſhould be where his feet are, and the feete where the head is, ſith the head is the root, and the feet are the bowes: but in this caſe I ſweare that we are correſpondent to our beginning: for it our fleſh bee planted contrariwiſe, ſo much more contrary we haue our life ordered.
                     Therefore concerning our matter, I ſay, that the Realme hath no leſſe his beginning of the King, then the King of the Realme: which thing is plainely ſeene, for that the King giueth lawes and inſtitutions vnto a Realme, and not the Realme to the King. The gifts and benefits which the King giueth, cōmeth to the realm and not from the Realme to the King.
                     To inuent wars, to take truce, to make peace, to reward the good, and to puniſh the euill, proceedeth from What benfite cōmeth by a good Prince. the King to the Realme, and not to the contrary. For it appertaineth only to the Maieſty of a Prince, to commaund and ordaine: and to the common wealth to authorize and obeye him.
                     As in a great ſumptuous building it is more dāgerous, where one ſtone of the foundation doth fall, thē when ten thouſand tiles fall from the toppe: ſo he, ought more to bee blamed for one onely diſobedience committed and done to the King, and his iuſtice, then for fiue thouſand offences againſt the common wealth: For wee haue ſeene of a little diſobedience, a great ſlander ariſe in a cōmon wealth. O it is a goodly matter for a Prince to be beloued of his ſubiects, and a goodly thing alſo for the Realme to be fearefull of their King: for the king that is not loued of his Subiects, cannot liue in peace or quiet: &amp; therealm that is not fearefull of their King cannot be well gouerned. The Realme Sicilia had alwayes mighty Princes and Gouernors: for in ancient time it was gouerned by vertuous Princes, or els by cruell and malicious tyrants. In the time of Seuerus the Emperour, there raigne
                           •
                         in Cecil, a King called Lelius Pius, who had ſo many good things in him, that throughout all the Empire hee was very well eſteemed, and chiefly for foure Lawes amongſt others, he ordayned in that Realme, which were theſe following.
                     
                        Wee ordaine, that if amongſt equall 
                        Good lawes ordayned. 
                        perſons there bee any iniuries offered, that they be puniſhed, or elſe that they be aſſembled: for where enuy is rooted betweene two, it profiteth more to recōncile their good willes, then to puniſh their perſons.
                     
                     
                        Wee ordaine, that if the greateſt bee offended by the leaſt, that ſuch offence bee little reproued, and well puniſhed: for the audacite and little ſhame, and alſo the diſobedience of the ſeruant to the maſter, ought not to be reformed, but by grieuous puniſhment.
                     
                     
                        We ordaine, that if any reſiſt or ſpeake againſt the commandement of a Prince, that preſently (without delay) he ſuffer death before them all: for they may boldly by the way of ſupplication, reuerently declare their griefes, and not by ſlaunder rebelliouſly diſobey their Lords.
                     
                     
                        Wee ordaine, that if any rayſe the common wealth againſt the Prince, hee that can firſt ſtrike off his head, may lawfully without fearing any daunger of puniſhment: for his head is iuſtly taken from him, that would there ſhould be many heades in the common weale.
                     
                     Of all this before ſpoken, Herianus is the Authour, in his fourth Booke of the Kinges of Sieile, where hee putteth many and ſingular Lawes and Cuſtomes, whith the Auncients had to the great confuſion of thoſe that be preſent
                     For truely the Auncients did not onely exceede thoſe that bee preſent in their works &amp; doings: but

alſo in ſpeaking profound wordes. Therefore returning to our matter, mans life greatly trauelleth alwayes to defend the head, in ſuch ſort that a man would rather ſuffer his hand to bee cut off, then to ſuffer a wound to bee made in his head,
                     By this compariſon: I meane that a fault in a Common-wealth, is a cut which cankereth and feſtereth, but the diſobedience to a Prince is a wound which forthwith killeth. If a man did aske mee what vnion Princes ſhould haue with their Common wealth, I would anſwere them in this ſort, that the wealth of the King and Realme conſiſteth herein. That the King ſhould accompany with the good, and baniſh the euill. For it is vnpoſſible that the King ſhould bee What the Prince ought to do beloued of the Common-wealth, if the company hee hath about him be reputed vicious. Hee ſhould alſo loue his Realme without diſſimulation, and the Realme ſhould ſerue him vnfaynedly: for the Common-wealth which knoweth it to bee beloued of their Prince, ſhall not finde any thing too hard for his ſcruice.
                     Further, that the King vſe his Subiects as his children, and that the Subiects ſerue him as a Father: for generally the good Father cannot ſuffer his children to bee in danger, neyther the good children will diſobey their Father.
                     Alſo the King ought to bee iuſt in his commaundements, and the ſubiects faithfull: For if it bee a good thing in their ſeruices, to liue vnder a iuſt Law, it is much better to liue vnder a iuſt King.
                     Alſo the King ought to defend his Subiects from enemies, and they ought well to pay him his tribute: For the Prince who defendeth his people from enemies and tyranny, worthily deſerueth to be Lord of all their goods,
                     
                     Alſo the King ought to keepe his Common-wealth in quiet, and ought not to be preſumptuous of his perſō: for the Prince which is not feared, &amp; well eſteemed, ſhall neuer be obeyed in his commandement.
                     Finally, I ſay, that the good King ought to do his Realme pleaſure, and the faithfull ſubiects ought to endeauour themſelues, neuer to diſpleaſe their King. For that Prince cannot be called vnfortunate, who of his Commonwealth is loued and obeyed.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXVII. As there are two ſences in the head, ſmelling and hearing: So likewiſe the Prince which is the head of the Common-weale, ought to heare the complaints of all his Subiects, and ſhould know them all, to recompence their ſeruices.
                     
                     
                        WEe haue ſhewed, how the Prince is the commō welth. The King compared to the Common wealth and now wee will let you vnderſtand another notable thing which is this: that as all ſences are in the head, ſo ought all eſtates to bee in Princes: for the vertues which are in many ſpred and ſcattered ſhould be in one Prince found and gathered.
                     The office of the feet is not to ſee but to goe: the hands office is not to heare, but to labour: the ſhoulders not to feele, but to beare: All theſe offices are not ſeemely for the members, which are his Subiects, but appertaineth to the King alone to exerciſe them: For the head to haue eyes, &amp; no other members, meaneth nought elſe, but that onely to the Prince, and to none other, appertaineth to know all: for Iulius Caeſar
                        
knew all thoſe of his Hoſt, and named them by their proper names.
                     I counſell, and admoniſh you, Oh ye Princes all, which ſhall heare, ſee, or read this thing, that yee do reioyce to viſite, and to be viſited: to ſee and to be ſeene: to talke, and to be talked with: For the things which with your eyes you ſee not, you cannot perfectly loue. A man ought alſo to know that the head only hath eares to note, that to the king, and to none other, appertaineth to heare all, and to haue the The King the onely head of all gates open for all them that haue any ſutes: For it is no ſmall matter to a commonwealth, to heare and obtaine of the Prince eaſie audience.
                     
                        Helius Spartianus commendeth highly Tratan the Emperour, that when he was on horſeback to go to the warre, alighted againe, to heare the complaint of a poore Romaine. which thing was maruellouſly noted amongſt all the Romains: for if men were not vaine they ſhould giue a Prince more honour for one worke of Iuſtice, then for the victorie in many battells.
                     Truely to a King it is no pleaſure, but rather paine and griefe, and alſo for the common people annoyance, that their Prince alwayes ſhould be encloſed and ſhut vp. For the prince which ſhutteth his gates againſt his ſubiects. cauſeth them not to open their hearts willingly to obey him. How manie and great ſlaunders doth there ariſe in the commonwealth, only for that the prince ſometime will not ſpeake?
                     
                        Iulius Caeſar was Emperour, and the head of all the Empire, and becauſe hee was muſing of weightie matters, The death of Iulius Caeſar. and would not hearken to him which would haue reuealed the treaſon conſpired againſt him, was the ſame day, with 33. wounds in the Senate murdered. The contrarie is read of Marcus Aurelius the Emperor, who was ſo familiar with all men, that howbeit hee was chiefe of all, and that the affaires which now are diuided to manie, depended then onely of him: yet he neuer had porter of his gate, nor Chamberlain of his chamber: and for many affaires that euer hee had to dee with many men (were they neuer ſo great) hee was neuer longer then one day about thē. For truely (if I may ſay it) a prince is not worthy to be beloued, that is ſcarſe of his words, vnto thoſe which faithfully ſerue him with works: For wiſe princes ſhould be quicke in hearing, and graue in determining. For manie come to ſpeake with Princes, which thinke that their counſells ſhall not bee accepted, nor their reueſtes graunted, yet they deſire importunatly to be heard, and of truth the prince ought to heare them: For the heauie heart with ſorrowes burdened, when it is heard, is greatly lightned.
                     I would faine know why the ſence of ſmelling is onely in the head, and not in the feete, nor in the handes, neither in any other part of the bodie? Truly it ſignifieth nought elſe, but that it appertaineth to the Prince (which is the head of all) to heare, and know all, and therefore it is neceſſary hee be informed of all their liues. For the prince cannot gouerne his Commonwealth A Prince ought not to be ſparing in words. well, vnles he knoweth the particularities thereof. It is neceſſary that the Prince know the good, to the ende he may preferre them: For that Commonwealth is greatly ſlandred, wherein the euill are not puniſhed, nor the good honored. It is neceſſary that the prince know the ſage, to counſel with them: For the ancient Romaines neuer admitted any for coūſellors, but thoſe which with Phyloſophie were adorned. It is neceſſary he know the euill for to correct them: for there is a great diſorder in the Commonwealth, where without any ſhame the wickednes of the wicked is cloked &amp; vnpuniſhed. It is neceſſary the prince do know thoſe that are able to teach, for in the court

of the Romaine princes, there were alwayes Captaines, which taught and ſhewed how to handle their weapōs, and wiſe men, which taught and inſtructed them Sciences,
                     It is neceſſarie the prince knew the poore of his Realme, for to ayde and ſuccour them: For the Prince ſhould ſo gouerne the Common-wealth, that among the rich nothing ſhould abound: nor amōg the poore any thing ſhould want. It is neceſſary the Prince know the preſumptuous and malicious, for to humble What is required in a Prince for the gouernment of the Commonwealth. them: For the poore by enuie, and the rich by pride, heretofore haue detſtroyed great Commonwealths.
                     It is neceſſarie the prince know the peacekeepers, for to keepe and maintaine them in peace: For it is the duty of a prince to plucke downe the ſtout ſtomackes of the prowde, and to giue wings of fauour to the humble.
                     It is neceſſary that the Prince know them which haue done him Seruice, to the end they may be rewarded, according to theyr merites: For the ſtoute and noble hart for little fauour ſhewed vnto him, bindeth himſelfe to accompliſh great things.
                     It is neceſſary the Prince know the Noble-men of his Kingdome, to the ende that when time of need ſhall require, he might retaine and take them into his ſeruice: For it is but meete, that that man which is adorned with vertue and Nobilitie, ſhould bee preferred aboue all others in the Common-wealth.
                     Finally (I ſay) it is neceſſary, that the Prince ſhould know the murmurers, neuer to credit them: and likewiſe to know thoſe that tell the truth, alwayes to loue them. For none ſhuld be more familiar, thē the wiſe man to giue him coūſell, &amp; the vpright man, to tell the truth. And contrariwiſe, none ought to bee more abhorred of the Prince, then the Flatterer and ignorant man.
                     O how neceſſarie it is for a Prince to know &amp; vnderſtand all things in his Realme, to the end no man might deceyue him, as they doe now a dayes. For the moſt part of princes are deceiued, for none other cauſe, but for that they will not be counſelled, and informed by wiſe and diſcreet men. For, many crout

                        Helius Spartianus ſaith, that Alexander Seuerus (the xxv. Emperour of Rome) was a man very ſtoute, and vertuous, and amongſt all other things, The commendations of the Emperour Alexander Scue. us. they greatly commēded him, becauſe in his chamber he had a familiar booke, wherein he had written all the Nobles of his Realme and Empire, and when any Office was voyde, they ſaide nothing elſe to him, but that it is voyde: for the Emperour did not graunt it to him that ſought it, but (by the ſecrate information of his Booke) to him that beſt deſerued it.
                     I will and may ſweare, and all other princes ſhal wel affirme the ſame, that though they erre in diſtributing theyr Offices, they do not erre for that they would erre: Yet they cannot denie, but that they erre grieuouſly, for that they will not be enformed, and thogh they bee informed, yet it were better they were not informed at all: For he ſhall neuer giue the prince good nor perfect counſell, which (by that counſel) intendeth to haue ſome proper intereſt. The chiefeſt thing for princes, is to knowe how to chooſe the beſt in proſperitie, and how to auoyde the worſt in aduerſitie, and to know how to reward the good men liberally.
                     And truly in this caſe Noble princes ſhould haue more conſideration towards them which haue done them the worthieſt and loyalſt ſeruice, then to the importunate ſutes of his Familiar friendes: For hee ſhall thanke

the ſeruant that procureth it, but not the Prince that geueth it.
                     All that wee ſpeake is to no other purpoſe, but to perſwade, that ſith the Prince is Lord of all, it is reaſon, that hee bee enformed of the ſtate &amp; condition of all: for otherwiſe hee ſhall bee deceyued by a thouſand malicious hearts which are in the Common wealth. Therefore to conclude I ſay, if the Prince bee not enformed of the life of all, the skinne will ſeeme fleſh, the brain meate, the ſtraw corn, the braſſe golde, the gall honey, and the dregs good wine: I meane in diuiding his offices, thinking to hit the white, he ſhall oft times mil

                     CHAP. XXXVIII. Of the great Feaſt the Romanes celebrated to the God Ianus, the firſt day of Ianuary, and of the bounty and liberality of the Emperour Mareus Aurelius the ſame day:
                     
                     
                        AMong the ſolemne The feaſts of the Romanes. feaſts which the ancient Romanes vſed, this was one to the god Ianus, the which they celebrated the firſt day of the year, which now is the firſt of Ianuary. for the Hebrewes beganne their yeare in March, and the Romanes beganne at Ianuarie.
                     
                     The Romanes painted this god with two faces, ſignifying thereby the end of the yeare paſt, and the beginning of the yeare preſent. To this god Ianus was dedicated in the city of Rome a ſumptuous Temple, which they called the Temple of peace, and was in great reuerence throughout all the City: for the Citizens on this day offered great gifts and ſacrifices, becauſe hee ſhould defend them from their enemies: For there is no Nation nor people to whom warre euer ſucceeded ſo proſperouſly, but that they had rather liue in peace then in warre.
                     When the Romane Emperours went to the warres, or came from the warres, firſt they viſited the Temple of Iupiter, ſecondarily, the Temple of the Veſtall virgins, and thirdly, they viſited the Temple of the god Ianus: becauſe there was a Law in Rome, that the Emperour ſhould at his going forth to the warres viſite the Temple of Iupiter laſt of all, and at his return againe, the Temple of Ianus firſt. And let them that be deſirous of Antiquities here know, that when the Emperour ſhould goe to the warres in the Temple of the Goddeſſe Veſta, they put vppon his ſhoulders the royall mantell, and in the Temple of Iupiter all the Senators kiſſed his foote, and in the Temple of Ianus the Conſuls kiſſed his arme. For ſince the time that the cruell Sylla cauſed three thouſand neighbours to dye which kiſſed his right hand, they neuer after kiſſed the hands of any Emperour in Rome: Therefore ſith the Gentiles would not iſſue out of Rome before that firſt they had taken the benediction of The duty of euery good Chriſtian. thoſe vaine Gods: how much more ought Chriſtian Princes to doe it, which know well that their Temples are conſecrated to the true God, and ordained for his ſeruice onely. For the man that forgetteth God, and committeth his affayres to men, ſhall ſee how his buſineſſe will thriue at the hands of men. Therefore proceeding forth, the day wherein the Feaſt of the god Ianus was celebrated, euery man left his worke, and reioyced through all the ſtreetes of Rome, no more then leſſe then in the feaſts of

                        Iupiter, Mars, Venus, Berecinthia: For the feaſts of the other gods (ſith they were many in number) were not celebrated, but in certaine places in Rome. The Romanes on that day, put on their beſt apparrell, for they had a cuſtome in Rome, that hee which had not that day change of apparrell to honor the Feaſt, ſhould eyther goe out of Rome, or elſe keepe himſelfe locked in his his houſe.
                     That day they ſet on their houſes many lights, &amp; made great bonefires before their dores, and had ſundry and many playes and paſtimes: for the feaſts of vain men are more to delight their bodies then to reforme their minds. They watched all the night in the Temples, and alſo they deliuered al the priſoners which were impriſoned for debt, and with the common treaſures payd their debts. Furthermore, they had a cuſtome in Rome, that they ſhould ſuſtaine all the An ancient cuſtome in Rome. Senators (which were fallen into pouerty) with the goods of the commō
                        wealth.
                     They had that day Tables ſet before their dores, furniſhed with all ſorts of meates, ſo that that which remayned and was left, was more worth then that which was eaten, For vaine glorious men auant themſelues more of that which in bankets and feaſtes is left, then they doe of that which is eaten.
                     They ſought all that day for poore men, becauſe they ſhould be prouided of all things: For it was an auncient law, that none ſhould bee ſo hardy to make any open feaſt, except firſt hee had prouided for all them of his ſtreete.
                     The Romanes thought that if they ſpent liberally that day, the god Ianus would deliuer them from pouerty, becauſe he was the god of temporall goods.
                     And they ſayd further, that the god Ianus was a God very thankefull, and acknowledged the ſeruices that were done vnto him, and beleeued earneſtly that if they ſpent freely for his ſake, hee would requite it double. In the feaſt of this god Ianus many proceſsions were made, not altogether, but the Senate went by themſelues, the Cenſors by themſelues, the people by themſelues, the Matrones by themſelues, the Maidens by them▪ the Veſtall Virgins by themſelues, and all the ſtraunge Embaſſadors went with the captiues in proceſsion, there was a cuſtome in Rome that the ſame day the Emperor ſhold An other cuſtome in Rome. weare the Imperiall robe, all the captiues which could touch him with their hands were deliuered, and al the tranſgreſſors pardoned, exiles and outlawries were called againe. For the Roman Princes were neuer preſent in any feaſt, but they ſhewed ſome noble example of mercie, or gentlenes toward the peeple. At this time Marcus Aurelius was Emperor of Rome, and married with the beautifull Lady Fauſtina, (who in the feaſt of Ianus) leauing in proceſsion the company of the Senators, came into the proceſsion of the Captiues, the which eaſily touched his robe, whereby they obtayned liberty, the which they ſo greatly deſired: I ſay deſired; for truly the Captiue is contented with a ſmall thing. And becauſe there is no good thing by any good man done, but immediately by the wicked it is repined at: this deede was ſo contrary to the euill, as ioyfull to the good: for there is nothing bee it neuer ſo good, not ſo well done, but forthwith it ſhall bee contraried of them that be euill.
                     Of this thing I haue ſeene by experience (in this miſerable life ſundry examples) that euen as among the good one onely is noted to be chiefe: ſo likewiſe among the euill, one is

noted principall aboue the reſt. And the worſt I finde herein is, that the vertuous doe not ſo much glory of their vertue, as the euill and malitious hath ſhame and diſhonour of their vice: for vertue naturally maketh a man to bee temperate and quiet, but vice maketh him to bee diſſolute and retchleſſe.
                     This is ſpoken, becauſe in the Senate of Rome, there was a Senatour called Fuluius, whoſe beard &amp; hayres were very white, but in malice, hee was moſt cankered blacke: ſo that for his yeares hee was honoured in Rome of many, and for his malice he was hated of all.
                     The Senator Fuluius made friends in the time of Adrian to ſucceede in the Empire, and for this cauſe he had alwayes Marcus Aurelius for his competitor, and whereſoeuer hee came he alwayes ſpake euill of him, as of his mortall enemy.
                     For the enuious heart can neuer giue a man one good word. This Senators heart was ſo puffed with enuy that hee ſeeing Marcus Aurelius to obtaine the Empire being ſo young, and that hee being ſo olde could not attaine thereunto: there was no good that euer Marcus Aurelius did in the Common-wealth openly, but it was Nothing ſo hurtfull, as an enuious tongne. grudged at by Fuluius, who ſought alwayes to deface the ſame ſecretly. It is the nature of thoſe which haue their hearts infected with malice, to ſpitte out their poiſon with wordes of ſpite. Oft times I haue muſed which of theſe two are greater, the duety the good haue to ſpeake againſt the euil, or elſe the audacity the euill haue to ſpeake againſt the good: For in the World there is no brute beaſt ſo hardy, as the euill man is, that hath loſt his fame.
                     Oh would to God the good to his deſire had as much power to doe good works, as the euill hath ſtrength to his affection, to exerciſe wicked deedes: for the vertuous man findeth not one hand to helpe him in vertue to worke, yet after hee hath wrought it, hee ſhall haue a thouſand euill tongues againſt his honeſt doings to ſpeake.
                     I would all theſe which reade this my writing, would call to memory this word (which is) that among euill men the chiefeſt euill is, that after they haue forgotten themſelus to be men, and exiled both truth and reaſon, thē with all their might they goe againſt truth and vertue with their words, &amp; againſt good deeds with their tongs: for though it bee euill to bee an euill man, yet it is worſe not to ſuffer an other to bee good, which aboue all things is to bee abhorred, and not to bee ſuffered. I let you know and aſſure you, Princes and Noble men, that you in working vertuous deeds, ſhall not want ſlaunderous tongues, and though you bee ſtout, yet you muſt bee patient to breake theyr malice. For the Noble heart feeleth more the enuie of another, then hee doth the labour of his owne body. Princes ſhould not be diſmayed, neither ought they to maruell, though they bee tolde of the murmuring at their good works: For in the end they are men, they liue with men, &amp; cannot eſcape the miſeries of men: For there was neuer Prince in the World yet ſo high, but hee hath beene ſubiect to malitious tongues. Enuſe an enemie to vertue. Truly a man ought to take great pitty of Princes, whether they bee good or euill: for if they bee euill, the good hate them, and if they bee good, the euill immediately murmureth againſt them.
                     The Emperour Octauian was very vertuous, yet greatly perſecuted with enuious tongues, who on a time demaunded (ſince he did good vnto al men) why he ſuffered a few to murmur

againſt him? hee anſwered: you ſee my friends, hee that hath made Rome free from enemies, hath alſo ſet at liberty the tongues of malitious men: for it is not reaſon that the hard ſtones ſhould be at liberty, and the tender ſtones tyed.
                     Truly, this Emperour Octauian by his words declared himſelfe to bee a Wiſe man, and of a noble heart, and lightly to waigh both the murmurings of the people, and alſo the vanities of their words, which thing truly a wiſe and vertuous man ought to doe: For it is a generall rule, that vices continually ſeeke defendors, and vertues alwayes getteth enemies. In the Booke of Lawes the diuine Plato ſayth well, that the euill were alwayes double euill, becauſe they were weapons defenſiue, to defend their malitious purpoſe: and alſo carry weapons offenſiue, to blemiſh the good works of others.
                     Vertuous men ought with much ſtudy to follow the good, and with more diligence to flye from the euill: For, a good man may commaund all other vertuous men with a backe of his finger, but to keepe himſelfe onely from one euill man, hee had neede both hands, feet and friends.
                     
                     
                        Themiſtocles the Thebane ſayde, that hee felt no greater torment in the World then this, that his proper honour ſhould depend vpon the imagination of an other: for it is a cruell thing that the life and honor of one that is good, ſhould be meaſured by the tongue of an other that is euill: for as in the Forge the coales, cannot bee kindled without ſparkes nor as corruption can not bee in the ſinckes without ordure: ſo hee that hath his heart free from malice, his tongue is occupied alwayes in ſweete and pleaſant communication. And contrariwiſe out of his mouth, whoſe ſtomack is infected with malice, proceedeth alwayes words bitter and ful of poyſon: for, if out of a rotten furnace the fire burneth, it is impoſſible that the ſmoake ſhould be cleare. It is but a ſmall time, that (in prophane loue) he that is enamored, is able to refraine his loue, and much leſſe time is the wrathfull man able to hide his wrath: for the heauy ſighes are tokens of the ſorrowfull heart, and the words are thoſe that diſcloſe the malicious man.
                     
                        Pulio ſayeth in the firſt booke of Caeſars, that the Emperor Marcus Aurelius was very vertuous in all his works, ſage in knowledge, iuſt in iudgment, The prayſe of Marcus Aurelius. mercifull in puniſhment: but aboue all things he was wiſe in diſſembling, and herein he was very diſcreet: for there was neuer patient man but proſpered well in all his affayres. Wee ſee that through patience and wiſedome, many euill things become reaſonable, &amp; frō reaſonable are broght to good, &amp; from good to excellent. The contrary hapneth to them that are moued more then they need: for the man which is not patient, looketh not yet for any good ſucceſſe in his affayres, thogh they are iuſt. The Emperour Marcus oft times was wont to ſay, that Iulius Caeſar wan the Empire by the ſword, Auguſtus was Emperor by inheritance, Caligula came to it, becauſe his father conquered Germany, Nero gouerned it with tyranny, Titus was Emperor, for that he ſubdued Iury, the good Traian came to the Empire by his clemency and vertue: but I (ſayeth he) obtained the Empire through patience onely: for it is a greater patience to ſuffer the iniuries of the malitious, then to diſpute with the Sage in the Vniuerſity.
                     And this Emperour ſayde further, Patience ouercommeth many matters. in the gouernment of the Empire: I haue profited more through patience, then by ſcience: for ſcience only profiteth for the quietneſſe of the
                        
perſon, but patience profiteth the perſon, and the Commonwealth.
                     
                        Iulius Capitolinus ſaith that the Emperor Antoninus Pius was a prince very True patience deſcribed. pacient, and in ſuch ſort, that often times being in the Senate, hee ſaw both thoſe which loued him, and alſo thoſe that were againſt him with the people when they did rebell: yet his patience was ſo great, that neither his friends for the vnthankefulneſſe of themſelues, remayned ſad, neyther his enemies for any diſpleaſure by him done, did at any time complain. Meaning therefore in this Chapter, to ioine the end with the beginning: I ſay, that as the Emperour Marcus Aurelius put himſelfe among the captiues, and that this deed in Rome of all men was commended: The Senatour Fuluius could not refraine from ſpeaking, for that he had not the wit to endure it, wherfore as it were ſcoffing he ſpake theſe words to the Emperour.
                     
                        Lord, I maruell why thou yeeldeſt thy ſelfe to all, which thing for the reputation of the Empire cannot bee ſuffered, for that it is not decent for thy Maieſty.
                     
                     The Emperour Marcus Aurelius ſeeing &amp; hearing that in the preſence of them all, the Senator Fuluius ſpake vnto him theſe words, he tooke it patiently, &amp; with pleaſant countenance ſayde, The Queſtions which the Senator Fuluius propoundeth, let it bee for to morrow, becauſe my anſwere may bee the riper, and his choller the quieter. Therefore the next day following, the Emperour Marcus came into the High Capitoll (as Pulio declareth in the life of Marcus Aurelius) and ſpake theſe words.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXIX. Of the anſwer the Emperour Marcus Aurelius made to the Senatour Fuluius before all the Senate, being reproued of him for his familiaritie hee vſed to all, contrary to the maieſtie and authoritie of the Romane Emperour, wherein he painteth enuious men.
                     
                     
                        FAthers Conſcript, and ſacred Senate, I would not yeſterday anſwere to that which the Senator Fuluius ſpake vnto mee, becauſe it was ſomewhat late, and for that wee were long in ſacrifices, I thought that neyther time nor place was conuenient to anſwere thereunto. For it is a ſigne of a little wiſdome, and of great folly for a man to anſwere ſodenly to euery queſtion. The liberty that vndiſcreet men haue to demaund, the ſelfe ſame priuiledge hath the Wiſe for to anſwere: for though the demaund proceed of ignorance, yet the anſwere ought to proceede of Wiſedome:
                     Truly wiſe men were well at eaſe, if to euery demaund they ſhould anſwere the ſimple and malitious: who (for the moſt part) demaund more to vexe other men, then for to profite themſelus, more for to proue then to know: wherefore Wiſe men ought to diſſemble at ſuch demaundes: for the Sages ought to haue their eares open to heare, and their tongue tyed becauſe they ſhould not ſpeake. I The property of a wiſe man. let you know (ancient Fathers, and ſacred Senate) that that little which I know, I learned in the Iſle of Rhodes, in Naples, in Capua, and in Tharente. And all Tutors tolde mee, that the

intention and end of men to ſtudy, was onely to know to gouern themſelues amongſt the malicious: For ſcience profiteth nothing elſe, but to know how to keepe his life well ordered, and his tongue well meaſured. Therfore I proteſt to God, that which I will ſay before your ſacred preſence, I will not ſpeake it of any malice or ill will, but onely to anſwere vnto that which toucheth the authority of my perſon: for the things which touch The replye of the Emperour. the honour, ought firſt by word to be anſwered, and afterwards by ſword to be reuenged.
                     Therefore now beginning my matter, and addreſſing my words to thee Fuluius, and to that which thou ſpakeſt vnto me, asking why I ſhew my ſelfe ſo to all men: I anſwere thee: It is becauſe al men ſhould giue them ſelues to me.
                     Thou knoweſt well Fuluius, that I haue beene a Conſul as thou art, and thou haſt not beene an Emperour as I am. Therefore beleeue mee in this caſe, that the Prince being deſpiſed, cannot bee beloued of his people: The gods will not, nor the lawes doe permit, neyther the Commonwealth willingly ſhould ſuffer, that all Princes ſhould bee Lords of many, and that they ſhould not communicate but with a few: For Princes which haue beene gentle in their liues, the Ancients haue made them gods after their deathes, The Fiſher, to fiſh for many fiſhes in the riuer, goeth not with one Boate alone, nor the Mariner to fiſh in the deepe ſea, goeth not with one net onely. I meane, that the profound wills, which are deeply in the hearts, ought to bee won ſome by gifts, other by promiſes, other by pleaſant words, and other by gentle entertainement: For Princes ſhould trauell more to winne the hearts of their Subiects, then to conquere the realmes of ſtrangers:
                     The greedy and couetous harts care not, though the prince ſhutteth vp his heart, ſo that he open his cofers: but Noble and valiant men little eſteeme that which they locke vp in their cofers, ſo that their hearts bee open to theyr friends. For Loue can neuer but with loue againe be requited.
                     
                     Sith Princes are Lords ouer many, How a Prince ought to behaue himſelfe. of neceſſitie they ought to bee ſerued with manie: and beeing ſerued with manie, they are bound to ſatisfie manie: and this is as generally, as particularly, they cannot diſpence with their Seruants. For, the Prince is no leſſe bound to pay the ſeruice of his Seruant, then the maiſter is to pay the wages of the hyred labourer.
                     Therefore if this thing be true (as it is) how ſhall poore Princes do, which keepe many Realmes, and in keeping them they haue great expences, and for to defray ſuch charges, they haue but little money? For in this caſe, let euery man doe what hee will, and let them take what counſel they like beſt.
                     I would counſell all others, as my ſelfe haue experimented, that is: that the Prince ſhuld be of ſo good a conuerſation, amongſt thoſe which are his,: and ſo affable and familiar with all, that for his good conuerſation onely, they ſhould thinke themſelues well apaide. For with rewards, Princes recompence the trauells of theyr Seruants: but with gentle and faire words, they ſteale and robbe the harts of their ſubiects.
                     Wee ſee by experience, that diuers Marchants had rather buye dearer in one ſhop, becauſe the merchāt is pleaſant, then to buy better cheap in an other, wheras the merchant is churliſh. I meane that there are manie, which had rather ſerue a prince to gaine nothing but loue onely, then to ſerue an other prince for money. For there is no ſeruice better imploied, thē to him which is honeſt, good, and gracious:

and to the contrary, none worſe beſtowed then on him which is vnthākfull and churliſh.
                     In Princes Pallaces there ſhall neuer want euill and wicked men, malicious The Court neuer without flatterers. and diueliſh flatterers, which will ſeeke meanes to put into theyr Lords heads how they ſhal raiſe their rents, leuy Subſidies, inuent tributes, and borrow money: but there are none that will tell them how they ſhal winne the hearts and good willes of their Subiects, though they know it more profitable to bee well beloued, then neceſſary to be enriched.
                     He that heapeth treaſure for his Prince, and ſeparateth him from the loue of his people: ought not to bee called a faithfull ſeruant, but a mortall enemy.
                     Princes and Lords ought greatly to endeauour themſelues to bee ſo conuerſant among their Subiects, that they had rather ſerue for good Will, then for the payment of money: for if mony want, their ſeruice wil quaile: and hereof proceedeth a thouſand inconueniences vnto Princes, which neuer happen vnto thoſe that haue ſeruants, which ſerue more of good will then for money: for hee that loueth with all his heart, is not proude in proſperity, deſperate in aduerſity: neyther complayneth he of pouertie, nor is diſcontented being fauourles: nor yet abaſhed with perſecution: &amp; finally, loue and life are neuer ſeparated, vntill they come vnto the graue.
                     Wee ſee by experience, that the rablement of the poore Labourers of Sicill is more worth, then the money of the Knight of Rome: For the Labourer euery time he goeth to the field, bringeth ſome profit frō thence: but euery time the Knight ſheweth himſelfe in the market place, he returneth without money.
                     By the compariſon, I meane, that Princes ſhould bee affable, eaſie to talke with all, pleaſant, mercifull, benigne, and ſtout: and aboue all, that they bee gratious and louing, to the end that through theſe qualities, and and not by money, they may learne to winne the hearts of their ſubiectes. Princes ſhould greatly labour to bee loued, ſpecially if they will finde who ſhall ſuccour them in aduerſity, and keepe them from euill will and hatred, which thoſe Princes cānot haue that are hated: but rather, euery man reioyceth at their fall and miſery: for each man enioyeth his owne trauel, and truly the furious and ſorrowfull hearts take ſome reſt, to ſee that others haue pitty and compaſſion vpon their griefes.
                     Princes alſo ſhould endeauour themſelues to bee loued and well willed, becauſe at their death they may of all their ſeruants and friends bee lamented. For Princes ought to bee ſuch, that they may be prayed for in their life, and lamented and remembred after their death. How curſed is that Prince, and alſo how vnhappy is that Common-wealth, where the ſeruants will not ſerue their Lord, but for reward: and that the Lorde dooth not loue them but for theyr ſeruices: For there is neuer true loue where there is any particular intereſt.
                     With many ſtones a houſe is builded, and of many men and one Prince (which is the head of all) the Common wealth is made: For hee that gouerneth the Common wealth may be called a Prince, and otherwiſe not: and the Common-wealth cannot bee called or ſayde a Common wealth, if it hath not a Prince which is the head thereof.
                     If Geometrie do not deceyue me, the lime which ioyneth one ſtone with an other, ſuffereth well that it bee mingled with ſand, but the

corner-ſtone that lyeth on the toppe ought to bee medled, with vnſl
                           •
                        ked lime. And it ſoundeth vnto good reaſon: For if the nether-ſtones ſeperate, the wall openeth: but if the corner The loue of the prince to his people. ſtone ſhould ſlippe, the building incontinently falleth.
                     I ſuppſe (Fathers conſcript,) you vnderſtand very well to what end I applie this compariſon. The loue of one neighbour with an other, may ſuffer to be cold but the loue of a Prince to his people, ſhould bee true and pure.
                     I meane that the loue amongſt frends may paſſe ſometimes although it bee colde: but that loue betweene the King and his people, at al times ought to be perfect. For where there is perfect loue, there is no fayned wordes, nor vnfaithfull ſeruice.
                     I haue ſeene in Rome many debates and hurly-burlyes among the people, to haue bin pacified in one day: and one onely which betweene the Lorde and the Commonwealth ariſeth, cannot be pacified vntill death: For it is a dangerous thing for one to ſtriue with many, and for many to contend againſt one.
                     In this caſe, where the one is proud, and the other rebelles, I will not excuſe the Prince, nor yet let to condemne the people. For in the end he that thinketh himſelfe moſt innocent, deſerueth greateſt blame. And from whence thinke you commeth it, that Lords now adayes commaund vniuſt things by furie? and the Subiects in iuſt matters will not obey by reaſon, I will tell you.
                     The Lord doing of will, and not of right, would caſt the wills of all in his own braine, and deriue from himſelfe all counſell. For euen as Princes are of greater power then all the reſt: ſo they thinke they knowe more then all the reſt.
                     The contrary hapneth to ſubiects, who (beeing prouoked, I cannot tell you with what Frenſie) deſpiſing the good vnderſtanding of theyr Lorde, will not obey that which their prince willeth, for the health of them all, but that which euery man deſireth particularly: For men now a dayes are ſo fonde that euery man thinketh the Prince ſhould looke on him alone. 
                        The fondnes of our time.
                     
                     Truely it is a ſtrange thing (though it be much vſed among men) that one man ſhould deſire that the garments of all others ſhould be meete for him: which is as vnpoſſible, as if one mans Armour ſhould arme a whole multitude.
                     But what ſhall we be (Fathers conſcript and ſacred Senate) ſith our Fathers left vs this world with ſuch follie: and that in theſe debates and ſtrifes, wee theyr children, are alwayes in diſſention and controuerſie, and in this wilfalnes, wee ſhall alſo leaue our children and heyres?
                     How many Princes haue I ſeen and read of in my time, of my predeceſſors, which were vtterly vndon, by too much pride and preſumption? but I neuer read nor hearde of any, which were deſtroyed for being courteous, and louing to his ſubiects.
                     I will declare by ſome examples, which I haue read in bookes, to the end that the Lords may ſee what they Pride the ouerthrow of great perſonages. win by theyr good conuerſation, and what they looſe by being too hautie.
                     The Realme of the Sidonians was greater then that of the Chaldeans in weapons, and inferiour in antiquitie, vnto that of the Aſſyrians,. In this Realme there was Debaſtia, which was called a King of Kings, that endured two hundred and xxv. yeeres, becauſe all theſe Kings were of a commendable conuerſation. And another of Debaſtia, endured no longer then forty yeares. And our ancients tooke pleaſure of peace, wherof we are 
                           〈◊〉
                        : and were ignorant of the 
                           〈…〉
                         which wee now vſe ſo much.
                     
                        
Alwayes they deſired to haue Kings, which ſhould bee good for the Common-wealth in peace, rather then valiant and couragious in the warre: as Homere in his Ilyades ſaith:
                     
                        The auncient Egiptians called theyr Kings Epiphanes, and had a cuſtom, that Epiphanes ſhould enter into the temples barefoote: And becauſe it chanced the Epiphane on a time to come into their Church hoaſed, hee was immediately for his diſobediēce depriued and expulſed the Realme, and in his ſtead an other created.
                     
                        Homere declareth here, that this king was prowde, and euill conditioned, wherfore the Egyptians depriued him, and baniſhed him the Realme, taking oceaſion that hee did not enter into the temple barefoot. For truely when Pride the fall of many great men. Lordes are euill-willed, and not beloued, for a little trifle and occaſion the people will ariſe, and rebell againſt them.
                     The ſaid Homer ſaide alſo, that the Parthes called theyr Kings Aſſacides, and that the ſixt of that name was depriued and expulſed the Realme: for that of preſumption hee bad himſelfe to the marriage of a knight, and being bidden and deſired, would not goe to the marriage of a poore Plebeyan.
                     
                     
                        Cicero in his Tuſculanes, ſayth, That in olde time, the people perſwaded theyr Princes to communicate with the poore, and that they ſhould abſtaine &amp; flye from the rich: For among the poore they ſhould learne to bee mercifull, and with the rich they ſhall learne nothing but onely to bee prowd.
                     
                     Yee knowe right well (Fathers conſcript) how this our countrey was firſt called Great Greece, afterwards it was called Latium, and then Italie.
                     
                     And when it was called Latium, they called their kings Marrani, and truely although theyr borders were but narrow: yet at the leaſt theyr ſtoutneſſe was great.
                     The Annales of thoſe times ſay, that after the thirde Syluius, ſucceeded a Marrine, who was proude, ambicious, and euill conditioned, in ſuch ſorte, that for feare of the people, alwaies he ſlept locked vp: and therefore they both depriued him, and baniſhed him the Realme: For the auncients ſayd, That the king ſhould locke his dores at no houre of the night againſt his Subiects: neyther he ſhould refuſe in the day to giue them audience.
                     
                     
                        Tarquine which was the laſt of the ſeuen Kings of Rome, which was very vnthankfull towards his Father in law, Tarquine noted of vnthankfullnes. he was an infamie to his bloud, a traitour to his countrey, and cruell of his perſon, who alſo enforced the Noble Lucretia, and yet notwithſtanding this they doe not call him vnthankfull, infamous, cruell, traitour, nor adulterer: but Tarquine the proude: onely for that he was euill conditioned.
                     By the faith of a good man, I ſweare vnto you (Fathers conſcript) that if the miſerable Tarquin had bin beloued in Rome, hee had neuer bin depriued of the Realme, for committing adulterie with Lucretia. For in the end if euery light offence, which in youth is committed, ſhould bee puniſhed within ſhort ſpace, there ſhould be no Common-wealth.
                     All theſe euils both before and after Tarquine, were committed by the ancients in the Romaine Empire, which were ſuch as theſe, (of this young and light prince) and were nothing in compariſon The puniſhment of Tarqui vnto thee. For truly conſidering the youth of the one, and the experience of the other: the greateſt offence of the young, is but a counterfeit to the leaſt that the olde committeth.
                     
                        Iulius Caeſar laſt Dictatour, and firſt Emperour of Rome, (beeing a thing commendable both to Senatours, to ſalute the Emperour on theyr knees, and to the Emperour, to riſe againſt

them, and reſalute eache one according to this order (becauſe of preſumption, and that he would not obſerue this ceremonie,) with xxiii. woundes they diſpatched him of his life.
                     
                        Tiberius was an Emperour, whome they blame for drunkennes. Caligula was an Emperor alſo, whome they accuſe of Inceſt with his Siſters, Nero was an Emperour, who (for that hee ſlew his Mother, and his maiſter Seneca:) hath for euer bin named cruell.
                     
                        Sergius Galba was a deuouring and a gluttonous Emperor, for that he cauſed for one onely Banket, ſeuen thouſand Bynds to be killed, Domitian was an Emperour, who was greatly noted of all euils. For all euils which in manie The miſerable end of euill Gouernours. were ſcattered, in him alone were found. All theſe miſerable Princes in the ende were betrayed, hanged, and beheaded. And I ſweare vnto ye (Fathers conſcript) that they died not for theyr vices, but becauſe they were proud and euill conditioned. For finally, the Prince for one vice onely, cannot much endamage the people: but for being too haultie and preſumptuous, and of euill conditions, they may deſtroy a Commonwealth:
                     Let Princes and great Lords be aſſured, that if they giue many occaſions of euill example, afterwardes one onely-ſuffiſeth, to ſtirre theyr ſubiects to deſtroy them. For if the Lord ſhew not his hatred, it is for that hee will not, but if the ſubiect do not reuenge, it is for that he cannot.
                     Beleue me (fathers conſcript, &amp; ſacred Senate,) that euen as the Phyſition with a little triacle purgeth many euil humors of the body, ſo the ſage Princes, with very litle beneuolence, draw out of theyr Subiects, much rancour and inward filthineſſe of heart: diuerting their euill wills into true and faithfull loue.
                     And becauſe the members ſhould be agreable with the head, in mine opinion it behoueth the people to obey the commaundements of theyr Prince and to doe honour, and to reuerence his perſon: and the good Prince to bee iuſt and equall to all in generall, and gentle in conuerſation with euery one.
                     O happy commonwealth, wherein the Prince findeth obedience in the people and the people in like manner loue in the Prince, For the loue of the Lord, ſpringeth obedience in the ſubiect: and of the obodience of the Subiects, ſpringeth loue in the Lord.
                     
                     The Emperour in Rome; is, as the Spyder in the midſt of her Cobweb: The true patterne of a vertuous Prince. the which beeing touched with the needles point, by one of the threedes of the ſame (bee it neuer ſo little) immediately the ſpyder feeleth it.
                     I meane, that all the worke which the Emperor doth in Rome, are immediately publiſhed throughout all the countrey. For in fine, ſince princes are the myrrour of all, they can not well cloake theyr vices.
                     I ſee (Fathers conſcript) that I haue bin iudged here of worldly malice, becauſe I accompanyed the captiues in proceſſion, and alſo, becauſe I ſuffered my ſelfe to bee touched with them, to the ende they might enioye the priuiledge of their libertie: and in this caſe I render moſt humble thanks vnto the immortall Gods, becauſe they made mee a mercifull Emperour: to ſet thoſe at Libertie, that were in priſon: and that they made me not a cruell tyrant, to ſet thoſe in priſon, which were at liberty. For the prouerb ſaith, that with one bean, a man may take 2. pigeons: euē ſo chanced the like herein yeſterday. For the benefite was don for thoſe miſerable Captiues: but the example of humanitie was ſhewed to all ſtrange nations. And know ye not, that whē the prince vnloſeth the irons frō the feet of the captiues, he bindeth the harts, goods, and lands of his ſubiects?

Concluding therefore I ſay, that to the Princes it were more ſafety, and to the Common wealth more profite, to be ſerued in their Pallaces by free hearts with loue: then by ſubiects which are kept vnder by feare.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XL. Of a Letter which the Emperour Marcus Aurelius ſent to his friend Pulio, declaring the opinion of certaine Philoſophers concerning the felicitie of man.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArcus Aurelius Emperour of Rome, tribune of the people, high Biſhop, ſecōd Conſull and Monarche of al the Romane Empire, wiſheth to thee Pulio his olde friend, health to thy perſon, and proſperitie againſt thy euill fortune. The letter that thou wroteſt vnto mee from Capua, I receyued here at Bethinia, and if thou diddeſt write it with a good heart, I did reade it with willing eyes: wherof thou oughteſt ſomewhat to content thee: For it is an olde ſaying of Homer, That that which is well viewed with the eyes, is tenderly beloued of 
                        A true ſaying of Homer. 
                        the heart. I proteſt vnto thee by the faith of the immortall gods, that I do not write vnto thee as a Romane Emperour, that is to ſay, from the Lord to the ſeruant: for in this ſorte, I ſhould write vnto thee briefe, and touching the purpoſe: which thing ought not to bee done to the peculiar friend: For the Letters of graue men ſhould neuer beginne, and the Letters of vs friends ſhould neuer end. I write vnto thee my friend Pulio, as to a priuate friend, to an olde companion of mine, and as to him, which is a faithfull ſecretary of my deſires, and in whoſe company I was neuer diſpleaſed, in whoſe mouth I neuer found lye, and in whoſe promiſe there was neuer breach made. And the thing being thus. I ſhuld commit treaſon in the law of friendſhip, if I keepe ſecret from thee any of my inward conceites: for all the griefes which lye buried in the wofull heart, ought not to bee communicated but with a faithfull friend.
                     Doeſt thou thinke Pulio, that the Romane Emperour hath little trauell to write vnto thee as Emperour, to ſpeake as Emperour, to walke as Emperour, A deſcription of a perfect friend. and to eate as Emperour: and finally, to bee as Emperour indeed: Certes I do not maruell hereat. For truely the life of the vertuous Emperour, is but a Dyall which ordereth or diſordereth the Common-wealth: and that whereof I maruell, is of the folly of Rome, and vanity of the Common wealth. For as much as all ſay, that the Prince (if he will ſeem graue, and be well eſteemed of the people) ought to goe ſoftly, to ſpeake little, &amp; to write briefly: ſo that for writing of letters they will he be briefe, and for conquering of ſtrange Realmes, they doe not rebuke him although hee be long.
                     Wiſe men ſhould deſire that their Princes be of gentle condition, to the end they fall not to tyranny, That they haue their mind vncorrupted to miniſter to all equall iuſtice, that their thought bee good, not to deſire ſtraunge Realms, that they haue their hearts voide from wrath, that they bee ſound within to pardon iniuries, that they loue their Subiects to bee ſerued of them, that they know the good to honour them, and that they know the euill to puniſh them: and as for the ſurplus, we little regard whether the King go faſt, whether he eate

much, or write briefe. For the danger is not in that which is in the lacke of his owne perſon: but it is in the negligence that he vſeth in the commonwealth.
                     I haue receyued (my Friend Pulio) great comfort of thy letter, but yet much more I ſhould haue receiued of thy preſence: for the letters of auncient friends, are but as a remembrance of times paſt.
                     It is a great pleaſure to the Mariner, to talke of the perils paſt (being in the hauen, and to the Captain to glorie of the battell, after the victorie.)
                     I meane aboue all pleaſures this is the What pleaſure it is to remember dāgers paſt. greateſt to men, beeing now faithfull friends, to talke of the trauells &amp; dangers which they had paſſed, when they were young men. Belieue me in one thing, &amp; do not doubt therof: There is no man that knoweth to ſpeak, that knoweth to poſſeſſe, nor that cā iudge or take any pleaſure, neyther that well knoweth how to keep the goods which the gods haue giuen him, vnleſſe it be hee that hath bought it deerely, with great trauell. For with all our hearts wee loue that thing, which with our owne proper labour and trauell wee haue gotten.
                     I aske thee one thing: who is hee that oweth moſt to the Gods, or that is moſt eſteemed amongſt men? of Traian the iuſt, which was brought vp in the Warres of Dace, Germanie, and Spaine? or of Nero the cruell, which was nouriſhed in all the deliciouſnes of Rome. Truely the one was none other then a Roſe among bryers, and the other, was but a Nettle amongſt flowers. I ſpake this, becauſe the good Traian hath gouerned his life in ſuch ſorte, that alwayes they will ſmell the Roſe by the pleaſant ſauour: but the cruell Nero hath left the ſting the nettle of his infamie. I will not ſpeake all, becauſe many are, and were made good, but for the moſt part the princes which were brought vp deliciouſly; gaue euery man occaſion that al ſhuld be offended, for the euill gouernance of their liues in their Realmes: and becauſe they neuer experimented any kinde of trauell in themſelues, they do little eſteeme the paines of another.
                     I will not that thou thinke my friend Pulio, that I haue forgotten the time that is paſt, though the Gods brought me to the Empire preſent. For thogh we together were toſſed with the torments of youth, yet now wee may repoſe our ſelues in the calmes of our age. I do remember, that thou and I did ſtudy in Rhodes in letters, and after we had ſowen weapons in Capua, it hath pleaſed the gods that the ſeedes of my Fortunes ſhould ripen heere in Rome: and to thee, and to others better then I, Fortune would not giue one only eare. I doe not giue thee licence, that thy thought be ſuſpicious of me, ſith thou of my hart art made a faithfull Friend: for if vnconſtant Fortune doth truſt mee, to gather with trauell the grape, know thou that heere in my palace, thou ſhalt not want of the wine. The Gods will not ſuffer, that now in this moment, thou ſhuldſt find my heart ſhut from thee, whoſe gates Two good properties of Marcus Aurelius. I found alwaies (for the ſpace of twentie yeares) open vnto mee. Sith that my Fortunes wrought me to the Empire, I haue alwayes had two things things before mine eyes: that is to ſay, not to reuenge my ſelfe of mine enemies, neither to bee vnthankfull to my friends: For I pray to the Gods daylie, rather then hereafter, through vnthankfulnes my renowm ſhould be defamed: that euen now with forgetfulnes my bodie ſhould be buryed.
                     Let a man offer to the Gods what ſacrifices he will, let him doe as much ſeruice to men as he can: yet if he be vnthankfull to his friend, hee ought in all, and for all, to bee vtterly condemned. Becauſe thou ſhouldeſt ſee my

friend Pulio, how greatly the auncient friend ought to bee eſteemed, I will declare thee an example of a Philoſopher, the which to heare, thou wilt ſomewhat reioyce.
                     The auncient Hiſtories of the Grecians declare, that among the ſeuen Sages of Greece, there was one named Periander, who was Prince &amp; Gouernour a great while: and he had in him ſuch liuelineſſe of Spirit on the one ſide, and ſuch couetouſneſſe of worldly goods on the other ſide, that the Hiſtoriographers are in doubte, whether was the greater, the Philoſophy that hee taught reading in the Schooles, or the tyranny that hee vſed in robbing the Common-wealth: for truly the ſcience which is not grounded of truth, bringeth great damages to the perſon.
                     In the ſecond yeare of my Empire, I was in the City of Corinth, where I ſaw the Graue which contained the bones of Periander, where about was engrauen in Greeke verſes and old letter this Epitaph.
                     
                        Within the compaſſe of this narrow graue,
                     
                     
                        Wretched Periander, encloſed lyes,
                     
                     
                        Whoſe cruel facts, could Greece alone not haue
                     
                     
                        So ſmall a ſoyle his hunger could ſuffice. 
                        The Epitaph of Periander.
                     
                     
                        Here lodgeth oke, loe Periander dead,
                     
                     
                        His filthy fleſh, the hungry wormes doe eate,
                     
                     
                        And liuing he, with Orphelines good was fed
                     
                     
                        His greedy guts did craue ſuch dainty meate.
                     
                     
                        The Tyrant Periander ſtayeth here,
                     
                     
                        Whoſe life was built, to hinder all the reſt,
                     
                     
                        And eke whoſe death, ſuch profit large did bear
                     
                     
                        As brought reliefe to him that had the leaſt.
                     
                     
                        Here wicked Periander, reſteth now,
                     
                     
                        His life did cauſe great peopled realmes decay:
                     
                     
                        His death that forſt, his liuing ſprite to how,
                     
                     
                        Aſſurde them life, that ſtoode in brittle ſtay.
                     
                     
                        The curſed Periander heere doth lye,
                     
                     
                        Whoſe life did ſhed the poore and ſimple blood:
                     
                     
                        And eke that clambe, to riches rule ſo hye,
                     
                     
                        By others ſwette, they ſought for waſting good.
                     
                     
                        Of Corinth loe, here Periander reſt,
                     
                     
                        To ſeeme for iuſt, that equall Lawes did frame
                     
                     
                        Yet flitting from the ſquare that they poſſeſt,
                     
                     
                        By vertues doome, deſerude a Tyrants name,
                     
                     
                        The Catiue Periander ſleepeth here,
                     
                     
                        That finiſht hath his 80. years with ſhame,
                     
                     
                        And though his life that thouſands bought ſo deer
                     
                     
                        Be faded thus, yet bloometh ſtil his blame.
                     
                     There was more letters on the graue, but becauſe it was alone in the fielde, the great waters had worne it, ſo that ſcarſely the letters could bee roade: and truely it was very olde, &amp; in his time it ſeemed to bee a ſumptuous thing, but the negligence of reparation loſt it quite: and it is not to bee maruelleed at, for in the end time is of ſuch power, that it cauſeth

renowmed men to be forgotten and all the ſumptuousbuildings to decay and fall to the earth.
                     If thou wilt know, my friend Pulio, in what time the tyrant this Philoſopher was, I will thou know, that when Catania the renowned City was builded in Cicilia, neere the Mount Ethna, and when Perdica was the 4. King of Macedonia, and that Cardiced was the third King of the Medes, and when Candare was fift king of the Libeans, and that Aſſaradoche was ninth King of the Aſſyrians, and when Merodache was twelfth King of the Caldeaus, and that Numa Pompilius raigned ſecond King of the Romanes: and in the time of thoſe ſo good Kinges, Periander raigned amongſt the Aſſirians.
                     And it is meete thou know an other thing alſo which is this, That this Periander was a Tyrant, not only in deede, but alſo in renowme: ſo that they ſpake of no other thing thorow Greece, but it tended hereunto: Though hee had euill works, hee had good words, and procured that the affayres of the Common-wealth ſhould bee well redreſſed. For generally, There is no man ſo good, but a man may finde ſomewhat in him to bee reproued: neyther any man ſo euill, but hee hath ſome thing in him to bee commended.
                     
                     I doe yet remember (of my age, being neyther too yong, nor too old) that I ſaw the Emperour Traian my Lord, ſuppe once in Agrippine: and it ſo chanced, that wordes were moued to ſpeake of good and euill Princes in times paſt, as wel of the Greekes as of the Romans, that all thoſe which were preſent there, cōmended greatly the Emperour Octauian, and they all blamed the cruell Nero: for it is an ancient cuſtom to flatter the princes An vſuall cuſtome among all Nations. that are preſent and to murmur at Princes that are paſt.
                     When the good Emperour Traian was at dinner, and when he praied in the Temple, it was maruell if any man ſaw him ſpeake any word: and that day, ſince hee ſaw that they exceſsinely prayſed the Emperour Octauian, and that the others charged the Emperour Nero with more then needed: the good Traian ſpake vnto them theſe words. I am glad you commend the Emperour Octauian, but I am angry you ſhould in my preſence ſpeake euill of the Emperour NERO, and of none other: for it is great infamy to a Prince being aliue, to heare in his preſence any Prince euill reported after his death. Truely the Emperour Octauian was very good, but yee will not deny me but hee might haue beene better: and the Emperour Nero was very euill: but you will graunt mee hee might haue beene worſe. I ſpeake this, becauſe Nero in his firſt fiue yeares was the beſt of all, and the other nine following he was the worſt of all: ſo that there is both cauſe to diſprayſe him, and alſo cauſe to commend him.
                     When a vertuous man will ſpeake of Princes that are dead before Princes which are aliue, hee is bound to prayſe onely one of their vertues that they had, and hath no licence to reueale the vices whereof they were noted: for the good deſerueth reward, becauſe he endeauoureth himſelfe to follow vertue: and the euill likewiſe deſerueth pardon, becauſe through frailety he hath conſented to vice.
                     All theſe wordes the Emperour Traian ſpake, I being preſent, &amp; they were ſpoken with ſuch fiercenes, that all thoſe which were there preſent both chaunged their colour, and alſo refrayned their tongues. For truly the ſhameleſſe man feeleth not ſo much a great ſtripe of correction, as the gentle heart doth a ſharpe worde of admonition.
                     I was willing to ſhew thee theſe

things, my friend Pulio, becauſe that ſince Traian ſpake for Nero, and that hee found in him ſome prayſe, I doe thinke no leſſe of the tyrant Periander, whom though for his euill works hee did, wee doe condemne: yet for his good words that he ſpake, and for the good lawes which hee made, wee doe prayſe: For in the man that is euill, there is nothing more eaſier then to giue good counſell, and there is nothing more harder then to work well,
                     
                        Periander made diuers lawes for the Common wealth of the Corinthians, whereof here following, I wil declare ſome.
                     
                        Wee ordaine and command, that if any by multiplying of wordes kill another (ſo that it were not by treaſon) 
                        Diuers laws made by to Periander the tyrant. 
                        that hee bee not therefore condemned to dye, but that they make him ſlaue perpetuall to the brother of him that is ſlaine, or to the next of his kinne or friendes: for a ſhort death is a leſſe paine then a long ſeruitude.
                     
                     
                        Wee ordaine and commaund, that if any thiefe bee taken, hee ſhall not dye, but with a hote yron ſhall bee marked on the forehead to bee knowne for a theefe: for to ſhameleſſe men long infamy is more paine then a ſhort life.
                     
                     
                        wee ordaine and commaund, that the man or woman, which to the preiudice of an other ſhall tell any lye, ſhall for the ſpace of a moneth carry a ſtone in their mouth: for it is not meete that hee which is wont to lye, ſhould álwayes bee authorized for to ſpeake.
                     
                     
                        Wee ordaine and commaund, that euery man or woman, that is a quarreller and ſeditious perſon in the common wealth, bee with great reproach baniſhed from the people: for it is vnpoſſible that hee ſhould be in fauour with the gods, which is an enemy to his neighbor.
                     
                     
                        Wee ordaine and commaund, that if there bee any in the Common wealth, that haue receyued of an other a benefite, and that afterwards it is proued he was vnthankefull, that in ſuch caſe they put 
                        The puniſhment of ingratitude. 
                        him to death: for the man that of benefites receyued is vnthankefull, ought not to liue in the world among men.
                     
                     Behold therefore my friend Pulio, the antiquity which I declared vnto thee, and how mercifull the Corinthians were to murtherers, theeues and Pirates: And contrary, how ſeuere they were to vnthankefull people, whom they commaunded forthwith to be put to death.
                     And truely in mine opinion the Corinthians had reaſon, for there is nothing troubleth a wiſe man more, then to ſee him vnthankefull to him, whom heo hath ſhewed pleaſure vnto. I was willing to tell thee this hiſtory of Periander for non other cauſe but to the end thou ſhouldeſt ſee and know, that for as much as I do greatly blame the vice of vnthankefulnes, I will labour not to bee noted of the ſame: For hee that reproueth vice, is not noted to be vertuous: but hee which vtterly flyeth it.
                     Count vpon this my word that I tell thee, which thou ſhalt not thinke to bee fayned, that though I bee the Romane Emperor, I will be thy faithfull friend, and will not fayle to bee thankeful towards thee. For I eſteeme it no leſſe glory to know how to keep a friend by wiſdome: then to come to the eſtate of an Emperour by Phyloſophy.
                     By the letter thou ſenteſt, thou requiredſt me of one thing to anſwere thee: for the which I am at my witts end: For I had rather open my treaſure to thy neceſſities, then to open the books to anſwer to thy demands, although it be to my coſt. I confeſſe thy requeſt to be reaſonable, and thou deſerueſt worthy prayſe: for in the end it is more worth to know, how to procure a ſecret of Antiquities paſt, then to heape vp treaſures for the neceſſities

in time to come.
                     As the Philoſopher maketh Philoſophie his treaſure of knowledge to liue in peace, and to hope, and to looke for death with honour, ſo the couetous (being ſuch a one as hee is) maketh his treaſure of worldly goods for to keepe and preſerue life in this world in perpetual warres, and to end his life, and take his death with infamy. Herein I ſweare vnto thee, that one day employed in Philoſophy is The commendation of Phyloſophy. more worth, then ten thouſand which are ſpent in heaping riches: For the life of a peaceable man is none other then a ſweet peregrination: and the life of ſeditious perſons is none other but a long death.
                     Thou requireſt me, my friend Pulio, that I write vnto thee wherein the Ancients in times paſt had their felicity: know thou that their deſires were ſo diuers, that ſome diſprayſed life, others deſired it: ſome prolonged it, others did ſhorten it: ſom did not deſire pleaſure but trauels, others in trauels did not ſeeke but pleaſures: that which variety did not proceede, but of diuers ends, for the taſtes were diuers, and ſundry men deſired to taſt diuers meates. By the immortall gods I ſwear vnto thee, that this thy requeſt maketh me muſe of thy life, to ſee that my Philoſophy anſwereth thee not ſufficiently therein: For if thou aske to proue mee, thou thinkeſt mee preſumptuous: if thou demaund in mirth, thou counteſt mee to bee too light, if thou demaundeſt it not in good earneſt, thou takeſt mee to bee ſimple: if thou demaundeſt mee for to ſhew it thee, be thou aſſured I am ready to learne it: if thou demandeſt it for to know it, I confeſſe I cannot teach it thee: if thou demandeſt it becauſe thou mayeſt be asked it, be thou aſſured that none will bee ſatisfied with my anſwere: and if perchance thou doeſt aske it, becauſe ſleeping haſt dreamed it, ſeeing that now thou art awake, thou oughteſt not to beleeue a dreame: for all that the fantaſie in the night doth imagine, the tong doth publiſh it in the morning.
                     O my friend Pulio, I haue reaſon to complaine of thee, for ſo much as thou doeſt not regard the authority of my perſon, nor the credite of thy Philoſophy, wherefore I feare leaſt they will iudge thee too curions in demaunding, and mee too ſimple in anſwering: all this notwithſtanding, I determine to anſwere thee, not as I ought, but as I can, not according to the great thou demaundeſt, but according to the little I know, And partly I doe it to accompliſh thy requeſt, and alſo to fulfill my deſire. And now I thinke that all which ſhal reade this letter, will bee cruell Iudges of my ignorance.
                     
                        
                           Of the Philoſopher Epicurius.
                        
                           IN the Olimpiade: 103. Serges being King of Perſes, and The battell betweene the Athenians and Lyſander. the cruell tyrant Lyſander Captaine of the Peloponenſes, a famous battell was fought betweene the Athenians and Lyſander, vpon the great Riuer of Aegeon, whereof Lyſander had the victory: and truly vnleſſe the hiſtories deceyue vs, the Athenians took this conflict grieuouſly, becauſe the battell was loſt more through negligence of their Captaines then through the great number of theyr enemies.
                        For truely many winne victories more through the cowardlineſſe that ſome haue, then for the hardineſſe that others haue. The

Philoſopher Epicurus at that time floriſhed, who was of a liuely wit, but of a meane ſtature, and had memorie freſh, being meanely learned in Philoſophy, but he was of much eloquēce and for to encourage and counſell the Athenians, he was ſent to the warres: For when the Ancients tooke vpon them any warres, they choſe firſt Sages to giue counſeil, then Captains to leade the ſouldiers. And amongſt the Priſoners the Philoſopher Epicurus was taken, to whom the tyrant Lyſander gaue good entertainement and honoured him aboue all other: and after hee was taken, hee neuer went from him, but read Philoſophy vnto him, and declared vnto him hiſtories of times paſt, and of the ſtrength and vertues of many Greekes and Troians. The tyrant Lyſander reioyced greatly at theſe things: For truly tyrants take great pleaſure to heare the proweſſe and vertues of Ancients paſt, and to follow the wickedneſſe and vices of them that are preſent.
                        
                        
                           Lyſander therefore taking the triumph, and hauing a Nauie by ſea, and a great Army by land, vpon the riuer of Aegeon, he and his Captaines forgot the danger of the wars, and gaue the bridle to the flothfull fleſh, ſo that to the great preiudice of the Common wealth they led a diſſolute and idle life. For the manner of tyrannous Princes is, to leaue off their ownt trauell, and to enioy that of other mens.
                        
                        The Philoſopher Epicurus was alwayes brought vp in the excellent Vniuerſity of Athens, whereas the Philoſophers liued in ſo great pouerty, that naked they ſlept on the ground: The pouerty of the Philoſophers of Athens. their drinke was colde water, none amongſt them had any houſe proper: they deſpiſed riches as peſtilence, and labored to make peace where diſcord was, they were onely defenders of the Common wealth, they neuer ſpake any idle word, and it was a ſacriledge amongſt them to heare a lye: and finally, it was a Law inuiolable amongſt them, that the Philoſopher that ſhould bee idle ſhould bee baniſhed, and he that was vicious ſhould be put to death.
                        The wicked Epicurius forgetting the doctrine of his Maſter, and not eſteeming grauity (whereunto the Sages are bound) gaue himſelfe wholly both in words and deedes vnto a voluptuous &amp; beaſtly kind of life wherin he put his whole felicity. For hee ſayde, There was no other felicity for ſlothfull men, then to ſleepe in ſoft beds: for delicate perſons to feele neyther hote nor cold: for fleſhly men to haue at their pleaſure amorus Dames: for drunkards not to want any pleaſant wines, and gluttons to haue their fils of al delicate meats: for herein hee affirmed to conſiſt all worldly felicity.
                        I doe not maruell at the multitude of his Schollers which hee had, hath, and ſhall haue in the world. For at this day there are very few in Rome, that ſuffer not themſelues to be maſtered with vices: and the multitude of thoſe which liue at their owne wils and ſenſuality, are infinite. And to tell the truth, my friend Pulio, I do not maruell that there hath been vertuous, neither doe I muſe that there hath beene vitious: for the vertuous hopeth to reſt himſelfe with the Gods in an other World by his well doing: and if the vitious bee vitious, I doe not maruell, though he will goe and engage himſelfe to the vices of this world, ſince he doth not hope, neyther to haue pleaſure in this, not yet to enioy reſt with the gods in the other. For truly the vnſtedfaſt beleefe of an other life (after this) wherein the wicked ſhall bee puniſhed, and the good 
                           The ſmall hope of the wicked. 
                           rewarded cauſeth that now a dayes the victous and vices raigne ſo as they doe.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           Of the Philoſopher Eſchilus.
                        
                           
                              ARtabanus beeing the ſixt king of Perſians, and Quintus Concinatus the husbandman The Philoſopher Aeſchilus deſcribed. beeing onely Dictator of the Romanes, in the Prouince of Tharſe, there was a Philoſopher named Aeſchilus, who was euill fauoured of countenance, deformed of body, fierce in his lookes, and of a very groſſe vnderſtanding, but hee was fortunate of credite: for he had no leſſe credite amongſt the Tharſes, then Homer had among the Greekes: They ſay, that though this Philoſopher was of a rude knowledge, yet otherwiſe he had a very good naturall wit, and was very diligent in harde things, and very patient with theſe that did him wrong, hee was exceeding couragious in aduerſity, and moderate in proſperities. And the thing that I moſt of all delighted in him was, that hee was courteous and gentle in his conuerſation, and both pithie and eloquent in his communication. For that man onely is happy, where all men prayſe his life, and no man reproueth his tongue.
                        
                        The auncient Greekes declare in their Hiſtories, that this Philoſopher Aeſchilus was the firſt that inuented Aeſchilus the firſt inuenter of Tragedies. Tragedies, and that got money to repreſent them: and ſith the inuention was new and pleaſant, many did not onely follow him, but they gaue him much of their goods.
                        And maruel not thereat my friend Pulio, for the lightneſſe of the Common people is ſuch, that to ſee vaine things all will runne: and to heare the excellency of vertues, there is not one will goe.
                        After this Philoſopher Aeſchylus had written many bookes ſpecially of Tragedies, and that he had afterward trauelled through many Countries &amp; Realmes, at the laſt hee ended the reſidue of his life, neare the Iſles which are adioyning vnto the Lake of Meatts.
                        
                        For as the diuine Plato ſaveth, when the auncient Philoſophers were young, they ſtudied, when they came to be men they trauelled, and then when they were old they retyred home.
                        
                        In mine opinion this Philoſopher was wiſe to do as he did, and no leſſe ſhall men now a dayes bee that will imitate him. For the Fathers of wiſdome are Science and Experience: and in this conſiſteth true knowledge when the man at the laſt returneth home from the troubles of the World.
                        Tell me, my friend Pulio, I pray thee, what dooth it profite him that hath learned much, that hath heatd much, that hath knowne much, that hath ſeene much, that hath beene farre, that hath bought much, that hath ſuffered much, and hath proued much, that had much, if after great trauell he doth not retire to repoſe himſelfe a little: truly hee cannot be counted wiſe but a foole that willingly offereth himſelfe to trauell, &amp; hath not the wit to procure himſelfe reſt: for in mine opinion, the life without reſt, is a long death.
                        By chance as this ancient Philoſopher was ſleeping by the lake Meatis, a Hunter had a Hare with him in a Cage of woode to take other Hares by: whereon the Eagle ſeazed, which tooke the Cage with the Hare on high: and ſeeing hee could not eate it, hee caſt it downe againe, which fell on the heade of this Philoſopher, and killed him.
                        This Philoſopher Aeſchylus was

demaunded in his life time, wherein the felicity of this life conſiſted? hee anſwered, that in this opinion it conſiſted in ſleeping, and his reaſon was Aeſchilus his opinion, wherein the felicity of this life conſiſted. this, that when wee ſleepe the entiſements of the fleſh do not prouoke vs, nor the enemy perſecute vs, neyther the friends do importune vs, nor the colde winter oppreſſe vs, nor the heate of long Sommer doth annoy vs, nor yet wee are not angry for any thing wee ſee, nor wee take any care for any thing we heare.
                        Finally, when wee ſleepe, wee feele not the anguiſhes of the body: neyther ſuffer the paſſion of the mind to come.
                        To this end yee muſt vnderſtand that when they were troubled, hee gaue them drinks, which cauſed them immediatly to ſleepe, ſo that ſo ſoone as the man did drinke it, ſo ſoone hee was a ſleepe.
                        Finally, all the ſtudy wherein the Epicurians exerciſed themſelues, was in eating and ſeeking meates: and the chiefe ſtudy of this Aeſchilus was in ſleeping, and hauing ſoft beds,
                     
                     
                        
                           Of the Philoſopher Pindarus.
                        
                           IN the yeare of the foundation of the City of Rome, 262. Darius the ſecond of that name, King of Perſia, who was the ſonne of Hiſtapſie, and in the lynage of Kinges, the fourth King of Perſia, Iunius Brutus, and Lucius Collatinus being Conſuls in Rome which were the firſt Conſuls that were in Rome.
                        
                        There was in the great City of Thebes in Egypt, a Philoſopher named Pindarus, who was Prince of that Realme. They write of this Philoſopher, that in Philoſophy he excelled all thoſe of his time, and alſo in teaching, ſinging, and playing of Muſicke, hee was more excellent then any of all his Predeceſſors: for the Thebanes affirmed, that there was neuer any ſeen of ſuch aptnes in ſpeaking and ſo excellent deliuering of his fingers in playing, as Pindarus was: and moreouer hee was a great Morall Philoſopher, but not ſo excellent in naturall Philoſophy: For hee was a quiet and vertuous man, &amp; could better worke then reach, which thing is contrary now a dayes in our Sages of Rome. For they know little, and ſpeake much: and worſt of all in their wordes they are circumſpect, and in their deedes very negligent. The diuine Plato in his booke that he made of Lawes, mentioneth this Philoſopher, and Iunius Ruſticus in his Thebaide ſheweth one thing of him, and that is, that an Ambaſſadour of Lides being in Thebes, ſeeing Pindarus to bee of a vertuous life, and very diſagreeable in his words, hee ſpake vnto him in ſuch words.
                        O Pindarus, If thy wordes were ſo limed before men, as thy workes are pure before the Gods, I ſweare vnto thee by thoſe Gods that are immortall, that thou ſhouldeſt bee as much eſteemed in Life, as Promotheus was; and ſhouldeſt leaue as much memory of thee after thy death in Egypt, as the great Homere left of his life in Greece.
                        They demaunded of this Pindarus wherein felicity conſiſted? hee aunſwered: In ſuch ſort yee ought to 
                           Wherein true felicity conſiſteth. 
                           know, that the inward ſcule followeth in many things (for the moſt part) the outward body: the which thing preſuppoſed I ſay, that hee that feeleth no griefe in his body, may well bee called happy: For truly if the fleſh bee not well, the heart can haue no reſt.
                        
                        Therefore according to the counſell

of Pindarus, the Thebanes were aboue all other Nations and people moſt diligent to cure the diſeaſes of their bodies. Annius Seuerus ſayth, that they were let bloud euery month for the great aboundance of bloud in their bodies. They vſed euery weeke vnmitations for the full ſtomackes.
                        They continued the bathes for to auoide opilations. They carried ſweet fauours about them againſt the euill and infected ayres. And finally, they ſtudyed nought elſe in Thebes, but to preſerue and keepe their bodies as deliciouſly as they could inuent.
                     
                     
                        Of the Philoſopher Zeno.
                        IN the Olimpiade 133. Cneus Seruillus, and Caius Briſius then Conſuls Of the Philoſopher Zeno. in Rome, which were appointed againſt the Artikes in the moneth of Ianuary, immediately after they were choſen: and in the 29. yeare of the raigne of Ptolomeus Philadelphus, this great Prince Ptolomeus built in the coaſt of Alexandry a great Tower which hee named Pharo, for the loue of a louer of his named Pharo Dolouina. This Tower was built vpon foure engines of glaſſe, it was large and high, made foure ſquare, &amp; the ſtones of the Tower were as bright and ſhining as glaſſe, ſo that the Tower being twenty foot of breadth, if a candle burned within, thoſe without might ſee the light thereof.
                        I let thee know my friend Pulio, that the auncient Hiſtoriograpers did ſo much eſteeme his building, that they compared it to one of the ſeuen buildings of the World.
                        At that time when theſe thinges flouriſhed, there was in Egypt a Philoſopher called Zeno, by whoſe counſell and induſtrie Ptolomeus built that ſo famous a Tower, and gouerned his land. For in the olde time the Princes that in their life were not gouerned by Sages, were recorded after their death in the Regiſter of fooles.
                        As this Tower was ſtrong, ſo hee had great ioy of the ſame, becauſe he kept his dearely beloued Pharo Dolouina therein encloſed, to the end ſhee ſhould bee well kept, and alſo well contented. He had his wiues in Alexandria, but for the moſt part hee continued with Pharo Dolouina. For in the old time, the Perſes, Siconians, and the Chaldeans did not marry, but to haue children to enherite theyr goods: and the reſidue of their life, (for the moſt part) to leade with their Concubines in pleaſure and delight: The Egyptians had it in great eſtimation that were great Wreſtlers, eſpecially, if they were wiſe men, and aboue all things, they made great defiance againſt ſtrangers: and all the multitude of wraſtlers was continually greate: ſo there were notable Maſters among them. For truly he that dayly vſeth one thing, ſhall at the laſt be excellent therein.
                        The matter was thus: That one day amongſt them, there were many Egyptians, there was one that would not bee ouerthrowne, nor caſt by any man vnto the earth.
                        This Philoſopher Zeno perceyuing the ſtrength and courage of this great Wraſtler: thought it much for his eſtimation if he might throw him in wraſtling, and in prouing he threw The ſtrength of Zeno. him dead to the earth, who of none other could euer be caſt.
                        This victory of Zeno was ſo greatly to the contentation of his perſon, that hee ſpake with his tongue, and wrote with his penne, that there was none other ioy or felicity, then to know how to haue the ſtrength of the Armes to

caſt downe others at his feet. The reaſon of this Philoſopher was, that hee ſayde it was a greater kinde of victory to ouerthrow one to the erth, then to ouerthrow many in the wars: For in the warres one onely wrongfully taketh the victory, ſince there bee many that doe winne it: but in wreſiling, as the victory is to one alone, ſo let the onely victory and glory remaine to him, and therefore in this thing felicity conſiſteth: for what can bee more, then the contention of the heart. Truly wee call him in this world happy that hath his heart content, and his body in health. 
                           Wherein felicity conſiſteth.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Of the Philoſopher Anacharſis.
                        WHen the King Heritaches raigned among the Medes, and that Tarquin Priſcus raigned in Rome, there was in the coaſts of Scithia a Philoſopher called Anacharſis, who was borne in the City of Epimenides. Cicero greatly commended the doctrine of this Philoſopher, and that he cannot tell which of theſe two things were greater in him, that is to ſay, the profoundneſſe of Knowledge that the Gods had giuen him, or the cruell malice wherewith he perſecuted his enemies. For truely as Pithagoras ſaith. Thoſe which of men are moſt euill willed, of the gods are beſt beloued.
                        This Philoſopher Anacharſis then being as he was of Scithia (which nation amongſt the Romanes was eſteemed Barbarous) it chaunced, that a malitious Romane ſought to diſpleaſe the Philoſopher in wordes: and truely hee was moued thereunto, more through malice then thorow ſimplicity: For the outwarde malitious words are a manifeſt token of the inward malitious hart.
                        This Romane therefore ſayde to the Philoſopher: It is vnpoſſible Anacharſis that thou ſhouldeſt bee a Scithian borne: for a man of ſuch eloquence cannot bee of ſuch a Barbarous Nation? To whome Anacharſis anſwered:
                        
                           Thou haſt ſayde well, and herein I aſſent to thy wordes, howbeit I doe not allow thy intention: for as by reaſon thou mayeſt diſprayſe mee to bee of a barbarous Country, and commend mee for a good life: ſo I may iuſtly accuſe thee of a wicked life, and prayſe thee of a good Country.
                        
                        
                           And herein bee thou Iudge of both, which of vs two ſhall haue the moſt praiſe in the World to come: neyther thou that art borne a Romane, and leadeſt a barbarous 
                           No reſpect of perſons with God. 
                           life: or I that am borne a Scythian, and leade the life of a Romane: For in the end, in the Garden of this life I had rather bee a greene Apple-tree and beare fruit, then to bee a drie Liban drawne on the ground.
                        
                        After that Anacharſis had been in Rome a long time, and in Greece, hee determined for the loue of his Country (now being aged) to return home to Scythia, whereof a brother of his named Cadmus was King, who had the name of a King, but in deede hee was a tyrant,
                        Since this good Philoſopher ſawe his brother exerciſe the workes of a Tyrant, and ſeeing alſo the people ſo deſolate, hee determined to giue his brother the beſt counſell he could, to ordayne lawes to the people, and in good order to gouerne them: which thing being ſeene of the Barbarous, by the conſent of them all, as a man, who inuented new deuiſes to liue in the World, before them all, openly was put to death.
                        For I will thou know O my friend Pulio, that there is no greater token that the whole Common

wealth is full of vice: then when they kill or baniſh thoſe which are vertuous therein: ſo therefore as they led this Philoſopher to death, he ſayd hee was vnwilling to take his death, and loath to loſe his life: wherefore one ſayde vnto him theſe wordes: Tell me Anacharſis, ſith thou art a man ſo vertuous, ſo ſage, and ſo olde, me thinketh it ſhould not grieue thee to leaue this miſerable life: For the vertuous man ſhould deſire the company of the vertuous men, the which this world wanteth: The Sage ought to deſire to liue with other Sages; whereof the world is deſtitute: and the olde man ought little to eſteeme the loſſe of his life, ſince by true experience hee knoweth in what trauels he paſſed his dayes: For truely it is a kind of folly for a man which hath trauelled and finiſhed a dangerous and long iourney, to lament to ſee himſelfe now in the end thereof,
                        
                           Anacharſis anſwered him. Thou ſpeakeſt very good words my friend, and I would that thy life were as thy counſell is: but it grieueth mee that in this conflict I haue neyther vnderſtanding, nor yet ſenſe to taſte, not that I haue time enough to thanke thee: For I let thee know, that there is no tongue can expreſſe the griefe which a man feeleth, when hee ought forthwith to dye. I dye, and as thou ſeeſt they kill me onely for that I am vertuous, I feele nothing that tormenteth my heart ſo much, as King Cadmus my brother doth, for that I cannot bee reuenged: For in my opinion the chiefe felicity of man conſiſteth in knowing, and being able to reuenge the iniurie done without reaſon, before a man doth end his life.
                        
                        It is a commendable thing that the Philoſopher pardon iniuries (as The opinion of Anacharſis. the vertuous Philoſophers haue accuſtomed to doe) but it ſhould bee alſo iuſt, that the iniuries which wee forgiue, the Gods ſhould therewith bee charged to ſee reuengement: For it is a hard thing to ſee a tyrant put a vertuous man to death, and neuer to ſee the Tyrant to come to the like,
                        Mee thinketh my friend Pulio, that this Philoſopher put all his felicity in reuenging an iniurie, during the like in this world.
                     
                     
                        Of the Sarmates.
                        THe Mount Caucaſus as the Coſmographers ſay, doth deuide in the middeſt great Aſia, the which beginneth in Indea, and endeth in Scithia, and according to the variety of the people which inhabite the villages, hath this mount diuers names, and thoſe which dwell towards the Indians differ much from the others. For the more the Countrey is full of mountaines, ſo much the more the people are Barbarous. Amongſt all the other Cities which are adiacent vnto the ſame, there is a kinde of people called Sarmates, and that is the Countrey of Sarmatia, which ſtandeth vpon the riuer of Tanays. There grow no vines in the Prouince, becauſe of the great colde: and it is true, that among all the Orientall nations there are no people, which more deſire Wine then they doe: For the thing which wee lacke is commonly moſt deſired.
                        Theſe people of Sarmatia are good men of Warre, though they are vnarmed, they eſteeme not much delicate meates, nor ſumptuous The felicity of the Sarmatians. apparrell: for all their felicity conſiſteth in knowing how they might fill themſelues with Wine.
                        In the yeare of the foundation of Rome, p 318. our auncient Fathers determined to wage battell againſt thoſe people, and other Barbabarous

Nations, and appointed a Conſull called Lucius Pius. And ſith in that warres fortune was variable, they made a Truce, and afterwardes all their Captaines yeelded themſelues and their country into the ſubiection of the Romane Empire, onely becauſe the Conſull Lucius Pius in a banquet (that hee made) filled them with Wine.
                        
                           
                              Within this tombe Lucius Pius lyes,

                              That whilom was a Conſull great in Rome,

                           Not in the hazard fight he did them yoke.
                           But feeding all in reſt, he ſtole their blood.

                        The ſacred Senate ſet this Epitaph here, becauſe all Romane Captaines, ſhould take example of him: For the Maieſty of the Romanes conſiſteth not in vanquiſhing their enemies by vices and deliciouſneſſe, but by weapons and prayers,
                        The Romanes were very ſore grieued with the and a city of this Conſull Lucius Pius, and not contented to haue beheaded him, and to haue ſet on his graue ſo defamous a title: but made proclamation forthwith thorow out all Rome by the ſound of a Trumpet, how al that Lucius Pius had done, the ſacred Senate condemned for nothing, and ſhould ſtand to no An ancient cuſtome in Rome. effect: For there was an auncient Law in Rome, when they beheaded any by iuſtice, they ſhould alſo take away the authority hee had in Rome.
                        
                        After the warres were ended, and all the land of Sarmatia ſubiect, the Conſull Lucius Pius came to Rome, &amp; for reward of his trauell, required the accuſtomed triumph: the which was not onely denyed him, but alſo in recompence of his fact, hee was openly beheaded, and by the decree of all the Senate, about his graue was written this Epitaph.
                        And not contented with theſe things the ſacred Senate wrote to the Sarmates, that they did releaſe them of their homage, making themſelues ſubiects of the Romanes: wherefore they reſtored them againe to their liberty.
                        They did this thing becauſe the cuſtome among the ſtoute and valiant Romanes was, not to gette nor winne Realmes in making their enemies drunke with delicate Wines, but in ſhedding their proper bloud in plaine field.
                        I haue tolde thee this my friend Pulio, becauſe the Conſull Lucius Pius did perceyue that the Sarmates put all their felicity to ingorge themſelues with wine.
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           Of the Philoſopher Chylo.
                        IN the 15. Dinaſtia of the Lacedemonians, and Deodeus beeing King of Medes, Gigion being king of Lides, Argeus being king among the Macedonians, and Tullius Hoſtilius king of the Romaines: in the Olympiade 27. there was in Athens a Phyloſopher borne in Greece, whoſe name was Chylo: one of the ſeuen Sages, which the Greekes had in theyr treaſurie.
                        In that time there was great warres betweene the Athenians, and the Corinthians, as wee may perceyue by the Greeks hiſtories which we ſee written.
                        Since Troy was ruinated and deſtroyed, there was neuer peace in Greece, for the warres betwixte the Warres in Greece, euer ſince the deſtruction of Troy. 
                           Greeks and Troyans was neuer ſo great as that which afterwards they made among themſelues.
                        Sith the Greekes were now wiſe mē, they did deuide the offices of the Commonwealth, according to the ability of euery perſon, that is to know, that to the ſtoute and hardy men they gaue the gouernment: to the ſage they recommended the Embaſies of of ſtrange countreys.
                        And vpon this occaſion the Athenians ſent the Phyloſopher Chilo to the Corinthians to treate of peace, who came vnto the cittie of Corinth.
                        
                        By chaunce on that day there was celebrated a great Feaſt, wherefore hee found all men playing at dice, the women ſolacing themſelues in theyr gardens: the Prieſtes ſhorte with theyr croſſe-bowes in the Temples: the Senatours played in the conſiſtory at tables: the maiſters of Fence played in the ſtreetes: And to conclude, hee found them all playing.
                        The Philoſopher ſeeing theſe things, without ſpeaking to any man, or lighting off from his horſe, returned to his countrey, without declaring his meſſage: and when the Corinthians went after him, and asked him why hee did not declare the cauſe of his comming, he aunſwered:
                        
                           Friends, I am come from Athens to Corinth, not without great trauell, and now I returne from Corinth to Athens not lattle offended: and yee might haue ſeene it, becauſe I ſpake neuer a word to any of you of Corinth: For I haue no commiſſion to treate of peace with vnthrifty players, but with ſage gouernours. Thoſe of Athens commaunded mee not to keepe 
                           Idlenes and paſtimes hated by the philoſopher 
                           company with thoſe that haue theyr hāds occupyed with Dyce: but with thoſe that haue theyr bodyes loden with harnes, and with thoſe which haue theyr Eyes dazeled with Bookes. For thoſe men which haue warres with the Dyce, it is vnpoſſible they ſhould haue peace with theyr Neighbours.
                        
                        After he had ſpoken theſe words, he returned to Athens. I let thee vnderſtand my friende Pulio, that the Corinthians thinke it to be the greateſt felicity in the world to occupy dayes and nights in playes: and maruel not hereat, neither laugh thou them to ſcorne. For it was told mee by a Greeke being in Antioche, that a Corinthian eſteemed it more felicitie to winne a game, then the Romaine Captaine did to winne a Triumph.
                        As they ſay the Corinthians were wiſe and temperate men, vnleſſe it were in Playes, in the which thing they were too vicious. Me thinke my friend Pulio, that I anſwer thee more amply then thou requireſt, or that my health ſuffereth, that which is little: ſo that both thou ſhalt be troubled to read it, and I here ſhall haue paine to write it.
                        I will make thee a briefe ſumme of all the others which now come to my remembrance, the which in diuerſethings haue put theyr ioy and chiefeſt felicities.

                           CRates the Philoſopher put his felicity to haue good fortune in proſperous nauigation, ſaying, that Crates the Philoſopher hee which ſayleth by ſea, can neuer haue perfect ioy at his his heart, ſo long as hee confidereth that between death and life there is but one bourd: Wherefore the heart neuer feeleth ſo great ioy, as when in the Hauen he remembreth the perils which hee hath eſcaped on the ſea.

                           EStilpho the Philoſopher put all his felicity to bee of great power, Eſtilpho. ſaying, that the man which can doe little, is worth little, and he that hath little, the gods doe him wrong to let him liue ſo long: For hee onely is happy which hath power to oppreſſe his enemies, and hath wherewithall to ſuccour himſelfe, and reward his friendes.

                           ARchita the Phyloſopher, had all his felicitie in conquering a Bartell, Archita. ſaying that naturally man is ſo much friend to himſelfe, and deſireth ſo much to come to the chiefe of his enterpriſe: that though for little trifles he played, yet he would not bee ouercome: For the heart willingly ſuffereth all the trauels of the life, in hope afterwardes to win the victory.

Thou haſt now ſufficiently vnderſtood my friend Pulio that 7. moneths ſince, I haue been taken with the feuer quartaine, and I ſweare vnto thee by the immortall Gods, that at this preſent inſtant writing vnto thee, my hand

ſhaketh which is an euident token, that the colde doth take mee, wherefore I am conſtrained to conclude this matter which thou demaundeſt mee although not according to my deſire: For amongſt true friendes, though the workes doe ceaſe wherewith they ſerue: yet therefore the inward parts ought not to quaile, wherwith they loue.
                        If thou doeſt aske mee my friend Pulio, what I thinke of all that is aboue ſpoken, and to which of thoſe I doe ſticke: I anſwere thee: That in this No perfect felicity in this world. World I doe not graunt any to bee happy, and if there be any, the gods haue them with them: becauſe on the one ſide, choſing the plaine and drye way without clay, and on the other ſide all ſtony and myerie, wee may rather call this life the precipitation of the euill, then the ſafegard of the good.
                        I will ſpeake but one word onely, but marke well what thereby I meane which is, that amongſt the miſhaps of fortune wee dare ſay, that there is no felicitie in the World: And hee onely is happy from whom wiſdome hath plucked enuious aduerſity, and that afterwards is brought by wiſedome to the higheſt felicitie. And though I would, I cannot endure any longer, but that the immortall Gods haue thee in their cuſtody, and that they preſerue vs from euill fortune: Sith thou art retired now vnto Bethinie, I know well thou wouldeſt I ſhould write thee ſome newes from Rome, and at this preſent there are none, but that the Carpentines and Luſitaines are in great ſtrife &amp; diſſention in Spaine.
                        
                        I receiued letters how that the barbarous were quiet, though the Hoſt that was in Ilium were in good caſe: yet notwithſtanding the Army is ſomwhat fearefull and timorous. For in all the coaſt and borders, there hath beene a great plague.
                        Pardon me my friend Pulio, for that I am ſo ſickly, that yet I am not come to my ſelfe: for the feuer quartane is ſo cruel a diſeaſe, that he which hath it, contenteth himſelfe with nothing, neyther taketh pleaſure in any thing. I ſend thee two of the beſt horſes that can be found in al Spaine: and alſo I ſend thee two cups of gold of the richeſt that can bee found in Alexandria. And by the law of a good man I ſweare vnto thee, that I deſire to ſend thee two or three howers of thoſe which trouble mee in my feuer quartane.
                        My wife Fauſtine ſaluteth thee and of her part, and mine alſo to Caſſia thy olde mother, and noble Widdow we haue commended.

                     CHAP. XLI. That Princes and great Lords ought not to eſteeme themſelues for being fayre, and well proportioned,
                     
                     
                        IN the time that Ioſhua triumphed amongſt the Hebrewes, and that Dardanus paſſed from great Greece to Samotratia, and when the ſons of Egenor were ſeeking their ſiſter Europe, and in the time that Siculus raigned in Scicil, in great Aſia, in the realme of Egypt, was builded a great City called Thebes, the which K. Buſiris built, of whom Diodorus Siculus at large mentioneth. Plinie in the 36. Chapter of his naturall hiſtory, and Homer in the ſecond of his Iliades, &amp; Statius in al the booke of his Thebiade doe declare great

maruels of this City of Thebes, which thing ought greatly to bee eſteemed, for a man ought not to thinke that fayned which ſo excellent authours haue written. A deſcription of the City of Thebes.
                     
                     For a truth they ſay, that Thebes was in circuit forty miles, and that the walles were thirty ſtades hie and in bredth ſixe.
                     They ſay alſo that the City had a hundred gates very ſumptuous and ſtrong, and in euery gate two hundred Horſemen watched.
                     Through the midſt of Thebes paſſed a great riuer, the which by milles and fiſh did greately profite the City.
                     When Thebes was in his proſperity, they ſay, that there was two hundred thouſand fires, and beſides all this, all the Kings of Egypt were buried in that place.
                     As Strabo ſayeth, De ſitu orbis, when Thebes was deſtroyed with enemies, they found therein ſeuenty ſeuen Strabo de ſitu orbis. Tombes of Kings which had bin buried there.
                     And here is to bee noted, that all thoſe tombes were of vertuous kings: for among the Aegyptians it was a law A Law among the Aegyptians inuiolable, that the King which had beene wicked in his life ſhould not bee buried after his death: Before the noble and worthy Numantia was founded in Europe, the rich Carthage in Affricke, and the hardy Rome in Italy, the goodly Capua in Campaigne, and the great Argentine in Germanie, and the holy Helia in Paleſtine: Thebes onely was the moſt renowmed of all the World: For the Thebanes amongſt all Nations were renowned, as well for their riches, as for their buildings, and alſo becauſe in their lawes and cuſtomes they had many notable and ſeuere things, and all the men were ſeuere in their works, although they would not bee knowne by their extreame doings. Homer ſaith that the Thebanes had fiue cuſtomes, wherein they were more extreame then any other Nation.
                     1 The firſt was, that the children drawing to fiue yeeres of age, were marked in the forehead with a hot Iron, becauſe in what places ſoeuer they came they ſhould be knowne for Thebanes by the marke.
                     2 The ſecond was, that they ſhould accuſtome their children to trauaile alwayes on ſoote. And the occaſion why they did this was, becauſe the Egyptians kept their beaſts for their Gods: and therefore whenſoeuer they trauelled, they neuer rid on horſebacke, becauſe they ſhould not ſeeme to ſit vpon their god.
                     3 The third was that none of the Citizens of Thebes ſhould marry with any of ſtrāge nations, but rather cauſed thē to mary parents with parents, becauſe the friendes marrying with friends they thought the friendſhip and loue ſhould be more ſure.
                     4 The fourth cuſtome was, that no Thebane ſhould in any wiſe make a houſe for himſelfe to dwell in, but firſt By the example of the Thebanes is ſhewed the duty of euery Chriſtian. hee ſhould make his graue wherein hee ſhould bee buried.
                     
                        
                           •
                         Mee thinketh that in this point the Thebanes were not too extreame, nor exceſſiue, but that they did like ſage and wiſe men: yea and by the law of verity I ſweare, that they were ſager then wee are. For if at leaſt we did imploy our thought but two houres in the weeke to make our graue: It is vnpoſsible but that wee ſhould correct euery day our life,
                     3 The fift cuſtome was, that all the boyes which were exceeding fayre in theyr face, ſhould be by them ſtrangled in the cradell: and all the gyrles which were extreame foule, were by them killed and ſacrificed to the Gods. Saying, that the Gods forgot themſelues, when they made the men fayre, and the women foule:

For the man which is very fayre, is but an vnperfect woman: and the woman which is extreame foule, is but a ſauage and wilde beaſt.
                     The greateſt God of the Thebanes, was Iſis who was a red bull nouriſhed in the riuer of Nile, and they had a cuſtome, that all thoſe which had red haire immediate ſhould be ſacrifiſed. The contrary they did to the beaſts, for ſith their God was a Bull of tawny colour, none durſt bee ſo bold to kill any beaſts of the ſame colour. In ſuch forme and maner, that it was lawful to kill both men and women, and not the brute beaſts.
                     I doe not ſay this well done of the An in humane cuſtome among the Thebans. 
                        Thebanes to ſlay their children, nor yet I do ſay that it was well done to ſacrifiſe men and women, which had red or tawny haire, nor I thinke it a thing reaſonable, that they ſhould doe reuerence to the beaſts of that colour: but I wonder why they ſhould ſo much deſpiſe foule women and faire men, ſith all the world is peopled both with with faire and foule. Then ſith thoſe barbarous (liuing as they did vnder a falſe law) did put him to death, whom the gods had adorned with any beautie: we then which are Chriſtians by reaſon ought much leſſe to eſteeme the beauty of the body: knowing that moſt commonly thereupon enſueth the vncleanneſſe of the ſoule.
                     Vnder the Chriſtall ſtone lyeth ofttimes a dangerous worme, in the faire wall is nouriſhed the venomous Coluler, within the middle of the white tooth is ingendred great paine to the gummes, in the fineſt cloth the moths do moſt hurt, and the moſt fruitfull tree by wormes is ſooneſt periſhed. I meane, that vnder the cleane bodyes and faire countenances, are hid many and abominable vices. Truly not onely to children which are not wiſe, but to all other which are light and frayle, beutie is nothing elſe but the mother of many vices, and the hinderer of all vertues. Let Princes and great Lords beleeue me, which thinke to be fayre and well diſpoſed, that where there is great aboundance of corporall goods Beauty the mother of vices. and graces, there ought to be great bones of vertues to bee able to beare them. For the moſt high trees by great winds are ſhaken: I ſay, that it is vanity to bee vaine glorious in any thing of this world be it neuer ſo perfit: and alſo I ſay that it is a great vanitie to bee prowd, of corporall beautie. For among all the acceptable gifts that nature gaue to the mortals, there is nothing more ſuperfluous in man, and leſſe neceſſary, then the beauty of the body. For truly whether be we faire or foule, we are nothing the better beloued of God, neither thereby the more hated of men, O blindneſſe of the world! O life which neuer liueth! O death which neuer ſhall end! I know not why man through the accident of this beauty ſhould or durſt take vpon him any vaine glory or preſumption: ſith he knoweth that all the faireſt, and moſt perfiteſt of fleſh, muſt be ſacrificed to the wormes in the graue. And know alſo, that all the properneſſe of the members ſhall be forfeited to the hungrie wormes which are in the earth.
                     
                     Let the great ſcorne the little as much as they will, the fayre mocke the foule at their pleaſure, the whole diſdaine the ſicke, the well made enuy the deformed, the white hate the blacke, and the Giants deſpiſe the Dwarfes: yet in the ende all ſhall haue an ende. Truly in my opinion, the trees beare Time the conſumer of al things not the more fruit, for that they are ſtraight onely, nor for being high, neither for giuing great ſhadow, nor for being beautifull, nor yet for being great. By this compariſon I meane, that though a noble and ſtout man be proper of perſon, and noble of linage, ſhadowing of fauor, comely in countenance, in renowne very high, and in the commonwealth puiſſant, that

therefore he is not the better in this life.
                     For truely the common wealthes are not altered by the ſimple laborers which trauell in the fields: but by the vicious men which take great eaſe in their liues.

I meane, that deformed and little creatures oft times are moſt profitable in the commonwealth. For the litle and ſharpe countenances, are ſignes of valiant and ſtout hearts.
                     Let vs ceaſe to ſpeak of men which are fleſhly, being eftſoons rotten and gone, and let vs talke of ſumptuous buildings which are of ſtone, which if we ſhould goe to ſee what they were, we may know the greatneſſe and the height of them. Then wee ſhall not know the manner of their beauty: and that which ſeemed to be perpetuall, in ſhort ſpace we ſee it end, and loſe the renowme, in ſuch ſort that there is neuer memory of them hereafter.
                     Let vs all leaue the ancient buildings &amp; come to the buildings now a dayes, and none ſhall ſee that there is no man that maketh a houſe, bee it neuer ſo ſtrong nor faire, but (liuing a little while) he ſhall ſee the beautie thereof decay. For there are a great number of ancient men, which haue ſeene both the tops of famous and ſtrong buildings made, and the foundation and ground thereof decayed. And that this is true it appeareth manifeſtly, for that if the toppe decay, or the wals fall, or elſe if the timber bee weake, or the ioynts open, or the windowes waxe rotten, or the gates doe breake, the buildings forthwith decay.
                     What ſhall we ſay of goodly halls &amp; galleries well appointed, the which within ſhort ſpace, by coles or candles of children, or by torches of pages, or ſmoke of chimneys, by cobwebs of ſpiders, become as drie and foule, as before they were freſh and faire.
                     Then if that bee true which I haue ſayd of theſe things, I would now gladly know, what hope man can haue of the countenance of his beautie, ſince wee ſee the like deſtruction of corporall beauty, as of ſtones, wood, bricke and clay.
                     O vnprofitable Princes, O children too fooliſh hardy, do you not remember that all your health is ſubiect to ſicknes, as in the pain of the ſtomack, in the heate of the liuer, the inflammation of the feete, in the diſtemperance of humors, in the motions of the aire, in the coniunctions of the Moon in the Eclipſe of the Sunne: I ſay doe you not know that you are ſubiect to the tedious Summer, and vntollerable Winter? Of a truth I cannot tell how you can be (among ſo many imperfections and corruptions) ſo full of vaine glory, by your beauty, ſeeing &amp; knowing that a litle feuer doth not onely deface and man the beauty, but alſo maketh and coloureth the face all yealow, bee it neuer ſo well fauoured.
                     I haue maruelled at one thing, that is to ſay, that all men are deſirous to haue al things about their body clean their gownes bruſhed, their coates neate, their table handſome, and the bed fine, and onely they ſuffer their ſoules to be foule, ſpotted and filthy. I durſt ſay, and in the faith of a Chriſtian affirme, that it is a great lacke of wiſedome, and a ſuperfluity of folly, for a man to his haue houſe clean, &amp; to What folly it is for man not to regard his own ſoule. ſuffer his ſoule to be corrupted. I wold know what preheminence they haue which are fair, aboue others to whom nature hath denyed beautie.
                     Peraduenture the beautifull man

hath two ſoules, and the deformed creature but one? peraduenture the moſt faireſt are the moſt healthfull, and the moſt deformed are the moſt ſicklieſt: peraduènture the moſt faireſt are the wiſeſt, and the moſt deformed the moſt innocent: peraduenture the faireſt are moſt ſtout, and the deformed moſt cowards: peraduenture the faire are moſt fortunate, and the foole moſt vnluckieſt: peraduenture the faire only are accepted from vice, and the foule depriued from vertue: peraduenture thoſe which are faire, of right haue perpetuall life, and thoſe which are foule, are bound to repleniſh the graue: I ſay no certainely.
                     Then if this be true, why doe the great mocke the little, the faire the foule, the right the crooked, and the white the blacke, ſince they know that the vaine glory which they haue, and their beauty alſo, ſhall haue an end to day or tomorrow.
                     A man that is faire and well proportioned, is therefore nothing the more vertuous: and he that is deformed and euil ſhapen, is nothing therfore the more vicious: ſo that vertue dependeth not at all of the ſhape of body, neither yet vice proceedeth of the deformity of the face. For dayly wee ſee the deformity of the body to be beautified with the vertues of the The vertue of the mind beautifieth the whole body. minde: and the vertues of the minde, to be defaced with the vice of the body in his works. For truely he that in the vſage of his life hath any botch or imperfection, is worſe then he that hath foure botches in the ſhoulders.
                     Alſo I ſay, that though a man be great, yet it is not true that therefore he is ſtrong: ſo that it is not a generall rule, that the big body hath alwayes a valiāt couragious heart nor the man which is of little perſon, ſhould be of a vile and falſe heart. For we ſee by experience, the greateſt men, the moſt cowards: and the leaſt of perſonage, the moſt ſtout and hardy of heart.
                     The holy Scipture ſpeaketh of king Dauid, that he was red in his countenance, and not big of body, but of a meane ſtature, yet notwithſtanding as he and the mighty Giant Goliah were in campe, Dauid killed Goliah with a ſling, and with his owne ſword cut of his head.
                     We ought not maruaile, that a litle ſheapheard ſhould ſlay ſo valiant and mighty a Giant. For ofttimes of a litle ſpark cōmeth a great light: &amp; cōtrariwiſe by a great torcha man can ſearcely ſee to do any thing: This king Dauid did more, that hee being little of body, and tender of yeares, killed the Lyons, and recoured the lambes out of the wolues throtes: &amp; beſides this, in one day in a battle with his owne hands, he ſlue to the number of 800. men. Though wee cannot finde the like in our time, we may wel imagine, that of the 800. which he ſlew, there were at leaſt 300. of them as noble of linage as he, as rich in goods, as faire in countenance, &amp; as high of ſtature: but none of theſe had ſo much force and courage, ſince he eſcaped aliue, and they remained in the field dead. Though Iulius Caeſar was big enough of body, yet notwithſtanding he was The deformity of Iulius Caeſar. euill proportioned: For he had his head all bald, his noſe very ſharpe, one hand more ſhorter then the other. And albeit he was yong, he had his face riuelled, his colour ſomewhat yellow, and aboue all he went ſomewhat crooked, and his girdle was half vndone. For men of good wits do not imploy themſelues to the ſetting out of their bodies. Iulius Caeſar was ſo vnhandſome in his body, that after the battle of Pharſalique, a neighbour of Rome ſaid vnto the great Orator Tullius.
                     
                     Tell me Tullius, why haſt thou followd the partialities of Pompeius ſince thou art ſo wiſe, knoweſt thou not

that Iulius Caeſar ought to be Lord &amp; Monarch of al the world? Tullius anſwered. I tell thee true my friend, that I ſeeing Iulius Caeſar in his youth ſo euill and vnſeemely girded, iudged neuer to haue ſeene that, that is ſeene of him, and did neuer greatly regard him. But the old Sylla knew him better. For he ſeeing Iulius Caeſar ſo vncomly, and ſo ſlouenly apparrelled in his youth, oftentimes ſaide vnto the Senate: beware of this yong man ſo euill marked. For if you do not watch well his proceeding, it is he that ſhall hereafter deſtroy the Romaine people, as Suetonius Tranquillus affirmeth in the booke of Caeſar.
                     
                     Albeit that Iulius Caeſar was vncomlie in his behauior, yet in naming onely his name he was ſo feared through the world, as if by chance any king or Princes did talke of him at their table as after ſupper, for feare they could not ſleepe that night vntill the next day. As in Gallia Gotica where Iulius Caeſar gaue battell, by chance a French knight tooke a Caeſarian knight priſoner, who beeing led priſoner by the Frenchmen, ſaid Chaos Caeſar, which is to ſay: Let Caeſar alone. Which the Gaulloys hearing the name of Caeſar, let the priſoner eſcape, and without any other occaſion hee fell beſides his horſe.
                     Now then let Princes and great Lords ſee, how little it auaileth the valiant man to bee faire or foule, ſith that Iulius Caeſar being deformed, only with naming his name, cauſed all men to feare to change their countenance, Hanniball the aduenterous captaine of Carthage is called monſtruous not onely for his deedes he did in the world: but alſo for the euill proportion of his bodie. For of his two eyes he lacked the right, and of his two feete he had the left foote crooked, and aboue all, he was little of body, and verie fierce and cruell of countenance.
                     The deeds and conqueſts which Hanniball did among the people of Rome, Titus Liuius declareth at large: yet I will recite one thing which an The valiant deeds of Hanniball. Hiſtoriographer declareth, and it is this.
                     
                        Frontine in the book of ſtouteneſſe of the Penians declareth, that in ſeuenteene yeeres that Hannibal warred with the Romaines, he ſlue ſo great a number that if the men had bin conuerted into Kine, and that the blood which was ſhed had beene turned into Wine, it had beene ſufficient to haue filled and ſatisfied his whole armie being foure ſcore thouſand footmen, and ſeuenteene thouſand horſemen in his campe.
                     I demand now, how many were at that time fairer and more beautifull of their bodyes and countenance, then he was, whoſe beautie at this day is forgotten, whereas his valiantneſſe ſhall endure for euer.
                     For there was neuer any Prince that left of him eternall memorie, only for being beautiful of countenance: but for enterpriſing great things with the ſword in the hand.
                     The great Alexander was no fairer nor better ſhapen then another man. For the Chronicles declare of him, The deſcription of Alexander. that he had a litle throte, a great head a blacke face, his eyes ſomewhat troubled, the body little, and the members not well proportioned, and with all his deformitie hee deſtroyed Darius, king of the Perſes and Medes, and he ſubdued all the tyrants: he made him ſelfe Lord of all the Caſtles, and took many kings, and diſherited and ſlue mightie Lords of great eſtate, hee ſearched all their riches, and pilled all their treaſors, and aboue all things all the earth trembled before him, not hauing the audacitie to ſpeake one word againſt him.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Of a letter the Emperour Marcus Aurelius wrote to his Nephew, worthie to be noted of all yong Gentlemen. CHAP. XLII.
                     
                        
                           SExtus Cheronenſis, in his ſecond booke of the life of Marcus Aurelius declared, that this good Marcus Aurelius had a ſiſter called Annia Melena, the which had a ſonne named Epeſipus, who was not onely nephew, but alſo Diſciple to Marcus Aurelius. And after he was created Emperour, he ſent his nephew into Greece to ſtudy the Greeke tongue, and to baniſh him from the vices of Rome.
                     
                     This yong Epeſipus was of a good and cleare iudgement, well made of his body, and faire of countenance: and ſith in his youth he eſteemed his beauty more then his learning, the Emperour his vncle wrote him a letter The letter of Marcus Aurelius. in Greeke, which ſayd thus.
                     
                        Marcus Aurelius the Romaine Emperour, firſt Tribune of the people, and Biſhop, wiſheth to thee Epeſipus his Nephew and Scholler, health and doctrine.
                     In the third Calends of December came thy couſin Annius Verus, at whoſe comming all our parentage reioyced, and ſo much the more becauſe that hee brought vs newes out of Grecia,
                     
                     For truely when the heart hath the abſence of that he loueth, it is no minute of an houre without ſuſpition. After that thy couſen Annius Verus had ſpoken in generally to all, bringing newes from their friends and children, we talked together, and he gaue me a letter of thine, which is contrary to that which was written mee out of Greece, becauſe thou writeſt to mee, that I ſhould ſend thee mony to continue thee in ſtudie, and they did alſo write vnto me from thence, that thou art more youthfull, and giuen more to the pleaſures of the world, then becommeth thee.
                     Thou art my blood, thou art my Nephew, thou wert my Scholler, and thou ſhalt bee my ſonne if thou art good. But God wil neuer that thou be my Nephew, nor that I ſhall call thee my ſonne, during the time that thou ſhalt be yong, fond, light and frayle For no good man ſhould haue parentage with the vitious.
                     I cannot deny but that I loue thee from the bottome of my ſtomacke, and ſo likewikewiſe thy vnthriftineſſe greeueth me with all my heart. For when I read the letters of thy follies. I will content my ſelfe.
                     For the ſage wiſe men, though (againſt their willes) they heare of ſuch things paſt, yet it pleaſeth them to redreſſe other things that may come heareafter.
                     I know well that thou canſt not call it to minde, though perhaps thou haſt it, that when thy vnlucky mother and my ſiſter Annia Melena died, ſhe was then yong enough, for ſhe was no more but eighteene yeares of age, and thou haddeſt not then foure houres.
                     For thou wert borne in the morning, and ſhee dyed iuſt at noonetide: ſo when the wicked childe poſſeſſed his life. then the good mother taſted death.
                     I can tell thee that thou haſt loſt ſuch a mother, and that I haue loſt ſuch a ſiſter, that I beleeue there was no better in Rome.
                     
                     
                        
For ſhe was ſage, honeſt, and faire, the which things are ſeldome ſeene now a dayes. For ſo much as thy mother was my ſiſter, and that I had brought her vp and marryed her, I read then Rethorike at Rhodes, becauſe my pouertie was extreame, that I had no other thing but that which by reading Rethorike I did get.
                     When newes came vnto me of the death of thy mother, and my ſiſter Annia Milena, al comfort laid on ſide ſorrow oppreſſed my heart in ſuch wiſe, that all members trembled, the bones ſhiuered, my eyes without reſt did lament, the heauy ſighes ouercame me, at euery minute my heart vaniſhed away, from the bottome of my heart I inwardly lamented, and bewayled thy vertuous mother and my deare ſiſter.
                     Finally ſorrow executing his priuiledge on mee, the ioyfull company greeued me, and onely with the louely care I quieted my ſelfe, I know not nor cannot expreſſe vnto thee how, and in what ſort I tooke the death of my ſiſter Annia Milena thy mother: for in ſleeping I dreamed of her, and dreaming I ſaw her, when I was awake ſhee repreſented her ſelfe before me, remembring that ſhe liued, I was ſorry to remember her death. Life was ſo grieuous vnto me, that I would haue reioyced to haue beene put in the graue with her. For truly hee feeleth aſſuredly the death of another, which alway is ſorrowfull, and lamenting his owne life.
                     Remembring therefore the great loue which my ſiſter Milena bare vnto me in her life, and thinking wherein I might requite the ſame after her death: I imagined that I could not by any meanes doe any thing that was more acceptable for her, then to bring thee vp, thou which art her childe, and left an Orphane ſo yong.
                     For of all trauells to a woman, this is the chiefeſt: to leaue behinde her children to bring vp. My ſiſter being dead, the firſt thing I did was, that I came to Rome, and then ſent thee to Capua to be brought vp there, in the which place, hard at my noſe, they gaue thee ſucke two yeares.
                     For thou knoweſt right well, that the mony which by reading Rethorike I gate, ſcarcely ſatisfied for thy dayly feeding: but that in the night I reade ſome extraordinare lecture, and with that I payed for the milke, which thou ſuckedſt on the dugge, ſo that thy bringing vp depended vpon the labour of my life.
                     After that thou wert weined and and brought from the teate, I ſent thee to Bietro, to a friend and kinſman of mine named Lucius Valerius, with whom thou remainedſt vntill fiue yeares were fully accompliſhed, where I found both him and thee all things neceſſary. For he was in great pouertie, and a great blabber of his tongue, in ſuch ſort that he troubled What offence comes by much talke. all men, and angred me much. For truely a man ſhould as willingly giue mony to cauſe him to be ſilent, which is talkatiue: as to giue a wiſe man to heare him to ſpeake.
                     The fiue yeares accompliſhed, I ſent thee to Toringue, a citie of Campaignia, to a Maiſter which taught children there, called Emilius Torquates, of whom, to the end hee ſhould teach thee to reade and to write three yeares: I tooke a ſonne of his, whom hee gaue mee to reade to him Greeke foure yeares, ſo that thou couldeſt not haue any profite in thee, without the increaſe of great trauell, and augmenting paine to my heart.
                     And after thou wert ſeuen yeares old, that thou couldeſt reade and write wel, I ſent thee to ſtudy, in the famous city of Tareth where I kept thee

foure yeares paying to the maſters a great ſumme of money: Becauſe now a dayes through our euill fortunes, there is none that will teach without great ſtipend. Without lamenting I doe not tell thee, that in the time that Cincinos (which were after the death of Quintus Cincinatus, vntill Cyna and Catulus) the phyloſopher and maiſters were by the ſacred Senate payde, and none ceaſed to ſtudy for lacke of money.
                     For in thoſe dayes they which would apply themſelues to vertue and ſciences, were by the common treaſure maintained. As our fathers were Learning well regarin ancient times. well ordered in their things: ſo they did not deuide offices by order onely but alſo by order they payed their money in ſuch ſort that they paide firſt with the common treaſure, the prieſts of the Temples, Secondly, the maiſters of ſchooles and ſtudies. Thirdly, the poore widowes and Orphanes. Fourthly, the ſtrange knights, which of their owne free wills voluntarily were made citizens of Rome. Fiftly, all the old ſouldiesr, which had ſerued 35. yeares continually in the warres. For thoſe which were retired home to their owne houſes, were honourably found of the commonwealth,
                     The twelue yeares paſt I my ſelfe was in Tarenthe, and carryed thee to Rome, where I read vnto thee Rhetorike, Logike and phyloſophy, and alſo the Mathematicall ſciences, keeping thee in my houſe, in my company, at my table, and in my bed, and further more I had the in my heart, and in my minde. The which thing thou ſhouldeſt eſteeme more, then if I gaue thee my houſe and al my goods. For the true benefites is that onely which is done without any reſpect of profite or intereſt,
                     I kept thee with meanes in this ſort in Laurence, in Rhodes, in Naples, and in Capua, vntill ſuch time as the gods created me Emperor of Rome. And then I determined to ſend thee to Greece, becauſe thou ſhouldeſt learne the Greeke tongue, and alſo to the end thou ſhouldeſt accuſtome thy ſelfe to worke that which true phyloſophy requireth. For the true and vertuous phyloſophers ought to conforme their workes to that they ſay, and publiſh their words with their deeds.
                     There is nothing more infamous then to preſume to be ſage, and to be deſirous to be counted vertuous: principally for him that ſpeaketh much, and worketh little. For the man of a pleaſant tongue, and euill life, is hee which with impoſtumes vndoeth the commonwealth. When I ſent thee to An euill man a wicked member in a commonwealth. 
                        Greece, and withdrew thee from Rome, it was not to exile thee out of my company, ſo that thou hauing taſted of my pouertie; ſhouldeſt not reioyce at my proſperitie: but it was that conſidering thy youthfull diſpoſition and lightneſſe, I was afrayde to vndoe thee in the pallace, chiefely leaſt thou wouldeſt haue preſumed to haue bin too bold and familiar, becauſe thou wert my nephew. For truely Princes which take pleaſure that their children be familiar with them, they giue occaſion that men ſhall not count them wiſe, and cauſe alſo the young men to bee eſteemed for light, I haue tolde thee that I did for thee in Italie.
                     
                     I will now let thee know what thou haſt done, and doeſt in Greece, ſo that I will ſhew thee to bee notorious, that is to know that thou taking and eſteeming thy ſelfe to bee well diſpoſed in thy youth, thou haſt forſaken thy ſtudy, and deſpiſed my counſayles, thou art accompanyed with vaine and light men, and haſt moſt viciouſly employed the money which

I had ſent thee to buy books. All the which things to thee being hurtfull, are to me no leſſe diſhonor &amp; ſhame.
                     For it is a generall rule, when the childe is fooliſh and ill taught, and How children ſhould be brought the blame and fault is layd on the maſters necke, who hath taught him, and brought him vp. It greeueth me not for that he brought thee vp, neither for that I haue taught thee to reade, and cauſe thee to ſtudy, neither likewiſe to haue kept thee in my houſe, to haue ſet thee at my table, nor alſo to haue ſuffered thee to lie with me in my bed, neither it greeueth mee to haue conſumed ſo much on thee: but with all my heart it greeueth me, that thou haſt not giuen me occaſion to do thee good. For there is nothing that greeueth a noble Prince more, then not to find perſons able of capacity, to do them any good. They tell me that thou art well made of thy body, and faire in countenance, and that thou preſumeſt alſo in thoſe things: wherefore to enioy the pleaſures of thy perſon, thou haſt forſaken Phyloſophy, wherewith I am not contentented. For in the end the corporall beautie, carely or ſate, periſheth in the graue: but vertue &amp; ſcience, makes men to be of immortall memory. The gods neuer commanded it, neither the ſtudies and vniuerſities of Italy ſuffered it, to haue the body fine and trimme, the viſage faire and cleare, and the heart full of Phyloſophy: for the true Phyloſopher, of all other things eſteemeth leaſt the ſetting forth of the body. For that the demonſtrations and tokens of a true &amp; perfect phyloſopher is to haue his eres troubled, his eye bries burnt, and the head bald, the ball of his eyes ſunke into his head, the face yellow, the body leane and feeble, the fleſh dry, the ſo

                        te vnhoſed, the garment poore, the eating little, and the watching great. Finally he ought to liue as a Lacedemonian, and ſpeake as a Grecian. The tokens of a valiant &amp; renowmed captain, are his wounds and hurts, and the ſigne of a ſtudious phyloſopher, is the deſpiſing of the world. For the wiſe man ought to thinke himſelfe as much diſhonored, if they call him ſtout, and ſturdie: as a captaine when they call him a coward and negligent. I like well that the phyloſopher ſtudy the ancient antiquities of his forefathers, that wrote the profound things for the time to come, that hee teach profitable &amp; wholeſome doctrines to thoſe which are now aliue, that he diligently enquire of the motion of the ſtarres, that he conſider what cauſeth the alteration of the elements. But I ſweare vnto thee Epeſipus, that neuer ſage of Rome came to thoſe things, nor phyloſopher of Greece likewiſe, but in ſearching the quietneſſe of the ſoule, &amp; deſpiſing the pleaſures of the body: Touching the body I am like to beaſts, but concerning the ſpirit I am partly like to the gods, ſith that following the things of the fleſh I am made leſſe then my ſelf, and in following the motions of the ſpirit, I am made more then I am. For truly ſenſualitie maketh vs inferiour to beaſts, and reaſon maketh vs ſuperiour vnto men. The worldly malice &amp; preſumption naturally deſireth, rather to mount then to deſcend: and to command, rather then to be commanded. And ſince it is ſo, why do we by vices abaſe our ſelues to do leſſe then beaſts being poſſible for vs by vertues to do more then men. Amongſt all the members, which men can haue, there is nothing more tender to breake, nor any thing more eaſy to corrupt, then is the handſomnes of the body, where we are ſo proud. For in mine opinion, to eſteeme himſelfe to be a handſome and proper perſon, is no other thing, but to eſteeme our ſelues that dreaming we ſhal be rich and mighty, and

afterwards awaking we find our ſelues to be poore and miſerable. And me thinkes th

But what ſhall wee ſay, that when we do not watch, this litle floure which yeſterday floriſhed on the tree, faire and whole, without ſuſpition to be loſt, one little hoary froſt ſodainly waſteth and conſumeth it, the vehement wind ouerthrows it, the knife of enuy cutteth it, the water of aduerſitie vndoeth it, and the heate of perſecutions pineth it: and finally the worme of ſhort life gnaweth it, and the putrifaction of death decayeth and bringeth it down to the ground. O mans life that art alwayes curſed, I count fortune cruell, and thee vnhappy, ſince ſhe will that thou tarrieſt on her, which dreaming giueth thee pleaſures, and waking worketh the diſpleaſures: which giueth into thy hands trauell to taſt, and ſuffereth thee not onely to liſten after quier: which will thou proue aduerſitie, and agree that thou haue proſperitie but at her will: finally ſhe giueth ther life by ounces, and death without meaſure.
                     The wicked and vitious ſay, that it is a great pleaſure to liue in eaſe: but I proteſt vnto them, that there was neuer any mortall man had ſo much pleaſure in vices, but that he remained in great paine after that they were baniſhed from him.
                     For the heart, which of long time The of the wicked. hath bene rooted in vice, incontinently is ſubiect to ſome great alteration, I would all would open their eyes to ſee how wee liue deceiued: for all the pleaſures which delight the body, make vs beleeue that they come to abide with vs continually, but they vaniſh away with ſorrows immediatly. And on the contrary part the infirmities and ſorrowes that blind the ſoule ſay, that they come onely to lodge as gueſts, and ramaine with vs continually as houſholders.
                     I maruell of thee Epeſipus, why thou doeſt not conſider what ſhall becom of the beauty of thy body hereafter, ſith thou leeſt preſently the beauty of thoſe departed interred in the graue? By the diuerſitie of fruits man doth know the diuerſitie of trees in the Orchyard, that is to ſay, the Oake by the Acornes, the Date tree by the Dates, and the Vines by the Grapes: but when the roote is dry, the body cut, the fruit gathered, the leafe fallen and when the tree is layd on fire and become aſhes, I would now know if this aſhes could bee knowne of what tree it was, or how a man might know the difference of the one frō the other? By this cōpariſon I meane to ſay that for ſo much as the life of this death &amp; the death of this life commeth to ſeeke vs out, wee are all as trees in the Orchard, whereby ſome are knowne by the rootes of their predeceſſors, others by the leaues of their wordes, others by the branches of their friendes, ſome in the flowers of their beauty, and other ſome by the barke of their foule skinne. The one

in their mercifulneſſe, the other in their ſtouteneſſe, other in their hardineſſe beeing aged, others in their haſtineſſe of their youth, others in their barrenneſſe by theyr pouerty, others by their fruitfulneſſe in riches. Finally, in one onely thing wee are all alike, that is to ſay, that all vniuerſally goe to the graue, not one remayning.
                     I aske now when death hath done his office, executing all earthly men The office of death. in the later dayes: what difference is there then betweene the fayre and the foule, which lye both in the narrow graue? certainely, there is none, and if there bee any difference, it ſhall bee in the making of their graues, which vaine men inuented. And I doe not repent mee for calling them vayne, ſince there is no vanity nor fondnes comparable to this, for they are, not contented to bee vaine in their liues but will alſo after their drathes enterpriſe their vanities in ſumptuous and ſtately ſepulchres.
                     The coale of the Cedar (in mine opinion) that is high and fayre, is nothing more whether when it is burnt, then the coale of the oake which is little and crooked: I meane oftentimes the Gods doe permit, that the bones of a poore Philoſopher are more honoured then the bones of Princes.
                     With death I wil threaten thee no longer, for ſith thou art giuen to the vices of this life, thou wouldeſt not as yet that with a word it ſhould deſtroy thee: but I will tell thee on

                     If a man would aske me what death is? I would ſay a miſerable lake wherein all worldly men are taken: for thoſe that moſt ſafely thinke to paſſe it ouer, remaine therein moſt ſubtilly deceyned. I haue alwayes read of the What death is. Ancients paſt, and haue ſeene of the young men preſent, and I ſuppoſe, that the ſelfe ſame will bee to come hereafter: that when life moſt ſweeteſt ſeemeth to any man, then ſuddenly, death entereth in at their dores.
                     O immortall Gods, I cannot tell if I may call you cruell, I know not if I may call you mercifull, becauſe you gaue vs fleſh, bones, honour, goods, friends, and alſo you giue vs pleaſure; finally yee giue to men all that they want, ſaue onely, the cuppe of life, which to your ſelues you did reſerue.

If you thinke to become aged, yee ought to remember, and alwayes to thinke, that the ſteele of the knife, which doth much ſeruice, at length decayeth, and is loſt for lacke of looking to.
                     Truely the young man is but a new knife, the which in proceſſe of time cankereth in the edge: For on one day hee breaketh the poynt of vnderſtanding, another, he looſeth the edge of cutting, and to morrow the ruſt of diſeaſes taketh him, and afterwards by aduerſitie he is writhen, and by infirmities hee is diſeaſed, by riches hee is whetted, by pouertie hee is dulled againe: and finally, oftentimes it chanceth that the more ſharpe he is whetted, ſo much the more the life is put in hazard.
                     It is a true thing, that the feete and hands are neceſſarie to climbe to the vanities of youth: and that afterwards ſtumbling a little, immediately rowling the head downewards, wee diſcend into the miſery of age: For (to our ſeeming) yeſterday wee knew one that was young and beautifull, and within ſhort time after, wee heare that he is dead and rotten.
                     When I conſider many men as well friends as enemies, which were (not long agoe) flouriſhing in beauty and youth' and preſently I ſee them to bee old and drie, ſicke and foule, truely I thinke that as then I dreamed of them, or that they be not now as they were then.
                     What thing is more fearefull, or more credible, then to ſee a man become miſerable in ſhort ſpace, that the faſhion of his viſage ſhould change, the beauty of the face ſhould bee loſt, the beard waxe white, the head bould, the cheekes and forehead full of wrinckles, the teeth (as white as Iuorie) become blacke, the light feete by the goute to ſeeme crepeled, and and afterward waxeth heauy, the palſey weakenneth the ſtrong arme, the fine ſmoth throat with wrinckles is playted, &amp; the body that was ſtraight and vpright, waxeth weake and crooked.
                     Aboue all that I haue ſpoken, I ſay to thee Epeſipus, which preſumeſt to bee fayre, that hee which through his properneſſe in youth was the mirrour of all, becommeth to bee ſuch a one, that he doubteth whether he be the ſelfe ſame now in his age (that he was in his youth, Doe what thou wilt, praiſe and glorifie thy beautie as much as thou thinkeſt good, yet in the end the beauty of men is none other: but as a vayle to couer their eyes, a payre of fetters for the feete, manacles for the hands, a lime rodde for the winges, a theefe of time, an occaſion of daunger, a prouoker of trouble, a place of lecherie, a ſinke of all euill, and finally, it is an inuentor of debates, and a ſcourge of the affectioned man.

                     CHAP. XLIII. How Princes and great Lords in olde time were louers of wiſe men.
                     
                     
                        ONe of the chiefeſt things that wan reputation and eternall memory to the The counſell of wiſe men euer reſpected among the Ancients. ancient Princes and Gouernours, was that they ſought wiſe men to bee alwayes conuerſant about them, whoſe graue counſell their Realmes alwayes obſerued and obeyed. It profiteth a King little to leade with him a great number of Sages to gouerne him and his Realme: if his Subiectes are armed: with malice not to obey him. Let Princes know, which eſteeme not the counſell of Sages, that their commaundement of other ſhall not bee regarded: for the Law which by will is made, and not of right ordayned, deſerueth not to be obeyed.
                     Wee which turne and toſſe the leaues of the auncient Hiſtories cannot deny, but that the Romaines naturally were proud. Yet wee muſt confeſſe, that as they haue beene ſtout in things touching warres; ſo they haue ſhewed themſelues temperate, in the affayres of the publike weale. And truly herein Rome declared her wiſdome, and might, for as by hardy and ſtout Captaines the enemies were deſtroyed in warre: ſo by Sage and Wiſe men the common wealth was gouerned and maintained in peace.
                     Oft times with my ſelfe I muſe, whereupon all theſe diſcords grew betweene Lords and ſubiects Princes and vaſſels, and my count beeing

made, I finde that they haue both reaſon: for the ſubiects complaine of the little loue of their Lord: and the Lords complaine of the great diſobedience of their ſubiects: for to ſay the truth, diſobedience is ſo much augmented, &amp; the deſire of commandement is become ſo licentious, that it ſeemeth to the Subiects, that the weight of a feather is leade: and on the contrary, it ſeemeth to Princes, that for the flying of a flie, they ſhuld draw their ſwords.
                     All this euill and damage commeth not, but becauſe that Princes haue not with them wiſe men which may counſell them: for there was neuer any good Prince that credited euill counſell.
                     There are two things in Princes and Prelates which gouern the ſoule: the one is the dignity of the office, and the other is the nature of the perſon. What is required of euery Magiſtrate. It may well be that one may bee good in his perſon, and euill in his gouernment: and the contrary, hee may bee euill of his perſon, and good in gouernment. And therefore Tullius Cicero ſaith, that there neuer was, nor ſhall be, ſuch a Iulius Caeſar in his perſon, nor ſo euill a Gouernour as hee was for the Common-wealth. It is a great grace in a man to be good; but it is much more that hee bee a good Prince. And for the contrary, it is a great euill for a man to be euill; but it is much worſe for him to be an euill Prince. For the euill man is onely euill to himſelfe, but the euill Prince endamageth all others: for the more the poyſon is ſcattered through the bodie, in ſo much more danger he is of his life. I meane, the more power a man hath ouer the Common-wealth: ſo much the more euill and dammage hee doth if his life bee euill, I maruel why Princes &amp; great Lords ſhould bee ſo curious to ſearch the beſt medicines to cure their bodies: and that they are ſo ſlacke and ſlow in ſeeking ſage perſons to gouerne their Common wealth. For without compariſon, it is greater damage that the Common wealth bee euill gouerned, then if the Prince and Gouernour thereof ſhould be ſicke in his perſon. Hetherto wee haue neither read nor ſeene that any Prince hath periſhed for lacke of phyſicke, but for lacke of Counſellours: Wee haue ſeene and reade of infinite Kings and Realmes that haue beene deſtroyed, and vtterly vndone.
                     The lacke of a Phyſitian may cauſe danger in mans perſon: but the lacke What hurt commeth by euill Counſellors of a wiſe man may ſet diſcord among the people: for where there is any tumult amongſt the people, a ripe counſell of a

                         Wiſe man profiteth more, then a hundred purgations of rubarbe.
                     
                        Iſidorus in the fourth book of his Etimologies affirmeth, that the Romans were foure hundred yeares without Phyſitions: For Eſculapius the ſonne of Apollo was the laſt Phyſition in Greece. And in the Temple of the ſame Eſculapius, they ſet by the Image of Archabuto, a man very notable in Surgery: For the Romanes were ſo beneficiall to vertuous perſons, that to euery one that exceeded other in any kind of vertue, they rewarded him with money, they ſet vp a Statue of him for memory, or elſe they made him free in the common wealth. And then when the Surgian Archabuto was become auncient and very rich, and when by occaſion of great and daungerous wounds hee did cut off the armes and legges of certaine Romans, thought him a cruell and an vnnaturall man: Wherefore they droue him out of his houſe, and killed him with ſtones in the field of Mars.
                     
                     And let no man man maruell therat, for oftentimes mē ſuffer leſſe harm in enduring the paine, then to tarry

for the cruell remedies the Surgians apply vnto it.
                     Some will ſay, that when Rome was without Surgeans, the Romanes were diſcomfited and halfe loſt. To this I will anſwere, that they neuer had a more proſperous time, then in the foure hundred yeares when they were without Surgeans: for then was Rome vndone, when they receyued Surgeans, for at that time they droue Philoſophers out of Rome. I doe not ſpeake this as a preiudice to any Surgean: for mee thinketh that Princes cannot be without ſom among them: For as the fleſh is ſeeble and delicate, ſo dayly needeth it remedies to comfort it. The ſage Surgeons giueth vs none but good and healthfull counſels: for they doe not perſwade vs to any other thing, but that wee bee ſober and continent in eating, drinking, ſleeping, trauelling, and working, and that in all things we ſhould be temperate.
                     The end why I ſpeake theſe things is, to perſwade princes, prelates, and great Lords, that the great diligence they haue to ſeeke Surgeans, and the ſumme of mony they waſte to maintaine and content them, they ſhould ſpend part of that to ſeeke wiſe men to counſell their perſons: for if men knew what it were to keepe a wiſe What benefite proceedeth frō good Councellors man, to commaund in their houſe, they would giue for one onely wiſe man all their goods: yee ought for to haue pitty and compaſſion vpon thoſe princes and great Lords, which loſe ſo many dayes in the moneth, and ſo many houres in the day, in ſpeaking of warres, buildings, weapons, meats, beaſts, of huntings and medicines, &amp; oftentimes of other mens doings, and of other vain things, not neceſſary for mans life. And this communication they vſe with thoſe that are neither vertuous nor wiſe: the which can neyther wiſely talke, nor yet anſwere directly vnto that which is asked. Oftentimes it chanceth that a prince at randon moueth a matter, which they neuer ſaw written before, nor with their eares they neuer heard the like, neyther in all their life time they had knowledge thereof, and yet they wil ſeeme to giue iudgement of it (or better to ſay) obſtinately to contend, as if all the dayes of their life they had ſtudied it: which thing proceedeth of great ſhame, and euill bringing vp: For the priuie Councell may ſpeake before their princes, but be they neuer ſo priuie, with licence or without licence it is not lawfull for them to contend. Helius Spartianus in the life of Alexander Seuerus ſayeth, that the Emperour Seuerus was demaunded onceby an Ambaſſadour of Greece, What thing was moſt painefull to him in Rome? whereunto the Emperour anſwered, There is nothing grieueth mee more, then when I am merry, that my ſeruants ſhould raiſe any ſtrife or debate: I am not diſpleaſed that matters ſhould be debated, but this grieueth mee, when one will obſtinatly ſtriue, that hath no ground of that hee ſpeaketh, hee cannot otherwiſe but be called obſtinate.
                     
                     
                        Theodoſius the Emperour was once demanded What a Prince ought to doe to be good? wherunto he anſwered, The vertuous Prince when he goeth abroade, ought to haue graue and wiſe men in his company to diſcourſe withall, when he is at his meat, to haue wiſe men at his board diſputing, and when he withdraweth him ſelfe a part to be reading with wiſe men: and finally at all vacant times he ought to bee found with ſage men counſelling: for the Knight which entreth into battell without weapōs, is as hardy as the prince which will gouerne the common wealth without the counſell of wiſe men.
                     
                     
                        Lampridius in the booke of the Roman geſts ſayth, that the Emperor Marcus Aurelius neyther at his meat, at his going to bedde, at his vpriſing,

in his trauell openly, nor ſecretly, ſuffered at any time that fooles ſhould ſing or communicate with him, but onely wiſe and vertuous men, whom alwayes he moſt entirely loued.
                     Of truth hee had reaſon, for there is nothing, be it in ieſt or in earneſt, but it is better liked of a wiſe man thē of a foole, If a Prince bee ſad, cannot a wiſe man peraduentur by the ſaying of the holy Scripture counſell him better, then a foole by fooliſh words? If a Prince be proſperous, ſhall it not bee better (to keepe him in the ſame property) to aſſociate himſelfe with a wiſe man, rather then to put his truſt in a foole and malitious perſon? If a Prince be deſtitute of money, cannot perchance a wiſe man finde him better meanes to get it, then a foole which doth nothing but aske? If a Prince will paſſe the time away, ſhall not hee bee more comforted with a wiſe man that reckoneth vnto him the ſauoury hiſtories done in times paſt, then hearkning a foole ſpeake fooliſhly, and declaring things diſhoneſtly, with the ſayings of the malitious of the time preſent? That that I ſpeake of Surgians, the ſelfe ſame I ſpeake of fooles: For I doe not ſay that they keepe them for their paſtime, though truely wee might better ſay to loſe their time, then to paſſe their time: for that may iuſtly bee called time loſt, which is ſpent without Time beſt ſpent in the ſeruice of God. the ſeruice of God, and profit of their neighbours.
                     That which I moſt maruell at is, not ſo much for the great authoritie that fooles haue in the Pallaces of Princes and great Lords, as for the little ſuccour and credite which wiſe men haue among them: For it is a great iniurie that fooles ſhould enter into the pallace of princes, euen vnto their beds ſide, and that one wiſe man may not, nor dare not enter into the hall: So that to the one there is no dore ſhut, and to the other, there is no gate open.
                     Wee which are at this preſent, of right doe commend thoſe that were before vs, for no other cauſe, but that in times paſt, though the Sages were few in number, and the world was repleniſhed with barbarous people: yet the Sages of thoſe barbarous people were greatly eſteemed, and had in reuerence.
                     And this cuſtome endured long time in Greece, that when a Philoſopher paſſed by a Greeke, hee roſe and ſpake vnto him: and hee might not ſit: for the contrary, all thoſe which ſhall liue hereafter will reprooue vs, which are at this preſent. Foraſmuch as wee haue ſo great a multitude of Sages, and do not liue amongſt barbarous, but amongſt Chriſtians: and it is a griefe to ſee, and ſhame to write how little wiſe men are eſteemed: for at this day (through our offences) not thoſe which haue moſt ſcience: but thoſe which haue moſt riches, in the common wealth do commaund: I know not whether the diuine wiſedome hath depriued them, or that the worldly malice hath loſt the taſte of them. For now a dayes there is no ſage that liueth al alone to be wiſe, but it is neceſſary for him to trauell how to gaine his liuing: for neceſſity enforceth him to violate the rules of true Philoſophy.
                     O world, world, I know not how to eſcape thy hands, nor how the ſimple man and ideot defendeth himſelfe How little wiſedome now a dayes is regarded. out of thy ſnares, when the Sage and wiſe men (yea with al their wiſedom) can ſcarſely ſet their foot ſure on the ground. For all that Wiſe men of this World know, is little enough to defend them from the malitious.
                     Reading that which I read of time paſt, and ſeeing that which I ſee of time preſent: I am in doubt which was greater, the care that vertuous

Princes had in ſeeking out Sages to counſell them, or the great couetouſneſſe that others haue at this preſent, to diſcouer mines and treaſures.
                     Speaking therefore in this matter, as I thinke: I deſire that thoſe which haue the charge of gouernment
                           •
                         (whether hee bee Prince, Prelate, or priuate perſon I paſſe not) that they once may haue about them ſage men, that bee wiſe in deede, and that they would loue them aboue all the treaſure they had heaped. For in the end, of good counſell there commeth profite: and much treaſure, is a token of great danger.
                     In the olde time when vertuous Princes dyed, and that they left their children for Succeſſors in their Realmes, and beſides that, foraſmuch as they ſaw their children young, and euill inſtructed in the affayres of their Realmes, they committed them to Tutours, that ſhould teach them good works and doctrine, rather then they would giue them Suruayors, which ſhould encreaſe and augment their Cofers and Rents: For truely if the Common-wealth bee defended with great treaſures, it is not gouerned with good counſels.
                     The princes which are young, accuſtomely are giuen to vices: for in the one part youth raigneth, and on the other part honeſty wanteth.
                     And to ſuch, truely vices are very dangerous, ſpecially if they want Sages to counſel them, to keepe them Youth ſubiect to many vices. from euill company. For the couragious youth will not bee brideled, nor their greate liberty can bee chaſtiſed.
                     Princes without doubt haue more neede of wiſe and ſtayed men about them, to profite them in theyr counſelles, then any of all their other Subiects: for ſince they are in the view of all, they haue leſſe licence to commit vice then any of all: For if you behold all, and that they haue authority to iudge all, will they, nill they, they are beholden and iudged of all.
                     Princes ought to be circumſpect whom they truſt with the gouernement of their Realmes, and to whom they commit the leading of their Armies, whom they ſend as Ambaſſadours into ſtrange Countries, and whom they truſt to receyue and keepe their treaſures: but much more they ought to bee circumſpect in examining of thoſe whom they chooſe to bee their Counſellours: For looke what is he that counſelleth the prince How circumſpect Princes ought to be at home in his pallace: ſo likewiſe ſhall his renowne be in ſtrange countries, and in his owne Common-wealth.
                     Why ſhould they not then willingly examine and correct theyr owne proper palace? Let Princes know, if they do not know, that of the honeſty of their ſeruants, of the prouidence of their Counſels, of the ſageneſſe of their perſons, and of the order of their houſe, dependeth the welfare of the Common-wealth: for it is impoſſible that the branches of that tree, whoſe rootes are dryed vp, ſhould bee ſeene to beare greene leaues.

                           •
                        0. yeares olde, and hauing gouerned the empire 11. years lying on his death bed, called Archadius and Honorius his two ſons, and committed them to Eſtilconius, and Ruff

                           nus to be inſtructed, and ordayned them likewiſe for gouernours of their eſtates and ſigniories. Before that the father dyed, hee had now created his children Caeſars, being then of the age of 17. yeares. Therefore the Father ſeeing them not as yet ripe, nor able to gouerne their Realms and Signiories: he committed them vnto maſters and tutors. It is not alwayes a generall rule, though one be of 25. yeares of age, that he hath more diſcretion to gouerne realms then another of fifteene: for dayly wee ſee, that wee allow and commend the ten yeeres of one, and reproue the forty yeares of an other.
                     There are many Princes tender of yeares, but ripe in counſels: and for the contrary there are other Princes olde in yeares, and young in counſels. When the good Emperour Veſpatian dyed, they determined to put his ſonne Titus in the gouernement of the Empire, or ſome other aged Senatour, becauſe they ſayde Titus was too young,
                     And as they were in controuerſie of the matter, the Senator Rogerus Patroclus ſaid vnto the Senate: For my part I require rather a Prince which is young and ſage: then I do a Prince which is olde and fooliſh.
                     Therefore now as touching the children of Theodoſius, one day Eſtiltorius the tutor of Archadius ſpeaking to a Greeke Philoſopher, very ſage, whoſe name was Epimundus, ſayd thus vnto him.
                     Thou and I long time haue beene acquainted together in the Palace of the Emperour Theodoſe my Lord, who is dead, and we are aliue: thou knoweſt it had been better that we two had dyed, and that he had liued: for there bee many to bee ſeruants of Princes, but there are few to be good Princes I feele no greater griefe in this world, then to know many Princes in one Realme. For the man which hath ſeene many Princes in his life, hath ſeene many nouelties and alterations in the common wealth. Thou knoweſt well that when Theodoſius my maſter dyed, hee ſpake to mee theſe words, the which were not ſpoken without great ſighes and multiplying of teares. O Eſtilconus, I dye, and am going into an other world, wherin I ſhall giue a ſtreight account of the Realmes and Seignories which I had vnder my charge: and therefore The duety of euery good Chriſtian. when I thinke of mine offences I am maruellouſly afrayde: But when I remember the mercy of God, then I receyue ſome comfort and hope.
                     As it is but meet wee ſhould truſt in the greatneſſe of his mercy: ſo likewiſe is it reaſon wee ſhould feare the rigour of his iuſtice. For truely, in the chriſtian law they are not ſuffered to liue (as we which are Princes that liue in delights of this world, &amp; without repentance to goe to Paradiſe: Then when I thinke of the great

benefites which I haue receyued of God, and of the great offences which I haue committed, and when I thinke of the long time I haue liued, and of the little which I haue profited, and alſo that vnprofitably I haue ſpent my time: On the one part I am loath to dye, for that I am afrayde to come before the tribunall ſeate of Ieſus Chriſt: and on the other part I would liue no longer, becauſe I doe not profite.
                     The man of an euill life, why doth hee deſire to liue any longer? My life is now finiſhed, and the time is ſhort to make amends. And ſith God demaundeth nought elſe but a contrite heart, with all my heart I doe repent, and appeale to his iuſtice, of mercy, from his iuſtice to his mercy, becauſe it may pleaſe him to receyue mee into his houſe, and to giue mee perpetuall glory, to the confuſion of all my finnes and offences. And I proteſt I dye in the holy catholike faith, and commend my ſoule to God and my body to the earth: and to you, Eſtilconus and Ruffinus my faithfull ſeruants, I recommend my deere beloued children: for hereby the lone of the children is ſeene, in that the Father forgetteth them not at the houre of his death.
                     In this caſe of one onely thing I doe warne you, one onely thing
                           ••
                         require The loue of a maſter to his ſeruants you, one thing I deſire you, and one onely thing I command you, and that is, that you occupie not your minds in augmenting the realms and ſeignories of my children: but onely that you haue due reſpect to giue thē good education and vertuous ſeruāts: for it was onely the wiſe men which I had about me, that thus long haue maintained mee in this great authority. It is a goodly thing for a Prince to haue ſtout captains for the warres: but without compariſon it is better to keepe and haue wiſe men in his palace: for in the end, the victory of the battel confiſteth in the force of many: but the gouernment of the commonwelth oftentimes is put vnder the aduiſe of one alone.
                     Theſe ſo dolefull and pittifull words my Lord and Maſter Theodoſius ſpake vnto me. Now tell mee, Epimundus, what I ſhall doe at this preſent to fulfill his commendement? For at his heart hee had nothing that troubled him ſo much as to thinke whether his children would vndoe, or encreaſe the Common wealth. Thou Epimundus, thou art a Grecian, thou art a Philoſopher, thou haſt vnderſtanding, thou art an old ſeruant, thou art my faithfull friend: therefore for all theſe things thou art bound to giue mee good and healthfull counſell: For many times I haue heard Theodoſius my maſter ſay, That he is not accounted ſage which hath turned the leaues of many bookes: but hee which knoweth, and can giue good and healthfull counſell: Epimundus the philoſopher anſwered to theſe words; Thou knoweſt well, Lord Eſtilconus, that the ancients and great Philoſophers ought to be briefe in words, and very perfect in their works: for otherwiſe to ſpeake much, and worke little, ſeemeth rather to bee done like a tyrant, then like a Greeke Philoſopher. The Emperour Theodoſius was thy Lord, and my friend. I ſay friend, becauſe it is the liberty of a Greeke Philoſopher, to acknowledge no homage nor ſeruice to a ſuperiour: for hee in his heart can haue no true licence: that to rebuke the vitious keepeth his mouth ſhut. In one thing I content my ſelfe in Theodoſius aboue all other Princes, which were in the Romane Empire, and that is, that he knew and talked wiſely of al his affairs, and alſo was diligēt to execute the ſame: for all The fault of many Princes. the fault of princes is, that they are apt &amp; bold to talk of vertues, &amp; in executing

them, they are very ſlacke and fearfull. For ſuch Princes cannot continue in the vertue, which they doe commend: not yet reſiſt the vice which they doe diſprayſe.
                     I graunt that Theodoſius was an executor of iuſtice, mercifull, ſtout, ſober valiant, true, louing, thankfull, and vertuous: and finally, in all thinges, and at all times he was fortunate: for Fortune oftentimes bringeth that to princes, which they will and deſire: yea many times better then they look for. Preſupoſe it be true (as it is moſt true) that the time was alwayes proſperous to the Emperour Theodoſius: yet I doubt whether this proſperity will continue in the ſucceſſion of his children For worldly proſperity is ſo mutable, that with one onely man in a moment, ſhee maketh a thouſand ſhrewde turnes: and ſo much the The inconſtancy of the world. more it is hard to continue ſtedfaſt in the ſecond houre.
                     Of ſlow and dull horſes, come oftentimes couragious and fierce colts: and euen ſo of vertuousfathers come children euill brought vp: For the wicked children inherite the worſt of the Father, which is riches, and are diſhenherited of the beſt, which are vertues. That which I perceyne in this matter, as wel of the father which is dead, as of the children which are aliue, is that Theodoſe was vertuous in deede, and the children are capable to follow both good and euill, and therfore it is requiſite that you now go about it: for the Prince which is yong is in great perill, when in his youth he beginneth not to follow the ſteps of vertue.
                     To ſpeake particularly of Archadius &amp; Honorious, I let thee know Eſtilconus, that it is a thing ſuperfluous to talk of it; for I ſhould loſe my time, becauſe the things of princes are very delicate, and though wee haue licence to prayſe their vertues, yet wee are bound to diſſemble their faults.
                     As a ſage father, Theodoſe, I deſire thee to giue his children good doctrine, and alwayes to accompany thē: But I as a friend do counſell thee that thou keepe them from euill: for in the end all is euill to accompany with the euill, and forſake the good: but the worſt euill purſueth vs, rather by the preſence of the euill, then by the abſence of the good. It may wel be that one being alone, &amp; without the company of the good, may yet notwithſtā
                        ding be good: but for one that is accompanied with euil men, to be good of this I greatly doubt: for the ſame day that a man accompanieth himſelfe with the vicious, the ſelfe ſame day he is bound to be ſubiect to vice. O Eſtilconus, ſince thou ſo much deſireſt to accompliſh the commādemēt of thy Lord and maſter Theodoſe, if thou canſt not cauſe that Archadius &amp; Honorius (which are yong princes) do accompany with the good: yet at the leaſt withdraw them from the company of the euill: for in the courts of princes vitious men are none other but ſolicitors in this world to tempt others to be vicious: how many and what ſolicitors haue we ſeen, thou and I in Rome, the which forgetting the affaires of their Lords, did ſolicite for themſelues vices and pleaſures. I will not tell what ſeruants of princes haue The younger ſort muſt accompany with the vertuous. bin in times paſt, but what they were, and what they are, euery man may eaſily ſee. I will tell thee onely, not of thoſe which ought to be coūſellors to princes: but alſo of thoſe which ought not to liue in their courts: For the counſellors and officers of princes ought to be ſo iuſt: that ſheares cannot find what to cut away intheir liues nor that there needeth any needle or thred to amend their fame. If thou Eſtilconus haſt heard what I haue ſayd, marke now what I wil ſay, and keepe it in memory, for it may profit thee one day.
                     
                        
In the Courts of Princes proude men ought to haue no familiarity nor entertainement. For it is vnſeemely that thoſe which are not gentle in Proud and ambitious men ought not to gouerne. words ſhould commaund: and thoſe that haue not their hearts ready to obey, ſhould bee familiar with the Prince.
                     In the Courts of Princes, there ought not to bee of Counſell, and much leſſe familiar, enuious men: for if enuy raigne amongſt Princes and Counſellours there ſhall alwayes bee diſſentions in the common-wealth. In the Courts of Princes haſty men ought not to haue familiarity: for oftentimes it chanceth that the impatience of Counſellours, cauſeth the people to be euill content with their Princes.
                     In the Courts of Princes there ought not to be familiar, nor of counſell, greedy nor couetous men, for the Princes giue great occaſion to the people to bee hated, becauſe their ſeruants haue alwayes their hands open to receyue bribes,
                     In the Courtes of Princes there ought not to be familiar fleſhly men: for the vice of the fleſh hath in it ſo little profite, that he that is wholy ouercome therewith, is, or ought to be to the Prince alway ſuſpected.
                     In the Pallace of a King, there ought not to bee drunkards or gluttons: for whereas the familiars ought principally to ſerue their Princes with good counſel, in mine opinion a man being full &amp; ſurcharged with exceſſe is more like to bleach and breake wind after his ſurfet, then able to giue any profitable counſell in the Common wealth.
                     In the Pallace of Princes, ought not to be reſiant nor familiar blaſphemers: for the man which is a ſervant and openly dare blaſpheme his Creator, will not ſpare in ſecret to ſpeake euill of the Lord.
                     In the palace of Princes ought not to be of counſell nor familiar the negligent and delicate perſons: for there is nothing (next vnto the diuine prouidence) that helpeth Princes more to be puiſſant and mighty then when their ſeruants are faithfull and diligent.
                     In the pallace of Princes, defamed men ought not to haue familiarity: for the Prince cannot excuſe himſelfe to bee thought culpable, when they doe rebuke him, if in his houſe he maintaine ſeruants, which openly are defamed.
                     In the pallace of princes they ought not to ſuffer Ideots and fooles: for the realmes are not loſt for that the Princes are young, vncircumſpect, and vitious: but for that their Counſellours are ſimple and malitious.
                     Woe, woe be to the land, where the Lord is vitious, the ſubiect ſeditious, the ſeruant couetous, and the Counſellour ſimple and malitious: for then the common wealth periſheth when ignorance and malice raigneth in the prince and gouernour of the ſame,
                     Thoſe words paſſed betweene the noble Knight Eſtilconus, and the wiſe Philoſopher Epimundus, vpon the bringing vp of thoſe two princes Archadius and Honorius, And becauſe that princes and prelates might ſee, (which now haue the charge to gouerne people) how much the Auncients did deſire to haue ſage men about them notwithſtanding that I haue ſpoken, I will ſhew you heere ſome notable and ancient examples.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XLV. How Creſus King of Lydea was a great friend and louer of Sages. Of a letter the ſame Creſus wrote to the Philoſopher Anacharſis. And of an other letter of the Philoſophers anſwere to the King.
                     
                     
                        IN the yeare of the Creation of the World, 4355. and in the third age, Sardanapulus being king of the Aſſyrians, Ozias King of the Hebrewes, and Elchias being high Biſhop of the holy temple, at that time when Rea the mother of Romulus liued, in the ſecond yeare of the firſt Olimpiade, the great and renowmed Realme of Lydes had beginning: as Plinie in Plin lib. de nat. hiſt. the fift booke of the Naturall Hiſtory ſayth. Lidia is in Aſia minor, and firſt was called Meonia, &amp; afterwards was called Lidia, and now is called Morea. This Realme of Lydes had many worthy Cities, that is to ſay, Epheſe, Coloſe, Aclaſomena, and Phorea. The firſt King of Lydes was Ardiſius, a man of great courage, and a Grecian borne, and raigned 36. yeares. The ſecond, was Aliaces, who raigned 14, yeares. The third was Meleus, and he raigned 12. yeares. The fourth was Candale, and raigned 4. yeares. The fift was Ginginus, and raigned 5. yeares. The ſixt was Cerdus, and raigned 6. yeares. The 7. was Sadiates, and raigned 15. yeares. The eight was Allates, and he raigned 49. yeares, and the ninth was Creſus, and raigned 15. yeares: and of this King Creſus, Zenophon declareth, that hee was more valiant in feates of warre, then comely of perſonage: for though he was lame of one foote, blemiſhed of one eye, lacking one eare, and of body not much bigger then a dwarfe: yet for all this hee was a iuſt man, very conſtant, ſtoute, mercifull, The deſcription of Creſus. couragious, and aboue all hee was a great enemie to the ignorant; and a ſpeciall friend to the Sage.
                     Of this king Creſus, Seneca ſpeaketh in his booke of Clemency: and ſayeth, that the Sages were ſo entirely beloued of him, that the Greekes (which had the fountaine of eloquence) did not call him a louer, but entituled him the loue of Sages: for neuer no man did ſo much to attaine to the loue of his Lady, as hee did to draw to him, and to his Country ſage men.
                     This king Creſus therefore beeing Lord of many barbarous nations (the which loued better to drinke the bloud of the innocent, then to learne the ſcience of the wiſe) like an excellent prince determined for the comfort of his perſon, and remedy of his Common wealth, to ſearch out the greateſt Sages that were in Greece. At that time flouriſhed the famous and renowmed Philoſopher Anacharſis, who thogh he was born and brought vp amongſt the Seythians, yet hee was alwayes reſident notwithſtanding in Athens: For the Vniuerſity of Athens did not deſpiſe thoſe that were Barbarians, but thoſe that were vitious.
                     The King Creſus ſent an Ambaſſadour in great authority with riches, to the Philoſopher Anacharſis, to perſwade and deſire him, and with thoſe gifts and preſents to preſent him, to the end it might pleaſe him to come and ſee his perſon, and to ſet an order in his Common wealth.
                     
                        Creſus not contented to ſend him gifts which the Ambaſſadour carried, The godly minde of Creſus. but for to let him vnderſtand why he did ſo: wrote him a letter with his owne hand, as hereafter followeth.
                     
                        
                           
                           
                              The letter of King Creſus, to Anacharfis the Phyloſopher.
                           
                           
                              CReſus King of Lydes, wiſheth Anacharſis great Phyloſopher, which remaineſt in Athens, health to thy perſon, and increaſe of The letter of king Creſus. vertue. Thou ſhalt know how well I loue thee, in that I neuer ſaw thee, nor knew thee, to write vnto thee a letter. For the things which with the eyes haue neuer bin ſeen: ſeldomtimes with the heart are truely beloued. Thou doeſt eſteeme little (as truth is) theſe my ſmall gifts, and preſents which I ſend thee: yet I pray thee greatly eſteeme the will and heart wherewith. I do viſite thee. For noble hearts receiue more thankefully that which a man deſireth to giue them: then that which they do giue them in deede. I deſire to correct this my Realme, and to ſee amendement in the commonwealth.
                           I deſire good order for my perſon, and to take order touching the gouernement of my palace. I deſire to communicate with Sages, ſomethings of my life, and none of theſe things can bee done without thy preſence: for there was neuer any good thing made but by the meane of wiſedome. The deſcription of Creſus. I am lame, I am crooked, I am bald, I am a counterfeit, I am blacke, and alſo I am broken, finally, amongſt all other men I am a monſter. But all theſe imperfections are nothing to thoſe that remaine, that is to ſay, I am ſo vnfortunate, that I haue not a Phyloſopher with me. For in the world there is no greater ſhame, then not to haue a wiſe man about him to be conuerſant with all.
                           I count my ſelf to be dead, though to the ſimple fooles I ſeeme to bee a liue. And the cauſe of death is, becauſe I haue not with me ſome wiſe perſon. For truely he is onely aliue amongſt the liuing: who is accompanyed with the Sages.
                           I deſire thee greatly to come, and by the immortall gods I coniure thee that thou make no excuſe: and if thou wilt not at my deſire, doe it for that thou art bound. For many men ofttimes condiſcend to doe that which they would not: more for vertues ſake then to ſatisfie the demand of any other.
                           Thou ſhalt take that which my Embaſſador ſhall giue, and beleeue that which he ſhall tell in my behalfe, and by this my letter I doe promiſe thee, that when thou ſhalt ariue here, I will make thee treaſorer of my coffers, only counſailour of mine affaires, ſecretary of my counſell, father of my children, reformer of my Realme, maſter of my perſon, and Gouernour of my Commonwealth: finally, Anacharſis ſhall be Creſus, becauſe Creſus may be The liberal mind of Creſus. 
                              Anacharſis. I ſay no more, but the gods haue thee in their cuſtody, to whom I pray that they may haſten thy comming.
                           The Embaſſadour departed to goe to Athens, bearing with him this letter and many ſewels and bagges of gold: and by chance Anacharſis was reading in the Vniuerſitie at the arriuall of the Ambaſſadors of Athens. Who onely ſayd and did his meſſage to Anacharſis, preſenting vnto him the gifts and the letter. Of which thing all thoſe of the Vniuerſitie maruelled, for the barbarous Princes were not accuſtomed to ſeek Phyloſophers, to gouern their commonwealth: but to put them to death, and take from them their liues. After the great Phyloſopher Anacharſis had heard the Ambaſſage, ſeene the gifts, and receiued the lerter, with out altering his countenance, or elation of his perſon, impediment in his tong, or deſire of the riches immediatly before the phiſophers, ſayd theſe words, which hereafter are written.

For the heart taketh great pleaſure, to know the conditions and liues of all thoſe in the world.
                           It is well done to deſire and procure to know all the liues of the euill, to amend our owne. It is well done to procure and know the liues of the good for to follow them: but what ſhall we doe? ſince now a daies the euill doe not deſire to know the liues of the euill, but for to couer them and keepe them ſecret, and doe not deſire to know the liues of the good for to follow them.
                           I let thee know, king Creſus, that the Phyloſophers of Greece felt not ſo much paine to be vertuous, as they felt in defending them from the vitious, For if a man once behold vertue, immediatly ſhe ſuffereth to be taken: but the euill for any good that any man can doe vnto them, neuer ſuffers themſelues to be vanquiſhed. I beleeue well that tyrannie of the Realm is not ſo great as they talke of here, neither oughteſt thou likewiſe to beleeue that I am ſo vertuous, as they report me to be here. For in mine opinion thoſe which declare newes of ſtrange countries, are as the poore which weare their garments al patched and peeced, wherof the peeces that were ſowne on a new, are in more quantitie of cloth: then the old which before they had, when they were firſt made,
                           Beware (king Creſus) and bee not as the barbarous Princes are, which vſe good words, to couer the infamy of their cruel deeds.
                           Maruel not though we Phyloſophers, readers in ſchooles, deſire not to liue with princes and gouernors of realms: For euil Princes for none other intent ſeeke the company of wiſe men, but onely becauſe they would through them excuſe their faults. For doing as thou doeſt, of will, and not of right, you will that the vulgar people thinke you do it by the counſel of a wiſe man. I let thee vnderſtand, king Creſus, that the prince which deſireth to gouerne his people well, ought not to be content to haue one onely Sage in his Pallace. For it is not meete that the gouernement of many do conſiſt in the aduiſe of one alone.
                           The Ambaſſadour hath ſayde by word, and the ſelfe ſame thy letter teſtifieth, that thou art certified that I am counted for Sage throughout all Greece, &amp; that this preſuppoſed, I wold come to thee to gouerne thy commonwealth.
                           And for the contrary, thou doing thus as thou doeſt, condemneſt mee to be an Idiot, for thou thinking that I would take thy gold, is nothing elſe, but for to raile vpon me as a foole.
                           The chiefe point wherein true philoſophy is knowne, is when he deſpiſeth the things of the world: for there neuer agreeth together the libertie of the ſoule, and the care of the goods in this life,
                           O king Creſus, I let thee vnderſtand that hee which knoweth moſt the Wherein conſiſteth true phyloſophy. cauſe of the Element is not called Sage: but it is he which leaſt knoweth the vices of this world. For the true phyloſopher profiteth more by not knowing the euill, then by learning the good.
                           I let thee vnderſtand I am threeſcore

and ſeuen yeares old, and yet neuer before this time there reigned ire in me, but when thy Ambaſſage was preſented to me, and that I ſaw layde at my feete ſuch treaſures and riches. For vpon this deed I gather, that either wiſedome lacketh in thee, or that great couetouſnes aboundeth in me.
                           I doe ſend thee thy gold againe which thou ſendeſt me, and rhy Ambaſſadour ſhall declare (as witneſſe of ſight) how greatly it hath ſlandered all Greece. For it was neuer ſeene nor heard of, that in any wiſe they ſhould ſuffer gold to enter into the Vniuerſitie How little the phyloſophers deſire riches. of Athens. For it ſhould not onely bee a diſhonour to the Phyloſophers of Greece to haue riches, but alſo it would turne them to great infamie to deſire them.
                           O King Creſus, if thou knoweſt it not, it is but reaſon thou know it, that in the Schooles of Greece wee learne not to command, but to obey: not to ſpeake, but to be ſilent: not to reſiſt, but to humble our ſelues: not to get much, but to content vs with little: not to reuenge offences, but to pardon iniuries: not to take from others, but to giue our owne: not to be honored, but to trauaile to be vertuous: finally, we learne to deſpiſe that which other men loue: and to loue that which other men deſpiſe, which is pouertie. Thou thoughteſt that I would accept thy gold, or elſe that I would not. If thou thoughteſt I would haue taken it, then thou haddeſt had reaſon not to haue receiued me afterwards into thy Palace: for it is a great infamie, that the couetous man ſhuld be acceptable to a Prince. If thou thoughtſt that I wold none of it, thou wert not wiſe to take the pains to ſend it: for Princes ought neuer to take vpon them things, wherein (as they thinke) that ſubiects ſhould loſe their honeſtie in receiuing them.
                           Seeking Creſus and behold that by diligence it litle auayleth to ſearch for the phyſition, and afterwards to doe nothing of that which by him is ordained.
                           I meane that it ſhall not profit, but rather it ſhall be harme, that I come into thy commonwealth, and that afterwards thou wilt not do that which I ſhall ordaine therein, for great dangers enſue to alter the humors with ſiropes: vnleſſe they take afterwards a purgation to purge away the ſame. For to redreſſe thy barbarous realme, and to ſatisfie thy good deſire, I am determined to condiſcend vnto thy requeſt, and to accompliſh thy commandement, vpon condition, that thou ſhalt enſure mee of theſe things following.
                           For the laborer ought not to ſow his ſeede before the ground be plowed and tilled.
                           
                              The firſt, thou ſhalt for ſake the euill 
                              Certaine points required to be performed by the phyſopher. 
                              cuſtome which ye barbarous kings dovſe, that is to ſay, to heape vp treaſures, and not to ſpend them. For euery Prince which is couetous of treaſures, is ſcarcely of capacitie to receiue good counſell:
                           
                           
                              The ſecond, thou ſhalt not onely baniſh out of thy palace: but alſo out of thy court al flatterers, for the Prince that is a friend to flatterers of neceſſitie muſt be an enemie of the truth.
                           
                           
                              The 3. thou ſhalt end the wars that thou (at this preſent) doeſt maintaine againſt the people of Corinth, for euery Prince that loueth forraine warres, muſt needs hate the peace of his commonwealth.
                           
                           
                              The fourth, thou ſhalt baniſh from thy houſe all Iuglers, comediants and miniſtrels. For the Prince which occupieth himſelfe to heare vaine and trifling things, in time of neceſsitie ſhall not apply himſelfe to thoſe which bee of weight and importance.
                           
                           
                              Fiftly, thou ſhalt prouide that all loyterers and vacabonds bee expulſed from thy perſon, and baniſhed thy palace: for iidleneſſe
                              
                              and negligence are cruell enemies of wiſedome.
                           
                           
                              Sixtly, thou ſhalt baniſh from thy court and palace, and liers all ſeditious men: for when liers are ſuffered in the Palace of Princes, it is a ſigne that the king and the realme falleth into vtter deſtruction.
                           
                           
                              The ſeuenth, thou ſhalt promiſe that in the dayes of thy life thou ſhalt not preſſe me to receiue any thing of thee: for the day that thou ſhalt corrupt me with gifts it is neceſſary that I corrupt thee with euill counſels. For there is no counſell that is good, but that which proceedeth from the man that is not couetous.
                           
                           If on theſe conditions the king Creſus deſireth the Philoſopher Anacharſis, the Philoſopher Anacharſis deſireth the king Creſus: and if not, I had rather bee a diſciple of ſage philoſophers, then a king of the barbarous people. Vale felix Rex. Sith this letter doeth declare it, it is needleſſe for my pen to write it, that is to ſay, what was the humanitie and goodneſſe of king Creſus, to write vnto a poore Phyloſopher: and how great the courage of a philoſopher was to deſpiſe the gold, and to ſay (as he did) in this behalfe. Therefore let princes note heare, that ſuch ought the Sages to bee they ſhould chuſe, and let Sages note here alſo vpon what conditions they ought to enter into the palace of princes. For this is ſuch a bargaine, that it ſeldome times chanceth, but that one of the parties are deceiued.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP XLVI. Of the wiſedome and ſentences of Phalaris the tyrant, and how he put an Artiſan to death for inuenting new torments.
                     
                     IN the laſt yeare of the Latines, and in the firſt yeare of the Romaines Ezechias being king of the Iewes, and Azaria great Biſhop of the holy temple, Abacucke Prophet in Iewrie, and Merodach being king in Babylon, and when the Lacedemonians built Byzance (which now is Conſtantinople,) Phalaris the famous Tyrant was then liuing.
                     Of this Phalaris, Ouid ſaith, that he was deformed in his face, pore The deſcription of Phalaris. blinde of his eyes, and exceeding couetous of riches, and neuer obſerued any thing that he promiſed. He was thankfull to his friends, and cruell to his enemies: finally, he was ſuch a one, that tyrannies which ſeuerally were ſcattered in others, in him alone were altogether aſſembled.
                     Amongſt all the iniquities that he inuented, and amongſt the tyranies that he committed, he had one vertue very great, which was, that euen as he was head of all tyrannies, ſo was he chief louer and friends of all phyloſophers and ſage men.
                     And in all thoſe ſixe and thirtie yeares which he gouerned the Realm by tyrannie, they neuer found that any man touched his beard, nor that any man ſate at his table with him, ſpake vnto him, or ſlept in his bed, nor that any man ſaw in his countenance any mirth, vnleſſe it were ſome Phyloſopher or Sage man, with whom, and to whom hee liberally put his body in truſt.
                     
                        The Prince that abſenteth himſelfe from Sage men, and accompanieth with fooles: I ſay vnto him, though hee bee a Prince of his commonwealth, he is a cruel perſon. For it is a greater paine to liue among fooles, then to die amongſt Sages. Pulio in his firſt booke, Degeſtis Romanorum ſayth, that a worthy and excellent painter preſented a table to Octauian the Emperour, wherein were drawne all the vertuous Princes, and for their Chiefetaine, Octauian the Emperour was drawne: at the foote of this table were all the tyrannous princes painted, of the which Phalaris
                        
was chiefe and Captaine. This table viewed by Octauian the Emperour, he commendeth the worke, but hee diſallowed the intention thereof, ſaying, The ſpeech 
                              〈…〉
                           . 
                        Me thinks not meete that I being a liue, ſhould be ſet chiefe and principall of all the vertuous men that are dead. For during the time of this wicked life, we reall ſubiect to the vices of weake &amp; feeble fleſh. Alſo it ſeemeth vnto me an vniuſt doing, that they ſhould put Phalaris for principall and Captaine of all the tyrants: ſince he was a ſcourge and enemie to fooles and ignorant men: and ſo earneſt a louer and friend of Sages, and wiſe Phyloſophers The fame of this cruell Phalaris being knowne, and his extreme cruelties he vſed, ſpred through all Greece.
                     
                     A neighbour and Artificer of Athens called Perillus (a man very excellent in mettels, and a great worker in works of fountaines,) came to Phalaris the tyrant, ſaying, that he would make ſuch a kinde of torment, that his heart ſhould remaine reuenged, and the offender well puniſhed. The matter was, that this workeman made a Bull of Braſſe, wherein there was a gate by the which they put the offender, and in putting the fire vnder the Bull, it roared, and cryed, in manner as it had bene aliue: which thing was not onely a horrible and cruell torment to the miſerable creature that endured it, but alſo it was terrible to him or thoſe that ſaw it.
                     Let vs not maruell neither at the one, nor at the orhet: for truely the pitifull heart (which is not fleſhed in in crueltie) hath as much pitie to ſee another man ſuffer, as of the ſorow and torment which hee himſelfe feeleth.
                     
                        Phalaris therefore ſeeing the inuenuention of this torment, (whereof the inuentor hoped for great reward) prouided, that the inuentor of the ſame ſhould bee put within the Bull, and that the cruelty of the torment ſhuld be experimented in none, ſaue onely on the inuentor.
                     Truely in this caſe Phalaris ſhewed himſelfe not a cruell tyrant, but rather a mercifull Prince and a Sage Phyloſopher: for nothing can bee more iuſt, then that the inuention of the ma
                           •
                        ce bee executed on the fraile fleſh the inuentor.
                     Now becauſe Phalaris was a greate friend of Sages, the Philoſophers of Greece came oftentimes to ſee him, which were very gently receyued of him. Though to ſay the trueth they profited more with his goods, then he did with their Philoſophy.
                     This tyrant Phalaris was not onely a friend of Sages: but alſo hee was very well learned, and deepely ſeen in morall Philoſophy: the which thing appeareth well in the Epiſtles which he wrote with his owne hand, I can not tell wherein hee ſhewed himſelfe greater, eyther in the ſentences and doctrines which hee wrote with his penne: or in the ſlaughter and cruelties which he did with his ſword.
                     O how many companions had Phalaris the tyrant, in this caſe in times paſt, and that (as I would) there were none alſo at this time preſent, which in their pleaſant wordes The frailtie of the fleſh. did reſemble the Emperour Nero.
                     
                     I neuer read other thing of thoſe that are gone, neither haue I ſeene otherwiſe of thoſe that are preſent, but many they are that blaſe vertues, and infinite which runne after vices. For of truth wee are very light of tongue and too feeble of fleſh.
                     The Epiſtles which this Phalaris wrote are knowne to al men, I meane of thoſe which know Greek, or Laten: and for thoſe that know them not, I was willing to draw theſe that are preſent, and to put them in our vulgar tongue for two cauſes.
                     The one to the end Princes might

ſee how good a thing it is to be Sage, and how tyrants 
                           •
                        were prayſed for being Sages, and giuing good counſell.
                     The other, to the end the people might ſee how eaſie it is to ſpeake wel and how hard it is to worke well. For there is nothing better cheape in the world then counſell. The ſententences therefore of the Epiſtles of Phalaris are theſe which follow, in ſuch ſort as I could moſt briefly gather them, to reduce them in good and profitable ſtile to write them.
                     The particular loue which princes ſhew to one more then to another, breedeth oftentimes much enuy in their realmes For the one being loued and the other hated, of this commeth hatred, and of hatred commes euill thoughts, of euill thoughts proceedeth malice, and of malice commeth euill words, the which breake out into worſe deeds.
                     Finally, when a Prince ſheweth not to equals his fauour indifferently, he ſetteth fire in his commonwealth. Princes ought to forbid, and ſages ought to conſent, that rebels and quarellers ſhuld trouble thoſe which are quiet and peace makers: for when the people riſe, immediatly couetouſneſſe Couetouſnes the ouer throw of Iuſtice. is awaked. When couetouſneſſe groweth, iuſtice falleth, force and violence ruleth, ſnatching reigneth, lecherie is at libertie, the euill haue power, and the good are oppreſſed: finally all do reioyce one to liue to the preiudice of another, and euery man to ſeeke his owne priuate commoditie. Manie vaine men do raiſe diſcentions and quarrels amongſt the people, thinking that in troubled water, they ſhould augment their eſtates, who in ſhort ſpace doe not onely loſe the hope of that they ſought: but alſo are put out of that they poſſeſſed. For it is not onely reaſonable, but alſo moſt iuſt, that thoſe by experience feele that, which their blinde malice will not ſuffer them to know.
                     It is much good for the people that the gouernours bee not vnfortunate, but that of their nature they were happy. For to luckie princes fortune giueth many things euen as they demand, yea and giueth them better then they locke for. What princes ought to doe.
                     
                     The noble and valiant Princes, when they ſee themſelues with other princes, or that they are preſent in great acts, ought to ſhew the freenes of their hearts, the greatneſſe of their realme, the preheminence of their perſon, the loue of their commonwealth, and aboue all the diſcipline of their court, and the grauitie of their counſell and pallace. For the Sage and curious men ſhould not behold the prince in the apparrell, which hee weareth: but the men which he hath to counſell him.
                     The Sage men, and thoſe that be not couetous, if they doe employ their forces to heape vp treaſures, ought to remember in their hearts, how to employ themſelues to ſpende their money well: Sith fortune is Miſtreſſe in all things, and that to her they doe impute both good and euill workes, hee alone may be called a princely man, who for no contrariety of fortune is ouercome: For truly that man is of a ſtout courage, whoſe heart is not vanquiſhed by the force of Fortune: Though we prayſe one for valiant with the ſword, wee will not therefore prayſe him for excellent with the penne. Although hee bee excellent with his penne, hee is not therefore excellent with his tongue: Though he haue a good tongue, hee is not therefore well learned: And though hee be learned, hee hath not therfore a good renowm, And thogh hee hath a good renowme he is not therefore of a good life: For wee are bound to receiue the doctrine, of many which write: but we are not bound

to follow the liues which they doe leade. There is no worſe office amongſt men, then for to take the charge to puniſh the vices of another, and therefore a man ought to fly from it, as for the peſtilence: for in correcting vices, hatred is more ſure to the corrector, then amendment of life is to the offender. He hath &amp; poſſeſſeth much that hath good friends: for many aide their friends when they would haue holpē them more if they could. For the true loue is not wearyed to loue, nor ceaſeth not to profite. Though Sage men haue loſt much, they ought not therfore to diſpaire, but that they ſhall come to it againe in time. For in the ende time doth not ceaſe to doe his accuſtomed alterations, nor perfect friends ceaſe not to doe that which they ought.
                     The proud &amp; diſdainfull man (for the moſt part) alwayes falleth into ſome euill chaunce: therefore it is a commendable medecine ſome times to be perſeecuted, for aduerſitie maketh a wiſe man liue more ſafely, &amp; to walke in leſſe daunger. For ſo much as wee doe excuſe him which cōmitteth the fault, there is neither the offender, nor the offence but deſerueth paine. For ſuch a one that committeth the faulte through ſudden anger, did euill: and if hee did commit it by deliberation, he did much worſe. To deſire to doe all things by reaſon is good, and likewiſe to lay them all in order is good, but it is very harde: For temperate men haue ſuch reſpect in compaſſing their doings, and by weight to caſt all the inconueniences, that ſcarcely they euer determine to goe about it.
                     To the man which hath gouernement two things are dangerous, that is to ſay, too ſoone, or too late: But of thoſe two, the worſt is too ſoone. For if by determining late, a man looſeth that which he might haue gotten: by determining too ſoone, that is loſt, which is now gained, and that which a man might haue gained.
                     To men which are too haſty, chance daylie manie euills and daungers, as ſaith the old prouerbe, The haſty man neuer wanteth woe: For the man being vnpacient, and hauing his vnderſtanding Two things requiſite in euery man. high, afterwards come quarrels and brawlings, diſpleaſures, varieties, and alſo vanities, which loſeth their goods, and putteth their perſons in danger. Sith all naturally deſire to bee happie, hee alone amongſt all others may be called happie, of whom they may truely ſay: Hee gaue good doctrine to liue &amp; leſt good example to dye.
                     
                     Theſe and many other ſentences of Phalaris the Tyrant, wrote in his Letters, whereof Cicero profited much in his works, and Seneca alſo in his Epiſtles, and manie other writers beſides. For this Tyraunt was verie briefe in wordes, and compendious in Sentences.
                     This Phalaris being in his Cittie of Agrigentine, a Phyloſopher of Greece wrote him a taunting Letter, charging him with Tyrannie: to which he made anſwere with this Letter following.
                     
                        
                           
                              The Letter of Phalaris the Tyrant, to Popharco the Phyloſopher.
                           
                           
                              PHalaris Agrigentine, wiſheth vnto The letter of Phalaris. thee Popharco the Phyloſopher, health and conſolation, through the comfortable Gods. I receyued thy Letter heere in Agrigentine, and though it ſauoured ſomewhat Satyrlike, I was not agrieued therewith: For of Phylyſophers and Sages, (as thou art,) wee ſhould not bee grieued with the ſharpe wordes you tell vs, but onely to conſider the intention

whervpō you ſpeake them. Quarrellers &amp; malicious perſons, will haue the words by weight and meaſute, but the vertuous and patient men do not regard but the intentions. For if wee ſhould goe about to examine euery word they ſpeake vnto vs, wee ſhould giue our ſelues to much paine, and we ſhould alwayes ſet in the Common-wealth debate. I am a Tyrant, and as yet am in tyrannie: but I ſweare vnto the immortal gods, whether the words were good or bad, I neuer altered it. For if a good man tell it mee, I take it for my paſtime. Thou writeſt vnto me that all Greece is offended with mee there: but I let thee vnderſtand, that all Agrigentine is all edified with thee here. And thereof thou maiſt praiſe mee. For if the Tyrants were not ſo much diſprayſed, the Phyloſophers ſhould not be ſo well loued. Thou art counted for good, and art good: and I am counted for euill, and am euill: But in mine opinion thou ſhuldſt not be proud for the one, neither I ſhould diſpaire for the other. For the day of the life is long, and therein Fortune doth many things: and it may wel be, that from a tyrant I ſhall be a Phyloſopher: and thou from a phyloſopher ſhalt be a tirant. See my Friend, that the long time maketh oftentimes the Earth to be turned to ſiluer: and the ſiluer and Gold becommeth nothing worth. I meane, that there neuer was a tirant in any realme, but that firſt he had bene brought vp in the ſtudie of Greece. I will not denie, that all the renowmed Tyrants haue not bin nouriſhed in Scictle: but alſo thou ſhalt not deny me, that they were not borne in Greece. Therefore ſee and beholde to whom the faulte is: from the mother which bare them, or from the Nurſe which gaue them ſucke. I doe not ſay that it ſhall bee, but I ſay that it may well be, that if I were there in Greece, I ſhould bee a better philoſopher then thou: and if thou wert heere in Agrigentine, thou wouldeſt be a worſer Tyrant then I. I would thou ſhouldeſt think, that thou mighteſt be better in Greece where thou art: &amp; that I might be worſe in Agrigentine, where I am. For that thou doſt not ſo much good as thou mighteſt do: and I doe not ſo much euil as I may doe. The cunning man Perillus came into theſe parts and hath made a Bull, wherin he hath put a kind of torment, the moſt fearfulleſt in the world: and truely I cauſed, that that which his malice had inuented, ſhould be of none other then of himſelfe experimēted. For there is no iuſter Cruelty wel rewarded. law, that when any workmā hath inuented Engins, to make other men die, then to put them to the torments by them inuented, to know the experience in themſelues. I beſeech thee hartily to come &amp; ſee me, and be thou aſſured thou ſhalt make me good. For it is a good ſigne for the ſick, when he acknowledgeth his ſicknes to the phiſitian. I ſay no more to thee, but that once againe I returne to ſolicite thee, that thou faileſt not to come ſee mee, for in the ende, if I doe not profite of thee, I am ſure thou ſhalt profite by me, &amp; if thou winneſt, I cannot loſe.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XLVII. How Philip K: of Macedonie, Alexander the great, the K: Ptolomeus, the K: Antigonus, the K: Archelaus, &amp; Pirrus K: of the Epirotes, were all great louers and friendes of the Sages,
                     
                     IF Quintus Curtius deceiue me not, the great Alexāder, ſonne to k. Philip of Macedonie, did not deſerue to bee called great, for that hee was accompanied The praiſe of Alexander the great. with thouſands of men of Warre, but onely hee wanne the renowne of Great, for that hee had more Phyloſophers on his Counſell

then all other Princes had.
                     This great Prince neuer tooke vpon him Warres, but that firſt the order of executing the ſame ſhould before his preſence be examined of the The prayſe of Alexander the Great. Sages, and wiſe Phyloſophers. And truely hee had reaſon: for in affayres where good counſells haue proceeded, they may alwayes looke for a good ende.
                     Theſe Hyſtoriographers which wrote of great Alexander (as well the Grecians as the Latines,) knowe not whether the fierceneſſe wherewith he ſtrooke his Enemyes was greater, or the humanity wherewith hee embraced his counſel. Though the ſage philoſophers which ſo accompanyed the great Alexander, were manie in number: yet notwithſtanding amongſt all thoſe, Ariſtotle, Anaxarcus, and Oneſichrates, were his moſt familiars. And heerein Alexander ſhewed himſelfe very wiſe. For wiſe Princes ought to take the counſell of manie, but they ought to determine and conclude vpon the opinion of fewe.
                     The great Alexander did not content himſelfe to haue Sages with him, neyther to ſend onely to deſire thoſe which were not his: but oftentimes himſelf in perſon would go ſee them, viſite them, and counſell with them, Saying: That the Princes which are the ſeruants of Sages, come to be made Maiſters and Lordes ouer all.
                     
                     In the time of Alexander Magnus, Diogenes the philoſopher liued, who neither for intreatie, nor yet for any promiſes that were made, would come for to ſee Alexander the Great. Wherefore Alexander the Great went for to ſee him, and when hee had deſired him that hee would goe with him, and accompany him, Diogenes anſwered.
                     
                        O Alexander, ſince that thou 
                        The ſaying of Diogines. 
                        wilt winne honour in keeping of men in thy company: it is not reaſon then that I ſhould looſe it, to forſake my ſtudie. For in following of thee, I ſhall not follow my ſelfe: and beeing thine, I ſhall ceaſe to bee mine.
                     
                     
                        Thou art come to haue the name of the Great Alexander, for conquering the world, and I haue attained to come to renowme of a good Phyloſopher, in flying the world. And if thou doſt imagine that thou haſt gotten and wonne: I thinke I haue not erred nor loſt. And ſince thou wilt be no leſſe in authoritie then a King, doe not thinke that I will loſe the eſtimation of a Phyloſopher. For in the world there is no greater loſſe vnto a man, then when hee looſeth his proper libertie.
                     
                     When he had ſpoken theſe words, Alexander ſaide vnto them that were about him with a lowde voyce: By 
                        The ſaying of Alexander. 
                        the immortall Gods I ſweare, and as god Mars rule my hands in Battell, if I were not Alexander the Great, I would bee Diogenes the Phyloſopher.
                     
                     And hee ſaide further, In mine opinion there is no other Felicitie vpon the earth then to bee King Alexander. who commaundeth all, or to bee Diogenes to commaund Great Alexander: who commaundeth all,
                     
                     As king Alexander was more familiar with ſome Philoſophers, then with others: ſo hee eſteemed ſome bookes more then others. And they ſay he read oftentimes in the Iliades of Homer, which is a booke where the ſtory of the deſtruction of Troy is: and that when he ſlept, he layd vnder his head vpon a bolſter his ſword, and alſo his booke.
                     When the great King Alexander was borne, his father Philip king of Macedonia did two notable things. The firſt was, that hee ſent many Two notable things of K. Philip of Macedonie. and very rich gifts into the Ile of Delphos, where the Oracle of Apollo was, to the ende to preſent them with him, and to pray him, that it would pleaſe him for to preſerue his ſonne.
                     
                        
The other thing that hee did was, that immediately hee wrote a letter to the great Philoſopher Ariſtotle, wherin he ſayd theſe words.
                     
                        
                           
                              The letter of King Philip to Ariſtotle the Phyloſopher,
                           
                           
                              
                                 PHilip King of Macedonia wiſhes health and peace, to the philoſopher Ariſtotle which readeth in the Vniuerſitie of Greece, I let the vnderſtand that Olympias my wife is brought to bedde of a goodly man childe, whereof both ſhe and I, and all Macedonia do reioyce: For kings and Realms ought to haue great ioy, when that there is borne a ſonne ſueccſſour of the natural prince of the prouince. I render thankes vnto the immortall gods, and haue ſent many great gifts to the Temples, and it was not ſo much for that I haue a ſon, as for that they haue giuenhim vnto me, in the time of ſo great and excellent Philoſopher. I hope that thou wilt bring him vp, &amp; teach him in ſuch ſort that by heritage hee ſhall be Lord of my patrimony of Macedonia, and by deſert he ſhall be Lord of Aſia: to that they ſhould call him my ſonne, and thee his father. Vale foelix, iterumque vale.
                           
                           
                              Ptolomeus father in law, who was the eight king of the Aegyptians, did greatly loue the Sages as well of Caldea, as of Greece, and this thing was eſteemed for a great vertue in king Ptolome: For there was as much enuy betweene the phyloſophers of Greece, and the Sages of Egypt: as betweene the Captaines of Rome, and the Captaines of Carthage.
                           
                           This Ptolome was very wiſe, and did deſire greatly to bee accompanied The prayſe of Ptolome with Phyloſophers: and after this hee learned the letters of the Latines, Caldes, and Hebrues: for the which cauſe, though the kings named Ptolomei were eleuen in number, and all warrelike men: yet they put this for the Chiefe, and Captaine of all, not for battels which hee wanne, but for the ſentences which he learned.
                           This king Ptolomeus had for his familiar, a Philoſopher called Eſtilpho Magarenſe, who was ſo entirely beloued of this Prince, that (laying aſide gentleneſſe and benefits which hee ſhewed him) hee did not onely eate with the king at his table: but oftentimes the king made him drink of his owne cup.
                           And as the ſauours which Princes ſhew to their ſeruants, are but as a watch to proue the malitious: it chanced, that when this king gaue the philoſopher to drinke that which remayned in his cuppe, an Egyptian knight moued with enuy, ſayde vnto King Ptolome. I thinke Lord how thou art neuer ſatisfied with drinking, to leaue that which remaineth in the cuppe, for the Philoſopher to drinke after thee. To whom the king anſwered. Thou ſayſt well, that the Phyloſopher Eſtilpho is neuer filled with that which I doe giue him: For that which remaineth in my cup, doth not profite him ſo much to drinke: as the Phyloſophy which remaineth in him ſhould profite thee, if thou wouldſt take it.
                           
                           The king Antigonus was one of the moſt renowmed ſeruants that king Alexander the great euer had, who after his death enherired a great part of his Alexander vnhappy in his death. Empire: for how much happy the king Alexander was in his life, ſo much hee was vnhappy at the time of his death: becauſe he had no children which might enherite his goods, and that hee had ſuch ſeruants as ſpoyled him of his renowme.
                           This king Antigonus was an vnthriſt, and exceſſiue in all vices: But for all hee loued greatly the phyloſophers,

which thing remained vnto him from king Alexander, whoſe pallace was a ſchoole of al the good phyloſophers of the world. Of this enſample they may ſee what great profite enſueth, of bringing vp of them that bee yong, for there is none that euer was ſo wicked or inclined vnto euill: but that in long continuance may profite ſomwehat in his youth.
                           This king Antigonus loued two philoſophers greatly, the which floriſhed in that time, that is to ſay, Amenedius, and Abio, of which two Abio was wel learned, and very poore: For in that time no phyloſopher durſt openly reade philoſophy, as if hee were worth any thing in temporall goods.
                           As Laertius ſayth, and as Pulio declares it better, in the book of the rulers and noble men of the Greekes.
                           The Schooles of the Vuiuerſitie were ſo correct, that the philoſopher which knew moſt, had leaſt goods: ſo that they did not glorifie of any thing eiſe, but to haue pouertie, Pholoſophers onely reioyce in pouertie. and to know much of philoſophy. The caſe was ſuch, that the phyloſopher Abio was ſicke, and with that ſickenes he was ſo vexed, that they might almoſt ſee the bones of his weake bodie. The king Antigonus ſent to viſite him by his owne ſonne, by whom hee ſent him much money to helpe him withall. For hee liued in extreame pouertie, as it behoued the profeſſors of phyloſophy. Abio was ſore ſicke being aged, and crooked, and though he had made himſelfe ſo leane with ſickneſſe: yet notwithſtanding he burned alwayes vpon the weeke of good life. I meane that he had no leſſe courage to deſpiſe thoſe gifts: then the king Antigonus had nobles to ſend them.
                           This Phyloſopher not contented to haue deſpiſed thoſe gifts in ſuch ſort, ſayd vnto the ſonne of Antigonus who brought them: Tell king Antigonus that I giue him great thankes, for the good entertainement hee gaue me alwayes in my life, and for the gifts he ſends mee now at my death.
                           
                           
                              For one friend can doe more to another, then to offer him his perſon, to depart with his proper goods. Tell the king thy father, that I maruell what hee ſhould meane, that I now beeing foure ſcore yeares of age, and haue walked all my life time naked in this world, ſhould now be laden with veſtures and money, ſince I 
                              A cuſtome among the Egyptians. 
                              muſt paſſe ſo great a gulfe in the Sea, to go out of this world, The Egyptians haue a cuſtome to lighten the burden of their Camels when they paſſe the Deſartes of Arabia, which is much better then to ouercharge them. I meane, that he onely paſſeth without trauell the dangers of the life, which baniſheth frō him that thought of temporall goods of this world.
                           
                           
                              Thirdly, thou ſhalt ſay to the King thy Father, that from hence forth when any man will dye, he doe not ſuccour nor helpe him with Money, Golde, nor Riches, but with good and ripe counſell. For Golde will make him leaue his life with ſorrow, and good Counſell will moue him to take his death with patience.
                           
                           The fifth king of the Macedonians was called Archelaus, who they ſay to be the grandfather of king Philip, father of the great Alexander. This king boaſteth himſelfe to deſcend from Menelaus King of the Grecians, and principall Captaine which was at the deſtruction of Troy. This king Archelaus was a great friend to the Sages, and amongſt others there was a Poet with him called Euripides, who at that time had no leſſe glory in his kinde of Poetrie: then Archelaus in his king dome being king of Macedonia. For now a dayes, we eſteeme more the Sages for the bookes which they wrote then we do exalt kings for the Realms which they ruled, or the battels which they ouercame.
                           
                              
The familiaritie which Euripides had with the king Archelaus was ſo great, that in the Realme of Macedonie nothing was done, but firſt it was examined by the hands of this Philoſopher.
                           And as the ſimple and ignorant would not naturally be ſubiect to the The miſerable death of Euripdes. Sage: it chanced that one night Euripides was talking a long time with the King, declaring vnto him the ancient Hiſtories: and when the poore Poet would depart to goe home to his houſe, his enemies eſpyed him, and let the hungrie dogges flie vpon him: the which did not onely teare him in peeces, but alſo eate him euery morſell. So that the intrayles of the dogges, were the wofull graue of the moſt miſerable Poet.
                           The King Archelaus being certified of this wofull caſe, immediately (as ſoone as they told him) was ſo chafed, that almoſt he was bereft of his ſenſes. And hereat maruell not at all: For gentle hearts doe alter greatly, when they are aduertiſed of any ſuddaine miſhappe. As the loue which the King had to Euripides in his life was much, ſo likewiſe the ſorow which he felt at his death was very great: for he ſhed many teares from his eyes, he cut the hairs off his head, he rounded his beard, hee changed his apparrell which he ware, and aboue all, he made as ſolemne a funerall to Euripides, as if they had buried Vliſſes. And not contented with al theſe things he was neuer merry, vntill ſuch time he had done cruell execution of the malefactors: for truely the iniury or death which is done vnto him whom wee loue: is no other but as a bath and token of our owne good wills. After iuſtice was executed of thoſe homicides, and that ſome of the bones (all gnawne of the dogs) were buried, a Grecian Knight ſaid vnto King Archelaus, I let the know (excellent king) that all Macedonta is offended with thee becauſe that for ſo ſmall a loſſe thou haſt ſhewed ſo great ſorrow.
                           
                           To whom king Archelaus aunſwered, Among Sages it is a thing ſufficiently 
                              The worthy ſaying of Archelaus. 
                              often tryed, that noble hearts ought not to ſhew themſelues ſad for miſhaps and ſodaine chances: for the king being ſadde his Realme cannot, (and though it might, it ought not) ſhew it ſelfe merry. I haue heard my father ſay once, that Princes ſhould neuer ſhed teares, vnleſſe it were for one of theſe cauſes.
                           
                           1 The firſt, the Prince ſhould bewaile the loſſe &amp; danger of his common wealth: for the good Prince ought to pardon the iniuries done to his perſon, but to reuenge the leaſt act done to the Common-wealth, he ought to hazard himſelfe.
                           2 The ſecond, the good Prince ought to lament, if any man haue touched his honour in any wiſe: for the prince which weepeth not drops of bloud for the things touching his honour, deſerueth to be buried quicke in his graue.
                           3 The third, the good Prince ought to bewayle thoſe which can little, and ſuffer much: For the Prince which bewayleth not the calamities of the poore, in vaine, and without profit liueth on the earth.
                           4 The fourth, the good Prince ought to bewayle the glory and proſperity wherein the tyrants are: For that Prince which with tyranny of the euill is not diſpleaſed, with the hearts of the good is vnworthy to bee beloued.
                           5 The fift, the good Prince ought to bewayle the death of Wiſe men: For to a Prince there can come no greater loſſe, then when a wiſe man dyeth in his Common wealth.
                           Theſe were the words, which the King Archelaus anſwered the Grecian Knight, who reproued him becauſe he

had wept for the death of Euirpides the Philoſopher.
                           The ancient Hiſtoriographers can ſay no more, of the eſtimation which the Philoſophers and wiſe men had, A ſaying worthy obſeruation. as well the Greekes as the Latines: but I will tell you one thing worthy of noting. It is well knowne through all the world, that Scipio the Ethnicke, was one of the worthieſt that euer was in Rome: for by his name, and by his occaſion, Rome got ſuch a memory as ſhall endure.
                           And this was not only for that he conquered Affricke, but for the great worthineſſe of his perſon. Men ought not to eſteeme a little theſe two giftes in one man, that is to ſay to be happy and aduenturous: For many of the Auncients in times paſt wanne glory by their ſwords, and after loſt it by their euill liues. The Romane Hiſtoriographers ſay, that the firſt that wrote in Heroicall meeter in the Latine tongue, was Ennius the Poet, the workes of whom was ſo eſteemed of Scipio the Ethnick, that when this aduenturous and ſo luckie Romane dyed, he commaunded in his will and teſtament, that they ſhould hang the image of this Ennius the Poet ouer his graue.
                           By that the great Scipio did at his death, wee may well coniecture how great a friend he was of Sages in his life: ſince he had rather for his honour, ſee the Statue of Ennius on his graue: then the banner wherwith he wonne and conquered Affricke.
                           
                           In the time of Pirrus (which was King of the Epirotes, and great enemy of the Romanes) flouriſhed a Philoſopher named Cinas, borne in Theſſaly. who (as they ſay, was the Diſciple of Demoſthenes. The Hiſtoriographers at that time did ſo much eſteeme this Cinas, that they ſayde he was the Maſter and meaſure of mans eloquence: for he was very pleaſant in words and profound ſentences. This Cinas ſerued for three offices in the Palace of king Pirrus.
                           
                           1 Firſt he made paſtime at his Table in that hee did declare: for he had a good 
                              Sentences of Cinna. 
                              grace in things of laughter.
                           
                           2 Secondarily, he wrote the valiant deedes of his hiſtory: for in his ſtile hee had great cloquence, and to write the truth he was a witneſſe of ſight.
                           
                           3 Totrdly, he went for Ambaſſadouring at affayres of great importance: for he was naturally ſubtill and witty, and in diſpatching buſineſſe hee was very fortunate. He vſed ſo many meanes in his buſineſſe, and had ſo great perſwaſion in his words, that hee neuer tooke vpon him to ſpeake of things of warre: but eyther he ſet a long truce, or elſe hee made a perpetuall peace. The King Pirrus ſaide to this Cinas. O Cinas for 3. things I thanke to the immortall Gods.
                           
                           1 The firſt, for that they created mee a King, and not a ſeruant: for the greateſt good that mortall men haue, is to haue liberty to commaund many, and not bee bound to obey any,
                           
                           2 The ſecond, I thanke the immortal gods for that they naturally made mee ſtout of heart: for the man which with euery trifle is abaſhed, it were better for him to leaue his life.
                           
                           3 The third, I giue the immortall gods thanks for that in the gouernement of my commonwealth, and for the great affaires and buſines of my realme (as well in wars as in other things) they gaue me ſuch a man (as thou art) in my company: For by thy gentle ſpeech, I haue conquered and abtained many Cities, which by my cruell ſword I could neuer winne nor attaine. Theſe were the words which Pyrrus ſayd vnto his friend Cinas the Poet. Let euery Prince know now, how great louers of wiſe men thoſe were in times paſt: and as vpon a ſodaine I haue recited theſe few examples, ſo with ſmall ſtudy I haue heaped infinite Hiſtories.

                     CHAP. I, ¶ Of what excellencie Marriage is, and whereas common people marrie of free will, Princes and Noble-men ought to marry of neceſſitie.
                     
                     
                        AMong al the friendſhips &amp; companies of this life, there is none ſo naturall as that betweene the No loue comparable to that of man and wife. husband &amp; the wife liuing in one houſe: For all other companyes are cauſed by free will onely, but this proceedeth both by wil and neceſſitie. There is at this day no Lyon ſo fierce, no Serpent ſo venemous, no Viper ſo infectiue, no Aſpicke ſo mortall, neyther any beaſt ſo terrible, but at the leaſt both male and female do once in the yeare meete and conioyne: and although that in brute beaſts there lacketh reaſon, yet notwithſtanding they haue a natural inſtinction to aſſemble themſelues for the conſeruation of their kinde.
                     In this caſe men deſerue no leſſe reproch then Beaſts merite praiſe: For after that the Females by generation are bigge, they neuer agree that the Males ſhould accompanie with them. According to the diuerſity of Nations, ſo among thēſelues they differ the one from the other, in Lawes, Languages, Ceremonies, &amp; cuſtoms: but in the ende all agree in one thing, for that they enforce themſelues to celebrate marriage. As the Scripture teacheth vs, Since the world was created, there hath nothing bene more ancient, then the Sacrament of Marriage: For that day that Man was formed, the ſelfe ſame day he celebrated mariage with a Woman, in the terreſtriall Paradiſe.
                     
                     The ancient Hyſtoriographers (aſwell Greekes as Latines) wrote many great things in the praiſe of Mariage: but they could not ſay nor write ſo much, as continuall experience doth ſhew vs. Therfore leauing the ſuperfluous, Fiue things follow marriage. and taking the moſt neceſſary,

wee ſay that fiue commodities follow the Sage man, who hath taken the yoke of Matrimonie.
                     The firſt is, the memorie which remaineth to the children, as ſucceſſors and heyres of their Fathers. For as the Phyloſopher Pythagoras ſayeth: When a father paſſeth out of this preſent life, and leaueth behinde him a Childe being his Heyre, they cannot ſay vnto him that hee dyeth, but that he waxeth young in his Childe, ſince the child doth inherite the Fleſh, the Goods, and the memorie of the Father.
                     
                     Among the ancients it was a common prouerbe, that the taſte of all taſtes is Bread, the ſauour of all ſauours is Salt, and the greateſt loue of all Loues is from the Fathers to their children. And though perchaunce we ſee the Father ſhew ſome rigor to their children, we ought not therefore to ſay that they hate them, and deſpiſe them: for the tender loue of the Father to the Sonne is ſuch, that hee cannot endure him to doe any thing amiſſe, or worthy of rebuke. Not only The loue of the Father to the child. men of reaſon and brute beaſts, but alſo the Hedge and Garden-trees, to their poſſibilitie, procure to continue their kinde: and it is plainly ſeene, in that before the fruits and hearbs were formed to be eaten, the ſeeds and kirnels were made to be kept. Men naturally deſire honor in their life, and memorie after theyr death. Therefore (I ſay) that they come to honour by High, and Noble, and Heroycall facts, but the Memorie is left by the good and Legittimate children: For the children which are borne in adultrie, are begotten in ſinne, and with great care are nouriſhed.
                     
                     The ſecond benefit of Marriage is, that they auoyd adulterie, and it is no ſmall matter to auoyde this vice. For the Adulterers are not onely taken in the Chriſtian religion for offenders: but euen amongſt the Gentiles alſo, they are counted infamous.
                     The ſage Solon in the lawes that he gaue vnto the Athenians, commaunded vpon ſtreight precepts that they The ſaying of Solon. ſhould Marrie, to auoyde adulterie, vpon paine that the childe borne in adultrie, ſhould be made the common ſlaue of the Cittie. The Romanes (as men foreſeeing all things,) ordained in the tables of theyr Lawes, that the children which were born in adultery ſhould not be heyres of the Goods of theyr Fathers. When the Oratour Eſchynes was baniſhed out of Athens, as he came by the Rhodes, he tooke no ſuch pains in any one thing as he did in perſwading the Rhodians to marry, and not to liue in adulterie: For among thoſe barbarous, Matrimonie was not common, but onely among them which were Officers of the Commonwealth.
                     
                        Cicero in a familiar Epiſtle, ſaith: that the great Romaine Marcus Porcio, being gouernor in the Commonwealth, neuer agreed that an Vnckle of his ſhould bee maiſter of the Romain chiualry, vnleſſe he were marryed: which office was promiſed him by the Senate. His name was Rufus, a ſtout and valiant man of warre: this notwithſtanding Marcus Porcio ſaide, that that praiſe which Rufus deſerued for being valiant, and hardie: he loſt againe for liuing in adulterie. And that he would neuer graunt his voyce, nor bee in place where they committed any charge in the warres to a man that had not a lawfull wife.
                     I ſay therefore, that if the Gentiles and Infidels eſteemed Marriage ſo much, and deſpiſed the deedes of the adulterers ſo greatly: much more true Chriſtians ſhould be in this caſe warie and circumſpect. For the gentiles feared nothing but onely infamy: but all true Chriſtians ought to feare both infamie, and alſo paine. Since that of neceſsitie mans ſeede muſt increaſe,

and that wee ſee men ſuffer themſelues to bee ouercome with the fleſh: it were much better that they ſhould maintaine a good Houſhold, and liue vprightly with a wife, then to waſte theyr goods, and burden theyr conſcience with a Concubine. For it is oftentimes ſeene, that that which a Gentleman conſumeth abrode vpon an Harlot with ſhame, would keepe his Wife and Children at home with honeſtie.
                     The third commoditie of Marryage A third cō
                           modity of Marriage. is, the laudable and louing companie, the which is, or ought to bee betweene them that are Matryed: The anciēt Philophers defining what Man was, ſaide; That hee was a creature, the which by nature was ſociable communicable, &amp; reaſonable: wherof it followeth, that the man beeing ſolitarie and cloſe in his conditions, cannot bee in his ſtomacke but enuious. We that are men loue the good inclination, and doe alſo commend the ſame in beaſts: for all that the ſedicious man and the reſty horſe eate, wee thinke it euill ſpent. A ſad man, a ſole man, a man ſhut in, and ſolitary, what profite can hee doe to the people? For if euery man ſhould be locked vp in his houſe, the Commonwealth ſhould forthwith periſh.
                     My intention is to ſpeake againſt the Vacabonds, which without taking vpon them any craft or facultie, paſſe the age of fortie, of fiftie yeares, and would not, nor will not marrie yet, becauſe they would be vicious all the daies of their life. It is a great ſhame and conſcience to many men, that neuer determine with themſelues to take vpon them any eſtate, neyther to bee Marryed, chaſte, ſecular, or Eccleſiaſticall: but as the corke vpon the water they ſwimme, whether their Senſualitie leadeth them.
                     One of the moſt laudable and holy companyes which is in this life, is the companie of the Man and the Woman, in eſpeciallie if the woman bee vertuous: For the noble and vertuous wife withdraweth all the ſorowes from the heart of her Husband, and accompliſheth his deſires, whereby he liueth at reſt. When the wife is vertuous, and the husband wiſe, wee ought to belieue that betweene them two is the true loue: For the one not being ſuſpect with the other, and hauing childrē in the midſt, it is vnpoſſible but that they ſhould liue in concord. For all that I haue read &amp; ſeene, I would ſay, that if the mā &amp; the wife doe liue quietly together, a man may not only cal them good maried folks, (but alſo holy perſons) for to ſpeake the truth the yoke of matrimony is ſo great, that it cannot be accompliſhed without much merite. The contrarie ought and may be ſaid of thoſe which are euill marryed: whom we will not What inconenience ſo loueth them that are not maryed in the feare of the Lord. call a companie of Saintes, but rather a companie of diuells. For the wiſe that hath an euill husband, may ſay, ſhee hath a diuell in her houſe: and the Husband that hath an euill Wife, let him make account that hee hath a Hell it ſelfe in his houſe. For the euill wiues are worſe then infernall Furies. Becauſe in hell there are none tormented but the euill onely: but the euill woman tormenteth both the good and the euill.
                     Concluding therefore this matter, (I ſay alſo and affirme) that betwixt the Husband and the wife which are wel married, is the true and very loue: and they onely and no others, may be called perfit and perpetuall friends. The other Parents and Friendes, if they do loue and praiſe vs in our preſence, they hate and deſpiſe vs in our abſence. If they giue vs faire words, they beare vs euill hearts: Finallie, they loue vs in our proſperitie, and forſake vs in our aduerſitie: but it is not ſo amongſt the Noble and vertuous

married perſons: For they loue both within and without the houſe, in proſperity, and in aduerſitie, in pouertie and in riches, in abſence, and in preſence, ſeeing themſelues merrie, and perceyuing themſelues ſad: and if they doe it not, truely they ought to doe it: For when the Husband is troubled in his foote, the wife ought to be grieued at her heart.
                     The fourth commoditie of Marriage is, that the men and women marryed, The fourth commodity belonging to mariage. haue more authoritie and grauitie then the others. The lawes which were made in olde time in the fauour Marriage, were manie and diuers: For Capharoneus, in the lawes that hee gaue to the Egyptians, cōmanded and ordained vpon grieuous paines, that the man that was not maryed, ſhould not haue any office of gouernment in the Common-wealth. And he ſaide further, that hee that hath not learned to gouern his houſe, can euil gouerne a common-wealth.
                     According to the Lawes that hee gaue to the Athenians, hee perſwaded all thoſe of the Common-wealth to marry themſelues voluntarily: but to the heads and Captaines, which gouerne the affaires of warre, hee commaunded to marrie of neceſſitie, ſaying: That to men which are lecherous, God ſeldome giueth victoryes.
                     
                     
                        Lycurgus the renowmed gouernor and giuer of the lawes to the Lacedemonians, commaunded that all Captaines of the armyes, and the Prieſtes of the temples ſhould bee marryed: ſaying, That the ſacrifices of Marryed men were more acceptable to the Gods, 
                        The worthie ſayings of Lycurgus. 
                        then thoſe of any other. As Plinie ſaith, in an Epiſtle that hee ſent to Falconius his friend, rebuking him for that hee was not marryed: where he declareth that the Romaines in olde time had a law, that the Dictatour, and the Pretor, the Cenſour and the Queſtour, and all the Knights ſhould of neceſſity be marryed: For the man that hath not a wife and children Legitimate in his houſe, cannot haue nor hold great authoritie in the Common-wealth.
                     
                        Plutarche, in the booke that he made of the praiſe of Marriage, ſaith: that the Prieſts of the Romaines did not agree to them that were vnmarryed, to come and ſit downe in the temples: ſo that the young-Maydens prayed without at the Church dore, and the young men prayed on theyr knees in the Temple, onely the marryed men were permitted to ſit or ſtand.
                     
                        Plynie in an Epiſtle that hee wrote to Fabarus his father in law, ſaith, that the Emperor Auguſtus had a cuſtom, that he neuer ſuffered any yong man in his preſence to ſitte, nor permitted any man Marryed, to tell his tale on The prayſe of marriage foote. Plutarch, in the booke that hee made in the praiſe of women, ſaieth: that ſince the Realme of Corinth was peopled more with Batchelours then with Marryed men, they ordayned, amongſt them, that the man or woman that had not bene marryed, and alſo that had not kept Children and Houſe, (if they liued after a certaine age) after theyr deaths ſhould not be buryed.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II. ¶ The Authour following his purpoſe, declareth that by meanes of Marryage, many mortall enemies haue beene made good and perfite Friends.
                     
                     
                        BY ſundrie examples that we haue declared, and by all that which remaineth to declare, a man may knowe well enough, of what excellencie Matrimonie is: not onely for the charge of Conſcience, but alſo for the things touching

honour: for to ſay the truth, the men that in the Common-wealth are married, giue ſmall occaſion to bee ſlaundered, and haue more cauſe to be honourd. VVe cannot deny, but that Matrimony is trouble ſome and chargeable to them that be marryed for two cauſes: The one is, in bringing vp their children: and the other, The cares incident to ma
                              ••
                           age. in ſuffering the importunities of their Mothers. Yet in fine, we cannot deny, but that the good and vertuous wife is ſhee that ſetteth a ſtay in the houſe, and keepeth her husband in eſtimation in the Common-wealth: for in the publike affayres, they giue more faith and credite vnto thoſe that are charged with children, then vnto others that are loaden with yeeres.
                     The fifth commoditie that enſueth Matrimony, is the peace and reconciliations that are made betweene the enemies by meanes of Marriage. Men in this age are ſo couetous, ſo importune, and malicious, that there are very few but haue enemies, wherby groweth contention and debate: for by our weakneſſe we fall daily into a thouſand occaſions of enmities; and ſcarcely wee can finde one to bring vs againe into friendſhip. Conſidering what men deſire, what things they procure, and whereunto they aſpire, I maruell not that they haue ſo few friends: but I much muſe that they haue no more enemies. For in things of weight, they marke not who haue beene their friends, they conſider not they are their neighbours, neyther they regard that they are Chriſtians: but their conſcience laid a part, and honeſtie ſet a ſide, euery man ſeeketh for himſelfe and his own affayres, though it bee to the preiudice of all his neighbours. What friendſhippe can there bee amongſt proud men, ſince the one will goe before, and the other diſdayneth to come behinde? What friendſhippe can there bee amongſt enuious men, ſince the one purchaſeth, &amp; the other poſſeſſeth? VVhat loue can there be between two couetous men, ſince the one dare not ſpend, &amp; the other is neuer ſatisfied to hourd &amp; heap vp? For all that we can read, ſee, goe, and trauell, &amp; for all that we may do, we ſhall neuer ſee nor heare tell of men that haue lacked enemies: for either they be vicious or vertuous. If they be euil and vicious, they are alwaies hated of No man content with his owne eſtate. the good: and if they be good &amp; vertuous, they are continually perſecuted of the euill.
                     Many of the ancient Philoſophers ſpent a great part of their time, and loſt much of their goods, to ſearch for remedies and meanes to reconcile them that were at debate &amp; contention, and to make them by gentlenes good friends &amp; louers. Some ſaid that it was good &amp; profitable to forget the enmities for a time: for many things are pardoned in time, which by reaſō could neuer take end. Others ſaid that for to appeaſe the enemies it was good to offer mony, becauſe mony doth not only breake the feminate &amp; tender hearts, but alſo the hard and craggy rocks: others ſaid, that the beſt remedy was, to ſet good men to bee mediators between them, in eſpecially if they were ſage &amp; wiſe men: for the honeſt faces and ſtout hearts are aſhamed whē they are proſerred mony, &amp; the good do humble thēſelues by intreaty. Theſe means wel conſidered, and the remedies wel ſought out to make friends, there are none ſo ready and ſo true as Marriage: for the marriage done Sacramentally is of ſuch and ſo great excellency, that betweene ſome it cauſeth perfect friendſhippe, and betweene others it appeaſeth great iniuries.
                     During the time that Iulius Caeſar 
                        Marriage the cauſe of loue and amitie. kept him elfe as father-in-law to the great Pompeius, and that Pompeius
                        
held himſelfe his ſonne in law, there was neuer euill will nor quarells betweene them: but after that Pompeius was diuorced from the houſe of Caeſar, hatred, enuy, and enmities engendred betweene them, in ſuch ſort that they contended in ſuch, and ſo cruell warres, that Pompeius againſt his will loſt his head, and alſo Iulius Caeſar ſhortned his life. When thoſe that dwelled in Rome rauiſhed and robbed the daughters of the Sabines, i
                           •
                         after they had not changed their counſell, and of theeues to become husbands, without doubt the Romans bad beene all deſtroyed: for the Sabines had made an oath to aduenture both their goods and their liues, for to reuenge the iniuries done vnto them, their daughters and wiues: but by the meanes of Marriage they were conferred in great amitie and loue. For the Romanes receiued in marriage the daughters of the Sabines whome before they had rauiſhed. Greater enmitie there cannot be, then that of God towards men, through the ſin of Adam: notwithſtanding there neuer was, nor neuer ſhall be greater friendſhip then that, which was made by the godly marriage: and for greater authoritie to Mariage a meanes of Peace betweene God and man. confirme marriage, the Sonne of God would that his Mother ſhould be marryed; and afterward hee himſelfe was preſent at a Mariage, where hee turned the Water into Wine, though now adayes the euill maried men doe turne the wine into water. He doth not ſpeake here of Religious perſons, nor men of the Church, neither of thoſe which are cloſed in deuout places: for thoſe (fleeing the occaſions of the world, and chooſing the wayes leſſe dangerous) haue offered their ſoules to GOD, and with their bodies haue done him acceptable Sacrifices: for there is difference betweene the Religion of Chriſt, and the ſinfull Sinagogue of the Iewes; for they offered Kidds and Muttons, but heere are not offered but teares and ſighs. Leauing therefore all thoſe ſecrets apart which men ought to leaue to God: I ſay and affirme, that it is a holy and commendable counſell to vſe his profite with the Sacrament of Marriage, the which, though it bee taken of all voluntarily, yet Princes and great Lords ought to take it neceſſarily: For that Prince that hath no wife nor children ſhall haue in his Realme much grudging and diſpleaſure. Plutarch in the Booke hee made of Marriage ſayth, that amongſt the Lidians there was a law well obſerued and kept, that of neceſsitie their Kings and Gouernours ſhould be marryed; and they had ſuch reſpect to this thing, and were ſo circumſpect in this matter, that if a Prince dyed, and left his Heyre an infant, they would not ſuffer him to gouerne the Realme vntill he were married. And they greatly lamented the day of the departing of their Queene out of this life; for with her death the gouernment ceaſed, the Royall authoritie remayned voyde, and the Common-wealth without gouernment, ſo long time as the King deferred to take another wife: and ſo they 
                        What is required of euery vertuous Prince. 
                        were ſometimes without King or gouernment. For Princes are, or ought to be, the mirrour and example of all, to liue honeſt and temperate, the which cannot well bee done vnleſſe they bee marryed, or that they ſee themſelues to bee conquerors of the fleſh, and being ſo, they are ſatisfyed: but if they be not marryed, and the fleſh doth aſſault them, then they liue immediately conuered. Wherefore of neceſſitie they muſt goe by their Neighbours houſes, or elſe by ſome other diſhoneſt places, ſcattered abroad, to the reproach and diſhonor of them and their kindred: and oftentimes to the great perill and danger of their Perſons.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. III. Of ſundry and diuers Lawes which the Ancients had in Contracting Matrimony, not onely in the choyſe of Women, but alſo in the manner of celebrating Marriage.
                     
                     
                        IN all Nations, and in all the Realmes of the World, Marriage hath alwayes beene accepted, and marueilouſly commended: for otherwiſe the world had not beene peopled, nor yet the number of men multiplyed.
                     The ancients neuer diſagreed one from another in the approbation and acception of Marriage: but there was amongſt them great difference and ſtrife, vpon the contracts, ceremonies, and vſages of the ſame. For they vſed as much difference in contracting Matrimony, and chooſing their wiues: as theſe Epicures do deſire the varietie of ſundry delicate meates. The diuine Plato, in his Booke hee made of the Commonwealth, did counſell, that all thinges ſhould be common, and that not onely in bruit beaſts, in moueables, and heritages; but alſo that womē ſhould be common: for he ſayd, that if theſe two words, thine, and mine, were aboliſhed and out of vſe, there ſhould not bee debates nor quarels in this world. They cal Plato, Diuine for many good things which he ſpake: but now they may call him Worldly, for the counſel profane which he gaue. I cannot tell what beaſtlineſſe it may be called, nor what greater rudenes may be thought that the apparrell ſhould be proper, and the wiues common. The bruite beaſt doth not know that which came out of her belly, longer then it ſucketh of her breſts. And in this ſort it would chance to men, yea, and worſe too, if women were common in the Common-wealth: for though one ſhould know the Mother, which hath borne him, hee ſhould not know the Father, which hath begotten him. The Tharentines (which were wel renowmed amongſt the ancients, and A law among the Tharentines. not a little feared of the Romanes) had in their Citie of Tharente a law and cuſtome to marry themſelues with a legitimate wife, &amp; to beget children: but beſides her a man might yet chuſe two others for his ſecret pleaſures. Spartianus ſayd, that the Emperour Hellus Verus, as touching women, was very diſſolute: and ſince his wife was young and faire, and that ſhe did complaine of him, becauſe he led no honeſt life with her, hee ſpake theſe words vnto her: My wife, thou haſt no cauſe to complayne of me, ſince I remaine with thee vntill ſuch time as thou art quicke with childe: for the reſidue of the time, we husbands haue licence and priuiledge to ſeek our paſtimes with other women. For this name of a wife containeth in it honour: but for the reſidue, it is a grieuous burden and painefull office.
                     
                     The like matter came to Ptolomeus King of Egipt, of whom the Queene his wife did greatly complaine. Admit that all the Greekes haue beene eſteemed to bee very wiſe, amongſt all thoſe, the Athenians were eſteemed of moſt excellent vertue: for the Sages that gouerned the Commonwealth, remained in Athens with the Philoſophers which taught the Sciences. The Sages of Athens ordeyned A law among the Athenians. that all the neighbours and inhabitants might keepe two lawfull wiues, and furthermore, vpon paine of grieuous puniſhments, did commaund, that none ſhould preſume, nor be ſo hardy to maintain any concubine; for they ſayd, when men haunt the companie

of light women, comonly they miſuſe their lawfull Wiues. As Plutarch ſaith in his Politiques, the cauſe why the Greekes made this lawe was, conſidering that man could not, nor ought not to liue without the companie of a woman, and therefore they would that a man ſhould marrie with two wines. For if the one were diſeaſed and lay in, yet the other might ſerue in bed, waite at the Table, and doe other buſineſſes in the houſe.
                     Thoſe of Athens had another great reſpect and cōſideration to make this law, which was this, that if it chanced the one to be barren, the other ſhould bring forth children in the Commonwealth: and in ſuch caſe, ſhee that brought forth Children, ſhould be eſteemed for Miſtreſſe, and the other that was barren, ſhould be taken for a ſeruant.
                     When this law was made, Socrates was marryed to Xantippa, and to accompliſh the law, hee tooke another called Mirra, which was the daughter of the Phyloſopher Ariſtides: and ſith thoſe two women had great quarrells and debates together, and that thereby they ſlaundered their Neighbours, Socrates ſaide vnto them: My wiues, yee ſee right well that my eyes are hollow, my legges are withered, my hāds 
                        A worthie ſaying of Socrates. 
                        are wrinckled, my head is balde, my bodie is little, and the haires are white: Why doe yee then that are ſo faire, ſtand in contention and ſtrife for mee, that am ſo deformed? Though Socrates ſaide theſe wordes (as it were in ieaſt) yet ſuch words were occaſion, that the quarrells and ſtrifes betweene them ceaſed.
                     The Lacedemonians (than in the time of peace and warre, were always contrary to the Athenians) obſerued it for an inuiolable lawe, not that one man ſhould marry with two wiues, but that one woman ſhould marrie with two husbands: and the reaſon was, that when one Husband ſhould goe to the warre, the other ſhold tarry at home. For they ſaide, that a man in no wiſe ſhould agree to leaue his Wife alone in the common-wealth.
                     
                        Plinie writing an Epiſtle vnto his friend Locratius, and Saint Hierome, writing to a Frier called Ruſticus ſaith: That the Atbenians did vſe to marry Bretheren with the Siſters: but they did not permitte the Auntes to marrie with their Nephewes, neither the Vnckles with their Nieces. For they ſayd, that brothers and ſiſters to marrie together, was to marry with their ſemblables: but for vnckles to marry Nieces, &amp; Aunts with Nephews, was as of fathers to daughters, and of mothers to ſonnes.
                     
                        Melciades which was a man of great renowme amongſt the Grecians, had a ſonne called Cimonius, who was marryed to his owne ſiſter called Pinicea, and being demaunded of one why hee tooke his ſiſter in marriage: hee anſwered: My ſiſter is faire, ſage, rich, 
                        The ſpech of Cimonius. 
                        and made to my appetite, and her Father and mine did recommend her vnto mee: and ſince by the commaundement of the Gods, a man ought to accompliſh the beheſts and requeſts of Fathers, I haue determined (ſince Nature hath giuen mee her for my ſiſter) willingly to take her for my lawfull Wife.
                     
                     
                        Dyodorus Siculus ſaith, that before the Egiptians receyued any Lawes, euery man had as manie Wiues as hee would: and this was at the libertie of both partyes, for as much as if ſhe would goe, ſhee went liberally, and forſooke the man, and likewiſe hee left her when ſhee diſpleaſed him: For they ſayde that it was vnpoſſible for Men and Women to liue long together, without much trouble, contentions, and brawles.
                     
                        Dyodorus Siculus ſayde one thing, (where hee ſpeaketh of this matter,) which as yet I neuer read in any book,

nor heard of the ancients paſt, which was that amongſt the Egiptians there was no difference in Children: For they accounted them as legitimate, though they were children of ſlaues. For they ſaid, that the principall doer of the generation was the Father and not the mother, and that therfore the Children which were borne among them, tooke only the fleſh of the mother, but they did inherite their honour and dignitie of the part of the Father.
                     
                        Iulius Caeſar in his Commentaries ſaith, that (in Great Brittaine, now called England,) the Brittons had an vſe, that one Woman was marryed vnto fiue men, the which beaſtlineſſe is not read to haue beene in any Nation of times paſt: For if it bee ſlaunder for A beaſtly cuſtome in old time. in England. one man to haue diuers Wiues, why ſhould it not alſo bee a ſlaunderous and ſhamefull thing, for one woman to haue many Husbands? The noble and vertuous Women ought to bee marryed for two cauſes.
                     The firſt is, to the end God ſhould giue them children, and benediction, to whom they may leaue their goods, and their memorie. The ſecond, to the end they ſhould liue euery one in their owne houſe, accompanyed and honoured with their husbands. For otherwiſe (I ſay for a truth) that the woman that is not contented and ſatisfied with her own proper husband, will not bee contented nor ſatisfied, with all men in the world.
                     
                        Plutarch in his Apothegmes ſaith, that the Cymbres did vſe to marrie with their proper and natural daughters: the which cuſtome was taken from them by the Conſull Marius, after that hee did ouercome them in Germanie, and that of them he had triumphed at Rome. For the Childe which was borne of ſuch Marriage, was Sonne of the Daughter of one ſole Father, and was Sonne and Brother of one onely Mother, and they were alſo Couſins, Nephews, &amp; Brothers of one only Father and mother.
                     Truely ſuch cuſtome proceedeth rather of wilde beaſts, then of reaſonable creatures: For manie, or the more part of brute Beaſts, (after the females haue brought forth males) within one yeare after, they doo accompany with their dammes, which brought them forth.
                     
                        Strabo in the ſituation of the world, and Seneca in an Epiſtle, ſay: That the Lydes and the Armenians hadde a cuſtome, to ſend their Daughters to the Riuers and Hauens of the Sea, to get their Marriages, ſelling their bodyes to ſtraungers: ſo that thoſe which would Marrie, were firſt forced to ſell heyr virginitie.
                     
                     The Romaines (which in all their affaires and buſineſſes were more Sage and modeſt, then other Nations) vſed An ancient cuſtome among the Romains. much circumſpection in all their mariages: For they kept it as an ancient lawe, and vſe accuſtomed, that euery Romaine ſhould marrie with one woman, and no moe: For euen as to keepe two wiues among the Chriſtians, is a great charge of conſcience, ſo was it deemed amongſt the Romaines much infamie.
                     Amongſt the auncient and renowmed Orators of Rome, one was called Metellus Numidicus, the which one day making his Oration to the Senate, ſayd theſe words;
                     
                        Worthie Senatours, I let you vnderſtand, that I haue greatly fludyed what the counſels ſhuld be, that I ought to giue yee touching marriage? For the counſel raſhand ſudden, oftentimes is not profitable. I doe not perſwade you at all to marrie, neyther yet doe ſay that yee ſhall not marrie: but it is true, that if ye can liue without a woman, yee ſhall bee free from manie troubles. But what ſhall wee doe, O yea Romains? ſince that Nature hath made vs ſuch, that to keepe women
                        
                        it is a great trouble: and to liue without them, it is more danger? I dare ſay (if in this caſe my opinion might bee accepted) that it ſhould not bee euill done to reſiſt the luſt ſince it commeth by fits, and not to take Wiues, which are continuall troubles. Theſe were the wordes which Metellus Numidicus ſpake, the which were not very acceptable, nor pleaſant to the Fathers beeing in the Senate: for they would not that hee ſhould haue ſpoken ſuch wordes againſt Mariage. For there is no eſtate in this life, wherein Fortune ſheweth her force more, then in this ſtate of Matrimonie. A man may proue them in this ſort, that if the faſhions and vſages of the ancients were diuers, as concerning ordinance: truely there was no leſſe contrarietie in theyr contracts and ceremonies.
                     
                        Boccace the Florentine, in a Booke that he made of the Marriages of the auncients, reciteth manie and ſundrie cuſtoms, that they vſed in making the Marriages, whereof hee telleth ſome, not for to follow, or maintaine them: but to reproue and condemne them. For the writers did neuer write the vices of ſome, but onely to make the vertues of others more cleerely to be knowne.
                     The Cymbres had a cuſtome, that when they would Marrie, (after the A law among the Cymbrians. marriage was agreed vpon) hee that was made ſure ſhould pare his nayles, and ſend them to his wife that ſhould bee: and ſhe in like ſort ſent hers vnto him. And then when ſhe of him, and hee of her, had receyued the nayles the one of the other, they betooke themſelues Marryed for euer: and did afterwardes liue together, as man and wife.
                     The Theutonians had a ceremony, that the man that was ſure, rounded the hayre of her to whome hee was made ſure, and ſhee did the like vnto him: and when the one ſuffered the other to doe ſo, immediately they celebrated Marriage. The Armenians had a law, that the Bridegroom ſhuld pinch the right eare of the Bride, and the Bride ſhould likewiſe pinche the The law of the Armenians. left eare of the Bride-groome: and then they tooke themſelues marryed for euer.
                     The Elamites had a cuſtome, that both parties which were made ſure, pricked one the others little finger, vntill they bledde: the which bloud they did ſucke naturally, &amp; this done they were marryed. The Numidians vſed, that the Bryde-groome and the Bryde ſhould gather together a piece of Earth, and with theyr ſpittle they tempered it, and therewith the one annointed the forehead of the other: ſo that the Marriage betweene them, was to annoynt the one and the other with a little clay. When thoſe of Dace would be marryed, the Bride-groome and the Bryde, each one of themſelues, were brought in Charryots, the one meeting the other: and when they came together, the Bryde-groome gaue a newe name to the Bride, and ſhee likewiſe to him, and from that time forwardes they liued as in lawfull Matrimonie.
                     When they of Hungarie would marrie, the one ſent vnto the other a familiar A cuſtome among the Hungarians god made of ſiluer, whom they called Lares, and when they had receyued the God of each other, the marriage was finiſhed, and they liued as man and wife. The Siconians had a cuſtome and lawe, that when they ſhould marrie, the one ſent to the other a ſhooe: and that receyued of both, they agreed to the marriage.
                     The Tharentines had a cuſtome, that when they did marrie, they ſet themſelues at the table to eate, and the one did feed the other: ſo that if by miſhappe, the one ſhould chance to feed himſelfe, that marriage was not eſteemed for conſtant nor good.
                     
                        
The Scythians had a cuſtome, and they kept it as a law, that when men and women ſhould Marrie: as nowe they touch the hands the one of the other, ſo did they touch with their The cuſtom of the Scythians feete, afterwardes they ſet together their knees, then they touched with their hands, and then they ſet theyr buttocks together, and ſo their heads, and in the ende they embraced the one the other. All theſe ceremonies done, the Marriages were aſſured, and ſufficiently confirmed: and ſo we might ſay of manie others, but to auoyde tediouſnes, wee will follow our matter:
                  
                  
                     CHAP. IIII. How Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought to loue theyr Husbands, and that loue ought not by Coniurations and Enchauntments to be procured: but by wiſedome, honeſtie, and vertue deſired.
                     
                     
                        ALl men that deſire to atchieue and obtayne anie worthie thing in this life, inuent and ſearch manie meanes to come thervnto: for men by good prouiſion and circumſpection compaſſe ſundrie things, which otherwiſe they ſhould loſe: vnleſſe they would by force take them. As in the marriages of our Chriſtian Religion, wherein wee doe not ſuffer, that the man and the wife be parents, and nigh of bloud: leauing apart that the one is a man, and the other a woman: that the one is ſtrong, and the other weake: oft times it chaunceth, that there is betweene the man and the wife more contrariety in conditions, then diuerſitie in Linage: I would ſay therefore (for healthfull counſell, and neceſſarie aduiſe) to the great Dames, and Princeſſes, and to all other wiues, ſince they muſt needs eate and drinke with their husbands, that they muſt ſleepe, treate, bee conuerſant, Good counſell for all ſorts of women. and talke, and finally, liue and dye with theyr Husbands, that they vſe much diligēce to beare with their conditions: For to ſay the troth, the wife ought in all things to follow the conditions of her husband: and the husband in ſome things to beare with the conditions of his wife. So that ſhee by her patience, ought to ſuffer the imperfections of him, and he likewiſe by his wiſdome ought to diſſemble the importunities of her: and in ſuch ſort they ought to agree &amp; loue together, that all thoſe of the Common-wealth ſhould reioyce at theyr behauiors. For marryed men, which are quarrellers and ſeditious perſons, the Neighbours in ſtead of weeping and wayling, for the depriuation of their life, demaund gifts the one of the other, for bringing newes of their death. Admit that the Husband be couetous, and vnthrifty, that he be deformed in his bodie, that hee be rude in condition, baſe of linage, raſh in his ſpeech, in aduerſities fearefull, in proſperities careleſſe, in the ende being (as he is) Husband, we cannot denie, but in the houſe he ought to bee chiefe maiſter. For the which it is alſo neceſſarie, that wee giue now vnto rhe Wiues ſome healthfull counſell, whereby they may beare and ſuffer quietly ſuch great troubles. For at this day there is no Husband ſo louing, nor ſo vertuous, in whome the wife ſhall not finde ſome euill conditions.
                     Firſt of all, wiues ought to endeuor themſelues to loue their husbands vnfamedly, if they deſire their husbands ſhould loue them without diſsimulation: for as we ſee by experience, Mariage is ſeldome broken through pouertie, nor yet continued with riches.

For the euill marryed folkes through debate and ſtrife, be ſeparated in one week, wheras by good &amp; tru loue they are preſerued al the daies of their life.
                     To eate drie and vnſauory meates, they vſe to take ſalt for to amend it. I meane that the burdens of matrimonie are many, and troubleſome, the which all with loue onely may be endured. For as Plato the diuine Phyloſopher ſayeth: One thing ought not to bee called more painefull then another for the labour we therevnto employbut for the great or ſmal loue that therevnto wee haue. Though ſome ſundrie things bee troubleſome and tedious, yet when with loue it is begunne, it is eaſily followed, and ioyfully atchieued: For that trauell is nothing noyſome, where loue is the mediator.
                     
                     I know right well and doe confeſſe, that the counſell which I giue to women is ſharpe, that is: for an honeſt woman to loue a diſſolute man, for a ſage wife to loue a fooliſh husbād, for a vertuous wife, to loue a vitious husband. Women bound to loue their Husbands. For as daily experience ſheweth, there are ſome men of ſo fooliſh conditions, and other women of ſo noble conuerſation, that by reaſon apparent they ought to take them for Miſtreſſes, rather then they ſhould accept them for Husbands.
                     Although this, in ſome particular caſes is true, I ſay and affirme, that generally, all women are bound to loue their Husbands, ſince that willingly, and not by compulſion they were not enforced to take them: For in like manner, if the Marryage pleaſed not the Woman, ſhee hath not ſo much cauſe to complaine of her Husband, for asking her: as ſhe hath reaſon to complaine of her owne ſelfe, that accepted him. For the misfortunes that by our owne follie doe chaunce, although we haue cauſe to lament them, wee ought alſo to haue reaſon to diſſemble them. Bee the man neuer ſo wilde and euil brought vp, it is impoſſible, if the wife loue him, but he muſt needs loue her againe. And though perchaunce hee cannot force his euill conditions to loue her, yet at the leaſt he ſhall haue no occaſion to hate her. The which ought not to bee little eſteemed: For there are many wiues not onely of the Plebeians, but alſo of the noble Dames, that could be content to forgiue their Husbands all the pleaſures they ſhould doe them, and alſo all the loue that they ought to ſhewe: if they would refraine theyr Tongues, from ſpeaking iniurious wordes, and keepe their hands from dealing lothſome ſtripes. We haue many notable examples in hyſtories, of mane Noble and ſtoute Ladyes (as well Greekes as Romaines:) which after The tongue cauſe of debate. they were marryed, had ſo great faithfulnes, and bare ſuch loyaltie to their husbands, that they not onely followed them in their trauells, but alſo deliuered them in their dangers.
                     
                        Plutarch in the booke of the noble women, declareth, that the Lacedemonians, keeping many Nobles of the Athenians priſoners (which at that time were their cruell &amp; mortall enemies) and being iudged to die, their wiues concluded to goe to the priſon where they lay, and in the end they obtained The loue of women towards theyr Husbands. of the Gayler therof, that they might goe in, and talke with their husbands: for indeed the teares were manie, that were ſhed, and the gifts were not few which vnto them were offered. The Wiues therfore entring into the priſon, did not onely change their apparell with their Husbands, but alſo the liberty of their perſons: for they went out as women, &amp; the women in their ſteads, remained there as men. And when they brought out theſe Innocent wiues from priſon, to execute iuſtice, ſuppoſing they were men, the Lacedemonians vnderſtāding the faith fulnes of the women, determiued that

they ſhould not onely bee pardoned, but alſo that they ſhould bee greatly rewarded and honored, for the good examples of other women to whom they were marryed. The ancient and great renowmed Panthea, when newes was brought her that her husband was dead in battaile, ſhee her owne ſelfe determined to goe ſeeke him out, with hope, that as yet he was not vtterly dead; and finding him dead, with the bloud of him ſhe waſhed all her body, and likewiſe her face, ſtrikeing with a knife her ſelfe to the heart, and imbracing her husband, ſhe yeelded vp the ghoſt, and ſo together they were carried to the graue. Porcia, 
                        The praiſe of Women. the daughter of Marcus Porcia the great, when ſhee heard that her huſband Brutus was taken and ſlaine, ſhe felt for that newes ſo great ſorrow, that all her friends ſeeing her take the matter ſo grieuouſly, hid from her all Iron wherewith ſhee might kill her ſelfe: and did labour to keep and preſerue her from danger, wherein ſhee might fall and ſhorten her life. For ſhe was ſo excellent a Romane, and ſo neceſſary to the Common-wealth, that if they had lamented the death of Brutus her husband, with teares of their eyes, they ought to bewaile the loſſe of his wife Porcia, with drops of bloud in their hearts. Porcia therefore feeling in her ſelfe a wofull and afflicted heart, for the death of her entirely beloued husband, to declare that that which ſhee did was nor fayned, nor for to pleaſe the people, but to ſatisfie her great and maruellous loue: ſince ſhee found neyther ſword nor knife to kill her ſelfe, nor cord to hang her ſelfe, neither well to drowne her in, ſhe went to the fire, and with as great pleaſure did eate the hot fiery coales, as an other would haue eaten any delicate meates. We may ſay that ſuch kinde of death was very ſtrange and new, which the Romane found to encreaſe, augment, and manifeſt her loue: Yet wee cannot deny, but that ſhee wanne to the poſteritie of her name a perpetuall memorie: For as a Noble Dame ſhe would quench with coales of fire her burning heart, that enflamed was with fiery brands of loue. As Diodorus Seculus ſayth, it was a law and cuſtome amongſt the Lidians, 
                        The Law amongſt the Lidians to marry themſelues with many wiues: and when by chance their huſbands dyed, the wiues which they had, met together, and fought in ſome plaine place. And the women which remained onely aliue, and of the conflict had the victory, caſt themſelues into the graue of their husband: ſo that thoſe women then fought for to dye, as men now fight for to liue.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. V. Of the reuenge a woman of Greece tooke of him that had killed her husband, in hope to haue her in marriage.
                     
                     
                        
                           PLutarch in the Booke that he made of the Noble and worthy Women, declareth a thing worthy of rchearſall, and to be had in memory.
                     In the Citie of Galacia were two renowmed Citizens, whoſe names were Sinatus and Sinoris, which were by bloud Couſins, and in familiaritie friends: and for the loue of a Greekes daughter, being very Noble, beautifull, and exceeding gracious, they both ſtriued to haue her in marriage: and for to attaine to their deſires, they both ſerued her, they both followed her, they both loued her, and for her, both of them deſired to dye. For the dart of loue is as a ſtroke with a clod of earth, the which being throwne amongſt a company, doth hurt the

one, and blinde the others. And as the fatal deſtinies had ordained it: Sinatus ſerued this Lady called Camma in 
                           •
                        uch ſort, that in the end he obtained her in marriage for his lawfull wife: which thing when Sinoris perceiued, he was aſhamed of his doings, and was alſo wounded in his hart. For he loſt not onely that, which of ſo long time he had ſought, loued, and ſerued: but alſo the hope to attaine to that, which chiefly in his life he deſired. Sinatus therefore ſeeing that his wife Camma was noble, meeke, gratious, faire, and louing, and that in all things ſhee was comely and well taught: decreed to offer her to the Goddeſſe Diana, to the end that ſhee would preſerue her from perill, and keepe her from infamie. Truly we cā
                        not reproue the knight Sinatus for that hee did, nor wee ought to note him for raſh in his councell: for hee ſawe that his wife was very faire, and therefore much deſired. For with great difficultie that is kept, which of many is deſired. Though Camma was The loue of Sinoris &amp; Comma now maryed and that ſhee was in the protection of the goddeſſe Diana: yet notwithſtanding her olde friend Sinoris died for her ſake, and by all means poſſible he ſerued her, continually he importuned her, dayly he followed her, and hourely he required her. And all this he did, vpon certaine hope he had, that ſuch diligent ſeruice ſhould ſuffice to make her change her ſacred minde: and as ſhee had choſen Sinatus for her husbande openly, ſo hee thought ſhe ſhould take him for her friende ſecretly. For many women are as men without taſt through ſicknes, the which eate more of that that is hurtfull and forbiddē: then of that which is healthſome, and commaunded. Not without a cauſe Camma was greatly renowmed throughout al Galatia for her beauty: and much more amonge the vertuous eſteemed for her honeſtie.
The which euidently in this was ſeene, that after ſhe was married, Sinoris could neuer cauſe her to receiue any Iewell, How good women ought to behaue themſelues. or other gift, nor that ſhe would hear him ſpeake any word, nor that ſhee would ſhew her ſelfe in the window, eyther to him, or to any other, to the end to bee ſeene in the face. For it is not ſufficient for Ladyes to bee pure good; but alſo to giue no occaſion for men to iudge (that if they durſt) they would be euill. As it is true indeede, that the heart which is entangled with loue, dare boldly aduenture himſelfe in many kinde of dangers to accompliſh that which he deſired: ſo Sinoris ſeeing that with fayre words he could not flatter her, nor with any gifts winne her, determined to kill Sinatus her husband, vpon hope, that when ſhe ſhould be widdow, he might eaſily obtaine her in matrimony. For he thought, although Camma was not euill, it was not for that ſhe wanted deſire to doe it, but becauſe ſhe had no commodious place to accompliſh it. And, to be ſhort, Sinoris would needes execute and bring to effect his deuiliſh and damnable entent: ſo that ſoone after hee vilely ſlew his ſaid companion Sinatus. After whoſe death the Noble Lady Camma was of Sinoris greatly deſired, and by his Parents much importuned, that ſhe would condiſcend to take and marry him, and that ſhe would forgiue him the death of her husband Sinatus, which then was buried. And as ſhe was in all her doings ſuch a Princely woman, ſhe imagined with her ſelfe, that vnper the pretence of marriage, ſhe might haue oportunitie to accompliſh her deſires: wherfore ſhee anſwered vnto his Parents, that ſhee did accept their counſell; and ſaid to Sinoris, that ſhe did chuſe him for her husband, ſpeaking theſe words more for to comfort him, then

with intent to pardon him. And as amongſt thoſe of Galatia there was a cuſtome, that the new maried folkes ſhould eate together in one diſhe, and drinke in one cup: the day that the mariage was celebrated, Cāma determined to prepare a cup with poyſon, and alſſo a lute, wherewith ſhee began to play, and ſing with her prober voyce before the Goddeſſe Diana in this manner.

                           With wailfull end to wreke Sinatus death.

                        With tender loue whom I haue waide ſo deere:
                        Since he by fate is reſt from fortunes raine,
                        For whoſe decay I dreadleſſe periſh here.
                     
                     
                        Since him by whom my onely life I led,
                        Through wretched hands the gaping earth now haue:

                        But cloſde with him together in the graue.

                           Since he is graude where greedy wormes now bee,
                        
                        
                           And I ſuruiue ſurmounted with my fone.

                           And I thus chargde with flame of frozen care:
                        
                        
                           Thou knowſt Dian, how hard with reſtles toyle

                        For how can this vnquiet breſt reſerue,
                        The fainting breth that ſtriues to draw his laſt:
                        Since that euen then, my dying heart did ſtarue,
                        When my dead Phere in ſwallowing earth was caſt.

                           By cruell ſworde my life I thought to ſpend:
                        
                        
                           And ſince a thouſand times I thought to haue,
                        
                        
                           A ſtretched cord my ſorrowes wrath to end.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           And if till now to waſte my pining dayes,
                        
                        I haue deferde by ſlaughter of my hand:
                        
                        
                           It was but loe, a fitter cauſe to raiſe,
                        
                        
                           Whereon his ſharpe reuenge might iuſtly ſtand.

                        With gladſome minde he trayned was to ſpend,
                        Since that his youth, which ſlippeth loe by ſtealth,
                        To waite on me he freely did commend.
                     
                     
                        Since he ſuch heapes of lingring harmes did waſte,

                     ANd when the prayer was ended, that this fayre and vertuous Camma 
                        The death of Sinoris and Camma. made, ſhee dranke, and gaue to drinke to Sinoris of this cuppe of poyſon, who thought to drinke no other but good wine and water: and the caſe was ſuch, that he died at noone daies, and ſhe likewiſe in the euening after. And truely, her death of all Greece, with as great ſorrow, was lamented: as her life of all men was deſired.
                     Princeſſes and great Ladyes may moſt euidently perceiue by the examples heerein contayned, how honeſt and Honourable it is for them to loue and endeauour themſelues to be beloued of their husbands: and that not onely in their life, but alſo after their death: For, the wife to ſerue her husband in his life, ſeemeth ofttimes to proceede of feare: but to loue and honour him in his graue, proceedeth of loue. Princeſſes and great Ladies ought not to do that which many other women of the cōmon people do, that is to ſay, to ſeeke ſome drinkes, and inuent ſome ſhamefull ſorceries to be beloued of their husbands: for albeit it is a great burden of conſcience, and lacke of ſhame in like manner to vſe ſuch ſuperſtitions; yet it ſhould be a thing too vniuſt, and very ſlaunderous, that for to be beloued of their husbands, they ſhould procure to be hated of God. Truely, to loue, to ſerue, and content God, it is not hurtful to the woman, for that ſhe ſhould bee the better beloued of her husband: but yet God hath ſuffered, and doth permit oftimes, that the women being feeble, deformed, poore, and negligent, ſhould bee better beloued of their husbands, then the diligent, fayre and rich. And this is not for the ſeruices they doe to their huſbands, but for the good intention they haue to ſerue and loue GOD, which ſheweth them this ſpeciall fauour: for otherwiſe God doth not ſuffer, that he being with her diſpleaſed, ſhe ſhould liue with her husband contented. If womē would take this counſel that I giue them in this caſe, I will teach them furthermore a notable enchauntment, to obtayne the loue of their husbands, which is, that they bee quiet, meeke, patient, ſolitary, and honeſt, with which fine

herbes they may make a confection, the which neither ſeene nor taſted of Good coū

                     CHAP. VI. That Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought to be obedient to their Husbands; and that it is a great ſhame to the Husband that his wife ſhould command him.
                     
                     
                        MAny ancient Hiſtoriographers trauailed greatly, &amp; conſumed long time in writng, to declare what authoritie the man ought to haue ouer the woman, and what ſeruitude the woman oweth to the man: and ſome, for to aduance the dignitie of the man, and others to excuſe the frailtie of the woman, alleadged ſuch vaine things, that it had beene more honour for them not to haue written at all, then in ſuch ſort as they did: for it is not poſſible but the Writers ſhould erre, which write not as reaſon teacheth, but rather as their fantaſie leadeth.
                     Thoſe that defend the frailtie of the woman ſayd, that the woman hath a body as a man, ſhe hath a ſoule as a man, ſhee hath reaſon as a man, dyeth as a man, and was as neceſſary for generation as man, ſhe liueth as a man, and therefore they thought it not meete that ſhee ſhould bee more ſubiect to man, then man to her: for it is not reaſon that that which nature hath made free, ſhould by any lawes of man be made bond. They ſaid furthermore, that God created not the creatures, but to augment the generation of mankinde, and that in this caſe the woman was more neceſſarie then the man: for the man engendereth without paine or trauaile, but the woman is deliuered with perill and danger, and with paine and trauaile nouriſheth vp the childe. Wherefore it ſeemeth great vnkindneſſe and crueltie, The great dangers women ſuſtaine. that the women (which are deliuered with perill and danger of their liues, and bring vp their children with labour and toyle of their bodies) ſhould bee vſed of their husbands as ſlaues.
                     They ſayd further, that men are thoſe that curſe, that moue ſeditions, that make warres, that maintaine enmitie, that weare weapons, that ſhed mans bloud, and commit ſundry other miſchiefes, which the women do not: but in ſtead of killing men, ſhedding bloud, and other notorious euils, that men do, they imploy themſelues to encreaſe men. And ſince it is ſo, then women, rather then men, ought to haue dominion and command in the Common-wealth: for women increaſe the Cōmon-wealth, and men diminiſh it: for neyther diuine nor humane law commaundeth, that the fooliſh man ſhould bee free, and gouerne: and that the wiſe woman ſhould bee bond, and ſerue.
                     Thoſe of Achaia affirmed this opinion, and groundeth themſelues vpon The cuſtome of the Achaians. this reaſon, and obſerued it as a cuſtome, That the husbands ſhould obey, and the wiues commaund. And ſo they did, as Plutarch ſayth in the Booke of Conſolation: for the huſband ſwept &amp; made cleane the houſe, made the bed, waſhed the buck, couered the table, dreſſed the dinner, and went for water: And of the contrary part, his wife gouerned the goods, anſwered the affayres, kept the money; and if ſhee were angry, ſhee gaue him not onely foule words,

but alſo oftimes laid her hands on him to reuenge her anger. And heereof came this ancient Prouerb, the which of many is read, and of few vnderſtood: that is to ſay, Vita Achaiae; The life of an Achaian. When in Rome the husband ſuffered to be ruled and commanded of his wife, the neighbours would ſay vnto him in manner of a reproach, Vita Achaia: which is as much as if a man would ſay, Goe, goe as thou art, ſince thou liueſt after the law of Achaia, where men haue ſo little diſcretion, that they ſuffer themſelues to bee gouerned (bee it well or euill) of their Wiues, and that euery woman commandeth her Husband.
                     
                     
                        Plinie, in an Epiſtle that hee wrote, reprooued greatly his friend Fabatus, for that hee kept in his houſe a wife, the which in all his doings ruled and commanded him: wherein hee told him, that hee durſt doe nothing without her commaundement. And to make the matter to ſeeme more heynous, in the latter ende of his Epiſtle he ſayd theſe words, Me valde poenitet quod tu ſolus Rome polles vita Achaia: which is, It grieueth mee much, that thou alone in Rome ſhouldeſt leade the life of one of Achaia.
                     
                        Iulius Capitolinus ſaith, that Anthonius Caracalla, being in loue with a faire Lady of Perſia, and ſeeing that he could not enioy her, nor obtayne his deſire, promiſed to marrie her according to the law of Achaia: and truly ſhee ſhewed her ſelfe more wiſe in her anſwere, then hee did in his demand, telling him, that ſhee would not, nor might not marry; for becauſe ſhee had promiſed her ſelfe to the goddeſſe Veſta, and that ſhe had rather be a ſeruant of the gods, then a Miſtreſſe of men. The Parthes had The Law of the Parthians. a law contrary to them, and likewiſe thoſe of Thrace, the which ſo little eſteemed women, that their husbands vſed them none otherwiſe then like ſeruants. And in this caſe men had ſo great liberty, or to ſay better, lightneſſe, that after a woman had borne and brought foorth twelue children, the children remained in the houſe, and the husbands ſold their wiues to them that would giue moſt, or elſe they changed them for others that were more young.
                     And the children agreed to the ſelling of their owne mother, to the intent that their father might refreſh himſelfe with another that was more young: and the olde and barren woman, ſhould eyther be buried quicke, or elſe ſerue as a ſlaue.
                     
                        Dioniſius Halicarnaſeus ſaith, that the Lides had a law, and the Numiaians in like manner, that the woman The Law of the Lideans ſhould command things without the houſe, and the man ſhould prouide for thoſe that were within: but according to my poore iudgement, I cannot tell how this law was kept, nor how they could fulfill it; for by reaſon, the wife ſhould not goe out of the houſe but very little: and therefore me thinks that they ought not to command any thing abroad, nor the husband ſhould enter into an other mans houſe, for to commaund there.
                     
                        Licurgus in the lawes that hee gaue to the Lacedemonians ſaith, that the husbands ſhould prouide abroad, ſee all things neceſſary for the houſe: and that the wiues ſhould keepe and diſpoſe them within: So that this good Philoſopher deuided the trauaile betweene the man and the woman: but yet notwithſtanding hee reſerued the rule and authoritie to the man: For to ſay the truth, it is a monſtrons thing that the wife ſhould command the husband in his houſe.
                     Vnder our Chriſtian Religion there is neyther Diuine, nor humaine Lawes, but will preferre Man aboue all other thinges: and

though ſome Philoſophers would diſpute to the contrary, and that many men would haue followed them, yet mee thinkes that a man ſhould not praiſe nor commend them for their opinions: for there can bee nothing more vaine nor light, then by mans law to giue that authoritie to woman, which by nature is denyed her.
                     We ſee by experience, that women Women weake of nature. of nature are all weake, fraile, fearefull, and tender: and finally, in matters of weight not very wiſe. Then if matters of gouernment require not onely ſcience and experience, but alſo ſtrength and courage to enterpriſe doubtfull things, wiſedome for to know them, force to execute them, diligence for to follow them, patience for to ſuffer them, meanes to endure them: and aboue all, great ſtrength and hope to compaſſe them: why then will they take from man the gouernment, in whom all theſe things abound, and giue it to the woman, in whome all theſe things doe want? The end why I ſpeake theſe thinges before, is to require, to counſell, to admoniſh, and to perſwade Princcſſes and great Ladies, that they thinke it ſpoken (if they will be happy in marriage) to the end they ſhould be obedient to their husbands: for ſpeaking the truth, in that houſe, where the wife commaundeth the husband, we may call her a maſculine woman, and him a feminine man.
                     Many women are deceiued, in thinking, that in commanding their huſbands they liue more honourably, and be better eſteemed: but truely it is not ſo; for all thoſe that ſee, and perceiue it, accounteth the woman for vaine, and the man in like manner for fooliſh The fooliſh opinion of ſome women..
                     I know, and can tell right well, that there are ſome husbands ſo exceſſiue in ſpending, and ſo wanton in liuing, that it were not onely good that their wiues ſhould rule thē, but alſo chaſtiſe them: but in the end, I ſay, that notwithſtanding all this, it is better, and more tollerable, that all the goods be loſt, then betweene them any malice, hate or diſcention ſhould riſe. If a womans children dye, ſhee may bring foorth others: if ſhe loſe her goods, ſhe may get them agayne: if her ſeruants goe from her ſhee may finde others: if ſhe ſee her ſelfe ſad, GOD may comfort her: if ſhe be ſicke, ſhe may be healed: but if ſhee bee at debate with her husband, I cannot tell what ſhe ſhall doe: for the wife that forſaketh the friendſhippe of her huſband, giueth to all men occaſion to ſpeake of her folly.
                     Sith women naturally are all iealous, and that of iealouſie proceedeth ſuſpition, I counſell them, if they will not that their husbands commit a fault, that they doe not anger nor chafe them; for if in gage ſhe haue his heart, no other woman ſhall haue his body, from that which hee would not abſtaine for conſcience, he will reſtraine for ſhame.
                     Oftentimes the husbands come home chafed, troubled, wrathfull, angry, and vexed, and then women ought to take heede that they ouerthwart them not; for if they doe, it cannot bee otherwiſe, but that they ſhall haue eyther euill words with his tongue, or elſe ſuffer ſore blowes with his fiſts. Truely it is not meete, neither in any caſe profitable, that Princeſſes and great Dames ſhould ouerthwart their husbands with froward words, nor that they ſhould vſe to ſtriue againſt them; but rather that the wiſe in all caſes ſhould be obedient and louing to her husband: for it may happen, &amp; daily it doth chance, that they begin to argue in ieſt, and afterward they ende in earneſt. The woman which is ſage, wiſe, &amp; vertuous, ought to weigh with her ſelfe, that eyther

her Husband hath occaſion ſo to taunte her, or elſe peraduenture hee doeth it of a will. I ſay that in this caſe if hee haue occaſion, ſhee ought to ſuffer and endure him: if he doth it of will, ſhe ought to diſſemble with him. For otherwiſe, it might ſo take her in the head, that ſhee would burden him with many euill wordes: ſo that hee beginning, then the debate ſhould remaine excuſed, and ſhee being without fault at the beginning, might in the end be condemned.
                     There is nothing wherein a Woman ſheweth her, wiſdome more then to endure a raſhe Husband. A Woman in nothing ſheweth her ſagenes more, then to diſſemble with a fooliſh Husband. Her honeſtie in nothing can bee ſhewed more, then in ſuffering a wanton Husband. Shee can ſhewe her worthineſſe in nothing ſo much, as in bearing with an vnworthie Husband. I meane, though ſhee vnderſtood that her husband hath little, that he knoweth little, and that he were worth little: yet ſhee ſhould make men belieue that he hath much, that he knoweth enough, and can do A propertie of a wiſe &amp; diſcreete Husband. much. For all the honour which ſhe ſhall ſo giue to her Husband, ſhall wholly againe redounde on her ſelfe.
                     It is an euill thing (mee thinketh) that Women ſhould be ſo bolde to ſpeake againſt their Husbands: For they cannot ſpeake euill of them, but that they muſt witneſſe diſhonour of themſelues. For if her Husband be a drunkard, they will ſay that ſhee is a drunkard wife: and if he be a foole, then ſhe is the wife of a Foole, and what more? When the Husband ſhall come to amend, and to moderate himſelfe, the woman in the ende ſhalbe blamed. For if ſhe burden him with euill wordes, hee acquiteth her with ſharpe ſtripes. But if ſhee toucheth his honour, it may chaunce he taketh away her life. If perhaps the Husband ſhould commaund the wife any vniuſt thing, I would be of opinion that ſhe ſhould obey him, but not reſiſt him: and after that his raging furie were paſt, and his choller qualilified, then ſhee might ſay vnto him, that he was very raſh to command, &amp; ſhe very wiſe to obey. For if ſhee be quicke of tongue to anſwere to euery worde that hee ſhall ſpeake, without doubt they wil not liue one day in cō
                        cord: Reading therefore that which I haue read, hearing that which I haue hearde, and hauing ſeene alſo that I haue ſeene, I would counſell women that they ſhould not preſume to commaund Good counſell for Women. their Husbands: and I would admoniſh Husbands that they would not ſuffer their Wiues to rule them; For in doing the contrarie, it is none otherwiſe, then to eate with the feete, and trauel with the hands, to go with the fingers, and to feede themſelues with their toes.
                     My minde is not heere to ſpeake againſt the womē, nor againſt the Princeſſes and great Ladies, which of their patrimonie and heritage poſſeſſe manie Townes and Citties: for to ſuch I wil not take away the ſeruices, which are due vnto them by their Subiects, but I doe perſwade them to the obedience which they ought to beare to theyr Husbandes. It is not maruell, though that women of meane eſtate haue ſometimes quarrelled with their Husbands: For they haue ſmall Riches to looſe, and leſſe honour to aduenture, then the Princeſſes and great Dames haue, the which ſince they do aduenture to commaund manie: why wil not they humble themſelues to obey one? ſpeaking with due reuerēce.
                     It is for aboundance of follie, and want of wiſedome, that a Woman ſhould haue preſumption to gouerne a whole Realm, and that ſhe hath not grace to obey one Husband.
                     
                        Seneca in a Tragedie, ſaieth thus:

that in the time of the warre of Mithridates, it chanced in Rome that the Conſulls ſent to the olde Knightes, and commanded that they ſhould all be in a readineſſe to go with Silla the The ſaying of 
                              〈…〉
                           . Conſull into the warres. And it happened, that when they came into ones houſe in Rome to publiſh the Edict, to warne him to bee ready, they found not the husband, but the wife, who made anſwere, and ſayd, That her husband ought not, nor could not goe to the warres; and though hee would, hee ſhould not, neither would ſee giue him licence: for hee was an old and ancient Knight, and therefore hee ought to be exempted from the warres.
                     With this anſwer, thoſe that heard it were greatly abaſhed, and the whole Senate no leſſe offended: wherefore they commaunded, that the husband ſhould bee baniſhed Rome, and the wife to bee carryed to the Priſon Mamortine, not for that he excuſed himſelfe for going to the warres: but becauſe ſhe commanded her husband, and becauſe he ſuffered himſelfe to be commanded of her.
                     The Senate did this, to that end, that from that time forwards no woman ſhould preſume or contend with her husband: and that no husband ſhould giue his wife any occaſion to be bold with him.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VII. That Women, and eſpecially Princeſſes and great Ladyes, ſhould be very circumſpect in going abroad out of their houſes, and that through the reſort of them that commeth to their houſes, they bee not euill ſpokenof.
                     
                     
                        AMong all the counſels that may or ought to be giuen to Princeſſes and great Ladies, this is the firſt; that they do what they can to haue reſt in their houſes, and that they goe not as ſtrayes to the manſions of other men: for if ſuch Ladyes are good, they get much reputation; and if perchance they bee euill, they take from men all occaſion. Whether the huſband be preſent or abſent, it is a moſt neceſſary and honeſt thing that the wife be for the moſt part in the houſe: for by this meanes the houſehold ſhal be well gouerned, and from the heart of the husband ſhall bee withdrawne all kinde of ſuſpitions.
                     Sithens the office of the husband is to gather goods and riches, and The office of the Husband, and dutie of the wife. the office of a wife to keepe and preſerue them: the houre that ſhe goeth out of the houſe, ſhe ought to thinke that her Maydens will ſtray abroad, the Children will runne out to play, the Varlats and Seruants will bee out of order, the Neighbours wil take occaſions to ſpeake euill, and that which is worſte of all, ſome will ſteale the goods out of the houſe, and the others will ſpeake euill of the reeowne of the wife.
                     Oh, God giueth a goodly gift and grace to that man which hath ſuch &amp; ſo good a wife, that of her own nature loueth to keepe her ſelfe within the houſe. And truely, I ſay, that ſuch a one doeth excuſe many griefes, and ſaueth much mony: for ſhe ſpendeth not the goods in Apparel, nor giueth occaſion to men to iudge euill of her perſon. The greateſt debate that is betweene man and wife is, for that hee deſireth to get and keepe his goods to bring vp his children, and to maintayne his familie: and on the other part, that ſhe deſireth to ſpend all vpon apparrell: for women in this caſe are ſo curious in louing of themſelues, that they would abſtaine from meates that ſhould maintaine their life, onely to buy a new Gowne to ſet out their pride. Women naturally do

loue to keepe, and will not ſpend any thing, except it be in apparrell: for euery houre (that is in the day and the night) they deſire to haue a new Gowne to change.
                     My intention is not to ſpeake of Apparrell only, but to perſwade Princeſſes and great Ladyes, that they would keepe themſelues in their houſes; and in ſo doing, they ſhould excuſe theſe ſuperfluous waſtes and expences: for her neighbour ſeeing her better apparrelled then ſhee is, looketh vpon her husband, as ſhe were a Lyon. It chanceth oftentimes (I would to God I had no cauſe to ſpeake it) that if by chaunce there commeth any great or ſolemne Feaſt or Marriage, ſhee will neuer looke louingly on his face, before he hath giuen her a newe gowne to her backe: and when the poore Gentleman hath no money to pay, of neceſſitie hee muſt runne in credite.
                     And when the vanity of the woman is paſt, then the time of payment draweth neere, and they come to arreſt all his goods: ſo that they haue cauſe to lament one whole yeare, for that which they haue ſpent in one houre.
                     VVomen ſeldome contend for that one is fairer, more nobler of linage, better married, or more vertuous then another: but only that another goeth better apparelled then ſhee. For touching apparell, there is no woman can endure that another meaner woman ſhould make compariſon with her, nor that in like manner her equall ſhould excell her.
                     
                        Lycurgus in the lawes that he gaue The law of Lycurgus. to the Lacedemonians, commaunded that their Wiues ſhould not goe out of their houſes, but at diuers ſolemne Feaſts in the yeare. For he ſaide, that the women ought to be making their prayers in the Temples to the Gods, or elſe in their houſes, bringing vppe their children. For it is not honeſt nor cōmendable, that the wife ſhould paſſe her time abroade, trotting from ſtreet to ſtreete, as common women. I ſay that the Princeſſes and great Ladyes are much more bound to keepe themſelues at home in their Houſes, then other women of meaner degree: and without a cauſe I ſpeak it not, for thereby they ſhall get them more reputation. For there is no vertue whereby the woman winneth more reputation in the Common-wealth, then alwaies to be ſeen reſident in her houſe. I ſay alſo that a Wife ought the moſt part of her time to keepe her houſe, becauſe ſhe hath leſſe occaſion then others haue to goe abrode. For if the poore wife (the Plebian) goe out of her houſe, ſhee goeth for no other cauſe but for to ſeeke meat: but if the rich and Noble-woman goeth out of her houſe, it is for nothing but to take her pleaſure.
                     Let not Princeſſes maruell, nor let not great Ladyes wonder, if they diſpoſe their feete to trotte, and occupie their eyes to beholde, though their enemyes and neighbours with cankered hearts doe iudge them, and with euill tongues defame them: For the fond deedes that women do, maketh men to be raſh of iudgement. I like it well that the husbāds ſhold loue their wiues, that they ſhold comfort them, and make much of them, and that they ſhould put their truſt in them: but I doe diſcommend that the women ſhould goe gadding abroade in viſitation, from houſe to houſe, and that their husbands dare not gaine ſay The propertie of good Houſwifes. them. For admit that they be good in theyr perſons, yet in this doing, they giue occaſion for men to eſteem them vaine and light.
                     
                        Seneca ſaieth in an Epiſtle, that the great Romane Cato the Cenſor ordained that no woman ſhould go out of her houſe being alone, and if perhaps it were in the night, ſhee ſhould not goe alone without company, and that

the companie ſhould not bee ſuch as ſhe would choſe, but ſuch as her Huſband or Parent would aſſigne: So that with the ſame countenance wee behold now a common woman, with the ſelfe ſame lookes then we behelde her that went out of her houſe. What inconuenience cō
                           meth by gadding abroad
                     
                     Noble Ladyes (which loue theyr honor) ought greatly to conſider and weigh the manie inconueniences that enſue by often gadding abroad: For they ſpend much to Apparrell them, they loſe much precious time in trimming them, they keepe gentlewomen to wayte vpon them, they will ſtriue with theyr Husbandes to goe, and whiles ſhee is out of the dores, the houſe ſhall be euill kept, and all the enemyes, and friendes thereby haue matter wherevpon to talke.
                     Finally I ſay, that the woman that goeth out of her houſe, doeth not weigh the loſſe of her honor ſo much as ſhe doth the pleaſure ſhee taketh abroad. Preſuming (as I preſume) to write with grauitie, I ſay, that I am aſhamed to ſpeake it, yet for all that I will not refraine to write of the walkes of theſe Dames that viſite and deſire to be viſited: amongſt whom there is moued oftentimes ſuch vaine communication, that it cauſeth their Huſbands to become enemyes: and on the other part they remember more the Goſſipings that they haue to goe vnto, then the heauie burden of their ſinnes, which they ought to lament.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VIII. Of the commodities and diſcommodities which follow Princeſſes &amp; great Ladyes that go abroad to viſite, or abide in the houſe.
                     
                     
                        LVcretia by the conſent of all, was counted the chiefeſt of all other Matrones of Rome, and not for that that ſhe was more faire, more wiſe, of greater parentage, or more noble, but becauſe ſhee did withdrawe her ſelfe from companie, and abode ſolitarie: The commendations of Lucretia. For ſhee was ſuch a one, that in the heroycall vertues there could bee nothing more deſired: nor in womens weaknes there was nothing in her to be amended.
                     The hyſtorie of the chaſte Lucretia is euident in Titus Liuius, that when the husbands of diuers Romanes came home from the warres to theyr houſes, they found their wiues in ſuch fort that ſome were gaping out at the windowes, others deuiſing vainly at their doores, others in the Fieldes wandering, others in their gardens banquetting, others in the market being, and others in the ſtreetes, here and there gadding: but the famous Lucretia was found in her houſe alone, weauing of ſilke: So that ſhee flying companie, for that ſhe would not be ſeene, made her ſelfe in her Honour and renowme better to be knowne.
                     I will giue another counſell to Princeſſes &amp; great Ladies, the which as I am willing to giue, ſo I wiſh they would be as deſirous to receiue, that is to ſay, if they will bee eſteemed and counted for honeſt women, that they muſt keep themſelues from euil company: for though the ſtinking carrion doth no harme, becauſe wee eate it not; yet the vnſauory ſent thereof annoyeth vs by ſmelling. The honour of women is ſo delicate a thing, that if we giue them licence to go abroad to viſite women, wee muſt alſo giue them leaue to be viſited of men: for, that one Dame ſhould viſite another, it ſeemeth much charitie; that men ſhould viſite women, I cannot but thinke it much diſhoneſtie. In the preſence of their husbands and neere kinsfolks, they may be viſited and talked withall, and this is to bee vnderſtood of approoued and honeſt perſons;

Notwithſtanding I ſay, if the Husband be not at home, I would it ſhould bee counted Sacriledge, if any man paſſe the threſhold of the doore to viſite the wife.
                     
                        Plutarch ſaith in the booke of the prayſes of Women, that the wiues of the Numidians, when their Husbands were gone out of theyr houſes, kept The praiſes of the wiues of Numidia their Gates ſhutte, and locked themſelues in their houſes: and they had a Lawe, that whatſoeuer hee were that knocked at the dore being ſhut, without calling, hee ſhould haue his right hand cut off.
                     
                        Cicero in the booke of his Lawes ſaieth: That amongſt the Romanes, there was an ancient Law, and much vſed: that if perchaunce any woman did owe any Money to any man, and that the Husband (beeing the debter) were out of his houſe, the Creditour ſhould not aske the wife the debt, becauſe that vnder the colour of recouering the goods, hee ſhould not diſhonour her in her fame.
                     I would ſay therefore, that if the Creditour was not permitted in Rome to recouer his goods, for that the wife was not of her husband accompanied, much leſſe they would giue licence to viſite a Woman alone. For it were more reaſon that the creditor ſhould enter, for to recouer his goods, then thou ſhouldeſt enter onely for thy paſtime.
                     The diuine Plato in the books of the Common-wealth ſaith, and by profound reaſons perſwadeth the Wiues of Greece, that they haue no ſecrete Friends, but that euery one keepe this ſaying in memorie, for a principle: That the Woman ought not to haue any other Friend then her Husband. For women ought not to haue licence to make Friends, nor conditions to make enemies. Princeſſes and great Dames ought to conſider, that euery one of them giueth their bodyes, their goods, and their liberty to their Husbands.
                     Then ſince it is ſo I ſay, that with the liberty, ſhe ought alſo to giue him her will. For it little auaileth the man and the wife that their goods be common, if their wills be priuate. For to the ende that God be ſerued, and the people edified, both ought in one houſe to abide at one Table together to eate, in one Bed to ſleepe, and beſides this, they both ought one thing to loue. For if the man and the wife in loue doe differ, in their liues they ſhall neuer be quiet.
                     I admoniſh, deſire, and counſell all all women, if they wil be wel married; Where loue wanteth, diſcord reſteth. that they think it good, that their huſbands will, that they praiſe all that hee praiſeth, that they proue all that hee proueth, that they content themſelues with that wherewith their husbands are contented, and aboue all, that they loue no more then their huſbands ſhall loue: For otherwiſe it might be that the wife ſhould ſet her eyes vpon one, and the Husband ingage his heart to another.
                     
                        Plutarche in the booke of his pollitikes, ſaith: That a woman after ſhee is marryed, hath nothing proper: For the day that ſhee contracteth Marriage, ſhee maketh her Husband the only Lord of her goods, her libertie, and of her perſon.
                     
                     So that if the wife willeth any other thing, then that which her Husband willeth, if ſhee would loue any other thing then that her Husband loueth, we will not call her a true-louer, but an open theefe: for thieues doe not ſo much harme to robbe the husband of his mony, as the wife doth in withdrawing from him her heart.
                     If the woman will liue in peace with her Husband, ſhee ought to obſerue whervnto he is inclined: for ſo much A propertie of a good woman. as if hee be merrie, ſhee ought to reioyce, and if he be ſad, ſhee muſt temper herſelfe: if he be couetous, ſhee ſhould keepe: if hee be Prodigall,

ſhe ſhould ſpend: if he be vnpatient, ſhe ſhould diſſemble. For the Woman which is wiſe and ſage, if ſhee cannot as ſhe would, ſhe ought to wil what ſhee may. VVell, whether the Husband bes euill inclined, or in his conditions well mannered, I ſweare he cannot ſuffer that his wife ſhould haue any other louers: For though the man be of a meane ſtocke, he had rather alwayes that his VVife ſhould loue him alone, then the beſt of the nobilitie in the towne.
                     One thing I cannot diſſemble, becauſe I ſee that God is therwith offended. Which is, that maine Ladyes make their excuſes throgh ſicknes, becauſe they wold not paſſe once in the weeke come to heare Seruice, and yet wee ſee them buſie daylie, trotting about to viſite their Friendes: and the worſt of all is, that in the morning for colde they will not riſe, to go the Churches, and yet afterwardes in the heate of the day, they goe a gadding from houſe to houſe, whereas they are oftentimes vntill night.
                     I would that the Ladies would but conſider with themſelues, before they goe out of their houſes on viſitation, to what end they goe abroad: And if perchaunce they goe abroade to be looked on? let them know for a ſuretie, that there be fewe that will praiſe their beautie, but there be manie that will diſcommend their gadding.
                     And wherefore doe theſe Dames aſſemble together? for ſome graue matter I warrant you: Shall I tell ye; It is eyther to banquette with ſome daintie diſhes, to talke of theyr Petigrees, to deuiſe of their Husbands, to ſee who hath the beſt Gowne, to note who is euill attired, to flatter the faire, to laugh to ſcorne the Foule, to murmure at their Neighbours, and that which is the worſte of all, that euen they themſelues which ſpeake euill of them that are abſent, doe gnawe the one the other with enuie.
                     Seldom times it chaunceth that the Dames chide not with theyr Huſbands, after that in this ſort they haue bene togither: for ſo much as the one noteth the euill Apparell, the other babbling, they note the one to bee a Foole, and the other to be ſimple, ſo The quality of naughty Houſewiues. that it ſeemeth not that they are meete to viſite the one the other: but to look, and accuſe the one the other.
                     It is a ſtrange thing for the ſage woman to thinke that ſheee ſhould take pleaſure abroade, ſince ſhee hath her Husband at home, to whom ſhe may talke: and hath her children to learne, her Daughters to teach, her Familie to order, and her goods to gouerne: ſhee hath her houſe to keepe, and her Parents whome ſhee ought to pleaſe: then ſince ſhee hath within her houſe ſuch paſtime, why do they accept the companie of ſtraunge men?
                     That Marryed women ſhould haue priuate friends, and loue to be viſited: it followeth oftentimes that GOD is offended, the Husband iniuried, and the people ſlaundered: and the woman that is married, taketh little profite, and it hindereth the marriage of her that is to marrie. For in ſuch a caſe although ſome deſire her for her Riches, yet moe will forſake her for her euill fame.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. IX. That Women great with childe, ſpecially the Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought to be very circumſpect, for the danger of the creatures, wherein is ſhewed many misfortunes happened to Women with childe in the olde time, for ſuffering them to haue their wills,
                     
                     ONe of the moſt neceſſary things for him that taketh in hand anie great iourney, ouer any dangerous

Count eyes is, that at the beginning he ought to learne the way which he vndertaketh to goe: For it is a thing no leſſe troubleſome, then perillous, that when hee ſhould come to reſt, of neceſſitie hee ſhould be enforced to trauell.
                     None can denie, but that mans life is a long and tedious iourney: the which beginneth at our birth, and endeth at our death; For in the end to haue a long or ſhort life, is none other, but to come ſooner or later to the graue. The chiefeſt folly of all (in mine opinion) is this, that ſome in their owne conceits thinke they haue counſell enough for others, and to all others it ſeemeth that they want for The Follie of man. themſelues. For of right he may be called a foole, that condemneth all others for Fooles: and aduaunceth himſelfe to be wiſe. Euery man ought to let his neighbour liue in peace, and though he doe eſteeme himſelfe to be wiſe, yet hee ought not to thinke his neighbour a Foole: for there is none ſo wiſe, but that he may occupie it all. For we neuer yet ſaw any man ſo wiſe of himſelfe, but that hee needed the counſel of an other. And if this want be in thoſe that be very olde, truely it is much more in them that be young: whoſe fleſh is not drie, but greene, the bloud not colde, but hote, no deadly heate, but very liuely, the beaſtial motions not mortified, but quickened, and heereof enſueth, that young men loue their owne raſh aduiſe and opinions, and deſpiſe the graue counſells of others.
                     When the Trees are tender, they binde them together, becauſe they may grow right, they bridle the horſe when as yet they are but coltes, to the end they may be eaſie hereafter to the bridle. They take the Hawkes in the neſt, to make them more familiar: and when the beaſts are litle, they take thē to teache them. I meane that a man ought to inſtruct his children, to the ende they may grow to liue well hereafter. I admoniſh, and tell the Mothers that haue Daughters, that there is no remedie to reforme the euill inclinatiō of their childrē, but to teach them, and to bring them vp well in their youth: For there is no wound but is dangerous if in time the plaſter be not layde therevnto.
                     Returning now to our purpoſe, ſince How the man childe ought to be brought vp. that in all thinges there is order and meaſure: We will declare preſently how the Male Childe ought to bee taught: and firſt of all we will treate, how a man ought to prouide whē the infant is begotten, and when as yet it is aliue in the Mothers wombe: To the intent Princeſſes and great Ladyes ſhould liue very circumſpectly, when they know they are conceyued with childe.
                     I ſhould bee excuſed to ſpeake of this matter, ſince it is not my profeſſion, and that as yet I was neuer marryed, but by that I haue read of ſome, and by that I haue heard of others, I will and dare be ſo bolde to ſay one word. For the Sage oft times giueth better account of that he hath read, then the ſimple doth of that hee hath proued. This thing ſeemeth to bee true, betweene the Phyſitian and the Patient: For where the patient ſuffereth the euill, hee oft times demaundeth the phyſitian what his ſicknes is, and where it holdeth him, and what it is called, and what remedie there is for his diſeaſe: So the Phyſitian knoweth more by his ſcience, then the patient doth by his experience.
                     A man ought not to denie, that the women and in eſpecially great Ladies know not by experiēce, how they are altered when they are quicke, and the great paines they ſuffer when they are deliuered: wee could not denie but that there is great danger in the one, and great perill in the other, but they

ſhall neuer know frō whence all commeth, and frō whence all proceedeth, and what remedie is neceſſarie. For there are manie which complaine of robberyes, but yet they knowe not what the thieues are that haue robbed them. Firſt, according to my iudgement &amp; opinion, that which the woman quicke with childe ought to doe is, that they go ſoftly and quietly, and that they eſchue running, eyther in comming or going: for though ſhe little eſteem the health of her perſon, yet ſhee ought greatly to regarde the life of the creature. The more precious the liquor is, and the more weaker the veſſell is which containeth it: ſo much the more they ought to feare the danger, leſt the liquor ſhead, and How womē ought to carry themſelues in the time they goe with childe. the veſſell breake. I meane, that the complexion of Women (beeing with Childe) is very delicate, and that the ſoule of the creature is more pretious: and therefore it ought with great diligence to be preſerued: For all the treaſure of the Indies is not equall in value, to that which the woman beareth in her bowells,
                     When a man planteth a vineyard, forthwith he maketh a ditche, or ſome Fence for it, to the ende that Beaſtes ſhould not crop it whiles it is young: nor that Trauellers ſhould gather the Grapes when they are ripe. And if the Labourer doeth this thing for to get a little wine onely, the which for the ſoule and bodie is not always profitable: How much more circūſpection ought the woman to haue, to preſerue her childe, ſince ſhe ſhall render an accoſit to the Creator of her creature; vnto the Church of a chriſtian, and vnto her Husband of a childe?
                     In mine opinion, where the account at the houre of death is ſo ſtreight, it is requiſite for her, that in the time of her life ſhe be very circumſpect: For GOD knoweth euery thing ſo well in our life, that there is none that can beguile him, in rendring his account at his death. There is no wight can ſuffer, nor hart diſſemble, to ſee a man haue his deſire: that is to ſay, to haue his Wife great with chllde, and ready to bring forth good fruite, and afterwards to ſee the wofull Mother, by or throgh ſome ſudden accident periſh, &amp; the innocent babe not to be borne.
                     When the VVoman is healthfull, and big with childe, ſhe is worthie of great reproach, if eyther by running, leaping, or dauncing, any miſchaunce hap vnto her. And truly the Husband hath great cauſe to lament this caſe: For without doubt the Gardener feeleth great griefe in his heart, when in the Prime-time the tree is loden with bloſſomes, and yet by reaſon of ſome ſharpe and bitter Froſt, it neuer beareth fruite. It is not onely euill that women ſhould runne and leape when they are bigge and great with childe, but it is alſo diſhoneſt, &amp; ſpecially for great Ladyes: For alwayes women that are common dauncers, are eſteemed as light houſwiues.
                     The Wiues in generall, Princeſſes and great Ladyes in particular, ought to goe temperately, and to be modeſt in theyr mouings: For the modeſt gate argueth diſcreetneſſe in the perſon. All women naturally deſire to be honoured, and reuerenced: and touching The deſire of Women. that I let them know, that there is nothing which in a commonwealth is more honour for a woman, then to be wiſe and warie in ſpeaking, moderate and quiet in going. For it is vnpoſſible but that the woman which is light in her going, and malicious in her talking, ſhould bee deſpiſed and abhorred.
                     In the yeare of the Foundation of Rome, 466. the Romaines ſent Curius Dentatus, to make warre againſt King Pyrrus, who kept the citie of Tharent, and did much harme to the people in Rome: For the Romaines had a great

courage to conquer ſtrange Realmes, and therefore they could haue no patience to ſuffer any ſtranger to inuade theirs.
                     This Curius Dentatus was he which in the end ouercame King Pyrrus, and was the firſt that brought the Elephants to Rome in his triumphe, wherfore the fierceneſſe of thoſe Beaſts aſtoniſhed the Romane people much: for they weighed little the ſight of the Kings loden with yrons, but to ſee the Elephants as they did, they wondred much.
                     
                        Curius Dentatus had one onely Siſter, the which he entierly loued. They were ſeuen children, two of the which died in the warres, and other three by peſtilence: So that there were none left him but that ſiſter, wherefore hee loued her with all his heart. For the death of vnthrifty children, is but as a watch for children vnprouided of fauors. This ſiſter of Curius Dentatus was marryed to a Roman Conſull, and was conceyued, and gone 7. moneths with childe: and the day that her brother Triumphed, (for ioy of her Brothers honour) ſhe leaped and daunced ſo much, that in the ſame place ſhee was deliuered, and ſo vnluckely, that the Mother tooke her death, and the Childe neuer liued: wherevpon the feaſt of the Triumph ceaſed, and the Father of the infant with ſorrowe loſt his ſpeech, For the heart which ſuddenly feeleth griefe incontinently loſeth vnderſtanding.
                     
                        Tibullus the Grecian, in the 3. booke De caſibus Triumphi, declareth the hyſtorie in good ſtile, how, and in what ſorte it chaunced. Nine yeares after Tibullus de caſibus triumphi. that the Kings of Rome were baniſhed for the rape that Tarquine did, to the chaſte Lucretia, the Romaines created a dignitie, which they called Dictatura, and the Dictator that had this office, was aboue all other Lord and chiefe: For the Romaines perceyued that the Commonwealth could not be gouerned, but by one head alone. And becauſe the Dictatour had ſo great authoritie, as the Emperour hath at this preſent, and to the end they ſhold not become Tyrants: they prouided that the office of the Dictatorſhip ſhould laſt no longer then vi. moneths in the yeare, the which paſt and expired, they choſe another. Truely it was a good order that that office dured but 6. moneths. For oft times Princes thinking to haue perpetuall authoritie, become negligent in vſing iuſtice.
                     The firſt Dictator in Rome, was Largius Mamillus, who was ſent againſt the Volces, the which at that time were The firſt Dictator in Rome. the greateſt enemies to the Romaines: For Rome was founded in ſuch a ſigne, that alwayes it was beloued of fewe, and abhorred of manie.
                     As Titus Liuius ſaieth, this Largius Mamillus vanquiſhed the Volces, and triumphed ouer them, and in the end of that warre deſtroyed their mightie citie called Curiola, and alſo deſtroyed and ouerthrew many places and Fortreſſes in that Prouince: for the cruell harts do not only deſtroy the perſons, but alſo take vengeaunce of the ſtones. The hurtes which L: Mamillus did in the Countrey of the Volces, were maruellous, and the men which he ſlew were many, and the treaſories he robbed were infinite, and the captiues which hee had in his Triumphe were a great number: amongſt whom in eſpeciall he brought captiue a Noble mans daughter, a beautiful gentlewomā, the which he kept in his houſe, for the recreation of his perſon: For the ancient Romaines gaue to the people all the treaſures to maintaine the warre, and they took to themſelues all the vicious thinges to keepe in theyr houſes. The caſe was, that this damſel beeing with childe, Largius Mamillus brought her to ſolace her ſelfe in the orchard, wher were ſundry yōg fruits,

and as then not ripe to eate, whereof with ſo great affection ſhee did eate, that forthwith ſhee was deliuered in the ſame place of a creature: ſo that on the one part ſhe was deliuered, and on the other part the childe dyed.
                     This thing chaunced in the gardens of Vulcan, two dayes after the triumph of Largius Mamilius, a ruefull and lamentable caſe to declare, foraſmuch as both the childe that was borne, the Mother that was deliuered, and alſo the Father that begat it, the ſelf-ſame day dyed, and were buryed all in one graue: and this thing was not without great wayling and lamenting thoroughout all Rome: For if with teares their liues might haue been reſtored, without doubt none of them ſhould haue bene buryed.
                     The firſt Sonne of Rome, which rebelled againſt Rome, was Tarquine the proude. The ſecond that withſtoode Rome (beeeing as yet in Lucanta,) was The firſt rebell in Rome. 
                        Quintus Marcius. The third that went againſt Rome, was the cruell Sylla. The dammages which theſe three did to their Mother Rome, were ſuch and ſo great, that the three ſeuerall warres of Affrike were nothing to be compared to theſe three euill children: for thoſe enemyes could ſcarcely ſee the walles of Rome, but theſe vnnaturall children had almoſt not left one ſtone vppon another.
                     A man ought not greatly to eſteeme thoſe buyldings which thoſe Tyrants thre we to the ground, nor the buildings which they deſtroyed, neyther the men that they ſlewe, nor the women that they forced, nor yet the Orphanes which they made: but aboue all things we ought to lament for that which they brought into Rome. For the Common-wealth is not deſtroyed for lacke of wealth, riches, and ſumptuous buyldings, but euen becauſe all vices abound, and vertues are wanting.
                     Of theſe three Romaines, hee whoſe name was Quintus Marcius had beene Conſull thrice, once Dictator, and foure times Cenſor, and in the ende hee was with much ſhame banniſhed from Rome, wherewith to reuenge this iniurie, hee came with a great power and Armie againſt Rome: For the proude hart wounded with iniurie, is neuer quyet in his life time, vnill hee ſee his enemyes deſtroyed, or that on them he hath taken vengeance.
                     
                     
                        Quintus Marcius being very nigh to the Gates of Rome, was moſt inſtantly required that hee would not deſtroy his Mother Rome: but hee tooke no regarde, nor would condiſcend to any requeſt, vntill ſuch time that his Mother iſſued, with a Niece of his, whom hee loued entierly. At whoſe interceſſion &amp; teares he left his anger, and raiſed his ſiege from Rome. For manie are ſooner ouercome with teares, then with importunate and reaſonable requeſts.
                     The Ladyes of Rome vſed much to haue their haires long and yellow, and to weare their waſtes high &amp; ſtreight. An auncient cuſtome vſed by the Ladyes in Rome. And as the Niece of Quintus Marcius was great and big with childe, the day that the peace was made between Q: Marcius and Rome, lacing herſelfe too hard in her attire, to ſeeme more proper and comely, ſhee long before her time was deliuered of a creature: and the caſe was ſo woefull and vnfortunate, that the creature deliuered died: the Mother loſt her life, and the mother looſing her life, ſuddainly her grandmother fel dead to the ground; throgh which occaſion all the ioy and mirth was turned into ſorrowe &amp; ſadnes. For it is commonly ſeene, when the World is in the greateſt ioy, then Fortune ſuddainly turneth it into ſorrow. The Authors heereof are Tibulus and Porphyrius, both Grecians.

                        THe wars of Tarent beeing ended, immediately begūne the warres of Carthage, of which ſo long and tedious warre, the poſſeſſion of the Iſles of Maiorica and Minorica were occaſion: Forſomuch as the one would take it, and the other defend it. This warre endured wel nigh the ſpace of 40, yeares: for oft times the waſtes and dammages which are done in the Warres are greater, then the profite for which they contend.
                     The firſt Captaine in this Warre of the Romaines, was Gaius Duellus, and the firſt of the Carthaginians, was Hammon, the which with their Ships fought on the Sea of Scicile the which was very cruell: for there they feared both the fury of the Sea, and alſo the crueltie of the Pike, the which two things, put mans life in great danger.
                     Of this cruell Battell the Romaine Captaine remained victorious, foraſmuch as he drowned 14. Sippes, and tooke other 30. hee ſlew three thouſand men, and broght three thouſand The firſt victorie the Romaines obtained by Sea. 
                        Carthaginians priſoners: and this was the firſt victory that the Romaines had by Sea. And that that the Romaines moſt reioyced at was, that by Sea alſo they remained Conquerours.
                     The Captaine Gaius Duellus departing from Scicile came to Rome, where he had a Siſter no leſſe vertuous, then rich and beautifull: in whoſe houſe hee lodged, where hee made a moſt coſtly Supper to all the Senatours of Rome, and to all the Captains which came with him from the warres: for the vicious men knewe not wherin to ſhew their loue to their Friendes, but by inuiting them to coſtly Banquets. The Siſter of the Captain Gaius Duellus, for ioy of his comming, and for the pleaſure of the Banquet and Feaſt which was made in her houſe, did eate more then ſhee was accuſtomed, and alſo more then it behoued one in her caſe, ſo that in the preſence of all, ſhee began to annnoy the bidden Gueſts: For ſhee not onely vomited out the meate of her ſtomacke, but alſo the bloud of her veines, and therewithall moſt vnluckely brought forth her fruit which ſhe had in her entrailes, wherewith immediately after the Soule departed from the bodie, and ſo dyed.
                     Truely this caſe was no leſſe to be lamented then the other, for ſo much as Gaius loſt his Siſter, the Husband loſt his Wife and his Childe, and the wife and the childe loſt their liues: and for that that Rome loſt ſo Noble and excellent a Romane, and aboue all for that it chaunced in ſuch a time of ſo great ioy and pleaſure. For there can come no vnluckier newes, then in the time of much myrth to heare tell of any great miſchance. Of this matter mention is made in Blandus, in the book of the declinatiō of the Empire.
                     The ſecond warre of Affrike, which was betweene Rome and Carthage, was in the 540. yeares after the Foundation of Rome, wherein were Captaines Paulus Emilius, and Publius Varro: the which two Conſulls fought the great and famous bloudy Battell of Cannas, in the Prouince of Apulia: I ſay famous; becauſe Rome neuer loſt ſuch Nobilitie and Romaine youth, as ſhee loſt in that day.
                     Of theſe two Conſulles, Paulus Emilius in the Battell was ſlayne, and Publius Varro was ouercome, and the moſt couragious Hanniball remained

conquerour of the Field, wherein dyed xxx. Senatours, and 300. officers of the Senate, and aboue xl. thouſand footmen, and three thouſand horſemen. Finally, the end of all the Roman people had been that day, if Hannibal had had the witte to haue followed ſo noble a victory, as he had the courage to giue ſo cruell a Battell.
                     A litle before that Publius Varro departed to goe to the warres, hee was married to a faire and young Romaine called Sophia, and within ſeuen moneths ſhee was quicke; and as newes was brought her, that Paulus Aemilius was dead, and her husband ouercome ſhe died ſuddenly, the creature remaining aliue in her bodie. This caſe aboue all was very pittifull, in that that after he himſelfe was vanquiſhed, and The death of Sophia, and that he had ſeene his companion the Conſull Emilius ſlaine, with ſo great a number of the Romane people, Fortune would that with his own eyes he ſhould behold the entrailes of his wife cut, to take out the Childe, and likeewiſe to ſee the Earth opened, to burie his wife.
                     
                        Titus Liuius ſaith, that Publius Varro remained ſo ſorrowfull in his heart, Titus Liuius to ſee himſelfe ouercome of his enemyes, and to ſee his wife ſo ſuddenly, and ſo vnluckely ſtricken with death, that all the time that his life endured, he neyther combed his beard, ſlept in bed, nor dined at the Table: and hereat we ought not to maruel: for a man in his hart may be ſo wounded in one houre, that hee ſhall neuer reioyce all the dayes of his life. If wee put no doubts in Titus Liuius, the Romaines had long and tedious warres againſt the Samnites, which endured for the ſpace of lxiii. yeares contiually, vntill ſuch time as the Conſull Ancus Rutilius (who was a vertuous man) did ſet a good appointment of peace between the Samnites and the Romanes: For the noble &amp; ſtout harts ought alwaies by vertue to bring their enemies to peace Theſe warres therfore being ſo cruell and obſtinate, Titus Venurius, and Spurius Poſthuminus (which were Romaine Captains) were ouercome by Pontius the valiant Captaine of the Samnites: who after the victorie did a thing neuer ſeene nor heard of before. That is to ſay, that all the Romaine priſoners whom hee tooke, hee put about theyr necks a yoke, wherein was written, In ſpight of Rome, the Romaines ſhall be ſubtects to the yoke of the Samnites. Wherewith indeed the Romains were greatly iniuried, wherefore they ſought ſtoutto be reuēged of the Samnites: for the harts that are haughty &amp; proud, cānot ſuffer that others haue theyr mindes lofty and high. The Romaines therefore created to bee Captaine of the Warre, one named Lucius Papirius, who had Commiſſion to goe againſt the Samnites. This Lucius was more Fortunate in his doings, then comely of his perſon, for he was deformed of his face: notwithſtanding, hee did ſo good ſeruice in the warre, and Fortune fauoured him ſo well, that he did not onely ouercome and vanquiſh, but alſo deſtroyed them: and though the iniurie which the Samnites did to the Romaines was great, yet truely the iniurie which the Romaines did to the Samnites was much greater. For Fortune is ſo variable, that thoſe which The mutabilitie of Fortune. yeſterday we ſaw in moſt proſperitie, too day wee ſee in greateſt aduerſitie. This Lucius Papirius therfore did not only vanquiſh the Samnites, kept them priſoners, and made yokes for theyr neckes, but alſo he bound them with cords together, in ſuch ſort, that they made them plough the ground, drawing two and two a plough. And yet not herewith contēted, but with gads, they pricked and tormented them.
                     If the Samnites had had pitie of the Romaines beeing ouercome, the Romaines likewiſe would haue taken

compaſſion of them when they were Conquerours. And therefore the proſperous haue as much neede of good counſell, as the miſerable haue neede of remedie. For the man which is not merciful in his proſperitie, hee ought not to maruel though he finde no friendes in his neceſſitie.
                     This Lucius Papirius had a Daughter maried to a Senator of Rome, who was called Torquatus, and ſhe was called Ypolita, And about that time that ſhe ſhould haue bene deliuered, ſhee went forth to receiue her Father, the which ſhe ought not to haue don: for the throng of the people in receiuing him being great, and ſhe herſelfe being great with child, by a moſt heauie chaunce, as ſhe would haue paſſed in at a narrow gate, ſhee was ſo preſt in The death of Ypolita. the throng, that ſhe chaunged her life for death, and her Father turned his m

                        th and ioy into ſorrow and ſadnes. For he tooke the death of his daughter very heauilie: and ſo much the more, becauſe it was ſo ſuddenly.
                     I ſay, hee tooke it heauily, ſince he was ſo ſtoute a man, and ſo Sage withall, that all Rome thought much that any ſuch ſudden chaunce ſhould haue diſmayed ſo worthie a man, that of his wiſedome he could take no benefite: but heereat let no man maruell: For ther are many that haue harts to ſhed the bloud of their enemies, and yet cā
                        not withholde the teares of their eyes.
                     
                        Annius Seuerus, in the third booke De infelieitate Fortuna, ſaith: that the day that this wofull miſhap chaunced to Lucius Papirius, hee lift vp his eyes to the Heauens, and weeping ſaide:
                     Oh Fortune, deceiuer of all mortall men, thou madeſt mee to conquere in warre, to the intent to ouercome me in peace. My mind was to declare vnto you all theſe ancients hyſtories, to the end that al may know, how tender women with childe are: and how diligent their Husbands ought to bee to preſerue them: ſince there is nothing ſo tender to be kept, nor any glaſſe ſo eaſie to be broken. For there is much glaſſe, that thogh it fall to the ground yet it doeth not breake, but a woman The dangs

                     CHAP. XI. That Women great with childe, and eſpecially Princeſſes &amp; great ladyes, ought to be gently vſed of theyr Husbands.
                     
                     
                        IF wee vnderſtand the Chapter before wee ſhall finde that women with childe haue bin in great dā
                        gers, ſome through leaping, ſome by dauncing, others by eaung, others by banquetting, others throgh gadding, others by ſtraight lacing: and all this proceedeth throgh their own follies, that ſeeke to bee deſtroyers of theyr owne bodyes. Truly herein Princeſſes and great Ladyes are worthie of much rebuke, when throgh their own follies they are not ſafely deliuered of their creatures. And I would gladly they toke example, not only of reaſonable men, but alſo of brute beaſts: for there is no beaſt ſo brute in the wilde mountains, but eſcheweth that which to his life and death will be hurtfull.
                     The Beares, the Lyonneſſe, and the Wolfes, neuer iſſue out of their caues and dennes ſo long as they be bigge, and this they doe to auoyde the dangers of the Hunters, becauſe at that time they would not be courſed.
                     Then ſeeing theſe things are done by the brute beaſtes, (whoſe younglings are alwayes hurtfull vnto men,) to the intent theyr rauening greedie Whealpes might ſafely bee brought

foorth to deuoure our innocent Cattell: How much more then ought the Woman to be carefull for her fruite, which is the increaſe of chriſtian congregation? If Women brought not forth, and Children were not borne, though there be earth, yet there ſhould bee none to people it: For GOD created all things to ſerue the creature, and created the creatures to ſerue their Creator.
                     Let VVomen that are with childe take example by the Cheſſe-nuts and Wal-nuts, how and in what ſort they defend their fruite, after that of theyr bloſſoms they are depriued: for the cheſſenuttree defendeth his fruit with a rough and hard huske, the wall-nut keepeth her fruite with a thicke ſhale in like maner, ſo that the water cannot wet them, nor the winde ſhake them.
                     Now ſince that the Trees (which A good warning for women with childe. haue but a vegetatiue life, and the Beaſts but a Senſitiue life, take ſuch heede to themſelues, when they feele them ready to bring forth their fruite, much more women with child ought to take heede to themſelues, ſince they haue reaſon and vnderſtanding, leſt through theyr negligence the creature ſhould periſh. Let euery man iudge how little he loſeth, when he loſeth nuttes and cheſſenuts: and for the contrarie, let euery men iudge what the Church looſeth, when the women with child do not bring forth their fruit, into the light of baptiſme. For our mother the holy Church bewaileth not for that the vines are frozen: but for the ſoules that are loſt.
                     To the ende that the man may ſee fruitfull bleſſing which hee deſireth, &amp; that the woman with child may ſee her ſelfe well deliuered, the Husband ought to beware that hee enforceth her not much to labour, and the woman likewiſe ought to be circumſpect that ſhee take not too much idlenes. For in women with child this is a generall rule, that too much trauell cauſeth them before theyr time to deliuer: and too much idleneſſe putteth them in daunger. The man is cruell that will haue his Wife trauell, and take as much paines when ſhee is big, as he would at another time when ſhe is not with childe: for the man which is clothed, can not runne ſo ſwifte, as hee that is naked.
                     
                        Ariſtotle in the ſixt booke de Animalibus, ſaith: When the Lyonneſſe is bigge with whelp, the Lyon doth not only hunt for her himſelfe: but alſo both night &amp; day he wandreth cōtinually to watch her.
                     
                     I meane that Princeſſes and great Ariſtotle de Animalibus Ladyes, when they be with Childe, ſhould bee of theyr Husbands both tended and ſerued: For the man cannot do the woman ſo great a pleaſure before her lying down, as ſhe doth to him when ſhe bringeth forth a ſonne
                     Conſidering the daunger that the woman abideth in her deliueraunce, and beholding the paines that the Husband taketh in her ſeruice: without compariſon that is greater which ſhe ſuffereth, then that which hee endureth. For when the woman deliuereth, ſhe doth more then her power, and the Husband (though hee ſerueth her well, doeth leſſe then his duetie. The gentle and louing Husband ought not one moment to forſake his wife, ſpecially when hee ſeeth ſhee is great: For in the law of a good Husband it is written, that hee ſhould ſet his eyes to beholde her, his handes to ſerue her, he ſhold ſpend his goods to cheriſh her, and ſhould giue his heart The propertie of a good Huſband. to content her. Let not men thinke it paines to ſerue their wiues when they are with childe, for their labour conſiſteth in their ſtrength, but the trauell of their wiues is in their entrails. And that which is moſt pitiful is, that when the ſorrowfull women will diſcharge their burden on the earth, they often times bring thēſelues vnto the graue.
                     
                        
The meane women of the Plebians ought no leſſe to be reproued, for that when they are with child they would be exempted from all buſineſſe of the houſe: the which neyther they themſelues ought to deſire, nor yet their husbands to ſuffer: for idleneſſe is not onely an occaſion not to deſerue heauen: but alſo it is a cauſe whereby women oft times haue ill ſucceſſe in their trauaile: for conſidering both the daintie Lady with childe, that hath her pleaſure, and doth little; and on the other ſide, the poore mans wife, which moderately laboureth, you ſhall ſee, that the great Ladyes, for all their pleaſures, abideth more danger then the other doth with all her labour.
                     The husband ought to keepe his wife from taking too much paynes; for ſo ought he to doe: and the wife likewiſe ought to flee too much pleaſure, for it behoueth her.
                     For the meane trauell is no other but occaſion of a ſafe deliuerie. The women with childe alſo ought to take heede to themſelues, and in eſpecially noble &amp; great ladies, that they be not too greedy &amp; haſty in eating. For the woman being with child ought to be ſober: and the woman which is a great eater, with great pains ſhal liue chaſte. Women with child oft times doe diſorder themſelues in eating licorous meats: and vnder the colour of feeding themſelues &amp; their infant, they take too exceſſiuely; which is not onely vnholſome for the Childe, but alſo diſhonour for their mothers. For truely by the exceſſe of the Mother (being with child) commeth many diſeaſes to the infant whē it liueth.
                     The Husbands alſo ought neyther to diſpleaſe nor grieue their Wiues, eſpecially when they ſee them great with childe: for of truth oftentimes ſhe deliuereth with more daunger, by reaſon of the offences that men doe vnto them, then by the aboundance of meates which they doe eate.
                     Though the Woman when ſhee is with Childe, in ſome things doth offend her Husband, yet hee like a wiſe man ought to forbeare her, hauing reſpect to the childe, wherewith ſhe is great, and not to the iniuries that ſhe hath committed: For in the end, the Reaſonable Creatures may take example by the vnreaſonable. Mother cannot bee ſo great an offender, but the child is much more innocent. For the proofe of this, it needeth not books to read, but onely our eyes to ſee: how the brute Beaſts for the moſt part (when their females are bigge) do not touch them, nor yet the Females ſuffer them to be touched. I meane, that the Noble and high Eſtates ought to abſent thēſelues from their wiues carnally, being great with childe: and hee that in this caſe ſhall ſhewe himſelfe moſt temperate, ſhall of all men be deemed moſt vertuous.
                     I doe not ſpeake this to the ende it ſhould binde a man, or that it were an offence then to vſe the companie of his wife, but vnto men that are vertuous I giue it as a counſell. For ſome A cuſtome among the Mauritanians. things ought to bee done of neceſſitie, and others ought to be eſchued for honeſtie.
                     
                        Dyodorus Siculus ſaieth, that in the Realme of Mauritania there were ſo few men, and ſo many women, that euery man had fiue wiues: where there was a law among them, that no man ſhould marrie vnder three wiues: furthermore they had a wonderfull and fooliſh cuſtome, that when any Husband died, one of thoſe women ſhuld caſt herſelfe quicke into the graue, and be buried with him. And if that within a moneth ſhe did it not, or that ſhe dyed not, by iuſtice ſhee was openly put to death: ſaying, that it is more honeſtie to bee in companie with her Husband in the graue, then it is to be alone in her houſe.
                     In the Iſles of Baleares the contrary

is ſeene, for there increaſe ſo many men, and ſo few women, that for one woman there was ſeuen men: and ſo they had a cuſtome, eſpecially amongſt the poore, that one woman ſhould bee marryed with fiue men. For the rich men ſent to ſeeke for women in other ſtrange Realmes, wherfore then Merchants came heauie loaden with women, as now they doe with marchandize to ſell. Vpon which occaſion there was a cuſtome in thoſe Iſles, that (for as much as there were ſo few women) when any woman with childe drew neere the ſeuen monethes, they were ſeperated from their husbands, and ſhutte and locked vp in the Temples, where they gaue them ſuch things as were neceſſary for them of the common treaſure. For the ancients had their Gods in ſuch veneration, that they would not permit any perſon to eate that which he brought; but of that which vnto the Gods of the Temple was offered. At that time the Barbarous kept theit wiues locked in the Church, becauſe the Gods hauing them in their Temples, ſhould bee more mercifull vnto them in their deliuerie, and alſo to cauſe them to auoyde the dangers at that time: and beſides that, becauſe they tooke it for a great villany, that the women, during that time, ſhould remaine with their husbands.
                     The famous and renowmed Philoſopher, Pulio, in the fift Booke, De moribus antiquorum, ſaid, That in the Realme of Pannonia, (which now is Hungarie) the women that were great A cuſtome in Hungary with childe were ſo highly eſteemed, that when any went out of her houſe, all thoſe which mette with her were bound to returne backe with her; and in ſuch ſort as wee at this preſent doe reuerence the holy Communion, ſo did theſe Barbarous then the women with childe.
                     The women of Carthage, being with childe (when Carthage was Carthage) had as great priuileges, as now our Sanctuaries haue for the ſafegard of miſdoers: for, in times paſt, all ſuch offenders as could enter into the houſe where a woman lay in childbed, ſhould haue beene free from correction of Iuſtice.
                     As Fronto ſaith, in his Booke of the Veneration of the Gods, the Gallois Tranſalpins did not only honor &amp; reuerence the women with childe; but alſo with much care and diligence watched her deliuery: for it little auaileth the Shippe to haue paſſed ſafe the dangerous Seas, if at the Shore ſhe be caſt away.
                     The caſe was in this ſort, that al the ancient Gentiles honored ſome gods in their Temples, and kept other in The falſe opinion of the Heathen. their houſes, the which were called Lares and Penates: and when any woman began to labour, each neighbour brought his familiar god vnto her, to preſent her with all, becauſe they thought, that the more gods there were, of ſo much more power they were to keepe her from perills.
                     Speaking like a Chriſtian; Truely, thoſe gods were of ſmall value, ſince they could not helpe the woman ſafely to be deliuered that was in trauaile.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XII. What the Philoſopher Piſto was: and of the Rules hee gaue concerning women with childe.
                     
                     IN the time of Octauian the Emperour, was a Philoſopher called Piſto, which was of the ſect of Pithagoras; and when Rome flouriſhed, he was very familiar with the Emperour Octauian, and well beloued of all the people, which ought not to be a little eſteemed: for he which of the Prince is moſt fauored, commonly

of the people is much hated.
                     This Emperour Octauian was a The Commendation of the Emperour Octauian. Prince very deſirous of all vertuous things; ſo that when he dined with his Captaines, he ſpake of Warre; when he ſupped with the Sages, hee reaſoned of the Sciences; and he that vttered any diſhoneſt or idle word in his preſence, hee alwaies afterward tooke him as his enemie.
                     This Piſto was very graue in waightie affaires, very pleaſant in ſlents and jeſts; and oft times he was demanded many queſtions of the Emperour, whereof the anſweres of ſome (according to the demands and queſtions) here followeth.
                     The Emperour ſayd to Piſto, Of all The ſaying of Piſto. theſe that liueth, whom takeſt thou to be moſt Foole? To whom the Philoſopher anſwered. In my opinion, I take him to be moſt foole, of whoſe word there commeth no profite: for truely, he is not ſo very a foole that flingeth ſtones into the winde, as he that vttereth vaine words.
                     
                     Tell me, Piſto, Whom ought wee of right to deſire to ſpeake, &amp; whom of right to command to be ſilent? He anſwered; It is good when ſpeech doth profite, and good to keepe ſilence when ſpeech is hurtfull: for the one deſiring to maintaine the good, and the other to defend the euill, warres begin throughout all the world.
                     
                     Tell mee, Piſto, from what thing ought the fathers moſt to keepe their children? He ſayd, In my opinion, parents ought in nothing to watch ſo much, as to keepe them from being vicious: for the father ought rather to haue his ſonne dye well, then to liue euill.
                     
                     Tell me, Piſto, What ſhall man do if hee be brought to this extremitie, That if he ſpeake truth, hee condemneth himſelfe: and if hee make a lye, he ſaueth himſelfe? The vertuous man (ſaid he) ought rather to chooſe to be ouercome by truth, then to ouercome by lyes: for it is vnpoſsible, that a man which is a lyer ſhould continue long in proſperity.
                     
                     Tell me, Piſto, What ſhall men do to obtaine reſt? He anſwered, As I thinke, the man cannot haue reſt, vnleſſe he forſake worldly affayres: for the men that are occupied with weightie affaires, cannot be without great cares, or alwaies accompanied of great troubles.
                     
                     Tell me, Piſto, wherein a man ſheweth himſelfe to be moſt wiſe? He anſwered. There is no greater proofe to know a wiſe man, then if he be patient to ſuffer the ignorant: for in ſuffering an iniurie, the heart is more holpen by wiſedome then by knowledge.
                     
                     Tell mee, Piſto, What is that thing that the vertuous man may lawfully deſire? He anſwered, All that is good (ſo that it be not to the preiudice of any other) may honeſtly be deſired: but in my opinion, that onely ought to bee deſired, which openly without ſhame may bee demanded.
                     
                     Tell me, Piſto, What ſhall men do with their wiues when they are great with childe, to cauſe that the child in ſafetie may be deliuered? He anſwered, In the world there is nothing more perillous, iben to haue the charge of a woman with childe: for if the husband ſerue her, hee hath paine and trauaile: and if perchance hee doe not content her, ſhe is in danger.
                     
                     In this caſe the wiues of Rome, and their husbands alſo, ought to be very diligent, and to the things following more carefull, the which I ſhew them more for counſell then for commandement: for good counſell ought to haue as much authoritie in the vertuous, as the commandement hath in the vicious.
                     Thou Octauian, as thou art a mercifull and a pittifull Emperour, and How good counſell ought to be regarded. that thou keepeſt thy Neece Collucia great with childe, I know thou deſireſt that ſhee had preſently good and lucky deliuery, and that ſhee were deliuered

of her paine: all the which thou ſhalt ſee, if thou doſt marke theſe things that I will ſhew thee heere following.
                     
                        Firſt, the woman ought to beware of dancing, leaping, and running: for leaping 
                        What is required of women with child. 
                        oftentimes maketh man to loſe his ſpeach, and women with childe to loſe their life, wherefore it is not reaſon that the folly of the mother ſhould bee permitted to put in hazzard the life of the child.
                     
                     
                        The ſecond, the woman being with childe, ought to beware that ſhee be not ſo hardy, to enter into Gardens where there is much fruit, and that for eating too many ſhee bee not ill deliuered: for it is no reaſon, that the lycorouſnes of the mother be puniſhed with the death of the childe.
                     
                     
                        The third, the woman with childe ought to beware of ouer hard lacing her ſelfe about the middle: for many Romane Dames, for to ſeeme proper, doe weare their Gownes ſo ſtraite, that it is an occaſion to kill their creatures, which is a heynous matter, that the young babe ſhould loſe his life, becauſe his mother ſhould ſeeme pretty.
                     
                     
                        The fourth, the women with childe ought to beware of eating in a great Banquet: for oft times there commeth a ſuddaine deliuerance, onely through eating without meaſure: and it is not meete, that for taſting a thing of little value, the mother and the childe ſhould both loſe their liues.
                     
                     
                        The fift, the woman being with child ought to beware that ſhe giueth no eare to any ſudden newes: for ſhee is in more danger for hearing a thing that grieueth her, then for ſuffering long ſickneſſe that payneth her: and it were vniuſt, that for knowing of a trifling matter, the mother that is to be deliuered, and the child that is to be borne, ſhould both in one moment periſh.
                     
                     
                        The ſixt, the woman with childe ought to beware that ſhe goe not by any meanes to any Feaſts, where there ſhall bee any great aſſembly of people: for oft times the woman with childe, ſeeing her to bee much thruſt and preſt, being not able to ſay, I am here, may immediately dye in the place: and it is not reaſon, but an vniuſt thing, that the woman, for the deſire to ſee the children of others, ſhould make of her owne Orphanes.
                     
                     
                        The ſeuenth, the husband ought to beware, that ſhe being with childe, bee not deneyd any honeſt thing that ſhee doth minde; for ingranting her it cannot coſt him much; but in denying her, hee may loſe much: and it would not bee iuſt, that ſince in her bringing foorth ſhe honoreth and increaſeth the Common-wealth of Rome, that Rome ſhould condiſcend that any woman with child ſhould receiue any hurt or diſhonour.
                     
                     Theſe bee the anſweres that Piſto made the Emperour Octauian, the which hee gaue as Rules to women with childe, which being ſo kept, I do aſſure you, that the great Ladyes ſhould deliuer themſelues from many perils, &amp; the husbands alſo ſhould eſcape from many ſorrowes.
                     Concluding therefore that which aboue all is ſpoken, I ſay, that Princeſſes and great Ladies, when they are with childe, ought to bee more warie and circumſpect then other meane women: for where man hopeth to haue moſt profit, there ought he moſt to be carefull.

                        Of three Counſels which Lucius Seneca gaue vnto a Secretarie his friend, who ſerued the Emperour Nero: and how the Emperour Marcus Aurelius diſpoſed all the houres of the day.
                     
                     THe Emperour Nero had a Secretary called Emilius Varro, the

which being in Rome builded a ſumptuous houſe ioyning vnto the Gate of Salaria, whereunto hee inuited one day Lucius Seneca to a banquet, to the end the houſe might bee more fortunate: for the Romanes had a prophecie, That according to the good or ill lucke of him that firſt entred into a new houſe, ſo ſhould it continually be luckie, or vnluckie. Lucius Seneca graunted to the requeſt of his friend Emilius Varro: and when they had well eaten, they went both to ſee this new building, ſhewing vnto Lucius Seneca all things: at the laſt the Secretary ſayd thus vnto Seneca: Thoſe betweene both, are for Gueſts: thoſe Halles, are for Merchants &amp; Suitors: theſe Secrets, are for Women: thoſe Chambers, are for Knights: thoſe Galleries, which are couered, are to auoide the Sunne: this loweſt part here, is for Horſes: the Sellers, are for the Buttry: in the end he ſhewed him the whole houſe, for the furniſhing whereof they lacked not one jot.
                     After the Secretarie Emilius Varro had ſhewed him all his houſe, hee looked when his Gueſt Seneca would greatly praiſe and commend it; but he, as though hee knew nothing, ſayd vnto Emilius Varro, as he went out of the dores, Whoſe houſe is this? Wherevnto Emilius anſwered: How now, Seneca! canſt thou not tell? I haue employed all my goods in building this houſe, and haue led thee all about to ſee it, and I haue told thee that it is mine; and yet doſt thou aske me againe whoſe it is?
                     
                     
                        Lucius Seneca anſwered: Thou haſt ſhewed vs the houſe for ſtrangers, the houſe for ſleues, the houſe for women, the houſe for horſes; and in all this houſe thou haſt not ſhewed me one little part for thy ſelfe, but that another man doth enter into it: for if thou haſt any intereſt therein, they haue the beſt thereof, which is the poſſeſsion. I account thee a wiſe man, I doe account thee a man of vnderſtanding, and allſo I know, that with all thy heart, thou art my friend: and ſince I haue beene bidden to day by the, it is but reaſon, that for to reward that which thou haſt done to me, I doe ſome ſeruice vnto thee, which ſhall be to giue vnto thee ſome good counſell: for ſtrangers vſe to pay for the feaſt with money, and vaine men with telling lyes, babblers by counting vaine tales, children by flatteries; but vertuous men ought to pay by giuing good Counſels. This houſe hath coſt thee much paine, great griefes, and much money, and if it coſt thee ſo much, it is but reaſon that thou enioy the ſame: take therefore theſe my three counſels, and it may be thou wilt find thy ſelfe better contented with thoſe, then with money of ſtrangers: for many haue wherewithall to build a houſe, but they haue not vnderſtanding to gouerne the ſame.
                     
                     The firſt counſell is, Though that Lucius Seneca his counſell. thou loue thy friend very well, or thy wife as well, yet that thou neuer diſcouer all the ſecrets of thy heart neither to thy friend, nor to thy wife: but that thou alwaies reſerue ſome particular vnto thy ſelfe: for Plato ſaith, to whome a man committeth his ſecrets, to him alſo hee giueth his libertie.
                     The ſecond counſel is, That neither in priuate buſineſſe, nor in publike affaires, thou occupy thy ſelfe ſo much, but at the leaſt thou doſt reſerue three houres in the day for thine owne reſt.
                     The third counſell is, That thou haue in thy houſe ſome ſecret place, wherof thou alone ſhalt haue the key, and therein thou ſhalt haue Bookes, where thou maiſt ſtudy of thy affaires, and alſo talke with thy friends. Finally, this place ſhall be a ſecretary of thy counſels, and a reſt for thy trauels.
                     Theſe were the words that Lucius Seneca ſpake to his friend Emilius Varro, which words were ſuch as he himſelfe was, that is to ſay, of a ſage and

excellent perſonage: and though the Banquet was rich, yet the payment of Lucius Seneca was much more worth: for the minde feeleth more taſte in the good and ripe counſell, then the body doeth in ſauory and delicate meates.
                     I haue told you this example of Lucius Seneca, for to tell another that happened to the Emperour Marcus Aurclius, with his wife Fauſtine. And to the end, that the order of the matter bee not turned without breaking our Hiſtorie, firſt we will declare here the order which this Emperour obſerued in his life: for the Common-wealth ſhall neuer be well gouerned, but where the Prince gouerneth well his life. Princes of neceſſitie ought to bee well ordered in this life, becauſe How vertuous Princes ought to be. they may profite the affayres of the Empire, with the particulars of their houſe: and becauſe they ſhould vſe the particulars of their houſe to the recreation of their Perſon: and all theſe things ought to bee deuided according to time: for a good Prince ought to lacke no time to doe that thing well which he hath to doe, nor ought hee to haue any time vacant to employ himſelfe to vice.
                     The worldly call that time good, the which is, or was proſperous vnto them: they call that time euill, which is, or hath beene contrary and vnfortunate vnto them.
                     The Creator will neuer that this ſentence bee approued by my penne: but I call that time good, which is imployed in vertues; and that time euill, that is loſt in vices: for the times are alwayes as one; but men do turne from vice to vertue, from vertue to vice.
                     The good Emperour, Marcus Aurelius, did deuide the time, by time: ſo, that though hee had time for himſelfe, he had time likewiſe to diſpatch his owne and others affayres: for the man that is willing, in a ſmall time diſpatcheth much buſineſſe: and the man which is negligent, in along time doth little.
                     This was the order that the Emperour Marcus Aurelius tooke in ſpending his time: He ſlept ſeuen houres in the night, and one houre reſted How the Emperour Marcus Aurclius ſpent his time. himſelfe in the day. In dining and ſupping, hee conſumed onely two houres; and it was not for that hee tooke great pleaſure to belong in eating; but becauſe the Philoſophers, which diſputed before his Preſence, were occaſion to prolong the time: for in ſeuenteene yeeres they neuer ſawe him at meate, but one or other read vnto him ſome Booke, or elſe the Philoſophers reaſoned before him Philoſophy. As he had many Realmes and Prouinces, ſo he appointed one houre for the affayres of Aſia, for Affricke one houre, and Europe another houre: and for the conuerſation of his wife, children, and familie, he appointed other two houres of time: hee had another houre for extraordinary affayres; as, to heare the complaints of the grieued, the quarrels of the poore, the complaints of the widdowes, and the robberies done to the orphanes: for the mercifull Prince giueth no leſſe care vnto the poore, which for want can doe little; then to the rich, which for abundance can do much. Hee occupied all the reſidue of the day and night to read Bookes, write works: to make meeter, and in ſtudying of other Antiquities, to practiſe with the Sage, &amp; to diſpute with the Philoſophers: and finally, he tooke no taſte of any thing ſo much, as hee did to talke of Science: Vnleſſe the cruell warres did let him, or ſuch like affayres troubled him, ordinarily in Winter he went to bed at nine of the clocke, and awaked at foure: and becauſe he would not be idle, he had alway a Booke vnder his beds head, and

the reſidue of the day hee beſtowed in reading.
                     The Romanes had an ancient cuſtome to beare fire before them: that is to ſay, a Torch light in the day, and A cuſtome among the Romanes. a Lampe burning in the night in their Chambers: ſo that waking, they burned Waxe; and ſleeping, they burned Oyle. And the cauſe why the Romanes ordeyned that the Oyle ſhould be made of Oliue, and the Waxe made of Bees (which was vſed to bee borne before the Princes) was to the end they ſhould remember, that they ought to bee as gentle and louing as the Oyle of Oliue is ſweete: and as profitable to the Common-wealth, as the Bees are.
                     Hee did riſe at ſixe of the clocke, and made himſelfe ready openly; and with a gentle countenance hee asked them that were about him, wherein they had ſpent all the night, and declared vnto them then what hee had dreamed, what he had thought, and what hee had read. When hee was readie, he waſhed his face with odoriferous waters, and loued very well ſweete ſauours: for hee had ſo quicke a ſent, that hee was much offended when hee paſſed through any ſtinking place.
                     In the morning he vſed to eate two morſels of a Lectuary made of Sticades, and dranke three ſpoonefulls of Malueſey, or elſe two droppes of Aqua vita, becauſe he had a cold ſtomacke, for that hee gaue himſelfe ſo much to ſtudie in times paſt. We ſee it by experience, that the great Students are perſecuted more with ſickneſſe then any others: for in the ſweetneſſe of the Science, they know not how their life conſumeth.
                     If it were in the Summer ſeaſon, hee went in the morning to recreate himſelfe to the Riuer of Tiberi, and walked there a foote for two houres; and in this place they talked with him that had buſineſſe: and truely it was a great policie; for, where as the Prince doth not ſit, the ſuitor alwaies abridgeth his talke. And when the day began to waxe hot, he went to the high Capitoll, where all the Senate tarryed for him: and from thence hee went to the Coliſeo, where the Ambaſſadours of the Prouinces were, and there remained a great part of the day. Afterwards he went to the Chappell of the Veſtall Virgins, and there he heard euery Nation by it ſelfe, according to the order which was preſcribed. Hee did eate but one meale in the day, and it was very late; but he did eate well: not of many and diuers ſorts of meate, but of few and good: for the abundance of diuers &amp; ſtrange meates breedeth ſundry diſeaſes.
                     They ſawe him once a weeke goe through Rome, and if hee went any more, it was a wonder: at the which time he was alwayes without company, both of his owne, and alſo of ſtrangers, to the entent all poore men might talke with him of their buſineſſe, or complaine of his Officers: for it is vnpoſſible to reforme the Common-wealth, if he which ought to remedie it, be not informed of the iniuries done in the ſame. He was ſo gentle in conuerſation, ſo pleaſant in words, ſo Noble amongſt the Great, ſo equall with the leaſt, ſo reaſonable in that hee did aske, ſo perfect in that he did worke, ſo patient in iniuries, ſo thankefull of benefites, ſo good to the good, and ſo ſeuere to the euill, that all loued him for being good, and all the euill feared him for being iuſt. A man ought not little to eſteeme the loue that the people bare to this ſo good a Prince and Noble Emperour, for ſo much as the Romanes haue been thus: that for the felicitie of their eſtate, they offered to their Gods greater Sacrifice, then they did in any other Prouinces.
                     
                        
And Sextus Cheronenſis ſaith, that the Romanes offered more Sacrifices to the Gods, becauſe they ſhould lengthen the life of the Emperour, then they did offer for the profite of the Common-wealth. Truely their reaſon was good; for the Prince that leadeth a good life, is the heart of the Common-wealth. But I doe not maruell, that the Emperour was ſo well willed, and beloued of the Romane Empire: for he had neuer Porter to his Chamber, but the two houres which hee remayned with his wife Fauſtine.
                     
                     All this being paſt, the good Emperour weat into his houſe, into the ſecretſt place hee had (according to the counſell of Lucius Seneca) the key whereof he alone had in his cuſtodie, and neuer truſted any man therewith, vntill the houre of his death; and then he gaue it to an olde ancient man called Pompeianus, ſaying vnto him theſe words:
                     
                        Thou knoweſt right well, Pompeianus, that, thou being baſe, I exalted thee 
                        The ſpeech of Marcus Aurelius at his death. 
                        to honour: thou being poore, I gaue thee riches: thou being perſecuted, I drew thee to my Palace: I being abſent, committed my whole honour to thy truſt: thou being olde, I marryed thee with my daughter, and doe preſently giue thee this Key.
                     
                     
                        Behold, that in giuing thee it, I giue thee my heart and life: for, I will thou know, that death grieueth mee not ſo much, nor the loſſe of my wife and children, as that I cannot carry my Bookes into the graue. If the Gods had giuen mee the choyſe, I had rather chooſe to be in the graue inuironed with Bookes, then to liue accompanied with fooles: for, if the dead doe read, I take them to be aline; but if the liuing doe not read, I take them to be dead.
                     
                     
                        Vnder this key which I giue thee, remayneth many Greeke, Hebrew, Latine, and Romame Bookes: and aboue all, vnder this key remaineth all my paynes, ſwet, and trauells, all my watchings, and laboures, where alſo thou ſhalt finde Bookes by mee compiled: ſo that though the wormes of the earth doe eate my body; yet men ſhall finde my heart whole amongſt theſe Bookes.
                     
                     
                        Once againe I doe require thee, and ſay, that thou oughteſt not a little to eſteeme the key which I giue thee: for wiſe men at the houre of their death, alwayes recommend that which they beſt loue, to them which in their liues they haue moſt loued.
                     
                     I doe confeſſe, that in my Studie thou ſhalt finde many things with mine owne hand written and well ordered: and alſo I confeſſe, that thou ſhalt finde many things by me left vnperfect. In this caſe, I thinke, that though thou couldeſt not write them, yet thou ſhalt worke them well notwithſtanding; and by theſe meanes thou ſhalt get reward of the Gods for working them.
                     
                     
                        Conſider, Pompeian, that I haue beene thy Lord, I haue beene thy Father-in-law, I haue beene thy Father, I haue beene thy Aduocate, and aboue all, that I haue beene thy ſpeciall friend, which is moſt of all: for a man ought to eſteeme more a faithfull friend, then all the Parents of the world.
                     
                     
                        Therefore in the faith of that friendſhippe I require, that thou keepe this in memorie, that euen as I haue recommended to others my Wife, my Children, my Goods, and Riches: So I doe leaue vnto thee in ſinguler recommendation my Honour: for Princes leaue of themſelues no greater memorie, then by the good learning that they haue written.
                     
                     I haue beene eighteene yeeres Emperour of Rome; and it is threeſcore and three yeeres that I haue remayned in this wofull life, during which time I haue ouercome many Battailes, I haue ſlayne many Pyrates, I

                        haue exalted many good, I haue puniſhed many euill, I haue wonne many Realmes, and I haue deſtroyed many Tyrants: but what ſhall I doe, wofull man that I am, ſith all my companions, which were witneſſes with me of all theſe worthy feates, ſhall be companions in the graue with the greedy wormes?
                     
                     
                        A thouſand yeeres hence, when thoſe that are now aliue ſhall then be dead, what is hee that ſhall ſay, I ſaw Marcus Aurelius triumph ouer the Parthians: I ſaw him make the buildings in Auentino: I ſawe him well beloued of the people: I ſaw him father of the Orphanes: I ſaw him the ſcourge of Tyrants? Truely if all theſe things had not beene declared by my Bookes, or of my friends, the dead would neuer haue riſen againe to haue declared them.
                     
                     
                        What is it for to ſee a Prince (from the time he is borne, vntill the time hee come to dye) to ſee the pouertie he paſſeth, the perills he endureth, the euill that hee ſuffereth, the ſhame that he diſſembleth, the friendſhippe that hee fayneth, the teares which hee ſheddeth, the ſighes that hee fetcheth, the promiſes that hee maketh, and doth not endure for any other cauſe the miſeries of this life: but onely to leaue a memorie of him after his death.
                     
                     
                        There is no Prince in the world that deſireth not to keepe a good houſe, to keepe a good table, to apparell himſelfe richly, and to pay thoſe that ſerue him in his houſe: but by this vaine honour, they ſuffer the water to paſſe through their lippes, not drinking thereof.
                     
                     
                        As one that hath proued it, it is reaſon that I bee beloued in this caſe, and that is, That the entent of Princes to conquere ſtrange Realmes, and to permit their owne to ſuffer wrongs, is for no other thing, but becauſe that the commendations which they ſpeake of the Princes paſt, they ſhould likewiſe talke the ſame of them that bee to come.
                     
                     
                        Concluding therefore my minde, and declaring my intention, I ſay, that the Prince that is Noble, and deſireth to leaue off himſelfe from fame, let him conſider, and ſee what it is that thoſe can write of him which write his hiſtory: for it profiteth little, that hee atchieue great affayres by the ſword, if there bee no Writer to ſet them forth with the pen, and afterwards to exalt them with the tongue.
                     
                     Theſe words thus ſpoken by the Noble Emperour Marcus Aurelius, he gaue the key of his Studie to the Honourable olde man Pompeianus, that tooke all the Writings, and put them in the high Capitoll, where the Romanes honoured them, as the Chriſtians the holy Scriptures. All theſe Writings, beſides many others, periſhed in Rome, when by the barbarous it was deſtroyed: for the Gothes (vtterly to extinguiſh the name of Rome) deſtroyed not onely the walles Rome deſtroyed by the Gothes. thereof, but alſo the Bookes that were therein: And truely in this caſe the Gothes ſhewed more crueltie to the Romanes, then if they had ſlayne the children of their bodyes, or beate downe the walles of their Cities: For, without doubt, the liuely Letter is a more ſweeter witneſſe of renowme, that alwayes ſpeaketh; then eyther the Lime, Sand, or Stone, wherewith Fortreſſes are builded.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XIIII. Of the importunate ſuite of the Empreſſe Fauſtine, to the Emperour Marcus Aurelius, concerning the Key of his Cloſet.
                     
                     
                        WE haue declared, how the Emperour Marcus Aurelius had his Study in the ſecretſt

place of all the Palace, and how that he himſelfe did keepe the key. It is to be vnderſtood, that hee would neuer let his wife, his children, nor any other of his familiar friends come into it: for he ſayd, I had rather ſuffer that they ſhould take from mee my treaſures, then that any man ſhould turne the leaues of my Bookes.
                     It chanced, that on a day the Empreſſe Fauſtine, being great with childe, importuned the Emperour much, by all the meanes ſhee could, that he would be ſo fauourable vnto her, as to giue her the key of his Studie: and it is no maruell, for naturally women deſpiſe that which is giuen thē, &amp; luſt for that that is denied them.
                     
                        Fauſtine inſtantly beſought him, not once, but many times, not onely with faire words, but with abundant teares, alleadging vnto him theſe reaſons: I haue required thee ſundry times, that thou wouldeſt giue mee the key of thy chamber, and thou haſt by ieſting made fruſtrate my requeſt, the which thou (my Lord) oughteſt not to haue done, conſidering that I am with childe: for oftentimes it chanceth, that that wherefore the huſband reioyceth this day, to morrow he doth lament.
                     Thou oughteſt to remember that I am that Fauſtine the renowmed, the which in thy eyes am the fayreſt, and of thy tongue haue beene moſt commended, of thy perſon I was beſt beloued, and of thy heart I am moſt deſired: then ſince it is true, that thou haſt me ſo deepely in heart, why then doubteſt thou to ſhew mee the Writings of thy Studie. Thou doſt communicate with mee the ſecrets of the Empire, and thou hideſt from me the books of thy ſtudy. Thou haſt giuen me thy tender heart of fleſh, and now thou denyeſt mee the hard key of iron: now I muſt needs thinke that thy loue was fayned, that thy words were double, and that thy thoughts, were others then they ſeemed: for if they had been otherwiſe, it had been vnpoſſible thou ſhouldeſt haue denyed mee the key that I doe aske thee; for where loue is vnfayned, though the requeſt bee merrily asked, yet it is willingly graunted.
                     It is a common cuſtome, that you men vſe to deceiue vs ſimple women, you preſent vs with great gifts, you giue many fayre words, you make vs faire promiſes, you ſay you will doe maruels, but in the ende you doe nothing but deceiue vs: for we are perſecuted more of you, thē of any others.
                     When men in ſuch wiſe importune the women, if the women had The importunity of the Empreſſe. power to deny and withſtand, wee ſhould in ſhort ſpace bring yee vnder the yoke, and leade you by the noſes: but when we ſuffer our ſelues to be ouercome, then you beginne to forſake vs, and deſpiſe vs. Let mee therefore (my Lord) ſee thy Chamber, conſider I am with childe, and that I dye vnleſſe I ſee it. If thou doſt not to doe me pleaſure, yet doe it, at leaſt, becauſe I may no more importune thee: for if I come in danger through this my longing, I ſhall but loſe my life: but thou ſhalt loſe the childe that ſhould be borne, and the mother alſo that ought to beare it.
                     I know not why thou ſhouldeſt put thy noble heart into ſuch a dangerous fortune, wherby both thou &amp; I at one time ſhuldperiſh; I dying ſo yōg, and thou in loſing ſo louing a wife.
                     By the immortall Gods I doe beſeech thee, and by the mother Berecinthia I coniure thee, that thou giue me the key, or that thou let me enter into the Study; and ſtick not with me thy wife in this my ſmall requeſt, but change thy opinion: for al that which without conſideration is ordayned, by importunate ſuite may bee reuoked. We ſee daily that mē by reading

in Bookes, loue their children; but I neuer ſawe heart of man fall in ſuch ſort, that by reading and looking in Bookes, hee ſhould deſpiſe his children: for in the ende, Bookes are by the words of others made; but children are with their own proper bloud begotten.
                     Before that any thing of wiſedome is begunne, they alwaies regard the inconueniences that may follow: therefore if thou wilt not giue mee this key, and that thou art determined to be ſtubborne ſtill in thy will, thou ſhalt loſe thy Fauſtine, thou ſhalt loſe ſo louing a wife, thou ſhalt loſe the creature wherewith ſhe is bigge, thou ſhalt loſe the authoritie of thy Palace, thou ſhalt giue occaſion to all Rome to ſpeake of thy wickedneſſe, and this griefe ſhall neuer depart from thy heart: for the heart ſhall neuer bee comforted, that knoweth, that he only is the occaſion of his owne griefe. If the Gods doe ſuffer it by their ſecret indgements, and if my wofull miſhappes deſerue it, and if thou (my Lord) deſireſt it for no other cauſe, but euen to doe after thy will, for denying me this key, I ſhould dye: I would willingly dye. But of that, I thinke, thou wilt repent: for it chanceth often times to wiſe men, That when remedy is gone, the repentance commeth ſuddenly: and then it is to late (as they ſay) to ſhutte the Stable doore, when the Steede is ſtolne.
                     
                     I maruell much at thee (my Lord) why thou ſhouldeſt ſhew thy ſelfe ſo froward in this caſe, ſince thou knoweſt, that all the time wee haue beene together, thy will and mine hath alway beene one! If thou wilt not giue me thy key, for that I am thy welbeloued Fauſtine: if thou wilt not let mee haue it, ſince I am thy deare beloued wife: if thou wilt not giue it me, for that I am great with childe, I beſeech thee giue it mee in vertue of the ancient law: for thou knoweſt it is an inuiolate lawe among the Romanes, that a man cannot deny his wife with child A law aamong the Romane. her deſires. I haue ſeene ſundry times with mine eyes, many women ſue their husbands at the lawe in this behalfe: and thou (my Lord) commandeſt, that a man ſhould not break the priuiledges of women.
                     Then if this thing bee true (as it is true indeede) why wilt thou that the lawes of ſtrange children ſhould bee kept, and that they ſhould be broken to thine owne children? Speaking according to the reuerence that I owe vnto thee, though thou wouldeſt, I will not; though thou doeſt it, I will not agree therunto: &amp; though thou doſt command it, in this caſe I will not obey thee: for if the huſband doe not accept the iuſt requeſt of his wife, the wife is not bound to obey the vniuſt commaundement of her husband.
                     You husbands deſire that your wiues ſhould ſerue you, you deſire that your wiues ſhould obey you in all, and ye will condiſcend to nothing that they deſire. You men ſay, that wee women haue no certaintie in our loue: but indeede you haue no loue at all: For by this it appeareth, that your loue is fayned, in that it no longer continueth then your deſires are ſatisfied.
                     You ſay furthermore, that the women are ſuſpitious, and that is true in you all, men may ſee, and not in vs: for none other cauſe there are are ſo many euill marryed in Rome, but becauſe their husbands haue of them ſuch euill opinions.
                     There is a great difference betweene the ſuſpition of the woman, and the jealouſie of the man: for a man will vnderſtand the ſuſpition of the woman; it is no other thing, but to ſhew to her husband that ſhe loueth him with all her heart:

for the innocent women know no others, deſire no others but their huſbands onely; and they would that their husbands ſhould know none others, nor ſearch for any others, nor loue any others, nor will any others, but them onely: for the heart that is bent to loue one only, would not that into that houſe ſhould euter any other.
                     But you men know ſo many means, and vſe ſo many ſubtilties, that you praiſe your ſelues for to offend them, you vaunt your ſelues to deceiue them, and that it is true, a man can in nothing ſo much ſhew his noblenes, as to ſuſtaine and fauour a Curtizan.
                     The husbands pleaſe their wiues ſpeaking vnto thē ſome merry words, and immediately, their backes being turned, to another they giue both their bodies and their goods. I ſweare vnto thee (my Lord) that if women had the libertie and authoritie ouer men, as men haue ouer women, they ſhould finde more malice, deceitfulneſſe and craft by them committed in one day, then they ſhould find in the women all the dayes of their life.
                     You men ſay, that women are euill ſpeakers, it is true indeede that your tongues are none other, but the ſtings of Serpents: for yee doe condemne the good men, and defame the Romane women. And thinke not (if you ſpeake euill of other women) to excuſe your owne: for the man that by his tongue diſhonoureth ſtrange What euill commeth by the tong. women, doth not ſo much euill, as he doth by defaming his owne wife by ſuſpition: for the husband that ſuſpecteth his wife, giueth all men licence to account her for naught.
                     Sith wee women goe little out of the houſe, wee trauaile not farre: and ſith wee ſee few things, though wee would, wee cannot bee euill tongued: But you men heare much, you ſee much, you know much, you wander abroad much, and continually you murmure.
                     All the euill that wee ſilly women can doe, is to liſten to our friendes when they are vexed, to chide our ſeruants when they are negligent, to enuy our neighbours if they be fayre, and to curſe thoſe that doe vs iniurie: finally, though wee ſpeake euill, wee cannot murmure, but at thoſe that dwell in the ſame Streete where wee dwell. But you men defame your wiues by ſuſpition, you diſhonour your neighbours in your words, you ſpeake againſt ſtrangers with crueltie, you neyther keepe faith nor promiſe to your wiues, you ſhew your ſelues extreme againſt your enemies, you murmure both at thoſe that bee preſent, and alſo at them that be abſent: finally, on the one part you are ſo double, and on the other part you are ſo vnthankefull, that to thoſe whom you deſire, you make fayre promiſes, and thoſe, whoſe bodies you haue enioyed, you little eſteeme.
                     I confeſſe that the woman is not ſo good as ſhee ought to bee, and that it is neceſſary that ſhe ſhould be kept What is required in a Woman. in the houſe, and ſo ſhee ſhall leade a good life; and being of good life, ſhe ſhall haue good renowme; and hauing good renowme, ſhee ſhall bee well willed: but if chaunce any of thoſe doe want in her, yet for all that ſhee ought not to bee reiected of her husband: For the fraileneſſe that men finde in women is but little: but the euils that women taſte in men is very great.
                     I haue talked longer then I thought, and haue ſaide more boldly then I ought, but pardon me (my Lord) for my intention was not to vex thee, but to perſwade thee: for in the end he is a foole that taketh that for iniury, which paſſeth betweene the man and the wife in ſecret.
                     I ſtick alwaies to my firſt point, &amp; if

it neede, once againe I require thee that thou wilt giue me the Key of thy ſtudie: and if thou doe otherwiſe, (as thou mayeſt) thou ſhalt doe ſuch a thing, as thou oughteſt not to doe. I am not angry ſo much for that thou doeſt, as for the occaſion thou giueſt me.
                     Therefore to auoyde the perill of my deliuerie, and to take from me all ſuſpition, I pray thee (my Lord) deliuer me the key of thy ſtudie: for otherwiſe I cannot be perſwaded in my hart, but that you haue a woman locked in your ſtudie. For men that in their youth haue beene vnconſtant, though the apparell that they haue be not worne, yet notwithſtanding they deſire to haue new. Therefore once againe to preſerue mee from perill in my deliuery, and to lighten my heart of this thought, it ſhall be well done that you let mee enter into your ſtudie.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XV. ¶ The Aunſwere of the Emperour to Fauſtine, concerning her demand of the key of the Studie.
                     
                     
                        THe Emperor hearing the wordes of Fauſtine, and ſeeing that ſhee ſpake them ſo earneſtly, that ſhee bathed her woefull words with bitter teares, determined alſo to anſwere her as earneſtly, and ſaide vnto her theſe wordes.
                     
                        Wife Fauſtine, thou haſt tolde mee all that thou wouldeſt, and I haue hearde all 
                        The Emperours anſwere. 
                        thy complaint. Therefore I deſire thee now to haue as much patience to heare my aunſwere, as I haue had paine to heare thy demaund. And prepare thy eares to heare my words, as I haue liſtned mine to heare thy Follie. For in like matter, when the tong doth apply it ſelfe to ſpeake any word, the eares ought immediately to prepare them to heare it, for to make aunſwere. For this is moſt ſure, that he that ſpeaketh what hee would, ſhall heare what hee would not. Before I tell thee what thou art, and what thou oughteſt to bee, I will firſt tell thee what I am, and what I ought to be: For I will thou vnderſtand Fauſtine, that I am ſo euill, that that the which mine enemyes doe report of me is but a trifle in reſpect of that which my Familiars and Friends would ſay if they knew me. To the end the Prince be good, hee ought not to be couetous of Tributes, neyther proude in commaundements, nor 
                        What is required of euery Man, 
                        vnthankfull of ſeruices, nor to be forgetfull of the Temples: hee ought not to be deafe to heare griefes, complaintes, and quarrells, nor cruell to Orphanes, nor yet negligent in affaires. And the man that ſhall want theſe vices, ſhalbe both beloued of men, and fauoured of the Gods.
                     
                     
                        I confeſſe firſt of all that I haue bin couetous. For indeed thoſe which with many troubles annoy Princes leaſt, and with Money ſerue them moſt, are of all other men beſt beloued.
                     
                     
                        Secondarily, I confeſſe that I am proud: For there is no Prince at this day in the world ſo brought vnder, but when Fortune is moſt loweſt, he hath his heart very hanghtie.
                     
                     
                        Thirdly, I confeſſe that I am vnthankfull: for amongſt vs that are Princes, the ſeruices that they doe vnto vs are great, and the rewardes that we giue vnto them are ſmall.
                     
                     
                        Fourthly, I doe confeſſe that I am an euill founder of Temples: for amongſt vs that are Princes, wee doe not Sacrifice vnto the Gods very often, vnleſſe it be when we ſee our ſelues to be enuironned with enemyes.
                     
                     
                        Fiftly, I confeſſe that I am negligent to heare the plaintes of the oppreſſed: for the Flatterers haue towards theys Princes more eaſie audience by their Flattery,
                        
                        then the poore, pleading to declare theyr complaintes by truth.
                     
                     
                        Sixtly, I confeſſe that I am careleſſe for the Orphanes: For in the Courtes and Pallaces of Princes the Rich and mightie are moſt familiar; but the miſerable and poore Orphanes are ſcarcely heard.
                     
                     
                        Seuenthly, I confeſſe that I am negligent in diſpatching Poore mens cauſes: For the Princes oft times, not prouiding in time for their affaires, many great perills enſue to theyr Realmes.
                     
                     Now marke here Fauſtine: how I haue tolde thee, what (according to reaſon) I ought to bee, and what according to the ſenſualitie I am: and maruell not although I confeſſe mine error. For the man that acknowledgeth his fault, giueth hope of amendment. And let vs come to talke of thee, and by that I haue ſpoken of me, thou mayeſt iudge of thy ſelfe: For we men are ſo euill conditioned, that we behold the vttermoſt the offences of an another, but wee will not heare the faultes of our ſelues. It is a true thing my wife Fauſtine, that when a woman is merry, ſhe alwaies ſpeaketh more with her tong, then ſhee knoweth in her heart. For women light of tongue ſpeak many things in companie, the which they doe lament after when they are alone. All the contrarie commeth to wofull men, for they do not ſpeak the halfe of their griefes: becauſe their heauy and wofull hearts commaundeth their eyes to weepe, and tongs to be ſilent.
                     Vaine and fooliſh men, by vaine and fooliſh words doe publiſh their vaine What hurt commeth by not gouerning the tongue. and light pleaſures: and the wiſe men by wiſe wordes, doe diſſemble their grieuous ſorrowes. For though they feale the troubles of this life, they diſſemble them as men. Amongſt the Sages hee is moſt wiſeſt, that preſumeth to know leaſt: and amongſt the ſimple he is moſt ignorant, that thinketh to knowe moſt. For if there be found one that knoweth much, yet alwayes there is found another that knoweth more.
                     This is one difference whereby the wiſe men are knowne from thoſe that be ſimple, that is to ſay: That the wiſe man to one that asketh him a Queſtion, anſwereth ſlowly and grauely, and the ſimple man (though he be not aſked) aunſwereth quicke and lightly. For in the houſe where Noblenes and wiſedome are, they giue riches without meaſure, but they giue wordes by ounces. I haue told thee all this Fauſtine, becauſe thy wordes haue wounded me in ſuch ſort, thy teares in ſuch wiſe haue compelled mee, and thy vaine iudgements haue wearyed mee ſo much, that I cannot ſay what I would, nor I thinke thou canſt perceiue what I ſay? Thoſe which wrote of Marriage, wrote many things, but they wrote not ſo many troubles in al their bookes, as one woman cauſeth her Husband to feele in one day.
                     The auncients ſpake well, when they reaſoned of Marriages: for at all times when they talked of Marriage, at the beginning they put theſe words Croſſes incident to Marriage. 
                        Onus Matrimonij: That is to ſay, the yoake of Marriage. For truely if the man be not well maryed, all the troubles that may happen vnto him, in all the time of his life, are but ſmall in reſpect to be matched one day with an euill wife.
                     Doeſt thou thinke Fauſtine, that it is a ſmall trouble for the Husband to ſuffer ths brawlings of his wife? to indure her vaine words? to beare with her fond words? to giue her what ſhe requireth? to ſeeke that ſhe deſireth? and to diſſemble with all her vanities? Truely it is ſo vnpatient a trouble, that I would not deſire any greater reuengement of my enemy, then to ſee him marryed with a brawling wife.
                     If the Husband be proud, you doe humble him: For there is no proude

man, whatſoeuer hee be, but a fierce woman will make him ſtoupe. If the Husband be fooliſh, you reſtore him to his ſenſes againe: For there is no greater wiſedome in the World, then to knowe how to endure a brawling woman. If the Husband be wilde, you make him tame: For the time is ſo much that you occupy in brawling that hee can haue no time to ſpeake. If the husband be ſlow, you make him runne: for he deſireth ſo much your contentation in heart, that the wofull man cannot eate in quiet, nor ſleepe in reſt. If the Husband be a talker, you make him dumbe: for the flouts and mockes that you giue him at euery word are ſo many in number, that he hath none other remedie, but to refraine his tongue.
                     If the Husband bee ſuſpitious, you make him change his minde: For the Trifles that you aske at euery houre are ſuch, and ſo many, and you therewith ſo ſelfe-willed, that hee dare not tell what hee ſeeth in his owne houſe. If the husband be a wanderer abroad, you make him forthwith a bider at home: for you looke ſo ill vnto the houſe and goods, that hee findeth no other remedie but to bee alwayes at home. If the Husband bee vicious, you reſtraine him immediately: for you burden his heart with ſo manie thoughts, that his bodie hath no delight to vſe any pleaſure. Finally, (I ſay) that if the husband be peaceable, within ſhort ſpace you make him vnquiet: for your paines are ſuch, ſo many, and ſo continuall, that there is no heart can wholly diſſemble them, nor Tongue that vtterly can keepe them ſecret.
                     Naturally women haue in all things the ſpirite of contradiction, for ſo What women naturally are inclined vnto. much as if the Husbands will ſpeake, they will holde their peace. If he go forth, they will tarrie at home: if he will laugh, they will weepe: if hee will take pleaſure they will vexe him. If he be ſorrowfull, they will be merie. If he deſire peace, they would haue war. If he would eate, they will faſt, if hee would faſt, they would eate. If hee would ſleepe, they will watche: and if hee will watche, they will ſleepe. Finally I ſay, that they are of ſo euill a condition, that they loue all that we deſpiſe, and deſpiſe all that we loue.
                     In mine opinion, the men that are wiſe, and will obtaine that which they deſire of their wiues: Let them not demaunde of them that which they would obtaine, if they will come to obtaine their deſire. For vnto them which are diſeaſed, the letting of Bloud is moſt profitable, when the veyne in the contrary ſide is opened. It is no other thing to be let bloud in the cōtrary ſide, but to ask of the woman with his mouth, the contrarie of that which he deſireth with his heart: for otherwiſe, neyther by faire words of his mouth, nor by the bitter teares of his eyes, he ſhal neuer obtaine that which his heart deſireth.
                     I confeſſe Fauſtine, it is a pleaſant ſport to behold the young babes, and thou canſt not denie mee, but it is a cruell torment to endure the importunities of their Mothers. Children now and then miniſter vnto vs occaſions of pleaſures, but you that are theyr Mothers neuer doe any thing, but that which turneth vs to trouble.
                     It is much pleaſure to the Husband when he commeth home to finde the houſe cleane ſwept, to find the Table couered, and to finde the meate ready dreſſed: this is to be vnderſtood, if all other things be well.
                     But what ſhall we ſay when he ſeeth the contrarie: and that he findeth his children weeping, his, neighbours offended, his Seruants troubled, and aboue all, when hee findeth his Wife brawling? Truly it is better to the wofull Husband, to goe his way faſting:

then to tarrie and eate at home with brawling. I durſt take vppon mee to cauſe that all marryed men would be content to forbeareal the pleaſures of the Children, with condition that they might be Free from the annoyance of the Mothers: for in the ende the pleaſures of the children endeth quickly with laughter, but the griefes of the mothers endureth all their life with ſorrow. I haue ſeene one thing in Rome, wherein I was neuer deceyued, which is, that though men commit great offences in this World, yet God deferreth the puniſhment thereof vntill another: But if for any womans pleaſure we commit any faulte, God permitteth that by the ſame woman, in this world we ſhall ſuffer the paine. There is no crueller enemy to to man, nor more troublesſome to liue withall, then the woman is that hee keepeth in his houſe: for if hee ſuffer her once to haue her owne will, then let him be aſſured neuer after to bring her vnto obedience.
                     The young men of Rome follow the Ladies of Capua, but they may well repent them: For there was neuer man that haunted of any long time the company of womē, but in the end to their procurement, either by death or with infamie he was defaced. For the Gods eſteeme the Honour aboue all things, and as they ſuffer the wickedneſſe of the euill men, ſo wee ſee the ſharpe puniſhments that they ordaine for them.
                     I am well aſſured Fauſtine of one thing (and I do not ſpeake it by heare ſay,) but becauſe continually I haue prooued it, and it is, that the Husband which condiſcendeth to all that the Wife deſireth, cauſeth his wife to do nothing of that her husband commaundeth. For there is nothing that keepeth a woman more vnder obedience to her Husband, then when oftē
                        times he denyeth with ſharpe words, her vnlawfull requeſt.
                     In my opinion it is much crueltie of the barbarous, to keepe (as they doe) theyr wiues like ſlaues: but it is much more follie of the Romaines, to keepe them (as they doe,) like Ladies. The fleſh ought not to bee ſo leane that it be in eating drie, nor yet ſo fatte that there be no leane: but it would participate both of the fatte and of the leane, to the intent it might giue the more nouriſhment. I meane, that the man of vnderſtanding ought not to keepe his Wife ſo ſhort, that ſhee ſhould ſeeme to be his ſeruant, nor yet to giue her ſo much libertie, that ſhe becometh his Miſtreſſe. For the Huſband that ſuffereth his Wife to commaund more then ſhee ought, is the cauſe why hee himſelfe afterwardes is not eſteemed as he ſhould be.
                     I Behold Fauſtine, you women are in all things ſo extreame, that for a little fauour you waxe proude: and for a little diſpleaſure you become great enemies.
                     There is no Woman that willingly Women can not endure to haue ſuperiours. can ſuffer to haue any ſuperiour, nor yet ſcarcely can endure to haue any equall: for we ſee that you loue not the higheſt, nor deſire to be loued of the loweſt. For where the louers bee not equall, there their loue cannot be perfect. I knowe well Fauſtine, that thou doeſt not vnderſtand mee, therefore harken what I doe tell thee more then thou thinkeſt, and more then thou wouldeſt.
                     O what and how many women haue I ſeene in Rome, the which thogh they had two thouſand pound of Rent in their heads, yet they had three thouſand follyes in their heads: and the worſt of all is, that oft times her Huſband dyeth, and ſhe looſeth her Rent, yet for all that ceaſeth not her follie. Now liſten Fauſtine, and I wil tell thee more. All women will ſpeake, and they will that others be ſilent. All wil

commaund, and will not that they be commanded, and they will that all be captiues to them. All will gouerne, and will not be gouerned.
                     Finally, they all in this one thing agree, and that is, that they wil cheriſh them that they loue, &amp; reuenge them of thoſe that they hate. Of that which before is ſaid it may be gathered, that they make Fooles and Slaues of the young and vaine men which followe them, and perſecute the Wiſe men, as enemies that flye them. For in the ende where they loue vs moſte, their loue may bee meaſured: but where as they hate vs leaſt, their hate exceedeth reaſon.
                     In the Annales of Pompeius I remember I haue read, and do note one thing worthie of knowledge, that Annales of Pompeyus. when Pompeius the Great paſſed firſt into Aſia, as by chaunce hee came by the mountaines of Rypheos, he found in thoſe places a Barbarous nation, that liued in the ſharpe mountains as wild beaſts: and doe not maruell that I do call them beaſtly, that liue in thoſe mountaines. For as the ſheepe and Cowes that feede on the fine graſſe, haue their wooll ſofte and fine, ſo the men who are brought vp in the ſharp and wilde mountains, vſe themſelues after a rude behauiour.
                     Theſe Barbarous had therefore a law among them, that euery neighbor had in thoſe mountaines two Caues: for the ſharpnes of the hills permitted A Law among the Barbarians. not that they ſhold haue any Houſes. Therfore in one caue the Husbands, the Sonnes, and the Seruants were: and in the other his Wife, his daughters, and his handmaids abode: they did eate together twice in the weeke, they ſlept together other twice in the weeke, and all the reſidue of the time they were ſeparate the one from the other. The great Pompeyus asked them what was the cauſe why they liued ſo? ſith it was ſo, that in all the world there was neuer ſeene nor read of ſuch extreame law, nor ſo ſtraunge a cuſtome.
                     The hiſtorie ſaith in that place, that an auncient man aunſwered him, ſaying: Beholde Pompeius, that the gods haue giuen ſhort life vnto vs that bee preſent, in reſpect of that which hee gaue to our Fathers that are paſt: and ſince we liue but fortie or fiftie yeares at the vttermoſt, wee deſire to enioy thoſe dayes in peace: For the life is ſo ſhort, and our trouble ſo long that we haue ſmal time to reioyce in peace after we returne from the warres.
                     It is true that amongſt you Romaines which enioy pleaſures and riches, life ſeemeth too ſhorte, but vnto vs that haue toyle with pouertie, life ſeemeth too long: For throughout all the yeare wee neuer keepe ſuch ſolemne Feaſts, as when one paſſeth out of his life.
                     Conſider Pompeius that if men liued many yeares, there ſhold be time to laugh and weepe, to bee good and to be euill, to be poore and to be rich, to be merrie and ſad, to liue in peace and warre: but why wil men ſeek contention in their life, ſince it is ſo ſhort?
                     In keeping with vs (as you doe) our owne wiues, in liuing wee ſhould die, for the nights ſhould paſſe in hearing their complaints, and the dayes in ſuffering their brawlings: but keeping them as we doe, we ſee not their heauie countenance, wee heare not the crying of our children, wee heare not their grieuous complaintes, nor liſten vnto their ſorrowfull words, neyther wee are troubled with their importunate ſuites, and yet the Children are nouriſhed in peace, &amp; the father followeth the warres: ſo that they are well, and we are better. This was the aunſwer that this old man gaue, at the requeſt of the great Pompeius,
                     
                     Truely Fauſtine I ſay, that though wee call the Meſſagetes Barbarous, in

this caſe they know more then the Latines. For he that is free from a brawling woman, hath eſcaped no ſmall peſtilence.
                     I aske thee now Fauſtine, ſince thoſe barbarous could not agree, nor would not haue their wiues with thē in thoſe ſharpe mountains, how ſhall we other agree and pleaſe you that liue in theſe pleaſures in Rome? One thing I will tell thee Fauſtine, and I beſeech the Gods that thou maieſt vnderſtand it, which is. If the beaſtly motions of the Fleſh did not-force men to will, and alſo to deſire women, I doubt whether there ſhould be any woman in the world beloued or ſuffered. For though nature giueth them gifts worthie to be beloued: yet they through their ſmal diſcretion cauſe themſelues to bee hated. If the gods had made this loue voluntarie, as they made it naturall, ſo that we might haue loued as wee would, and left againe at our pleaſure: that man ought worthily to haue beene puniſhed, which for the loue of any woman would put his life in daunger. The Gods haue kept this great ſecret vnto themſelues, and the miſery that they gaue vnto men is very great: ſince that vnto ſo weake Fleſh, hee gaue ſo ſtrong a heart, the which doth procure that which doth vs harme, and followeth that which we ought to abhorre.
                     This is an other ſecret, that all men know when they offend, but I ſee no man that ſeeketh amendment: for I heare all complaine of the fleſh, and yet I ſee all like Butchers followe the fleſh: and when it can do leaſt good, then it is moſt greedie. I enuie not the Gods liuing, nor the men that be dead, ſaue only for two things, which be theſe.
                     Firſt, I enuie the Gods, becauſe they liue without feare of the malicious: Secondarily, I enuie the dead, for that they liue without neede of Women. For Women are ſo corrupt, that the corrupt all: and they be ſuch mortall plagues, that both fleſh and heart by them are brought to ende.
                     O Fauſtine, the loue of the fleſh is ſo natural to the fleſh, that when from you the body flyeth in ſport, wee then leaue our hearts engaged to you in earneſt. And thogh reaſon as reaſon putteth deſire to fleight, yet the fleſh fleſh, yeeldeth it ſelfe as priſoner.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXVI. ¶ The Emperour following his matter admoniſheth men of the great daungers which enſue vnto them by exceſſiue haunting the company of women. And reciteth certaine rules for Marryed men, which (if they obſerue) may cauſe them to liue in peace with their Wiues.
                     
                     
                        I Remember that in my youth, as I was of Fleſh, I trembled for ſeare of the fleſh, with minde neuer to returne againe, and I do confeſſe that ofte times I reuolued in my heart, many holie and chaſte meditations: but yet notwithſtanding, I gaue my bodie immediately to ſundry filthie vices.
                     It is a naturall thing, that when man hath committed any vice, forthwith he repenteth him of his deede: and The frailty of man. ſo againe after his new repentance, he turneth to his olde vices.
                     For during the time that wee liue in this fraile fleſh, Senſualitie beareth ſo great a rule, that ſhee will not ſuffer Reaſon to enter in, at the gate. There is no man in Rome, (if a man doth aske him) but wil maruelto declare with his tongue the thoughts that he hath had in his heart, in eſpecially to be chaſte, to be true, to be pacient,

and to bee vertuous, and peraduenture ye talke with thoſe that ſomewhat communicate with them, and let a man enquire of his neighbours' they ſhall finde that he is a deeyuer' a lyar, and a blaſphemer. Finally, they deceyue men by their faire wordes, and offended the Gods, by their euill works.
                     It profiteth little to Blaze vertues with wordes, if the hand be negligent to worke them in deede: For a man is not called iuſt, onely deſiring to be good in name, but for to labour to be vertuous in workes.
                     The trayterous Worlde in no one thing beguileth wordlings ſo much, as by feeding them with vaine hope: ſaying, That they ſhall haue time enough to be vertuous; So that theſe The cauſe why men ought to endeauor to be vertuous blinde men, when they are once deeply rooted in vices, and whileſt they hope for this light of amendment, then ſuddainly aſſaulteth them the dreadfull dart of death.
                     Oh how many haue promiſed vnto men, and vowed vnto the Gods, and determined with themſelues, that before ſo many dayes they would begin to be vertuous? whom in ſhort ſpace after wee haue ſeene to engage themſelues to the hungrie wormes of the earth? The Gods will that we be vertuous: and for the contrarie, the world and the fleſh willeth that wee be vicious.
                     Mee thinketh that it is better to obey the Gods, then to doe that which the World and the Fleſh deſireth: for the praiſe of vertue is honour, and the paine of vice is infamie. If thou doſt cōſider Fauſtine, thou ſhalt ſee that the Gods are on the one part, which procureth vs to vertues, and on the other part is the world and the fleſh, which enticeth vs vnto vices. My opinion is we ſhould ſay vnto the Gods that we deſire to bee veriuous, and that wee ſhould ſay to the world and the fleſh, that from henceforth we will giue our ſelues no more to be vicious.
                     We ought in ſuch caſe to ſatisfie the Gods with works, &amp; to entertaine the world and the fleſh with words: that How wee ought to to ſpend our time. we employ ſo much time in leading a good life, that wee haue no time vacant to ſpeake an idle word.
                     I let thee know Fauſtine, that all that I haue tolde thee, I haue ſpoken it againſt my ſelfe: for alwayes from my youth I had a good mind, &amp; yet for all that I haue bin ouerthrown with vices
                     Oh how manie times in my youth I knew women, I accompanyed with women, I talked with women, and belieued women: the which in the ende haue deceyued mee, miſuſed me, and defamed me? At the laſt I withdrew my ſelfe and forſooke them: but I doe confeſſe, that if reaſon kept mee from their houſes x. dayes, ſenſualitie kept me with them x. weekes.
                     Oh cruell Gods, oh wicked worlde, oh fraile fleſh, tel me what it meaneth Reaſon leadeth to vertue, Senſualitie to vice. that reaſon leadeth me voluntarily to vertues, and that Senſualitie againſt my will, draweth mee to vices?
                     Doeſt thou not thinke Fauſtine, that I conſider what a great good it is for to bee good, and what an euill it is to be euill? But what ſhall I doe wofull man, ſince at this day there is not ſo cruell a ſcourge of my honour, nor ſo great an enemie of my renowme, as mine owne fleſh is, the which againſt me doth make ſuch cruel wars? wherfore I beſeech the immortall Gods, ſith my being here is againſt my will, that they do defend me in this ſo cruell war. The fraile fleſh is ſomwhat to blame, but much more is the fooliſh and light woman in faulte. For if men were certaine that women were chaſt, ſhamefaſt, &amp; ſolitary, they would not diſpoſe their hearts, their bodyes, nor bende theyr Bowes to ſhoote at their Buttes: they would not conſume their time to folow them, looſe their goods

to ſerue them, neither would they ſuffer ſo many ſhames to ſlaunder them. For where the heart hath no hope to obtaine, there hee will giue ouer his ſuite.
                     But what ſhall we do now Fauſtine (I pray thee tell me) ſince thou knoweſt better then I, that the ſhame of the Romaine women is now gone, and the women of Italie are ſo diſſolute, that though men do not regard them yet they do entice them: If men flie, they call them: if men go backe, they approach: if men are ſad, they make them merrie: if men are ſilent, they force them to ſpeake: and finally, men beginne their loue in ſporte, and they temper it in ſuch ſort, that they turne it all into earneſt.
                     I let thee know Fauſtine, that the meanes whereby Nature worketh in man is very ſtraunge: but the ſhame which the Gods put in Women, is more maruellous. And if it be true, (as it is true indeed) that the men doe loſe the ſting of the Fleſh, and that the Women doe not loſe the ſhame of the viſage: I thinke it is impoſſible that there ſhould bee a chaſte or vertuous woman in Rome. For there is no Common-wealth more vndone, then that where the women haue loſt their ſhame.
                     O women, what reaſon haue they which flie from you, which are weary of you, which forſake you, which forget you, which make thēſelues ſtraungers, and furthermore, which are dead and buryed.
                     For the hungrie wormes gnawe in in the graues onely, the fraile and ſlymie fleſh of the dead: but you women deſtroy the goods, honour, and life of the liuing.
                     Oh if the Noble heart knewe what euill doth follow them, for dallying with women, I ſweare vnto them, that they would not ſerue them continually as they doe ſerue them, but alſo they would haue no luſt, nor deſire to behold them.
                     What wilt thou (I ſay any more to thee Fauſtine) but that ſome ſcape out of your hands for effeminate &amp; ſlandered, others hurte by your tongues, others perſecuted with your works, others deceyued with your contenances, others deſpiſed through your hatred, others deſperate through your inconſtancie, others condemned by your light iudgements, others troubled throughly our vnkindeneſſe: Finally, thoſe that eſcape beſt, are of your hearts abhorred, and through your follies deſtoyed.
                     Then ſince the man knoweth that he muſt paſſe all theſe dangers, I can not tell what foole hee is, that will eyther loue or ſerue you? For the brute Beaſt that once hath felte the ſharpe teeth of the dogges, will vnwillingly euermore after come neare vnto the ſtake.
                     Oh vnto what perill doeth he offer himſelf, which continually doth haunt the company of women? For as much as if hee loue them not, they deſpiſe him, and take him for a Foole. If hee doth loue them, they account him for light.
                     If hee forſake them, they eſteeme him for no bodie. If he follow them, What dangers are incident to men by following women. he is acounted loſt. If he ſerue them, they doe not regarde him. If he doe not ſerue them, they deſpiſe him. If he will haue them, they wil not. If he will not, they perſecute him. If hee doe aduaunce himſelfe forth, they call him importunate. If he flie, they ſay he is a cowarde. If he ſpeake, they ſay he is a bragger. If he holde his peace, they ſay he is a diſſarde. If hee laugh, they ſay he is a foole. If he laugh not, they ſay he is ſolemne. If hee giueth them anie thing, they ſay it is little worth: and he that giueth them nothing, hee is a pinche-purſe. Finally, hee that haunteth them, is by them ſlandered:

and he that doeth not frequent them, is eſteemed leſſe then a man.
                     Theſe things ſo ſeene, heard, and ſo knowne, what ſhall the poore and miſerable men doe, in eſpecially, if he be a man of vnderſtanding? For though hee would abſent himſelfe from women, the fleſh doeth not giue him licence: and though hee would follow Women, wiſedome will not condeſcend.
                     Now ſome men ſuppoſe in all theyr thoughts, that by ſeruices and pleaſures they may content women. But I let them know (if they know it not) that the woman is neuer contented, Women neuer contented. though man doth what hee can, as a maid, and that he do all that he ought to do as a husband: though he taketh painesfor her ſake aboue his force, and though with the ſweat of his browes he relieueth her neede: though euery houre he putteth himſelfe in daunger, yet in the ende ſhee will giue him no thanks, but wil ſay that he loueth another, and how hee doeth that but to pleaſe and ſatisfie her. It is a long time ſince I deſired to tell thee this Fauſtine, but I haue deferred it vntill this preſent houre, hoping thou wouldeſt not giue occaſion to tell it thee: For amongſt wiſe men thoſe wordes ought chiefly to bee eſteemed, which fitly to the purpoſe are declared.
                     I remember that it is ſix yeares paſt ſince Antonius Pius (thy Father) choſe me to bee his Sonne in law, and that thou choſeſt mee for thy Husband, and I thee for my wife: all the which things were done, my wofull aduentures permitting it, and Adrian (my Lord) commaunding it.
                     The good Anthonius Pius gaue his onely daughter in marriage vnto me, and gaue mee likewiſe his Noble Empire with great treaſures: Hee gaue mee alſo the gardens of Vulcanali, to paſſe the time therein. But I thinke on both ſides we were deceiued: He in choſing mee for his Sonne in law, and I, in taking thee for my wife.
                     Oh Fanſtine, thy Father, and my Father in law, was called Anthontus Pius, becauſe to all hee was mercifull, ſaue only to mee, vnto whom he was moſt cruell: For with a little fleſh he gaue me many bones. And I confeſſe the truth vnto thee, that now I haue no more teeth to bite, nor heate in my ſtomacke to digeſt: and the worſt of all is, that many times I haue thought to rage on my ſelfe. I will tell thee one word, though it doeth diſpleaſe thee, (which is) that for thy beautie thou art deſired of manie, and for thy euill conditions, thou art deſpiſed of all. For the faire women are like vnto Women cō
                           pared to golden pilles. the golden pilles: the which in ſight are very pleaſant, and in eating very noyſome.
                     Thou knoweſt well Fauſtine, and I alſo, that wee ſaw on a day Druſio, and Braxille his Wife, which were our neighbours, and as they were brawling together, I ſpake vnto Druſio ſuch wordes;
                     What meaneth this, (my Lorde Druſio?) that being now the Feaſt of Berecinthia, and being as we are adioyuing to her houſe, and preſent before ſo honorable an aſſemblie, &amp; furthermore, thy wife being ſo faire as ſhe is, How is it poſſible there ſhould bee any ſtrife betweene you?
                     Men which are marryed to deformed perſons, to the ende that they might kil them quickly, ſhould always fall out with their Wiues: but thoſe that are married to faire women, they ought alwayes to liue together, in ioy and pleaſure, to the end they may liue long.
                     For when a faire woman dyeth, although ſhee haue liued an hundred yeares, yet ſhee dyeth too ſoone, and on the contrarie, though a deformed woman liueth but a ſmall time, yet notwithſtanding ſhee dyeth too late.
                     
                        
                        Druſio as a man being vexed, lifting vp his eyes vnto the heauens, fetching a grieuous ſigh from the bottome of his hart, ſaid theſe words as followeth
                     
                        The Mother Berecinthia pardon me, and her holy houſe alſo, and all the companie beſides, forgiue mee: for by the immortall 
                        The ſpeech of Druſio, 
                        gods I ſweare vnto thee, that I had rather haue beene Marryed with a Moore of Chalde that is ſo fowle, then being marryed as I am, with a Romaine beeing very faire: For ſhee is not ſo faire and white, as my life is wofull and blacke.
                     
                     Thou knoweſt well Fauſtine, that when Druſio ſpake theſe wordes, I did wipe the teares from his eyes, and I gaue him a word in his eare, that hee ſhould proceede no further in this matter: For ſuch women ought to be chaſtened in ſecret, and afterwards to be honoured openly.
                     Oh thou art moſt vnfortunate Fauſtine, and the Gods haue euill deuided with thee, giuing thee beautie and riches to vndoe thy ſelfe: and denying thee the beſt, which is wiſedome and good conditions to keepe thy honor. O what euil lucke cōmeth vnto a man, when God ſendeth him a faire daughter, vnleſſe furthermore the Gods doe permit that ſhee be ſage, and honeſt: for the womā which is yong, fooliſh, and faire, deſtroyeth the Commonwealth, &amp; defameth all her parentage.
                     I ſay vnto thee againe Fauſtine, that the gods were very cruel againſt thee ſince they ſwallowe thee vppe by the goulfes, where all the euill periſheth, and tooke from thee all the ſayles and What inconuenience follow thoſe that are diſcontented in marriage. owers, whereby the good doe eſcape. I remained xxxviij. yeares vnmarried, and theſe vj. yeares only which I haue bin married, mee thinketh I haue paſſed vj. hundreth yeares of my life: for nothing can bee called a torment, but the euil that man doth ſuffer, that is euill married. I will aſſure thee of one thing Fauſtine, that if I had knowne before, that which now I knowe, and that I had felt that which now I feele, though the Gods had cōmanded me, and the Emperour Adrian my Lorde deſired mee, I had not chaunged my pouerty for thy riches, neither my reſt for thy Empire: But ſince it is fallen to thine and mine euill fortunes, I am contented to ſpeake little, and to ſuffer much.
                     I haue ſo much diſſembled with thee Fauſtine, that I can no more: but I confeſſe vnto thee, that no Husband doth ſuffer his wife ſo much, but that hee is bound to ſuffer her more, conſidering that hee is a man, and that ſhe is a woman. For the man which willingly goeth into the bryers, he muſt thinke before to endure the prickes.
                     The Woman is too bolde that doeth contend with her Husband: but that Husband is more foole, which openly quarrelleth with his wife. For if ſhee be good, hee ought to fauour her, to the end that ſhe may be better: if ſhe be vnhappie, he ought to ſuffer her, to the end ſhe be not worſe. Truly when the woman thinketh that her husband taketh her for eulll, it is a great occaſion to make her to be worſe: For women are ſo ambitious, that thoſe who cōmonly are euil, wil make vs belieue that they are better then the others. How euery man &amp; woman ought to behaue themſelues.
                     
                     Belieue me Fauſtine, that if the feare of the gods, the infamy of the perſon, &amp; the ſpeech of men, do not reſtraine the woman, all the chaſtiſements of the worlde, will not make her refraine from vice: for all things ſuffereth chaſtiſement and correction, the woman only except, the which muſt be wonne by intreatie.
                     The heart of the man is very noble, and that of the woman very delicate, becauſe for a little good, hee will giue a great rewarde: and for a great offence hee will giue no puniſhment.
                     Before the wiſe man marieth, it behoueth him to beware what he doth, and

when hee ſhall determine to take the companie of a Woman, he ought to be like vnto him that entreth into the warre, that determineth with himſelfe to ſuffer all that may happen, bee it good or euill. I doe not call that life a warre without a cauſe, which the euill married man leadeth in his houſe: For women doe more hurt with their tongues, then the enemyes doe with theyr ſwords. It is a great ſimplicity for a wiſe man to make account, or eſteeme What hurte cometh by miſgouerning the tongue. the ſimplicitie of his wife at euery time: For if they would marke, and take heed to that which their wife doth, or ſaith. I let them know that they ſhall neuer haue an end.
                     O Fauſtine, if the Romaine women would alwayes one thing, that they would procure one thing, that they would bee reſolued in one thing, although it were to our great charges, wee ſhould haue pleaſure to condeſcend vnto their deſires: but what ſhall wee doe? ſince that which now pleaſeth you, a while after diſpleaſeth you? that which you aske in the morning, yee will not haue at noone: that which you enioy at noone dayes, doeth trouble you in the night: that which in the night you loue, yee care not for in the morning: that which yeſterday ye greatly eſteemed, to day aſmuch ye deſpiſe.
                     If yee deſired to ſee a thing the laſt yeare, this yeare ye wil not heare talke of it: that which before made you to reioice, doth now make you to be ſad: that which yee were wont and ought tolament, at the ſelfe ſame thing, a man ſeeth you laugh.
                     Finally, ye women are as children, which are appeaſed with an apple, and caſteth the golde to the earth, as not weyghing it. I haue diuers times thought with my ſelfe, if I could ſay, or write any good Rule, in keeping the which I might teache men to bee quiet in their houſes: And by my account I finde (hauing experimented it alſo with thee Fauſtine,) that it is vnpoſſible to giue a rule to Marryed men: and if a man could giue them, they ſhould ſcarcely profite therewith, ſince theyr Wiues liue without rule.
                     But yet notwithſtanding that, I wil declare ſome Rules, how the marryed folks ſhould keepe themſelues in their houſes: and how they ſhall, (if they liſt), auoyde ſtrifes and debates betweene them. For the Husbands and the Wiues hauing warres together, it is impoſſible there ſhould be peace in the Common-wealth. And though this preſent writing hath not profited me, vnluckie and vnfortunate man: yet it may profite others, which haue good wiues. For oft times the Medicin How marryed folkes ought to carry themſelues. which profiteth not for the tender Eyes, ſufficeth to heale the harde heeles.
                     I know well Fauſtine, that for that I haue ſaide, and for that I will ſay vnto thee, thou and others ſuch like, ſhall greatly enuie me. Yee will marke the words that I ſpeake, more then the intention that I meane: but I proteſt before the Gods, that in this caſe my ende is for no other intent, but to aduertiſe the good, whereof there are a great manie: and to puniſh the euill, which are many moe. And although perchaunce neyther the one nor the other wil belieue that my intention in ſpeaking theſe things was good: yet therefore I will not ceaſe to know the good from the euil, and to chooſe the euill from the good. For in my fantaſie the good-wife is as the Feaſaunt, whoſe feathers wee little eſteeme, and regard much the body: but the euill woman is as the Marterne, whoſe skin we greatly eſteem, and vtterly deſpiſe the Fleſh.
                     I will therefore declare the Rules, whereby the Husbandes may liue in peace with their owne proper wiues.
                     
                        
                        The Rules are theſe.
                        THe firſt, the husband muſt needs haue patience, and ſuffer his wife Rules for euery man to followe that meanes to liue in peace, when ſhee is diſpleaſed: for in Lybia there is no Serpent ſo ſpitefulll, as an euill woman when ſhee is vexed.
                        The ſecond, the Husband ought to prouide for his wife (according to his abilitie) all that is neceſſary for her, as well for her perſon, as for her houſe: for oft times it chaunceth, that women ſeeking things neceſſarie, finde things ſuperfluous, and not very honeſt.
                        The third, the Husband ought to prouide that his wife doe keepe good companie: for women oft times are more troubled, with the wordes that their euill Neighbours ſpeake againſt them, then for any occaſion that their Husbands giue them.
                        The fourth, that the husband ought to vſe a meane, that his Wife be not too much a ſubiect, nor that ſhe ſtray too much abroad: for the Woman that gaddeth much in the ſtreetes, both loſeth her good name, and ſpendeth his goods.
                        The fifth, the Husband ought to take heede, that hee ſtriueth not ſo with his wife that ſhe be brought paſt ſhame: for the woman that towards her Husband is ſhameleſſe, hath no reſpect what diſhoneſtie ſhee committeth.
                        The ſixt, the Husband ought to let his wife vnderſtand that he doth truſt her: for the woman is of ſuch condition, that that which a wiſe man wold not ſhee ſhould doe, ſhee will doe ſooneſt: and that wherein ſhe ſhould take paines, ſhe will doe nothing.
                        The ſeuenth, the Husband ought to bee circumſpect, that hee doe not wholly truſt his Wife with the goods and treaſours of the houſe, nor yet vtterly diſtruſt her: For if the wife haue the charge of the goods of the houſe, truely ſhee will augment little, and if the Husband doe ſuſpect her, ſhe will ſteale much.
                        The eight, the Husband ought to looke vpon his wife merrily, and at other times againe ſadly: For women are of ſuch condition, that when their Husbands ſhew them a merrie countenance they loue them: and when they ſhewe themſelues demure, they feare them.
                        The ninth, the husband ought (if he bee wiſe,) in this to take good aduiſement, that his wife quarrell not with his neighbors: For we haue ofttimes ſeene in Rome, that for the quarrell of his Wife againſt his neighbours, the Husband hath loſt his life, ſhee hath loſt her goods, and a ſlaunder hath riſen throughout the Commonwealth.
                        The tenth, the Husband ought to be ſo patient, that if he ſaw his wife commit any fault, that in no wiſe he ſhold correct her openly, but in ſecret: For the husband that correcteth his wife before witnes, doth as he which ſpitteth into the element, and the ſpittle falleth againe into his eyes.
                        The eleuenth, the Husband ought to haue much temperance, leſt he lay hands on his wife to puniſh her: For truly the wife that with ſharpe words doth not amend, with all the chaſtiſements of the worlde will neuer bee good.
                        The twelfth, if the Husband will be quiet with his wife, he ought to praiſe her before his neighbours and ſtraungers: For amongſt all other things, women haue this propertie, that of all they would be praiſed, and of none corrected.
                        The thirteenth, the Husband ought to beware to praiſe any other then his owne Wife, ſhee beeing preſent: For women are of this condition, that the ſame day that her Husband commendeth anie other Woman,

the ſame day his wife will caſt him out of her heart, thinking that he loueth another and deſpiſeth her.
                        The foureteenth: The husband ought to make his wife beleeue that ſhe is fayre, though indeede ſhee bee foule: for there is betweene them no greater ſtrife, then to thinke that her husband forſaketh her for being foule.
                        The fifteenth: The husband ought to put his wife in remembrance of the infamy that they ſpeake of them that bee euill in the Citie: for women are glorious; and becauſe they would be loth that men ſhould talke ſuch things by them as they talke of others, peraduenture they will refrayne from thoſe vices that others commit.
                        The ſixteenth: the husband ought to take heede that his wife accept no new friends: for through accepting of new friends, there grow commonly betweene them great diſcention.
                        The ſeuenteenth: The husband ought to take heede that his wife beleeue that he loueth not them whome ſhee hateth: for women are of ſuch a condition, that if the husbands loueth all them that they hate, immediately they will hate all thoſe which they loue.
                        The eighteenth: The husband ought ſometime in matters, which are not preiudiciall vnto him, confeſſe himſelfe to be ouercome: for women deſire rather to be counted the beſt in reaſoning, (though it be of no value) then to haue otherwiſe a greater Iewell giuen them.
                        In this ſort, Fauſtine, I will ſay no more to thee, but wiſh, that thou ſhouldeſt ſee what I ſee, and feele what I feele: and aboue all, that my diſſimulation ſhould ſuffice to amend thy life.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XVII. The Emperour anſwereth more particularly concerning the Key of his Studie.
                     
                     
                        NOw Fauſtine, ſince I haue the olde venome from my heart expelled, I will anſwere to thy preſent demand: for vnto demaunds and anſweres that paſſeth betweene the Sages, the tong ought neuer to ſpeake word, but that firſt he aske the heart licence. And it is a generall rule amongſt the Phiſitians, that the medicines doe not profite the ſicke, vnleſſe they firſt take away the opilations of the ſtomacke, I meane by this, that no man can ſpeake to his friend (as he ought) vnleſſe before hee ſheweth what thing grieueth him: for it is better to repayre the roufes of the houſes that be old, then to goe about to build them new.
                     Thou requireſt, Fauſtine, that I giue thee the key of my Studie, and thou doſt threaten mee, that if I giue it not vnto thee, that thou ſhalt forthwith bee deliuered. I maruell not at that thou ſayeſt, neyther am I abaſht of that thou demaundeſt, nor yet of that that thou wouldeſt doe: for you women are very extreame in your deſires, Women extreame in their demands. very ſuſpicious in your demands, very obſtinate in your willes, and as vnpatient in your ſufferings. I ſay not without a cauſe that women are extreame in their deſires: for there are thinges whereof women are ſo deſirous, that it is wonder though neuer liuing creature ſaw them, nor heard ſpeake of them. I haue not ſayd without a cauſe that women are ſuſpicious in their demands: for the Romane women are of ſuch a condition, that as ſoone as a woman deſireth any thing, ſhe forthwith commandeth the tong

to aske it, the feete to ſeeke it, the eies to ſee it, the hands to feele it, and likewiſe the heart to loue it. I ſay not without a cauſe that women are obſtinate in their willes: for if a Romane woman beareth any malice to any man, ſhee will not forbeare to accuſe him for any ſlaunder, nor faile to purſue him for any pouertie, nor feare to kill him for any Iuſtice. I ſay not without a cauſe that women are vnpatient to ſuffer: for many are of ſuch condition (I ſay not all) that if a man giue not ſpeedily that which they deſire, they change their colour, their eyes looke redde, their tongues runne A froward Woman deſcribed. quicke, their voyces are ſharpe, they frette with themſelues, they trouble their neighbours abroad, and are ſo out of order, that no man dare ſpeake vnto them within. You haue this good trade among yee women, that vnder colour of being with childe, you will that your husbands grant yee all your deſires. When the ſacred Senate, in the time of the valliant Camillus, made a law in the fauour of the Romane Matrons with childe, the women at that time longed not ſo much as they doe at this preſent: but I cannot tell what this preſently meaneth, that all ye are anoynted with that that is good, and that yee are all deſirous of that that is euill.
                     I will tell thee, Fauſtine, the occaſion why this lawe was made in Rome, and thereby thou ſhalt ſee if thou deſerueſt to enioy the priuiledge thereof or no: for the lawes are but as yokes vnder the which the euill doth labour, and the wings wherewith the good doe flye. The caſe thereof was ſuch, that Camillus, the valiant Captaine, went forth to the warres, hee made a ſolemne vow to the mother Berecinthia, that if the Gods gaue him the victory, hee would offer vnto her an Image of ſiluer: and after Camillus wanne the victory, and that he would haue accompliſhed his vow to the mother Berecinthia, neyther had he any riches, nor Rome had any ſiluer: for at that time Rome was rich of vertues, and poore of money. Rome in ancient times rich in vertues.
                     
                     And know thou, Fauſtine, that our ancient Fathers were deuout towards the Gods, and curious in repayring the Temples, the which they eſteemed to be great deuotions: and they were in ſuch ſort obſerued of their vowes, that neither for ſloth nor pouertie they would omit their promiſes towards their Gods. And in theſe things they were ſo preciſe, that they graunted to no man any triumph, vnleſſe he did ſweare that he had vnto the Gods made a vow, and afterwards alſo proued how he performed it.
                     At that time flouriſhed in Rome many vertuous Romanes, and many Greeke Philoſophers, many hardie Captaines, and many ſumptuous Buildings: and aboue all things, Rome was vnpeopled of malicies, and adorned with vertuous Ladies.
                     The Hiſtoriographers made (and not without a cauſe) great account of theſe vertuous Matrons: for the Common-wealth hath as much need of vertuous Women, as the Warres haue of valiant Captaines. They being therefore (as they were) ſo vertuous and ſo Noble Matrons, (without the motion of any woman) determined all to goe into the high Capitoll, and there to offer all their Iewels and Treaſures that they had, their Chains, their Rings, their Garments, their Bracelets, their Girdles, their Buttons, and Hangers of Gold, Siluer, and precious Stones of all ſorts, with all their Tablets.
                     The Annales of this time ſay, that after the Romane women had layd ſo great a multitude of riches at the feet of the ſacred Senate, in the name of of them all, one of them ſpake, whoſe name was called Lucina, and ſayd in

this ſort: Fathers conſcript, eſteeme not much theſe our Iewels, which we giue you to make the Image of the mother Berecinthia: but eſteeme much this, that wee willingly put in ieopardie our huſbands and children, to winne you the victorie. And in this caſe you accept our poore ſeruice, haue no reſpect to the little which wee doe offer: but to the great which (if we were able) we would giue.
                     
                     Truely, the Romanes, though the treaſure which their wiues offered was great: yet notwithſtanding, they did more eſteeme the good will wherewith they gaue it, then they did the gifts themſelues: for there was ſo much, indeed, that ſufficed both to make the Image of the Goddeſſe Berecinthia, and alſo for a long time to maintaine the Warres. Therefore from that day that thoſe Matrons preſented their Iewels in the high Capitoll, the Senate forthwith in remembrance of the gentleneſſe, graunted them theſe fiue things as a priuiledge: for at that time Rome neuer receiued ſeruice or benefite of any perſon, but Shee rewarded it with double payment.
                     The firſt thing that the Senate granted the Romane Women was; That in the day of their buriall, the Oraters 
                        Fiue things granted to the Matrones of Rome. 
                        might openly make Orations in the prayſe of their liues: for, in olde time men vſed neyther to exalt them when they were dead, nor yet to accompany them to their graues.
                     
                     The ſecond thing that was graunted vnto them was; That they might ſit in the Temples: for, in the olde time, when the Romanes did offer Sacrifices to their Gods, the aged did alwayes ſit, the Prieſts kneele, the marryed men did leane; but the women, though they were of Noble and high linage, could neyther be ſuffered to talke, ſit, nor leane.
                     
                     The third thing that the Senate granted the women of Rome was; That euery one of them might haue two rich Gownes, and that they ſhould not aske the Senate leaue to weare them: for, in the old time, if any woman were apparelled, or did buy any new Gowne without asking licence of the Senate, ſhe ſhould immediately loſe her Gowne; and becauſe her husband did condiſcend vnto the ſame, he was baniſhed the Common-wealth.
                     
                     The fourth thing which they granted them was; That they ſhould drinke Wine when they were ſicke: for there was in Rome a cuſtome inuiolable, that though their life was in hazard, they durſt not drinke wine, but water: for, when Rome was well corrected, a woman that drunke wine was as much ſlandered among the people, as if ſhe had committed Adultery towards her husband.
                     
                     The fith thing granted by the Senate vnto the women was; That a man might not deny a Romane, being with childe, any honeſt and lawfull thing that ſhe demanded. I cannot tell why the Ancients of Rome eſteemed more of women with childe, then others that had no children.
                     
                     All theſe fiue thinges were iuſtly granted to the Matrons and Noble Romane Ladyes. And I can tell thee, Fauſtine, that they were of the Senate moſt willingly granted: for it is reaſon that women, which in vertues doe excell, ſhould with all meanes be honoured.
                     I will tell thee, Fauſtine, the eſpeciall cauſe that mooued the Romanes to grant vnto you Matrones this laſt priuiledge: that is to ſay, That a man cannot deny them any thing being with child.
                     
                     Thou oughteſt to know, that the others (as well Greekes as Latines) did neuer giue Lawes nor Inſtitutions vnto their people without great occaſions: for the great multitude of lawes are commonly euill kept; and on the other part, are cauſe of ſundry troubles. We cannot deny, but that the Ancients did well auoyde the great number of Inſtitutions: for it is better

for a man to liue as reaſon commandeth him, then as the lawe conſtraineth him.
                     The caſe therefore was, that in the yeere of the foundation of Rome, 364. Fuluius Torquatus then being Conſull, in the warre againſt the Volces, the Knights of Mauritania brought to Rome an huge Monſter with one eye, called Monoculus, which he had found in the Deſarts of Aegipt, at the time the wife of Torquatus, called Macrina, ſhould haue beene deliuered of child; for the Conſull did leaue her great.
                     This Macrina amongſt all was ſo honeſt, that they ſpent as much time in Rome to praiſe her for her vertues, as they did ſet foorth her husband for his Victories.
                     They read in the Annalles of that time, That the firſt time that this Conſull Torquatus went into Aſia, he was eleuen yeeres out of his Country; and his found for a truth, that in all The commendation of a vertuous woman. the time that Torquatus was abſent, his wife was neuer ſeene to looke out at the window, which was not a thing ſmally eſteemed: for though it was a cuſtome in Rome to keepe the doore ſhut: it was lawfull notwiſtanding to ſpeake to women at the windowes. Though men at that time were not ſo bold, and the women were ſo honeſt, yet Macrina, wife to Torquatus, liued ſo cloſe &amp; ſolitary to her ſelfe, that in all theſe eleuen yeeres there was neuer man that ſaw her goe through Rome, or that euer ſaw her doore open, neither that ſhee conſented at any time (from the time that ſhee was eight yeeres of age) that any man ſhould enter into her houſe: and moreouer, there was neuer man ſaw her face wholly vncouered. This Romane Ladie did this, to leaue of her a memorie, and to giue example of her vertue.
                     She had alſo three children, whereof the eldeſt was but fiue yeeres olde: and ſo when they were eight yeeres of age, immediately ſhee ſent them out of her houſe towards their Parents, leſt, vnder the colour to viſite the children, others ſhould come to viſite her.
                     O Fauſtine, how many haue I heard that haue lamented this excellent Romane! and what will they thinke that ſhall follow her life? Who could preſently reſtrain a Romane woman from going to the window eleuen yeeres, ſince things now adayes are ſo diſſolute, that they doe not onely deſire to ſee them, but alſo run in the Streetes, to babble of them?
                     Who ſhould cauſe now adayes a Romane woman, that in the eleuen yeeres ſhe ſhould not open her dores, ſince it is ſo, that when the husband commaunded her to ſhut one doore, ſhe will make the whole houſe to ring of her voyce? Hee that now would commaund his wife to tarry at home, and let her of her vagaries into the Towne, ſhall perceiue that there is no Baſiliske nor Viper that carryeth ſuch poiſon in her taile, as ſhe will ſpit with her tongue.
                     Who could make a Romane woman to bee eleuen yeeres continually without ſhewing her face to any man, ſince it is ſo, that they ſpend the moſt part of their time in looking in a Glaſſe, ſetting their Ruffes, bruſhing their Cloathes, and painting their faces?
                     Who would cauſe a Romane woman to keepe her ſelfe eleuen yeeres from being viſited of her Neighbors and Friends, ſince it is true, that now women thinke them greateſt enemies which viſite them moſt ſeldome?
                     Returning therefore to the Monſter. As they led this Monſter before the doore of Torquatus his houſe, ſhe being great with childe, and her huſband in the warre, by chance a Mayde of his told her how that this Monſter paſſed by, wherefore ſo great a deſire

tooke her to ſee the Monſter, that for to keepe that ſhe had begun, ſuddenly for this deſire ſhe dyed.
                     Truely, I tell thee, Fauſtine, that this Monſter had paſſed many times by the Streete where ſhe dwelt, and ſhe would neuer notwithſtanding go to the window, and much leſſe out of her doore to ſee it.
                     The death of this Romane of many was lamented: for it was a long time that Rome had neuer heard of ſo honeſt and vertuous a Romane; wherefore at the petition of all the Romane people, and by the commaundement of all the ſacred Senate, they ſet on her Tombe theſe verſes.
                     The worthy Macrine reſteth here in graue,
                     Whom wiſe Torquatus lodg'd in Iunos bed,The Epitaph of Macrine.
                     
                     Who reckoned not a happy life to haue:
                     So that for aye her honeſt name was ſpred.
                     BEhold therefore, Fauſtine, In my opinion, the law was not made to remedie the death of this Noble Romane, ſince ſhe was already dead; but to the end, that you Princeſſes ſhould take example of her life, and that through all Rome there ſhould bee a memory of her death. It is reaſon, ſince the law was ordayned for thoſe women which are honeſt, that it ſhould be obſerued in none, but vpon thoſe that are vertuous: let the women with childe marke the words of the lawe, which commaund them to aske things honeſt. Wherefore I let thee know, Fauſtine, that in the ſeuenth Table of our lawes are written theſe words: We will, that where there is corruption of manners, the man ſhall not be bound to obſerue their liberties.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XVIII. That Princeſſes and Noble Women ought not to bee aſhamed to giue their children ſucke with their owne breſts.
                     
                     
                        ALl Noble men that are of hauty courage watch continually to bring that to effect which they couet, and to keepe that which they haue: for, by ſlrength one commeth to honour: and by wiſedome, Honour and life are both preſerued.
                     By theſe words I meane, That ſhe that hath born nine months (through trauaile) the creature in her wombe, with ſo much paine, and that afterwards is deliuered with ſo great peril, and by the grace of God, from ſo many dangers eſcaped, me thinks it is not well, that in this point (which for the nouriſhment of the babe is moſt expedient) the Mothers ſhould ſhew them ſo negligent: for that wanteth no folly, that by extreame labour is procured, and with much lightneſſe afterwards deſpiſed. The things that women naturally deſire are infinite, among the which, theſe are foure chiefely.
                     
                        The firſt thing that women deſire, is 
                        Foure things which women naturally deſire. 
                        to be very fayre: for they had rather bee poore and fayre, then to be rich and foule.
                     
                     
                        The ſecond thing which they deſire, 
                              •
                            is to ſee themſelues marryed: for vntil ſuch time as the woman doe ſee her ſelfe marryed, from the bottome of her heart ſhe alwayes ſigheth.
                     
                     
                        The third thing that women deſire, is to ſee themſelues great with childe, and herein they haue reaſon: for vntill ſuch time as the woman hath had a childe, it ſeemeth that ſhee taketh him more for a Louer then for a Husband.
                     
                     
                        The fourth thing that they deſire, is to
                        
                        ſee themſelues deliuered; and in this caſe, more then all the reſt, they haue reaſon: for it is great pittie to ſee in the prime time a young tree loaden with bloſſomes, and afterward the fruit to bee deſtroyed through the abundance of Caterpillers.
                     
                     Then ſince God ſuſſereth that they are borne fayre, that they ſee themſelues marryed, that they bee with childe, and that they are deliuered; why be they ſo vnkinde, as to ſend them out of their houſes, to bee nouriſhed in other rude Cottages?
                     In my opinion, the woman that is vertuous, ought as ſoone as ſhe is deliuered, to lift vp her eyes, and with her heart to giue God thankes for her fruit: for the woman, that from her deliuery is eſcaped, ought to acount her ſelfe as one newly borne. The woman likewiſe, ſeeing her ſelfe deliuered of her creature, ought to giue it ſucke with her owne breſts: for it is a monſtrous thing, that ſhe that hath brought forth the creature out of her owne proper wombe, ſhould giue it to bee nouriſhed of a ſtrange dugge. In ſpeaking more plainely, (it is all one to mee whether ſhe be a Noble woman, or a woman of meane condition) I ſay and affirme, that GOD Women bound by Gods Law to giue her children ſucke. hath deliuered her of all her trauaile, ſhee her ſelfe ought with her owne pappes to nouriſh and giue ſucke to their babes: for nature did not onely make women able to beare men, but alſo beſides that, prouided milke in their breſts, to nouriſh their children. We haue neither read vntill this preſent, nor ſeene, that any beaſts (wilde or tame) after they had young, would commit them to any other to be nouriſhed.
                     This which I haue ſpoken is not ſo worthy of noting, as that which I will ſpeake; and it is, That many beaſts new borne, before they open their eyes to know their fathers, haue now already taken nouriſhment in the teates of their mothers: and more then that, to ſee ſome of thoſe little beaſts haue tenne little whelpes, the which, without the ayde of any others, nouriſhed them all with the ſubſtance of their owne teates: and the woman that hath but one childe diſdayneth to giue it ſucke. The example of dumb creatures may teach women to bring vp their owne children.
                     
                     All that ſhall reade this writing ſhall find it true, and if they will, they may ſee as I haue ſeene it by experience, that after the ſhe Ape hath had her yonglings, ſhe alwaies hath them in her armes ſo long as they ſucke, ſo that ofentimes there is ſuch ſtrife betweene the male &amp; the female, which of them ſhall haue the younglings in their armes, that the beholders are enforced to part them with bats.
                     Let vs leaue the Beaſts that are in the Fields, and talke of the Birds that are in the neſts, the which doe lay egges to haue young, yet haue they no milke to bring them vp. What thing is ſo ſtrange to ſee, as a ſmall Bird that hath vnder her wings fiue or ſixe little naked Birds, the which when he hath hatched, ſhe hath neither milk to nouriſh thē, nor corne to giue them; they haue neyther wings to flye, fethers to couer them, nor any other thing to defend them: yet in all this weakeneſſe and pouertie, their mother forſaketh them not, nor committeth them to any other, but bringeth them vp all her ſelfe.
                     That which nature prouided for the Swannes is no leſſe maruellous, in eſpecially when they nouriſh their young Signets in the water: for as much as during the time that they cannot ſwimme, the mothers alwaies in the day are with their yong Signets in theis neſts, and in the night the fathers carry them vnder their proper wings (to refreſh them) vnto the water. It is therefore to be thought, ſince theſe Swannes ſo louingly beare their younglings vnder their wings, that

they would carry them in their armes if they were men, and alſo giue them ſucke with their owne breſts if they were women. Ariſtotle ſayeth, in his fift booke De animalibus, that the Lyons, Ariſt. de Animal. the Beares, the Wolues, the Eagles, and Griffins, and generally all Beaſts, neuer are, were, nor ſhall be ſeene ſo fierce nor ſo cruell, as when they haue younglings: and this thing ſeemeth to bee true: for at that time, we ſee that many beaſts might eſcape the hunters, yet to ſaue their younglings they turne backe and put their proper liues in danger. Plato ſaith in his booke of Lawes, that the children are neuer ſo wel beloued of their mothers, as when they are nouriſhed with their proper breſts, &amp; that their fathers danceth them on their knees. The which thing is true: for the firſt loue in all things is the trueſt loue.
                     I was willing to ſhew the bringing vp of bruit beaſts, to ſhew the women with childe how pittifull parents they are in nouriſhing their younglings with their owne breſts: and how cruell Mothers Women are, in committing their children to ſtrangers. It is a maruellous thing to heare the mothers ſay, that they loue their children; and on the contrary ſide to ſee how they hate them. In this caſe I cannot tell whether they loue more, eyther the childe or the money: for I ſee that they couet greatly to hourd vp riches into their Cheſts; and likewiſe, they deſire as much to caſt out their children out of their houſes. There are diuers reaſons whereby the mothers ought to bee moued to nouriſh their children (which they bare in ther wombs) with their owne proper breſts.
                     The firſt reaſon is, that the mother ought to haue reſpect how the yong babe was borne alone, how little hee was, how poore, delicate, naked, tender, and without vnderſtanding: and ſince that the mother brought it forth ſo weake and feeble, it is neither meet nor conuenient, that in time of ſuch neceſſitie ſhee ſhould forſake it, and commit it into the hands of a ſtrange Nurſe. Let women pardon me, whether they bee Ladyes, brought vp in pleaſures, or other of meaner eſtate, accuſtomed with trauels, I force not: but I ſay, that thoſe which forſake their children in ſuch extremities are not pittifull mothers, but cruell enemies. The deſcription of children in their infancie. If it bee crueltie, not to cloath him that is naked, who is more naked then the childe new borne? if it bee crueltie not to comfort the ſad; who is more ſad, deſolate and ſorrowfull, then the childe which is borne weeping? If it be vngentlenes not to ſuccour the poore needy; who is more needy, or more poore then the innocent childe newly borne, that knoweth not as yet neyther to goe, nor to ſpeake? If it bee crueltie to doe euill to the innocent that cannot ſpeake; who is more innocent then the infant that cannot complaine of that which is done vnto him? The mother that caſteth out of her houſe the children borne of her owne body, how can we beleeue that ſhe will receiue in any other of ſtrangers? when the infant is now great, when hee is ſtrong, when he can ſpeake, when he can goe, when hee can profite himſelfe, and get his meate, the mother maketh much of him, and leadeth him about with her: but is little thanke vnto her: for then the mother hath more neede of the childe to bee ſerued, then the childe hath of the mother to be cheriſhed. If the children were born of the nailes of the fingers of the feete, or of the hands, it were a ſmall matter though their mothers ſent them forth to nouriſh: but I cannot tell what heart can endure to ſuffer this, ſince the child is borne of their proper intrailes, that they do cōmit it (to be broght vp) into

the hands of a ſtranger. Is there (peraduenture) at this day in the world any Lady, that hath ſo great cōfidence in any of her friends, parents, or neighbours, that ſhe durſt truſt any of them with the key of her coffer, wherin her lewels, money, and riches lyeth? truely, I thinke none. O vnkind mothers! my pen had almoſt called you cruell ſtepmothers, ſince you lay vp in your heart the curſed mucke of the ground, and ſend out of your houſes that which ſprang of your bloud. And if women ſhould ſay vnto mee that they are weake, feeble, and tender, and that now they haue found a good Nurſe: to this I anſwere, that the Nurſe hath ſmal loue to the child which ſhe nouriſheth, when ſhe ſeeth the vngentleneſſe of the mother that bare it: for truly, ſhe alone doth nouriſh the childe with loue, that heeretofore hath borne it with paine.
                     The ſecond reaſon is, that it is a What loue women ought to beare their children. thing very iuſt, that women ſhould nouriſh their children, to the ende they may bee like vnto their conditions: for otherwiſe they are no children, but are enemies: for the childe that doeth not reuerence his mother that bare him, cannot enioy a proſperous life. Since the intention of the parents, in bringing vp their children, is for none other purpoſe, but to bee ſerued of them when they are olde: they ſhall vnderſtand, that for this purpoſe there is nothing more neceſſary then the milke of the proper mother: for where the childe ſucketh the milke of a ſtranger, it is vnlikely that it ſhould haue the conditions of the mother. If a Kid ſucke a Sheepe, they ſhall perceiue, it ſhall haue the wooll more faire, &amp; the nature more gentle, then if he had ſucked the Goat, which hath the wooll more hard, and of nature is more wilde; wherein the Prouerbe is verified, Not from whence thou commeſt, but whereof thou feedeſt.
                     
                     It auayleth a man much to haue a good inclination: but it helpeth him much more, from his infancy to bee well taught: for in the end we profite more with the cuſtomes wherewith we liue, then we doe by nature from whence we came.
                     The third reaſon is, that women ought to nouriſh their owne children, becauſe they ſhould bee whole mothers, and not vnperfect: for the woman is counted but halfe a mother that beareth it, and likewiſe, halfe a mother that nouriſheth it: but ſhe is the whole mother, that both beareth it, and nouriſheth it. After the duetie conſidered vnto the Father, that hath created vs, and vnto the Sonne, that hath redeemed vs, mee thinketh next we owe the greateſt dutie vnto the Mother, that hath borne vs in her bodie: and much more it is that wee ſhould beare vnto her, if ſhe had nouriſhed vs with her owne breſts: for when the good child ſhall behold his mother, hee ought more to loue her becauſe ſhee nouriſhed him with her milke: then becauſe ſhee hath borne him in her body.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XIX. The Authour ſtill perſwadeth women to giue their owne children ſucke.
                     
                     
                        IN the yeere of the foundation of Rome, fiue hundred &amp; two, after the obſtinate and cruell warre betweene Rome and Carthage, where the renowmed Captaines were, Hanibal for the Carthaginians, and Scipio for the Romanes: Soone after that warre followed the warre of Macedonia, againſt King Philip. The which, when it was ended, that of Syria began; againſt Antiochus, King of Syria:
                        
for in ſixe hundred and thirty yeeres the Romanes had alwaies continuall warres in Aſia, in Affrick, or in Europe. The noble Romanes ſent the Conſull Cornelius Scipio (brother to the great Scipio the Affrican) for Captaine of that warre. And after many battailes, Fortune ſhewed her force in a Citie called Sepila, the which is in Aſia the great, where King Antiochus was ouercome, and all his Realme diſcomfited: for trees that haue their roots plucked vp, muſt needes within ſhort time loſe their fruites.
                     After that King Antiochus was ouercome, and his Land ſpoyled, Cornelius 
                        The reward of the Roman Captain. 
                        Scipio came into Rome triumphing, for the victory that hee had of Aſia: ſo that his brother (for the victory that hee had of Affrica) was called Affricane: ſo hee was called Scipio the Aſian, becauſe he vanquiſhed Aſia. The Captaines of Rome loued honor ſo much, that they would no other reward nor recompence of their trauel, but that they ſhould giue them the renowme of the Realme which they had ouercome. Truely they had reaſon, for the noble hearts ought little to eſteem the encreaſe of their riches, and ought greatly to eſteeme the perpetuity of their good name. As Sextus Cheronenſis ſaith, in his third booke De ambigua iuſtitia, that Cornelius Scipio had a long time the gouernment of the people, for as much as hee was Conſul, Cenſor, &amp; Dictator of Rome: for he was not onely hardy and couragious, but alſo he was ſage and wiſe, which thing ought greatly to bee eſteemed in a man: for Ariſtotle doeth not determine it, which of theſe two is moſt excellent; either ſtoutnes, to fight in the warres; or pollicy, to rule in peace. Scipio therfore being Dictator (which was an office then as the Emperour is now) it chanced, that the ten Captaines which had beene with him in the warres, violently fought to haue entred into the Monaſtery of the Virgins Veſtals: wherfore the Dictator commanded their heads to be cut off: for the Romanes puniſhed more cruelly thoſe, that onely required the Virgins veſtalls, then thoſe that forced the marryed Matrons.
                     
                        Cornelius Scipio was beſought of many in Rome, that hee would moderate and change his ſo cruell ſentence. And hee which moſt in this caſe did importune him, was his brother Scipio, the Affrican, whoſe prayer was not accepted. Howbeit, in the end the ſayd Captaines were pardoned, by the requeſt of a Siſter of the ſayde Dictator Scipio the Affrican. And becauſe The ſpeech of Scipio the Affricā. hee blamed his brother Scipio, that he had done more for the daughter of his Nurſe, then for the ſonne of his proper mother, he anſwered: I let thee know, brother, that I take her more for my Mother that brought me vp, and did not beare me: then ſhee which hath borne me, and in my infancy hath forſaken me: And ſince I haue had her for my true mother, it is but reaſon that I haue this for my deare and well beloued ſiſter.
                     
                     Theſe were the words which paſſed betweene theſe two brethren.
                     I haue diligently read in holy and prophane Writings, that many Tyrants haue cauſed their owne mothers to bee killed which bare them: but I could neuer find that they haue done any diſcourteſie or diſobedience to the Nurſes which gaue them milke. For the cruell Tyrants doe thirſt after the bloud of others; but they feare them whoſe milke they ſucke.
                     The fourth reaſon that bindeth Women to nouriſh their children is, to keepe them in more obedience: for, if the Fathers liue a long time, they muſt of force come into the hands of their children. And let not old Fathers make their accounts, ſaying, that during

the time that they ſhall haue the gouernment of the houſe, their children ſhall be kept in obedience: for in ſo doing they might abuſe themſelues: for young men in their youth, feele not the trauailes of this life, not know not as yet, what it meaneth to make prouiſion for houſehold: for to the ſtomacke that is full, and cloyed with eating, all meates ſeeme both vnſauory and noyſome.
                     It may well bee, that ſince the children are not nouriſhed in the houſe, that they know not their ſeruants, that they loue not their Parents, that they come not neere their brethren nor talke with their ſiſters, that they are ignorant of their fathers, and doe diſobey their mothers: wherefore, ſince little feare doth abound, and good will fayle, one day they commit ſome miſchieuous offence, wherby they doe loſe their life worthily, and the fathers loſe the riches, and likewiſe their honour deſeruedly, to the intent that the fathers alwaies What dutie is required betweene the Parents and the childe. keepe their proper children vnder obedience, there is no better meane then to bring them vp in their owne houſes, the mother to giue them ſucke, and the father to teach them: for when the mother deſireth any thing of her childe, ſhee ſhould not ſhew him the belly from whence hee came, but the dugges which hee did ſucke: for all that which is asked vs, by the milke which we did ſucke, truely there is no heart ſo hard that can deny her.
                     The Hiſtoriographers ſay, that Antipater among all the Grecians was the moſt renowmed tyrant: &amp; among the Romanes, Nero. And theſe two wicked Princes were not great tirants becauſe they had committed many tyrannies; but becauſe they did commit one which was moſt grieuous of al others: for they do not call a man a Glutton or Cormorant, becauſe hee eateth euery houre, but becauſe hee deuoureth more at one paſte, then others doe in one day. The caſe was, that Antipater in Greece, and Nero in Rome, determined to kill their owne Mothers: And the Hiſtoriographers ſay, that when Nero commanded his mother to be killed, ſhe ſent to aske of him why he would put her to death? whereunto he anſwered, That hee was cloyed to behold the armes wherein hee was nouriſhed, and therefore he cauſed 
                        The eruelty of Nero towards his Mother. 
                        her to be killed, to ſee the intrailes out of the which he came.
                     
                     This caſe was ſo horrible, that it ſeemed to many not to ſpeake it: but cōcluding, I ſay, as vniuſtly as the mothers loſt the mortall life, ſo iuſtly did the children get for them immortall infamy. Nothing can be more wieked and deteſtable to the children, then to kill their mothers which did beare them with paine, and did nouriſh them with loue: but notwithſtanding all this, we doe not read that euer they did kill, diſhonour, or yet diſobey their nurſes which gaue them milke. Iunius Ruſticus, in the fift booke of the bringing vp of children, ſayth, that the two Gracchi (renowmed &amp; famous Romanes) had a third brother, being a Baſtard, who ſhewed himſelfe as valiant and hardy in the warres of Aſia, as the other two did in the wars of Affrica. The which, as he came one day to Rome to viſite his houſe, hee found therein his Mother which bare him, and the Nurſe which gaue him ſucke; to the which Nurſe hee gaue a Girdle of gold, and to his owne Mother he gaue a Iewell of ſiluer. Of the which things the mother being aſhamed, conſidering what her ſon had done, ſhe asked him, why hee had giuen the nurſe the gold, which did but only giue him ſuck, &amp; that he had not giuen the girdle of gold to her as well as the Iewell of ſiluer, ſince ſhee had born, &amp; brought him into the world.

Whereunto he anſwered in this manner: Maruell not thereat, mother, why I doe this thing, for thou didſt beare me but nine moneths in thy wombe, and ſhee hath giuen mee ſucke, and nouriſhed mee theſe three yeeres with her owne proper pappes: and when thou diddeſt caſt mee from thee out of thy ſight, ſhee receiued mee and nouriſhed mee in her proper armes.
                     
                     Fifthly, Women ought to enforce themſelues to nouriſh their children, The reaſon that may moue women to giue their children ſucke. to the end they may keepe them the better, and that in their cradles they be not changed for others.
                     
                        Ariſtotle ſayth, that the Cuckow commêth to the neſt of another bird when ſhe hath laid her eggs, and ſucketh them, and layeth in the ſame place her owne egges: ſo that the other birde, thinking that they are her owne, hatcheth and nouriſheth them vp as her owne, vntill ſuch time as they are able to flye: then the Cuckow killeth and eateth the ſilly bird that hath nouriſhed her; through the which occaſiō the males of thoſe birds are at ſo great contention (that they haue beene ſo deceiued) that the one of them killeth the other, the which they might let if euery bird did nouriſh her owne.
                     In the ſame time that Philip raigned in Macedonia, (which was the father of Alexander the great) Arthebanus was King of the Epirotes, who in his age had a child borne, the which was ſtolne out of the Cradle, and another put in his ſtead. The Nurſe which did nouriſh it, through couetouſnes of mony, conſented to that treaſon: for the heart that is with couerouſnes ouercome, will not feare to commit any treaſon. It chanced not long after that King Arthebanus dyed, and left (as hee thought) his owne ſonne for his heire: but within few dayes after, the Nurſe her ſelfe, which had conſented vnto the robberie, diſcouered the theft, and ſayd, that ſhee could tell where the lawfull childe of the good King Arthebanus was, and that that child which now was Heire, was but the ſonne of a meane Knight: but indeed, it had beene better for thoſe of the miſerable Realme, that the woman had neuer diſcouered the ſecret: for it chanceth oft times, that a man maketh ſuch haſte off his horſe, that he hurteth his leg, and through that occaſion afterwards falleth and breaketh his necke. But what ſhall we ſay to the Plebeicall women, of baſe and meane eſtate, (I doe not meane the Noble, Gentle, and vertuous Ladies) whereof they are many, that though in great ſecret their chiefeſt friend telleth them any thing, yet before they drinke they will vtter it to another.
                     Thus when the treaſon was diſcouered, cruell warres betweene theſe two Princes beganne: ſo that in the end, in a great battaile they were both ſlayne, the one in defending, and the other in aſſaulting.
                     At that time Olimpias raigned, who was the fayre and worthy wife of Philip, and mother of Alexander. Shee had a Brother, named Alexander, who was both pollitike &amp; hardy, and hearing the Epirotes were in conrouerſie, and that two Kings were ſlaine in the field, he placed himſelf in the Realme, more of wil, then of right. And let no man maruell, that this King occupyed the Realme; for in the old time all the tyrrannous Princes thought, that all that which they could obtaine without reſiſtance, did vnto them belong by Iuſtice. This King Alexander was he which came into Italy in the fauour of the Tarentines, when they rebelled againſt the Romanes: who afterward was ſlaine in battel at Capua, where his body was vnburied. And truly it was a iuſt ſentence, that the tirant which beteaueth many of their liues, ſhould

himſelfe taſte ſome ſhamefull death.
                     I haue declared this Hiſtorie to this end, that Princeſſes and great Ladies ſhould ſee, that if the wife of King Arthehanus had nouriſhed his ſonne, they could not haue robbed it in the Cradle, nor theſe two Princes had not beene ſlayne in battaile, nor the Common-wealth had not beene deſtroyed, nor Alexander had not entred into the Land of another, nor had not come to conquer the Country of Italy, nor the dead corps had not wanted his graue: for oft times it chanceth, for not quenching a little coale of fire, a whole Forreſt and houſe is burned.
                     The diuine Plato among the Greeks, and Licurgus among the Lacedemonians, commanded and ordayned in all their lawes, That all the Plebeica women; and thoſe of mean eſtate, ſhould nouriſh all their children; and that thoſe which were Princeſſes &amp; great Ladyes, ſhould at the leaſt nouriſh their eldeſt and firſt begotten.
                     
                        Plutarch, in the booke of The raigne of Princes, ſaith, That the ſixth King of the Lacedemonians was Thomiſtes, the which, when hee dyed, left two children, of which, the ſecond inherited the Realme, becauſe the Queene her ſelfe had brought it vp: and the firſt did not inherite, becaue a ſtrange Nurſe had giuen it ſucke, and brought it vp. And hereof remained a cuſtome in the moſt part of the Realmes of Aſia, that the childe which was not A cuſtome of Aſia. nouriſhed with the papps of his mother, ſhould inherite none of his mothers goods. There was neuer, nor neuer ſhall be a mother that had ſuch a Sonne as the Mother of God, which had Ieſus Chriſt: nor there was neuer, nor neuer ſhall be a ſonne which had ſuch a mother in the world. But the Infant would neuer ſucke other milke, becauſe hee would not bee bound to call any other mother; nor the mother did giue him to nouriſh to any other mother, becauſe that no other woman ſhould call him ſonne.
                     I do not maruell at all, that Princeſſes and great Ladies doe giue their children foorth to nouriſh: but that which moſt I maruell at is, that ſhee which hath conceiued and brought foorth a childe, is aſhamed to giue it ſucke and to nouriſh it. I ſuppoſe that the Ladies do think, that they deſerue to conceiue them in their wombs, &amp; that they ſinne in nouriſhing them in their armes. I cannot tell how to write, and much leſſe how to vtter that which I would ſay, which is, that women are now adayes come into ſuch folly, that they thinke &amp; eſteeme it a ſtate to haue in their armes ſome little dogs: and they are aſhamed to nouriſh and giue their children ſucke with their owne breſts. O cruell mothers! I cannot thinke that your harts can bee ſo ſtony, to endure to ſee and keepe fantaſtic all Birds in cages, vnhappy Monkeys in the windowes, fiſting Spaniels betweene your armes, and ſo neglect and deſpiſe the ſweete Babes, caſting them out of your houſes where they were borne, and to put them into a ſtrange place where they are vnknowne. It is a thing which cannot be in nature, neither that honeſtie can endure, conſcience permit, nor yet conſonant either to diuine or humane lawes, that thoſe which GOD hath made Mothers of children, ſhould make themſelues Nurſes of dogges.
                     
                        Iunius Ruſticus, in the third The ſaying of Iunius Ruſtious. booke of the ſayings of the Ancients, ſaith, that Marcus Porcio, whoſe life and doctrine was a lanthorne and example to the Romane people, as a man much offended, ſaid on a day to the Senate. O Fathers conſcript! O curſed Rome! I cannot tel what now I ſhould ſay, ſith I haue ſeene in Rome ſuch monſtrous things (that is to ſay)

to ſee women carry Parrots on their fiſts, &amp; to ſee womē to nouriſh dogs, giuing them Milke from theyr owne breaſts. They replyed in the Senate, and ſaide: Tell vs Marcus Porcia, What wouldeſt thou wee ſhould doe which liue now, to reſemble our Fathers which are dead?
                     
                        Marcus Portio aunſwered them. The woman that preſumeth to be a Romain Matrone, ought to be found weauing in her houſe: and out of that, to bee How men and women ought to be ſtow theyr time. found in the Temple praying to God: and the Noble, and ſtoute Romaine, ought to be found in his Houſe, reading Bookes, and out of his houſe, fighting in the plaine Field, for the honor of his countrey: And ſurely theſe were wordes worthie of ſuch a man.
                     
                        Annius Minutius was a Noble Romaine, and captaine of great Pompeius, who was a great friend to Iulius Caeſar after the battell of Farſalie: For hee was an Auncient, and one that could giue good counſell, wherfore hee neuer ſcaped, but that hee was choſen in Rome, for Senatour, Conſull, or Cenſor euery yeare: For Iulius Caeſar was ſo mercifull to them that hee pardoned, thoſe which had been his moſt enemies in the warres, were of him in peace beſt beloued.
                     This Annius Minutius then beeing choſen Cenſour within Rome, (which was an Office hauing charge of Iuſtice) by chaunce as hee went to viſite the wife of another Friend of his, the which lay in Child-bed, (becauſe ſhe had great aboundance of milke) hee found that a little prettie Bitche did ſucke her: Vpon the which occaſion they ſay hee ſaide theſe wordes to the Senate, Fathers conſcript, a preſent miſchiefe is now at hand, according to the token I haue ſeen this day (that is to ſay,) I haue ſeene a Romaine woman denie her owne Children her milke, and gaue ſuck to a filthy bitche.
                     And truly this Annius had reaſon to eſteeme this caſe as a wonder: For the trueſt and ſweeteſt loues are not, but betweene the Fathers and Children: and where the mother embraceth the brute beaſt, and forſaketh her natural child which ſhe hath brought forth, it cannot bee otherwiſe, but there either wiſdome wanteth, or follie aboundeth: for the Foole loueth that hee ought to deſpiſe, and deſpiſeth that which he ought to loue.
                     Yet though the mothers will not giue their children ſucke, they ought to do What profit cometh to Women by giuing their childrē ſuck it for the danger which may come to the health of their perſons': for as the women which bring forth Children, doe liue more healthfull then thoſe which beare none: ſo theſe which doe nouriſh them, haue more health then thoſe which doe not nouriſh them.
                     For although the bringing vp of children be troubleſome to women, yet it is profitable for their health. I am aſhamed to tell it, but it is more ſhame for Ladyes to do it: to ſee what plaiſters they put to theyr Breaſts to drie vp their milke: and hereof commeth the iuſt iudgements of God, that in that place ofte times where they ſeeke to ſtoppe their milke, in the ſelfe ſame place, they themſelues pocure theyr ſudden death.
                     I aske now, if women do not enioy their children being young, what pleaſure hope they to haue of them when they be olde. What a great comfort is it for the Parents to ſee the young Babe, when hee will laugh? how hee twinckleth his little eyes: when he will weepe, how he will hang the pretie lippe: when he would ſpeake, how he will make ſignes with his litle fingers: when hee would goe how hee caſteth forward his feete: and aboue all, when he beginneth to babble: how he doubleth his words.
                     What thing is more pleaſant to the Father then to ſee them, and to the mother to agree to it, when the children

doe ſucke, they plucke forth the Breaſts with the one hand, and with the other they plucke their cradle, and further they beat their feete together, and with their wanton eyes, they caſt on theyr Parents a thouſand louing lookes, what is it to ſee them when they are vexed and angrie, how they will not be taken of the Fathers, how they ſtrike their Mother: they caſt away things of gold, and immediately they are appeaſed with a little apple, or ruſhe: What a thing is it to ſee the innocents how they anſwere, when a man asketh them? what follies they ſpeake, when they ſpeak to them? how they play with the dogges, and runne after the Catts? How they dreſſe them in wallowing in the duſt? how they make litle houſes of Earth in the ſtreetes? how they weepe after the birdes when they flie away? All the which things are not to the Eyes of the Fathers and Mothers, but as nightingales to ſing, and as Bread and meate to eate.
                     The Mothers peraduenture will ſay that they will not bring vp their children: becauſe when they are young, they are troubleſome, but that after they ſhold be nouriſhed and brought vppe, they would be glad.
                     To this I anſwer them, that the mothers ſhal not deny me, but that ſome of theſe things muſt needes meete in their children, that when they be olde they ſhalbe eyther proud, enuious, couetous, or negligent: that they ſhalbe Lecherous, or elſe Theeues, that they ſhalbe Blaſphemers, or elſe gluttons, that they ſhalbe rebells, or fooles, and diſobedient vnto their Fathers.
                     I belieue that at this day there are manie Mothers in the world, which did hope to be honoured, and ſerued with the Children which they hadde brought vp: and afterwards, perceyuing their manners, would willingly forgoe the pleaſures which they hoped for, ſo that they might alſo be deliuered from the troubles, which for their euill demeanours are like to enſue. For that time which the Parents hoped to paſſe with their Children in pleaſures, they conſume (ſeeing their vnthriftie life) in ſorrowfull ſobbes and ſighes.
                     I counſell, admoniſh, and humbly require Princeſſes and great Ladyes, to nouriſh and enioy their Children when they are young and tender: for How women ought to ſpend the time about theyr children. after that they are great, a man ſhall bring them newes euery day of diuers ſorts and māners they vſe: for aſmuch as the one ſhall ſay that her ſonne is in priſon: and another ſhall ſay that hee is ſore wounded: another, that he is hid: others, that hee hath played his cloke: others, that hee is ſlaundered with a common harlot: another, that he ſtealeth his goods from him: another, that his enemies doe ſeeke him: another, thet hee accompanieth with vnthrifts: And finally, they are ſo ſlurdie, vnhappie, and ſo farre from that which is good: that oftentimes the fathers would reioyce to ſee them die, rather then to ſee them liue ſo euill a life.
                     Mee thinketh that the knot of loue between the mother and the childe is ſo great, that not onely ſhe ought not to ſuffer them to be nouriſhed out of the houſe one whole yeare: but alſo Pleaſures that women may take in their children. ſhe ought not to ſuffer them to be out of her preſence one onely day. For in ſeeing him, ſhee ſeeth that which is borne of her entrailes: ſhe ſeeth that which ſhee hath with ſo great paines deliuered: ſhe ſeeth him who ought to inherite all her goods: ſhee ſeeth him in whome the memorie of their Aunceſtors remaineth: and ſhe ſeeth him, who after her death ought to haue the charge of her affayres and buſineſſe.
                     Concluding therefore, that which aboue is ſpoken (I ſay) that which the

great Plutarch ſaide; from whom I haue drawn the moſt part of this chapter: that the mother, (to bee a good Mother) ought to haue and keepe her Childe in her armes to nouriſh him, and afterwards when he ſhalbe great, ſhe ought to haue him in her hart, to helpe him. For we ſee oft times great euills enſue, to the Mother, and to the Childe, becauſe ſhe did not bring him vp her ſelfe: and to put him to nouriſh to a ſtraunge breaſt, there commeth neither honour nor profite.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XX. ¶ That Princeſſes &amp; great Ladyes ought to bee very circumſpect in chooſing of their Nurſes. Of ſeuen propertyes which a good Nurſe ſhould haue.
                     
                     
                        THoſe which ordayned Lawes for the people to liue, were The lawes of the Auncients. theſe; Promotheans, which gaue lawes to the Egyptians: Solon Solinon, to the Greekes, Moyſes to the Iewes, Lycurgus to the Lacedemonians, and Numa Pompilius to the Romains: for before theſe Princes came, their people were not gouerned by written lawes, but by good auncient cuſtomes.
                     The intention of theſe Excellent Princes was, not to giue lawes to their predeceſſors, for they were now dead: neyther they gaue thē onely for thoſe which liued in their time being wicked, but alſo for thoſe which were to come, whome they did preſtippoſe would not be good. For the more the World increaſeth in yeares, ſo much the more it is loaden with vices.
                     By this that I haue ſpoken, I meane, that if the Princeſſes and great Ladies euery one of them would Nouriſh their owne childe, I neede not to giue them counſell. But ſince, I haue ſuppoſed that the women which ſhall be deliuered hereafter, will be as proude and vaine-glorious, as thoſe which were in times paſt: We will not let to declare here ſome Lawes and aduiſes how the Ladie ought to behaue her ſelfe with her Nurce, and how the Nurce ought to content her ſelfe with the creature. For it is but iuſt, that if the mother be cruell, and hardie to forſake the creature, that ſhe be ſage, pitifull, and aduiſed to choſe her Nurce.
                     If a man finde great treaſure, and afterwards care not how to keepe it, but doeth commit into the hands of ſuſpected perſons, truly we would call him a foole. For that which naturally is beloued, is alwayes of all beſt kept.
                     The Woman ought more wiſely to keepe the treaſure of her own bodie, then the treaſure of all the Earth (if ſhe had it.) And the Mother which What care Women ought to haue of their children. doth the contrarie, and that committeth her Childe to the cuſtodie of a ſtraunge Nurce, not to her whome ſhee thinketh beſt, but whom ſhe findeth beſt cheape: we will not call her a fooliſh beaſt, for that name is too vnſeemly) out we will call her a ſotte, which is ſomewhat more honeſter.
                     One of the things that doth make vs moſt belieue that the ende of the world is at hand: is, to ſee the little loue which the mother doth beare to the childe being young, and to ſee the want of loue which the Childe hath beare to his Mother being aged. That which the childe doeth to the Father and Mother, is the iuſt iudgement of God: that euen as the Father would not nouriſh the child in his houſe, being young: ſo likewiſe that the ſonne ſhould not ſuffer the Father in his houſe, he being olde.
                     Returning therefore to the matter, that ſith the woman doth determine to drie and ſhut vp the fountaines of

milke which Nature hath giuen her, ſhee ought to bee very diligent; to ſearch out a good nurſe: the which ought not only to content herſelfe to haue her milke whole, but alſo that ſhee be good of life. For otherwiſe, the childe ſhal not haue ſo much profite by the which hee ſucketh, as the nurſe ſhall doe it harme, if ſhee bee a woman of an euill life.
                     I doe aduiſe Princeſſes and great Dames, that they watch diligently to knowe what their Nurſes are, before they commit their children to them: for, if ſuch Nurſes be euill, and ſlaundered, they are as Serpents which doe A good example for women. byte the Mother with their mouth, and do ſting the childe with her taile. In my opinion it were leſſe euill, the Mother ſhould ſuffer that her Childe ſhould periſh in deliuering it: then for to keepe in her houſe an euill woman. For the ſorrow of the death of the Childe is forgotten and brought to nought in time, but the ſlaunder of her houſe ſhall endure as long as ſhee liueth.
                     
                        Sextus Cheronenſis ſayeth, that the Emperor Marcus Aurelius commanded his Sonne to be brought vp of a woman, the which was more faire, thē vertuous. And when the good Emperour was aduertiſed thereof, he did not onely ſend her from his Pallace, but alſo hee baniſhed and exiled her from Rome: ſwearing that if ſhe had not nouriſhed his Sonne with her pappes, he would haue commaunded her to haue been torne in pieces with Beaſts. For the woman of an euill renowme, may iuſtly bee condemned, and put to death.
                     Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought not greatly to paſſe, whether the nurſes be faire or fowle: For if the milke be ſweete, white, and tender, it little skilleth though the face of the Nurſe be white, or blacke.
                     
                        Sextus Cheronenſis ſaith, in the booke of the nurture of children, that euen as the black Earth is more fertile then is the white earth: So likewiſe, the Woman which is browne in countenance, hath alwayes the moſt ſubſtantiall milke.
                     
                        Paulus Dyaconus, in his greateſt Hyſtorie, ſaieth, that the Emperour Adocerus did Marrie himſelfe with the daughter of another Emperour, his predeceſſor called Zeno, and the Empreſſe was called Arielna: The which in bringing forth a Sonne, had a woman of Hungarie, maruellous faire, to nouriſh it, and the caſe ſucceeded in ſuch ſort, that the Nurſe for beeing faire, had by the Emperor iij. children the one after the other: and his wofull Wife neuer had any but the firſt alone.
                     A man ought to belieue that the Empreſſe Arielna did not only repent her ſelfe, for taking into her houſe ſo faire a Nurſe: but alſo was ſorry that A good example for all ſorts of women. euer ſhee had any at all; ſith the Ribalde thereby was Miſtreſſe in the houſe, and ſhe remained without huſband all her life.
                     I doe not ſay it, for that there are not many foule women vicious, nor yet becauſe there are not many faire women vertuous: but that Princeſſes and great Ladyes, (according to the qualities of their Husbands) ought to bee profitable and tender Nurſes, to bring vp their Children. For in this caſe there are ſome men of ſo weake a complexion, that in ſeeing a little cleane water, immediately they die to drinke thereof. Let therefore this be the firſt counſell in chooſing Nurſes, that the Nurſe before ſhee enter into the houſe be examined, if ſhee be honeſt and vertuous. For it is a tryſ
                           •
                        e whether the Nurſe be faire or foule: but that ſhe be of a good life, and of an honeſt behauiour.
                     Secondarily, it is neceſſary that the Nurſe which nouriſheth the child, be

not onely good in behauiour of her life: but alſo it is neceſſary that ſhe be whole, as touching the bodily health. For it is a rule vnfallible, that of the milke which we do ſucke in our infancie, dependeth all the corporal health of our life.
                     A childe giuen to the Nurſe to nouriſh, is as a Tree remoued from one place to another. And if it be ſo (as in deed it is) it behoueth in all points, that if the Earth wherein it ſhall be newe put, were no better, that at the leaſt it be not worſe: For this ſhould bee a great crueltie, that the Mother beeing whole, ſtrong, and well diſpoſed, ſhould giue her Childe to a leane woman to nurſe, which is feeble, ſore, and diſeaſed.
                     Princeſſes and great Ladyes, doe choſe leane women, weake, and ſicke, for to nouriſh their Infants. And in that they doe faile, it is not for that they would erre: But it is becauſe that ſuch feeble and weake Nurſes, (by a vaine deſire they haue to be Nurſes in a Gentlemans houſe) on the one part they ſay they will little money, and on the other part, they doe make great ſuites.
                     What thing it is when a Princeſſe or a Noble-woman is deliuered of a Childe? to ſee the deuiſes of other women among themſelues, who ſhall be the Nurſe: and how thoſe which neuer nouriſhed their owne children, doe preſerue the milke to nouriſh the children of others? To procure this thing for women, me thinketh it proceedeth of aboundance of follie, and to condeſcend to their requeſts, mee thinketh it is for want of wiſedome.
                     They looke not alwayes to the manners and abilitie of the Nurſe, how apt ſhee is to nurſe their childe: but how diligent ſhee is to haue to nouriſh. They eare not greatly whether they be good or no: For if the firſt be not good, they wil take the ſecond, and if the ſecond pleaſeth them not, they will haue the third: and ſo vpwards, vntil they haue found a good Nurſe. But I let you to know (you What inconueniēce cometh by changing Nurſes. Princeſſes and great Ladyes) that it is more daunger for the Children to chaunge diuers milkes, then vnto the olde men to eate diuers meates.
                     Wee ſee daily by experience, that without compariſon, there dyeth more children of Noble-women, thē children of women of the meaner eſtate. And wee will not ſay, that it is for that they do flatter their children more, nor for that the wiues of labourers doe eate fine meates: but that it chaunceth oft times, that the children of a poore woman doth neither eate nor drinke, but of one kinde of meat, or milke in two yeares: and the child of a Ladie ſhal change and alter three Nurſes in two moneths.
                     If Princeſſes and great Ladyes were circumſpect in chooſing their nurſes, and that they did looke whether they were whole, without diſeaſes, and honeſt in their manners, and would not regarde ſo much the importunitie of their ſuites: the Mothers ſhould excuſe themſelues from many ſorrowes, and the children likewiſe, ſhould bee deliuered from many diſeaſes.
                     One of the moſt renowmed Princes in times paſt, was Titus, the Sonne of Veſpaſian, and Brother of Domitian. Lampriains ſaieth, that this good Emperour Titus (the moſt part of his life) was ſubiect to grieuous diſeaſes, &amp; infirmities of his perſon: and the cauſe was, for that when hee was young, he was, giue to a ſicke Nurſe to be nouriſhed; So that this good Emperour ſucking her Dugge but a while, was conſtrayned to paſſe all his life after in paine.
                     Thirdly, Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought to know, and vnderſtand the complexion of their children: to the ende that according to the ſame,

they might ſeeke pitifull Nurſes: that is to ſay, if the childe were Cholerick, Flegmatcke, Sanguine, or Melancholie. For looke what humor the childe is of, of the ſame qualitie the milke of the Nurſe ſhould be.
                     If vnto an old corrupted man they miniſter medicins conformable to his diſeaſes, for to cure him, why then ſhould not the Mother ſeeke a wholeſome Nurſe to the tender Babe, agreable to his complexion, to nouriſh him? And if thou ſayeſt, it is iuſt, that the fleſh olde and corrupted bee ſuſtained: I tell thee likewiſe, that it is much more neceſſary that the Children ſhould bee curiouſly and well nouriſhed, to multiplie the world: For in the ende wee doe not ſay, it is time that the Young leaue the bread for the Aged: but contrarie, it is time, that the olde leaue the bread for the young.
                     
                        Ariſtotle in the booke De ſecretis ſecretorum, and Iunius Ruſticus, in the Ariſt. de ſecret. ſecretorum. tenth booke De geſtis Perſarum, ſay: that the vnfortunate king Darius (who was ouercom by Alexander the great) had a Daughter of a maruellous beauty. And they ſay that the Nurſe which gaue ſuck to this daughter, all the time that ſhee did nouriſh it, did neyther eate nor drinke any thing but poyſon: and at the ende of three yeares, when the Childe was weyned, and plucked from the dugge, ſhe did eate nothing but Colubers, and other venomous wormes.
                     I haue hearde ſay many times that the Emperors had a cuſtome to nouriſh their Heyres and Children with poiſons when they were young, to the intent that they ſhould not be hurt by poyſon, afterwarde when they were old. And this error cometh of thoſe which preſume much, and know little. And therefore I ſay, that I haue heard ſay, without ſaying I haue read it. For ſome declare hyſtories, more for that they haue hearde ſay of others: then for that they haue read themſelues.
                     The truth in this caſe is, that as wee vſelat this preſent, to weare chaines of golde about our neckes, or iewells on our fingers, ſo did the gentils in times paſt, a Ring on their fingers, or ſome iewell in theyr boſome, repleniſhed with poyſon. And becauſe the Paynims did neither feare hell, nor hoped for heauen, they had that cuſtome: for if at any times in Battell they ſhould finde themſelues in diſtreſſe, they had rather ende their liues with poyſon, then to receyue any iniurie of theyr enemyes. Then if it were true, that thoſe Princes had bin nouriſhed with that Poyſon, they would not haue carryed it about them to haue ended their liues.
                     Further, I ſay, that the Princes of How children ought to be nouriſhed and brought vp. 
                        Perſia did vſe when they had any child borne, to giue him milke to ſucke agreable to the Complexion hee had. Since this daughter of Darius was of melancholy humor, they determined to bring her vp with venom and poyſon: becauſe all thoſe which are pure melancholie, do liue with ſorrow, and die with pleaſure.
                     
                        Ignatius the Venetian, in the life of the fiue Emperours, Palleolus (which were valiant Emperours in Conſtantinople,) ſayeth: that the ſecond of that name, called Palleolus the hardie, was after the xl. yeares of his age, ſo troubled with infirmities and diſeaſes, that alwayes of the twelue moneths of the yeare, he was in his bed ſick nine moneths: and being ſo ſicke as he was, the affayres and buſineſſe of the Empire were but ſlenderly done and looked vnto. For the Prince cannot haue ſo ſmall a Feuer, but the people in the common-wealth muſt haue it double,
                     This Emperour Palleolus had a wife, whoſe name was Huldonina, the which after ſhe had brought all the Phyſitions of Aſia vnto her Husband, and

that ſhee had miniſtred vnto him all the medicines ſhee could learne to helpe him, and in the end ſeeing nothing auaile, there came by chaunce an old woman, a Grecian borne, who preſumed to haue great knowledge in hearbes, and ſayd vnto the Empreſſe. Noble Empreſſe Huldouina, If thou wilt that the Emperour thy huſband liue long, ſee that thou chafe, anger, 
                        Good counſell for one that would liue long. 
                        and vexe him euery weeke at the leaſt twiſe: for hee is of a pure melancholy humour, and therefore hee that doth him pleaſure, augmenteth his diſeaſe: and hee that vexeth him ſhall prolong his life.
                     
                     The Empreſſe Huldouina followed the counſell of this Greeke woman, which was occaſion that the Emperour liued afterwardes ſound and whole many yeeres: ſo that of the nine monethes which hee was accuſtomed to be ſicke euery yeere, in twenty yeeres afterwards he was not ſicke three monethes. For where as this Greeke woman commaunded the Empreſſe to anger her husband but twice in the week, ſhe accuſtomably angred him iiii. times in the day.
                     Fourthly, the good mother ought to take heede, that the nurſe be very temperat in eating, ſo that ſhe ſhould eate little of diuers meates, and of thoſe few diſhes ſhe ſhould not eate too much. To vnderſtand the thing yee muſt know, that the white milke is no other then bloud which is ſodden, &amp; that which cauſeth the good or euill bloud, commeth oft times of an other thing, but that eyther the perſon in temperate, or elſe a glutton in
                           •
                        ating, and therefore it is a thing both healthful and neceſſary, that the nurſe that nouriſheth the child doe eate good meates: for among men and women it is a generall rule, that in litle eating there is no danger and of too much eating there is no profite. As all the Phyloſophers ſay, the wolfe is one of the beaſts that denoureth moſt, and is moſt greedyeſt, and therefore hee is moſt feared of all the Shepheards.
                     But Ariſtotle, in his third booke De Animalibus ſaith: That whē the wolfe doeth once feele her ſelfe great with young, in all her life after ſhee neuer Ariſtot: De Animalib: ſuffereth herſelfe to bee coupled with the wolfe againe. For otherwiſe, if the wolfe ſhold yearely bring forth vij. or viij. whelps (as commonly ſhe doth, and the Sheepe but one lambe, there would be in ſhort ſpace, more wolues thē ſheepe. Beſide all this, the wolfe hath an other propertie, which is, that although ſhe be a Beaſt moſt deuouring and greedie: yet when ſhe hath whelped, ſhe feedeth very temperately, and it is to the ende to nouriſh her whelps, and to haue good milke. And beſides that, ſhe doth eate but once in the day, the which the dogwolfe doth prouide, both for the Bitch &amp; whelps.
                     Truly it is a monſtrous thing to ſee, and noyſome to heare, and no leſſe ſlaunderous to ſpeake: that a Wolfe which giueth ſucke to viij. whelps, eateth but one only kinde of meate, and the woman which giueth ſucke but to one Childe alone, will eate of vii. or viii. ſortes of meates. And the cauſe hereof is, that the Beaſt doth not eate but to ſuſtain nature, &amp; a womā doth not eate, but to ſatisfie her pleaſure.
                     Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought to watche narrowly, to know when &amp; how much the Nurſes do eate, which doe nouriſh their children: For the child is ſo tender, and the milk ſo delicate, that with eating of ſundry meats What Dyet Nurſes ought to vſe. they become corrupt, and with eating much they waxefat. If the childrē ſuck thoſe which are fat &amp; groſſe, they are cōmonly ſicke: and if they ſucke milke corrupted, they oft times goe to bed whole, &amp; in the morne be found dead Iſidor in his etimologies ſaith, that the men of the prouince of Thrace were ſo

cruell that the one did eate the other: and they did not onely this, but alſo further to ſhew more their immanity in the ſculs of thoſe that were dead, they dranke the bloud of him that was lately aliue. Though men were ſo cruell to eate mens fleſh, and to drinke the bloud of the veines; yet the Women which nouriſhed their children, were ſo temperate in eating, that they did eate nothing but netles ſodden, and boiled in Goates milk. And becauſe the women of Thrace were ſo moderate in eating, the Phlioſopher Solon Solynon brought ſome to Athens: for the Auncients ſought no leſſe to haue good women in the common-wealth, then to haue hardy and valiant Captaines in the warre.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXI. The Author addeth three other conditions to a good nurſe that giueth ſucke: that they drinke no wine, that ſhee be honeſt, and chiefly that ſhee bee well conditioned.
                     
                     
                        THe Princeſſes and great Ladies may know by this example, what difference there is between the women An example of the women of Thrace. of Thrace, which are fedde with nettles only, and haue brought forth ſuch fierce men, and the womē of our time, which throgh their delicate and exceſſiue eating, bring forth ſuch weake and feeble children.
                     Fiftly, the Ladies ought to bee very circumſpect, not onely that Nurſes eate not much, and that they bee not greedy: but alſo that they be in wine temperate, the which in olde time was not called wine, but venom. The reaſon hereof is apparant and manifeſt enough: For if wee doe forbid the fatte meates which lyeth in the ſtomacke, wee ſhould then much more forbid the moyſt Wine, which waſheth all the veynes of the bodie.
                     And further I ſay, that as the Childe hath no other nouriſhment but the milke only, and that the milke proceedeth of bloud, and that bloud is nouriſhed of the wine, and that wine is naturally hote, from the firſt to the laſt.
                     I ſay, that Woman which drinketh wine, and giueth the child ſucke, Women giuing ſucke, ought to abſtaine from wine. doth as ſhee that maketh a great Fire vnder the panne, where there is but a little milke: ſo that the pan burneth, and the milke runneth ouer.
                     I will not denie, but that ſomtimes it may chaunce, that the childe ſhal be of a ſtrong complexion, and the Nurſe of a feeble and weake nature: and then the childe would more ſubſtantial milke, when the woman is not able to giue it him.
                     In ſuch a caſe, (though with other things Milke may be conferred,) I allow that the nurſe drinke a little wine: but it ſhould bee ſo little, and ſo well watered, that it ſhould rather bee to take away the vnſauorineſſe of the water, then for to taſte of any ſauour of the wine.
                     I do not ſpeake this without a cauſe, for the nurſe being ſicke, and feeble of herſelfe, and her milke not ſubſtantial, it oftentimes moueth her to eat more then neceſſity requireth, and to drinke wine which is ſomewhat nutritiue: So that they ſuppoſing to giue the Nurſe Triacle, doe giue her poyſon to deſtroy her childe.
                     Thoſe excellent and Auncient Romaines, if they had been in our time, and that wee hadde deſerued to haue beene in their time, (although our time, for being Chriſtians is better)

they had ſaued vs from this trauell: For they were ſo temperate in eating meates, and ſo abſtinent, in drinking wines, that they did not only refraine the drinking thereof, but alſo they would not abide to ſmell it. For it was counted a greater ſhame vnto a Romane Woman to drinke wine, then to be diuorced from her Husband.
                     
                        Dyoniſius Alicarnaſeus, in his booke of the lawes of the Romaines, ſaid: that Romulus was the firſt founder of Rome, and that hee occupyed himſelfe more in buylding faire Houſes to amplifye Rome, then in conſtituting Lawes for the gouernement of the Commonwealth: But amongſt fifteene Lawes which hee made, the ſeuenth thereof was, that no Romaine woman on paine of death ſhould be ſo hardie to drinke wine, within the walls of Rome.
                     
                     The ſame Hyſtorian ſayth, that by Womē prohibited to drink: wine in former times. the occaſion of this Law the cuſtome was in Rome, that when any Romane Ladie would drinke wine, or make any ſolemne feaſt, ſhe muſt needs goe out of Rome, where euery one had theyr Gardens and dwelling place: becauſe the ſmel alſo of Wine was prohibited and forbidden women within the circuit of Rome.
                     
                     If Plinie do not deceiue vs in his 24. booke of his natural hiſtorie, it was an ancient cuſtom in Rome, that at each time that Parents met, both men and women, they did kiſſe the one the other in the face, in token of peace: and this ceremonie beganne firſt, for that they would ſmell whether the woman had drunke any wine. And if perchance ſhe ſauored of wine, the Cenſor might haue banniſhed her from Rome.
                     
                     And if her kinſman found her without Rome, hee might freely &amp; without any daunger of law put her to death: becauſe within the Circuit and walles of Rome, no priuate man by Iuſtice, could put any Romaine to death, as aboue is rehearſed.
                     
                        Romulus was he which ordained the paine for Drunkardes, and Ruptilius was hee, which ordained the penaltie for Adulterers. And betweene Romulus and Ruptilius, there was xxxii. yeares: So that they ordyaned this ſtreight Law for Drunkardes, a long time before they did the law for adulterers. For if a woman be a drunkard, or Harlot, truely they are both great faultes, and I cannot tell whether of them is worſt: For being a harlot, the woman loſeth her name: and for being a drunkarde, ſhee loſeth her fame, and the Husband his goods.
                     Then if women for, the honeſtie of their peſons onely, are bound to bee temperate in eating and drinking the woman which nouriſheth and giueth

                         the Childe ſucke, ought to bee much more corrected and ſober in this caſe. For in her is concurrant not only the grauity of their own perſons, but the health and life alſo of the Creature, which ſhe nouriſheth. Therefore it is meete, that the Nurſe bee kept from wine: ſince the honor of the one, and the life of the other is in perill.
                     Sixtly, the Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought to take heede, that theyr Nurſes be not gotten with child. And the reaſon hereof is, that in that time when the woman is with Childe, her naturall courſe is ſtopped, and that corruption is mingled with the pure bloud: So that ſhee thinking to giue the childe milke to nouriſh it, giueth it poyſon to deſtroy it. And nothing can bee more vniuſt, then to put the childe (which is alreadie borne, and aliue) in danger for that which is as yet vnborne, and dead. It is a wonderfull thing, (for a man that will curiouſly note and mark things) to ſee the brute beaſts, that all the time they bring vp theyr little ones, they will not conſent to accompanie with the Males, nor the males will follow the females.

And that which is moſt to hee noted, it is, to ſee, what paſſeth betweene the Byrds: for the ſhe Sparrow will not ſuffer the Male, in any wiſe to touch nor to come neere her, vntill her little ones be great &amp; able to flie: and much leſſe to ſit vpon any Egges, to hatche them, till the other be fled and gone.
                     
                        Plutarch in the ſeuenth of his Regiment of Princes, ſaith, that Gneus Fuluius (Couzin germaine of Pompeyus.) beeing Conſull in Rome, fell in loue with a young maidē of Capua being an orphā, whether he fled for the plague.
                     This Mayden was called Sabina, and when ſhe was great with child by this Conſull, ſhee brought forth a daughter, whom they called faire Druſia: &amp; truely ſhe was more commended for her beautie, then ſhee was for her honeſtie. For oft times it happeneth that the fayre and diſhoneſt women leaue their Children ſo euill taught, that of their Mothers they inherite little goods, and much diſhonour This Sabina therefore beeing deliuered (as it was the cuſtome of Rome) ſhe did with her own breaſts nouriſh her daughter Druſia. During the which time ſhee was gotten with childe, by one of the Knights of this Conſul, to whome (as to his Seruant) hee had giuen her to keepe.
                     Wherefore when the Conſull was heereof aduertiſed, and that notwithſtanding ſhe gaue her daughter ſuck: he commanded that the knight ſhold be immediatly beheaded, &amp; his louer Sabina forthwith to be caſt into a wel.
                     The day of Execution came, that both theſe parties ſhould ſuffer, wherfore the wofull Sabina ſent to beſeech the Conſull, that it would pleaſe him before her death to giue her audience of one ſole worde, that ſhee would ſpeake vnto him: the which beeing come in the preſence of them all, ſhee ſaid vnto him.
                     O Gneus Fuluius; know thou that I did not call thee to the ende thou ſhouldeſt graunt me life, but becauſe I would not die before I had ſeene thy face: though thou of thy ſelfe ſhouldeſt remember, that as I am a frayle The ſpeech of Sabina. Woman, and fell into ſinne with thee in Capua, ſo I might fall now (as I haue done) with another here in Rome.
                     
                     For, wee Women are ſo fraile in this caſe, during the time of this our miſerable life, that none can keepe herſelfe ſure, from the aſſaultes of the weake Fleſh.
                     The Conſull Gneus Fuluius to theſe words anſwered: The Gods immortall know Sabina, what griefe it is to my wofull hart, that I of my ſecret offence The anſwer of the Conſull Fuluius. ſhould be an open ſcourge. For greater honeſtie it is for men to hyde your frailneſſe, then openly to puniſh your offences. But what wilt thou I ſhould doe in this caſe: conſidering the offence thou haſt committed? By the immortall Gods, I ſweare vnto thee, and again I ſweare, that I had rather thou ſhouldeſt ſecretly haue procured the death of ſome man, thē that openly in this wiſe thou ſhouldſt haue ſlaunderd my houſe. For thou knoweſt the true meaning of the common prouerbe in Rome, It is better to die in honour, then to liue in infamie. And think not (Sabina) that I do condemne thee to die becauſe thou forgoteſt thy Faith vnto my perſon, and that thou gaueſt thy ſelfe vnto him which kept thee: For ſince thou wert not my wife, the liberty thou haddeſt to come with me from Capua to Rome, the ſelfeſame thou hadſt to goe with another from Rome to Capua. It is an euill thing for vicious

                        , to reprooue the vices of others, wherein themſelues are faulty.
                     The cauſe why I condemn thee to dye, is onely for the remembrance of the old Law, the which commandeth that no nurſe or woman giuing ſucke; ſhould on paine of death be begotten with childe, truly the Law is very iuſt.

For honeſt women do not ſuffer, that in giuing her child ſucke at her breaſt, ſhe ſhold hide another in her entrails.
                     Theſe words paſſed between Gneus Fuluius the Conſul, and the Ladie Sabina of Capua. Howbeit as Plutarche ſaith, in that place the Conſull had pitie vpon her, and ſhewed her fauour, baniſhing her vpon condition, neuer to returne to Rome againe
                     
                        Cinna Catullus, in the fourth booke of the xxij Conſulls ſaith: that Caius Fabricius, was one of the moſt notable Conſulles that euer was in Rome, and was ſore afflicted with diſeaſes in his life, onely becauſe hee was nouriſhed foure moneths with the milke of a Nurſe being great with Childe: and for feare of this, they locked the nurſe with the Childe in the Temple of the Veſtall virgines, where for the ſpace of iij. yeares they were kept.
                     They demaunded the Conſul, why he did not nouriſh his children in his houſe? He anſwered, that children being nouriſhed in the houſe, it might bee an occaſion that the Nurſe ſhould Wherefore the Conſull would not haue his children nouriſhed in his houſe. begottē with child, and ſo ſhe ſhould deſtroy the children with her corrupt milke: and further giue me occaſion to do iuſtice vpon her perſon: wherefore keeping them ſo ſhut vp, wee are occaſion to preſerue their life, and alſo our children from perill.
                     
                        Dyodorus Siculus, in his librairy, and Sextus Cheronenſis ſaith, in the life of Marc. Aurelius, that in the Iſles of Baleares there was a cuſtom, that the nurſes of young children, (whether they were their owne or others) ſhould be ſeuered from their Husbands, for the ſpace of two yeares. And the woman which at that time (though it were by her husband) were with child, though they did not chaſten her as an adultereſſe: yet euery man ſpake euill of her, as of an offender.
                     During the time of theſe two yeares to the ende that the Husband ſhould take no other wife, they commanded that hee ſhould take a concubine: or that hee ſhould buye a Slaue, whoſe companie hee might vſe as his wife: for amongſt theſe barbarous, hee was honoured moſt that had two Wiues, the one with child, and the other not.
                     By theſe Examples aboue recited, Princeſſes and great Ladyes may ſee, what watch &amp; care they ought to take in chooſing their Nurſes, that they be honeſt, ſince of them dependeth not onely the health of their children, but alſo the good fame of their houſes. The ſeuēth condition is, that Princeſſes and great ladies ought to ſee their What is required in euery good Nurſe. nurſes haue good conditions: ſo that they be not troubleſome, proud, harlots, liars, malicious, nor flatterers: for the viper hath not ſo much poyſon, as the woman which is euil cōditioned.
                     It little auaileth a man to take wine from a woman, to entreate her to eate little, and to withdrawe her from her husband, if of her owne nature ſhe be hatefull, and euill mannered: for it is not ſo great dāger vnto the child, that the nurſe be a drunkard, or a glutton, as it is if ſhe be harmfull &amp; malitious.
                     If perchaunce the Nurſe (that nouriſheth the child) be euil conditioned. truly ſhe is euill troubled, &amp; the houſe wherin ſhe dwelleth euil cōbred. For ſuch one doth importune the Lorde, troubleth the Lady, putteth in hazard the childe, &amp; aboue all, is not contented with her ſelfe. Finally, Fathers for giuing too much libertie to their nurſes, oft times are the cauſes of manie practiſes, which they doe: wherewith in the ende, they are grieued with the death of their childrē which foloweth Amongſt all theſe which I haue read, I ſay, that of the ancient Roman Princes, of ſo good a Father, as Druſius Germanicus was, neuer came ſo wicked a ſon as Caligula was, being the iiij Emp: of Rome: for the Hyſtoriographers were not ſatisfied to enrich the

praiſe the excellencies of his Father, neyther ceaſed they to blame and reprehend the infamies of his Sonne. And they ſay that his naughtines proceedeth not of the mother which bare him: but of the nurſe which gaue him ſucke. For often times it chaunceth that the tree is green and good, when it is planted, and afterwardes it becometh drie and withered, onely for being carryed into another place.
                     
                        Dyon the Greeke in the ſecond book of Caeſars ſaieth, that a curſed woman of Campania called Preſſilla, nouriſhed and gaue ſuck vnto this wicked child. Shee had againſt all nature of women her breaſts as hayrie as the beardes of The deſcription of Preſsilla. men: and beſides that, in running a Horſe, handling her ſtaffe, ſhooting in the Croſſe-bowe, fewe young men in Rome were to bee compared vnto her.
                     It chaunced on a time that as ſhee was giuing ſucke to Caligula, for that ſhee was angrie, ſhee tore in pieces a young child, and with the bloud therof annoynted her breaſts: and ſo ſhe made Caligula the young Childe, to ſucke together both bloud and milke.
                     The ſaide Dyon in his booke of the life of the Emperour Caligula ſaieth: that the women of Campania (whereof the ſaide Preſſilla was) had this cuſtom, that whē they would giue their Teat to the childe, firſt they did annointe the nipple, with the bloud of a hedge-hog, to the ende their children might be more fierce and cruell.
                     And ſo was this Caligula, for hee was not contented to kill a man onely, but alſo hee ſucked the bloud that remained on his Sworde, and licked it off with his tongue.
                     The excellent Poet Homer, meaning to ſpeake plainely of the crueltyes of Pyrrus, ſaide in his Odiſſe of him, ſuch wordes: Pyrrus was borne in Greece, nouriſhed in Archadie, and brought vp with Tygers milke, which is a cruell beaſt, as if more plainely he had ſaide: Pyrrus for being borne in Greece was Sage, for that hee was brought vp in Archadie, he was ſtrong and couragious, &amp; for to haue ſucked Tygars milke, he was very proud and cruell. Hereof may be gathered, that the great Grecian Pyrrus, for wanting of good milke, was ouercome with euill conditions.
                     The ſelfe ſame Hyſtorian Dyon ſaith, in the life of Tiberius; that hee was a great Drunkard. And the cauſe hereof was, that the Nurſe did not onely drinke wine: but alſo ſhe weyned the childe with ſoppes dipped in Wine. What is required of a Nurſe for bringing vp of children. And without doubt the curſed Woman had done leſſe euill, if in the ſtead of milke, ſhe had giuen the child poyſon, without teaching it to drinke wine: wherefore afterwardes he loſt his renowne.
                     For truely, the Romane Empire had loſt little if Tiberius had dyed being a childe: and it had wonne much, if he had neuer knowne what drinking of Wine had meant.
                     I haue declared all that which before is mentioned, to the intent that Princeſſes and great Ladyes might be aduertiſed, that ſince in not nouriſhing their children, they ſhew themſelues cruel: yet at the leaſt, in prouiding for thē good Nurſes, they ſhold ſhew themſelues pittifull: for the children oft times follow more the condition of the milke which they ſucke, then the condition of their mothers which brought them forth, or of their fathers which begot them. Therefore they ought to vſe much circumſpection herein: for in them conſiſteth the fame of the wiues, the honour of the husband, and the wealth of their children.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXII. Of the Diſputations before Alexander the great, concerning the time of the ſucking of Babes.
                     
                     
                        
                           OVintus Curtins ſaith, that after the great Alexander (which which was the laſt King of the Macedonians, and firſt Emperour of the Greekes) had ouercome King Darius, and that he ſaw himſelfe onely Lord of all Aſia, he went to reſt in Babylon: for among men of warre there was a cuſtome, that after they had beene long in the warres, euery one ſhould retire to his owne houſe. King Philip (which was father of King Alexander) alwayes counſelled his ſonne, that he ſhould leade with him to the warres What is required of a good Captaine. valiant Captaines, to conquere the World: and that out of his Realmes and Dominions hee ſhould take and chuſe the wiſeſt men, and beſt experimented, to gouerne the Empire. Hee had reaſon in ſuch wiſe to counſell his ſonne: for by the counſell of Sages, that is kept and maintained, which by the ſtrength of valiant men is gotten and wonne.
                     
                        Alexander the great therefore being in Babylon, after hee had conquered all the Countrey, ſince all the Citie was vicious, and his Armie ſo long without warres, ſome of his owne men began to robbe one another, others to play their own, ſome to force women, and others to make banquets and feaſts: &amp; when ſome wee drunk, others rayſed quarrels, ſtrifes, and diſcentions: ſo that a man could not tell whether was greater, the ruſt in their Armours, or the corruptions in their cuſtomes. For the propertie of mans malice is, that when the gate is open to idleneſſe, infinite vices enter into the houſe.
                     
                        Alexander the great ſeeing the diſſolution which was in his Armie, and the loſſe which might enſue heereof vnto his great Empire, commanded ſtraightly, that they ſhould make a ſhew and iuſt thorow Babylon, to the How Alexander gouerned his armie. end that the men of warre ſhould exerciſe their forces thereby. And as Ariſtotle ſaith, in the book of the Queſtions of Babylon, the Turney was ſo much vſed amongſt them, that ſometimes they carryed away more dead and wounded men, then of a bloudie battaile of the enemie. Speaking according to the lawe of the Gentiles, (which looked not glory for their vertues, nor feared hell to dye) at the Turney the commandement of Alexander was very iuſt, for that doing as he did to the Armie: he defaced the vice which did waſte it, and for himſelfe he got perpetuall memory, and alſo it was cauſe of much ſuertie in the Common-weale.
                     This good Prince, not contented to exerciſe his army ſo, but ordayned, that daily in his preſence the Philoſophers ſhould diſpute, and the queſtion wherein they ſhould diſpute, Alexander himſelfe would propound, whereof followed, that the great Alexander was made certaine of that wherein hee doubted: and ſo by his wiſedome all men exerciſed their crafts and wits. For in this time of idleneſſe, the bookes were no leſſe marred with duſt, becauſe they were not opened, then the weapons were with ruſt, which were not occupyed.
                     There is a booke of Ariſtotle, intituled The Queſtions of Babilon, where he ſayd, that Alexander propounded, the Philoſophers diſputed, the Principalles of Perſia, replyed, and Ariſtotle determined: and ſo continued in diſputations as long as Alexander did eate: for at the Table of Alexan
                        
                        
                        der, one day the Captaines reaſoned of matters of warre, and another day the Philoſophers diſputed of their Philoſophie.
                     
                        Blundus ſaieth, in the booke intituled, Italia Illuſtrata, that among the Princes of Perſia there was a cuſtome, that none could ſit downe at the Table, vnleſſe hee were a King that had A cuſtome among the Perſians. ouercome another King in battaile; and none could ſpeake at their table, but a Philoſopher. And truely, the cuſtome was very notable, and worthy to be noted: for there is no greater folly, then for any man to deſire that a Prince ſhould reward him, vnleſſe hee know that by his works hee had deſerued the ſame. King Alexander did eate but one meale in the day, and therefore the firſt queſtion that he propounded vnto them was; That the man which did not eate but once in the day, at what houre it was beſt to eate, for the health of his perſon, and whether it ſhould be in the morning, noone dayes, or night? This queſtion was debated among the Philoſophers, whereof euery one to defend his opinion, alleadged many foundations. For no leſſe care haue the Sages in their mindes, to iſſue out of them diſputations victorious; then the valiant Captaines haue in aduenturing their perſons to vanquiſh their enemies. It was determined, as Ariſtotle maketh mention in his Probleames, that the man which eateth but once in the day, ſhould eate a little before What time it requiſite for a man to eate. night: for it auayleth greatly to the health of the body, that when the digeſtion beginneth in the ſtomacke, a man taketh his firſt ſleepe.
                     The ſecond queſtion that Alexander propounded was, What age the childe ſhould haue when hee ſhould be weyned from the dugge. And the occaſion of this queſtion was, for that he had begotten a young daughter of a Queene of the Amazous, the which at that time did ſucke: and for to know whether it were time or not to weyne her, there was great diſpurations: for the childe was now great to ſucke, and weake to weyne.
                     I haue declared this Hiſtory for no other purpoſe, but to ſhew how in Babylon this queſtion was diſputed before King Alexander; that is to ſay, how many yeeres the childe ought to haue before it were weyned from the teate: for at that time they are ſo ignorant, that they cannot demand that that is good, nor complaine of that that is naught. In that caſe a man ought to know, as the times are variable, and the regions and prouince diuers: ſo likewiſe haue they ſundry wayes of bringing vp and nouriſhing their children: for there is as much difference betweene the Countreys of one, from the Countries of others, in dying, and burying the dead bodies, as there hath beene varieties in the world, by way of nouriſhing &amp; bringing vp of children.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXIII. Of ſundry kindes of Sorceries, Charmes and Witchcrafts, which they in olde time vſed in giuing their children ſucke, the which Chriſtians ought to eſchew.
                     
                     
                        IT is not much from our purpoſe if I declare here ſome old examples of thoſe which are paſt. Strabo in his booke De 
                        Strabo de ſitu Orbis. 
                        ſitu Orbis, ſaith, that after the Aſsirians (which were the firſt that raigned in the world) the Siconians had ſignorie (which long time after were called Arcades) which were great and famous wraſtlers, and Schoolemaſters at the Fence, from

whom came the firſt and beſt Maſters of Fence, the which the Romanes kept alwaies for their Playes: for as Trogus Pompeius ſayth, the Romanes found it by experience, that there were no better men in waightie affayres, then thoſe of Spaine: nor no people apter to playes and paſtimes, then thoſe of Arcadia. As thoſe Siconians were ancient, ſo they were maruellouſly addicted to follies, and ſuperſtitious in their vſages and cuſtomes; for among other, they honoured for their God the Moone: and during the time that ſhee was ſeene, they gaue their children ſucke, imagining that the Moone ſhined vpon the breſts of the mother, it would doe much good vnto the childe. The Authous hereof is Sinna Catullus, in the booke De edicandis pueris: and as the ſame Hiſtorian ſayth, the Aegyptians were great enemies to the Siconians, ſo that all that which the one did allow, the others did repoue, as it appeareth: for, as much as the Siconians loued Oliues and Akorns, they were cloathed with linnen, and worſhipped the Moone for their God. The Aegyptians for the contrary had no Oliues, neyther nouriſhed they any Okes, they did weare no linnen, they worſhipped the Sunne for their God: and aboue all, as the Siconians did giue their children ſucke whiles the Moone did ſhine; ſo the Aegyptians gaue their children ſucke whiles the Sunne did ſhine. Among other follies of the Caldeans this was one, that they honoured the Fier for their God, ſo that hee that was not marryed could not light Fier in his houſe: becauſe, they ſayd, the cuſtodie of Gods ſhould be committed to none but to married and ancient men.
                     They had in Mariages ſuch order, that the day when any children did What order the Auncients vſed concerning marriage. marry, the Prieſts came into his houſe to light new Fire; the which neuer ought to bee put out vntill the houre of his death: and if perchance, during the life of the husband and of the wife, they ſhould finde the fire dead and put out, the marriage betweene them was dead and vndone, yea, though they had beene fortie yeeres together before in ſuch ſort and of this occaſion came the prouerbe which of many is read, and of few vnderſtood; that is to ſay, Pronoke me not ſo much, that I throwe water into the fire.
                     
                     The Caldeans vſed ſuch wordes when they would diuorce and ſeparate the marriage: for if the woman The cuſtome of the Chaldeans. were ill contented with her husband, in caſting a little water on the fire, immedately ſhe might marry with an others and if the husband in like manner, did put out the fire, hee might with another woman contract marriage.
                     I haue not beene marryed as yet: but I ſuppoſe there are many Chriſtians which wiſh to haue at this preſent the libertie of the Caldes: for I am well aſſured, there are many men which would caſt water on the fire, to eſcape from their wiues: alſo I ſweare, that there would be a number of women, which would not onely put out their fire, but alſo the aſhes, imbers, and coales to make themſelues free, and to bee diſpatched of their husbands, and in eſpecially from thoſe which are iealous.
                     Therefore returning to our matter. The Caldeans made before the fire all notable things in their lawe, as before their God: for they did eate before the fire, they ſlept before the fire, they did contract before the fire, and the mothers did neuer giue the children ſucke, but before the fire: for the milke (as they imagined) did profite the childe when it ſucked before the fire, which was their God.

                         many gods there were among the people▪ for euery one had one particular God to himſelfe: ſo that the god of the one, was not the god of the other. And this was to bee vnderſtood in the weeke dayes: for in the holy and feſtiuall dayes they had no other gods, the which altogether they did honour.
                     The manner that they had in chooſing gods when a woman was with child was this: Shee went to the Sacrificer of the Idoll, and tolde him that ſhee was great with childe, and beſought him to giue her a God for her child. And the ſacrificer gaue her a little idoll of ſtone, gold, ſiluer, or of wood, the which the mother hanged at the necke of the child, And as often as the childe did ſucke the dugge, ſo oft the mother putteth the Idoll on his face: for otherwiſe ſhee had not giuen him a droppe of milke to ſucke, vnleſſe firſt ſhee had conſecrated to the god the milke of her breſt. That which I haue ſpoken is little in reſpect of that I will ſpeake, which is, that if perchance the child dyed before the time, or that any young man by ſome perilous miſhap dyed before hee was ſomewhat ages: the Fathers and kinſmen of the dead did aſſemble, and came to the Idoll of him, and eyther ſtoned it, 
                           ••
                        ng it, drew it, burnt it, or elſe they caſt it into the deepe well, ſaying, that ſith the gods did kill man without reaſon, that they might lawfully kill them by iuſtice.
                     The ſame Bocchas in the ſecond booke De Natura Deorum ſayth, that the Allobroges had a cuſtome, that thoſe which were Prieſts of the gods, ſhould from the wombe of their mothers bee choſen vnto that dignitie: And as ſoone as the childe was born, before he taſted the milke of the breſt they earned it into a Prieſtes houſe: for they had a cuſtome that the man, which had taſted the thinges of the world, merited not to ſerue the Gods in the Temples.
                     One of the lawes that they ſayde Prieſts had, was that not onely they could not by violence ſhedde any bloud, nor yet ſee it, neyther touch it: ſo that immediately as the Prieſt ſhould by chance touch mansbloud, euen ſo ſoone he loſt his Prieſthood. This law afterwards was ſo narrowly looked vnto, that the Prieſts of the Allobroges did not onely not ſhedde drinke, nor touch mans bloud when they were now men: but alſo when they were little infants (thoſe that ſhould bee Prieſts) they gaue them no milke of the breſt at all. And this was their reaſon.
                     That to ſucke milke was no other but to drinke white bloud, for white milke is but ſodden bloud, and redde bloud is but raw milke.
                     
                        Pulio in the booke de educandis pueris ſayeth, That the Auncients had a certaine kinde of reedes, that breaking it in ſunder, there iſſued white milke, wherewith they accuſtomed to nouriſh their children: but let it bee as it is, that this law prohibite children their milke, which hereafter ſhould bee made Prieſtes of the

temples: mee thinketh it a tricke rather of ſuperſtitious ſorcerers then of religious Prieſts: For there is neyther diuine nor humane Law that will forbid, or prohibite any ſuch thing, without the which mans life cannot endure. Theſe were the maners and cuſtomes that the Ancients had in the nourture of their children.
                     And indeede I maruell not at that they did, for the Gentiles eſteemed this curſed Idol as a great God: as wee Chriſtians doe the true and liuing God. I was willing to declare all theſe antiquities, to the end that Princeſſes and great Ladies ſhoulde haue pleaſure in reading them, and knowing them: but not to that end, they ſhould imitate and follow them in any kind of thing: For according to the faith of our Chriſtian Religion, as ſure as wee be of the offences that thoſe did vnto God, through following thoſe ſuperſtitions: ſo ſure wee are of the good ſeruices, which wee doe vnto God in forſaking them.
                     How long time the mothers ought to giue their children ſucke, and what age they ought to weine them, not for that which I haue read, nor How long women ought to giue their children ſucke. for that which I haue demaunded in this caſe, I am able to anſwere: but foraſmuch as Ariſtotle ſayeth in the booke aboue named, that the child at the moſt ought to ſucke but two yeares, &amp; at the leaſt one yeare and a halfe: for if hee ſucke leſſe, he is in danger to be ſicke, and if hee ſucke more, he ſhall be alwayes tender. I will not omit that which Sextus Cheronenſis ſayeth, in the fourth booke of his common-wealth.
                     And hereof Bocohas alſo maketh mention in the third booke De natura Deorum, that when Alexander the Great paſſed into India, amongſt other renowmed Philoſophers, there was one with him called Arethus, who (as by chance he was in Niſſa, an ancient City of India) there came a mā of the Countrey to ſhew him ſuch antiquities as were there.
                     
                        Arethus the Philoſopher beheld them as a ſage and wiſe man: for the ſimple man onely beholdeth the doings, and how they ſeeme: but the ſage man enquireth and demandeth of the cauſes, and from whence they came.
                     Among other things he ſhewed this good Philoſopher a great houſe, being in the end of the City, &amp; therin were many women, whereof euery one of them had a chamber, and in euery chamber there was two beds, and adioyning to the one, herbs were ſowen in maner of nettles, and adioining to the other, there was kind of twigges, as of Roſemary, and in the midſt of the houſe, there were many graues of ſmall children.
                     The Phyloſopher Arethus asked Queſtions demanded by the Philoſopher Arethus. why that houſe was ſo great, and the Indian anſwered.
                     
                        This houſe is to nouriſh the Children which are Orphanes, when they bee of their Parents and friendes abandoned: For it is a cuſtome in this City, that immediately when the Father of one chelde dyeth, the City then taketh him for her ſonne. And from that time forward he is called the child of the City, which nouriſheth him, and not the childe of the Father which begot him.
                     
                     
                        Arethus the Philoſopher ſecondarily asked him, why there were ſo many women in that houſe, without any man among them? whereunto the Indian anſwered: In this Country there is a cuſtome, that the women are ſeuered from their husbands, all the time they giue their children ſucke. For the will of our God is, that the woman be not in company with her husband after, ſhee is with child, and this not onely vntil ſuch time as ſhee is deliuered: but alſo
                        
                        vntill ſuch time as the childe be wayned from the breſt.
                     
                     The Philoſopher Arethus thirdly demaunded him, why euery one had her chamber ſeuerally? The Indian anſwered. Thou knoweſt that now naturally raigneth ſo much malice in the woman, that ſhee alwayes enuyeth the felicity of another, And if they were altogether, they would haue amongſt them ſuch quarrels &amp; debates, that they would corrupt the milke which they ſhould giue to the child.
                     
                     Fourthly, the Philoſopher Arethus asked; why in euery chamber there was a great bed, and a little pallet, ſince there was but one woman, and one child? whereunto the Indian anſwered. In this India they doe not conſent that the Nurſes ſhould ſleepe together in one bed with the young childe, whom they nouriſh: for when the women are heauy a ſleepe, not taking heede to the childe, they many times ouerlay the poore infant, and ſo ſmother it aliue.
                     
                     Fiftly, the Philoſopher asked, why ioining to the beds, there was nettles which are without fauour in eating, and dangerous in touching. The Indian anſwered. I let thee know, that in this India (againſt al nature) the childrē weepe not whiles they are young, and therefore they haue growing by the beddes nettles to make them weepe: for our Philoſophors tell vs, that if dayly the childe doth weepe two houres, it profiteth him not onely for the health of his body, but alſo for to prolong his life.
                     
                     Furthermore the Philoſopher for the ſixt asked, why there were ſo many twigges like Roſemary by the bed ſide: whereunto the Indian aunſwered. Know thou that in India, there is an olde plague, that wee cannot defende our ſelues from theſe witches, the which by their ſorceries, and with the onely lookes of their eies deſtroy many children: and they ſay, that all the children which ſhall bee perfumed with thoſe hearbes, can take no hurte through the lookes of thoſe witches.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXIIII. Of a letter which Marcus Aurelius ſent to his friend Dedalus, in the ende whereof he enuaieth againſt thoſe women which cure children by ſorceries charmes and enchantments.
                     
                     
                        PRinceſſes and great Ladyes ought to take heed that their nurſes be not Witches, and that they doe not ſuffer the babes (whiles they are yet young) to take any charmes or ſorceries: for the medicine putteth the life of the creature in perill, and thoſe ſorceries doe not onelie harme to the body of the child, but alſo to the ſoule of her ſelfe which vſeth it. To prayſe more them that are paſt, and to confound more the preſent. I will that thoſe which ſhall reade this, doe reade a letter of Marcus Aurelius, which he ſent to a friend of his, in the end whereof it appeareth how great enemies the Auncients were to Witches, Charmers, &amp; to all kind of Sorcerers: for truely I know not which was greater, eyther the temperance that they had in nouriſhing their children being Gentiles or the fooliſh hardineſſe which wee haue being Chriſtians. Here followeth therefore the Letter, in the ende of the which hee ſpeaketh againſt Witches and euill women.
                     
                        
                           
                           The letter of the Emperour Marcus Aurelius.
                           
                              MArcus Aurelius the Romane Emperour, fellow with his brother Annius Verus, in the ſame Empire, wiſheth to thee Dedalus his ſpeciall friend, health to thy perſon, and good fortune againſt all euill, Since the day that thou diddeſt take ſhipping at the Hauen of Oſtia, I read no letter of thine, neyther haue I ſeen as yet any man of thy houſe: yea, and moreouer, they could not tell mee, whether thou wert aliue or dead. Wherefore thy friends did imagine that ſome miſhap had befallen thee, and thy ſhip, or elſe for the miſliking of the Country, thou ſhouldeſt returne againe, becauſe that men, which doe ſayle, as thou, goe alwayes in dangar to be drowned by ſome tempeſt; and if they doe eſcape they deſpayre in that ſtrange Countrey by Tolitarineſſe: but when I ſaw Fronton thy ſeruant, I was very ioyfull and much more when I vnderſtood thou wert aliue after thy great trauell.
                           Truely I receiued great pleaſure of that thou writeſt in thy letter, that thou art contented with the Countrey: for that to mee it is a ſtrange thing, that a man beeing nouriſhed in the delitiouſneſſe of Rome, ſhould finde himſelfe contented in in an other ſtrange Realme and nation,
                           When Rome was Rome, and Italy was named great Greece, thither came of all ſorts of people, and Nations to learne vertues and Nobleneſſe, When Rome flouriſhed: and others for to giue themſelues to vices and pleaſures. Becauſe, if Titus Liuins deceyue mee not, Rome ſpent all her treaſures in Aſia, and Aſia employed all her vices and delicatenes in Rome.
                           Thou writeſt to mee in thy letter of ſo many thinges, and Fronton thy ſeruant hath tolde mee ſo many newes of that land, that by the immortall Gods I ſweare vnto thee, I cannot tell what for to write vnto thee, nor what to aunſwere thy ſeruant: For the more the ſtraunge newes doe pleaſe the eares in hearing them, ſo much the more doe they ſeeme to bee vncredible.
                           The noble and ſtout perſonages, though they would bee eſteemed and iudged true in their ſaying, hauing ſeene many wonders with their eyes: yet when they come to count them, then they ought to bee very moderate in their tongues.
                           For it is a ſhame to the honeſt How circumſpect a man ought to bee to ſpeake the truth. man to declare a thing, wherein may bee any doubt, whether it bee true or not.
                           I will briefly anſwere al the things of thy Letter, and the anſwere ſhall bee, not according to thy deſire, but according to that I perceyue of thee, and the World:
                           And before I beginne, I beſeech thee, if my penne ſhall erre in writing, that thy heart pardon mee. For thy few yeares as yet doe not let thee know the World: and my white hayres and hoarie beard doth giue mee authority to aduertiſe thee of that which is to come, and to condemne thee of that which is paſt.
                           Thou ſayeſt that in the Sea, thou haſt paſt many perils and dangers, and that for to lighten the ſhippe, thou diddeſt caſt much of thy goods into the ſea.
                           In this caſe me thinketh thou oughteſt greatly to thanke the tempeſtuous waues, which hauing power to drowne thee, contented themſelues with thy Marchandize:

For they which ſayle vpon the foming Seas, ought not to regarde ſo much the goods they looſe, as the life which they ſaue.
                           Thou ſayeſt that on the Seas thou werte greatly accompanyed with paſſengers, and that thou haſt tarryed longer in thy voiage then thou thoghteſt, or diddeſt deſire.
                           This I ſay vnto thee my friend Dedalus, that though the dayes were manie thou diddeſt ſtay, yet notwithſtanding the griefes were more which thou receyuedſt. For it is vnpoſſible that thoſe men which ſayle much, ſhould not be troubled with the Marriners, and alſo in feare of tempeſts.
                           To that I aunſwere thee, the more thou wert loaden with companyons, the leſſe thy money weighed: for it is a general rule, that where the iourney is long, and the companie great, there the purſe of neceſſitie, muſt needes wexe thinne.
                           Thou ſayeſt that through the moyſture of the ſea, as ſoone as thou wert landed, thou diddeſt feele thy ſelfe taken with the goute.
                           To this I anſwere thee, that thou haſt the gout in thy feet, or elſe in thy What property belongeth to the goute. hands and if thou haſt it in thy feete, it ſhall be an occaſion that thou ſhalt keepe thy houſe, and if thou haſt it in thy hands, it ſhall bee an occaſion that thou ſhalt play no more at Tables (as thou werte wont to doe) and alſo thou ſhalt not waſte (as thou haſt done) thy owne money. And if thou haſt not changed thy cōdition which thou haddeſt, I am aſſured, that onely for to encreaſe thy goods, thou wilt thinke thy goute welcome.
                           Thou ſayeſt in that Countrey, thou haſt found many ſoueraigne &amp; expert Phyſitians for to remedy thy diſeaſes.
                           To that I anſwere, as Plato ſayeth that in the Countrey where there is many Phyſitians, there are many vices, and many vicious: for man by exceſſiue delicatenes commeth to ſickneſſe, and by that meane trauell hee is healed.
                           As long as our auncient Fathers were without Phyſitians in Rome, which was foure hundred yeares, ſo long and no more they ſhewed them ſelues ſober in eating and drinking: For euen as by temperance health proceedeth, ſo of Phyſicke proceedeth gluttonie.
                           Thou ſayeſt that the Country is verie fertile, and that amongſt other things there is much wood which we lacke here in Rome. To this I anſwer that if thou haſt much wood, thou haſt little bread: for it is an ancient Prouerbe, that where the fires are great, the barnes are few. And if thou ſayſt thou art content with the wood of that Country, I let thee know that I am not diſcontented with the bread of Italy: for in the ende a man ſhall ſooner finde wood to heate the euen then corne to carrie to the 
                                 ••
                              ill. Truly it is a good thing to haue woode for the winter: but it is better to haue corne for the Winter and Summer: for they call it no hunger, when wood lacked for the aged; but when bread wanteth for the young.
                           Thou ſayeſt in that Country there are many waters, and that the water is verie cleare and cold: and further that the aboundance thereof is ſuch, that euery houſe hath a fountain. To this I anſwere thee, that where the waters doe abound, there wanteth health continually.
                           And I doe not maruell thereat, for the moyſte and dankiſh places are alwayes moſt daungerous, vnhealthfull, and noyſome.
                           If this had beene in the time of the Golden World, when men know not what wine meant, but that all dranke Water, without compariſon that Countrey would haue

beene better then this. For the more the drunkennes of Wine is infamous, the more ſweeter and profitable is that of the water,
                           Thou knoweſt well, that a Fountaine which I haue in my gardaine (by the ſtreete Salaria,) was occaſion that at one time ſeuen of my Houſe dyed together. And if I had not made a conduit to voyde the ſtanding water, I thinke it had made an ende of mee, and of my Family. Wherfore I pray thee haue reſpect vnto the health of thy perſon, rather then to enioy the freſhnes of the water.
                           For my part I thinke him onely happie, who hath his bodie healthfull, and his heart at eaſe. Prayſe as much the land as they will, enioy thou the freſhnes thereof as much as thou canſt, and fill thee with the freſh and cold water, and write vnto thy friends how plentie it is: in the end I ſweare vnto thee, my deare Friende Dedalus, that more Money ſhall iſſue out of Rome, to buye wine in Candia, then buttes of the cold water of that countrey ſhall enter into Rome.
                           
                           Againe, thou ſayeſt that in that countrey there is ſuch aboundance of fruites: and that thou thinkeſt thou ſhalt neuer be ſatisfied therewith. To that I anſwer.
                           That thing which I beſt like, is a winter fruite: yet neyther ſeeing it, nor eating it, I can content my ſelfe: For the country where Fruits abound in winter, is neuer without feuers and ſickneſſes in Summer.
                           
                              Octauian Auguſtus that Noble Emperour of famous memorie, ſeeing that Rome in Summer, was very much ſubiect to diſeaſes: gaue commaundement What inconueniēce commeth by eating too much fruit. vpon grieuous penalties, that the fruites of Salon ſhould not enter into Rome to be ſolde,
                           And this is a maruellous thing, that the Citie of Rome by this meanes did not only finde her ſelfe ſound and whole: but alſo the Phyſitians went out of Rome, of their owne wills and affections. For it is a great token that the people is healthfull, when the Phiſitians are poore.
                           Thou ſayeſt that in that Countrey there are many Iugglers and Players: To this I aunſwer thee.
                           That theyr paſtimes ſhall not bee vnto thee ſuch, and ſo pleaſaunt, as the griefs and diſpleaſures thou ſhalt haue, when they cunningly and craftily What hurt commeth by Iugglers and players. ſhall picke thy purſe. For moſt commonly Iugglers and plaiers make Playes and ſportes in jeaſt, but they will be payde in good earneſt.
                           Furthermore thou ſayeſt: in that Countrey there is great aboundance of Vines, and that the wine is ſauourie to ſmell, and very ſweete and pleaſaunt, for theyr taſte: whereunto I anſwer.
                           That there ſhall not bee ſo manie vynes in the Fieldes, as Drunkardes amongſt the people: For, as thou knoweſt, the day that I marryed Torpina, my Niece, my vnckle Getellius had but onely one vine tree, and yet with the Wine that came thereof, he made himſelfe, his houſehold, and all thoſe that were at the marriage drunke.
                           That which I will ſay is not without weeping, (in the olde time) Mars was the God moſte honoured and eſteemed, being the God of Battells: but now Bacchus, which is God of wine, is the moſt honoured, ſerued, and exalted.
                           For the time that a Romane was wont to employ in the Martial Camp to handle Warlike weapons: now they conſume in playing and drinking in the rauernes.
                           
                              Titus Liuius in his Annales, ſayeth, that thoſe of Gallia Tranſalpina, vnderſtanding, Titus Liuius. how that the Italians had planted many vines, came to conquer the Countety. So that if they

had neuer planted vines in Italie, the French-men had neuer deſtrolyed the Countrey.
                           The auncient Romaines (which were prouided againſt all inconueniences) conſidering that Wine was the cauſe of their deſtruction, commaunded to deſtroy all the Vynes of the Empyre, through the which pollicie, they were The pollicy of the auncient Romaines. deliuered from all the French-men: for when the Warres were ended, there remained not one French-man in all Italie, when they knewe that there were no more Vynes therein. Thou ſayeſt that in that Countrey there are many Gentlemen and honorable Senators, with whom thou talkeſt, and paſſeſt away the time.
                           To this I anſwere, that if it be true, there are many idle men, and alſo few true talkers: For thoſe men which haue ſpent their youth in the warres, when they are aged, doe not employe their time but in hearing newes, and telling lyes.
                           Thou ſayedſt, that there are very faire women in that countrey, of geſture ſeemely, and of their perſons comely;
                           To this I anſwere. That if there be many which be faire, there are as manie which are diſhoneſt. For if the woman with her beautie, hath not wiſdome and honeſtie in her ſelfe, ſhe putteth her ſelfe in perill, and her husband in much care,
                           Thou ſayeſt that in that Countrey there are women which are Soothſayers, Sorcerers, and Enchantours: the which do boaſt and vaunt themſelues that they will heale Infants, and that they can weyne them better then others can doe.
                           To this I anſwere: that I would iudge it much better, that Children ſhould neuer be healed by the hands of ſuch euill women. For the profite that they doe by their experience openly, is nothing in reſpect of the danger wherin they put the creatures, by their Sorceries ſecretly.
                           
                              Torquatus Laertius my Vnckle, had a Daughter of a maruellous beautie, the which (becauſe he had none other Childe,) was heyre of all his Patrimonie.
                           The caſe therefore was ſuch: that as the Daughter one day cryed and wept a little too much, the Nurſe which gaue her ſucke, to appeaſe and ſtill her, thinking to giue her ſorceries to caſt her in a ſleepe, gaue her poyſon, which deſtroyed her; So that when the teares of the innocent babe ceaſed, then the cryes of the woefull mother beganne.
                           
                              Calligula which was the ſonne of the good Germanicus the great (though amongſt the Caeſars hee was the fourth, and amongſt the Tyrants, the firſt) when in Rome they vſed to giue little ſcrowles written, which they ſaide to bee of ſuch vertue, that they could heale all manner of Agues, and diſeaſes of young children, hee gaue commaundement by the conſent of the ſacred Senate, that whoſoeuer eyther man or woman, which ſhould make them, ſhould immediately by iuſtice be put to death: and that he which would buye them, and carrie them about to ſell, or giue them through the citie of Rome, ſhould be whipt and baſhed for euer,
                           Thy ſeruant Fronton hath told me newes, that thou haſt a Sonne borne, whereof I am very glad: and moreouer, he ſaide that a woman of Sannia did nouriſhit, and gaue it ſucke: the which (as by an euill chaunce) hath a ſpice of Sorcerie.
                           Now by the immortall Gods I do conjure thee, and for the loue which I beare thee, againe I moſt earneſtly deſire thee, that immediatly thou put her away out of thy houſe, and ſuffer not, that ſo wicked a woman ſhould eate Bread there one day: For euery

creature which is nouriſhed by ſorceries and Charmes, ſhal eyther haue his life ſhort, or elſe Fortune ſhall be contrarie vnto him.
                           I let thee know my friend Dedalus, that I haue not maruelled a little at many Romains, the which doe permit, and alſo procure that their Children ſhould bee healed and cured with charmes and ſorceries? For my part I take it to bee a thing certaine, that the men which by the will of God fall ſicke, ſhall neuer heale for any diligence that man can do. And whereas children are ſicke by euill humors, or that they are not very healthful, becauſe the gods wil take life from them: in this caſe if their diſeaſe proceed of any euill humour, let them aske Phyſitions for naturall medicines. And if their diſeaſes come becauſe the Gods God the onely Phyſitian. are prouoked: then let their Fathers appeaſe the Gods with ſacrifices. For in the end it is vnpoſſible that the diſeaſes of the heart ſhould be healed by the meanes of any Medicines of the bodie.
                           Doe not maruell (my Friend Dedalus) if I haue ſpoken more in this article then in others, that is to ſay, to perſwade thee ſo much to keepe thy children from witches: For otherwiſe the curſed Women will doe them more harme, then the good milke ſhal profite them.
                           I haue beene moued and prouoked to write thus much vnto thee, for the great loue which I do beare thee: and alſo calling to minde that which thou (when we were in the ſacred Senate) oft times toldeſt me: which was, that thou diddeſt deſire a ſonne. And ſince now thou haſt thy petition, I would not thou ſhouldſt prouoke the Gods wrath by ſorceries: For in the faith of a good man I doe ſweare vnto thee, that when the Fathers are in fauour with the Gods, there needeth no ſorceries vnto the Children.
                           I had manie other things to write vnto thee: Some of the which I will cōmunicate with thy ſeruant Fronton, rather then to ſend them by letters. And maruel not at this, for letters are ſo perillous, that if a man be wiſe, hee wil write no more in a cloſe letter, thē he would declare openly in Rome: Pardon me my friend Dedalus, though indeede I write not vnto thee as thy appetite would, nor yet as my will deſireth. For thou haſt need to know many things, and I haue not leaue by letter to put thee in truſt therewith.
                           I cannot tell what I ſhould write vnto thee of me, but that alwayes the Goute doth take me, and the worſt of all is, that the more I growe in yeares, the more my health diminiſheth: For it is an old courſe of mans frailtie, that where wee thinke to goe moſt ſureſt, there haue we moſt lets. The mutabilitie of mans life.
                           
                           The Popinjay which thou didſt ſend me, as ſoone as I receyued it, my wife did ſeaze it, and truely it is a maruellous pleaſure to heare what thinges it doth ſpeak: but in the end the women are of ſuch power, that when they wil, they impoſe ſilence to the liuing, and cauſe that in the graues the dead men ſpeake.
                           According to that I doe loue thee, and according to that I owe thee, and as I haue vſed, that which I doe ſende thee is very little. I ſay it, becauſe that preſently I do ſend thee but two horſes of Barbarie, twelue ſwords of Alexandrie, and to Fronton thy ſeruant for a new yeares gift, for his good newes, I haue giuen him an Office, which is worth to him 20. thouſand Sexterces of Rent in Cecyl.
                           
                           
                              Fauſtine did bid mee I ſhould ſend thy wife Peruſa, a cofer full of odoriferous odours of Paleſtine, and another cofer full of her owne Apparrel: the which (as I thinke) thou wilt not a little eſteeme. For naturally Women are of theyr owne Goods niggardes:

but in waſting &amp; ſpending of others very prodigall. The Almighty gods bee with thee, and preſerue thee from euill fortune. The which I humbly beſeech to graunt, that vnto thee and mee, and vnto my wife Fauſtine, and to thy wife Pertuſa, that we all meete merily together in Rome: for the heart neuer receyueth ſuch ioy, as when hee ſeeth himſelfe with his deſired friend. Marcus of Mount Celio writeth to thee with his own hand.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXV. How excellent a thing it is for a Gentleman to haue an eloquent tongue,
                     
                     
                        ONe of the chiefeſt things that the Creatour gaue to man, was to know, and be able to ſpeake: What difference there is betweene man and beaſt. for otherwiſe (the ſoule reſerued) the brute beaſts are of more value, then dumbe men. Ariſtotle in his Aeſconomices without compariſon prayſeth more the Pythagoricall ſort, then the Stoicall: ſaying, that the one is more conforme to reaſon, then the other is. Pythagoras commaunded, that al men which were dumbe, and without ſpeech, ſhould immediately, and without contradiction be baniſhed, and expulſed from the people. The cauſe why this Phyloſopher had commanded ſuch things was, for ſo much as he ſaide, that the tongue is moued by the motions of the ſoule, and that he which had no tong, had no ſoule: And hee which hath no ſoule is but a brute beaſt, and he that is a beaſt, deſerueth to ſerue in the fieldes among brute beaſts.
                     It is a good thing not to bee dumbe as bruite beaſts are, and it is a greater thing to ſpeake as the reaſonable men doe: but it is much more worthy to ſpeake wel, as the eloquent Philoſophers doe. For otherwiſe if hee which ſpeaketh, doth not weigh the ſentences more then the wordes, oft times the Popingayes ſhall content thē more which are in the cage, then the men which doe reade in Schooles.
                     
                        Ioſephus in the booke De Bello Iudaico ſayeth, That King Herod, not onely with his perſon and goods, but Ioſeph de bello Iudaic. alſo with all his friends and parents followed, and gaue ayde to Marcus Anthonius, and to his louer Cleopatra, howbeit in the end Octauian had the victory: For the man which for the loue of a woman doth enterpriſe conqueſts, it is impoſſible that eyther he loſe not his life, or elſe that hee liue not in infamy,
                     
                        Herod ſeeing that Marcus Antonius was dead, determined to go towards the Emperour Octauian, at whoſe feet he layd his crowne, and made a notable Oration, wherein hee ſpake ſo pleaſant words, and ſo high ſentences, that the Emperour Octauian did not onely pardon him, for that hee was ſo cruell an enemie, but alſo hee confirmed him again vnto his realm: and tooke him for his deare and ſpeciall friend.
                     For among the good men, and noble hearts, many euill workes are amended by a few good works.
                     If Blundus, in the booke intituled Roma triumphante, do not deceiue me Pirrus that great King of the Epirotes was ſtoute and hardy, valiant in armes, liberall in benefices, patient in aduerſities, and aboue al renowned to be very ſweet in words, and ſage in his anſweres.
                     They ſayde that this Pirrus was ſo eloquent, that the man with whome once hee had ſpoken, remained ſo

much his, that from that time forward in his abſence, hee tooke his part, and declared his life and ſtate in preſence.
                     The aboue named Blundus ſayed and Titus Liuius declareth the ſame, That as the Romaines were of all things prouided (ſeeing that King Pyrrus was ſo eloquent) they prouided in the Senate, that no Romane Ambaſſadour ſhould ſpeake vnto him, but by a third perſon: for otherwiſe he would haue perſwaded them through his ſweet words, that they ſhould haue returned againe to Rome as his procurers and ſoliciters: Albeit Marcus Tullius Cicero was Senatour in the Senate, Conſull in the Empire, rich amongſt the rich, and hardy amongſt men of warre: yet What cauſed Cicero to bee famous. truely none of theſe qualities cauſed him eternall memorie, but onely his excellent eloquence.
                     This Tullius was ſo eſteemed in Rome for the eloquence of his tongue onely, that oft times they heard him talke in the Senate three houres together, without any man ſpeaking one word. And let not this bee little eſteemed, nor lightly paſſed ouer: for worldly malice is of ſuch condition, that ſome man may eaſily ſpeake foure houres, then another man ſhal haue patience to heare him one minute. Antonius Sobellicus declareth that in the time of Amilcares the Affrican, a Philoſopher named Afronio, flouriſhed in great Carthage, who being of the yeares of 81, dyed in the firſt yeere of the wars of Punica: they demaunded this Philoſopher, what it was that he knew? he anſwered, He knew nothing but to ſpeake well. They demaunded him againe what hee learned? He anſwered, Hee did learne nothing but to ſpeake well. Another time they demaunded him what hee taught? Hee anſwered, He taught nothing but to ſpeake well. Me thinketh that this good Philoſopher in foureſcore yeares and one ſaid, that he learned nothing but to ſpeake well, hee knew nothing but to ſpeake well, and that he taught nothing but to ſpeake well. And truely hee had reaſon, for the thing which moſt adorneth mans life, is the ſweet pleaſant tongue to ſpeake well what is it to ſee two men in one counſell, the one talking to the other, the one of them hath an euill grace in propounding, and the other excellent in ſpeaking.
                     Of ſuch there are ſome, that in hearing them talke three houres, wee would neyther be troubled nor wearied, and of the contrary part, there are others ſo tedious, and rude in their ſpeech, that as ſoone as men perceiue they beginne to ſpeake they auoyde the place.
                     And therefore in mine opinion, there is no greater trouble then to hearken one quarter of an houre a rude man to ſpeake, and to be contrary, there is no greater pleaſure then to heare a diſcreete man though it were a whole weeke.
                     The diuine Plato in the Booke of Lawes ſayde, that there is nothing whereby a man is known more then by the words he ſpeaketh: for of the The opiniō of Plato wordes which we heare him ſpeake, we iudge his intention eyther to bee good or euil. Laertius in the life of the Phyloſopher ſaieth, that a young childe borne at Athens, was brought vnto Socrates the great phyloſopher, being in Athens, to the ende he ſhould receyue him into his companie, and teach him in his Schoole. The yong childe was ſtrange and ſhamefaſt, and durſte not ſpeake before his Maiſter, wherefore the Phyloſopher Socrates ſayd vnto him, Speake friend, if thou wilt that I know thee This ſentence of Socrates was very profound, I pray him that ſhall reade this writing, to

pauſe a while thereat. For Socrates will not that a man be known by the geſture he hath, but by the good or euill wordes which he ſpeaketh.
                     Though eloquence and ſpeaking well, to euery man is a cauſe of augmenting their honour, and no diminiſher of their goods: yet without compariſon it ſhineth much more, &amp; is moſt neceſſary in the Pallaces of Princeſſes and great Lords; for men which haue common offices, ought of neceſſity hearken to his naturall Countrimen, and alſo to ſpeake with ſtrangers.
                     Speaking therefore moſt plainely, I ſay, that the Prince ought not to trauell onely to haue eloquence, for the honour of his perſon: but alſo it behoueth him for the Commonwealth.
                     For as the Prince is but one, and is ſerued of all: ſo it is vnpoſſible that hee haue ſo much as will ſatisfie and content them all. And therefore it is neceſſary that hee requite ſome with money, and that hee content others with good words: For the Noble heart loueth better a gentle worde, then a reward or gift, with the tong of a rude man.
                     
                        Plato, Liuius, Herodotus, Vulpicius, Eutropius, Diorus, Plinie, and many other innumerable ancient Hiſtoriographers, doe not ceaſe to prayſe the eloquence of Greeke princes, and Latines in their workes.
                     Oh how bleſſed were thoſe times, when there were ſage Princes, and diſcreete Lordes: truely, they haue reaſon to exalt them. For many haue obtayned, and wonne the royall crownes and ſcepters of the Empire, not ſo much for the great battels they haue conquered, nor for the high bloud and generation from whence they are diſcended, as for the wiſedome and eloquence which they had.
                     
                        Marcus Aurelius was naturall of Rome, borne in Mount Celio, hee was poore in patrimony, and of baſe lynage, little in fauour, left and forſakē of his parents; and beſides all this, onely for being vertuous in this life, profound in doctrine, and of ſo high eloquence, the Emperour Antonius (called Pius) gaue him his daughter Fauſtine for wife, who being reproued of many, becauſe he gaue his daughter to ſo poore a Philoſopher, anſwered. I had rather haue a poore Philoſopher then a rich foole.
                     
                        Pulio in his ſeuenth booke of the Romaine lawes ſayth, that in Rome there was a law very well kept, and obſerued of the Conſels by a cuſtom brought in, that the Dictators, Cenſor and Emperors of Rome, entred into the Senate once in the weeke at the leaſt, and in this place they ſhould giue and render account, in what ſtate the common wealth remayned. O would to God that at this preſent this Law were ſo kept and obſerued: for there is none who doth miniſter ſo good iuſtice, as he which thinketh to giue account of his doings.
                     They ſay that Caligula, the fourth Emperour of Rome, was not onelie deformed infamous, and cruell in his life, but alſo was an Idiot in eloquēce, and of an euill vtterance in his communication: ſo that hee among all the Romane Princes was conſtrained to haue others to ſpeake for him in the Senate.
                     This wicked man was ſo vnfortunate, that after his cruell and infamous death, they drew him throughout Rome, and ſet vpon his graue this Epitaph.
                     
                        Caligula lyeth here in endleſſe ſleepe,
                     
                     
                        That ſtretcht his raigne, vpon the Empires head,
                     
                     
                        Vnfitte for rule, that could ſuch folly heape,
                     
                     
                        
                        And fitte for death, where vertue ſo was dead.
                     
                     I Cannot tell why Princes do praiſe themſelues to be ſtrong and hardie, to bee well diſpoſed, to bee runners, to iuſt well, and doe not eſteeme to be eloquent, ſince it is true, that thoſe gifts doe profite them onely for their life, but the eloquence profiteth them not onely for to honour their life, but alſo to augment their renowne: For wee doe reade, that by that many Princes did pacifie great ſeditions in the common wealth, and beſides that they deſerued immortall memory. Suetonius Tranquillus in the firſt book of Caeſars ſayth, that the aduenturous Iulius Caeſar (being as yet but 16. yeares of age) when there dyed in The commendation of Iulius Caeſar. 
                        Rome an aunt of his called Cornelia, at her buriall hee made an Oration, in the which hee (beeing ſo young,) ſhewed maruellous great eloquence, which was ſo accepted that day in al people, that in the end, euery man iudged him to bee a valiant Romane Captaine.
                     And as Appianus declareth, they ſay that Silla ſpake theſe words. That which I perceyue of this young man Caius Caeſar is, that in the boldneſſe of his tongue, he declareth how valiant he ought to bee in his perſon. Let therefore Princes and great Lordes ſee, how much it may profite them to know to ſpeake well and eloquently, For wee ſee no other thing dayly but that a man of baſe lynage, by his eloquence commeth to be exalted: and the other which of linage is nobly borne for want of ſpeaking well, and being eloquent, is the firſt that diſcendeth moſt vileſt of all other.
                     The intention whereupon I wrote theſe things was for no other, but to admoniſh, perſwade, and pray all princes and great Lords, that whiles their children are young, they ſhould put them to wiſe and learned men, to the end they ſhould teach them: not onely how they ought to liue, but alſo how they ought to ſpeake: For to perſons of eſtate, it is a great infamy to doe, or to inuent to doe a thing, &amp; afterward not to know how to giue a reaſon thereof.
                     
                        Polidorus in the third booke of his Commentaries ſayth, that when the Lacedemonians were put to flight by the Athenians: In rota milina, it is called Milina, becauſe the battell was in the riuer of Miline, the Lacedemonians ſent a Philoſopher called Heuainus, to treate of peace with the Athenians, who made ſuch an eloquent Oration to the Senate of Athens, that he did nor onely obtaine the Peace which hee deſired for his Countrey, but for himſelfe alſo hee wan perpetuall renowne. At the Philoſophers returne the Athenians gaue him a letter which ſayd in this ſort.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXVI Of a Letter which the Athenians ſent to the Lacedemonians.
                     
                     
                        THe Senate, people, &amp; Sages of Athens wiſheth health to the perſons, and peace to the Common wealth, of you of the Senate, and people of the Lacedemonians. Wee take the immortall Gods to recorde, that in the laſt battell we had no leſſe diſpleaſure to ſee you ouercome, then on the contrary wee had pleaſure, to ſee vs remaine victorious: for in the end, the daungers and inconueniences of the cruell warres are ſo great,

that the euill and danger is certain to them that are vanquiſhed, and the profite is doubtfull to them that haue ouercommed.
                     We would gladly, that that which now yee will, yee would haue willed ſooner, and that which now yee require and demaund, that before yee had required and demanded,
                     But what ſhall we doe, ſince it was ordayned to your and our wofull deſtinies, that hee ſhould loſe the battell, and that wee of your loſſe can take no profite: For it is a rule vnfallible, that all that which the Gods haue ordayned, no worldly wight can auoyde, nor humane power reſiſt. Yee demaund that warre may leaue and ceaſe off, and that wee take truce for three monethes, and that duriyg this time, peace and concord may be concluded. To this wee make anſwere, That the Senate of Athens hath not accuſtomed to grant peace, afterward for to returne to warre: for amongſt vs Athenians wee haue an ancient Law, that freely wee doe accept the cruell warre, and liberally we doe graunt perpetuall peace.
                     In our Schooles and Vniuerſities we trauell to haue Sages in time of peace, for to help vs with their counſels in the time of warre. And they doe counſell vs that wee neuer take vpon vs truce vpon ſuſpect condition: And indeed they counſell vs well: for the fayned and diſſembled peace is much more perillous, then is the manifeſt warre.
                     The Philoſopher Heuxinus your Ambaſſadour hath ſpoken to vs ſo highly and eloquently in this Senate, that it ſeemed to vs very vniuſt, if wee ſhould deny him, and gaine-ſay that hee requireth vs.
                     For it is much more honeſty to grant him peace; which by ſweet and pleaſant words doth demaund it: then him, which by force and ſharpe ſword doth require it.
                     Let the caſe therefore be, that the Senate, people and Sages of Athens haue ordained, that warre doe ceaſe with the Lacedemonians, and that all diſcordes, contentions, diſſentions, and debates doe end, and that perpetual peace bee granted vnto them:
                     And this thing is done to the end all the world ſhould know, that Athens is of ſuch courage with the hardie, and ſo very a friend to the Sages: that ſhe knoweth how to puniſh the fooliſh Captaines, and ſuffereth to bee commanded and gouerned by ſage Phyloſophers. Yee know right well that all our warre hath not been, but onely for the poſſeſſion of Cities and limits of the riuer Milina,
                     
                     Wherefore by this letter wee declare vnto you, and by the immortall Gods wee ſweare, that wee doe renounce vnto you al our right on ſuch condition, that you do leaue vs Heuxinus your Ambaſſadour and Philoſopher.
                     The great Athens deſireth rather a Philoſopher for her Schooles, then a whole Prouince of your Realmes. And do not you other Lacedemonians thinke, that that which wee of Athens doe, is light or fooliſh, that is to ſay, that wee deſire rather one man to rule, then to haue a whole Prouince whereby wee may commaund many.
                     For this Philoſopher ſhall teach vs to liue well, and that land gaue vs occaſion to dye euill: and ſith wee now of your old enemies do become your true friendes, we will not onely giue you perpetuall peace, but alſo counſell for to keepe it. For the medicine which preſerueth health is of greater excellency, then is the purgation which healeth the diſeaſe.
                     Let the counſell therefore bee ſuch, that as yee will the young men doe exerciſe themſelues in weapons, that

ſo yee doe watch and ſee that your children in time doe learne good letters: For euen as the warre by the cruell ſword is followed: ſo likewiſe by pleaſant words peace is obtained. Thinke not yee, Lacedemonians, that without a cauſe we do perſwade you, that you put your children to learne, when as yet they are but young and tender, and that yee doe not ſuffer them to runne to vices? for on the one part, wiſe men ſhall want to counſell, and on the other, fooles ſhall abound to make debate. We Atbenians, in like manner, will not that yee Lacedemonians doe thinke, that wee bee friends to bablers. For our Father Socrates ordained, that the firſt leſſon which ſhould be giuen to the Scholler of the Vniuerſity, The ordinances of Socrates. ſhould be, that by no meanes hee ſhould ſpeake any word for the ſpace of two yeares: for it is vnpoſſible that any man ſhould be wiſe in ſpeaking, vnleſſe he haue patience to be ſilent. Wee thinke, if you thinke it good, that the Philoſopher Heuxinus ſhall remaine in our Senate, and thinke you if wee profite by his preſence, that yee may bee aſſuted that others ſhall not receyue any damage by the counſels hee ſhall giue vs: For in Athens it is an ancient Law, that the Senate cannot take vpon them wars; but by the Philoſophers firſt it muſt bee examined, whether it be iuſt or not.
                     We write none other thing, but that wee beſeech the immortall gods that they bee with you, and that it pleaſe them to continue vs in this perpetuall peace: for that onely is perpetuall, which by the Gods is confirmed.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXVII. That Nurſes which giue ſucke to the children of Princes ought to be diſcreete and ſage women.
                     
                     
                        THe Pilgrims which trauell through vnknowne Countries and ſtrange mountaines (wth great deſire to goe forward, and not to erre) doe not onely aske the way which they haue to goe, but alſo do importune thoſe whom they meete, to point them the way with their finger: For it is a grieuous thing to trauell doubtfully in feare and ſuſpition: By this compariſon I mean, that ſince I haue much perſwaded, that the Fathers do learne and teach their children to ſpeake well, it is but reaſon that they doe ſeeke them ſome good Maſters. For the counſell hath no authority, if hee which giueth it, ſeeketh not ſpeedily to execute the ſame.
                     It is much for a man to bee of a good nature, or elſe to bee of an euill How euerie man ought to guide &amp; gouerne himſelfe. inclination, to bee rude in vnderſtanding, or elſe to bee liuely in ſpirit: and this not onely for that a man ought to doe, but alſo for that hee ought to ſay: For it is no ſmall thing, but a great good benefite, when the man is of a good nature, of a good vnderſtanding, and of a cleare iudgement. This notwithſtanding, I ſay, that all the good and cleare iudgements are not alwayes eloquent, nor all the eloquenteſt of liuely ſpirites and vnderſtanding.
                     Wee ſee many men which of a ſmall matter can make much: and

for the contrarie wee ſee many men, which haue great knowledge, and yet no mean s to vtter it. So that nature hath giuen them high vnderſtanding, and through negligence of bringing vp it is hid.
                     Oftentimes I doe maruell that the ſoule of the Babe when it is borne, for the one part is of no leſſe excellencie, then the ſoule of the olde man when hee dyeth. And on the other ſide I muſe at the babe which hath the members ſo tender, (wherewith the ſoule doth worke his operations) that they little ſeeme to participate with reaſonable creatures.
                     For where the ſoule doth not ſhewe her ſelfe miſtreſſe, it wanteth little but that the man remaineth a beaſt.
                     It is a wonder to ſee the Children, that as yet being two yeares of Age, they lifte heir feete for to goe, they holde themſelues by the walls for falling, they wil open their eyes to know and they fourme a defuzed voyce to ſpeake: So that in that age, a creature is none otherwiſe then as a tree at the firſt ſpring. For the Tree two moneths Children compared to Trees. beeing paſt, beareth leaues immediatly: and the childe after ij. years beginneth to frame his words.
                     This thing is ſpoken, for that the Fathers which are wiſe, ſhould begin to teache their children at that Age: For about that time the Vynes beare grapes, and other trees their fruite: For the perils of this life are ſuch, that if it were poſſible, the Father before he ſee his Sonne borne, ought to admoniſh him how he ſhould liue.
                     In mine opinion, as they conueigh the water about to turne the Mill: So from the tender youth of the Infant, they ought to ſhewe and teach him to bee eloquent and affable. For truely the Childe learneth diſtinctly to pronounce his words, when he doth ſucke the milke of his Nurſe.
                     We cannot denie, but that the children beeing but two or three yeares olde, it is too ſoone to giue them maiſters or correcters, For at that Age a Nurſe to keepe them cleane is more neceſſarie, then a maiſter to correct their ſpeech.
                     On the one part the children are very tender for to learne to ſpeake well: and on the other part it is neceſſarie, that when they are very young and little, they ſhould be well taught and inſtructed.
                     I am of that opinion, that Princeſſes and great Ladyes ſhould take ſuch Nurſes to giue theyr Children ſucke, that they ſhould bee ſound, to giue How to chooſe Nurſes for children. them their milke, and ſage for to teach them to ſpeake. For in ſo young and tender Age they doe not ſuffer, but that ſhee which giueth them ſucke, doth teach them to ſpeake their firſt words.
                     As Sextus Cheroner ſis in the booke of the diuerſitie of the Languages, ſaith: That the Toſcanes were the firſt which called the natural tongue of the countrey, the Mother tongue, (which is to ſay, the tongue of our Mother) to the ende we ſhould take it of the Mother which bringeth vs forth: and of the Nurſe which giueth vs ſucke. And in this caſe we haue leſſe neede of the Mother then of the Nurſe. For the children before they know their Mothers, which brought them into the world, doe call the Nurſe mother, that gaue them ſucke.
                     
                        Plutarche in the ſecond booke of the Regiment of Princes, ſaith: that one of the greateſt thinges the Romaines had in their Commonweale was, that of all the Languages and manners which they ſpake; thoroughout the whole earth, they had Colledges and Scholes in Rome: ſo that were he neuer ſo barbarous that entered into Rome, immediately hee found that vnderſtood him.
                     The Romaines vſed that craft and

ſubtiltie, to the ende that when Rome ſent Embaſſadors into ſtrange Countreys, or that ſome ſtrange Countreys came to Rome, they would that the Ent

                        rpretours and brokers ſhould be of theyr owne Nation, and not of a ſtrange tongue or Countrey.
                     And truely the Romaines had reaſon: for the affaires of great importance, are oftentimes craftely compaſſed by a ſtraungetongue.
                     A man will maruell greatly to read, or heare this that I ſpeake: which is, that the Women which nouriſh the children of Princes be eloquent.
                     And truly he that at this doth maruell, hath ſeen little, and read leſſe. For I cannot tell which was greater, the glory that the Ancients, had to enjoy ſo excellent women: or the infamy of The glory of the Ancients to enioy vertuous women. them that are preſent, to ſuffer diſhoneſt Harlots. I will not denie, when I drew neere this matter, that my ſpirits were not in great perplexitie: Firſt to ſee in this my writing, of what women my Pen ſhould write, (that is to ſay) the diſſolute vices of Women which I haue ſ
                           ••
                        n, or elſe the proweſſes and vertues of women whereof I haue read. Finally, I am determined to intreate of our Graine, and Corne, and to leaue the rotten ſtrawe on the Earth, as without profite. For the tongue which is noble, ought to publiſh the goodnes of the good and honeſt women, to the ende that all know it: for the contrarie, the fraileneſſe of the wicked ought to bee diſſembled, and kept ſecret, to the ende that no man follow it.
                     Men which are ſage and noble, treating of Women, are bound to viſite them, to preſerue them, and to defend them: but in no wiſe they haue licence to ſlaunder them.
                     For the man which ſpeaketh of the frailenes of women, is like vnto him that taketh a ſworde to kill a flie.
                     Therefore touching the matter, Princeſſes and great Ladies ought not to ceaſe to teach their young children all that they can, ſonnes, or daughters. And they ought not to deceyue themſelues, ſaying, that foras much as their daughters are Women, they are vnable to learne ſciences: for it is not a generall rule, that all men children are of cleane vnderſtanding, nor that all the daughters are of rude ſpirite and wit: for if they and the others did learne together, I thinke there would bee as many wiſe women, as there are fooliſh men. Though the world in times paſt did enioy excellent women, there was neuer any Nation had ſuch as the Greekes had: For though the Romanes were glorious in weapons, the Greekes were of immortall memorie of letters.
                     I will not deny that in the common wealth of Rome, there hath not beene nouriſhed and taught many women of great ſcience: but that the difference of the one and the other was, that the Grecian women were learned in Philoſophy, and the Romane Greece euer famous for learned women. women in Rethoricke and Poetrie.
                     And hereof came that in Athens, they eſteemed to know how to teach well: and in Rome they vaunted how to ſpeake well.
                     
                        Euphronius in the third booke of the Romane geſtes ſayeth, that in the third yeare of the Conſulſhip of Lelius Sylla, by chance a Greeke Ambaſſador, and an Ambaſſadour of Rome, were at wordes in the Senate of the Rhodians, &amp; the Greeke Ambaſſadour ſayd to the Romane Ambaſſador; It is true, that amongſt you other Romanes, you are aduenturous in armes: but for all that, you are vnable in ſciences: For truely the women of Greece know more in letters, then the men of Rome in weapons.
                     
                     As ſoone as the Senate of Rome

vnderſtoode thoſe words, immediatly hereupon grew the cruell wars betweene Rome and Carthage about the poſſeſſion of Sicill.
                     
                     And no man ought hereat to maruell; for in the end we ſee more wars ariſe by iniurious words, then for to recouer the good that is loſt. The Romanes and the Grecians therefore being ready the one to defie the other, the Rhodians came in the middeſt, and kept them from ſuch debate, and in the end appointed them in this ſort.
                     That is to ſay, that as this iniurie ſhould by weapons haue been determined, they ordayned that by the diſputations of women it ſhould bee argued.
                     And truely the Romanes were counſelled well; for it was greater ſhame to the Greekes to bee ouercome with the tongues of women, then with the ſwords of men. The cauſe thereof was ſuch, that by appointment Diſputation betweene the women of Greece and Rome. aſſembled at Rhodes ten Roman women, and ten Greeke women: All women very well learned, the which in their chairs read certain leſſons, euery one after other, and afterwardes the one diſputed againſt the other of ſundry and diuers matters.
                     And finally, there was betweene them great difference, for the Greeks ſpake very high things, not ſo profound, but with an excellent ſtile. We ought not to maruell that ſuch giftes were in thoſe women: for wee dayly ſee it by experience, that profound ſcience and high eloquence ſeldome meeteth in one perſonage.
                     The Greekes were very well pleaſed to heare the Romane women, and the Romaines remained aſtonied to heare the Greekes. And vpon this occaſion the Rhodians iudged in this ſort, that euery one of them ſhould be crowned with a crowne of Lawrel as vanquiſhers. And they iudged that in graue ſentences the Grecians had the beſt, and in eloquent ſpeech the Romanes had the victory. As the aboue named Euphronius ſayeth, the diſputations beeing ended, the Romane women returned to Rome: &amp; the Greeke women to Greece, where they were receiued with ſuch triumph and glory, as if they had won a battel, The Senate of the Rhodians for the memory of thoſe women (in the place of the diſputations) cauſed to bee ſet vp 20. pillers, in euery one of the which were the names of the women. Which was ſo ſumptuous a building that in Rhodes there were none like to it, ſaue only the Collyſeo. Thoſe pillers ſtood vntill the time of Heliogabalus the Emperour, who was ſo euill that The wickednes of Heliogabalus. he inuented new vices, and deſtroied the ancient memories.
                     The writers which write in that time, declare yet another thing, wherin the women of Greece were differēt from the women of Rome. That is to ſay, that the Greeke women were foūd more fairer then the Romane women: but the Romanes had a better grace &amp; more rich in apparel then the Greeks. They ſayd alſo that the Greekes were more hardy and ſtout then the Romanes: but the Romanes were more honeſt, pleaſant, and gracious then the Greekes.
                     And if this be true, I do counſell Princeſſes and great Ladies that they haue no more enuy at the honeſty of the Matrones of Rome, then at the boldnes of the Ladies of Gretia. For women were not born to ſlay men in the warre, but to ſpin, ſowe, and liue well like good houſewiues in the houſe.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXVIII. That women may bee no leſſe wiſe then men, and though they bee not, it is not through default of nature, but for want of good bringing vp.
                     
                     
                        CEaſing to ſpeake in generally, it is but reaſon wee ſpeake particularly, and that wee reduce to memory ſome ancient hiſtories of wiſe and diſcreete women, as well Greekes as Romans: &amp; for that theſe Ladies (ſeeing what others were in times paſt) may know what their duty is at this preſent.
                     In mine opinion, the duty that the men of this preſent haue to follow the courage that the Ancients had in fighting: the ſelfe ſame deſire ought women of this preſent to haue, to follow the ancient women in deuout liuing: for there is no good thing in the world at this preſent day, but the like hath been ſeene of our ancients heretofore. When any ſudden new and vnaccuſtomed thing doth happen, men that neuer ſaw the like, vſe to ſay, that there was neuer the like in the world, yet indeed they ſay not true: for though the thing bee vnto them new, it is through their ignorance and ſimpleneſſe which neither haue read it by themſelues, nor heard it of others: or this excellency hath the man that is learned, that for what ſoeuer hee heareth or ſayth, hee is nothing abaſhed at.
                     Since women now a dayes are ſo ignorant, that ſcarcely any of them can reade well, hee that ſhall reade this will maruell why I doe perſwade them to learne: but the truth known what the Ancients were, and what they did know: from this time forward I beleeue they would greatlie reproue the women of this preſent: for the time which the ancient women ſpent in vertues and ſtudies: The ancient women farre excelled theſe in our times. Theſe of this preſent conſume in pleaſures and vices.
                     
                        Bocchas in the prayſe of Women ſayth, that Lucius Sylla was a great companion of Marius the Conſull, in the time of the warre of Iugurtha and was no leſſe a friend of Caius Caeſar, in the time of the firſt ciuill warres. My penne needeth not to be occupied to write any thing of the life of Sylla: For all the Hiſtoriographers doe not onely reproue the cruelties which he vſed to his enemies, but alſo condemne him for the little faith he obſerued his friends.
                     This Conſull Sylla had three daughters, the one of them was named Lelia Sabina, the which of all the ſiſters was leaſt fayre, but amongſt all the Romanes ſhee was the moſt ſageſt: for ſhee read openly in Rome in a chayre both Greeke and Latine. After the warres of Mithridates, Lucius Sylla came to Rome, where he beheaded three thouſand Romanes which came to ſalute him: although before by his word he had aſſured them all: And in deed, and alſo iuſtly Lucius Sylla had been vtterly vndone for his fact, if his daughter had not made to the Senate a wiſe Oration: for often times it chanceth that the wiſedome of the good child doth remedy the folly of the wicked Father. The Hiſtorians ſay, that this Lelya Sabina had not onely a great grace in reading: but alſo ſhee had much excellency in writing: for ſhe wrote many letters and orations with her own hand, which her Father Lucius Sylla afterwards learned by hart: and as he was indeed quicke of ſpirite, ſo he vſed to recite them to the Senate alwayes for his purpoſe.
                     
                        
And let no man maruaile hereat for there are ſome of ſo groſſe vnderſtanding The difference betweene one man and another. that that which they write and ſtudie, they can ſcarcely vtter: &amp; others againe are of ſuch liuely wits, that of that onely which they haue heard, it ſeemeth maruellous to heare with what eloquence they will talke. Becauſe Sylla had ſuch and ſo excellent a daughter in his houſe, hee was eſteemed for a ſage and wiſe councellour throughout all the Common wealth.
                     He was counted very abſolute in executing, ſtrong in maintaining, &amp; for right eloquent in ſpeaking. Finally, of this came this ancient prouerbe which ſayth Lucius Sylla gouerneth his own countrey with the eloquence of his tongue: and is Lord of ſtrange nations by the force of his ſword.
                     What the great Plato hath beene, and what great authority he hath had amongſt his countrey men, and amongſt the ſtrangers it is apparant: for ſo much as the Greekes do acknowledge him of all other Phyloſophers to be the Prince: and likewiſe the Latines by one conſent call him diuine.
                     And me thinketh that in doing this, they doe no Phyloſopher iniurie: for as Plato in his life time had great modeſtie, ſo truely in his writing hee exceeded mans capacitie. An Hiſtorian called Hyzearchus declareth that Laſterna and Axiothea were two Greekes very well Iearned, and amongſt the Schollers of Plato chiefly renowmed. The one was of ſo perfect a memory, and the other of ſo high an vnderſtanding, that Plato oft times beeing in the chayre, and theſe two not readie, hee would not beginne to reade. And being demaunded wherefore hee reade not his Lecture? hee anſwered: I will not reade, for that there wanteth here vnderſtanding to conceyue, and alſo memory to retaine.
                     Meaning that Laſterna was abſent, that Axiothe was not yet come. The wiſedome of theſe two women ought to bee much, ſince Plato without them would not vtter one word, vnleſſe they were preſent in his Schoole. For Plato eſteemed more the vnderſtanding and memory of thoſe two women alone: then hee did the phyloſophy of his other Schollers together. Ariſtippus the phyloſopher was Scholler to Socrates, and of the moſt renowmed of Athens. Hee had a daughter called Aretha, the which was ſo well learned in Greeke and Latine letters, that the common renowme ſayd, the ſoule of Socrates was The commendation of Aretha. entred into Aretha: and the cauſe that mooued them to ſay this was, becauſe ſhee read and declared the doctrine of Socrates in ſuch wiſe, that it ſeemed to moſt men ſhee had rather write by hand, then learne by ſtudie. Bocchas in the ſecond booke of the prayſe of women, ſayeth, that this Aretha was ſo excellent a woman, that ſhee did not only learne for her ſelfe, but alſo to teach others: and did not onely teach in diuers Schooles, but alſo ſhee wrote many and ſundrie bookes, one eſpecially in the prayſe of Socrates, an other of the manner of bringing vp children, an other of the Warres of Athens, an other of the tyrannicall force, an other of the Common Wealth of Socrates, an other of the infelicity of Women, an other of the tillage of the Auncients, an other of the Wonders of the Mount Olimpus, an other of the vaine care of the Sepulchre, an other of the care of the Antes, an other of the Workemanſhippe of the Bees in honey: and ſhee wrote two others, the one of the vanities of youth, and the other of the miſeries of age.
                     
                        
This woman did reade openly naturall and morall Phyloſophy in the Schooles of Athens, for the ſpace of fiue and twenty yeares: ſhe made fortie bookes, ſhe had a hundred and ten Phyloſophers to her Schollers, ſhee dyed being at the age of ſeuentie and ſeuen yeares, and the Athenians after her death, engraued on her graue theſe words.

                     As Marcus Varro ſayth, the ſects of the Philoſophers were more then ſeuenty, but in the end they were reduced into ſeuen, and in the end they were brought into three ſects chiefly. That is to ſay, Stoickes, Peripatetickes, and Pythagoriques. Of theſe Pythagoriques, Pythagoras was the Prince, Hizearcus, Annius Ruſticus, and Laertius, with Euſebius and Boccas, all affirme one thing, whereunto I did not greatly giue credite, which is: that this Phyloſopher Pithagoras had a ſiſter, not onely learned, but (if it bee lawfull to ſpeake it) excellently learned. And they ſay, that not ſhe of Pythagoras, but Pythagoras of her learned phyloſophy. And of a truth it is a matter whereof I was ſo greatly abaſhed, that I cannot tell who could bee maiſter of ſuch a woman: ſince ſhee had Pythagoras the great phyloſopher to her Scholler. The name of the woman was Thecclea to whom Pythagoras her brother wrot and ſent her a letter, when hee read phyloſophy at Rhodes, and ſhe at Samothracia doing the like. The Epiſtle was thus,
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXIX. Of a Letter which Pythagoras ſent to his ſiſter Theoclea, hee beeing in Rhodes, and ſhee in Sam othracia reading both Philoſophie.
                     
                     
                        
                           PYthagoras thy brother, and Diſciple to thee Theoclea his ſiſter, health &amp; encreaſe of wiſedome wiſheth. I haue read the book which thou diddeſt ſend mee, of fortune and miſfortune, from the beginning to the end: and now I know, that thou art no leſſe graue in making, then gracious in teaching. The which doth not chance very oft vnto vs, which are men, and much leſſe (as wee haue ſeene) to you women. For the Philoſopher Ariſtippus was rude in ſpeaking, but profound in writing: and Amenides was briefe in writing, and eloquent in ſpeaking. Thou haſt ſtudyed and written in ſuch ſort, that in learning, that thou ſheweſt, thou ſeemeſt to haue read all the Philoſophers: and in the antiquities that thou doeſt declare, it ſeemeth that thou haſt ſeene all the time paſt: Wherin thou being a woman ſheweſt thy ſelfe more then a woman, becauſe the nature of women is to caſt The proty of women. their eyes onely in that that is preſent, and to forget that is paſt. They tell me that thou doeſt occupy thy ſelfe now in writing of our Country. And truely in this caſe I cannot ſay, but that you haue matter enough to write on: For the warres and trauels of our times haue beene ſuch, and ſo great, that I had rather reade them in bookes, then to ſee them with my eyes.
                     And if it bee ſo, as I ſuppoſe it is, I beſeech thee heartily, and by the immortall Gods I coniure thee, that in writing the affayres of thy Countrey thou doeſt vſe thy penne diſcreetely. I meane, that thou doe not in this caſe blemiſh thy writing, by putting therein any flattery or leſing. For oft times Hiſtoriographers, in blaſing more then truth, the giftes of their Countrey, cauſe worthily to be ſuſpected their writing.
                     Thou knoweſt very well, how that in the battell paſt, the Rhodians were ouercome, and that ours remained victorious. Mee thinketh thou ſhouldſt not in this caſe greatly magnifie, extoll, or exalt ours, becauſe in the end they fought to reuenge their iuiury, neyther thou oughteſt to blame the Rhodians, for they did not fight but in the ayde of Rome, I ſpeake this (my ſiſter) becauſe for to defend their owne, women ſhew themſelues Lyons: and for to defend the things of another man, men ſhew themſelus chickens: For in the end hee onely may bee counted ſtrong, the which defendeth not his owne houſe, but which dyeth defending his, and another mans. I will not deny the naturall loue of my Country, nor I will not deny but that I loue them that write, and ſpeake well thereof: but mee thinketh it is not reaſon, that they ſhould diſprayſe the goodneſſe and truth of other Countries: nor that they ſhould ſo highly commend the euill and vileneſſe of their owne: For there is not in the world this day ſo barren a realme, but may bee commended for ſomething therein, nor there is ſo perfect a nation, but in ſomthings may be reproued. Thou canſt not deny me, but that amōgſt thy brethren I am the eldeſt, and thou canſt not deny but that amongſt all thy Diſciples I am the youngeſt, and ſince that for being thy Diſciple, I ought

to obey thee, thou likewiſe for that I am thy eldeſt brother oughteſt to beleeue me. By the faith of a people, I doe counſell thee my ſiſter, that thou do trauell much to be profound Man without truth is not worthie to be regarded. in thy words, vpright in thy life, and honeſt of thy perſon: and beſides all this, true in thy writing: For I let thee vnderſtand, that if the body of the man without the ſoule is little regarded: I ſweare vnto thee that the mouth of a man without truth, is much leſſe eſteemed.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXX. The Authour followeth his purpoſe, perſwading Princeſſes and other Ladies to endeauour themſelues to be wiſe, as the women were in olde time.
                     
                     
                        THis therefore was the letter, which Pythagoras ſent to his ſiſter Theoclea, whereby is ſhewed the great humility of him, and the hie eloquence of her, Hierchus the Greeke and Plutarch alſo in the booke of the gouernement of Princes ſay, that Pythagaras 
                        The humilitie of Pythagoras. had not onely a ſiſter, which was called Theoclea, of whom he learned ſo much Philoſophy, but alſo he had a daughter, the wiſedome and knowledge of whom ſurmounted her Aunt, and was equall to her Father.
                     I thinke it no leſſe incredible which is ſpoken of the daughter, then that which is ſpoken of the Aunt, which is, that thoſe of Athens did reioyce more to heare her ſpeake in her houſe, then for to heare Pythagoras reade in the Schoole.
                     And it ought to bee beleeued: for the ſaying of the graue Authours on the one part: and by that wee daily ſee on the other part: For in the end it is more pleaſure to heare a man tell mery tales, hauing grace and comelynes in his words, then to heare a graue man ſpeake the truth, with a rude and rough tongue.
                     I haue found in many writings, what they haue ſpoken of Pythagoras, and his Daughter: but none telleth her name, ſaue only in an Epiſtle that Phalaris the Tyrant wrote, I found this worde written, where hee ſaith: Polychrata, that was the Daughter of the Phyloſopher Pythagoras, was young and exceeding wiſe, more faire then rich, and was ſo much honoured for the puritie of her life, and ſo highly eſteemed for her pleaſaunt Tongue: that the word which ſhee ſpake ſpinning at her Diſtaffe, was more eſteemed then the Phyloſophie that her Father read in the ſchoole. And he ſaide more. It is ſo great a pittie to ſee and heare, that women at this preſent are ſo diſhoneſt, and in their tongues ſo malicious, that I haue greater pleaſure in the good renowme of one that is dead, then in the infamie of all them which are aliue: For a good woman is more worth with her diſtaffe ſpinning, then a hundred euill Queenes, with their royall Scepters reigning. By the words which Phalaris ſaid in his letter it ſeemed that this Daughter of Pythagoras was called Polichrate.
                     
                     
                        Pythagoras therefore made manie Commentaryes, as well of his owne countrey, as of ſtrangers. In the end he dyed in Meſopotamia, where at the houre of his death, hee ſpake vnto his Daughter Polichrate: and ſaide theſe wordes. I ſee my Daughter, that the houre wherein I muſt ende my life approcheth. The Gods gaue it mee, and now they will take it from mee: Nature gaue me byrth, and now ſhee giueth me death: the Earth gaue me the bodie, and now it returneth to aſhes. The woefull Fatall deſtenyes

gaue mee a little goods, mingled with many trauells: So that (Daughter) of al things which I enioyed here in this world, I carrie none with mee: For, hauing all as I had it, by the way of borrowing: now at my death, eache man taketh his owne.
                     I die ioyfully: not for that I leaue thee rich, but for that I leaue thee learned. And in token of my tender heart, I bequeathe vnto thee all my Bookes, wherein thou ſhalt finde the treaſure of all my trauells. And I tell thee that that I giue thee, is the riches gotten with mine owne ſweate: and not obtained to the preiudice of another. For the loue I beare vnto thee (Daughter) I pray thee: and by the immortall Gods I conjure thee, that thou bee ſuch, and ſo good, that although I die, yet at the leaſt thou mayſt keepe my memorie: For thou knoweſt well what Homer ſayth, ſpeaking of Achilles, and Pyrrhus: That the good life of the Childe that is aliue, keepeth the renowne of the Father which is dead. Theſe were the wordes which the Phyloſopher ſpake to his daughter, lying in his death bed. And thogh perhaps hee ſpake not theſe wordes, yet at the leaſt this was the effect and meaning.
                     As the great Poet Mantuan ſayth: King Euander was father of the grant Pallas, and he was a great friend of king Eneas: he vaunted himſelfe to diſcend of the Linage of the Troyans: and therefore when king Eneas, and prince Turnus, had great Warres betweene them, which of them ſhould haue the Princeſſe Lauinia in Marriage, (the which at that time was onely heyre of Italie) king Euander ayded Eneas, not only with goods, but alſo ſending him his owne Sonne in perſon: For the friendes ought for their true friendes willingly to ſhead their bloud, and in their behalfe, without demaunding, they ought alſo to ſpend their goods
                     This King Euander had a Wife ſo well learned, that that which the Greekes ſayde of her, ſeemeth to bee fables: That is to ſay, of her eloquence and wiſedome, for they ſay, that if The wife of King Euander a Propheteſſe. that which this woman wrote of the warres of Troy, had not been through enuie caſt into the fire: the name of Homer had at this day remayned obſcure.
                     The reaſon hereof is, becauſe that woman was in the time of the deſtruction of Troy, and wrote as a witneſſe of ſight.
                     But Homer wrote after the deſtruction of Troy, as one affectioned vnto the Prince Achilles, as a friend of the Greekes, and enemie of the Troians.
                     And truely when a Writer is affectioned to any perſon, his writing of force muſt be ſuſpected. The wife of this King Euander was called by her name Nicoſtrata, albeit others called her Carmenta, for the eloquence ſhee had in her verſes. For they ſay, that ſhe made as eaſily in meeter as others doe in proſe.
                     The Hiſtoriographers of the Gentiles ſay, that ſhee prophefied the deſtruction of Troy fifteen years before. She tolde the comming of Aeneas into Italy, and ſpake of the warres that ſhould be before the marriage of Lauinia, and ſaid how Aſcanius the ſonne of Enea ſhould builde Alba longa. She ſayde further, that of the Latine Kings ſhould deſcende the Romaines, and that the reuenge which Rome ſhould take of Greece ſhould bee greater, then that which Greece did take of Troy. And ſhee ſayde alſo that the greateſt Warre which Rome ſhould haue, ſhould be againſt the Princes of Affricke, and that in the end Rome ſhould triumph ouer all the Realmes of the earth, and finally a nation vnknowne, ſhould triumph for euer in Rome. As Euſeſebius
                        
                        Caeſarten ſaith: The Routaines kept theſe writings in as great eſtimation in the high capitoll, as the Chriſtians kept their faith vnto GOD.
                     
                     King Darius after he was vanquiſhed in the firſt Battell, by King Alexander the great (before he was in the ſecond battel vtterly deſtroyed) trauelled and ſought many wayes and means to the ende he might be friend vnto Alexander: And in very deede King Darius was ſage to ſeeke it, but not ſo happie to obtain it. For to Princes the peace is more worth that is honeſt, then is the victorie which is bloudie.
                     Betwixt theſe two ſo ſtoute Princes Truce was made for three moneths, and in the meane time, the Prieſts of the Chaldeans treated peace, with theſe conditions: that the great Alexander ſhould marry the daughter of king Darius and that Darius ſhould giue her a great quantity of gold: and beſides this, that he ſhould endow her with the third part of his realme. And truely theſe meanes were good: For, among Princes, there is nothing that ſooner pacifieth olde iniuries, then to make betweene them newe Mariages.
                     King Alexander excuſed himſelfe of this marriage, ſaying that hee was but xxiiij, yeares of age, and that hee was too young to bee marryed: becauſe amongſt the Macedonians there was a cuſtom, that the woman could not be marryed vntill xxv. yeares of age, nor A cuſtome among the Macedonians. the man vntill xxx. The Daughter of King Darius was faire, rich, and noble: but the beſt ſhe wanted, for ſhe was not wiſe And this was the cauſe why K: Alexander refuſed her for his wife: for in thoſe dayes women were not marryed becauſe they were rich, but beloued, becauſe they were wiſe: And finally, the woman that had ſtudyed beſt, came commonly to the higheſt Marriage.
                     
                        Antonius Ruſticus, and Quintus Seuerus ſay, that the great Alexander (after he had forſaken the daughter of king Darius,) marryed a wife which was a poore woman, and deformed, called Barſina, which indeede was neyther with riches nor beautie endued: but without doubt in the Greeke and Latine tongue moſt excellently learned, And when the Princes of Macedonie would haue withdrawn him from that marriage: asking him why hee eſteemed the rich leſſe then the poore? he aunſwered thus.
                     
                        I ſee my Friends, in Marriage it ſuffiſeth 
                        K. Alexanders anſwer concerning his mariage 
                        the husband to bee rich, and the woman wiſe: For the Office of the husband is to winne that which is loſt, and the Office of the wife is to keepe ſafe that which is wonne.
                     
                     
                        Strabo de ſitu Orbis, ſaith: that the fifte Queene of Lides was Mirthas, the which of her bodie was ſo little, that ſhee ſeemed to bee a Dwarffe: and in quicknes of wit ſo high, that they called her a giant. For the man that hath a ſtout ſtomack, and a little body, may well be called a giaunt: and hee that hath a great body, and a cowards hart may iuſtly be named a Dwarffe. For that this excellent Queen Mirtha was ſuch a wiſe wife when ſhe was marryed, and afterwards alſo a widowe very honeſt, and aboue all things in Phyloſophie excellently learned,
                     The Lides counted this Queen Mirtha amongſt the ſeuen Kings, of the which they vaunted themſelues to be gouerned, as of glorious Princes. For the Auncients gaue as much glorie to Women learned in Letters, as vnto the valiant and ſtoute men expert in Armes.
                     
                        Cornificius the Poete, as Laertius ſaieth, had a ſiſter called Cornificia, the which in Greeke &amp; Latin letters was not onely learned, but alſo in making Metre and Epigrames very expert.
                     They write that of this Woman, which of few men the like hath been heard: That is to ſay, that ſhe made verſes

and Epigrams better at the firſt ſight then her brother did with much ſtudy. And it is not too much incredible to put any doubt in that that is ſpoken: for the penne hath more The prayſe of Cornificia. ſwiftneſſe of the liuely ſpirit, then the tongue hath of the ſmall vnderſtanding.
                     This Poet Cornificius was reſident a long time in Rome, and was alwayes poore, and voide of all fauour, thogh indeede hee was better learned then others, which were in greater eſtimation: the which thing dayly chaunceth in the Court of Princes: For there is no difference, whether they bee fooles or wiſe: but whether they be acceptable to the Princes.

                     This Poet Cornificius therefore going through Rome little ſet by of any, by chaunce a Romane named Calphurnius to ſcoffe at him ſayd. Tell 
                        The ſpeech betweene Calphurnius and Cornificius. 
                        me Cornificius, haſt thou had any fortunate day ſince thou wert borne? for in theſe twenty yeers that I haue known thee, I neuer ſaw thee in fauour, and if I bee not deceyued, it is fifteene yeeres ſince I knew thee haue this coate. The poore Poet anſwered him; I let thee know my friend, that I cannot tell which is greater thy euill lucke, or my greate felicitie. The Romane Calphurnius replyed, Tell me Cornificius, How canſt thou call thy ſelfe happy, ſince thou haſt not a loafe of bread to eate, nor a gowne to put on thy backe, and why ſayeſt thou that I am vnhappy, ſince thou and thy family may be fed with that alone, which at my table remayneth? To this the poet anſwered, I will that thou know my friend and neighbour, that my felicitie is not for that I haue little, but for that I deſire leſſe then I haue.
                     
                     
                        And thy euill lucke is not for that thou baſt much, but for that thou deſireſt more, and doeſt little eſteem that that thou haſt. And if thou be rich, it is for that thou neuer ſpakeſt truth: and if I he poore, it is becauſe I neuer tolde lye. For the houſe that is ſtuffed with riches, is commonly voyd of the truth.
                     
                     
                        And I tell thee further, that I call my ſelfe happie, becauſe I haue a ſiſter, which is the beſt eſteemed in all Italie, and thou haſt a Wife the moſt diſhoneſt in all Rome. And ſith it is ſo betweene thee and mee, I referre it to no mans iudgement but to thine: which is better, eyther to be poore as I am with honour, or elſe to bee rich as thou art, and liue with infamte? Theſe wordes paſſed betweene the Romane Calphurnius, and the Poet Cornificius.
                     
                     I deſire to declare the excellencie of thoſe few auncient women (as well Greekes, as Latines, and Romanes) to the intent that Princeſſes and great Ladyes may knowe that the auncient women were more eſteemed for their ſciences then for their beauties.
                     Therefore the Princeſſes and great Ladies ought to thinke that if they be womē, the other were alſo in like mā
                        ner: and if they bee fraile, the others were alſo weake. If they be marryed, the others alſo had Husbands: if they haue theyr willes, the others had alſo what they wanted: If they be tender, the others were not ſtrong.
                     Finally, they ought not to excuſe themſelues, ſaying: that women are vnmeete for to learne. For a woman hath more abilitie to learne Sciences in the ſcholes, then the Parate hath to ſpeake words in the cage.
                     In my opinion, Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought not to eſteeme themſelues more then another, for that they haue fairer hayres then others, or for that they are better Apparrelled then another: or that they haue more riches then another.
                     
                        
But they ought therfore to eſteeme themſelues, not for that they can doe more then others. To ſay the trueth, the faire and yeallow hayres, the rich and braue Apparel, the great treaſurs, the ſumptuous Pallaces, and ſtrong Buildings: theſe and other like pleaſures are not guydes and leaders vnto vertues, but rather Spyes and Scowtewatches to vices.
                     Oh what an excellent thing were it that the noble Ladyes would eſteeme themſelues, not for that they can doe: How great Ladies ought to to eſteeme of thēſelues. but for that they knowe.
                     For it is more commendations to know how to teach two Philoſophers then to haue authority to commaund a hundred knightes.
                     It is a ſhame to write it, but it is more pittie to ſee it, that is to ſay, to reade that wee read of the wiſedome and worthineſſe of the auncient Matrons paſt: and to ſee as we do ſee, the frailenes of theſe yong ladies preſent.
                     For they coueted to haue Diſciples both learned and experimented: and thoſe of this preſent, deſire nothing but to haue ſeruants, not only ignorant, but deceitfull, and wicked And I doe not maruell, ſeeing that which I ſee, that at this preſent in Court ſhe is of little value, &amp; leaſt eſteemed amōg Ladies, which hath faireſt Seruants, &amp; is leaſt entertained of Gentlemen.
                     What ſhall I ſay more in this matter? but that they in times paſt ſtriued who ſhold write better, and compile the beſt books: and theſe at this preſent doe not ſtriue, but who ſhall haue the richeſt, and moſt ſumptuous Apparrell. For the Ladyes thinke it a jolyer matter, to weare a Gowne of a new faſhion, then the ancients did to read a leſſon of Phyloſophie.
                     The ancient Ladyes ſtriued which of them was wiſeſt: but theſe of our dayes contend who ſhalbe faireſt. For at this day the Ladyes would chooſe rather to haue the face adorned with beautie, then the heart endued with wiſedome.
                     The Auncient Ladyes contended which ſhould bee beſt able to teach others: but theſe Ladyes now a dayes contend how they may moſt finely apparrell themſelues. For in theſe dayes they giue more honour to a Woman richly Apparrelled, then they giue to another with honeſty beautified.
                     Finally, with this word I doe conclude; and let him marke that ſhall What difference there is betweene the women of our time &amp; the ancients. reade it, that in the olde time women were ſuch, that their vertues cauſed all men to keepe ſilence: and now their vices bee ſuch, that they compell all men to ſpeake.
                     I will not by this worde any man ſhould be ſo bold in general to ſpeake euill of all the Ladyes: for in this caſe I ſweare, that there are not at this day ſo many good vertuous women in the world: but that I haue more enuie at the life they lead in ſecrete, then at all the ſciences which the auncient women read in publike.
                     Wherefore my pen doth not ſhew it ſelfe extreame, but to thoſe which onely in ſumptuous Apparrell, and vaine words doe conſume their whole life: and to thoſe which in reading a good Booke, would not ſpend one onely houre. To proue my intention of that I haue ſpoken, the aboue written ſufficeth: But to the ende Princeſſes and great Ladyes may ſee (at the leaſt) how much beter it ſhalbe for them to know little, then to haue and poſſeſſe much, and to be able to do more: I wil remēber them of that which a Romain woman wrote to her children, wherby they ſhal perceiue how eloquent a woman ſhe was in her ſayings, and how true a mother in her coūſel. For in the end of her letter ſhe perſwadeth her children to the trauels of the warre: not for any other cauſe, but to auoyde the pleaſures of Rome.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXXI. Of the worthineſſe of the Lady Cornelia, and of a notable Epiſtle ſhee wrote to her two ſonnes which ſerued in the warres, Tiberius and Caius, diſſwading them from the pleaſures of Rome, and exhorting them to endure the trauels of warre.
                     
                     
                        
                           ANNius Ruſticus in the booke of the Antiquities of the Romanes ſayeth, that in Rome there were fiue principall Iynages, that is to ſay, Fabritii, Torquatii, Brutii, Fabit, and Cornelii, though there were in Rome other new lynages, whereof Fiue Families in Rome chiefly were eſteemed. there were many excellent perſonages: yet alwayes theſe which came of the fiue lynages, were kept, placed and preferred to the firſt Offices of the common wealth.
                     For Rome honoured thoſe that were preſent in ſuch ſort, that it was without the preiudice of thoſe that are gone. Amongſt thoſe v. linages the Romaines alwayes counted the Cornelii moſt fortunate, that which were ſo hardy, and couragious in fight, and ſo modeſt in life, that of their family there was neuer found any cowardly man in the field, nor any defamed woman in the twone: They ſay of this linage of the Cornenelii, among many other there were 4. ſingular and notable women, among the which the chiefe was the mother of Graccht whoſe name was Cornelia, and liued with more honor for the ſciences ſhee read in Rome, then for the conqueſts that her children had in Affrike. Before her children were brought into the Empire, they talked of none other thing but of their ſtrength and hardineſſe, throughout the world: and therefore a Romain one day asked this woman Cornelia, wherof ſhe tooke moſt vain glory, to ſee her ſelfe miſtreſſe of ſo many Diſciples, or mother of ſo valiant children. The Lady Cornelia anſwered. I doe eſteeme the ſcience more which I haue learned, then the children which I haue brought forth. For in the end, the children keepe in honour the life: but the Diſciples continue the renowme after death.
                     And ſhe ſayd further, I am aſſured that the Diſciples daily wil waxe better and better: and it may be that my children will waxe worſe and worſe. The deſires of young men are ſo variable, that they dayly haue new inuentions. With one accord all the writers doe greatly commend this woman Cornelia, in eſpeciall for being wiſe and honeſt, and furthermore becauſe ſhe read Phyloſophy in Rome openly.
                     And therefore after her death they ſet vp in Rome a ſtatue, ouer the gate Salaria, whereupon there was grauen this Epigram.
                     
                        This heape of earth, Cornelle doth encloſe 
                        The Epitaph of Cornelia.
                     
                     
                        Of wretched Gracches, that loe the mother was

                     AMong the Latines Cicero was the Prince of al the Romane Rethorike, and the chiefeſt with his pen enditing Epiſtles: yet they ſay, that he did not onely ſee the writings of this Cornelia, but read them, and did not onely reade them, but alſo with the ſentences thereof profited himſelfe.

And hereof a man ought not to maruell: for there is no man in the world ſo wiſe of himſelfe, but may further his doings with the aduiſe of an other.
                     
                        Cicero ſo highly exalted theſe writings, that he ſayde in his Rethorike theſe or ſuch other like words,
                     If the name of a woman had not not blemiſhed Cornelia, truly ſhe deſerued to be head of al Philoſophers: For I neuer ſaw ſo graue ſentences proceede from ſo fraile fleſh Since Cicero ſpake theſe words of Cornelia, it cannot be, but that the writings of ſuch a woman in her time were verie liueleſſe, and of great reputation, yet notwithſtanding there is no memory of her, but that an author for his purpoſe declareth an Epiſtle of this maner. Sextus Cheronenſis in his booke of the prayſe of women, reciteth the letter which ſhee ſent to her children. Shee remaining in Rome, and they being at the wars in Affricke.
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              The Letter of Cornelia to her two ſons Tiberius and Caius, otherwiſe called Gracchi.
                           
                              Cornelia the Romane, that by the fathers ſide am of the Cornelii, &amp; on the mother ſide of the Fabii: to you my two ſonnes, Gracchii, which A letter of a Romane Lady to her two ſons. are in the warres of Affricke, ſuch health to you I doe wiſh as a mother to her children ought to deſire. You haue vnderſtoode right well my children how my father dyed, I being but three yeares of age, and that this 22. yeares I haue remained widdow, and that this 20. yeares I haue read Rethorike in Rome. It is 7. yeeres ſince I ſaw you, and 12. yeares ſince your brethren, my children dyed in the great plague. You know 8. yeeres are paſt ſince I left my ſtudy, and came to ſee you in Cicilia, becauſe you ſhould not forſake the wars, to come to ſee me in Rome: for to mee could come no greater pain then to ſee you abſent from the ſeruice of the Common wealth. I deſire my children to ſhew you how I haue paſſed my life in labour and trauell, to the entent you ſhould not deſire to ſpende yours in reſt and idlenes: For to me that am in Rome, there can want no troubles: be yee aſſured that vnto you which are in the wars ſhall want no perils: For in warres renowne is neuer ſolde but by weight, or changed with loſſe of life.
                           The young Fabius, ſonne of my aunt, the aged Fabia, at the third Calends of March brought mee a letter, the which you ſent: and truly it was more briefe then I would haue wiſhed it: for betweene ſo deere children, and ſo louing a mother, it is not ſuffered that the abſence of your perſons ſhould be ſo farre, and the letters which you write ſo briefe, By thoſe that goe from hence thither, I alwaies doe ſend you commendations: and of thoſe that come from thence hither, I doe enquire of newes.
                           Some ſay they haue ſeene you, others tell mee they haue ſpoken with you: ſo that with this my heart is ſomwhat quieted: for between them that loue greatly, it may bee endured that the fight be ſeldom, ſo that the health be certaine. I am ſole, I am a widdow, I am aged, and now all my kindred are dead. I haue endured many trauels in Rome, and the greateſt of all is (my children) of your abſence: for the paine is greater to be voyd of aſſured friends, then aſſault is dangerous of cruell enemies. Since you are young, and not very rich, ſince you are hardie, and brought vp in the trauels of Affricke, I do not doubt but that you do deſire to come to Rome, to ſee &amp; know that now you are men

which you haue ſeen when you were children: for men doe not loue their Country ſo much for that it is good: as they doeloue it for that it is naturall.
                           Beleeue me children, there is no man liuing that hath ſeene or heard ſpeake of Rome in times paſt: but hath great griefe, ſorrow and pitty to ſee it at this preſent: for as their hearts are pittifull, and their eyes tender: ſo they cannot behold that without great ſorrow, which in times paſt they haue ſeene in great glory. O my children, you ſhall know that Rome is greatly changed from that it was wont to be. To reade that wee doe reade of it in times paſt, and to ſee that which wee ſee of it now preſent, wee muſt needs eſteeme that which the Ancients haue written as a ieſt, or elſe beleeue it but as a dreame.
                           There is no other thing now at Rome, but to ſee iuſtice corrupted, the common-weale oppreſſed, lies blown abroad, the truth kept vnder, the Satyres ſilent, the flatterers open mouthed, the inflamed perſons to bee Lords, and the patient to be ſeruants; and aboue all, and worſe then all, to ſee the euill liue in reſt and contented, and the good troubled and diſpleaſed. Forſake, forſake (my Children that City, where the good haue occaſion to weepe, and the euill haue liberty to laugh. I cannot tell what to ſay in this matter, as I would ſay: truly the Common weale is at this day ſuch and ſo woful, that each wiſe man (without compariſon) would haue greater pleaſure to bee in the wars of Affricke, then in the peace at Rome: For in the good war, a man ſeeth of whom he ſhould take heed, but in the The wickedneſſe of Rome deſcribed, euill peace, no man knoweth whom to truſt. Therefore my children, ſince you are naturall of Rome; I will tell you what Rome is at this preſent. I let you know that the Veſtall virgins are now diſſolute, the honour of the gods is forgotten, the profite of the Common weale no man ſecketh, of the exerciſe of chiualrie, there is no memory; for the orphanes and widdowes there is no man doth anſwer, to miniſter iuſtice they haue no regard, and the diſſolute vices of the youth are without meaſure. Finally, Rome that in times paſt was a receite of all the good and vertuous, is now made a denne of all theeues and vitious. I feare me, I feare me, leſt our mother Rome in ſhort time will haue ſome ſudden and great fall, for both men and Cities that fal from the top of their felicitie purchaſe greater infamie with thoſe that ſhal come after then the glory that they haue had of them that be paſt.
                           Peraduenture, my children, you deſire to ſee the walles and buildings of Rome: for thoſe things which children ſee firſt in their youth, the ſame they loue and keepe alwayes in memory vntill their age. As the auncient buildings of Rome are deſtroied, and the few that are now built: So would I you ſhould loſe your earneſt affection to come to ſee them: For indeede the noble hearts are aſhamed to ſee that thing amiſſe, which they cannot remedie. Do not thinke my children, though Rome be made worſe in manners, that therefore it is diminiſhed in buildings: For I let you vnderſtand, if you know it not, that if a wall doth decay, there is no man that doth repayre it.
                           If a houſe fall, there is no man that will rayſe it vppe againe. If a ſtreete bee foule, there is no man that will make it cleane. If the Riuer carry away any bridge, there is no man that will ſet it vp againe. If any Antiquity decay, there is no man that will amend it. If any wood be cut, there is no man that wil keepe it. If the Trees waxe olde, there

is no man that will plant them a new: If the pauement of the ſtreetes bee broken, there is no man that will laye it againe. Finally, there is nothing in Rome at this day ſo euill handled, as thoſe things which by the common voyces are ordered.
                           Theſe things (my children) though I doe greatly lament (as it is reaſon) yet you ought little to eſteeme them all: but this all onely ought to bee eſteemed, and with droppes of bloud to be lamented. That now in Rome, when the buildings in many places fall downe, the vices all wholy together are rayſed vp. O wofull mother Rome, ſince that in thee, the more the wals decay, the more the vices encreaſe. Peraduenture (my children) ſince you are in thoſe frontiers of Africke, you deſire to ſee your parents here in Rome. And there at I maruell not, for the loue which our naturall Country doth giue, the ſtrange country cannot take away. All thoſe which come from thoſe parties doe bring vs no other certaine newes, but of the multitude of thoſe which die, and are ſlaine in Affricke, therefore ſince you ſend vs ſuch news from thence, looke not that we ſhould ſend you any other then the like from hence: for death hath ſuch authority, that it killeth the armed in the warres: and ſlayeth the quiet in peace.
                           I let you know that Licia your ſiſter is dead, Druſio your vnckle is dead, Torquatus your neighbour is dead, His wiſe our coſen, and her 3. daughters are dead: Fabius your great friend is dead: Euander and his children are dead: Bibulus which read for me in the chaire, the laſt yeare is alſo dead.
                           Finally, there are ſo many and ſo good with all that be dead, that it is a great ſhame and pitty to ſee (at this preſent) ſo many euil as do liue: know ye my children, that all theſe and many others which ye left aliue full high in Rome, are now become wormes meat full low vnder the earth, and death alſo doth ſummon me vnto the graue. If you (my children) did conſider The vncertainety of mans life. what ſhall become of you hereafter, truely you will thinke it better to weepe a thouſand yeares with the dead, then to laugh one houre with thoſe that be aliue. Remembring that I bare yee in great paine, and haue nouriſhed you in great trauel, &amp; that yee came of my proper entrailes: I would haue you as children about me for the comfort and conſolation of my paines: but in the end beholding the proweſſes of theſe that are paſt, that bindeth their heires, I am content to ſuffer ſo long abſēce your perſons, onely to the end you may gette honour in chiualrie: for I had rather heare tell you ſhould liue like knights in Affricke, then to ſee you vtterly loſt here in Rome, My children as you are in the wars of Affricke, ſo I doubt not but that you deſire to ſee the pleaſurs of Rome: for there is no man in this world ſo happy, but at his neighbours proſperity had ſom enuy; enuy not the vicious, neyther deſire to bee among vices: for truly vices are of ſuch condition, that they bring not with thē ſo much pleaſure, as they leaue ſorrow behind them, for the true delight is not in pleaſure which ſuddenly vaniſheth but in the truth which euer remaineth. I thanke the gods for all theſe things, firſt for that they made me wiſe and not fooliſh: for to a woman it is a ſmal matter to be called ſo fraile, that indeed ſhe bee not fooliſh The ſecond I thank the gods, becauſe in all times of my troubles, they haue giuen me patience to endure them: for the man onely in this life may be called vnhappie, to whom the gods in his troubles giueth not patiēce. The 3. I thanke the gods for that thoſe 65. years which I haue liued,

I neuer hitherto was defamed: For the Woman by no reaſon can complaine of her fortune, if in none of her troubles ſhee hath loſt her honour.
                           The fourth, I thanke the Gods that in this fortie yeares I haue liued in Rome, and remained widow, there was neuer man nor woman that contended with mee: For ſince we women little profite the commonwealth, it is but reaſon that ſhee which with euill demeanors hath paſſed her life ſhould by iuſtice receiue her death.
                           The fifth, I giue the Gods thankes, that they gaue me children, the which are better contented to ſuffer the trauells of Affrike, then to enioy the pleaſures of Rome. Doe not count me (my Children) for ſo vnlouing a Mother, that I would not haue you alwaies before mine eyes: but conſidering that many good mens children haue been loſt, onely for being brought vp in the exceſſiue pleaſures of Rome, I doe content my ſelfe with your abſence: 
                                 
                                    〈…〉
                                 
                               
                              For the man that deſireth perpetuall renon me, though hee bee not baniſhed, hee ought to abſent himſelfe from his Natiue countrey. My deare childrē, I moſt earneſtly deſire you that alwayes you accompanie your ſelues with the good, with the moſt Auncients, and with thoſe which are graue, and moſt expert in counſell, and with thoſe that haue moſt ſeene the world: and doe not vnderſtand moſt of the world, by thoſe that haue ſeene moſt countreys For the ripe councell proceedeth not from the man that hath trauelled in many Countreys, but from him that hath ſelt himſelfe in many daungers.
                           Since the nature of the Countrey (my Children) doth knocke with the hāmer at the heart of man, I feare that if you come and ſee your friends and parents, you ſhall alwayes line in care &amp; penſiuenes, and being penſiue, you ſhall alwayes liue euill contented, and you ſhall not do that which becometh Romane knights to do. And you not being valiaunt knights, your enemyes ſhall alwayes reioyce ouer you, and your deſires ſhal neuer take effect: for of thoſe men which are carefull and heauy, proceedeth alwaies ſeruices vnworthie. I deſire you heartily, and by this preſent letter I counſell you, that you will not in any wiſe ſeeke to come to Rome: For as I haue ſaide you ſhall know few of thoſe that did know you: for eyther they are dead or baniſhed, poor, or ſick, aged, or come to nought ſad, or euill contented: So that ſithence you are not able to remedie their griefes, it is beſt you ſhould not come hither to ſee their troubles. For no man cōmeth to Rome but to weepe with the liuing, or to ſigh for thē that be dead. Truly (my children I know not what pleaſure is in Rome, that ſhold cauſe any good man to come hither, and to forſake Affrike? for if there you haue any enemies, here you ſhal want friends. If you haue the Sword that pierceth the body, we haue the tōgue here that deſtroyeth the renowme. If you be vexed with the Thieues of Affrike, wee are wounded with the traytours, flatterers, and lyars of Italie. If you lacke reſt, we haue here too much The commendations of warlike men. trouble.
                           Finally, ſeeing that I doe ſee in Rome, and hearing that which I doe heare of Affrike, I cōmend your warre and abhorre your peace: If you doe greatly eſteem that which I haue ſaid, eſteem much more that which I ſhall ſay, which is, that wee alwayes heare that you are conquerors of the Affricanes, and you ſhall heare alwayes that we are conquered by vices. Therefore if am a true mother, I had rather ſee you win a perpetuall memory among ſtrangers, then to liue with infamie at home in your countrey.
                           Peraduenture with hope that you ſhallenioy ſome goods, you will offer to take occaſion to come to Rome:

When this thing ſhall come to your minds, remember (my Children) that your father being aliue had not much and that vnto your Mother, beeing a widow many things wanted. And remember that your father bequeathed you nothing but weapons, and knowe that from mee you ſhalll enherite nothing but Bookes. For I had rather leaue my Children good doctrine, whereby they may liue, then euill Riches whereby they may periſh.
                           I am not rich, nor I neuer trauelled to bee rich: and the cauſe was, that I ſaw many mens children vndone, only through the hope they had to inherit their parents goods, and afterward went a hunting after vices. For they ſeldome times do any worthy feates, which in theyr Youth inherite great Treaſures.
                           This thing therefore beeing true (as it is indeede) I doe not ſay onely that I would watch, and toyle as many do to get riches and treaſures: but alſo if I had treaſor, before I would giue them vnto you, I would (as the Phyloſopher did) caſt them into the fire. For I had rather haue my children poore and vertuous in Affricke, then rich and vicious in Rome.
                           
                           You knowe very well my Children, that there was among the Tharentines a Law well obſerued, that the Sonnes ſhould not inherit any thing of the fathers but weapons to fight: and that A Law among the Tharentines. the Daughters ſhould inherite the goods, for to marry thēſelues withall.
                           Truely this Law was very iuſt: for the Sonne that hath alwaies reſpect to the inheritance: will not haue to his Father any great confidence. For hee ought to bee called a valiant Romain Knight, that with his life hath wonne and by his ſword hath gotten Riches. Since you are in ſtraunge Realmes, I pray you heartily that you be eonuerſant with the good (as good brethren) remembring alwayes, that you were my children, and that I gaue you both ſucke of mine owne proper breaſts. And the day that I ſhall heare of your diſagreement, the ſame day ſhall be the end of my life. For the diſcord in one city of parents doth more harme then a whole armie of enemies.
                           It is good for you (my Children,) to liue in loue and concord together: but it is more requiſite to keepe you with the Romain knights. The which with you, and you with them, if you doe not loue together in the warres, you ſhall neuer haue the vpper hand of your enemies. For in great Armies, the diſcords that ariſe amongſt them, do more harme, then the enemies do againſt whom they fight.
                           I thinke well (my children) that you would be very deſirous to know of my eſtate (that is to ſay,) whether I am in health, whether I am ſicke, whether I am poore, whether I am pleaſed, or whether I am diſcontented?
                           In this caſe I knowe not why you ſhould deſire to knowe it? ſince you ought to preſuppoſe, that according to the troubles which I haue paſſed, &amp; the miſeries, which with mine eyes I haue ſeen, I am filled with this world: For wiſe men after fifty yeares and vpwardes, ought rather to applie theyr mindes how to receyue death: then How euery man &amp; women ought to ſpend their time. to ſeeke for pleaſures how to prolong life.
                           When mans Fleſh is weake, it alwayes deſireth to bee well kept, euen vnto the graue. And as I am of fleſh and Bone, ſo I do feele the troubles of the world, as all mortall men doe. But for all this doe not thinke that to bee poore or ſicke is the greateſt miſerie: neither thinke that to bee whole and rich is the chiefeſt felicity: for there is none other felicitie of the old fathers, but for to ſee their children vertuous.
                           In my opinion it is an honor to the coūtry, that the fathers haue ſuch children, which will take profit with their

counſell, and contrariwiſe that the children haue ſuch fathers which can giue it them: For the childe is happy that hath a wiſe father, and more happie is the father that hath not a fooliſh ſon. I doe write oft times vnto you my children, but there is a law that none be ſo hardy to write to men of war in the field, except firſt they inrowle the letters in the Senate. Therefore ſince I write vnto you more letters then they would, they do ſend leſſe then I deſire. Though this law be painefull to mothers which haue children: yet we muſt confeſſe it is profitable for the weale publike. For if a man wold write to one in the warre that his family is not well; he would forſake the warres to remedy it. If a man write vnto him that it is proſperous, hee hath then a deſire to enioy it.
                           Be not diſpleaſed (my children) though all the Letters I doe ſend vnto you come not to your hands: for all that I doe not ceaſe to viſite the temples for your owne health, nor yet to offer ſacrifices for your honor, If we doe pleaſe the Gods we haue not cauſe to feare our enemies. I ſay no more in this caſe, my children, but but that I beſeech the immortall gods, that if your liues may profit the Common wealth, then they ſhorten my dayes, and lengthen your yeares: but if your liues ſhould be to the damage of the Common wealth, then thoſe immortall gods I deſire, that firſt I may vnderſtand the end of your dayes before that the Wormes ſhould eate my fleſh. For rather then by your euill life the glory of our predeceſſors ſhould bee blemiſhed, it were much better both your liues were ended.
                           
                              The grace of the Gods, the good renowne amongſt men, the good fortune of the Romanes, the wiſedome of the Greekes, the bleſsing of Scipio, and of all other your predeceſſors be alwayes with you my children.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXII. Of the education and doctrine of children whiles they are young. wherein the Author declareth many notable hiſtories.
                     
                     
                        AL mortall mē which What a good traueller in this worlde ought to ſeeke for. will trauel, and ſee good fruits of their trauell, ought to doe as the chiefe Artificer did the painted world: For the man that maketh God the head of his workes, it is vnpoſſible that he ſhould erre in the ſame: That which we beleeue, and reade by writing, is that the eternal created the world in ſhort ſpace by his might: but preſerued it a long time by his wiſedome. Whereof a man may gather, that the time to doe a thing is ſhort: but the care and thought to preſerue it, is long.
                     Wee ſee dayly, that a valiant captaine aſſaulteth his enemies: but in the end it is God that giueth the victory; but let vs aske the Conquerour, what trauell it hath beene vnto him, or wherein hee hath perceiued moſt danger (that is to ſay) either to obtain the victory of his enemies, or elſe to preſerue themſelues amongſt the enuious and malitious. I ſweare and affirme, that ſuch a knight will ſweare that there is no compariſon between the one and the other: for by the bloudy ſword in an houre the victory is obtained: but to keep it with reputation, the ſwet of al the life is required. Laertius in the book of the life of Phyloſophers declareth, and Plato alſo hereof maketh mention, in the bookes of his common wealth, that

thoſe of Thebes vnderſtanding that the Lacedemonians had good lawes, (for the which they were of the Gods fauoured, and of men greatly honoured) determined to ſend (by common aſſent and agreement) a wiſe Philoſopher, the beſt eſteemed amongſt them, whoſe name was Phetonius, to whom they commaunded, that hee ſhould aske the lawes of the Lacedemonians, and that he ſhould be very circumſpect, and warie to ſee, what their rules and cuſtomes were. Thoſe of Thebes were thē very noble, valiant and honeſt: ſo that their principall end was, to come to honour &amp; renowne, to erect buildings, and to make themſelues of immortall memory for being vertuous: For in building they were very curious: and for vertues they had good Phyloſophers.
                     The Philoſopher Phetonius was more then a yeare in the realme of the Lacedemonians, beholding at ſundry times all thinges therein: for ſimple men doe not note things, but onely to ſatisfie the eyes: but the wiſe mē beholdeth them, for to know and vnderſtand their ſecrets. After the Philoſopher had well and plainely ſeene and beheld all the things of the Lacedemouians, he determined to returne home to Thebes, and beeing arriued, all the people came to ſee him and heare him: For the vanity of the common people is of ſuch a qualitie, that it followeth new inuentions, and deſpiſeth auncient Cuſtomes. The vanity and fooliſh opinion of the commō people.
                     
                     All the people therefore gathered together, the good Philoſopher Phetonius ſet vp in the middeſt of the market place a gibbet, hote yrons, a ſword, a whippe, and fetters for the feet; the which thing done, the Thebians were no leſſe, as they thought, ſlaundered then abaſhed.
                     To the which hee ſpake theſe wordes. You Thebaines ſent mee to the Lacedemonians, to the entent that I 
                        The Philoſopher Phetonius his anſwere to the Thebaines. 
                        ſhould learne their Lawes and Cuſtoms. and indeed I haue been there more then a year, behelding all things very diligently: For wee Philoſophers are bounde, not onely to note that which is done, but alſo to know why it is done, Know yee Thebians that this is the aunſwere of my Ambaſſage.
                     
                     
                        That the Lacedemoniant hang vpon this Gibet theeues, with this ſame ſword they beheade Traytors, with theſe hote Irons they torment blaſphemers and lyers, with theſe roddes they whp vacabonds, and with theſe Irons doe keepe the rebels, and the others are for Players and vnthrifts.
                     
                     
                        Finally, I ſay, that I do not bring you the Lawes written, but I bring you the inſtruments wherewith they are obſerued.
                     
                     The Thebanes were abaſhed to ſee theſe things, and ſpake vnto him ſuch words:
                     
                        Conſider Phetonius, we haue not ſent thee to the Lacedemonians, to bring Inſtruments to take away life: but for the good Lawes to gouerne the Common wealth.
                     
                     The Philoſopher Phetonius reply ed againe, and anſwered:
                     Thebains, I let you to vnderſtand, that if you know what wee Philoſophers knew, yon ſhould ſee how farre your mindes were from the truth: For the Lacedemonians are not ſo vertuous, thorough the lawes which were made of them that bee dead, as for the means they haue ſought to preſerue them that bee aliue: For the matters of iuſtice conſiſts more in execution, then in commanding or ordayning.
                     
                     
                        Laws are eaſily ordayned, but with difficulty executed: for there are a thouſand to make them, but to put them in execution there is not one. Full little is that which men know that are preſent in reſpect of that thoſe know which are
                        
                        paſt. But yet according to my little knowledge, I proffer to giue as good lawes to you Thebaines, as euer were obſerued among the Lacedemonians: For there is nothing more eaſie, then to know the good, and nothing more common then to follow the euill: But what profiteth it, if one will ordaine, and none vnderſtand it: If there bee that dooth vnderſtand them, there is none that executeth them. If there bee that executeth them, there is none that obſerueth them: If there bee one that obſerueth them, there is a thouſand that reprooueth them: For without compariſon, more are they that murmur and grudge at the good, then thoſe which deſpiſe and blame the euill. You Thebaines are offended, becauſe I haue brought ſuch Inſtruments, but I let you know, if you will haue neyther gybet nor Sworde to keepe that which ſhall bee ordained, you ſhall haue your Bookes full of lawes, and the common wealth full of vices. Wherefore I ſweare vnto you, that there are more Thebaines which follow the delitiouſneſſe of Denis the tyrant, then there are vertuous men that follow the lawes of Lycurgus.
                     
                        If you Thebaines doe deſire greatly to know, with what lawes the Lacedemonians doe preſerue their Commonwealth: I will tell you them all by word, and if you will reade them, I will ſhew you them in writing: but it ſhall bee vpon condition, that you ſhall ſweare al openly, that once a day you ſhall employ your eyes to reade them, and your perſons to obſerue them: for the Prince hath greater honour to ſee one onely law to be obſerued in deed, then to ordaine a thouſand by writing.
                     
                     
                        You ought not to eſteeme much to be vertuous in heart, nor to enquire of the vertue by the mouth, nor to ſeeke it by labour and trauell of the feet: but that which you ought greatly to eſteeme, is to know what a vertuous law meaneth, and that knowne, immediately to execute it, and afterwards to keepe it.
                     
                     
                        For the chiefe vertue is not to doe one vertuous worke, but in a ſwet and trauell to continue in it.
                     
                     Theſe therfore were the words that this Philoſopher Phetonius ſayde to the Thebaines: the which as Plato ſayeth, eſteemed more his words that hee ſpake, then they did the Lawes which he brought. The Philoſophers counſell acceptable to the Thebanes.
                     
                     Truly in mine opinion, thoſe of Thebes are to bee prayſed and commended: and the Philoſopher for his word is worthy to be honoured. For the ende of thoſe was to ſearch lawes to liue well, and the end of the Philoſopher was to ſeeke good meanes for to keepe them in vertue. And therefore he thoght it good to ſhew them and put before their eyes the gibbet, and the ſword, with the other Inſtruments and torments: for the euill do refraine from vice, more for feare of puniſhment, then for any deſire they haue of amendment.
                     I was willing to bring in this hiſtory, to the end that all curious and vertuous men may ſee and know how little the Ancients did eſteeme the beginning, the meane, and the end of vertuous works, in reſpect of the perſeuerance and preſeruation of them.
                     Comming therefore to my matter, which my penne doth toſſe and ſeeke: I aske now preſently, what it profiteth Princeſſes and great Ladies that God doe giue them great eſtates, that they be fortunate in marriages, that they bee all reuerenced and honoured, that they haue great treaſures for their inheritances, and aboue all, that they ſee their wines great with Childe, and that afterward, in ioy they ſee them deliuered: that they ſee their mothers giuing their children ſucke: and finally, they ſee themſelues happy in that they haue found them good nurſes, health full and honeſt.
                     
                        
Truly all this auayleth little, if to their children when they are young they doe do not giue maſters to inſtruct them in vertues: and they alſo if they doe not recommend them to good guides, to exerciſe them in feates of Chiualry.
                     The Fathers which by ſighes penetrate the heauen, by praiers importune the liuing God onelie for to haue children, ought firſt to thinke why they will haue children: for that iuſtly to a man may be denied, which to an euill end is procured. In mine opinion, the Father ought to deſire to haue a child, for that in his age he may ſuſtaine his life in honour, and that after his death hee may cauſe his fame to liue. And if a Father deſireth not a ſonne for this cauſe, at the leaſt he ought to deſire him, to the end in his age hee may honour his hoary head: and that after his death hee may enherite his goods: but we ſee few children do theſe thinges to their fathers in their age, if the fathers haue not taught them in their youth: For the fruit doth neuer grow in the harueſt, vnleſſe the tree did beare bloſoms in the ſpring.
                     I ſee oftentimes many Fathers complaine of their children, ſaying that they are diſobedient and proude vnto them; and they do not conſider that they themſelues are the cauſe of all thoſe euils. For too much abundance and liberty of youth is no other, but a propheſie and manifeſt token of diſobedience in age. I know not why Princes and great Lords do toyle, &amp; oppreſſe ſo much, &amp; ſcratch to leaue their children great eſtates, and on the other ſide wee ſee that in teaching them, they are and ſhewe themſelues too negligent: for Princes and great Lordes ought to make account, that all that which they leaue of their ſubſtance to a wicked heyre is vtterly loſt.
                     The wiſe men, and thoſe which in their conſciences are vpright, and of their honours carefull, ought to bee very diligent to bring vppe their children, and chiefly that they conſider whether they bee meete to inherite their eſtates. And if perchance the fathers ſee that their children bee more giuen to folly then to noblenes and wiſdome; then ſhould I bee aſhamed to ſee a father that is wiſe, trauell all the dayes of his life, to leaue much ſubſtance to an euill brought vp childe after his death.
                     It is a griefe to declare, and a monſtrous thing to ſee the cates which the Fathers take to gather riches, and the diligence that children haue to ſpend them. And in this caſe I ſay, the ſonne is fortunate for that hee doth enherite, and the Father a foole for that he doth bequeath.
                     In my opinion, Fathers are bound to inſtruct their children well for two cauſes, the one for that they are neareſt The reaſon why parents are bound to inſtruct then children. to them, and alſo becauſe they ought to be their heyres: For truly with great griefe and ſorrow I ſuppoſe hee doth take his death, which leaueth to a foole or an vnthrift the toyle of all his life.
                     
                        Hyzearchus the Greeke Hyſtorian in the booke of his Antiquities, &amp; Sabellicus in his generall hyſtory ſayeth, that a father and a ſonne came to complain to the famous Philoſopher and ancient Solon Solinon: the Sonne complained of the father, and the father of the ſonne.
                     Firſt, the ſonne informed the quarrell to the Philoſopher, ſaying theſe words. I complaine of my Father, becauſe hee being rich hath diſinherited mee, and made me poore, and in my ſteade hath adopted another heyre, the which thing my father ought not, nor cannot doe: for ſince he gaue me ſo frayle fleſh, it is reaſon hee giue me his goods to maintaine

my ſeeblenes.
                     To theſe wordes anſwered the father: I complaine of my ſonne, becauſe hee hath not beene as a gentle ſonne, but rather as a cruell enemie: for in all things ſince hee was borne, hee hath beene diſobedient to my will, wherefore I thought it good to diſinherite him before my death. I would I were quit of all my ſubſtance ſo that the gods had quit him of his life: for the earth is very cruell that ſwalloweth not the child aliue, which to his father is diſobedient. In that he ſayeth, I haue adopted another child for mine heyre, I confeſſe it is true: and for ſo much as hee ſayeth, that I haue diſinherited him, and abiected him from my heritage, hee beeing begotten of my body, hereunto I anſwere.
                     That I haue not diſinherited my ſonne, but I haue diſinherited his pleaſure, to the entent hee ſhall not enioy my trauell: for there can bee nothing more vniuſt, then that the young and vicious ſonne ſhould take his pleaſure of the ſwet and droppes of the aged father.
                     The ſonne replyed to his Father How childrē ought to bee brought vp. and ſayde I confeſſe I haue offended my Father, and alſo I confeſſe, that I haue liued in pleaſures: yet if I may ſpeake the truth, though I were diſobedient and euill, my Father ought to beare the blame: and if for this cauſe hee doeth diſhenherite mee, I thinke hee doth me great iniurie: for the father that inſtructeth not his ſon in vertue in his youth, wrongfully diſinheriteth him, though he be diſobedient in his age.
                     The Father againe replyeth, and ſayeth. It is true my ſonne, that I brought thee vp too wantonly in thy youth, but thou knoweſt well that I haue taught thee ſundry times, and beſides that I did correct thee when thou cameſt to ſome diſcretion.
                     And if in thy youth I did not inſtruct thee in learning: it was for that thou in thy tender age diddeſt want vnderſtanding, but after that thou hadſt age to vnderſtand, diſcretion to receyue, and ſtrength to exerciſe it; I beganne to puniſh thee, to teache thee, and to inſtruct thee. For where no vnderſtanding is in the child, there in vaine they teach doctrine.
                     Since thou art old (quoth the ſonne) and I young: ſince thou art my Father, and I thy ſonne: for that thou haſt white hayres on thy beard, and I none at all: it is but reaſon that thou be belieued, and I condemned. For in this world wee ſee oft times, that the ſmall authoritie of the perſon, maketh him to looſe his great iuſtice.
                     I graunt thee (my Father) that when What miſchiefe commeth by giuing childrē their owne will in their youth. I was a childe, thou diddeſt cauſe mee to learne to reade: but thou wilt not denie, that if I did commit any faulte, thou wouldſt neuer agree I ſhould be puniſhed. And hereof it came, that thou ſuffering me to do what I would in my Youth, haue bin diſobedient to thee euer ſince in my age. And I ſay vnto thee further, that if in this caſe I haue offended, truely mee thinketh thou canſt not bee excuſed: for the fathers in the youth of their children, ought not onely to teach them to diſpute of vertues, &amp; what vertue is: but they ought to inforce thē to be vertuous in deed. For it is a good token, when Youth (before they knowe vices) haue been accuſtomed to practiſe vertues.
                     Both partyes then diligently heard the good Phyloſopher Solon Solinon ſpeake theſe words: I giue iudgement that the Father of this childe be not buryed after his death: and I commaund that the Sonne, becauſe in his youth, hee hath (not obeyed his Father who is olde) ſhould be diſinherited whileſt the Father liueth, from all his ſubſtance, on ſuch condition, that after his death, his ſonnes
                        
                        ſhould inherite the Heritage: and ſo returne to the heyres of the Sonne, and liue of the Father. For it were vniuſt, that the innocencie of the Sonne ſhould be condemned for the offence of the Father.
                     
                     
                        I do commaund alſo, that all the goods be committed vnto ſome faithfull perſon, to the end they may giue the Father meat and drinke during his life: and to make a graue for the Sonne after his death:
                     
                     
                        I haue not without a cauſe giuen ſuch iudgement, the which comprehendeth life and death: For the Gods will not that for one pleaſure the puniſhment bee double, but that wee chaſtiſe and puniſh the one in the life, taking from him his honour and goods, and that wee puniſh others after their death, taking from them memorie and buryall.
                     
                     Truely the ſentence which the Philoſopher gaue, was very graue: and would to GOD wee had him for a iudge of this world preſently. For I ſweare, that hee ſhould finde manie Children now a dayes for to diſinherite, and moe Fathers to puniſh. For, I cannot tell which is greater: The ſhame of the children to diſobey their Fathers, or the negligence of the Fathers in bringing vp their children.
                     
                        Sextus Cheronenſ. in the ſecond book of the ſayings of the Philoſophers declareth, that a Citizen of Athens ſaide vnto Dyogenes the Phyloſopher, theſe wordes.
                     Tell mee Dyogenes: What ſhall I doe, to be in the fauour of the Gods, and not in the hatred of men? For, oft times amongſt you Phyloſophers I haue hearde ſay, that there is a great Queſtions demaunded of Dyogenes the Phyloſopher. difference between that that the gods will, and that which men loue.
                     
                        Dyogenes anſwered: Thou ſpeakeſt more then thou oughteſt to ſpeake, that the Gods will one thing, and men another: for the Gods are but as a center of mercy, and men are but as a denne of malice, if thou wilt enioy reſt in thy dayes, and keepe thy life pure and cleane: thou muſt obſerue theſe three things. 2. Things to be obſerued of all men.
                     
                     The firſt, honour thy Gods deuoutely: for the man which doeth not ſerue and honour the Gods, in all his enterpriſes hee ſhall be vnfortunate.
                     The ſecond, bee very diligent to bring vp thy children well: for the man hath no enemie ſo troubleſome, as his owne ſonne, if hee bee not well brought vp.
                     The third thing bee thankefull to thy good benefactors and friends, for the Oracle of Apollo ſayth, that the man who is vnthankefull, of all the world ſhall be abhorred.
                     And I tell thee further, my friend, that of theſe three things the moſt profitable (though it be more troubleſome) is for a man to teach, and bring vp his children well.
                     This therefore was the anſwere that the Philoſopher Diogenes made to the demaund of the Citizen. It is great pitty and griefe to ſee a young childe how the bloud doth ſtirre him to ſee how the fleſh doth prouoke him to accompliſh his deſire, to ſee ſenſuality goe before, and he himſelfe to come behind, to ſee the malitious World to watch him; to ſee how the Diuell doth tempte him, to ſee how vices binde him, and in all that which is ſpoken, to ſee how the Father is negligent, as if hee had no children; whereas in deede the olde man, by the fewe vertues he hath had in his Youth: may eaſily knowe the infirmityes and vices, wherewith his Sonne is incompaſſed.
                     If the expert had neuer beene ignorant: if the Fathers had neuer beene children: if the vertuous had neuer been vicious: if the fine wittes had neuer been deceiued: it were no maruell if the Fathers were negligent in teaching their children. For the little experience excuſeth men of great

offences: but ſince thou art my Father, and that firſt thou wert a Sonne, ſince thou art old, and haſt bin young, and beſides all this, ſince that pride hath inflamed thee, lechery hath burned thee, wrath hath wounded thee, Negligence hath hindred thee, Couetouſnes hath blinded thee, &amp; Glotonie ſurfetted thee: Tell mee cruell Father, ſince ſo many vices haue reigned in thee; why haſt thou not an eye to thy childe whom of thy own bloud thou haſt begotten? And if thou doeſt it not becauſe he is thy childe, thou oughteſt to doe it, becauſe hee is thy neereſt. For it is vnpoſſible that the child which with many vices is aſſaulted and not ſuccoured, but in the ende hee ſhould be infamed, and to the diſhonour of the father moſt wickedly ouercome.
                     It is vnpoſſible to keepe Fleſh well ſauoured, vnleſſe it bee firſt ſalted. It What comfort parents may looke for of their children. is vnpoſſible that the Fiſh ſhould liue without water. It is vnpoſſible but that the Roſe ſhould wither, which is of the thorne ouergrowne. So like it is vnpoſſible that the Fathers ſhould haue any comfort of their children in their age, vnleſſe they haue inſtructed them in vertue in their youth.
                     And to ſpeake further in this matter (I ſay) that in the Chriſtian catholike Religion, where in deede there is good doctrine, there alwaies is ſuppoſed to bee a good conſcience.
                     Amongſt the Writers it is a thing well knowne, how Eſchines the Phyloſopher was baniſhed from Athens, and with all his familie came to dwell at Rhodes: The occaſion was, becauſe that hee and the Phyloſopher Demoſthenes were in great contention in the common-wealth. Wherefore the Atheniās determined to baniſh the one, and to keepe the other with them.
                     And truely they did well: for of the contentions and debates of Sages, Warres moſte commonly ariſe amongſt the people.
                     This Phyloſopher Eſchines being at Rhodes baniſhed, amōgſt others made a ſolemne Oration, wherin he greatly reproued the Rhodians, that they were ſo negligent in bringing vp their children, ſaying vnto them theſe words: I let you vnderſtand (lords of Rhodes) that your Predeceſſours aduaunced themſelues to deſcend, and take theyr beginning of the Lides: the which aboue all other Nations, were curious and diligent to bring vp theyr Children: and hereof came came a Law that was among them, which ſaide:
                     Wee ordeine and commaund, that if a Father haue many Children, that the moſt vertuous ſhould inherite the goods and riches: and if there were but one vertuous, that he alone ſhold inherit the whole. And if perchance Ordinances and cuſtomes of the Rhodians. the Children were vicious, that then all ſhould be depriued from the heritage. For the goods gottē with trauell of vertuous Fathers, ought not by reaſon to be inherited by vicious childrē.
                     Theſe were the wordes that the Philoſopher ſpake to the Senate of the Rhodes, and becauſe he ſayde in that oratiō many other things which touch not our matter, I will in this place omit them: For among excellēt Writers, that writing loſeth much authority, when the Author from his purpoſe digreſſeth into an other matter. To ſay the truth, I doe not maruell that the children of Princes and great Lords be adulterers and bellygods: for that on the one part youth is the mother of idleneſſe, and on the other, little experience is the cauſe of great offences.
                     And furthermore, the fathers being once dead, the children enherite their goods as quietly, being loden with vices: as if in deed they were with all vertues endued. If the young children did know for a certaine that the lawes of the Lydes
                        
ſhould be obſerued (that is to ſay) that they ſhould not inherite, vnleſſe they be vertuous: it is vnpoſſible but that they would leade a vertuous life, and not in this wiſe to run at large in the worlde. For they doe abſtaine more from doing euill, fearing to loſe that which they doe poſſeſſe, then for anie loue to doe that which they ought.
                     I do not denie, but according as the natures of the Fathers is diuers, ſo the inclination of the children is variable. For ſo much as ſome following theyr good inclinations, are good: and others, not reſiſting euill ſenſualities, are euill.
                     But yet in this matter I ſay, that it lyeth much in the Father that doeth bring them vp, when as yet they are young: ſo that the euill which nature gaue, by good bringing vp is refrayned. For oft times the good cuſtome doth ouercome all euill inclination.
                     Princes and great Lordes that will be diligent in the inſtruction of theyr children, ought to enforme their maiſters and tutors that ſhall teach them, to what vices and vertues their Children are moſte inclined: And this ought to bee, to encourage them in that that is good, and contrarie, to reproue them in all that is euill. For, What youth ought to obſtaine from. men are vndone for none other cauſe when they be olde: but for that they had ſo much pleaſure when they were young.
                     
                        Sextus Cheronenſis, in the ſecond booke of the auncients ſaith: that on a day, a cittizen of Athenes was buying things in the market, and for the qualitie of his perſon, the greateſt parte of them were ſuperfluous, and nothing neceſſarie. And in this caſe the poore are no leſſe culpable then the rich, and the riche then the poore. For that is ſo little, that to ſuſtaine manslife is neceſſarie, that he which hath leaſt, hath therevnto ſuperfluous. Therefore at this time, when Athens and her common-wealth was the Lanterne of all Greece, there was in Athens a Law long vſed, and of a great time accuſtomed, that nothing ſhould be bought before a Philoſopher had ſet the price. And A Lawe among the Athenians. truly the law was good, and would to God the ſame law were at this preſent obſerued: For, there is nothing that deſtroieth a commonwealth more, then to permit ſome to ſell as tyrantes, and others to buye as fooles. When the Theban was buying theſe things, a philoſopher was preſent, who ſaide vnto him theſe words. Tell me, I pray thee, thou man of Thebes, Wherefore doeſt thou conſume and waſt thy money in that which is not neceſſarie for thy houſe, nor profitable for thy perſon? The Thebane anſwered him.
                     I let thee knowe, that I doe buye all theſe things for a ſonne I haue of the age of xx. yeares: the which neuer did any thing that ſeemed vnto mee euil, nor I neuer denyed him any thing, that hee demaunded. This Philoſoſopher anſwered;
                     Oh how happy wert thou, if as thou art a Father, thou wert a ſonne? and that which the Father ſaieth vnto the ſonne, the ſonne would ſay vnto the father: but I am offended greatly with that thou haſt told me. For vntill the childe be xxv. yeares old, he ought not to gaineſay his father, and the good father ought not to condiſcend vnto the appetites of the ſonne.
                     Now I may call thee curſed father, ſince thou arte become ſubject to the will of thy ſonne: and that thy ſonne is not obedient to the will of his Father, ſo that thou altereſt the order of nature: For ſo much as the father is become ſonne of his ſonne, and the ſonne is become father of his father. But in the ende, I ſweare vnto thee, by the immortall Gods, that when thou ſhalt become old and aged, thou ſhalt lament and weepe by thy ſelfe, at that which with thy Sonne thou

diddeſt laugh, when he was young.
                     Though the words of this Phyloſopher were fewe: yet a wiſe man will iudge the ſentences to be manie.
                     I conclude therfore that Princes and great Lordes ought to recommend their children to their Maiſters, to the ende they may teache them to change their appetites, and not to follow their owne will: ſo that they withdrawe them from their owne will, and cauſe them to learne the aduiſe of another. For the more a man giueth a Noble mans ſonne the bridle, the more harder it is for them to receyue good doctrine.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXIII. Princes ought to take heede that theyr Children bee not brought vp in pleaſures and vayne delightes. For ofte times they are ſo wicked, that the Fathers would not onely haue them with ſharpe diſcipline corrected: but alſo with bitter teares buryed.
                     
                     
                        BY experience we ſee that in Warre (for the defence of men) Rampiers and Forts are made according to the qualitie of the enemyes: and thoſe which ſaile the daungerous Seas, doe chuſe great Ships, which may breake the waues of the raging Seas: So that all wiſe men, according to the quality of the danger, doe ſeeke for the ſame in time ſome remedie.
                     Ofte times I muſe with my ſelfe, and thinke if I could finde anie eſtate, anie age, anie Land, anie Nation, anie Realme, or any World, wherein there hath beene any man that hath paſſed The miſerable eſtate of man. this life, without taſting, what aduerſitie was? For, if ſuch an one were found, I thinke it ſhould bee a monſtrous thing throughout all the earth, and by reaſon both the deade and liuing ſhould enuie him.
                     In the ende, after my count made, I find that he which but yeſterday was rich, to day is poore: hee that was whole, I ſee him to day ſicke: he that yeſterday laughed, to day I ſee him weepe: he that had his hearts eaſe, I ſee him now ſore afflicted: hee that was Fortunate, now I ſee him vnluckie. Finally, him whome lately we knew aliue in the towne, now wee ſee buryed in the graue: And to be buryed, is nothing elſe but to be vtterly forgotten: For, mans friendſhip is ſo fraile, that when the Corps is couered with earth, immediatly the dead is forgotten.
                     One thing me thinketh to all men is grieuous, and to thoſe of vnderſtandng no leſſe painfull: which is, that the miſeries of this wicked world are not equally deuided; but that oft times all worldly calamityes lyeth in the necke of one man alone. For we are ſo vnfortunate, that the worlde giueth vs pleaſures in ſight, and troubles in proofe.
                     If a man ſhould aske a Sage man now a daies, who hath liued in meane eſtate, and that hee would bee contented to tell him what hee hath paſt, ſince three yeares that he beganne to ſpeake, vntill fiftie yeares that hee began to waxe olde: what things thinke you he would telvs, that hath chanced vnto him? truely all theſe that follow.
                     The griefes of his Children, the aſſaults of his enemyes, the importunities of his wife, the wantonnes of his What miſfortunes are incident to man in this life. daughters, ſicknes in his perſon, great loſſe of goods, generall famine in the citie, cruel plagues in his countrey, extreame colde in winter, noyſom heate in Summer, ſorrowfull deaths of his friendes: and enuious proſperities of his enemyes. Finally, hee will ſay, that hee paſſed ſuch, and ſo manie things, that oft times he bewailed the

woful life, and deſired the ſweet death.
                     If the miſerable man hath paſſed ſuch things outwardly, what would he ſay of thoſe which he hath ſuffered inwardly? the which though ſome diſcrete men may know, yet truly others dare not tell. For the trauells which the bodie paſſeth in 50. yeares, may well bee counted in a day: but that which the heart ſuffereth in one day, cānot be counted in a hundred yeres. A man cannot denie, but that wee would count him raſh, which with a reede would meet another that hath a ſword: and him for a foole, that wold put off his ſhooes to walke vpon the Thornes. But without compariſon, we ought to eſteeme him for the moſt foole, that with his tender fleſh thinketh to preuaile againſt ſo manie euill fortunes: for, without doubt, the man that is of his body delicate, paſſeth his life with much paine.
                     Oh how happie may that man bee called, which neuer taſted what pleaſure meaneth. For men which from their infancie haue bin brought vp in pleaſures, for want of wiſedome know Men ought to flie the pleaſures &amp; vanities of this life. not how to chuſe the good, and for lacke of force cannot reſiſt the euill: which is the cauſe, that Noble-mens children oft times commit ſundry heinous offences. For it is an infallible rule, that the more a man giueth himſelfe to pleaſures, the more he is intangled in vices.
                     It is a thing worthie to be noted, and woefull to ſee, how polliticke we be to augment things of honour, how bolde we be to enterprize them: how fortunate to compaſſe them: how diligent to keepe them: how circumſpect to ſuſtaine them: and afterward what pittie it is to ſee, how vnfortunate we are to looſe all that, which ſo long time we haue ſearched for, kept, and poſſeſſed. And that which is moſt to bee lamented in this caſe is, that the goods and Honours are not loſt for want of diligence and trauell of the father, but for the aboundance of pleaſures and vices of the ſonne. Finally, let the Riche man knowe, that that which hee hath wonne in labour and toyle waking, his Sonne (beeing euill brought vp) ſhal conſume in pleaſures ſleeping.
                     One of the greateſt vanities that reigneth at this, day amongſt the children of vanitie is, that the Father cannot ſhewe vnto his Sonne the loue which he beareth him, but in ſuffering him to be brought vp in the pleaſures and vanities of this life. Truly, he that is ſuch a one, ought not to be called a pittifull father, but a cruell ſtep-father: for no man will denie me this, but that where there is Youth, liberty, pleaſure, and Money, there will all the vices of this world be reſident.
                     
                        Lycurgus the great King, giuer of lawes, and ſage Philoſopher, ordained Wholſome and warie lawes of the Lacedemonians. to the Lacedemonians, that all the children which were borne in Citties and good Townes, ſhould bee ſent to be brought vp in villages, till they were xxv. yeares of age. And Liuius ſaith, that the Lygures were, which in olde time were confederates with thoſe of Capua, and great enemyes to the people of Rome,
                     
                     They had a Lawe amongſt them, that none ſhould take wages in the warres, vnleſſe he had bin brought vp in the fields, or that he had bin a heard man in the Moūtains: ſo that through one of theſe two waies, their fleſh was hardned, their joyntes accuſtomed to ſuffer the heate and the cold, and their bodies more meete to endure the trauells of the warres. In the yeare of the foundation of Rome 140. the Romalnes made cruell warres with the Lygures, againſt whome was ſent Gneus Fabritius: of the which in the end he triumphed; and the day following this triumph, hee ſpake vnto the Senate, in theſe words. Worthie Senatours,

I haue beene theſe fiue yeares againſt the Ligures, and by the immortall Gods I ſweare vnto you, that in all this time there paſſed not one weeke but wee had eyther battell or ſome perillous skirmiſh. And that which The ſpeech of 
                              〈…〉
                            concerning the profeſſe of the Lygures a man ought moſt to maruell at is, that I neuer perceyued any feare or cowardlineſſe to bee in thoſe barbarous people, whereby they were conſtrained to demaund peace of the people of Rome.
                     Theſe Lygures purſued with ſuch fierceneſſe the wars, that often times they tooke away from vs all hope to winne the victory: for betweene Armies, the great might of the one, doth put alwayes the others in feare. And I wil tell you (Fathers conſcript,) their bringing vp, to the ende the Romaine youth ſhould take heereby example.
                     When they are young, they are put to bee Sheapheardes, becauſe they ſhould accuſtome their fleſh in thoſe mountaines to endure trauell: by the which cuſtome they are ſo much maſters of themſelues (the countrey being alwayes full of ſnow and Iſe in the winter, and alſo noyſom through the extreame heate in the Summer) that I ſweare by the God Apollo, in all this time of fiue yeares, of thoſe wee haue not ſeene one preaſe to the Fire in the winter, nor couet the ſhadow in the Summer.
                     Doe not yee thinke worthie Senators, that I was willing to declare vnto you theſe things in the Senate, for any deſire I haue, that you ſhould eſteeme any thing the more my Triumph: but I doe tell it you to this ende, that you may haue an eye, and take heede to your men of warre, to the ende they may alwayes be occupied, and that you ſuffer them not to be idle. For it is more perillous for the Romaine Armyes to bee ouercome with vices, thē to be diſcomfited with their enemies.
                     And to talke of theſe matters more at large, me thinketh they ſhould prouide and commaund, that Rich men ſhould not be ſo hardie to bring vppe their children too delicately: for in the ende, it is vnpoſſible that the delicate perſon ſhould win with his hands the honour of many victories.
                     That which moued me to ſay ſomuch as I haue ſayd (worthie Senatours) is to the ende you may knowe, that the Lygures were not ouercome by the power of Rome: but becauſe Fortune was againſt them. And ſince in nothing Fortune ſheweth her ſelfe ſo variable, as in the things of the warre: mee thinketh that though the Ligures are nowe vanquiſhed and ouercome, yet notwithſtanding you ought to entertain them in loue: and to take them for your confoederates: For it is not good counſell, to hazzard that into the handes of Fortune, which a man may compaſſe by friendſhip.
                     The Authour of this which is ſpoken, is called Iunius Pratus, in the Booke of the concord of Realmes: and hee ſaieth in that place, that this captaine Gneus Fabritius, was counted no leſſe ſage for that he ſpake, then eſteemed valiant for that hee did.
                     In the olde time, thoſe of the Iſles Balleares, (which now are called Maiorque, and Minorque) though they were not counted wiſe; yet at the leaſt in bringing vp their Children, they ſhewed rhemſelues not negligent.
                     Becauſe they were broght vp in hardnes in their youth, and could endure all painefull exerciſes of the warres. Thoſe of Carthage gaue fiue priſoners of Rome, for one ſlaue of Maiorque.
                     
                     
                        Dyodorus Siculus ſaith, in thoſe Iles, the mother did not giue the children bread with their own hands: but they did put it on a high poale, ſo that they might ſee the Bread with theyr eyes, but they could not reach it with their hāds. Wherfore when they would eat

they ſhould firſt with hurling of ſtones, or ſlinges win it, or elſe faſt. Though the worke were of children, yet the inuention came of a high wit: And hereof it came, that the Baleares were eſteemed for valiant mē, as well in wraſtling, as in ſlinges for to hurle: for they did hurle with a ſling to hit a white, as the Lygures ſhoot now in a Croſſe-bow to hit the pricke. Thoſe of Great Brittaine, which now we cal England, amongſt all the barbarous, were men moſt barbarous: but you ought to know, that within the ſpace of few yeares, the Romanes were vanquiſhed of them many times: for time in all things bringeth ſuch change and alteration, that thoſe which once wee knew great Lords, within a while after wee haue ſeene themſlaues.
                     
                        Herodian in his hiſtory of Seuerus Emperour of Rome ſayeth, That an Ambaſſadour of Brittaine being one day in Rome (as by chance they gaue him a froward anſwer in the Senate) ſpake ſtoutely before them all, and ſaide theſe words. The ſtoute anſwere of the Engliſh Ambaſſadour to the Romanes.
                     
                     I am ſorry you will not accept peace, nor graunt Truce, the which thing ſhall bee for the greater iuſtification of your warre. For afterwardes none can take but that which fortune ſhall giue: For in the end the delicate fleſh of Rome ſhall feele if the bloudy ſwords of Brittaine will cut. The Engliſh hiſtory ſayeth, and it is true, that though the country be very cold &amp; that the water freezeth oft; yet the women had a cuſtome to carry theyr children where the water was frozen, and breaking the Ice with a ſtone, with the ſame Iſe they vſed to rubbe the body of the Infant, to the end to harden their fleſh, and to make them more apter to endure trauels. And without doubt, they had reaſon, for I wiſh no greater pennance to delicate men, then in the Winter to ſee them without fire, and in the Summer to want freſh ſhadow.
                     Sith this was the cuſtome of the Brittaines, it is but reaſon we credite Iulius Caeſar, in that hee ſayeth in his Comentaries, that is to ſay, that he paſſed many daungers before hee could ouercome them: for they with as little feare did hide themſelues, &amp; diued vnder the colde water, as verily a man would haue reſted himſelfe in a pleaſant ſhadow.
                     As Lucanus and Appianus Alexandrinus ſay, amongſt other Nations which came to ſuccour the greate Pompey in Pharſalia, were the Meſſagetes, the which (as they ſay) in their youth did ſuck no other but the milke of Camels, and eate bread of akorns. Theſe barbarous people did theſe things to the end to harden their bodies, to bee able to endure trauell, &amp; to haue their legges lighter for to runne.
                     In this caſe wee cannot cal them barbarous, but wee ought to call them men of good vnderſtanding: for it is vnpoſſible for the man that eateth much to runne faſt. Viriatus a Spaniard, was King of the Luſitaines, and a great enemy of the Romaines, who was ſo aduenturous in the war, and ſo valiant in his perſon, that the Romaines (by the experience of his deedes) found him inuincible: for in the ſpace of 13. yeares they coulde neuer haue any victory of him: the which when they ſaw, they determined The proweſſe of Viriatus, and his vntimely death. to poyſon him, &amp; did ſo indeed. At whoſe death they more reioyced, then if they had wonne the Sgniorie of all Luſitania: For if Viriatus had not dyed, they had neuer brought the Luſitanians vnder their ſubiection. Iunius Ruſticus in his Epitomie ſayeth, that this Viriatus in his youth was a Heard-man, &amp; kept cattell by the riuer of Guadiana, and after that he waxed older, vſed to robbe,

and aſſault men by the high wayes. And after that he was forty yeares of age, he became King of the Luſitaines and not by force, but by election: for when the people ſaw themſelues enuironed and aſſaulted on euery ſide with enemies, they choſe rather ſtout, ſtrong and hardy men for their Captaines, then noble men for their guides.
                     If the ancient Hiſtoriographers deceyue me not, when Viriatus was a thiefe, hee ledde with him alwayes at the leaſt a hundred theeues, the which were ſhod with leaden ſhooes ſo that when they were enforced to runne, they put off their ſhooes. And thus although all the day they went with leaden ſhooes, yet in the night they ranne like ſwift buckes: for it is a generall rule, that the looſer the ioynts are, the more ſwifter ſhall the legges be to runne.
                     In the booke of the ieſts of the Lumbardes, Paulus Diaconus ſayeth, An ancient Law obſerued by the inhabitants of Capua, that in the olde time thoſe of Capua had a Law, that vntill the children were married, the fathers ſhould giue them no bed to ſleepe on, nor permit them to ſit at the table to eate: but that they ſhould eate their meate in their hands; and take their reſt on the ground.
                     And truly it was a commendable law, for reſt was neuer inuēted for the yong man which hath no beard; but for the aged, being lame, impotent and crooked.
                     
                        Quintus Cincinatus was ſecond Dictator of Rome, and indeed for his deſerts was the firſt Emperour of the earth.
                     This excellent man was brought vp in ſo great trauell, that his handes were found full of knots, the plough was in his armes, and the ſwette in his face when hee was ſought for to bee Dictator of Rome. For the Ancients deſired rather to bee ruled of them that knew not, but how to plough the ground; then of them that delighted in nothing elſe, but to liue in pleaſures among the people.
                     
                        Caligula which was the fourth Emperour of Rome (as they ſay) was brought vp with ſuch coſt and delicateneſſe in his his youth, that they were in doubt in Rome, whether Druſius Germanicus his father employed more for the Armies then Caligula his ſonne ſpent in the cradle for his pleaſures.
                     This rehearſed againe, I would now know of Princes and great lords what part they would take, that is to ſay, whether with Cincinatus, which by his ſtootenes wan ſo many ſtrange Countries, or with Caligula, that in his filthy luſts ſpared not his proper ſiſter.
                     In mine opinion, there needeth no great deliberation to aunſwere this queſtion (that is to ſay) the goodneſſe of the one, and the wickedneſſe of the other: for there was no battell but Cincinatus did ouercome, nor there was any vice but Caligula did inuent. Suetonius Tranquillus in the ſecond Booke of Caeſars ſayeth; That when the children of the Emperour Auguſtus Caeſar entred into the high Capitoll, where all the Senate were aſſembled, the Senatours roſe out of their places, and made a reuerence to the children: the which when the Emperour Auguſtus ſaw, hee was much diſpleaſed, and called them backe againe. And on a day beeing demaunded why bee loued his childrē no better, he anſwered in this wiſe. If my children will bee good, they ſhal ſit hereafter where I ſit now: but if they bee euill, I will not their vices ſhould bee reuerenced 
                        The anſwer of the Emperour Auguſtus Caeſar. 
                        of the Senators: For the authoritie and grauitie of the good ought not to bee employed in the ſeruice of thoſe that be wicked.
                     
                     The 26 Emperour of Rome was Alexander, the which though he was

young, was as much eſteemed for his vertues amongſt the Romanes, as euer Alexander the great was, for his valiantnes amongſt the Greekes.
                     Wee cannot ſay, that long experience cauſed him to come to the Gouernment of the common-wealth: for as Herodian ſaieth in his ſixth booke: The day that the Senatours proclaymed him Emperour, hee was ſo little, that his owne men bare him in theyr armes, That fortunate Emperour had a Mother called Manea, the which brought him vp fowel and diligently, that ſhe kept alwayes a great guard of men to take heed, that no vicious man The prouidence of a careful mother. came vnto him. And let not the diligence of the Mother to the childe be little eſteemed. For Princes oft times of their owne nature are good, and by euill conuerſation only, they are made euill. This worthie woman keeping alwayes ſuch a faithfull guarde of her childe, that no Flatterers ſhould enter in to flatter him, nor malicious to tell him lyes: By chaunce on a day a Romane ſaide vnto her theſe wordes.
                     I thinke it not meete (moſt excellent princeſſe) that thou ſhouldeſt be ſo diligent about thy Sonne, to forget the affaires of the commonwealth: for Princes ought not to be kept ſo cloſe, that it is more eaſie to obtaine a ſuite at the Gods, then to ſpeake one word with the Prince. To this the Empreſſe Manea anſwered, and ſaide.
                     They which haue charge to gouerne thoſe which do gouern, without compariſon ought to feare more the vices of the King, then the enemyes of the realme. For the enemyes are deſtroyed in a Battell, but vices remaine during the life: and in the end, enemies doe not deſtroy but the poſſeſſions of the Land, but the vicious prince deſtroieth the good māners of the commonwealth. Theſe words were ſpoken of this worthy Romane. By the Hyſtories which I haue declared, and by thoſe which I omitte to recite, all vertuous men may knowe, how much it profiteth them to bring vppe their children in trauels, or to bring them vp in pleaſures.
                     But now I imagine, that thoſe which ſhall reade this, will prayſe that which is well written: and alſo I truſt they will not giue their childrē ſo much their owne wils: for men that reade much, and worke little, are as belles which doe found to call others, and they themſelues neuer enter into the church. If the fathers did not eſteeme the ſeruice they doe vnto God, their owne honour, nor the profite of their owne children: yet to preſerue them from diſeaſes, they ought to bring them vp in vertue, &amp; withdraw them from vices: for truly the children which haue beene brought vp daintily, ſhall alwayes be diſeaſed and ſickly.
                     What a thing is it to ſee the ſonne of a Labourer, the coate without points, the ſhirt tattered and torne, the feet bare his head without a cap, his body without a girdle, in ſummer without a hat, in winter without a The commendations of the labouring man. cloke, in the day plowing, in the night driuing his heard, eating bread of Rye or Otes, lying on the earth, or elſe on the ſtraw: and in this trauell to ſee this yong man ſo holy and vertuous, that euery man deſireth and wiſheth that hee had ſuch a ſonne. The contrary commeth of Noble mens ſonnes, the which wee ſee are nouriſhed and brought vp betweene two fine Holland ſheetes, layed in a coſtly cradell, made after the new faſhion: they giue the Nurſe what ſhe will deſire; if perchance the child be ſicke, they change his Nurſe, or elſe they appoint him a dyet.
                     The father and the mother ſleepe neyther night nor day, all the houſe watcheth, they let him eate nothing but the broth of chickens, they keepe

him diligently that hee fall not down the ſtayres; the child asketh nothing but it is giuen him immediately. Finally, they ſpend their time in ſeruing them, they waſt their riches in giuing thē their delights, they occupy their eyes but to behold them, and they employ not their hearts but to loue them.
                     But I ſweare that thoſe Fathers, (which on this wiſe doe ſpend their riches to pamper them) ſhall one day water their eyes to bewaile thē: what it is to ſee the waſte, that a vaine man maketh in bringing vp his childe? ſpecially if hee be a man ſomewhat aged, and that at his deſire hath a Childe borne. He ſpendeth ſo much goods, in bringing him vp wantonly, whiles he is young, that oft times he wanteth to marrie him when hee commeth to Age. And that which worſt of all is, that that which hee ſpendeth and employeth; he thinketh it well beſtowed, and thinketh that too much that hee giueth for Gods ſake.
                     Though the Fathers are very large in ſpending, the mothers very curious, and the Nurſes full of pleaſaunt, and the ſeruaunts very diligent and attentiue: yet it followeth not that the children ſhold be more hole then others. For the more they are attended, the more they be diſeaſed: the more they eate, the more they are weake: the more they reioyce, the worſe they proſper: the more they waſte and ſpend, The more tēderly children are brought vp the more diſeaſed they proue. ſo much leſſe they profit. And all this is not without the ſecrete permiſsion of God. For God will not that the clowtes of children be of greater value then the garments of the poore.
                     
                        GOD without a great miſtery tooke not in hand the cuſtody of the poote, and doeth not ſuffer that the children of the rich men ſhould proſper: For the good bringeth vp his childrē with out the preiudice of the Rich, and to the profite of the Common-wealth: but the Rich bringeth vp his children with the ſweate of the poore, and to the dammage of the commonwealth Therefore if this thing be true (as it is) it is but reaſon that the Wolfe which deuoureth vs do die: and the ſheepe which clotheth vs doe liue.
                     The Fathers oft times for tendernes will not teach nor bring vp theyr children in doctrine, ſaying: That as yet hee is too young; and that there remaineth time enough for to bee learned, and that they haue leiſure inough to be taught: And further, for the more excuſe of their errour, they affirme, that when the child in his youth is chaſtned, hee runneth in daunger of his health. But the euill reſpect which the Fathers haue to theyr Children, God ſuffereth afterwardes, that they come to be ſo ſlaunderous to the commonwealth, ſo infamous to theyr Parents, ſo diſobedient to, theyr fathers, ſo euil in their conditions, ſo vnaduiſed and light in theyr behauiour, ſo vnmeete for knowledge, ſo vncorrigible for diſcipline, ſo inclined to lyes, ſo enuying the truth: that their Fathers would not onely haue puniſhed them with ſharpe correction: but alſo they would reioyce to haue them buryed with bitter teares.
                     An other thing there is in this matter worthie to bee noted, and much more worthyer to bee commended, that is: that the Fathers and Mothers vnder the colour that their Children ſhould bee ſomewhat gratious, they learne them to ſpeake, to bable, and to Childrē the diſhonor of their parēts whē they be not well brought vp. bee great mockers and ſcoffers: the which thing afterwardes redoundeth to the great infamie and diſhonour of the Father, to the great perill of the Sonne, and to the greateſt griefe and diſpleaſure of the Mother. For the Childe that is brought vp wantonly, without doctrine in his youth: of neceſſity muſt be a foole, when he is old. If this which I haue ſaid be euill, this

which I will ſay is worſe, that the Fathers and Mothers, the Gouernours, or Nourſes, doe teach them to ſpeake diſhoneſt things, the which are not lawfull: and therfore ought not to be Diſtaſtfull things vnfit for either young or olde. ſuffered to bee ſpoken in that tender Age: nor the grauitie of the Auncients ought not to liſten vnto them: For there are no men (vnleſſe they be ſhameleſſe) that will permit their children to be great bablers.
                     Thoſe which haue the charge to gouerne good mens Children ought to bee very circumſpect, that they keepe them in awe, feare, and ſubjection, and that they ought not to bee contented, although the Fathers ſay they are pleaſed. For the diſordinate loue that the Fathers haue to them, is the cauſe that they can not ſee whether they be mockers, or euill brought vp. And if it chaunceth (as oft times it doth) that the Father ſhould come to the Maiſter, to cauſe him to withdraw correction: In this caſe (if the Maiſter be a wiſe man) hee ought no leſſe to reproue and admoniſh the Father, then to correct the ſonne. And if this did not auayle, I counſell him to forſake, and leaue his charge. For the man of an honeſt nature, after he hath taken any charge in hand; will either bring it to paſſe, or elſe hee will dye in the ſame.
                     I will not denie, but that it is reaſon, Noble mens Sonnes bee more gently brought vp, handled, and honoured, then the Sonnes of the Plebeians: For more delicately is the palme tree, which bringeth forth Dates, cheriſhed, then the Oake which bringeth forth Akornes, wherewith the hogges are fedde.
                     Let Princes and great Lordes beware, that the pleaſures which they gaue their children their Youth, bee not ſo exceſſiue, nor of ſo long continuance, that when they would withdraw them, the world had not already feſtered them. For, the Children brought vp with too much delicatenes, are diſobedient to their Fathers and Mothers: or elſe they are ſicke in their Bodyes, or worſe then that, they are vicious in their behauiours: ſo that their Fathers ſhould be better to burie them quicke, then to bring them vp vicious.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXIIII. How that Princes and great Lordes ought to be carefull in ſeeking wiſe men to bring vp theyr Children: Of x. conditions that good Scholemaiſters ought to haue.
                     
                     
                        WHen (He) that is without ende, gaue beginning to the worlde, in this ſort he beganne: Vide Geneſ: &amp;c. The Sunday hee created Heauen and Earth: the Monday he created the Element, the Tueſday hee created the Planettes, the Wedneſday hee created the Sunne and the Moone, the Thurſday he created the Byrdes in the Ayre, and the Fiſhes in the Sea, the Friday hee created Adam, and Eue his wife: and truely in that hee created, and how hee created, he ſhewed himſelfe as GOD: For, as ſoone as the houſe was made, hee furniſhed and peopled it with that that was neceſſarie, as he could well doe.
                     Omitting therefore the Creator: and talking of creatures: we ſee by experience, that a Houſholder in planting Excellent compariſon and forewarning, &amp;c. a vine-yarde, immediately maketh a hedge, to the ende that the beaſts doe not ſpoyle it, and eat it vp. And when it is well grown, he hireth ſome poore labourer to watche, that trauellers do not gather nor eate the grapes therof. The rich man that traffiqueth by Sea, after hee hath made a great ſhip, and beſtowed vj. or vij. thouſand ducates,

if hee be wiſe, hee will firſt prouide a man that may gouerne her, before hee will ſeeke Marchandiſe for to fraight her: For in perillous Tempeſts, the greatnes of the ſhippe little auaileth, if the Pylote be not expert.
                     The Houſholder that hath manie Cowes and ſheepe, and likewiſe hath faire fieldes, and pleaſant paſtures for his cattell, doth not only ſeeke Heardmen to keepe the cattell, but alſo dogs to feare the wolues, and cabbaines to lodge the Heardſmen. For the cabbaine of the Shepheards, and the baying of the dogge, is but as a ſalueguard of the ſheepe, from the rauening of the wolfe.
                     The mightie and valiaunt Princes, which in the Frontieres of their enemies keepe ſtrong fortreſſes, ſeeke alwayes ſtout and hardy captains to defend their walls: for otherwiſe it were better the Fort ſhould be battered to the ground, then it ſhould come into the power of the enemyes.
                     By the compariſons aboue-named, there is no diſcreat man but doth vnderſtand to what end my penne doth write them: that is, to know, to keepe, and proue, how that men which loue their Children well (adding this vnto it,) haue great neede of good maiſters and gouernours, to teach and bring them vp. For whileſt the Palme tree is but little, a froſt doth eaſily deſtroy it. I meane whiles the childe is young if he haue no tutour, he is eaſily deceiued with the world.
                     If the Lorde be wiſe and of vnderſtanding, there is no Fortreſſe ſo eſteemed: neither ſhip ſo faire: nor Heard ſo profitable: nor Vine ſo fruitfull: but that hee better eſteemeth to haue a good ſonne then all theſe things together: or anie other thing in this world. For the Father ought to loue his children as his owne proper: and all reſidue, as gifts of fortune. If it be ſo (as it is indeede,) ſince that for to keepe and watch the Heard they ſeeke a good Shephearde. If for the Vyne, they ſeeke a good Labourer. If for to gouerne the ſhippe they ſeeke a good Pylot, and for to defend a Forte, they ſeeke a good captaine: why then will not the wiſe Fathers ſeeke for good maiſters, to teache and to bring vp theyr Children?
                     Oh Princes and great Lords, I haue tolde you, and againe doe ſay: That if you trauell one yeare to leaue your Aduiſed caueats for the bringing vp of tēder youth. children goods, you ought to ſweate 50. yeares to leaue them well brought vp. For it auaileth little to carry much corne to the Mill, if the mill be out of frame. I meane that in vaine Riches and treaſures are gathered: when the childe that ſhall inherite them, hath no witte to vſe them.
                     It is no ſmall matter to knowe how to chooſe good gouernours. For the Prince is ſage that findeth ſuch a one: and much more happie is hee, that of him ſhall be taught. For in my opion, it is no ſmall charge for one man to bring vp a Prince, that ſhall gouerne manie.
                     As Seneca ſaith: The wiſe man ought to conferre all things with his Friende. But firſt hee ought to know, who is he that is his Friend? I meane that the wiſe Father ought for his Children to ſeeke one good maiſter, and to him he ſhould recommend them all: but firſt he ought to know what hee is? For, that man is very ſimple, which wil buy a Horſe, before he ſee and proue him, whether he be whole or lame. Hee ought to haue many good conditions and qualityes that ſhould bring vp the children of Princes and great Lords: for by one way they nouriſh the tender trees in the Orchard, and after another ſort they plant the wilde trees in the mountaines.
                     Therefore the caſe ſhalbe this, that weewill declare here what conditions and behauiours the Maiſters and gouernors

of Noblemens ſonnes ought to haue, which may bring them to honour: and theyr diſciples to bee well taught and brought vp. For the glorie of the diſciple alwayes redoundeth to the honour and praiſe of his maiſter.
                     The firſt condition is, that he which ought to bee a Tutor to Noble mens What conditions belong to a good ſchol maſter. children ſhould bee no leſſe then 40. yeares of age, &amp; no more then 60. becauſe the maiſter that is yong, is aſhamed to commaund, and if he be aged, he is not able to correct.
                     The ſecond, it is neceſſary that Tutors be very honeſt, and that not onely in purenes of conſcience, but alſo in the outward appearance, and cleanenes of life: For, it is vnpoſſible the childe bee honeſt, if the Maſter be diſſolute.
                     The third, it is neceſſarie that Tutors and gouernours of Princes and great Lords be true men, not onely in their wordes, but alſo in then Couenauntes. For to ſay the trueth, that mouth which is alwayes full of lyes, ought not by reaſon to be a teacher of the truth.
                     The fourth condition, it is neceſſarie that the gouernors of Princes and great Lorde (of their owne nature) be liberall: For oft times the great couetouſnes of Maſters, maketh the hearts of Princes to be greedy and couetous.
                     The fifth, it is neceſſarie that the maſters and gouernours of Princes and great Lordes be moderate in wordes and very reſolute in ſentences: ſo that they ought to teach the Children to ſpeake little, and to harken much. For it is the chiefeſt vertue in a Prince, to heare with patience, and to ſpeake with wiſedome.
                     The ſixt condition is, it is neceſſarie that the maiſters &amp; tutors of Princes &amp;c. be wiſe men and temperate: ſo that the grauitie of the Maiſter, may reſtrain the lightnes of the Schollers: For, there is no greater plagues in Realms, then for Princes to be young, and their teachers to be light.
                     The ſeuenth, it is neceſſary that the maſters and tutors of Princes &amp; great Lords be well learned in diuinitie and humanity: in ſuch ſort, that that which they teach the Princes by word, they may ſhew it by writing, to the ende that other Princes may execute and put the ſame in vre: For mens harts are ſooner moued by the examples of thoſe which are paſt, then by the words of them that are preſent.
                     The eight condition: it is neceſſary that the Maiſters and tutors of Princes, bee not giuen to the vice of the fleſh: For as they are young, and naturally giuē to the fleſh, ſo they haue no ſtrength to abide chaſte, neither wiſedome to beware of the ſnares. Therefore it is neceſſarie that their maiſters be pure and honeſt: for the diſciples ſhall neuer be chaſte, if the maiſter be vicious.
                     The ninth: it is neceſſarie that the maiſters and tutours of Princes and great Lordes haue good conditions, becauſe the children of Noble-men, (beeing daintily brought vp) alwayes learne euil conditions, the which their Maiſters ought to reforme; more by good conuerſation, then by ſharpe correction. For oft times it chaunceth Like maſter like ſcholler that whereas the Maſter is cruell, the ſcholler is not mercifull.
                     The tenth: it is neceſſarie that the maiſters and tutours of Princes and great Lords, haue not onely ſeene and read many things: but alſo that they haue proued changeable fortune. For ſince Noble mens ſonnes (by the gifte of GOD,) haue great Eſtates, they ought therfore to prouide to ſpeak to manie, to anſwer to manie, and to entreat with manie: &amp; it is very profitable for them to be conuerſant with expert men, for in the end the approued man in counſell hath preheminence.

I was willing to bring in theſe rules in my writing, to the end that fathers may keepe them in their memory, when they doe ſeeke Maſters to teach their children; for in my opinion, the father is more in fault to ſeeke an euil maſter, then the Maſter is to make an euill Scholer; For if I chooſe euill Taylers to cut my gowne, it is my fault that the cloth is loſt, and my gowne marred. Albeit the Romans were in all their doings circumſpect, yet for this one thing I muſt enuy the good doctrine which they gaue to noble mens children: for without doubt it is vnpoſſible that in any City there bee a good Common-welth vnleſſe they are very circumſpect to bring vp young children.
                     
                        Sabellicus in his rapſodies ſayeth, that in the 425. yeares of the foundation of Rome, Quintus Seruilius, and Lucius Germinus then Conſuls, being What is required in a well gouerned Cō
                           mon welth in the warre againſt the Volces, the ſtout aduenturous Captaine Camillus there roſe a great ſtrife and contention in Rome amongſt the people, and the Knights: and that contention was vpon the prouiſion of offices: for in great Common-Wealthes it hath beene an auncient quarrell that in Knights and Gentlemen, there ſurmounteth pride in commaunding: and among the people, there wanteth patience in obeying.
                     The Kinghtes and Gentlemen would they ſhould chooſe a Tribune Militare in the Senate, to ſpeake in the name of all the Knights, that were abſent and preſent: for they ſayde, that ſince they were alwayes at the warre, the whole Common wealth remayned in the power of the people.
                     The Commons on the other part importuned and deſired, that a new Officer ſhould be created, the which ſhould haue the charge to examine and take account how the youth of Rome were brought vp: becauſe the common people did accuſe the Knightes and Gentlemen, that the longer they remained in the warres, the more ſenſually their children liued in Rome.
                     
                     It was decreede then that a Tribune Militare ſhould bee erected, the which in authority and dignitie ſhould be equall with the Senators, and that hee ſhould repreſent the ſtate of Warlike Knightes: but the office continued no longer then 4. yeares in Rome, (that is to ſay) til the time that Camillus returned from the warres: for things that are grounded of no reaſon, of themſelues they come to nought.
                     All the Knightes and Gentlemen ſought to the vttermoſt of their power to maintain their preheminence: and on the other ſide, all the Comminalty of Rome were againſt it. In the end the good Captaine Camillus called all the Knightes and Gentlemen together, and ſayde vnto them theſe words.
                     I am greatly aſhamed to ſee that the ſtouteneſſe ſhould be ſo litle of the Roman knights, that they ſhold The ſpeech of Camillus condiſcend to the will of the Plebeians: for indeed the mighty do not get ſo much honor to ouercome the little, as the little doe to ſtriue with the great. I ſay that the ſtrife and debate amongſt you in Rome, doth diſpleaſe me much: therefore (you knights) if you will not loſe your honours, you muſt eyther kill them, or ouercome them. You cannot ouercome them, becauſe they are many: and kill them you ought not, for in the end they are yours, and therefore there is no better remedie then to diſſemble with them, For things which ſuffer no force, nor obſerue not iuſtice, ought alwaies, vntill conuenient time, to bee diſſembled.
                     
                        
The immortall Gods did not create Romaine knights to gouern people, but to conquer Realmes. And I ſay further, that they did not create vs to teach lawes to ours: but to giue lawes to ſtrangers. And if we be the children of our fathers, and imitators of the ancient Romaines: we will not content our ſelues to commaund in Rome, but to commaund thoſe which do command in Rome. For the heart of a true Romaine doth little eſteeme to ſee himſelfe Lord of this world: if he know that there is another to conquer. You others did create this Tribune Militare, we being in the warre: whereof now there is no neceſſity, ſince wee are in peace. And the cauſe why I was willing there ſhoulde bee none in the Common wealth, was for that there was not riches in Rome ſufficient to acquite the deſerts of the Romane chiualrie. And if you eſteeme an honourable office to be a Tribune Militare, ſince you cannot all haue it, mee thinketh you ſhould all want it. For among the Noble men and Plebeians it is not meete, that one alone ſhould enioy that, which many haue deſerued.
                     This Hiſtory Sabellicus declareth, and alleadgeth Pulio for his authour, and reciteth that for this good worke that Camillus did in Rome (that is to ſay) to ſet the great and the ſmall at one. He was as well beloued of the Romaines, as hee was feared of the enemies.
                     And not without a iuſt cauſe; for in my opinion, it is a greater vertue to pacifie his owne, then to robbe ſtrangers. As touching the office Camillus loued of the Romanes, and feared of his enemies. of this Tribune, wherupon this great contention roſe in Rome, I cannot tell which was greater, the fooliſh raſhneſſe of the Knightes to procure it, or the wiſedome of Camillus to aboliſh it: For to ſay the truth, the art of Chiualry was inuented more to defend the common wealth, then to bide at home, and haue the charge of iuſtice: For to the good Knight, it ſeemeth better to bee loaden with weapons to reſiſt enemies, then to be enuironed with bookes to determine cauſes.
                     Returning therefore to that which the people ſayde againſt the Souldiers: It was ordained by conſent of all, that in Rome an office ſhoulde be erected, and that he which ſhould haue it; ſhould haue the charge to goe thorow Rome, to ſee what they were in Rome that did not inſtruct their children in good doctrine: and if perchance he found any neighbors A good law in Rome, fitte to bee vſed all the world ouer. child that was euill taught, he chaſtiſed and baniſhed the Father. And truly the puniſhment was very iuſt, for the father deſerueth more puniſhment, for that he doth therunto conſent, then the child deſerueth more the offences which he doth commit. When Rome was Rome, and that of all the world the Common wealth thereof was commended, they choſe for an officer therein the moſt auncient and vertuous Romane, who was called the Generall viſiter of the children of Rome: and it ſeemeth to bee true, for ſo much as hee which had this office one yeare, hoped to bee Conſul, Dictator or Cenſor the next; as it appeared by Marcus Porcio, who deſired to bee corrector of the children, and afterwards ſucceeded to bee Cenſor of the Romane people: for the Romanes did not offer the office of iuſtice to any man, vnleſſe hee had experience of all Offices. Patricius Seuenſis in the booke of the Commonwealth ſayth, that before the warres were between Carthage and Rome, the Common wealth of Carthage was very well gouerned, and as it beſeemed ſuch a noble City: but it is an ancient priuiledge of the warre that it killeth the perſons, conſumeth the goods,

and aboue all, engendreth a new paſſion and miſery; and in the end deſtroyeth all good ancient cuſtomes.
                     The Carthagenians therefore had a cuſtome that the children, and eſpecially A cuſtome of the Carthagenians. thoſe which were of honeſt men, ſhould be put in the Temples from three yeeres till twelue, and ſo from twelue till twenty they learned crafts, ſciences and occupations, and from 20. til 25. they inſtructed thē in the feates of war, and at the end of 30. yeares they gaue themſelues to marriage: for amongſt them it was a Law inuiolable, that no man ſhould marrie vntill he were thirty yeares of age, and the woman 25. And after that they were married, the moneth following they ought to preſent themſelues before the Senate, and there to chooſe what kinde of eſtate they would take vpon them to liue in and what their mindes moſt deſired (that is to ſay) if they would ſerue in the Temples, follow the warre, or trauell the ſeas, or get their liuing by land, or follow their occupation which they had learned. And looke what eſtate or office that day they choſe, the ſame they kept and occupyed during their life: and truely the law was very good, becauſe ſuch change of eſtates and Offices in the World, are occaſion that preſently ſo many come to deſtruction. All the excellent and ancient Princes had many great Philoſophers for their Maſters: and this ſeemeth to be true by this, that king Darius had Lichanins the philoſopher for his maſter: the great Alexander had Ariſtotle the Philoſopher for his Maſter, King Artaxerces had Pindarus the philoſopher for his Maſter. The aduenturous and hardy captaine of the Athenians Palemo had Xenocrates the philoſopher for his maſter. Xemaides (onely king of the Corinthians) had Chilo the philoſopher for his Maſter, and tutour to his Children.
                     
                        Epamynundus Prince of the Thebanes had for his maſter and councellour Maruchus the Philoſopher.
                     
                        Vlyſſes the Greeke (as Homer ſayeth) had for his maſter and companion in his trauels, Catinus the philoſopher.
                     
                        Pirrus (which was King of the Epirotes, and a great defendor of the Tharentines) had for his Maſter and Chronicler Arthemius the philoſopher, of whom Cicero ſpeaketh ad Atticum, that his ſword was ſharper to fight then his penne ready for to write.
                     The great King Ptholomeus Philodelphus was not onely Scholer of the moſt ſingular Philoſophers of Greece: but alſo after he was King, he ſent for 72. Philoſophers, which were Hebrewes. Cirus King of the Perſians, that deſtroyed the great Babylon, had for his Maſter Priſticus the Philoſopher. Traian the Emperour had Plutarch for his Maſter, who did not onely teach him in his youth: but alſo wrote him a booke how he ought to gouerne himſelfe and his commō
                        wealth. By theſe few examples which I haue expreſſed, and by many other which I omit, Princes at this preſent may ſee, how carefull princes were in times paſt, to giue their children wiſe and learned men. O princes &amp; great Lords, ſince you at this preſent do preſume and take vpon you that which your Forefathers did, I would that now you would conſider, who brought them to ſo high eſtate: &amp; who leaueth them eternall memorie? for without doubt noble men neuer The carefulnes of Princes in times paſt to bring vp their chidren. wan renown for the pleaſurs they had in vices, but for the trauels they had in vertues. Againe I ſay, that Princes in times paſt were not famous for their ſtoutnes, &amp; apt diſpoſition of their bodies, nor for diſcent of noble lynage, nor for the poſſeſſiō
                        
of many Realmes: or heaping vp of great treaſures: but they wanne and obtained immortall renowne, for that their Fathers in their youth put them vnder the tuition of wiſe and learned tutours, which taught them good doctrine; and when they were of age, gaue them good counſellours, to gouerne the common-wealth. Laertius in the life of the Phyloſophers: and Bocchas in the Booke of the linage of Gods, ſay thus;
                     That among the Phyloſophers of Athens there was a cuſtome, that no ſtraunge Phyloſopher ſhould reade in their Schooles, before hee were firſt examined in naturall and morall Phyloſophie: For among the Greekes it was an auncient Prouerbe: That in the ſchoole of Athens, no vicious man A cuſtome among the Athemans. could enter, nor idle word be ſpoken: neyther they did conſent that any ignorant Phyloſopher ſhould come in, to reade there.
                     Now as by chaunce many phyloſophers were come from the Mount Olympus: amongſt the refidue, there was one came to ſee the philoſophers of Athens, who was natiue of Thebes, a man (as afterwardes hee declared himſelfe) in Morall and naturall phyloſophie very well learned: And ſince he deſired to remaine in Athens, hee was examined: and of many and diuers things demanded. And amongſt the others, theſe following were ſome of them.
                     Firſt, they asked him, what cauſeth women to bee ſo froward, ſince it is true that nature made them ſhamefaſte, Queſtions demaunded by the phyloſophers of Athens. and created them ſimple?
                     The Phyloſopher anſwered. A woman is not froward, but becauſe ſhee hath too much her will, and wanteth ſhame.
                     Secondarily, they asked him, why young men are vndone? hee anſwered: becauſe Time aboundeth them for to doe euill, and Maiſters wanteth to enforce them to doe good.
                     Thirdly, they asked him, why are Wiſe men deceyued, as well as the ſimple? he anſwered: The wiſe man is neuer deceyued, but by him that vſeth faire wordes, and hath euill conditions.
                     Fourthly, they asked him, of whom men ought moſt to beware? he aunſwered: That there is to a man no greater enemie, then hee which ſeeth that thing in thee, which hee deſireth to haue in himſelfe.
                     Fifthly, they asked him, why manie princes begunne well, and ended euill? hee aunſwered: Princes begin well, becauſe their nature is good: and they ende euill, becauſe no man doth gaine-ſay them.
                     Sixtly, they asked him, why do princes commit ſuch follyes? hee anſwered: Becauſe Flattterers aboundeth that deceyue them: and true men are wanting, which ſhould ſerue them.
                     Seuenthly, they asked him, why the Auncients were ſo ſage, and men at this preſent were ſo ſimple? hee aunſwered: Becauſe the Auncients did not procure, but to knowe: and theſe preſent, doe not trauell, but for to haue.
                     Eightly, they asked him, why ſo manie vices were nouriſhed in the pallaces of princes? hee aunſwered: Becauſe pleaſures abound, and counſell wanteth.
                     The ninth, they asked him, why the moſt parte of men liued without reſt, and fewe without paine? he aunſwered: No man is more without, and ſuffereth more paine: then hee that dyeth for the goods of another, and little eſteemeth his owne.
                     The tenth, they asked him, whereby they might knowe the Commonwealth to bee vndone? hee aunſwered: There is no Common-wealth vndone, but onely, where the young

are light, and the old vicious.
                     The 11. they asked him wherwith the Common-wealth is maintained? he anſwered: The common wealth cānot decay where iuſtice remaineth for the poore, puniſhment for the tyrants, weight and meaſure plentifull: and chiefly if there be good doctrine for the young, and little couetouſneſſe in the old.
                     
                        Affro the Hiſtoriographer declareth this in the tenth booke De rebus 
                        Affro. de rebus Athenienſium. 
                        Athenienſium. Truly in my opinion the words of this philoſopher were few, but the ſentences were many. And for none other cauſe I did bring in this hiſtory, but to profite mee of the laſt word, wherein for aunſwere hee ſayeth, that all the profite of the Common wealth conſiſteth, in that there be princes that reſtraine the auarice of the aged, and that there bee Maſters to teach the youthfull. We ſee by experience, that if the brute beaſts were not tyed, and the corne and ſeedes compaſſed with hedges or ditches, a man ſhold neuer gather the fruit when they are ripe. I meane, the ſtrife and debate will riſe continually among the people, if the yong men haue not good fathers to correct them, and wiſe maſters to teach them.
                     Wee cannot deny, but though the knife be made of fine ſteele, yet ſometimes it hath neede to bee whet: and ſo in like manner, the young man during the time of his youth, though he doe not deſerue it, yet from time to time hee ought to bee corrected. O Princes and great Lords, I know not of whom you take counſell when your ſonne is borne, to prouide him of a Maſter and gouernour whom you chuſe not as the moſt vertuous, but as the moſt richeſt, not as the moſt ſageſt, but as the moſt vile and euill taught. Finally, you doe not truſt him with your children that beſt deſerueth it, but that moſt procureth it. Againe I ſay, O princes and great Lords, why doe you not withdraw your children from their hands which haue their eyes more to their owne profite then their hearts vnto your ſeruice. For ſuch to enrich themſelus doe bring vp princes viciouſly. Let not Princes thinke, that it is a trifle to know, how to finde and chuſe a good Maſter, and the Lord which herein doth not employ his diligence is worthy of great rebuke. And becauſe they ſhall not pretend ignorance, let them beware of that man whoſe life is ſuſpitious and extreame A great thing for parents to chuſe good Tutors to their children. couetous.
                     In my opinion, in the pallace of princes the office of Tutorſhippe ought not to be giuen as other common offices, that is to ſay, by requeſts or money, by priuities or importunities, eyther elſe for recompence of ſeruices: for it followeth not, though a man hath beene Ambaſſadour in ſtrange Realms, or captaine of great Armies in warre, or that hee hath poſſeſſed in the royall pallace Offices of honour, or of eſtimation, that therefore he ſhould bee able to teach, or bring vp their children: For to bee a good Captaine ſufficeth onely to be hardy, and fortunate: but for to bee a Tutour and gouernour of Princes, hee ought to be both ſage and vertuous.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXXV. Of the two children of Marcus Aurelius the Emperour, of the which the beſt beloued dyed. And of the Maſters he prouided for the other named Comodus.
                     
                        
                           MArcus Aurelius the 17. Emperour of Rome, in the time that hee was married with Fauſtine, onely daughter of the Emperour Antonius Pius, had onely two ſonnes, whereof the eldeſt was named Comodus, and the ſecond Veriſsimus. Of theſe two children, the heyre was Comodus, who was ſo wicked in the 13. yeares he gouerned the Empire, that hee ſeemed rather the Diſciple of Nero the cruell, then to diſcend by the mothers ſide from Antonius the mercifull, or ſonne of Marcus Aurelius.
                     
                     This wicked child Comodus was ſo light in ſpeech, ſo diſhoneſt in perſon and ſo cruell with his people, that ofttimes hee being aliue, they layed wagers that there was no vertue in him The deſcrip of a cruell and wicked Prince. to bee found, nor any one vice in him that wanted. On the contrary part, the ſecond ſonne named Veriſsimus, was comely of geſture, proper of perſon, and in witte very temperate, and the moſt of all was, that by his good conuerſation of all hee was beloued: For the fayre and vertuous Princes by their beauty draweth vnto them mens eyes: and by their good conuerſation they winne their hearts.
                     The child Veriſſimus was the hope of the common people, and the glory of his aged Father: ſo that the Emperor determined that this child Veriſſimus ſhould bee heyre of the Empire, and that the Prince Commodus ſhould bee diſhenherited. Wherat no man ought to maruell, for it is but iuſt ſince the childe dooth not amend his life, that the father doe diſhenherite him.
                     When good will doth want, and vicious pleaſures abound, the children oft times by peruerſe fortune come to nought: So this Marcus Aurelius being 52. yeares old, by chance this childe Veriſſimus, which was the glory of Rome, and the hope of the Father, at the gate of Hoſtia, of a ſodaine ſickneſſe dyed.
                     The death of whom was as vniuerſally lamented, as his life of all men The death of the Prince Veriſſimus greatly bewayled. was deſired. It was a pittifull thing to ſee, how wofully the Father tooke the death of his entirely beloued ſon: and no leſſe lamentable to beholde how the Senate tooke the death of their Prince, being the heyre: for the aged Father for ſorrow did not go to the Senate, and the Senate for a few dayes encloſed themſelues in the hie Capitoll.
                     And let no man maruell, though the death of this young Prince was ſo taken through Rome; for if men knew what they loſe when they loſe a vertuous Prince, they would neuer ceaſe to bewayle and lament his death. When a Knight, a Gentleman a Squire, an Officer, or when any of the people dyeth, there dyeth but one: but when a Prince dyeth, which was good for all, and that he liued to the profite of all, then they ought to make account that all do dye, &amp; they ought all greatly to lament it: for oft times it chanceth that after 2. or 3. good Princes, a foule flocke of Tyrants ſucceede. Therfore Marcus Aurelius the Emperor, as a man of great vnderſtanding, and of a princely perſon, though the inward ſorrow from the rootes of the heart could not bee plucked: yet hee determined to diſſemble outwardly, to bury his grieues inwardly.
                     
                        
For to ſay the truth, none ought (for any thing) to ſhewe extreame ſorrow, vnleſſe it be that hee hath loſt his honour, or that his conſcience is burdened.
                     The good Prince, as one that hath his vineyarde frozen, wherein was all his hope, contented with himſelfe, with that which remaineth, his ſo deerly beloued ſonne being dead: and commaunded the Prince Comodus to be brought into his pallace, being his onely heire.
                     
                        Iulius Capitolinus, which was one of thoſe that wrote of the time of Marcus Aurelius, ſaide vpon this matter: that when the Father ſaw the diſordinate The tendernes of the Emperour toward his ſonne. fraileneſſe, and lightnes, and alſo the little ſhame which the prince Comodus his Sonne brought with him: the aged man beganne to weepe, and ſhed teares from his eyes. And it was becauſe the ſimpleneſſe and vertues of his deere beloued Sonne Veriſſimus, came into his minde.
                     Although this Noble Emperour Marcus Aurelius, for the death of his ſonne was very ſorrowfull: yet notwith ſtanding this, hee prouided how his other ſonne Comodus ſhold be gouerned: and this before that either of age or bodie he were greater. For we cannot denye, but when Princes are men, they will bee ſuch as in theyr youth they haue been brought vp.
                     The good Father therefore knowing that the euill inclinations of his ſhould doe him damage, and the Empire in like manner: he ſent throughout all Italie, for the moſte ſageſt and expert men, to be gouernours and tutours of Comodus the Prince. Hee made them ſeeke for the moſte profoundeſt in learning, the moſt renowmed of good fame, the moſt vertuous in deedes, and the moſt deepeſt in vnderſtanding: For as the duſt is not ſwept with fine cloth, but with drye broomes: ſo the lightnes and follyes of young men are not remedyed but by the hard diſcipline of the aged.
                     This commaundement being publiſhed and proclaimed in Rome, and the bruite ſcattered through Italie: there came, and ranne thither diuers kinde of Sages, whom he commaunded to be examined.
                     Hee being truely informed of the bloud of their predeceſſours, of the age of their perſons, of the gouernement of their houſes, of the ſpending of their goods, of their credite among their neighbours, of the ſciences they knew: and aboue all, they were no leſſe examined of the purenes of their How euery man ought to examine their tutors. liues, then of the grauitie of their perſons: for there are many men which are graue in open wordes, and verie light in ſecrete workes.
                     Speaking therfore more particularly, hee commanded they ſhould examine the Aſtronomers of aſtronomy, the Phyloſophers of Phyloſophie, the Muſitians in muſicke: the Orators in orations: and ſo forth, of other Sciences in order, wherin euery one ſaid hee was inſtructed.
                     The good Emperour was not ſo contented to doe this once, but ſundrie times: and not all in one day, but in many: and not onely by another man, but alſo by himſelfe.
                     Finally, they were all examined, as if they had been all one, and that the ſame one ſhould haue remayned, and been kept for all, to bee the onely Maſter and Tutour of the young childe, and prince Comodus.
                     
                     To acquire a perfect knowledge, and to be ſure not to erre in choyce of things, in my opinion is not onely required experience of himſelfe, and a cleare vnderſtanding: but alſo the aduiſe of another: For the knowledge of things wholly together is eaſie: but the choyce of them particularly is harde.
                     This thing is onely ſpoken becauſe

the good Emperour ſent and commaunded to chooſe gouernours and Maſters of his children.
                     Of many he choſe few, and of few the moſt wiſeſt, of the moſt wiſeſt, the How circūſpect the Emperour was in chuſing teachers for his ſonne. moſt expert, of the moſt expert, the beſt learned, of the beſt learned, the moſt temperate, of the moſt temperate, the moſt ancient, and of the moſt ancient the moſt noble.
                     Certainely ſuch election is worthy prayſe, becauſe they be true maſters and teachers of Princes, which are noble of bloud, ancient in yeers, honeſt in life, men of little folly, and of great experience.
                     According to the ſeuen liberall Sciences, two maſters of euery one were choſen, ſo that the Prince was but one, and the others were 14. but this notwithſtanding, the workes of this Prince Comodus were contrary to the expectation of his father Marcus Aurelius, becauſe the intention of the good father was to teach his ſon all ſciences, and the ſtudy of the ſon was to learne all vices.
                     At the bruite of ſo great a thing as this was, that the Emperor ſought to prouide tutors for the Prince Comodus, and that they ſhould not bee thoſe which were beſt fauoured, but thoſe which were found the moſt wiſeſt: In ſhort ſpace there came ſo many Philoſophers to Rome, as if the diuine Plato had beene reuiued againe in Greece. Let vs not maruell at all, if the Sages deſired the acquaintance of familiarity of this good Emperour.: for in the ende there is no man ſo ſage, nor ſo vertuous in his life, but ſomtime will ſeeke after the fauours of the world. Since there were many Sages, and that of thoſe he choſe but foureteene. It was neceſſary hee ſhould honeſtly and wiſely diſpatch and giue the others leaue, as did behoue him.
                     And herein the good Emperour ſhewed himſelfe ſo wiſe, that ſhewing to ſome a merry countenance, to others ſpeaking gently, and to others by a certaine hope, and to others by gifts and preſents, and all the good company of the Sages departed, and the good Emperor diſpatched them, not one being ſadd which departed, but very well pleaſed: For it is not comely for the magnificence of a Prince, that the man which commeth to his Pallace onely for his ſeruice, ſhould returne murmuring, or without reward.
                     This good Emperour ſhewed him ſelfe Sage to ſeeke many Sages, hee ſhewed himſelfe wiſe in the choyce of ſome, and of a good vnderſtanding in diſpatching others, and in contenting them all: for as wee ſee dayly by experience, though the election be good, cōmonly great affections thereupon engender: for thoſe for not beeing choſen are ſorry, and to ſee that others choſen are ſhamefaſt. In ſuch caſe likewiſe, let it not be eſteemed litle to ſerch a good remedie: for the Goldſmith oft times demaundeth more for the workemanſhippe then the ſiluer is worth: I meane that ſometimes Princes doe deſerue more honour for the good With what vertues Princes ought to be adorned. meanes they vſe in their affaires, then for the good ſuceſſe whereunto it commeth: for the one aduenture guideth, but the other wiſedome aduanceth.
                     The good Emperour not contented with this, prouided that thoſe foureteen Philoſophers which ſhould remaine in his Pallace, ſhould ſit at the table and accompany his perſon: the which thing he did, to ſee if their life were comformable to their doctrine, and if their words did agree to their workes: for there are many men which are of a goodly tongue, and of a wicked life. Iulius Capitolinus, and Cinna Catullus which were

writers of this Hiſtory ſay, that it was a wonder to ſee how this good Emperour did marke them, to know if they were ſober in feeding, temperat in drinking, modeſt in going, occupyed in ſtudying, &amp; aboue all, if they were very ſage in ſpeaking, and honeſt in liuing.
                     Would to God that Princes of our time were in this caſe ſo diligent and carefull: and that in committing in truſt their affayres, they would not How princes ſhoulde giue credite to their ſeruants. care more for one then for others. For ſpeaking with due reuerence, there aboundeth no wiſedome in that Prince, which committeth a thing of importance to that man whom hee knoweth not, whether hee is able to bring it to paſſe or not. Many talke euill, and maruel that Princes and great Lords in ſo many things do erre: and for the contrary I maruell how they hit any at all. For if they committed their weighty affayres to skilfull men, though perhappes they erre once, yet they hitt it a hundred times; but when they commit theyr buſineſſe to ignorant men, if they hit once, they miſſe a thouſand times againe.
                     In this caſe, I ſay, there is nothing deſtroyeth young Princes more, then for that they commit not their affairs to their old and faithfull ſeruants: for in fine the vnfained loue is not, but in him that eateth the Princes breade dayly. It is but reaſon that other Princes take example by this Prince, to ſeeke good maſters for their Children: and if the Maſters bee good, and the Schollers euill, then the Fathers are blameleſſe: For to Princes &amp; great Lords, it is a great diſcharge of conſcience, to ſee though theyr children bee loſt, yet it is not for want of doctrine, but for aboundance of malice.
                     The Romane Prince had a cuſtom to celebrate the feaſt of the god Genius, who was god of their birth, and that feaſt was celebrated euerie yeare once, which was kept the ſame day of the birth of the Emperour, ioifully throughout all Rome; for at this day all the priſoners were pardoned, and deliuered out of the priſon Mamortina.
                     
                     Yet notwithſtanding you ought to know, that if any had ſowed ſedition among the people, or had betrayed the Armies, or robbed or Three of offences neuer pardoned in Rome. done any miſchiefe in their temples: thoſe three offences were neuer pardoned nor excuſed in Rome.
                     Euen as in Chriſtian Religion, the greateſt oath is to ſweare by God; ſo amongſt the Romanes there was no greater oath then to ſweare by the God Genius.
                     
                     And ſince it was the greateſt oath none ſhould ſweare it, but by the licence of the Senate, and that ought to be betwixt the hands of the prieſts of the God Genius. And if perchance ſuch an oath were taken of light occaſion, hee which ſware it was in danger of his life. For in Rome there was an ancient Law, that no man ſhould make any ſolemne oath, but that firſt they ſhould demaund licence of the Senate.
                     The Romaines did not permitte that lyers nor deceyuers ſhould bee credited by their oathes: neyther did they permit them to ſweare. For they ſayde, that periured men doe both blaſpheme the gods, &amp; deceiue men.
                     The aboue named Marcus Aurelius was borne the 27. day of Aprill, in Mount Celio, in Rome. And as by chance they celebrated the Feaſt of the god Genius, which was the day of his birth, there came maſters offence Iuglers, and common players, with other loyterers, to walke and ſolace themſelues: For the Romaines in their great feaſts occupied themſelus

all night in offering ſacrifices to the gods, and afterwards they conſumed all the day in paſtimes. Thoſe iuglers and players ſhewed ſo much paſtime that all thoſe which beheld them were prouoked to laugh, and the Romaines (to ſay the truth) were ſo earneſt in matters of Paſtime, and alſo in other matters of weight, that in the day of paſtimes no man was ſad, and in the time appointed for ſadneſſe no man was merry. So that in publike affaires they vſed all to mourne, or elſe all to reioyce. Sinna Catulus ſaith, that this good Emperour was ſo well beloued, that when he reioyced, all reioyced: and when the Romane The greate loue of the Romanes to the Emperour. people made any great feaſt, he himſelfe was there preſent, to make it of more authoritie, and ſhewed ſuch mirth therein, as if he alone and none other had reioyced. For otherwiſe if the Prince looke ſadly, no man dare ſhew himſelfe merry. The Hiſtoriographers ſay of this good Emperour, that in ioyfull feaſts and triumphs they neuer ſaw him leſſe merry, then was requiſite for the feaſt: nor they euer ſaw him ſo merry, that it exceeded the grauitie of his perſon. For the Prince which in vertue preſumeth to bee excellent, ought neither in earneſt matters to be heauy, nor in things of ſmall importance to ſhew himſelfe light.
                     As Princes now adayes goe enuironed with men of armes: ſo did the good Emperour goe accompanyed with ſage Phyloſophers. Yea and more then that, which ought moſt to bee noted, is, that in the dayes of feaſts and pleaſures, the Princes at this preſent goe accompanied with hungry flatterers: but this noble Emperour went accompanied with wiſe men. For the Prince that vſeth himſelfe with good company, ſhall alwaie auoyde the euill talke of the people.
                     
                        Sextus Cheronenſis ſaith, that a Senatour called Fabius Patroclus ſeeing that the Emperour Marcus went alwayes to the Senate and Theaters, accompanied and enuironed with Sages: ſaide one day to him merrily.
                     
                        I pray thee (my Lord) tell me, why 
                        A queſtion demaunded of the Emperour, and his anſwere. 
                        thou goeſt not to the Theater as to the Theater, and to the Senate as to the Senate. For the Senate Sages ought to goe to giue vs good counſell: and to the Theaters, fooles to make vs paſtime. To this the good Emperour anſwered: My friend, I ſay thou art much deceiued. For to the ſacred Senate, wherein there are ſo many ſages, I would leade all the fooles to the end they may become wiſe: and to the Theaters where all the fooles are, I would bring the ſages, to the end to teach them wiſedome. Truly this ſentence was fit for him that ſpake it.
                     I admoniſh princes and great Lords, that in ſteed to keepe companie with fooles, flatterers and paraſites, they prouide to haue about them wiſe and ſage men, in eſpecially if the fooles bee malitious: for the noble harts with one malitious word are more offended, then if they were with a venemous arrow wounded.
                     Therefore returning to our matter, as the Emperour was in the feaſt of the god Genius, and that with him alſo were the foureteene Sages (Maſters of the prince Comodus) a iugler more cunning then all the reſt, ſhewed ſundry trickes, as commonly ſuch vaine loyterers are wont to doe, for hee that in like vanities ſheweth moſt paſtime, is of the people beſt beloued.
                     As the Emperour Marcus Aurelius was ſage: ſo he ſet his eyes more for to behold theſe foureteene Maſters, then he did ſtay at the lightnes of the fooles.
                     And by chance he eſpied that fiue of theſe laughed ſo inordinatly at the

folly of theſe fooles, that they clapte their hands, they bette their feete, &amp; loſt the grauity of Sages by their inordinate laughter, the which was a very vncomely thing in ſuch graue perſons: for the honeſt modeſty of the body, is a great witneſſe of the wiſedome and grauity of the minde: The lightneſſe and inconſtancy of the Sages ſeene by the Emperour, and that all the graue Romanes were offended with them, he tooke it heauily, as well to haue brought them thither, as to haue beene deceyued in electing them.
                     Howbeit with his wiſedome then he helped himſelfe as much as hee could, in not manifeſting any griefe in his heart; but he diſſembled, and made as though hee ſaw them not: For Sage Princes muſt needes feele things as men, but they ought to diſſemble them as diſcreet.
                     The Emperour preſently would not admoniſh them, nor before any reproue them, but let the feaſt paſſe on, and alſo a few dayes after, the which being paſſed, the Emperour ſpake vnto them in ſecret, not telling them openly, wherein he ſhewed him ſelfe a mercifull Prince: for open correction is vniuſt, where ſecret correction may take place.
                     The things which Marcus Aurelius 
                        The wiſedome of the Emperour Marcus Aurelius. ſayde to thoſe fiue Maſters when hee put them out of his houſe, he himſelf did write in the third booke, and the firſt Chapter, vnder the title, Adſtultos Pedagogos. And ſayde that he ſaide vnto them theſe, and ſuch other like words.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXVI. Of the words which Marcus Aurelius ſpake to fiue of the foureteene Maſters which he had choſen for the Education of his ſonne, and how hee ſent them from his Pallace for that they behaued themſelues lightly at the feaſt of God Genius.
                     
                        FRiendes, my will was not to foreſee that which cannot The ſpeech of the Emperour to the philoſophers. bee excuſed, nor I will not command you that, which I ought not to commaund: but I deſire that the Gods of their grace doe remaine with me, and that with you the ſame iuſt gods may goe, and that likewiſe from mee, and from you, the vnluckie and vnfortunat chances may be withdrawn: For the vnluckie man were better to be with the dead, then remaine here with the liuing. Since that now I had receyued you, and with great diligence ſought you, to the end you ſhould bee tutors to my Sonne (the Prince Comodus) I proteſt to the immortall Gods that I am ſorry, and that of your ſhame I am aſhamed, and that of your paine the greateſt part is mine. And it can be no otherwiſe, for in the world there ſhould be no friendſhippe ſo ſtraight, that a man therefore ſhould put his good name in danger.
                     The Sages that I haue ſought, were not prouided onely to learne the Prince Comodus: but alſo to reform all thoſe that liued euill in my Pallace. And now I ſee the contrary, for where I thought the fooles ſhould haue beene made wiſe, I ſee that thoſe that were wiſe, are become

fooles. Know you not that the fine golde defendeth his purenes among the burning coales? that the man endued with wiſdome ſheweth himſelfe wiſe, yea in the middeſt of many How a wiſeman is diſcerned from a foole. fooles? for truly as the golde in the fire is proued, ſo among the lightnes of fooles, is the wiſedome of the wiſe diſcerned.
                     Doe not you know, that the Sage is not knowne among the Sages, nor the foole among the fooles? but among fooles wiſe men do ſhine, and that among the ſages fooles are darkned: for there the wiſe ſheweth his wiſedome, and the foole ſheweth his folly. Doe not you know that in the ſore wounds the Surgian ſheweth his cunning, and that in the dangerous diſeaſes, the Phyſitian ſheweth his ſcience? And that in the doubtfull battels the Captain ſheweth his ſtouteneſſe? and that in the boyſterous ſtormes the Maſter ſheweth his experience? So in like maner, the Sage man, in the place where there is great ioy and ſolace of people, ought to ſhew his wiſedom and diſcretion. Do not you know that of a moderate witte there proceedeth a cleare vnderſtanding, a ſharpe memory, a graue perſon, a quiet minde, a good name, and aboue all, a temperate tongue: for he onely ought to be called wiſe, who is diſcreete in his workes, and reſolute in his words. Do not you know that it little auayleth to haue the tongue expert, the memory liuely, the vnderſtanding cleare to haue great ſcience, to haue profound eloquence, a ſweet ſtyle, and ample experience, if with all theſe things you bee as maſters, and in your workes as wicked men: certainly it is a great diſhonour to a vertuous Emperor that he ſhould haue for maſters of yong Princes thoſe which are Schollers of vaine iuglers. Do not you know, that if all the men of this world are bound to leade a good life, that thoſe which preſume to haue ſcience, are much more bound then others are, which by their eloquence preſume to confound the world? For it is a rule certaine, That alwayes euill workes take away the credite from good words.
                     
                     And to the end it ſeeme not vnto you that I ſpeake of fauour, I will here bring into your memory an ancient Law of Rome, the which was made in the time of Cinna, which ſaid An ancient Law among the Romans worthy obſeruation. 
                        Wee ordaine and commaund, that more grieuous puniſhment be giuen vnto the Sage for one folly only committed by him openly, then to the ſimple man for a greater offence committed ſecretly.
                     
                     O iuſt, and very iuſt law, O iuſt and happy Romanes, I ſay vnto all thoſe that together did finde and ordayne the Law: for the ſimple man ſlayeth but one man with his ſword of wrath; but the ſage man killeth many by the euill example of his life: For (according to the ſaying of the diuine Plato) The Princes and Sage men ſinne more by the euill examples which they giue, then in the fault and offence they commit.
                     
                     All the ancient Writers affirme, that the triumphant Rome neuer beganne to decay, vntill the Senate was repleniſhed with ſage ſerpents, and deſtitute of ſimple doues: for in the ende there is nothing that ſooner deſtroyeth Princes, then thinking to haue about them wiſe men that ſhold counſell them, when indeed they are malitious, that ſeeke to deceiue them.
                     What a thing it was in olde time to ſee the policie of Rome before that Silla and Marius did alter it, before that Catilina and Catullus did troble What Rome was in ancient time. it, before that Iulius Caeſar and Pompeius ſlaundered it, before that Auguſtus and Marcus Antonius deſtroyed it, before that Tiberius and

                        Caligula did defame it, and before that Nero and Domitian did corrupt it? For, the moſte parte of theſe, although they were valiant, and wanne many Realmes: yet notwithſtanding the vices which they brought vs, were more then the Realms they wanne vs. And the worſte of all is, that all our Kingdomes are loſt, and our vices abide ſtill.
                     If Liuius and the other Hyſtoriographers doe not deceyue vs, in olde time they might haue ſeene in the ſacred Senate, ſome Romaines ſo auncient, with hayres ſo honorable: others ſo experte men: others aged, ſo modeſt, that it was a wonder to ſee the majeſty they did repreſent, and a comforte to heare that which they ſayde.
                     I ſpeake not that without teares, which I will ſay; that inſtead of thoſe graue &amp; auncient aged perſons, there ſprang vppe other young bablers; the which are ſuch, and ſo manie, that all the Common-wealth is altered, and Rome her ſelfe ſlaundered.
                     For that Land is curſed, and with much miſerie compaſſed, where the gouernaunce of the young is ſo euill, that all wiſh for the reuiuing of the dead. If wee credite that which the Rome in auncient times

So that the effect of the Greekes was to ſpeake, and the glorie of the Romaines was to worke. But now, through our wofull deſtinies, it is all contrary: For Greece hath baniſhed from it all the ſpeakers to Rome, and Rome hath baniſhed from it all the Sages to Greece.
                     
                     And if it be ſo (as it is indeed) I had rather be baniſhed to Greece, with the Sages: then to take part with Rome, among the fooles.
                     By the faith of a Chriſtian I ſweare vnto you (my friendes) that I beeing young, ſaw an Oratour in Rome which was brought vp in the palace of Adrian my Lord, whoſe name was Ariſtonocus: of his bodie he was of meane ſtature, leane of face, and alſo he was of an vnknowne countrey, but he had ſuch a pleaſaunt tongue, that though he had made an oration in the Senate of three hours long, there was no man but willingly were deſirous to heare him. For in the olde time, if hee that made an Oration in the Senate were eloquent in his ſpeach, he was hearde no leſſe, then if god Apollo had ſpoken himſelfe.
                     This Phyloſopher Ariſtonocus was on the one parte ſo gentle in his ſpeech, and on the other part ſo diſſolute in his life: that hee neuer ſpake worde to the Senate, but it deſerued One badde worke marres many good ſpeeches. eternall memorie: and out of that place they neuer ſawe him doe good workes, but it merited grieuous puniſhment. As I haue ſaide, though in that time I was yong, yet I remember, that to ſee this phyloſopher ſo loſt, all the people did pittie: and the worſt of all was, that they neuer hoped for his amendment; ſince daily more and more, hee loſt his honour. For there is no man, that by is Eloquence may haue ſuch renowme, but in the ende hee may loſe it againe, by his euill life.
                     Now I aske you (my Friendes) ſith you are in the reputation of Sages, which was better, or to ſay better, which had beene leſſe enuyed? that this Phyloſopher had beene a ſimple man, and of good life, then to bee (as he was) a man of high eloquence, and of euill condition? It was vnpoſſible, if hee had once hearde of mee that, which many times I haue heard ſay of him, that he had not counſelled me, yea, and further to doe it, he had conſtrained me, rather to chuſe the graue, then to liue in Rome with infamie. For he is vnworthie to liue amongſt men, whoſe words of all are approued, and

his workes of all condemned.
                     The firſt Dictator in Rome was Largius, and the firſt Lord of the knights, was Spurius. And from the time of the firſt Dictatour, vntill the time of Sylla &amp; Iulius (which were the firſt tyrants) were foure hundred and fiftie yeares: in the which ſpace, we neuer read that any philoſopher ſpake any vain words nor yet committed any ſclaunderous deedes. And if Rome had done any otherwiſe, it had bin vnworthie of ſuch praiſe and eſtimation as it had: for it What is required in a ſage Phyloſopher. is vnpoſſible that the people bee well gouerned, if the Sages which gouern them, are in their liues diſſolute.
                     I proteſt to the immortall Gods, and ſweare by the faith of a Chriſtian, that whē I conſider that which at this preſent with mine eyes I ſee: I cānot but ſigh for that is paſt, and weep for that which is preſent. That is to ſay, to ſee then how the Armyes fought: to ſee how the young men trauelled to bee good: to ſee how well Princes gouerned: to ſee the obedience of the people: and aboue all, it was a maruellous thing to ſee the liberties and fauours which the ſages had: &amp; the ſubjection &amp; ſmall eſtimation, that the ſimple people were in. And now by our euill fortune, we ſee the cōtrary in theſe our wofull times: ſo that I cannot tel, whether firſt I ſhould bewaile the vertues and Nobleneſſe of them that are paſt, or the vices and infamies of theſe which are preſent. For, wee neuer ought to ceaſe from praiſing the goodnes of the good: nor to ceaſe from reprouing the wickednes of the euill.
                     Oh that I had been in that glorious world, to ſee ſo honorable and auncient Sages, to gouerne in pleaſure: and for the contrary, what griefe and pittie, ſhame, and diſhonour is it, to ſee now ſo many diſſolute Sages, and ſo many young and buſie heads, the which (as I haue ſaide) doe deſtroy all Rome, and ſlaunder all Italie, and diſhonor themſelues? For the want of vertue which in them aboundeth, and endamageth the Common-wealth: and as the other vices wherewith they are repleniſhed, corrupteth the people in ſuch ſorte, that the weale publique is more diſhonored through the diſſolute life of them, then it is anoyed by the weapons Whē Rome flouriſhed in vertue. of their enemyes. I ſay againe, and repeate my friends, that the proſperitie of Rome endured 400. and xv. yeares: in the which time there was a great maieſty of works, and a maruellous ſimplicitie of words: and aboue all, that the beſt that it had, was, that it was rich of the good and vertuous men, and poore of euill and vicious loyterers.
                     For in the ende, that Citie cannot be called proſperous, which hath in it manie people: but onely that which hath in it fewe vices.
                     Speaking therefore more particularly, the cauſe that moued mee to put you from mee is, becauſe in the day of the great feaſt of the god Genius, you ſhewed (in the preſence of the Senate) your little wiſedome, and your great follie: For ſo much as all men did behold more the lightnes of your perſon, then they did the follyes of the jugglers.
                     If perchaunce you ſhewed your follie, to the intent men ſhould thinke that you were familiar in my Royall Pallace, I tell you, that the errour of your thought was no leſſe then the euill What moued the Emperour to put away the Phyloſophers. example of your worke: For no man ought to be ſo familiar with princes, but (whether it be in ſporte or in earneſt) he ought to do him reuerēce.

                     CHAP. XXXVII. That Princes and other noble men ought to ouerſee the Tutours of their Children, leſt they conceale the ſecrete faults of their Schollers.
                     
                     
                        WEe haue before rehearſed what conditions, what age, and what grauitie Maſters ought to haue, which ſhould bring vp the children of princes. Now reaſon would we ſhould declare, what the counſels ſhould bee that princes ſhould giue to the Maſters and Tutors of their children, before they ought to giue them any charge. And after that it is meete wee declare, what the counſell ſhall be which the Maſter ſhall giue to his Diſciple, hauing the gouernment of him.
                     For it is vnpoſſible there ſhould happen any misfortune, where ripe counſell is euer preſent. It ſhall ſeeme vnto thoſe that ſhall profoundly conſider this matter, that it is a ſuperfluous thing to treate of theſe thinges: for eyther princes chuſe the good, or els they chuſe the euill. If they chuſe not good maſters, they labour in vain to giue them good counſell: for the What is required in good Tutors. fooliſh maſter is leſſe capable of coū
                        ſell then the diſſolute ſcholler is of wholeſome admonition. If perchance princes doe make elections of good Maſters, then thoſe Maſters both for themſelues, and alſo for others ought to miniſter good counſels. For to giue counſell to the wiſe man, it is eyther a ſuperfluous deed, or elſe it cō
                        meth of a preſumptuous man. Though it be true, that hee which dare giue counſell to the Sage man is preſumptuous, I ſay in like manner, that the Diamond beeing ſet in gold, loſeth not his vertue, but rather increaſeth in price and value: I meane, that the wiſer a man is, ſo much the more hee ought to deſire to know the opinion of another; certainely, he that doth ſo, cannot erre: For to none his owne counſell aboundeth ſo much, but that hee needeth the counſel and opinion of another.
                     Though Princes and great Lords do ſee with their eyes, that they haue choſē good maſters &amp; tutors to teach their children, yet they ought not therefore to be ſo negligent of themſelues, but that ſometimes they may giue the maſters counſell: for it may be, that the maſters be both noble &amp; ſtout, that they be ancient, ſage, and moderate: but it may be alſo, that in teaching childrē they are not expert: For to maſters and tutors of princes, it is not ſo much neceſſary that ſciences do abound, as it is ſhame that experience ſhould want. When a rich man letteth out his farme or manor, to a farmor, he doth not onely conſider with himſelfe before what rent hee ſhall pay him, but alſo he couenanteth with him that he ſhal keepe his grounds well fenced and ditched, and his houſes well repayred.

And not contented to receyue the third part of the fruit of his vine: but alſo he goeth twice or thrice in a year to viſite it: And in ſeeing it hee hath reaſon, for in the end the one occupieth the goods as a Tenant, and the other doth view the ground as chiefe Lord. Then if the father of the family with ſo great diligence doth recommend the trees, and the ground to the Labourer: how much more ought the Father to recommend his children to the Maſters: for the father giuing counſell to the Maſter is no other, but to deliuer his child to the Treaſurer of Science.
                     Princes and great Lords cannot excuſe themſelues of an offence, if after that they haue choſen a knight or Gentleman for to be Maſter, or els a learned and wiſe man to be tutour, they are ſo negligent as if they neuer had had children, or did remember that their children ought to be theyr Heires: certainely this thing ſhould not bee ſo lightly paſſed ouer. But as a wiſe man (which is carefull of the honour and profite of his child) hee ought to bee occupied, as well in taking heed to the maſter, as the maſter ought to be occupied, in taking heede to the child: For the good fathers ought to know, whether the maſter that he hath choſen can commaund, and whether his child will obey.
                     One of the nobleſt Princes among the Ancients, was Seuleucus, King of the Aſſyrians, and husband of Eſtrabonica (the daughter of Demetrius, King of Macedony) a Lady for her beauty in all Greece the moſt renowned of her fame, though indeed ſhe was not very fortunate. This is an old diſeaſe, that hapneth alwayes to beutiful women, that there be many that deſire them, and more that ſlaunder them. This King Seuleucus was firſt married with another woman, of whome hee had a ſonne called Antigonus, 'the which was in loue with the ſecond wife of his Father, that is to ſay, with the Queene Eſtrabonica, and was almoſt dead for loue. The which the father vnderſtanding, married his ſon with her: ſo that ſhe that was his ſtepmother, was his wife; and ſhee that was a faire wife, was a faire daughter, and hee which was his Sonne, was made his ſonne in law, and hee which was Father, was ſtepfather.
                     The Authour hereof is Plutarch in his liues, as Sextus Cheronenſis ſayeth, in the thirde booke of the ſayings of the Greekes.
                     
                     The king Seuleucus laboured diligently to bring vp his ſonne Antigonus wel, wherfore he ſought him two notable maſters: the one a Greeke, the other a Latine. The K: Seuleucus herewith not contented, prouided ſecretly (by the means of a ſeruant of his named Parthemius) that he ſhould haue no other office in the Pallace, but that what the maſters taught or did to his ſonne Antigonus in the day, hee ſhould ſecretly come, and tell him in the night.
                     But by the diligence of Parthemius, it came to the knowledge of the Tutors, that they had ouer-ſeers: for in the ende there is nothing accuſtomablie, but at the laſt will bee reuealed.
                     Since the two Phyloſophers knew the ſecret, one day they ſaide vnto the The Phyloſophers ſpeeche to K. Seleucus. King Seuleucus theſe wordes:

                           tion of thy Sonne? For wee let thee to knowe, that to men of honour it is vntollerable euill to ſhame them, and no diſhonour to licence them. Thou haſt appointed Parthemius, to goe and dog vs, to ſee
                        
                        what we do, or ſay openly, and afterwards to make relation vnto thee ſecretly: And the worſt is, that by relation of the ſimple, wee ſhould be condemned, beeing Sages: For triacle is not ſo contrary to poyſon, as ignoraunce is to wiſedome. And truely (moſt Noble Prince) it is a great matter, that daily inquiſition is made of man: for there is no Beard ſo bare ſhauen, but it wil growe againe.
                     
                     
                        I meane, that there is no man of ſo honeſt a life, but if a man make inquiſition, he may finde wherewithall to detect.
                     
                     
                        The K: Seuleucus anſwered them thus. Conſider my Friendes, that I knowe right well, that neyther the authoritie of the perſon, nor the good credite of renowme would bee ſtayned for any other Friende in this world: and if the rude men doe it not, much leſſe ought the Sages to doe it. 
                        King Seuleucus his anſwer. 
                        For there is nothing that men trauell for ſo much in this life, as to leaue of them a good renowme after theyr death. Since you are Sages, and Maiſters of my Sonne, and likewiſe counſellers of my houſe, it is not meete that you ſhould with any bee offended: For by all good reaſon hee alone ought to bee eſteemed in the Pallaces of Princes, that will giue vnto Princes good counſell.
                     
                     
                        That which I haue ſaide to Parthemius, was not for the doubt of your faith, neyther to thinke any daunger in your authoritie. And if the thing be well conſidered, it goeth well for you, and not euill for me: and the reaſon hereof is, that eyther you are good, or elſe you are euill: If you be good, you ought to be glad that daily your good ſeruices be reported vnto mee,
                     
                     
                        For the continual beating into the Princes eares of the good ſeruices of his Seruants, muſt needes cauſe at the laſt theyr good ſeruices to be well rewarded.
                     
                     
                        If you bee euill, and in teaching my Sonne negligent: it is but reaſon that I bee thereof aduertiſed. For if the Father be deceyued in his opinion, the Sonne ſhal receiue poyſon in his doctrine, and alſo becauſe you ſhall not vndoe my Realme, nor ſlaunder mee by your euill councell.
                     
                     
                        If the fatall Deſtinies permitte that my Sonne be euill: I am hee that loſeth moſt therby; for my Realme ſhall be deſtroyed, and my renowne vtterly aboliſhed, and in the ende, my Sonne ſhall not enioy the Heritage. And if all paſſe ſo, you will care little: For you will ſay you are not in fault ſince the childe would not receiue your doctrine, Wherefore mee thinkes it not euill done to ouer-ſee you, as you ouerſee him: For my duety is to ſee that you be good, and your duety is to trauell, that your Diſciples be not euill.
                     
                     This King Seuleucus, was an honourable man, and died aged (as Plutarche ſaieth, and Patroclus more plainely declareth, in the third book of the warre of the Aſſyrians) and for the contrarie his ſonne Antigonus, came to be a wicked prince in all his doings.
                     And this a man may well perceiue, that if he had not been of his Father ſo much corrected, and of the Schoolmaiſters ſo well inſtructed: without doubt hee would haue proued much more wicked then he was. For young men on the one parte beeing euill inclined, and on the other parte euill taught, it is vnpoſſible but in the end they ſhould grow to be moſt vicious, and defamed.
                     In my opinion, though children be What profit cometh to children by good counſell. not euil inclined, yet the fathers thereof ought not to ceaſe to corect them: for in time to come thoſe that write, will commend the diligence of the fathers, in correcting the vices of their children.
                     I haue declared this example, to counſel that the Father be not ſo negligent, that he ſhould vtterly forget to looke vnto his Sonne, thinking that now the Maiſter hath charge of him. And of my counſell, that Father ought in this thing to bee ſo aduertiſed, that if at the firſt hee behelde the Childe with two Eyes: that then he ſhould looke vnto him with ſower eyes. For

oft times it is more requiſite that the Maſters be puniſhed then the Schollers. Though Princes are not dayly enformed of the life of the Maſters as King Seleucus was: yet at the leaſt ofttimes they ought to enquire of the ſtate, of the life, and of the behauior both of the Maſters, and alſo of the children.
                     And this thing they ought not to doe onely once, but alſo they ought to call the Maſters, and counſel them likewiſe, that they haue great reſpect to the doctrine of their children, thinking alwayes to giue them good counſell, to ſhew vnto their Schollers afterwards: for otherwiſe the maſter immediately is diſcouraged, when hee ſeeth the Father to be negligent, and nothing carefull for the bringing vp of his children.
                     Princes in one thing ought to haue great reſpect (that is to ſay) leaſt the Maſters beare with the ſecret vices Tutors ought not to beare with the vices of theyr ſchollers. of children. And he ought not to doe thus, but alſo to call them vnto him, to aduiſe them, to warne them, to pray them, to counſell and commaund them, that they haue great reſpect to the bringing vp of his children: and further, that he giue them ſome notable counſell, to the entent that the Maſters afterward may make relation thereof to their ſchollers: for there is no man ſo weake, nor child ſo tender, but the force which hee hath to bee vicious, is enough (if hee will) to be vertuous.
                     I would now demaund the Maſters and Tutors which doe gouerne the children of noble and vertuous men, what more ſtrength is required to be a glutton then to be a ſobermā? to be a babler, or to be ſilent? to be diligent, or to be negligent? to be honeſt, then to be diſſolute? and as of theſe few I ſpeake, ſo I could recite many others. In this caſe I will not ſpeake as a man of ſcience, but as one of experience: and that is, that by the faith of a Chriſtian I ſweare, that with leſſe trauell of the Maſter, and more profite of the ſcholler, hee may bee ſooner vertuous then vicious. For there is no more courage required in one to be euill, then ſtrength in an other for to be good,
                     Alſo the Maſters commonly haue an other euill property, worſe then this, which is, they beare with theyr Schollers in ſome ſecret vices when they are young, from the which they cannot bee withdrawne afterwards when they are olde. For it chanceth oft times that the good inclination Cuſtome in ſinning is hardly to be reclaimed. is ouercome by euill cuſtome: and certainely the Maſters, which in ſuch a caſe ſhould be apprehended, ought to bee puniſhed as Traytors periured. For to the Maſter it is greater treaſon, to leaue his Diſciple among vices, then to deliuer a Fort into the hands of the enemies. And let no man maruell, if I call ſuch a Maſter a Traytor, for the one yeeldeth the Fort which is but of ſtones builded: but the other aduentureth his ſonne, who is of his proper body begotten.
                     The cauſe of all this euill is, that as the children of Princes ought to enherite Realmes, and the children of great Lords hope to enherite the great eſtates: ſo the Maſters are more couetous then vertuous. For they ſuffer their puples to runne at their owne wils when they be young, to the end to winne their harts when they ſhall be old: ſo that the extreme couetouſneſſe of the Maſters now a dayes is ſuch, that it cauſeth good mens ſonnes commonly to bee euill and vicious. O Tutors of princes, Schoolemaſters ought not to bee couetous. and Maſters of great Lords, I doe admoniſh you, and beſides that I counſell you, that your couetouſnes deceiue you not, thinking you ſhalbe better eſteemed for being clokers of

vices, then louers of vertues. For, there is none (olde or young) ſo wicked, but knoweth that good is better then euill.
                     And further, I may ſay to you in this caſe, that oft times God permitteth, (when thoſe that were children become olde) their eyes to be opened, whereby they knowe the harme that you haue don them, in ſuffering them to be vicious in their youth: at what time your duty had been to haue corrected theyr vices.
                     You thought (as it ſhould ſeeme) by your goods to be honoured for your flatterie: but you finde the contrary, that you are deſpiſed worthily. For it is the iuſt iudgement of GOD, that hee that committeth euill, ſhall not eſcape without puniſhment: and hee that concealeth the euill committed, ſhall not liue vndefamed.
                     
                        Diadumius the Hyſtoriographer, in the life of Seuerus the xxj. Emperour, declareth; that Apuleius Rufinus, who had beene Conſull twice, and at that time was alſo Tribune of the people (a man who was very aged, and likewiſe of great authoritie throughout Rome) came one day to the Emperour Seuerus, and ſaide vnto him in this ſort;
                     
                        Moſt inuict Prince, alwayes (Auguſtus,) knowe that I had two children, the 
                        The complaint of Apuleius Rufynus to the Emperour Seuerus. 
                        which I committed to a Maiſter, to bring vp: and by chaunce the oldeſt increaſing in yeares, and diminiſhing in vertues, fell in loue with a Romaine Ladie, the which loue came too late to my knowledge: For to ſuch vnfortunate men as I am, the diſeaſe is alwayes paſt remedie, before the daunger thereof commeth to our knowledge.
                     
                     
                        The greateſt griefe that herein I feele, is, that his Maiſter knewe and concealed the euill, and was not onely not a meanes to remedie it: but alſo was the chiefe worker of Adultery betweene them to be committed. And my Sonne made him an obligation, wherein he bound himſelfe, if he brought him that Romaine Ladie, hee would giue him (after my death) the houſe and Heritages, which I haue in the gate Salaria, and yet heerewith not contented, but he and my Sonne together, robbed me of much money. For loue is coſtly to him that maintaineth it, and alwayes the loues of the Children, are chargeable to the Fathers. Iudge you now therefore, Noble Prince, this ſo haynous and ſlaunderous cauſe: For it is too much preſumption of the ſubiect to reuenge any iniurie, knowing that the Lorde himſelfe will reuenge all wrongs.
                     
                     When the Emperour Seuerus had vnderſtood this ſo heynous a caſe: as one that was both in name and deede ſeuere, commaunded good inquiſition of the matter to be had: and that before his preſence they ſhould cauſe to appeare, the Father, the Sonne, and the Maiſter, to the ende eache one ſhould alledge for his own right: For in Rome none could bee condemned for any offence, vnleſſe the plaintife had firſt declared the fault before his preſence, and that the accuſed ſhould haue no time to make his excuſe.
                     The truth and certaintie (vpon due examination then knowne,) and the Offenders confeſſing the offences, the Emperor Seuerus gaue iudgmēt thus. I commaund that this Maiſter be caſt The ſentēce of the Emp: Seuerus. aliue among the beaſtes of the parke Palatine.
                     
                     For it is but meete that Beaſtes deuoure him, which teacheth others to liue like beaſts: Alſo I do command, that the Sonne be vtterly diſinherited of all the goods of his Father, and baniſhed the Countrey, into the Iſles of Baleares and Maiorques.
                     
                     For the Childe which from his youth is vicious, ought iuſtly to be baniſhed the Countrey, and be diſinherited of his Fathers goods.
                     This therefore (of the Maiſter, and the Sonne,) was done by the complainte of Apuleius Rufynus.
                     
                     
                        
O how vnconſtant fortune is, and how oft, not thinking of it, the thred of life doth breake. I ſay it, becauſe if this Maſter had not beene couetous, the Father had not been depriued What euil followed covetouſneſſe. of his ſonne, the childe had not beene baniſhed, the mother had not beene defamed, the common weale had not beene ſlaundered, the maſter of wilde beaſts had not been deuoured, neyther the Emperour had been ſo cruell againſt them, nor yet theyr names in Hiſtories, to their infamies, had alwayes continued,
                     I doe not ſpeake this without a cauſe, to declare by writing that which the euill doe in the World: for wiſemen ought more to feare the infamy of the little pen, then the ſlander of the babling tongue. For in the end, the wicked tongue cannot defame but the liuing: but the little penne doth defame them that are, that were, and that ſhall be.
                     To conclude this, my minde is, that the Maſter ſhould endeuour himſelfe that his Scholler ſhould bee vertuous, and that hee doe not deſpayre, though immediately for his paines hee bee not rewarded.
                     For though hee bee not of the creature, let him bee aſſured that hee ſhall be of the Creator. For God is ſo mercifull, that hee often times taking pitty of the ſwette of thoſe that bee good, chaſteneth the vnthankefull, and taketh vpon him to require their ſeruices.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXVIII. Of the determination of the Emperour, when he committed his childe to the Tutors, which hee had prouided for his education.
                     
                     
                        
                           CInna the Hiſtorian in the firſt booke of the times of Comodus declareth that Marcus Aurelius the Emperour choſe foureteene Maſters learned and wiſe men, to teach his ſon Comodus, of the which he refuſed fiue, not for that they were not wiſe, but for that they were not honeſt. And ſo hee kept theſe nine onely which were both learned in the Sciences, and alſo expert in bringing vp the children of the Senators, though indeed they were very vnluckie in the bringing vp of the Prince Comodus: for this curſed Prince had nine Maſters which inſtructed him, but hee had aboue nine thouſand vices wich vndid him.
                     The Emperour Marcus Aurelius made fiue books of declamations, and in the third booke the 6. Chapter vnder the title Adſapientes Pedagogos, hee brought in theſe nine Maſters, and perſwaded them greatly that they ſhould bee diligent and attentiue to teach his ſonne Comodus. And in this matter hee ſpake vnto them many and graue ſentences, the words whereof do follow.
                     The matter is manifeſt in Rome, The ſpeech of the Emperour to the nine Maſters of his ſonne Comodus. and no leſſe publiſhed thorow out all Italy, what paines I tooke to ſearch out ſo many Sages to inſtruct my ſonne Comodus: the which all being examined, I kept onely the wiſeſt and the beſt, and though in very deed, I haue done much, yet I haue not done

ſo much as I am bound.
                     For Princes in doubtfull matters ought not onely to demaund counſell of all the good that be aliue: but alſo to take paine to talke with thoſe which are dead. That is, to reade the deedes of the good in their writings: You were foureteene maſters choſen, whereof I haue put out fiue: ſo that preſently you are but nine, &amp; if indeede you bee Wiſe men, you ſhall not bee offended with that I haue done: for the griefe of euill things proceedeth of wiſdome, but the admiration of good things commeth of ſmall experience. I doe not deny, but the wiſe men doe feele in them paſſions as men: but in the end, there is no arte nor ſcience that doth excuſe vs from the miſeries of men.
                     But that whereat I maruell is, how it is poſſible that a wiſe man ſhould maruell at any thing in this world: For if the wiſe man ſhould be aſtonied at euery thing of the world, it appeareth that there is little conſtancy or vertue in him at all.
                     Returning therefore to our particular talke, I haue taken you to bee maſters of my ſonne, and you ſee, of many I choſe a few, to the end that with few my ſonne ſhould be taught: For as it is the Fathers duty to ſearch out good maſters; ſo it is the maſters duty to be diligent about his Scholler.
                     The Nurſe of my ſonne Comodus gaue him ſucke two yeares with her teates, at the gate of Hoſtia, and his mother Fauſtine other two yeares brought him vp wantonly in Capua. Howbeit this was a ſufficient excuſe, I would as a pittiful father (if I could) giue him correction at the leaſt this twenty yeares: For I ſweare by the immortall gods, that to a Prince that ſhall bee an enheritor, one yeeres puniſhment is more worth then twentie yeares of vaine pleaſure.
                     Since the Nurſes which giueth the Children ſucke knoweth little: and ſince the Mothers that bare them, doe loue them much, and ſince the childe peraduenture (as yet) is but of a weake vnderſtanding, they are occupyed about the thinges that are preſent: conſidering that chaſtiſemēt is much more better for him, then pleaſure. But the wiſe man which hath vnderſtanding ought to thinke of that, that The duty of euery good Father to prouide good inſtructors for their children. is paſt, and by much wiſdome to prouide for that which is to come: For he cannot be counted wiſe, tha

                         ſhall not forget the day that the Gods gaue him vnto me: nor yet this day in the which I commit him vnto you.
                     Of greater reaſon I ſhould remember that day wherein I put him to be taught: then the day which I ſaw him to be borne. For the Gods gaue him mee, as I gaue him to you mortall, ſince hee is a man: but you ſhall reſtore him againe vnto me; and I likewiſe him to the Gods, as immortall, if hee be wiſe.
                     What will you I ſay more vnto you, but if you regarde that any thing at all which I ſay, you will regarde much more this, which I will ſay. When the Gods determined that I ſhould haue a childe of my wife, and that my woful deſtenies deſerued, that I ſhold haue ſuch a childe, truely the Gods made me a man in the ſpirite: and I begote him a beaſt, among the beaſts in the fleſh. But if you will, you may make him a God among the Gods, by ſcience. For Princes winne infamie, for being fierce and ſelfe willed: but they get good renowne, for beeing wiſe and pacient. I would you ſhould applie this buſineſſe well, and therefore it is neceſſarie that you examine him oft. For it is a generall rule, that

the pretious iewell is little regarded, when hee which hath it knoweth not the value thereof.
                     I require, that you anſwere mee in this one thing. What did I giue vnto my ſonne Comodus, when the Gods gaue him mee, but fraile and mortall fleſh? by the corruption, whereof his life ſhall end: but you ſhall giue him high doctrine, whereby hee ſhall alwayes deſerue perpetuall memory: For the good renowne is not gotten by that the weake fleſh doth, but by that the high vnderſtanding imagineth, and by that the curious hart executeth. O if this tender age knew what I gaue to his weake fleſh, and if Good tutors compared to naturall Fathers. his dull vnderſtanding could come to the true wiſedome which you may giue him: he would call you his right fathers, and mee but his ſteppe father: For he is the true Father that giueth vs doctrine to liue: and hee is but an vniuſt ſtepfather that giueth vs fleſh to die.
                     Certainely, the naturall Fathers of children, are but their owne open enemies, and cruell ſtepfathers; ſince we giue them ſuch dull vnderſtanding, ſo weake a memory, a will ſo froward, life ſo ſhort, fleſh ſo frayle, honour ſo coſtly, health ſo vncertain, riches ſo troubleſome, proſperitie ſo ſcarce, and death ſo fearefull. Finally, wee giue them a Nature ſubiect to infinite alterations, and great miſfortunes.
                     Reaſon would not you ſhould little regarde that which I commit vnto your iudgement, that is to ſay, that you haue the charge of Comodus my ſonne: For the thing that Princes ought chiefly to foreſee, is to whome they ought to recommend the gouernement of their children.
                     To bee a Maſter and Tutour of a Prince in the earth, is to haue an office of the Gods which are in heauen: becauſe hee gouerneth him that ought to gouerne vs: he teacheth him that ought to teach vs, hee chaſtneth him that ought to chaſten vs. Finally, hee commaundeth one, that ought to command all.
                     What will you that I ſay more vnto you. Truely, hee that hath What is required in a good inſtructor of children. the charge to teach the children of Princes and great Lords, is as the Gouernour of the ſhippe, Standard of a Battell, a defence of the peovle, a guide of the Wayes, a father of the Orphanes, the hope of Pupils, and a Treaſurer of all: For there is no other true Treaſure in the Common wealth, but the prince which doth maintaine and keepe it in good peace, and perfect iuſtice.
                     I will tell you furthermore, to the end you ſhall eſteeme it more, that when I doe giue you my ſonne to teach, I giue you more then if I gaue you all the riches of the Realme. For in him that hath the reformation of the Childes life, dependeth the fame of the Father after that hee is dead.
                     So that the Father hath no greater renowme, then to ſee his Childe leade an honeſt life. I pray the gods that they may bee ſo mercifull, and the fatal deſtinies ſo fortunate, that if till this time you haue watched to teach the children of others, that frō hence forward you watch to teach this my ſonne Comodus, which I truſt ſhall be to the comfort of all.
                     For the thing which is vniuerſally good to all, ought for to bee preferred before that which tendeth but to the profite and commodity of ſome. You ſee my friends, that there is a greate difference to teach the children of Princes, and to teach the children of the people, and the cauſe hereof is, the greateſt part of thoſe come to ſchooles &amp; vniuerſities

to learne to ſpeake, but I do not giue Difference betweene the Teachers of Princes children &amp; others. you my ſonne Comodus, to the end you ſhould teach him to ſpeake many words, but that you ſhould learne him to doe good works.
                     For all the glory of the Princes is, that in the workes which he doth, he be vpright, and in the words that hee ſpeaketh he be very diſcreet. After that the children haue ſpent many yeares in Schooles, after their fathers haue ſpent much money vpon them if perchance the child can diſpute in Greeke or Latine any thing at all, though hee bee light and vicious, the Father thinketh his goods well imployed: for in Rome, now a dayes they eſteeme an Orator more, which can nought but babble, then a Philoſopher which is vertuous.
                     O wofull men, that now liue in Rome, and much more wofull ſhall thoſe be, which hereafter ſhall ſucceede: for Rome is no more that Rome, which it was wont to be, that is to ſay, that the Fathers in olde time ſent their children to Schooles and ſtudies to learne them to bee ſilent: and now they ſend them to learne to ſpeake too much.
                     They learned them then to bee ſage and temperate: and now they learne them to bee diſſolute. And the worſt of all is, that the Schooles where the ſage and patient were wont to be, and from whence iſſued the good and vertuous workes, are now ful of babling Orators, and none iſſue out from thence at this preſent, but the euill and vitious. So that if the ſacred Romane lawes are exalted once in a weeke with their tongs: they are broken ten times in the day, in their works.
                     What will you I ſay more, ſince I cannot tell you any thing (without hurting my mother Rome) but that at this preſent all the pleaſures of vaine men, is to ſee their children ouercome others by diſputing: but I let you vnderſtand that all my glory ſhall bee, when my ſonne ſhall ſurmount others, not in words, but in What is required in a Scholler. ſilence, not to be troubleſome, but to bee patient: not in ſpeaking ſubtill words, but in doing vertuous works. For the glory of good men is in working much, and ſpeaking little. Conſider my friends, and doe not forget it, that this day I commit my honor vnto you, I put into your hands the eſtate of Comodus my ſonne, the glory of Rome, the reſt of the people, which are my ſubiects, the gouernement of Italie, which is our Country, and aboue all, I referre vnto your diſcretion, the peace and tranquility of the whole common wealth.
                     Therefore hee that hath ſuch a charge, by reaſon ought not to ſleep: for as the wiſe men ſay, To great truſt is required much diligence. I will ſay no more, but that I would my ſonne Comodus ſhould be ſo wel taught, that he ſhould haue the feare of God, &amp; the ſcience of Philoſophers, the vertues of the ancient Romanes, the approued counſell of the aged, the courage of the Romane youth, the conſtancy of you, which are his Maſters.
                     Finally, I would, that of all the good, he ſhould take the good, as of me hee ought to take the heritage &amp; ſucceſſion of the Empire; For hee is the true prince, and worthy of the Empire, that with his eyes doth behold the great Signiories he ought to inherite, and doth employ his heart how to gouerne it, whereby hee ſhall liue to the great profite of the Common wealth.
                     And I proteſt to the immortall Gods, with whom I hope to goe, and to the goodneſſe of my predeceſſors whoſe faith I am bound to keepe. I proteſt to the Romane lawes, the which I did ſweare to obſerue in the

conqueſt of Aſia, wherein I am bound my ſelfe to continue, and to the friendſhippe of the Rhodians, the which I haue offered my ſelfe for to keepe, to the enmitie of the Affricanes, the which not for me, but for the oath of my predeceſſors, I bound my ſelfe to maintaine. And I proteſt vnto the veſſell of the high Capitoll, where my bones ought to bee burnt, that Rome doe not complaine of mee, beeing aliue, nor that The earefulnes of the Emperour for the Commonwealth. in the world to come ſhee curſe mee after my death.
                     If perchance the prince Comodus my ſonne (by his wicked life) ſhould bee occaſion of the loſſe or hinderance of the Common-Wealth.
                     And though you which are his Maſters vndoe it, for not giuing him due puniſhment, and hee thorow his wicked gouernement deſtroy it, yet I diſcharge my ſelfe by all theſe proteſtations that I haue made, which ſhall bee witneſſes of my will.
                     For the Father is bound no more towardes his Childe, but to baniſh him from his pleaſures, and to giue him vertuous Maſters. And if hee bee good, hee ſhall bee the glory of the Father, the honour of himſelfe, the wealth of you, and the profite and commodity of the whole Common wealth.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXIX. The Tutors of Princes and Noble mens children ought to be very circumſpect that their Schollers doe not accuſtome themſelues in vices whiles they are young, and ſpecially they muſt keepe them from foure vices,
                     
                     
                        THe good and expert Surgeons vnto great daungerous wounds, doe not onely apply medicins and ointments which do reſolue and ſtoppe: but alſo miniſter other good playſters for to reſtraine and heale them. And verily they ſhew themſelues in the one no leſſe ſage, then in the other expert: for as great diligence ought to bee had to preſerue the weake fleſh, &amp; to purge the rotten wound, to the end it may be healed: ſo likewiſe the wiſe Trauellers learne diligently the way before they take vpon them any iourney; that is to ſay, if there bee any dangers in the way, eyther of robbing or ſlaying, wherein there is any by-path that goeth out of the highway.
                     Truly, hee that in this point is circumſpect, is worthy to bee counted a Sage mam: for according to the multitude of the perilles of the world, none can be aſſured, vnleſſe hee know firſt where the daunger is, wherein hee may fall. To ſhew therfore that which by theſe parables I meane, I ſay, that the Tutours and Maſter of Princes and great Lordes, ought not to bee contented onely to know what ſcience, what doctrine, and what vertue they ought to ſhew, and teach their Schollers: but alſo with greater care and diligence they

ought to know from what euilles or wicked cuſtomes they ought to withdraw them: For when the trees are Children in their youth apt to entertain all vices. tender and young, it is more neceſſary to bow them, and cut off the ſuperfluous branches with kniues, then to gather their fruits with baskets.
                     Thoſe which take vpon them to gouerne Moyles of great price and value, and thoſe that tame &amp; breake horſes of a good race, take great paines that ſuch beaſts be light, that they leape well, and be well made to the ſpurre and bridle: but they take much more paines that they be gentle, familiar and faithfull; and aboue all, that they haue no euill qualities. Then ſith it is ſo, Maſters ought diligently to watch (if they bee good) that in young Princes there be no apparance of any notable vices: for the vertues which the young doe learn, doth not them ſo much profite, as one onely vice doth them hurt, if they doe thereunto conſent, knowing that thereby they may bee hereafter blamed or deſpiſed: For if any man knew a beaſt that is wilde and ſtubborne, and not gentle, and will buye him at a great price: ſuch a one hath his head more full of follies then of wiſedome.
                     Albeit that Maſters ought to withdraw their Schollers from many euill cuſtomes, amongſt all there are foure principals, in any of the which, if the Prince bee defamed, the maſter which hath taught him ſhould deſerue great puniſhment: For according to the humane Lawes and Cuſtomes, all the damage and harme, that the beaſts doe to the vineyarde the keeper that hath charge thereof, ſhall (as he is bound) recompence.
                     Firſt, the Maſter ought to reform in ſuch ſort the tongus of their ſchollers, that neyther in ſport nor in earneſt, they permit them to tell lyes: for the greateſt fault that is in a good and vertuous man, is to bee briefe in the truth, and the greateſt villany, that is in a vicious man, is to bee long in lyes. Merula in that 5. booke of Caeſars 
                        What is required in the maſter towards his Schollers. ſayeth, that the firſt warre that Vlpius Traianus made, was againſt the Romanes, and with no ſmall victory ouercame the Emperour Domitian in a battell which they fought together: for as Nafica ſayde, the pleaſures that Rome had to ſee many victories were not ſo great: as the diſpleaſure was which ſhe tooke, to ſee her ſelfe once ouercome.
                     The good Vlpius Traianus gaue battell to king Cebalus, wherein Cebalus was not onely ouercome, but alſo taken, and afterwardes brought before the Emperor Traianus, which ſayde vnto him theſe words. Speake Cebalus, Why diddeſt thou rebell againſt the Romaines, ſince thou knoweſt that the Romanes are inuincible: King Cebalus anſwered him, If the Romans could not bee ouercome, how then did I ouercome the Emperour Domitian?
                     
                        Traian the Emperour ſayde vnto him againe: Thou art greatly deceyued (King Cebalus) to thinke that when thou ouercameſt the Emperor, thou hadſt ouercome the Romanes: For when that Romulus founded Rome, the Gods ordained, that though their Emperour dyed in any battell, yet notwithſtanding it is not to bee thought, that the Empire is ouercome.
                     
                     The Hiſtoriographers made a great matter of the words that this Vlpius Traianus ſpake: for therin he ſhewed, that the Rom: Empire was invincible.
                     After that this King Cebalus was dead, and that (for his deſerts) hee was depriued: as the Emperour Traian was a mercifull Prince, ſo hee prouided that a little child that Cebalus had, ſhould bee brought vp in his Palace, with intention, that if the Child became good, they would giue him the Realme which his Father,

(through treaſon) had loſt.
                     For in Rome there was an auncient Law, that all which the Father loſt, by reaſon the ſonne ſhould recouer by his faithfull acts An ancient Law in Rome..
                     It chaunced that the good Traian taking his pleaſure in the garden of Vulcan, ſaw the ſonne of King Cebalus and many other young children of Rome, ſtealing fruit foorth of an Orchard; and it is no wonder, for the Locuſtes did not ſo much harme to the corne, as the children do to the fruites, when they enter into the Orchards.
                     When the Emperour afterwardes demaunded him from whence hee came? hee anſwered, from his ſtudy hearing Rethorike, but indeed hee came from ſtealing of fruit. The Emperour Traian was ſo angry and diſpleaſed that the child was a lyer, that he commanded he ſhould vtterly be depriued and made voide of all hope, to recouer the Realme of his Father.
                     The Emperour Traian was greatly importuned, as wel of ſtrange Ambaſſadours, as of his owne countrimen that he would change that cruell ſentence, For Princes in a fury doe commaund that, which when they are patient they doe vndo. The A cruell ſentence vpon a lyer. Emperour Traian anſwered them, if the Father of this child which was King Cebalus had been a true Prince, he had not loſt his life, neyther his Realme, nor had not put mee, and the Empire ſo many times in daunger: but ſince the Father was a lyer, and the ſonne is not true, it were too vniuſt a thing to render him the Realme. For to me it ſhould be great reproach, and to our mother Rome, as much diſhonour, that ſhee being the mother of truth, ſhould giue Realmes to children beeing lyers,
                     This was it that Vlpius Traian ſpake vnto the ſonne of King Cebalus. Marcus Aurelius the 17. Emperour of Rome had two ſonnes, as before we haue rehearſed, the eldeſt of the which was called Comodus, and his father procured greatly to diſhen herite him of the Empire: for hee would that the ſecond ſonne named Veriſsimus ſhould haue enherited it: and hee did not onely determine it, but alſo ſpake it oft times openly: For that thing is with great difficulty diſſembled, that exceſſiuely is beloued.
                     By chance an olde Senator, and friend of Marcus Aurelius the Emperour one day, both going out of the Senate houſe, ſayde vnto him: I maruell at thee, moſt Excellent Prince Why thou doeſt diſhenherite thy ſonne 
                        The ſpeech of a Senator to the Emperour. 
                        which is eldeſt, to make thine Heyre the youngeſt, knowing that they are both thy ſonnes, and that the gods haue giuen thee no other but them: For the good Fathers are bound to chaſten their children but they haue not licence to diſhenherite them.
                     
                     The Emperour Marcus Aurelius anſwered him, If thou wert a Greeke Philoſopher, as thou ort a Romane Citizen, and if thou knoweſt tke fathers 
                        The Emperours anſwere. 
                        loue towards the child, thou wouldeſt not take pitty on my ſonne which vndoeth the Empire: but thou ſhouldeſt haue compaſsion on me his Father, which doth diſhenherite him: For the child ſcarcely knoweth what hee looſeth, but I that am his Father doe bewayle the dammage which I doe vnto him. For in the end, there is not in the world ſo cruell a Father, but if his ſonne ſhould bee hurt with the pomell of the ſword in the hand, the Father would feele (incontinently) the dent of his blade at his heart.
                     
                     
                        In this caſe I ſweare vnto thee by the immortall Gods, that I do that which I would not doe: and I take that from him which I would not take, For Anthonius my Lord, and Father in law,
                        
                        gaue mee the Empire for no other cauſe, but becauſe hee neuer found in mee any lye: and for this occaſion I doe depriue my ſonne from it, for that I neuer found in him any truth. For it is not meete that the Empire beeing giuen vnto me for that I was true: ſhould bee left in heritage to him that is a lyer: For in the ende it is better that the ſonne doe looſe the heritage, then the father ſhould looſe his renowne.
                     
                     By theſe two examples, thoſe How carefull maſters ought to be to refraine their ſchollers from lying and gaming. which are the tutors and maſters of Princes and great Lordes may ſee, how to bee diligent to keepe them from lyes, whileſt they are yong, and it ought to be in ſuch ſort, that neyther in paſtime, neyther in earneſt anſwering they ſhould bee ſuffered to tell a lye: For thoſe that for their pleaſures were accuſtomed to lye in their youth, will not fayle for their profite to lye in their age.
                     Secondarily, the Tutours and Maſters ought to keepe their Diſciples, that they bee no gameſters, &amp; that they doe not accuſtome themſelues in their youth to bee vnthrifts: for it is a great token of the decay of the Empire, when the Prince in his youth is affectionated to play.
                     Experience ſheweth vs, that to play is a vice, as Seneca ſaieth, which hath the property of a raging dogge: with whom if a man bee once bitten, (vnleſſe hee hath preſent remedie) forthwith he runneth mad, and the diſeaſe alſo continueth with him vncurable vntill the houre of his death:
                     Players not without a cauſe are compared to madde dogges: for al thoſe that vſe it, hurt their conſcience, looſe their honour, and conſume their ſubſtance.
                     It chaunceth oft that in that wherein Maſters ſhould bee moſt circumſpect, they for the moſt part, are moſt negligent: that is to ſay, that vnder the colour of ſome honeſt recreation, they agree to their Schollers to vſe ſome paſtime, which if therein bee contained no commendable exerciſe, the children ought not to vſe it, nor yet the tutors to ſuffer it: for vice is of ſuch a propertie, that if a childe in his youth dare play a point, it is to bee feared when he commeth to yeares, hee will play his coate.
                     Waying the matter more deeply, and aggrauating this vice, I ſay further, and affirme, that when the children of Princes and great Lords play, a man ought not to make account of that which they may winne or looſe: for that of all miſeries were moſt miſerie, if therefore my penne ſhould forbidde them play. For play ought not to be forbidden to young children, for the money that they loſe; but for the vices which they winne thereby, and for the corrupt manners which therein they doe learne.
                     
                        Octauian, who was the ſecond Emperour of Rome, and one of the fortunateſt Emperours that euer was, among all his vertues was noted of one thing onely, which is, that from his youth he was much giuen to play at tennis. Of the which vice hee was not onely admoniſhed ſecretly, but alſo was forbidden it openly. For as Cicero ſayeth in his booke of Lawes, when the Emperour was noted of any open vice, they might boldly reproue him in the open Senate.
                     When Octauian was for this vice reproued by the Senate, they ſayde hee ſpake theſe wordes: You haue reaſon (O Fathers conſcript) in taking from me my paſtime: for it is The ſpeech of the Emperour Octauian. neceſſary that the vertues of Princes ſhould be ſo many, that al men might prayſe them, and their vices ſo fewe, that no man might reproue them.
                     Theſe wordes were notable, &amp; worthy of ſuch a rare and excellent

Prince. For in the end, conſidering their delicate and wanton bringing vp, together with the liberty that they haue: Wee ought to thanke and commend them for the good workes which they doe, and moſt of all to reioyce for the vices which they want.
                     To our matter therefore, amongſt the other wicked vices that children gette in their youth, when they are players: This is one: that they learne to bee theeues and lyers: For the money that they playe, to demaund it their Fathers they are afrayde and aſhamed: and of theyr owne proper goods, as yet they haue none in their hands.
                     Wherefore a man may eaſily conclude, tha
                           •
                         if children play, of neceſſitie they muſt ſteale.
                     The ſixe and thirtieth Emperor of Rome, was Claudius Luganus, a man very temperate in eating, moderate in apparrell, vpright in iuſtice, and very fortunate in chiualry: for he did not onely repulſe the Gothes from Illyria, but alſo vanquiſhed in a batrell the Germaines, wherin were ſlaine aboue a hundred thouſand.
                     This battell was neere vnto the Lake Verucus, in a place called Luganus, and for a memory of that great battell and victory, they called him Claudius Luganus.
                     
                     For it was a cuſtome among the Romaines, that according to the good or euill workes that Princes did, ſo they were iudged, and know by ſuch ſurnames, whether it were good or euill.
                     This Emperour had but one onely ſonne, which was a prince of comely perſonage, and liuely of vnderſtanding: but aboue all things giuen to play; ſo that theſe good gifts which nature gaue him to work in vertue, he miſuſed alwayes in play. And amongſt young men he deſired rather to haunt vice, then among the Philoſophers to learne vertue.
                     And hereat a man ought not to maruell, for all men of great courage (vnleſſe they be compelled to do vertuous acts) doe exerciſe of themſelues many deteſtable vices.
                     It chaunced when this young prince had no more to play nor gage, he robbed out of his Fathers chamber a rich Iewell of golde, whereof alſo his Maſter was priuie. And when the knowledge thereof came to the Emperours eates, hee immediately diſhenherited his ſonne of the Empire, and cauſed the head of the Maſter The ſentence of the Emperour vpon the Prince and his maſter. to bee cut off his body, and all thoſe likewiſe that played with him to be baniſhed the Countrey. This act made euery man afrayde, for correction executed after a good ſorte, hath this property, that it encourageth the good to be good, and feareth the wicked from their wickedneſſe.
                     
                        Merula in the tenth booke of Caeſars (whereas at large hee mentioneth this matter) ſayeth, that the Romaines eſteemed more the baniſhment of thoſe players from Rome, then to haue drouen out the Gothes from Illyria, and to ſay the trueth, they had reaſon: For a prince deſerueth a greater growne of glory to baniſh the vitious from his palace, then hee doeth for chaſing the enemies out of his dominion.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XL. ¶ Of two other vices, perillous in Youth, which the Maiſters ought to keepe them from: and that is to bee ſhameleſſe in countenance, and addicted to wickedneſſe, and the luſts of the Fleſh.
                     
                     
                        THirdlie; Tutours ought to trauel, that that the Children which they haue in charge, be not light &amp; worldly: nor that they do conſent that they be bolde or ſhameleſſe. And I ſay, that they doe not ſuffer them to be light or vnconſtant: For of young men vnconſtant and light, commeth oftentimes an olde man, fonde, and vnthriftie. I ſay, that they doe not ſuffer them to be too raſhe: For of too hardie young men, commeth rebellious and ſeditious perſons. I ſay that they doe not conſent they bee ſhameles: For, of the vnſhamefaſtnes, commeth ſlaunderous perſons.
                     Princes and great Lords ought to haue much care and circumſpection, that their Children bee brought vp in ſhamefaſtnes with honeſtie. For, the What is required in great mens Children crowne doth not giue ſo much glorie to a King, nor the head doth more ſet forth the man, nor the precious jewell more adorne the breaſt, nor yet the regal Scepter more become the hand, then ſhamefaſtnes with honeſty, beautifieth a young man. For, a man of what eſtate ſoeuer hee be, the honeſty which hee ſheweth outwardly, doeth moſt commonly hyde many ſecret vices, wherewith he is indued inwardly.
                     In the time of the reigne of the Emperour Helyus Pertinax, (the nineteenth Emperour of Rome) two Conſulls gouerned the Common-wealth: the one was named Verut, and the other Mamillus.
                     
                     One day they came vnto the Emperour, and were humble ſuiters to his Highneſſe: beſeeching him, that it would pleaſe him to accept, and receyue their two children into his ſeruice, the eldeſt of the which paſſed not as yet twelue yeares of age: the which requeſt, after the Emperour had graunted, the Fathers were not negligent to bring them vnto him; and beeing come before his preſence, eache of them made an oration, the one in Latine, and the other in Greeke. Wherewith the Emperour was greatly pleaſed, and all the reſidue amazed: For at that time none ſerued the Romaine Princes, but hee that was very apte to Chiualrie, or very toward in Sciences.
                     As theſe two Children in the preſence of the Emperour made their orations, the one of them behelde the Emperour in ſuch ſorte, that his eyes neuer went off him, neither once mouing his head, to looke downe to the earth: and the other contrarie, behelde the earth alwayes, and neuer lift vp his head during his oration.
                     Wherewith the Emperour (beeing a graue man) was ſo highly pleaſed with the demeanours of this Childe, that hee did not onely admit him for to ſerue him at his Table, but alſo hee ſuffered him to enter into his Chamber; and this was a preferment of great eſtimation: For Princes did not The reward of ſhamefaſtnes. vſe to be ſerued at their Tables, nor in their chambers with any, vnleſſe they were of his owne Kinred, or auncient Seruants.
                     And concerning the other childe, which was his companion, the Emperour returned againe to his father, ſaying: That when hereafter hee ſhould bee more ſhamefaſte, hee would receyue him into his ſeruice. And certainely, the Emperour had great reaſon: for good &amp; graue Princes ought

not to be ſerued with light &amp; ſhameleſſe children.
                     I would now demaund Fathers which loue their children very well, and would they ſhould bee worthy: what it auayleth their children to be faire of countenance, wel diſpoſed of body, liuely of ſpirit, white of skinne, to haue yellow hayres, to bee eloquent in ſpeech, profound in ſcience: if with all theſe graces that nature giueth them, they bee too bolde in that they doe, and ſhameles in that they ſay: The Author hereof is Patritius Senenſis, in the firſt booke De Rege et regno.
                     
                     One of the moſt fortunate princes was the great Theodoſius, the which amongſt all other vertues, had one moſt ſingular, the which was, that Commendation of the Empeperour The odoſius. hee was neuer ſerued in his pallace with any young man that was vnſhamefaſt, or ſeditious nor with any olde man which was diſhoneſt: for he ſayde oft times that Princes ſhall neuer bee well beloued, if they haue about them lyers or ſlaunderers.
                     This good Emperour ſpake as a man of experience, and very ſage: for if the Councellers and familiars of Princes bee euill taught and vnpatient, they offend many: and if they bee lyers, they deceyue al, and if they be diſhoneſt they ſlaunder the people. And theſe offences bee not ſo great vnto them that commit them, as they bee vnto the Prince which ſuffereth them.
                     The Emperour Theodoſe had in his palace two Knights, the one called Ruffinus, and the other Stelliconus, by whoſe prudence and wiſedome the Common wealth was ruled and gouerned. And as Ignatius Baptiſta ſayeth, they two were the Tutours and Gouernours of the children of Theodoſe, whoſe names were Archadius and Honorius: for as Seneca ſaith, When good Princes doe die, they ought to bee more carefull to procure Maſters and Tutours which ſhall teach their children, then to procure realmes or kingdomes for to enrich them.
                     
                     The two Maſters Stelliconus and Ruffinus had in the palace of Theodoſe each of them a ſonne, the which were maruellous well taught, and very ſhamefaſt: and for the contrary, the two Princes Honorius and Arcadius were euill mannered, and not very honeſt. And therefore the good A memorable thing of the Emperour Theodoſius. Emperour Theodoſe tooke theſe children oft times, and ſet them at his Table: and contrary, hee would not once behold his owne.
                     Let no man maruel though a Prince of ſuch a grauity, did a thing of ſo ſmall importance: for to ſay the truth, the ſhamefaſt children, and well taught are but robbers of the hearts of other men.
                     Fourthly, the Tutors and Maſters of Princes ought to take good heed, that when the young princes their Schollers waxe great, that they giue not themſelues ouer to the wicked vice of the fleſh, ſo that the ſenſuality and euill inclination of the wanton child, ought to bee remoued by the wiſedome of the chaſte Maſter. For this curſed fleſh is of ſuch condition, that if once by wantonnes the wicket be opened, death ſhall ſooner approch, then the gate ſhall be ſhut againe.
                     The trees which budde and caſt leaues before the time, our hope is neuer to eate of their fruit in ſeaſon. I meane, that when children haunt the vice of the fleſh, whiles they be yong: there is ſmall hope of goodneſſe to bee looked for in them when they be olde.
                     And the elder we ſee them waxe, the more wee may be aſſured of their vices. And where wee ſee that vice encreaſeth, there wee may affirme

that vertue diminiſheth.
                     
                        Plato in his ſecond booke of laws ordayneth and commaundeth, that young men ſhould not marry before they were 25. yeares of age, and the The ordinances of Plato. young maydens at 20. becauſt at that age their fathers abide leſſe dangers in begetting them, &amp; giuing of them life, and the children alſo which are borne, haue more ſtrength againſt the aſſaults of death. Therefore if it bee true (as it is true indeed) I aske now, if to bee married and get children (which is the end of marriage) the Philoſophers doe not ſuffer vntill ſuch time as they bee men: then I ſay, that Maſters ought not to ſuffer their ſchollers to haunt the vices of the fleſh when they bee children. In this caſe, the good fathers ought not alone to commit this matter to their Tutors, but alſo thereunto to haue an eye themſelus. For oft times they will ſay, they haue been at their deuotions in the Temples, when in deed they haue offered veneriall ſacrifice to the Curtezan.
                     The vice of the fleſh is of ſuch condition, that a man cannot giue Young mē ought to abſtaine from the vice of the fleſh. himſelfe vnto it, without grudge of Conſcience, without hurt of his renowne, without loſſe of his goods, without ſhortning of his life, and alſo without offence to the Commonwealth: for oft times, men enclined to ſuch vice, doe rebell, trouble and ſlaunder the people. Seneca ſatisfied me greatly, in the which he writeth in the ſecond booke De Clementia to Nero, where hee ſayeth theſe words: If I knew the Gods would pardon me, and alſo that men would not hate mee: yet I enſure thee for the vilenes therof, I would not ſinne in the fleſh.
                     
                     And truly Seneca had reaſon, for Ariſtotle ſayeth, That all Beaſtes after the act of Venerie are ſorry, but the Cocke alone.
                     
                     O Gouernours, and Maſters of great Princes and Lords, by the immortal Gods I ſweare, which created vs, I coniure you, and for that you owe to the Nobility I deſire you that you will bridle with a ſharpe ſnafle your charge, and giue them not the reine to follow vices: for if theſe young children liue, they will haue time ynough to ſearch, to follow, to attaine, and alſo to caſt off thoſe yokes: for through our frailety, this wicked vice of the fleſh, in euery place, in all ages, in euery eſtate, and at all times (bee it by reaſon, or not) is neuer out of ſeaſon. What ſhall I ſay to you in this caſe? if the children paſſe the furiouſnes of their youth without the bridle, then they bee voyde of the loue of God, they follow the trumpet of ſenſuality, after the ſound whereof they runne headlong into the yoake, and looſe that that profiteth, to win that which hurteth? For in the carnall vices he that hath the leaſt of that which ſenſuality deſireth, hath much more therof then reaſon willeth. Conſidering that the Maſters are negligent, the children bolde, their vnderſtandings blinded, and ſeeing that their appetites do accompliſh beaſtly motions, I aske now what remayneth to the childe, and what contentation hath hee of ſuch filth and naughtineſſe? Truly, ſince the fleſhly and vicious man is ouercome with his appetite, of thoſe that What inconueniēce followeth the fleſhly minded man. eſcape beſt, I ſee none other fruit, but that their bodies remaine diſeaſed, and their vnderſtanding blinded, their memory dulled, their ſenſe corrupted, their will hurted, their reaſon ſubuerted, and their good fame loſt, and worſt of all, the fleſh remaineth alwayes fleſh.
                     O how many young men are deceyued, thinking that for to ſatiſfie and by once engaging themſelues to vices, that from that time forwarde they ſhall ceaſe to bee vicious, the

which thing not onely doth not profite them, but alſo is very hurtfull vnto them: For fire is not quenched with drye wood, but with cold water.
                     But O God, what ſhall wee doe, ſince that now a dayes, the Fathers doe as much eſteeme their children for being fine, and bolde minions among women, as if they were verie profound in ſcience, or hardie in feates of Armes? and that which is worſt, they oft times make more of their baſtards gotten in adulterie, then of their legitimate childe conceiued in matrimony.
                     What ſhall wee ſay then of mothers? Truely I am aſhamed for to A good leſſon for Parents. ſpeake it, but they ſhould bee more aſhamed to doe it, which is, becauſe they would not diſpleaſe their huſbands, they hide the wickedneſſe of their children; they put the children of their harlots to the Nurſe, they redeeme their gages, they giue them money to play at dice, they reconcile them to their fathers when they haue offended, they borrow them money to redeeme them when they are indebted.
                     Finally, they are makers of their bodies, and vndoers of their ſoules. I ſpeake this inſidently, for that the maſters would correct the children, but the Fathers and mothers forbid them. For it little auayleth for one to pricke the horſe with the ſpurre, when hee that ſitteth vpon him holdeth him back with the bridle. Therfore to our matter, what ſhall we do to remedy this ill in the young man: which in his fleſh is vicious? Truely I ſee no other remedie, but with the moiſt earth to quench the flaming fire, and to keepe him from the occaſions of vice.
                     For in the warre, honour, by tarrying is obtained: but in the vice of the fleſh, the victory by flying is obtayned.

                  THE THIRD BOOKE OF THE DIALL OF PRINCES, WITH THE FAMOVS BOOKE OF MARCVS AVRELIVS, WHERE HEE entreateth of the vertues which Princes ought to haue, as Iuſtice, Peace, and Magnificence.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. I. How Princes and great Lordes ought to trauell to adminiſter to all equall iuſtice.
                     
                     
                        
                           EGidius Frigulus, one of the moſt famous and renowmed Philoſophers of Rome, ſayde, that that betweene two of the Zodaicall ſignes (Leo and Libra) is a Virgine named Iuſtice: the which in times paſt dwelled among men in earth, and after that ſhee was of them neglected, ſhee aſcended vp to Heauen.
                     This Philoſopher would let vs vnderſtand, that Iuſtice is ſo excellent a vertue, that ſhe paſſeth al mens capacitie: ſince ſhee made heauen her manſion place, and could finde no man in the whole earth that wold entertaine her in his houſe.
                     During the time they were chaſte, gentle, pittifull, patient, embracers The excellency of vertue. of vertue, honeſt and true: Iuſtice remayning in the earth with them: but ſince they are conuerted vnto adulterers, tyrants, giuen to be proud, vnpatient, lyers, and blaſphemers, ſhee determined to forſake them, and to aſcend vp into heauen. So that this Philoſopher concluded, that for the wickedneſſe that men commit on earth, Iuſtice hath leapt from them into Heauen.
                     Though this ſeeme to bee a Poeticall fiction, yet it comprehendeth in it high and profound doctrine, the which ſeemeth to be very cleare, for where wee ſee iuſtice, there are few theeues, few murderers, few tirants, and few blaſphemers.
                     Finally, I ſay, that in the houſe or Common wealth where Iuſtice

remaineth, a man can not committe vice, and much leſſe, diſſemble with the vicious.
                     
                        Homer deſirous to exalt juſtice, could not tell what to ſay more, but to call Kings, the children of the great God Iupiter: and that not for that naturalty they haue, but for the office of iuſtice, which they miniſter. So that Homer concludeth, that a man ought not to call iuſt Princes other, but the children of God.
                     The diuiue Plato, in the fourth booke of his common-wealth, ſaieth: that the chiefeſt gift God gaue to men is, that they being (as they be) of ſuch vile clay, ſhould bee gouerned by juſtice.
                     I would to GOD, all thoſe which reade this wryting, vnderſtoode right well that which Plato ſaid: For, if men were not indued with reaſon, and gouerned by iuſtice: amongſt all beaſts none were ſo vnprofitable.
                     Let reaſon be taken from man, wherwith he is indued, and iuſtice whereby he is gouerned: then ſhall men eaſily perceyue in what ſort he will leade his life. He cannot fight as the Elephant, nor defend himſelfe as the Tygre, nor he can hunte as the Lyon, neither labour as the Oxe: and that wherby he ſhould profite (as I thinke) is, that he ſhould eate Beares and Lyons, in his life, as now he ſhall be eaten of worms after his death.
                     All the Poets that inuented fictions, all the Oratours which made Orations, How vile man were if Iuſtice were wanting. all the Philoſophers which wrote books, all the Sages which left vs their doctrines, and all the Princes which inſtituted Lawes, meant nothing elſe, but to perſwade vs to think how briefe and vnprofitable this life is, and how neceſſary a thing iuſtice is therin. For the filth and corruption which the bodie hath without the ſoule: the ſelfe ſame hath the common-wealth without iuſtice.
                     Wee cannot denye but that the Romaines haue been prowde, enuious, adulterers, ſhameleſſe, and ambicious: but yet with all theſe faultes, they haue beene great obſeruers of iuſtice. So that if God gaue them ſo manie Triumphs, beeing loaden and enuironed with ſo many vices: it was not for the vertues they had, but for the great iuſtice which they did adminiſter.
                     
                        Plinie in his ſecond booke ſaith, that Democrites affirmed, there were two gods, which gouerned the vniuerſall world: that is to ſay: Reward, and Puniſhment. Whereby wee may gather, that nothing is more neceſſarie, then true and right iuſtice. For, the one rewardeth the good, and the other, leaueth not vnpuniſhed the euill.
                     
                        Saint Auſtine, in the firſt Booke De Ciuitate Dei, ſaieth theſe words: Iuſtice taken away, what are Realmes, but dennes of Theeues? Truely hee had great reaſon. For, if there were no Nothing mor profitable to the Common-wealth then true luſtice. whips for vagabonds: gags for blaſphemers: fines for periurie: fires for heretiques: ſword for murderers: galowes for theeues: nor priſons for Rebells: we may boldly ſay, there would not bee ſo many Beaſts on the mountains, as there would be thieues in the Common-wealth.
                     In many things, or in the greateſt parte of the commonwealth, wee ſee that Bread, Wine, Corn, Fiſh, Wool, and other things neceſſary for the life of the people wanteth: but we neuer ſaw but malicious men in euery place did abound. Therefore I ſweare vnto you, that it were a good bargaine to chaunge all the wicked men in the commonwealth, for one onely poore ſheepe in the fielde.
                     In the Common-wealth wee ſee nought elſe but whipping daylie, beheading, ſlaying, drowning, &amp; hanging: but notwithſtanding this, the wicked which remaine ſtill, are ſo manie in number, that if all thoſe ſhould be hanged that deſerue it by Iuſtice;

a man could hardly finde hang-men ſufficient, nor gallowes to hang them vpon.
                     Admit according to the varietie of realmes and prouinces, that diuers lawes and cuſtomes haue beene inſtituted therein: yet for a truth there was neuer, nor ſhall bee found any nation or Common wealth in the No nation ſo barbarous, but it founded of inſtice. world ſo barbarous, but hath beene founded of iuſtice: For to affirme that men can bee preſerued without iuſtice, is as much as to ſay, the fiſh can liue without water. How is it poſſible that a Common Wealth may liue without iuſtice, ſith without her cannot bee ruled one onely perſon?
                     
                        Plinie in an Epiſtle ſayeth, that he himſelffe hauing the charge of a prouince in Affricke, demaunded an old man, and in gouernement expert, what he might doe to adminiſter iuſtice? the aged man anſwered: Doe iuſtice of thy ſelfe, if thou wilt be a miniſter thereof: For the good iudge, with the right yeard of his owne life, ought to meaſure the whole ſtate of the common-wealth. And hee ſayde further, If thou wilt be right with men, and cleane before God, beware of preſumption in thine office: For the proud and preſumptuous Iudges oftentimes doe contrarie to their wordes, and alſo exceede in their deedes.
                     
                     
                        Plinie alſo ſayeth, that hee profited more with the counſell this olde man gaue him, then with all that euer he had read in his bookes. O to how much is hee bound that hath taken vpon him to adminiſter Iuſtice? For if ſuch a one be an vpright man, hee accompliſheth that where vnto hee is bound: but if ſuch a one of himſelf be vniuſt, iuſtly of God hee ought to be puniſhed, and likewiſe of men to bee accuſed.
                     When great Princes commaund their ſeruants or Subiects any thing, &amp; that they cannot accompliſh them in ſuch ſort as they had charge to do: then he ought to haue them excuſed, thoſe excepted, which gouern realms and prouinces: for no man leaueth to adminiſter iuſtice, but for want of knowledge or experience: or elſe through aboundance of affection or malice If a Captaine loſe a battel he may excuſe himſelfe ſaying, his men were fled when they ſhould haue aſſaulted their enemies. A poaſt may excuſe himſelfe for that the waters were ſo high. A hunter may ſay that beaſt is eſcaped another way, and others ſuch like: but a gouernour of a Common wealth, what excuſe can he haue that he doth not iuſtice? Cō
                        ſcience ought to burden him, and alſo he ought to bee aſhamed to take vpon him the charge of any thing, if hee doubt to bring it to effect: for ſhamefaſt faces and haughty courages, either ought to put that in execution which they take vpon them, or elſe they ought to ſhew a lawful cauſe why it tooke no effect. Let vs knowe what iuſtice is, &amp; then we ſhall know what is meete for the adminiſtration thereof? The office of a good Iudge is to defend the cōmon wealth, to helpe the innocent, to aide the ſimple, to The office of euery Magiſtrate. correct the offender, to helpe the orphanes, to doe for the poore, to bridle the ambitious: finally, by iuſtice he ought to giue each one his owne, and to diſpoſſeſſe thoſe which holde any thing wrongfully of others.
                     When a prince commandeth any man to take the charge of iuſtice, and ſuch one doth not ſeek it of himſelfe, if perchance he did not in all pointes vprightly in the adminiſtration therof, he might haue ſome excuſe ſaying that though hee hath accepted it, it was not with intent to erre, but becauſe he would obey: what ſhal we ſay of many, which without ſhame, without knowledge, experiēce, &amp; without

conſcience do procure the office of iuſtice? O if Princes knew what they giue, when they giue the charge to any to gouern the Common-welth, I ſweare vnto you, that they were better to giue them goods to find them for twenty yeares, then for to truſt them with the charge of iuſtice twenty daies.
                     What a thing is it to ſee ſome men ſhameleſſe, diſhoneſt great talkers, gluttons, ambitious, and couetous, What a great thing it is to doe iuſtice vprightly. the which without any reaſonable cauſe, authority or knowledge, demaund of Princes an office of iuſtice, as if by iuſtice they did demaund their owne? Would to God the giuer would haue an eye to thoſe which in this caſe do demaund. But what ſhall wee ſay of thoſe that doe ſolicite them, procure them, importune them, beſeech them, and more then that, euen as without ſhame they doe demaund it, ſo without conſcience likewiſe they buy it? There remaineth in this caſe more as yet, that is, that if thoſe curſed men doe not attaine to that which they demaund, and if thoſe, (hauing no conſcience) do not giue it them, then they blaſpheme and complain of thoſe which are in fauour with princes, as if they had done them great iniurie.
                     O what trouble is it to good men to accompliſh the deſires of the euill: For the couetous &amp; ambitious perſons doe but deſire that the good mē had the like paine in giuing that they haue in demaunding. Many times I haue thought with my ſelfe, wherein ſo many damages of the Commonwealth ſhould conſiſt, ſuch diſobedience, ſuch contrarieties, and ſo many thefts: and in the end I finde, that all or the moſt part proceed in that, that they prouide for miniſters of iuſtice, not for conſcience ſake, but for couetouſneſſe onely.
                     Admit that it appertaine to all to deſire and procure iuſtice: yet to none it appertaineth ſo much to procure and defend it, as to the royall perſon, which the ſubiects ought ſometime to feare, but princes are bound to miniſter it equally to all. It is a great matter that princes be pure in life, and that their houſes bee well ordered, to the end that their iuſtice be of credite and authoritie: For he which of himſelfe is vniuſt, giueth no hope that another at his hands ſhold Hee that in his life is vn iuſt, cannot doe iuſtice to another. haue iuſtice. He which cannot gouerne his owne houſe, can euill gouerne the common-wealth. Thoſe princes which are true in their words, cleane in their liues, and iuſt in their works, though ſometime they erre in the adminiſtration of the Common wealth, all excuſe them, ſaying, that they erre not thorough the malice of themſelues, but rather thorow the euill counſell of others. So that all which the good prince doth, they commend, and all the euill that chanceth, they excuſe.
                     
                        Plutarch in the ſecond Booke of his Common wealth, ſayeth, That herein ſome Princes differ from others: For the euill Prince is onely obeyed, but the good Prince is obeyed, feared and loued. And moreouer, hee that is good, maketh heauy things light with his goodneſſe: and the Tyrant that is euill, maketh things which are light to be very heauy through his naugh tineſſe.
                     
                     Happie is the prince which is obeyed: but much more happy is he which is obeyed, feared and loued: for the body is weary oftentimes to obey: but the heart is neuer conſtrained to loue.
                     
                        Titus the Emperour was once demanded of theſe two things, that is to ſay, Whether to reward the good, or to puniſh the euill, were for a Prince more naturall? Hee aunſwered, As naturall as both the right and left arme is in
                        
                        a man: ſo neceſſarie is reward and puniſhment in a Prince. But as wee helpe our ſelus more with the right arm then with the left: ſo the Prince ought more to endeauour himſelfe to reward then to puniſh. For puniſhment ought to bee by the handes of a ſtranger, but reward ought to bee with his owne proper hands.
                     
                     When wee perſwade Princes to bee iuſt, and that they doe iuſtice, it is not to bee vnderſtood, that they ſhould be head murderers, baniſh rebels, and ſeditious perſons, hang theeues, and burie felons aliue: For ſuch or other like things, rather appertaine to bloudy Hangmen, then to pittifull Kings. All the profit of iuſtice is, in that the Prince be honeſt of perſon, carefull for his houſeholde, zealous of the Commonwealth, and not large of his Conſcience: For Princes ought not to bee commended for murdering many cruelly: but for reforming the common wealth louingly.
                     
                        Plutarch in the comfortable Oration that hee wrote to Appoloni, ſpeaking of the Lawes which Promotheus gaue to the Egyptians, amongſt the reſidue he recited theſe three that follow.
                     
                        Wee ordaine and commaund that 
                        Lawes giuē to the Egyptians. 
                        Princes lay not hands on others for any crimes or offences done vnto himſelfe: For Princes ought not to vſe their hāds to reuenge their owne iniuries: but rather by iuſtice to defend other that bee iniuried.
                     
                     
                        Wee ordaine and commaund, that all times when they ſhall bee in their Common wealth, and not in wars, they ſhall not weare weapons defenſiue, and much leſſe offenſiue: For good Princes neyther ought to bee haſtie, to the ende they may kill: nor yet to haue vices, whereby they may be killed.
                     
                     
                        We ordaine and commaund, that the Prince doe not onely not kill with his handes, but alſo that doe not ſee them doe iuſtice with his eyes.
                     
                     For how much noble and worthy a thing it is before the preſence of a Prince, that al ſhould receyue honor: ſo ſlaunderous a thing it is that any in his preſence ſhould loſe their liues.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II. The way that Princes ought to vſe in chooſing their Iudges and Officers in their Countries.
                     
                     
                        
                           SParthianus in the liues that he wrote of thirty tyrants ſayde, that Ciriacus the Tirant, had a memoriall made of certaine of the Senatours, whom he would haue killed: and when the thing was diſcouered they ſlew him, They found in the hands of another tyrant named Regilius, after hee was dead, a memoriall of thoſe which with his own hands he had depriued of their liues, wherfore they afterward depriued him of his buriall. O how many Iudges are there in this world, that doe as much aduance themſelues of thoſe, whom they haue cauſed to be whipt, to bee ſlaine, to be beheaded, to be hanged, quartered, and ſlaine, as others doe, which haue redeemed many captiues, or haue married Orphanes.
                     Thoſe Iudges which according to the order of Lawes, cuſtomes, and iuriſdictions to puniſh the euill. I do wel allow, but to reioice and aduance themſelues of them whom they haue condemned, I vtterly abhor: for the What is required in a vertuous Iudge. vertuous and Chriſtian Iudge ought rather to ſhed teares in the Churches, then by affection to ſhed bloud of men in the ſeate of iudgement.
                     
                        
And for the confirmation of that which I haue ſayde, I affirme, that the good iudge and gouernor of the common-wealth, ought not to beare in minde, the murthers and ſlaughters done by others: but to record the iniuryes which they haue done themſelues. For in other mens offences, we ought to be ſilent, and for our owne iniquities wee ought to be penitent.
                     Iudges execute ſome puniſhments, which men diſallow, and God doeth aproue: an other time God condemneth them, though the world do allow them: Therefore the ſureſt thing for Iudges is, not to reioyce of their brethren whom they haue corrected, but what they themſelues for theyr owne offences haue deſerued. In iudging others, by falſe witnes, the Iudges many times againſt theyr wills doe erre: but in their owne matters they can neuer erre (vnleſſe they will) ſince the offences which wee commit are alwayes certaine.
                     Therefore it grieueth mee much, that there be ſome ſo euill: which being accuſed before GOD: would excuſe themſelues before men: yet their owne breethren with falſe witneſſes, they dare condemne, How circū
                           ſpect Princes ought to be in chuſing Iudges
                     
                     Great care ought Princes to haue, to examin them whom they wil make Iudges, and gouernors. For the iudge which daylie maketh not an account with his Conſcience in ſecrete, ſhall commit euery houre a thouſand euills in the Common-wealth.
                     Oh poore and miſerable commonwealth; where the gouernours and iudges thereof doe not caſt their eyes but vnto them whome they ought to chaſtiſe, where they doe not thinke in their hearts, but how they may enrich their Coffers, where they doe not occupie their handes but to take bribes: and doe not paſſe the time, but in feaſtings and Bankettes.
                     And I ſayd not without a cauſe bankets. For there are too many iudges, which employ their ſtudyes more to get them Friendes, to maintaine their ſtate proudly, then for to reade good bookes, and to iudge mens cauſes vprightly.
                     The iudge which neuer readeth: the iudge which neuer ſtudyeth: the iudge which neuer openeth booke: the iudge which is neuer in his houſe: the iudge which day and night robbeth; How is it poſſible that hee ſhould execute one true iuſtice?
                     There can bee no greater feare in a man, nor ſlaunder more great in the commonwealth, then when the iudge (who ought to iudge and chaſtiſe the offences of others,) is alwayes ouerwhelmed with vices. How Iudge, ought to beſtowe their time.
                     
                     The iudge which preſumeth to bee good, and wil be good, and which deſireth to be good: a man ſhould finde him no where, vnleſſe hee be ſtudying in his houſe, or elſe ſitting in the place of Iuſtice, &amp;c.
                     Let not Noble Princes truſt vppon this, when they prouide Iudges, and Gouernours, ſaying: That if they finde any euill, they wil ſoone cut him off: For ſuch are ſo euill, that if they want no meanes to get to thoſe Offices, they ſhal want no cautils, nor corrupt Friends, to ſuborne them therin.
                     When Noble Princes, and great lords ſhall find any iudge euill, I counſell them to auoyde him immediately, or that they ſhew themſelues not contēted with his doings: For ſuch a one ſhall forthwith enforce himſelfe to do iuſtice; with intention, that thoſe of the commonwealth might deſire him to be their iudge. Although my pen doth reproue theſe iudges which are extreame and cruell, yet my intention is not to cōmend the others which are negligent and careleſſe, the which neyther by knowledge can iudge, nor with ſtoutneſſe puniſh. The Iudges which iudge and gouerne, they ought

not to bee with all ſo familiar, that all dare take vpon them to aske him: for in this caſe, if ſome commend his gentle conuerſation, others will blame his partiall Iuſtice.
                     I counſell, admoniſh, and require Princes, that they content themſelus not onely to be true, pittifull, honeſt, and vertuous, nor yet to be iuſt: but that it is as well neceſſarie they bee obſeruers of iuſtice: For let them know, that there is great difference, between him that is iuſt, and another Difference betweene him that is iuſt, and him that adminiſtreth iuſtice that doth miniſter iuſtice: for to the Prince that is good, commeth honor to his perſon: but from him that miniſtreth iuſtice, commeth profite to the Common-wealth.
                     Peraduenture, it is no wonder to ſee the Prince that will tell no lye, and to ſee his Miniſters not to ſpeake one truth? Peraduenture I do not thinke my ſelfe ſlaundered, to ſee the Prince temperate in eating, and to ſee all his ſeruants diſtempred both with eating and drinking? peraduenture, and it is no cauſe to muſe vpon, to ſee the Princes chaſt and honeſt, and to ſee their ſeruants in fleſh, filthy and diſſolute? peraduenture it is no cauſe to maruell to ſee the Prince iuſt, and to loue iuſtice, and that very few of his miniſters do miniſter it.
                     The end why all theſe thinges are ſpoken, is to aduertiſe Princes that they be not ſo carefull to be chaſt, ſober, true and iuſt, but that they know, whether their Gouernours and Iudges are corrupted, couetous, greedy, vnſhamefaſt, lyers or bribers: for if it toucheth vs much that our Princes be good, ſo much more it toucheth vs that the Miniſters be not euill. One of the things wherein Princes ought to prouide with their Iudges and gouernours is, that by no meanes they ſuffer their lawes and and ancient cuſtomes to be broken in their commō welth, and that in their ſteads ſtrange cuſtoms be not introduced: for the Comminalty is ſo variable in that Ancient Lawes and cuſtomes ought nor to be broken. they ſay, and ſo light in that they aske that they would dayly ſee a new king, and hourely change a new law. Plinie in an Epiſtle that he writeth to Eſcario ſayeth, Optime apud Perſius capitalem per legem fuit prohibitum, nouos aut perigrinos mores inducere. As if hee ſpake more plainely. Amongſt the Perſians it was a Law inuiolable, that no man ſhould bring into the Common-wealth any ſtrange cuſtome: &amp; for ſuch an offence they ſhould pay none other ranſome but the loſſe of their heads.
                     As men dayly doe diminiſh in vertue (vnleſſe by force they be withholden) and augment in vanity: ſo they would inuent new deuiſes and ſtrange cuſtomes, wherewith men ſhould bee decayed, and the Common wealth deſtroied: for ſtraunge meates doe alter mens ſtomackes. When thoſe of Creta were vngently vſed of the Rhodians, they did not pray to their gods to ſend them peſtilence, warre, famine, or ſedition among their enemies: but that they would ſuffer ſom euil maners to be brought in amongſt the people. Let not thoſe thinke that ſhall reade this, that it was a ſmall curſe that thoſe of Creta deſired, and that it was a ſmall reuenge which God gaue them of their enemies, if he gaue them that which they did require, for from war famin and peſtilence, ſom may eſcape but with deuiſes we ſee all periſh. Of many things the hiſtoriās do reproue the Emperor Sergius Galba, &amp; for one alone they praiſe him, That he neuer cōſented that in Rome any new law ſhold be made, nor any old cuſtom broken. And he commanded that thoſe ſhould be grieuouſly puniſhed which brought in any new law, &amp; he rewarded thoſe which put him in mind of any olde cuſtome, the which bee commaunded to bee obſerued.
                     
                     
                        
It is a mockery, yea (better to ſay) a ſlaunder, to ſee that ſome young Iudges will doe that of the Commonwealth, which a Taylour doeth of a gowne: (that is to ſay) to turne him, within and without, before &amp; behind, which they ought not to doe, nor the people to conſent therevnto. For the Prince doeth not ſende them to make lawes, nor to bring in new orders, but to the ende that they do only preſerue the commonwealth in their good cuſtomes.
                     Princes ought alſo to take great care that vnto litle and great, rich &amp; poor, they miniſter equall iuſtice: ſith there Princes ought not to be partiall in iudgement. is no diuine nor humaine law, that giueth them power and aucthoritie to corrupt it: For, if a Prince cannot without reaſon d poſe of his owne goods, much leſſe he can make lawes, and ſell Iuſtice.
                     Wee doe not denye a Prince, but that hee is lorde of Beaſtes, of Fyſh, of Byrds, of Mynes, of Mountains, of ſeruants, and of fields. Finally, that hee is lord of the ſea and land: but therefore we will not graunt him that he is lord of iuſtice. For there is none other true Lorde of Iuſtice, but GOD: which is the ſelfe ſame Iuſtice.
                     When a Prince dyeth, and maketh his will, he ſayeth: I bequeath all my Realms and Seigniories to the Prince my ſonne and legitimate heyre, and doe leaue vnto my ſecond ſonne, ſuch an Eſtate and dowrey, and to my daughter ſuch Lands, and to all I recommend Iuſtice, to the end they do obſerue it, and cauſe it to be obſerued, euery one in his owne Countrey.
                     It is much to note, that the Father doth not ſay, that hee leaueth vnto his Sonne Iuſtice, but that hee doeth recommend it vnto him: ſo that the good Princes ought not to think that they haue inherited Iuſtice of theyr predeceſſors, in form of a patrimony, but that God gaue it vnto thē of truſt
                     Princes of all things may be called Lords, ſaue onely of Iuſtice, whereof they are but onely miniſters. Wee dare boldely ſay, that the Prince, or Princes the miniſters of God, for Iuſtice. great Lord, which iudgeth cauſes not according to the Diuine will, but according to their owne affection: wee will not call him a iuſt iudge, but a rouing Theefe. For the Prince is much worſe, which robbeth God of Iuſtice: then the Theefe which ſtealeth the goods from men.
                     
                        Suetonius Tranquillus reciteth much wickednes of Domitian: and the greateſt of al was, the poore, the Orphans, and thoſe which could doe little, hee alwayes puniſhed: and the other that were rich, and of authoritie he pardoned. He compounded with ſome for money, and with others hee diſſembled for fauour.
                     
                        Lampridius ſayde of Alexander Seuerus, the 25. Emperour of Rome, that An excellēt ſaying of Alexander Seuerus. hee neuer kept in his Court any euill man, or ſuffered any of his parents to be vicious. And when he was demanded on a time, why hee baniſhed one of his couſines: ſince he was young, and a Childe? Hee aunſwered them, which intreated for him, and alleadged. That though he was young and his Couſin: yet Charior eſt mihi Reſpub: as if more plainely he had ſaide, I haue none other neerer of kinne to mee in my Pallace, then the Commonwealth.
                     O high, &amp; much more higher words, worthy for a truth to be writtē in princes hearts; whereby they ought to be aduertiſed, that hee ſaid not, I take for my kinne one part of the Commonwealth:
                     
                     For, the Prince which feareth GOD, and deſireth to be found iuſt, as he wil indifferently be obeyed of al, ſo ought he equally to adminiſter iuſtice to all. If they wil not credit me nor my pen, let them credit Plato in the books of his commonwealth: who giueth libertie and licence to all the Plebeyans, to the end

that euery one doe loue his wife, his children, and his Parents. And this ſorte of loue hee will not that Princes haue, to whome hee perſwadeth that firſt aboue all things, they loue theyr cōmon-wealth: For if the prince doe loue anie thing aboue his Commonwealth, it is vnpoſſible but that one day, for the loue of that he will wring Iuſtice.
                     When Plato gaue not licence vnto Princes not to enlarge theyr loue on The Lawes of Plato, concerning princes. diuers things, peraduenture he would counſell them, leaſt they ſhould doe ſome wrongs. It chaunceth oft times that Princes doe omit iuſtice: not for that they will not adminiſter it, but becauſe they will not bee informed of things, which they ought to remedie, and looke vnto. And this is vnexcuſable, where hee hurteth his honour, burdeneth his conſcience. For, at the day of iudgement (though hee be not accuſed for malice, yet hee ſhall be condemned for negligence.)
                     The Prince which is carefull to ſee, and to enquire the dammages of his Realmes: we may ſay that if he doeth not prouide for them, it is becauſe he can do no more: but he which is negligent to ſee them, and know them, we cannot ſay but if he leaue to prouide, it is for that hee will not.
                     The Prince or great Lorde, which dare take vpon him ſuch things; what name or renowme may we giue him? I would not we ſhould call ſuch a one father of the commonwealth: but deſtroyer of his countrey. For there can be no tyrannie greater, nor more vnequall, then for the phyſitian to aske his duety for his cure, before hee hath begunne to miniſter the medicine.
                     That Princes and great Lords deſire to know their reuenues, I allow them: but in that they care not to knowe the dāmages of their commonwealths, I do diſcommend them. For the people pay tribute to their Princes, to the ende they ſhould deliuer them from their enemies, and defend them from tyraunts. For the Iudges which wilbe euill, though I ſay much, it will profite little: but vnto thoſe which deſire to bee good, that which is ſpoken (as I thinke) ſufficeth: Notwithſtanding that which is ſpoken I ſay, that Iudges and gouernors ought to conſider wel with themſelues, and ſee if they wil be counted for iuſt miniſters or cruell tirants. For, the office of a Tyrant is, to robbe the Common-wealth: and the Office of the good Prince is, to reforme the people.
                     Noble Princes and great Lordes, haue more buſineſſe then they thinke they haue: to ſee all thoſe which will ſee them, and to heare all thoſe which will complaine vnto them. And the cauſe hereof is, admitte that which the Subiect demaundeth, hee preſently cannot giue: nor that whereof hee The difference betweene a tyrant and a good prince complaineth, he cannot remedie; yet notwithſtanding they remaine after a ſort contented: ſaying, that they haue now ſhewed all their complaynts and iniuries vnto their princes. For, the wounded harts oftentimes vtter their inward paines which they feele, without anie hope to receyue comforte of that which they deſire.
                     
                        Plutarche in his Apothegmes ſayeth: that a poore and aged woman, deſired king Philippe of Macedonie, (which was father of king Alexander the great) that hee would heare her with iuſtice: and ſith ſhee was very importunate vpon him, K: Philip ſaide on a day vnto her. I pray thee woman bee contented: I ſweare by the gods, I haue no leyſure to heare thy complaint. The old woman anſwered the king: Beholde, K: Philippe, if thou haſt not time to heare mee with iuſtice, reſigne thy Kingdome, and another ſhall gouerne thy Commonwealth.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. III. Of an oration which a villaine dwelling neere to the riuer of Danuby, maae before the Senatours of Rome, concerning the tyrannies and oppreſſions which their officers vſed in his countrey, And the Oration is diuided into three Chapters.
                     
                     
                        IN the tenth yeare of the raigne of the good Emperour Marcus Aurelius, 
                        A great peſtilence in Rome in the time of M: Aurelius there happened in Rome a generall peſtilence: the which being ſo outragious, the good Emperour went into Campaigne, which at time was very healthfull, &amp; without diſeaſes, though it was very drie, and wanted much of that which was neceſſarie: yet notwithſtanding the good Emperor was there with all the principall Senatours of Rome: for in the time of peſtilence men doe not ſeeke where they ſhould reioice their perſōs, but where they may ſaue their liues.
                     
                        Marcus Aurelius being there in Campagnia was ſore vexed with a Fener: and as his condition was alwaies to bee amongſt ſages: ſo at that time his ſickneſſe required to be viſited by Phyſitians. The reſort that he had in his Pallace was very great, as well of Philoſophers for to teach, as of Phyſitians for to diſpute: For this prince ordered his life in ſuch ſorte, that in his abſence things touching the warre were well prouided: and in his preſence was nothing but matters of knowledge argued.
                     It chaunced one day as Marcus Aurelius was enuironed with Senators, philoſophers, phyſitians, and other Sage men, a queſtion was moued among them, how greatly Rome was changed, not onely in buildings which almoſt were vtterly decayed: but alſo in maners, which were wholly corrupted: the cauſe of this euill grew, for that Rome was full of flatterers and deſtitute of thoſe which durſt ſay the truth.
                     Theſe, and ſuch other like wordes heard, the Emperour tooke vp his hand and bleſſed him, and declared vnto them a notable example, ſaying: In the firſt yeare that I was Conſull, there came a poore villaine from the riuer of Danuby, to aske iuſtice of the Senate againſt a Cenſor which did ſore oppreſſe the people, and in deed hee did ſo well propound his complaint, and declare the folly and iniuries, which the Iudges did in his Country, that I doubt whether Marcus Cicero could vtter it better with his tongue, or the renowmed Homer haue writen it more eloquently with his pen.
                     This villaine had a ſmall face, great The deſcription of the villaine. lips, hollow eyes, his colour burnt, curled hayre, bare-headed, his ſhoes of Porpyge skinne, his coat of goates skinne, his girdle of bul-ruſhes, a long beard and thicke, his eye brows couered his eyes, the ſtomacke and the necke couered with skinnes, heared as a Beare, and a clubbe in his hand.
                     Without doubt, when I ſaw him enter into the Senate, I imagined it had beene a beaſt in forme of a man: and after I heard that which he ſayd, I iudged him to bee a God (if there be Gods among men.) For it was a fearefull thing to behold his perſon, it was no leſſe monſtrous to heare his words.
                     At that time there was great preaſe at the dore of the Senate, of many &amp; diuers perſons, for to ſolicite the affayres of their Prouinces: yet notwithſtanding

this villaine ſpake before the others for two cauſes. The one, for the men were deſirous to heare what ſo monſtrous a man would ſay: The other, becauſe the Senators had this cuſtome, that the complaints of the poore ſhould bee heard before the requeſts of the rich. Wherefore this villaine afterwards in the middeſt of the Senate, beganne to tell his tale, and the cauſe of his comming thither, in the which hee ſhewed himſelfe no leſſe bolde in wordes, then hee was in his attire ſtrange, and ſayd vnto them in this ſort. The oration of the villaine to the Senators of Rome.
                     
                     O Fathers Conſcript, and happy people, I Mileno a Ploughman, dwelling neere vnto the riuer of Danube, doe ſalute you worthy Senators of Rome, which are conuented here in this Senate; and I beſeech the Immortall Gods my tongue this day ſo to gouerne, that I may ſay that which it conuenient for my Country, and that they helpe you others to gouerne well the Common-wealth: for without the helpe of God, wee can neyther learne the good, nor auoyde the euill. The fatal Deſtenies permitting it, and our wrathfull Gods forſaking vs, our miſhappe was ſuch, &amp; to you others fortune ſhewed herſelfe ſo fauourable, that the proude Captaines of Rome, by force of armes tooke our Country of Germany. And I ſay not without a cauſe, that at that time the Gods were diſpleaſed with vs: for if wee Germaines had appeaſed our Gods, yee Romaines might well haue excuſed your ſelues for ouercomming of vs.
                     Great is your glory, O Romanes, for the victories you haue had, and triumphes which of many Realmes you haue conquered: but notwithſtanding greater ſhall your infamie bee in the world to come, for the cruelties which you haue committed: for I let you know, if you doe not know it, that when the wicked went before the triumphant chariots ſaying, Liue, liue, inuincible Rome: On the other ſide, the poore Captiues went ſaying in their hearts, Iuſtice, iuſtice. My predeceſſors enhabited by the riuer of Danuby, for when the drie earth annoyed them, they came to recreat themſelues in the freſh water, and if perchance the vnconſtant water did annoy them, then they would return againe to the maine land. And as the appetites and conditions of men are variable, ſo there is a time to flye from the land, to refreſh our ſelues by the water.
                     And time alſo when we are annoyed with the water to returne againe to the land. But how ſhall I ſpeake Romaines, that which I would ſpeake? your couetouſneſſe of taking other mens goods hath beene ſo extreame, and your pride of commaunding ſtrange Counties hath beene ſo diſordinate, that neyther the ſea can ſuffice you in the deepeneſſe thereof, neither the land aſſure vs in the fields of the ſame.
                     Oh how great comfort it is for the troubled men to thinke and bee aſſured that there are iuſt Gods, the which will doe iuſtice on the vniuſt: For if the oppreſſed men thought themſelues not aſſured, that the gods would wreake their iniury of their enemies, they with their owne handes would deſtroy themſelues. The end why I ſpeake this is, for ſo much as I hope in the iuſt Gods, that as you others without reaſon haue caſt vs out of ourhouſes, ſo by reaſon ſhall others come after vs, and caſt you others out of Italy, &amp; Rome both. There in my Countrey of Germany, we take it for a rule vnfallible, that he which by force taketh the good of another, by reaſon ought to loſe his own proper right.
                     
                        
And I hope in the Gods that that which wee haue for a prouerbe in Germany, you ſhall haue for experience here in Rome. By the groſſe wordes I ſpeake, and by the ſtrange apparrell which I weare, you may wel imagine that I am ſome rude villaine or barbarian borne: but yet notwithſtanding, I want not reaſon to know, who is iuſt and righteous in holding his owne: and who is a tyrant in poſſeſſing of others. For the rude men of my profeſſion, though in good ſtile they cannot declare that which they would vtter: yet notwithſtanding, Wee are not ignorant of that which ought to be allowed for good; nor which ought to bee condemned for euill.
                     I would ſay therefore in this caſe, that that which the euill with all their tyranie haue gathered in many daies, the Gods ſhall take from them in one howre: and contrariwiſe, all that which the good ſhall looſe in manie yeares, the Gods will reſtore it them in one minute: For ſpeaking the truth, the euill to proſper in riches, is not for that the gods will it, but that they doe ſuffer it, and though at this houre wee complaine, diſſembling wee ſuffer much, but the time ſhall come that will pay for all.
                     Beleeue mee in one thing, O Romanes, and doubt not therein, That of the vnlawfull gaines of the Father, followeth after the iuſt vndoing of their children.
                     
                     Many oftentimes doe maruell in my Countrey, what the cauſe is, that the gods doe not take from the wicked that which they winne, immediately as ſoone as they winne it, and as I thinke the reaſon hereof is, for the diſſembling with them by little and little they gather together diuers things, and afterwardes when they thinke leaſt thereon, it is taken from them all at once: for the iuſt iudgement of the Gods is, that ſince without reaſon they haue done euill to others, others by reaſon ſhould come in like manner which doe euill vnto them. It is vpoſſible that the valiant and Sage man, who in his deeds preſumeth to bee wiſe, ſhould take any taſte in in any other mans good: for if hee did, hee would neuer content himſelfe with any thing, ſith hee hath not a conſcience in that which is euil gotten. I know not Romanes, whether you vnderſtand me, but becauſe you ſhall vnderſtand mee better, I ſay, that I maruell, and I ſhould rather wonder, how the man keeping another mans goods, can ſleepe, or reſt one houre, ſith hee knoweth hee hath done iniury to the gods, ſlaundered his neighbours, pleaſed his enemies, loſt his friends, and endamaged thoſe that hee robbed; and worſt of all, that hee hath put his perſon in perill.
                     And I ſay that hee hath put his perſon in perill: for the day that any man determineth to take my goods, hee will alſo the ſame day (if Hee that taketh away another mans goods, putteth his life alſo in peril. hee can) take my life. It is an odious thing to the Gods, and very ſlaunderous among men, that men ſhould haue ſo much (through their fleſhly deſires) vertue bound, and the reine of their euill works ſo much at liberty, that another mans miſery ſeemeth to him riches, and that his own riches ſeemeth to himſelfe pouerty. I care not whether he be Greeke, Barbarian Romaine, preſent or abſent, I ſay, and affirme that he is, and ſhall bee curſed of the Gods, and hated of men; which without conſideration will chaunge his good fame into ſhame, iuſtice into wrong, right into tyranny, truth into lyes, the certaine for the doubtfull, hating his owne proper, and ſighing for that of other mens. Hee that hath his chiefe intention to gather goodes for

his children, and ſeeketh not a good name among the renowmed: it is iuſt that ſuch a one doe not only looſe the goods which hee hath gathered, but alſo that without good name hee remaine ſhamefull among the wicked.
                     Since you other Romaines naturally are proude, and pride doth blinde you, you thinke your ſelues happy, that for hauing ſo much as you haue more then others, that therfore you ſhould bee more honoured then all, the which truly is not ſo: For if preſently you will not open your eyes, and confeſſe your owne errors, you ſhall ſee, that wheras you auant your ſelues to be Lords of ſtrange Countries, you ſhall find yourſelus made ſlaues with your own proper goods.
                     Gather as much as you will, let them doe all you doe commaund them: yet as I thinke, it little auaileth to haue Plebeians houſes with goods, and contrariwiſe the hearts to bee poſſeſſed with couetouſneſſe: for the riches which are gotten with couetouſneſſe, and are kept with. Auarice, do take away the good name from the poſſeſſor, and do nothing auaile to maintaine his life.
                     It cannot bee ſuffered many dayes, and much leſſe hidde many yeares, that one man ſhould be counted both for rich among the rich, &amp; for honoured among the honorable: for it is vnpoſſible that hee which is a great louer of temporall goods, ſhould be a friend of his good name. O if the couetous men were of their owne honour as greedy, as they are of the goods of another deſirous: I ſweare vnto you by the immortall Gods, that the little worme or moth of couetouſnes would not gnaw the reſt of their life, nor the canker of infamie ſhould deſtroy their good name after their death.
                     Hearken yee Romanes, hearken what I wil ſay, and I beſeech the gods that you may vnderſtand it: for other wiſe I ſhould looſe my labour, and yee others ſhould take no fruit of my wordes. I ſee that all the World hateth pride, and yet there is none that will follow humanity. Euery man Euery man giuen to one ſinne or other. condemneth adultery, and yet I ſee no man that liueth chaſte. Euerie man curſeth exceſſe, &amp; I ſee no man liue temperately. Euery man prayſeth patience, and I ſee no man that will ſuffer. Euery man blameth ſloth, and I ſee no man but thoſe that are idle. Euery man blameth auarice, and yet euery man robbeth.
                     One thing, I ſay, and not without teares in this Senate, openly I do declare it, which is, that with the tongue euery man prayſeth vertue, and yet they themſelues with al their lims are ſeruants vnto vices.
                     Doe not thinke that I ſay this onely for the Romanes which bee in Illyria, but for the Senators which I ſee here in the Senate.
                     All you Romanes in your deuiſes about your Armes, haue this for your word, Romanorum eſt debellare ſuperbos, et parcere ſubiectos. Truely you ſhould better haue ſayde, Romanorum eſt ſpoliare innocentes, et reddere ſubiectos: For you Romanes are but deſtroyers of the people that bee peaceable, and robbers of the ſwette and labours of ſtrangers.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. IIII. The villaine argueth againſt the Romaines, which without cauſe or reaſon conquered their Countrey, and proued manifeſtly that they thorow offending of their Gods, were vanquiſhed of the Romanes.
                     
                     
                        I Aske ye Romanes, what occaſion yee The villain continueth his Oration wherein hee layeth open the tyranny and oppreſſion of the Romanes againſt the Germanes. haue, that are brought vp nigh to the riuer of Tiber, againſt vs that liue in peace, nigh to the riuer of Danuby. Peraduenture you haue ſeene vs friends to your foes, or elſe wee haue ſhewed our ſelues your enemies? peraduenture you haue heard ſay, that forſaking our owne land, wee ſhould goe conquere forraine realmes? peraduenture you haue beene aduertiſed, that wee rebelling againſt our own Lords ſhold become obedient to the cruell Barbarians? peraduenture yee haue ſent vs ſome Ambaſſadour to deſire vs to be your friends, or elſe there came ſome from vs to Rome, to defie you as our enemies? peraduenture ſome King dyed in our realme, which by his Teſtament made you heyres vnto our Realme? whereby you clayme your Title, and ſeeke to make vs your ſubiects? peraduenture by ſome ancient law or cuſtome yee haue found that the noble and worthy Germany, of neceſſity is ſubiect to the proude people of Rome? peraduenture wee haue deſtroyed your Armies, wee haue waſted your fields, ſacked your Cities, ſpoyled your ſubiects, or fauoured your enemies? ſo that to reuenge theſe iniuries yee ſhould deſtroy our land: If wee had bin your neighbours, or you ours, it had been no maruell though one ſhould haue deſtroyed the other. For it chaunceth oftentimes, that through controuerſie of a little peece of ground, tedious warres betweene people ariſe.
                     Of a truth none of theſe thinges which I haue named, hath chaunced betweene ye Romains and vs Germains. For in Germany wee felte your tyranny, as ſoone as wee heard of your renowne.
                     If yee bee grieued with that I haue ſayde, I pray you bee not offended with that I will ſay, which is, that the name of Romanes, and the cruelty of tyrants arriued together in one day vpon our people. And what more to ſay, I know not Romanes, of the litle care the Gods doe take, and of the great audacitie that men haue: For I ſee that hee which poſſeſſeth much, doth oppreſſe him which hath but little, and he that hath but little, wayeth not him that hath much.
                     So diſordered couetouſneſſe ſtriueth with ſecret malice, and ſecret malice giueth place to open theft &amp; open robbery no man reſiſteth, and thereof commeth, that the couetouſneſſe of a malitious man is accompliſhed, to the preiudice of a whole ſtate.
                     Hearken yee Romanes, hearken, by the Immortall Gods I doe coniure you, giue care to that I will ſay, which is, conſider well what you haue done: for the good wordes bee in vaine, or elſe men muſt haue an end, the world in time muſt needes fall, or elſe the world ſhall be no world. Fortune muſt needs make ſure the pinne of the wheele, or elſe that ſhall bee ſeene which neuer was ſeene, which is, that which in eight yeares ye haue wonne, yee ſhall within eight dayes loſe: For nothing can bee more iuſt,

ſince yee by force haue made your ſelues tyrants: then the Gods by iuſtice ſhould make you ſlaues. And doe not thinke you Romanes though you haue ſubdued Germany, and bee Lords thereof, that it was by any warlike induſtry: for ye are no more warlike, no more couragious, nor more hardy, ne yet more valiant then wee Germaines: but ſince through our offences wee haue prouoked the Gods to wrath, they for the puniſhment of our diſordinate vices ordained, that ye ſhould be a cruel plague and ſcourge to our perſons, Do not take your ſelues to be ſtrong, neither repute vs to bee ſo weake, that if the Gods at that time had fauoured the one part, as much as the other: it might perchance haue happened, yee ſhould not haue enioyed the ſpoyle. For to ſay the truth, yee wanne not the victory through the force of weapons that you brought from Rome, but through the infinite vices which yee found in Germany.
                     
                     Therefore ſince wee were not ouercome for being cowards, neyther for being weake, nor yet for beeing fearefull, but onely for being wicked, and not hauing the Gods fauourable vnto vs: what hope yee Romanes to become of you, beeing as you are vicious, and hauing the Gods angrie with you?
                     Doe nor thinke Romanes to be the more victorious, for that ye aſſemble great Armies, or that yee abound in treaſures, neither for that you haue greater Gods in your ayd, or that yee build greater temples, nor yet for that yee offer ſuch great ſacrifices: For I let you know, if you doe not know it, that no man is in more fauour with the Gods, then he which is at peace with vertue.
                     If the triumphes of the Conquerours conſiſteth in nothing elſe but in ſubtill wittes, politique captains, valiant Souldiers, and great Armies, without doubt, it would little auayle to carry all this to the Warre, ſince afterwardes wee ſee by experience, Man may giue the battell, but God muſt giue the victorie. that men can doe no more but giue the battels, and the Gods themſelues muſt giue the victories.
                     If I be not deceyued, I thinke that for our offences we haue ſufficiently ſatisfied the Gods wrath. But truely I beleeue that the cruelties which yee haue done vnto vs, and the vnthankfulneſſe which you haue ſhewed the Gods (though as yet yee haue not payed it) yet once yee ſhall pay it.
                     And hereafter it may chance, that as preſently yee count vs for ſlaues: ſo in time to come yee ſhall acknowledge vs for Lords. Since the trauelling by the way, I haue ſeene the high mountaines, diuers Prouinces, ſundry Nations, Countries ſo ſauage, people ſo barbarous, ſuch and ſo many miles as Germany is diſtant from Rome.
                     
                     I muſe what fond toye came into the Romanes heads, to ſend to conquer Germany? If couetouſneſſe of treaſures cauſed it, I am ſure they ſpent more money to conquer it, and at this preſent doe ſpende to keepe it, then the whole reuenues of Germany amounteth, or may amount in many yeares: and perchaunce they may loſe it, before they recouer that they ſpent to conquer it.
                     And if yee ſay vnto me Romanes, that Germany is not conquered of Rome for euer, but that onely Rome ſhould haue the glory to be Miſtreſſe of Germany: This alſo, I ſay is vanitie and folly: For little auayleth it haue the Forts and Caſtles of the people, when the hearts of the Inhabitants are abſent.
                     If yee ſay, that therefore yee conquered Germany, to amplifie and enlarge the limits and bounds of Rome: alſo mee thinketh this is a fooliſh enterpriſe.

For it is not the point of wiſe and valiaunt men to enlarge their dominions, and diminiſh their honours. If ye ſay ye ſent to conquere vs, to the end wee ſhould not be barbarous, nor liue like Tyrants, but that you would wee ſhould liue after your good lawes and cuſtomes: if it bee ſo, I am well content. But how is it poſſible yee ſhould giue lawes to ſtraungers, when yee breake the Lawes of your owne predeceſſours? Great ſhame ought they to haue which take vpon them to correct others, when they haue more neede to bee corrected themſelues: For the blinde man ought not to take vpon him to leade the lame. If this be true, (as preſently it is) what reaſon, or occaſion had prowde Rome, to take and conquer the innocent Germanes? Let vs all go therfore to robbe, to kill, to conquer, and to ſpoyle, ſince we ſee the world ſo corrupt, &amp; ſo farre from the loue of God, that euery man (as we may perceyue) taketh what he can, killeth whom hee will, and that which worſte of all is, that neyther thoſe which gouerne will remedie ſo manie euills as are committed, neyther thoſe which are offended dare complaine.
                     Ye chiefe iudges at this day are ſo harde to be intreated, yee take ſo little Iniury done wher iuſtice is neglected regard vnto the poore oppreſſed: that they thinke it more quiet, to remaine in trouble at home, then to come and put vp their complaintes before you, here at Rome.
                     
                     And the cauſe hereof is, that there in theyr Countrey they haue but one which purſueth them: and heere in this Senate they are euill willed of all, and that is; becauſe hee which complaineth is poor, and the other which is complained on is rich.
                     Therefore ſince Fortune would it, and the fatall Deſtinies permit it, that the proud Rome ſhould be miſtreſſe of our Germanie, it is but reaſon ye ſhould keepe vs in iuſtice, and maintaine vs in peace. But you doe not ſo, but rather thoſe which come thither, doe take from vs our goods: and yee that are heere, doe robbe vs of our good name, ſaying: That ſince we are a people without law: without reaſon: and without a king, (as vnknowne barbarous) yee may take vs for ſlaues.
                     In this caſe ye Romaines are greatly deceyued: For me thinketh with reaſon, ye cannot call vs without reaſon: ſince wee being ſuch as we are, and as the Gods created vs, remaine in our proper countreys, without deſiring to ſeeke or invade forreine Realmes. For with more reaſon wee might ſay, that yee were men without reaſon: being not contented with the ſweet and fertile Italie; but through ſhedding of bloud, you ſhould deſire to conquer all the earth. In that yee ſay wee deſerue to be ſlaues, becauſe we haue no Prince to command vs, nor Senate to: gouerne vs, nor Armey to defende vs to this I will anſwere:
                     That ſince wee had no enemies, we needed no Armeys: and ſith euery man is contented with his lotte and Fortune, wee had no neceſſitie of a proude Senate to gouerne vs, and we being as we are all equall, it neede not An Apologie of the viilaine. wee ſhould conſent to haue any Princes amongſt vs. For the office of princes is, to ſuppreſſe tyrants, &amp; to maintaine their people in peace.
                     If yee ſay further, that wee haue not in our Countrey a Common-wealth, nor pollicie, but that wee liue as the beaſts in the Mountaines: in this alſo you haue but ſmall reaſon. For we in our Countrey did ſuffer no lyers, neyther rebells, nor ſeditious perſons: nor men that broght vs (from ſtrange Countreys) any apparell for to be vicious: ſo that ſith in apparell we were honeſt, and in meate very temperate, wee needed no better behauiour. For though in our countrey there are no merchaunts of Carthage, oyles of

                        Mauritania, marchants of Tyre, ſteele of Cantabria, Odours of Aſia, Gold of Spaine, Siluer of Britaine, Amber of Sidonie, Silke of Damaſco, Corne of Scicill, Wine of Candie, Purple of Arabia: yet for all this we are not brutiſh, neyther ceaſe for to haue a Common-Wealth.
                     For theſe and ſuch other the like things, giue more occaſion to ſtirre vp many vices, then for vertuous men to liue according vnto vertue. Bleſſed and happy is the Common-Wealth, not where great riches aboundeth, but where vertues are highly commended: not where many light and angry men reſort, but where the patient are reſident: therefore it followeth, that of the Common wealth of Rome for beeing rich, wee ſhould haue pitty: and of the Common-Wealth of Germany for being poore, yee ought not to haue enuye.
                     Would to God that the contentation wee haue with our pouerty, yee others had the ſame with your riches. For then neyther ye had robbed vs of our Countries, nor we had not come hither now to complaine in Rome of your tyranny.
                     I ſee Romanes, that the one differeth much from the other: For ye others, though yee heare our oppreſſions, yet thereby you loſe not your paſtime: but wee others can neuer drye the teares of our eyes, nor ceale to bewayle our infinit miſfortunes.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. V. The Villaine concludeth his Oration againſt the Iudges, which miniſter not iuſtice, and declareth how preiudiciall ſuch wicked men are vnto the publike weale.
                     
                     
                        YEe would thinke I haue ſayde that I Concluſion of the villains ſpeech wherein he reproueth the Roman Magiſtrates. can ſay, but certainly it is not ſo: For there remaineth many thinges to ſpeake, which to heare yee will bee aſtonied, yet be ye aſſured that to ſpeake them I will not bee afrayde, ſith you others in doing them are not aſhamed. For open offence deſerueth not ſecret correction. I maruell much at yee Romaines, what yee meant to ſend vs (as you did) ſuch ignorant Iudges, the which, by the immortall God I ſwear, can neyther declare vs your Lawes, and much leſſe they can vnderſtand ours. And the cauſe of all this euill is, that yee ſent not thoſe which be beſt able to miniſter to vs iuſtice in Germany, but thoſe which haue beſt friendes with you in Rome, preſuppoſe that to thoſe of the Senate, yee giue the office of Cenſor-ſhip, more for importunity then for ability. It is little that I can ſay heere, in reſpect they dare do there: That which yee commaund them here, I know not: but of the which they doe there: I am not ignorant, which is; Your Iudges take al bribes that are brought vnto them openly: and they powle and ſhaue as much as they can ſecretly. They grieuouſly puniſh the offences of the poore, and diſſemble with the faults of the rich: they conſent to many euils, to haue occaſion to commit

greater thefts, they forget the gouernment of the people to take theyr pleaſure in vice. And beeing there to mittigate ſclaunders, they are thoſe which are moſte ſclaunderous: and without goods, it auayleth to man to aske iuſtice. And finally, vnder the colour that they be Iudges of Rome, they feare not to rob all the land of Germanie: What meaneth this yee Romanes: ſhall your pride neuer haue end in cō
                        māding, nor your couetiſe in robbing Say vnto vs what ye will in words, but oppreſſe vs not ſo in deeds. If you do it for our children, loade them with yrons, &amp; make them ſlaues. For ye cannot charge them with more then they are able to carry: but of commandements and tributs ye giue vs more thē wee are eyther able to carrie or ſuffer. If you do it for our goods, go thither and take them all. For in our countrey we doe not vſe as ye Romanes doe, nor haue ſuch conditions as ye haue here in Rome, For yee deſire to liue poore, that ye may die rich. If ye ſay that we will rebell, I maruell what yee ſhould meane to thinke ſo, ſith yee haue ſpoyled vs, robbed vs, and handled vs yll. Aſſure me ye Romaines, that ye wil not vnpeople vs, and I will aſſure you we will not rebell. If our ſeruice doe not content yee, ſtrike off our heads, as to the euil men. For (to tell ye the truth) the knife ſhall not be ſo fearfull to our neckes, as your tyrannies be abhorred The tyrannie of the Romanes to the Germanes. in our hearts.
                     Doe ye know what you haue done ye Romains, yee haue cauſed vs of that miſerable realme to ſweare, neither to dwell with our wiues, and to ſley our owne children, rather then to leaue them in the handes of ſo wicked and cruell tirants as yee be. As deſperate men we haue determined to ſuffer, &amp; endure the beaſtly motiōs of the fleſh during the time we haue to liue, to the ende wee will not get our wiues with child. For we had rather liue chaſt 20 or 30. yeares, then to leaue our childrē perpetuall ſlaues. If it be true that the children muſt endure, that which the miſerable fathers doe ſuffer? It is not onely good to ſley them, but alſo it ſhould bee better, not to agree they ſhold be borne. Ye ought not to doe this Romanes, for the lād taken by force ought the better to bee gouerned: to the intent that the miſerable captiues ſeing iuſtice duly adminiſtred preſently, ſhould thereby forget the tyrannie paſſed, &amp; content themſelues with per petuall ſeruitude. And ſith it is true, that we are come to complaine of the oppreſſions which your Officers doe, here vpon the riuer of Danuby, peradnenture yee which are of the Senate, will heare vs: and thogh you are now determined to heare vs, yet you are ſlow to remedy vs: ſo that before ye began to reforme an euil cuſtome, the whole common-wealth is already vndone. I will tell you of ſome things therof, to thintent you may know thē, and then to reforme them. If there come a right poore man to demaund Iuſtice, hauing no money to giue, nor wine to preſent, nor Oyle to promiſe, not friends to helpe him, nor reuenues to ſuccour him, and maintaine him in expences: after he hath complayned, they ſatisfie him with words, ſaying vnto him, that ſpeedily hee ſhall haue Iuſtice.
                     What will you I ſhould ſay, but that in the meane time, they make him ſpend that little which he hath, and giue him nothing though hee demaund much, they giue him vaine hope, and they make him waſte the beſt of his life, euery one of them doth promiſe him fauour, and afterwards they all lay hands vpon him to oppreſſe him. The moſt of them ſay his right is good, and afterwards they giue ſentence againſt him, ſo that the miſerable perſon that came to complaine of one, returneth

home complaining of all, curſing his cruell deſtinies, and crying out to the iuſt and mercifull Gods for reuengement. It chanceth alſo that oft times there commeth to complaine heere in the Senate, ſome flattering man more for malice, then by reaſon of right or iuſtice: and yee Senatours crediting his double wordes and his fained teares, immediately ordaine a Cenſor, to goe, and giue audience on their complaints who being gone and returned, yee ſeeke more to remedie, and giue eare to the complaints of the iudge, then to the ſlanders which were among the people. I will declare vnto you my ſelfe, O ye Romanes, and thereby you ſhall ſee how they paſſe their life in my country. I liue by gathering akorns in the winter, and reaping corn in the ſommer, ſometime I fiſh as well of neceſſity, as of pleaſure, ſo that I paſſe almoſt all my life alone in the fields or mountaines. And if you know not why, heare me, and I will ſhew you. I ſee ſuch tiranny in your iudges, and ſuch robberies as they commit amōg the poore people, and there are ſuch diſſentions in the realme, ſuch iniuries committed therein, the poor cō
                        mon wealth is ſo ſpoyled, there are ſo few that haue deſire to do good, and alſo there are ſo few that hope for remedy in the Senate, that I am determined (as moſt vnhappy) to baniſh my ſelfe out of mine own houſe, and to ſeparate my ſelfe from my ſweete company, to the end my eyes ſhould not behold ſo miſerable a change: for I had rather wander ſolitary in the fields, then to ſee my neighbours hourely to lament in the ſtreets. For there the cruell beaſtes do not offend me, vnleſſe I do aſſault them: but the curſed men though I do ſerue them, yet dayly they vexe mee: without doubt it is a maruellous paine to ſuffer an ouerthrow of fortune: but it is a greater torment when one feeleth it without remedy. And yet my greateſt griefe is, when my loſſe may bee remedied, and he which may, wil not: and he that wil, cannot by any means remedy it. O cruell Romanes, yee feele nothing that we feele, ſpecially I that ſpeake it, ye ſhal ſee how I feele it, only to reduce it to memory, my tongue wil waxe weary, my ioints ſhiuer, my hart trembles, and my fleſh conſumeth. What a woful thing is it, in my country to ſee it, with my eies, to hear Here the villaine layeth open the miſerable eſtate of his Country. with my eares, &amp; to feele it with my hands? Truly the griefes which woful Germany ſuffers are ſuch, &amp; ſo many: that I beleeue yet the mercifull gods will haue pitty vpon vs. I deſire you not to think ſlander of my words: but I deſire you that you would vnderſtād wel what I ſay: for you imagining (as you preſume to be diſcreet) ſhall ſee right well the troubles that come to vs from men, &amp; among men, with mē and by the hands of men: it is a ſmall matter that we as men do feele them ſpeaking: for according to truth, and alſo with liberty, if I ſhould declare euery other iuſt aduertiſement which came from the Senate, &amp; the tirannie which your iudges commit in the miſerable Realme: one of theſe two things muſt enſue, eyther the puniſhment of men, or the depriuation of your Officers, if I ſay true.
                     One thing onely comforteth me, wherof I with other infortunate people haue had experience, in that I doe thinke my ſelfe happy, to know, that the iuſt plagues proceede not from the iuſt Gods, but through the iuſt deſerts of wicked men: And that our ſecret fault doeth waken thoſe to the end that they of vs may execute open iuſtice. Of one thing only I am ſore troubled, becauſe the Gods cannot be contented, but for a ſmall fault they puniſh a good man much: and for many faultes they

puniſh euill men nothing at al, ſo that the Gods doe beare with the one, and forgiue nothing vnto the other.
                     O ſecret iudgements of God, that as I am bound to prayſe your workes, ſo likewiſe if I had licence to condemne them, I durſt ſay, that ye cauſe vs to ſuffer grieuous paines, for that yee puniſh and perſecute vs by the hands of ſuch Iudges, the which (if iuſtice take place in the World) when they chaſtice vs with their hands, they doe not deſerue for to haue their heades on their ſhoulders,
                     The cauſe why now againe, I doe exclaime on the immortall Gods, is to ſee, that in theſe 15. dayes I haue beene at Rome, I haue ſeene ſuch deedes done in your Senate, that if the leaſt of them had beene done at Danuby, the Gallowes and gibbets had beene hanged thicker of theeues, then the vineyard is with grapes. I am determined to ſee your doings, to ſpeake of your diſhoneſty in apparrel your little temperance in eating, and your diſorder in affayres, and your pleaſures in liuing: and on the other ſide, I ſee, that when your prouiſion arriueth in our Country, wee carry into the temples, and offer it to the Gods, wee put it on their heads: ſo that the one meeting with the other, wee accompliſh that which is commaunded, and accurſe thoſe that commaunded, And ſith therefore my heart hath now ſeen that which it deſireth, my mind is at reſt, in ſpitting out the poyſon which in it abideth: If I haue in any thing heere offended with my tong, I am ready to make recompēce with my head. For in good faith, I had rather winne honour, in offering my ſelfe to death, then you ſhould haue it in taking from me my life.
                     And heere the villaine ended his talke, immediately after Marcus Aurelius ſayde to thoſe which were aboute him: How thinke yee my friendes, what kernell of a nut, what The commendation that the Emperour gaue of the Oration of the villaint. golde of the mine, what corne of ſtraw, what roſe of bryers, what mary of bones, and how noble and valiant a man hath he ſhewed himſelfe? What reaſons ſo hie, what words ſo well couched, what truth ſo true, what ſentences ſo well pronounced, and alſo what open malice hath hee diſcored? By the faith of a good man I ſweare, as I may bee deliuered from this feuer which I haue, I ſaw this villaine ſtanding boldly a whole houre on his feet, and all we beholding the earth as amazed, could not anſwere him one word: For indeede the villaine confuted vs with his purpoſe, &amp; aſtonyed vs; to ſee the little regarde he bad of his life.
                     The Senate afterwardes beeing all agreede, the next day following, wee prouided new Iudges for the riuer of Danuby, and commaunded the villaine to deliuer vs by writing, all that he ſayde by mouth, to the end it might bee regiſtred in the booke of good ſaying of ſtrangers, which were in the Senate.
                     And further, it was agreede, that the ſaide villaine (for the wiſe words hee ſpake) ſhould be choſen Senator, and of the Free men of Rome he ſhold bee one: and that for euer he ſhould bee ſuſtained with the common treaſure. For our mother Rome hath alwayes beene prayſed and eſteemed not onely to acquite the ſeruices' which haue beene done vnto her, but' alſo the good words which were ſpoken in the Senate.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP.. VI. That Princes and Noble men ought to be very circumſpect in chooſing Iudges and Officers, for therein conſiſteth the profite of the publike weale.
                     
                     
                        
                           ALexander the great (as the Hiſtoriographers ſay) in his youth vſed hunting very much ſpecially of the mountaines, &amp; that which is to be marueled at, he would not hunt Deare, Goates, Hares, nor Partridges; but Tygers, Leopardes, Elephants, Crocodils, and Lions. So that this mighty Prince, did not onely ſhew the excellency of his courage in conquering proud Princes, but alſo in chaſing of cruell &amp; ſauage beaſts.
                     
                        Plutarch in his Apothegmes ſayeth, that the great Alexander had a familiar ſeruant, named Crotherus, to whome oftentimes hee ſpake theſe wordes:
                     
                        I let thee to vnderſtand Crotherus, That the valiant Princes ought not onely to be vpright in their realm which they gouerne: but alſo to bee 
                        The ſpeech of King Alexander the great. 
                        circumſpect in paſtimes which they vſe, that the authoritie which in the one they haue woune, in the other they doe not loſe.
                     
                     When Alexander ſpake theſe words, truely hee was of more authority then of yeares: But in the ende he gaue this example, more to bee followed, and commaunded, then to bee reproued or blamed, I ſay to be followed, not in the hunting that he exerciſed, but in the great courage which hee ſhewed. To the Plebeians and men of diſcretion, it is a little thing, that in one matter they ſhew their might, and in other things their ſmall power is known: but to princes and great Lords, it is a diſcommendable thing, that in earneſt matters any man ſhould accuſe them of pride, and in things of ſport, they ſhould count them for light. For the Noble and valiant Prince, in thinges of importance, ought to ſhew great wiſdome, and in meane things great ſtoutenes.
                     The caſe was ſuch, that Alexander the Great, hunting on the wilde mountaines, by chance met with a cruell Lyon, and as the good Prince The greate courage of Alexner would winne his honor with the Lyon, and alſo the Lyon preſerue his owne life, they were in griepes the one of the other ſo faſt, that both fell to the earth, where they ſtriued almoſt halfe an houre, but in the ende the Lyon remayned there dead, and the hardy Alexander eſcaped all bloudy.
                     This hunting of Alexander and the Lyon through all Greece was greatly renowmed: I ſay greatly renowned, becauſe the Grauers and Painters drew a portrait forthwith in ſtoneworke, of this hunting, and the grauers hereof were Liſippus and Leocarcus maruellous grauers of anticke workes, which they made of mettall, where they liuely ſet forth Alexander and the Lyon fighting, and alſo a familiar ſeruant of his named Crotherus, being among the dogges beholding them. So that the worke ſeemed not onely to repreſent an ancient thing: but that the Lyon, Alexander, Crotherus, and the dogges, ſeemed alſo to bee aliue in the ſame chaſe.
                     When Alexander fought with the Lyon, there came an Ambaſſadour from Sparthes to Macedonie, who ſpake to Alexander theſe Wordes.
                     
                        Would to God, (Immortall prince)

                        That the force you haue vſed with the lyon, in the mountain, you had employed againſt ſome Pr: for to be lord of the earth.
                     
                     By the words of the Embaſſadour, and the deedes of Alexander, may eaſily bee gathered: That as it is comely for Princes to bee honeſt, valiant, and ſtout: ſo to the contrary, it is vnſeemly for them to be bolde and raſh: For though Princes of theyr goods be liberall, yet of their life they ought not to be prodigall.
                     The diuine Plato in the tenth booke of his laws, ſaith: that the two renowmed Phyloſophers of Thebes, whoſe names were Adon and Clinias, fell at variance with themſelues, to knowe in what thing the Prince is bound to aduenture his life?
                     
                        Clinias ſaide, that hee ought to The phyloſophers ſpeech concerning the honour of Princes. die, for any thing touching his honor, Adon ſaide the contrarie. That hee ſhould not hazard his life, vnleſſe it were for matters touching the affaires of the cōmonwealth. Plato ſaith, thoſe two philoſophers had reaſon, in that they ſaid: but admit that occaſion to dye ſhould be offered the Prince: for the one, or the other:: he ought rather to die for that thing touching iuſtice, then for the thing touching his honor: For there is no great differēce, to die more for the one, then for the other.
                     Applying that wee haue ſpoken, to that we will ſpeake: I ſay, that we doe not deſire, nor we will not, that Princes and great lords doe deſtroy themſelues with Lions in the chace, neither aduenture their perſons in the warres, nor that they put theyr liues in perill, for the cōmon-weale: But wee onely require of them, that they take ſome paines and care to prouide for thinges belonging to iuſtice. For it is a more naturall hunting for Princes, to hunt out the vices of their commonweales, then to hunt the wilde boares, in the thicke woods. To the end Princes accompliſh this which we haue ſpoken we will not aske them time when they ought to eate ſleepe, hunt, ſporte, and recreate themſelues: but that of the 24 houres that bee in the day and night, they take it for a pleaſure and commodity one houre to talke of iuſtice. The gouernment of the comonweale conſiſteth not, in that they ſhould trauell vntill they ſweate and moleſt their bodyes, ſhead their bloud, ſhorten theyr liues, and looſe their paſtimes: but all conſiſteth, in that they ſhould be diligent to foreſee the dammages of their common-wealth, and likewiſe to prouide for good mimiſters of iuſtice.
                     Wee doe not demaund Princes and great Lordes to giue vs their goods; Nor wee forbidde them not to eate, to forſake ſleepe, or ſport, to hunt, or put their liues in daunger: but we deſire and beſeeche them, that they would prouide good miniſters of iuſtice for the common-weale.
                     Firſt, they ought to be very diligent to ſearch them out, and afterwards, to be more circūſpect to examin them: For if wee ſigh with teares, to haue good Princes, we ought much more to pray that we haue not euil officers.
                     What profiteth it the knight to be nimble, and if the horſe be not ready? What auayleth it the owner of the ſhip to be ſage and expert, if the Pilot be a foole and ignorant? What profiteth the king to be valiant and ſtout, &amp; the captain of the warre to be a coward? I meane by this I haue ſpoken, what profiteth it a prince to be honeſt if thoſe which miniſter iuſtice bee diſſolute? What profiteth it vs that the Prince be true, if his Officers be lyers. what profiteth it vs that the Pr: be ſober, if his miniſters be drūkards? what profiteth it that the P: be gentle, &amp; louing, if his officers be cruell &amp; malicious? what profiteth it vs, that the Pr: be a giuer, liberall, and an almeſ-man, if the iudge which miniſtreth juſtice, be a briber, and an open Theefe?
                     
                        
What profiteth it the prince to bee carefull and vertuous, if the Iudge bee negligent and vicious? Finally, I ſay, that it little auayleth, that the prince in his houſe be ſecretly iuſt, if adioyning to that hee truſt a tirant &amp; open theefe with the gouernment of the Common-weale.
                     Princes and great Lords, when they are within their pallaces at pleaſure, their mindes occupied in high things, doe not receyue into theyr ſecret company but their entire friends.
                     Another time they will not, but occupie themſelues in paſtimes and pleaſure: ſo that they know not what they haue to amend in their perſons, and much leſſe that which they ought to remedy in their common-weales: I will not bee ſo eager in reprouing, neyther ſo Satyricall in writing, that it ſhould ſeeme I would perſwade princes, that they liue not according to the highneſſe of their eſtates, but according to the life of the religious: for if they wil keepe themſelues from being tyrants, or being outragiouſly vitious, we cannot deny them ſometimes to take their pleaſures. But my intention is not, ſo ſtraightly to commaund Princes to be iuſt, but only to ſhew them how they are bound to doe iuſtice. Common-wealthes are not loſt, for that their princes liue in pleaſure: but becauſe they haue little care of iuſtice. In the end, people doe not murmur when the Prince doth recreate his perſon, but when he is too ſlacke to cauſe iuſtice to be executed.
                     I would to God, that Princes took an account with God in the things of their conſcience, touching the common wealth, as they doe with men The ſaying of Plutarch to Traian the Emperour. touching their rents and reuenues. Plutarch in an Epiſtle hee wrote to Traian the Emperor ſaith. It pleaſeth mee very well, moſt: puiſſant prince, that the Prince be ſuch one, as al may ſay that in him there is nothing worthy of reprehenſion: but adding therunto, It diſpleaſeth me much more, that he ſhould haue ſo euill Iudges, that all ſhould ſay, in them were nothing worthy of commendation: For the faults of Princes very well may be excuſed: but the offences of the officers can by no meanes bee endured. Many princes and great Lords deceiue themſelus, in thinking that they do their duety in that they be vertuous in their perſons, but it is not ſo: for it ſufficeth not a prince to draw vnto him all vertues, but alſo hee is bound to root all vices out of the cō
                        mon wealth. Admit that princes will not, or of themſelues cannot govern the common-wealth; yet let vs deſire and admoniſh them to ſeeke good Officers to doe it for them: For the poore Plebeian hath no account to render but of his good or euil life: but the prince ſhall render account of his vitious life which he hath led, and of the little care that he hath had of his common wealth. Seneca in an Epiſtle he wrote to Lucilla, ſayth. My deare friend Lucilla, I would gladly thou Good admonitions of Seneca to his friend Lucilla. wouldeſt come and ſee me heere in Rome,: but I pray thee recommend to good Iudges the Iſle of Scicile; for I would not deſire to enioy thy ſight, if through my occaſion thou ſhouldeſt leaue the Common-wealth out of order. And to the entent thou mayeſt know what conditions they ought to haue, whom thou ſhouldeſt chooſe for Gouernors or Iudges: I will let thee vnderſtand, that they ought to be graue in their ſentences, iuſt in their wordes, honeſt in their workes, mercifull in their iuſtice; and aboue all, not corrupted with bribes. And if I do aduertiſe thee of this, it is becauſe if thou diddeſt take care to gouerne thy Commonwealth well, thou ſhouldeſt now bee

circumſpect to examine them, vnto whom preſently thou muſt recommend the gouernement thereof. I would ſay afterwardes, that all that which the ancient philoſophers haue written in many books, and haue left by diuers ſentences.
                     
                        Seneca did rehearſe in theſe few wordes: the which are ſo graue and neceſſarie, that if Princes retayned them in their memory, to put them in execution, and Iudges had them Graue ſentences of Seneca. before their eyes for to accompliſh them, they would excuſe the common wealth of diuers ſlaunders, and they ſhould alſo deliuer themſelues from a great burthen of their conſcience.
                     It is not a thing voluntary, but neceſſary, that the miniſters of iuſtice be vertuous, well eſtabliſhed, and very honeſt: For to Iudges nothing can bee more ſlaunderous and hurtfull, then when they ſhould reproue young men of their youth: others may iuſtly reprehend them of theyr lightneſſe.
                     He which hath a publike Office in the Common wealth, and ſitteth openly to iudge therein, ought to obſerue a good order in his perſon, leſt hee bee noted diſſolute in his doing: For the Iudge which is without honeſty, and conſideration ought to conſider with himſelfe, that if hee alone haue authoritie to iudge of other mens goods, that there are a thouſand which will iudge of his life.
                     It is not onely a burden of Conſcience to princes, to committe the charge of gouernance of the people to diſſolute perſons: but alſo it is a great contempt, and diſprayſe of Iuſtice: For the ſentence giuen of him who deſerueth to bee iudged, is among the people little eſteemed.
                     
                        Plutarch in his Apothegmes ſayeth, that Philip King of Macedonie, Father of the Great Alexander, created for Iudge of a prouince, a friend of his, who after hee ſaw himſelfe in ſuch office, occupyed himſelfe more in kemming his head, then in working or ſtudying his bookes,
                     King Philip being enformed of the vanitie and inſolency of this Iudge, reuoked the power which he had giuen him, and when hee complayned to all of the wrong and griefe which was done vnto him, taking his office from him, K. Philip ſayde vnto him: If I had giuen the office to thee for none other cauſe but being my friend; beleeue mee The ſpeech of King Philip. that nothing in the world could haue ſufficed to haue taken it from thee, becauſe I louing thee ſo entirely as I did, reaſon would not I ſhould haue depriued thee of this office, wherewith I honoured thee, I gaue thee this office, thinking that thou werte vertuous, ſage, honeſt, and alſo a man well occupied, and me thinketh thou rather occupieſt thy ſelfe in beholding thy perſon, thē in gouerning well my Common-wealth: which thou oughteſt not to conſent vnto and much leſſe doe in deed: for the Iudge ought to bee ſo occupied, in the adminiſtration of the Common wealth, that hee ſhould haue no leaſure at any time for to combe his heade.
                     Theſe wordes the good Philip ſpake vnto the Iudge, whom hee diſplaced of his office, for beeing too fine &amp; diligent in combing his head, and trimming his perſon. It is not onely decent for miniſters of Iuſtice to bee graue and honeſt, but alſo it behoueth them to bee true and faithfull: For to Iudge, whoſe office is to iudge the truth, there can bee no greater infamie, then to be counted a lyer.
                     When two Plebeyans bee at variance together for one thing, they

come before the iudge for naught els, but that hee ſhould iudge, who hath right and iuſtice therevnto. Therefore if ſuch a Iuſtice bee not counted true, but a lyer, all take his iudgement for falſe: ſo that if the plaintife hath no more power, hee will obey iuſtice, yet at the leaſt he will blaſpheme him that gaue ſentence.
                     There are ſome Iudges, that preſently to get more money, to drawe vnto them more friends, and to continue alſo in their Offices, vſe ſuch ſhamefull ſhifts with the poore plaintifes, and take ſuch large bribes of the defendant: that both partyes are by himſelfe aſſured of the Sentence, in their fauour, before hee come vnto the Barre.
                     Many goe to the houſes of Iudges, ſome to demaund, others to giue inſtructions, others to worke deceyte, others to win them, others to importune What ma
                              •
                           
                           ter of men Iudges and Officers ought to be thē, but few to go to viſite them: ſo that for thoſe and ſuch ſemblables, I doe aduiſe, and admoniſh Officers, that they be iuſt in their ſentences, &amp; vpright in their wordes.
                     The miniſters of Iuſtice ought to be ſuch, and ſo good, that in their life nothing be worthie of rebuke: neyther in their words any thing worthy of reproche. For, if heerein they be not very circumſpect, oftentimes that ſhall happen, which the Gods vvould not, which is: that to the preiudice of the iuſtice of another, hee ſhall denie the words of himſelfe.
                     It ſufficeth not Iudges to be true in their words: but it is very neceſſarie that they bee vpright in their ſentences. That is to ſay, that for loue they bee not too large, neyther for couetouſnes they ſhould be corrupted, nor for feare drawne backe, nor with prayers to bee flattered, nor with promiſes blinded: For otherwiſe, it were a great ſhame and inconuenience, that the Yarde which they carrie in theyr hands ſhould bee ſtreight, and the life which they lead ſhould be very crooked. To the end Iuſtices be vpright, they ought much to trauell to bee liberall: I meane in things wherein they ought to giue ſentence.
                     It is vnpoſſible that thoſe which haue reſpect in theyr ſentences to fauour their Friendes, ſhould not accuſtomably vſe to bee reuenged of theyr enemyes. Truely, ſuch a Iudge ought not to bee called iuſt: but a priuate tyrant. Hee that with affection iudgeth, and paſſion puniſheth, is greatly deceyued.
                     Thoſe in like manner, which haue authority to gouerne, and doe thinke that for borrowing a little of Iuſtice, they ſhould therby encreaſe and multiplie friends in the common wealth, are much abuſed: For this acte before men is ſo heynous, and before GOD ſo deteſtable, that though for a ſpace he refraine his hands, yet in the ende hee will extend his power. For, the Redeemer of the world, onely Father of Trueth, will not permit that ſuch doe take vppon them the title of Iuſtice, which in their Offices do ſhew ſo extreame wrong.
                     
                        Helius Spartianus, in the life of Anthonius ſaith: that the good Emperour going to viſite his Empire (as he was in Capua,) and there demaunding of the ſtate of the Cenſours, whether they were vniuſt or rightfull? A man of Capua ſaide in this wiſe: By the immortall Gods, moſt noble Prince, I ſweare, that this Iudge who preſently gouerneth here, is neither iuſt, nor honeſt: and therefore mee thinks it neceſſarie that wee depriue him of his dignitie, and I will recount vnto thee, what befell betweene him and mee: I beſought him that for my ſake, hee would graunt me foure things, which were all vniuſt, and hee willingly condeſcended therevnto: wherof I had no leſſe maruell in my hart, then vexation

in my bodie. For, when I did deſire him, I thought nothing leſſe then to obtaine them, but only for the contentation of thoſe which inſtantly deſired me to doe it.
                     And further, this Capuan ſaide; By the God Genius, I ſweare likewiſe, that I was not the more friendly vnto him, for that he ſayde he did it for my ſake, more then for another: For hee that to mee would graunt theſe foure, it is to bee beleeued, that vnto others hee would graunt them foure hundreth: What is requyred in an vpright iudge. For the which, thou oughteſt to prouide moſt noble Prince, becauſe good Iudges ought to be patient to heare, and iuſt to determine.
                     By this notable example, Iudges ought to haue a great reſpect, not to thoſe which doe deſire them: but to that which they demaund. For in doing their duty, their enemyes will proclaime them iuſt: and contrary wiſe, if they doe that they ſhould not doe, their neareſt friends wil account them as tyrants.
                     Iudges which pretend fauour vnto the common-wealth; and to bee carefull of their conſciences, ought not to content themſelues ſimply to doe Iuſtice: but that of themſelues they ſhould haue ſuch an opinion, that none durſte preſume to come and require at their hands, any vile or diſhoneſt thing. For otherwiſe, if we note the demaunder to bee vnſhamefaſte, we muſt needes ſomewhat ſuſpect the Iudge in his iuſtice.
                     Princes ought alſo to bee very circumſpect that the Iudges be not onelie contented to bee iuſt, honeſt, and true: but alſo in them there ought to remaine no auarice, nor couetouſnes. For Iuſtice and Auarice can ſeldome dwell in one houſe.
                     Thoſe that haue the charge of the gouernement of the people, and to iudge cauſes ought to take great heed, that with bribes and preſentes they be not corrupted: For it is vnpoſſible, but that the ſame day that Riches and Treaſures in the houſes of Iudges begin to increaſe, that the ſame day, the true adminiſtration of Iuſtice, ſhould not decay.
                     
                        Lycurgus, Prometheus, and Numa Pompylius did prohibite nothing in their Law ſo much, neyther for any other cauſe they ordained ſo many puniſhments: but to the intent Iudges ſhould not bee ſo couetous, nor yet thieues. And of truth they had great conſideration, to foreſee and forbid it: For the iudge that hath receyued parte of the Thefte, will not giue ſentence againſt the ſtealers thereof.
                     Let not iudges be credited for ſaying they receyue no ſiluer nor golde, neyther ſilkes, nor iewells: but that they take onely ſmall preſentes, as fruites, fowles, and other trifles.
                     For oftentimes it chaunceth, that the iudges doe eate the fruite, and the poore Suter doeth feele the morſell: Cicero in the booke of lawes ſaith, that Cato the Cenſor beeing very aged, the Senators ſaid vnto him one day in the Senate. Thou knoweſt now Cato, that preſently wee are in the Calendes of Ianuary; wherein wee vſe to deuide the Offices among the people. Wherefore wee haue determined to create Manlius and Calidanus Cenſors, for this yeare: wherefore tell vs (as thou thinkeſt) if they be able and ſufficient to ſupplye the rowme? Cato the Cenſour anſwered them in this wiſe.
                     Fathers conſcript, I let you knowe, The wiſe anſwere of Cato. that I do not receyue the one, nor admit the other: For, Manlius is very rich, and Calidanus the citizen extream poore, and truly in both there is great perill. For we ſee by experience, that the rich Officers are too much ſubiect to pleaſures: and the poore Officers are too much giuen to auarice. And further, hee ſaid in this caſe, me thinketh that your Iudges whom yee ought

to chuſe, ſhould not bee ſo extreame poore, that they ſhould want wherewith to care: neither ſo rich, that they ſhould ſurmount in ſuperfluity, to giue themſelus too much to pleaſurs: For men by great aboundance become vitious, and by great ſcarcitie become couetous.
                     The Cenſor Cato beeing of ſuch authoritie, it is but reaſon that wee giue credite to his words, ſince hee gouerned the Romane Empire ſo long ſpace, though in deed all the poore bee not couetous, nor all the rich vitious: yet hee ſpake it for this intent, becauſe both thoſe Romans were noted of theſe two vices: For the poore they deſire to ſcrape, and ſcratch: and the rich to enioy and keepe.
                     Which of thoſe two ſortes of men Princes ſhould chuſe: I cannot, nor dare not raſhly determine. And therefore I doe not counſell them, eyther to deſpiſe the poore, or to Cato his aduiſe in chooſing Officers. chuſe the rich: but that they giue the authoritie of iuſtice to thoſe, whom they know to bee of good conſcience, and not ſubiect to couetouſneſſe. For the iudge, whoſe Conſcience is corrupted, it is vnpoſſible hee ſhould miniſter equall iuſtice.
                     A man may giue a ſhrewde gueſſe of ſuſpition in that iudge, whether hee bee of brittle conſcience, or no, if hee ſee him procure the office of iuſtice for himſelfe: For that man which willingly procureth the charge of conſcience of another: commonly little regardeth the burthen of his owne.

                     The 20, day of Ianuary I receyued thy ſecond letter, and it hapned that thy letter and my feuer tooke mee both at one inſtant: but the feuer grieeued me in ſuch wiſe, that I could not long endure to reade thy letter: Mee thinketh wee haue no ſtay nor meane, thou beeing ſo briefe, and I ſo long: for my long letter hath taken thy grieuous ſorrows from mee, but thy ſhort letter could not take my feuer from me: now that my mind is beating of thy trauell, the deſire that I haue to remedy it, is enflamed: I would tel thee one thing, &amp; ſuccor thee with ſom counſel, but I find that the conſolation which thou wanteſt, I cannot giue thee, and that which I can giue thee, thou needeſt not.
                     
                        
In this letter ſhall not be written that which was in the firſt: but herein I will trauell the beſt I can to anſwer thee. I wil not occupie my ſelf to comfort thee, becauſe I am ſo out of courſe with this diſeaſe, that I haue neyther will to write, ne yet any fauour in any pleaſant things. If perhaps this letter bee not ſauoury, nor compendious, neither ſo comfortable as thoſe which I was wōt to write vnto thee: attribute not the blame vnto my good will, which deſireth to ſerue thee, but to the ſicknes that giueth no place thereunto. For it ſufficeth the ſicke to be contented with medicines, without ſatisfying theyr friendes.
                     If thy comfort conſiſted in writing many letters, and offering thee many words: truely I would not ſticke to doe that for my feuer: but it neither profiteth thee, nor ſatisfieth mee, ſince I haue little, to proffer thee much. Talking now of this matter, I doe remember, that the ancient lawes of the Rhodians ſayd theſe words.
                     We deſire and admoniſh all men, to viſite the Captiues, the Pilgrimes, and the comfortleſſe: and further we Ancient lawes obſerued among the Rhodians. ordaine and commaund that none in the Common wealth be ſo hardy to giue counſell, vnleſſe therewith hee giue remedy: For to the troubled heart words comforteth little, when in them there is no remedy. Of a truth, the Law of the Rhodians is good, and the Romane which ſhall obſerue them much better. Aſſure thy ſelf that I am very deſirous to ſee thee: and alſo I know that thou wouldeſt as gladly ſpeake vnto me, to recount mee all thy griefes.
                     Truely I doe not maruell, becauſe the wounded heart quieteth himſelfe more, declaring his owne griefes, thē hearing another mans conſolations. Thou writeſt vnto me of ſūdry things in thy letter, the effect whereof, that thou certifieſt me is, that the Iudges and Officers in that Realme bee very rigorous and extreame: and that therefore the Cicilians are greatly diſpleaſed with the Senate.
                     Hitherto thou haſt neuer tolde mee lye, the which moueth me to beleeue all that thou writeſt now in thy letter. Wherefore I take it for a thing moſt true, that foraſmuch as all thoſe of Cicill are malitious and enuious, they giue the Iudges fitte occaſion to bee cruell, For it is a generall rule, where men are out of order, the Miniſters of iuſtice ought to bee rigorous. And though in other realms, it chaunced not, it is to be beleeued, that it is true in this Realme: whereof the ancient Prouerbe ſayth, All thoſe which inhabite the Iſles are euill: but the Cicilians are worſt of all. At this day the wicked are ſo mighty in their malice, and the good are ſo much diminiſhed in their vertues, that if by Iuſtice there were not a bridle, the wicked would ſurmount al the world, and the good ſhould vaniſh immediately.
                     But returning to our matter, I ſay, that conſidering with what, &amp; how many euils wee are enuironed, and to how many miſeries wee are ſubiect: I doe not maruell at the vanities that men commit, but I am aſhamed of the cruelty which our iudges execute, ſo that wee may rather call them tyrants which kill by violence, then Iudges which miniſter by iuſtice.
                     Of one thing I was greatly aſtonied, and almoſt paſt my ſenſe, which is, that iuſtice of right pertayneth to God the onely true 
                              •
                           udge. the Gods, and they being offended, will bee called pittifull: and wee others borrow iuſtice, and not beeing offended, doe glorifie our ſelues to be called cruell. I know not what man will hurt another, ſince wee ſee

that the Gods forgiuing their proper iniuries, haue obtained the renowne of mercifull, and wee others puniſhing the iniuries done vnto another doe remaine with the name of the tirants.
                     If the puniſhment of the Gods were ſo ſeuere, as our ſinnes are filthy, and that they ſhould meaſure vs with this meaſure, the only deſert of one offence is ſufficient to take life from vs. With reaſon hee cannot be called a man amongſt men, but a ſauage amongſt the ſauages, that forgetting to be of feeble fleſh, tormenteth the fleſh of his brother. If a man he helde himſelfe from toppe to toe, he ſhall finde not one thing in him to moue him to cruelty: but he What may moue one man to bee mercifull to another. ſhall ſee in him many inſtruments to exerciſe mercy. For hee hath his eyes wherewith hee ought to behold the needy and indigent: hee hath feete to goe to the Church and Setmons, he hath hands to helpe all: hee hath his tongue to fauour the Orphanes, he hath a heart to loue God: And to conclude, hee hath vnderſtā
                        ding to know the euill, and diſcretion to follow the good. If men owe much to the Gods, for giuing them theſe Inſtruments to be pittifull, truely, they are bound no leſſe vnto them for taking from them all occaſions to be cruell. For hee hath not giuen them hornes as to buls, neither nailes as to the cat, nor yet hee hath giuen them poyſon, as to the Serpent. Finally, hee hath nor giuen them ſo perilous feet, as to a horſe to ſtrike, nor hee hath giuen them ſuch bloudie teeth, as to the Lyons to bite, Then ſith the Gods bee pittifull, and haue created vs pittifull, and commaunded vs to bee pittifull: why do our Iudges deſire then to be cruell. O how many cruell and ſeuere Iudges are there at this day in the Romane Empire, which vnder the colour of good zeale to iuſtice, aduenture to vndo the common wealth: For not for the zeale of iuſtice, but for the deſire to attaine to renowne: they haue beene ouercome with malice, and denyed their owne proper Nature.
                     I doe not maruell that a Romane Cenſor ſhould enuie my houſe, will euill to my friends, fauour mine enemies, diſpiſe my children, with euill eyes behold my daughters, couet my goods, ſpeake euill of my perſon: but that which I am aſhamed of is, that diuers Iudges are ſo greedy to teare mens fleſh, as if they were Beares, &amp; mans fleſh were nointed with honey.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VIII. The Emperour continueth ſtill his letter ſpeaking againſt cruell Iudges, and reciteth two examples the one of a pitifull king of Cypres, and the other of a cruell iudge of Rome,
                     
                     
                        BY the ſaith of a good man I ſweare vnto thee friend The Emperour continueth ſtill his letter concerning cruell Magiſtrates. 
                        Antigonus, that I being yong, knew a Iudg in Rome whoſe name was Licaronicus a man of high ſtature, his fleſh neither too fat, nor too leane, his eyes were ſomewhat bloudy and red, he was of the linage of the Senators, and on his face hee had but a little bearde, and on his head he had many white hayres.
                     This Lycaronicus of long time was Iudge in Rome, in the Romane Lawes hee was very well learned, and in Cuſtomes and policies very skilfull and expert, of his owne Nature, hee ſpake little, and in the aunſweres hee gaue, hee was very reſolute.
                     
                        
Amongſt all thoſe which were in Rome in his time, he had this excellencie, which was: That to all hee miniſtred equall iuſtice: and to ſuters with great ſpeede hee gaue briefe expedition, and diſpatched them immediatly. They could neuer withdrawe him by requeſts, neuer corrupt him with gifts, nor beguile him with words, nor feare him with threatnings: neither would hee receyue a bribe of any man, that would offer it him: And beſides this, he was very ſeuere in condition, churliſh in wordes, vnflectible in requeſts, cruell in puniſhments, ſuſpitious in affaires, and aboue all, hee was hated of manie, and feared of all. How much this Lycaronicus was hated, it cannot bee reported: and of how manie hee was feared, no man can thinke. For in Rome when any man was iniuried, hee ſaide: I pray God that Lycaronicus may liue long. When the children did crie, the mothers ſaid vnto them, Take heede of Lycaronicus, and ſtreight way they helde theyr peace: ſo that with the only name of Lycarcnicus, people were The commendations of Lycaronicus for equal iuſtice. aſtonyed, and children kept ſilence.
                     Thou oughteſt alſo to knowe Antigonus, that when any commotion did ariſe in a Cittie, or in anie other Prouince, or that any ſclaunder aroſe and increaſed therein, they were aſſured, and they ſaide that none other ſhould goe thither, but onely Lycaronicus: And to ſay the truth, when he was arriued at that Citie or prouince, the rebells were not onely fledde: but alſo diuers innocents were for feare of his crueltie hidde.
                     For Lycaronicus was ſo reſolute a perſon, that ſome for euill factes: others for conſenting: Some for that they fauoured not the good right: others, for that they kept them ſecrete: none eſcaped to be tormented of his perſon, or puniſhed in goods.
                     Thinkeſt thou Antigonus, that they haue bin fewe whome this Iudge hath cauſed to bee whipt, and carted, caſt into deepe wells, beheaded, taken, baniſhed, and put in the ſtockes, during the time that the Romaines had him with them?
                     By the immortall Gods, I ſweare vnto thee, and as god Genius the God of nature may helpe me, that the Gallowes and Gibbettes were ſo furniſhed with feete, handes, and heads of men: as the ſhambles were, with Oxen, Sheepe, and Kyddes.
                     This Lycaronicus was ſo fleſhly, to ſhead humaine bloud, that he was neuer ſo conuerſant, nor hee neuer had ſo merrie a countenance, as the ſame The cruelty of Lycaronicus. day when he ſhould cauſe any man to be drowned in the riuer of Tyber, hanged in Mount Celio, beheadded in the ſtreete Salario, tormented, or caſt into the priſon Marmortina.
                     
                     Oh cruell: Oh fierce: and vnſpeakeable condition, that this Iudge Lycaronicus had. For it was not poſſible that hee ſhould be brought vppe betweene the delicate armes of the Romanes: but in the vile entrails of you venemous Serpents.
                     I returne once more to ſay: that it is vnpoſsible he ſhould be nouriſhed with the delicate milke of women, but with the cruell bloud of Tygres.
                     
                     If this Lycaronicus were cruell, why did they giue him ſuch aucthoritie? I curſe ſuch aucthoritie. If hee did for that hee had great zeale to Iuſtice: I curſe ſuch zeale of iuſtice.
                     If he did it to winne more honour, I curſe that honour: For, that man ſhall be curſed of the Gods, and hated of men, which taketh life from others, although it bee by iuſtice, onely to increaſe his renowme.
                     The Gods are much offended, and the people greatly damaged, where the Senate of Rome called the Iudge gentle, which is corrupted: and him that is cruell, iuſt. So that nowe amongſt the Romaine people,

thoſe which heale with oyle are not credited, but thoſe onely which cure with fire. If any mā think it, at the leaſt I doe not thinke it, that when Licaronicus dyed, all the cruell Iudges did end with him: For through all the Romane Empire there was no more but one Lycaronicus; and at this preſent there is aboue three or foure in euery Common wealth.
                     Not without teares I ſpeake that which I will ſpeake, which is, that in thoſe dayes as all the Iudges that miniſtred were pittifull, ſo was this Licaronicus renowmed for cruell. But now ſince all are cruell, wee hope in a Iudge which is pittifull. In the The pitty &amp; mercifulnes of Romulus. the firſt Romane King. 12. yeare of the foundation of our mother Rome, the firſt king thereof was Romulus, who ſent a commaundement to all the neighbours and inhabitants therabouts, to the end that all baniſhed men, al thoſe which were afflicted, all thoſe which were perſecuted, and all thoſe which were in neceſſity ſhould come to Rome, for they ſhould bee defended from their enemies, and ſuccoured in their neceſſities.
                     The fame being ſpredde throughout Italy, of the pitty and clemency which Romulus ſhewed in Rome (if the Annalles of the Auncients do not deceiue vs:) Rome was more peopled with inhabitants in ten yeers then Babylon or Carthage in a hundred. O noble heart of Romulus, which ſuch things inuented: bleſſed bee that tongue which commaundeth, that the famous Rome with clemency and pitty ſhould bee founded, In the originall bookes, which were in the high Capitoll, once I found diuers letters written to the ſacred Senate, and Romane people, &amp; in the beginning of the letters, the words ſayd thus.
                     
                        Wee the King of Parthes in Aſia, to the Fathers conſcript of Rome, and to the happy Romane people of Italy, and to all thoſe which with the Romane Senate are confederate, which haue the name of Romanes, and the renowne of clemency, health and tranquility to your perſons, wee doe ſend you, and deſire the ſame of the gods for our ſelues.
                     
                     Behold therefore Antigonus, what titles of clemency had our firſt Romanes, and what example of clemency did the Emperour leaue for them to come: ſo that ſince the barbarous ſtrangers called them pittifull: it is not to be beleeued, that to their ſubiects or naturall countreymen they were cruell.
                     And as the Auncients haue trauelled of all to be well beloued, ſo they at this preſent through their cruelties, ſeeke nothing but to bee feared. If the gods perhappes ſhould reuiue the dead, and ſhould compare the liuing before them in iudgement: I ſuppoſe they would ſay theſe are not their children but their enemies, not encreaſers of the Common-wealth but deſtroyers of the people.
                     I beeing thirty ſeuen yeares of The vertue of an herbe called Ilabia. age, lay in Winter ſeaſon in an Iſle called Chetyn, which now is called Cypres, wherein is a little mountain as yet full of Wood, which is called the mount of Archadia, where groweth an hearbe called Ilabia, which the Auncients ſay, that if it bee cut, it droppeth bloud: and the nature of it is, that if one doe rubbe any man, with the bloud thereof hote, although hee would not) yet hee ſhall loue him, and if they doe annoint him with the bloude that is colde, hee ſhall hate him.
                     Of this hearbe wee neede not doubt any thing at all, for I did proue it, and anointed one with that bloud, who would ſooner looſe his life, then that loue which he bare mee. There was a Kingin that Iſle of great example

of life, and greatly renowned of clemency, though in deed, neyther by writing, nor by wordes I could neuer know his name: but that hee was buried vnder foure pillars in a Tombe of Marble, and about the Tombe were engrauen theſe Greeke and ancient letters, where amongſt other things theſe wordes were engrauen.

HOw thinkeſt thou Antigonus, what Epitaph was this, and what prince ought he to be, of whom I ſhould ſay, his life ought to bee glorious, and his memory eternall? I ſweare vnto thee by the law of a good man: and as the Gods may proſper me, I tooke not ſo much pleaſure in Pompey with his Hieruſalem: in Semiremis with her India: in king Cyrus with his Babylon: in Caius Caeſar, with his Gawles: in Scipio with his Affrike: as I haue in the king of Cypres in his graue. For more glorie hath that king there in that ſharpe mountaine being deade: then others haue had, in prowde Rome, beeing aliue.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. IX. ¶ Marcus Aurelius continueth his Letter againſt cruell Iudges. Of the words which the Emperor Nero ſpake concerning Iuſtice: and of the inſtructions the Emperour Auguſtus gaue to a Iudge, which hee ſent into Dacia.
                     
                        NEITHER for that which I write in this Letter, nor yet for that king Cirus had in his Graue: my intention is not to defende the euil, to the ende that for their euill deedes, and outragiouſneſſe they ſhould bee puniſhed: for by this means it ſhold bee worſe for mee to fauour them, then for them to bee euill: for they The Emperour continueth his letter againſt euil Iudges. through debility do offend, and I by malice doe erre. But in this caſe it ſeemeth vnto mee, and to all others which are of good iudgement, that ſince frailety in men is naturall, and the puniſhment which they giue is voluntary: Let Iudges therefore in miniſtring iuſtice ſhew, that they do it for the weale of the Commonwealth, and not with a mind for to reuenge. To the end the faulty may haue occaſion to amned the faultes paſt, and not reuenge iniuries preſent, the diuine Plato in the books of his Common-wealth ſayde, that Iudges ought to haue two things preſent before their eyes, that is to ſay, that in iudging things touching the good of others, they ſhew no couetouſnes, and in puniſhing any man, they ſhew no reuenge: For Iudges haue licence to chaſtice the bodie: but therefore they haue no licence to hurt theyr hearts.
                     
                        Nero the Emperour was greatly defamed in his life, and verie cruell in his iuſtice: And withall his cruelties it chanced, that as one in a day brought him a iudgement for to ſubſcribe, to behead certain murtherers: Hee fetching a great ſigh, ſayd theſe The cruelty of Nero. with one of his pittiful ſayings. words: O how happy were I, if I had neuer learned to write, onely to bee excuſed to ſubſcribe this ſentence.
                     
                     Certainely, the Emperour Nero, for ſpeaking ſuch a pittifull word at that time, deſerued immortal memory: but afterwardes his ſo cruell life peruerted ſo notable a ſentence.
                     For ſpeaking the truthe, one euil word ſufficeth to deface manie good wordes. O how many realmes and countreyes haue bin loſt, not ſo much for the euills which in thoſe the wicked haue committed, as for the diſordinate Iuſtices which the miniſters of iuſtice therein haue executed.
                     For they thinking by rigour to correct the dammages paſt, haue rayſed vppe preſent ſlaunders for euer. It is knowne to all men who and what the Emperour Auguſtus hath bin, who in all his doings was exceeding good: For, he was noble, valiant, ſtout, fierce and a louer of iuſtice, and aboue

all, very pittifull. And for ſo much in other things hee ſhewed his pitie and clemencie, he ordained that no prince ſhould ſubſcribe iudgements of death with his owne hand: neyther that hee ſhould ſee iuſtice done of any with his owne eyes. Truely the law was pittifully ordained, and for the cleannes &amp; purenes of Emperors very neceſſary.
                     For, it ſeemeth better for Princes to defend theyr Landes with the ſharpe ſword, then to ſubſcribe a ſentence of death with the cruell penne.
                     This good Emperour Auguſtus was very diligent to chuſe miniſters of iuſtice, and very carefull to teach them The carefulnes of Auguſtus in chooſing Iudges. how they ſhould behaue themſelues in the Common-wealth: admoniſhing them not onely of that they had to doe, but alſo of that they ought to flie. For the miniſters of iuſtice, oftentimes faile of theyr duetie.
                     In Capua there was a gouernour named Eſcaurus, who was a iuſt iudge, though hee were ſomewhat ſeuere: whom the Emperour Auguſtus ſent to the realme of Dace, to take charge of that prouince. And amongſt diuers other things hee ſpake theſe wordes vnto him, to retaine them in his memorie.
                     Friend Eſcaurus, I haue determined to plucke thee from Capua: and to put into thy cuſtodie the gouernment of the prouince of Dace: where thou ſhalt repreſente the Royall maieſtie of my perſon: and thou oughteſt alſo to conſider well, that as I make thee better both in honour and goods: So thou in like caſe ſhouldeſt make thy ſelfe better in life, and more temperate in iuſtice, thou haſt been a little too rigorous, and in thy life ſomewhat too raſhe.
                     I counſell thee therefore, I doe deſire thee, and furthermore, I doe ſtrictly command thee, that thou chaunge thy trade, and courſe of life: and haue a great reſpect to myne honour and good name.
                     For thou knoweſt right well, that the onely profite and honour of the Common-wealth of Romaine Princes conſiſteth in hauing good or euill miniſters of their iuſtice.
                     If thou wilt doe that I would wiſh thou ſhouldeſt: I let thee vnderſtand, that I doe nor commit mine Honour in thy truſt, neyther my iuſtice, to the intent thou ſhouldeſt become an enuyer of the innocent, and a ſcourge of tranſgreſſours: but that onely with the one hand thou helpe to ſuſtaine the good, and with the other, thon endeuour to helpe to amend the euill.
                     And if thou wilt more particularly know my intention: I do ſend thee, to the end thou ſhouldeſt be graundfather What is required in an vpright iudge. to the Orphans, an aduocate for the widdowes, a playſter for the grieued, a ſtaffe for the blinde, and a father to all. Let therefore the reſolution of all bee, to reioyce mine enemyes, to comfort my friendes, to lift vppe the weake, and to fauour the ſtrong: So that thou bee indifferent to all, and partiall to none: to the ende, that thorough thy vpright dealing, mine may reioyce to dwell there, and ſtrangers deſire to come, &amp; ſerue me here.
                     This was the inſtruction which the Emperour Auguſtus gaue to the Gonernour Eſcaurus: And if a man will conſider and weigh his wordes well, hee ſhall finde them compendious enogh, that I would they were written in our Iudges hearts.
                     By thy letter thou declareſt that the Iudges whom the Senate ſent to that Iſle, are not very honeſt, nor yet without ſome ſuſpicion of couetouſneſſe: Oh wofull commonwealth, where the Iudges thereof are cruell, diſhoneſt, and couetous? For the cruell Iudges ſeeke nought elſe, but the bloud of innocents, they couet the goods of the poore, and they ſlaunder the good, to

ſuch and ſo wicked a commonwealth. I would ſay that it were better to remaine in the mountaines among the bruit beaſts, then by ſuch vniuſt Iudges to bee gouerned in a Commonwealth: for the fierce Lions (which of all beaſts are moſt cruell) if in his preſence the hunter proſtrate himſelfe on the earth before him, the Lion will neyther touch him nor his garment. O my friend Antigonus, doſt thou thinke, that if the Commonwealth bee vnhappy which hath ſuch Iudges, that therefore Rome may reioyce which prouided them? By the faith of a good man I ſweare vnto thee, that I count the Senators worſe which ſent them, then the Iudges which went thither. It is a great griefe to a noble and ſtout heart to demand Iuſtice of a man, which neyther is true, nor yet obſerueth Iuſtice: but it is a greater griefe to ſee a Iudge, that to many hath executed tyranny, and to many poore men hath done ſundry wrongs, afterwards not with the life hee leadeth, but with the authoritie hee hath, preſumeth to correct diuers iudges.
                     Hee that hath the office to puniſh the vitious, ought himſelfe to bee voyd of all vices: otherwiſe, he that hath that Office, by tyranny executeth iuſtice: and furthermore, he is a traytor to the Common-wealth. It is vnpoſſible that any Iudge ſhould bee good, vnleſſe hee hath the authority of his office for acceſſary, and his pure life for principall.
                     The end why a Iudge is ſent in prouinces, is to define doubtfull cauſes, to reforme their manners, to fauour thoſe that can little, and by violence The reaſon why Iudges are ordained. to enforce thoſe that can doe much. And for the moſt part there is no Common-wealth ſo weake, but may well hang a thiefe vpon the gallouſe, though there came no Iudge from Rome to giue ſentence.
                     O how many Iudges are there now a dayes in Rome, which haue cauſed diuers to bee hanged, regarding nothing but the firſt thiefe: and they remaine free, hauing robbed all the people. Which ought to thinke themſelues aſſured; that though puniſhment be deferred, yet in the end the fault ſhall not be pardoned: for the offences which men in their life time doe diſſemble, the Gods after their death doe puniſh.
                     It is much good for the Common wealth, and no leſſe honour for the Prince, which hath the charge thereof, that the Iudge bee honeſt of perſon, and diligent in iuſtice, and that in no vice (for the which he puniſheth other) he be noted or defamed himſelfe. For much is the office of iuſtice peruerted, when one theefe hangeth another on the gallowes.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. X. The Emperour followeth his purpoſe in his letter againſt cruell Iudges, and declareth a notable Ambaſſage which came from Iudea to the Senate of Rome, to complaine of the Iudges that gouerned that Realme.
                     
                     
                        IN the third yeare The Emperour continueth ſtill his letter concerning cruell Magiſtrates. after Pompeius took the City of Helya, which now is called Hieruſalem: Valerius Gracchus a Romane borne, was ſent at that time into that Region for the Romans, This Gracchus was very ſtout of courage, ſubtil in affayres, and honeſt in life: but notwithſtanding all this, in conuerſation he was vnbrideled, and in the adminiſtration of iuſtice exceeding rigorous: when the Iewes ſaw themſelues not onely ſubiect to the Romanes,

but beſides that euill handeled: they determined to ſend their Embaſſador to Rome, to the intent to informe the Senate of the tyrannies and oppreſſions which were cōmitted in the land: And for to accompliſh the ſame, they ſent a very aged man (as by the haires of his head did appeare) who was learned in the Hebrewe, Greeke, and Latine letters. For the Hebrews are very apt to all Sciences, but in weapons great Cowardes. This Hebrewe came to What the ancient Hebrewes were and their conditions. 
                        Rome, and ſpake to the Senate in this wiſe.
                     O Fathers conſcript, O happy people, your good Fortune and fatall deſtenyes permitting it, or to ſay better: We forſaking our GOD, Hieruſalem which of all the Cities was Ladie and miſtreſſe: and of all the Hebrewes in Paleſtine mother, wee ſee it now preſently ſeruant and Tributarie to Rome: whereof wee Iewes ought not to maruell, neyther yee Romaines to be prowde. For the higheſt Trees by vehement windes are ſooneſt blowne downe.
                     Great were the Armies which Pompeyus had, whereby we were vanquiſhed: but the greater hath our offences bin, ſince by them wee doe deſerue to be forſaken of our God. For wee Hebrewes haue a GOD, which doth not put vs vnder the good or euil fortune: but doeth gouerne vs with his mercie and iuſtice.
                     I will that yee heare one thing by mouth, but I had rather ye ſhould ſee it by experience: which is, That we haue ſo mercifull GOD, that though among fiftie thouſand euill, there was of vs but ten thouſand good: yet he ſhewed ſuch effectuall tokens of great mercie, that both the Aegyptians and the Romaines might haue ſeene howe our GOD can accompliſh and performe more alone, then all your gods together.
                     So it is, we Hebrewes (agreeing in one Faith and vnitie) haue one onely God: and in one God onely we put our whole truſt and beliefe; and him we deſire to ſerue, though we doe not ſerue him, neyther ſhould ſerue him, on ſuch condicion to offend him. He is ſo mercifull, that hee would not let vs proue what his powerfull hand can doe, neyther would hee put our woefull people in Captiuity, as hee hath, nor alſo our GOD can deceyue vs, neither can our wrytings lye.
                     But the greater offenders wee bee, the greater Lords ſhall yee be ouer vs. And as long as the wrath of God ſhal hang ouer vs, ſo long ſhall the power How vn. happie that Realme is, that is forſakē of God. of yee Romaines endure.
                     For our vnhappy chaunce hath not giuen ye our Realme for your deſerts: nor yet for that yee were the rightfull heyres therevnto: but to the ende ye ſhould bee the ſcourgers of our offences, &amp;c.
                     After the will of our God ſhal be fulfilled: after that he hath appeaſed his wrath and indignation againſt vs, and that wee ſhall be purged of our offences, and that hee ſhall behold vs with the eyes of his clemencie: Then we others ſhall recouer that which wee haue loſt, and you others ſhall looſe that which ye haue euill wonne. And it may ſo chaunce, that as preſently of ye Romaines we are commaunded: ſo the time ſhall come that of yee others we ſhall be obeyed.
                     And for as much as in this caſe the Hebrewes feele one, and yee Romaines feele another: neyther yee can cauſe me to worſhip many Gods, and much leſſe ſhould I be ſufficient to draw ye to the faith of one onely God: I referre all to GOD, the creatour of all things, by whoſe might we are created and gouerned.
                     Therefore touching the effect and matter of my Embaſſage, knowe yee now, that in all former times paſt, vntill this preſent, Rome hath had peace with

                        Iudea, and Iudea hath had friendſhip with Rome: ſo that wee did fauour you in the warres, and you others preſerued vs in peace. Generally, nothing is more deſired then peace, and nothing more hated then warre. And further, all this preſuppoſed, we ſee ſee it with our eyes, and alſo do read of our predeceſſors: that the world hath beene alwayes in contention, and reſt hath alwayes been baniſhed: For indeed, if wee ſee many ſigh for peace, wee ſee many more employe themſelues to warre. If yee others would baniſh thoſe from you, which doe moue you to beare vs euill will, and wee others knew thoſe which prouoke vs to rebell, neyther Rome ſhould be ſo cruell to Iudea, nor yet Iudea ſhould ſo much hate Rome.
                     
                     The greateſt token and ſigne of peace, is to diſpatch out of the way, the diſturberbers thereof: for friendſhippe oft times is loſt, not ſo much for the intereſt of the one, or of the other, A token of peace if the diſturbers thereof bee taken away as for the vndiſcreetnes of the Mediators.
                     When one common-wealth ſtriueth againſt another, it is vnpoſſible that their controuerſies endure long: if thoſe come betweene them (as indifferent Mediators) be wiſe. But if ſuch a one which taketh vpon him thoſe affayres, be more earneſtly bent then the enemie wherewith the other fighteth; wee will ſay, that hee more ſubtilly caſteth wood on the fire, then hee draweth water to quench the heate.
                     All that which I ſay (Romanes) is becauſe that ſince the baniſhment of Archelaus from Iudea (ſonne of the great King Herode) in his place you ſent vs Pomponius, Marcus Rufus, &amp; Valerius to bee our Iudges, who haue beene foure plagues, the leaſt whereof ſufficeth to poyſon all Rome.
                     
                     What greater calamity could happen to our poore Realme of Paleſtine, then Iudges to bee ſent from Rome to take euill cuſtomes from the euill, and they themſelues to be inuentors of new vices? What greater Where Iudges are vniuſt, there the commō
                           wealth goeth to ruine. inconuenience, can chance to Iuſtice, then when the Iudges which ought to puniſh the lightneſſe of youth, doe glorifie themſelues to be Captaines of the light in their age? What greater infamie can bee vnto Rome, then when thoſe which ought to bee iuſt in all iuſtice, and to giue example of all vertues: bee euill in all euils, and inuentors of all vices? Wherein appeareth your little care, and much tyrannie.
                     For all ſayde openly in Aſia, that the theeues of Rome doe hang the theeues of Iewrie. What will yee I ſhall ſay more, Romanes, but that wee little eſteeme the theeues which keepe the woods, in compariſon of the iudges which rob vs in our owne houſes.
                     O how wofull were our fatall Deſtinies, the day that we became ſubiect to the Romanes? we feare no thieues, which ſhould robbe in the high way, wee feare no fire, which ſhould burne our goods, nor wee feare no Tyrants, which ſhould make warre againſt vs, neyther any Aſſyrians, which ſhould ſpoyle our countrey: wee feare not the corrupt ayre, that ſhould infect vs, neither the plague, that ſhold take our liues from vs: but we feare your cruell iudges, which oppreſſe vs in the commonwealth, and robbe vs of our good name.
                     I ſay not without a cauſe they trouble the Common wealth: for that layde a part which they ſay, that laid a part which they meane, and that layde apart which they robbe, immediately they write to the Senate to conſent vnto them, not of the good which they finde in the Ancients, but of the lightneſſe which they ſee in the young. And as the Senatours do

heare them here, and doe not ſee them there: ſo you giue more credite to one that hath beene but three monethes in the Prouince, then to thoſe which haue gouerned them common wealth thirty yeares.
                     Conſider Senatours, that you haue made and appointed Senators, in this place, for that you were the wiſeſt, the honeſteſt, the beſt experimented, and the moſt moderate and vertuous.
                     Therefore in this aboue all, ſhall be ſeen if yee be vertuous, in that you doe not beleeue all: For if thoſe bee many, and of diuers Nations, which haue to doe with you: much more diuers and variable are their ententions and ends, for the which they entreate. I lye if your Iudges haue not done ſo many wrongs in iuſtice and forſaken their diſcipline, that they haue taught the youth of Iudea inuentions of vices, which neyther haue beene heard of our Fathers, neither reade in our books, nor yet ſeen in our time. You other Romanes, The counſell of the poore ought not to bee deſpiſed. ſince you are noble and mighty, you diſdaine to take counſell of men that be poore, the which yee ought not to doe, neyther counſell your friendes to doe it: For to know, and to haue little, ſeldome times goeth together: As many counſels as Iudea hath taken of Rome, ſo many let now Rome take of Iudea. You ought to know, though our Captaines haue wonne many Realms by ſhedding bloud, yet notwithſtanding your Iudges ought to keepe them, not with rigorous ſhedding of bloud, but with clemency and winning their heats.
                     O Romanes, admoniſh, command, pray and aduertiſe your Iudges, whom you ſend to gouerne ſtrange Prouinces, that they employ themſelues more to the Common-wealth of the Realme, then their hands to number their fines and forfeites.
                     For otherwiſe they ſhal ſlaunder thoſe which ſend them: and ſhal hurt thoſe whom they gouern. Your Iudges in iuſt things are not obeyed for any other cauſe, but for as much as firſt they haue commaunded marrie vniuſt things.
                     The iuſt commaundements make the humble hearts, and the vniuſt commandements doe turne and conuert the meeke and humble men, to ſeuere and cruell perſons. Humane malice is ſo giuen to commaund, &amp; is troubleſome to be commaunded, that though they commaund vs to do good, wee doe obey euill: the more they commaund vs euill, the worſe they bee obeyed in the good.
                     Beleeue me Romanes, one thing: and doubt nothing therein, that of the great lightneſſe of the Iudges, is ſprung the little feare &amp; great ſhame of the people. Each Prince which The

Let him be well aſſured, that when he leaſt thinketh on it, his honour ſhalbe in moſt infamy, his credit loſt, his goods diminiſhed, and ſome notable puniſhment light vpon his houſe. And becauſe I haue other things to ſpeake in ſecret, I will heere conclude that is open: and finally, I ſay, that if yee will preſerue vs and our Realme, for the which you haue hazarded your ſelues in many perills, keepe vs in Iuſtice, and wee will haue you in reuerence: command vs Romans, and we will obey as Hebrewes; giue a pittifull preſident, and yee ſhall haue all the Realme in ſafegard.
                     What will yee, I ſay, more, but that if you be not cruel to puniſh our weakneſſe, we will bee very obedient to your ordinances, before yee prouide

for to commaund vs, thinke it well to entreat vs: for by praying with all meekeneſſe, and not commaunding with preſumption, ye ſhall finde in vs the loue which the fathers are wont to finde in their children: and not the treaſon which the Lords haue accuſtomed to finde in their ſeruants.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XI. The Emperour concludeth his letter againſt the cruell Iudges, and declareth what the Grandfather of King Boco ſpake in the Senate.
                     
                     
                        AL that which aboue I haue ſpoken, the Hebrewes ſayde, and not without greate admiration The concluſion of the Emperours letter concerning cruell Iudges. hee was heard of all the Senate. O Rome without Rome, which now haſt ought but the walles, and art made a common Stewes of vices. What did deſt thou tell mee, when a ſtranger did rebuke and taunt thee in the middeſt of thy Senate? It is a generall rule, where there is corruption of cuſtom, liberties are alwayes loſt, which ſeemeth moſt true here in Rome. For the Romanes, which in times paſt went to reuenge their iniuries into ſtrange Countries: now others come out of ſtrange Countries to aſſault them in their owne houſes. Therefore ſince the iuſtice of Rome is condemned, what thinkeſt thou that I beleeue of that Iſle of Cicile?
                     
                     Tell mee (I pray thee, Antigonus,) from whence commeth thinkeſt thou ſo great offence to the people, and ſuch corrupton to iuſtice in the Common wealth? If peraduenture thou knoweſt it not, harken, and I will tell thee.
                     It is an order whereby all goeth without order, Thou oughteſt for to know that the Counſellors of Princes being importunate, and the Prince not reſiſting them, but ſuffering them they deceyue him, ſome with couetouſneſſe, other with ignorance, giue from whome they ought to take, and take from whom they ought to giue, they honour them who do diſhonor them, they withhold the iuſt, and deliuer the couetous, they deſpiſe the wiſe, and truſt the light. Finally, they prouide not for the offences of perſons, but for the perſons of offices.
                     Hearke Antigonus, and I will tell thee more. Theſe miſerable Iudges after they are prouided and inueſted in the authority of their Offices (wher of they were vnworthy) ſeeing themſelues of power to commaund, and that the dignity of their offices is much more, then the deſert of their perſons: immediately they make themſelues to be feared, miniſtring extreame iuſtice.
                     They take vpon them the eſtates of great Lords, they liue of the ſweat of the poore, they ſupply with malice The property of euil Iudges and Officers. that which they want in diſcretion: and that which is worſt of all, they mingle another mans iuſtice with their owne proper profit. Therefore heare more what I will ſay vnto thee, that theſe curſed Iudges, ſeeing them ſelues peſtered with ſundry affayres, &amp; that they want the eares of knowledge, the ſayles of vertue, and the ancors of experience, not knowing how to remedy ſuch ſmall euills, they inuent others more greater, they diſtribute the common peace, onely for to augment their owne particular profite.
                     And finally, they bewayle their owne damage, and are diſpleaſed

with the proſperity of another. Nothing can bee more iuſt, that ſince they haue fallen into offices not profitable for them, they doe ſuffer (although they would not) great damages, ſo that the one for taking gifts remaine ſlaundered, and the other, for giuing them remaine vndone. Hearken yet, and I will tell thee more.
                     Thou oughteſt to know, that the beginning of theſe Iudges are pride and ambition, their meanes enuy &amp; malice, and their endings are death and deſtruction: for the leaues ſhal neuer be greene where the roots are A Caue at for Iudges and all other Magiſtrates. drie: If my counſell ſhould take place in this caſe, ſuch Iudges ſhould not bee of counſell with Princes, neyther yet ſhould they be defended of the priuate, but as ſuſpect men they ſhould not only be caſt from the cō
                        mon wealth, but alſo they ſhould ſuffer death.
                     It is a great ſhame to thoſe which demaund offices of the Senate, but greater is the raſhneſſe and boldnes of the Counſellers, which doe procure them: and wee may ſay both to the one, and to the other, that neyther the feare of God doth with draw them, nor the power of Princes doth bridle them, nor ſhame doth trouble them, neyther the Common wealth doth accuſe them: and finally, neyther reaſon commaundeth them, nor the Law ſubdueth them. But hearke and I will tell thee more. Thou oughteſt alwayes to know, what the forme and manner is, that the Senatours Offices giuen more for friendſhippe then for deſert. haue to diuide the offices: for ſometimes they giue them to their friends in recompence of their friendſhip, &amp; other times they giue them to theyr ſeruants, to acquite their ſeruices, and ſometimes alſo they giue them to ſoliciters, to the end they ſhould not importune them, ſo that few offices remaine for the vertuous, the which onely for beeing vertuous are prouided.
                     O my friend Antigonus, I let you to vnderſtand, that ſince Rome did keepe her renowne, and the Comwealth was well gouerned, the diligence which the Iudges vſed towards the Senat, to the end they might giue them offices, the ſelfe ſame ought the Senate to haue to ſeeke vertuous men, to commit ſuch charge into their hands. For the office of iuſtice ought to be giuen not to him which procureth it, but to him that beſt deſerueth it.
                     In the yeare of the foundation of Rome, 642. yeares the Romane people had many warres throughout all the world: That is to ſay, Caius Celius againſt thoſe of Thrace, Gneus Gardon his brother againſt the Sardes, Iunius Scilla againſt the Cimbres; Minutius Rufus againſt the Daces, Seruilius Scipio againſt the Macedonians, and Marius Conſull againſt Iugurtha King of the Numedians: and amongſt all theſe, the warre of the Numidians was the moſt renowmed, and alſo perillous. For if Rome had many Armies againſt Iugurtha to conquer him: Iugurtha had in Rome good friends, which did fauour him. King Boco at that time was king of the Mauritans, who was Iugurthas friend: in the end, hee was afterwards the occaſion that Iugurtha was ouerthrowne, and that Marius tooke him.
                     Theſe two Kings Marius the Conſull brought to Rome, and triumphed The triumph of Marius the Romane Conſull. of them, leading them before his triumphant chariot, their neckes loaden. with yrons, &amp; their eyes full of teares The which vnlucky fortune al the Romaines which behelde lamented, and tooke great pitie of the ſtrangers whō they heard. The night after the triumph was ended, it was decreede in the Senate, that Iugurtha ſhould bee beheaded, leauing king Boco aliue,

depriued of his Country. And the occaſion thereof was this: The Romaines had a cuſtom of long time to put no man to execution before that firſt with great diligēce they had looked the ancient bookes, to ſee if any of their predeceſſors had done any notable ſeruice to Rome, whereby the poore priſoner might deſerue his pardon.
                     It was found written in a booke, which was in the high Capitoll, that the Grandfather of King Boco was very ſage, and a ſpeciall friend to the Romane people, and that once hee came to Rome, and made diuers orations to the Senate, and amongſt other notable ſentences, there was found in that book, that he had ſpoken theſe words: Woe be to that realme where all are ſuch, that neyther the good amongſt the euill,

Woe is that Realme where the good are fearefull, and the euill too bold: Wo on that realme where the patient are deſpiſed, and the ſeditious commended. Wo on that Realm which deſtroyeth thoſe which watch for the good, and crowneth thoſe that watch to doe euill. Woe to that realme, where the poore are ſuffered to bee proud: and the rich tirants. Wo to that realme, where all know the euil, and no man doth follow the good. woe to that realme where ſo many euill vices are openly committed, which in another countrie dare not ſecrrtly bee mentioned. Wo to that realm, where all procure that they deſire, where all attaine to that they procure, where all thinke that this is euill, where al ſpeake that they thinke, and finally, where all may doe that which they will. In ſuch and ſo vnfortunate a realm where the people are too wicked, let euery man beware hee bee not inhabitant: For in ſhort time they ſhall ſee vpon him, eyther the yre of the Gods, the fury of the men, the depoputation of the good, or the deſolation of the Tirants.
                     
                     Diuers other notable thinges were contained in thoſe Orations, the which are not (at this preſent touching my letter, But foraſmuch as we thought it was a very iuſt thing, that they ſhould pardon the folly of the The Nephew pardoned for the good deſert of the Grandfather.

                     CHAP. XII. An exhortation of the Author to Princes and Noble men, to embrace peace, and to eſchew the occaſions of warre.
                     
                     
                        
                           OCtauian Auguſtus, ſecond Emperour of Rome, is commended of all, for that The vertous life of Auguſtus ſecond Emperour of Rome deſcribed. hee was ſo good of his perſon, and ſo wel beloued of all the Romane Empire. Suetonius Tranquillus ſayth, that when any man dyed in Rome in his time, they gaue great thanks to the Gods for that they tooke their life from them, before their Prince knew what death meant. And not contented onelie with this, but in their Teſtaments they commaunded their heires and children, that yearely they ſhould offer great ſacrifices of their proper goods in all the Temples of Rome, to the end the Gods ſhold prolong the dayes of their Prince. That time indeed might bee called the golden age, and the bleſſed land, where the Prince loued ſo well his ſubiects, and the ſubiects ſo much obeyed their prince: for ſeldome times it hapneth that one will be content with the ſeruices of all, neyther that all will bee ſatisfied with the gouernement of one.
                     The Romans for none other cauſe wiſhed for the good Prince (more then for themſelues) life, out becauſe he kept the commonwealth in peace. The vertue of this Prince deſerued much prayſe, and the good will of the people merited no leſſe commendation: he for deſeruing it to them, &amp; they for giuing it to him: for to ſay the truth, there are few in number that ſo heartily loue others, that for theyr ſakes will hate themſelues.
                     There is no man ſo humble, but in things of honour wil be content to goe before, ſaue only in death, where he can be content to come behinde. And this ſeemeth to bee very cleare, in that that now dyeth the father, now the mother, now the husband, now the wife, now the ſonne, &amp; now his neighbour, in the end euery man is content with the death of an other, ſo that he with his owne life may eſcape himſelfe.
                     A Prince which is gentle, patient, ſtout, ſober, honeſt and true, truly hee of right ought to be commended: but The vertues of a godly prince deſcribed. aboue all, &amp; more then all, the Prince which keepeth his Common wealth in peace, hath great wrong if hee not of all beloued? What good can the Common wealth haue, wherin there is warre and diſſention? Let euerie man ſay what he will, without peace no man can enioy his owne, no man can eate without feare, no man ſleepeth in good reſt, no man goeth ſafe by the way, no mā truſteth his neighbour. Finally, I ſay, that where there is no peace, there wee are threatened dayly with death, and euery houre in feare of our life. It is good the Prince do ſcoure the realme of theeues, for there is nothing more vniuſt, thē that which the poor with toile and labour get, ſhould with vagabonds in idlenes be waſted. It is good the Prince doe weed the realme of blaſphemers, for it is an euident token that thoſe that dare blaſpheme the king of heauen, will not let to ſpeake euill of the princes of the earth. It is good the prince do cleare the common wealth of vagabonds &amp; players: for play is ſo euill a mothe, that it eateth the new gown and conſumeth the drie wood. It is good that the Prince doe forbidde his ſubiects of prodigall banquets, &amp; ſuperfluous apparrell: for where men ſpend much in things ſuperfluous,

it chanceth afterwards that they want of their neceſſaries. But I aske now, What auayleth it a Prince to baniſh all vices from his Common-wealth, if otherwiſe he keepeth it in warre. The only ende why Princes are Princes; is to follow the good, and to eſchew the euill. What ſhall you ſay therefore, ſince that in the time of warres, Princes cannot reforme vices, nor correct the vicious.
                     Oh, if Princes and Noble men knew what damage they doe to their countreyes, the day that they take vppon them warre: I thinke and alſo affirme, that they would not onely not begin it, nor yet anie priuate perſon durſte Warre ought to be eſchewed, &amp; peace entertained. ſcarely remember it. And hee that doth counſell the Prince the contrary, ought by reaſon to bee iudged to the Common-wealth an enemie. Thoſe which counſel Princes to ſeeke peace, and to keepe peace, without all doubt they haue wrong if they be not heard: if they be loued: and if they be not credited, For the counſellour which for a light ocaſion counſelleth his Prince to beginne warre: I ſay vnto him eyther choler ſurmounteth, or elſe good Conſcience wanteth.
                     It chaunceth often times that the prince is vexed and troubled, becauſe one certifieth him, that a prouince is rebelled, or ſome other prince hath inuaded his countrey, and as the matter requireth, the Councell is aſſembled.
                     There are ſome too raſhe counſellours, which immediately iudge peace to bee broken as lightly, as others doe deſire that Warres ſhould neuer beginne.
                     When a Prince in ſuch a caſe asketh counſell: they ought forthwith not to aunſwere him ſuddenly. For things concerning the Warres, ought with great wiſedome firſt to be conſidered, and then with as much aduiſement to be determined.
                     King Dauid neuer tooke any warre in hand, though he were very wiſe, but firſt hee counſelled with GOD; The good Iudas Machabeus, neuer entred into Battell, but firſt hee made his K, Dauid a patterne for Princes, how to ſtain warre. prayer vnto Almightie GOD.
                     
                     The Greekes and Romanes durſt neuer make warre againſt their enemies, but firſt they would do ſacrifice to the Gods, and conſulte alſo with their Oracles.
                     The matters of Iuſtice, the recreations of his perſon, the reward of the good, the puniſhment of the euill; and the diuiding of rewards, a Prince may communicate with any priuate man: but all matters of Warre, hee ought firſt to counſell with GOD: For, the Prince ſhall neuer haue perfect victorie ouer his Enemyes, vnleſſe hee firſt committe the quarrell thereof vnto GOD.
                     
                     Thoſe which counſell Princes, (whether it be in matters of warre, or in the affaires of peace) ought alwaies to remember this Sentence: That they giue him ſuch counſells alwayes when hee is alone in his Chamber, as they would doe if they ſaw him at the poynt of death very ſicke. For, at that inſtant, no man dare ſpeake with Flattery, nor burden his conſcience with bryberie.
                     
                     When they entreate of warre, they which moue it ought firſt to conſider, that if it came not well to paſſe, all the blame will be imputed to their counſell. And if that his ſubſtaunce bee not preſently able to recompence the loſſe, let him aſſure himſelfe, that here after his ſoule ſhall ſuffer the paine.
                     Men ought ſo much to loue peace, and ſo much to abhorre warre, that I belieue that the ſame preparation that a Prieſt hath in his Conſcience with GOD before hee preſume to receiue the holy Communion: euen the ſame ought a counſellour to haue, before that vnto his Prince hee giueth counſell concerning warre. Since princes

are men, it is no maruell though they feele iniuties as men, and that they deſire Howmuch euery ought to preferre peace before warre. to reuenge as men. Therefore, for this cauſe they ought to haue wiſe men of their counſell, whereby they ſhould mittigate and aſſwage theyr griefes and troubles. For, the Counſellours of Princes, ought neuer to counſell thing, they beeing angrie, wherwith after they may iuſtly be diſpleaſed, when they be pacified.
                     Following our matter, in counting the goods which are loſt, in looſing peace: and the euils which increaſe in winning warres: I ſay, that amongſt other things the greateſt euill is, that in time of Warre they locke vp cloſely all vertues, and ſet at libertie all vices,
                     During the time that Princes and great Lords maintaine warre, though they bee Lordes of their Realmes and dominions by right, yet for a trueth they are not to indeede.
                     For, at that time the Lordes deſire more to content their Souldiours and ſubiects, then the Souldyers and ſubiects ſeeke to content the Lords. And this they doe, becauſe they through power might vanquiſh their enemies, and further, through the loue of their money, relieue their neceſſities.
                     Eyther Princes are gouerned by that wherevnto by ſenſualitie they are moued, or elſe by that wherewith reaſon is contented. If they will follow reaſon, they haue too much of that How vnſat

                           able a couetous man is. they poſſeſſe: but if they deſire to follow the ſenſuall appetite, there is nothing that will content them For, as it is vnpoſſible to drie vp all the water in the Sea: ſo it is harde to ſatisfie the heart of man that is giuen to couetouſnes.
                     If Princes take vpon them warres, ſaying: that their right is taken from them: and that therefore they haue a conſcience: Let them beware that ſuch conſcience bee not corrupted. For, in the worlde there is no Warre iuſtified: but for the beginning thereof, the Princes at one time or an other, haue their Conſciences burdened.
                     If Princes take vpon them Warre, for none other cauſe, but to augment their ſtate and dignitie. I ſay that this is a vaine hope: For, they conſume and loſe (for the moſte part,) more in one or two yeares warres, then euer they get againe during their life.
                     If Princes take vpon them Warre, to reuenge an iniurie: as well for this alſo it is a thing ſuperfluous: For, manie goe to the warres being wronged onely with one thing, and afterwards they returne iniuried with manie.
                     If Princes take vpon them Warres for none other cauſe but to winne honour: me thinketh alſo that that is an vnprofitable conqueſt: For, me thinketh that Fortune is not a perſon ſo famous, What incō
                           ueniences are incident to Warres. that into her hands a man may commit his honour, his goods, and his life.
                     If Princes take vpon them warre to leaue of them in the worlde to come ſome memorie: this no leſſe them the other ſeemeth to me vaine. For without doubt, if we examine the hyſtories that be paſt, we ſhall finde thoſe to be more in number which haue bin defamed: then thoſe which for vanquiſhing of their enemyes, haue bin renowmed.
                     It Princes take vpon them warres, ſuppoſing that there are in an other countrey more pleaſures and delights then in their owne; I ſay, that to thinke this, proceedeth of little experience, and of leſſe conſcience. For, to a Prince there can bee no greater ſhame, nor conſcience, then to beginne warres in ſtraunge Realmes, to maintaine his owne pleaſures and vices at home.
                     Let no Princes deceyue themſelues, in thinking that there are in ſtraunge

Countries more things then in their owne: For in the end, there is no Land nor nation in the world, where there is not Winter, and Summer, night and day, ſickneſſe and health, riches and pouerty, mirth and ſadneſſe, friends and enemies, vitious, and vertuous, aliue and dead. Finally, I ſay, that in all parts all things What may moue Princes to lo

                            peace, and

                           ate warre. agree in one, ſaue onely the diſpoſitions of men, which are diuers. I would aske Princes and great Lords, the which doe and will liue at theyr pleaſure, what they want in theyr Realmes, yea though they bee little? If they will hunt, they haue mountaines and Parkes: if they will fiſh they haue pondes: if they will walke, they haue riuers, if they will refreſh themſelues they haue baynes: if they will bee merry, they haue Muſitians: if they delight in apparrelling them ſelues, they haue rich clothes: if they will giue, they haue money: if they deſire women, they haue wiues: if they will take their reſt, they haue their Gardens: if Winter annoye them, they haue hote Countries: &amp; if they will eate, they want no meats. Hee that with peace hath all theſe things in his owne Dominion, why then with warre doe hee ſeeke them in a ſtrange Country?
                     Men oftentimes flye from one Countrey to another, not to be more deuoute, nor more vertuous, but to haue greater liberty and oportunitie to haunt vices. And afterwards when they ſee the endes of their deeds, they cannot refrayne their hearts from ſighes, ſince they might haue enioyed that at home with peace, which in ſtraunge Countries, they ſought with troubles.
                     There are ſo few thinges wherewith we are contented in the world, that if perchaunce a man finde in any one place, any one thing, wherewith to content him, Let him beware that the Diuell doe not deceiue him, ſaying: That in ſuch another place he may receate himſelfe better: For whether ſoeuer wee goe, wee ſhall finde ſuch penurie, and want of true pleaſures, and comforts, and ſuch plenty and copious aboundance of troubles and torments that for to comfort vs, in an hundred yeares wee ſcarcely finde one, and to torment vs, wee finde at euery foot a thouſand.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XIII. The Author reciteth the commodities which come of peace, declaring how diuers Princes vpon light occaſions, haue made cruell warres.
                     
                     
                        
                           Dimo an ancient king of Ponto, ſayd vnto Queſtions demaunded by King Dimo, and anſwered. a Philoſopher that was withhim: Tel me Philoſopher, I haue health, I haue honour, and I haue riches, Is there any thing more to bee deſired amongſt men, or to bee giuen of the Gods in this life?
                     
                     The Philoſopher aunſwered him: I ſee that I neuer ſaw, and I heare that I neuer heard: For health riches, and honour, the Gods ſeldome times doe thruſt in one perſon, his time is ſo ſhort that dooth poſſeſſe them, that they haue more reaſon for to pray that they might bee quieted of them, then for to bee proude for that they poſſeſſe them.
                     
                     And I tell thee further King Dimo, It little profiteth that the Gods haue giuen thee all theſe thinges, if thou dooeſt not content thy ſelfe therewith, the which I thinke they haue not giuen thee, nor neuer will
                        
                        giuen thee: For the Gods are ſo iuſt in diuiding their gifts, that to them, to whom they giue contentation, they take from them their riches, and thoſe whom they giue riches, they take their contentation. Plutarch in the firſt of his pollitikes putteth this example, and hee declareth not the name of this Philoſopher.
                     O how great a benefit is that which the Gods giue to Princes and great Lords, in giuing them their health, in giuing them riches, and in giuing them honour: but if beſides thoſe hee giueth them not contentation, I ſay that in giuing them the goods, he giueth them trauell and danger: for if the trauell of the poore be greater then the trauell of the rich: without compariſon, the diſcontentation of the rich is greater then the diſcontentation of the poore.
                     Men little regarding their health become ſicke, little eſteeming theyr riches become poore, and becauſe they know not what honour is; they become diſhonoured. I meane, that the raſh Princes vntill ſuch time as Commodities that follow peace. they haue bin well beaten in the wars, will alwayes little regard peace. The day that you Princes proclaime wars againſt your enemies, you ſet at liberty all vices to your ſubiects: Yet you ſay your meaning is not they ſhould bee euill. I ſay it is true. Yet all this ioyned together, ye giue them occaſiō that they be not good. Let vs know what thing warre is, and then wee ſhall ſee, whether it bee good or euill to follow it.
                     In warres they doe nought elſe but kill men, robbe the Temples, ſpoyle the people, deſtroy the Innocents, giue liberty to theeues, ſeparate friends, and rayſe ſtrife: all the which things cannot bee done without great hurt of iuſtice, and ſcrupuloſity of conſcience.
                     The ſeditious man himſelfe cannot denie vs, that if two Princes take vpon them warres betweene them, &amp; that both of them ſeeme for to haue right, yet the one of them onely hath Warres vniuſtly taken in hand, neuer come to good end. reaſon: So that the Prince which ſhall fight againſt Iuſtice, or defende the vniuſt cauſe, ſhall not eſcape out of that warre iuſtified: Not iſſuing out-iuſtified, hee ſhall remaine condemned: and the condemnation ſhall bee, that all the loſſes, murthers, burnings, hangings, and robberies, which were done in the one, or other common-wealth, ſhal remaine vpon the account of him, which took vpon him the vniuſt warre, Although he doth not find another Prince that will demand an account of him heere in this life, yet hee ſhall haue a iuſt Iudge that will in another place lay it to his charge.
                     The Prince which is vertuous, &amp; preſumeth to bee a Chriſtian, before he beginne the warre, ought for to conſider what loſſe or profite will enſue thereof. Wherein if the end be not proſperous, he loſeth his goodes and honour: and if he perchauce attaine to that he deſired, peraduenture his deſire was to the damage of the Common-Wealth, and then hee ought not to deſire it. For the deſire of one ſhould not hurt the profite of all.
                     When God our Lord did create Princes for Princes, and people accepted them for their Lordes, It is to beleeue that the Gods did neuer commaund ſuch things, nor the men would euer haue excepted ſuch if they had thought that Princes wold not haue done that they were bound: but rather that whereunto they were inclined. For if men follow that wherunto their ſenſuality enclineth them, they alwayes erre: therfore if they ſuffer themſelus to be gouerned by reaſō they are alwayes ſure. And beſides that, Princes ſhold not take vpon thē
                        
warres, for the burdening of their conſciences, the mis-ſpending of theyr goods, and the loſſe of their honour: they ought alſo to remember the duties that they owe to the Commonwealth, the which they are bound to For what reaſon wars ought not to be taken in hand. keepe in peace and iuſtice. For wee others need not gouernours to ſearch vs enemyes, but good Princes, which may defend vs from the wicked.
                     The diuine Plato in his 4. booke De Legibus ſayth: that one demaunded him why hee did exalt the Lydians ſo much, and ſo much diſpraiſe the Lacedemonians, &amp;c?
                     
                     
                        Plato aunſwered: If I commend the Lydians, it is for that they neuer were occupyed but in tylling the Fielde: and if I doe reproue here the Lacedemonians, it is becauſe they neuer knew nothing elſe but to conquere realmes. And therfore I ſay, that more happy is that realme, where men haue their hands with labouring full of blyſters: then where their arms in fighting, are wounded with Swordes. Theſe words which Plato ſpake are very true, and would to GOD that in the gates &amp; harts of Princes they were written.
                     
                        Plinius in an Epiſtle ſayeth: that it was a Prouerbe, much vſed amongſt the Greekes: That hee was king, which neuer ſaw king. The like may we ſay, that he onely may enioy peace, which neuer knewe what warres meant.
                     For, ſimple and innocent though a man bee, there is none but will iudge him more happy, which occupieth his hand kerchiefe to drye the ſweate off his browes: then he that breaketh it to wipe the bloud off his head.
                     The Princes and great Lords which are louers of warres, ought to conſider, that they doe not only hurt in generall all men, but alſo eſpecially the good: and the reaſon is, that although they of their owne wills doe abſtaine from Battell, doe not ſpoyle, doe not rebell, nor ſlay: yet it is neceſſary for them to endure the iniuryes, and to ſuffer their owne loſſe and damages: For none are meete for the warre, but thoſe which little eſteeme theyr life; and much leſſe their conſciences.
                     If the warre were only with the euill againſt the euill, and to the hurte and hinderance of the euill, little ſhould they feele, which preſume to be good. But I am ſorrie the good are perſecuted: the good are robbed: and the good are ſlaine. For, if it were otherwiſe (as I haue ſaide,) the euill againſt the euill, we would take little thought both for the vanquiſhing of the one, and much leſſe for the deſtruction of The warre, deſtruction, of the good and godly men. the other. I aske nowe, what fame, what honour, what glorie, what victorie, or what Riches in that warre can be wonne, wherin ſo many good, vertuous, and wiſe men are loſt?
                     There is ſuch penurie of the good in the world, and ſuch neede of them in the common-wealth: that if it were in our power, we with our tears ought to plucke them out of their graues, and giue them life: and not to leade them into the Warres, as to a ſhambles to be put to death.
                     
                        Plinie in one Epiſtle, and Seneca in another, ſay: that when they deſired a Romaine Captaine that with his armey he ſhould enter into a great danger, whereof great honour ſhould enſue vnto him, and little profite to the Commonwealth. He made anſwere.
                     
                        For nothing would I enter into that daunger, if it were not to giue life to a Romane Citizen: For I deſire rather to goe enuironned with the good in Rome, then to goe loaden with treaſures into my Countrey.
                     
                     Comparing Prince to Prince, and law to law, and the Chriſtan with the Pagan: without compariſon the ſoule of a Chriſtian ought more to be eſteemed thē the life of a Romane; For the good Romane obſerueth it as a law, to dye in the warre, but the good chriſtian hath the precept, to liue in peace.
                     
                        
                        Snetonius Tranquillus in the ſecond Booke of Caeſars ſayeth, That among all the Romane Princes there was no Prince ſo well beloued, nor yet in the warres ſo fortunate as Auguſtus was.
                     
                     And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe that Prince neuer beganne any war, The reaſon why the Emperozr Auguſtus was o fortunate. vnles by great occaſion he was thereunto prouoked. O, of how manie princes (not Ethnicks, but Chriſtians) we haue heard and read all contrary to this, which is, that were of ſuch large conſcience, that they neuer took vpon them any warre that was iuſt, to whom I ſwear and promiſe, that ſince the warre which they in this worlde beganne, was vniuſt: the puniſhment which in another they ſhall haue is moſt righteous.
                     Xerxes King of the Perſians being one day at dinner, one brought vnto him verie faire and ſauourie figges of the prouince of Athens: the which beeing ſet at the table, hee ſware, by the immortall Gods, and by the bones of his predeceſſors, that hee would neuer eate figges of his Countrey, but of Athens, which were the beſt of all Greece. And that which by words of mouth king Xerxes ſweare, by valiant deedes, with force and ſhield hee accompliſhed, and went forthwith to conquer Grecia, for no other cauſe but for to fill himſelfe with the figges of that Countrey, ſo that hee beganne that warre not only as a light prince, but alſo as a vitious man.
                     
                        Titus Liuius ſayeth, that when the French men did taſte of the wine of Italy, immediately they put them ſelues in Armes, and went to conquer the Country, without hauing any other occaſion to make warre againſt them: So that the Frenchmen for the licoriouſneſſe of the pleaſant wines, loſt the deare bloud of their owne hearts.
                     King Antigonus dreamed one night, that hee ſaw King Methridates with a Sithe in his hand, who like a Mower did cut all Italy, And there fell ſuch feare to Antigonus, that hee A dreame of King Antigonus. determined to kill King Methridates: ſo that this wicked prince for crediting a light dreame, ſet all the world in an vprore.
                     The Lumbardes being in Pannonia, heard ſay that there was in Italy ſweet fruits, ſauourie fleſh, odorifetous Wines, faire Women, good Fiſh, little colde, and temperate heate: the which newes moued them not onely to deſire them, but alſo they tooke weapons to goe conquer Italie: So that the Lumbardes came not into Italy to reuenge them of their enemies, but to bee there more vicious and riotous.
                     The Romanes and the Carthagenians were friendes of long time, but after they knew that there was in Spaine great mynes of gold and ſiluer, immediately aroſe betweene them exceeding cruell warres, ſo that thoſe two puiſſant Realmes, for to take from each other their goods, deſtroied their owne proper Dominions.
                     The Authors of the aboue ſaide, were Plutarchus, Paulus Diaconus, Beroſus, and Titus Liutus. O ſecrete iudgements of God, which ſuffereſt ſuch things! O mercifull goodnes of thee my Lord, that permitteth ſuch things, that through the dreame of one prince in his chamber, another for to robbe the treaſures of Spaine, another to flye the colde of Hungarie, another to drinke the Wines of Italy, another to eate figs of Greece, ſhould put all the Countrey to fire and bloud.
                     Let not my penne bee cruell againſt all Princes which haue vniuſt warres: For as Traianus ſayd, Iuſt warre is more worth then fained peace.
                        
I commend, approue, and exalt princes which are carefull and ſtout, to defend and keepe that which their predeceſſors left them: For admitte that for diſpoſſeſſing them, hereof commeth all the breach with other princes.
                     Looke how much his enemy offendeth his conſcience for taking it: ſo much offendeth he his Commonwealth for not defending it. The wordes which the diuine Plato ſpake in the firſt booke of his Lawes, did ſatisfie me greatly, which were theſe: It is not meete we ſhould be too extream in commending thoſe which haue peace: nor let vs bee too vehement in reproouing 
                        A true ſaying of Plato. 
                        thoſe which haue warre: For it may bee now, that if one haue warre, it is to the end to attaine peace, And for the contrary, if one haue peace, it ſhall be to the end to make warre. Indeed Plato ſayd very true For it is more worth to deſire ſhort warre for long peace, then ſhort peace for long warre.
                     
                     The Philoſopher Chilo being demanded whereby a good or euill Gouernour might be knowne, he anſwered. There is nothing whereby a good and euill man may bee better known then in that for which bey ſtriue. For the tyrannous Prince offereth himſelfe to aye to take from another, but the vertuous Prince trauelleth to defend his owne.
                     
                     When the Redeemer of this world departed from this world, hee ſayde not, I giue yee my warre, or leaue yee my warre: but I leaue you my peace, Our Sauiour Chriſt the true patterne of peace. and giue you my peace. Thereof enſueth, that the good Chriſtian is bound to keepe the peace, which Chriſt ſo much commaunded, then to inuent warre to reuenge his proper iniurie, which God ſo much hated.
                     If Princes did that they ought for to doe, and in this caſe would beleeue mee: for no temporall thing they ſhould condiſcend to ſhedde mans bloud, if nothing elſe, yet at the leaſt the loue of him which on the Croſſe ſhedd his precious bloud for vs, ſhould from that cleane diſſwade vs. For the good Chriſtians are commaunded to bewayle their owne ſinnes: but they haue no licence to ſhed the bloud of their enemies.
                     Finally, I deſire, exhort, and further admoniſh all princes and great Good coū
                           ſell, and worthy to be followed. Lords, that for his ſake that is prince of peace, they loue peace, procure peace, keepe peace, and liue in peace. For in peace they ſhall bee rich, and their people happie.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XIIII. The Emperour Marcus Aurelius writeth to his friend Cornelius, wherein hee deſcribeth the diſcommodities of warre, and the vanitie of Triumph.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArcus Aurelius wiſheth to thee Cornelius his faithfull friend, health to thy perſon, and good lucke againſt all euil fortune. Within fifteene dayes after I came from the warre of Aſia, whereof I haue triumphed here in Rome, remembring that in times paſt thou wert a companion of my trauell: I ſent immediately to certifie thee of my triumphes: For the noble hearts doe more reioyce of their friends ioy, then they do of their owne proper delights.
                     If thou wilt take paines to come when I ſend to call thee, bee thou aſſured, that on the one part, thou ſhalt haue much pleaſure to ſee the

great abundance of riches that I haue brought out of Aſia, and to beholde my receiuing into Rome: and on the other, thou canſt not keepe thy ſelfe from weeping to ſee ſuch a ſorte of Captiues (the which entred in before the triumphant chariots) bound and naked, to augment the conquerours moſt glory: and alſo to them vanquiſhed to be a greater ignomie. Seldome times we ſee the Sun ſhine bright all the day long, but firſt in the Summer there hath beene a miſt, or if it be in the winter, there hath beene a froſt.
                     By this Parable, I meane, that one of the miſeries of this world is, that wee ſhall ſee few in this world which now bee proſperous: but before haue had fortune, in ſome caſes, very malitious: For wee ſee by experience, ſome come to bee very poore, and other chaunce to attaine to great riches: ſo that through the empoueriſhing of thoſe, the other become rich and proſperous.
                     The weapon of the one cauſeth the other to laugh: ſo that if the bucket that is empty aboue, doth not goe downe, the other which is ful beneath cannot come vp.
                     Speaking therefore according to ſenſuality, thou wouldeſt haue beene glad that day to haue ſeene our triumph, with the abundance of riches, the great number of Captiues, the diuerſity of beaſts, the valiantnes of the Captaines, the ſharpeneſſe of wittes Dangers incident to warres. which wee brought from Aſia, and entred into Rome, wherby thou mighteſt well know the daungers that wee eſcaped in the ware.
                     Wherefore ſpeaking the truth the matter betweene vs and our enemies was ſo debated, that thoſe of vs that eſcaped beſt, had their bodies ſore wounded, and their veins alſo almoſt without bloud.
                     I let thee know my Cornelius, that the Parthians are warlike men, &amp; in dangerous enterpriſes very hardie and bold. And when they are at home in their Country, euery one with a ſtout hart defendeth his houſe: and ſurely they doe it like good men, and valiant Captaines: For if we other Romanes, without reaſon, and through ambition, doe goe to take an other mans, it is meete and iuſt, that they by force doe defend their owne.
                     Let no man through the aboundance of malice, or want of wiſedom enuie the Romane Captaine; for any triumph that is giuen him by his mother Rome: for ſurely to get this onely one dayes honour, he aduentureth his life a thouſand times in the field: I will not ſpeake all that I might ſay of them that wee ledde foorth to the warres, nor of them which wee leaue here at home in Rome, which bee all cruell Iudges of our fame: for theyr iudgement is not vpright according to equity, but rather proceedeth of malice and enuie. Though they take mee for a patient men, and not farre out of order, yet I let thee know my Cornelius, that there is no patience can ſuffer, nor heart diſſemble to ſee many Romanes to haue ſuch great enuie, (which through their malitious tongues) paſſe not to backebite other mens triumphes. For it is an olde diſeaſe of euill men, through malice to backebite that with theyr tongue, which through their cowardneſſe, they neuer durſt enterpriſe with their hands.
                     Notwithſtanding all this, you you muſt know, that in the warre you muſt firſt often hazard your life, and Enuie and malice a deadly foe to true honour. afterwards to the diſcretion of ſuch tongues commit your honour. Our folly is ſo fooliſh, and the deſires of men ſo vaine, that more for one vaine word, then for any profite, wee deſire rather to get vaine glory with traue),

then to ſeeke a good life, with reſt. And therefore willingly wee offer our liues now, to great trauell and paine: onely that among vaine men hereafter we may haue a name.
                     I ſweare by the immortall Gods, vnto thee my Cornelius, that the day of my triumph, whereas to the ſeeming of all thoſe of this world, I went triumphing in the chariot openly: yet I enſure thee my heart wept ſecretly: Such is the vanitie of men, that thogh of reaſon wee be admoniſhed, called, Mā putteth his life in danger only to winne honour. and compelled, yet if we flie from her, and contrarie: though wee be rebuked, euill handeled, and diſpiſed of the world, yet we will ſerue it.
                     If I bee not deceyued, it is the proſperitie of Fooliſh men, and want of good iudgements, that cauſe the men to enter into others Houſes by force, rather then to be deſirous to be quiet in their owne, with a good will. I meane that wee ſhould in following vertue ſooner bee vertuous, then in haunting vices, be vicious: for ſpeaking the truth, men which in all, and for all deſire to pleaſe the world, muſt needes offer themſelues to great trauell and care.
                     Oh Rome, Rome, curſed be thy folly, and curſed be he that in thee brought vp ſo much pride, and be he curſed of men, and hated of Gods, which in thee hath inuented ſuch pompe. For, very fewe are they, that worthily vnto it haue attained: but infinite are they, which through it haue periſhed.
                     What greater vanitie, or what equall lightnes can bee, then that a Romaine captaine, becauſe hee hath conquered Kingdomes, troubled quyet men, deſtroyed citties, beaten downe caſtles, robbed the poore, enriched tyrants, caried away treaſors, ſhed much bloud, made infinite widowes, and taken many Noble mens liues, ſhould be afterwardes (with great triumph of Rome,) receyued in recompence of all this damage?
                     Wilt thou now that I tell thee a greater follie, which aboue al other is greateſt? I let thee know, infinite are they that dye in the wars, and one only carieth away the glorie thereof: So that theſe wofull and miſerable men, thogh for their carkas they haue not a graue, yet one captaine goeth triumphing alone through Rome. By the immortall Gods I ſweare vnto thee, and let this paſſe ſecretly, as between friends, that the day of my triumph, when I was in my triumphant chariot, beholding the miſerable captiues, loden with yrons, and other men carrying infinite treaſours, which wee had euill gotten: and to ſee the carefull widowes weepe for the death of theyr Husbandes, and remembred ſo many noble Romans that loſt their liues in Affrike: thogh I ſeemed to reioice outwardly, yet I enſure How little the Emperour Marc: Aurelius eſteemed vaine honours. thee I did weepe drops of bloud inwardly. For he is no man borne in the worlde, but rather a Furie, bred vp in hell among the Furies: that can at the ſorrowes of another take any pleaſure.
                     I know not in this caſe what reputation the Prince, or Captaine ſhould make of himſelfe, that commeth from the Warres, and deſireth to enter into Rome? For, if hee thinke (as it is reaſon) on the wounds he hath in his bodie, or the Treaſors which he hath waſted, on the places that he hath burnt, on the perills that he hath eſcaped, on the iniuryes which hee hath receiued, the multitudes of men which vniuſtly are ſlaine, the Friends which hee hath loſt, the enemies which he hath goten, the litle reſt that he hath enjoyed, and the great trauels that he hath ſuffered: in ſuch caſe I ſay, that ſuch a one with ſorowful ſighs ought to lamēt, &amp; with bitter teares ought to be receiued. In this caſe of triumphing. I neither commend the Aſſyrians, nor enuie the Perſians, nor am content with the Macedonians, nor allowe the Caldeans, nor content me with the Greekes.
                     
                     
                        
I curſe the Troians, and condemne the Cathagenians, becauſe that they proceeded not acording to the zeale of iuſtice, but rather of the rage of pride, to ſet vp triumphes, endamaged their countries, and left an occaſion to vndoe vs.
                     O curſed Rome, curſed thou haſt beene, curſed thou art, and curſed thou ſhalt be: For if the fatall deſtenies Wherefore the Emperour curſed Rome. doe not lye vnto mee, and my iudgement deceiue me not, and fortune faſten not the naile: they ſhall ſee of thee Rome in time to come, that which we others preſently ſee of the Realmes paſt. Thou oughteſt for to know, that as thou by tyranny haſt made thy ſelfe Lady of Lords: ſo by iuſtice thou ſhalt returne to bee the ſeruant of ſeruants.
                     O vnhappy Rome, and vnhappy againe, I returne to call thee. Tell mee I pray thee, why art thou at this day ſo dear of Marchandize, &amp; ſo cheape of folly? where are the ancient fathers which builded thee, and with their vertues honored thee? in whoſe ſtead preſently thou magnifyeſt ſo manie tirants, which with their vices deface thee. Where are all thoſe noble and vertuous Batons, which thou haſt nouriſhed, in whoſe ſtead thou haſt now ſo many vicious and vagabonds? Where are thoſe, which for thy liberty did ſhed their bloud, in whoſe ſtead now thou haſt thoſe, that to bring thee into ſubiection, haue loſt their life? Where are thy valiant Captaines, which with ſuch great trauell did endeauour themſelues to defend the walls from enemies, in whoſe ſtead haue ſucceeded thoſe that haue plucked them down, and peopled them with vices and vicious? where are thy great prieſts, they which did alwayes pray in the temples, in whoſe ſtead haue ſucceeded thoſe, that know not but to defile the churches, and with their wickedneſſe to moue the gods to wrath? where are thoſe ſo many Philoſophers and Oratours which with their counſell gouernd thee? in whoſe ſtead haue now ſucceeded ſo many ſimple and ignorant, which with their malice doe vndoe thee? O Rome, all thoſe Auncients haue forſaken thee, and wee ſucceeded thoſe which now are new, &amp; if thou kneweſt truely the vertue of them, and diddeſt conſider the lightneſſe of vs: the day that they ended their life, the ſelfe ſame day not one ſtone in thee ſhould haue beene lefte vpon another. And ſo thoſe fields ſhould haue ſauoured of the bones of the vertuous, which now ſtinke of the bodies of the vicious.
                     Peraduenture, thou art more auncient then Babylon, more beautifull then Hieruſalem, more rich then Carthage, more ſtrōg then Troy, more in circuite then Corinth, more pleaſāt Rome in ancient time the moſt flouriſhing City of the world. then Tirus, more fertile then Conſtantinople, more high then Camena, more inuincible then Aquileta, more priuiledged then Gādes, more enuironed with Towers then Capua, and more flouriſhing then Cantabria.
                     
                     We ſee that all thoſe notable Cities periſhed, for all their vertuous defenders: and thinkeſt thou for to remaine, being repleniſhed with ſo much vice, and peopled with ſo many vitious?
                     O my mother Rome, take one thing for a warning, that the glory which now is of thee, was firſt of them, and the ſame deſtructiō that was of them ſhall hereafter light vpon thee for ſuch is the world.
                     For thus goeth the world, euen as we preſently ſee the troubles of them that be paſt: ſo ſhall thoſe that be to come, ſee ours that be preſent.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XV. Marcus Aurelius goeth on with his Letter, and declareth the order that the Romanes vſed in ſetting foorth their men of warre, and of the outragious villanies which Captaines and Souldiers vſe in the warre.
                     
                     
                        I Will now declare vnto thee, my frend Cernelius, the order which wee haue to The Emperour goeth on with his letter, touching the order of warre. ſet foorth men of Warre and thereby thou ſhalt ſee the great diſorder that is in Rome: For in the olde time there was nothing more looked vnto, nor more corrected then was the diſcipline of Warre: And for the contrary, now a dayes there is nothing ſo diſſolute, as are our wen of warre.
                     Newes once ſpred abroad throgh the Empire, how the Prince doeth take vpon him any warre, immediately diuers opinions engender amongſt the people, and euery one iudgeth diuerſly vpon the warre: For as much as one ſayeth it is iuſt, and the Prince that taketh it vpon him is iuſt. Others ſay, that it is vniuſt, and that the Prince which beganne it is a tyrant: The poore and ſedtious perſons doe allow it, to the end they might goe, and take other mens goods by force. The rich and patient doe condemne it, becauſe they would enioy theyr owne in quiet: So that they doe not iuſtifie or condemne warre, according to the zeale of iuſtice: but according to the little or much profite, that ſhall follow them of that enterpriſe: I commād which am a Romane Emperor, warre to be proclamed, becauſe a City or prouince hath rebelled, and that according to their Cuſtome they doe not obſerue the ceremonies of Rome. Firſt you muſt vnderſtand, the Prieſts muſt be called to go immediately to pray to the immortal Cuſtomes which the Romanes vſed before they went to the war. Gods: for the Romane people neuer went to ſhead the bloud of theyr Enemies in warres: but firſt the Prieſts did ſhed the tears of their eyes in the Temples.
                     Secondly, all the ſacred Senate doth goe to the Temple of the God Iupiter, and there they ſware all with a ſolemne oath, that if the enemies, (againſt whom they goe) do require a new confederation with Rome, or demaund pardon of their faults committed: that (all reuengement laid aſide) they ſhal not deny to giue them mercy.
                     Thirdly, the Conſull which is appointed for to bee the Captaine of the warre, went to the High Capitoll, and there hee maketh a ſolemn vow to one of the Gods, which liketh him beſt, that hee will offer him a certaine Iewell, if hee returne victorious of the ſame Warre: and though the Iewell which hee doth promiſe, bee of great value, yet all the people are bound for to pay it.
                     The fourth is, that they ſet vp in the Temple of Mars the Enſigne of the Eagle, which is the auncient Romane Enſigne, and that is, that all the Romanes take it for commandement, that no ſpectacle nor feaſt bee celebrated in Rome, during the time that their brethren be in the warres.
                     The fift, A Pretour mounteth vppe to the roppe of the gate of Salaria: and there hee bloweth the Trumpet for to muſter men of Warre, and they bring foorth the Standers and Enſignes, to diuide them among the Captaines.
                     
                        
How fearefull a thing it is to ſee, that ſo ſoone as the Captaine is enuironed with the enſigne, ſo ſoone hath he licence to commit all euills and villanies. So that hee taketh it for a brauery to robbe the Countries whereby hee paſſeth, and to deceyue thoſe with whom hee practiſeth. What liberty Captaines and Gouernours of warre haue to doe euill, and to be euill, it is very manifeſt in thoſe whom they lead in their company: For the ſonnes leaue their fathers, the ſeruants their Lords, the Schollers their Maſters, the Officers, their offices, the Prieſts their Temples, the amorous their loues: and this for none other cauſe, but that vnder the colour of the warre, their vices ſhould not bee puniſhed by iuſtice.
                     O my friend Cornelius, I know not how I ſhould begin to ſay that which I will tell thee. Thou oughteſt to know, that after our men of war are gone out of Rome, they neyther feare the Gods, neyther honour the Temples, they reuerence not the Prieſts, they haue no obedience to their Fathers, nor ſhame to the people, dread of iuſtice, neyther compaſſion of their Country, nor remember that they are children of Rome: and yet very few of them thinke to end theyr life, but that all ſhame layde aſide, they loue the condemned idleneſſe, and hate the iuſt trauell. Therefore hearke, I will tell thee more, &amp; thogh it ſeemeth much that I ſpeake, I enſure thee it is but little in reſpect of that they do, for ſo much as ſome rob temples, others ſpread rumors: theſe breake the dores, and thoſe robbe the Gods. Sometimes they take the free, The great outrages that the Romane ſouldiers did. ſometimes they looſe the bond. The nights they paſſe in playes, the dayes in blaſphemies, to day they fight like Lions, to morrow they flye like cowards. Some rebell againſt the Captaines, and others flie to the enemies. Finally, for all good they are vnable: and for all euill they are meet. Therefore to tell thee of their filthineſſe, I am aſhamed to deſcribe them.
                     They leaue their owne wiues, and take the wiues of others, they diſhonour the daughters of the good, and they beguile the innocent Virgines: there is no neighbout but they doe couet, neyther hoſteſſe but that they doe force, they breake their old wedlocke, and yeerely ſeeke a new marriage: ſo that they do all things what they liſt, and nothing what they ought.
                     Doeſt thou thinke preſently, my friend Cornelius, that there are few euils in Rome, fith ſo many euill women do goe to the warre? Heere for their ſake, men offend the Gods: they are traytors to their Countrey, they deny their patentage, they doe come to extreame pouerty, they liue in infamie, they robbe the goods of others, they waſte their owne, they neuer haue quiet life, neyther remayneth any truth in their mouthes: Finally, Lewde women oftentimes the cauſe of warre. for the loue of them, oftentimes war is moued again, and many good men loſe their liues. Let vs leaue the reaſons, and come to Hiſtories.
                     Thou knoweſt right well, that the greateſt part of Aſia, was conquered and gouerned, more with the Women Amazones, then with any barbarous people.
                     That young, noble and valiant Porro, King of Iudea, for want of men and abundance of women, was ouercome of the great Alexander. Hannibal the terrible Captaine of the Carthagenians was alwayes Lord of Italy, vntill hee did permit women to goe to the warre. And when he fell in loue with a maden of Capua, they ſaw him immediately turne his ſhoulders vnto Rome. If Scipio the Affricane had not ſcoured the Romane Armyes

of Leacherie, the invincible Numantia had neuer bin wonne.
                     The captaine Sylla in the warres of Mithridates, and the couragious Marius, in the warres of the Zimbres, had ouer their enemies ſo many victories, becauſe in theyr Camps they ſuffered no women.
                     In the time of Claudius the Emperour, the Tharentines and Capuanes were very mortal enemres: inſomuch as the one againſt the other, pitched their Campes; and by chaunce one day in the campe of the Capuanes, two captaines fell at variance, becauſe they both loued one Woman: and when the Tharentines perceyued theyr diſſenſion, immediately with their power they gaue them the onſet.
                     Whereof enſued, that through the What miſchiefe followed, by the

                     I had in this warre of Parthes ſixteen thouſand Horſemen, and twenty foure thouſand footmen, and 35. thouſand women, and the diſorder in this caſe was ſo great, that from the Hoſt I ſent my wife Fauſtine, and the wiues of diuers other Senatours home to their houſes, that they ſhould keepe the olde, and nouriſh the young.
                     Our Fathers led women in the olde time to the warres, to dreſſe meare for the whole, and to cure the wounded: but now we lead them to the ende cowardes ſhould haue occaſion to bee Effeminate, and the valiaunt to be vicious. And in the ende, theyr Enemies doe breake their heads, but the women do wound their hearts.
                     I will that thou know manie other things (my Cornellus,) and they are, that the Gawles, the Vulcanes, the Flaminii, the Regii, the which are Prieſtes of the Mother Sybilla, of the God Vulcane, of the God Mars, and of the God Iupiter: the feare of the Gods ſet aſide, leauing theyr Temples deſart, laying off their honeſt garments, nor remembring their holie Ceremonies, breaking their ſtreight vowes, an infinite number of them goe to the Campe, where they loue more diſhoneſtly then others: For, it is a common thing, that thoſe which once preſume to be ſolicity and ſhamefaſte after they are once fleſhed, exceede all others in ſhame and vice.
                     It is a moſt diſhoneſt thing to carrie Prieſts to the Warres, for their office is to pacifie the Gods with teares, and not to threatten men with Weapons.
                     If perchaunce Princes would ſay, It is good to carrie Prieſts to the warres to offer Sacrifices to the Gods: To Prieſtes exempt from warre. this I aunſwere, that the Temples are buylt to pray, and the Fields ordained for to fight: So that in one place the Gods would bee feared, and in an other honoured and ſacrificed.
                     In the yeare of the Foundation of Rome. 315. the Conſul Vietro paſſed in to Aſia, and went againſt the Paleſtines the which were rebelled againſt the Romanes, and by the way hee paſſed by the temple of Apollo, in the yſle of Delphos: and as there hee made a prayer vnto the God Apollo, very long, to the ende he would reueale vnto him whether he ſhould return victorious from Aſia, or not?

                         this be true (as it is true indeed) that the God Apollo ſaide vnto the Conſull Vietro, mee thinketh it is no iuſt thing to condeſcend that the conſecrated Prieſtes ſhould goe, and endaunger to looſe themſelues, in the Warres,
                     
                        
For as thou knoweſt Cornelius, without doubt, greater is the offence which they doe commit in going for to vndoe themſelues, then they doe in the ſeruice which they doe to Princes, beeing deſirous to fight.
                     Let vs haue the Prieſts in the Temples to pray, and let vs ſee how the Captaines are wont to gouerne themſelues, and in this caſe thou ſhalt finde that the day that the Senate How the Rumanes were wonte to make trial of their Captaines. doe appoint a Senatour for Captaine, they proue him if hee can play at the Weapons in the Theater.
                     The Conſull leadeth him to the high Capitoll with him, the Eagle is hanged at his breaſt, they caſt the purple vpon his ſhoulders, they giue him money of the common treaſure, immediately hee groweth into ſuch pride, that forgetting the pouerty paſt which hee ſuffered in his Country, he thinketh one day to make him Emperour of Rome.
                     It is a common thing that when fortune exalteth men of low eſtate, to high degree, they preſume much, and know little, and much leſſe what they are worth. So that if their feeble force were coequall to their high minde, one alone ſhould ſuffice to ouercome their enemies, and alſo to winne many realmes.
                     The Captaines haue taken a cuſtome now in Rome, and they tell mee that it is an inuention of Manritane, that is, that they doe teaſe their beardes, they crule their haires they clippe their wordes, they doe change their garments, they accompany with murderers, they goe the moſt part armed, they goe very faſt to ſeeme fierce, and to conclude they little eſteeme to be beloued and take it a great glory to be feared.
                     And to the entent thou ſhouldeſt know, my Cornelius, how much they would bee feared, I will recite thee an hiſtory, which is, That I ſtanding one day in Penthapolin, a Captaine of mine, I hearing him, and he not ſeeing me, for ſo much as they would not let him doe all that hee would haue don in the houſe, he ſaid vnto an hoſtice of his.
                     Yee other villaines did neuer know Captaines of Armes, therefore know it, if thou doeſt not know it mother, that the earth can neuer tremble but when it is threatned with a Romane Captaine, and the Gods doe neuer ſuffer the Sunne to ſhine, but where we others are obeyed.
                     Since thou haſt now heard that he ſayed, heare alſo the valiantneſſe that he hath done. Within a ſhort ſpace after, the Captaine went vnto a battell in Arabia, where he was the firſt that fledde, and left the Standard alone in the field, the which had A reward giuen by the Emperour to a cowardly Captaine. almoſt made me to loſe the battell: But I to recompence his valiant deed commanded his head to be cut off: For in giuing the onſet vpon the enemies, the flying of one man doth more hurt, then the fighting of two thouſand doth profite. I haue oftentimes heard the Emperour Traian my Lord ſay, That the men which in peace ſeem moſt fierce, in wars commonly are moſt cowards.
                     
                     It chanceth that diuers things are compaſſed, for hauing onely a good eloquence, others for hauing witchcraft, others for being very diligent, others for opening their purſe, and truely this is the moſt and beſt mean that is occupyed in Rome. But the affayres of warre doe not conſiſt in talking many wordes before their friendes: but in fighting manfully in the field againſt their enemies: For in the end, men moſt full of words, are for the moſt part cowards in deedes. What wilt thou I tell thee more, my Cornelius, of the

iniuries which the Captaines doe in the Cities, whereby they paſſe, of the ſlaunders which they rayſe in the prouinces where they abide? I let thee know, that the litle worme doth not ſo much harme that gnaweth the wood, the moth to the garments, the ſparke vnto the towe, the Locuſt vnto the corne, neither the wyuell to the garners, as the Captaines to the people. For they leaue no beaſt but they lull, nor orchard but they robbe, nor wine but they drinke, nor doue houſe but they clime, nor temple but they ſpoile, nor chace but they hunt, no ſedition but they rayſe, no villany but that they commit. And they do more then they ought to do, for they eate without meaning to pay, and they will not ſerue vnleſſe they be wel payed: and the worſt of all is, that if they haue their pay, immediately they change or play it If they be not paide they robbe and mutine forthwith: ſo that with pouertie they are not content, and with riches they waxe vicious and inſolent. The matters is now come to ſuch corruption, and there is at this day men of warre in Rome ſo careleſſe, that here no captaine ſeems but an example of murderers, a ſturrer vp of ſedicious perſons, an enuyer of the good, a partaker with all euill, a thiefe of theeues, a Pirate of rouers, and finally, I do not ſay that they ſeeme to bee: but I doe affirme that they are the ſcourge of your vertuous, and a refuge of the vitious.
                     I would not ſay this, but yet not withſtanding, I ought to ſay it, becauſe it is a thing ſo farre out of order, and ſo much to bee laughed at: that theſe wicked men though they are our familiar enemies, there is no Prince that ruleth them, nor Iuſtice that correcteth them, nor feare that doth oppreſſe them, nor law that ſubdueth them, nor ſhame that refraineth them, nor parents that correct them, nor puniſhment that doth abaſe them, nor yet death that dooth end them, but now as men which are without remedy, wee let them eate of all.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XVI. The Emperour Marcus Aurelius purſueth his Letter, ſhewing the great damages that haue enſued for the wars begunne with ſtrange realmes.
                     
                     
                        O Vnfortunate Rome who was not wont Marcus Aurelius continueth his letter, ſhewing the detriment that followeth wars. to haue ſuch euill lucke, but the elder thou art, the more vnluckie I ſee thee: For by writings wee reade, and alſo with our eyes we ſee, that the more fortunate a city or perſon hath beene in the beginning, the more froward fortune is vnto him in the ending. Truly in thoſe ancient times, and in thoſe glorious worlds, I ſay, when they were peopled with true Romanes, and not as now (they which haue no children but baſtards) the Armies were ſo well taught that came from Rome as the philoſophers which were in the ſchooles of Greece. If the Greeke writings doe not lye vnto me, Philip the great King of Macedony, for this is ſo renowmed in hiſtories, and his ſonne the Great Alexander for this was ſo fortunate in the Warres, that they had their armies ſo well correct, that it rather ſeemed a Senate which gouerned, then a Campe which fought.
                     In that wee can gather out of Titus Liuius, and other Writers, from the time of Quintus Cincinnatus Dictator, vntill the noble Marcus Marcellus,
                        
were the moſt proſperous times of the Romane Empire. For before Kings did trauell, and afterwardes it was perſecuted with Tirants.
                     In theſe ſo happy times, one of the greateſt felicities that Rome had, was to haue the warre-like diſcipline well What felicity the ancient Romans tooke in warlike diſcipline. corrected. And then Rome beganne to fall when our Armies beganne to doe damage: For if thoſe of the war haue truce with vices, the others of the Common wealth cannot haue peace with vertues.
                     O curſed bee thou Aſia, and curſed bee the day that with thee wee had conqueſt: For wee haue not ſeene the good that haue followed vs of thy conqueſt, vntill this preſent, and the loſſe &amp; damage which from thee come vnto vs ſhall be lamented in Rome for euer.
                     O curſed Aſia we ſpend our treaſures in thee, and thou haſt giuen vnto vs thy vices. In chaunge of our valiant men, thou haſt ſent vs thy fine mineons, wee haue wonne thy Cities, and thou triumpheſt of our vertues. Wee battered thy fortes, and thou haſt deſtroyed our manners: we triumph of thy Realmes, and thou diddeſt cut the throtes of our friends. Wee made to thee cruell warres, &amp; thou conquereſt from vs the good peace. With force you were ours, and with good will wee are yours: Wee are vniuſt Lords of thy riches, and iuſt tenants of thy vices.
                     Finally, thou Aſia, art a wofull graue of Rome, and thou Rome art a filthie ſinke of Aſia. Since our auncient Fathers did content themſelues with Rome alone, why ſhould not we their children content our ſelues with Rome and Italy? but that wee muſt goe to conquer Aſia, where we aduentured our honour, and ſpende our treaſure? If thoſe auncient Romanes, beeing as they were, ſo princely Barons of life, and ſo valiant in fighting, and ſo hardy for to commaund, did content themſelues with this little border: why ſhoulde not wee content our ſelues, not beeing as they are, hauing a Realme rich, and vitious? I know not what toye tooke vs in the head, to goe conquer Aſia, and not to contente our ſelues with Rome? Italy was not ſo poore of riches, nor ſo deſtitute of Cities, nor ſo vnpeopled of people, nor ſo ſolitary of beaſts, nor ſo vndecked with buildings, nor ſo barren of good fruits: but that of all theſe thinges wee had more then our fathers wiſhed, and alſo more then wee their children deſerued: For mee I would ſay, that it is for want of iudgement, or aboundance of pride, for vs to ſeeke to exceed our Forefathers in Seigniorie, when wee are not coequall vnto them in vertue. I was contented with all things of my forefathers, ſaue onely that they were a little proude and ſeditious, and herein wee their children doe reſemble them well.
                     For ſo much as we are not onely proude and feditious, but alſo couetous and malitious: ſo that in vertuous things wee goe backeward, and in vnlawfull workes wee goe forward. What is become of the great victories that our forefathers had in Aſia? What is become of the infinite Treaſure they haue robbed in the Countrey? What is become of the great number of captiues, that they tooke in the warre: What is become of the riches which euery one brought home to his houſe? What is becom of the valiant Kinges which they tooke in that Conqueſt?
                     What is become of the Feaſtes and Triumphes, wherewith they entred triumphing into Rome?
                     VVhat wilt thou I ſay more vnto thee in this caſe? (my friende

                        Cornelius) but that all they which inuented the warre are dead, all thoſe which defended that Countrey are dead, all thoſe which entred triumphing into Rome are dead: and finallie, all the riches and triumphes which our Fathers brought from Aſia, they and thoſe in ſhort ſpace had an end, except the vices and pleaſures whereof wee ſee there is no end.
                     O if the valiant Princes knew, what a thing it is to inuent wars in ſtrange Realmes, what trauels they ſeeke for their perſons, what cares in their hearts, what trouble to their ſubiects, what waſte to their treaſures, what pouerty to their friends, what pleaſures to their enemies, what deſtruction of the good, what liberty of the euill, and what occaſion they giue to ſtrangers to ſpeake, what vniuerſall euill they ſow in their naturall Countries, and what euill poyſon they do leaue to their heires: I ſweare by the faith of a good man, that if as I feele it, Princes did feele it, and as I taſte it, Princes did taſte it, and alſo as I haue proued it, princes did proue it: I doe not ſay, that with effuſion of bloud I would take realmes by force: but alſo they offering them to mee with teares, I would not take them willingly. For ſpeaking the truth, It is not the point of valiant Princes for to ſuſtain an other mans, to put their owne in ieopardy.
                     I aske now, what profite tooke Rome of the conqueſt of Aſia? I admit that it durſt conquer it, that it was hardy in winning it, obſtinate in fighting, and happy in taking it: ſhould it therefore be fortunate in maintayning it? I ſay and affirme, and of that I ſay, I doe not repent mee: That it is poſſible to take Aſia, but it is but a follie to preſume to maintaine and defend it.
                     Doeſt thou not thinke it a great folly to preſume to maintaine Aſia, ſince there neuer commeth newes of a victory, but that it is occaſion of What miſchiefe came to Rome by conquering Aſia. an other battell, and that for to ſuſtaine watre, they robbe all Italy? In Aſia our money is ſpent, our children are periſhed.
                     In Aſia dyed our Fathers, for Aſia they make vs pay tributes: In Aſia the good horſes are conſumed: Into Aſia they carry all our corne: In Aſia all the theeues are nouriſhed: From Aſia commeth all the ſeditious perſons: In Aſia all the good doe periſh: From Aſia, they ſend vs all the vices. And finally, in Aſia all our treaſures are ſpent, and in Aſia all our excellent Romanes are killed.
                     And ſith this is the ſeruice that Aſia doth to Rome, why will Rome continue warre with Aſia? Other Princes before vs haue conquered Aſia, taken Aſia, and poſſeſſed Aſia: but in the end, when they ſaw that it was a Countrey, where they feared not the Gods, nor acknowledged ſubiection to their Princes, neyther that they were apt to retaine lawes, they determined to forſake them, becauſe they found by experience, that they neyther weary their bodies with warres, neither winne their harts with benefits. Thoſe Princes being hardy, nor ſo bold to ſuſtain Aſia by land, ſhould we others preſume to ſuccour it by ſea? They forſake it being neighbours, and will wee others maintaine it beeing ſtrangers? In my opinion, Aſia is a Country, where all the valiant men haue employed their valiantneſſe, where all the fooles haue proued their folly, where al the proud haue ſhewed their pride, where all the Princes entered in with might, where all thetyrants haue employed theyr Life:

but in the end, it neither profiteth the one to will it, nor to the others to knowe it, and yet much leſſe to vanquiſh it.
                     I know not the man that loueth Aſia, that willeth well to Aſia, that ſpeaketh well of Aſia, or that fauoureth the things of Aſia: ſince ſhee giueth vs occaſion to ſpeake daily, to ſigh nightly, and to weepe hourely.
                     If men attayned to the ſecrete to know the Fatall Deſtenyes, with the which the Goddes haue created Aſia: they would not ſtriue ſo much in the conqueſt therof. For, the Gods haue created it in ſuch a ſigne, that it ſhold be a common paſture where all feede, The great miſeries that were ſpecified of Aſia. a common Market, where all ſell: a common-Inne, where all reſt: a common table where all play: a common Houſe, where all dwell: a common Countrey, where all remaine: and thereof it commeth, that Aſia is deſired of manie, and gouerned of fewe. For, beeing as it is a common countrey, euery man will make it his owne proper.
                     Peraduenture thou wilt thinke my friende Cornelius, that I haue ſpoken now all the euils of Aſia: but hearken yet I will fourme thee a new queſtion againe. For, according to the dammages which haue followed (from Aſia) to our mother Rome, time ſhall rather want to write, then matter to declare. Not without teares I ſay, that which I will ſay, that there was neuer any Romane captaine that did kill tenne thouſand Aſians, with the weapons he brought into Aſia: but that hee loſt a hundreth thouſand Romanes, with the vices they brought to Rome. So that the Aſians by the hand of their enemyes dyed with honour, and left vs Romanes aliue, full of their vices with infamie.
                     I aske now what they were that inuented to dine in common places, to ſuppe in ſecret gardens, to apparel the women as men in the Theaters, to colour the fleſh of Prieſts with yeallow? to noynte the Women as men in the Bath, the Senatours going ſmelling to the Senate? Princes to be apparelled with purple, againſt the auncient decree? To eate twice in the day, as the tyraunt Dennys did, to keepe Harlots and concubines as they of Tyre doe: to ſpeak blaſphemie againſt the gods, which were neuer hearde of before in the Empire? Theſe ſaid vices of Aſia, What vices were brought to Rome, from Aſia. Aſia hath preſently ſent to Rome.
                     At the ſame time, when in thoſe parts of the Orient, the warre was kindeled: tenne valiant captains brought theſe vices to Rome, whoſe names my penne ſhall pardon to tell, becauſe their vile offences ſhould not obſcure theyr valiaunt deedes. Before that Rome conquered Aſia, we were rich, wee were pacient, wee were ſober, we were wiſe, we were honeſt, and aboue all, we liued well contented.
                     But now ſince that time we haue giuen our ſelues to forget the pollicyes of Rome, and to learne the pleaſure of Aſia: ſo that all vices may be learned in Rome, as all Sciences may be heard in Greece.
                     
                     By this aboue rehearſed, all warlike Princes may ſee, what profite they haue to conquer ſtraunge Realms, &amp;c. Let vs now leaue the vices, which in What incō

                           quering ſtrange Realmes, the warres are recouered; and talke of mony which the princes couet and loue. And in this I ſay, that there is no Prince brought into ſuch extreame pouertie, as hee which conquereth a ſtraunge countrey.
                     Oh Cornelius: thou haſt not ſeene how Princes more of a will, then of neceſsitie, doe waſte their treaſures: how they demaund that of another mans, and how their owne doeth not ſuffice them: they take thoſe of Churches: they ſeeke great Lones, they inuent great Tributes: they demaund great Subſidies: they giue ſtrangers

occaſion to ſpeake, and make themſelues hated of their ſubjects. Finally, they pray theyr ſubiects, and humble themſelues to their enemies.
                     Since I haue declared the dammages of warre: I will now declare what the originall of warre is.
                     For it is vnpoſsible that the phyſition applye vnto the ſicke agreeable medecine, if we know not of what humour the ſicknes doth proceed.
                     Princes, ſince they came of men, are nouriſhed with men, doe counſell with men, and liue with men, and to conclude, they are men. Sometimes through pride, which aboundeth in them, ſomtimes through want of counſel, they themſelues imagine, and other flattrers telleth, that thogh they haue much in reſpect of other princes, yet they can doe little. Alſo they ſay vnto them, that if their ſubſtaunce bee great, their Fame ought to bee greater.
                     Further, they tell them, that the good Prince ought little to eſteeme that hee hath inherited of his predeceſſors, in reſpect of the great deale more hee ought to leaue to his ſucceſſours, Alſo they tell them, that neuer prince left of him any great memory, but inuenting ſome cruell Warre againſt his enemie. Alſo they tell them that the houre that one is choſen Emperour of Rome, hee may boldely conquer the whole earth.
                     Theſe vaine reaſons being heard of the princes, afterwardes as their Fortune is baſe, and their mindes high, immediately they defie their enemies, they open their Treaſures, they aſſemble great armies, and in the end of all, the Gods ſuffer, that they thinking to Warre the mean &amp; occaſion to make a cō
                           monwealth poore. tkae an other mans goods, they waſte and loſe their owne.
                     Oh Princes, I knowe not who doth deceyue yee, that you which by peace may be rich, and by war wilbe poore? Oh Princes, I know not who doth deceiue you: that you which may be loued, doe ſeeke occaſions to be hated? Oh princes, I knowe not who doth beguyle yee, that yee which may enioy a ſure life, doe aduenture your ſelues to the mutabilitie of Fortune? Oh princes, I knowe not who doeth deceyue you: that you ſo little eſteeme and weigh your owne aboundance, and ſo greatly ſet by the wants of others? Oh princes, I know not who doth deceiue you, that all hauing need of you, you ſhould haue neede of others?
                     I let thee to knowe, my Cornelius, though a prince bee more quicke and carefull then all other his predeceſſors haue bin in Rome; yet it is vnpoſſible that all things touching warre, ſhould ſucceede vnto him proſperouſly. For, How vncertaine the euent of Warre is, in the greateſt neede of warres, eyther he wanteth money, or his ſubiects do not ſuccour him, or time is contrarie vnto him, or he findeth perilous paſges, hee lacketh Artillerie, or the captaines rebell, or elſe ſuccour commeth to his aduerſaryes: ſo that hee ſeeth himſelfe ſo miſerable, that thoughtes doe more oppreſſe his heart, then the enemies do harme his land. Though a prince had no warre, but for to ſuffer men of warre, yet he ought to take vpon him no warre.
                     I aske thee now my Cornelius, what trauell ſo great to his perſon, or what greater damage to his Realme can his Enemies do, then that which his own men of warre doe, &amp;c?
                     The Enemies, to doe the worſt they can, will but robbe our Frontiers: but our men of War do robbe the whole countrey. The Enemies we dare, and may reſiſt, but to ours we cannot, nor dare not ſpeake. The Enemyes, the worſt they can do, is once in a moneth to robbe and runne their wayes: but ours daily do robbe, and remaine ſtill. The Enemyes feare their enemies only: but ours doe feare their enemyes, and haue no pitie on their friends.
                     
                        
The enemies, the further they goe on, the more they diminiſh: but ours, the further they goe, the more they encreaſe.
                     I know no greater warre that Princes can haue then to haue men of warre in their realmes: For as experience doth ſhew vs, before the Gods they are culpable, to Princes importunate, and to the people troubleſome: ſo that they liue to the damage of all, and to the profit of none. By the God Mars I ſwear vnto thee, (my friend Cornelius) as hee may direct my hands in the war, that I haue more complaints in the Senate, of the thefts which my Captaines did in Illyria, then of all the enemies of the Romane people.
                     Both for that I ſay, and for that I kept ſecret, I am more afraid to create an Enſigne of two hundred men of warre, then to giue a cruell battell to thirty thouſand men: For that battell, fortune (good or euill) forthwith diſpacheth, but with theſe I can bee ſure no time of all my life. Thou wilt ſay vnto me (Cornelius) that ſince I am Emperour of Rome, I ſhould remedy this ſince I know it: For that Prince which diſſembleth with the fault of another, by reaſon hee will condemne him, as if it were his owne.
                     To this I anſwere, that I am not mighty enough to remedy it, except by my remedy there ſhould ſpring a greater inconuenience. And ſince thou haſt not beene a Prince, thou couldeſt not fall into that I haue, nor yet vnderſtand that which I ſay: For Princes by their wiſdom know many things, the which to remedy they haue no power: So it hath beene, ſo it is, ſo it ſhall be, ſo I found it, ſo I keepe it, ſo will I leaue it them, ſo I haue reade it in bookes, ſo haue I ſeen it with my eyes, ſo haue I heard it of my predeceſſors: And finally, I ſay, our Fathers haue inuented it, and ſo will wee their children ſuſtaine it, and for this euill wee will leaue it to our heyres. No greater hinderance to a Common wealth then to keepe men of warre.
                     
                     I will tell thee one thing, and imagine that I erre not therein, which is, conſidering the great dammage and little profite, which men of warre do bring to our Common wealth: I thinke to doe it, and to ſuſtaine it, eyther it is the folly of men, or a ſcourge giuen of the Gods. For there can be nothing more iuſt, then for the Gods to permit, that wee feele that in our owne houſes, which wee cauſe others in ſtrange houſes to lament.
                     All thoſe thinges I haue written vnto thee, not for that it skileth greatly that I know them: but that my heart is at eaſe for to vtter them: For as Alcibiades ſayde, the cheſts and the hearts, ought alwayes to be open to their friends.
                     
                        Panutius my Secretary goeth in my behalfe to viſite that Land, and I gaue him this Letter to giue thee: with two Horſes? wherewith I doe thinke thou wilt be contented, for they are Genets.
                     The Weapons and riches which I tooke of the Parthians, I haue now diuided, notwithſtanding I do ſend thee two Chariots laden with them.
                     My wife Fauſtine greeteth thee, and ſhee ſendeth a rich glaſſe for thy Daughter, and a iewell with ſtones for thy ſiſter. No more but I doe beſeech the gods to giue thee a good life, and me a good death.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XVII. An Admonition of the Author to Princes and great Lordes, to the entent that the more they grow in yeares, the more they are bound to refrayne from vices.
                     
                     
                        
                           AVlus Gelius in his booke De noctibus Atticis ſayeth, that there was an auncient cuſtome among the Romanes, to A cuſtome among the auncient Romanes. honour and haue in great reuerence aged men. And this was ſo inuiolate a Law amongſt them that there was none ſo noble of bloud and linage, neyther ſo puiſſant in riches, neyther ſo fortunate in battels that ſhould go before the aged men, which were loden with white hayres: ſo that they honoured them as they did the Gods.
                     Amongſt other, the aged men had theſe preheminences, that is to ſay, that in feaſts they ſate higheſt, in the Triumphes they went before, in the Temples they did ſit downe, they ſpake to the Senate before all others, they had their garments furred, they might eate alone in ſecret, and by their onely word they were credited as witneſſes.
                     Finally, I ſay, that in all thinges they ſerued them, and in nothing they annoied them. After the people of Rome beganne warre with Aſia, they forſooke all their good Romane cuſtomes immediately.
                     And the occaſion hereof was, that ſince they had no men to ſuſtaine the Common-wealth, by reaſon of the great multitude of people which died in the warre: they ordained that all the young men ſhould marry, the young maides, the widdows, the free and the bond, and that the honour which had beene done vntill that time vnto the olde men, from henceforth ſhould bee done vnto the maried men, though they were yong: So that the moſt honoured in Rome was hee, not of moſt yeares, but he that had moſt children. This Law was made a little before the firſt battell of Carthage.
                     
                     And the cuſtome that the married men were more honoured then the old, endured vntil the time of the Emperour Auguſtus, which was ſuch a friend of Antiquities, that hee renued all the walles of Rome with new ſtone, and renued all the auncient cuſtomes of the Common-wealth.
                     
                        Lycurgus in the lawes which he Lycurgus his Lawes to the Lacedemonians. gaue to the Lacedemonians, ordayned, that the young men paſſing by the olde, ſhould doe them great reuerence: and when the old men did ſpeake, then the younger ſhould be ſilent.
                     And hee ordained alſo, that if any olde man by caſualtie did loſe his goods, and came into extreame pouertie, then hee ſhould be ſuſtained of the Common wealth: and that in ſuch ſuſtentation they ſhould haue reſpect, not onely to ſuccour him, for to ſuſtain him, but further to giue him to liue competently. Plutarch in his Apothegmes declareth, that Cato the Cenſor viſiting the corners of Rome, found an olde man ſitting at his dore weeping, and ſhedding many teares from his eyes. And Cato the Cenſour demanding him why he was ſo euill handled, and wherefore hee wept ſo bitterly? the good olde man anſwered him.
                     O Cato, the Gods beeing the only Comforters, comfort thee in all thy tribulations, ſince thou art ready to comfort mee at this wofull houre. As well as thou knoweſt that

the conſolations of the Heart are more neceſſarie, then the phyſicke of the bodie: the which being applyed ſometimes doeth heale, and an other time they do harme. Behold my ſcabby hands, my ſwollen legs, my mouth without Teeth, my peeled Face, my white beard, and my balde head: for thou (beeing as thou art) diſcreete, ſhouldeſt be excuſed to aske mee why I weepe?
                     For men of my Age, though they weepe not for the little they feele: yet they ought to weep for the ouermuch they liue. The man which is loaden with teares, tormented with diſeaſes, Death maketh an end fal worldly miſerie. purſued with Enemies, forgotten of his friends, viſited with miſhaps, and with euill will and pouertie: I know not why he demandeth long life? For there can be no ſharper reuengement of vices, which wee commit: then to giue vs long life.
                     Though now I am aged, I was young, and if any young man ſhould doe me any iniurie, truely I would not deſire the Gods to take away his life, but that they would rather prolong his life. For, it is great pittie to heare the man (which hath liued long) recount the troubles, which he hath endured.
                     Know thou Cato, if thou doeſt not know it, that I haue liued 77. yeares, and in this time, I haue buryed my Father, my Grand-father, two Aunts, and fiue vncles. After that I had buryed 9. Syſters, and 11. Bretheren. I haue buryed afterwards, two lawfull wiues, and fiue bond-women, which I haue had as my lemmans.
                     I haue buryed alſo 14. children, and 7. marryed daughters: and therewith not contented, I haue buryed 37. Nephewes, and 15. Nieces, and that which grieueth me moſt of all is, that I haue buryed two good friendes of mine: One of the which remayned in Capua, and the other which remained was reſident heere at Rome.
                     
                     The death of whome hath grieued me more, then all thoſe of my alyance and parētage. For, in the world there is no like loſſe to that, where a man looſeth him whom entierly he loueth, and of whome alſo hee is deerely beloued.
                     The fatall Deſtenyes ought to content themſelues, to haue annoyed my houſe with ſo many misfortunes. But all this, and aboue all this, they haue left me a wicked nephewe, which ſhall be mine heyre, and they haue left vnto me, that all my life I ſhall lament.
                     Oh Cato, for that thou oweſt to the Common-wealth; I doe deſire thee: and by the immortal Gods I doe conjure thee, that ſince thou art a vertuous Romane, and Cenſor of the people, that thou prouide for one of theſe two things: that is to ſay, that this my nephew doe ſerue me, or elſe ordeyne that I dye forthwith. For, it is a great crueltie that thoſe doe purſue mee, which are aliue, ſince it is now fourtie yeares, that I ceaſed not to bewayle the dead.
                     
                        Cato beeing well informed of that the olde man had tolde him, and ſince he found all that true which he ſpake, he called vnto his preſence the young Nephewe, and ſayde vnto him theſe wordes:
                     
                        If thou wert ſuch a Childe as thou oughteſt to bee, thou ſhouldeſt excuſe mee of paine, and thy ſelfe of trauell. But ſince it is not ſo, I pray thee take paciently that which I ſhall commaund thee: and bee thou wel aſſured, that I will not commaund thee any thing but that which ſhal be correſpondent to Iuſtice. 
                        A wiſe Sentence of Cato.
                     
                     
                        For, the vicious younglings (as thou art) ought to be more aſhamed of the vnbrideled youthfulneſſe they haue committed: then for all the puniſhments which is giuen vnto them:
                     
                     
                        Firſt, I commaund thou bee whipt, becauſe thou art become ſo diſobedient, and troubleſome to thy Graundfather.
                     
                     
                        
                        Secondly, I commaunde that thou bee baniſhed the limites of Rome: becauſe thou art a vicious young man.
                     
                     
                        Thirdly, I commaund that of all the goods which thou haſt enherited, thou ſhalt bee diſinherited, becauſe thou doeſt not obey thy Graundfather.
                     
                     And the cauſe why I giue ſuch ſeuere ſentence is, to the ende that from henceforth the young ſhall not diſobey the Aged, and alſo that thoſe which haue inherited great treaſours, ſhall not thinke that men ſhould permit them to bee more vicious then others.
                     
                        Phalaris the Tyraunt writing to a Friende of his, which was very aged, ſaide theſe words: the which ſeemed rather ſpoken of a Phyloſopher, then A ſaying of Phalaris the Tyrant. of a tyrant. I haue maruelled at thee, and am offended with thee (my friend 
                           〈◊〉
                        ) to know as I doe, that in yeares thou art very aged, and in workes very young: and alſo it grieueth mee that thou haſt loſt the credit of knowledge in the Schooles.
                     It grieueth me more, that through thee the priuiledges ſhould bee loſt, which the olde men haue accuſtomed to haue in Greece: that is to ſay, that all the thieues, all the periured, and all the murtherers were more ſure, when by white hayres they ſeemed to bee olde: when they retired to the Aultars of the Temples.
                     Oh what goodneſſe, Oh what wiſedome, what valiantneſſe, and what innocencie ought the aged men to haue in the auncient time: ſince in Rome, they honoured them as Gods, and in Greece they priuiledged thoſe whyte haires as the temples?
                     
                        Plinie in an Epiſtle he wrote to Fabarus ſaith, that Pyrrus king of the Epyrotes, demaunded of a phyloſopher, which was the beſt citie of the world? who aunſwered him thus:
                     
                        The beſt Citie of the world is Molerda, a place of three hundreth Fyres in Achaia: becauſe all the walles are of blacke ſtones, and all thoſe which gouerne haue hoary heads.
                     
                     And further he ſaide: Woe bee vnto thee Rome: Woe be vnto thee Carthage: 
                        A wiſe aunſwere of a philoſopher 
                        Woe be vnto thee Numantia: Wo be vnto thee Egipt: and woe bee vnto thee Athens; Fyue Cittyes which count themſelues for the beſt of the Worlde: whereof I am of a contrary opinion.
                     
                     
                        For, they auaunte themſelues to haue whyte Walles: and are not aſhamed to haue young Senatours.
                     
                     This phyloſopher ſaide very well, and I thinke no man will ſay leſſe then I haue ſaide.
                     Of this word Senex, is deriued the name of a Senatour: For ſo were the gouernours of Rome named: becauſe the firſt King (that was Romulus,) choſe an hundred aged men to gouerne the Common-wealth: and commaunded that all the Romane youth ſhould employ themſelues to the warres.
                     Since wee haue ſpoken of the honour which in the old time was giuen to the auncient men, it is reaſon wee know now, from what yeares they accounted men aged: to the end they ſhould reuerently bee honoured as aged men.
                     For the makers of lawes, when they hadde eſtabliſhed the honours which ought to be done to the Aged, did as well ordain, from what day and yeare they ſhould beginne.
                     Diuers auncient phyloſophers did put ſix ages, from the time of the birth of man, vntill the houre of his death. That is to ſay: Childe-hood, which laſteth vntill ſeuen yeares: Infancie, which laſteth vntill ſeuenteene yeares: Youth, which continueth till thirtie yeares: Mans eſtate, which remaineth The ſix Ages of mans life ſaid opē &amp; explaned. till fiftie and fiue yeares. Age, which endureth till three-ſcore, and eighteene yeares: Then laſt of all, Crooked-age, which remaineth till death.
                     
                        
And ſo after man had paſſed fiue and fifty yeares, they called him aged.
                     
                        Aulus Gelius in his tenth booke in the 27, Chapter ſayth, that Fuluius Hoſtilius (who was King of the Romanes) determined to count all the olde and yong which were amongſt the people: and alſo to know which ſhould be called Infants, which yong and which old. And there was no little difference among the Romane Philoſophers, and in the end it was decreed by the King, and the Senate, that men till ſeuenteene years ſhould bee called Infants, and till ſixe &amp; forty ſhould be called young, and from ſixe and forty vpwards they ſhould be called olde.
                     If wee will obſerue the Law of the Romanes, wee know from what time we are bound to call and honor the aged men. But adding hereunto it is reaſon that the olde men know, to what proweſſes and vertues they are bound, to the end that with reaſon, and not with fainting they bee ſerued: for ſpeaking the truth, if wee compare duty to duty, the olde men are more bound to vertue then the young to ſeruice. Wee cannot deny but that all ſtates of Nations (great &amp; ſmall, young and old) are bound to bee vertuous: but in this caſe, the one is more to bee blamed then the other.
                     For oftentimes if the young men doe offend, it is for that hee wanteth experience: but if the old man offend it is for the aboundance of malice:
                     
                        Seneca in an Epiſtle ſayde theſe words: I let thee know my friend Lucillus that l am very much offended, A graue ſentence of Sences. and I doe complaine not of any friend or foe, but of my ſelfe and none other. And the reaſon why I thinke this, is that I ſee my ſelfe old in vices: ſo little is that wherein I haue ſerued the Gods, and much leſſe is that I haue profited him.
                     And Seneca ſayeth further, Hee which prayſeth himſelfe moſt to bee aged, and that would bee honoured for being aged, ought to bee temperate in eating, honeſt in appartell, ſober in drinking, ſoft in words, wiſe in counſell, and to conclude, he ought to be very patient in aduerſity, and far from vices which attempt him.
                     Worthy of prayſe is the greate Seneca for thoſe wordes: but more worthy ſhall the olde men, if they wil conforme their workes according to theſe words: For if wee ſee them for to abandon vices, and giue themſelus to vertues: we will both ſerue them, and honour them.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XVIII. That Princes when they are aged, ſhould be temperate in eating, ſober in drinking, modeſt in apparrell, and aboue all, true in communication.
                     
                     
                        IT is conſonant to the counſell of Seneca, 
                        Good counſel of Seneca, worthy to be followed both of olde and young. that the aged ſhould bee temperate in eating which they ought to doe, not onely for the reputation of their perſons, but alſo for the preſeruation of theyr liues.
                     For the olde men which are drunke and amorous, are perſecuted with their owne diſeaſes, and are defamed by the tongues of other. That which the ancient men ſhould eate (I meane thoſe which are noble and vertuous, ought to bee very cleane, and well dreſſed, and aboue all, that they doe take it in ſeaſon &amp; time: for otherwiſe, too

much eating of diuers things, cauſeth the young to bee ſicke, and enforceth the olde to die.
                     Young men though they eate diſhoneſtly, very haſtily, and eate ſpeaking, we can doe no leſſe but diſſemble with them: but the olde men which eate much, and haſtily, of neceſſitie we ought to reproue them. For men of How circū
                           ſpect &amp; wary men ought to be in eating &amp; 
                              〈◊〉
                           , Honour ought to eate at table with a great grauitie: as if they were in any counſell, to determine cauſes. It is not mine intention to perſwade the feeble olde men not to eate, but onely to admoniſh them to eate no more then is neceſſarie.
                     We doe not prohibite them to eate delicate things, but to beware of ſuperfluous things. We doe not counſell them to leaue eating, hauing need: but to withdraw themſelues from curioſitie.
                     For though it bee lawfull for aged men to eate ſufficient, it is not honeſt for them to eate, to ouercome theyr ſtomacks.
                     It is a ſhame to write it, but more ſhame ought they to haue which doe it; which is: that the goods which they haue wonne and inherited by their predeceſſours, they haue eaten and drunken: ſo that they haue neyther bought Houſe not vyne, nor yet marryed any Daughter: but they are naked, and their poore children goe to the Tauernes and Innes: and the miſerable Fathers to the Hoſpitalles, and Churches.
                     When any man commeth to pouertie, for that his houſe is burned, or his ſhippe drowned: or that they haue taken all from him by Lawe: or that hee hath ſpent it in pleading againſt his enemies, or any other in conueniēce is come vnto him: me thinketh we are all bound to ſuccor him, and the hart hath cōpaſſion to behold him: but he that ſpendeth it in Apparel not requiſite, to ſeeke delitious Wines, and to eate delicate meates: To ſuch a one (I would ſay,) that the pouertie which he ſuffereth, is not ſufficient for his deſerts. For of all troubles there is none ſo great, as to ſee a man ſuffer the euil, whereof hee himſelfe hath bin the occaſion.
                     Alſo, according to the counſell of Seneca, the Auncients ought to be wel aduertiſed, in that they ſhould not only be temperate in eating, but likewiſe they ſhould be ſober in drinking: and this both for the preſeruation of theyr health: as alſo for the reputation of their honeſtie.
                     For, if the olde phyſitians doe not Diſcommodityes that come by exceſſe of eating and drinking. deceyue vs, humaine bodyes doe drye and corrupt, becauſe they drinke ſuperfluouſly, and eate more then Nature requireth.
                     If I ſhould ſay vnto the olde men, that they ſhould drinke no wine: they might tell mee, that it is not the counſell of a Chriſtian. But preſuppoſe they ought to drinke, and that for no opinion they ſhould leaue it: yet I admoniſh, exhorte, and deſire them, that they drinke little, and that they drinke very temperate.
                     For the diſordinate and immeaſurate drinking, cauſeth the young men to be drunke, and the olde men, both drunke and fooliſh. Oh howe much authoritie loſt they, and what grauitie doe honorable and ancient men loſe, which in drinking are not ſober?
                     Which ſeemeth to be true, foraſmuch as the man being loden with wine, although he were the wiſeſt in the world, he ſhould bee a very foole, that would take counſel of ſuch one in his affaires Plutarche in a booke which he made, of the Fortunes of the Romaines, ſaied: that in the Senate of Rome, there was an Auncient man, who made great exclametions, that a certaine young man hadde in ſuch heinous ſort diſhonoured him, that for the iniuryes hee had ſpoken, he deſerued death.
                     
                        
And when the yong man was called for to anſwere to that he had ſaid vnto him; he anſwered: Fathers conſcript, though I ſeeme young vnto you, yet I am not ſo young, but that I knew 
                        The anſwer of a young man to the Senate or Rome. 
                        the Father of this olde man, who was a vertuous and noble Romane, and ſomewhat a kinne to mee. And I ſeeing that his Father had gotten much goods fighting in the warres, and alſo ſeeing this oldeman ſpending them in eating and drinking: I ſayde vnto him one day.
                     
                     
                        I am very ſorry my Lord and vncle, for that I heare of thy honour in the market place: and am the more ſorry, for that I ſee done in thy houſe, wherein we ſaw fifty men armed before in our houre, and now wee ſee a hundred knaues made drunke.
                     
                     
                        And worſe then that, as thy Father ſhewed to all thoſe that entered into his houſe the Enſignes hee had wonne in the Warres: ſo now to thoſe that enter into thy houſe, thou ſheweſt them diuers ſorts of Wines.
                     
                     
                        My vncle complayned of mee, but in this caſe I make the Plaintife iudge againſt mee the defendant. And I would by the immortall Gods hee deſerued no more paine for his workes, then I deſerue by my words.
                     
                     For if hee had been wiſe, he would haue accepted the correction which ſecretely I gaue him: and had not come openly, to declare his faults in the Senate.
                     The complaint of the old man being heard by the Senate, and the excuſe in like manner of the yong-man: they gaue iudgement, that they ſhould take all the goods from the olde man, and prouide him of a Tutour which ſhould gouerne him and his houſe.
                     And they commaunded the Tutour, That from hence forward hee ſhould not giue him one cuppe of Wine, ſince hee was noted of drunkenneſſe. Of truth the ſentence which the Senate gaue was very iuſt: The iudgement of the Senate againſt drunkennes For the olde man which giueth himſelfe to wine, hath as much neede to haue a Gouernour, as an Infant, or a foole.
                     
                        Laertius made a booke of the Feaſts of Philoſophers, and declareth ſundry auncient banquets, among the which hee putteth one, where were aſſembled many great Philoſophers. And admit that the meates were meane, and ſimple: yet the bidden gueſts were ſage.
                     And the cauſe why they did aſſemble, was not to eate, but to diſpute of ſome graue doctrines, whereof the Philoſophers did ſomewhat doubt: For in thoſe dayes, the greater the Stoyckes and the Peripatetikes were in number: ſo much the more were the Philoſophers diuided amongſt themſelues.
                     When they were ſo aſſembled, truly they did not eate, nor drinke out of meaſure: but ſome pleaſant matter was moued betweene the maſters and the ſchollers, betweene the young and the olde, that is to ſay, which of them could declare any ſecret of Philoſophy, or any profounde ſentence. O happy were ſuch feaſts, and no leſſe happy were they that thether were bidden,
                     But I am ſorry that thoſe which now bidde, and thoſe that are bidden, for a truth are not as thoſe Ancients were: For there are no feaſtes now a dayes of Philoſophers, but of gluttons, not to diſpute, but for to murmure, not to open doubtfull things, but to talke of the vices of others, not to confirme auncient amities, but to beginne new diſſentions, not to learne any doctrines, but to approue ſome nouelty. And that which worſt of all is, the old ſtriue at the table with the yong, not on him which hath ſpoken the moſt graueſt

ſentence: but of him which hath drunke moſt wine, and hath rinſed moſt cups.
                     
                        Paulus Diaconus in the hiſtory of the Lumbards declareth, that foure olde Lumbards made a banquet, in the which, the one dranke to the others yeares, and it was in this manner: They made defyance to drinke two to two, and after each man had declared how many yeares olde hee was: the one dranke as many times as the other was yeeres olde, and likewiſe his companion pledged him. And one of theſe foure companions had at the leaſt 58. yeares: the ſecond 63, the third 87. the fourth 92. ſo that a man knoweth not what they did eate in this banquet, eyther little or much: but wee know that hee that dranke leaſt, dranke 58. cups of wine. An euill quſtome vſed among the Goths.
                     
                     Of this ſo euill cuſtome came the Gothes to make this Law, which of many is read, and of a few vnderſtood, where it ſayeth, We ordaine and commaund on paine of death, that no olde man drinke to the others yeares being at the table. That was made becauſe they were ſo much giuen to Wine, that they dranke more oft then they did eate morſels. The Princes and great lords which now are old, ought to be very ſober in drinking, ſince they ought greatly to be regarded &amp; honoured of the yong.
                     For ſpeaking the truth, and with liberty, when the olde man ſhall be ouercome with wine, hee hath more neceſſity that the young man leade him by the arme to his houſe, then that hee ſhould take off his cappe vnto him with reuerence.
                     Alſo Princes and great Lordes ought to bee very circumſpect, that when they become aged, they bee not noted for young in the apparrel which they weare: For although hat for wearing a fine and riche garment, the Prince doth not enrich or empoueriſh his Commonwealth: yet wee cannot deny, but that it doth much for the reputation of his perſon: For the vanity and curioſity of garments, dooth ſhew great lightnes of mind. According to the variety of ages, ſo ought the diuerſity of apparrell to bee, which ſeemeth to be very cleare, in that the young maides are attired in one ſort, the married women of an other ſort: the widdowes of an other.
                     And likewiſe I would ſay, that the apparrell of children ought to be of one ſort, thoſe of young men of an other, and thoſe of olde men of an other, which ought to be more honeſter then all.
                     For men of hoary heades ought not to be adorned with precious garments: but with vertuous workes: Euery man ought for to weare apparrell according to his calling. To goe cleanely, to bee well apparrelled, and to bee well accompanied, wee doe not forbidde the olde, eſpecially thoſe which are noble and valiant men: but to goe fine, to go with great traines, and to go very curious, wee doe not allow. Let the old men pardon mee, for it is not the office but of yong fooles: for the one ſheweth honeſty, and the other lightneſſe. It is a confuſion to tell it, but it is greater ſhame to do it, that is to ſay, that many olde men of our time take no ſmal felicity to put caules on their heads, euery man to weare iewels on their necks, to lay their caps with agglets of gold, to ſeeke out diuers inuē
                        tions of mettall, to loade their fingers with rich rings, to go perfumed with odoriferous ſauors, to weare new faſhioned apparrell: and finally, I ſay, that thogh their face be ful of wrinckles, they cannot ſuffer one wrinckle to be in their gowne. All the ancient hiſtories accuſe Quint. Hortenſius the Romane, for that euery time when he made himſelfe ready, hee had a glaſſe

before him: and as much ſpace and time had hee to ſtreighten the pleytes of his gowne, as a Woman hadde, to trimme the haires of her head.
                     This Quintus Hortenſius being Conſull, going by chance one day through Rome, in a narrow ſtreete met with the other Conſull: where thorough the ſtreightnes of the paſſage, the pleights of his Gowne were vndone: vppon which occaſion hee complained vnto the Senate of the other Conſull, that he had deſerued to looſe his life.
                     The Author of all this is Macrobius, in the third book of the Saturnales.
                     
                     I can not tell if I be deceyued, but we may ſay, that all the curioſitie that olde men haue to goe fine, well apparrelled, and cleane, is for no other thing but to ſhake off Age, and to pretende right to youth. What a griefe is it to Pride in the aged, ought to be neglected. ſee diuers auncient men, the which as ripe Figges do fall: and on the other ſide it is a wonder to ſee how in theyr age they make themſelues young. In this caſe (I ſay) would to God wee might ſee them hate vices, and not to complaine of their yeares which they haue.
                     I pray and exhort all Princes and great Lordes, whome our ſoueraigne Lord hath permitted to come to age, that they doe not deſpiſe to bee aged: For ſpeaking the truth, the man which hath enuie to ſeeme olde, doth delight to liue in the lightnes of youth. Alſo men of honor ought to be very circumſpect: for ſo much as after they are become aged, they bee not ſuſpected A lye in a young man hatefull, but in an olde man abhominable. of their friends, but that both vnto their friends and foes, they be counted faithfull. For a Lye in a young mans mouth, is eſteemed but a lye: but in the mouth of an auncient or aged old man, it is counted as a haynous blaſphemie.
                     Noble Princes and great Lordes after they are become aged, of one ſort they ought to vſe themſelues to giue, and of the other to ſpeake. For, good Princes ought to ſell theyr wordes by weight, and giue rewardes without meaſure.
                     The Auncient do oftentimes complaine, ſaying: That the young will not bee conuerſant with them; and truely if there be any faulte therein, it is of themſelues. And the reaſon is, that if ſometimes they doe aſſemble together, to paſſe away the time: if the old man ſet a talking, he neuer maketh an ende. So that a diſcrete man had rather goe a dozen miles on foot, then to heare an olde man talke three houres,
                     If with ſuch efficacie we perſwade olde men, that they be honeſt in theyr apparrell: for a truth we will not giue them licence to bee diſſolute in theyr words, ſince there is a great difference to note ſome man in his Apparrell, or to accuſe him to bee malitious, or a babler. For to weare rich and coſtly Apparell, iniurieth fewe, but iniurious words hurt manie.
                     
                        Macrobius in his firſt booke of the dreames of Scipio, declareth of a Phyloſopher named Crito: who liued an hundred and fiue yeares: and till fiftie yeares hee was farre out of courſe.
                     But after hee came to be aged, he was ſo well meaſured in his eating and drinking, and ſo warie in his ſpeeche, that they neuer ſaw him do any thing worthy reprehenſion: nor heard him ſpeake word, but was worthie of noting.
                     On this condition wee would giue licence to manie, that till fiftie yeares A worthy leſſon, &amp;c. they ſhould bee young: So that from thenceforth they would be clothed as old men, ſpeake as old men, and they ſhould eſteeme themſelues to be olde But I am ſorrie, that all the Spring time doth paſſe in flower, and afterwardes they fall into the graue as rotten, before they finde any time to pull them out.
                     
                        
The olde doe complaine that the young doe not take their aduiſe, and their excuſe herein is, that in their words they are too long: For if a man doe demaund an olde man his opinion in a caſe, immediately hee will beginne to ſay, that in the life of ſuch, and ſuch Kings, and Lords of good memory, this was done, &amp; this was prouided: ſo that when a young man asketh them counſel how hee ſhall be haue himſelfe with the liuing: the olde man beginneth to declare vnto him the life of thoſe which be dead.
                     The reaſon why the olde men deſire to ſpeake ſo long is that ſince for their age they cannot ſee, nor go, nor eate, nor ſleepe, they would that all the time their members were occupied to doe their duties, all that time their tongue ſhould bee occupied to declare of their times paſt. All this being ſpoken, what more is to ſay, I know not, but that wee ſhould content our ſelues, that the olde men ſhould haue their fleſh as much puniſhed, as they haue their tong with Olde men ought to be a lanterne to youth. talke martyred. Though it bee very vile for a young man to ſpeake, and ſlaunder to a young man not to ſay the truth, yet this vice is much more to be abhorred in old Princes, and other noble and worſhipfull men, which ought not onely to thinke it their duty to ſpeake truth, but alſo to puniſh the enemies thereof, For otherwiſe the noble and valiant Knights ſhould not loſe a litle of their authority, if a man ſaw on their heads but white haires, and in their mouthes found nothing but lyes.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XIX. Of a letter of the Emperour Marcus Aurelius, to Claudius and Claudinus, reproouing them being olde men, and that they liued youthfully.
                     
                     
                        
                           MARKE Emperor, borne in Mount Celio, 
                        A Letter of the Emperour, reprouing light behauiour in old men. deſireth to you my neighbours, Claude and Claudine health of your perſons, and amendment of your liues, I beeing as I am, at the Conqueſt of Aſia, and you remayning alwayes in the pleaſures of Rome, wee vnderſtand your newes very late, and I thinke our letters arriue there as late. Notwithſtanding, to thoſe which goe thither, I giue anſweres for you others, and of all thoſe which come hither, I demaund of your health. And doe not demand of others how well and how much I loue you, but of your owne proper hearts: and if your heart ſay, that I am a fained friend, then I take my ſelfe condemned. If perchance your harts doe tell you that I loue you, beeing true indeed that I hate you, or if I tel you that I hate you, being true that I loue you: of truth I would plucke ſuch a heart out of my body, and giue it to bee eaten of the beaſts. For there is no greater deceit, then that which the man doth to himſelfe.
                     If a ſtranger beguile mee, I ought to diſſemble it, if an enemie deceiue mee, I ought to reuenge it, if my friend miſuſe mee, I ought to complaine of him: but if I deceyue my ſelfe, with whom ſhall I comfort my ſelfe? For there is no patience that can ſuffer the heart to deceiue himſelfe in any thing, which hee hath not

deepaly conſidered. Peraduenture, yee will ſay, I doe not eſteeme you, and that I haue not written any letter vnto you of long time, To this I anſwere.
                     That you doe not attribute the fault to my negligence, but to the great diſtance of countries that there is from hence to Rome: and alſo to the great affaires of Aſia: For amongſt other diſcommodities, the warre hath this alſo, that it depriueth A diſcommodity that war bringeth. vs of the ſweet conuerſation of our Country.
                     I haue alwayes preſumed to bee yours, and at this preſent am at no mans pleaſure, more then at yours: And ſince you haue alwayes knowne of mee, what you deſired to know, I haue eſpyed in you others that, which of force I muſt ſpeake. For in the end I haue not ſeene any poſſeſſe ſo much, to bee worth ſo much, to know ſo much, nor in all things to bee ſo mighty, but that one day hee ſhould neede his poore friend.
                     The diuine Plato ſayde, and alſo well, That the man which loueth with his heart, neyther in abſence forgetteth, neyther in preſence becommeth negligent, neyther in proſperity hee is proud, nor yet in aduerſitie abiect, neyther he ſerueth for profit, nor yet hee loueth for gaine: and finally, he defendeth the caſe of his friend as his owne.
                     Diuers haue beene of the opinions which the Auncients held to affirme, For foure cauſes Friends are to be eſteemed. for what end friendes were taken, and in the end they were fully reſolued, that for foure cauſes we ought to chuſe friends.
                     The firſt, we ought to haue friends to treate, and to bee conuerſant with all: for according to the troubles of this life, there is no time ſo pleaſantly conſumed, as in the conuerſation of an aſſured friend.
                     The ſecond is, wee ought to haue friends, to haue friends, to whom we may diſcloſe the ſecrets of our hearts: for it is much comfort to the wofull hart, to declare to his friend his doubts, if he perceiue that hee doth feele them in deede.
                     The third, we ought to ſearch &amp; chuſe friends, to the end they helpe vs in our aduerſities: For little profiteth it my heart, that with teares the friends doe heare all that I bewayle, vnleſſe afterwards in deede hee will take paines to reforme the ſame.
                     The fourth, wee ought to ſeeke and preſerue friends to the end they be protectors of our goods, and likewiſe Iudges of our euils: for the good friend is no leſſe bound to withdraw vs from the vices whereby wee are ſlaundered, then to deliuer vs from our enemies, by whom wee may bee ſlaine.
                     The end why I tolde you all this was, if that in this letter you chance to light vpon any ſharpe word, that you take it patiently, conſidering that the loue that I beare you, doth moue mee to ſpeake, and the faith which I owe vnto you, dooth not ſuffer mee that I ſhould keepe it cloſe. For many things ought to be borne among friends, though they tell them in earneſt, which ought not to be ſuffered of others, though they ſpeake it in ieſt. I come therefore to ſhew the matter, and I beſeech the immortall Gods, that there be no more then that you haue tolde mee, and that it bee leſſe then I ſuſpect.
                     
                        Gaius Furius your Kinſman, and my eſpeciall friend, as hee went to the Realme of Paleſtine, and Hieruſalem, came to ſee mee in Antioch, and hath tolde me newes of Italy &amp; Rome; and among others, one aboue all the reſidue I haue committed to memory, at the which I could not refrain laughing, and leſſe to bee troubled after I had thought of it. O how many things doe wee talke in ieſt, the

which after wee haue well conſidered, giue occaſion to be ſorrie.
                     The Emperor Adrian my good lord had a Ieaſter, whoſe name was Belphus yong, comely and ſtout, albeit he was very malicious, as ſuch are acuſtomed to be: and whiles the Embaſſadors of Germanie ſupped with the Emperour in great ioye: the ſame Belphus began to jeaſt of euery one that was preſent, according to his accuſtomed manner with a certaine malicious grace. And Adrian perceyuing that ſome chaunged colour, others murmured, and others were angrie: hee ſaide vnto this ieaſter: Friend Belphus, if thou loue me and my ſeruice, vſe not theſe ſpitefull 
                        The ſpeech of the Emperour Adrian to his ieaſter. 
                        ieaſts at our ſupper, which being conſidered on, may turne vs to euill reſt in our beddes.
                     
                     
                        Gaius Furius hath told me ſo manie ſlaunders chaunced in Italie, ſuch nouelties done in Rome, ſuch alteration of our Senate, ſuch contentions and ſtrife betweene our Neighbours, ſuch lightnes of you two, that I was aſtonnied to heare it, and aſhamed to write it. And it is nothing to tell after what ſort he tolde them vnto me, vnles you had ſeen how earneſtly he ſpake them: imagining that as he tolde them without taking any paines, ſo did I receiue them (as hee thought) without anie griefe: though in deede euery worde that hee ſpake, ſeemed a ſharpe piercing arrowe vnto my heart For ofte times ſome telleth vs things, as of ſmall importance, the which do pricke our hearts to the quicke.
                     By the opinion of all, I vnderſtand that you are very olde, and yet in your own fantaſies, you ſeeme very young. And further they ſay, that you Apparrell your ſelues a newe now, as though preſently you came into the worlde: and moreouer they ſay, that you are offended with nothing ſo much, as when they call you olde, and that in Theaters where comedies are played: and in the Fieldes, where the brute beaſts doe run, you are not the hindmoſt, and that there is no ſporte, nor lightnes inuented in Rome, but firſt it is regiſtred in your houſe. And finally, they ſay, that you giue your ſelues ſo vnto pleaſures, as though you neuer thought to receyue diſpleaſures.
                     O Claude and Claudine, by the God Iupiter I ſweare vnto you, that I am aſhamed of your vnſhamefaſtnes, and am greatly abaſhed of your manners: and aboue all, I am exceedingly grieued for your offence. For at that time that you ought to lift your hands, you are returned againe into the filth of the world. Manie things men commit, which though they ſeeme graue, yet by moderation of the perſon that cōmitteth them, they are made light: but ſpeaking according to the truth, I finde one reaſon, whereby I might excuſe your lightes: but to the contrarie, I ſee tenne whereby I may condemne your follies.
                     
                        Solon the Phyloſopher in his Lawes ſaid to the Athenians, that if the young offended, hee ſhould be gently admoniſhed, The difference of Solon and Lycurgus in opinion. and grieuouſly puniſhed, becauſe he was ſtrong: and if the olde erre, hee ſhould bee lightly puniſhed, and ſharply admoniſhed, ſith hee was weake and feeble.
                     To this Lycurgus in his lawes, to the Lacedemonians, ſayd contrarie: That if the young did offend, hee ſhould be lightly puniſhed, and grieuouſly admoniſhed, ſince through ignorance he did erre: and the olde man which did euill, ſhould bee lightly admoniſhed, and ſharply puniſhed, ſince thorough malice hee did offend.
                     Theſe two phyloſophers beeing (as they haue bin) of ſuch authority in the worlde that is paſt, and conſidering that their lawes and ſentences were of ſuch weight, it ſhould bee much raſhnes in not admitting the one of them.
                     Now not receiuing the one, nor rereprouing

the other: Mee thinketh that there is no great excuſe to the young for their ignorance, and great condemnation to the aged for their experience.
                     Once againe I returne to ſay that you pardon me, my friends, and you ought not greatly to weigh it, thogh I am ſomewhat ſharpe in condemnation, ſince you others are ſo diſſolute in your liues: for of your blacke life my penne doth take inke.
                     I remember wel that I haue heard of thee Claude, that thou haſt beene luſty and couragious in thy youth: ſo that thy ſtrength of all was enuyed, and the beauty of Claudine of all men was deſired.
                     I will not write vnto you in this letter, my friends and neighbours, nether reduce to memory, how thou Claude haſt employed thy forces in the ſeruice of the comonwealth: and thou Claudine haſt won much honor of thy beauty: for ſundry times it chā
                        ced, that men of many goodly giftes are noted of grieuous offences. Thoſe which ſtriued with thee are all dead, thoſe whom thou deſireſt are deade, thoſe which ſerued thee Claudine are dead, thoſe which before thee Claudine ſighed, are dead: thoſe which for thee dyed, are now dead: and ſince all thoſe are deade with theyr lightneſſe, doe not you others thinke to die, and your follies alſo? I doe demand now of thy youth one thing, and of thy beauty another thing, what do you receiue of theſe paſtims of theſe good entertainements, of theſe aboundances, of theſe great contentations, of the pleaſures of the world, of the vanitie that is paſt, and what hope you of all theſe to carry into the narrow graue?
                     O ſimple, ſimple, and ignoraunt perſons, how our life conſumeth, and wee perceiue not how wee liue therein. For it is no felicitie to enioy a ſhort or long life: but to know to employ the ſame eyther well or euill,
                     O children of the earth, and Diſciples of vanitie, now you know that Time flyeth, without mouing his wings, the life goeth without lifting vp his feete, the World diſpatcheth vs not telling vs the cauſe, men doe beguile vs not mouing their lippes, our fleſh conſumeth to vs vnawares: the heart dyeth, hauing no remedie: and finally our glorie decaieth, as it it had neuer beene, and death oppreſſeth vs without knocking at the dore.
                     Though a man be neuer ſo ſimple, or ſo very a foole, yet hee cannot deny, but it is impoſſible for to make a fire in the bottome of the ſea, to make a way in the ayre, of the thinne bloud to make rough ſinewes, and of the ſoft veines to make hard bones. I meane that it is vnpoſſible, that the greene flower of youth, be not one day withered by age.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XX. The Emperour followeth his Letter and perſwadeth Claudius and Claudinus being now olde, to giue no more credite to the World, nor to any of his deceitfull flatteryes.
                     
                     
                        THat which I haue The continuation of the Emperours letter to his friends. ſpoken now, tendeth more to aduertiſe the young, then to teach the olde: For you others haue now paſſed the prime time of childhood, the ſummer of youth, and the harueſt of adoleſcency, and are in the winter of age, where it ſeemeth an vncomely

thing, that thoſe your hoary haires ſhould bee accompanied with ſuch vaine follies. Sithens young men know not that they haue to end their youth, it is no maruell, that they follow the world: but the olde men, which ſee themſelues fall into this guile, why will they runne after vices againe?
                     O world, for that thou art the world, ſo ſmal is our force, &amp; ſo great our debilitie, that thou willing it, and we not reſiſting it, thou doſt ſwallow vs vp in the moſt perillous gulfe, and in the thornes moſt ſharpe thou doſt pricke vs: by the priuieſt wayes thou leadeſt vs, &amp; by the moſt ſtony waies thou carrieſt vs. I meane, that thou bringeſt vs to the higheſt fauours, to the end that afterwards with a puſh of thy pike thou mighteſt ouerthrow vs. O world, wherein all is worldly, two and fifty yeeares haue paſſed ſince in thee I was firſt borne, during The vanity of the world and the vncertainety thereof. which time thou neuer toldeſt mee one truth: but I haue taken thee with ten thouſand lyes. I neuer demanded the thing but thou diddeſt promiſe it me, and yet it is nothing at all that euer thou diddeſt perform. I neuer put my truſt in thee, but euer thou beguiledſt me, I neuer came to thee, but thou diddeſt vndoo me: finally, neuer ſaw I ought in thee wherby thou deſerueſt loue, but alwayes hatred.
                     This preſuppoſed, I know not what is in thee. O world, or what we worldlings want: for if thou hateſt vs we cannot hate thee, if thou doeſt vs iniury, we can diſſemble it, if thou ſpurne vs with thy feet, wee wil ſuffer it, if thou beateſt vs with a ſtaffe, wee wil hold our peace, alſo though thou perſecuteſt vs, we will not complain, though thou take ours, wee will not demand it of thee, though thou doſt beguile vs, we will not call ourſelues beguiled, and the worſt of all is, that thou doeſt chaſe vs from thy houſe, yet we will not depart from thence. I know not what this meaneth, I know not from whence this commeth: I know not who ought to prayſe this ſame, that wee couet to follow the world, which wil none of vs, and hate the gods which loue vs: oft times I make account of my yeares paſt, ſomtimes alſo I turne and toſſe my booke to ſee what I haue read, and another time I deſire my friends to giue mee good counſell: and for no other end I doe it, then to attaine to that I haue ſpoken, and to know that I will ſay. I reading Rethorike in Rhodes, Adrian my lord maintaining me there, knowing that I was two and thirty years of age, it hapned in the Spring time I found my ſelfe ſolitarily, and ſoluarineſſe with liberty ſmelled the world, and ſmelling it, I knew it, and knowit, I followed it, and following it, I attained it, &amp; attayning vnto it, therunto I ioyned my ſelfe, and ioyning my ſelfe therewith, I proued it, and in prouing it, I taſted it, and in taſting it, mee thought it bitter, and in finding it bitter I hated it, and hating it I left it, and leauing it, is returned, and being returned, I receyued it againe.
                     Finally, the world inuiting mee, and I not reſiſting it, two and fiftie yeares wee did eate our bread together, and in one houſe wee haue alwayes remayned, wilt thou know after what ſort the world and I doe liue in one houſe together, or better for to ſay, in one heart remayne? Harken then, and in one word I will tell it thee.
                     When I ſaw the world braue, I ſerued him, when hee ſaw me ſad, hee flattered mee, when I ſaw him wealthy, I asked him, when hee ſaw mee merry, hee begulled mee, when I deſired any thing, hee holpe me to attaine to it, and afterwards when

the ſame I beſt enioyed, then hee tooke it from me, when hee ſaw me not pleaſed, he viſited me, when hee ſaw mee, he forgot me, when he ſaw mee ouerthrowne, hee gaue mee his hand to releeue mee, when he ſaw me exalted, hee tripped me againe to ouerthrow me.
                     Finally, when I thinke that I haue ſomewhat in the world, I finde that all that I haue is a burthen.
                     If this which I haue ſpoken of the world bee any thing, more is that a great deale which yet of my ſelfe I will ſay, which is, that without doubt my folly is greater then his malice, ſince I am beguiled ſo oft, and yet alwayes I follow the deceyuer.
                     O world, world, thou haſt ſuch moods and faſhions in thy proceeding, that thou leadeſt vs all to perdition. Of one thing I maruell much, whereof I cannot bee ſatisfied. Which is, ſince that we may go vpon the bridge, and yet without any gaine wee doe wade through the water, and where as the ſhallow is ſure, wee ſeeke to runne into the gulfe, and where the way is drie, wee goe into the plaſh, where wee may eate wholeſome meates to nouriſh the life, wee receyue poyſon to haſten death, we ſeeke to deſtroy our ſelues, whereas wee may bee without danger.
                     Finally I ſay, without profite wee commit a fault, though wee ſee with How warie euery man ought to be our eyes the paine to follow. Wiſe men ought circumſpectly to ſee what they do, to examine that they ſpeake, to proue that they take in hand, for to beware whoſe company they vſe and aboue all, to know whom they truſt: For our iudgement is ſo corrupt, that to beguile vs, one is inough, and to make vs not to bee deceyued, tenne thouſand would not ſuffice. They haue ſo great care of vs, I doe meane the world to be guile vs, and the fleſh to flatter vs, that the high way being as it is narrow, the pathway daungerous, and full of prickes, the iourney is long, and the life ſhort: our bodies are neuer but loden with vices, and our hearts are full of ſorrows and cares.
                     I haue wondered at diuers things in this World, but that which aſtonieth mee moſt is, that thoſe which be good, we make them beleeue they are euill, and thoſe which are euill, wee perſwade others to beleeue that they are good. So that wee ſhoote at the white of vertues, and hit the butte of vices.
                     I will confeſſe one thing, the which beeing diſcloſed, I know that infamy will follow mee, but peraduenture ſome vertuous man will maruell at it, that is, that in thoſe two and fifty yeeres of my life, I haue proued al the vices of this world, for no other entent but for to proue if there bee any thing where in mans malice might be ſatisfied.
                     And afterwards all well conſidered, all examined, and all proued, I finde, that the more I eate, the more I dye for hunger, the more I drinke, the greater thirſt I haue, the more I reſt, the more I am broken, the more I ſleepe, the more drouſier I am: the more I haue, the more I couet: the more I deſire, the more I am tormented, the more I procure, the leſſe I attaine.
                     Finally, I neuer had ſo greate paine through want, but afterwards I had more trouble with exceſſe: it is No man euer contented with his eſtate in this world, a great folly to thinke, that as long as a man liueth in this fleſh, that he can ſatisfie the fleſh: for at the laſt caſt, ſhee may take from vs our life; but wee others cannot take from her, her diſordinate couetouſneſſe: if men did ſpeake with the Gods, or that the Gods were conuerſant with men, the firſt thing that I would aske them, ſhould bee, why they haue appointed

an end to our wofull dayes: and will not giue vs an end of our wicked deſires? O cruell Gods, what is it you doe? or what doe you ſuffer vs? it is certaine, that wee ſhall not paſſe one good day of life onely, but in taſting this, and that life conſumeth. O intollerable life of man, wherein there are ſuch malices, from the which wee ought to beware, and ſuch perils to fall in, and alſo ſo many things to conſider, that then both ſhee and wee doe ende to know our ſelues, when the houre of death approcheth.
                     Let thoſe know that know not, that the World taketh our will, and wee others like ignorants cannot deny it him, and afterwardes hauing power of our will, doth conſtraine vs to that which wee would not: ſo that many times wee would doe vertuous workes, and for that wee are now put into the Worlds hands, wee dare not do it.
                     The World vſeth another ſubtilty with vs, and to the end we ſhould not ſtriue with it, it prayſeth the Euery man ought to flye the vain intiſements of the world. times paſt, becauſe wee ſhould liue according to the time preſent.
                     And the World ſayeth further, that if wee others employ our forces in his vices, he giueth vs licence, that wee haue a good deſire of vertue. O would to God in my dayes I might ſee, that the care which the Worlde hath to preſerue vs, the Worldlings would take it to withdraw them from his vices. I ſweare that the Gods ſhould then haue more ſeruants, and the World and the fleſh ſhould not haue ſo many ſlaues.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXI. The Emperour proceedeth in his Letter, and proueth by good reaſons, that ſith the aged perſons will bee ſerued and honoured of the young, they ought to be more vertuous and honeſt then the young.
                     
                     
                        I Haue ſpoken all this before rehearſed, for occaſion of you Claude and Claudine 
                        The proſecution of the Emperours letter teaching old men to be vertuous the which at 60 and 10 yeeres will not keepe out the priſon of the world: You, I ſay, which haue your bodies weake and corrupted, what hope ſhall wee haue of young men which are but 25. yeeres of age (if my memorie deceiue mee not, when I was there, you had Nephewes married, and of their children made ſure, and two of the children borne: and ſince that is true, mee thinketh when the fruite is gathered, the fruit is of no value, and after the meale is taken from the mill, euil ſhal the mill grinde.
                     I meane that the olde man ought to deſire that his daies might be ſhortened in this world. Do not thinke my friends, that a man can haue his houſe full of Nephewes, and yet ſay, that he is very yong? for in loding the tree with fruites, the bloſſoms immediately fall, or elſe they become withered. I haue imagined with my ſelfe, what it is that you might doe to ſee me yong, and cut of ſome of your yeares: and in the end I know no other reaſon, but when you married Alamberta your daughter with Druſius, and your Neece Sophia the faire, with Tuſcidan, which were ſo yong, that the daughters were ſcarce 15.

veares old, nor the young men 20. I ſuppoſe, becauſe you were rich of yeares, and poore of money, that he gaue to euery one of them in ſtead of money for dowry ten yeares of yours: hereof a man may gather, that the money of your Nephewes haue remayned vnto you, and you haue giuen vnto them of your owne yeares. I vnderſtand my friends, that your deſire is to bee yong, and very yong: but I greatly deſire to ſee you old and very old I doe not meane in yeares, which in you doth ſurmount, but in diſcretion, which in you doth want.
                     O Claude and Claudine, note that which I wil ſay vnto you, and beare it alwayes in your memory.
                     I let you know, that to maintaine youth, to deface age, to liue contented, to be free from trauels, to lengthen life, and to auoyde death: Theſe things are not in the hands of men, which doe deſire them, but rather in the hands of thoſe which giueth thē: the which according to their iuſtice, and not according to our couetouſneſſe, doe giue vs life by weight, and death without meaſure.
                     One thing the old men do, which is cauſe of ſlaundering many, that is, that they will ſpeake firſt in counſels, they will bee ſerued of the young in feaſts, they will bee firſt placed, in all that they ſay they will be beleeued, in Churches they will bee higher then the reſidue, in diſtributing of offices they will haue the moſt honour, in their opinions they will not be gaineſayde. Finally, they, will haue the credite of old ſage men, and yet they will leade the life of young doting fooles. All theſe preheminences and priuiledges, it is very iuſt that olde men What is required in euery olde man. ſhould haue ſpent their yeares in the ſeruice of the common-wealth: but with this I do aduiſe &amp; require them, that the authoritie giuen them with their white haires, bee not diminiſhed by their euill works.
                     Is it a iuſt thing that the humble &amp; honeſt yong mā do reuerence to the aged man, proud and diſdainefull? Is it a iuſt thing that the gentle and gracious yong man do reuerence to the enuious and malitious old man? is it a iuſt thing that the vertuous and patient young man do reuerence to the fooliſh and vnpatient old man? is it a iuſt thing, that the ſtout and liberal yong man doe reuerence to the miſerable &amp; couetous old man? is it iuſt that the diligent and carefull young man do reuerence to the negligent old man? is it iuſt that the abſtinent and ſober yong man do reuerence to What duty is required of the yong man to the olde. the greedy and gluttonous old man? is it iuſt that the chaſt and continent yong man do reuerence to the lecherous and diſſolute olde man? Mee thinketh theſe things ſhould not bee ſuch, that thereby the old man ſhold be honored, but rather reproued and puniſhed. For old men offend more, by the euill example they giue, then by the fault which they cōmit. Thou canſt not deny me, my friend Claude, that it is 33. years ſince we both were at the Theaters to behold a play whē thou cameſt late, and found no place for thee to ſit in, thou ſaydeſt vnto mee who was ſet, Riſe my ſonne Mark, and ſithens now thou art yong, it is but iuſt that thou giue mee place which am aged.
                     
                     If it bee true, that it is three and thirty yeares ſithence thou askedſt place in the Theaters as an olde man: Tell me, I pray thee, and alſo I coniure thee, with what oyntment haſt thou annoynted thy ſelfe, or with what water haſt thou waſhed thy ſelfe to become young. O Claude, if thou hadſt found any medicine, or diſcouered any herbe, wherwith thou couldeſt take white haires from mens heades, and from women the wrinccles of their face: I ſweare vnto thee,

and alſo I doe aſſure thee, that thou ſhouldeſt be more viſited and ſerued in Rome, then the God Apollo is in his Temple at Epheſus. Thou ſhouldeſt well remember Annius Priſcus, the old man, which was our Neighbour, and ſomewhat a kinne to thee: the which, when I tolde him that I could not be filled with his good words, and to behold his auncient white haires, he ſaid vnto me.
                     Oh my Sonne Marke, it appeareth well that thou haſt not bin aged, becauſe thou talkeſt as a young man: For if white haires do honour the perſon, they greatly hurt the hart. For at that houre when they ſee vs aged, the ſtrangers doe hate vs, and ours do not loue vs. And he told me more: I let thee know my ſonne Marke, that many times my wife and I, talking of the yeares of another particularly, when ſhee beholdeth mee, and that I ſeeme vnto her ſo aged: I ſay vnto her, and ſweare that I am yet young, and that theſe white hayres came vnto mee by great trauells, and the age by ſicknes.
                     I doe remember alſo, that this Annius Priſcus was Senatour one yeare: and becauſe he would not ſeem aged, but deſired that men ſhold iudge him to be young, he ſhaued his beard and his head, which was not accuſtomed among the Senatours nor Cenſors of Rome: And on a day among the other Senators, he entred into the high Capitoll, one ſaide vnto him thus. A Queſtion demaunded of a
                              •
                            Senatour of Rome.
                     
                     Tell me man, from whence comeſt thou? What wilt thou? and why commeſt thou hither? How durſt thou being no Senatour, enter into the Senate? Hee anſwered, I am Annius Priſcus the aged: How chaunceth it now you haue not knowne me? They replyed vnto him: if thou wert Annius Priſcus, thou wouldeſt not come hither thus ſhauen.
                     For, in the ſacred Senate can none enter to gouerne the commonwealth, vnleſſe his perſon be endued with vertues, and his head with white hayres: and therefore thou art baniſhed, and depriued of thy Office. For the olde, which liue as the young ought to bee puniſhed.
                     Thou knoweſt well Claude and Claudine, that that which I haue ſpoken, is not the faynings of Homer, neyther a Fable of Ouide: but that you your ſelues ſaw it with your eyes, and in his baniſhment I did helpe him with money: and moreouer he was baniſhed another time for the lightnes hee did commit in the night in the Citie: and I maruell not hereof; For we ſee by experience, that Olde men which are fleſhed in vices, are more obſtinate to correct then the young.
                     Oh what euill fortune haue the old men, which haue ſuffered themſelues to waxe olde in vice? For, more dangerous is the fire in an old houſe then in a newe: and a great cut of a ſword is not ſo perillous, as a rotten Fiſtula.
                     
                     Though olde men were not honeſt and vertuous, for the ſeruice of the Gods and the commonwealth, for the ſaying of the people, nor for the example of the young: yet he ought to bee honeſt, if it were but for the reuerence of their yeares.
                     If the poore old man haue no teeth, how ſhall he eate? If he haue no heate in his ſtomacke, how can he diſgeſt? If hee haue no taſte, how can he drinke? if he be not ſtrong, how can hee be an adulterer? if he haue no feet, how can he goe? if he haue the palſey, how can he ſpeake: if he haue the gowte in his hands, how can he play? Finally, ſuch like worldly &amp; vicious men, haue employed their forces being young, deſirous to proue al theſe vices: and when they are old it grieueth thē extreamly that they cānot acompliſh their deſire
                     Amongſt all theſe faultes in olde men (in myne opinion,) this is the chiefeſt, that ſince they haue proued

all things, that they ſhould ſtill remaine in theyr obſtinate follie. There is no parte but they haue trauelled, no villanie but they haue eſſayed, no Fortune but they haue proued, no good but they haue perſecuted, no euill but hath chanced vnto them, nor there is any wickednes, but they haue attēpted
                     Theſe vnhappie men which in this Olde mē by experience know and feele many daungers. ſort haue ſpent all their youth, haue in the ende theyr combes cut, with infirmities and diſeaſes: yet they are not ſo much grieued with the vices (which in them doe abound) to hinder them from vertues, as they are tormented for want of corporall courage, to further them in their luſtes.
                     Oh if wee were Gods, or that they would giue vs licence to knowe the thoughtes of the olde, as wee ſee with our eyes, the deedes of the young.
                     I ſweare to the God Mars, and alſo to the Mother Berecynthia, that without compariſon, wee would puniſh more the wicked deſires which the aged haue to be wicked: then the light deedes of the young.
                     Tell mee Claude and Claudine, doe you thinke though you behaue your ſelues as young, you ſhall not ſeme to be olde? Knowe you not that our nature is the corruption of our bodie: and that our bodie hindereth our vnderſtandings, and that the vnderſtandings are kept of our ſoule, and that our ſoule is the mother of deſires and that our deſires are the ſcourge of our youth, and that our youth is the enſigne of our age, and age the ſpye of death, and that death in the end is the houſe where life taketh his harbor: &amp; from whēce youth flyeth a foot, &amp; frō whence age cānot eſcape a horſeback?
                     I would reioyce that you Claude and Claudine, would but tell mee what you finde in this life, that ſo much therwith you ſhould be contented: ſince no we you haue paſſed foure-ſcore yeares of life, during the which time, either you haue bin wicked in the worlde, or elſe you haue bin good. If you haue bin good, you ought to thinke it long vntill you bee with the good Gods: if you haue bin euill, it is iuſt you dye, to the ende you be no worſe.
                     For ſpeaking the truth, thoſe which in threeſcore and ten yeares haue bin wicked in workes, leaue ſmall hope of their amendment of life.
                     
                        Adrian my Lord, beeing at Nola in Campania, one brought vnto him a nephew of his from the ſtudie, whereas the yong childe had not profited a little: for hee became a great Grecian, and Latiniſt: and moreouer, hee was faire gratious, and honeſt.
                     And this Emperour Adrian loued his Nephew ſo much, that he ſaide vnto him theſe wordes: My Nephewe, I knowe not whether I ought to ſay vnto 
                        A ſpeech of the Emperor Adrian. 
                        thee that thou art good, or euill: For, if thou be euill, life ſhall be euill employed on thee, and if thou be good, thou oughteſt to dye immediately: and becauſe I am worſe then all, I liue longer then all.
                     
                     Theſe words which Adrian my Lord ſaid, doe plainly declare and expreſſe, that in ſhort ſpace the pale and cruell death doth aſſault the good, and lengtheneth life a great while to the euill.
                     The opinion of a phyloſopher was, that the gods are ſo profound in their ſecrets, high in their myſteries, and ſo iuſt in their works, that to men which leaſt profite the commonwealth, they lengthen life longeſt: and though he had not ſaide it, we others ſee it by experience. For the man which is good, and that beareth great zeale &amp; friendſhip to the Commonwealth: eyther the Gods take him from vs, or the Enemyes doe ſlay him, or the daungers doe caſt him away, or the trauells doe finiſh him. When the great Pompeyus and Iulius Caeſar became enemyes, and from that enmitie came to cruell warres, the Gronicles of the time declare, that the kings and people of the

occidental part became in he fauour of Iulius Caeſar, and the mightieſt, and moſt puiſſant of al the oriental parts, came in the ayde of great Pompeius, becauſe theſe two Princes were loued of a few, and ſerued and feared of all:
                     Amongſt the diuerſity and ſundry nations of people which came out of the Orientall part, into the hoaſt of the great Pompeius, one nation came maruellous, and cruell barbarous, which ſayde, they dwelled on the other ſide of the mountaine Riphees, which goe vnto India.
                     
                     And theſe Barbarians had a Cuſtome, not to liue no longer then fifty yeares: and therefore when they came to that age, they made a greater A cuſtome among the Barbarians. fire, and were burned therin aliue; and of their owne wils they ſacrificed themſelues to the Gods. Let no man be aſtonied at that we haue ſpoken, but rather let them maruell of that wee will ſpeake (that is to ſay) that the ſame day any man had accō
                        pliſhed fifty yeares, immediately hee caſt himſelfe quicke into the fire, and his friends made a great feaſt. And the feaſt was, that they did eate the fleſh of the dead halfe burned, and dranke in wine and water the aſhes of his bones: ſo that the ſtomacke of the childrē being aliue, was the graue of the Fathers being dead.
                     All this that I haue ſpoken with my tongue, Pompeius hath ſeene with his eyes, for that ſome being in the camp did accompliſh fifty yeares; and becauſe the caſe was ſtrange, hee declared it oft in the Senate.
                     Let euery man iudge in this caſe, what he will, and condemne the barbarians at his pleaſure, yet I will not ceaſe to ſay what I thinke. O golden world, which had ſuch men. O bleſſed people, of whom in the World to ome ſhall be a perpetuall memorie, What contempt of world? what forgetfulneſſe of himſelfe? what ſtroke of fortune? what whippe for the fleſh? what little regard of life? O what bridle for the vertuous? O what confuſion for thoſe that loue life. O how great example haue they left vs, not to feare death. Sithens thoſe here haue willingly deſpiſed their owne liues, it is not to be thought that they dyed to take the goods of others, neither yet to thinke that our life ſhould neuer haue end, nor our couetouſneſſe in like manner.
                     O glorious people, and ten thouſand fold happy, that the proper ſenſuality being forſaken, haue ouercom the naturall appetite to deſire to liue, not beleeuing in that they ſaw, and that hauing faith in that they neuer ſaw, they ſtriued with the fatall Deſtenies. By the way they aſſaulted fortune, they changed life for death, they offered the body to death, and aboue all, haue wonne honour with the Gods, not for that they ſhoulde haſten death, but becauſe they ſhould take away that which is ſuperfluous of life. Archagent a Surgeon of Rome, and Anthonius Muſus, a Phyſition of the Emperour Auguſtus, and Eſculapius, father of the Phiſicke, ſhould get little money in that Countrie. Hee that then ſhould haue ſent to the barbarous to haue done as the Romanes at that time did, that is to ſay, to take ſirrops in the mornings, pils at night, to drinke milke in the morning, to annoint themſelues with grome
                           •
                        ſeed to bee let bloud to day, and purged to morrow, to eate of one thing, and to abſtaine from many, a man ought to thinke, that hee which willingly, ſeeketh death, will not giue money to lengthen life.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXII. The Emperour concludeth his letter, and ſhewed what perils thoſe olde men liue in, which diſſolutely like young children paſſe their dayes, and giueth vnto them wholeſome counſell for the remedy thereof.
                     
                     
                        BVt returning to thee Claude and to thee Claudine, me thinketh The concluſion of the Emperours letter, reprouing old men which liue diſſolutely, like young children. that theſe barbarous men beeing fifty yeares of age, and you others hauing aboue threeſcore and tenne, it ſhould be iuſt, that ſithence you were elder in yeares, you were equall in vertue, and though (as they) you wil not accept death patiently, yet at the leaſt you ought to amend your euill liues willingly.
                     I doe remember, that it is many yeares ſithens, that Fabritius the young, ſonne of Fabritius the olde, had ordayned to haue deceiued mee: of the which, if you had not told me great inconueniences had happned: and ſithens that you did me ſo great a benefite, I would now requite you the ſame with another the like. For amongſt friends there is no equal benefite, then to deceiue the deceyuer: I let you know, if you do not know it, that you are poore aged folks, your eyes are ſunke into your heads, the noſtrels are ſhut, the haires are white, the hearing is loſt, the tongue faultereth, the teeth fall, the face is wrinkled, the feete ſwolne, and the ſtomacke cold. Finally I ſay, that if the graue could ſpeake, as vnto his Subiects, by iuſtice he might commaund you to inhabite his houſe.
                     It is great pitty of the yong men and of their youthfull ignorance; for then vnto ſuch their eies are not opened, to know the miſhaps of this miſerable life, when cruell death doth end their dayes, and adiorneth them to the graue.
                     
                        Plato in his booke of the Common wealth ſayde, that in vaine wee giue good counſels, to fond and light young men: for youth is without experience of that it knoweth, ſuſpitious of that it heareth, incredible of that is tolde him, deſpiſing the counſell of an other, and very poore of his own. For ſo much as this is true that I tell you Claude, and Claudine, that without compariſon, the ignorance which the young haue of the good, is not ſo much: but the obſtination which the olde hath in the euill is more: For the mortall Gods many times doe diſſemble with a thouſand offences commited by ignorance, but they neuer forgiue the offence perpetrated by malice.
                     O Claude, and Claudine, I doe not maruell that you doe forget the gods, (as you doe) which created you, and your Fathers, which begot you, and your parents which haue loued you, and your friends which haue honoured you: but that which I moſt maruell at is, that you forget your ſelues: For you neuer conſider what you ought to bee, vntill ſuch time as you bee there where you would not bee, and that without power to returne backe againe.
                     Awake, awake, ſince you are drowned in your dreames, open your eyes ſince you ſleepe ſo much, accuſtome your ſelues to trauels, ſithence you are vagabonds, learne that which behoueth you, ſince now you are olde. I meane, that in time conuenient you agree with death, before he make execution of life.
                     Fifty two yeeres haue I knowne

the things of the world, and yet I neuer ſaw a Woman ſo aged thorough yeares, nor old man with members ſo feeble, that for want of ſtrength could not (if they liſt) doe good: nor yet for the ſame occaſion ſhould leaue to bee euill, if they liſt to be euill.
                     It is a maruellous thing to ſee, and worthy to note, that all the corporall members of Man waxeth old, but the inward hart, and the outward tongue: For the heart is alwayes giuen to inuent All the mē
                           bers of man waxe feeble in time, but onely the heart and tongue. euills, and the tongue is alwayes able to tell Lyes.
                     Mine opinion is, that the pleaſaunt Summer beeing paſt, you ſhould prepare your ſelues for the vntemperate winter which is at hand. And if you haue but fewe dayes to continue, you ſhould make haſt to take vp your lodging. I meane that ſith you haue paſſed the dayes of your life with trauell, you ſhould prepare your ſelues againſt the night of death, to be in the hauen of reſt.
                     Let mockeryes paſſe as mockeries, and accept trueth as truth: that is to ſay, that it were a very iuſt thing, and alſo for your honour neceſſarie, that all shoſe which in times paſt haue ſeen you young and fooliſh, ſhould now in your age, ſee you graue and ſage. For there is nothing that ſo much forgetteth the lightneſſe and follyes of youth, as doth grauity and conſtancie in Age.
                     When the Knight runneth his carriere, they blame him not for that the Horſes mane is not finely combed: but at the end of his race he ſhold ſee his horſe amended, and looked vnto: What greater confuſion can be to any perſon, or greater ſlaunder to our mother Rome, then to ſee that which now a dayes therein we ſee? That is to ſay: that the old which can ſcarcely creepe through the ſtreetes, to beholde the playes and games as young men, which ſearch for nought elſe but onely pompe and vanitie?
                     It grieueth mee to ſpeake it, but I am much more aſhamed to ſee, that the olde Romaines do daylie cauſe the white haires to be plucked out of their heads, becauſe they would not ſeeme old, to make their beard ſmall, to ſeem yong, wearing their hoſen very cloſe, their ſhyrts open before: the gowne of the Senatour embrodered, the Romane ſigne richly enamelled, the coller of golde at the necke, as thoſe of Dace: Fringes in their gownes, as thoſe of Saphire, hoops in their hattes, as the Greekes, and pearls on their fingers, as thoſe of India.
                     
                     What wilt thou I tell thee more, then I haue tolde thee? but that they weare theyr Gownes long and large, as thoſe of Tharento, and they weare The pride of the auncient Senatours of Rome. them of the colour as men of warre: and euery weeke they haue change, as players: and the worſte of all is, that they ſhew themſelues as doating with loue, now in their Age, as others haue done heretofore in their youth.
                     That old men are ouercome by yong deſires, I doe not maruel, for that brutiſh Luſt is as naturall, as the daylie foode: but the olde men (being olde men) ſhould be ſo diſſolute: herewith men iuſtly ought to be offended. For the olde men couetous, and of Fleſh vicious, both offend the Gods, and ſlaunder the commonwealth.
                     Oh how many I haue knowne in Rome, who in their youth haue been highly prayſed and eſteemed, and after wardes through giuing themſelues to very much lightnes in their age, haue bin of all abhorred. And the worſt of all is, that they haue loſt all theyr credite, their parents, their fauour, and their poore innocent Children theyr profit? For many times the Gods permit, that the Fathers committing the offences, the paines ſhould fall vpon their owne children.
                     The renowmed Gaguino Cato, who

diſcended from the hie linage of the ſage Catoes, was fiue yeares Flamen prieſt, and adminiſtrator to the Veſtall virgins, three yeers Pretor, two yeeres Cenſor, one yeere Dictator, &amp; fiue times Conſull, being 75. yeares olde, he gaue himſelf to follow, ſerue and to deſire Roſana, and daughter of Gneus Curſius, a Lady of truth verie young and faire, and of many deſired, and much made of: time afterwards paſſing away, and God Cupid doing his office, the loue was ſo kindled inwardly in the heart of this olde man, that hee ranne almoſt mad: So that after hee had conſumed all his goods in ſeruing her dayly, he ſighed, and nightly hee wept, onely for to ſee her.
                     It chaunced that the ſaide Roſana fell ſicke of a burning ague, wherewith ſhee was ſo diſtempered, that ſhee could eate no meat, but greatlie deſired to eates grapes: and ſithens there were none ripe at Rome, Gaguino Cato ſent to the riuer of Rheyn, to fetch ſome, being farre, and many miles diſtant from thence,
                     And when the thing was ſpredde through Rome, and that all the people knew it, and the Senate vnderſtanding the folly of him: the Fathers A ſeuere ſentence giuen by the Senators of Rome vpon an old man. commaunded that Roſana ſhould be looked vp with the Veſtall Virgins, &amp; the olde man baniſhed Rome for euer, to the end, that to them it ſhould be a puniſhment, and to others an example.
                     Truely it grieued mee ſore to ſee it, and alſo I had great paines in writing it: For I ſaw the Father dye in infamie, and his children liue in pouertie: I beleeue that all thoſe which ſhall heare this example, and all thoſe which ſhall reade this writing, ſhall finde the fact of this amorous olde man, both vile and filthy, and they will allow the ſentence of the Senate which they gaue againſt him for good and iuſt.
                     I ſweare, that if Gaguino Cato had had as manie young men in his baniſhment as he left olde men Louers that followed his example in Rome: there ſhould not be caſt away ſo many men, neyther ſo many women euill married.
                     It chanceth oft times, that when the olde men (ſpecially being noble and valiant) are aduertiſed of their ſeruants, are rebuked of their parents, are prayed of their friends, and accuſed of their enemies to bee diſhoneſt in ſuch a place, they anſwere, That they are not in loue, but in ieſt.
                     
                     When I was very young, no leſſe in wiſedome, then in age, one night in the Capitoll I met with a neighbour of mine, the which was ſo old, that hee might haue taken me for his nephew: to whom I ſayde theſe words: Lord Fabritius, are you alſo in 
                        A queſtion demaunded of an olde man and his anſwere. 
                        Loue? he anſwered me. You ſee that my age ſuffereth me not that I ſhould be a louer, if I ſhould bee, it is but in ſport.
                     
                     Truly I maruelled to meete him at that houre, and I was aſhamed to haue ſuch an anſwere. In olde men of great age and grauity ſuch requeſt cannot be called loue, but griefe, not paſtime, but loſſe of time, not mocrie, but villanie: for of loue in ieſt, enſueth infamy indeed.
                     I aske you Claude and Claudine, what a thing is it, to ſee an olde man bee in loue? Truely it is no other, but as a garland before the Tauerne doores: where al men think that there is wine, and they ſell nought elſe but vineger. They are egges white without, &amp; rotten within, they are golden pilles, the taſt wherof are very bitter, and as emptie boxes in ſhops, which haue newe writings on them, or as a new gate, and within in the houſe is full of filth and cobwebs.
                     Finally, the old Louer is a knight

of Exchetes, which helpeth to loſe money, and can deliuer no man from perill. Let this word be noted, and alwayes in your memory committed, That the olde man that is vitious, is but 
                        A good example, and worthie to be noted. 
                        as a Leeke which hath the head white, and the tale greene.
                     
                     Mee thinketh that you ought to breake the wings of time, ſince that you haue feathers to flye withall: deceyue not your ſelfe, nor your friends and neighbours, ſaying, that there is time for all. For the amendment is in your hands, but time is in the hands of God to diſpoſe.
                     Let vs come now to remedy this great dammage, doe what you can by the day of youth, and deferre it not vntill the night of age, for ill cutteth the knife, when the edge thereof is dulled: and ill can hee gnawe the bones which is accuſtomed to eate the fleſh. I tell you, and aduertiſe you, that when the olde and rotten houſes beginne to fall, vnderſet not them with rotten wood, but with hard timber. I meane with the vpright thoughts of accounts, which we ought to giue the Gods of our life, and to men of our renowne.
                     For I ſay, that if the Vine bee gathered of our vertues, wee ought to graffe againe the amendment: and if the ſhreds of our gatherings be drye and withered through our peruerſe workes, wee ought to ſet them againe with new mould and good deſires.
                     The Gods are ſo gentle to ſerue, and ſo good to content, that if for all the ſeruices we owe them, and for the gifts which they giue vs, we cannot pay them in good works: they demaund no more in pauement but good wils.
                     Finally, I ſay, that if thou Claude and Claudine haue offered the meale of youth to the world, offer now the bloud of age to the Gods.
                     I haue written longer then I had thought to haue done. Salute all my neighbours, ſpecially Druſio the Patrician, and noble Roman widow. I remember that Gobrine your neece did mee a pleaſure, that day of the Feaſt of the mother Berecinthia, wherfore I ſend two thouſand Seſterces, one thouſand to helpe to marry her: and the other thouſand to helpe for to releeue your pouerty.
                     My wife Fauſtine is ſicke, and I ſend you another 1000. Seſterces to giue to the Veſtall virgins, to pray to the Gods for her.
                     My wife ſendeth to thee Claudine a Cofer: by the immortall Gods I ſweare vnto thee, I cannot tell what is in it. I beſeech the Gods ſithence you are aged to giue you a good death, and to me and Fauſtine, they ſuffer vs to leade a good life. Marcus of mount Celio with his own hand writeth this.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXIII. Princes ought to take heede that they be not noted of auarice, for that the couetous man is both of God and man hated.
                     
                     
                        THe great Alexander King of Macedony, and Darius the vnfortunate What cauſed Alexander to be loued and honoured King of Perſians, were not onely contrary in wars and conqueſts, which they made, but alſo in the conditions and inclinations which they had: For Alexander naturally loued to giue and ſpend: and Darius to the contrarie, to heape, locke and keepe. When the fame of Alexander was ſpredde abroade throughout all the

word to bee a Prince of honour, and not couetous, his owne loued him intirely, &amp; ſtrangers deſired to ſerue him faithfully.
                     The miſerable King Darius, as he King Darius noted of couetouſnes. was noted of great auarice, and of ſmall liberality, ſo his did diſobey him, and ſtrangers hated him: whereof may be gathered that Princes and great Lords by giuing, do make them ſelues rich: and in keeping, they make themſelues poore.
                     
                        Plutarch in his Apothegmes declareth, that after King Darius was dead, and Alexander had triumphed ouer all the Orientall parts, a man of Thebes being in the market place of Athens, ſetting forth the fortune of Alexander for the ſundry Countryes which hee had conquered, and deſcribing the euill fortune of Darius, for the great number of men which hee had loſt, a Philoſopher with a loude voyce ſayd, O man of Thebes, thou art greatly deceyued, to think that one prince loſeth many ſeigniories, and that the other Prince winneth many Realmes. For Alexander the Great, wann nought but ſtones and couerings of Cities: for with his liberality hee had already gotten the good wils of the Citizens: and on the contrary, the vnfortunate Darius did not loſe but ſtones, and the couertures of Cities, for with his couetouſneſſe and auarice hee had now loſt all the hearts of thoſe of Aſia.
                     And further, this Philoſopher ſayde vnto him, that Princes which will enlarge their eſtates, and amplifie their realmes in their conqueſts, ought firſt to winne the hearts, and to bee noble and liberall; and afterwards to ſend their armies to conquer the Forts, and wals, for otherwiſe little auayleth it to winne the ſtones, if the hearts do rebell.
                     Whereby a man may gather, that that which Alexander wanne, he wanne by liberality and ſtouteneſſe: and that which King Darius loſt, he loſt for being miſerable and couetous.
                     And let vs not maruell hereat, for that Princes and great Lordes which are ouercome with auarice, I doubt whether euer they ſhall ſee themſelus Conquerours of many realmes. The vice of auarice is ſo deteſtable, ſo euil, The vice of auarice ſo odious, that it cannot be ſufficiently expreſſed. ſo odious, and ſo perillous, that if a man ſhould employ himſelfe for to write all the diſcommodities thereunto belonging, my penne ſhoulde do nought elſe, then to preſume to drye vp all the water in the ſea: For the ſtomacke where auarice entreth, cauſeth a man to ſerue vices, &amp; worſhip Idols.
                     If a vertuous man would prepare himſelfe to thinke on the great trauel, and little reſt that this curſed vice beareth with him, I thinke that none would be vicious therein. Though the couetous man had no other trauell, but alwayes to goe to bed with daunger, and to riſe vp with care: Mee thinketh that it is a trouble ſufficient for ſuch a one when he goeth to bed, thinketh that hee ſhould bee killed in his bedde, or that ſleeping his coffers ſhould be rifled: and from that time he riſeth, hee is alwayes tormented with feare to loſe that which he hath wonne, and carefull to augment that little too much.
                     The diuine Plato in the firſt booke of his Common-wealth ſayde theſe words. The men be made rich, becauſe they neuer learned to bee rich: for he which continually, and truly will become rich, firſt ought to abhorre couetouſneſſe, before he begin to occupie himſelfe to locke vppe goods. For the man which ſetteth no bond to his deſire ſhall alwayes haue little though hee ſee himſelfe Lord of the world.
                     The ſentence of the Stoyckes doth ſatisfie my mind much, whereof

                        Ariſtotle in his politikes, maketh mention, where he ſayth: That vnto great affayres, are alwayes required great riches: and there is no extreame pouertie, but where there hath beene great aboundance, 
                        A worthie ſaying of Ariſtotle. 
                        &amp;c. Thereof enſueth, that vnto Princes and great Lordes which haue much, they want much: becauſe vnto men which haue had little, they can want but little.
                     If wee admoniſh worldlings not to be vicious, they will alwayes haue excuſes to excuſe themſelues, declaring why they haue been vicious: the vice of Auarice excepted, to whome, and with whom they haue no excuſe. For, if one vaine reaſon be ready to excuſe, there are two thouſand to condemne them. Let vs put example in all the principall vices, and wee ſhall ſee how this onely of Auarice remaineth condemned, and not excuſed?
                     If we reaſon why a noble Prince or great Lord is hautie and proude? He will aunſwere that hee hath great occaſion. For the naturall diſpoſition of men is, rather to deſire to commaund with trauell, then to ſerue with quyetnes and reſt.
                     If we reproue any man that is furious, and giuen to anger: hee will aunſwere vs, that we maruell not, ſince we maruell not of the proude: For that the enemy hath no more authority to trouble any man, then the other to take reuenge of him.
                     If we blame him for that he is fleſhly and vicious: he will anſwer vs, that hee cannot abſtaine from that ſinne: For, if any man can eſchew the actes, he fighteth continually with vncleane thoughts. If wee ſay that anie man is negligent, hee will anſwere vs, that he deſerueth not to be blamed: For, the vilenes of our nature is ſuch, that if we do trauell it, immediately it is wearie: and if we reſt it, immediately it reioyceth. If wee rebuke any man that is a glutton, hee will anſwere vs, that without eating and drinking, wee cannot liue in the world: for the Diuine Word hath not forbidden man to eate with the mouth, but the vncleane thoughts which come from the heart.
                     As of theſe few vices we haue declared, ſo may wee excuſe all the reſidue: but to the vice of couetouſneſſe, none can giue a reaſonable excuſe. For with money put into the coffer, the ſoule cannot profite, nor the bodie reioyce.
                     
                        Boetius in his booke of conſolation ſaid, That Money is good, not when wee haue it in poſſeſſion, but when wee want 
                        A true ſaying o
                              •
                            Boetius. 
                        it: And in very deede the ſentence of Boetius is very profound: For, when man ſpendeth money, he attaineth to that he will, but hauing it with him, it profiteth him nothing.
                     Wee may ſay of theſe rich and couetous men, that if they heape and keepe, they ſay it is for deere and drye yeares, and to relieue theyr parents and friends. We may aunſwer them, that they doe not heape vp to remedie the poore in like neceſſityes, but rather to bring the Common-wealth to greater pouerty. For then they ſell all things deere, and put out their money to great vſurie: ſo that this couetous man doth more harme with that he doth lend them, then the drie: yeare doth, with that it hath taken frō them.
                     The noble and vertuous men ought not ceaſe to doe well, for feare of dry yeares: For, in the ende if one deare yeare come, it maketh al deere: and at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a caſe, he onely may be called happie, which for being free and liberall in Almes, ſhall reioyce that his table ſhould be coſtly?
                     Let all couetous men beware, that for keeping of much goods, they giue not to the diuell theyr ſoules: For, it may bee that before the deare yeare commeth to ſel their Corne, their bodyes ſhalbe layd in the graue.
                     Oh what good doeth GOD to the Nobles, giuing them liberal harts: and

what ill lucke haue couetous men (hauing as they haue) their harts ſo hard laced: For if couetous men did taſte how ſweet and neceſſarie a thing it is to giue, they could keepe little for themſelues.
                     Now ſithens the miſerable and couetous men haue not the heart to giue to their friendes, to depart to their parents, to ſuccour the poore, to lend to their neighbours, nor to ſuſtaine the Orphanes, It is for to bee thought that they will ſpend it on themſelues.
                     Truly I ſay no more, for there are men ſo miſerable, and ſo hard of that they haue, that they thinke that as euill ſpent, which among themſelues they ſpend: as that which one robbeth from them of their goods. How The deſcription of a miſerable and couetous man. will the couetous and miſerable wretch giue a garment to a naked man, which dare not make himſelfe a coate? How will hee giue to eate to the poore familiar, which as a poore ſlaue eateth the bread of branne, and ſelleth the flower of meale? How ſhal the Pilgrims lodge in his houſe, who for pure miſery dare not enter? and how doth he viſite the Hoſpitall, and releeue the ſicke, that oft times hazardeth his owne health and life, for that hee will not giue one penny to the Phyſition? how ſhall hee ſuccour ſecretly the poore and needy, which maketh his owne children goe barefoote and naked? how can hee helpe to marry the poore maides being orphanes, when he ſuffereth his owne daughters to waxe olde in his houſe? how will hee giue of his goods to the poore Captiues, which will not pay his owne men their wages? how will he giue to eate to the children of poore Gentlemen, which alwayes grudgeth at that his owne ſpend? how ſhould wee beleeue that hee wil apparrell a widdow, which will not giue his owne wife a hoode? How doth hee daily giue almes, which goeth not to the Church on the Sunday, becauſe hee will not offer one penny? how ſhall the couetous man reioyce the heart, ſith for ſpending of one penny, oft times hee goeth ſupperleſſe to bed? And finally, I ſay, that hee will neuer giue vs of his own proper goods, which weepeth alwayes for the goods of another.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXIIII. The Author followeth his matter, and with great reaſons diſcommendeth the vices of couetous men.
                     
                     
                        ONe of the thinges Poverty far better, then riches with couetouſnes wherein the diuine prouidence ſheweth, that we do not vnderſtand the maner of her gouernement, is to ſee that ſhee giueth vnderſtanding to a man to know the riches, ſhee giueth him force to ſeeke them, ſubtilly to gather them, vertue to ſuſtaine them, courage to defend them, and alſo long life to poſſeſſe them.
                     And with all this ſhee giueth him not licence to enioy them, but rather ſuffereth him, that as without reaſon hee hath made himſelfe Lord of an other mans, of right hee ſhould bee made ſlaue of his owne: thereby a man may know, of how greater excellency vertuous pouerty is, then the outragious couetouſneſſe: for ſo much as to the poore, God doth giue contentation of that little hee hath, &amp; from the rich man he taketh contentation of the great deale hee poſſeſſeth,
                     So that to the couetous man wee ſee troubles encreaſe howerly, and

the gaine commeth vnto him but monethly. Let vs compare the rich and couetous man to the poore potter, and wee ſhall ſee who ſhall profite moſt, eyther the potter with his pots that he maketh of the earth, or elſe the couetous with his money, which he hath in the earth. Though I make no anſwere to this, yet anſwer herein hath already been made, that the one is much better at eaſe with the earth, then the other is with the good: For the Potter getteth his liuing by ſelling pots, and the couetous man loſeth his ſoule by keeping riches.
                     I humbly require the high Princes and alſo I beſeech the great Lordes, and further I admoniſh the other nobles and Plebeians, alwayes to haue this word in memory. I ſay and affirme, that the more ſtrongly the man keepeth, and locketh his treaſure, The deſire of couetous men neuer ſatiſfied. the more ſtrongly and priuily is he kept: for if hee put two keyes to keepe his treaſure, he putteth ſeuen to his heart not to ſpend them. Let the noble and valiant men beware, that they giue not their mindes to heape vp treaſures: for if once their hearts bee kindled with couetouſnes, for feare of ſpending a halfe penny, they will dayly ſuffer themſelues to fall into a thouſand miſeries. The Plebeians which are very rich may ſay, that they haue not heaped vp much treaſures, ſithence they cannot behold a hundred, or two hundred duccats. To this I anſwere, that the eſtates conſidered, ten duccates doe as much harme to a Treaſurer, as to others ten thouſand: For the fault conſiſteth not in keeping, or hiding (much or litle) riches: but forſomuch as in keeping them, we ceaſe to doe many good workes. To mee it is a ſtrange matter, that niggardlineſſe hath a greater force to the couetous, then conſcience hath in others: For there are many, which notwithſtanding conſcience, do profite with the goods of others, and the couetous hauing more miſery then conſcience, cannot yet profite with their owne: With much care and leſſe diligence the couetous men doe prouide that the millers do not rob the meale, that their beaſts make no waſts, that the Hunters run not through the corne, that their wine periſh not, that thoſe which owe them any thing, doe not go and make themſelues bankroutes, that wynets do not eate their corne, and the theeues rob not their goods: but in the end they watch none ſo well as themſelues: for all the others, (earely or late) haue alwayes oportunitie to robbe from them ſomewhat: but the couetous hath neuer the heart to change a duccate.
                     Men ought to take great pitty of a couetous man, who by his own will The deſcription of a couetous man. and not of neceſſity, weareth his gowne all to torne, his ſhooes out, his points without agglets, an euill fauouted girdle, his coate rent, his hat olde, his hoſe ſeame rent, his cap greaſie, and his ſhirt louſie. Finally, I ſay, that diuers of theſe miſers faine that they haue a great ſumme to pay, and it is for no other thing, but for not wearing a good garment. What can the couetous doe more, then for keeping a penny in his purſe, hee will go two moneths, and not trimme his beard? Sithence it is true that theſe pinch-penies doe behaue their perſons ſo euill, do ye thinke they haue their houſes any thing the better furniſhed? I ſay no, but you ſhal ſee their chambers full of cobwebs, the dores out of the hinges, the windowes riuen, the glaſſes broken, the planches looſe, the couertures of the houſe without gutters, the ſtooles broken, the beds worme-eaten, and chimnies ready to fall: ſo that to harbour a friend or kinſmen of theirs, they are

conſtrayned to Lodge him in theyr neighbours houſe, or elſe to ſende to borrow all that they want. And paſſing ouer the garments they weare, &amp; the houſen wherein they dwell, let vs ſee what Tables they keepe: For of their Gardens they eate no fruite, but that that falleth off the tree, of theyr vines but rotten grapes, of their ſheep the ſickeſt, of their Corne the wetteſt, of wine, that which hath taken winde, of Lard that is yeallow, of milke, that is turned. And finally I ſay, the felicitie that gluttons haue in eating, the ſelfe ſame haue they in keeping.
                     Oh vnhappie are the gluttons, and much more the couetous: for the taſt of one conſiſteth only in the throate, &amp; the felicitie of the other conſiſteth A compariſon between the glutton, &amp; the vſurer. in that he may locke vp in his cheſt.
                     Wee haue now ſeene how the couetous weare ſimple apparell, keepe a poore Table, and dwell in a filthie houſe: and yet they leſſe regard thoſe things that touch their honor. For, if they had their eares as open to heare, as they haue their hearts bent at eache houre to gather and heape vp: they ſhould heare how they are called myſers, vſurers, niggards, pinchpennies, oppreſſors, cruell, vnthankefull, and vnfortunate. Finally I ſay, that in the comon-wealth they are ſo hated, that all men had rather lay hāds vpon their bodyes to kill them, then tongues on their renowme, to defame them. The couetous man is of all other the moſt vnlucky. For, if he fall at ſtrife with any, he ſhal find no one friend that will come to viſit him in his houſe: but he ſhal haue a hundred thieues which wil rob him of his goods. For to reuenge a couetous enemy, a man neede deſire nought elſe but that he liue long: for, hee is more tormented in his life with his owne couetouſnes, then he can be otherwiſe with any pennance. If rich men would ſay vnto me, that they doe not reioice to haue faire houſes, ſithēs they haue thē, neither of curious apparell, ſince they may weare it, nor of daintie meates, ſithens they may eate them, and that that which they doe, is not to be couetous, but for that they are good Chriſtians.
                     In ſo iuſt a thing, reaſon would my pen ſhould ceaſe: but I am ſorry, they ſo little eſteem things touching their honour, and much leſſe the matters touching their conſcience.
                     If the auaritious ſay, hee keepeth goods to do almes, I doe not beleeue it: for dayly we ſee, if a poor man aske him alms, hee anſwereth them immediatly, God helpe you, for hee hath neither purſe nor money. The couetous The almes of the couetous man, if he giue any. vſeth this, that he neuer giueth almes in his houſe, but fat meat, reſtie bacon, rotten cheeſe, &amp; hoary bread: ſo that it ſeemeth rather that they make cleane their houſe, then giue almes to the poore. If the couetous man would tell vs, that that which they haue, is to diſcharge ſome debts of their predeceſſors, wherewith they are burdened. I ſay, it is a vaine excuſe, ſithens wee ſee that the willes of their fathers, of their mothers, and of their grandfathers, be not as yet performed, neyther will they thinke to performe them, which ſeemeth very true. For ſince the houre that they layde their fathers in the graue, they neuer had any thought of their deade Fathers.
                     Hee which of pure couetouſneſſe and miſery, ſuffereth himſelfe to dye for hunger and colde: I thinke hee hath ſmall deuotion for to giue almes, and much leſſe to doe any man good. If the couetous man ſay vnto vs, that that which hee keepeth, is for none other cauſe but for to build a ſumptuous Chappell, and to leaue of them ſome memory: To this I anſwere, That if ſuch a one doeth it with his owne proper ſwette, and maketh reſtitution of all

the euill that he hath done, it ſhall be ſanctified, and of all good men commended: but if the couetous wil that many liue in great pouerty, onely to make a rich tombe, God doth not command that, neyther dooth the Church admit it: for ſacrifice done to God with the cries of others is not acceptable.
                     If the couetous tell vs, that thogh they heape treaſures, it is not but at their death to diſtribute it vnto the poore, and to be brought honeſtly to the ground: I ſay that I commend this purpoſe, ſo his entent bee accordingly performed: but I am ſorry the couetous man ſhould thinke hereby to merite, and that hee ſhould thus diſcharge the wickedneſſe of his life, for the diſtribution of a little money after his death.
                     I would thinke it more ſure, that Princes &amp; great Lords ſhould ſpend their goods to marry poore maydens being Orphans in their life, then to commaund money to bee dealt after their death. For oft times the heyres or their executors, the body interred, doe little performe the will of the Teſtator: and much leſſe obſerue the Legacies bequeathed, though it be to the vtter vndoing of the poore Orphanes.
                     O what guerdon and commendation deſerueth he that iuſtly and truely diſchargeth the Legacies of the dead, and of the ſurplus (if any be) or with their owne, releeue the Orphanes, and marry the poore maydens, keeping them from the vices of the worlde. Suppoſe that a couetous man chanceth to traffique at Medine in Spaine, at Lions in France, at Lisbone in Portingall, at London in England, at Antwarpe in Flaunders, at Millaine in Lombardy, at Florence in Italy, at Palermo in Scicill, at Prage in Bohemie, and at Buda in Hungarie: Finally, vith his eyes he hath ſeene all Europe, and by traffique he hath knowledge of all Aſia. Admit now that in euery place he hath gotten goods, and that which he hath gotten, was not with whole conſcience, but acording to the companies, ſo hath the offences beene diuers.
                     In this caſe, if at the houre of death when the couetous man diuideth his money betweene the children, hee might alſo deuide his offences, ſo that he diſpoſſeſſing himſelfe of the goods, might thereby bee free from the offences, then it were well. But alas it is not ſo, for the wicked children liue triumphing on the earth with the goods, and the miſerable father goeth weeping to hell with his ſinnes.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXV. Of a letter which the Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote to his friend Cincinnatus, who beeing a Romane Knight became a marchant of Capua, wherein hee toucheth thoſe Gentlemē which take vpon them the trade of Marchanaize againſt their vocation. It is diuided into three Chapters,
                     
                     
                        
                           MArke the Emperour with his brother Annius Verus, felow in the Empire, wiſheth to thee Cincinnatus 
                        The Emperour ſheweth the abuſe of thoſe that leaue their calling. of Capua, health to thy perſon, and grace againſt thy euill fortune. From the feaſt of our mother Berecinthe, I haue ſeene neyther ſeruāt of thy houſe, nor read letter of thy hand, which maketh me ſuſpect greatly that thy health is in danger, or that thou miſtruſteſt our friendſhipp: for earneſt friendſhip requireth dayly

communication or viſitation: I pray thee be not ſo careleſſe from henceforth, and doe not forget vs in ſuch wiſe. I meane that thou wilt come and ſee vs, or at the leaſt that thou wilt write vnto vs often: for the letters of faithfull friends, though vtterly they doe not take from vs the deſire of the preſence: yet at the leaſt, they make vs hope for a meeting. I know that thou mayeſt anſwere mee, that in the Common wealth of Capua thou art ſo buſied, that it is impoſſible thou ſhouldeſt write vnto mee: hereto I anſwere thee.
                     That in no affayres thou canſt be ſo occupied, that it bee a lawfull let, not to communicate, or write vnto thy friend: For we may well call the time which wee liue, to bee well employed, which is ſpent in the ſeruice of God, and in the conuerſation of our friends.
                     All the reſidue that we waſte in talking, trauelling, ſleeping, eating &amp; reſting, wee ought not to write it in the booke of life, but in the Regiſter of death: For albeit that in ſuch ſē
                        blable works the body is refreſhed, yet therewith the heart cannot be comforted.
                     I ſweare vnto thee therefore my friend, that it is impoſſible that man take any contentation of any worldly thing, where the heart is not at reſt: for our comfort is not in the ſinewes or in the bones of the body, but in the liuely power of the ſoule, It is long ſithence that you and I haue knowne together, it is long time likewiſe that I loued thee, and thou me: and ſith wee are ſo true olde friends, it is but reaſon, that with good works wee doe renue our friendſhip. For falſly they vſurpe the name of friendſhippe, which are not conuerſant one with the other, no more then if they were ſtrangers. The man which ſpeaketh not to me, which writeth not to mee, which ſeeth me not, which viſiteth me not, which giueth me not, and to whome I giue not.
                     I would not hee were my enemy: but it little auaileth mee that hee cal mee friend, for particular friendſhip conſiſteth not in abundance, but that friends do open their harts, and talke with their perſons.
                     Peraduenture thou wilt ſay, that the great diſtance which is from Rome to that Country, hath been occaſion to diminiſh our friendſhippe: for the noble hearts are on fire with the preſence of that they loue, and haue great pain with the abſence of that they deſire.
                     I anſwere, that the farther the delicious wines are ſent, from the place where they grow, the greater ſtrength they haue. I meane, that herein true Wherein true friendſhip conſiſteth. friends are knowne, when their perſons are ſurtheſt ſeuered: for then are their wills moſt conioyned.
                     Tell mee I pray thee Cincinnatus, ſithence alwayes thou haſt found mee a diligent friend in thy ſeruice, why doeſt thou miſtruſt my faithfull good will? The greene leaues outwardly doe ſhew that the tree inwardly is not drie, I meane, that the good workes outwardly doe declare the feruentnes of the heart inwardly. If thou Cincinnatus preſumeſt to bee a true friend of thy friend, I will thou know this rule of friendſhip which is: where perfect loue is not, there wanteth alway faithfull ſeruice: and for the contrary he that perfectly loueth, aſſuredly ſhall be ſerued. I haue beene, am and will be thine, therfore thou ſhalt doe me great iniurie, if thou art not mine.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXVI. The Emperour proceedeth in his Letter, &amp; declareth what vertues men ought to vſe, and the vices which they ought to eſchew.
                     
                     
                        IN times paſt, I beeing yong and thou olde, I did ſuccour thee with money, The Emperour ſheweth what vertues men ought to vſe, and the vices they ought to eſchew. and thou me with good counſell: but now the world is otherwiſe changed, in that thy white hayres doe iudge thee to be old, and thy works doe cauſe thee to be yong: Therefore neceſſity compelleth mee, that we change our ſtile, which is: that I ſuccour thee with counſell, though thou giue me no money therefore: for I count thy couetouſneſſe to bee ſuch, that for all the good counſell, and Counſellours of Rome, thou wilt not vouchſafe to giue one quatrine of Capua.
                     
                     Now for the good that I wiſh thee, and for that which I owe to the Law of friendſhippe, I will preſently giue thee a counſell, whereby thou maieſt know what a good man ought to doe, to bee beloued of God, and feared and loued of men. If thou wilt quietly leade thy life in this miſerable World, retaine this well in memory which I write vnto thee,
                     Firſt, the good deeds thou haſt receyued of any, thoſe ſhalt thou remember: and the wrongs thou haſt ſuſtained, them ſhalt thou forget. Secondarily, eſteeme much thy owne little, and weigh not the much of an other. Thirdly, the company of the good alwaies couet, and the conuerſation of the euill dayly flye. Fourthly, to the great ſhew thy ſelfe graue, and to the ſmall more conuerſant. Fiftly, to thoſe which are preſent, do alwaies good works: and of thoſe that be abſent, alwaies ſpeake good words. Sixtly, weigh little the loſſe of fortune, and eſteeme much things of honour. The ſeuenth, to winne one thing, neuer aduenture thou manie: nor for many things doubtful do not aduenture any one thing certaine. Finally, and laſtly, I pray thee, and aduertiſe thee that thou haue no enemie, and that thou keepe but one friend. He which among the good, will bee counted for good, none of theſe things hee ought to want, I know well that thou wilt haue great pleaſure to ſee theſe my counſels well written: but I enſure thee, I ſhal haue greater pleaſure to ſee them in thy decdes well obſerued: For by writing to giue good counſell, it is eaſie: but by workes to follow the ſame, is maruellous hard.
                     My faithfull friendſhip to thee plighted, and thy great ability conſidered, cauſed mee alwayes for thee in Rome to procure honourable offices, and by my ſute thou haſt beene Edite, and Tribune, and maſter of the horſes, wherein thou behauedſt thy ſelfe with ſuch wiſedome, that all the Senate therefore yeelded mee moſt hearty thanks, I procuring them for thee, and thou for thy ſelfe winning ſuch perpetuall renowme. One thing of thee I vnderſtand, which with good will I would not haue knowne, and much leſſe that any ſuch thing by thee ſhould haue bin committed: that is to ſay; That thou leauing thy Office of Pretorſhip in the ware by Lande, haſt taken vpon thee the traffique of a Marchaunt by ſea: ſo that thoſe which in Rome knew thee a knight, doe ſee thee now in Capua, a Marchaunt. My pen indyting this my letter, for a time ſtood in ſuſpence for no other cauſe, but onely to ſee

what thing in thee firſt I might beſt blame: either the noble office which thou didſt forſake, or the vile and baſe eſtate which thou haſt choſen. And though thou be ſo much bereaued of thy ſences, yet call to minde thy auncient predeceſſours which died in the warres, onely to leaue theyr children, and nephews armed knights: and that thou preſently ſeekeſt to looſe thy libertie throgh thy couetouſnes, which they wan by their valiantnes. I thinke I am not deceyued, that if thy predeceſſors were reuiued, as they were ambicious of honour, ſo would they bee greedy to eate thee in morſels, ſinues, bones &amp; all. For the childrē which vniuſtly take honour from their Fathers, of reaſon ought to looſe their liues.
                     The Caſtles, Townes, houſes, mountaines, woods, beaſtes, Iewells, and ſiluer, which our predeceſſors haue left vs, in the end by long continuance do periſh: and that which cauſeth vs to haue perpetuall memorie of them, is, the good renowme of theyr life. And therefore if this bee true, it is a great ſhame for their parentes to haue ſuch children, in whome the renowme of their predeceſſours doth end. In the flouriſhing time of Cicero the Orator, when by his counſel the whole Common-wealth was gouerned, hee being then of power, both in knowledge, and of money: Saluſt ſaide vnto him in his Inuectiue, that hee was of baſe ſtocke: wherevnto hee aunſwered: Great cauſe haue I to render thankes vnto the Gods, that I am not as thou art, by whō thy high Linage is ended: A worthy ſaying of Cicero. but my poore ſtocke by me doth now begin to riſe. It is great pittie to ſee, how many good, noble, and valiaunt men are dead: but it is more griefe to ſee preſently their children vicious &amp; vnthrifts. So that there remaineth as much memory of their infamy, as ther doth of the others honeſty. Thou makeſt me aſhamed, that thou haſt forſaken to conquere the enemyes as a Romane knight, and that thou arte become a marchant, as a poore Plebeian.
                     
                     Thou makeſt mee to muſe a little, my friende Cincinnatus, that thou wilt harme thy familiars, and ſuffer ſtraungers to liue in peace. Thou ſeekeſt to procure death to thoſe which giue vs life: and to deliuer from death, thoſe which take our life. To Rebells thou giueſt reſt, and to the peace-makers, thou giueſt anoyance. To thoſe which take from vs our owne thou wilt giue, and to thoſe which giueth vs of theirs, thou wilt take. Thou condemneſt the innocents, and the condemned, thou wilt deliuer. A defender of thy countrey thou wilt not bee, but a tyraunt of thy Common-wealth. To all theſe things aduentureth he, which leaueth weapons, and falleth to Marchandiſe. With my ſelf oft times I haue muſed, what occaſion ſhould mooue thee to forſake Chiualrie, wherein thou hadſt ſuch honour, and to take in hand marchaundiſe, where of followeth ſuch in famie? I ſay, that it is as much ſhame for thee to haue gone from the warres as it is honor for thoſe which are born to office in the common-wealth.
                     My friend Cincinnatus, my end tendeth not to condemne marchaundiſe nor marchaunts, nor to ſpeake euill of thoſe which trafficke, by the trade of buying and ſelling. For, as without the valiant knights, warres cannot bee atchieued: ſo likewiſe without the diligent marchants, the commonwealth cannot be maintained? I cannot imagine for what other cauſe thou ſhouldeſt forſake the warres, and trafficque marchandiſe, vnleſſe it were, becauſe thou now being old and wanteſt force to aſſault men openly in the ſtraytes: ſhouldſt with more eaſe ſitting in thy chayre, robbe ſecretly in the marketplace. O poore Cincinnatus, ſithens thou buieſt cheap &amp; ſelleſt deare, promiſeſt much, &amp; performeſt little: thou

buieſt by one meaſure, and ſelleſt by another, thou watcheſt that none deceyue thee, and playeſt therein as other marchants accuſtome. And to conclude, I ſweare, that the meaſure wherewith the Gods ſhall meaſure thy life, ſhall bee much iuſter then that of thy merites.
                     Thou haſt taken on thee an office, wherewith, the which they companions in many daies haue robbed, thou in one houre by deceit doſt get, and afterwards the time ſhall come, when all the goods which thou haſt gotten, both by truth, and falſhood, ſhall bee loſt, not onely in an houre which is long, but in a moment which is but ſhort. Whether wee giue much, we haue much, we may do much, or we liue much, yet in the end the gods are ſo iuſt, that all the euill we do cō
                        mit ſhall be puniſhed, and for all the good wee worke, we ſhall be rewarded, ſo that the Gods oftentimes permit, that one alone ſhall ſcourge many, and afterwards the long time puniſheth all.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXVII. The Emperour concludeth his letter, and perſwadeth his friend Cincinnatus to deſpiſe the vanities of the world, and ſheweth though a man bee neuer ſo wiſe, yet he ſhall haue need of another mans counſell.
                     
                     
                        IF I knew thy wiſedome eſteemed the world, and the vanities thereof, ſo The Emperour concludeth his letter, deſcribing the vanities of the world. much as the worlde doth poſſeſſe thee, and thy dayes, as by thy white hairs moſt manifeſtly doth appeare: I need not to take the pains to perſwade thee, nor thou ſhouldeſt bee annoied in hearing me: Notwithſtanding thou beeing at the gate of great care, reaſon would that ſome ſhould take the clapper to knocke threeat, with ſome good counſell: for though the raſor be ſharpe, it needeth ſometimes to be whet. I meane though mans vnderſtanding bee neuer ſo cleare, yet from time to time it needeth counſell.
                     Vertuous men oft times doe erre, not becauſe they would fall, but for that the things are ſo euill of diſgeſtion, that the vertue they haue, ſufficeth not to tell them what thing is neceſſary for their profit. For the which cauſe it is neceſſary, that his will bee brideled, his wit fyned, his opinion changed, his memory ſharpened, and aboue all, now and then, that hee forſake his owne aduiſe, and cleaue vnto the counſell of an other. Men which couet to make high, ſumptuous, faire and large buildings, haue great care that the foundation thereof bee ſurely layed: for where the foundations are not ſure, there the whole buildings are in great danger. The manners and conditions of this world, (that is to ſay) the proſperous eſtates whereupon the children of vanity are ſet, are founded of quicke-ſand: in that ſort, that bee they neuer ſo valiant, proſperous and mighty, a little blaſt of winde doth ſtirre them, a little heat of proſperity doth open thē, a ſhower of aduerſity doth wet thē, and vnawares death ſtriketh them all flat to the ground. Men ſeeing they cannot bee perpetuall, do procure to continue themſelues, in raiſing vp proud buildings, &amp; leauing to theyr children great eſtates: wherein I count them fooles, no leſſe then in things ſuperfluous: for admit the pillers be of gold, the beames of ſiluer, and that thoſe which ioyne them bee kings, &amp; thoſe which build them noble, &amp; in that mining they conſume a 1000. yeares before they can haue it

out of the ground, or that they can come to the bottomes: I ſweare vnto them, that they ſhall finde no ſtedy rocke, nor liuely mountain, where they may build their houſe ſure, nor to cauſe their memory to bee perpetuall.
                     The immortall Gods haue participated all things to the mortal men, immortality onely reſerued, &amp; therefore they are called immortall, for ſo much as they neuer dye, and wee others The frailety and ſtate of man deſcribed. are called mortall, becauſe dayly we vaniſh away. O my friēd Cincinnatus, men haue an end, &amp; thou thinkeſt the Gods neuer ought to ende. Now greene, now ripe, now rotten, fruit is ſeuered from this life, from the tree of the miſerable fleſh, and eſteem this as nothing, for ſo much as this is naturall. But oftentimes in the leafe or flower of youth, the froſt of ſome diſeaſe, or the perill of ſome miſhap doth take vs away: ſo that when wee thinke to be aliue in the morning, we we are dead in the night.
                     It is a tedious and long worke to weaue a cloth: yet whē in many daies it is wouen, in one moment it is cut. I meane, that it is much folly to ſee a man with what toyle hee enricheth himſelfe, and into what perill he putteth himſelf to win a ſtate of honour: and afterwards when wee thinke litle we ſee him periſh in his eſtate, leauing of him no memory. O my friend Cincinnatus, for the loue that is betweene vs, I deſire thee, and by the immortall Gods I do coniure thee, that thou giue no credit to the world which hath this condition, to hide much copper vnder little gold, vnder the colour of one truth, hee telleth vs a thouſand lyes, and with one ſhort pleaſure he mingleth tenne thouſand diſpleaſures. He beguileth thoſe to whom he pretendeth moſt loue, and procureth great damages to them, to whom he giueth moſt goods, hee recompenſeth them greatly which ſerue him in ieſt, and to thoſe which truly loue him, he giueth mockes for goods.
                     Finally, I ſay, that when wee ſleepe moſt ſure, he waketh vs with greateſt perill. Eyther thou knoweſt the world with his deceit, or not: if thou knoweſt him not, why doſt thou ſerue him, if thou doſt know him, why doſt thou follow him? Tell mee, I pray thee, wouldeſt not thou take the theefe for a foole, which would buy the rope, wherewith hee ſhould bee hanged, and the murtherer that would make the ſword wherewith hee ſhould bee beheaded, and the robber by the hieway, that would ſhew the well wherein hee ſhould be caſt? and the traytor that ſhould offer himſelfe in place for to be quartered? the rebel that ſhold diſcloſe himſelfe to be ſtoned? Then I ſwear vnto thee, that thou art much more a foole which knoweſt the world, and will follow it, and ſerue it.
                     One thing I will tell thee, which is ſuch, that thou neuer oughteſt to forget it, that is to ſay that we haue great need of faith, not to beleeue the vanities which we ſee, then to beleeue the great malice which with our eares we heare. I returne to aduiſe thee, to read and conſider this word which I haue ſpoken, for it is a ſentence of profound miſtery.
                     Doeſt thou thinke Cincinnatus, that Rich men haue little care to get great riches? I let thee know that the goods of this world are of ſuch condition, Cares that are incident to them that hoorde vp riches. that before the poore man doth locke vp in his cheſts an 100. crownes: hee feeleth a thouſand griefes and cares in his heart. Our predeceſſors haue ſeen it, we ſee it preſently, &amp; our ſucceſſors ſhall ſee it: that the money which wee haue gotten is in a certaine number: but the cares and trauels which it bringeth are infinit. We haue few painted

houſes, and few noble eſtates in Rome, that within a litle time haue not great cares in theyr hearts, cruell enmityes with their neighbours, much euill will of theyr heyres, diſordinate importunities of their frends, perilous malices of their Enemies, and aboue all in the Senate they haue innumerable proces: and oft times to locke vp a little good in their cheſts, they make tenne thouſand blots in their honour.
                     Oh how manie haue I knowne in Deceyuers neuer go vnpuniſhed, either in this life, or the other. 
                        Rome, to whom it hath chaunced, that all that they haue gotten in Rome, to leaue vnto their beſt beloued Childe: another heyre (with little care,) of whom they thought not, hath enioyed it.
                     There can bee nothing more iuſt, then that all thoſe which haue beguyled others with deceyte in their life, ſhould bee found deceyued in their vaine imaginations after theyr death.
                     Iniurious ſhould the Gods be, if in all the euils that the euill propound to doe, they ſhould giue them time and place to accompliſh the ſame. But, the gods are ſo iuſt and wiſe, that they diſſemble with the euill, to the ende they ſhould beginne, and follow the things according to theyr owne wills and fantaſies: and afterwardes at their beſt time, they cut off their liues, to leaue them in greater torment. The Gods ſhould bee very cruell, and to them it ſhould bee great griefe to ſuffer, that that which the euill haue gathred, to the preiudice of many good, they ſhold enioy in peace many yeres. Mee thinketh it great follie, to knowe that we are borne weeping and to ſee that wee dye ſighing: and yet for all this, wee dare liue laughing?
                     I would aske of the world and his worldlings, ſithens that we enter into the world weeping, and go out of the world ſighing: why wee ſhould liue laughing? For, the rule to meaſure all parts, ought to be equall.
                     Oh Cincinnatus, who hath beguyled thee? to the ende that for one bottle of water of the Sea of this worlde for thy pleaſure, thou wilt bliſter thy hand with the rope of cares, and bruſe thy bodie in the anckor of troubles: and aboue all to aduenture thine own honour, for a glaſſe of water of another man.
                     By the faith of a good man, I ſweare vnto thee, that for all that great quantitie of Water thou draweſt, for that great deale of money thou haſt, thou remaineſt as much deade for thyrſte, drinking of that water, as when thou wert without water in the cup.
                     Conſider nowe thy yeares, if my counſell thou wilt accept, thou ſhalt demaund death of the Gods, to reſt thee as a vertuous man: and not riches A good counſell to reframe frō couetouſnes. to liue as a Foole.
                     With the teares of mine eyes I haue bewayled manie in Rome, when I ſaw them depart out of this worlde: and thee I haue bewayled, and do bewaile (my friend Cincinnatus) with drops of bloud, to ſee the return into the world The credite thou hadſt in the Senate, the bloud of thy predeceſſours, my Friendſhip, the authoritie of thy perſon, the honour of thy parentage: the ſlaunder of thy Common-wealth, ought to withdraw thee from ſo great couetouſneſſe.
                     Oh poore Cincinnatus, conſider the white honored haires which doe fall, ought to be occupied in the noble armies: ſithens thou art noble of bloud, valiant in perſon, auncient of yeares, and not euill willed in the Commonwealth. For, thou oughteſt to conſider, that more worth is reaſon, for the pathway of men which are good: then the common opinion, which is the large high way of the euill. For, if it be narow to go on the one ſide, there is no duſt wherewith the eyes be blinded, as in the other. I will giue thee a counſell, and if thou feeleſt thy ſelfe euill,

neuer count thou mee for friend. Luſt no more after the greaſie fatte of temporal goods, ſince thou haſt ſhort life: For wee ſee daily manie, before they come to thy age dye, but wee ſee fewe after thy age liue.
                     After this counſell I will giue thee an aduiſe, that thou neuer truſt preſent proſperitie: For, then alway thou art in daunger of ſome euill Fortune: If thou art mounted into ſuch pricking thornes as a foole: me thinketh thou oughteſt to diſcend as a Sage. And in this ſort all will ſay amongſt the people, that Cincinnatus is deſcended, but not fallen. My Letter I will conclude, and the concluſion thereof ſee well thou note, that is to ſay: That thou and thy Trade ſhall bee curſed: where you other merchaunts will liue poore, to dye rich. Once againe I returne to curſe you, for the couetouſnes of an euill man is alwayes accompliſhed, Couetouſnes alwayes accurſed. to the preiudice of manie good.
                     My wife Fauſtine doeth ſalute thee, and ſhe was not a litle troubled when ſhe knew thou wert a Marchaunt, and that thou keepeſt a ſhop in Capua. I ſend thee a Horſe to ride vppon, and one of the moſt richeſt Arras of Trypolie, to hang thy houſe withall, a precious ring, and a a pommel of a ſword of Alexandrie: And all theſe things I do not ſend thee, for that I know thou haſt neede thereof: but rather not to forget the good cuſtome I haue to giue. Pamphile thy aunt and my neighbour is dead, and I can tell thee, that in Rome dyed not a woman of a long time, which of her left ſuch renowme: for ſo much as ſhe forgot all enmities: ſhee ſuccoured the poore, ſhe viſited the baniſhed, ſhe entertained friends, and alſo I hearde ſay, that ſhee alone did light all the temples. Preſcilla thy couſin hath the health of body, thogh for the death of her mother her heart is heauie. And without doubt ſhe hath reaſon: for the onely ſorrowes which the Mothers ſuffer to bring vs forth, though with drops of bloud we ſhold bewaile them, yet wee cannot recompence them. The Gods be in thy cuſtodie and preſerue mee, with my wife Fauſtine, from all euill Fortune.

                     CHAP. XXVIII. ¶ The Authour perſwadeth Princes and great Lordes to flye couetouſnes and Auarice, and to become bountifull and liberall, which vertue is euer pertinent to the royall perſon, &amp;c.
                     
                     
                        
                           PIſiſtratus, the renowmed Tyrant among the Athenians, ſince his friends coulde not endure the cruelties that he committed, eache one returned to his owne houſe, and vtterly forſook him. The which when the Tyraunt ſaw, hee layd all his treaſure and Garments on a heape together, and went to viſite his friends, to whome with bitter teares hee ſpake A ſaying of Piſiſtratus. the Tyrant. theſe word. All my Apparell and money here I bring you, with determination, that if you will vſe my company, we will go all to my houſe, and if you will not come into my company, I am determined to dwell in yours. For, if you bee weary to follow mee, I haue great deſire to ſerue you: ſithens you know that they cannot be called faithfull Friendes, where the one cannot beare with the other,
                     
                        Plutarchus in his Apothegmes ſaith: that this Tyraunt Piſiſtratus was verie rich, and extreame couetous: ſo that they write of him, that the golde and

ſiluer which once came into his poſſeſſion, neuer man ſaw it afterwards: but if hee had neceſſitie to buy anie thing, if they would not preſent it vnto him willinglie, hee would haue it by force.
                     When he was dead, the Athenians determined to weigh him and his treaſure: the caſe was maruellous, that the gold and ſiluer hee had weied more then his dead body ſixe times. At that time in Athens there was a Philoſopher called Lido, of whom the Athenians demaunded, what they ſhould doe with the treaſure The opiniō of the Philoſopher Lido, concerning a couetous man. and dead body? Mee thinketh (qd, this Philoſopher) That if thoſe which are liuing, did know any ſiluer or gold which the tyrant tooke from them, it ſhould bee reſtored againe immediately: and doe not maruell hereat, that I doe not require it to bee put in the common treaſure: For God will not permit that the Common wealth bee enriched with the theft of tyrants: but with the ſwet of the Inhabitants. If any goods remaine which doe not appeare from whom they haue beene taken, me thinketh that they ought to bee diſtributed among the poore: for nothing can bee more iuſt then that which the goods wherewith the tirant hath empoueriſhed many, with the ſelfe ſame wee ſhould enrich ſome.
                     
                     As touching his buriall, me thinketh hee ought to bee caſt out to the fowles to bee eaten, and to the dogs to be gnawne.
                     And let no man thinke this ſentence to bee cruell: for we are bound to do no more for him at his death, then hee did for himſelfe in his life, who being ſo ouercome with auarice that he would neuer disburſe ſo much money, as ſhould buy him ſeuen foot of earth wherein his graue ſhould bee made, And will you know, that the Gods haue done a great good to all Greece to take life from this tirant: Firſt, it is good, becauſe much goods are diſperſed, which heretofore lay hid, and ſerued to no purpoſe.
                     Secondly, that many tongues ſhal reſt: for the treaſures of this Tirant, made great want in the Commonwealth, and our tongues the greateſt part of the day were occupied, to ſpeake euill of his perſon.
                     Me thinketh this Philoſopher hath touched two things, which the couetous man doth in the cōmon-welth, that is to ſay, that drawing much golde and ſiluer to the hidden Treaſure, hee robbeth the marchandize wherewith the people doe liue: The other damage is, that as hee is hated of all, ſo he cauſeth rancour and malice in the hearts of all: for he maketh the rich to murmur, and the poore to blaſpheme.
                     One thing I reade of in the lawes of the Lumbardes, worthy (of truth) to A cuſtome among the Lumbards, worthy to be noted and followed. bee noted and knowne, and no leſſe to be followed, which is, that all thoſe which ſhould haue gold, ſiluer, money, ſilkes, and clothes, euery yeare they ſhould bee regiſtred in the place of iuſtice. And this was, to the ende, not to conſent, nor permit them to heap much, but that they ſhould haue to buy, ſell, and traffique, wherby the goods were occupied among the people: ſo that he which did ſpēd the money to the profit of his houſe, it was taken for good of the commonwealth. If Chriſtians would do that which the Lūbards did, there ſhould not be ſo many couetous men in the common wealth: for nothing can bee more vniuſt, then one rich man heape vp that which wold ſuffice 10000. to liue with all: we cannot deny, but that curſed auarice to al ſorts of men, is as preiudicial, as the moth which eateth all garments. Therefore ſpeaking the truth, there is no houſe that it doth not defile: for it is more perillous to haue a clod of earth fall into a mans eye, then a beame vpon his foote.
                     
                        
                        Ageſilaus the renowmed king of the Lacedemonians, beeing asked of a man of Thebes, what word was moſt odible to be ſpoken to a King: and what word was that that could honor him moſt? hee aunſwered. The Prince with nothing ſo much ought to bee annoyed, as to ſay vnto him that hee is rich, and of nothing hee ought ſo much to reioyce, as to be called poore. For, the glory of the good Prince conſiſteth not in that hee hath great treaſures: but in that hee hath giuen great recompences.
                     This word without doubt, of all the world was one of the moſt royalleſt and worthyeſt to be committed vnto me morie, Alexander, Pyrrhus, Nicanor, Ptholomeius, Pompeius, Iulius Caeſar, Scipto, Hanniball, Marcus Porlius, Auguſtus, Cato, Traian, Theodoſe, Marcus Aurelius: &amp;c. All theſe Princes haue bin very valiaunt and vertuous: but adding hereunto alſo, the Writers which had written the deeds that they did in their liues, haue mentioned alſo the pouertie which they had at their death. So that they are no leſſe exalted, for the riches they haue ſpent, then for the proweſſes they haue done.
                     Admit that men of meane eſtate be auaritious, and Princes &amp; great Lords Couetouſnes in great perſonages, a greater blemiſh thē in the poore alſo couetous: the fault of the one is not equall with the vice of the other, though in the ende all are culpable: For if the poore man keepe, it is for that hee would not want, but if the knight hoord, it is becauſe he hath too much. And in this caſe I would ſay, that curſed bee the Knight which trauelleth, to the end that goods abound, and doth not care that betweene two bowes his renowm fall to the ground.
                     Sithens Princes and great Lordes will that men doe count them Noble, vertuous, and valiaunt, I would fayne know what occaſion they haue to be niggards and hard?
                     If they ſay, that that which they keepe is to eate, herein there is no reaſon: for in the end, where the rich eateth leaſt at his table, there are many that had rather haue that which remaineth, then that which they prouide to eate in their houſes.
                     If they ſay that that which they keepe is to apparrell them, herein alſo they haue as little reaſon: for the greatnes of Lordes conſiſteth not in that they ſhould bee ſumptuouſly apparrelled, but that they prouide that their ſeruants goe not rent not torne. If they ſay it is to haue in their chambers precious iewels, in their hals rich Tapeſtry, as little would I admit this anſwere: for all thoſe which enter into Princes Pallaces, doe behold more if thoſe that haunt their chambers bee vertuous, then that the Tapeſtries be rich.
                     If they ſay it is to compaſſe their Cities with walles, or to make fortreſſes on their frontiers: ſo likewiſe is this anſwere among the others very cold.
                     For good Princes ought not to trauell, but to be well willed, and if in The ſafetie of Princes conſiſts in the loue of his ſubiects. their realms they be welbeloued, in the world they can haue no walles ſo ſtrong, as in the hearts of their Subiects. If they tell vs that that they keepe is to marry their children, as little reaſon is that, for ſithence Princes and great Lords haue great inheritances, they need not heape much: For if their children bee good, they ſhall encreaſe that ſhall be left them: and if by miſhappe they be euill, they ſhall as well loſe that which ſhall bee giuen them.
                     If they ſay vnto vs that which they heape is for the wartes in like manner, that is no iuſt excuſe: For if ſuch warre bee not iuſt, the Prince ought not to take it in hand, nor the people thereunto to condiſcend: but if it be iuſt, the common-wealth then and not the Prince ſhall beare the

charges thereof. For in iuſt warres, it is not ſufficient that they giue vnto the Prince all their goods, but alſo they muſt themſelues in perſon hazzard theyr liues.
                     If they tell vs that they keepe it to giue and diſpoſe for theyr ſoules, at their dying day: I ſay it is not onely for want of wiſedome, but extreame ſollie. For, at the houre of death princes ought more to reioyce, for that they haue giuen, then for that at that time they giue.
                     Oh how Princes and great Lordes are euill counſelled, ſince they ſuffer themſelues to be ſlaundered for being couetous, onely to heape a little curſed treaſure. For experience teacheth vs, no man can be couetous of goods, but needs he muſt be prodigall of honour, and abandon libertie.
                     
                        Plutarche, in the Booke which hee made of the fortunes of Alexander, ſaith: That Alexander the great had a priuate ſeruant, called Perdicas: the which ſeeing that Alexander liberally 
                        A Queſtion lemau ded of great Alaxander, &amp; his anſwere. 
                        gaue all that which by great trauell hee attained: on a day he ſaid vnto him: Tell mee, moſt Noble Prince, ſithens thou giueſt all that thou haſt vnto others, what wilt thou haue for thy ſelfe?
                     
                     Alexander anſwered. The glorie remaineth vnto mee, of that I haue wonne and gotten: and the hope of that which I will giue and winne.
                     
                     And further he ſaid vnto him, I will tell thee Perdicas: If I knew that men thought, that all that which I take were for couetouſnes, I ſweare vnto thee by the God Mars, that I would not beate downe one corner in a Towne: and to winne all the world, I would not go one dayes iourney. My intention is, to take the glorie vnto my ſelfe, and to diuide the goods amongſt others.
                     
                     Theſe words ſo high, were worthy of a valiant and vertuous Prince, as of Alexander which ſpake them.
                     If that which I haue read in books doe not beguile mee, and that which with theſe eyes I haue ſeen: to become rich, it is neceſſarie that a man giue: For that Princes and great lords, who naturally are giuen to bee liberall, are alwayes fortunate to haue.
                     It chaunceth oft times, that ſome man giuing a little, is counted liberal, and another giuing much, is counted a niggard: the which proceedeth of this, that they know not, that liberalitie and niggardneſſe conſiſteth not in giuing much or little: but to knowe well how to giue. For, the rewardes and recompences, which out of time are diſtributed, doe neyther profite them which receyue them, neyther agree to him which giueth them. A couetous man giueth more at one time, then a noble and free heart doeth in twentie: thus ſaith the prouerbe, It is 
                        An olde prouerbe. 
                        good comming to a niggardes feaſt.
                     
                     The difference betweene the liberality of the one, and the miſery of the other is, that the noble and vertuous doth giue that he giueth to many: but the niggard giueth that hee giueth, to one onely.
                     Of the which vnaduiſement, princes ought carefully to beware. For if in ſuch caſe one man alone ſhould be found, which would commende his liberality, there are ten thouſand which would condemne his couetouſnes.
                     It happeneth ofte times to princes and great Lordes, that indeede they are free to recompence, but in giuing, they are very vnfortunate. And the cauſe is, that they giue it not to vertuous perſons and wel conditioned, but to thoſe which are vnthankefull, and doe not acknowledge the benefite receyued.
                     So that in giuing to ſome, they they haue not made them their friēds, and in not giuing vnto others, they haue made them their Enemyes.
                     It ſufficeth not vnto Princes and great Lordes, to haue a great deſire to

giue, but to know, when, how, or where, and to whom they ought to giue: For if they bee accuſed, otherwiſe to heape vp treaſures, they ought alſo to be condemned for that they doe giue.
                     When a man hath loſt all that he hath in play, in Whores, in Banquets, and other ſemblable vices: It is but reaſon they bee aſhamed: but when they haue ſpent it, like noble, ſtout, and liberall men, they ought not to bee diſcontented; for the wiſe man ought to take no diſpleaſure for that he loſeth, but for that hee euill ſpendeth: and hee ought to take no pleaſure for that hee giueth, but for that he giueth not well.
                     
                        Dion the Grecian in the life of the Emperour Seuerus ſayth, That one day in the Feaſt of the God Ianus, when hee had giuen diuers rewardes and ſundry gifts, as well to his owne ſeruants, as to ſtr

                     CHAP. XXIX. The Author followeth his intention, and perſwadeth Gentlemen and thoſe that profeſſe Armes, not to abaſe themſelues for gaines ſake, to take vpon them any vile function or office.
                     
                     
                        
                           PLutarch in his Apothegmes ſayeth, that King Ptolomeus the firſt, was a The prayſe of King Ptolomeus. Prince of ſo good a nature, and ſo gentle in conuerſation, that oft times he went to ſupper to the houſes of his familiar friendes, and many nights he remayned there to ſleepe. And truely in this caſe hee ſhewed himſelfe to be welbeloued of his: For ſpeaking according to the truth, a Prince on whoſe life dependeth the whole ſtate of the Commōwealth, ought to credite few at the Table, and alſo fewer in the bed. Another thing this Ptolomeus did, which was, when he inuited his friendes to dinner or ſupper, or other ſtrangers, of ſome he deſired to borrow ſtools, of others napkins, and of others cups: and ſo of other things, for hee was a prodigall Prince: For all that his ſeruants in the morning had bought, before the night following he gaue it away.
                     One day all the Nobles of his Realme of Egypt aſſembled together, and deſired him very earneſtly, that hee would bee more moderate in giuing: for they ſayd, through his prodigality, the whole Realme was empoueriſhed. The king anſwered: You others of Egypt are maruellouſly deceiued, that the poore and needy prince is troubled. In this I dare ſay

vnto you, that the poore and needie Prince ought to thinke himſelfe happie: For good Princes ought more to ſeeke to enrich others, then to heape vp Treaſures for themſelues.
                     
                     Oh happie is the Common-wealth which deſerueth to haue ſuch a prince, and happy is that tongue, which could pronounce ſuch a ſentence. Certainly A wiſe ſaying of King Ptolomeus. this Prince to all princes gaue good example and counſell, (That is to ſay) that for them it was more honor, and alſo more profite, to make others rich, then to be rich themſelues. For if they haue much, they ſhal want no crauers, and if they haue little, they ſhall neuer want ſeruants to ſerue them.
                     
                        Suetonius Tranquillus in the booke of Caeſars, ſayth: that Titus the Emperour one night after ſupper, from the bottome of his heart fetched a heauie ſighe: and hee being demaunded of thoſe which were at his table, why hee ſighed ſo ſore? hee aunſwered. Wee haue loſt at this day my Friendes. By the which wordes the Emperour meant, that he counted not that day amongſt A worthy ſaying of Titus the Emperour. thoſe of his life: wherin he had giuen no reward nor gift.
                     Truly this Noble Prince was both valiaunt and mightie, ſince hee ſighed and had diſpleaſure, not, for that which in many dayes hee had giuen, but becauſe that one day he had failed to giue any thing.
                     
                        Pelopa of Thebes, was a man in his time, very valiaunt, and alſo Rich, and ſith hee was fortunate in getting, and liberall in ſpending: one asked him, why hee was ſo prodigall to giue? he aunſwered. If to thee it ſeemeth that I giue much, to mee it ſeemeth yet I ſhould giue more: ſithens the goods ought to ſerue me, and not I to honor them. Therefore, I will that they call mee the ſpender of the goods, and not the ſtewardes of the houſe.
                     
                        Plutarche in his Apothegmes, ſaith: that K. Darius flouting at K. Alexander, for beeing poore, ſent to know where his Treaſures were for ſuch great Armyes? To whom Alexander the great aunſwered.
                     
                        Tell King Darius, that hee keepeth in his coffers, his treaſours of mettall: and that I haue no other Treaſours, then the hearts of my Friendes. And further tell A worthy ſaying of great Alex: to king Darius. him, that one man alone can robbe all his treaſors: but he and all the world can not take my Treaſures from mee, which are my Friendes. I durſt ſay, affirming that Alexander ſaide: That hee cannot bee called poore, which is rich of Friends. For, we ſay by experience, Alexander with his Friendes, tooke king Darius treaſures from him: and king Darius with all his treaſures, was not puiſſant enough to take Alexanders friendes from him.
                     Thoſe which of theyr naturall inclination are ſhamefaſt, and in eſtate Noble, they ought aboue all things to flye the ſlaunder of couetouſnes: For, without doubt greater is that honour which is loſt, then the goods that are gotten.
                     If Princes and great Lordes, of their owne naturall inclination be liberall, let them followe their nature: but if perchaunce of their own nature they are enclyned to couetouſnes: let them enforce their will. And if they will not doe it, I tell them which are preſent, that a day ſhall come, when they ſhall repent. For, it is a generall rule, that the diſordinate couetouſnes, doe raiſe againſt themſelues all venemous tongues. Thinke that when you watch to take mens goods, that others watch in like manner to take your honor. I doe not thinke that your life can be ſure: For, there is no law that doeth ordaine, nor pacience that can ſuffer, to ſee my neighbour liue in quiet by the ſweat of my browes.
                     A poore man eſteemeth as much a cloake, as the rich man doeth his delicious life: Therefore it is a good

conſequent, that if the Rich man take the gowne from the poore, the poore man ought to take the life frō the rich.
                     
                        Phocion amongſt the Greekes was greatly renowmed: and this, not ſo much for that hee was ſage, as for that hee did deſpiſe all worldly riches: vnto whome, when Alexander the great (king of Macedonte,) had ſent him an hundred markes of ſiluer, he ſaid vnto thoſe that brought it: Why doth Alexander ſende this Money vnto me, rather 
                        A worthy ſaying of Phocion, the phyloſopher. 
                        then to other Phyloſophers of Greece? They aunſwered him: Hee doth ſend it vnto thee, for that thou art the leaſt couetous, and moſt vertuous.
                     
                     Then aunſwered this Phyloſopher, Tell Alexander, that though he knoweth not what belongeth vnto a Prince, yet I knowe well what pertayneth to a Phyloſopher. For, the eſtate and office of Phyloſophers is, to deſpiſe the treaſurs of Princes: and the office of Princes, is to aske counſell of Phyloſophers.
                     
                     And further Phocion ſaid: You ſhall ſay alſo to Alexander, That in that hee hath ſent mee, hee hath not ſhewed himſelfe a pittyfull Friend, but a cruell Enemie: for eſteeming mee an honeſt man (ſuch as hee thought I was) he ſhould haue holpen me to haue been ſuch.
                     
                     Theſe wordes were worthie of a wiſe man. It is great pittie, to ſee valiaunt and Noble men to be defamed of couetouſnes, and onely for to get a fewe goods, hee abaſeth himſelfe to vile offices: which appertaine rather to meane perſons, then to noble men and valiaunt knights. Whereof inſueth, that they liue infamed, and all their friēds ſlandered. Declaring further I ſay, that it ſeemeth great lightnes, that a knight ſhould leaue the honorable eſtate of chiualrie, to exerciſe the handycrafte of Husbandrie: and that the Horſes ſhould bee chaunged into Oxen, the ſpeares to mattockes, and the weapons into ploughes: Finally, they doe deſire to toyle in the fields, and refuſe to fight in the Frontiers.
                     Oh, how much ſome Knightes of our time haue degenerated, from that their fathers haue bin in times paſt: for their predeceſſors did aduance themſelues of the Infidells, which in the the fields they ſlew, and their children brag of their Corne and Sheepe they haue in their grounds,
                     Our auncient knights were not wont to ſigh, but when they ſaw themſelues in great diſtreſſe, and their ſucceſſors weepe nowe, for that it rayned not in the moneth of May. Their Fathers did ſtriue which of them could furniſh moſt men, haue moſte weapons, and Great difference betweene the anciēt warriours, &amp; theſe of our times. keepe moſt horſes: but their children now a dayes contend, who hath the fineſt witte, who can heape vp greateſt treaſours, and who can keepe moſt ſheepe.
                     The Auncients ſtriued who ſhould keepe moſt men: but theſe worldlings at this day ſtriue, who can haue greateſt reuenues. Wherefore I ſay, ſince the one doeth deſire as much to haue great Rents, as the others did delight to haue many weapons: It is as thogh Fathers ſhould take the Sword by the pomell, and the children by the ſcabberd All the good arts are peruerted, and the arte of Chiualrie aboue all others is deſpiſed: And not without cauſe, I called it an art: for the ancient philoſophers cōſumed a great time to write the lawes that the knights ought to keepe. And as now the order of the the Carthaginiās ſeemeth to bee moſt ſtreight, ſo in times paſt, the order of Knighthood was the ſtreighteſt. To whom I ſweare, that if they obſerued the order of chiualry, as good &amp; gentle Knights: there remained no time vacant for them in life to bee vitious, nor wee ſhould accuſe them at theyr death as euil chriſtians. The true and not fayned Knight, ought not to bee prowde, malicious, furious, a glutton,

coward, prodigall, niggard, a lyer, a blaſphemer, nor negligent. Finally, I ſay, that all thoſe ought not to bee iudged as Knights, which haue golden ſpurs, vnleſſe he hath therewith an honeſt life.
                     O if it pleaſed the King of Heauen, that Princes would now a daies examine as ſtraightly thoſe, which haue cure of ſoules, as the Romanes did thoſe which had but charge of armies. In old time they neuer dubbed any man Knight, vnleſſe hee were of noble bloud, proper of perſon, moderate in ſpeech, exerciſed in the war, An ancient cuſtome among the Romanes. couragious of heart, happy in armes, and honeſt in life: Finally, he ought of all to bee beloued for his vertue, and of none hated for his vice. The Knights in whom theſe vertues ſhined bright in Rome, had diuers liberties, that is to ſay, that they onely might weare rings, ride on horſebacke through the ſtreetes, they might haue a ſhield, ſhut the gates at dinner, they might drinke in cupps of ſiluer, ſpeake to the Senate, and make defyances, they might demand the enſigne, weare weapons, take the charge of Embaſſage, and ward at the gates of Rome

To the end he may be a good Chriſtian, hee ought to thinke vpon Ieſus crucified, &amp; to be a good knight, he ought alwayes to behold the armes of his ſhield, the which his Grandfather, or great Grandfather wanne.

                     CHAP. XXX. Of a Letter which the Emperour wrote to Mercurius his neighbour, a Marchant of Samia, wherein men may learne the daungers of thoſe which traffique by ſea and alſo ſee the couetouſneſſe of them that trauell by land.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArcus Aurelius Emperor of Rome, born in mount Celio, wiſheth to thee A Letter of the Emperour to Mercurius. 
                        Mercurius his ſpeciall friend, health, and conſolation in the Gods, the onely Comforters. It ſeemeth well, that we are friends, ſithens wee doe the works of charity: For I vnderſtanding here thy miſhap immediatly ſent a meſſenger to comfort thee, and in hearing my diſeaſe, thou ſendeſt a friend of thine to viſite me. Wherefore men may perceiue if thou haddeſt me in mind, I did not forget thee.
                     I vnderſtand that the meſſenger that went, and the other that came, met in Capua: the one carried my deſire for thee, and the other brought thy letter for me. And if as diligently thou haddeſt read mine, as I attentiuly haue heard thine: thou ſhouldeſt thereby plainely know, that my heart was as full of ſorrow, as thy ſpirite was full of paine. I was very glad, &amp; great thanks I yeeld thee, that thou ſendeſt to comfort me in my feuer tertian, &amp; thy viſitation came at the ſame houre that it left mee. But if the Goddes

did leaue this fact in my hands, euen as they thought it good to fixe the feuer in my bones: I would not leaue thee without comfort, nor giue place to the feuer to returne againe. Oh how great is our pride, and the miſery of mans life.
                     I ſpeake this becauſe I do preſume to take many Realmes from other, &amp; yet I haue not the power to plucke the feuer out of my owne bones. Tell mee I pray thee (Mercurius) what profite is it to vs to deſire much, to What profiteth it a man to couet much, ſince his day 
                              •
                           s are ſo ſhort. procure much, to attaine much, and to preſume much, ſince our dayes are ſo briefe, and our perſons ſo frayle? It is long time ſince we haue been bound together in friendſhipp, and many yeeres haue paſſed ſince we haue knowne the one the other: and the day that thy friendſhip truſted my faith, immediately my faith was bound, that thy euils ſhould be mine, and my goods thine: for as the diuine Plato ſayde, that onely is true friendſhip, where the bodies are 2. and the wils but one.
                     I count that ſuſpitious frendſhippe where the hearts are ſo diuided, as the wils are feuered: for there are diuers in Rome great friends in words, which dwell but x. houſe, a ſunder, &amp; haue their hearts ten thouſand miles diſtant.
                     When thou wentſt from Rome, and I came from Samia, thou knoweſt the agreement which we made in Capua, whereof I truſt thou wilt not deceiue me now, but that I am another, thou here, and that thou ſhouldeſt be another, I there: ſo that my abſence with thy preſence, and thy preſence with mine abſence bee alwayes together: By relation of thy meſſenger, I vnder ſtood that thou haſt loſt much goods but as by thy letter I was enformed, the anguiſh of thy perſon was much greater. As we vnderſtand here thou didſt ſend a ſhippe laden with marchandize to Greece, and the Mariners and Factors deſiring more to profite by their wiſedome, then to accompliſh thy couetouſneſſe: did caſt the marchandize into the ſea, and onely they trauelled to ſaue their perſons, In deede in ſo ſtraight and perillous a caſe, thou haſt no reaſon to accuſe them, nor yet they are bound to ſatiſfie thee: for no man can cōmit greater folly, then for the goods of others to hazard his owne proper life.
                     Pardon mee (Mercury) I pray thee for that I haue ſpoken, and alſo for that I will ſay, which is, that for ſo much as the Mariners and Factors were not thy children, nor thy Kinſemen, nor thy friends, ſo that thy marchandize might haue come to the hauen ſafe, thou haſt little paſſed, if they had all been drowned in the deepe gulfe of the ſea.
                     Further, I ſay, though I would not ſay it, and thou much leſſe heare it, that according to the litle care which you other couetous men haue, of the children and Factors of others, and according to the diſordinate loue which you haue to your proper goods: whereas thou weepeſt bitterly for the loſſe of thy goods, though thou hadſt ſeene all the Mariners drowned, thou wouldeſt not haue ſhedde one teare: For Romane marchants weepe rather for ten crownes loſt, which they cannot recouer, then for ten men dying, the which tenne crownes would haue ſaued.
                     Mee thinketh it is neyther iuſt nor honeſt, that thou doe that which they tell mee thou doeſt, to complain of thy Factors, and accuſe thy Mariners, onely to recouer of the poore men by land that which the fiſhe haue in their poſſeſſion in the ſea: For as thou knoweſt no man is bound to chaunge health, life nor the renowme of their perſons, for the recouery of goods. Alas

What pittie haue I on thee Mercurie? in that the ſhippe was loaden with thy marchandiſe: and the worſt of all is: that according to my vnderſtanding, and thy feeling, the Pyrates haue not caſte ſuch farthells into the Sea, as thoughts haue burdened and oppreſſed thy heart. I neuer ſaw man of ſuch condition as thou art, for that thou ſeeſt the ſhip, (vntill ſuch time) as they caſt the marchandiſe ouer the boord, could not ſayle ſafely: and yet thou doeſt lode thy ſelfe with riches, to goe to thy graue.
                     O grieuous and curſed riches, with the which neyther in the deepe Seas, neither yet in the maine land, our perſons are in ſafeguarde: Knowing thy property, I would rather bind my ſelfe to ſeeke thy Leade and tinne, then thy heart ſo wounded. For, in the ende, Riches neuer letteth man be in quiet. thy leade is together in ſome place in the bottome of the Sea: but thy couetouſneſſe is ſeattered through all the whole Earth.
                     If perhaps thou ſhouldſt dye, and the Surgions with the ſharpe raſours ſhould open thy ſtomacke, I ſweare vnto thee, by the Mother Berecynthia, (which is the mother of all the Gods of Rome) that they ſhould rather finde thy heart drowned with the lead, then in life with thy bodie. Now thou canſt not be ſicke of the Feuer tertain as I am, for the heat within thy body, and the pain in thy head, would cauſe thee to haue a double quartaine: and of ſuch diſeaſe thou canſt not bee healed on thy bed, but in the ſhip: not on land, but on the ſea: not with phiſitions, but with pirats. For the phyſitions would carry away the money, and the pirats would ſhew thee where thy leade fell.
                     Trouble not thy ſelfe ſo much Mercury, for though thou haſt not thy lead with thee in the land, it hath thee with it in the ſea, and thou oughtſt inough to comfort thy ſelfe: for whereas before thou hadſt it in thy coffers, thou haſt it preſently in thy intrailes. For, there thy life is drowned, where thy leade is caſt.
                     O Mercury, now thou knoweſt, that the day that thou didſt recommende thy goods to the vnknown rocks, and thy ſhippe to the raging Seas, and thy outragious Auarice vnto the furious windes, how much that thy factors went deſiring thy profit and gaine, ſo much the more thou mighteſt haue bin aſſured of thy loſſe.
                     If thou hadſt had this conſideration, and hadſt vſed this diligence, thy deſire had bin drowned, &amp; thy goods eſcaped. For, men that dare aduenture theyr goods on the Seas, they ought not to be heauy for that is loſt, but they ought to reioice for that that is eſcaped,
                     
                        Socrates, the auncient and great philoſopher, determined to teach vs, not by words, but by workes, in what eſtimation Socrates teacheth vs how to eſteeme the goods of this world. a man ought to haue the goods of this world: for he caſt into the Sea not lead, but golde, not little, but much, not of another mans, but of his owne, not by force, but willingly, not by fortune, but by wiſedome.
                     Finally, in this worthy fact, hee ſhewed ſo great courage, that no couetous man but would haue reioiced, to haue found ſo much on the land, as this phyloſopher did delight to haue caſt into the Sea. That which Socrates did was much, but greater ought we to eſteeme that he ſaid, which was this: Oh yee deceytfull goods, I will drowne you, rather then you ſhould drowne mee.
                     
                     Since Socrates feared, and drowned his owne proper goods, why doe not the couetousfeare to robbe the goods of other? This wiſe philoſopher wold not truſt the fine gold: and thou doeſt truſt the harde lead. Drawe you two lots, Socrates of Athens, and thou of Samia, ſee which of you two haue erred,

or done well: hee to carry gold from the land to the ſea, to bring golde to the land.
                     I am aſſured, that the auncient Romanes would ſay, that it is he: but the couetous of this preſent Worlde would ſay, that it is thou. That which in this caſe I thinke is, that thou in prayſing it, doſt diſprayſe thy ſelfe, and Socrates in diſprayſing it, of all is prayſed and eſteemed.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXI. The Emperour followeth his matter, &amp; concludeth his Letter, greatly reprouing his friend Mercurius for that hee tooke thought for the loſſe of his goods. Hee ſheweth him the nature of fortune, and deſcribeth the conditions of the couetous man.
                     
                     
                        THis meſſenger told mee, that thou art very ſad, that thou The concluſion of the Emperours letter, ſhewing the nature of couetous men. cryeſt out in the night, and importuneſt the Godds, wakeſt thy neighbours; and aboue all, that thou complayneſt of Fortune, which hath vſed thee ſo euill: I am ſorry for thy griefe: for griefe is a friend of ſolitude, enemy of company, a louer of darkeneſſe, ſtrange in conuerſation, and heyre of deſperation.
                     I am ſorry thou cryeſt in the night; for it is a ſign of folly, a token of ſmall patience, the point of no wiſe man, and a great proofe of ignorance: for at the houre when all the worlde is couered with darkeneſſe, thou alone doſt diſcouer thy hart with exclamations. I am ſorry that thou art vexed with the Gods, ſaying, that they are cruell: Forſomuch as if they haue taken any thing from thee for thy pride, they ſhould reſtore it againe for thy humility: for as much as we offend the Gods through the offence ſo much do wee appeaſe them with patience.
                     O my friend Mercurius, knoweſt thou not that the patience which the Gods haue in diſſembling our faults, is greater, then that which men haue in ſuffering their chaſtiſements? for wee others vniuſtly do offend them, and they iuſtly puniſh vs.
                     I am ſorry that with thy exclamations and complaints thou ſlaundereſt thy neighbours: for as thou knoweſt, one neighbour alwayes enuieth another, in eſpecially the poore the rich. And according to my counſell, thou ſhouldeſt diſſemble thy paine, and take all things in good part: for if perhaps thy riches haue cauſed thy ſorrow, thy patience will moue them to compaſſion. I am ſorry thou complaineſt of thy fortune: For Fortune (ſith ſhe is known of all) doth not ſuffer her ſelf to be defamed of one: and it is better to thinke with Fortune how thou mayeſt remedy it, then to thinke with what griefe for to complaine. For there are diuers men which to publiſh their paine are very carefull, but to ſeeke remedy, are as negligent.
                     O poore innocent Mercurius, after ſo long forgetfulneſſe, art thou more aduiſed to complain of fortune againe, and dareſt thou defie fortune, with whom all wee haue peace? Wee vnbend our bowes, and thou wilt charge thy launces: thou knoweſt not what warr meaneth, and yet thou wilt winne the victory: all are deceyued, and wilt thou alone goe ſafe? what wilt thou more I ſay vnto thee: ſince I ſee thee commit thy ſelfe vnto Fortune? Doeſt thou know, that it is ſhee that beateth downe the high walles, and defendeth the Towneditches?

Knoweſt thou not, that it is ſhee that peopleth the vnhabitable deſerts, and diſpeopleth the peopled Cities? Knoweſt thou not, that it is ſhee that of enemies maketh friends: and of friendes enemies? Knoweſt thou not, that it is ſhe that conquereth the Conquerours: Knoweſt thou not that it is ſhee that of traytors maketh faithfull, and of faithfull ſuſpitious. Finally, I will thou know, that Fortune is ſhee which turneth realmes, breaketh armies, abaſheth Kings, rayſeth Tyrants, giueth life to the dead, and burieth the liuing: doeſt thou not remember, that the ſecond King of the Lacedemonians had ouer his gates ſuch words:
                     
                        The Pallace here behold where men doe ſtriue,
                     
                     
                        By fruitleſſe toyle to conquere what they can, 
                        A ſuperſcriptio written ouer the gates of the King of Lacedemonia.
                     
                     
                        And fortune eke that Princes fancies rine,
                     
                     
                        By his vnbrideled will that alwayes wanne.
                     
                     Certainely theſe words were hie, and proceeded of a high vnderſtanding. And if in this caſe I may bee beleeued, they ought to be well noted of wiſe men, and not written before the gates, but imprinted within the hearts. Better knew he Fortune then thou, ſince hee tooke himſelfe for one diſinherited, and not as heire: and when hee loſt any thing as thou, hee knew that hee receyued it by loane, and not that it was his owne.
                     Men in this life are not ſo much deceyued for any thing, as for to thinke that the temporall goods ſhould remaine with them during life. Now that God doth ſuffer it, now that our wofull fortune doth deſerue it, I ſee no greater miſhapps fall vnto any, then vnto them which haue the greateſt eſtates and riches: ſo that truly wee may boldly ſay, that hee alone which is ſhut in the graue, is in ſafeguard from the vnconſtancie of fortune.
                     Thy meſſenger hath tolde mee further, that this ſommer thou preparedſt thy ſelfe to Rome, and now that it is Winter thou wilt ſayle to Alexandria. O thou vnhappy Mercurie, tell me I pray thee, how long it is, ſithence thou loſt thy ſences: for aſmuch as when this life doth end, thy auarice beginneth a new: thou foundeſt two Cities very meete for thy traffique, that is to ſay, Rome which is the ſcourge of all vertues, and Alexandria, 
                        The vices of Rome and Alexandria layd open. which is the chiefeſt for all vices. And if thou loueſt greatly thoſe two Cities, heare, I pray thee, what marchandize are ſolde therein. In Rome thou ſhalt loade thy body with vices, and in Alexandria thou ſhalt ſwell thy heart with cares.
                     By the faith of a good man I doe ſweare vnto thee, that if perchaunce thou buyeſt any thing of that which is heere, or ſelleſt ought of that thou bringeſt from thence: thou ſhalt haue greater hūger of that thou ſhalt leaue then contentation of that thou ſhalt bring. Thou doeſt not remember that wee are in Winter, and that thou muſt paſſe the ſea, in the which if the Pirates doe not deceiue mee, the ſureſt tranquility, is a ſigne of the greateſt torment. Thou mighteſt tell mee that thy ſhippes ſhould returne without fraught, and therefore they ſhall ſayle more ſurely. To this I aunſwere thee, that thou ſhalt ſend them more loden with couetouſnes, then they ſhall returne loden with ſilkes. O what a good change ſhould it bee, if the auarice of Italy could bee chaunged for the ſilke of Alexandria. I ſweare vnto thee, that in ſuch caſe thy ſilke wold fraught a ſhip &amp; our auarice wold lode a whole nauy

That couetouſnes is great, which the ſhame of the World dooth not oppreſſe: neyther the feare of death doth cauſe to ceaſe.
                     And this I ſay for thee, that ſithens in this daungerous time thou durſt ſayle, eyther wiſdome wanteth, or elſe auarice and couetouſneſſe ſurmounteth. To ſatisfie mee, and to excuſe thee with thoſe which ſpeake to me of thee, I cannot tell what to ſay vnto them, but that God hath forgotten thee, and the ſeas do know thee. I pray thee, what goeſt thou to ſeeke? ſince thou leaueſt the gouernement of thy houſe, and ſayleſt in Alexandrie? Peraduentur thou goeſt to the gulfe Arpin, where the mariners caſt in thy lead?
                     Take heede Mercury, and conſider well what thou doeſt, for peraduenture where as thou thinkeſt for to take from the fiſh the hard lead, thou maieſt leaue vnto them thy ſoft fleſh, I haue knowne many in Rome, which for to recouer one parte of that they haue loſt, haue loſt all that which was left vnto them. O my friende Mercury, note, note; Note well this laſt word, whereby thou ſhalt know, what it is that you couetous men doe What it is that couetous men doe long for in this life. gape for in this life? Thou ſeekeſt care for thy ſelfe, enuy for thy neighbours, ſpurs for ſtrangers, a baite for theeues, troubles for thy body, damnation for thy renowne, vnquietneſſe for thy life, annoiance for thy friends, and occaſion for thy enemies. Finally, thou ſercheſt maledictions for thy heyres, and long ſutes for thy children.
                     I cannot write any more vnto thee, becauſe the Feuer doth ſo vehemently vexe mee. I pray thee pray to the Gods of Samia for me: for medicines little profite, if the Gods bee angry with vs.
                     My wife Fauſtine ſaluteth thee, and ſhee ſayeth, that ſhee is ſorry for thy loſſe: ſhe ſendeth thee a rich iewell for Fabilla thy daughter, and I doe ſend thee a Commiſſion, to the end they ſhall giue thee a ſhip in recompence of thy leade.
                     If thou ſayleſt with it, come not by Rhodes; for we haue taken it from their Pirates. The Gods bee in thy cuſtody, and giue mee and Fauſtine a good life with ours, and a good name among ſtraungers: I doe not write vnto thee with mine owne hand, for that my ſickneſſe doth not permit it.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXII. That Princes and Noble men ought to conſider the miſery of mans Nature, and that brute beaſts are in ſom points (reaſon ſet apart) to bee preferred vnto men.
                     
                     
                        
                           MIdas the auncient King of Phrygia, was in his gouernment a cruell Tyrant, and contented not himſelfe to play the Tirant in his owne proper Countrey, but alſo maintained Rouers on the Sea, and theeues in the land to robbe ſtraungers,
                     This King Mydas was well known in the Realmes of the Orient, and in ſuch ſort, that a friend of his of Thebes ſayde vnto him theſe words. I let 
                        The tyranny of Mydas deſcribed. 
                        thee to know K. Mydas, that all thoſe of thy owne Realme doe hate thee, and all the other Realmes of Aſia doe feare thee: and not for this that thou canſt do much, but for the crafts and ſubtilties which thou vſeſt: By reaſon whereof all ſtrangers, and all thine owne haue made a vow to God neuer to laugh during the terme of thy life, nor yet to weepe after
                        
                        thy death.
                     
                     
                        Plutarch in the booke of Politiques ſayeth, that when this King Mydas was borne, the Ants brought corne into his cradell, and into his mouth: and when the nurſe wold haue taken it from him, hee ſhut his mouth, and would not ſuffer any perſon to take it from him. They beeing all amazed with this ſtrange ſight, demaunded the Oracle what this betokened: who aunſwered, That the childe ſhould The anſwere of the Oracle concerning the life of King Mydas. bee maruellous rich, and withall exceeding couetous: which the Antes did betoken in filling his mouth with corne And afterwards hee woulde not giue them one onely graine, and euen ſo it chaunced, that King Mydas was exceeding rich, and alſo very couetous: for hee would neuer giue any thing, but that which by force was taken from him, or by ſubtiltie robbed.
                     In the Schooles of Athens at that time nouriſhed a Philoſopher called Sylenus, who in letters and pureneſſe of life was highly renowned. And as King Mydas was knowne of many, to haue great treaſures: ſo this Philoſopher Silenus was no leſſe noted for deſpiſing them.
                     This Philoſopher Silenus trauelling by the borders of Phrygia, was taken by the theeues which robbed the Country, and being brought before King Mydas, the King ſayd vnto him: Thou art a Philoſopher, and I am a King, thou art my priſoner, &amp; I am thy Lord: I will that immediately thou tell mee, what ranſome thou canſt giue mee to redeeme thy perſon: for I let thee to know, that I am not contented any Philoſopher ſhould periſh in my Country, becauſe you other Philoſophers ſay, that you will willingly renounce the goods of the World, ſince you cannot haue it.
                     The Philoſopher Silenus anſwered him, Mee thinketh (King Mydas) that thou canſt better execute tyranny then to talke of Philoſophy, for we make no account that our bodies bee taken, but that our willes bee at liberty.
                     Thy demaund is very ſimple, to demaund ranſome of me for my perſon, Conference betweene Mydas and the Philoſopher Silenus. whether thou takeſt mee for a Philoſopher or no. If I bee not a Philoſopher, what moueth thee to feare to keepe me in thy Realme: for ſooner ſhouldeſt thou make mee a Tyrant, then I thee a Phyloſopher. If thou 
                           •
                        akſtſt mee for a Philoſopher, why doeſt thou demaund money of mee: ſince thou knoweſt I am a philoſopher, I am a Crafts man, I am a Poet, and alſo a Muſitian: ſo that the time that thou in heaping vp riches haſt conſumed, the ſelfe ſame time haue I in learning ſpent. Of a Philoſopher to demaund either gold or ſiluer for ranſome of his perſon, is eyther a word in mockerie, or elſe an inuention of tyranny: For ſithence I was borne in the World, riches neuer came into my hands, nor after them hath my heart luſted. If thou (King Mydas) wouldeſt giue mee audience, and in the faith of a prince beleeue mee, I would tell thee what is the greateſt thing, and next vnto that the ſecond, that the Gods may giue in this life, and it may bee, that it ſhall bee ſo pleaſant vnto thee to heare, and ſo profitable for thy life, that thou wilt plucke mee from my enemies, and I may diſſwade thee from tirannies.
                     When King Mydas heard theſe words, hee gaue him licence to ſay theſe two things ſwearing vnto him to heare him with as much patience, as was poſſible.
                     The Philoſopher Silenus hauing licence to ſpeake freely, taking an inſtrument in his hands, began to play and ſing in this wiſe:
                     
                        
                        The Senate of the Gods when they forethought

                        The chiefeſt gift the heauenly powers had wrought,
                        Had beene to ſowe his ſeede in barren place.
                     
                     
                        But when by ſteppes of ſuch diuine conſtraint,
                        They forced man perforce to fixe his line,
                        The higheſt good to helpe his booteleſſe plaint
                        Had beene to ſlyp, his race of ſlender twine.
                     
                     
                        
                           For then the tender babes both wante to know
                        
                        
                           The deere delight that life doth after hale,
                        
                        
                           And eke the dread, that griſly death doth ſhew,
                        
                        
                           Ere Charons bote, to Stigian ſhore doth ſayle.
                        
                     
                     THeſe two things the Philoſopher proued with ſo high and naturall reaſons, that it was a maruellous matter to ſee with what vehemency Sylenas the Philoſopher ſang them, and with what bitterneſſe Mydas the Tyrant wept.
                     Without doubt the ſentences were maruelous profound, which the Philoſopher ſpake, and great reaſon had the king to eſteeme it ſo much: For if wee doe prepare our ſelues to conſider whereof wee are, and what we ſhall be, that is to ſay, That wee are of earth, and that we ſhall returne to earth: We would not ceaſe to weepe, nor ſigh.
                     
                     One of the greateſt vanities which I finde among the children of vanity is, that they employ themſelues to A worthy thing to bee conſidered of among Chriſtians. conſider the influences of the ſtarres the nature of the Planets, the motion of the heauens, and they will not cō
                        ſider themſelues, of which conſideration they ſhould take ſome profite.
                     For man giuing his mind to thinke on ſtrange things, commeth to forget his owne proper.
                     Oh if we would conſider the corruption whereof wee are made, the filth whereof wee are engendred, the infinit trauell wherewith we are born, the long tediouſnes wherewith we are nouriſhed, the great neceſſities, and ſuſpitions wherein wee liue, and aboue all, the perill wherein wee dye: I ſweare and affirme, that in ſuch conſideration wee finde a thouſand occaſions to wiſh death, and not one to deſire life.
                     The children of vanity are occupyed many yeares in the Schooles, to learne Rethorike, they exerciſe themſelues in Philoſophy, they heare Ariſtotle, they learne Homere without booke, they ſtudy Cicero, they are occupied in Xenophon, they hearken Titus Liuius, they forget not Aulus Gelius, and they know Ouid: yet for all this I ſay, that we cannot ſay, that the man knoweth little, which doth know himſelfe.
                     
                        Eſchines the Philoſopher ſayde well, that it is not the leaſt, but the chiefeſt part of Philoſophy to know A worthy ſaying of Eſchynes the Philoſopher. man, and wherefore he was made: for if man would deepely conſider what man is, he ſhould finde more things in him which would moue him for to humble himſelfe, then to ſtirre him to be proud, If we doe behold it without paſſion, and if we doe examine it with reaſon, I know not what there is in man.
                     O miſerable, and fraile nature of man, the which taken by it ſelfe, is little worth, and compared with an other thing is much leſſe: For man ſeeth in brute beaſtes many things, which hee doth enuy: and the beaſts doe ſee much more in men, whereon if they had reaſon, they would haue

compaſſion. The excellencie of the ſoule layde aſide, and the hope which we haue of eternall life, if man doe compare the captiuity of men to the liberty of beaſts, with reaſon we may ſee, that the beaſts doe liue a peaceable life, and that which men doe lead is but a long death. If we prepare our ſelues to conſider, from the time that both man and beaſt come into this world, vntill ſuch time as they both dye, and in how many thinges the beaſts are better then men: with reaſon we may ſay, that nature like a pittifull mother hath ſhewed her ſelfe to beaſts, and that ſhe doth handle vs an vniuſt ſtepmother.
                     Let vs beginne therefore to declare more particularly the originall of the one, and the beginning of the other, and wee ſhall ſee how much better the brute beaſts are endowed, and how the miſerable men are diſinherited.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXIII. The Author followeth his purpoſe, and excellently compareth the miſery of men, with the liberty of beaſts.
                     
                     
                        WE ought deeply to conſider, that no wilde nor tame beaſt is ſo long before hee come to his ſhape, as the miſerable man is: who with corruption of bloud and vile matter is nine moneths hid in the wombe of his mother. Wee ſee the Beaſts more prouicent in their kinde then man. beaſt when ſhee is great (if neede require) doth labour all exerciſes of husbandrie: ſo that ſhee is as ready to labour when ſhe is great as if ſhee were empty. The contrary hapneth to women, which when they are big with child, are weary with going, trobled to be laid, they ride in Chariots through the market places, they eate little, they brooke not that they haue eaten, they hate that which is profitable, and loue that which doth them harme: Finally, a woman with childe is contented with nothing, and ſhee fretteth and vexeth with her ſelfe. Sithence therefore it is tru

                         beare vs in theyr wombes, why doe we not giue them ſome ſafe conduct, when they are in deliuering? O miſerable ſtate of mā, ſince the brute beaſts are borne without deſtroying their mothers: but the miſerable men before they are born, are troubleſome and carefull, and in the time of their birth, are both perillous to themſelues and dangerous to their mothers: which ſeemeth to be very manifeſt: for the preparation that man maketh when he wil die, the ſelfe ſame ought the woman to doe, when ſhee is ready to bee deliuered: Wee muſt alſo conſider, that though birdes haue but two feete, they can goe, moue, and runne, immediately when it commeth foorth: but when man is borne, hee cannot goe, nor moue, and much leſſe runne. So that a Popingey ought more to bee eſteemed which hath no hands, then the man which hath both hands and feet. That which they do to the little babe The miſerable eſtate of man in his infancy. is not but a prognoſtication of that which he ought to ſuffer in the progreſſe of his life: that is to ſay: That as they are not contented for to put the euill doer in priſon, but they lode his hands with yrons, and ſet his feete in the ſtockes: ſo in like manner to the miſerable man, when hee entreth into the Cha
                           •
                        ter of his life, immediately they binde both his hands and his feete, and lay him in the Cradell. So that the innocent

babe is firſt bound and rolled, before hee bee embraced, or haue ſucke of the mother.
                     We muſt note alſo, that the houre wherein the beaſt is brought foorth: though it know not the Sier which begate it, at the leaſt it knoweth the damme which brought it forth which is apparant for ſo much as if the mother haue milke, the youngling forthwith doth ſeeke her teates: and if perchaunce the haue no milke, they goe afterwards to 
                           〈◊〉
                         themſelues vnder her wings. Of the miſerable man it is not ſo, but the day that hee is borne, he knoweth not the Nurſe, that giueth him ſucke, neyther the Father which hath begotten him, the mother which hath borne him, nor yet the Mid-wife which hath receyued him: moreouer hee cannot ſee with his eies, heare with his eares, nor iudge with the taſte, and knoweth neyther what it is to touch or ſmell: ſo that wee ſee him, to whome the Seigniory ouer all brute beaſts and other things (that are created) partayneth to bee borne the moſt vnable of all other creatures.
                     We muſt conſider alſo, that thogh the beaſt be neuer ſo little, yet it can ſeeke for the teates of his mother to ſucke, or to wander in the fieldes to feede, or to ſcrape the dunghilles to eate, or elſe it goeth to the fountains and riuers to drinke, and that he learneth not by the diſcourſe of time, or that any other beaſt hath taught it; but as ſoone as it is borne, ſo ſoone doth it know what thing is neceſſarie for it. The miſerable man is not born with ſo many preſent commodities: he cannot eate, drinke, nor goe, make himſelf ready, aske, nor yet complain and that which is more, hee knoweth not ſcarſely how to ſucke; for the mothers oft times would giue to their children (if they could) the bloud of their heart: and yet they cannot cauſe them to take the milke of their breſts. O great miſery of mans nature, forſomuch as the brute beaſts, as ſoone as they are come forth of their mothers wombe can know and ſeeke: but when Nature of men and beaſts compared both together. it is offred vnto man, he cannot know it. We muſt note alſo, that to brute beaſts nature hath giuen cloathing, wherewith they may keepe themſelus from the heate of Sommer, and defend themſelues from the colde of Winter: which is manifeſt, for that to Lambes and ſheepe ſhe hath giuen wooll, to birdes feathers, to hogges briſtles, to horſes hayre, to fiſhes ſcales, and to ſnailes ſhels.
                     Finally, I ſay, there is no beaſt, which hath neede with his hands to make any garment, nor yet to borrow it of another. Of all this the miſerable man is depriued, who is borne all naked, and dyeth all naked, not carrying with him one onely garment: and if in the time of his life he will vſe any garment, hee muſt demaund of the beaſts, both leather and wooll: &amp; thereunto he muſt alſo put his whole labour and induſtry.
                     I would aske Princes and great Lords, if when they are borne, they bring with them any apparrell: and when they dye, if they carry with them any treaſure? To this I anſwere no: but they dye as they are borne, as well the rich as the poore, and the poore as the rich.
                     And admit that in this life fortune doth make difference betweene vs in eſtates, yet nature in time of our birth, and death, doth make vs all equall. We muſt alſo thinke and conſider, that for ſo much as nature hath prouided the beaſts of garments, ſhee hath hath alſo taken from them the care of what they ought to eate: for there is no beaſt that doth eyther plow, ſow or labour, but doth content her ſelfe, and paſſeth her life eyther with the flyes of the ayre, with the

Corne that ſhee findeth in the highwayes, with the hearbes in the fieldes, with the Ants of the Earth, with the grapes of the vine, or with the fruites which are fallen. Finally (I ſay) that without care all beaſts take their reſt, as if the day following they ſhould haue no neede to eate.
                     Oh, what a great benefite ſhould GOD doe to the miſerable man, if he had taken from him the trauell to apparrell himſelfe, and the care to ſearch for things to eate. But what ſhall the poore miſerable man doe, that before he eateth, hee muſt tyll, ſow, hee muſt reape, and threſh the Corne, hee muſt The cares &amp; troubles that followe man in this life. cleanſe it, grinde it, paſte it, and bake it: and it cannot bee prouided without care of minde, nor be done without the proper ſweate of the browes: And if perchaunce any man did prouide for himſelfe with the ſweate of others, yet ſhall hee liue with his owne offences.
                     Alſo in other things the ſilly beaſts doe excell vs: For, in the Flowers, in the leaues, in the hearbes, in the ſtraw, in the Oates, in the bread, in the fleſh, or in the fruits which they eate, or in the waters which they drinke, they feele no paine, although it be not ſweet: nor take no diſpleaſure, thogh theyr meates be not ſauorie. Finally, ſuch as Nature hath prouided them, without diſguyſing, or making themſelus better, they are contēted to eate.
                     Man could looſe nothing, if in this point he agreed with beaſts: but I am very ſorrie that there are many vicious and prowd men, vnto whom nothing wanteth, eyther to apparell, or eate: but they haue too much to maintaine themſelues, and herewith not contented, they are ſuch Drunkards, to taſte of diuers wines, and ſuch Epicures, to eate of ſundry ſorts of meates, that oft times they ſpend more to dreſſe them, then they did coſt the buying.
                     Now when the Beaſts are brought foorth, they haue knowledge, both of that that is profitable, and alſo of that which is hurtfull for them. For we ſee this, that the ſheep doth fly the wolfe, the catte flieth the dogge, the ratte flieth the catte, and the chicken the kyte: ſo that the beaſts in opening the eyes, doe immediately knowe the friendes, whom they ought to followe, and the Enemies whome they ought to flye. To the miſerable man, was vtterly denyed this ſo great priuiledge. For, in the worlde there hath bin many beaſtly Man of all other creatures ſubiect to dangers. men, who haue not onely attayned that, which they ought to know whiles they liued: but alſo euen as like beaſts they paſſed their dayes in this life, ſo they were infamed at the time of their death.
                     Oh miſerable creatures that we are: which liue in this wicked world; For, wee know not what is hurtfull for vs, what we ought to eate, from what we ought to abſtaine, nor yet whom wee ſhould hate: wee doe not agree with thoſe whome wee ought to loue, wee know not in whome to put our truſt, from whom we ought to flie, nor what it is we ought to chooſe, nor yet what wee ought to forſake.
                     Finally, I ſay, that when wee thinke oft times to enter into a ſure Hauen, within three ſteps afterwards, wee fall headlong into the deepe Sea. Wee ought alſo to conſider, that both to wilde and tame beaſts, nature hath ginen arms or weaponsto defend themſelues, and to aſſault their enemyes, as it appeareth: For, that to byrds ſhee hath giuen wings, to the Harts ſwifte feete, to the Elephants tuskes, to the Serpents ſcales, to the Eagles tallons, to the Fawkon a beake, to the Lyons teeth, to the Bulles hornes, and to the Beares pawes. Finally I ſay, that ſhe hath giuen to the Foxes ſubtiltie, to know how to hyde themſelues in the Earth, and to the Fiſhes little finnes, how to ſwimme in the water.
                     
                        
Admit that the wretched men haue few enemyes, yet in this they are none otherwiſe priuiledged then the beaſts: for we ſee (without teares it cannot be told) that the beaſts which for the ſeruice of Man were created: with the ſelfe ſame beaſts, men are now a dayes troubled and offended. And to the ende it ſeeme not wee ſhould talke of pleaſure, let euery man bethinke with himſelfe, what it is that we ſuffer with the Beaſts of this life: For, the Lyons doe feare vs, the Wolues deuoure our ſheep, the dogges do byte vs, the Cats ſcratche vs, the Beare doeth teare vs, the Serpents poyſon vs, the Bulls hurt Brute beaſts an inſtrument to puniſh man. vs with their hornes, the Byrds doe ouerflye vs, the Rats doe trouble vs, the ſpyders doe annoy vs, and the worſte of all is, that a little Flye ſucketh our bloud in the day, and the poore Flea doth hynder and let vs from ſleeping in the night.
                     Oh poore and miſerable man, who for to ſuſtaine this wretched life, is enforced to begge all things that he needeth of the Beaſts. For the beaſts do giue him wooll, the beaſts doe drawe him water, the beaſts doe carrie him from place to place, the beaſts doe plough the Lande, and carryeth the corne into their barnes. Finally I ſay, that if the man receyue any good, hee hath not wherewith to make recompence: and if they doe him any euill, hee hath nought but the tongue to reuenge.
                     Wee muſt note alſo, that though a man loade a beaſt with ſtrypes, beate her, and driue her by the fowle wayes, though hee take her meate from her, yea, though her younglings dye: yet for none of all theſe ſhe is ſad, or ſorrowfull, and much leſſe doth weepe: and though ſhe ſhould weep, ſhe can not. For beaſts little eſteme their life, and much leſſe feare death. It is not ſo of the vnhappy and wretched man, which cānot but bewaile the vnthankfulneſſe of theyr friendes, the death of their Children, the wants which they haue of neceſſaries, the caſes of aduerſitie which doe ſucceed them, the falſe witnes which is brought againſt them, and a thouſand calamityes which doe torment their hearts. Finally I ſay, that the greateſt comforts that men haue in this life, is to make a riuer of water with the teares of their Eyes,
                     Let vs enquire of Princes and great Lordes, what they can doe when they are borne: whether they can ſpeake as Orators, if they can runne as Poſtes, if they can gouern themſelues as kings if they can fight as men of Warre, if they can labour as labourers, if they can worke as maſons, if they knowe to teach as maiſters? Theſe litle children would anſwer, that they are not onely ignorant of all that wee demaund of them, but alſo that they cannot vnderſtand it,
                     Let vs returne to aske them, what it is that they knowe, ſince they know nothing of that we haue demaunded them? They will anſwer, that they can doe no other thing, but weepe at their byrth, and ſorrow at theyr death.
                     Though all thoſe (which ſaile in this ſo perillous Sea) doe reioyce and take pleaſure, and ſeeme to ſleepe ſoundly: yet at the laſt there cometh the winde of aduerſitie, which maketh them all know their follies. For, if I be not deceiued, and if I know any thing of this world: thoſe which I haue ſeene at the time of their birth take ſhip weeping: I doubt whether they will take Land in the graue laughing?
                     Oh vnhappy life! (I ſhould ſay rather death) which the mortalls take for life: wherein afterwards we muſt ſpend and conſume a great time, to learne all Artes, Sciences, and offices: and yet notwithſtanding, that whereof we are ignorant, is much more then that which wee knowe. Wee forget the greateſt part, ſaue only that of

weeping, which no man needeth to learne: for wee are borne, and liue weeping, and vntill this preſent wee haue ſeene none to die in ioy. Wee muſt note alſo that the beaſts doe liue and dye, with the inclinations wherwith they were borne: that is to ſay, that the Wolfe followeth the ſheepe: and not the birdes: the hound followeth the hares, and not the rattes: the ſparrow flyeth at the birdes, and not at the fiſh, the ſpider eateth the flyes, and not the herbes. Finally, I ſay, that if wee let the beaſt ſearch his meate quietly, we ſhall not ſee him giuen to any other thing.
                     The contrary of all this hapneth to men, the which though nature hath created feeble, yet Gods intention was not they ſhould bee malitious: but I am ſorry, ſince they cannot auoyd debility, that they turne it into malice. The preſumption which they haue to bee good, they turne to pride: and the deſire they haue to be innocent, they turne into enuy. The fury which they ſhould take againſt malice, they turne into anger, and the liberality they ought to haue with the good, they conuert into auarice: The neceſſity they haue to eate, they turne into gluttonie: and the care they ought to haue of their conſcience, they turne into negligence. Finally, I ſay, that the more ſtrength beaſts haue, the more they ſerue, and the leſſe men are worth, ſo much the more thankes haue they of God: The innocency of the brute beaſtes Malitious men worſe then brure beaſts. conſidered, and the malice of the malitious men marked without compariſon, the company of the brute beaſt is leſſe hurtfull, then the conuerſation of euill men.
                     For in the end, if hee bee conuerſant with a beaſt, yee haue not but to beware of her: but if yee bee in company with a man, there is nothing wherin yee ought to truſt him: Wee muſt note alſo, that it was neyther ſeene or read, that there was any beaſt that took care for the graue: but the beaſts being dead, ſome were torne in peeces with Lions, other diſmembred by the bears, others gnawn with dogs, other remain in the fields: other are eaten of men, and other by the Ants.
                     Finally, the entrailes of the one, are the graues of others. It is not ſo of the miſerable man, the which conſumeth no ſmall treaſure to make his Tombe, which is the moſt vaineſt thing that is in this miſerable life: for there is no greater vanity nor lightnes in man, then to be eſteemed for his goodly and ſumptuous ſepulture, and little to weigh a good Life. I will ſweare, that at this day all the dead doe ſweare, that they care little if their bodies be buried in the deepe Seas, or in the golden Tombes, or that the cruell beaſts haue eaten thē, or that they remaine in the fieldes without a graue: ſo that their ſoules may be among the celeſtiall Companies. Speaking after the Lawe of a Chriſtian, I durſt ſay, that it profiteth little the body to be among the painted and carued ſtones, when the miſerable ſoule is burning in the fierie flames of hell. O miſerable creatures, We ought not to regard where our dead corpes are enterred. haue not wee ſufficient wherewith to ſeeke in this life, to procure, to trauell, to accompliſh, to ſigh, and alſo what to bewayle, without hauing ſuch care &amp; anguiſh to know where they ſhall bee buried? Is there any man ſo vaine, that hee dooth not care that other men ſhould condemne his euil life, ſo that they praiſe his rich tombe? To thoſe that are liuing I ſpeake and ſay of thoſe that are dead, that if a man gaue them leaue to returne into the World, they would bee occupied more to correct their exceſſe, and offences, then to adiourne and repayre their graues,

and tombes though they haue found them fallen downe. I cannot tell what to ſay more in this caſe, but to admoniſh men that it is a great folly to make any great account of the graues.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXIIII. The Emperour Marcus Aurelius writeth this letter to Domitius a Citizen of Capua to comfort him in his exile, beeing baniſhed for a quarrell betwixt him and another about the running of a horſe, very comfortable to thoſe that haue beene in fauour and now fallen in diſgrace.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArke the Romane Emperour, borne at Mount Celio, to thee Domitius of A Letter of the Emperour to a baniſhed man. 
                        Capua, wiſheth health and conſolation from the gods the onely Comforters. The bitter Winter in theſe partes haue rayſed boſterous winds, and the winds haue cauſed much raine, and the much raine hath cauſed great moyſtures: the which engendreth in me ſundrie diſeaſes. Among the which the gowt of my hands is one, and the Statica in my legges is another, Eſchines the Philoſopher ſayde, that the liberty of the ſoule, and the health of the body, cannot bee eſteemed too much, and much leſſe alſo bought for money. Tell mee, I pray thee, what can hee doe, or what is hee worth, that hath neyther liberty nor health? The diuine Plato in his bookes of his common wealth, reciteth three things.
                     The firſt, that the man which oweth nothing, cannot ſay that hee is poore: For the day that I owe money to another, another, and not When good orders were obſerued in Rome. my ſelfe is Lord of mine owne. The ſecond, the man which is no ſeruant nor captaine, hath not reaſon to ſay, that any thing makes him vnhappy: For Fortune in nothing ſheweth her ſelfe ſo cruell, as to take from vs the liberty of this life.
                     The ſecond, which Plato ſayde, is that among all temporall goods there is none more greater, nor greater felicity then the treaſure of health: For the man which is perſecuted with ſicknes, with riches can haue no contentation.
                     In the time of our olde Fathers, when Rome was well corrected, they did not onely ordaine the things of their Common-wealth: but alſo they prouided for that which touched the health of euerie perſon. So that they watched to cure the body, and they were circumſpect to deſtroy vices. In the time of Gneus Patroclus and Iulius Albus, they ſay that the City of Rome was ordinarily viſited with ſickneſſe: Wherefore firſt they did forbid, that in the moneth of Iuly and Auguſt, there ſhould bee no ſtewes for Women: For the bloud of the young was corrupted in Veneriall acts.
                     The third, that no man ſhoulde bring any fruit from Salon or Campania to ſell, during theſe two moneths in Rome: For the delicate Ladies of Rome for extreame heate, and the poore for their pouerty, did not eate in ſommer but fruites: and ſo the market places were full of fruites, and the houſes full of Agues. The thirde, they did defend that no inhabitant ſhould bee ſo hardy, to walke after the Sunne was ſet: For the young men, through the lightneſſe they vſed in the nights, took diſeaſes which vexed them in the dayes.
                     The fourth, they did prohibit that no man ſhould bee ſo hardy to ſell openly

in Rome, wine of Candie or Spaine. For, in the great heate of the ſummer, as the Sunne is very hote, ſo the wine as poyſon doth kill young men.
                     The fifth, that they ſhould purge the priueyes, and make cleane the ſtreetes and Houſes: For, of the corruption of the ayre, is engendred the plague among the people.
                     When Rome was rich, when Rome proſpered, all theſe things were obſerued in the common-wealth. But ſince Catilina the tyraunt did rebell, ſince The time when good orders were broken in Rome. 
                        Scylla and Marius did ſlaunder it: ſince Caeſar and Pompeyus did playe the Tyrants: ſince Octauius Auguſtus, and Marcus Antonius did robbe it: ſince Caligula and Nero did defame it: they cared little whether they entred into Rome, to ſell the wine of Spaine or Candia. For, they feared more the knife of the enemyes, then the heate of the ſummer. Great reaſon had the Auncients, to forbid thoſe things in Rome, For to ſay the trueth, they are not healthfull.
                     When I was young in Rome, my head did not ake, with talking in the night, nor I did feele my bloud chaſed with drinking wine: Then I was not troubled to ieatte, in the heate in the ſummer, nor I was annoyed to go bare-legged in the winter. But nowe that I am olde, there is no heate but offendeth me, nor colde but pearſeth mee. For men through much euill rule in their youth, come to grieuous diſeaſes in their age.
                     Oh if mortall men, after that they be olde, could at any time worke with the Gods, that they ſhould become young againe: I ſweare vnto thee, by the faith of a good man, that they would behaue themſelues ſo well, that the world ſhould not againe deceyue them. Since men haue been vicious in their youth, I do not maruell thogh they are full of diſeaſes when they are old. For, how can he loue his health, which hateth vertue? All that which I haue ſpoken here before is to the end you may knowe and belieue that I am ſicke, and that I cannot write vnto thee ſo long as I would, and as thou deſireſt: ſo that hereof it followeth, that I ſhall bewayle thy paine, and thou ſhalt be grieued with my gowt. I vnderſtod here how at the feaſt of the God Ianus, through the running of a horſe, great ſtrife is raiſed betweene thee and thy neighbor Patricius: And the brute was ſuch, that they haue confiſcated thy goods, battered thy houſe, baniſhed thy children, and depriued thee from the Senate for tenne yeares.
                     And further, they baniſhed thee out of Capua for euer, and haue put thy fellow in the priſon Mamortine: 
                        The reaſon that Domitius was baniſhed. ſo that by this little furie, thou haſt cauſe to lamet al the dayes of thy life: Al thoſe which come from thence do tell vs, that thou art ſo woefull in thy heart, and ſo chaunged in thy perſon, that thou doeſt not forget thy heauie chaunces, nor receiueſt conſolation of thy faithfull friends.
                     Thinke not that I ſpeake this, that thou ſhouldeſt be offended: for according to the often chaunges which fortune hath ſhewed in mee, it is long ſince I knew what ſorrow meant: For truly the man which is ſorowful, ſigheth in the day, watcheth in the night, delyteth not in companie, and with onely care hee reſteth. The light he hateth, the darknes he loueth, with his bitter teares hee watereth the Earth, with heauy ſighs he pierceth the Heauens, with infinit ſorrowes he remembreth that that is paſt, and foreſeeth nothing that which is to come. He is diſpleaſed with him that doeth comfort him, and hee taketh reſt to expreſſe his ſorrowes.
                     Finally, the vnfortunate man is contented with nothing, and with himſelfe continually hee doeth chafe. Beleeue

mee Domitius, that if I haue wel touched the conditions of the ſorrowfull man, it is for no other cauſe, but for that my euill fortune hath made me taſte them all.
                     And hereof it commeth, that I can ſo well diſcribe them: for in the end, in things which touch the ſorrowes of the ſpirite, and the troubles of the body, there is great difference from him that hath read them, &amp; frō him that hath felt them. If thou diddeſt feele it there, as I doe feele it here, it is ſufficient to giue thee and thy friendes great dolour, to thinke that for ſo ſmall a trifle thou ſhouldſt vndoe thee, and al thy parentage: and ſpeaking with the truth, I am very ſorry to ſee thee caſt away: but much more it grieueth me, to ſee thee drow ned in ſo little water.
                     When men are noble, and keepe their hearts high, they ought to take their enemies agreeable to their Eſtates. I meane, that when a Noble man ſhall aduenture to hazard his perſon and his goods, he ought to do it for a matter of greate importance: For in the end, more defamed is hee that ouercommeth a Labourer, then he which is ouercome with a knight: O how variable is Fortune, and in how ſhort ſpace doth happen an euil fortune? in that which now I will ſpeake?
                     I doe condemne my ſelfe, and accuſe thee. I complaine to the Gods, I reclaime the dead, and I call the liuing, to the end they may ſee, how that before our eyes wee ſuffer the griefes, and know them not, with the hands wee touch them, and perceyue them not, wee goe ouer them &amp; ſee them not: they ſound in our eares, and wee heare them not: dayly they doe admoniſh vs, and wee doe not beleeue them.
                     Finally, we feele the perill, where there is no remedy for our griefe: for as experience doth teach vs, with a little blaſt of wind, the fruit doth fal, with a little ſparke of fire the houſe is kindled, with a little rocke the ſhippe is broken, at a little ſtone the foote doth ſtuinble, with a litle hooke they take great fiſh, and with a litle wound dyeth a great perſon.
                     For all that I haue ſpoken, I doe meane that our life is ſo frayle, and fortune ſo fickle, that in that parte where wee are ſureſt harneſſed, wee are ſooneſt wounded. And Seneca writing to his mother Albina, which was baniſhed from Rome, ſayde theſe words.
                     
                        Thou Albina art my mother, and I 
                        A worthy ſpeech of Seneca to his mother Albina. 
                        thy ſonne, thou art aged, and I am young: I neuer beleeued in fortune, though ſhee would promiſe to bee in peace with mee.
                     
                     And further hee ſayde, All that which is in mee, I count it at the diſpoſition of Fortune, as well of riches, as of proſperity: And I keepe them in ſuch a place, that at any boure in the night when ſhee liſteth, ſhee may carry them away, and neuer wake me. So that thogh ſhee carry thoſe out of my Cofers, yet ſhee ſhould not robbe mee of this in my Entrals, Without doubt ſuch wordes were maruellous pithie, and very decent for ſuch a a wiſe man.
                     The Emperour Adrian my Lord, did weare a ring of gold on his finger, which hee ſayd was of the good Druſius Germanicus; and the words about the ring in Latine letters ſayd thus: Illis eſt grauis fortuna quibus eſt repentina: Fortune to them is moſt cruell, whom ſuddenly ſhee aſſaulteth.
                     We ſee oftentimes by experience that in the fyſtula which is ſtopped, and not in that place which is open, the Surgeon maketh doubt. In the ſhallow water, and not in the deepe ſeas, the Pilot deſpayreth. The good man of Armes is more afraide of the ſecret ambuſhmnt, then in the open

battell. I meane, that the valiaunt men ought to beware, not of ſtraungers but of his owne, not of enemies but of friends, not of the cruell warre, but of the fained peace, not of the vniuſt damage but of the priuy euil.
                     O how many men wee haue ſeene, whom the miſhaps of fortune could neuer change, and yet afterwards hauing no care ſhe hath made them fall.
                     I aske now what hope can man haue, which will neuer truſt to the proſperity of fortune: ſince for ſo light a thing, we haue ſeen ſuch trouble in Capua, and ſo great loſſe of thy perſon and goods? If wee know fortune, we would not make ſo great complaint of her.
                     For ſpeaking the truth, as ſhee is for all, and would content all, though in the end ſhee mocke all, ſhe giueth How little wee ought to regard the flatteries of forune. and ſheweth vs all her goods, and we others take them for inheritance. That which ſhe lendeth vs, wee take it for perpetuall, that which in ieſt ſhee giueth vs, we take it in good earneſt: and in the end, as ſhe is the mocker of all, ſo ſhee goeth mocking of vs: thinking that ſhee giueth vs another mans, &amp; ſhe taketh our own proper.
                     I let thee know, that knowing that of fortune which I know, I feare not the turmoyles of her trauels, neither doth her lightnings or thunders aſtoniſh me nor yet will I not eſteeme the pleaſantneſſe of her goodly fayre flatteries. I will not truſt her ſweete reioyſings, neyther wil I make accoūt of her friendſhips, nor I will ioyne my ſelfe with her enemies, nor I will take any pleaſure of that ſhee giueth mee, neyther griefe of that ſhee taketh from mee; nor I will haue reſpect when ſhe telleth me truth, nor I doe not regard it, though ſhe tell me a lye.
                     Finally, I would not laugh for that ſhee asketh me, nor I will weepe for that ſhe ſendeth mee. I will now tell thee (my friend Domitius) one thing, and heartily I deſire thee for to keepe it in memory: Our life is ſo doubtfull, and fortune is ſo ſodaine, that when ſhee threatneth ſhee ſtriketh not alwayes, neyther doth ſhee threaten alwayes when ſhee ſtriketh. The man which preſumeth to bee ſage, and in all things well prouided goeth not ſo faſt, that at euery ſteppe hee is in danger of falling, nor ſo ſoftly, that in long time hee cannot arriue at his iorneyes end: for falſe fortune gauleth in ſtead of ſtriking, and in ſteade of gauling ſtriketh. Therefore ſince in yeares I am older then thou, and haue more experience of affayres: if thou haſt marked that I haue tolde thee, thou wilt remember well that which I will ſay vnto thee, which is, that that part of thy life is troubleſome, which vnto thee ſeemeth to be moſt ſure.
                     Wilt thou that by example I tell thee all that, which by words I haue ſpoken? Behold Hercules of Thebes, who eſcaped ſo many dangers both by ſea and land, and afterwards came to dye in the armes of a harlot. Agamemnon the great Captaine of the Greekes, in the x. yeares which hee warred againſt Troy, neuer had any perill, and afterwards in the night, they killed him entring into his owne houſe.
                     The inuincible Alexander the Alexaander the great after his ſo many conqueſts dyed by poyſon. Great, in all the conqueſts of Aſia did not die, and afterwards with a little poyſon ended his life in Babylon, Pompeius the Great, dyed not in the conqueſt of his enemies: and afterwards his friend Ptolomeus ſlew him.

moment (which the Romanes could not do in 17. yeares) onely becauſe he would not come into the hands of his enemies. Aſclipius medius, brother of great Pompeius, in 20. yeeres that he was a Rouer on the ſeas, neuer was in any perill: afterwards drawing water out of a well, was drowned therein. Ten Captains whom Scipio had choſen in the conqueſt of Affricke, ieaſting on a bridge, fell into the water, and there were drowned. The good How quickly ſodaine death ouertaketh many men.

                     How thinkeſt thou Domitius: By the immortal Gods I do ſweare vnto thee, that as I haue declared to thee this ſmall number, ſo I could recite thee other infinite. What miſhappe is this after ſo many fortunes? what reproch after ſuch glory? What perill after ſuch ſurety, what euill lucke after ſuch good ſucceſſe, what darke night after ſo cleare a day, what euill entertainement after ſo great labour: what ſentence ſo cruell after ſo long proceſſe? O what inconuenience of death after ſo good beginning of life? Being in their ſteade, I cannot tell, what I would, but I had rather chuſe vnfortunate life and honorable death then an infamous death and honourable life. That man which will bee counted for a good man, and not noted for a brute beaſt, ought greatly to trauell to liue well, and much more to dye better: for the euill death maketh How carefull men ought to be to liue wel. men doubt that the life hath not bin good, and the good death is the excuſe of an euill life.
                     At the beginning of my Letter, I wrote vnto thee, how that the gowte troubleth mee euill in my hand. I ſay it were to much to write any longer: and though the Letter bee not of my owne hand; theſe two dayes the loue that I beare thee, and the griefe that holdeth me, haue ſtriued together. My will deſireth to write, and my fingers cannot hold the penne. The remedy hereof is, that ſince I haue no power to doe what I would as thine: thou oughteſt to accept what I can, as mine. I ſay no more herein, but as they tell mee thou buildeſt now a houſe in Rhodes: wherefore I do ſend thee a thouſand ſexterces to accompliſh the ſame.
                     My wife Fauſtine ſaluteth thee, who for thy paine is ſore grieued: They tell vs thou haſt beene hurt, wherefore ſhe ſendeth thee a weight of the Balme of Paleſtine. Heale thy face therewith, to the end the ſcarres of that wound doe not appeare. If thou findeſt greene Almonds, &amp; new nuts, Fauſtine deſireth thee that thou wilt ſend her ſome. By another man ſhee ſendeth a gowne for thee, and a kirtle for thy wife. I conclude, and doe beſeech the immortall Gods to giue thee all that I deſire for thee, &amp; and that they giue me all that thou wiſheſt me. Though by the hands of others I write vnto thee, yet with my heart I loue thee.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXXV. That Princes and Noble men ought to bee aduocates for widdowes, Fathers of Orpnans, and helpers of thoſe which are comfortleſſe.
                     
                     
                        
                           MAcrobius in the 3. booke of the Saturnals ſayeth, That in the noble Citie of Athens, there was a temple called Miſericordia, which the Athenians kept ſo well watched and locked, that without leaue &amp; licence of the Senate, no man might enter in. There were the Images of pittifull Princes onely, and none entered in there to pray, but pittifull men.
                     The Athenians abhorred always ſeuere and cruell deeds, becauſe they would not be noted cruell. And thereof commeth this manner of ſaying, that the greateſt iniurie they could ſay vnto a wan was, That hee had neuer entred into the Schoole of the Philoſophers to learne, nor into the Temple of Miſericordia to pray: So that in the one, they noted him for ſimple, and in the other they acuſed him for cruell.
                     The Hiſtoriographers ſay, that the moſt noble linage that was at that time, was of a King of Athens, the which was exceeding rich and liberall A worthy example of an Atheniā King. in giuing, and aboue all very pittifull in pardoning. Of whom it is written, that after the great Treaſures which he had offred in the temples, and the great riches he had diſtributed to the poore: hee tooke vpon him to bring vp all the Orphans in Athens, and to feede all the widdowes.
                     O how much more did that ſtatute of the ſayde pittifull King ſhine in that Temple, who nouriſhed the Orphanes: then the Enſignes which are ſet vp in the Temples of the Captains which had robbed the widows. All the auncient Princes, I ſay, thoſe that haue beene noble and valiant, &amp; that haue not had the name of Tyrants, though in ſome thinges they were noted: yet they alwayes haue beene prayſed, eſteemed, and commended to be mercifull and gentle: ſo that they recompenced the fierceneſſe and cruelty which they ſhew to their enemies, with the mercy and clemency which they vſed to the Orphans.
                     
                        Plutarch in his Politiques ſayeth, that the Romanes among themſelues ordained, that all that which remayned of banquets and feaſtes, which were made at mariages and triumphs ſhould bee giuen to Widdows and A good cuſtome among the ancient Romanes. orphanes. And this cuſtome was brought to ſo good an order, that if any rich man would vſe his profite of that which remayned, the Orphanes might iuſtly haue an action of felony againſt him, as a thing robbed from them.
                     
                        Ariſtides the Philoſopher in an Oration hee made of the excellency of Rome, ſayth: That the Princes of Perſia had this cuſtome, neuer to dine nor ſuppe, but firſt the Trumpets ſhould blow at their gates, the which were more loude, then harmonius. And it was to this end, that all the Widdowes and Orphanes ſhoulde come thither: for it was a Law amongſt them, that all that which was left at the royall tables, ſhould bee for the poore and indigent perſons.
                     
                        Phalaris the Tirant writing to a friend of his, ſayde theſe wordes: I haue receyued thy briefe Letter, with the rebuke likewiſe which thou gaueſt me therein, more bitter then tedious, And
                        
                        admit that for the time it grieued mee, yet after I came to my ſelfe, I re ceyued thereby great comfort. For in the ende, one louing rebuke of his friēds is more worth then a fayned flattery of his enemie, 
                        A rebuke of a friēd more acceptable, then the ſlattring words of foes.
                     
                     
                        Amongſt the things whereof thou accuſeſt mee, thou ſayeſt that they take mee for agreat tyraunt, becauſe I diſobey the Gods, ſpoyle the Temples, kyll the Prieſtes, purſue the innocents, robbe the people, and the worſt of all, that I doe not ſuffer mee to be entreated, nor permit that any man be conuerſaunt with mee.
                     
                     
                        To that they ſay I diſobey the Gods, in very deede they ſay true. For if I did all that the Gods would I ſhould doe I ſhould doe little of that men doe aske mee. For as much as they ſay I robbe the Temples: there vnto alſo I graunt: For the immortall Gods doe demaund rather of vs pure hearts, then that wee ſhould buylde their Temples.: For that they ſay I kill the prieſts, I confeſſe alſo that it is true. For they are ſo diſſolute, that I thinke I doe more ſeruices to the Gods to put them to death, then they doe in doing their Sacrifices while they liue.
                     
                     
                        For that they ſay I robbe the Temples, I alſo confeſſe it: For I defending it as I doe from Enemyes, it is but meete and reaſonable they finde me and my Seruāts: For that they ſay I ſuffer me not to be entreated, it is true: For daily and hourely they aske mee ſo many vniuſt and vnreaſonable things, that for them and for mee it is better to denye them, then for to graunt them.
                     
                     
                        For that they ſay that I am not conuerſant with any: I confeſſe it is true, for euer when they come into my Pallace, it is not ſo much to doe mee ſeruice, as to aske ſome particular thing for their profite. For that they ſay I am not pittifull among the miſerable, and will not heare the Widdowes and Orphanes, in no wiſe to that I will agree: For I ſweare vnto thee, by the immortall Gods, that my gates were neuer ſhut to Widdowes and Orphanes.
                     
                     
                        Pulto in the life of the Emperour Claudius ſayth, that once a poore widdow came before Claudius the Emperour with weeping eyes, to deſire him of iuſtice. The pittifulnes of the Emperour Claudius.
                     
                     The good Prince being moued with compaſſion, did not onely weepe as ſhee: but with his owne hands dried her teares. And as there was about the Emperour many Noble Romaines, one amongſt them, ſaide thus vnto him: The authority &amp; grauitie of Romaine Princes, to heare their Subiects in iuſtice ſufficeth onely: though they drye not the teares of theyr faces.
                     This Emperour Claudius aunſwered, Good Princes ought not to bee contented, to doe no more then iuſt ludges: but in doing iuſtice a man muſt know that they are pittiful. For oftentimes those which come before Princes, doe returne more contented with the loue they ſhewe them: then with the Iuſtice they miniſter vnto them: And further he ſaide. For as much as you ſay: That it is of ſmall authority, &amp; alſo of leſſe grauitie, that a Prince doe weepe with a widdowe, and with his hands wipe her eyes: I aunſwere thee, that I deſire rather to bee partaker of the griefes with my Subiectes, then to giue them occaſion to haue their eyes full of teares.
                     Certainely theſe wordes are worthie to bee noted, and no leſſe followed. Admit that clemencie in all things deſerueth to bee praiſed: yet much more ought it to be cōmended, when it is executed on women. And if generally in all, much more in thoſe which are voyde of health and comfort. For, Women are quickly troubled, and with greater difficultie comforted.
                     
                        Plutarche and Quintus Curtius ſay, that good entertainment which Alexander the great, ſhewed vnto the wiſe and children of king Darius (after hee was vtterly vanquiſhed) exalted his clemencie: in ſuch ſort, that they gaue

rather more glorie to Alexander, for the pittie and honeſty which hee vſed with the children, then for the victorie he had of the Father.
                     And when the vnhappie King Darius knewe the clemencie and pittie, which the good King Alexander vſed towards his wife and his children, hee ſent vnto him his Embaſſadors, to the ende that on his behalfe, they ſhould thanke him for that that is paſt, and ſhould deſire him, that hee would ſo continue in time to come: Saying, that it might chaunce, that the Gods and Fortune, would mittigate theyr wrath againſt him.
                     
                        Alexander aunſwered vnto the Embaſſadours theſe wordes: Yee ſhall ſay in my behalfe to your king Darius, 
                        The ſpeech 
                              •
                           t King Alexander, to king Darius that hee giue mee no thankes, for the good and pittifull worke which I haue ſhewed or done to his captiue Women, ſince hee is certaine, I did it not for that hee was my friend: and that I would not ceaſe to doe it, for that he is mine enemie. But I haue done it, for that a gentle Prince is bound to doe in this caſe.
                     For, I ought to employe my clemencie vnto Women, which can doe nought but weepe: and my puiſſant power Princes ſhall feele, which can doe nought elſe but wage battell, &amp;c. Truely thoſe wordes were worthie of ſuch a Prince.
                     Manie haue enuie at the ſurname of Alexander, which is great. And he is called Alexander the great, becauſe if his heart was great in the enterpriſes hee tooke vppon him, his courage was much more greater in Citties and Realmes which he gaue.
                     Manie haue enuie at the renowme which they giue Pompeyus: becauſe they call him great: for, this excellent Romaine, made himſelfe conquerour of xxii. Realmes, and in times paſt hath bin accompanyed with xxv. Kings. Manie haue enuie at the renowme of Scipto the Africane, becauſe hee ouercame and conquered the great and renowmed cittie of Carthage: the which citty in riches was greater then Rome, in Armes and power, it ſurmounted all Europe. Many haue enuie at Scipio the Aſian, who was called Aſian becauſe he ſubdued the prowd Aſia: the which vntill his time was not, but as a church-yarde of Romaines.
                     
                     Many haue great enuie at the immortall name of Charles the great, becauſe being as he was (a little king) he did not only vanquiſh and triumph ouer many Kings and Realms: but alſo forſooke the royall Sea of his owne Realme.
                     I doe not maruell that the prowde Princes haue enuie againſt the vertuous and valiant Princes: but if I were as they, I would haue more Enuie at the renowm of Anthoninus the Emperour, then of the name and renowme of all the Princes in the worlde.
                     If other Princes haue attained ſuch prowd names, it hath bin for that they robbed many Countreys, ſpoyled many Temples, cōmitted much tiranny, diſſembled with many Tyrants, peſecuted diuers Innocents, and becauſe they haue takē from diuers good men, not onely their goods, but alſo theyr liues: For, the world hath ſuch an euill propertie, that to exalte the name of one onely, he putteth downe 500.
                     Neyther in ſuch enterpriſes, nor yet with ſuch Titles wanne the Emperour Anthoninus Pius, his good name and renowme.
                     But, if they call him Authoninus the pittifull, it is becauſe hee knewe not, but to bee the Father of Orphanes: and was not prayſed, but becauſe Wherefore the worthie Anthoninus was renowm. d. hee was the onely Aduocate of Widdowes.
                     Of this moſt excellent Prince is read, that he himſelfe did heare, and iudge the complaints and proces in Rome, of the Orphanes: And for the poore, and

Widdowes, the gates of his Pallace were alwayes open: So that the porters which hee kept within his Pallace, were not for to let the Entrie of the poore: but for to let, and keepe backe the rich.
                     The Hyſtoriographers, oftentimes ſay, that this good Prince ſayde: That 
                        A worthy ſaying of the Emp: &amp; worthy to be followed 
                        the good and vertuous Princes, ought alwayes to haue theyr Hearts open, for the poore, and to remedie the Widdowes, and Father-leſſe, and neuer to ſhutte their Gates againſt them.
                     
                     The God Apollo ſayeth: that the Prince which will not ſpeedily iudge the cauſes of the poore, the Gods will neuer permit that hee be well obeyed of the rich.
                     O high and worthie wordes, that it pleaſed not the God Apollo, but our Liuing GOD, that they were written in the hearts of Noble Princes. For, nothing can be more vniuſt or diſhoneſt, then that in the pallaces of Princes and great Lordes, the rich and the fooles ſhould be diſpatched, and the Widdowes and Orphanes friendes, ſhould haue no audience?
                     Oh happie: and not once, but an hundreth times treble happie is hee, that will haue commiſeration: remembring the poore afflicted, and oppreſſed; and open his hande to comforte and relieue them: and doeth not ſhutte his coffers from helping them: vnto him (I aſſure and promiſe) that at the ſtreight day of iudgement, the proces of his life ſhall be iudged with mercie and pittie.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXVI. ¶ That the troubles, griefes, and ſorrowes of Widdowes are much greater then thoſe of Widowers: wherefore Princes and Noble-men ought to haue more compaſsion vpon the Women then on men.
                     
                     
                        IT is great pity to ſee a Noble and vertuous man ſorrowful, alone, and a widower, if eſpecially he liued contented when he was married. For if hee will not marrie, he hath loſt his ſweete companie: and if he thinke to marrie another, let him be aſſured hee ſhall ſcarcely agree with his ſeconde wife.
                     There is much ſorow in that houſe, where the woman that gouerned it is How acceſſarie it is for a wife to be in her owne houſe. dead: For immediately the Husband forſaketh himſelfe, the childrē do loſe their obedience, the ſeruants become negligent, the hand-maydes become wanton, the Friends are forgotten, the houſe decayeth, the goods waſte, the apparell is loſt: And finally, in the widdowers houſe, there are many to robbe, and few to labour.
                     Both heauy and lamentable are the thoughtes of the widdower: For, if hee thinketh to marry, it grieueth him to giue his children a ſtepmother.
                     If he cannot be marryed, hee feeleth greater paine, ſeeing him all the day to remaine alone: ſo that the poore miſerable man ſigheth for his Wife hee hath loſt, and weepeth for her whome he deſireth to haue.
                     Admit that this bee true, there is great difference frō the cares and ſorrows of womē, to that of men. A thing very cleare: for ſo much as the widdower lawfully may go out of his houſe, hee may go to the fields, he may talke

with his Neighbours, hee may be occupyed with his friendes, hee may follow his ſutes, and alſo he may be conuerſant, and refreſh himſelfe in honeſt places. For, commonly men are not ſo ſorrowfull, in taking the death of their wiues, as the wiues are, in taking the death of their Husbands.
                     All this is not ſpoken in the disfauour of wiſe and ſage men, whom we ſee make ſmall ſtreams, with the teares of their eyes, for the death of their wiues. But for many other vaine and lightmen: which the 9. dayes (of the Funerall paſt) a man doth ſee without any ſhame, to goe throughout their ſtreets, beholding the ladies and Dam ſells, which are in the windowes.
                     Truely the wofull women which are honeſt, vſe not ſuch lightneſſe. For, whiles they are widdows, it is not lawfull for them to wander abrode, to go out of their houſes, nor to ſpeake with ſtrangers, nor practiſe with her owne, nor bee conuerſaunt with her Neighbours, A cuſtome vſed by widdowes in ancient times. nor plead with their creditors, but agreable to their woefull eſtate, to hyde and withdraw themſelues within their houſes, and to lock themſelues into their owne Chambers: and they thinke it their dutyes, to water theyr plants with teares, and importune the Heauens with ſobs and ſighes.
                     Oh how wofull? O how grieuous? O how ſorrowfull is the ſtate of Widdows? For ſomuch as if a Widdow goe out of her houſe, they take her for diſhoneſt. If ſhee will not come out of her houſe, ſhe loſeth her goods: If ſhe laugh a litle, they count her light. If ſhee laugh not, they count her an hypocrite. If ſhe go to the Church, they note her for a gadder. If ſhe go not to the Church, they ſay ſhe is vnthankfull to her late husband. If ſhe go ill apparelled, they account her a niggard. If ſhe go cleanly &amp; handſom, they ſay now ſhe wold haue a new huſband. If ſhe doe maintaine herſelfe honeſtly, they note her for preſūptuous.
                     If ſhe keepe company, immediately they ſuſpect her houſe. Finally I ſay, that the poore miſerable Widdowes ſhall finde a thouſand which iudge their liues, and they haue not one that will remedie their paine.
                     Much looſeth that Woman which loſeth her Mother, which hath borne her or her Siſters, which ſhee loueth, or the friends which ſhe knoweth, or the goods which ſhe hath heaped vp: But I ſay and affirme, that there is no greater loſſe in the worlde vnto a woman, then the loſſe of a good Huſband. For in other loſſes, there is but one onely loſſe: but in that of the Husband, all are loſt together.
                     After that the wife doth ſee her louing Husband in the graue, I woulde aske her; What good could remaine with her in her houſe? Since wee know, that if her husband were good, hee was the Hauen of all her Troubles, What a cō
                           fort a good husband is to a woman the remedie of all her neceſſities, the inuētor of all her pleaſurs, the true loue of her heart, the true lord of her perſon, and idoll whom ſhe honored.
                     Finally, hee was the onely faithfull ſteward of her houſe, and the good father of all her children and familie. Whether Familie remaineth or not, whether children remaineth or not, in the one, and in the other, trouble and vexation remayneth moſt aſſuredly, to the poore Widdow.
                     If perchaunce ſhee remaine poore, &amp; haue no goods, let euery man imagine what her life can bee? For the poor, miſerable, and vnhappy woman, eyther will aduenture her perſon to get, or will looſe her honeſtie to demaunde. An honeſt woman, a Noble and worthy woman, a delicate woman: a ſweete woman: a woman of renowme: a woman that ought to haue care to maintaine Children and familie, ought to haue great reaſon to be full of anguiſh &amp; ſorrow: to ſee, that

if ſhe will maintaine her ſelfe with the Needle, ſhee ſhall not haue ſufficiently to finde her bread and water. If ſhe gaine with her bodie, ſhee looſeth her ſoule;
                     If ſhee muſt demaund of others, ſhee is aſhamed. If ſhee fulfill the teſtament of her Husband, ſhe muſt ſell her Gownes. If ſhee will not pay his debtes, they cauſe her to bee brought before the iudges. As women naturally are tender, what heart will ſuffer them to endure ſuch inconueniences? and what Eyes can abſtayne to ſhed infinite teares? If perchaunce goods do remaine to the miſerable widdow, ſhe hath no little care to keepe them? She is at great charges and expences, to ſuſtaine and maintaine her ſelfe, in long ſuite about her lands, much trouble The care that Worldlings haue. to augment them: and in the end, much ſorrowe to depart from them. For all her children, and heyres, doe occupie themſelues more to bethinke them, how they might inherit, then in what ſort they ought to ſerue her.
                     When I came vnto this paſſage, a great while I kept my penne in ſuſpence, to ſee whither I ought to teach this matter, or no: (that is to ſay) that oftentimes the poore Widdowes put openly the demaund of their goods: and the Iudges doe ſecretly demaund the poſſeſſion of their perſon.
                     So that firſt, they doe iniurie to her honor, before they do miniſter iuſtice to her demaunds.
                     Though perchaunce ſhee hath no childe, yet therefore ſhee remaineth not without any comfort: and for that the parents of her Husband doe ſpoyle her of her goods. For, in this caſe their heires oftentimes are ſo diſordered, that for a worne cloake, or a broken ſhirt, they wil trouble and vexe the poore widdowe.
                     If perchance the miſerable widdow haue children: I ſay, that in this caſe ſhee hath double ſorrow: For, if they are young, ſhee endureth much paine to bring them vp: ſo that each houre and moment theyr Mothers liue in great ſorrows, to bethinke them only of the life &amp; death of their children. Sorrowes that women haue in bringing vp their children.
                     
                     If perhaps the Children are olde, truely the griefes which remaine vnto them are no leſſe. For ſo much as the greateſt part of them are either proud diſobedient, malicious, negligent, Adulterers, gluttons, blaſphemers, falſe lyars, dull-headed, wanting witte, or ſickly. So that the ioy of the woefull Mothers is, to bewaile the deaths of their well beloued Husbands, and to remedy the diſcordes of theyr youthfull children.
                     If the troubles which remaine vnto the careful mothers with their ſonnes be great: I ſay that thoſe which they haue with their Daughters, bee much more. For if the Daughter be quicke of wit, the Mother thinketh that ſhee ſhall be vndone, If ſhee be ſimple, ſhe thinketh that euery man will deceyue her. If ſhe be faire, ſhee hath enough to doe to keepe her. If ſhee be deformed, ſhe cannot marrie her. If ſhe be well mannered, ſhe will not let her go from her. If ſhee be euill mannered, ſhe cannot endure her. If ſhe be too ſolitary, ſhe hath not wherewith to remedy her. If ſhe be diſſolute, ſhe will not ſuffer her to bee puniſhed.
                     Finally, if ſhe put her from her, ſhe feareth ſhe ſhal be ſlaundered. If ſhe leaue her in her houſe, ſhe is afraid ſhe ſhalbe ſtollen. What ſhall the wofull poor widdow doe, ſeeing herſelfe burdened with daughters, and enuironed with ſonnes, and neyther of them of ſufficient age: that there is any time to remedy them: nor ſubſtance to maintaine them? Admit that ſhee marrie one of her ſonnes, and one daughter, I demand therfore if the poor widdow wil leaue her care &amp; anguiſh? truly I ſay no: thogh ſhe chuſe rich perſonages, &amp; wel diſpoſed, ſhe cānot ſcape, but that

day that ſhee repleniſhed her ſelfe with daughters in law, the ſame day ſhe chargeth her heart with ſorrows, trauels and cares.
                     O poore widdowes, deceyue not your ſelues, and doe not imagine that hauing married your ſonnes and daughters, from that time forwardes, yee ſhall liue more ioyfull and contented: For that layde aſide, which their Nephewes doe demaund them, and that their ſonnes in Law do rob them; when the poore olde woman thinketh to be moſt ſureſt, the young man ſhall make a claim to her goods: what daughter in Law is there in this world, who faithfully loueth her ſtepmother? And what ſonne in Law is there in the world, that deſireth not to bee heyre to his father in Lawe? Suppoſe a poore widdow to be fallen ſicke, the which hath in her houſe a ſonne in Law, and that a man aske him vpon his oath, which of theſe two things hee had rather haue: eyther to gouerne his mother in Law, with hope to heale her, or to bury her, with hope to inherite her goods? I ſweare, that ſuch would ſweare, that he could reioyce more to giue a ducket for the graue, then a penny for a Phyſition to cure and heale her.
                     
                        Seneca in an Epiſtle ſayeth, That the Fathers in Law naturally do loue their daughters in Law, and the ſons A ſaying of Seneca. in Law are loued of the mothers in Law. And for the contrary he ſaieth, that naturally the ſonnes in law doe hate their mothers in Law: but I take it not for a generall rule, for there are mothers in Law which deſerue to be worſhipped, and there are ſonnes in Law which are not worthie to be beloued.
                     Other troubles chaunce dayly to theſe poore widdowes, which is, that when one of them hath one onely ſonne whom ſhe hath in ſteade of a husband, in ſtead of a brother, in ſteade of a ſonne, ſhee ſhall ſee him dye: whom ſith ſhee had his life in ſuch great loue, ſhee cannot though ſhe would, take his death with patience: ſo that as they bury the deade body of the innocent childe, they burie the liuely heart of the woefull and ſadde mother. Then let vs omit the ſorrowes which the mothers haue when their children dye, and let vs aske the mothers what they feele when they are ſicke? They will aunſwere vs, that alwayes, and as oftentimes as their children bee ſicke, the death of their husband then is renued, imagining that it will happen ſo vnto them as it hath done vnto others. And to ſay the truth, it is no maruell if they doe feare. For, the vine is in greater perill when it is budded, then when the grapes are ripe.
                     Other troubles oftentimes increaſe to the poore widdowes, the which amongſt others, this is not the leaſt: Troubles and cares incident to Widdowes. (that is to ſay) the little regard of the Friendes of her Husband, and the vnthankfulnes of thoſe which haue been brought vp with him.: The which, ſince hee was layde in his graue, neuer ented into the gates of his houſe, but to demaund recompence of their old ſeruices, and to renew and beginne new ſuites.
                     I would haue declared, (or to ſay better, briefly touched) the trauells of widdowes, to perſwade Princes that they remedie them, and to admoniſh Iudges to heare them, and to deſire all vertuous men to comfort them. For, the Charitable worke of it ſelfe is ſo Godly, that hee deſerueth more which remedyeth the troubles of the one onely: then I which write their miſeries altogether.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXXVII. Of a letter which the Emperour Marcus Aurelius wrote to a Romane Lady, named Lauinia comforting her for the death of her husband.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArcus of mount Celio, Emperour of Rome, chiefe Conſull, Tribune of the people, high Biſhop appointed againſt the Daces, wiſheth health and comfort to thee Lauinia, noble and worthy Romane matron, the late wife of the good Claudinus.
                     
                     According to that thy perſon deſerueth, to that which vnto thy husband I ought, I thinke well that thou wilt ſuſpect that I weigh thee little: for that vnto thy great ſorrowes, complaints, and lamentations, are now arriued my negligent conſolations. When I remember thy merites which cannot fayle, and imagine that thou wilt remember my good will, wherewith alwayes I haue deſired to ſerue thee: I am aſſured, that if thy ſuſpition accuſe mee, thy vertue and wiſdome will defend me: For ſpeaking the truth, though I am the laſt to comfort thee: yet I was the firſt to feele thy ſorrowes.
                     As ignorance is the cruell ſcourge 
                           
                              〈…〉
                           . of vertues, and ſputre to all vices: ſo it chaunceth oft times, that ouer much knowledge putteth wiſe mē in doubt and ſlaundereth the innocent: For as much as wee ſee by experience, the moſt preſumptuous in wiſedome, are thoſe which fall into moſt perilous vices. We find the Latines much better with the ignorance of vices, then the Greekes with the knowledge of vertues. And the reaſon hereof is, for that of things which we are ignorant, we haue no paine to attaine vnto them, and leſſe griefe alſo to loſe them.
                     My intention to tell thee this, was, becauſe that I knew that which I would not haue knowne, and haue heard that which I would not haue heard, that is to ſay, that the dayes and troubles of Claudinus thy husband are ended, and now thy ſorrowes (Lauinia his wife) doe beginne. It is now a good while that I haue known of the death of the good Claudinus my friend, and thy husband, though I did diſſemble it. And by the God Mars I ſweare vnto thee, that it was not for that I would not bewaile him, but becauſe I would not diſcomfort thee: For it were extreame cruelty, that ſhee which was ſo comfortleſſe, and ſorrowfull, for the abſence of ſo long time: ſhould bee killed with my hand, through the knowledge of the death of her ſo deſired husband. It were too vnkind and vnſeemely a thing, that ſhee, of whom I haue receyued ſo many good works, ſhould receiue of me ſo euill newes.
                     The auncients of Carthage held for An ancient Law amōg the Carthagenians. an inuiolable Law, that if the Father did tell the death of his ſonne, or the ſonne the death of the Father, or the woman the death of her husband, or the husband the death of his wife, or any other ſemblable, wofull, and lamentable death: that he ſhould bee caſt into the priſon among them, which were condemned to die. It ſeemed to thoſe of Carthage, that he which ſayde vnto another, that his brother, kinſman or friend was dead, immediately they ſhould kill him, or hee ought to dye, or at the leaſt hee ſhould neuer bee ſeene in his preſence.
                     If in this caſe the Law of the

                        Carthaginians was inſt: then I ought to be excuſed, though I haue not told this heauie newes. For as oft as we ſee him, who hath brought vs any euill tidinges: our ſorrowes by his ſight, is renewed againe.
                     Since Claudinus thy Husband dyed, I haue not had one houre of reſt, for to paſſe the time away: for feare leaſt ſuch woefull and ſorrowfull newes, ſhould come to thy knowledge. But now that I know that thou knoweſt it. I feele double paine. For now I feele his death, my care, and thy want of conſolation: and the dammage by his death ſhall followe the Romaine Empire.
                     Thou haſt loſt a noble Romaine, valiaunt in bloud, moderate in proſperities, pacient in aduerſities, couragious The life &amp; vertues of Claudinus deſcribed. in daungers, diligent in affaires, wiſe in counſels, faithful to his friends, ſubtill and wary of his Enemyes, a louer of the common-wealth, and very honeſt in his perſon: and aboue all, and wherof I haue moſt enuie is, that hee neuer offended man in his life, nor hurt any with his tongue.
                     We finde ſeldome times ſo many vertues aſſembled in one man. For ſaying the truth, if a man doe narrowly examine the vices of manie, which preſume to be very vertuous: I ſweare that he ſhould finde more to reproue, then to praiſe. Since thou haſt loſt ſo good a Husband, and I ſo faithfull a Friend: wee are bound, thou to bewaile ſo great a loſſe, and I, to ſigh for ſo good a companion. And this I do not deſire for Claudine, who now reſteth among the Gods: but for vs others, which remaine in daunger of ſo many euills. For the dead doe reſt, as in the ſure Hauen: and we others doe faile, as yet in raging Sea.
                     O thou heauy heart, how doe I ſee thee, betweene the Bell and the clappers (that is to ſay) that thou wanteſt the companie of the good: and art enuironned with the flocke of euill. For the which occaſion I doubt often times, whether I may firſt bewaile the euill which liue: or the good which are dead? becauſe in the ende, the euill men do offend vs more, which we finde: then doth the good men which we looſe. It is a great pittie to ſee the good and vertuous men dye: but I take it to be more ſorrow to ſee the euill and vitious men liue.
                     As the diuine Plato ſayeth, the gods to kill the good which ſerue them, and to giue long life to the euill which offend them, is a myſterie ſo profound, that daily wee doe lament it, and yet wee can neuer attayne to the ſecretes thereof.
                     Tell me I pray thee Lauinia, knoweſt thou not now, that the Gods are ſo mercifull, with whom we go when we dye, and that men are ſo wicked, with whom we be whiles we liue: that as the euill were borne to dye: ſo the good dye to liue. For the good man though hee dye, liueth: and the euill man though he liue dyeth,
                     I ſweare vnto thee by the Mother Berecynthia, and ſo the God Iupiter do preſerue mee, that I ſpeake not this, which I will ſpeake fainedly: which is, that conſidering the reſt that the dead haue with the Gods, and ſeeing the ſorrowes and troubles wee haue here with the liuing: I ſay and affirme once againe, that they haue greater compaſſion of our life, then wee others haue of their death.
                     Though the death of men were as the death of beaſts, that is to ſay, that ther were no Furyes nor diuels, which ſhould torment the euill, and that the Gods ſhould not rewarde the good: yet wee ought to be comforted, to ſee our friends die, if it were for no other, but to ſee them deliuered, from the thraldome of this world.
                     The pleaſure that the Pilot hath to bee in ſure Hauen, the glorie that the

captaine hath to ſee the day of victorie, the reſt that the Traueller hath to ſee his journey ended, the contentation that the workeman hath, to ſee his work come to perfection, all the ſame haue the dead, ſeeing themſelues out of this miſerable life.
                     If men were borne alway to liue, it were reaſon to lament them, when we ſee them dye: but ſince it is true that they are borne to dye, I would ſay, ſince needes dye wee muſt, that wee How little this life is to bee reſpected. ought not to lament thoſe which dye quickly, but thoſe which liue long.
                     I am aſſured that Clandine thy Huſband, remembring that which in this life hee hath paſſed and ſuffered, and ſeeing the reſt that hee hath in the other: though the Gods would make him Emperour of Rome, he would not be one day out of his graue. For returning to the worlde, hee ſhould dye againe, but being with the Gods, hee hopeth to liue perpetually.
                     Ladie Lauinia, moſt earneſtly I deſire thee, ſo vchemently not to pierce the heauens with thy ſo heauie ſighes, nor yet to wette the earth with thy ſo bitter teares: ſince thou knoweſt that Claudine thy husband is in place where there is no ſorrowe, but mirth, where there is no paine, but reſt: where hee weepeth not, but laugheth, where hee ſigheth not, but ſingeth, where he hath no ſorrowes, but pleaſures, where hee feareth not cruell death, but enioyeth perpetuall life. Since therefore this is true, it is but reaſon the widdow appeaſe her anguiſh, conſidering that her husband endureth no paine.
                     Oftentimes with my ſelfe I haue thought, what the Wddowes ought to imagine, when they ſee themſelues in ſuch cares and diſtreſſe.
                     And after my count made, I finde that they ought not to thinke of the companie paſt, nor wofull ſollitarines wherein they are preſently, and much leſſe they ought to thinke on the pleaſures of this world: but rather to remember the reſt in the world to come For the true widdowe ought to haue her conuerſation among the liuing: and her deſire to be with the dead.
                     If till this preſent thou hadſt paine and trouble, to looke for thy Husband to come home: haue thou now ioy, How little we ought to eſteeme of this life. that hee looketh for thee in Heauen: wherein I ſweare vnto thee, that thou ſhalt be better vſed of the Gods, then he was here of men. For, in this world wee know not what glorie meaneth, and there they know not what paines are.
                     
                        Licinius and Poſthumius thy vnkles, tolde mee that thou art ſo ſorrowfull, that thou wilt receiue no comfort: but in this caſe I thinke not that thou bewaileſt ſo much for Claudinus: that alone doeſt thinke thou haſt loſt him: For ſince wee did reioyce together in his life, wee are bound to weepe together at his death.
                     The heauie and ſorrowfull hearts, in this worlde feele no greater griefe: then to ſee others reioyce at their ſorrowes. And the contrary heereof is, that the wofull and afflicted heart feeleth no greater ioy, nor reſt in extream miſhappes of Fortune, then to thinke that others haue ſorrow and griefe of their paine.
                     When I am heauie and comfortles, I greatly ioy to haue my friend by me: and my heart doth tell me, that what I feele, hee feeleth: So that all which my Friend with his eyes doeth bewayle, and all that which of my griefes he feeleth, the more wherewith hee burdeneth himſelfe, and the more thereof he diſchargeth me.
                     The Emperour Octauian Auguſtus, (the Hyſtories ſay) on the riuer of Danuby, found a kinde of people which had this ſtraunge cuſtome, that with eyes was neuer ſeene, nor in bookes at any time neuer read: which was, that two Friendes aſſembled, and went to

the aulters of the Temples, and there one friend confederate with another: ſo that theyr hearts were marryed, as man and wife are marryed: touching their bodies, ſwearing, and promiſing there to the gods, neuer to weepe, nor to take ſorrow, for any miſhappe that ſhold come to their perſons. So that my friend ſhould come to lament and remedy my troubles, as if they had bin his owne: and I ſhould lament and remedie his, as if they had bin mine.
                     Oh glorious world, O age moſt happie, O people of eternall memorie! wherein men are ſo geentle, &amp; friends ſo faithfull: that theyr owne trauells they forgot, and the ſorrows of ſtrangers they bewayled. O Rome without Rome, O time euill ſpent, O time to vs others euill employed, O wretches that alwaies are careleſſe, now a dayes the ſtomacke and intrailes, are ſo ſeuered from the good, and the hearts ſo ioyned with the euill: that men forgetting Mē in their kinde, more cruell then beaſts. themſelus to be men, become more cruell then beaſts.
                     I labour to giue thee life: and thou ſeekeſt to procure my death. Thou weepeſt to ſee mee laugh, and I laugh, to ſee thee weepe. I procure that thou doe not mount, and thou ſeekeſt that I might fall. Finally, without the profite of anie, wee caſt our ſelues away: and without gaine, we doe reioyce to ende our liues.
                     By the faith of a good man I ſweare vnto thee (Lady Lauinia) that if thy remedy were in my handes, as thy griefe is in my heart: I would not be ſorrie for thy ſorrowes, neyther thou ſo tormented for the death of thy husband. But alas, though I miſerable man haue the heart to feele thy anguiſh, yet I want the power to remedie thy ſorrowes.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XXXVIII. ¶ The Emperor proceedeth in his letter, and perſwadeth widdows to put theyr willes to the will of God, and exhorteth them to liue honeſtly.
                     
                     
                        SInce thy remedie, &amp; my deſire cannot be accompliſhed, becauſe it is a thing The proſecutiō of the Emperours letter to widowes. vnpoſſible to receiue, &amp; ſpeake with the dead: and not hauing power, mee thinkes that thou and I ſhould referre it to the Gods: who can giue, much better then wee can aske.
                     O Ladie Lauinia, I deſire thee earneſtly, and as a Friend I counſell and admoniſh thee, and with all my heart I require thee, that thou eſteeme that for well done, which the Gods haue done: that thou conforme thy ſelfe to the will of the Gods, and that thou will nought elſe, but as the Gods will. For they onely knowe they erre not: wherfore they haue aſſaulted thy huſband with ſo ſudden death, and vnto thee his wife, haue lent ſo long life.
                     The Gods beeing as they are, ſo mighty, and ſo ſage, what is hee that can be iudge of their profound iudgements. The Gods knowe right well thoſe which ſerue them: and thoſe which offend them: thoſe which loue them, and thoſe which hate them: thoſe that praiſe them, and thoſe that blaſpheme them: thoſe that yeelde them thanks, and thoſe which are vnthankefull.
                     And I tell thee further, that oftentimes the Gods are ſerued more with them which are buryed in the graues, then with thoſe which goe weeping through the Temples.
                     Wilt thou now enter into account with the Gods? thou oughtſt to note

and conſider, that they haue left thee Children to comfort thy ſelfe, they haue left thee goods, wherewith thou mayeſt auoyde pouertie, they haue left thee Friends, by whome thou ſhalt be fauoured, they haue left thee parents, of whom thou art beloued, they haue left thee a good name for to be eſteemed: and health, wherewith thou mayeſt liue.
                     Finally I ſay, that ſmall is that which the Gods take from vs, in reſpect of that they leaue vs. After one ſort we ought to behaue our ſelues with men, and after another wee ought to ſerue the Gods. For to men ſometimes it is requiſite, to ſhew a countenance for to humble them: but to the Gods it is neceſſary, to lye flat on the grounde with thy ſtomacke to honour them. The dutie that euery Chriſtian 
                              ••
                           eth to God.
                     
                     And if the Oracle of Apollo doe not deceyue vs, the Gods are ſooner with humilitie, (wherewith wee worſhip them) appeaſed: then with preſumptuous Sacrifices (which wee offer vnto them) contented.
                     Since thou art widdow (Lady Lauinia) and art a wiſe and vertuous Woman: beſeech the Gods to preſerue thy children, to defend thy renowme, and not to ſeuer thy Friendes from thee, and that thou ſcatter not thy goods: to preſerue thy perſon in health, and aboue all, to bee in theyr fauour. Thou canſt not winne, nor looſe ſo much in all thy life, as the Gods can giue, or take from thee in one houre.
                     Would to GOD the widow knew, how little ſhee winneth among men, and how much ſhe loſeth among the Gods, when ſhee is not pacient in aduerſitie: For impatience oftentimes prouoketh the Gods to wrath.
                     We ſee it in mans bodie by experience, that there are ſundrie diſeaſes, which are not cured with wordes ſpoken: but with the hearbs therevnto applyed. And in other diſeaſes, the contrary is ſeene, which are not cured with coſtly medicines, but with comfortable wordes.
                     The ende of this compariſon tendeth to this effect, that all the afflicted harts ſhould know, that ſomtimes the the hart is more comforted with one benefite which they doe: then with an hundred words which they ſpeake, And at an other time, the ſorrowfull hart is more lightned with one worde of his friendes mouth: then with all the ſeruice of others in the worlde.
                     Oh wretch that I am: for, as in the one, and in the other, I am deſtitute, So in all I do want. For, conſidering thy greatnes, and weyghing my little knowledge, I ſee my ſelfe very vnable: For, that to comfort thee, I want ſcience: and for to helpe thee I want riches. But I ceaſe not to haue great ſorrow: if ſorrow in payment may be receyued. That which with my perſon I can doe, neyther with paper or iuke I will requite. For the man which with word only comforteth (in effect being able to remedy) declareth himſelfe to haue beene a fayned Friend in times paſt: and ſheweth, that a man ought not to take him for a faithfull friend in time to come.
                     That which the Romaines with the A cuſtome vſed by the Romains in viſiting widdowes. widdowes of Rome haue accuſtomed to doe, I will not preſently doe with rhee (Lady Lauinia) that is to ſay, that thy Husband being dead, all goe to viſite the Widdow, all comfort the widdow: and within a few dayes after, if the wofull widdow haue neede of any ſmal fauor with the Senate, they withdraw themſelues together, as if they had neuer knowne her Husband, nor ſeene her.
                     The renowme of Romaine widdowes is very dayntie: For of their honeſtie or diſhoneſtie, dependeth the good renowme of their perſon, the honour of their parents, the credite of their childrē, and the memory of the dead.

For this therfore, it is healthfull counſell, for wiſe men to ſpeake few words to widowes, and to doe infinite good works. What auaileth it wofull widowes, to haue their Cofers filled with letters and promiſes, and their eares ſtuffed with words, and flatteries? If hitherto thou haſt taken mee for thy neighbour, and parent of thy husband, I beſeech thee henceforth that thou take mee for a husband in loue, for father in counſell, for brother in ſeruice, and for aduocate in the Senate. And all this ſo truly ſhall be accompliſhed, that I hope thou wilt ſay: that which in many I haue loſt, in Marcus Aurelius alone I haue found. I know well (as thou dooſt in like maner) that when the hearts with ſorrowes are ouerwhelmed, the ſpirits are vexed and troubled, the memory is dulled, the fleſh doth tremble, the ſpirit doth change, and reaſon is withdrawne. And ſince that preſently ſorrow and care, in thy houſe doe remaine: let the gods forſake me, if I abandon thee, let them forget mee, if I remember thee not. But as Claudine remained thine, wholly till the houre of death: ſo Marcus Aurelius will euermore be thine, during his life. Since I loue thee ſo entirely, and thou truſteſt me ſo faithfully, and that thou with ſorrowes art ſo repleniſhed, and my heart with care ſo oppreſſed: let vs admit, that thou Lady Lauinia, haſt the aucthority to command me in thy affaires, and I licence to counſell &amp; aduertiſe thee of things, touching thy honour and perſon. For oftentimes the widowes haue more neede of a meane remedy, then of a good counſell: I earneſtly deſire thee to leaue the lamentation A cuſtome vſed among the Romane widowes. of the Romane widowes, that is to know: to ſhut the gates, to teare their haires, to cut their garments, to goe bare legged, to paint the viſage, to eate ſolitarily, to weepe on the graues, to chide her Chamberlaines, to poure out water with teares, to put Acornes on the graues, and to bite their nailes with the teeth: For theſe things, and ſuch other ſemblable lightneſſe, behooueth not the grauity of Romane Matrons, either to ſee them or elſe to know them. Since there is no extremity but therein vice is annexed: I let thee know (Lady Lauinia) if thou bee ignorant thereof, that the widowes which are ſo extreame, doe torment themſelues, doe trouble their friends, do offend the gods, do forſake theirs, &amp; in the end they profit not the dead: and to the enuious people, they giue occaſion to talke. I would thinke and me ſeemeth, that the women which are Matrons, and widowes, ought to take vpon them ſuch garment, and eſtate, the day that the gods take life from their husbands: as they entend to weare during their life. What auaileth it that a widow bee one moneth ſhut vp in her houſe, and that afterwards within a yeare ſhe is met in euery place of Rome, what auaileth it, An admonition of the Emperour to widowes to leaue off mourning. that for few dayes ſhe hideth her ſelfe from her parents, and friends, and afterwards ſhee is found the firſt at the theaters: what profiteth it, that widowes at the firſt doe mourne, and goe euill attired, and afterwards they diſpute, and complaine of the beauty of the Romane wiues? what forceth it, that widowes for a certaine time doe keepe their gates ſhut, and afterwards their houſes are more frequented then others? What skilleth it, that a man ſee the widowes weepe much for their husbands, and afterwards they ſee them laugh more for their paſtimes? Finally, I ſay, that it little auaileth the woman, to ſeeme to ſuffer much openly for the death of her husband: if ſecretly ſhe hath another husband already found? For the vertuous, and honeſt widow immediatly as ſhe ſeeth another man aliue,

ſhe renueth her ſorrow for her huſband that is dead.
                     I will ſhew thee (Lady Lauinia) a thing that befell in Rome, to the end thou thinke not I talke at pleaſure. In the olde time, in Rome there was a noble &amp; worthy Romane Lady, wife of the noble Marcus Marcellus, whoſe came was Fuluia. And it happened ſo, that this woman ſeeing her huſband buried in the field of Mars, for the great prieſe ſhe had, ſhe ſcratched her face, ſhee ruffled her haire, ſhee tore her gowne, and fell downe to the earth in a ſound, by the reaſon whereof two Senatours kept her in their armes, to the end ſhe ſhould torment her ſelfe no more. To whom Gneus

                           uius the Cenſour ſaid. Let Fuluia goe out of your hands, ſhe will this day doe all the penance of widowes Speaking the truth, I know not whether this Romane ſpake with the Oracle, or that hee were a Diuine: but I

                        ſſured that all hee ſpake came to paile. For that this Fuluia was the wiſe of ſo excellent a Romane, as that good Marcus Marceilus was: I would that ſo vnlucky a chance had not happened vnto her, which was: that whiles the bones of her husband were a burning, ſhe agreed to be married to another: and which was more, to one of the Senatours that lifted her vp by the armes, ſhe gaue her hand, as a Romane to a Romane, in token of a faithfull marriage. The caſe was ſo abhominable, that of all men it was diſpraiſed that were preſent: and gaue occaſion that they neuer credite widowes afterwards. I doe not ſpeake it (Lady Lauinia) for that I thinke thou wilt do ſo. For by the faith of a good man, I ſweare vnto thee, that my heart neither ſuſpected i

                        , nor yet the aucthority of ſo graue a Romane doth demand it: for to thee onely the fault ſhould remaine, and to me the wonder. Heartily I commend vnto thee thy honeſty, which to thy ſelfe thou oughteſt, and the care which behooueth ſo worthy and notable a widow. For if thou art tormented, with the abſence of the dead: thou oughteſt to comfort thee, with the reputation of the liuing. At this preſent I will ſay no more to thee, but that thy renowne among the preſent be ſuch, and that they ſpeake of thee ſo in abſence: that to the euill, thou giue the bridell to be ſilent: and to the good, ſpurres to come and ſefue thee. For the widow What puniſhment ought to be inflicted vpon a widow of light behauiour. of euill renowne, ought to be buried quicke. Other things to write to thee I haue none. Secret matters are dangerous to truſt, conſidering that thy heart is not preſently diſpoſed to heare newes. It is reaſon thou know that I with thy parents and friends haue ſpoken to the Senate, which haue giuen the office that thy husband had in Conſtantinople, to thy ſonne. And truly thou oughteſt no leſſe to reioyce of that, which they haue ſaid of thee, then for that they haue giuen him. For they ſay, though thy husband had neuer beene Citizen of Rome: yet they ought to haue giuen more than this, onely for thy honeſt behauiour. My wife Fauſtine ſaluteth thee, and I will ſay I neuer ſaw her weepe for any thing in the world ſo much, as ſhee hath wept for thy miſhap. For ſhee felt thy loſſe, which was very great: and my ſorrow, which was not little. I ſend thee foure thouſand ſexterces in money, ſuppoſing that thou haſt wherewith to occupy them, as well for thy neceſſaries, as to diſcharge thy debts. For the complaints, demaunds, and proceſſes which they miniſter to the Romane Matrons are greater, then are the goods that their husbands doe leaue them. The gods which haue giuen reſt to thy husband O Claudine, giue alſo comfort to thee his wife Lauinia.

                     CHAP. XXXIX. That Princes and Noble men ought to deſpiſe the world, for that there is nothing in the world but plaine deceit.
                     
                     
                        
                           PLato, Ariſtotle, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democrates, Seleucus, Epicurus, Diogenes, Thales, and Methrodorus, had among them ſo great contention to deſcribe the The opinion of ſundry Philoſophers of the deſcription of the world. world, his beginning and propertie: that in maintaining euery one his opinion, they made greater wars with their pens, then their enemies haue done with their lances. Pythagoras ſayde, that that which wee call the World is one thing, and that which wee call the vniuerſall is an other: the Philoſopher Thales ſaid, that there was no more but one World: and to the contrarie, Methrodorus the Aſtronomer affirmed, there were infinit worlds: Diogenes ſayd, that the world was euerlaſting. Seleucus ſayd, that it was not true: but that it had an ende: Ariſtotle ſeemed to ſay, that the world was eternall. But Plato ſayde clearely, that the world hath had beginning, and ſhall alſo haue ending.
                     
                        Epicurus ſayd, that it was round as a ball, Empedocles ſaide, that it was not as a bowle, but as an egge. Chilo the Philoſopher (in the high Mount Olimpus) diſputed that the world was as men are: that is to ſay, that hee had an intellectable and ſenſible ſoule.
                     
                        Socrates in his Schoole ſayeth, and in his doctrine wrote that after 37 thouſand yeares, all things ſhould returne as they had beene before: That is to ſay, that he himſelfe ſhould bee borne anew, and ſhould be nouriſhed and ſhould reade in Athens. And Dennis the Tytant ſhould returne to play the Tyrant in Syracuſe. Iulius Caeſar to rule Rome, Hannibal to conquer Italy, and Scipio to make warre againſt Carthage, Alexander to fight againſt King Darius, and ſo foorth in all others paſt.
                     In ſuch and other vaine queſtions and ſpeculstions, the auncient Philoſophers conſumed many yeares. They in writing many bookes haue troubled their ſpirites, conſumed long time, trauelled many Countryes, and ſuffered innumerable dangers, and in the end they haue ſet forth few truthes and many lyes. For the leaſt part of that they knew not, was much greater then all that which they euer knew.
                     When I tooke my penne in my hand to write the vanity of the world: my intention was not to reproue this material world, the which of the four Elements is compounded: that is to ſay, of the earth that is cold and drie: of the water that is moiſt and cold: of the ayre that is hote and moiſt, of fire that is drie and hote: ſo that taking the world in this ſort, there is no reaſon why we ſhould complaine and lament of it, ſince that without him we cannot liue corporally, When the Painter of the world came into the world, it is not to be beleeued, that he reproued the water which bare him, when hee went vpon it: nor the ayre that ceaſed to blow in the ſea, nor the earth that trembled at his death, nor the light which ceaſed to light, nor the ſtones which brake in ſunder, nor the fiſh which ſuffered themſelues to bee taken, not the trees which ſuffered themſelues to be drie, nor the monuments that ſuffered themſelues to bee opened: For the creature acknowledged in his Creator omnipotency, and the Creator founded in the creature due obedience. Oftentimes, and of many perſons wee heare ſay, O

woefull world, O miſerable world, O ſubtill world, O world vnſtable, and vnconſtant!
                     And therefore it is reaſon wee know what the world is, whereof the world is, from whence this world is, whereof this world is made, and who is lord of this world? ſince in it all things are vnſtable, all things are miſerable, all 
                           
                              〈…〉
                           . things deceitfull, &amp; all things are malicious, which cannot be vnderſtood of this materiall worlde. For, in the fire, in the aire in the earth, and in the water, in the light, in the Planets, in the ſtones, and in the Trees, there are no ſorrowes, there are no miſeryes, there are no deceytes, nor yet any malice.
                     The world wherein wee are borne, where we liue, and where we die, differeth much from the world whereof we doe complaine: for the world againſt whom wee fight, ſuffereth vs not to be in quyet one howre in the day.
                     To declare therefore my intention, this wicked World is no other thing, but the euill life of the Worldlings, the Earth is the deſire, the fire the couetiſe, the water the inconſtancie, the ayre the folly the ſtones are the pride, the flowers of the Trees the thoughts, the deepe Sea, the heart.
                     Finally I ſay, that the Sunne of this world is the proſperity, and the moon is the continuall change. The Prince of this ſo euill a world is the diuell, of whom IESVS CHRIST laid; The prince of this world ſhall now be caſt out: and this the Redeemer of the World ſayeth: For, he called the worldlings and their worldly liues the world: For ſince they be ſeruants of ſinne, of neceſſity they muſt be ſubiects to the diuell. The pride, the auarice, the enuie, the blaſphemie, the pleaſures, the leachery, the negligēce, the gluttony, the ire, the malice, the vanity, &amp; the follie. This is the worlde againſt which wee fight all our life, and there the good are princes of vices, and the vices are Lordes of the vicious.
                     Let vs compare the trauels which we ſuffer of the Elements, with thoſe which wee endure of the vices, and wee ſhall ſee, that little is the perill wee haue on the ſea and the land, in reſpect of that which encreaſeth our euill life. Is not he in more danger that falleth throgh malice into pride, then hee which by chaunce falleth from a high rocke? Is not hee who with enuie is perſecuted, in more danger then he that with a ſtone is wounded? Are not they in more perill that liue among vitious men, then others that liue among brute and cruell beaſts. Doe not thoſe which are tormented with the fire of couetouſnes, ſuffer greater danger thē thoſe which liue vnder the mount Ethna.
                     
                     Finally, I ſay, that they be in greater perils, which with high imaginations are blinded, thē the trees which with the importunate winds are ſhaken. And afterwards this world is our cruell enemy, it is a deceitfull friend, it is that which alwayes keepeth vs in trauell, it is that which taketh from vs our reſt, it is that that robbeth vs of our treaſure, it is that The deceitfulnes of the world layd open. which maketh himſelfe to bee feared of the good, and that which is greatly beloued of the euill, It is that which of the goods of other is prodigall, and of his own very miſerable.
                     Hee is the inuentor of all vices, &amp; the ſcourge of all vertues. It is hee which entertaineth all his in flatterie, and ſayre ſpeech.
                     This is hee which bringeth men to diſſention, that robbeth the renowme of thoſe that bee dead, and putteth to ſacke the good name of thoſe that bee aliue.
                     Finally, I ſay, that this curſed World is hee, which to all ought to render account, and of whom none dare aske account.
                     
                        
Oh vanitie of vanities, where all walke in vanitie, where all thinke vanitie, where all cleaue to vanitie, where all ſeemeth vanity: and yet this is little to ſeeme vanitie, but that indeede it is vanitie. For, as falſe witneſſe ſhould he beare, that would ſay, That in this Worlde there is any thing Aſſured, Healthfull, and True: as hee that would ſay, that in Heauen there is any vnconſtant, variable, or falſe thing.
                     Let therefore vaine Princes ſee how vaine their thoughts bee: and let vs deſire a vaine Prince to tell vs how he hath gouerned with him the vanityes of the world? For, if hee belieue not that which my pen writeth, let him be leeue that which his perſon proueth.
                     The words written in the booke of Eccleſiaſtes are ſuch.

                        That pleaſde him ought but aye it toucht againe
                        My ſicher of ſauours, if ought be ſmelt,
                        That might content, his would was neuer vaine.
                     
                     
                        The greedy ſighes of my deuoured breſt
                        Trauelled in thought to conquere no delight,
                        But yeelded ſtreight as wyer to the wreſt
                        To office ſuch, as wanton will be hight.
                     
                     
                        But when the doore of by abuſed eyen,
                        Where hoyſed vp with lookes and lookes againe
                        And that my eager hands, did aye encline
                        To touch the ſweete, that ſeaſon ſtill their paine.
                     
                     
                        When wanton taſt, was fed with each conceyt
                        That ſtrange deuiſe brought forth from flowing wit
                        When reſtleſſe will was ballaſt with the weight,
                        Of princely reach, that did my compaſſe fit.
                     
                     
                        I ſaw by ſearch, the ſory vnſtable bloome:
                        The blaſted fruit, the flitting ſtill delight,
                        The fickle ioy, the oft abuſed doome,
                        The ſlipper ſtay, the ſhort contented ſight
                     
                     
                        Of ſuch as ſet their heauen of ſinging life
                        In pleaſures lappe, that laugh at their abuſe
                        
                           
Whoſe froward wheele, with frowning turne is ryſe
                        To drowne their bliſſe, that blindely ſlept with vſe.
                     
                     
                        For loe, the courſe of my delighting yeares
                        That was embraſte in armes of Fancies paſt
                        When wiſedomes Sunne, through follies clowds appeares
                        Doth bluſh to heare the count that pleaſures caſt.
                     
                     
                        So now I ſee the maſſe of huge delight
                        With flattering face doth promiſe but decay
                        Whoſe flitting foote, entyced one to flight
                        His reſtles wings, doe ſeeke to ſore away.
                        Loe thus he ſlippes, reclaimde with endles paine,
                        Poſſeſt a while, departing ſoone againe
                     
                     Thus ſayeth the ſage Salomon, talking of the things of the world: the which as he ſpake of the world, ſo had hee proued it in deede, in his owne perſon.
                     Crediting, as it is reaſon to ſuch high doctrine, I cannot tell what my pen can write more in this caſe: ſince hee ſaith, that after he had all proued, Nothing in this worlde but vanitie, experimented, poſſeſſed, and taſted, he found that al we procure and haue in this worlde is vanitie.
                     Oh Noble Princes and great Lords, I beſeeche you, and in the Name of IESVS CHRIST, I exhort you, with great diſcretion, to enter into this deepe Sea: ſince this order is ſo diſordered, that it bringeth all diſorders, and euill cuſtoms. For all thoſe which ſhall trauell by the way, when they ſhall thinke to goe moſte ſure in the midſt of their iourney, they ſhal finde themſelues to be loſt.
                     None ought to agree with the world, for that hee might liue ſecure in his houſe: for day and night to all worldlings hee hath his gates open, making their entrie large and ſure. But let vs beware we enter not, and much more that wee loade not our ſelues with his vices, and be delighted with his pleaſures.
                     For, ſince we doe waxe worſe and that wee are entred therein, though wee doe repent, by no way wee finde the ſure comming out, but that firſt wee muſt well pay for our lodging.
                     I maruell not though the Worldlings at euery moment be deceyued: ſince ſuperficiouſly they beholde the The vaine hope of the worldly minded man, world with their eyes, and loue it profoundly with their hearts. But if they deſired as profoundly to conſider it, as they doe vainely followe it, they ſhould ſee very plaine, that the world did not flatter them with proſperitie, but threaten them with aduerſitie.
                     So that vnder the greateſt poynt of the Dye, which is the vi. is hidden the leaſt, which is the Aſe,
                     
                     I would counſell Noble-Princes, and great Lords, that they would not beleeue the world, nor his Flatterers, and much leſſe beleeue themſelues nor their vaine imaginations. The which for the moſt part doe thinke that after they haue traueled, &amp; heaped vp great treaſure, they ſhal enioy but their own trauel, without the trouble of any man, or that any man doe go againe them.
                     Oh how vaine is ſuch thought, and how often doth it change contrarie? The world is of ſuch an euill conditition, that if hee let vs reſt, our firſt ſleepe, as well vs, as that which wee haue gotten, immediately in the morning, yea oftentimes, an houre from thence, he awaketh vs with a new care and now he hath prepared for vs ſome meane, to occupie our ſelues about ſome other trouble.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XL. ¶ The Authour followeth his intention, and ſpeaketh vehemently againſt the deceyts of the World.
                     
                     
                        THe Emperor Traiane ſaid one day to his maiſter (which was Plutarche, the great philoſopher) The ſpeech of the Emp: Traian. Tell mee maiſter; why there are commonly more euill then good? &amp; why without compariſon, there are moe which follow vices, then thoſe which embrace vertue? The great Plutarch aunſwered. As our naturall inclination is more giuen to laſciuiouſnes and negligence, then to chaſtity and abſtinencie: ſo the men which doe enforce The anſwer of Plutarch themſelues to follow vertue are fewe, and thoſe which giue ſlacke the reynes vnto vices are manie. And know thou (if thou knoweſt it not, moſte Noble Prince) that all this euill proceedeth, that men doe followe men, and that they ſuffer not reaſon to folow reaſon
                     Feeble, and miſerable is our nature, but in the ende wee cannot deny, that for our trauells we may finde remedie in it, which ſeemeth to be true.
                     For ſo much if the ſunne doth annoy vs, we retire to the ſhadow. If we are grieued going on foote, wee doe remedy it going on Horſebacke. If the ſea be dangerous, we ſayle with ſhips. If the colde doe vexe vs, we approche neere the Fire. If thyrſt doth trouble vs, we do quench it with drinke. If the raine doth wet vs, wee goe into houſes. If the plague be in one place, wee flie into another. If we haue enemies, we comfort ourſelues with our friēds.
                     Finally I ſay, that there is no ſorrow, nor trauell, but that a man hath found ſome reſt and remedie.
                     This preſuppoſed to be true (as it is truth indeed) now I aske al the worldlings, if they haue found any remedie againſt the troubles and deceytes of this world? If I be not deceyued, and if I vnderſtand any thing of this world the remedie which the worlde giueth for the troubles, certainly are greater trauells, then the trauels thēſelues: ſo that they are ſalues, that doe not heale our wounds, but rather burn our fleſh.
                     When the diſeaſes are not very olde rooted, nor daungerous, it profiteth more oftentimes to abide a gentle feauer: then to take a ſharpe purgation: I mean, that the world is ſuch a deceiuer, and ſo double, that he doeth contrary to that he puniſheth. That is to ſay, that if hee doe perſwade vs to reuenge an iniurie: it is to the end that in reuenging that one, wee ſhould receiue a thouſand inconueniences.
                     And wheras we thinke it taketh from vs, it increaſeth infinite. So that this curſed guyde, maketh vs to belieue it leadeth vs vpon the drye land among our friends: cauſeth vs to fall into the Ambuſhments of our enemyes.
                     Noble Princes &amp; great Lords, in the thoughts they haue, and in the words that they ſpeake, are greatly eſteemed: and afterwardes in the workes which they doe, and in the affayres they trauell, are as little regarded.
                     The contrarie of all this doeth the wicked world, who with all thoſe hee How little we ought to eſteeme the flatteries of the world. acompanyeth, in his promiſes hee is very gentle: and afterwardes in his deedes, hee is very prowd. For ſpeaking the trueth, oft times it coſteth vs deere, and wee others doe ſell it good cheape.
                     I ſay much, in ſaying that wee ſell it good cheap: but in a maner I ſhold ſay better, that wee giue it willingly. For fewe are thoſe in number which carrie away wages of the world: and infinite are thoſe which doe ſerue it, onely for a vaine hope. Oh Noble Princes and great Lordes, I counſell

and require you, that you doe not truſt the world, neither in word, deed, nor promiſe, though hee ſweare and ſweare againe, that he will keepe all he hath promiſed with you. Suppoſe that the world doth honor you much, flatter you much, viſite you oft, offer you great treaſures, and giue you much: yet it is not becauſe hee will giue it you by little and little, but that afterwards he might take it all frō you againe in one day. For it is the olde cuſtome of the world, that thoſe which aboue all men hee hath ſet before: now at a turne, they are furtheſt behind. What may wee haue in this The inconſtancie of the world. world and in his flatteries, ſince wee doe know, that one day we ſhall ſee our ſelues depriued thereof? and that which is more, he vſeth ſuch craft and ſubtilty with the one and with the other, that in olde men whome reaſon would ſhould not be vicious, hee (the more to torment their perſons) hath kindled a greater fire in their hearts, ſo that this malicious world putteth into olde riches, a new couetouſneſſe: and in the aged, engendreth cruell auarice, and that in that time, when it is out of time. Wee ought greatly to conſider, how by the world we are deceiued: but much more we ought to take heede, that we be not by it deſtroyed. For whereas we thinke to be in open liberty: hee keepeth vs ſecret in priſon. Wee thinke we are whole, and he giueth vs ſickneſſe. Wee thinke wee haue all things, yet we haue nothing. Wee thinke that for many yeares long ſhall be our life, when that at euery corner we are aſſaulted of death. We thinke that it counteth vs for men that bee wiſe, when hee keepeth vs bound like vnto fooles. Wee thinke that it encreaſeth our good, when that in deede it burdeneth our conſcience. Finally I ſay, that by the way where we thinke to continue our renowne, and life: we looſe without recouery, both life and fame.
                     O filthy world, that when thou doeſt receiue vs, thou doſt caſt vs off: when thou doſt aſſemble vs, thou doſt ſeperate vs: when thou ſeemeſt to reioyce vs, thou makeſt vs ſad: when thou pleaſeſt vs, how thou diſpleaſeſt vs: when thou exalteſt vs, how thou humbleſt vs: and when thou doeſt chaſtiſe vs, how thou reioyceſt. Finally I ſay, that thou haſt thy drinkes ſo impoyſoned, that wee are without thee, with thee, and hauing the thiefe within the houſe, wee goe out of the dores to ſeeke him. Though: men be diuers in geſtures: yet much more are they variable in their appetites. And ſith the world hath experience of ſo many yeares, it hath appetites prepared for all kinde of people. For the preſumptuous he procureth honours, to the auaricious he procureth riches, and to thoſe which are gluttons, hee How the world deceiueth ſinfull men. preſenteth diuers meates. The fleſhly he blindeth with women, and the negligent he letteth reſt: and the end why he doth all theſe things, is that after he hath fed them as fleſh, he caſteth vpon them the nets of all vices.
                     Note Princes, and great Lords, note noble men, though a Prince doe ſee himſelfe Lord of all the world, hee ought to thinke that of no value is the ſeignory, vnleſſe he himſelfe be vertuous. For little it profiteth that he be Lord of the vicious: which is himſelfe the ſeruant of all vices.
                     Many ſay that the world doth beguile them: and other ſay that they haue no power againſt the world. To whom we may anſwere. That if at the firſt temptations wee would haue reſiſted the world: it is vnpoſſible that ſo oftentimes it durſt aſſault vs. For of our ſmall reſiſtance, commeth his ſo great audacity. I cannot tell if I ſhall diſſemble, I ſhall hold my peace, or whether I ſhall ſay that I would ſay,

ſince it greeueth my heart ſo much, onely to thinke of it. For I feele my eyes readier to lament it, then my fingers able to write it, It is ſo, that euery man ſuffereth himſelfe to be gouerned ſo of the world, as if God were not in heauen, and he had not promiſed to bee a good Chriſtian here in The vaine opinion of the worldly minded mē, earth. For all that he will, wee will, that which he followeth, wee follow, and that which hee chooſeth, wee chooſe. And that which is greateſt ſorrow of all, if wee doe refraine our ſelues from aduerſity, it is not for that of our owne nature wee would ceaſe from it: but becauſe the world will not command vs to doe it.
                     Little is that which I haue ſpoken, in reſpect of that I will ſpeake: which is that the world hath made vs now ſo ready to his law, that from one houre to another, it changeth the whole ſtate of this life. So that to day he maketh vs hate that, which yeſterday we loued, he maketh vs complaine of that, which we commended: hee maketh vs to bee ofended now with that, which before we did deſire: hee maketh vs to haue mortall enemies of thoſe, which before were our ſpeciall friends.
                     Finally I ſay, that the world maketh vs to loue that in our life, which afterwards wee bewaile at the houre of death. If the world did giue vnto his minions, any perfect and accompliſhed thing: it were ſomewhat that for a time a man ſhould remaine in the ſeruice of his houſe: But ſince that in the world all things are granted not during life, but as lending, which ought to bee rendred the day following: I know not what man is ſo very a foole, that in the world doth hope for any perpetuall thing? For all that he giueth, hee giueth with ſuch condition, that they ſhall render it vnto him when hee ſhall demaund it: and not at the diſcretion of him that doth poſſeſſe it. Peraduenture the world can giue vs perpetuall life? I ſay certainly no. For in the ſweeteſt time of all our life, then ſodainly we are aſſaulted of cruell death. Peraduenture How ſuddē
                           ly Death aſſaulteth vs, the world can giue vs temporal goods in aboundance? I ſay certainly no. For no man at any time had ſo much riches: but that which hee wanted was more, then that hee poſſeſſed. Peraduenture the world can giue vs perpetuall ioy? I ſay certainly no. For exempting thoſe dayes which wee haue to lament, and alſo the houres which we haue to ſight: there remaineth not for vs one moment to laugh. Peraduenture he can giue vs perpetuall health? I ſay certainly no. For to men of long life, without compariſon the diſeaſes are more which they ſuffer: then the yeares are which they liue. Peraduenture the world can giue vs perpetuall reſt? I ſay certainly no. For if the dayes be fewe, wherein we ſee the elements without cloudes: fewer are the houres, which wee feele our hearts without cares.
                     Therefore ſince that in this miſerable world there is no health perpetuall, nor life perpetuall, nor riches perpetuall, nor ioy perpetuall. I would knowe what it is that the worldlings would of the world, ſince they know that it hath no good thing to giue them, but onely by lending, or by vſurie? If it be vſurie, there is no gaine of money: but rather returne, with reſtitution of vices.
                     O children of vanity, O maiſters of lightneſſe, ſince it is ſo, that ye now determine to followe and ſerue the world: looke not of the world to haue any thing, but things of the world. In it is nothing but pride, enuie, leacherie, hate, ire, blaſphemy, auarice, and folly. And if ye aske if he haue in his gouernance any vertuous thing, hee will anſwere you, that hee doth neuer ſell ſuch merchandize in his ſhop.

Let no man thinke that the world can giue vs that, which it hath nor for it ſelfe. And if wee will chaunge any thing with it, and it with vs: hee is ſo ſubtill to ſell, and ſo curious to buye, that that which hee taketh ſhall be of great meaſure, and that which hee ſelleth vs, ſhal want much weight.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XLI. ¶ Of a Letter which the Emperour Marcus Aurelius wrote vnto his friend Torquatus, to comfort him in his baniſhment, which is notable, for all men to learne the vanities of this World.

                            if the Emp: Marc: Aur. 
                        Gaietta, wiſheth all health to thy perſon, and ſtrength againſt thy euill Fortunes. I beeing in the Temple of the Veſtall virgines, about three moneth ſince, I receyued a Letter of thine: the which was in ſuch ſorte, that neyther mine eyes for that time could make an ende to read it, or ſince I haue had the heart to anſwer it. For in the incōnueniences of our friends, if we haue no facultie nor might for to remedie it, at the leaſt we are bound to bewayle it. Thy ſorrow maketh me ſo heauie, thy paine doeth trouble mee ſo much, I am ſo carefull of thy anguiſh, ſo tormented with thy griefe, that if the Gods had giuen power to wofull men to imparte theyr ſorrowes, as they haue giuen to rich men to imparte their goods: by the faith I owe to God, I ſweare, that as I am the greateſt of thy Friendes, I would bee hee which ſhould take the moſt parte of thy griefes.
                     I know right well, and as well as he that hath proued it, that aſmuch difference as there is betweene the ba
                           •
                        ke and the tree, the marow and the bone, the corne and the ſtraw, the gold, and the droſſe, the trueth and the dreams: ſo much is there to heare the Trauells of another, and to taſte his own. Notwithſtanding, comfort thy ſelfe, my friend Torquatus: for where the friends bee true, the goods and the euills are common betwixt them.
                     Oftentimes with my ſelfe I haue maruelled, to what ende or intention, the immortall Gods haue giuen Trauell, and torments to men, ſince it is in their powers to make vs liue without them. I ſee no other thing, why the miſhaps ought paciently to bee ſuffered: but becauſe in thoſe, wee know who are our faithfull friendes. In battell the valiant man is knowne, in tempeſtuous weather the Pylot is known, by the Touch-ſtone the gold is tryed, How a true friend is to be knowne, and in aduerſitie, the true Friende is knowne.
                     For my friende doth not enough to make me merrie, vnles alſo he doth take part of my ſorrow. I haue heard ſay here, and now by thy letter I haue ſeene, how they haue baniſhed thee from Rome, and confiſcated thy goods, and that for pure ſorow thou art ſicke in thy bed: wherof I maruel not that thou art ſicke, but to be as thou art aliue. For ſaying to thee the Trueth, where the heart is ſore wounded, in ſhorte ſpace it hath accuſtomed to yeelde vp vnto the bodie. I ſee well, that thou complayneſt, and thou haſt reaſon to complain, to ſee thy ſelfe baniſhed from Rome, and thy goods confiſcate, to ſee thy ſelfe out of thy countrey, without any parentage: yet therfore thy ſorrowes ought not to be ſo extreame, that thou ſhouldſt put thy life in hazzard. For hee alone ought to haue licence, and alſo is bounde to hate life, which doeth not remember

that hee hath ſerued the Gods, nor hath done any profite to men.
                     If the affayres of the Empire did not occupie me, and the Emperiall Maieſtie did not withdraw me: I would immediately The loue of Marcus Aurelius to his friend, haue come to comforte thy perſon, where thou ſhouldeſt haue ſeen by experience, with what griefe I feele thy troubles. And therefore, if thou takeſt mee for thy friende, thou oughteſt to belieue of mee, that which in this caſe I would of thee (which is) that as thou haſt been the moſt entier Friend which I had in Rome: So is this the thing that moſt I haue felt in this life.
                     Tell me my friend Torquatus, what is it thou ſuffereſt there, that I do not lament here? It may be that ſometime thou laugheſt, but I alwayes weepe: ſometimes thou comforteſt thy ſelfe, but I am alwayes ſad. It may be that thou lightneſt thy paine: but I am in ſighing. It may bee that ſometimes thou caſteſt from thee ſorrow: but for mee I cannot receyue conſolation. It may bee that thou hopeſt remedie of long life: but for mee I finde no remedie more healthfull, then preſent death. Finally (I ſay) that here I feele all that thou feeleſt there: and furthermore, I ſuffer all that, which as a friend I ought to ſuffer here: ſo that both our paynes are made one moſte cruell ſorrowe, wherewith my woefull life is tormented. I would greatly deſire to come and ſee thee, and to help to disburden thee of this charge.
                     And ſince it is vnpoſſible that thou ſhalt finde ſome comfortable wordes: For, thou knoweſt, that if the true Friendes cannot doe that which they ought: yet they doe accompliſh it, in doing that they can.
                     If my memory deceyue me not, it is well two and thirty yeares ſince we two haue known together in Rome, during the which, Fortune hath made here betweene vs diuers alterations, in the which time I neuer ſaw thee one day contented. For if thou were ſad, nothing did make thee merrie, but wert as a man without taſte:: and if thou were ioyfull, thou eſteemedſt it little, as a man being troubled. Therefore if the trueth be ſo (as indeed it is) that in trauells thou were loden with ſorrows, and in proſperities thou wert euill content, ſo that of nothing in the world thou takeſt any taſte: why is it (my friend Torquatus) that now again thou art in deſpaire, as if thou cameſt new into this world? Thou didſt reioyce thy ſelfe xxxii. yeares, with the Triumphes and proſperitie of Rome: and thou complaineſt onely of three moneths, that Fortune hath been contrary vnto thee.
                     O Torquatus, Torquatus, doſt thou The conſiderations that euery man ought to haue, knowe that the wiſe men (in whome wiſedome raigneth) haue more feare of two vnhappie dayes in this life: then of two hundreth of proſperous Fortune?
                     Oh how many haue I ſeene go out of their proſperities, with the charges of another man, and theyr owne proper vices: ſo that the vaine-glory and the fayling proſperities endured fewe dayes: but the griefe of that they haue loſt, and the enmities which they haue recouered, endure many yeares.
                     The contrary of all this commeth to vnfortunate men, which eſcape out of their tribulations, ſpoyled of vices, enuironed with vertues, perſecutors of euills, zealous of good, friends of all, and enemyes of none: contented with theirs, and not deſiring others. Finally, they are eſcaped wiſely from the ſnare, and haue gathered the Roſe, not hurting themſelues with the prickes.
                     What wilt thou that I ſay more vnto thee, but that the moſt Fortunate ate vanquiſhed in peace: and the vnfortunate are conquerors in warre.
                     One of the Sentences which moſte

haue contented me, of thoſe which the Auncients haue ſpoken, is this, of the diuine Plato, That thoſe which are in proſperity haue no leſſe need of good counſell, then the vnhappy haue of remedie; For no leſſe doe they trauell, which goe alwayes in the plaine way, then thoſe 
                        A worthy ſaying of Plato. 
                        which mount on the ſharpe craggy mountaine.
                     
                     According to that I haue gathered of thy letter, mee ſeemeth that when we hope moſt reſt, greateſt trauel hath ſucceeded to thee. And hereof I doe not maruell, nor thou oughteſt not be offended: for as experience teacheth vs, when the trees haue the bloſſoms, then they are moſt ſubiect to the froſt: and when glaſſes are drawne out of the furnace they breake. The Captaines hauing won the victorie, doe die. When they will put the key in the dore, the houſe doth fall. The Pirates periſh within the kenning of land,
                     By that I haue ſpoken, I meane, that when wee thinke to haue made peace with fortune, then ſhee hath a new demaund ready forged. All new changes of Fortune, cauſeth all wayes new paine to the perſon: but often times it is cauſe of more great fortreſſe: for the tree beareth not ſo much fruit where it firſt grew, as there where againe it is planted: and the ſauours are more odoriferous, when they are moſt chafed. I meane that men of high thoughts, the more they are wrapped in the frownings of Fortune, the more valiant and ſtout they ſhew themſelues. The man vtterly is fooliſh, or hath great want of vnderſtanding, who hopeth at any time to haue perfect reſt, imagining that the World will giue no aſſault vpon him: but that the time ſhall come, wherein hee ſhall bee without care and feare.
                     This miſerable life is of ſuch condition, that dayly our yeares doe diminiſh, and our troubles encreaſe. O Torquatus, by the immortall Gods I doe deſire thee, and in the faith of a friend I doe require thee, thou being borne in the world, nouriſhing thy ſelfe in the world, liuing in the world being conuerſant in the world, being a child of the world, and following the world, what didſt thou hope of the world but things of the world? Peraduenture, thou alone wilt eate the fleſh without bones, giue battell without perill, trauell without paine, and ſayle by the ſea without daunger. I meane, that 
                           •
                        s vnpoſſible for mortall men to liue in the world, vnleſſe No man in ſafety to long as hee liueth in this world. they will become ſubiect to the ſorrowes of the world. The world hath alwayes been the world, and now the world ſhall be after vs, and as a world ſhall handle the worldlings.
                     The wiſe men, and thoſe which of their eſtates are carefull, are not contented to ſee, nor ſuperficialy to know the things: but rather waigh them profoundly. I ſay this, becauſe if thou kneweſt thy debelity, and kneweſt fortune, and her chaunge, if thou kneweſt the men, and their malices, if thou kneweſt the world and his flatteries, thou ſhouldeſt winne no little honour, where as otherwiſe thou mayes chance to get infamie. Wee are now come to ſo great folly, that wee will not ſerue the Gods which haue created vs, nor abſtaine from the World which perſecuteth vs: And the beſt is, that hee not willing vs (but rather reiecting vs) we ſay, that of our owne willes wee will loue and ſerue him: and yet knowing that thoſe which longeſt haue ſerued the world, do goe out of his houſe, moſt bitterly lamenting. Oftentimes I ſtay for to thinke, that according to the multitude of men which follow the world (beeing alwayes euill handled of the World) if the World did pray them as hee doth annoye them, if

hee did comfort them, as he doth torment them, if he kept them, as he baniſheth them, if he exalted them, as he abuſeth them, of he receyued them, as he expelleth them, if he did continue them as he conſumeth them: I thinke that the Gods ſhould not be honoured in heauen, nor the temples worſhipped in the earth.
                     O Torquatus my friend, that which I will now ſay of thee, thou mayeſt ſay of mee: that is to ſay, how much wee put our confidence in fortune, how lewdly wee paſſe our dayes, and how much wee are 
                           •
                        inded in the world: yet for all that we credite his word as much, as though hee had neuer mocked any.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XLII. Marcus Aurelius goeth on with his Letter, and by ſtrong and high reaſons perſwadeth all that line in the world, not to truſt the world, nor any thing therein.
                     
                     
                        TEl l mee I pray thee Torquatus, what wilt thou hear more? What wilt thou ſee more? and The Emperour perſwedeth mē to truſt in the world what wilt thou know more? to know the world? ſeeing how vntill this preſent thou haſt beene handled of the world, thou demaundeſt reſt, and he hath giuen thee trouble: thou demaundeſt honour, and he hath giuen thee infamie. Thou demaundeſt riches, and he hath giuen thee pouerty: thou demaundeſt ioy, and hee hath giuen thee ſorrow. Thou demaundeſt to be his, and hee hath giuen thee his hand. Thou demandeſt life, and hee hath giuen thee death: Therefore if it be true, that the world hath handled thee in this wiſe, why doeſt thou weepe to returne againe to his wicked houſe? O filthy worlde, how farre art thou from iuſt: and how farre ought they to bee from thee, which deſire to be iuſt: For naturally thou art a friend of nouelties, and enemie of vertues. One of the Leſſons which the world readeth to his children is this: that to be true worldlings they ſhould not bee very true: The which experience plainely ſheweth vs, for the man which medleth much with the world, leaueth alwayes ſuſpition of him that hee is not true: The World is an Ambaſſadour of the euill, a ſcourge of the good, chiefeſt of vices, a tyrant of the vertuous, What the world is compared vnto. a breaker of peace, a friend of warre, a ſweete water of vices, the gawle of the vertuous, a defendor of lyes, an inuentor of nouelties, a trauellour of the ignorant, a hammer for the malitious, a table of gluttons, and a furnace of concupiſcence. Finally, it is the perill of Charibdes, where the harts doe periſh: and the danger of Scylla, where the thoughts doe waſte.
                     Preſuppoſe that theſe he the conditions of the world. The truth is, that if there bee any worldling who complayneth to be euill content with the world, ſhall he therefore chaunge his ſtile? Truly no and the reaſon is, that if perchaunce one worldling ſhould goe out the houſe of the world, there are x. thouſand vanityes at his Gate:
                     I know not what wiſe man will liue in the World, with ſuch conditions, ſince the vices wherewith wee doe reioyce our ſelues are very fewe, in reſpect of the torments which we ſuffer. I ſay not that we doe heare it by heare-ſay, and reade them in bookes: but wee ſee with our owne eyes, the one to conſume and waſt the goods: others by miſfortune to fall and loſe their credite, others to fall and looſe

their honour, and others to looſe their life: and all theſe miſeryes ſeene, yet neuertheles, euery man thinketh to be free by priuiledge, where there is none priuiledged.
                     Oh my deare Friend Torquatus, of one thing I aſſure thee, which is: that the men which are born of women are ſo euill a generation, and ſo cruell is the world wherein we liue, and Fortune ſo empoyſoned, with whome wee frequent: that we cannot eſcape without beeing ſpurned with his feete, bitten with his Teeth, torne with his nayles, or empoyſoned with his venome.
                     Peraduenture thou mayeſt ſay vnto mee that thou haſt ſeene ſome in Rome which haue liued longtime, Fortune neuer beeing againſt him. To this I anſwere thee, that thou oughtſt rather to haue pittie vppon him, then enuie: For it is not for his profite, but for his great hinderance. For the World is How malicious &amp; vnconſtāt the world is, ſo malicious, that when it ſeemeth to bee moſt our Friende, then it worketh vs moſt diſpleaſure.
                     The healthfull men dye rather of a ſhort diſeaſe in fewe dayes, then the drye and feeble men doe, with a diſeaſe of many yeares. By this compariſon I meane, that ſince man cannot eſcape, nor liue without trauell: it is much better, that by little and little he taſteth them, then they enter al at one time into his houſe.
                     Oh how much ought the man to be hated of the immortall Gods: who knoweth not what trauell meaneth in this world? For hee onely ought to feare Fortune, who knoweth not Fortunes force.
                     Since the Gods would permit, and thy miſhap hath beene ſuch, that thou haſt found more daunger, where thou thoughtſt moſt ſurety, as a man euillfortuned: it is reaſon that wee applye vnto thee ſome newe ware, to the end thou loſe not thy good renowm, ſince thou haſt loſt thy euill goods.
                     Tell mee I pray thee (Torquatus) why doeſt thou complayne as a man ſicke? why cryeſt thou as a foole? why ſigheſt thou as a man in deſpaire? and why doeſt thou weepe as a Childe? Thou art come out of the way: And thou complainſt to haue loſt thy way. Thou ſaileſt by the broyling Seas: and thou wondereſt that the Waues doe aſſault thee. Thou haſt aſcended the ſteepe and craggie Mountaines: and thou complaineſt that thou art weary. Thou walkeſt by the thornes, and wilt not that thy gowne be torne.
                     Didſt thou thinke on the top of the high Mountaine to liue moſt ſure? By that I haue ſpoken, I will aske what diligent ſeruice thou haſt done to the world, that thou wouldſt the Gods of heauen ſhould recompence thee?
                     Wouldeſt thou of Fortune a ſafe conduct, ſhee being (as ſhee is) enemie of manie, Nature being not able to giue it, the which is mother of all?
                     Oh my Friend Torquatus, that which that pittifull Nature cannot promiſe Fortune &amp; Nature two contrary enemyes. thee, didſt thou thinke that Fortune, (which is the iuſt ſtep-mother) ſhould giue?
                     It is vnpoſſible that the Sea ſhould always promiſe vs ſurety, and the heauens cleareneſſe, the Summer deawes, and the Winter, Froſts. Marke well, my Friende Torquatus, that all naturall things are ſubiect to chaunge euery yeare: but all the Worldlings ought to endure, to Eclipſe euery moment.
                     Since the naturall Gods cannot alwayes be in one mans cuſtodie, being neceſſarie, it is iuſt that the goods of Fortune periſh, ſince they are ſuperfluous. Vniuſt ſhould the Gods bee, if that which is to the damage of ſo manie, they had made perpetuall: and that which is to the profite of all, they had made mortall. I will no more reduce to thy memorie, the proſperities which thou haſt had in times paſt: before

that we treate how Fortune handleth thee at this preſent.
                     The deceytfull Fortune, when at thy gate ſhe ſold her Marchandiſe, knowing that ſhee ſoldevnto thee, and thou being ignorant of that thou boughtſt: ſhe gaue thee fruitfull ground, and afterwards made it vnto thee painefull. Shee hath giuen thee ſower for ſweet, and the ſweete ſhee hath returned to the ſower. Shee hath giuen thee the euill for the good: and where that thou haſt ſolde her good, ſhee returneth vnto thee euill. Finally ſhee hath beguyled thee in the iuſt price, thou not ſuppoſing that thou hadſt receyued any damage. Wee can doe no leſſe in this caſe but to haue compaſſion vpon thee: yet though they condemne malicious Fortune for ſelling, they will note thee ſimple in buying. For in the ſhoppe of Fortune, all Marchandize are ſuſpicious.
                     Oh vnhapie that we are, I ſay thoſe which meddle with the Word: for in his Market they ſee nought but lyes, and wee doe not truſt but in the ouerthrowes of our renowme: which are not paide, but with the coſt of our life. And the factours of that Fayre, giue vs nothing by weyght or meaſure: for they are a ſort of vacabondes: And the worſt of all is, knowing that they ought to loſe with Fortune, all ſeeke to buye at her ſhoppe.
                     Giue thy ſelfe to the Worlde, loue the world much, ſerue the world well, followe the world well, and feele the world well: For, in the ende of thy Doe what thou canſt at laſt the world will deceyue thee, iourney, the world requireth thee to be like vnto his inconſtancie.
                     I would enter into count, not with the Worlde, which in the ende is the world: but with the worldlings which are in loue with the world. For, in thè ende, eyther it is good or euill. If the world be good for them, whereof doe they complaine? If he be euill, why do they follow him? They cannot (though they would) denie one of the two errours, wherein the worldlings fall: that is to ſay, that they ſerue an euill maiſter, or that they murmure of a good lord.
                     Now tell mee, my Friend Torquatus, what didſt thou hope, ſince thou madeſt ſo long time a countenaunce to the world? Two and thyrtie yeares thou haſt ſerued the worlde, and haſt been in his fauour: wherefore it were now high time, that between thee and him were ſome diſcord. For between the Grand-fathers and the Nephews, between the Father and the children, between the vnkles and the nephews, daylie we ſee great ſtrifes: And didſt thou thinke, that betweene thee and Fortune, perpetuall peace ſhould be?
                     Shee gaue not to Belus, king of the Aſſyrians, but lx. yeares of proſperity. To the queene Semiramis, ſixe onely. To Label King of the Lacedemonians,

                     To the great Alexander of Macedony, fowre. To the great Amilcar, King of Carthage, two. To our Iulius Caeſar, one: and to infinite others, ſhee gaue not one.
                     If the world were pacient, he ſhould be no world, if the world were conſtant, hee ſhould bee no world, if the world were ſober, hee ſhould bee no world, if the world were true, he ſhold be no world, if the world were corrigible, he ſhould be no world. Finally I ſay, that for nought elſe the world is world, but becauſe there is nothing in him worthy to be beloued: and many things in it deſerueth to bee reproued. If thou wert wiſe, and knewſt any thing of the world, in all the diſcourſe of thoſe xxxii. yeares, thou hadſt not eaten without care, nor hadſt gone without guyles, and hadſt not ſpoken without ſuſpicion, nor ſlept without aſſault, nor truſted any friende.
                     For the Warre, men doe bethinke them all wayes wherein their enemies

doe beguile them, wherein they themſelues may fayle, and wherein fortune may let them. I know not if it be that the world of himſelfe bee happy, or that the Worldlings are fooles: For if one ſtranger, one neighbour, or our proper brother doth enuy vs, we will neuer (thogh he do require vs) pardon him, and wee ceaſe not to follow the world, though wee know he perſecuteth vs. So that wee draw our ſwords againſt flies: and will kil the Elephants with needles. There is no greater ill in the world, then to thinke all things in the world are in extremitie: for if wee be abaſed, we ſigh alwais to mount, &amp; if we be high, we weepe alwayes for feare of falling. Such ouerthrowes hath the world, and his ſnares are ſo ſecret, that we are no ſooner ſhipped but wee ſee both our hands and feete entangled with vices: by the which our libertie is brought into ſuch extreme and cruell captiuitie, that wee bewayle our miſhaps with roaring voyce as brute beaſts, but as men wee dare not once vtter them. I know not whereof this commeth, for ſome I ſee which willingly fall, and other I ſee which would recouer themſelues. I ſee diuers that would bee remedyed, and I ſee all do complaine, but in the end I ſee no man that doth amend.
                     Theſe things I haue written vnto thee, for no other thing, but becauſe from henceforth thou ſhouldſt liue more circumſpectly: for as thou know eſt, I ſay nothing, whereof I haue not long experience.
                     The colt which thou haſt ſent mee is prooued verie good, eſpecially for that he leapeth very well, and for the careere hee is exceeding ready, and hath a comely grace. I ſend thee two thouſand ſexterces, wherewith thou mayſt releeue thy neceſſities.
                     Finding opportunitie, as touching thy baniſhment I will ſpeake to the Senate in thy behalfe. I ſay no more to thee, but that the conſolations of the gods, and the loue of the gods be with thee Torquatus.
                     
                     The malice of the euill, and the ire of the furies, bee abſent from mee Marcus. My wife Fauſtine ſaluteth thee and in her behalfe, and mine, recommend vs to thy faire daughter in law Solophonia, and thy daughter Amilda. Marke of Mount Celio, writeth to thee Torquate, with his owne hand.

And of the lawes which the Romaines made in this behalfe.
                     
                     
                        
                           LIcurgus Promotheus, Solon, and Numa Pompilius famous inuentors and ordayners of Lawes, ſhewed the ſubtilty of their wits, and the zeale which they had to their people, in ordaining many Lawes which they taught: not onely what they ought to doe: but that which they ought to flye.
                     For the good and expert Phyſitions doe deſerue more prayſe for to preſerue vs before we are ſicke: then to heale vs after that wee are diſeaſed.
                     
                        Plutarch in his Apothegmes Plutarch commendeth the Lacedemonians in obſeruing their lawes neuer ceaſeth to exalt the Lacedemonians, ſaying, That when they did obſerue their Lawes, they were the moſt eſteemed of all the Greekes,

and after they brake them, they were the moſt vyleſt Subiects, which euer the Romanes had, The felicitie or infelicitie of Realms, doth not conſiſt to haue good or euill Lawes, but to haue good or euill Princes: For little profiteth vs the Lawes to be iuſt, if the King be wicked.
                     
                        Sextus Cheronenſis in the life of Nero ſaith: When the Romaines and the Greekes had warres together, and that the Embaſſadours of thoſe two Nations were at controuerſie, which of them ſhould haue the Rhodians to bee their Friends? The Greeke Embaſſadour ſayd to the Romain: Yee ought 
                        A ſaying of Plutarch, 
                        not to make your ſelues equall. O Romains, with the Greekes, ſince the truth is, that ye came from Rome to Greece to ſeeke Lawes. The Romaine Embaſſadour aunſwered him: I graunt thee, that from Rome we ſent to ſeeke Lawes in Greece, but thou wilt not denye, that from Greece you haue brought the vices to Rome. I ſay vnto thee the truth, that without compariſon, greater damage haue the vices done vnto vs, then your Lawes hath profited vs.
                     
                     
                        Plutarch in an Epiſtle hee wrote to Traiane, ſaide theſe words: Thou writeſt vnto me (moſt noble Prince) that thou art occupyed in ordayning newe Lawes: but in my opinion it had beene much better, that thou hadſt kept, and cauſed to be kept the olde. For, little profiteth it to haue the Bookes full of good Lawes, and that the Common-wealth bee full of euill cuſtomes. I haue ſeene very fewe Princes but to make Lawes they had abilitie ſufficient: and to keepe them, they haue felte in themſelues great debilitie, and weakeneſſe.
                     
                     Hereof we haue example: For, Nero was he which made the beſt Lawes in Rome: and that afterwards of life was moſt corrupt. For, the Gods oftentimes permit, that by the handes of ſome euill men, the others ſhould bee conſtrained to bee good.
                     
                     
                        Plutarche ſaith further. If thou wilt (Noble Prince) truſt thine owne vnderſtanding, in my poore counſell, in fewe wordes, I would recyte vnto thee all the ancient lawes. I wil ſend thee very briefe and ſweete Lawes: not to the ende thou ſhouldeſt publiſh them in Rome: but to the ende thou keepe them in thy houſe. For ſince thou haſt made Lawes for all, I will make Lawes for thee.
                     
                     
                        The firſt Law is, that thou behaue thy ſelfe in ſuch ſort, that thou bee not detected 
                        The laws of Plutarche. 
                        of any notable vice: For, if the Prince bee vertuous in his Pallace, none dare be diſſolute in his houſe.
                     
                     
                        The ſecond Lawe is, that equally thou keepe Iuſtice, as well to him which liueth farre off, as to him which is neere about thee: For, it is much better that thou depart of thy goods to thy Seruants, then that thou ſhouldeſt giue that Iuſtice, which appertaineth to others.
                     
                     
                        The third Law is, that thou delight in word and deede to be true: and that they take thee not in this defaulte to ſpeake too much: For Princes which in theyr words are vncertaine, and in theyr promiſes doubtfull ſhall be hated of theyr Friends, and mocked of their enemyes.
                     
                     
                        The fourth Law is, that thou bee very gentle of behauiour and conditions, and not forgetfull of ſeruices done: For vnthankfull Princes are hated of GOD, and deſpiſed of men.
                     
                     
                        The fifth Lawe is: that as a Peſtilēce thou driue and chaſe awày from thee all cunning Sycophantes and Flatterers: For, ſuch with theyr euill life, doe diſturbe a whole Common wealth: and with theyr Flatteryes doe obſcure and darken thy Renowme.
                     
                     
                        If thou (moſt Noble Prince) wilt obſerue theſe fiue Lawes: thou ſhalt neede to make no more Lawes. For, there is no neede of other Lawes, in the Common wealth, then to ſee that the Prince bee of good life, &amp;c.
                     
                     This wrote Plutarche to the Emperour Traian: and euery vertuous man

ought to haue them writen in his hart.
                     I was willing to touch this Hiſtorie, onely to ſhewe the profite of this laſt Law, where it ſayeth: that Princes admit into their conuerſation no Flatterers: of whom it is reaſon wee talke of now. For ſo much as there are diuers men, with whom they loſe theyr time, and ſpend their goods.
                     When Rome was well ordered, two Officers were greatly eſteemed to the Romaines: The one was the maiſters of Fence, which were as men that fought &amp; tourned, and many times in that fight they were ſlaine. And the cauſe to inuent this play, was: to the Wherfore the Romans eſteemed Fencers. end young men (not expert in warre) ſhould ſee the Swords drawne, ſharpe ſpeares, ſhooting of Croſſe-bowes, to giue blowes with their Sword, ſhead bloud, to giue cruell woundes, and to ſley men: For, in this ſorte they loſt feare, and in going to the warres they recouered courage.
                     The man which hath once paſſed a Fourd in the water, though it be in the night, dare paſſe it againe: But hee which hath neuer paſſed it ouer, although it be in the day, dare not once aduenture it. I mean, that the Romanes were very Sage, to ſhewe vnto theyr children the dangers, before they did put them therein. For, this is the difference betweene the fearfull hart, and the couragious ſtomacke: in that the one flyeth from a diſtaffe, and the other is not afraid of a ſword.
                     The ſecond Office which was eſteemed in Rome was, that of the Iugglers, Ieaſters, Comediants, and of ſuch others, which inuented playes and paſtimes: and the Romaines deuiſed theſe ſports, to reioyce the people: &amp; in eſpecially men of warre, whom they feaſted at their going foorth, and much more at their cōming home. For the Romains thinking that they ſhould be with ſuch glorie receyued: went with determination, either to winne the victorie, or to dye in battell.
                     The ancients and true Romains had ſuch care for the Common-wealth of their people, that they conſented that Ieaſters ſhould ieaſt, Iugglers ſhould iuggle, and the Players of Enterludes ſhold play: But this was not through abundance of vanitie, nor for want of grauitie, but to take from the Plebeians 
                        An ancient cuſtome among the Romaines, occaſion of idlenes, and to keepe them occupyed in other particular Playes: they would that al the pleaſures ſhold bee taken together: Not without cauſe (I ſay) that the pleaſures were taken in common: that is to ſay, that no Romaine could play any Playes particularly, make any Bankets, repreſent Comedyes, nor make any Feaſts, beſides thoſe which they made to reioyce the whole people: ſo that in Rome they trauelled ſeuerally, and reioyced together. I would to GOD that ſuch, and ſo excellent a Romaine cuſtome were obſerued in our Chriſtian Common-wealth.
                     But now I am very ſorrie that indifferently Rich and poore, great and ſmall, doe play Comedyes, runne the Bulles, make iouſts, ordeyne bankets, weare deuiſes, feaſt the Ladyes, ſpend in bankets, and inuent Feaſtes.
                     The which things altogether, doe redound to the damage of the Commonwealth, to the waſte of the goods, and to the corruption of the māners: For, the particular paſtimes doe increaſe new vices to breede in men.
                     Theſe Players did ſerue in Rome to make paſtime, at the great Feaſtes of their Gods: For ſince Romaines were great worſhippers of their Gods, and ſo carefull of their Tēples, they ſought to feaſt them all the wayes they could inuent. Truly this was done by the diuine ſufferance: for their Gods being laughing-ſtocks (as indeed they were) the liuing GOD would they ſhould be ſerued, honoured, and feaſted, by Ieaſtures and mocks. Blondus in the third

booke De Roma triumphante, mentioneth that which I haue ſpoken, and ſayth, That the Romanes were no leſſe curious to giue lawes to the Iuglers and ieſters which went mocking vp and downe Rome, then to the captaines which were fighting in the warre: For though they did permit Ieſters, players and ſuglers, to exerciſe The reaſon wherefore the Romās allowed Ieſters, their offices: yet they did commaund them that their liues might be vpright and iuſt. Amongſt others, ſuch were the Lawes which the Romaines ordayned for theſe Ieſters, Iuglers, Players and Tumblers.
                     The firſt Law was, which they commanded that they ſhould all bee knowne and examined, to ſee if they were honeſt men, wiſe and ſage: for the more their offices were vaine, ſo much the more they prouided, that they were giuen to wiſe men.
                     The ſecond Law commanded to examine them, to ſee if they were able and comely to exerciſe their offices: and indeed in this caſe, as well as in the other, they had reaſon, as very a foole as hee which for harkening to a foole not pleaſant, as the foole himſelfe.
                     The third law was that they did not permit any Romane Iugler for to exerciſe ſuch feates, vnleſſe hee had ſome other craft: ſo that if they occupyed the Holy dayes to play and ſhew paſtime in the ſtreetes, the other dayes they ſhould work at home at their houſes.
                     The fourth Law was, that no Iugler nor Vice ſhould be ſo hardy in his oſtentation to ſpeake any malices: &amp; indeed it was a Law very neceſſary: For oftentimes they are few which doe reioyce at their mockeries: and many which doe complaine of theyr malices.
                     The fift Law was, that no Iugler nor Ieſter ſhould bee ſo bold to make any paſtimes in any particular Houſes but in open places: for otherwiſe thoſe which ſpake them became hardy, and thoſe which heard them were vicious.
                     The Romanes not contented to haue made theſe Lawes ordayned that the Iuglers for no paſtimes ſhewed, or any other thing ſpoken ſhould Allowance giuen by the Romans to Iuglers. bee ſo bold as to receiue any money: And to auoid their complaints, and to ſatisfie their paines, they allowed euery one of them a thouſand ſexterces yearely out of the common treaſure.
                     Wee ought greatly to praiſe the prouidence of the Romanes, which haue preſcribed a kinde of life for the Ieſters to liue, euen as they did to other men of Rome, and to the Captaines of warre. And in this place no leſſe then in an other graue thing, they ſhewed their wiſedome: For a Gouernour of a Common-wealth trauelleth more to correct fools, then to gouerne the ſage.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XLIIII. How ſome Ieſters were puniſhed by the Auncients, and of the Ieſters, and Loyterers of our time.
                     
                     
                        
                           IVlius Capitolinus in the booke of the manners of the ancients ſayth, that in times paſt, the Ieſters and Iuglers were greatly eſteemed. And wee will not deny but that they had reaſon, ſince with them they honoured the gods they tooke their pleaſures, they reioyced their feaſts, they were very quicke men, not importunate, nor couetous.
                     The Ieſter hath no grace, vnleſſe

immediately a man putteth his hand to the purſe. We find ſome fragments of an Oration which Cicero made in the Senat, greatly reprouing the Senators, and all the people, becauſe they ſo willingly gaue eare to this Ieſter, who ſtirred vp ſedition among the Commons, his name was Roſcio, who was ſo greatly eſteemed in Rome, that the Romaines did more willingly heare that which hee ſayde in his Ieſts, then that which Cicero ſpake in good earneſt. This Ieſter Roſcio and Cicero ſtriued which of them both were of greater wit, Roſcio for preſenting a thing with diuers ieſts, or Cicero pronouncing waighty matters in earneſt.
                     When I read in Iulius Capitolinus that which I haue ſpoken, I will not ceaſe to confeſſe my innocency, for that I could not then keepe my ſelfe from laughing, to ſee that Roſcio being Prince of folly, did preſume to The difference betweene Roſcio the Ieſter and Cicero, diſpute with Cicero, which was Father of eloquence: Sith all theſe thinges are vnſtable in one, ſo from one day to another wee ſee them chance. The Romanes did greatly eſteeme the policy of the Common-wealth, the diſcipline of warre, the nurture of children, the exerciſe of the young, and the honeſty of the Players and Iuglers, the which in time came to bee diſſolute, that very oft they were occaſion of great ſlaunder among the people. The which by the Romanes ſeene and conſidered, and that the Ieſters which were wont to ſhew them pleaſures, were cauſe of diſſention (&amp; where all they commaunded them to be reſident in their offices, they were vagabonds, and that vſing them as ſages, they liued as loyterers &amp; fooles, &amp; not contented with that they gaue them of the common Treaſure, but they went begging of euery man) the Senate of Rome determined among themſelues to baniſh all the Iuglers, and Ieſters out of the Commonwealth.
                     On this execution of theſe loyteterers, ſprang diuers diſſentions among the people: For the Princes which were good, caſt them out, and thoſe which were euill called them in: So that one of the tokens which were in Rome, to know a verruous or vitious Prince, was to ſee if hee maintayned Ieſters, Iuglers or vagabonds among the people.
                     
                        Plutarch in his Apothegmes ſayeth, that the Lacedemonians did neuer Permit any iugler or Ieſter to be in the Common-wealth. And when one A good and ancient Law amōg the Lacedemonians. did demaund a Lacedemonian, by an Ambaſſadour of Rhodes, what was the occaſion to make ſuch a law, ſince that the Ieſters and players ſhewed pleaſure to the people, and the people loſt nought but laughed at their folly: The Lacedemonian anſwered; Licurgus ſaw, heard, felt, or read ſome great damage, the Ieſters, Iuglers, or Players, might doe in the commonwealth, ſince againſt them hee made this ſo ſtraight a law: But that which I know is that wee Greekes are better weeping with our Sages, then are the Romanes laughing at their fooles Dio in the life of Traian declareth, that there came a Iugler to Rome from Africke, whoſe conuayance was ſo cleane, that it was a wonderfull thing to ſee what feates he did and to he are what words he ſpake.
                     And when they prayed the good Emperor Traian, that it would pleaſe him to heare him, he anſwered. It is not for the authority of a graue and vertuous Prince, that in his preſence any ſuch vaine thing ſhould be ſhewed: For in ſuch a caſe, hee ſhould be no leſſe noted of lightneſſe, then the other accuſed of folly.
                     And further he ſayde, Before princes a man ſhould not be ſo hardy to ſpeake diſhoneſt wordes, nor ſhewe

light repreſentations. And in ſuch caſe as much paine deſerue they which moue him thereto: as thoſe which doe repreſent them: For a man ought not to put before Princes the things which ſhould allure them to vices, but things which ſhould moue them to vertues.
                     Certainely theſe words were worthy of ſuch a perſonage. Suetonius Tranquillus in the life of Auguſtus declareth, that in Rome there was a Ieſter very pleaſant, and of an excellent wit, called Epifanius, who one day vpon a Holy day to ſhew the Emperour ſome pleaſure, and hoping to haue a good reward, went to the Pallace at one time in the attire of a Page, and another time in the habite of a Romane Matrone: and ſo truely counterfeyted euery thing, that it ſeemed not to be him, but the ſelfe ſame perſon her repreſented.
                     The Emperour Auguſtus was greatly diſpleaſed with that the Ieſter had done, and commaunded forthwith that hee ſhould be whipt three times about the Theater. And when hee complained, that the Emperor commaunded vacabonds to be whipped once, and he thrice: the Emperour Auguſtus anſwered, Once they ſhall 
                        Puniſhment infflicted by Auguſtus vpon a Ieſter. 
                        whippe thee, for the iniurie thou diddeſt to the Roman matron whom thou diddeſt sepreſent. The ſecond time they ſhall whipp thee for the preſumption that thou haſt to repreſent it before my perſon. The third for the time that thou haſt made diuers loſe for beholding and hearing thee: For Ieſters doe not deſerue ſo much puniſhment in the Ieſtes and mockeries they doe ſay, as for the time which they loſe, and cauſe others to loſe.
                     
                     Certainely, the puniſhment which was giuen to the Ieſter, was very iuſt, and exceeding good were the words which Auguſtus ſayde. There was an other in the time of Auguſtus, whoſe name was Pilas, And when the Emperour had baniſhed all the Ieſters and Iuglers from Rome, this Pilas was ſo pleaſant and merry with all perſons, that with great inſtance they beſought the Emperour to reuoke that ſentence. And the requeſt indeed was ſo great, as if it had beene for a Philoſopher, they could not haue done more.
                     For vaine and light men, employ rather that they haue on him, who bringeth vnto them ſome folly, then on one which teacheth and correcteth their life. The Emperour condiſcended to the requeſt of the people, on ſuch condition, that they ſhould giue a Maſter and Tutor vnto Pilas that ſhould chaſtice and correct him as a foole; ſaying, That ſince Sages tooke fooles to be their Maſters, that the fooles alſo ſhould haue Sages for theyr Maſters.
                     
                     The caſe was that one day he that had the charge of Pilas, did rebuke him for certaine lightnes that he had done, whereat Pilas was exceeding wroth with him: The which the Emperour vnderſtaunding, commanded he ſhould be whipt and baniſhed for euer.
                     When Auguſtus gaue this ſentence they ſay, he ſaid theſe words: Rome hath been mighty &amp; puiſſant inough, to make her enemies ſtoope, and now ſhee is not able to baniſh Ieſters and fooles. And 
                        An other worthy ſentence of the Emperour Auguſtus, 
                        that that is worſt of all, they haue preſumption to vexe vs, and wee haue not courage to reproue them. The Lacedemonians had great reaſon, and alſo the Romanes, to rid their commonwealth of Ieſters: for they are idle, vitious, diſhoneſt, malicious, and preiudicial to the common-wealth: theſe Ieſters and Iuglers are idle: ſeeing that more then others they eate the ſweate of others. They are vitious, for they cannot exerciſe their offices but in vices, and in treating with vitious men.
                     
                        
They are diſhoneſt, for they get not to eate by doing good works, but by ſpeaking diſhoneſt words. They are malitious, for they haue accuſtomed when they loue not a man, immediatly to ſpeake euill of him: They are vnprofitable for the common wealth for they mocke vs and ſell vs vaine words, and wee pay them good money.
                     The world is come to ſo great The vanity of men in maintaining Ieſters &amp; ſuch idle perſons: folly and corruption, that euen as graue and wiſe men thinke it great inconuenience, to be conuerſant with vaine and fond men: ſo the Lordes of Eſtate thinke it an honour, to haue in their houſe, ſome fooliſh Ieſters, yea better to ſay (with reuerence of ſpeech) rayling knaues, which ſpeake not to pleaſe, and ſhew paſtime, but to offend the preſent, and rayle at the abſent, as well of the high as the low: and that that is more yet then this, is that they are not contented to haue giuen this entertainement and welcome to the Noble men and Gentlemen that are at their Lordes boorde: but they muſt needs haue a caſt at my Lord himſelfe to cheare him withall: which intollerable abuſe ought not to be ſuffred, but with moſt ſharpe correction puniſhed.
                     But what ſhall wee ſay, that for the moſt part the Lords are ſo vaine, and the Ieſters ſo preſumptuous and arrogant, that the Lords haue more care to content them, then they haue to pleaſe the Lords. In the houſe of a Lord, a foole at the end of the yeare will aske more then any other of thoſe which are moſt auncient, ſo that the follies of the one are more acceptable then the ſeruices of all. It is ſhame to ſpeake it, and no leſſe for to write it, that the children of vanity are ſo vaine, that they bribe a foole or a Ieſter no leſſe in theſe dayes, to the entent he may bee a meane for them vnto the Prince, then they did in times paſt deſire Cicero, to make an Oration for them before the Senate. It is for want of vnderſtanding, and through the vilety of the perſon, oppreſſion of the heart, and diſprayſe of renowne, to be deſirous by the means of fooles, to attaine to any thing: For he can haue no great wiſdom which putteth his hope in the fauour of a foole.
                     What remaineth for me to ſay, when I haue ſayde that which I will ſay? And it is, that if a Ieſter or foole ſay openly to ſome Lord, God ſaue your life, my good Lord. Oh hee is a Noble man indeed, he will not ſticke to giue him a gowne of ſilke: and entring into a Church, hee would not giue a poore man a halfe penny.
                     O what negligence is there of Princes? O what vanity of Lordes? ſince they forſake the poore and wiſe, to enrich the Ieſters and fooles: they haue enough for the world, and not for Ieſus Chriſt: they giue to thoſe that aske for his Louers ſake, and not to thoſe which aske for the health of the ſoule.
                     Hee ought not to doe ſo: for the Knight which is a Chriſtian, and not a worldling, ought rather to will that the poore doe pray for him at the houre of death, then that the fooles and Ieſters ſhould prayſe him in his life.
                     What doth it profite the ſoule, or the body, that the Ieſters do praiſe thee for a cote thou haſt giuen them: and that the poore accuſe thee for the bread thou haſt denied them? Peraduenture How neceſſarie it is to bee beneficiall to the poore. it will profite thee as much that a foole or a flatterer goe before a Prince apparrelled with a new liuerie of thine: as the poore man ſhall do thee damage before God, to whom thou haſt denyed a poore ragged ſhirt? All Gentlemen, and Noble Parſonages, in the name of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, I admoniſh, exhort,

and humbly require, that they conſider well what they ſpend, and to whom they giue: for the good Princes ought to haue more reſpect of the neceſſities of the poore, then of the follyes of counterfeytes.
                     Giue as yee will, diuide as yee liſt, for at the houre of death, as much as yee haue laughed with the fooles, for that yee haue giuen them, ſo much ſhall yee weepe with the poore, for that you haue denyed them. At the houre of death it ſhall bee grieuous paines to him that dyeth, to ſee the fleſh of the Orphanes all naked, and to he holde counterfaite fooles loden with their garments.
                     Of one thing I am amazed, that indifferently euery man may become a foole, and no man let him; and the worſt of all is, if once a foole become couetous, all the world afterwards cannot make him to bee in his right ſences. Truely ſuch one which hath no reaſon to bee a foole, at the leaſt he hath good occaſion: ſince hee getteth more to eat playing, then the others doe by working. O what negligence of the Princes, and what ſmal reſpect of the Gouernours of the Common wealth is this? that a yong How hatefull Ieſters and loyterers ought to be in a Commonwealth. man, whole, ſtoute, ſtrong and valiant, ſhould be ſuffered to goe from houſe to houſe, from table to table, and onely for babling vaine wordes, and telling ſhamefull lyes, hee ſhould bee counted a man of an excellent tongue? Another folly there is in this caſe, that their words are not ſo fooliſh, as their deedes are wicked though they haue a good or euill grace, yet in the end, they be counted in the Common wealth, as loyterers and fooles. I know not whether in this caſe is greater, eyther their folly, or our lightneſſe: for they vſe vs as fooles, in telling vs lyes, and wee pay them good money.
                     The Romanes did not permit in their Common wealthes, olde ſtale Ieſters, nor wee Chriſtians ought to retaine into our houſes idle loiterers: Yee ought to know, that more offendeth A cuſtome vſed by the Romanes, worthy to be vſed of euery Nation: hee which ſinneth with a deformed woman, then hee which ſinneth with a beautifull Lady. And he which is drunke with ſowre Ale, offendeth more then hee which is drunke with ſweet wine.
                     And ſo in like manner, greater offence commit they which loſe their times with fooles that haue no grace, then with Ieſters which haue good wits: for it may be permitted ſometime, that the Sage man for the recreation of his Spirits, doe frequent the company of ſome pleaſant man.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XLIV. Of a Letter which the Emperour wrote to Lambertus his friend, Gouernour of Helleſpont, certifying him that he had baniſhed from Rome all fooles, and loytering Players: and is diuided into three Chapters: a notable Letter for thoſe that keepe counterfeyte fooles in their houſes.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArcus Aurelius onely Emperour of Rome, Lord of Aſia, confederate with Europe, friends of Affricke, and enemy of the wars, wiſheth health to thee Lambert, Gouernor of the Iſle of Heleſpont. With the furres which thou didſt ſend mee, I haue cauſed my gowne to be furred, and am girded with the girdle which thou didſt preſent me, and am greatly contented with thy hounds: For all is ſo good, that the body doth reioyce to poſſeſſe it, and the eyes to beholde

it, and alſo the heart to render thanks for it. Where I did aske a few things of thee in ieſt, thou haſt ſent me many in earneſt, wherein not as a ſeruant but as a friend thou haſt ſhewed thy ſelfe: For the office of noble and worthy hearts, is to offer to their friends, not onely that which they demaund, but that alſo which they doe thinke they will demaund. Truly thou haſt better meaſured thy ſeruices by thy nobleneſſe: then I thee demaund by my couetouſneſſe: For if thou doeſt remember, I did demaund of thee onely 12. skinnes, and thou haſt ſent mee 12. dozen. I tolde thee that I deſired 6. hounds for to hunt, &amp; thou haſt ſent mee 12. of the beſt that can bee found in the Iſle. In ſuch ſort, that I had honour, and thou haſt wonne renowne: For in the little I haue demaunded, thou ſhalt ſee my little couetouſneſſe: and in the much thou haſt ſent mee, they ſhall perceiue thy great liberalitie. I eſteeme highly that which thou haſt ſent mee, and I beſeech the Gods ſend thee good lucke. For thou knoweſt wee may render thankes for the benefits receiued, but we haue not the power to requite the gentleneſſe ſhewed. For the man which dare receiue of another any gift, doth bind himſelfe to be his ſlaue. I cannot bee thy ſlaue, for I am thy friend, and thereof thou oughteſt to reioyce, more then another. For being a ſeruant, I ſhould ſerue thee with feare, but being a friend, I will profite thee with friendſhip.
                     Therefore to declare the chiefe occaſion wherefore I write vnto thee at this preſent, I ſay, I ſend thee three The cauſe wherefore the Emperour wrote this letter. ſhips loden with Ieſters and Iuglers, Loyterers, Vacabondsand fooles: and yet I do not ſend vnto thee all the vacabonds which are in Rome, for then thy Ile ſhould be peopled with ſtrangers. The office that they had, was that ſome of them ieſted and rayled at the table, ſome ſang ſundry malicious ſongs at mariages, others told lies and newes for their dinners at the gates, others played common playes in the ſtreetes, other entertained the Romaine matrons with folliſh nouels and tales, others ſet forth vaine and light bookes of rymes and ballets, &amp; yet I ſweare vnto thee by the God Hercules, theſe Loyterers wanted no fooles to heare them. I let thee know my friend Lambert, that theſe Loiterers are ſuch, and their Schollers in number ſo many, that though the Maſters may be in 3. ſhips carried, yet the Schollers could not be in an hundred tranſported.
                     Of one thing I maruell much, and alſo I affirm, that the Gods be offended, ſince the earthquakes ouerthrew the houſes, the great waters carry away the bridges, the froſt freeſe the vines, the corrupt ayre infecteth the Wiſe men: and yet there is no plague that conſumeth the fooles? O how vnhappy art thou Rome, vnto him that The Emperour bewayleth the folly of the Romanes. ſhall well behold thee, and diligently ſearch thee: For in thee wanteth valiant Captaines, honeſt Senators, iuſt Cenſors, faithfull officers, and vertuous Princes: and onely there aboundeth fooles, Ieſters, Players, Dicers, Loyterers, and vagabonds,
                     O what ſeruice thou ſhouldſt do to the Gods, and profite to our mother Rome. if for three ſhips of fools, thou didſt ſend vs one barke onely of wiſe men? I would not ſay, (but I will not ceaſe to ſay) that I haue ſeene fooles, that I haue heard many follies, but I neuer ſaw ſo great fooles, nor heard ſuch extreme folly, as that of ſome noble Romanes and Italians, who thinke it a great act to keepe a foole in their houſe. I iudge him to be a greater foole, that deſireth to keepe a foole, then the foole himſelfe: for a foole hath a ſēblance of the ſage, after hee accompanieth with a Sage: but

the Sage ſheweth himſelfe a foole, after hee accompanieth with a foole. Why doe men ſeeke things of mockerie? ſince all that is in the World is mockerie? Why ſeeke wee fooles, ſince all that we ſay, is nothing but folly? Why doe wee reioyce with thoſe that flatter vs, ſince there are none that ſay one onely truth? Why doe we ſeeke fained fooles, ſince that all, or the moſt part of vs all, are very fooles? I ſee diuers in Rome, the which though they company with honeſt men, are diſſolute, companying with Sages they are ſimple, treating with wiſe men, they are without conſideration, and being conuerſant with fooles, they thinke to be ſage: if we keepe company with pittifull. wee ſhall be pittifull.
                     If wee be conuerſant with the cruell, Such company as mē haunt, the ſame ſhall they ſhew in their life. wee ſhall bee cruell: If wee communicate with lyers, we ſhall be lyers: If wee haunt the true, we ſhall be true: and if wee deſire the fooliſh, we ſhall be fooles: for according to the maſters and doctrines we haue, ſuch ſhal be the ſciences which we ſhall learne, and the works which wee ſhall follow.
                     The famous tyrant Dionyſius the Syracuſane, which was in Scicill, ſayde vnto the Philoſopher Diogenes.
                     
                     Tell mee Diogenes, what kinde of men ought we to haue in our houſes: and with what perſons ought wee to diuide our goods?
                     
                        Diogenes anſwered him. The wiſe man which will liue in peace with the Common wealth, and that will not ſee his goods euill employed, ought not to giue to eate, nor to accompany with any, but with the aged perſons which ſhould counſell them, &amp; with the young which ſhould ſerue them, with friends which ſhould fauour them, and with the poore, to the end they ſhould prayſe them.
                     
                        Dennis the tirant greatly commended that which Diogenes the Philoſopher told him: but hee could neuer profit with that counſell: for as he ſhewed himſelf a tyrant in robbing: ſo he ſhewed himſelfe alſo vndiſcreet in ſpending. Preſuppoſe that which Diogenes the Philoſopher ſpake were true, that is to ſay, that we ought to To what ſorts of people men ought to giue to eate. feede the aged ſeruants, friends and poore.
                     Wee ſee by this anſwere, it is not iuſt to giue to eate, eyther to Ieſters, Paraſites, Flatterers, Loyterers or fooles. Firſt, mee ſeemeth, that a man ought not to thinke that fooles are capable to giue counſell, ſince they haue it not for themſelues: for it ſhould bee great folly to vſe men as Sages, which of their owne will haue made themſelues fooles.
                     The ſecond, mee ſeemeth that it is a vaine thing to thinke, that the Ieſters ſhould ſerue as ſeruants: For theſe vnhappy people, to flye trauel onely, haue taken vpon them this office ſo ſlaunderous.
                     Thirdly, it ſeemeth to bee a ſhamefaſt thing, and of great inconuenience that any Noble and ſage man ſhould determine to haue any Flatterer or Ieſter for his familiar friend: for ſuch ought not, nor cannot be counted among the true friends, ſince they loue vs not for the vertue we poſſeſſe, but for the goods which we haue.
                     Fourthly, me thinketh it a vaine thing to thinke, that vnder the colour of pouerty it ſhould be iuſt, to giue meate to Ieſters or Loyterers; for we cannot ſay, that ſuch are poore, for that they want riches, but that folly aboundeth in them.
                     Since therfore a man is defamed to haue ſuch Ieſters, Flatterers, for friends, and that for beeing ſeruants they are vnable, and without witte to aske them counſell: mee thinketh it a great folly to ſpend his goods on ſuch loyterers: For as their intentions

to the Gods onely are manifeſt, and to men ſecret: ſo there is nothing wherein the good do approue, and manifeſt their intentions to bee good or euil, more then in the words which they ſpeake, and in the Companies which they keepe.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XLVI. Marcus Aurelius goeth forward with his letter, and declareth how he found the ſepulchres of many learned Philoſophers in Heleſpont, whereunto hee ſent all theſe Loyterers.
                     
                     
                        I Will thou know Lambert that thy Iſle is conſecrated with the bones of many excellent men the which were baniſhed by ſundry tyrannous Princes of Rome. The Ancients greatly commend that Iſle, becauſe there are therein ſtones called Amatiſts, tame Deere, faire women, familiar wolues, ſwift dogs of feet, &amp; pleaſant fountaines.
                     Yet notwithſtanding, I will not ceaſe to commend theſe things which reioyce thoſe that bee preſent, and The Emp: cōmendeth the iſle of Heleſpont. alſo comfort thoſe that bee to come: For I eſteeme more the bones which the earth do couer: then the riches, which groweth thereon. If thou haſt not loſt the ſence of ſmelling, as that Iſle doth ſauour vnto mee of Sages: ſo doth Rome ſtinke of fooles: For, for the time it is leſſe paine to endure the ſtinke of the beaſt: then to heare the words of a foole. When the wars of Aſia were ended, I returned home by that Iſle, wherein I viſited all the liuing people, and all the graues of the dead Phyloſophers. And for a truth I tell thee Lambert, that that iourney was very troubleſome vnto mee: for herein my perſon endured much paine, on the land I ſuffered diuers daungers, and on the Sea I ſaw my ſelfe in ſundrie perills.
                     In the citie of Corinthe (where thou art reſident at this preſent) in the middeſt of the Market-place, thou ſhalt find the graue of the phyloſopher Panimio, to whome the ſtraight friendſhip auayled little, which he had with Ouide: but the enmitie greatly endammaged him which hee had with Auguſtus the Emperour. Two myles from Theadfonte, at the foote of the How reuerently the Sages were eſteemed in former time mountaines Arpines, thou ſhalt finde the graue of the famous Oratour Armeno, who was by the Conſul Scylla vniuſtly baniſhed. And of trueth, as heere was much bloud loſt, becauſe Scylla ſhould not enter into Rome: ſo there were not fewe teares ſhedde in Italie, for the baniſhment of this learned Phyloſopher.
                     In the gate of Argonauta, harde by the water, on the top of a high Rocke, thou ſhalt finde the bones of Celliodorus the philoſopher, who obſerued all the auncient lawes: and was a great enemy of thoſe which brought in new cuſtomes and ſtatutes.
                     This good Phyloſopher was baniſhed, in the proſperity and furie of the Marians: not for the euils they found in him, but for the vices hee reproued in them. In the fields Heliny, there was a great tombe, within the which were the bones of Selleno the phyloſopher, who was as well learned in the vii. Liberall-arts, as if hee himſelfe had firſt inuented them.
                     And hee was baniſhed by the Emperour Nero: for becauſe he perſwaded this cruell Emperour to bee mercifull, and pittifull. In the fieldes Helini, out of the Woods, towardes the weſt parte, thou ſhalt finde the graue of the phyloſopher Vulturnus:
                        
a man in Aſtrologie profoundly learned, which little auayled him in the time of his baniſhment. For hee was baniſhed by Marcus Antonius: not for that Marcus Antonius would haue baniſhed him (for hee was not offended by him) but becauſe his loue Qu. Cleopatra hated him, as her mortall enemie. For Women of an euill life, doe commonly reuenge their angrie hearts, with the death of their eſpeciall friends.
                     Diuers other Tombes in that iſle I ſaw, the names whereof though in wryting I haue them: yet at this preſent I cannot call them to memorie. The noble minded reſpect antiquities. Well, by the faith of an honeſt man I ſweare vnto thee, that thou ſhalt finde all true which I haue tolde thee.
                     Now I tell thee Lambert, that I viſiting thoſe graues, theyr Diſciples did not beare them greater obedience, when thee were aliue, then I did reuerence now they are dead. And it is true alſo, that in al that time mine eyes were as much wet with teares, as their bones were couered with earth.
                     Theſe worthy and learned Phyloſophers were not baniſhed, for any miſchiefes by their perſons committed, nor for any ſlaunders they had done in the common-wealths: but becauſe the deeds of our fathers deſerued that they ſhould be taken from their companie: and we their children were not worthie, to haue the bones of ſuch famous and renowmed Sages in our cuſtodie.
                     I cannot tell, if the enuie I haue to that iſle bee greater: or the pittie I haue of this miſerable Rome: for the one is immortall by the graues of the dead, and the other is defamed with the bad life of the liuing.
                     I deſire thee hartily as a friend, and doe commaund thee as a ſeruant, that thou keepe the Priuiledges, which I gaue to that Iſle, without breaking any one. For, it is very iuſt, that ſuch cities, peopled with ſuch dead, ſhould be priuiledged of the liuing: By this Centurion, thou ſhalt knowe all things which are chaunced amongſt the priſoners.
                     For, if I ſhould wryte vnto thee all the whole matter as it was done: I enſure thee, vnto mee it would be much paine to wryte it, and vnto thee great trouble to read it. It ſuffiſeth preſently to ſay, that the day of the great ſolemnitie of the Mother Berecynthia, a What vnloked for miſchiefes ariſe at ſuch meetings. ſlaunder aroſe in Rome, by the occaſion of theſe Ieſters, Scoffers, &amp; Loyterers: and by the faith of a good man, I ſweare vnto thee, that the bloud which was ſhead through the places, ſurmoūted the wine which was drunk at the Feaſt. And thinke not that which I ſay to be little, that the bloud which was ſhedde, ſurmounted the wine that was drunke.
                     For, as thou now knoweſt, the Cittizens are come to ſo great follie: that he which was on that day moſt drunk, they ſayde that hee had offered vnto the Gods greateſt ſacrifices. I am yet afrayde to remember the crueltyes, which that day I ſaw with mine owne eyes: But I am much more aſhamed of that which they talke of vs in ſtraunge Realmes.
                     For, the Noble and worthie hearts, doe not account it ſo much, to receyue a great wound: as to take it of a cowardly man.
                     There is great difference betweene the Nettes wherewith they vſe to take Byrdes, and no leſſe is there betweene the hookes, wherewith they take Fiſh. I meane, that the knife which cutteth the Fleſh, differeth much from the knife which hurteth the heart. For, the hurts of the bodie, with Surgeons helpe may bee healed: but the Gods onely are the phyſitions of the perills of the heart.
                     I behelde and ſaw Rome, which was neuer vanquyſhed by valiaunt men, at

that day ouercome by loyterers. Rome which could neuer bee won by thoſe of Carthage, is now wonne by Ieſters, Players and Vacabonds: Rome which triumphed of all the Realmes, is now vanquiſhed of the loyterers, Ieſters and idle perſons.
                     Finally, wee ſaw that Rome which in times paſt gaue lawes to the barbarous, is now become the ſlaue of fooles: In this caſe I haue beene ſo troubled, that I cannot tell what to ſay, and leſſe what I write vnto thee: One thing comforteth me, that ſince Rome and her Romanes doe not reioyce themſelues but with fooles, that ſhee and her children be not puniſhed but by the hands of fooles. I thinke not that in this caſe the Gods do any wrong, if Rome which laughed thorough mockery at the players, doe weepe one day with the loyterers in good earneſt.
                     Thou mightſt demaund me Lambert, ſince wee other Princes are bound to maintaine equall iuſtice with all: wherefore wee doe diſſemble many offences which others haue done in earneſt, and yet wee will not pardon thoſe Ieſters, ſince al that they haue inuented, was for mirth and paſtime? I promiſe thee, though their offences were great indeed, yet I doe not baniſh thē ſo much for the bloud they haue ſhed, as for the good orders which they haue peruerted.
                     Once againe I returne to ſay vnto thee, that I haue not baniſhed them ſo much for becauſe they were occaſion The reaſon wherefore the Emperour baniſhed fooles and loyterers. of murthers, as to be teachers of all lyes. Without comparriſon greater is the offence to the gods, &amp; greater is the damage to the Commonwealth to take away (as the loyterers haue done) the ſenſes of wiſe men, then that which the murtherers doe, to take life from their enemies.
                     The end of theſe Ieſtes, Scoffers, Iuglers, idle men, and thoſe kind of raskalr, is alwayes to perſwade men that they ſpeake continually in mockeries, treat continually in mockeries, and to ridde them of their ſorrowes, and all this is but to deceiue them of their goods.
                     In the which caſe I ſay, and ſo pleaſed it the gods, that they ſhoulde content themſelues with the goods, without robbing vs of our wiſedome. When Scipio the Affrican had ended the warres of Affricke, he went thorow Rome, accompanied not with valiant Captaines, but with the Players, Ieſters, and Iuglers. The which a Philoſopher ſeeing, ſayde vnto him theſe words.
                     O Scipio, according to the much they haue talked of thee, and the little I ſee in thee, it had beene better thou hadſt dyed in Affricke, then to come to Rome: for thy high Acts in thy abſence did aſtoniſh vs, and thy lightnes in thy preſence doth offend vs. To thee it is great infamie, and to the ſacred Senate little honeſty, that thou hauing conquered ſo mighty Princes in Affricke, ſhouldſt goe accompanied with fooles and mad men in Rome. I let thee to vnderſtand, that thy Life had not then ſo much perill among thy enemies, as thy honour hath at this preſent among fooles.
                     Theſe words were very good, although The reward a poore Philoſopher had for ſpeaking truth. they were euill receyued of humane malice: for by reaſon of theſe words, the poore aged Philoſopher was baniſhed by the friends of Scipio, out of Iraly, and ſent to the Iſle of Heleſpont.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XLVII. The Emperour endeth his Letter, and ſheweth the cauſe and time, why, and when theſe Ieſters and Iuglers were admitted into Rome.
                     
                        AFter that theſe Loyterers &amp; vagabonds ſhall land in thy Iſle thou ſhalt let them goe at liberty, and ſhalt take none of their goods: but thou ſhalt aduertiſe them that they be not ſo hardy to exerciſe their craftes nor feates: For if they doe the contrary thou mayeſt make them loſe their life in thy Iſle, which I haue conditionally pardoned here in Rome. One thing I commaund thee, and I beſeech thee forget it not, that is to ſay, that thou compell them to labour, and that in no meanes thou ſuffer them to bee idle.
                     For idlenes is the mother of all vices in the perſon, and the cauſer of all ſlanders which ariſe in the common Idlenes the mother of all vices. wealth.
                     Since wee knowe not but to labour, and the loyterers knowe not but to loyter: I would ſay, that with more reaſon they might ſay, that we were not ſage, then wee might ſay, that they are fooles. For wrongfully are they called fooles, which by craft eate the ſweat of others: ſeeing the little regarde wee haue to theſe Loyterers, and conſidering how much we preſume: by the faith of a good man I ſweare vnto thee Lambert, that with greater reaſon they ſhould mocke our workes, then wee others ſhould laugh at their words: for they profite more with our goods, then we doe of their folly. In the 251. of the foundation of Rome a ſore plague came into Italy. The which being ended, they determined to tell not the thouſands of men that were dead, but the ſmall number of thoſe which remained aliue. Rome afterwards being ſo ſolitarie, and Italy ſo deſolate, onely to reioyce the people, and to the end the Cities ſhould not remaine vnhabited: the firſt Theaters were inuented, and then firſt were theſe players receyued: For vntill that time the Romans knew no other thing, but to offer ſacrifice to their gods in the temples, and to fight againſt their enemies in the fields. O lamentable thing to heare, that this plague laſted onely 24. monethes, and the rage and folly of theſe players and idle men hath endured more then 53. yeares. Would to the immortall gods that the plague had ended thoſe few which remaine, before this curſed generatiō had broght ſo abominable cuſtomes into Rome: For much better had it beene for our mother Rome, that ſhe had wanted inhabiters, then ſuch raskals ſhould haue come and dwelled therein.
                     I know Lambert, that thoſe perſons doe greatly complaine of mee, &amp; that the complaints which they do in the beginning, ſhall not haue an ende there: but I care not much for the complaints of the euil which do ſerue for no other thing but to reproue the Iuſtices which are miniſtred vnto thē by the good.
                     The Princes in that they command and the Iudges in that they execute, ought not much to eſteeme the complaints of all thoſe which ſay they haue wrong: Prouided that the cauſe bee iuſtified, and that vnder the colour of iuſtice they do not wrong in deed.
                     In the flatteries which they tell vs concerning our glory, and in the ſlanders which they ſpeake of vs, concerning our reproach, wiſe men ought

well to note the nature of the perſon which ſpeaketh it, whether that bee true which hee ſpeaketh, and what moueth him to tell it: For as it is a ſhame for to bee rebuked of a man, which is honeſt: ſo it is no ſmall infamie to be prayſed of thoſe which are euill.
                     Since the time I was borne, I neuer ſaw any thing leſſe profitable in the commonwealth, nor more vaine, neither worſe inuentions, nor colder recreations then theſe are, which theſe ieſters, plaiers, and iuglers doe inuent.
                     What thing can bee more monſtrous then to ſee the folly of a foole, bring diuers wiſe men out of their wits? What greater mockerie can there be, then that all doe thinke that the ieſts of a foole ought to bee reioyced The folly of fooles ought to be contemned of the wiſe. at, with the laughter of the Sage? What greater ſlaunder can there be, then that in the offices of the noble and worthy Romans, the gates ſhould alwayes be open for fooles, and the wiſe men ſhould finde them alwayes ſhut? What greater cruelty can there be in Rome, then that the Senators &amp; rich men giue more to a Player for a ſong which he ſingeth in one houre, then they do to the ſeruants for ſeruing them a whole yeare? what greater theft can there be then this, that the Garriſons which are in Illyria want, and Players, Ieſters, Iuglers, Flatterers, and Loyterers, in Rome haue too much?
                     What greater ſhame can Rome receyue then this, when it ſhall bee ſayde in time to come, that Iuglers, Players, Paraſites, Ieſters, and Flatterers, haue wonne more with their iugling, playing, (ieſting and flattering, then diuers Captaines with their weapons and triumphes? Beholde therefore Lambert, what difference there is betweene Captames and Loyrerets.
                     For when the one went through Rome, ſowing their follyes from gate to gate: the others went from realm to realme, conſuming their goods, aduenturing their liues, fighting againſt the barbarous people, &amp; ſhedding their owne proper bloud.
                     And in the hindermoſt parte of Spaine, when thoſe of Seuill had warre with the Gaditanes, it chanced that euen in the middeſt of the time thoſe of Seuill wanted money, and two Paraſites offered themſelues for 2 years The great riches of two Paraſites. to ſuſtaine the warres with their own proper goods; ſo that with the riches of two fooles, many wiſe men were ouercome.
                     When the Amazones were Ladies of Aſia, then they built the great temple of the goddeſſe Diana. And as the hiſtories account, only with that they tooke away from a player, was builte this noble Temple. If the hiſtories of the Egyptians do not deceyue me, King Ca

                     When the good Emperour Auguſtus renued the walles of Rome, &amp; made them of hard ſtone, which before that time were onely of earth, and bricke, towards ſuch a coſtly Worke, he had more of two Paraſites which were drowned, then of all the City beſide.
                     I beeing in the City of Corinthe, ſaw an auncient Tombe, wherein the Corinthians ſay their firſt King was buried. And the Hiſtoriographers ſay, that this King was a great wraſtler, other ſay, hee was a Paraſite: others ſay, hee was a Iugler, but howſoeuer it was, he was firſt a Ieſter, and obtained a Realme in earneſt.
                     Behold Lambert, how they are neglected of the gods, and fauoured of

fortune, and in how little eſtimation the goods of this life ought to bee eſteemed, ſince ſom by counterfaiting the fooles, leaue of them as great memory of their folly, as the others doe by their wiſedome.
                     There is one thing onely of theſe loyterers that pleaſeth me, that is to ſay, that in his preſence they make euery man laugh with the follyes they ſpeake, and after that they are gone, all remaine ſadde for the money they The property of Iuglers. carrie away. Truly it is a iuſt ſentence of the gods, that thoſe which haue taken vain pleaſures together, do weepe afterwards for their loſſe ſeuerally. At this preſent I will write no more vnto thee, but that I ſend thee this letter written in Greeke, to the end thou maieſt reade it to al thoſe of that Iſle. And thou ſhalt immediatelie diſpatch the ſhips, to the end they carry the prouiſions to the men of warre in Illyria. Peace bee with thee Lambert, health and good fortune to mee Marke.
                     
                     The Senate ſaluteth thee, and do ſend thee the propagation of the gouernement for the next yeare. In the Calends of Ianuary thou ſhalt ſay, Gaude foelix. My wife Fauſtine commendeth her to thee, and ſendeth thee for thy daughter a rich girdle: In payment of thy ſeruices, I do ſend thee two rich Iewels, two light horſes, and one laden with 4000. Sexterces. Marcus of Mount Celio with his owne hand writeth vnto thee.

                           CLeobolus and Biton, were the ſonnes of a renowmed woman, the which was Nunne to the goddeſſe Iuno: &amp; when the day of that ſolemne feaſt was celebrated, her children prepared a Chariot, wherein their mother ſhould goe to the Temple: For the Greekes had this cuſtome, the day that the Prieſtes went to offer any ſacrifice, eyther they were carried on mens armes, or in Chariots. They adorned their temples ſo well, they eſteemed their Sacrifices ſo much, and did ſo much honour their Prieſts, that if any Prieſt did ſet his foot on the ground, that day they did not permit him to offer any ſacrifices to the Gods.
                     It chanced as this Nunne went in her Chariot, and her children Cleobolus &amp; Biton with her, the beaſts which drew the Chariot, ſuddenly fell down dead, ten miles from the Temple of the goddeſſe Iuno. The children ſeeing the beaſts dead, and that their A true patterne for good and vertuous children. mother could not goe a foot, and that the Chariot was all ready, and that there was no beaſts to draw it: they (as louing children) determined to yoake themſelues, and draw the chariot, as if they had been dumb beaſts. And as the mother carried them nine moneths in her wombe, ſo did they draw her in the chariot x. miles. Now for that they paſſed through infinite

numbers of men to the feaſt of the goddeſſe Iuno, euery man ſeing Cleobolus and Biton yoked in the Chariot like beaſts, were greatly amazed, ſaying that theſe two children deſerued with great rewards to be recompenced. And truly they ſayde iuſtly, and ſo they deſerued it: For they deſerued as much to be prayſed for the example which they ſhewed to all children to reuerence their parents, as for carrying their mother in the Chariot to the Temple: So after that the Feaſt was ended, the mother not knowing how to require the benefite of her children, with many teares beſought the goddeſſe Iuno, that ſhe with the other gods would be contented to giue her two children the beſt thing that the gods could giue to their friends.
                     The Goddeſſe Iuno anſwered her, that ſhee was contented to require the other Gods, and that they would doe it. And the reward was, that for this noble fact the gods ordained, that Cleobolus and Biton ſhould ſleepe one day well, and in the morning, when they ſhould wake, they ſhould dye.
                     The mother pittifully bewayling the death of her children, and complaining of the gods, the Goddeſſe Iuno ſayde vnto her; Thou haſt no cauſe why to complaine, ſince wee haue giuen thee that thou haſt demaunded, &amp; haſt demaunded that which wee haue giuen thee. I am a goddeſſe, and thou art my ſeruant, and therefore the gods haue giuen to thy children the thing, which they count moſt dear, which is death: For the greateſt reuenge which among the gods wee can take of our enemies, is to let them liue long: and the beſt thing that we keep for our friends, is to make them to die quickely.
                     
                     The author of this hiſtorie is called Hiſearchus in his politikes, and Cicero in his firſt booke of his Tuſculanes.
                     
                     In the Iſle of Delphos, where the oracle of the god Apollo was, there was a ſumptuous Temple, the which for want of reparation fell downe to the ground, as oftentimes it chanceth to high and ſumptuous buildings, which from time to time are not repaired: For if the walles, dungeons, Caſtels, and ſtrong houſes could ſpeak, as well would they complaine for that they doe not renue them, as the olde men doe for that wee doe not cheriſh them.
                     
                        Triphon and Agamendo, were two noble Perſonages of Greece, and counted for ſage and rich men, the which went vnto the Temple of Apollo, and built it new againe, as well with the labour of their perſons, as with the great expences of their goods. When the building was atchieued, the god Apollo ſayde vnto them, that hee remembred well their good ſeruice, wherefore he would they ſhould demaund him any thing in rewarde of their trauell, and with a good will it ſhould be granted: for the gods vſe for a little ſeruice to giue a great reward.
                     
                        Triphon and Agamendo aunſwered vnto the god Apollo, that for their good will, for their trauell, and for their expences, they demaunded no other reward, but that it would pleaſe him to giue them the beſt thing that might bee giuen vnto man, and that vnto them were moſt profite, ſaying: That the miſerable men haue not the power to eſchew the euill, nor wiſedome to chuſe the good,
                     The god Apollo anſwered, that he was contented to pay them their ſeruice which they had done, and for to Death the beſt gift that can be giuen to mortall men. grant them that which they had demaunded. By reaſon whereof, Triphon and Agamendo hauing dined, ſuddenly at the gates of the temple fel down dead: ſo that the reward of their trauel was to plucke them out of their

miſerie. The reaſon to declare theſe two examples, is to the ende that all mortall men may knowe, that there is nothing ſo good in this worlde, as to haue an ende of this life: and though to loſe it there be no ſauour, yet at the leaſt there is profite. For wee would reproue a traueller of great fooliſhnes if ſweating by the way he would ſing: and after, at his iourneyes ende hee ſhould beginne to weepe.
                     Is not hee ſimple, which is ſorry for that hee is come into the Hauen? is not hee ſimple, that giueth the battell, and fighteth for that hee hath got the victorie? Is not he ſtubborne which How little we ought to eſteeme of Death. is in great diſtreſſe, and is angry to be ſuccoured? Therefore, more fooliſh, ſimple, and ſtubborn is hee, which trauelleth to dye, and is loath to meete with death. For, death is the true refuge, the perfect health, the ſure Hauen, the whole victorie, the fleſh without bones, Fiſh without ſcales, and corne without ſlrawe. Finally, after death wee haue nothing to bewayle, and much leſſe to deſire.
                     In the time of Adrian the Emperour, a Phyloſopher called Secundus, (being meruellouſly learned) made an oration at the funerall of a Noble Romaine Matrone, (a Kinſ-woman of the Emperours) who ſpake exceedingly much euill of life, and maruellous much good of death. And when the Emp: demanded him what death was?
                     The phyloſopher aunſwered thus: Death is an eternall ſleepe, a diſſolution of the bodie, a terror of the rich, a deſire of the poore, a thing inhetitable, a pilgrimage vncertaine, a Theefe of men, a kinde of ſleeping, a ſhadow of life, a ſeparation of the liuing, a companie of the dead, a reſolution of all trauels, and the end of all ydle deſires. Finally, Death is the ſcourge of all euill, and the chiefe reward of the good.
                     Truely this Phyloſopher ſpake very well, and hee ſhould not doe euill, which profoundly would conſider, that hee had ſpoken.
                     
                        Seneca in an Epiſtle, declareth of a Phyloſopher whoſe name was Beſſus: to whom, when they demanded what euill a man can haue in Death, ſince men feare it ſo much? Hee aunſwered. If any damage or feare is in him who dyeth: it is not for the feare of death: but for the vice of him which dyeth.
                     Wee may agree to that the Phyloſopher ſaide: that euen as the deafe cannot iudge harmony, nor the blind colours: ſo likewiſe they cannot ſay euill of death, eſpecially he which neuer taſted it. For, of all thoſe which are dead, none returned again to complaine of Death: and of theſe fewe that liue, all complaine of life.
                     If any of the dead returned hither to ſpeak vvith the liuing, and as they Comforts againſt the feare of death. haue proued it, ſo they vvould tell vs.
                     If there were any harme in ſecrete death, it were reaſon to haue ſome feare of death? But though a man that neuer ſaw, heard, felt nor taſted death, doeth ſpeake euill of Death, ſhould wee therefore feare Death?
                     Thoſe ought to haue done ſome euill in their life, which doe feare &amp; ſpeake euill of death. For, in the laſt houre, in the ſtreight iudgement, the good ſhalbe known, &amp; the euill diſcouered.
                     There is no Prince nor Knight, rich nor poore, whole nor ſicke, lucky nor vnluckie, which I ſee with their vocations to be contented, ſaue onely the dead: which in theyr graues are in peace &amp; reſt, and are neither couetous proud, negligent, vain, ambicious, nor diſſolute. So that the ſtate of the dead ought to bee beſt, ſince wee ſee none therein to bee euill contented. And ſince therefore thoſe which are poore, 
                           •
                        oe ſeek the meanes wherwith to endch themſelues: thoſe which are ſad, rio ſeeke wherby to reioyce, and thoſe

which are ſicke, to ſeeke to be healed: why is it, that thoſe which haue ſuch feare of Death, doe ſeeke remedie againſt that feare? In this caſe I would ſay, that he which will not feare to die, let him vſe himſelf well to liue. For the guyltles taketh away feare from death.
                     The diuine Plato demaunded Socrates how hee behaued himſelfe in life: and how he would behaue himſelfe in death? He anſwered, I let thee know, A Queſtion of Plato, demaunded of Socrates. that in youth, I haue trauelled to liue well, and in age I haue ſtudyed to die well: and ſith my life hath been honeſt, I hope my death ſhall be ioyfull: And although I haue had ſorrow to liue, I am ſure I ſhall haue no paine to dye.
                     Truely theſe wordes are worthie of ſuch a man. Men of ſtout harts ſuffer maruellouſly, when the ſwear of theyr trauell is not rewarded, when they are faithful, and their rewards aunſwereth nothing to their true ſeruice: when for their good ſeruices, their Friends become vnthankefull to them, when they are worthy honour, and that they preferre them to honorable room and office. For the noble and valiant harts doe not eſteeme to looſe the rewarde of their labour: but thinke much vnkindeneſſe, when a man doeth not acknowledge theyr trauells.
                     Oh happie are they that dye: For, without inconuenience, and without paine euery man is in his graue. For, in this Tribunall, iuſtice to all is ſo equally obſerued, that in the ſame place where wee haue deſerued life, in the ſame place we merited death.
                     There was neuer nor neuer ſhall be iudge ſo iuſt, nor in iuſtice ſo vpright, that giueth reward by weight, and paine by meaſure: but that ſomtimes they chaſten the innocent, &amp; abſolue the guiltie: they vexe the faultleſſe, and they diſſemble with the culpable. For, little auaileth it the playntife to haue good iuſtice: if conſcience want to the iudge that ſhould miniſter it.
                     Truely it is not ſo in Death, but all ought to account themſelues happie. For he which ſhall haue good iuſtice, ſhall bee ſure on his parte to haue the ſentence.
                     When great Cato was Cenſor in Rome, a famous Romaine dyed, who ſhewed at his death a maruellous courage: and when the Romains praiſed him for that hee had ſo great vertue, and for the words he had ſpoken, Cato the Cenſor laughed at that they ſayd, for that they praiſed him. And he being A queſtion demanded of Cato, &amp; his anſwer, demanded the cauſe of his laughter? annſwered. Yee maruell at that I laugh, and I laugh at that yee maruell: For the perills and trauells conſidered wherein wee liue, and the ſafetie wherein wee dye, I ſay, that it is more needefull to haue vertue and ſtrength to liue, then courage to dye. The Authour hereof is Plutarch in his Apothegmes.
                     
                     Wee cannot ſay, but that Cato the Cenſor ſpake as a wiſe man: ſince daylie we ſee, ſhamefaſt and vertuous perſons ſuffer hunger, cold, thyrſt, trauell, pouerty, inconuenience, ſorrows, enmities, and miſhaps: of the which things wee were better to ſee the ende in one day, then to ſuffer them euery houre. For it is leſſe euill to ſuffer an honeſt death, then to endure a miſerable life.
                     Oh how ſmall conſideration haue men to thinke, that they ought to dye but once: Since the truth is, that the day when wee are born, and come inthis worlde, is the beginning of our death: and the laſt day is when we do ceaſe to liue. If death bee no other but an ending of life, then reaſon perſwadeth vs to thinke, that our infancie dyeth, our childhood dyeth, our manhoode dyeth, and our Age ſhall dye: wherof we may conſequently cōclude that we dye euery yeare, euery day, euery houre, and euery moment.
                     
                        
So that thinking to leade a ſure life, we taſte a new death. I know not why men feare ſo much to dye, ſince that from the time of their birth, they ſeeke none other thing but death. For time neuer wanteth for any man to dye: neyther I knew any man that euer fayled of this way.
                     
                        Seneca in an Epiſtle declareth, that as a Romaine Woman lamented the death of a Childe of hers, a Phyloſopher ſaide vnto her: Woman, why A worthie ſentence of Seneca. bewayleſt thou thy childe? She aunſwered. I weepe becauſe hee hath liued xxv. yeares, and I would he ſhould haue liued till fiftie. For, amongſt vs mothers wee loue our Children ſo hartily, that we neuer ceaſe to behold them, nor yet ende to bewaile them. Then the Phyloſopher ſaid: Tell me I pray thee woman: Why doeſt thou not complame of the Gods, becauſe they created not thy Sonne manie yeares before he was borne: as well as thou complavneſt that they haue not let him liue fiftie yeares? Thou weepeſt that hee is deade ſo ſoone: and thou doſt not lament that he is borne ſo late.
                     I tell thee true Woman, that as thou doeſt not lament for the one, no more thou oughreſt to bee ſorrie for the other. For without the determination of the Gods, we cannot ſhorten death: and much leſſe lengthen our life.
                     So Plinie ſaide in an Epiſtle, that the chiefeſt law which the Gods haue A ſentence of Plinie, giuen vnto humane nature was, that none ſhold haue perpactual life. For, with diſ-ordinate deſire to liue long, wee ſhould reioyce to goe out of this paine.
                     Two Phyloſophers diſputing before the great Emperor Theodoſe: the one ſaide that it was good to procure death: and the other likewiſe ſayde, it was a neceſſary thing to hate life: The good Theodoſe taking him by the hand ſayd: All wee mortalles are ſo extreame in hating and louing: that vnder the colour to loue and hate life, wee leade an euill life. For, we ſuffer ſo many trauells for to preſerue it, that ſometimes 
                        A worthie ſpeech of the Emp: Theodoſe 
                        it were much better to looſe it. And further hee ſayde: Diuers vaine men are come into ſo great follyes, that for feare of Death, they procure to haſten death. And hauiwg conſideration to this, me ſeemeth that wee ought not greatly to loue life, nor with deſperation to ſeeke Death. For the ſtrong and valiant men ought not to hate Life, ſo long as it laſteth: nor to bee diſpleaſed with death when hee commeth. All commended that which the Emperour Theodoſe ſpake, as Paulus Dyacon: ſaith in his life.
                     Let euery man ſpeake what he will, and let the Phyloſophers counſell what they lift, in my poore iudgment, hee alone ſhall receyue death without paine, who long before is prepared to receyue the ſame. For, ſudden death is not onely bitter vnto him which taſteth it, but alſo it ſeareth him that hateth it.
                     
                        Lactantius ſaide, that in ſuch ſorte man ought to liue, as if from hence an houre after he ſhould dye. For thoſe men which will haue Death before their eyes, it is vnpoſſible that they ſhould giue place to vaine thoughts.
                     In my opinion, and alſo by the aduiſe of Apuleius It is as much follie to flie from that which we cannot auoyd: as to deſire that wee can not attaine. And this is only ſpoken for thoſe that would flye the voyage of death which is neceſſarie: and deſire to come againe, which is vnpoſſible.
                     Thoſe that trauell by long wayes, if they want any thing, they borrow it of their companie. If they haue forgotten ought, they returne to ſeeke it at their lodging, or elſe they write vnto their friends a letter. But I am ſorrie, that if wee once dye, they will not let vs returne again, we cannot ſpeake,

and they will not agree we ſhall write: but ſuch as they ſhall finde vs, ſo ſhall wee bee iudged. And that which is moſt fearfull of all, the execution and ſentence is giuen in one day.
                     Let Noble Princes and great Lords beleeue mee in this: Let them not leaue that vndone til after their death: which they may doe, during their life. And let them not truſt in that they commaund: but in that whiles they liue they doe.
                     Let them not truſt in the workes of an other: but in theyr owne good deedes. For in the end one ſigh ſhall be more worth then all the friendes of None ought to procraſtinate or deny their amendment. the world. I counſell, pray, and exhort all wiſe and vertuous men: and alſo my ſelfe with them, that in ſuch a ſort wee liue, that at the houre of death, wee may ſay we liue. For wee cannot ſay that wee liue, when we liue not well. For, all that time which without profite wee ſhall liue, ſhall be counted vnto vs for nothing.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XLIX. ¶ Of the death of Marcus Aurelius the Emperour, and how there are fewe Friendes which dare ſay the truth to ſicke men.
                     
                     
                        THe good Emperor Marcus Aurelius; now beeing aged, not onely for the yeares he had: but alſo for the great trauells hee had in the warres endured: It chaunced, that in the xviii. yeare of his Empire, and lxxij. yeares from the day of his birth, and of the foundation of Rome, fiue hundreth xliii. beeing in the warre of Pannonie (which at this time is called Hungaria) beſieging a famous cittie called Vendeliona, ſuddenly a diſeaſe of the palſey tooke him, which was ſuch, that hee loſt his life, and Rome her Prince, the beſt of life, that euer was borne therein.
                     Among the Heathen princes ſome had more force then he, others poſſeſſed more riches then hee, others were as aduenturous as hee, and ſome haue knowne as much as hee: but none hath bin of ſo excellent and vertuous a life, nor ſo modeſt as hee. For, his life being examined to the vttermoſt, ther are many princely vertues to follow, and fewe vices to reproue.
                     The occaſion of his death was, that that in going one Night about his Campe, ſuddenly the diſeaſe of the palſey tooke him in his arme: ſo that from thence forwards hee could not put on his gowne, nor draw his ſword, and much leſſe carrie a ſtaffe.
                     The good Empreour being ſo loaden with yeres, and no leſſe with cares the ſharpe Winter approching more and more, great aboundance of water A great diſcouragemēt to lo
                              •
                           e ſo worthie a perſonage. and ſnow fell about the Tents: ſo that another diſeaſe fell vpon him, called Litargie, the which thing much abated his courage, and in his Hoaſt cauſed great ſorrow. For, he was ſo beloued of all, as if they had been his owne Children.
                     After that he had proued all medicines and remedyes that could bee found, and all other things, which vnto ſo great and mightie Princes were accuſtomed to be done, he perceyued in the end, that all remedie was paſt. And the reaſon heereof was, becauſe his ſicknes was exceeding vehement, and hee himſelfe very aged, the Ayre vnwhol-ſome, and aboue all, becauſe ſorrowes and cares oppreſſed his hart.
                     Without doubt greater is the diſeaſe that proceedeth of ſorrowe, then that which proceedeth of the Feuer quartaine. And thereof fenſueth, that more eaſily is hee cured, which of corrupt humours is full: then hee which

with profound, thoughts is oppreſſed.
                     The Emperour then beeing ſicke in his chamber, and in ſuch ſort that hee could not exerciſe the feates of armes: as his men ranne out of their Campe to skyrmiſh, and the Hungarians in like manner to defend: the fight on both ſides was ſo cruell, through the great effuſion of bloud, that neither the Hungarians had cauſe to reioyce, nor yet the Romaines to be merrie.
                     Vnderſtanding the euill order of his, and eſpecially that v. of his Captaines were ſlaine in the conflict, and that he for his diſeaſe could not bee there in perſon: ſuch ſorrows pierced his hart, Extreame ſorrows oppreſſed the good Emp: M: Aur. that although he deſired forthwith to haue dyed, yet hee remained 2. dayes and 3. nights, without that hee would ſee light, or ſpeak vnto any man of his.
                     So that the heat was much, the reſt was ſmall, the ſighes were continuall, and the thyrſt very great: the meate little, and the ſleepe leſſe: and aboue all his face wrinckled, and his lips very blacke.
                     Sometimes he caſt vp his eyes, and at other times he wrong his hands: alwayes hee was ſilent, and continually hee ſighed. His tongue was ſwollen, that hee could not ſpit: and his eyes very hollow with weeping. So that it was a great pittie to ſee his death: and no leſſe compaſſion, to ſee the confuſion of his pallace, and the hinderance of the warre.
                     Many valiant captains, many noble Romaines, many faithfull ſeruants, and many old friends, at all theſe heauines were preſent. But none of them durſt ſpeake to the Emperour Marke, partly for that they tooke him to be ſo ſage, that they knewe not what counſell to giue him: and partely for that they were ſo ſorrowful, that they could not refraine their heauie teares. For, the louing and true Friendes, in their life ought to bee beloued: and at theyr death to be bewailed. Great compaſſion ought men to haue of thoſe which dye, not for that we ſee them dye: but becauſe there are none that telleth them what they ought to doe.
                     Noble Princes and great Lords are in greater perill when they dye, then the Plebeyans. For the counſeller dare not tell vnto his Lorde at the houre of death, that which hee knoweth: and much leſſe will tell him how he ought to die, and what things hee ought to diſcharge whiles hee is aliue.
                     Manie goe to viſite the ſicke, that I would to GOD they went ſome other where. And the cauſe heereof is, that they ſee the ſicke mans eyes hollowe, the fleſh dryed, the armes without fleſh, the colour enflamed, the ague continuall, the paine great, the tongue ſwollen, nature conſumed, and beſides all this, the houſe deſtroyed: and yet they ſay vnto the ſicke man, Be of good cheere, I warrant you, you ſhall liue.
                     
                     As young men naturallie deſire to liue, and as death to all olde men is dreadfull: ſo though they ſee themſelues in that diſtreſſe, yet they refuſe Men ought to prouide a cleare conſcience to depart this life, &amp;c. no Medecines, as though there were great hope of life. And therof enſueth oftentimes, that the miſerable creatures depart the worlde, without confeſſing vnto GOD, and making reſtitutions vnto men.
                     Oh if thoſe which doe this, knewe what euill they doe. For to take away my goods, to trouble my perſon, to blerniſh my good name, to ſlaunder my parentage, and to reproue my life, theſe works are of cruell enemies: but to bee occaſion to loſe my ſoule, it is the works of the diuell of hell.
                     Certainly hee is a Diuell which deceyueth the ſicke with flatteryes: and that in ſteed to helpe him to dye well, putteth him in vain-hope of long life. Herein hee that ſayeth it, winneth little: and he that beleeueth it, aduentureth much. To mortall men it is more meete to giue counſelles to reform

their conſciences with the truth: then to hazard their houſes with lyes. With our friends wee are aſhameleſſe in their life, and alſo baſhfull at their death. The which ought ought not to be ſo: For, if our Fathers were not dead, and that wee did not daylie ſee theſe that are preſent die: mee thinketh it were a ſhame, and alſo a feare, to ſay to the ſicke that hee alone ſhould die: But ſince thou knoweſt as well as he, and he knoweth as well as thou, that all doe trauell in this perillous iourney: what ſhame haſt thou to ſay vnto thy friend, that hee is now at the laſt point?
                     If the dead ſhould now reuiue, how would they complain of their friends? Good counſell againſt the feare of death. And this for no other cauſe, but for that they would not giue them good counſell at their death. For, if the ſicke man bee my Friend, and that I ſee peraduenture he will dye: Why ſhall not I counſell him to prepare himſelfe to dye?
                     Certainly oftentimes we ſee by experience, that thoſe which are prepared, and are ready for to dye, doe eſcape: and thoſe which thinke to liue, doe periſh. What ſhould they doe, which goe to viſite the ſicke, perſwade them that they make their. Teſtaments, that they confeſſe their ſinnes, that they diſcharge their conſcience, that they receyue the Communion: and that they do reconcile themſelues to their enemies. Certainely, all theſe things charge not the launce of death, nor cut not the threed of life.
                     I neuer ſaw blindeneſſe ſo blinde, nor ignorance ſo ignorant, as to be aſhamed to counſell the ſicke, that they are bound to do when they are whole. As we haue ſayd here aboue.
                     Princes and great Lords, are thoſe aboue all others, that liue and dye moſt abuſedly. And the onely cauſe in this, that as their Seruants haue no hearts to perſwade them, when they are merrie: ſo haue they no audacity to tell them truth, when they are in perill. For ſuch ſeruants care little, ſo that their maſters bequeath them any thing in their willes, whether they die well, or liue euill.
                     O what miſerie and pitie is it, to ſee a Prince, a Lord, a gentleman, and a rich perſon die, if they haue no faithfull friend about them, to helpe them to paſſe that paine? And not without a cauſe I ſay, that he ought to be a faithfull friend. For many in our life do gape after our goods, &amp; few at our deaths are ſory for our offences.
                     The wiſe and ſage men, before nature compelleth them to die, of Wiſe men prepare thēſelues before death. their owne will ought to die. That is to ſay, that before they ſee themſelues in the pangs of death, they haue their conſciences ready prepared. For if we count him a foole, which wil paſſe the ſea without a ſhip: truely we will not count him wiſe, which taketh his death without any preparation before.
                     What loſeſt a wiſeſt man to haue his will well ordained? in what aduenuenture of honour is any man before death, to reconcile himſelfe to his enemies: and to thoſe whom he hath borne hate and malice? What loſeth he of his credite, who in his life time reſtoreth that, which at his death they will command him to render? wherein may a man ſhew himſelfe to bee more wiſe, then when willingly hee hath diſcharged that, which afterwards by proceſſe they will take from him?
                     O how many Princes, and great Lords are there, which onely not for ſpending one day about their teſtament, haue cauſed their children and heires, all the dayes of their life to bee in trauerſe in the Law? So that they ſuppoſing to haue left their children wealthy, haue not left them, but for Atturneyes and Counſellers

of the law. The true and vnfained Chriſtian, ought euery morning ſo to diſpoſe his goods, and correct life, as if he ſhold dye the ſame night. And at night in like manner he ought to commit himſelfe to GOD: as if he hoped for no life vntill morning. For, to ſay the truth, to ſuſtaine life, there are infinite trauels: but to meete with death, there is but one way.
                     If they will credite my wordes, I would coūſell no man in ſuch eſtate to liue, that for any thing in the worlde he ſhould vndoe himſelfe. The Riche and the poore, the great and the ſmal, the Gentlemen, and the Plebeyans, all Death terrible to all men. ſay and ſweare, that of death they are exceeding fearefull. To whome I ſay and affirm, that he alone feareth death in whome we ſee amendment of life.
                     Princes and great Lords, ought alſo to be perfect, to ende before they ende, to dye before they die, and to be mortified, before they bee mortified. If they doe this with themſelues, they ſhall as eaſily leaue their life, as if they channged from one houſe to another. For the moſt parte of men delight to talke with leyſure, to drinke with leyſure, to eate with leyſure, and to ſleepe with leyſure, but they die in haſte: Not without cauſe, I ſay they die in haſte, ſince wee ſee them receiue the ſacrament of the Supper of the Lord in haſte, male their willes by force, and with ſpeede to confeſſe and receyue. So that they take it, and demaund it ſo late, and ſo without reaſon: that often times they haue loſte their Sences, and are readie to giue vp the ſpirite, when they bring it vnto them.
                     What auaileth the Ship-maſter, after the ſhip is ſunke? what doe weapons, after the battell is loſt? What auaileth pleaſures after men are dead? By this which I haue ſpoken, I will demaund what it auayleth the ſicke? being heauie with ſleepe, and berefte of their ſences, to call for Confeſſors, vnto whome they confeſſe their ſinnes? Euill ſhall hee bee confeſſed, which hath no vnderſtanding to repent himſelfe? What auaileth it to call the confeſſor to vnderſtand the ſecrets of his Conſcience, when the ſicke man hath loſt his ſpeech?
                     Let vs not deceyue our ſelues, ſaying in our age, we will amend hereafter: and make reſtitution at our death. For, in mine opinion, it is not the poynt of wiſe men, nor of good Chriſtiās, to deſire ſo much time to offend, and they will not eſpie any to amend.
                     Would to GOD, that the third parte of the precious time which men occupie in ſinne, were employed about the Repentance not to be omitted. meditations of Death, and the cares which they haue to accompliſh their Fleſhly luſts, were ſpent in bewayling their filthie ſinnes.
                     I am very ſorrie with my heart, that they ſo wickedly ſpend and paſſe theirlife, in vices and pleaſures, as if there were no GOD, vnto whom they ſhold render account for their offences.
                     All worldlings willingly doe ſinne, vpon a vaine hope onely in Age to amend, and at death to repent: But I would demaund him that in this hope ſinned: what certainty he hath in age of amendment, and what aſſurance he hath to haue long warning before hee die:
                     Since we ſee by experience, there are moe in number which dye young, then olde: it is no reaſon wee ſhould commit ſo many ſinnes in one day, as that wee ſhould haue cauſe to lament afterwards all the reſt of our life. And afterwards to bewayle the ſins of our long life, we deſire no more but one ſpace of an houre. Conſidering the the Omnipotencie of the Diuine mercie it ſufficeth: yea, and I ſay, that the ſpace of an houreis to much to repent vs of our wicked life: but I would counſel all, ſince the ſinner for to repent

taketh but one houre, that that be not the laſt houre. For, the ſighes and repentance, which proceed from the bottome of the heart, penetrate the high Heauens: but thoſe which come of neceſſity, doeth not pierce the bare ſeeling of the Houſe.
                     I allow and commende, that thoſe which viſit
                           •
                         the ſick, do counſell them to examin their conſciences, to receiue the Communion, to pray vnto GOD, to forgiue their enemyes, and to recommend themſelues to the deuoute prayers of the people, and to repent them of their ſinnes.
                     Finally I ſay, that it is very good to doe all this: But yet I ſay, it is better to haue done it before. For, the diligent and careful Pyrate, prepareth for the Tempeſt, when the Sea is calme.
                     Hee that deepely would conſider, how little the goods of this life are to be eſteemed: Let him go to ſee a rich man when hee dyeth, and what he doeth in his bed. And he ſhall finde that the wife demandeth of the poore huſband her dowrie, the Daughter the What care is had to inherit tranſitory goods. third parte, the other the fifth, the childe the preheminence of age, the Sonne in law his Marriage, the phyſition his duetie, the Slaue his libertie, the Seruaunts their wages, the creditours their debtes, and the worſt of all is, that none of thoſe that ought to inherite his goods, will giue him one glaſſe of water.
                     Thoſe that ſhall heare or read this, ought to conſider, that that which they haue ſeene done at the death of their neighbours: the ſame ſhall come vnto them, when they ſhall be ſicke at the poynt of death. For, ſo ſoone as the Rich ſhutteth his eyes, forthwith there is great ſtrife betweene the children for his goods. And this ſtrife is not to vnburthen his ſoule: but which of them ſhall inherite moſt of his poſſeſſions, In this caſe, I will not my pen trauell any further, ſince both rich and poore doe daylie ſee the experience hereof. And in thigs verie manifeſt, it ſufficeth onely for wiſe men to be put in memorie, without waſting any more time to perſwade them.
                     Now the Emperor Marcus Aurelius had a ſecretarie verie wiſe, &amp; vertuous, through whoſe hands the affaires of the Empire paſſed. And when this ſecretarie ſaw his Lord and Maſter ſo ſicke, and almoſt at the houre of death, and that none of his parents or friends durſt ſpeake vnto him: he plainly determined to doe his dutie, wherein hee ſhewed verie well the profound knowledge hee had in wiſedome, and the great good wil he bare to his Lord. This Secretary was called Panutius, the vertues and life of whom Sextus Cheronenſis in the life of Marcus Aurelius declareth.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. L. Of the Comfortable words which the Secretary Panutius ſpake to the Emperour Marcus Aurelius at the houre of his death.
                     
                     
                        O My Lord and Maſter, mytongue cannot keepe ſilence, The worthy ſecretary Panurius his ſpeech. mine eyes cannot refraine from bitter teares, nor my heart leaue from fetching ſighs, nor yet reaſon can vſe his duty: For my bloud boyleth, my ſinews are dried, my powers be open, my heart doth faint, and my ſpirit is troubled. And the occaſion of all this is, to ſee that the wholeſome counſels which thou giueſt to others: ether thou canſt not, or will not take for thy ſelfe. I ſee thee die my Lord, and I die for that I cannot remedy thee.
                     For if the gods would haue granted me my requeſt, for the lengthning of thy life one day, I would

giue willingly my whole life.
                     Whither the ſorrow bee true or fayned, it needeth not I declare vnto thee with wordes, ſince thou mayeſt manifeſtly diſcerne it by my countenance. For mine eyes with teares are wet, and my heart with ſighes is very heauie.
                     I feele much the want of thy companie. I feele much the dammage, which (of thy death) to the whole commonwealth ſhall enſue. I feele much thy ſorrowe which in thy pallace ſhall remaine. I feele much for that Rome this day is vndone: but that which aboue all things doth moſt torment my heart, is to haue ſeene thee liue as wiſe, and now to ſee thee dye as ſimple.
                     Tell me I pray thee my Lord, why do men learne the Greeke tongue? trauell to vnderſtand the Hebrew: ſweate The reaſon why men ſtudie, is to learne to liue well. in the Latine, chaunge ſo many Maiſters, turne ſo many bookes, and in ſtudie conſume ſo much money, and ſo many yeares: if it were not to knowe how to paſſe life with honor, and take death with patience?
                     The end why men ought to ſtudie, is to learne to liue well. For there is no truer ſcience in man, then to know how to order his life well. What profiteth it me to know much, if thereby I take no profite? what profiteth me to know ſtraunge Languages, if I refrain nor my tongue from other mens matters? what profiteth it to ſtudie many bookes, if I ſtudie not but to begyule my friendes? what profiteth it to know the influence of the ſtarres: and the courſe of the Elements: if I cannot keepe my ſelfe from vices?
                     Finally I ſay, that it little auayleth to to bee a maſter of the Sage, if ſecretly hee bee reported to bee a follower of fooles. The chiefe of all Phyloſophie conſiſteth to ſerue GOD, and not to offend men.
                     I aske thee, moſt Noble Prince, what auaileth it the Pilot to know the Arte of Sayling, and after in a Tempeſt by negligence to periſh? What auaileth it the valiaunt Captaine, to talke much of Warres, and afterwards he knoweth not how to giue the Battell? What auayleth it the guyde to tell the neareſt way, and afterwards in the middeſt to looſe himſelfe?
                     All this which I haue ſpoken, is ſaide for thee my Lord: For, what auayleth it that thou beeing in health, ſhouldeſt ſigh for death? ſince now when hee doeth approche, thou weepeſt becauſe thou wouldeſt not leaue life?
                     One of the things wherein the wiſe man ſheweth his wiſdome, is to know Stedfaſtnes of minde is commendable. how to loue, and how to hate. For, it is great lightnes (I ſhould rather ſay follie) to day to loue him, whome yeſterday we hated: and to morrowe to ſlaunder him whom this day wee honoured.
                     What Prince ſo high, or what Plebeyan ſo baſe hath there been, or in the world ſhall euer be, the which hath ſo little (as thou) regarded life: and ſo highly commended death? What things haue I written (beeing thy Secretarie) with mine owne hand, to diuers Prouinces of the world: where thou ſpeakeſt ſo much good of death, that ſometimes thou madeſt mee to hate life? What was it to ſee that letter which thou wroteſt vnto the noble Romaine, Claudinaes widdowe, comforting her of the death of her Husband, which dyed in the warres? Wherein ſhee aunſwered: that ſhe thought her trouble comfort, to deſerue that thou ſhouldſt write her ſuch a Letter.
                     What a pittifull and ſundry letter haſt thou written to Antigonus, on the death of thy childe Veriſsimus, thy ſonne ſo much deſired? Whoſe death thou tookeſt ſo, that thou exceedeſt the limits of Phyloſophie? but in the ende with thy princely vertues, thou didſt qualifie thy woful ſorows. What Sentences ſo profound, what wordes

ſo well couched didſt thou write in that booke intituled The remedy of the ſorrowfull, the which thou didſt ſend from the warre of Aſia, to the Senatours of Rome: and that was to comfort them after a ſore plague. And how much profite hath thy doctrine done ſince: with what new kinde of conſolation haſt thou comforted Helius Fabatus the Senſour, when his ſon was drowned in the riuer? where I do remember, that when we entred into his houſe, we found him weeping: and when wee went from thence, wee leſt him laughing.
                     I doe remember that when thou wentſt to viſite Gneus Ruſticus in his laſt diſeaſe, thou didſt ſpeake to him ſo effectuouſly, that with the vehemency of thy words, thou madeſt the teares to runne downe his cheekes. And I demanding him the occaſions of his lamentations, he ſaid: The Emperor The words of a wiſe man workes ſtrange effects: my Lord hath told me ſo much euils that I haue won, and of ſo much good that I haue loſt, that I weepe, I weepe not for life which is ſhort, but for death which is long. The man whom aboue all thou haſt loued, was Torquatus whom thou didſt obey as thy father, and ſeruedſt as thy maſter.
                     This thy faithfull friend being readie to die, and deſiring yet to liue, thou ſendeſt to offer ſacrifices to the gods, not for that they ſhould graunt himſelfe, but that they ſhould haſten his death.
                     Herewith I being aſtonied, thy nobleneſſe to ſo ſatisfie my ignorance, ſayd vnto mee in ſecret theſe wordes. Maruell not Panutius to ſee me offer ſacrifices to haſten my friends death: and not to prolong his life: for there is nothing that the faithfull friend ought ſo much to deſire to true friend, as to ſee him ridde from the trauels of the earth, and to enioy the pleaſures of heauen.
                     
                     Why thinkeſt (thou moſt noble Prince) that I reduce all theſe things to thy memory, but for to demaund thee how it is poſſible, that I which haue heard thee ſpeake ſo well of death, doe preſently ſee thee ſo vnwilling to leaue life? ſince the gods commaund it, thy age willeth it, thy diſeaſe doth cauſe it, thy feeble nature doth permit it, the ſinfull Rome doth deſerue it, and the ſickle fortune agreeth, that for our great miſerie thou ſhouldeſt die. Why therefore ſigheſt How loath great men are to die. thou ſo much for to die? The trauels which of neceſſitie muſt needes come, with ſtout heart ought to be receiued. The cowardly heart falleth before hee is beaten downe: but the ſtout and valiant ſtomacke, in greateſt perill, recouereth moſt ſtrength. Thou art one man, and not two, thou oweſt one death to the gods, and not two: Why wilt thou therefore, being but one, pay for two? and for one onely life, take two deaths? I meane, that before thou endeſt life, thou dieſt for pure ſorrow.
                     After that thou haſt ſayled, and in the ſayling, thou haſt paſſed ſuch perill, when the gods doe render thee in the ſafe Hauen, once againe thou wilt runne into the raging Sea, where thou ſcapeſt the victorie of life, and thou dyeſt with the ambuſhments of death. Threeſcore and two yeeres haſt thou fought in the Field, and neuer turned thy backe: and feareſt thou now, beeing encloſed in the Graue? Haſt thou not paſſed the pykes, and bryers, wherein thou haſt beene encloſed: and now thou trembleſt, being in the ſure way? Thou knoweſt what dammage it is, long to liue, and now thou doubteſt of the profit of death, which enſueth. It is now many yeeres ſince death and thou haue beene at defyance, as mortall enemies: and now to lay thy hands on thy Weapons, thou flyeſt and turneſt thy backe.
                     Threeſcore and two yeeres are paſt,

ſince thou wert bent againſt fortune and now thou cloſeſt thy eyes, when thou oughteſt ouer her to triumph. By that I haue told thee, I meane, that ſince wee doe not ſee thee take death willingly at this preſent: we do ſuſpect that thy life hath not in times paſt beene very good: For the man which hath no deſire to appeare before the gods, it is a token he is loaden with vices.
                     What meaneſt thou moſt noble Prince? why weepeſt thou as an infant, and complaineſt as a man in deſpaire? If thou weepeſt becauſe thou dyeſt: I anſwer thee, that thou laugheſt as much when thou liuedſt. For of too much laughing in the life, proceedeth much wayling at the death. Who hath alwaies for his heritage, Too much merriment in life breedeth woe in death. appropriated the places being in the common wealth. The vnconſtancy of the minde, who ſhall bee ſo hardy to make ſteadie? I meane that all are dead, all die, &amp; all ſhall die: &amp; among all wilt thou alone liue? Wilt thou obtaine of the gods, that which maketh them gods? That is to ſay; that they make thee immortall as thē
                        ſelues? Wilt thou alone haue by priuiledge, that which the gods haue by nature? My youth demandeth thy age what thing is beſt, or to ſay better which is leſſe euill, to die well, or to liue euill. I doubt that any man may attaine to the meanes to liue well, according to the continuall and variable troubles and vexations which daily we haue accuſtomed to carrie betweene our hands, alwayes ſuffering hunger, cold, thirſt, care, diſpleaſures, temptations, perſecutions, euill fortunes, ouerthrowes, and diſeaſes.
                     This cannot be called life, but a long death: and with reaſon wee will call this life death, ſince a thouſand times we hate life. If an ancient man did make a ſhew of his life, from time he is come out of the intrailes of his mother, vntill the time hee entreth into the bowels of the earth, and that body would declare al the ſorrowes that he hath paſſed and the heart diſcouer all the ouerthrows of fortune, which he hath ſuffered: I imagine the gods would maruell, and men would wonder at the body which hath endured A cuſtome of the Grecians and Romains. ſo much, and the heart which hath ſo greatly diſſembled, I take the Greeks to be more wiſe, which weepe when their children bee borne, and laugh when the aged dye: then the Romanes which ſing when their children are borne, and weepe when the olde men die. Wee haue much reaſon to laugh, when the olde men die, ſince they dy to laugh: and with great reaſon wee ought to weepe, when the children are borne, ſince they are borne to weepe.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. LI. Panutius the Secretarie continueth his exhortation, admoniſhing all men willingly to accept death, &amp; vtterly to forſake the world and all his vanities.
                     
                     
                        SInce life is now condemned for euill, there remaineth nought elſe, but to approoue death to be good. Oh if it pleaſed the immortall gods, that as I oftentimes haue heard the diſputation of this matter: ſo now that thou couldeſt therewith profite. But I am ſorry that to the Sage and wiſe man, counſell ſometimes (or for the moſt part) wanteth. None ought to cleaue much to his owne opinion, but ſometimes he ſhould follow the counſell of the third perſon: For the man which in all things will follow

his owne aduiſe, ought well to be aſſured that in all, or the moſt part, hee ſhall erre.
                     O my Lord Marke, ſith thou art ſage, liuely of ſpirit, of great experience, and ancient, didſt not thou thinke, that as thou hadſt buried many, ſo likewiſe ſome ſhould burie thee? What imaginations were thine to thinke, that ſeeing the ende of their dayes, others ſhould not ſee the end of thy yeares? Since thou dieſt rich, honorably accompanied, olde, and aboue all, ſeeing thou dieſt in the ſeruice of the commonwealth, why feareſt thou to enter into thy graue? Thou haſt alwaies beene a friend, as much to know things paſt, as thoſe which were hid and kept ſecret. Since thou haſt prooued what honours and diſhonours deſerue, riches and pouertie, proſperitie and aduerſitie, ioy and ſorrow, loue and fear, vices and pleaſures: mee ſeemeth that nothing remaineth to know, but that it is neceſſarie to know what death is.
                     And alſo I ſweare vnto thee (moſt noble Lord) that thou ſhalt learne more in one houre, what death is, then in an hundred yeares what life meaneth: Since thou art good, and preſumeſt to be good, and haſt liued as good, is it better that thou die, and goe with ſo many good; then that thou ſcape, and liue amongſt ſo many euill? That thou feeleſt death, I maruell nothing at all, for thou art a man: but I doe maruell that thou diſſembleſt it not, ſince thou art diſcreet Many things doe the ſage men feele, Wiſe men do outwardly diſſemble inward griefes. which inwardly doe oppreſſe their heart, but outwardly they diſſemble them, for the more honour. If all the poyſon which in the ſorrowfull heart is wrapped, were in ſmall peeces in the feeble fleſh ſcattered: then the wals would not ſuffice to rubbbe, neither the nayles to ſcratch vs.
                     What other thing is death, but a trap or doore wherewith to ſhut the ſhop, wherein all the miſerie, of this wofull life are vendible? What wrong or preiudice doe the gods vnto vs, when they call vs before them, but from an old decayd houſe, to change vs to a new builded Pallace? And what other thing is the graue, but a ſtrong fort, wherin we ſhut our ſelues from the aſſaults of life, and broyles of fortune: Truely wee ought to bee more deſirous of that wee finde in death, then of that wee haue in life. If Helia Fabricia thy wife doe greeue thee, for that thou leaueſt her yong, doe not care: for ſhee preſently hath little care of the perill wherein thy The cuſtōe of many widowes. life dependeth. And in the end, when ſhe ſhall know of thy death, ſhee will be nothing greeued. Trouble not thy ſelfe for that ſhe is left a widdow: for yong women (as ſhee is) which are married to olde men (as thou) when their husbands die, they haue their eyes on that they can robbe, and their hearts on them whom they deſire to marrie. And ſpeaking with due reſpect, when with their eyes they outwardly ſeeme moſt for to bewayle: then with their hearts inwardly doe they moſt reioyce.
                     Deceiue not thy ſelfe in thinkeing that the Empreſſe thy wife is yong, and that ſhe ſhall finde none other Emperor with whom again ſhe may marrie. For ſuch, and the like, will change the cloth of gold, for gownes of skinnes. I meane, that they would rather the young ſhepheard in the field, then the olde Emperour in his royall pallace. If thov takeſt ſorrow for the children whom thou leaueſt I know not why thou ſhouldſt do ſo? For truely if it greeue thee now, for that thou dieſt: they are more diſpleaſed for that thou liueſt. The ſonne that deſireth not the death of his father, may be counted the onely Phenix of this world, for if the father bee

poore, he wiſheth him dead for that he is not maintained; and if hee rich he deſireth his death to enherite the ſooner.
                     Since therefore it is true (as indeed it is) it ſeemeth not wiſedome that they ſing, and thou weepe. If it greeue thee to leaue theſe goodly pallaces, and theſe ſumptuous buildings, deceiue not thy ſelfe therein. For by the god Iupiter I ſweare vnto thee, that ſince that death doth finiſh thee, at the end of threeſcore and two yeeres: time ſhall conſume theſe ſumptuous buildings in leſſe then 40. If it greeue thee to forſake the company of thy friends and neighbors, for them alſo take as little thought, ſince for thee they will not take any at all. For amongſt the other compaſſions that they ought to haue of the dead, this is true, that ſcarcely they are buried, but of their friends and neighbours they are forgotten. If thou takeſt greateſt thought for that thou wilt not die, as the other Emperours of Rome are dead: me ſeemeth that thou oughteſt alſo to caſt this ſorrow from thee: for thou knoweſt right well, that Rome hath accuſtomed to bee ſo vnthankefull to thoſe which ſerue her: that the great Scipio alſo would not be buried therein.
                     If it greeue thee to die, to leaue ſo great a Seignory, as to leaue the Empire, I cannot thinke that ſuch vanity be in thy head: for temperate and repoſed men, when they eſcape from ſemblable offices, doe not thinke that they loſe honour, but that they be free of a trouble ſome charge. Therefore if none of all theſe things moue thee to deſire life, what ſhould let thee that throgh thy gates enter not death it greeueth men to dy for one of theſe There are two things that grieue men at their death. two things, either for the loue of thoſe they leaue behinde them, or for feare of that they hope. Since therefore there is nothing in this life worthy of loue, nor any thing in death why we ſhould feare: why doe men feare to die? According to the heauy fighes thou fetcheſt, the bitter teares thou ſheddeſt, and according alſo to that great paine thou ſheweſt, for my part I thinke, that the thing in thy thought moſt forgotten was, that the gods ſhould commaund thee to pay this debt. For admit that all thinke that their life ſhall end, yet no man thinketh that death wil come ſo ſoon. For that men think neuer to die, they neuer begin their faults to amend: ſo that both life and fault haue end in the graue together.
                     Knoweſt not thou (moſt noble Prince) that the long night commeth the middeſt morning. Doeſt thou not know, that after the moiſt morning there cometh the cleare Sun? Knoweſt not thou that after the cleare Sun commeth the cloudy Element. Doeſt thou not know that after the darke myſt, there commeth extreme heate: And after the heate, commeth the horrible thunders: and after the thunders, the ſodaine lightnings: and after the perilious lightnings commeth the terrible haile: Finally I ſay, that after the tempeſtuous and troubleſome time, commonly commeth cleare and faire weather.
                     The order that time hath to make The ſame order that Time keepeth, man ought to follow. himſelfe cruell and gentle, the ſelfe ſame ought men to haue, to liue and die. For after the infancy commeth childhood, after childhood commeth youth, after youth commeth age, and after age commeth the feareful death: Finally, after that feareful death, commeth the ſure life. Oftentimes I haue read, and of thee not ſeldome heard that the gods onely which had no beginning, ſhall haue alſo no ending. Therefore mee thinketh (moſt noble Prince) that ſage men ought not to deſire to liue long: Formen which deſire to liue much: either it is for that

they haue not felt the trauels paſt, becauſe they haue bene fooles, or for that they deſire more time to giue themſelues to vices. Thou mighteſt not complaine of that, ſince they haue not cut thee in the flower of the herbe, nor taken thee greene from the tree, nor cut thee in the ſpring tide, and much leſſe eate thee eager before thou wert ripe.
                     By that I haue ſpoken, I meane, if death had called thee when thy life was ſweeteſt: though thou hadſt not had reaſon to haue complayned, yet thou mighteſt haue deſired to haue altered it: For it is a greater griefe, to ſay vnto a yong man that he muſt die, and forſake the world. What is this (my Lord) now that the wall is decaied ready to fall, the flower is an hered the grape doth rot, the teeth are looſe the gowne is worne, the lance is blunt the knife is dull, and doſt thou deſire to returne into the world, as if thou hadſt neuer knowne the world? Theſe threeſcore and two yeeres thou haſt liued in the proportion of this body, and wilt thou now that the yron fetters haue rot thy legges, deſire yet to lengthen thy daies, in this ſo wofull priſon? They that will not be contented to liue threeſcore yeeres and fiue This tranſitory life not worth the deſiring. in this death, or to die in this life: will not deſire to liue threeſcore thouſand yeeres.
                     The Emperour Auguſtus Octauian ſaide: That alter men had liued fiftie yeeres, either of their owne will they ought to dye; or elſe by force they ſhould cauſe themſelues to bee killed. For at that time, all thoſe which haue any humaine felicitie, are at the beſt. Thoſe which liue aboue that age, paſſe their daies in grieuous torments. As in the death of children, in the loſſe of goods, and importunitie of ſonne in lawes, in maintaining proceſſes, in diſcharging debts, in fighing for that is paſt, in bewayling that that is preſent, in diſſembling iniuries, in hearing woful newes, and in other infinite trauels. I So that it were much better, to haue their eyes ſhut in the graue: thē their hearts and bodies aliue, to ſuffer Man neuer happy till death. ſo much in this miſerable life. He whom the gods take from this miſerable life at the end of fiftie yeeres, is quitted from all theſe miſeries of life. For after that time hee is not weake, but crooked, hee goeth not, but rowlleth, he ſtumbleth nor but falleth.
                     O my Lord Marke, knoweſt thou not, that by the ſame way whereby goeth death, death cometh? Knoweſt not thou in like manner that it is 62. yeers that life hath fled from death: &amp; that there is another time aſmuch, that death goeth ſeeking thy life? and death going from Illiria where he left a great plague, &amp; thou departing frō thy pallace ye two haue now met in Hungarie? Knoweſt not thou, that where thou leapedſt out of thy mothers intrailes to gouerne the land, immediately death leaped out of his grauè to ſeeke thy life? Thou haſt alwayes preſumed, not onely to bee honored, but alſo to be honorable, if it bee ſo, ſince thou honouredſt the Embaſſadors of Princes which did ſend them the more for their profite, then for thy ſeruice, why doſt thou not honor thy meſſenger, whom the gods ſend more for thy profite, then for their ſeruices? Doeſt thou not remember well, when Vulcan my ſonne in law poyſoned me, more for the couetouſneſſe of my gods, then any deſire that hee had of my life? thou Lord that diddeſt come to comfort mee in my chamber, and toldſt me that the gods were cruell to ſlay the yong, and were pitiful to take the old from this world. And thou ſaidſt further theſe wordes: Comfort thee Panutius, for if thou wert borne to the, now thou dreſt to liue.
                     
                     Since therefore (noble Prince) that I tell thee that which thou toldſt

me, and counſell thee the ſame which thou counſelleſt me: I render to thee that which thou haſt giuen me. Finally of theſe vines I haue gathered theſe cluſter of grapes.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. LII. The anſwer of the Emperour Marcus to Panutius his Secretarie, wherein he declareth that he tooke no thought to forſake the world: but all his ſorow was to leaue behind him an vnhappie child to inherit the Empire,
                     
                     
                        
                           PAnutius bleſſed be the milke which thou haſt ſucked in Dacia, the bread which thou haſt eaten in Rome, the larning which thou haſt learned in Greece, and the bringing vppe which thou haſt had in my pallace. For thou haſt ſerued as a good ſeruant in life, and giueſt mee good counſell as a truſtie friende at death. I command Commodus my ſon to recompence thy ſeruice, and I beſeech the immortall gods, that they acquite thy good counſels. And not without good cauſe I charge my ſon with the one, and requrie the gods of the other. For the payment of many ſeruices, one man alone may doe; but to pay one good counſell, it is requiſite to haue all the gods. The greateſt good that a friend can doe to his friend, is in great and waightie affaires, to giue him good and wholeſome counſell. And not without cauſe I ſay wholeſome: For commonly it chaunceth, that thoſe which thinke with their counſell to remedy vs, doe put vs oftentimes in greateſt perils. All the trauells of life are hard, but that of death is the moſt hard and terrible. Al are great, but this is the greateſt. All are perillous, but this is moſt perrillons. All in death haue ende except the trauell of death, whereof wee The trauell of death is harder then all the trauell of life. know no end, that which I ſay now, no men perfectly can know, but he which ſeeth himſelfe, as I ſee my ſelfe now at the point of death.
                     Certainly Panutius, thou haſt ſpoken vnto mee as a wiſe man: but for that thou knowſt not my griefe, thou couldſt not cure my diſeaſe, for my ſore is not there, where thou haſt layde the plaiſter. The fiſtula is not there where thou haſt cutte the fleſh. The opilation is not there; where thou haſt layd the oyntments. There were not the right veines, where thou didſt let me bloud. Thou haſt not yet touched the wound, which is the cauſe of all my griefe. I meane that thou oughteſt to haue entred further with mee to haue knowne my griefe better.
                     The ſighes which the heart fetcheth (I ſay thoſe which come from the heart) let not euerie man think which heareth them, that he can immedialy vnderſtand them: For as men cannot remedie the anguiſhes of the ſpirit, ſo the gods likewiſe would not that they ſhould know the ſecrets of the heart.
                     Without feare or ſhame many dare ſay, that they know the thought of others, wherein they ſhew themſelues to bee more fooles, then wiſe. For ſince there are many things in me wherein I my ſelfe doubt: how can a ſtranger haue any certaine knowledge therein.
                     Thou accuſeſt me Panutius, that I feare death greatly, the which I deny: but to feare it as man, I doe confeſſe: For to deny that I feare not death, ſhould bee to denie that I am not of fleſh.
                     We ſee by experience, that the Elephants do feare the Lyon, the Beare

the Elephant, the wolfe the Beare, the Lambe the Wolfe, the Rat the Cat, the Cat the Dog, the Dog the man: Finally the one and the other do feare for no other thing, but for feare that one killeth not the other. Then ſince bruite beaſts refuſe death, the which though they die, feare not to fight with the ſuries, nor hope not to reſt with the gods: ſo much the more ought we to feare death, which die in doubt, whether the furies will teare The cauſe why men feare death. vs in peeces with their torments, or the gods will receiue vs in to their houſes with ioy.
                     Thinkeſt thou Panutius, that I doe not ſee well my vine is gathered, and that it is not hid vnto me, that my palace falleth in decay? I know well, that I haue not but the kernell of the Raiſon, &amp; the skin: and that I haue not but one ſigh of all my life, vntill this time. There was great difference betweene me and thee, &amp; now there is no great difference betwixt me and my ſelfe. For about the enſign, thou doſt place the army. In the riuers, thou caſteſt thy nets; within the parkes thou hunteſt the buls: in the ſhadow thou takeſt cold. By this I meane, that thou talkeſt ſo much of death, becauſe that thou art ſure of thy life.
                     O miſerable man that I am, for in ſhort ſpace, of all that is life I haue poſſeſſed: with mee I ſhall carrie nothing but onely my winding ſheete.
                     Alaſſe how ſhall I enter into the field, not where of fierce beaſts I ſhall bee aſſaulted: but of the hungrie wormes deuoured. Alaſſe I ſee my ſelfe in that diſtreſſe, from whence my fraile fleſh cannot eſcape. And if any hope remaine, it is in thee O death. When I am ſicke, I would not that hee that is whole ſhould comfort me. When I am ſorrowfull, I would not that he which is merrie ſhould comfort me. When I am banniſhed I would not that hee which is in proſperitie ſhould comfort mee. When I am at the houre of death, I would not that hee ſhould comfort me, which is not in ſuſpition of life. But I would that the poore ſhould comfort me in pouertie, the ſorrowfull in my ſorrowes, the baniſhed in my baniſhment, and he which is in as great danger of his life, as I am now at the point of death. He giues beſt counſel to the ſorrowfull that is himſelfe likewiſe tormented.
                     
                     For there is no counſell ſo healthfull, nor true, as that of the man which is in ſorrow, when he counſelleth another, which is likewiſe tormented himſelfe. If thou conſidereſt well this ſentence, thou ſhalt finde that I haue ſpoken a thing profound, wherein notwithſtanding my tongue is appeaſed. For in my opinion euill ſhall hee be comforted, which is weeping with him, that continually laugheth. I ſay this to the ende thou know, that I know it; and that thou perceiue that I perceiue it.
                     And becauſe thou ſhalt not liue deceiued, as to my friend I will diſcloſe the ſecret: and thou ſhalt ſee, that ſmal is the ſorrow which I haue, in reſpect of the great, which I haue cauſe to haue. For if reaſon had not ſtriued with ſenſualtie, the ſighes ended my life, and in a pond of teares, they had made my graue.
                     The things which in mee thou haſt ſeene, which abhore meate, to baniſh ſleepe, to loue care, to bee annoyed with company, to take reſt in ſighes, and to take pleaſures in teares: may eaſily declare vnto thee, what torment is in the ſea of my heart, when ſuch tremblings doe appeare in the earth of my body.
                     Let vs now come to the purpoſe, and we ſhal ſee why my bodie is without conſolation, and my heart ouercome with ſorrowes: for my feeling greatly exceeds my complaining, becauſe the body is ſo delicate, that in ſcratching it, it complaineth: and the

heart is ſo ſtout and valiant, that though it be hurt, yet it diſſembleth.
                     O Panutius, I let thee know, that the occaſion why I take death ſo grieuouſly, is becauſe I leaue my ſonne The occaſion why Aurelius tooke his death heauily 
                        Commodus in this life: who liueth in this age moſt perillous for him, and no leſſe dangerous for the Empire. By the flowers are the fruits knowne, by the grapes the vines are knowne, and by the face men are knowne: by the colt the horſe is iudged, and by the infant, youth is knowne.
                     This I ſay by the Prince my ſonne, for that hee hath bene euill in my life, I doe imagine that he will bee worſe after my death. Since thou (as well as I) knowſt the euill conditions of my ſonne, why doeſt thou maruell at the thoughts and ſorrowes of the father? My ſon Commodus in yeares is yong, and in vnderſtanding yonger. Hee hath an euill inclination, and yet hee will not enforce himſelfe againſt the ſame, hee gouerneth himſelfe by his owne ſence, and in matters of wiſedome he knoweth little: of that hee ſhould be ignorant, hee knoweth too much: and that which is worſt of all, he is of no man eſteemed. Hee knoweth nothing of things paſt, nor occupieth him about any thing preſent.
                     Finally, for that which mine eyes haue ſeene, I ſay, and that which within my heart I haue ſuſpected I iudge: that ſhortly the perſon of my ſonne ſhall be in hazard, and the memory of his father periſh. O how vnkindely haue the gods vſed themſelues toward vs, to command vs to leaue our honour in the hands of our children? for it ſhould ſuffice, that wee ſhould leaue them our goods: and that to our friends we ſhould commit our honor. But yet I am ſorry, for that they conſume the goods in vices: and loſe the honour for to bee vitious. The gods being pittifull as they are, ſince they giue vs the authoritie to diuide our goods: why do they not giue vs leaue to make our wils of the honor.
                     My ſonnes name being Commodus in the Romain tongue, is as much to ſay, as profite: but as he is, wee will be content to bee without little profite, which he may do to ſome, ſo that we may bee excuſed of the great damage, which he is likely to doe to all. For I ſuppoſe hee will be the ſcourge of men, and the wrath of God. He entreth now into the pathway of youth, alone without a guide. And for that he hath to paſſe by the high and dangerous places: I feare leſt hee bee loſt, in the wood of vices.
                     For the children of Princes and Children brought vp in liberty &amp; wantonnes eaſily fals into vices. great Lord
                           •
                         for ſo much as they are brought vp in libertie and wantonneſſe, doe eaſily fal into vices, and voluptuouſneſſe: and are moſt ſtubborn to be withdrawne from folly.
                     O Panutius, giue attentiue eare to that I ſay vnto thee. Seeſt thou not that Commodus my ſonne is at libertie, is rich, is yong, and is alone? By the faith of a good man, I ſweare vnto thee, that the leaſt of theſe windes would ouerthrow, not onely a young tender Aſh, but alſo a mightie ſtrong Oake. Riches, youth, pride, and liberty are foure plagues which poyſon the Prince, repleniſh the common wealth with filth, kill the liuing, and defame the dead. Let the olde men beleeue me, and the young men marke mee well what I ſay, that where the gods haue giuen many gifts, it is neceſſary they haue many vertues to ſuſtaine them.
                     The gentle, the peaceable, the coūterfeit, the ſimple, and the fearefull, doe not trouble the common wealth: but thoſe whom nature hath giuen moſt gifts. For as experience teacheth vs, with the faireſt women the ſtewes are furniſhed, the moſt proper perſonage are vnſhamefaſt, the moſt ſtout and valiant are murderers, the moſt

ſubtill are theeues, and men of cleareſt vnderſtanding, oft times become moſt fooles.
                     I ſay, and ſay againe, I affirme, and affirme againe, I ſweare and ſweare againe, It is perillous to be adorned with naturall giftes, &amp; to want requiſite vertues. that if two men which are adorned with naturall gifts, doe want requiſite vertues, ſuch haue a knife in their hands, wherewith they do ſtrike and wound themſelues, a fire on their ſhoulders, wherewith they burne themſelues, a rope at their neckes to hang themſelues, a dagger at theyr breaſt wherewith they kill themſelues, a thorne in their foote, wherwith they pricke themſelues, and ſtones whereat they ſtumble: ſo that ſtumbling they fall, and falling they finde themſelues with death whom they hate, and without life, which ſo much they loued.
                     Note well Panutius note, that the man which from his infancy hath alwayes the feare of the gods before his eyes, and the ſhame of men, ſaieth truth to all, and liueth in preiudice to none: and to ſuch a tree, though euill fortune do cleaue, the flower of his youth doe wither, the leaues of theyr fauours drie, they gather the fruites of his trauels, they cut the bough of his offices, they bow the higheſt of his branches downewards; yet in the end though of the windes hee be beaten, hee ſhall neuer be ouercome.
                     O happy are thoſe Fathers, vnto whom the Gods haue giuen quicke children, wiſe, fayre, able, light, and valiant: but all theſe giftes are but meanes to make them vicious. And in ſuch caſe, if the Fathers would bee gouerned by my counſell, I would rather deſire that members ſhould want in them, then that vices ſhould abound. Of the moſt faireſt children which are borne in the Empire, my ſonne Commodus the Prince is one: But I would to the immortall Gods, that in face hee reſemble the blackeſt of Ethiope: and in manners, the greateſt Philoſopher of Greece: For the glory of the Father is not, nor ought not to bee, in that his child is fayre of complexion, and handſome of perſon What parents ſhould glory of in their children. but that in his life hee bee very vpright.
                     Wee will not call him a pittifull Father, but a great enemy, who exalteth forth his child for that he is faire, and doth not correct him, though hee be vicious. I durſt ſay, that the father which hath a child endued with many goodly gifts, and that hee doth employ them all to vices: ſuch a child ought not to bee borne in the world, and if perchance he were borne, hee ought immediately to be buried.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. LIII. The Emperour Marcus Aurelius concludeth his matter, and ſheweth that ſondry young Princes for being vicious haue vndone themſelues, and empoueriſhed their Realms.
                     
                     
                        O What great pitty is it to ſee how the father buyeth his child of the gods with ſighes, how the mother deliuers thē with pain, how, they both nouriſh them with trauels, how they watch to ſuſtain them, how they labour to remedy them, &amp; afterwards they haue ſo rebelled, and be ſo vicious, that the miſerable Fathers oftentimes do die not for age, but for the griefes wherewith their children torment them. I doe remember, that the Prince Commodus my ſonne beeing young, and I aged (as I am) with great paines we kept him from vices: but I feare, that after my death hee will hate vertues. I remember many yong

Princes, which of his age, haue inherited th'Empire of Rome: who haue bin of ſo wicked a life, that they haue deſerued to looſe both honour and life..
                     I remember Dennys, the famous tyraunt of Scycile: of whom is ſaide, that as great reward hee gaue to thoſe that inuented vices, as our Mother Rome did, to thoſe which cōquered realms: Such worke could not be, but of a tyraunt to take them for moſt familiar, which are moſt vicious.
                     I remember foure young Princes, which gouerned the Empyre, but not with ſuch valiauntnes as the great Alexander: that is to ſay, Alexander, Antiochus, 
                        Many yong vicious princes in Rome. 
                        Syluius, and Ptholomeus: vnto whom for their vanity and lightnes, as they called Alexander the Great, Emperour in Greece: ſo likewiſe do they call theſe young men, tyrants in Aſia.
                     
                     Very happie was Alexander in life, and they vnhappy after his death. For all that which with glorious triumphs hee wanne, with vile vices they loſt. So that Alexander deuided betweene them foure, the worlde: and afterwards it came into the handes of moe then foure hundreth.
                     I doe remember, that king Antigonus little eſteemed that, which coſt his Lorde Alexander much. Hee was ſo light in the behauiour of his perſon, and ſo defamed in the affayres of the Common-wealth: that for mockerie and contempt, in the ſteed of a crown of golde, hee bare a garland: in the ſteed of a ſcepter, hee carryed nettles in his hand: and of this ſort and manner he ſate to iudge among his counſellors, &amp; vſed to talke with ſtrangers.
                     This yong Prince doth offend me much, for the lightnes he committed: but much more I maruell at the grauitie of the Sages of Greece, which ſuffered him. It is but meete hee be partaker of the paine, which condeſcended to the faulte.
                     I do remember Caligula the fourth Emperor of Rome, who was ſo young and fooliſh, that I doubt of theſe two things, which was greateſt in his time, That is to ſay: The diſobedience that the people bare to their Lorde, or the hate which the Lord bare to his people. For, that vnhappie creature was ſo diſordered in his manners: that if all the Romaines had not watched to take life from him: hee would haue watched to take life from them.
                     This Caligula wore a brooche of The cruell inſcription, in Coligulaes brooch gold in his cap, wherein were written theſe wordes: Vtinam omnis populus vnam preciſe ceruicem haberet, vt vno ictu omnes necarem: Which is to ſay: would to God all the people had but one necke, to the ende I might kill them all at a ſtroke.
                     I remember the Emperour Tiberius, th'adoptiue ſonne of the good Caeſar Auguſtus, which was called Auguſtus: becauſe hee greatly augmented the Empyre. But the good Emperor did not ſo much augment the ſtate of his Common-wealth, during his life, as Tyberius did diminiſh it, after his death. The hate and malice which the Romain people bare to Tiberius in his life, was manifeſtly diſcouered after the time of his death. For the day that Tyberius dyed (or better to ſay, when they killed him) the Romaine people made great proceſſions, and the Senators offered great preſents in the temples, and the prieſts gaue great Sacrifices to their Gods: and all to the end their gods ſhold not receiue the ſoule of this Tyraunt amongſt them, but that they would ſende it to be kept among the Furyes of hell.
                     I remember Patrocles (2. K. of Corinth) inherited the realm at xxii. yeres of his age, who was ſo diſordred of his fleſh, ſo indiſcret in his doings, ſo couetous of goods, &amp; ſuch a coward of his perſon, that wher his father had poſſeſſed the Realm 40. yeres, the ſonne did not poſſeſſe it thirtie moneths.
                     
                        
I remember Tarquine the prowde, who though among eight Knights of Rome was the laſt, and comlyeſt of geſture, valiaunt in Armes, Nobleſt of bloud, and in giuing moſt liberall: yet he employed all his gifts and grace
                           •
                         which the Gods had giuen him euill. For, hee employed his beautie to ryot, and his forces to tyrannie. For, through the treaſon &amp; villanie, which hee committed with the Romaine Lucretia, he did not only loſe the realme, and flying ſaued his life: but alſo for euer was baniſhed, and all his Linage likewiſe.
                     I remember the cruell Emperour Nero, who liued, inherited, and dyed young: and not without a cauſe (I ſay) that hee liued and dyed young. For, in him was graffed the ſtocke of the noble &amp; worthie Caeſars: and in him was renued the memory of thoſe tyrants: To whom thinkeſt thou Panutius this Tyrant would haue giuen life, ſince he with his owne hand gaue his Mother her death?
                     Tell mee (I pray thee) who thinkeſt thou hath made that curſed heart, who ſlewe his Mother, out of whoſe The cruelty of Nero, to his Mother. wombe he came? opened the breaſts which gaue him ſucke? Shedde the bloud wher of he was born? Tore the armes in which hee was carryed? &amp; ſaw the entrails wherin he was formed.
                     The day that the Emperour Nero ſlewe his mother, an Orator ſaid in the Senate: Iure interficienda erat Agrippina, qua tale portentum peperit in populo Romano.
                     Which is to ſay, iuſtly deſerued Agrippina to bee put to death, which brought forth ſo ſtraunge a Monſter, amongſt the Romaine people.
                     Thou oughtſt not therefore to maruell (Panutius) at the nouelties which thou haſt ſeene in mee: For in theſe three dayes that I haue been troubled in my minde, and altered in my vnderſtanding: all theſe things are offered vnto me, and from the bottome of my hart I haue digeſted them. For the carefull men are not blinded, but with their owne imaginations. All theſe euill conditions which theſe Princes had ſcattred amongſt them (of whom I haue ſpoken) doe meete together, in my Sonne Commodus.
                     
                     For, if they were young, he is young: if they were rich, hee is rich: if they were free, he is free: if they were bold, he is bolde: if they were wilde, he is wilde: if they were euill, certainely I doe not thinke that hee is good.
                     For, wee ſee manie young Princes, which haue beene well brought vp, and well taught: yet when they haue inherited, and come to their Lands, they become immediately vicious and diſſolute. They ſeldome mend that are vicious in youth.
                     
                     What hope haue wee of thoſe, which from their infancie are diſſolute and euill enclined? Of good wine I haue made oft times ſtrong vivineger: but of pure vineger, I haue neuer ſeene good wine.
                     This childe keepeth mee betweene the ſailes of Feare, and the Ancker of hope: hoping he ſhall be good, ſince I haue taught him well, and fearing he ſhall be euill, becauſe his mother Fauſtine hath nouriſhed him euill. And that which is the worſt, that the yong childe of his owne nature, is inclined to all euill,
                     I am moued to ſay thus much, for that I ſee his naturall inclination increaſe: and that which was taught him diminiſh. For the which occaſion, I doubt that after my death, my ſonne ſhall returne to that, wherin his mother hath nouriſhed him: and not to that, wherein I haue taught him.
                     O how happy had I beene, if neuer I had had childe, or not to be bounde to leaue him the Empire: For I would chuſe then, among the children of the good Fathers: &amp; would not be bound to ſuch a one, whom the gods haue giuen me.
                     
                        
One thing I aske thee Panutius, whom wouldeſt thou call moſt fortunate? Veſpatian, which was naturall father of Domitius, or Nerua, the adopted father of the good Traiane: both thoſe two, (Veſpatian and Nerua) were good Princes, but of children, Domitian was the head of all miſchiefe: and Traiane was the mirrour of all goodneſſe. So that Veſpatian in that he had children, was vnhappy, and Nerua in that hee had none, was moſt fortunate.
                     One thing I will tell thee Panutius, the which by thee conſidered, thou wilt little eſteeme life, and ſhalt loſe the feare of death. I haue liued threeſcore and two yeares, wherein I haue read much, hard much, ſeene, deſired, attained, poſſeſſed, ſuffered, and I haue much reioyced my ſelfe. And in the end of all this, I ſee my ſelfe now to die, and I muſt want my pleaſures, and my ſelfe alſo. Of all that I haue had, poſſeſſed, attained, and whereof I haue enioied, I haue only two things to ſay, paine for that I haue offended the gods, and ſorrow for the time which I haue waſted in vices.
                     There is great difference between The difference betweene the poore and the rich in death. the rich and the poore in death, and more in life. For the poore dieth to iuſt, but if the rich die, it is to their treat paine. So that the gods take from the one, that which he had, and putteth the other in poſſeſſion, of that he deſired.
                     Great care hath the heart to ſeeke the goods, and they paſſe great troubles to heape vp them together, and great diligence muſt bee had in keeping them, and alſo much wit to encreaſe them: but without compariſon, it is greater griefe to depart from them.
                     O what paine intollerable, and griefe it is to the wiſe man, ſeeing himſelfe at the point of death, to leaue the ſweet of his family, the maieſtie of his Empire, the honour of his preſent, the loue of his friends, the payments of his debts, the deſerts of his ſeruants and the memory of his predeceſſors, in the power of ſo euill a childe, the which neither deſerueth it, nor yet will deſerue it.
                     In the ninth Table of our auncient Lawes, are written theſe words: Wee ordaine and commaund, that the father which ſhall be good according to the opinion of all, may diſherite his ſonne, who according to the opinion of all is euill. The Law ſaid further.
                     
                        The childe which hath diſobeyed his father, robbed any holy Temple, iniuried any widdow, fled from any battle, and committed any treaſon to a ſtraunger, that hee ſhould bee baniſhed from 
                        Vicious children by an ancient law diſinherited. 
                        Rome, and dſinherited from his fathers goods.
                     
                     Truly the law was good, thogh by our offences it bee forgotten. If my breath faile mee not as it doth faile me (for of troth I am greatly pained) I would declare vnto thee how many Parthes, Medians, Egyptians, Aſsirians, Caldeans, Indians, Hebrewes, Greekes, and Romaines, haue left their children poore beeing able to haue left them rich, for no other cauſe, but for that they were vitious. And to the contrary, other beeing poore, haue left them rich, for that they were vertuous.
                     By the immortall gods I ſweare vnto thee, that when they came from the warre of Parthia, and triumphed in Rome, and confirmed the Empire to my ſonne, if then the Senate had not withſtood mee, I had left Commodus my ſonne poore with his vices, &amp; wold haue made heir of all my Realmes, ſome vertuous man. I let thee know Panutius, that fiue things oppreſſe my heart ſore, to the which I wold rather ſee remedy my ſelfe, then to command other to remedie it.
                     
                        
The firſt, for that in my life time I cannot determine the proceſſes, that the vertuous widdow, Druſia hath with the Senate.
                     Becauſe ſince ſhe is poore, and deformed, there is no man that will giue her iuſtice.
                     The ſecond, becauſe I die not in Rome. And this for none other cauſe, thē that which the ſound of the trumpet ſhould bee proclaimed, that all thoſe which haue any quarrel, or debt againſt me, and my family, ſhould come thither to be paid, or ſatisfied of their debts and demands.
                     The third, that as I made foure tyrants Fiue things that oppreſſed Marcus Aurelius heart. to bee put to execution, which committed tiranny in Aſia and Italy, ſo it greeued mee that I haue not alſo puniſhed certaine pirates, which roued on the ſeas.
                     The fourth, for that I haue not cauſed the temple to bee finiſhed which I did beginne for all the gods. For I might haue ſayde vnto them after my death, that ſince for all them I haue made one houſe: it were not much that any of them ſhuld receiue one into his, which paſſe this life in the fauour of the gods, and without the hatred of men. For dying after this ſort, men ſhall ſuſteine our honours: and the gods ſhall prouide for our ſoules.
                     The fifth, for that I leaue in life for my onely heire, Commodus the Prince, yet not ſo much for the deſtruction which ſhall come to my houſe: as for the great dammage which ſhall ſucceed in the commonwealth. For the true Princes ought to take the dammages of their perſons light, and the dammages of the commonwealth for the moſt grieuous.
                     O Panutius, let therefore this be the laſt word which I will ſay vnto thee, that is to ſay, that the greateſt good that the gods may giue to the man that is not couetous, but vertuous, is to giue him good renowme in life: and afterwardes a good heire at our death.
                     Finally, I ſay, that if I haue any thing to do with the gods, I require, and beſeech them, that if they ſhould be offended, Rome ſlandered, my renowme defamed, and my houſe diminiſhed, for that my ſonne be of an euill life: that they will take from him life, before they giue me death,
                  
                  
                     CHAP. LIIII. Of the words which the Emperour Marcus Aurelius ſpake vnto his ſonne Commodus at the houre of death, neceſſary for all young gentlemen to vnderſtand.
                     
                     
                        SInce the diſeaſe of Marcus Aurelius was ſo extreme that euery houre of his life he was aſſaulted with death: after he had talked a long time with Panutius his Secretarie, he commanded his ſonne Commodus to be wakened, who as a yong man ſlept ſoundly in his bed. And being come before his preſence, all thoſe which were there, were moued immediatly with compaſſion, to ſee the eyes of the father all ſwollen with weeping: and the eyes of the childe, cloſed with ouermuch ſleepe.
                     They could not waken the childe, he was ſo careleſſe: and they could not cauſe the good father ſleepe, he tooke ſo great thought.
                     All thoſe which were there, ſeeing how the father deſired the good life of the ſonne, and how little the ſonne wayed the death of his father

had compaſſion of the olde perſon, and bare hate to the wicked childe. Then the good Emperour caſting his eyes on high, and directing his words to his ſonne ſayde.
                     When thou wert a childe, I tolde thy maſters how they ought to bring thee vp, and after that thou diddeſt waxe greater, I tolde thy Gouernors how they ſhould counſell thee: And now I will tell thee, how thou with them, which are few, and they with thee beeing one, ought to gouerne and maintaine the Commonwealth. If thou eſteeme much that which I will ſay vnto thee, my ſonne: Know thou, that I will eſteeme much more then thou wilt beleeue me: for more eaſily doe wee olde men ſuffer your iniuries, then yee other young men doe receyue our counſels. Wiſdome wanteth to you for to beleeue vs, yet wee want not boldneſſe to diſhonour you. And that which is worſt, the aged in Rome, were wont to haue a chayre of wiſdome &amp; ſageneſſe: but now a dayes the young men count it a ſhame and folly. The world at this day is ſo changed, from that it was wont to bee in times paſt: that all haue the audacity to giue counſell, and few haue the wiſedome to receyue it, ſo that they are a thouſand which tell counſels, and there is not one that buyeth wiſedome.
                     I beleeue well, my ſonne, that according to my fatall Deſtenies, and thy euill manners, little ſhall that auayle which I ſhall tell thee: for ſince thou wouldeſt not credit theſe words which I ſpake vnto thee in my life: I am ſure that thou wilt little regard them after my death.
                     But I doe this, more to ſatisfie my deſire, and to accompliſh that which I owe vnto the Commonwealth, then for that I hope for any amendment of thy life.
                     For there is no griefe that doth ſo much hurt a perſon, as when hee himſelfe is cauſe of his owne paine. If any man doth mee an iniurie, if I lay my hands vpon him, or ſpeake iniurious words vnto him, my heart is forthwith ſatisfied: but if I doe iniurie to my ſelfe, I am he which wrongeth, and am wronged, for that I haue none on whom I may reuenge my wrong, and I vexe and chaſe with my ſelfe.
                     If thou my ſonne bee euill, after that thou haſt enherited the Empire, my mother Rome wil complaine of the gods which haue giuen thee ſo many euill inclinations. Shee will complaine of Fauſtine thy mother which hath brought thee vp ſo wantonly, ſhe will complaine of thee which haſt no will to reſiſt vice: but ſhee ſhall haue no cauſe to complaine of the olde man thy Father, who hath not giuen thee good counſels. For if thou hadſt beleeued that which I tolde thee, mē would reioyce to haue thee for theyr Lord, and the Gods to vſe thee as their Miniſter.
                     I cannot tell my ſonne, if I bee deceyued, but I ſee thee ſo depriued of vnderſtanding, ſo vncertaine in thy words, ſo diſſolute in thy manners, ſo vniuſt in iuſtice, in that thou deſireſt ſo hardy, and in thy duty ſo negligent, that if thou change and alter not thy manners, men will hate thee, and the Gods will forſake thee.
                     O if thou kneweſt my ſonne, what a thing it is to haue men for their enemies, and to be forſaken of the gods: by the faith of a good man I ſweare vnto thee, that thou wouldeſt not onely hate the Seigniorie of Rome, but with thy handes alſo thou wouldeſt deſtroy thy ſelfe: For men which haue not the Gods mercifull, and the men friendly, doe eate the bread of griefe, and drinke the teares of ſorrow.
                     
                        I am ſure thy ſorrow is not ſo great

to ſee the night doth end my life, as is that pleaſure which thou haſt, to ſee that in ſhort ſpace thou ſhalt bee Emperour of Rome. And I do not maruell hereat, for where ſenſuality raigneth, reaſon is baniſhed, and conſtrained to flye.
                     Many loue diuers things, becauſe of truth they know them not: the which if they did know, without doubt they would hate them. Thogh men loue in mockerie, the Gods and men hate vs in earneſt.
                     In all things wee are ſo doubtfull, and in all our works ſo diſordred, that at ſome time our vnderſtanding is dull, and loſeth the edge: and another time, it is more ſharpe then it is neceſſary. Thereby I meane, that the good we will not heare, and much leſſe wee will learne it, but of the euill wee know, more then behoueth vs, or neceſſitie requireth. The counſell of the Emperour to his ſonne Comodus.
                     
                     I will counſell thee, my ſonne by words, that which in ſixtie two years, I haue learned by ſcience and experience. And ſince thou art as yet ſo young, it is reaſon that thou beleeue him which is aged; For ſince wee Princes are the mirrour of all, euery man doth behold vs, and wee other doe not behold our ſelues. This day or to morrow, thou ſhalt enherite the Romane Empire, and thinke that inheriting the ſame, thou ſhalt bee Lord of the world. Yet if thou kneweſt how many cares and perils, commaunding bringeth with it. I ſweare vnto thee, that thou wouldeſt rather chooſe to obey all, then to command one. Thou thinkeſt my ſonne, that I leaue thee a great Lord, for to leaue thee the Empire, which is not ſo: for all they haue neede but of thee, and thou alone haſt neede of all
                     Thou thinkeſt I leaue thee much treaſure, leauing thee the great reuenues of the Empire, that which alſo is as little: for though a Prince haue treaſures in aboundance, yet if hee want friends, hee hath great want of treaſures. Thou thinkeſt alſo my ſonne, that I leaue thee to bee obeyed of all, and that none dare againe ſay thee.
                     Truly it ought not to bee ſo: for it is more meete for the Prince (which deſerueth to preſerue his life, and augment his honour) to bee conformable to the will of all, then to deſire that all ſhould bee agreeable to him: For thou, my ſonne, that knoweſt not what truth is, lyes will not grieue thee: for as much, as thou knoweſt not what reſt is, the broyles and motions of the people ſhall not vex thee; For that thou knoweſt not what friends meane, thou ſhalt eſteeme it little to haue enemies: for if thou wert patient, repoſed, true and a louing man, thou wouldeſt not onely refuſe the Empire of Rome, but alſo thou wouldſt curſe the father which would leaue thee ſuch inheritance. I would know, if thou knoweſt it not, that in leauing thee the Empire, I doe leaue thee not riches, but pouerty, not reſt, but trauel, not peace but war, not friends but enemies: not pleaſures but diſpleaſures. Finally, in peace I do leaue thee, where alwayes thou ſhalt haue ſomwhat to bewayle: &amp; though thou wouldeſt, thou ſhalt not laugh: I aduertiſe, admoniſh, and alſo exhort thee my ſon, to think all which I leaue thee is vanity, lightnes, folly, and a diſguiſed mockery. And if thou beleeueſt it is in mockry, henceforth I know thou art deceiued; I haue liued longer then thou, haue read more, and with pain haue gon further then thou. And in the end I find my ſelfe mocked: hopeſt, thou to liue ſurely, and eſcape without fraude? when thou ſhalt think to haue the Empire in reſt, then ſhall ariſe a prouince in Africa or Aſia, the loſſe ſhould come to great damage, &amp; to recouer it, great charges wold enſue.
                     
                        
When thou thinkeſt to recouer Friends, then ſhall ſtrange enimies inuade thee. So that in flattering, and reioycing our Friendes, wee can not keepe them; and in flying, and reiecting them, wee cannot defend our ſelues. When thou ſhalt thinke to be in greateſt ioy, then ſhall ſome care oppreſſe thy hart. For Princes which haue and poſſeſſe much, the newes which giue them pleaſure, are very ſeldome: but the things which annoy them, come hourely. When thou ſhalt thinke to haue libertie, to doe what thou wilt, then ſhalt thou bee moſt reſtrayned.
                     For, the good and well ordered Princes, ought not to goe whither their wanton deſires moueth them: but whither it is moſt lawfull and decent for the honour of their Eſtates: When thou ſhalt thinke that none dare reproue thee, for that thou art What words cannot doe treaſon will. Emperour, then oughtſt thou moſt to beware. For, if they dare not threaten euill Princes with wordes, they haue the hardineſſe to ſell them by Treaſon. If they dare not puniſh them, they dare murmour at them: and theſe which cannot bee their friends, doe procure to bee their enemies. Finally, if they lay not hands on their perſons, they let their tongue runne at large, to prate of their renowme. When thou ſhalt thinke to haue ſatisfied thy Seruaunts, then will they demaund recompence for their ſeruices.
                     For, it is an olde cuſtome among Courtyers, to ſpend freely, and to couet greedily. Therefore if thou doſt credite theſe things, I knowe not who is ſo fooliſh, that for his enheritance deſireth ſuch ſorrow. For, admit that any man come to the Empire, without compariſon the reſt is more worth, which the Fmpyre taketh from him: then all the pleaſures which it giueth him?
                     If the Empyre of Rome were as well corrected and ordered, as in olde time it was accuſtomed to be: though it were great paine to gouerne it, yet it were more honour to keepe it, but it is ſo rooted in vices, and ſo many Tyrants are entred therein, that I would take them more wiſe, to iudge it is a mockery, then thoſe which embrace it as an honour.
                     If thou knewſt what Rome is worth, what Rome hath, what Rome may, and what Rome is, I ſweare vnto thee, that thou wouldeſt not labour much to be lord thereof. For though Rome with walls be ſtrongly compaſſed: yet of vertuous Citizens is greatly vnprouided. If the inhabitants be great, the vices are without number.
                     Finally I ſay, that the ſtones which are in the buyldings, in one day may be counted: but the euills which are The ſinnes of a populous Cittie not to be numbred. therein, in a thouſand yeares cannot bee declared. By the faith of a good man, I ſweare vnto thee my ſonne, that when I began to reigne, in three yeares I repayred the decayed walles that were of Rome fallen, and one onely ſtreete to liue well, in twenty yeares I could not reforme.
                     The diuine Plato ſayd verie well: That much more ought the great cities to glorifie, to haue vertuous Citizens, then to haue proud and ſumptuous buildings. Beware, beware my ſonne, that the inconſtancie of youth, and the libertie which thou haſt to poſſeſſe, and gouerne the Empire, cauſe thee not to vndo thy ſelfe. For he is not coūted free which in liberty is borne, but he that dieth in libertie. O how many I haue read, heard, and alſo ſeene which are borne ſlaues and afterwards haue died free: and this for that they were vertuous. And how many I haue ſeene die ſlaues beeing borne free onely for being vitious, ſo that their libertie remaineth, where nobleneſſe is reſident. Princes which

haue great Realmes, of neceſſitie ſhall haue occaſion to puniſh many exceſſes: wherfore it is requiſite that they be couragious. And beleeue mee my Sonne, that they ought not to take courage vpon them, becauſe they bee mightie and puiſſant: but becauſe they are vertuous. For, to puniſh theſe exceſſes of others, that good life is more requiſite, then is the great authortitie of the Empire.
                     A vertuous Prince ought to leaue no vice vnpuniſhed: For the good, to follow good, and the euill for feare of his correction, dare not commit any offence in the Common-wealth. He that liueth like a wiſe man, is hardy to giue puniſhment: but hee that liueth in feare, dare not almoſt ſpeake. For, the man which dare bee ſo hardie, to puniſh an other, for the ſelfe ſame faulte, and tranſgreſſion for the which hee deſerueth to be puniſhed: of the Gods hee is iuſtly hated, and of men deſpiſed.
                     Let Princes take it for an aſſured thing, that they ſhall neuer haue the loue of the people, the libertie of the Common-wealth, the order of their houſe, the contentation of their Friendes, the ſubiection of their enemies, and the obedience of their people: but with manie Teares ſhed on the earth, and with manie proweſſes of his perſon.
                     To a vertuous Prince, all doe render: and againſt the vicious Prince. all the earth doth rebell. Now if thou wilt bee vertuous, heare what thing vertue is.
                     Vertue is a Caſtle, which neuer is taken: a Riuer which is not paſſed ouer: a Sea, which is not ſayled: a Fire, which neuer is quenched: a Treaſure, that neuer is waſted, an Armie, that neuer is ouerthrowne: a Chaunge, which neuer wearieth: a Spye, which euer returneth: a ſigne, which beguyleth no man: a way very ſtraight: a Friend, that ſuccoureth all neceſſities: a Surgion, that immediately healeth: and a Renowne which neuer periſheth.
                     If thou kneweſt (my Sonne) what thing it is to be good, thou wouldſt be the beſt of the world. For the more vicious a man is, ſo much the more hee is intangled in vices: and how As vice intangleth the vicious, ſo vertue cleaneth to the vertuous. much more a man is vertuous, ſo much more to vertues he cleaueth. If thou wilt bee vertuous, thou ſhalt doe ſeruice to the Gods, thou ſhalt giue good renowme to thy predeceſſours, and for thy ſelfe thou ſhalt prepare a perpetuall memorie: Thou ſhalt doe pleaſures to ſtraungers, and get thee fauour of thine owne people. Finally, the good will honour thee with loue: and the euill will ſerue with feare.
                     In the hyſtories of the warres of the Tarentines, I found that renowmed Pyrrus (king of the Epyrots) did weare in a ring theſe words written, It is too little puniſhment for a vicious man, to take his life from him: and it is too ſmall reward for a vertuous man to giue him the ſeigniorie of all the whole earth. Truly, theſe wordes were worthy of ſuch a man.
                     What thing can bee begunne of a vertuous man, whereof wee hope not to ſee the end, and come to good proofe? I am deceyued, if I haue not ſeene in my dayes, many men, which were baſe borne, vnfitte for ſciences, voide of vices in the Common welth, poore of goods, and vnknowne of birth, which with all theſe baſe conditions haue learned ſo many vertues, that it ſeemed great raſhneſſe to beginne them, and afterwards for being vertuous onely, they haue founde the effects ſuch as they thought it.
                     By the immortall Gods I ſweare vnto thee, and ſo the God Iupiter take me into his holy houſe, and confirme thee my ſonne in mine: if I haue

not knowne a Gardner and a Porter in Rome, which for beeing vertuous, were occaſion to caſt fiue rich Senators out of the Senate. And the cauſe to make the one to gaine, and the other to loſe, was that to the one they would not pay the pots, and to the other his apples: For at that time more was hee puniſhed, which tooke an apple from a poore man, then hee which beat downe a rich mans houſe.
                     All this I haue tolde thee my ſon, becauſe vice abaſeth the hardy prince, and vertue giueth courage to the baſhfull. From two things I haue alwayes kept my ſelfe, That is to ſay; not to ſtriue againſt open iuſtice, nor to contend with a vertuous perſon.

                        HItherto I haue ſpoken to thee generally, but now I wil ſpeake vnto thee particularly, and by the immortall gods I coniure thee, that thou bee very attentiue to that I will ſay: For talking to thee as an aged Father, it is reaſon thou heare mee as an obedient childe.
                     If thou wilt enioy long life, obſerue well my doctrine: For the gods will not condiſcend to thy hearts deſires, vnleſſe thou receyue my wholeſome counſels. Diſobedience of children is their vndoing.
                     
                     The diſobedience and vnfaithfulneſſe which children haue to their fathers, is all their vndoing: for oftentimes the gods do pardon the offences that are done vnto them: and do not pardon the diſobediences which the children bare to their Fathers. I doe not require thee my ſonne, that thou giue mee money, ſince thou art poore. I doe not demaund that thou trauell ſince thou art tender. I doe not demaund the reuengement of mine enemies, ſince I haue none. I doe not demaund that thou ſerue me ſince I dye.
                     I doe not demaund the Empire, ſince I leaue it vnto thee. Onely I demaund, that thou gouerne thy ſelfe well in the Common wealth, &amp; that the memory of my houſe bee not loſt through thee. If thou eſteeme much that I leaue vnto thee ſo many realms, I thinke it better to leaue to thee many good counſels, wherewith thou mayeſt preſerue thy ſelfe, ſuſtaine thy perſon, and maintaine thine honour: For if thou haſt preſumption not to profite with my counſell, but to truſt to thine owne mind, before my fleſh be eaten with wormes, thou ſhalt be ouercome with thy enemies.
                     My ſonne, I haue beene young, light, bold, vnſhamefaſt, proud, enuious, couetous, an adulterer, furious, a glutton, ſlothfull, and ambitious, and for that I haue fallen into ſo great exceſſes, therfore I giue thee ſuch good aduiſe: for that man which in his youth hath beene very worldly, from him in age proceedeth ripe counſell. That which vntill this time I haue counſelled thee, &amp; that which to my Ripe counſell proceedeth from the aged. death I will counſell thee, I deſire that once at the leaſt thou proue it: And if it doe thee harme, leaue it, and if it doe thee good, vſe it: For there is no medicine ſo bitter, that the ſicke doth refuſe to take: if thereby hee thinke hee may bee healed. I pray thee, I exhort thee, and I aduiſe thee my ſonne, that thy youth beleeue my age, thy ignorance beleeue my knowledge,

thy ſleepe beleeue my watch, the dimneſſe of thy eyes, beleeue the cleareneſſe of my ſight, thy imagination beleeue my vertue, and thy ſuſpition beleeue my experience. For otherwiſe, one day thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelfe in ſome diſtreſſe, where ſmall time thou ſhalt haue to repent, and none to finde remedy. Thou mayeſt ſay vnto me, my ſonne, that ſince I haue beene young, I let thee to bee young, and that when thou ſhalt bee aged, thou wilt amend: I aunſwere thee, that if thou wilt liue as young, yet at leaſt gouerne thy ſelfe as olde: In a Prince which gouerneth his cō
                        mon wealth well, many miſeries are diſſembled of his perſon: euen as for mighty affayres ripe counſels are neceſſary: ſo to endure the troubles of the Empire, the perſon needeth ſome recreation: for the bow-ſtring which alwaies is ſtretched, either it lengthneth or it breaketh. Whether Princes be young or old, there can be nothing The paſtime that Princes ſhould ſeeke more iuſt then for the recreation of themſelues to ſeeke ſome honeſt paſtimes. And not without a cauſe, I ſay, that they bee honeſt: for ſometimes they accompany with ſo diſhoneſt perſons, and ſo vnthrifty: that they ſpend their goods, they loſe their honour, and weary their perſons more, then if they were occupied in the affaires of the common wealth: For thy youth, I leaue thee children of great Lords, with whom thou maieſt paſſe the time away: And not without cauſe I haue prouided that with thee they haue been brought vp from thy infancy: for after thou cameſt to mans eſtate, inheriting my goods, if perchance thou wouldeſt accompany thy ſelf with yong men, thou ſhouldſt find them well learned: for thy wars I leaue thee valiant captains, though (indeed) things of war are begunn by wiſedome: yet in the end, the iſſue falleth out by fortune: for ſtewards of thy treaſurs, I leaue thee faithful men: And not without cauſe, I ſay, they are faithfull: for oftentimes greater are the theeues which are receiuers, and treaſurers, then are they that doe rob among the people. I leaue thee, my ſonne, expert and ancient men, of whom thou maieſt take counſell, and with whom thou maieſt communicat thy troubles: for there can bee fourmed no honeſt thing in a Prince, vnleſſe hee hath in his company auncient Princes are to accompanie Ancient men. men: for ſuch giue grauitie to his perſon, and authoritie to his pallace: To inuent Theaters, to ſiſh ponds, to chaſe wilde beaſts in the forreſts, to runne in the fields, to let thy haukes flye, and to exerciſe weapons, al theſe things we can denie thee, as to a yong man, and thou being yong, mayeſt reioice thy ſelfe in all theſe. Thou oughteſt alſo to haue reſpect, that to ordaine armes, inuent warres, follow victories, accept truces, confirm peace raiſe bruites, to make lawes, to promote the one, and put down the others, to puniſh the euill, and firſt to reward the good, the counſell of all theſe things ought to bee taken of cleare iudgements, of perſons, of experience, and of white heads. Thinkeſt thou not, that it is poſſible to paſſe the time with the yong, and to counſell with the old? The wife and diſcreet Princes, for all things haue time enough, if they know well how to meaſure it.
                     Beware my ſonne, that they note thee not to vſe great extremities: for the end and occaſion why I ſpeake it, is becauſe thou ſhouldſt know, if thou knoweſt not, that it is as vndecent a thing for a Prince, vnder the colour of granitie, to bee ruled and gouerned wholie by olde men, as vnder ſemblance of paſtime, alwaies to accompanie himſelfe with the yong: It is no generall rule, that all young men are light, nor all old men ſage:

And thou muſt according to my aduiſe, in ſuch caſe vſe it thus: if any old All young men are not light, nor all olde men ſage. man loſe the grauity of his age, expulſe him from thee: if thou finde any young men ſage, deſpiſe not their counſell: For the Bees doe drawe more honey out of the tender flowers, then of the hard leaues. I do not condemne the aged, nor I doe commend the young; but it ſhall bee well done, that alwayes thou chooſe of both the moſt vertuous: For of truth there is no company in the Worlde, ſo euill ordered, but that there is mean to liue with it, without any ſuſpition: ſo that if the young are euill with ſolly, the olde are worſe through couetouſneſſe.
                     Once againe, I returne to aduertiſe thee (my ſonne) that in no wiſe thou vſe extremitie: for if thou beleeue none but young, they will corrupt thy manners with lightneſſe, and if thou beleeue none but the old, they will depraue thy iuſtice through couetouſneſſe, What thing can bee more monſtrous, then that the prince which commaundeth all, ſhould ſuffer him to be commaunded of one alone? Beleeue me ſonne, in this caſe that the gouernements of many, are ſeldome times gouerned well by the Princes that rule many, muſt take counſell of many. head of one alone. The Prince which hath to rule and gouerne many, ought to take the aduiſe and counſell of many. It is a great inconuenience, that thou beeing Lord of many Realmes, ſhouldſt haue but one gate, wherein all doe enter into to doe their buſineſſe with thee: For if perchance he which ſhall be thy familiar, be of his owne nature good, and be not mine enemy: yet I would be afraid of him, becauſe hee is a friend of mine enemies. And though for hate they doe me no euill, yet I am afraide that for the loue of another, he will ceaſe to do me good. I remember that in the Annalles of Pompeius, I found a little booke of memories, which the great Pompeius bare about him, wherein were many things that he had reade, and other good counſels, which in diuers parts of the world he had lerned: and among other wordes there were theſe: The Gouernour of the Commonwealth which committeth all the gouernment to old men, deſerueth very little, and hee that truſteth all young, is light: Hee that gouerneth it by himſelfe alone, is beyond himſelfe: and he which by himſelfe and others doth gouerne it, is a wiſe Prince,
                     
                     I know not whether theſe ſentences are of the ſame Pompeius, or that hee gathered them out of ſome book, or that any Philoſopher had told him them, or ſome friend of his had giuen him them. I meane, that I had them written with his hands, and truly they Weighty affayres are to be diſpatched by counſell. deſerued to bee written in letters of gold. When thy affayres ſhall bee waighty, ſee thou diſpatch them alwayes by counſell: For when the affaires be determined by the counſell of many, the fault ſhall be diuided among them all. Thou ſhalt finde it for a truth (my ſonne) that if thou take counſell of many, the one will tel the inconuenience, the other the perill, other the feare, the other the damage, the other the profite, and the other, the remedy: finally, they will ſo debate thy affayrs, that plainly thou ſhalt know the good, and ſee the danger thereof.
                     I aduertiſe thee (my ſon) that when thou takeſt counſel, thou behold with thy eyes the inconuenience, as well as the remedies which they ſhall offer vnto thee: for the true counſell conſiſteth not, to tell what they ought to doe, but to declare what thereof is like to ſucceede. When thou ſhalt enterpriſe (my ſon) great and weighty affayres, as much oughteſt thou to regard the little dammages for to cutte them off in time, as the great miſhaps

to remedy them. For oftenttmes it chanceth, that for the negligence of taking vp a gutter, the whole houſe falleth to the ground. Notwithſtanding, I tell thee, thou take counſell, I meane not, that thou oughteſt to be ſo curious, as for euery trifle to cal thy counſell: for there are many thinges of ſuch quality, that they would bee immediately put in execution: and they doe endammage themſelues, attending for counſell. That which by thine own authority thou mayeſt diſpatch without the dammage of the Common-wealth, referre it to no other perſon: and herein thou ſhalt be iuſt, and ſhalt doe iuſtice conformable: for conſidering that thy ſeruice dependeth onely of them, the reward which they ought to haue, ought to depend onely on thee.
                     I remember that when Marius the Conſull came from the warres of Numedia, he diuided all the treaſure hee brought among his ſouldiers, not putting one jewell into the common Treaſurie. And when hereof hee was accuſed, for that he had not demaunded licence of the Senat: he anſwered them. It is not iuſt I take counſell with others, for to giue recompence to thoſe, which haue not taken the opinions of others to ſerue me.
                     Thou ſhalt find my ſonne, a kind of men, which are very hard of money, and exceeding prodigal of counſell. There are alſo diuers lenders, which without demaunding them, doe offer to giue it. With ſuch like Whoſe coū
                           ſell is to be refuſed. men, thou ſhalt haue this counſell, neuer looke thou for good counſell at that man, whoſe counſell tendeth to the preiudice of another: for he offereth words to thy ſeruice, and trauelleth thy buſineſſe to his owne profite. As the gods gaue me long life, of theſe things haue I had great experience, wherein I let thee know, that for the ſpace of xv. yeares I was Conſull, Senator, Cenſor, Pretor, Queſtor, Edil, and Tribune: and after all this, I haue beene 18. yeares Emperour of Rome, wherein all thoſe which haue ſpoken moſt againſt me, touched the profite or damage of another. The chief intention of thoſe which follow the Courts of Princes, are to procure to augment their houſes. And if they cannot come to that, they ſeeke to diminiſh that of another, not for that any profite ſhould follow vnto them thereof, be it neuer ſo little: but becauſe mans malice is of ſuch condition, that it eſteemeth the profite of another his owne dammage.
                     They ought to haue great compaſſion of the Prince, for the moſt that follow him, ſerue him not for that they loue him, but for the gifts and rewards which they hope to haue of him. And this ſeemeth to be true, for the day that Princes ſhall ceaſe to giue them, the ſelfe ſame day beginne they for to hate him. So that ſuch ſeruants, wee cannot call friends of our perſons, but couetous of our goods. That thou loue my ſonne, the one aboue the other, thou mayeſt right well: but I aduertiſe thee, that thou, nor they do make any ſemblance, in ſuch ſort that all doe know it: for if thou doeſt otherwiſe, they will murmur at thee, &amp; will all perſecute thee.
                     Hee incurreth into no ſmall perill, nor hath no little trouble, which is aboue all of the Prince beloued, and of the people hated. For then hee is hated and perſecuted of all: and yet more damage enſueth vnto him: of the enmity of all: then doth of the loue of the Prince alone: for ſometimes, the gods permitting it, and his behauior deſeruing it, the prince doth ceaſe to loue him, and therewith his enemies beginne to perſecute him: From the time I knew what meaned to gouerne a Common weale, I haue alwayes determined, neuer to

keepe man in my houſe one day after I knowe him to bee an enemie to the Common-wealth.
                     In the yeare of the Foundation of Rome, 649. Lucius Lucullus the Senatour going to the warres againſt Mythridates, by chaunce found a tablet of coppper, in the cittie called Trigane: the which was at the gate of the king of that Prouince. And on the ſame was engrauen certaine Caldean letters, the which in effect ſaide theſe words:
                     The Prince is not ſage, who will put The marks of an vndiſcreet prince or ruler. in hazzard the ſtate of his Commonwealth, for the onely commoditie of one alone: For the ſeruice of one, can not auaile againſt the loue of all.
                     The Prince is not ſage, that for to enrich one alone, ſeeketh to empoueriſh all: For it is a thing intollerable, that one doe labour the fields, and the other doe gather the fruite.
                     The Prince is not iuſt, which will ſatiſfie the couetouſnes of one, more then the ſeruices of all: For there is mean to pay the ſeruices of the good, and there is no Riches to ſatisfie the couetouſnes of the euill. The prince is a foole that deſpiſeth the counſell of all, and truſteth in the opinion of one. For though there bee in a great Ship, but one pilot, yet it needeth many mariners. Bolde is the Prince, which to loue one onely, wilbe hated of all: For noble Princes ought to think it much profite, to be beloued, and much more diſpleaſure to be hated. Theſe were the words which were written in that tablet, worthy of eternall memory. And I will tell thee further in this caſe, that Lucullus the Senatour ſent on the one part that Tablet of copper, where theſe wordes were: &amp; on the other part, the coffers wherein he had brought the riches, to the end the Senate ſhould choſe one, and leaue the other. The Senate deſpiſing the riches and Treaſours, choſe the Tablet of counſells.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. LVI. The Emperour followeth his matter, and exhorteth his Sonne vnto certaine particular things worthy to be engraued in the hearts of men.
                     
                     
                        VNtil now I haue ſpoken as a father to his Sonne, that which toucheth thy profit. Now I will tell thee what thou ſhalt doe after my death, for my ſeruice. And if thou wilt bee the true Sonne of thy Father, the things which I haue loued in my life, ſhall be of thee eſteemed after my death: Do not reſemble many Children, which after theyr Fathers haue cloſed their Eyes, doe remember them no more. For in ſuch caſe, though indeede the Fathers be dead and buryed: yet they are alwaies liuing, to complaine to the Gods of their children.
                     Though it ſeemeth not to be ſlaunderous, yet it is more perilous to contend with the dead, then to iniure the liuing. And the reaſon is for that the liuing may reuenge, and are for to anſwere, It is more perillous to iniure the dead then the liuing. but the dead cannot make aunſwer, and much leſſe they can bee reuenged. And in ſuch caſe the Gods do take their cauſe in protection: and ſomtimes they execute ſuch cruell puniſhment of thoſe that liue, that rather then they would endure it, rhey wiſh to be dead.
                     Thou oughtſt to thinke (my Sonne) that I haue begoten thee, I haue nouriſhed thee, I haue taught thee, I haue trymmed thee, I haue chaſtiſed thee, and I haue exalted thee.
                     And for this onely conſideration, though by death I am abſent: it is not reaſon that thou euer forget me: For the true, and not vnthankefull Childe, ought the ſame day to bury

his Father in his tender hart, when others haue laide him in the harde graue. One of the viſible chaſticements The duty of a thankefull child. which the Gods giue to men in this world is, that the children obey not their Fathers in their life: For the ſelfe ſame fathers did not remember their owne fathers after their death. Let not young Princes thinke after they haue inherited, after they ſee their Father dead, and after they are paſt correction of their Maſters, that all things ought to bee done as they themſelues will it, for it wil not be ſo: For they want the fauour of the gods, and haue malediction of their fathers: they liue in trouble, &amp; dye in danger. I require nought elſe of thee, my ſonne, but that ſuch a father as I haue been to thee in my life: ſuch a ſonne thou be to mee after my death. I commend vnto thee my ſonne, the veneration of the Gods: and this chiefly aboue all things: for the Prince which maketh account of the gods, need not to feare any ſtorm of fortune.
                     Loue the gods, and thou ſhalt bee beloued. Serue them, and thou ſhalt bee ſerued: Feare them, and thou ſhalt be feared, honour them, and thou ſhalt be honoured, Doe their commaundements, and they will giue thee thy hearts deſire: for the gods are ſo good, that they doe not onely receiue in account that which we do: but alſo that which we deſire to doe. I commend vnto thee (my ſonne) the reuerence of the Temples, that is to ſay, that they be not in diſcord, that they be cleane and renued, that they offer therin the ſacrifice accuſtomed: For wee doe not this honour, to the ſubſtance wherewith the Temples are made: but to the gods, to whome they are conſecrated. I commend vnto thee the veneration of Prieſts, &amp; Miniſters are to bee honoured of all men. I pray thee, though they be couetous, auaritious, diſſolute, vnpatient, negligent, and vitious: yet that they bee not diſhonoured: for to vs others, it appertaineth, not to iudge of the life they lead as men: but wee muſt conſider that they are mediators between the gods and vs.
                     Behold, my ſonne, that to ſerue the Gods, honour the Temples, and reuerence the Prieſts, it is not a thing voluntary, but verie neceſſarie for Princes: For ſo long endured the glorie of the Greekes, as they were worſhippers of their goods, and carefull of their temples. The vnhappy realm of Carthage was nothing more cowardly, nor leſſe rich, then that of the Romanes, but in the ende of the Romaines, they were ouercome: becauſe they were great louers of their treaſures, and little worſhippers of their Temples. I commend vnto thee (my ſonne) Helia thy ſtepmother, and remember, though ſhe be not thy mother, yet ſhee hath beene my wife. That which to thy mother Fauſtine thou oughteſt for bringing thee into the world, the ſelfe ſame thou oughteſt to Helia, for the good entertainement ſhe hath ſhewed thee. And indeed, oftentimes I beeing offended with thee, ſhee maintained thee, and cauſed me to forget: ſo that ſhee by her good wordes, did winne againe that, which thou by thy euill workes didſt loſe. Thou ſhalt haue my curſe if thou vſeſt her euill: and thou ſhalt A good admonition for children how to vſe their ſtepmothers. fall into the ire of the Gods, if thou agreeſt that other doe not vſe her well: For all the damage which ſhee ſhall feele, ſhall not bee, but for the inconuenience of my death, and iniury of thy perſon: For her Dowrie, I leaue her the tributes of Heſtia, and the Orchards of Vulcanus, which I haue made to bee planted for her recreation.
                     Be thou not ſo hardy to take them from her: for in taking them from her, thou ſhalt ſhew thy wickednes,

and in leauing them her, thy obedience, and in giuing her more, thy bounty and liberality. Remember (my ſonne) that ſhee is a Romane woman, young, and a widdow, and of the houſe of Traiane my Lord, &amp; that ſhee is thy mother adoptatiue, and my naturall wife: and aboue all, for that I leaue her recommended vnto thee. I commend vnto thee my ſons in law, whom I will thou vſe as parents and friends. And beware, that thou be not of thoſe which are brethren in words, and couſins in workes: Bee thou aſſured that I haue willed ſo much good to my daughters, that the beſt which were in all the Countries, I haue choſen for their perſons. And they haue beene ſo good, that if in giuing them my daughters, they were my ſonnes in law: in loue I loued them as children.
                     I commend vnto thee my ſiſters and daughters, whom I leaue thee all married, not with ſtrange Kings, but with naturall Senators. So that all dwell in Rome where they may doe thee ſeruices, and thou mayeſt giue them rewards and gifts. Thy ſiſters haue greatly inherited the beauty of thy mother Fauſtine: and haue taken little nature of their Father Marke.
                     
                     But I ſweare vnto thee that I haue giuen them ſuch husbands, and to their husbands, ſuch and ſo profitable counſailes, that they would rather loſe their life then agree to any thing touching their diſhonour.
                     Vſe thy ſiſters in ſuch fort that they be not out of fauour, for that their aged Father is dead, and that they become not proud for to ſee their brother Emperour. Women are of a very tender condition: for of ſmall occaſion they doe complaine, and of Women are of a tender condition. leſſe they waxe proud. Thou ſhalt keepe them and preſerue them after my death, as I did in my life: For otherwiſe, their conuerſation to the people ſhall bee very noyſome, and to thee very importunate. I commende vnto thee, Lipula thy youngeſt ſiſter, which is incloſed within the Virgine Veſtals, who was daughter of thy mother Fauſtine, whom ſo dearely I haue loued in life, and whoſe death I haue bewailed vntill my death. Euery yeere I gaue to thy ſiſter ſixe thouſand ſexterces for her neceſſities: and indeeed I had married her alſo, if ſhee had not fallen into the fire, and burnt her face. For, though ſhe were my laſt, I loued her with all my heart. All haue eſteemed her fall into the fire for euill lucke: but I doe count that euill lucke for good fortune. For her face was not ſo burned with coales as her rerenowne ſuffered perill among euill tongues.
                     I ſweare vnto thee (my ſonne) that for the ſeruice of the gods, and for the renowne of men: ſhe is more ſure in the temple with the Veſtall Virgins, then thou art in the Senate with thy Senators. I ſuppoſe now that at the end of the iourney ſhee ſhall find her ſelfe better to be encloſed, then thou at liberty. I leaue vnto her in the prouince of Lucania, euery yeare ſixe thouſand ſexterces: trauell to augment them for her, and not to diminiſh them. I commend vnto thee Druſia the Roman widdow, who hath a proceſſe in the Senate: For in the times of the commotions paſt her husband was baniſhed, and proclaymed Traytor. I haue great pitty of ſo noble and worthy a widdow: for it is now three monethes ſince ſhee hath put vp her complaint, &amp; for the great warres I could not ſhew her iuſtice. Thou ſhalt finde my ſonne) that in 35. yeares I haue gouerned in Rome, I neuer agreed that any widow ſhould haue any ſute before me aboue eight dayes: Be carefull to fauour and diſpatch the orphans and widdows: for the needy widdow, in what place ſoeuer

they be, do incur into great danger. Not without cauſe I aduertiſe thee, that thou trauell to diſpatch thē ſo ſoone as thou mayeſt: and to adminiſter iuſtice vnto them: for throgh the prolonging of beautifull womens ſuites, their honour and credite is diminiſhed: ſo that their buſineſſe being prolonged, they ſhall not recouer ſo much of their goods as they ſhall loſe of their renowme. I commend vnto thee (my ſonne) my olde ſeruants, which with my yong yeeres, and my cruell wars, with my great neceſſities, with the cumbrance of my body, and my long diſeaſe, haue had great trouble: and as faithful ſeruants oftentimes to eaſe me, haue annoyed themſelues. It is conuenient ſince I haue profited of their life, that they ſhould not loſe by my death. Of one thing I aſſure thee, that though my body remaine with the worms in the graue: yet before the gods I will remember them. And herein thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſelfe to be a good child, whē thou ſhalt recompence thoſe which haue ſerued thy Father well.
                     All Princes which ſhall do iuſtice Princes that doe iuſtice, doe get enemies in the execution thereof. ſhall get enemies in the execution thereof. And ſith it is done by the hands of thoſe which are neere him, the more familiar they are with the Prince, the more are they hated of the people: all in generall doe loue iuſtice but none do reioyce that they execute it in his houſe. And therfore after the Prince endeth his life, the people will take reuenge of thoſe which haue beene miniſters thereof. It were great infamy to the Empire, offence to the gods, iniurie to mee, vnthankefulnes to thee, hauing found the armes of my ſeruants, ready eighteene yeers, that thy gates ſhould be ſhut againſt them one day.
                     Keepe, keepe theſe things (my ſonne) in thy memory: and ſince particularly I doe remember them at my death, conſider how heartily I loued them in my life.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. LVII. The good Marcus Aurelius Emperour of Rome, endeth his purpoſe and life: And of the laſt words which he ſpake to his ſonne Commodus, and of the table of Counſels which he gaue him.
                     
                     
                        WHen the Emperor had ended his particular recommendations The Emperour here concludeth his ſpeech, and endeth his life. vnto his ſonne Commodus, as the dawning of the day beganne to appeare: ſo his eyes beganne to cloſe, his tongue to faulter, and his handes to tremble, as it doth accuſtome to thoſe, which are at the point of death. The Prince perceyuing then little life to remaine, commaunded his Secretary Panutius to goe to the coffers of his bookes, and to bring one of the coffers before his preſence: out of the which hee tooke a table of 3. foote of bredth, and 2. of length, the which was of Eban, bordered all about, with Vnicorne. And it was cloſed with 2. lids very fine, of red wood, which they call raſing, of a tree where the Phenix (as they ſay) breedeth, which did grow in Arabia. And as there is but one onely Phenix, ſo in the world is there but one onely tree of that ſort. On the vttermoſt part of the Table, was grauen the god Iupiter, and on the other the goddeſſe Venus: and in the other was drawne the god Mars, and the goddeſſe Diana. In the vppermoſt part of the table, was carued a Bull, and in the nethermoſt part was drawne a King. And they ſayde the painter of ſo famous and renowmed

a worke, was called Apelles.
                     
                     The Emperour taking the Table in his handes, caſting his eyes vnto his Sonne, ſaid theſe words: Thou ſeeſt my ſonne, how from the turmoyles of Fortune I haue eſcaped, and how I into miſerable deſtinies of death do enter, where by experience I ſhall know what ſhall be after this life.
                     I meane not now to blaſpheme the Gods, but to repent my ſinnes. But I would willinglie declare why the Gods haue created vs: ſince there is ſuch trouble in life, and paine in death. Not vnderſtanding why the Gods haue vſed ſo great crueltie with creatures. I ſee it now, in that after lxij. yeares, I haue ſayled in the daunger and perill of this life: now they commaund mee to land, and harbour in the graue of death.
                     Now approcheth the houre wherein the band of Matrimonie is looſed, the threede of Life vntwined, the key Death altereth all things. doth locke, the ſleepe is wakened, my life doth ende, and I goe out of this troubleſome paine.
                     Remembring mee of that I haue done in my life, I deſire no more to liue: but for that I knowe not whether I am carryed by death. I feare and refuſe his darts. Alas what ſhall I doe, ſince the Gods tell mee not what I ſhall do? What counſell ſhall I take of any man, ſince no man will accompanie mee in this iourney?
                     Oh what great diſceipt? Oh what manifeſt blindnes is this, to loue one thing all the dayes of our life, and to cary nothing with vs after our death?
                     Becauſe I deſired to be rich, they let me dye poore: Becauſe I deſired to liue with companie, they let me die alone. For ſuch ſhortnes of life, I know not what hee is, that will haue a houſe: ſince the narrow graue is our certaine manſion place? Belieue mee my ſonne, that manie things paſt doe grieue mee ſore: but with nothing ſo much I am troubled, as to come ſo late to the knowledge of this life: For if I could perfectly belieue this, neyther ſhould men haue cauſe to reproue me, neyther yet I now ſuch occaſion to lament me
                     Oh how certaine a thing is it, that men when they come to the point of death, doe promiſe the Gods, that if they prerogue their death, they will amend their life? but notwithſtanding: I am ſorry that we ſee them deliuered from death, without any manner of amendment of life.
                     They haue obtained that, which of the Gods they haue deſired: and haue not performed that which they haue prorniſed. They ought aſſuredly to thinke, that in the ſweeteſt time of their life, they ſhall be conſtrained to Deferring of the puniſhment is not the pardoning of the fault. accept death. For, admit that the puniſhment of ingrate perſons be deferred: yet therefore the fault is not pardoned.
                     Be thou aſſured (my Sonne) that I haue ſeene ynough, hearde, ſelte, taſted, deſired, poſſeſſed, eaten, ſlept, ſpoken, and alſo liued ynough. For, vices giue as great troubles to thoſe which follow them much: as they do great deſire to thoſe which neuer proued them. I confeſſe to the immortall Gods, that I haue no deſire to liue: yet I enſure thee, I would not die. For, life is ſo troubleſome that it wearyeth vs: and Death is ſo doubtfull, that it feareth vs. If the Gods deferred my death, I doubt whether I ſhould reforme my life? And if I do not amend my life, nor ſerue the gods better, nor profit the commonwealth more: and if that euery time I am ſick, it ſhould grieue mee to dye: I ſay it is much better for mee now to accept death, then to wiſh the lengthening of my life. I ſay the life is ſo troubleſom, ſo fickle, ſo ſuſpicious, ſo vucertaine, and ſo importunate. Finally I ſay, it is a life without life: that hee is an obſtinate

foole, which ſo much deſireth it. Come that that may come: for finally, notwithſtanding that I haue ſpoken, I willingly commit ſelfe into the hands of the gods, ſince of neceſſitie I am therunto conſtrained: For it proceedeth not of a little wiſedome, to receiue that willingly, which to doe wee are conſtrained of neceſſitie.
                     I will not recommend my ſelfe to the Prieſts, nor cauſe the Oracles to be viſited, nor promiſe any thing to the temples, nor offer ſacrifices to the gods, to the end they ſhould warrant me from death, and reſtore mee to life: but I will demaund and require them, that if they haue created The wiſedome of God in diſpoſing his gifts. mee for any good thing, I may not loſe it for my euill life. So wiſe and ſage are the gods in that they ſay, ſo iuſt &amp; true in that they promiſe, that if they giue vs not that which wee others would: it is not for that they will not, but becauſe wee deſerue it not: for wee are ſo euill, and worth ſo little, and we may doe ſo little, that for many good works wee deſerue no merite, and yet with and euill worke wee be made vnworthy of all: Since therefore I haue put my ſelfe into the hands of the gods, let them doe with me what they will for their ſeruice for in the end, the worſt that they will do, is much better then the world wil do: For all that the world hath giuen me, hath beene but mockery and deceite: but that which the gods haue giuen mee, I haue gouerned and poſſeſſed without ſnſpition: For this laſt houre (my ſonne) I haue kept the beſt, the moſt noble, and richeſt iewell that I haue poſſeſſed in my life time, and I doe proteſt vnto the immortall gods, that if as they doe commaund mee to die, they would giue me lieence to reade in the graue, I would command it to be buried with me.
                     Thou ſhalt know my ſonne, that in in the tenth yeare of my Empire, a great warre aroſe againſt the vnrulie people of Perſia, where by euill lucke it was appointed for mee, in perſon to giue the battell: the which wonne, and all their Countrey deſtroyed, I returned by the olde City of Thebes in Egypt, to ſee if I could finde any antiquitie of thoſe in times paſt. In the houſe of an Egyptian Prieſt, I found a little table which they hanged at the gate of the Kinges pallace the day of his Coronation.
                     And this poore Prieſt tolde mee, that that which was in his table, was written by a king of Egypt, named Ptholomeus Araſides. I beſeech the immortall god, my ſonne, that ſuch bee thy works, as the words of this table require. As Emperour, I leaue thee heyre of many Realmes: and as a father I giue thee this Table of Counſels.
                     The words which the Fathers do teach vnto the children at the laſt houre, the children ought to keepe continually in their memory. Let this therefore be my laſt word, with the Empire thou ſhalt be feared through out all the World: and with the counſels of this Table thou ſhalt bee loued of all Nations.
                     This talke being ended, and the table giuen, the Emperour turned his eyes, loſt his ſences, and for the ſpace of a quarter of an houre, lay languiſhing in extreame paine, and within a while after yeelded vp the Ghoſt. In this table were certaine Greeke Letters which weere in meeter, and in our tongue ſignifie thus.

For my obiect and reproof of this their ſlaunderous and malignant ſpeech: I can alleadge (courteous Reader) two principall cauſes, which thou reading, &amp; iudging with indifferency, mayeſt eaſilie aproue, if I ſhould ſeem to gloſe with thee. Firſt the baſeneſſe of my Stile, the plain &amp; humble words couched in the ſame, the meane, rude, and ill contriued ſentences layde before thee, together with the ſimple handling of the whole, plainely ſheweth to thee whence they are, and eaſily acquainteth thee with the curious Tranſlator: Who proteſteth to God, and confeſſeth to the world, that hee more raſhly then wiſely plunged himſelf into ſo graue and deepe a matter, and whoſe young yeeres and vnskilfull head, might both then and now haue excuſed his fond enterpriſes herein.
                  
                  
                     For the ſecond, and laſt, I muſt needs appeale to all the worſhipfull, and my bebeloued companions, and fellow ſtudents of our houſe of Lincolnes Inne at that time, from whence my poore Engliſh Diall tooke his light.
                  
                  
                     To whoſe iuſt and true reports (for thy vndoubted ſatisfaction and diſcharge of my poore honeſty) I refer thee, and wholy yeeld me.
                  
                  
                     Theſe recited cauſes for purgation of my ſuſpected fame, as alſo for eſtabliſhed aſſurance of the like, and thy further doubt of mee hereafter.
                  
                  
                     I thought good, Gentle Reader, to denounce vnto thee. I might well haue ſpared this ſecond and laſt labour of mine, taken, in the rformation and correction of this Diall, enlarging my ſelfe further once againe, with the tranſlation of the late and new come fauoured Courtier, and which I found annexed to the Diall for the 4. and laſt booke, If my proceeding trauell taken in the ſetting forth of the firſt three bookes, and the reſpect of mine honeſty in accompliſhing of the ſame had not incited mee (vnwillingly) to continue my firſt begunne attempt, to bring the ſame to his perfect and deſired end, which whole worke is now compleat by this laſt booke, intituled, the fauored Courtier, which firſt &amp; laſt volume wholly as it lyeth, I proſtrate to the iudgemēt of the graue and wiſe Reader, ſubiecting my ſelf and it, to the reformation and correction of his learned head, whom I beſeech to iudge of mee with fauour and equity, and not with malice to perſecute my fame and honeſt intent, hauing for thy benefite, to my little skill and knowledge imployed my ſimple talent, crauing no other
                     
                     guerdon of thee but thy good report, and courteous acceptance hereof.
                  
                  
                     Which doing thou ſhalt make me double bound to thee. Firſt to be thankefull for thy good will. Secondly, to bee conſiderate how hereafter I take vpon mee ſo great a charge.
                  
                  
                     Thirdly, thou ſhalt encourage mee to encreaſe my talent.
                  
                  
                     Fourthly, and laſtly, moſt freely to beſtow the encreaſe thereof on thee, and for the benefite of my Country and Common-wealth, whereunto duety bindeth mee: Obſeruing the ſage and prudent ſaying of the renowmed Oratour and famour Cicero: with which I end, and there to leaue thee.
                  
                  Non nobis ſolum natiſumus, ortuſque noſtri partem patria vendicat, partem parentes, partem amici.
                  
                     In defence and preſeruation whereof (good Reader) wee ought not alone to imploy our whole wits and able ſences, but neceſſity enforcing vs, to ſacrifice our ſelues alſo for benefite thereof.

                     Athens to Scicile, being the way hee trauelled (indeed) very long, and the ſea he paſſed very dangerous: anſwered them thus. The cauſe that moues mee to goe from Athens to Scicile, is onely to ſee Phocion, a man iuſt in all that he doth, and wiſe in all that hee ſpeaketh: and becauſe he is my very friend, and enemy of Denys, I go alſo willingly to him, to ayde him in that I may, and to counſell him in all that I know: and tolde them further.
                  I let you vnderſtand my Diſciples, that a good Philoſopher, to viſite and helpe his friend, and to accompany with a good man, ſhould thinke the iourney ſhort, and no whit painefull, though he ſhould ſulke the whole ſeas The painefull iourney the Philoſophers booke to vi

                     Iulius Caeſar laſt Dictator and firſt Emperour of Rome, did ſo entirely loue Cornelins Fabatus the Conſull, that trauelling together through the Alpes of France, and beeing benighted, The properties of a true friende. farre from any towne or harbor, ſaue that only of a hollow caue, which happily they lighted on: And Cornelius the Conſull, euen then not well at eaſe, Iulius Caeſar left him the whole caue, to the end he might bee more at reſt, and he himſelfe lay abroad in the cold and ſnow.
                  By theſe godly examples we haue recited, and by diuers others wee could recite, may bee conſidered, what faithfull friendſhippe ought to be betwixt true and perfect friendes, &amp; into how many dangers one friend ought to put himſelfe for another: for it is not enough, that one friend be ſory for the troubles of another, but hee is bound (if neede were) to goe and dye ioyfully with him.
                  He onely, deſeruedly, may bee counted a true friend, that vnasked, and before hee bee called, goeth with his goods and perſon to helpe and relieue his friend. But in this our yron age, alas, there is no ſuch kinde of amity, as that wee haue ſpoken of. More then this, that there is no friend will part with any thing of his to releeue his friend, much leſſe that taketh care to fauour him in his troubles: but if there be any ſuch that will helpe his friend, it is euen then when time ſerueth rather to pitty and lament him, then to ayde or ſuccour him.
                  It is a thing worth the knowledge, that to make a true and perpetuall friendſhippe, we may not offer to many perſons, but according to Seneca, his ſaying, who ſaith: My friend Lucillus, I counſell thee that thou be a true friend to one alone, and enemy to none: for numbers of friends brings great incumbrance, which ſeemeth ſomewhat to diminiſh friendſhip: For who that conſidereth the liberty of the heart, it is vnpoſſible that one ſhould frame and agree with the conditions of many, &amp; much leſſe that many ſhould content them with the deſires and affections of one.
                  
                     Tully and Saluſt were two famous Orators amongſt the Romanes, and great enemies betweene themſelues, and during this emulation betweene them. Tully had purchaſed all the Senators friendſhippe, and Saluſt onely had no other friend in all Rome, but Marke Antony alone,
                  And ſo theſe two great Orators beeing one day at words together: Tully in great anger ſayde to Saluſt: What force or power art thou of, or what euill canſt thou doe or attempte againſt mee? ſith thou knoweſt that in all Rome thou haſt but one onely friend, Marke Antony, and I no enemie but one, and that is he? To whom Saluſt anſwered:
                  
                     Thou glorieſt (O Tully) that thou haſt no moe but one onely enemy, and afterwards ieſts at mee, that I haue no
                     
                     more Friends but onely me: but I hope in the immortall Gods, that this onely Enemie thou haſt, ſhall bee able enough vtterly to vndoe thee: and this my ſole Friend that I haue, ſhall bee ſufficient to protect and defende mee in all my cauſes.
                  
                  And ſhortly after theſe words paſſed betweene tham, Marke Anthonie ſhewed the friendſhip hee bare to the one, and the enmitie hee had to the other. For, he cauſed Tullie to be put to death, and rayſed Saluſt to great honour.
                  A Friend may well imparte to the other, all his owne, as bread, wine, money, time, conuerſation, and ſuch like, but hee cannot notwithſtanding giue him part of his heart: for that ſuffereth it not to be parted nor deuided, becauſe it cā be giuē but to one alone.
                  This graunted to bee true, as needs it muſt, doubtles that the heart cannot bee deuided, but onely giuen to one: then is it of neceſſitie, that hee that will ſeeke to haue many Friends, muſt needs repaire to the ſhambles to prouide him of many hearts.
                  Many vaunt themſelues, and thinke it a glory to haue numbers of friends, but let ſuch well conſider to what vſe that legendarie of Friendes doe ſerue them, they ſhall then eaſily finde they ſtand them in no oeher ſteede, but to eate, to drinke, to walke, to babble, and to murmure togethers, and not one to helpe the other, with their goods, fauour, and credite at their neede, nor friendly to reprooue them of theyr faults and vices, which doubtles ought not to bee ſo.
                  For, where true and perfect friendſhip raigneth, neyther I with my friend, nor hee with mee ſhould diſſemble any vice of faulte.
                  
                     Ouide ſayth in his booke De Arte amandi, that the law of true and vnfained Loue is ſo ſtreight, that no friendſhip but mine in thy heart ſhould harbour: and in mine ſhould lodge none others loue but thine, for loue is none What Loue is. other thing, But one heart, liuining in two bodyes, and two bodyes obeying in one heart.
                  
                  In this World there is no treaſure comparable to a true and ſure Friend, ſith to a faithfull▪ Friende a man may ſafely diſcouer the ſecrets of his heart, bewray vnto him his gryping griefes, truſting him with his honour, committing to his guyde and cuſtodie all his goods, hee ſhall ſuccour him in his miſerie, counſell him in perill, reioyce at his proſperitie, and mourne at his aduerſitie: And in fine I conclude, ſuch a friend neuer wearyeth to ſerue him in his life, nor to lament him after his death.
                  I graunt that Golde and Siluer is good, Kinſefolkes are good, and Money is good: but true friends exceede them all without compariſon.
                  For all theſe things cannot warrant vs from neceſſitie (if ſiniſter Fortune plunge vs into it) but rather encreaſe our torments and extreamitie. Alſo they doe not reioyce vs, but rather heape further griefes vpon vs: neither doe they ſuccour vs, but rather eache houre giue vs cauſe to complaine, and much leſſe do they remember and aduiſe vs of that that is good, but ſtill doe deceyue vs, not directing vs the right way, but ſtill bringing vs out of our way: and when they haue led vs awry out of the High-way, they bring vs into Deſart woods, and high, and dangerous mountaines, whence from we muſt fall downe headlong.
                  A true friend is no partaker of theſe conditions, but rather hee is ſorry for the leaſt trouble that happeneth to his friend, hee feareth not, neither ſpareth his goods, nor the daunger of his perſon, he careth not to take vpon him any painfull iourney, quarrels, or ſutes, nor yet to put his life in euery hazard of death.
                  
                     
And yet that that is moſt of all to bee eſteemed is, that like as the heart and bowels euer burne with pure and ſincere loue, ſo doth hee wiſh and deſire with gladſome mind to beare the burthen of all his friends miſhaps, yea more then yet is ſpoken of.
                  
                     Alexander the Great, offered great preſents to the Philoſopher Zenocrates, who would not vouchſafe to receyue them, much leſſe to beholde them. And beeing demaunded of Alexander, why he would not receyue them, hauing poore kinſfolkes and parents to beſtow them on: hee anſwered him thus.
                  
                     Truely, I haue both brothers and ſiſters (O Alexander) yet I haue no kinſman but him that is my friend, and one onely friend I haue, who hath no need of 
                     A remarkeable ſaying of Zenocrates, 
                     any gifts to bee giuen him. For the onely cauſe why I choſe him to be my ſole and only friend, was for that I euer ſaw him ſpiſe theſe worldly things.
                  
                  Truly the ſentence of this good Philoſopher Zenocrates is of no ſmall efficacy for him that will aduiſedly conſider of it, ſith that not ſeldome, but many times it happeneth, that the great troubles, the ſundry dangers, &amp; the continuall neceſſities and miſeries wee ſuffer in this vale of miſery, haue for the moſt part procceded from our parents, and afterwards by our friends haue beene mediated and redreſſed. Therefore ſince wee haue thought it good and neceſſary to choſe a friend, and that hee bee but one onely, each man muſt bee wiſe, leſt in ſuch choiſe hee be deceyued. For oft times it happeneth, that thoſe that take little regarde herein, grant their friendſhip to ſuch a one as is too couetous impatient, a great babler, ſeditious, and preſumptuous, and of ſuch conditions that ſometimes it ſhould be leſſe euill for vs to haue him our enemie, then to account of him as of our deer friend.
                  Him whom wee will chuſe for our faithfull friend, amongſt other manners and conditions, hee muſt chiefly, and before all bee indued with theſe, Great eate is to bee had in chooſing a friend. that he be courteous of nature, fayre ſpoken, hard and ſtout to indure pain, patient in troubles, ſober in diet, moderate in his words, graue and ripe in his counſels, and aboue all ſtedfaſt in friendſhippe, and faithfull in ſecrets: And whom wee ſhall find with theſe laudable vertues and conditions adorned, him may wee ſafely take and accept for our friend. But if wee ſee any of theſe parts wanting in him, wee ought to ſhun him, as from the plague knowing for certainety, that the friendſhippe of a fayned and fantaſticall friend is much worſe and perillous, then the enmity of a knowne and open enemy: for to the hands of one wee commit our heart and faith, and from the deceites and treaſons of the other wee defend our ſelues with our whole force and power.
                  
                     Seneca writing to his deere and faithfull friend Lucillus ſayeth vnto him. I pray thee (O Lucillus) that thou order and determine thine affayres by the aduice and counſell of thy friend, but alſo I doe remember thee: that firſt thou ſee well what manner of friend thou haſt choſen thee: for there is no marchandiſe in the world this day, that men are ſo ſoone beguiled in, as they are in the choiſe of friends. Therfore the graue ſentence of Seneca wiſely wayed, wee ſhould aſſent with him in opinion, that ſith no man buyeth a Horſe, but hee firſt cauſeth him to bee ridden, nor bread, but firſt hee ſeeth and handleth it, nor wine but hee taſteth it, nor fleſh but firſt he wayeth it, nor corne but hee ſeeth a ſample, nor houſe but hee doth firſt value it, nor Inſtrument but that firſt hee playeth on it, and iudgeth of his ſound: It is but reaſon hee

ſhould be ſo much the more circumſpect before hee chooſe his Friend to examine his life and condition, ſince all the other things wee haue ſpoken of, may bee put in diuers houſes and corners, but our Friend we lodge and keepe deerely in our proper be wells.
                  Thoſe that write of the Emperour Auguſtus ſay, that he was very ſtrange and ſcrupulous in accepting Friends, but after hee had once receyued them into his friendſhip, hee was very conſtant and circumſpect to keepe them. For hee neuer had any friend, but firſt he had ſome proofe and tryall of him, neyther would hee euer after forſake him, for any diſpleaſure done to him. Therefore it ſhold alwayes be ſo, that true friends ſhould beare one to an other ſuch loue and affection, that the one beeing in proſperitie, ſhould not haue occaſion to complaine of himſelfe, in that hee did not relieue his friends neceſſitie, being in aduerſitie: nor the other being poore and needy, ſhould grudge or lament for that his friend being rich and wealthie, would not ſuccour him, with all that hee might haue done for him. For to ſay the trueth, where perfect friendſhip is, there ought no excuſe to be made, to doe what poſſible is, the one for the other.
                  The friendſhip of young men commeth commonly (or for the moſt part at the leaſt) by beeing companions in vice and follie: and ſuch of right ought rather to be called vacabonds, then once to deſerue the name of true friends. For, that cannot bee called true friendſhip, that is continued to the preiudice or derogation of vertue.
                  
                     Seneca writing againe to Lucillus, ſaith theſe words. I would not haue thee thinke, nor once miſtruſt, O my Lucillus, that in all the Romaine Empire I haue any greater Friende then thuo: but with all, aſſure thy ſelfe, that our Friendſhip is not ſo ſtraight between vs, that I would take vpon mee at any time to doe for thee otherwiſe then honeſty ſhould lead mee.
                  For though that loue I beare thee, The ſaying of Seneca, touching frindſhip. hath made thee Lord of my libertie: yet reaſon alſo hath left mee vertue free.
                  
                     The Authour proceedeth on.
                     Applying that wee haue ſpoken, to that wee will now declare, I ſay I will not acknowledge my ſelfe your ſeruant, for ſo ſhould I bee compelled to feare you more then loue you: much leſſe will I vaunt my ſelfe to bee your Kinſ-man: for ſo I ſhould importune and diſpleaſe you: and I will not brag that heretofore wee haue beene of familiar acquaintaunce, for that I would not make any demonſtration, I made ſo little account of you, and leſſe then I am bound to doe: neyther will I boaſte my ſelfe that I am at this preſent your familiar and welbeloued: For indeed I ſhould then ſhew my ſelfe to bee too bolde and arrogant: but that, that I will confeſſe, ſhall be, that I loue you as a Friend, and you mee as a Kinſ-man, albeeit this friendſhip hath ſucceeded diuerſly till now. For you being Noble as you are, haue bountifully ſhewed your friendſhip to mee, in large and ample gifts: but I poore, and of baſe eſtate, haue onely made you ſure of mine in wordes.
                     
                     
                        Plutarch in his politikes ſayd: That it were far better to fell to our friends our workes and good deedes, whether they were (in proſperitie, aduerſitie, or neceſſitie) then to feede them with vaine Flattering wordes for nothing:
                     
                     Yet it is not ſo generall a rule, but that ſometimes it happeneth, that the loftie and high words on the one ſide are ſo profitable, and the workes ſo few and feeble, on the other ſide, that

one ſhal be better pleaſed and delighted, with hearing the ſweete and curteous wordes of the one, then he ſhall be, to be ſerued with the colde ſeruice and workes of the other, of ſmall profite and value.
                     
                        Plutarche alſo in his booke De animalibus telleth vs: that Denis the Tyrant beeing one day at the Table, reaſoning of diuers and ſundrie matters with Chryſippus the Phyloſopher, it chaunced, that as hee was at dinner, one brought him a preſent of certaine Sugar-cakes: wherefore Chryſippus ceaſing his former diſcourſe, fell to perſwade Denis to fall to his cakes. To whome Denis aunſwered, on with your matter Chryſippus, and leaue not off ſo: For my heart is better contented with thy ſweete and ſugred wordes, then my Tongue is pleaſed with the delicate taſte of theſe mountain-cakes. For as thou knoweſt, theſe cakes are heauie of digeſtion, and doe greatly annoy the ſtomack: but good Good workes doe maruellouſly cheare the heart. workes doe meruellouſly reioyce and comfort the heart.
                     For this cauſe Alexander the great had the poet Homer in greater veneration (beeing dead) then all the other that were aliue in his time: not for that Homer euer did him ſeruice, or that hee knew him, but onely becauſe of his learned Bookes hee wrote and compiled: and for the graue ſentences he found therein. And therefore he bare about him in the day time the booke of the famous deedes of Troy, (called the Illyades) hanged at his neck within his boſome: and in the night hee layde it vnder his bolſter, at his beds-head where hee ſlept.
                     In recompence therefore (Syr) of the many good turnes I haue receyued at your hands, I was alſo willing to compyle and dedicate this my little Treatiſe to you, the which I preſent you with all my deſires, my ſtudyes, my watches, my ſweatte, and my troubles, holding my ſelfe fully ſatisfyed for all the paines I haue taken, ſo that this my ſimple trauell be gratefull vnto you (to whom I offer it) and to the publike weale profitable. Being well aſſured, if it pleaſe you to truſt me and credite my wryting, you ſhall manifeſtly know how freely I ſpake to you, and like a friend, and not deceyue you as a flatterer.
                     For, if the beloued and Fauourites of Princes, chaunce to bee caſt out of fauour, it is becauſe euery man flattereth him, and ſeeketh to pleaſe him, and no man goeth about to tell him trueth: nor that, that is for his honour, and fitteſt for him.
                     
                        Saluſt in his booke of the warres of Iugurtha ſayth: that the high heroycall facts and deedes were of no leſſe glorie to the Hyſtoriographers that wrote them, then they were to the captaine that did them.
                     For it happeneth many times, that the Captaine dying in the battell hee hath wonne, liueth afterwardes notwithſtanding, by the Fame of his noble attempt: And this proceedeth not only of the valiant deeds of Arms he was ſeene doe, but alſo for that wee read of him in worthy Authors which haue written thereof.
                     Wee may well ſay therefore (touching this matter) that as well may wee take him for a true friend, that giueth good counſell, as hee which doeth vs great pleaſure and ſeruice. For according to the opinion of the good Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who who ſaide to his Secretarie Panutius, that a man with one pay, may make full ſatisfaction and recompence of many pleaſures and good turns ſhewed: but to requite a good counſell, diuers thankes, and infinite ſeruices are requiſite.
                     If we will credite the ancient Hyſtoriographers, wee ſhall finde it true, that the moſt Nobleſt and vertuous

Emperours, the fortunate Kings, and the valiant Captaines, when they ſhould enterpriſe to go conquer their enemies, eyther they ſought for ſome Philoſopher, or they choſe ſome other honeſt learned man, of whome they tooke counſell touching all their affayres, before they preſt any Souldiers.
                     Comparing the times paſt, with The times paſt better then the times preſent. the times preſent, wee thinke (that haue read ſomewhat) that the time paſt was as pure graine, and this now as chaffe and ſtraw: that one as the time calme, and ſtill in the ſea, and this as wauering and tempeſtuous: that then the fine and pure mertal, and this now the droſſe thereof. The other, the marie, and this the bones: the one the cleare day, and the other the darke night. For in theſe dayes, in Princes Courts, and noble mens houſes, they glory more to haue a ſcoffing knaue or ieſter to make them laugh, then they reckon of a graue and wiſe man to giue them counſell.
                     
                        Alexander the Great in all his wars would alwayes be accompanied with the wiſe Ariſtotle.
                     
                     
                        Cyrus King of Perſia, with the Philoſopher Chilo: King Ptholomie, with Pithinns the Philoſopher: Pyrrhus King of Epyre, with Zatirus, Auguſtus the Emperour with Simonides: Scipio the African with Sophocles, Traian the Emperour with Plutarch, and Antoninus the Emperour with Gorgias: Now all theſe famous Princes carried not with them ſo many learned Philoſophers, to fight in battell with armed weapon in hand like other their Souldiers, but onely to vſe their counſell and aduiſe: ſo that the great battels they ouerthrew, and the worthy victories they wan, with the noble triumphes done, was as much by the graue counſell of theſe good and wiſe Philoſophers, as by the force of their army, and prowes of their captaines.
                     The greateſt good turne and benefit one friend can doe for another, is to know to giue good counſell to his friend in his greateſt neede: and not without cauſe, I ſay, to giue counſell: For it happeneth oft times, that thoſe that thought to haue giuen vs good remedy by their counſell, (wanting indeed diſcretion &amp; iudgement in the ſame) haue cauſed vs to runne into further dangers.
                     And therefore Seneca beeing once demaunded of the Emperour Nero, what he thought of Scipio the Affrican, and Cato the Cenſor, aunſwered him in this manner.
                     I thinke it was as neceſſary that Cato was borne for the Commonwealth, as Scipio for the warres, for the good Cato with his prudent counſell expelled vice out of the Wealepublike: and the other with his noble courage and great armies did euer withſtand the force of the enemies:
                     According to the ſaying of Seneca, let vs alſo ſay after him, that hee is very arrogant that preſumes to giue an other counſell; but withall, wee ſay againe, that if the counſell be found good, hee hath giuen to his friend in his need and neceſſity, as much praiſe deſerueth he that gaue it, as he that knew how to take it.
                     Now after the example of the ancient Philoſophers, which went to the warres, not to fight, but onely to giue counſell, I will (ſir) for thoſe things that pertaine to your ſeruice, and profite, take vpon mee the office of a Philoſopher; and for the firſt doctrine of my Philoſophie, I ſay, that if it pleaſe you, to receiue theſe counſels which my penne doth write vnto you, at this preſent. I promiſe you, &amp; by the faith of a Chriſtian man, I ſweare, that they ſhall bee ſuch excellent helpes to you, for the preſeruation

of your credite and fauour you are now in, as you may bee enriched by the true and diligent ſeruice of your ſeruants For if a man woulde with an oath aske the truth of Plato, Socrates, Pythagoras, Diogenes, Lycurgus, Chilo, Pittachus, and of Apolonius: and alſo of all the vniuerſity and company of the other Philoſophers, they would ſweare and affirme, that the felicitie of man conſiſteth not in great might, in great authority, and poſſeſſions: but onely in deſeruing much: For the honor, fauour, and dignities of this mortall life, are more to be prayſed, and had in veneration, when they are placed in a condigne &amp; worthy perſon, then they are being poſſeſſed of an vnworthy and graceleſſe man, allotted to him, not by vertue, but by fortune: And therefore your authority being great at this preſent, exalted thereto by Gods diuine will and prouidence, and now in the higheſt degree of proſperity: I would wiſh you, my good Lord, leſſe then any other Courtier, to truſt to fortunes impery: For if the earthquakes ſooner bring to ground the proud and ſtately pallaces, then the meane and lowe houſes: if ofter fall the higheſt mountaines, the dreadfull lightnings, and tempeſts, then on the loweſt hilles: if among the greater multitude of people the plagues be rifer, then amongſt the fewer number: if they vſe rather to ſpread their nets, and lay the birdlime on the greene and thickeſt bows then on the drye and withered ſticks: to ſnare the ſeely birds withall: If alwayes the ſtilleſt ſeas doe foreſhew to vs a greater tempeſt following, and if that long health bee a watch vnto a great and dangerous ſickneſſe enſuing: by this alſo I will infer, that thoſe that are atchieued to ſublime eſtate, and high degree, are commonly more ſubiect to fall, then thoſe of meaner &amp; baſer ſot.
                     The Emperour Auguſtus on a time demaunded of the Poet Virgill, that hee would teach him how hee might conſerue himſelfe in the Empire, and alwayes bee acceptable to the publike A queſtion demaunded by the Emperour Auguſtus of Virgil, and his anſwere. weale.
                     To whom Virgil aunſwered. I I thinke, O mighty Caeſar, that to raigne long in the Empire, thou muſt conſiderately looke into thy ſeife, examining thy life and doings: and how much thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelfe excell, and exceede all thoſe (of thy Empire) in dignity: So much more muſt thou endeauour thy ſelfe to ſurmount all others in vertue and worthineſſe: for hee is vnworthy to rule a multitude, that is not chiefe himſelfe in all vertues.
                     Thoſe therefore that in Court of Princes beare office and authoritie, ought earneſtly to deſire and endeauour themſelues to auoyde the filthy ſinke of vice, and to ſeeke the cleare Spring of vertue: For otherwiſe, they ſhall bee more defamed for one vice or defect found in them, then honoured for their office and authority they haue.
                  
                  
                     The Author concludeth.
                     According to the ſaying of the Poet Virgill to the Emperour Auguſtus, I am alſo of opinion (my Lord) that you ought to bee very circumſpect, and well aduiſed, in looking into your ſelfe who you are, what power you are of, what you are worth, and what you poſſeſſe: and doing thus, you ſhall find that among your wiſe Counſellours you are the greateſt, among the rich, among the beſt eſteemed, among the moſt fortunate, among your Secretaries, among the Rulers, amongſt all thoſe of your Realme and Subiects, you are euer

the greateſt. And therefore as you are greateſt, and ſupreme aboue them all: ſo you ought the more to force to bee the moſt vertuous of them all: For els it were againſt al reaſon, being the greateſt, to be the leaſt, and moſt inferior of all: For truly none ought to be prayſed for good, for that he is of power, force, poſſeſſions, wealth, much worth, in fauour of dignitie, neyther for any nobilitie that is in him, if theſe naturall gifts bee not accompanied with vertue and good works.
                     The ancient Hiſtoriographers do highly commend the greatneſſe of Alexander, the knowledge of Ptholomie, the iuſtice of Numa Pompilius, the clemency of Iulius Caeſar, the patience of Auguſtus, the truth of Traian, the pitty of Anteninus, the temperancie of Conſtantius, the continency of Scipio, and the humanity of Theodoſius: ſo that we may ſay theſe ſo great and noble Princes haue wonne more honour by their vertues, then they haue atchieued by triumphant victories: albeit a man bee neuer ſo diſhoneſt, vicious Sinne is not ſo pleaſaot in the committing, as it is likeſome in the remembrāce and laſciuious, and that he bee rooted in all idlenes; let vs ſay and auouch it for a truth, that it is impoſſible (if he may returne to looke backe on himſelfe, and that hee may call to mind what manner of man hee hath beene, what he is at this preſent, and to what end he may com) but that the remembrance of his forepaſſed faults and deedes ſhould be more grieuous and irkeſome to him, then the greate delight his body ſhould take of the preſent pleaſures: for neyther the wormes in the vines, nor the Locuſts in the corne, nor the moths in the garments, nor the little wormes in the wood are ſo hurtfull and dammageable, as ſinnes are of power to make a man ſorrowfull. For to ſay truly, the pleaſure wee receiue when we commit them is not ſo great, as is the diſpleaſure wee feee after wee remember them. The which I conſidering my Lord, it cauſeth me to looke ouer my olde memorials, to examine my memorie, to ſtrengthen my iudgement, and to ſeeke a new kinde of ſtudy, to no other end, but to finde out ſweete words, diuers doctrines, and ſtrange hiſtories, by meanes whereof I might withdraw you from vaine and worldly delights, to cauſe you to walke in the right path, and to affect thinges vertuous and honeſt, though I haue alwayes knowne them as acceptable to you, as they haue beene familiar: for Princes ſeruants, the more they are buſied with affayres, the leſſe they know themſelues.
                     And therefore great paine ſuffereth hee, and with ouer venemous poiſon is he infected, that with others and for other occupieth all his time, &amp; for his own ſoules health cannot ſpare a moment of time. O what comforte and quiet were it vnto my heart, if it were aſſured it had taken the right way in the doctrine which I write to you, and that I had not erred in the counſels I giue you: ſo that in reading my booke you might acquire profite thereby, and I of my trauell therein reape my full contentation. And to the end, my Lord, wee may better expreſſe the matter, ſearch the wound, and ſtop the veines, that wee may leaue no part vncured, or dregges of infection.
                     If hitherto I haue vſed plainneſſe, I will now ſpeake more plainely vnto you, and yet as one friend vſeth to another. And therefore may it pleaſe you to accept theſe ſmall written prepoſes in this booke, among all the reſidue, proceeding from the handes of one that rather deſireth the health of your ſoule, then the gaine and ſatiſfaction of your affects and deſires.
                  
                  
                     
                     All you that bee Princes familiars, and beloued Courtiers, obſerue and retain with you theſe few precepts and counſels.
                     
                        MY Lord, neuer tell to any, al that you thinke. Shew not all that you haue, neyther take all that you deſire: Tell not al that you know Good counſell for all men, eſpecially for Courtiets. Much leſſe neuer doe all that you may: For the right path way to bring the fauoured Courtier into his Princes diſgrace, is to be addicted to his ſenſuall appetites, and vaine humors and not to bee guided with reaſon &amp; diſcretion.
                     2 Beware alſo you truſt not, nor commit to the hazard of fortunes ticklenes, ſuch things, as touch and concerne your perſon, honour, goods and conſciences: For the wiſe Courtier that liueth in his Princes grace, will not raſhly put himſelfe in daunger, in hope to ſaue himſelfe harmeleſſe, at all times when he liſteth.
                     3 Although euery man offer his ſeruice to you, and ſeeme to bee at your commaundement when you ſhall neede him: yet I tell you (ſir) I would not wiſh you had eyther neede of them, or of me: For many of thoſe fine and curious Courtiers, which are the firſt that offer themſelues to draw on your ſide, and to ſtand by, if neede bee, are commonly at the very pinch, the firſt and readieſt to throw ſtones at our faces.
                     4 In other mens matters buſie not your ſelfe too much: and in your owne, ſtriue not with time, but take leyſure: For liuing after this rule, you ſhall long keepe your ſelfe in the good and quiet eſtate you are in, and otherwiſe ſome inconuenience might lightly fall vpon you, that ſhould make you remember what you were wont to be.
                     5 The imminent perill and daunger thoſe are in, which are mounted to the toppe of ſome high thing, or to the cliffe of ſome high and rockie mountaine, where they haue no other way to deſcend, but to fall, is much like to that of the familiars of Princes. And therefore, my Lord, I woulde wiſh you would procure you, ſuch faithfull friends about you, that they hauing regard and care of your perſon, ſhould alwayes holde you by the gowne for falling. And not ſuch as after they had let you fall, would then lend you their hands to helpe you vp againe.
                     6 Albeit the things of the ſoule ſhould bee preferted before all others of this worldly life, yet neuertheleſſe I will bee content, ſo that you haue as great care &amp; conſideration of your conſcience, as you haue of your honour
                     All which I was willing to tell you ſir, to the end you may better vnderſtand, that thoſe that are in eſtimation with the Prince, though they may benefite by time, in taking their time, yet time doth neuer benefite by them at all.
                     You muſt euer doe good to your vttermoſt power, and neuer doe diſpleaſure to any, though it lye in your power, and that you haue iuſt cauſe.
                     For the teares of the poore that are iniuried, and the lamentable cries and plaintes of the oppreſſed, may poſſibly one daye aſcend to the preſence of the Tribunall Seate, where God ſhall ſit in his Maieſty, demaunding iuſtice and vengeance againſt you: and

alſo come to the cares of the Noble Prince, to cauſe you to bee hated of him for euer.
                     8 Touching the fauor you will ſhew to anie, eyther in Offices, or other benefites Chriſtians are in all things to be prefered before all others. you will beſtowe on any man, take heed you alwayes rather preferre honeſt and true Chriſtians, then your owne neere Kinſ-men or friendes. For a man may lawfully make his Friende partaker of his goods, but not of his Conſcience.
                     9 In your counſells you geue, in any wiſe bee not too much affectioned in them, neyther ſcorne with thoſe that contrary your opinion. Be not proud and ſeuere vnto thoſe you doe commaund, neyther doe any thing without good aduiſement and conſideration. For, albeit in Princes Courts euery man doth admire and beholde the excellencie and worthines of the perſon, yet are thoſe alwayes that are moſt in fauour of the Prince, more noted, regarded, and ſooner accuſed then others.
                     10 If you will not erre in the counſelles you ſhall giue, nor fayle in thoſe things you ſhall enterpriſe: Embrace thoſe that tell you the truth, and reiect and hate thoſe, whom you know to be Flatterers and diſſemblers. For you ſhould rather deſire to bee admoniſhed of the thing preſent, then to be counſelled after the dammage receyued.
                     Although wee ſuppoſe aſſuredly, that all theſe things aboue-written, are not likely to happen, nor yet come euen ſo to paſſe, as I haue ſpoken: yet if it may pleaſe you (Syr) to remember, they are not therefore impoſſible.
                     For ſpitefull Fortune permitteth oftentimes, that the Sayles, which in ſtormie weather the Lightnings and boyſtrous Tempeſts could not breake and teare in piec
                           ••
                        , are afterwardes vpon a ſudden (euen in the ſweete of the mornings ſleepe, each man taking his reſt, leauing the Seas before in quiet calme) all to ſhiuered, and torne a ſunder. He that meaneth to giue another a blowe alſo, the more he draweth backe his arme, with greater force hee ſtriketh. And euen ſo (neyther more nor leſſe) ſayeth Fortune with thoſe on whom for a time ſhee ſmyleth. For, the longer a man remayneth in her loue and fauor, the more cruell and bitter ſhe ſheweth herſelfe to him in the ende.
                     And therefore I would aduiſe euery wiſe and Sage perſon, that when Fortune ſeemeth beſt of all to fauour him, and to doe moſt for him, that then hee ſhould ſtand moſt in feare of her, and leaſt of all to truſt her deceits.
                     Therefore (Syr) nake no ſmall account of this my Booke, little though it bee. For you know, that doubtleſſe (as experience teacheth vs) of greater price and value is a little ſparke of a Dyamond, then a greater ballaſt.
                     It forceth little that the Booke bee of ſmall or great volume, ſith the excellencie thereof conſiſteth not in the number of leaues more or leſſe, but only in the good and graue ſentences that are amply written therein.
                     For, euery Authour that writeth, What the Author or wryter of books ſhould ayme at. to make his booke of great price and ſhew, ought to be briefe in his words, and ſweete and pleaſaunt in his matter hee treateth of, the better to ſatisfie the minde of the Reader, and alſo not to growe tedious to the hearer.
                     And (Syr) I ſpeake not without cauſe, that you ſhould not a little eſteeme this ſmal treatiſe of mine, ſince you are moſt aſſured, that with time all your things ſhall haue ende, your Friendes ſhall leaue you, your goods ſhall bee diuided, your ſelfe ſhall dye, your fauour and credit ſhall diminiſh. and thoſe that ſucceede you, ſhall forget you, you not knowing to whome

your Goods and Patrimonie ſhall come: and aboue all, you ſhall not knowe what conditions your heyres and children ſhall be of. But for this I wryte in your royall Hiſtoric and Chronicle of your laudable vertues and perfections, and for that alſo I ſerue you as I doe, with this my preſent worke, the memorie of you ſhall remaine eternized to your Succeſſors for euer.
                     
                        Chilo the Phyloſopher beeing demanded whether there were anything in the world that Fortune had not power to bring to nought, aunſwered in this ſort. Two things only there are, which neither Time can conſume, nor Fortune deſtroy: And that is the renowne of man written in bookes, and the veritie that is hidden.
                     For though truth for a time lye interred, yet it reſurgeth againe, and receiueth life, appearing manifeſtly to all. And euen ſo in like caſe the vertues we find written of a man, doe cauſe vs at this preſent to haue him in as great veneration, as thoſe had in his time, that beſt knewe him.
                     Reade therefore (Syr) at times I beſeech you, theſe writings of mine, albeit I feare me you can ſcant borrow a moment of Time with leyſure once to looke vpon it, beeing (as I knowe you are) alwayes occupyed in affayres of great importance, wherin me thinketh you ſhould not ſo ſurcharge your ſelfe, but that you might for your commodity and recreation of your ſpirits, reſerue ſome priuate houres to your ſelfe. For ſage and wiſe men ſhould ſo burden themſelues with care of others toyle, that they ſhold not ſpend one houre of the day at the leaſt (at their pleaſure) to looke on their eſtate and condition.
                     As recounteth Suetonius Tranquillus of Iulius Caeſar, who notwithſtanding his quotidian warres he had; neuer let ſlip one day, but that he reade or wrote ſome thing.
                     So that being in his Pauillion in the Campe, in the one hand hee held his lance to aſſault his enemie; and in the other the penne he wrote withall, with which he wrote his worthy Cō
                        mentaries. The reſonable man therfore calling to mind the ſtraight account A wiſe man reſerueth ſome time for his profite and recreation. that he muſt render of himſelfe, and of the time he hath loſt, ſhall alwayes be more carefull that hee loſe not his time, then he ſhall be to keepe his treaſure: For the well imployed time is a meane and helpe to his ſal ſaluation: and the euill gotten good a cauſe of his eternall damnation.
                     Moreouer yet, what toyle and trauell is it to the body of the man, and how much more perill to the liuing ſoule, when hee conſumeth his whole dayes and life in worldly broyles, and yet ſeely man hee cannot abſent himſelfe from that vile drudgery, til death doth ſummon him to yeelde vp his account of his life and doings.
                     And now to conclude my Prologue I ſay this booke is diuided into two parts, that is to ſay, in the firſt tenne Chapters is declared how the newcome Courtier ſhall behaue himſelfe in the Princes Court, to winne fauour and credit with the Prince, and the ſurplus of the work treateth, when hee hath atchieued to his Princes fauour, and acquired the credite of a worthy Courtier: how he ſhall then continue the ſame to his further aduancement.
                     And I doubt not, but that the Lords and Gentlemen of Court, will take pleaſure to reade it, and namely, ſuch as are Princes familiars, and beloued of Court, ſhall moſt of all reape profite thereby, putting the good leſſons and aduertiſements they finde heretofore written in execution. For to the young Courtiers it ſheweth them what they haue to do: and putteth in remembrance alſo the

olde fauoured Courtyer, (liuing in his princes grace) of that he hath to be circumſpect of. And finally, I conclude (Syr) that of all the Treaſures, riches, gifts, fauours, proſperities, pleaſures, ſeruices, greatneſſe, and power, that you haue and poſſeſſe in this mortall and tranſitorie life: and by the Faith of a true Chriſtian I ſweare vnto you alſo, that you ſhal carrie no more with you, then that onely Time, which you haue well and vertuouſly employed, during this your Pilgrimage.
                  
               
               
                  THE ARGVMENT OF THE BOOKE: ENTITVLED, THE FAuoured Courtyer: wherein the Authour ſheweth the intent of his worke; exhorting all men to ſtudie good and vertuous Books, vtterly reiecting all Fables, &amp; vaine trifling ſtoryes, of ſmall doctrine &amp; erudition.

                        Ʋlus Gellius, in his Booke De noctibus Atticis ſaith: That after the death of the great Poet Homer, 7-famous cities of Grece were in great controuerſie, one with the other: each one of them affirming that by reaſon the bones of the ſaide Poet was theirs, and only appertained Le

And this they did: (Suppoſing that they neuer had ſo great honor in any thing, but that this was far greater to haue educated ſo Excellent and rare a Man as hee was. Euripides alſo the phyloſopher born and broght vp in Athens: trauelling in the realm of Macedonia, was ſuddēly ſtrucken with death, which woful newes no ſoner came to the Athenians eares (declared for a truth) but with all expedition they diſpatched an honorable Embaſie: only to intreat the Lacedemoniās to be contented to deliuer them the bones of the ſaid phyloſopher: proteſting to them that if they wold frankly grant them, they would regratifie that pleaſure done them: and if they would denie them, they ſhould aſſure themſelues they would come and fetch them with the ſword in hand.
                  
                  K: Demetrius helde Rhodes beſieged long time (which at length he won, by force of arms) &amp; the Rhodiās being ſo ſtubborn that they wold not yeeld by compoſition, nor truſt to his princely clemencie, hee cōmanded to ſtrike off al the Rhodians heads, &amp; to raſe the city to the hard foundations. But when he was let vnderſtand, that there was euen then in the Cittie Prothogenes, a Phyloſopher and Paynter, and doubting leaſt in executing others, hee alſo vnknowne, might bee put to the ſword, reuoked his cruell ſentence &amp; gaue ſtraight commandement forthwith they ſhould ceaſe to ſpoile and deface the towne further, and alſo to ſtay the ſlaughter of the reſt of the Rhodians. The diuine Plato beeing in Athens, aduertiſed that in the city of Damaſco, in the realme of Paleſtine, were certaine bookes of great antiquity, which a Philoſopher borne of that Country left behind him there: when he vnderſtood it to be true, went thither immediately, led with the great deſire he had to ſee them, &amp; purpoſely

(if they did like him) afterwards to buy them. And when hee ſaw that neyther at his ſuit, nor at the requeſts of others he could obtaine them, but that he muſt buy thē at a great price.
                  
                     Plato went and ſolde all his patrimony to recouer them: and his owne not being ſufficient, hee was faine to borrow vpon intereſt of the commō Treaſury to helpe him: ſo that notwithſtanding he was ſo profound and rare a Philoſopher (as indeed he was) yet he would ſell all that ſmall ſubſtāce hee had onely to ſee (as hee thought ſome prety new thing more of Philoſophy As Ptolomeus Philadelphus king of Egypt, not contened to bee ſo wiſe in al ſciences as he was, nor to haue in, his Library 8000. bookes as hee had nor to ſtudy at the leaſt 4. houres in the day, nor ordinarily to diſpute at his meales with Philoſophers, ſent neuertheleſſe an Ambaſſage of Noble men to the Hebrewes, to deſire them they would be contented to ſend him ſome of the beſt learned and wiſeſt men amongſt them, to teach him the Hebrew tongue, and to reade to him the books of their Laws.
                  When Alexander the Great was borne, his father King Philip wrote a notable letter immediately to Ariſtotle, among other matters hee wrote, there were theſe, I let thee to vnderſtand. The letter of K. Phili, to Ariſtol at the birth of his ſonne Alexander.
                  
                  
                     O greateſt Philoſopher Ariſtotle (if thou knoweſt it not) that Olimpius my wife is brought to bedde of a ſonne, for which inceſſantly I giue the Gods immortall thankes, not ſo much that I haue a ſonne, as for that they haue giuen him mee in thy time. For I am aſaſſured hee ſhall profite more with the doctrine thou ſhalt teach him, then he ſhall preuayle with the Kingdomes I ſhall leaue him after me.
                  
                  Now by the examples aboue recited, and by many more wee could alledge, wee may eaſily conſider with what reuerence and honour the auncient Kings vſed the learned and vertuous men in their time. And wee may alſo more plainely ſee it, ſith then they helde in greater price and eſtimation the bones of a dead Philoſopher, then they doe now the doctrine of the beſt learned of our time. And not without iuſt occaſion did theſe famous and heroycall Princes ioy to haue at home in their houſes, and abroad with them in the field, ſuch wiſe and learned men, whileſt they liued, and after they were dead to honour, their bones and carcaſes, and in doing this, they erred not a a iot: For whoſoeuer accompanieth continuallly with graue and wiſe men, enioyeth this benefit and priuiledge before others, that he ſhall neuer bee counted ignorant of any: therfore continuing ſtil our firſt purpoſe, let vs ſay, that whoſoeuer will profeſſe the company The benefite that accreweth by companying, with wiſe men. of ſober &amp; wiſe men, it cannot otherwiſe be, but he muſt maruellouſly profit by their cōpany: for being in their company, they wil put al vain and diſhoneſt thoughts from him, they will teach him to ſubdue &amp; reſiſt al ſudden paſſions &amp; motions moued of choler: by thē they ſhal win good friends, and learn alſo neuer to be troubleſom, or enemy to any, they will make him forſake all ſinne &amp; vice, declaring to him what good works he ſhall follow, and what hee ſhall moſt flye and eſchew: they will let him vnderſtand how hee ſhall humble and behaue himſelfe, in proſperity, and they will alſo comfort him in his aduerſity, to keep him from all ſorrow and deſpaire. For though a man be neuer ſo carefull and circumſpect, yet hath he hath always need of the councell of another in his affaires: if therefore ſuch a perſon haue not about him good, vertuous, &amp; ſage men, how can it otherwiſe bee, but that he muſt ſtūble oft, and fall down right on his face, hauing no man to aid or help him.
                  
                     
                     Paulus Dyaconus ſayth, that albeit the Affricanes were wilde and brutiſh people, yet had they notwithſtanding a law amongſt them, that the ſenators amongſt them, could chuſe no other Senator, if at the Election there were not preſent a philoſopher.
                  So it hapned on a day amongſt the reſt, that of manie phyloſophers they had in Carthage, amongſt them there was one named Apolonius, who ruled for the ſpace of 62. yeares, all their Senat with great quyet, and to the contentation of all the Senators, which to ſhew themſelues thankfull to him, erected in the market place ſo many images of him, as hee had gouerned their Common-weale yeares, to the ende the fame and memorie of him ſhould bee immortall: and yet they did dedicate to their famous Hannibal, but one only image, and to this Phyloſopher they ſet vp aboue 60. Alexander the great, whē he was moſt bēt to bloudy wars, went to ſee &amp; ſpeake with Diogines the Phyloſopher, offring him great preſents &amp; diſcourſing with him of diuers matters. So that wee may iuſtly ſay, This good Prince of himſelfe tooke paines to ſeeke out wiſe men to accompanie him, electing by others choyce and aduiſe all ſuch, as hee made his Captaines to ſerue him in the warres.
                  It is manifeſt to all, that Dyoniſius the Syracuſan was the greateſt Tyrant in the worlde: and yet notwithſtanding his Tiranny, it is a wonder to ſee what ſage and wiſe men he had continually in his Courte with him: And that, which makes vs yet more to wonder of him is, that hee had them not about him to ſerue him, or to profite one jote by their doctrines and counſell: but onely for his honour, and their profite, which enforceth mee to ſay, concurring with this example, that ſith Tyrants did glorie to haue about them Sages, wiſe, and worthie men: Much more ſhould thoſe reioice, that their works &amp; deeds are noble, &amp; freeharted. And this they ought to do, not onely to bee honoured with them openly, but alſo to be holpen with their doctrine and counſells ſecretly.
                  And if to ſome this ſhould ſeeme a hard thing to follow, we will ſay, that worthy men not being of abilitie and power to maintayne ſuch Wiſe-men, ought yet at leaſt to vſe to reade, at times, good and vertuous books. For by reading (of vertuous Bookes) they may reape infinite profite. As for example: By reading (as I ſay) theſe Good Authours, the deſire is ſatisfied, their iudgement is quickned, ydleneſſe is put away, the heart is disburdened, the Time is well employed, and they lead their liues vertuouſly, not being bound to render account of ſo manie faults, as in that time they might haue committed. And to conclude, it is ſo good an exerciſe, as it giueth good example to the Neighbour, profite to himſelfe, and health to the ſoule.
                  We ſee by experience, after a man taketh vppon him once the Studie of holie Scriptures, and that hee frameth himſelfe to bee a Diuine, hee will neuer willingly thenceforth deale in any other ſtudyes: and all becauſe he will not forgoe (the great comfort and pleaſure he receyueth) to reade thoſe holy ſayings. And that cauſeth, that we ſee ſo manie learned &amp; wiſe men (for the more part) ſubiect to diuers diſeaſes: and full of Melancholike humours. For, ſo ſweete is the delight they take in theyr Bookes, that they forget and leaue all other bodily pleaſure.
                  And therefore Plutarche writeth, that certaine phyloſophers being one day met at the lodging of Plato, to ſee him: &amp; demanding what exerciſe he had at that time? Plato anſwered thē, thus. Truely my brethren, I let you know, that euen now my onely exerciſe was, to ſee what the great Poete Homer ſaid. And this he tolde them, becauſe that they took him euen then

reading of ſome of Homers bookes, and to ſay truely, his aunſwere was ſuch, as they ſhould all looke for of him. For to reade a good booke, in effect is nothing elſe, but to heare a wiſe man ſpeake,
                  And if this our iudgement and aduiſe ſeeme good vnto you, we would yet ſay more, that you ſhould profite more to reade one of theſe bookes, then you ſhould to heare ſpeake, or to haue conference with the Author him ſelfe that made it: For it is without doubt, that all Writers haue more care and reſpect in that their penne doth write, then they haue in that their tongue doth vtter. And to the end you ſhould not thinke we cannot proue that true that we haue ſpoken, I giue you to vnderſtand, that euerie Author that will write, to publiſh his doing in print, to lay it to the ſhew, and iudgement of the world, and that deſireth thereby to acquire honour, &amp; fame, and to eternize the memory of him, turneth many bookes, conferreth with other wiſe and lerned men, addicteth himſelfe wholy to his book, endeauoureth to vnderſtand well, oft refuſeth ſleepe, meat and drinke, quicneth his ſpirites, doing that he putteth in writing exactly with long aduiſe, and conſideration, which he doth not when hee doth but onely ſpeake and vtter them, though oft in deede (by reaſon of his great knowledge) in ſpeech vnawares there falleth out of his mouth, many godly and wiſe ſentences. And therefore God hath giuen him a goodly gift that can reade and him much more that hath a deſire to ſtudy, knowing how to chuſe the good bookes from the euill. For to ſay the truth, there is not in this world any ſtate or exerciſe more honourable and profitable then the ſtudy of good books. And we are much bound to thoſe that read, more to thoſe that ſtudy, and much more to thoſe that write any thing, but moſt doubtleſſe to thoſe that make &amp; compile goodly books, and thoſe of great and high doctrine: for there are many vaine and fond bookes, that rather deſerue to be throwne into the fire, then once to be read or looked on: for they do not only ſhew vs the way to mocke them, but alſo the ready meane to offend vs, to ſee them occupie their braines and beſt wittes, they haue to write fooliſh and vaine things, of no good ſubiect or erudition. And that which is worſt of all yet, they are occaſion, that diuers others ſpend as much time in reading their ieſts and mockeries, as they would otherwiſe haue imploied in doctrine, of great profit and edifying, the which to excuſe and defend their error, ſay they did not write them for men to take profite thereby, but only to delight and pleaſe the Readers, to paſſe the time away merily, whom we may rightly anſwer thus: That the reading of ill and vaine bookes, cannot bee called a paſtime, but aptly a very loſſe of time. And therefore Aulus Gelius in the fifteenth of his booke writeth, that after the Romanes vnderſtood the Orators and Poets of Rome, did giue themſelues to write vain, voluptuous, and diſhoneſt bookes, cauſing Enterludes and Poeticall Comedies to be played, they did not only baniſh them from Rome, but alſo out all the parts of Italy: for it beſeemed not the Romane grauity, neyther was it decent for the Weale publike, to ſuffer ſuch naughty bookes among them, and much leſſe for to beare with vicious and laſciuious gouernours. And if the Romane Panims left vs this for example, how much more ought wee that are Chriſtians to continue and follow it, ſince that they had no other Bookes for to reade ſaue onely Hiſtories, and we now a dayes haue both Hiſtories, and holy Scriptures

to read, which were graūted vs by the church, to the end that by the one we might take ſome honeſt pleaſure and recreation, and with the other procure the health of ourſoules.
                  Oh how farre is the Commonwealth nowe-adayes digreſſed from that wee wryte and counſell, ſince we ſee plainely, that men occupie themſelues, at this preſent, in reading a nū
                     ber of Books, the which only to name I am aſhamed. And therfore ſaid Aulus Gelius in his 14. book, That there was a certain philoſopher wrote a book of hie and eloquent ſtile, but the ſubiect very harde and diffuſe to vnderſtand: which Socrates, &amp; other philoſophers hearing of, cōmanded immediatly the Booke to be burned, and the Author to be baniſhed: by which exāple we may well perceiue, that in that ſo perfit and reformed Vniuerſitie, they would not onely ſuffer any Laſciuious or vicious booke, but alſo they would not beare with thoſe, that were too hawtie and vainglorious in their ſtiles, and whoſe matter was not profitable, and beneficiall to the Publike-weale. That man therfore that walloweth in idlenes lap, that vouchſafes not to ſpēd one houre of the day to read a graue ſentence of ſome good Booke, wee may rather deſeruedly cal him a brutiſh beaſt, then a reaſonable creature. For euery wiſe man ought to glory more of the knowledge he hath, then of the aboundance of goods he poſſeſſeth. And it cannot be denyed, but that thoſe which reade vertuous Bookes, are euer had in better fauor, and eſtimation then others. For they learne to ſpeake, they paſſe their time without trouble, they know many pleaſant things, which they after tel to others: they haue audacitie to reproue others, &amp; euery man delighteth to heare them, &amp; in what place or companie ſoeuer they come, they are alwaies reuerenced &amp; honored aboue others: euery man deſireth their knowledge and acquaintance, and are glad to aske them counſell. And that, that is yet of greater credit to them is, that they are not few in number, that truſteth them with their bodie &amp; goods.
                  And moreouer (I ſay) that the wiſe and learned man which profeſſeth ſtudie, ſhall know very well how to counſel his friend, and to comfort himſelfe at all times, when neede doeth ſerue, which the fooliſh ignorant perſon can not doe: For he cannot only tell how to comfort the afflicted in aduerſitie, but alſo hee cannot helpe himſelfe in his own proper affaires, nor take coū
                     ſell of himſelfe, what is beſt to doe.
                  But returning againe to our purpoſe (we ſay) becauſe we would not be reproued of that we rebuke others of, wee haue beene very circumſpect and aduiſed: and taking great care, and paines in our ſtudy, that all our books and workes, wee haue publiſhed, and compyled, ſhould be ſo exactly done, that the Readers might not find any ill doctrine, nor alſo any thing worthy reproofe. For the vnhoneſt bookes, made by laſciuious perſōs do giue (deſeruedly) euident token to the Readers to ſuſpect the Authours: and troubleth the iudgements of thoſe, that giue attentiue care vnto them.
                  And therefore I counſell and admoniſh him that will enterpriſe, and take vppon him to bee a wryter, and a ſetter forth of Bookes, that hee bee wiſe in his matter hee ſheweth, and compendious in the wordes hee writeth: and not to bee like to diuers Wryters, whoſe workes are of ſuch a phraſe and ſtyle, as we ſhall reade many times to the middeſt of the booke, ere wee finde one good and notable ſentence, ſo that a man may ſay, that al the fruit thoſe reape for their paine, watches, and trauell, is none other but onely a meere toye and mockery, they being derided of euery man that ſeeth their workes.
                  
                     
That Authour that vndertaketh to write, and afterwardes proſtrateth to common iudgement the thing hee wryteth, may bee aſſured that hee ſetteth his wittes to great trauell and ſtudie, and hazardeth his honour to preſent perill. For the iudgement of men being variable, and diuers (as they are indeede) manie times they doe meddle and enter into iudgement of thoſe things, whereof they are not only not capable to vnderſtand, but alſo leſſe skilfull to reade them.
                  Now in that booke wee haue ſet out, of The Dyall of Princes: and in that other wee haue tranſlated of the Life of the Romaine Emperours, and in this wee haue now ſet forth Of the fauoured Courtiers, the Readers may bee aſſured, they ſhall find in them goodly and graue ſentences, whereby thy may greatly profit, and they ſhall not read any wordes ſuperfluous, to comber or weary them at all. For, we did not once licence our pen to dare to write any word, that was not firſt weyed in true ballāce, &amp; meaſured by iuſt meaſure. And GOD can teſtifie with vs, that without doubt wee haue had more paine to be briefe in the wordes of our books we haue hitherto made, then we haue had to gather out the inuention, and graue ſentences thereof.
                  For to ſpeake good words, and to haue good matter and wiſe purpoſes, is the property of one that naturally is modeſt, and graue in his actions: but to write briefely, he muſt haue a deepe vnderſtanding.
                  When at the Fonte of the Printers Forme, we firſt baptized the Booke of Marcus Aurelius, wee intituled it The Dyall of Princes: and this therefore that we haue now made and added to it, we call it (more for briefnes) The fauoured Courtyer: which portendeth the whet-ſtone and inſtruction of a Courtyer. For if they will vouchſafe to reade, and take the fruitfull counſelles they finde written heerein, they may aſſure themſelues, they ſhall awaken out of the vanityes, they haue long ſlept in: and ſhall alſo open their eies, to ſee the better, that thing wherin they liue ſo long deceyued. And albeit indeed this preſent work ſheweth to you but a fewe contriued lines, yet GOD himſelfe doeth knowe, the paines we haue taken herein hath bin exceeding great, and this for two cauſes: the one for that the matter is very ſtraunge and diuerſe from others; the other, to thinke that aſſuredly, it ſhould be hated of thoſe that want the taſte of good diſcipline. And therefore wee haue taken great care, it ſhould come out of our hands well reformed and corrected: to the ende that Courtyers might finde out many Sentences in it, profitable for them, and not one word to trouble them.
                  Thoſe Noble-men, or Gentlemen, that will from henceforth haue their children brought vp in the Courtes of Princes, ſhall finde in this Booke, all things they ſhall neede to prouide them of: And thoſe alſo which haue beene long Courtyers, ſhall finde all that they ought to doe in Court.
                  And ſuch alſo as are beſt fauoured of Noble Princes, and carrie greateſt reputation of honour with them, ſhall find likewiſe excellent good counſels, by meane whereof, they may alwayes maintain and continue themſelues, in the chiefeſt greatneſſe of their credite and fauour: ſo that it may well be called a Mithridaticall Electuary: recuring and healing all malignant opilations.
                  Of all the Bookes I haue hitherto compiled, I haue Dedicated ſome of them vnto the Imperiall Maieſtie, and others, to thoſe of beſt fauor and credite with him: where the Readers may ſee, that I rather glorie to bee a Satyr then a Flatterer, for that in all my

ſentences they cannot finde one cloked word, to enlarge and embetter my credite and eſtate. But to the contrary, they may reade an infinite number of others, where I doe exhort them to gouern their perſon diſcreetly and honorably, and to amend their liues thenceforth.
                  When I Imprinted the Diall of Princes, together with Marcus Aurelius, and brought them to light. I wanted not backbiters and detractors that beganne forthwith to teare me in pieces; neyther ſhall I want at this preſent (as I beleeue) ſuch as will not ſpare with venemous tongues, to poyſon my worke: But like as then I little wayed their ſlaunderous ſpeeches of me, euen ſo much leſſe do I now force what they can ſay againſt mee, being aſſured they ſhall finde in the end, they haue ill ſpoken of mee, and my poore workes, proceeding from them rather of a certaine enuie, that gnaweth their heart, then of any default they finde in my doctrine, comforting my ſelfe yet in the aſſurance I haue, that all their ſpight ſhall one day haue an end, and my workes ſhall euer be found good and perdurable
                  The end of the Argument.
               
            
            
               
                  
                  
                  THE FOVRTH BOOKE OF THE DYALL OF PRINCES, COMPILED BY THE LORD ANTHONY Gueuara, Biſhop of Mondogueto:
                  
                  
                     CHAP. I. That it is more neceſſary for the Courtier, (abiding in Court) to be of liuely ſpirite and audacity, then it is for the Souldier, that goeth to ſerue in the warres.
                     
                     
                        
                           PLutarch, Plinie, and Titus Liutus declare that King Agiges one day requeſted the Oracle of Apollo to tell him, who was the happieſt man in the world: to whom anſwere was made, that it was a man they called Aglaon, beknowne of the Gods, and vnknowne of men.
                     This King Agiges making then ſearch for this man through all Greece, who was called Aglaon, found at length that it was a poor Gardner, dwelling in Archadia, who being of the age of threeſcore and two yeares, neuer went aboue a mile from his houſe, keeping himſelfe and his family continually with his onely labour and tillage of his Garden. Now albeit there were in the world of better parentage and linage then he, better accompanied of ſeruants, and tenants, better prouided of goods and riches, higher in dignity, and of greater authority then he: yet for all this, was this Aglaon the happieſt of the world. And this was, for that he neuer haunted princes Courts, neyther by enuy to bee They are oft times moſt known that leaſt ſeeke acquaintāce ouerthrowne, nor yet by auarice to be ouercome. For many times it chanceth to men, that when they would leaſt giue themſelues to acquaintance, then come they moſt to bee knowne: and when they make leaſt account of themſelues, then cometh there an occaſion to make thē to be moſt reputed of: For they winne more honor, that deſpiſe theſe goods, honours, and riches of this world, then thoſe do, that continually gape, and ſeeke after the ſame. And therefore we ſhould more enuy Aglaon, with his little garden,

then Alexander the Great with his mighty Aſia: For true contentation conſiſteth not in hauing aboundance, but in being contented with that little hee hath.
                     It is a mockery, and worthily hee deſerueth to be laughed at, that thinketh contentation lyeth in hauing much, or in being of great authoritie: for ſuch wayes are readier to make vs ſtumble, yea and many times to fall down right, then ſafely to aſſure vs to go on our way.
                     The puniſhment that God gaue to Cain for murdering of his brother Abel was, that his body continually trembled, and he euer after wandred thorough the world: ſo that he neuer found, where he might enhabite, nor houſe where he might harbour. And albeit this malediction of Cain was the firſt that euer God ordained, I durſt affirme notwithſtanding, that it remayneth as yet vntill this preſent day amongſt Courtiers, ſith wee ſee them dayly trauell, and runne into ſtrange Countries, dayly changing and ſeeking new lodgings.
                     Which maketh me once again to ſay, that Aglaon was counted happy, and for that onely hee neuer romed No miſery comparable to that of the Courtier farre from his houſe: For to ſay truly, there is no miſery comparable to that of the Courtier, that is bound dayly to lye in others houſes, hauing none of his owne to goe to. And he onely may bee called happy, that putteth not himſelfe in danger to ſerue others.
                     
                        Iulius Caeſar beeing counſelled to wayre vpon the Conſull Sylla, to the end that by ſeruing, or being about him, hee might doe himſelfe greate good, and it might bee very profitable to him, anſwered thus: I ſweare by the immortall Gods, I will neuer ſerue any, in hope to be more worth, &amp; greater then I am: For this I am ſure of, that where Liberty is exiled, there might nor power can preuaile.
                     
                     He that forſaketh his owne Countrey where he liued at eaſe, &amp; in health and the place where hee was knowne and beloued, the neighbours of whom hee was viſited, the friends of whome hee was ſerued, the parents of whome hee was honoured, the goods wherewith he maintained himſelfe, his wife, and children (of whom he had a thouſand pleaſures and conſolations) and that commeth to ſerue and dye in the Court. I cannot ſay otherwiſe of him, but that he is a very foole, or that hee commeth to doe penance for ſome notable crime hee hath committed: And therefore not without great cauſe was this name of Courte, (which in our tong ſignifieth ſhort) Why this name Court was adhibited to the Pallace of Princes. adhibited to the pallace of Princes, where indeed all things are ſhort, only enuy and malice excepted, which continue long.
                     He onely deſireth to be a Courtier, that as yet hath not taſted the ſweetneſſe and pleaſure of his owne houſe, nor hath yet proued and ſeene the troubles and pains of the Court: For hee that knoweth them, figheth when he is called to the Court; and weepeth when he is kept long there. I haue ſtudyed in times paſt in the Vniuerſities, preached in the Courts, praying in Religion: and now I dwel vpon my Biſhopricke, teaching and inſtructing my Dioceſians: but I dare ſay, of all theſe foure ſtates recited, there is none ſo ſtreight and painfull, as is to follow the Court.
                     If I ſtudyed at the Vniuerſity, I did it of free will to bee wiſer: but onely in the Court I ſpent my time, to be more worth then I was. But the greateſt time I conſumed in Religion, was to ſay my prayers, and to bewayle my grieuous ſinnes.
                     In the Court I onely gaue my ſelfe to ſuſpect my neighbour, and inuented to build great Caſtels of wind

(with thought) in the ayre. And therefore I returne once again to ſay, that it is a greater trouble and vexation for to become a Courtier, then to bee a religious perſon: For It is more difficult to bee a Courtier then a religious perſon. in religion it ſufficeth to obey one but in the Court hee muſt ſerue all. And in religion alſo they are apparrelled with leſſe coſt and charges, and to the greater contentation of the perſon, then they are in the Court. For a poore Gentleman Courtier is bound to haue more change and ſutes of apparrell, then the falcon feathers. The religious perſons goe alwayes to dinner, and finde their meate on the Table, ready prepared for them, without any thought taken of their part, what they ſhall haue: but fine Courtiers many times riſe out of their bed, without euer a penny in their purſe.
                     And albeit religious perſons all their life take great paines in riſing at midnight to ſerue God: yet haue they great hope after their death, of the heauenly reſt and comfort: but poore Courtiers, alas what ſhould I ſay, hard is their life, and more perillous their death, into greater danger truly putteth he himſelfe, that becommeth a Courtier, then did Naſica, when gee was with the Serpent, then King Dauid with the Philiſtines, then the Southſayers with Euah, then Hercules with Antheon, then Theſeus with the Minocaure, then King Menelaus with the wilde Bore, then Corebus with the Monſter of the mariſh, and then Perſeus with the monſtrous whale of the ſea: For euery one of theſe valiant mē were not afraid but of one: but the miſerable Courtier ſtandeth in feare of all: For what is he in Court, that ſeeing his neere Kinſman or deereſt friend, more in fauour or credit then himſelfe, or richer then he, that wiſheth not his friendes death, or at the leaſt procureth by all meanes he can, he ſhall not equall, nor goe euen with with him in credite or reputation: One of the worſt things I conſider, &amp; ſee in Courtiers is, that they looſe much time, and profite little: For the Many a Courtier ſpends his time all. thing wherein they ſpend their dayes, and heſtow the nights, for the moſt part is, to ſpeake ill of thoſe that are their betters, or excel them in vertues: and to vndoe thoſe that are their equals and companions: to flatter the beloued, and among the inferiour ſort to murmur one againſt an other: and alwayes to ſigh and lament for the times paſt.
                     And there is nothing that prouoketh Courtiers more to complaine, then the dayly deſire they haue to ſee ſundry and new alterations of time: For they little weigh the ruine of the Common weale, ſo they may enlarge and exalt their owne eſtates. Alſo, it is a thing of courſe in Court, that the reiected and fauourleſſe Courtiers, meete together, murmuring at their Princes, and backbiting their councellers and officers, ſaying, they vndoe the Realme, and bring all to nought. And al this preſuppoſed, for that they are not in the like fauour and eſtimation that they be in, which beareth office and rule in the Common-weale: And therefore when it commeth in queſtion, for a Courtier to aduaunce himſelfe, and to come in credit in the Court, one Gourtier can ſcarſly euer truſt an other.
                     On the other ſide, mee thinketh that the life of the Court is not the very life in deede, but rather an open penance. And therefore in my opinion, wee ſhould not reckon Courtiers aliue, but rather dead, buried in their life.
                     For then the Courtier euer findeth himſelfe plunged with deaths extream paſſious, when hee perceyueth an other The life of a
                              •
                            Courtier, an open penance. to be preferred and called before him, Alas, what great pitty is it to ſee a hapleſſe and vnfortunate Courtier;

for hee ſeely ſoule awaketh a thouſand times in the night, toſſeth from ſide to ſide of his bed, ſometime vpright hee lyeth, lamenting his yron happe, now he ſigheth for his natiue ſoyle, and ſorroweth then for his loſt honour: ſo that in maner he ſpendeth the whole night in watch and cares, imagining with himſelfe all the wayes hee can, to come in credite and fauour againe, that he may attaine to wealth and preferment before others; which maketh mee thinke, that it is not a paine, but a cruell torment: no ſeruice but tribute: and not once only, but euer: that the body of the poore miſerable Courtier abideth, &amp; that (in deſpite of him) his wretched heart doth beare.
                     By the Law of the Court, euery Courtier is bound to ſerue the King, to accompany the beloued of the Court, to viſite noble men, to wayte vpon thoſe that are at the Princes elbow, to giue to the vſhers, to preſent the Auditors, to entertaine the Wardens and captaines of the Ports, to currey fauour with the Harbingers, to flatter the Treaſurer, to trauell and ſpeake for their friendes, and to diſſemble amongſt their enemies.
                     What legges are able to doe all theſe things? what force ſufficient to abide theſe brunts? what heart able to endure them? and moreouer, what purſe great inough to ſupply all theſe deuiſes? I am of opinion, there was neuer any ſo fooliſh, nor marchant ſo couetons, that hath ſolde himſelfe in any fayre, or exchangde himſelfe for any other Marchandize, but only the vnhappy Courtier, who goeth to the court to ſell his liberty, for a litle winde, and vaine ſmoake of the court.
                     I graunt that a courtier may haue in the court plenty of golde and ſiluer, ſumptuous apparrell, fauour creſite, and authoritie: yet withall this aboundance yee cannot deny me, but he is as poore of liberty, as rich of ſubſtance or credite. And therefore I dare boldly ſay this word againe, for one time the Courtier hath his deſire in Court, a thouſand times they will enforce him to accompliſh others deſires, which neyther pleaſe nor like The Courtier is abridged of his liberty. him. Surely it commeth of a baſe and vile minde, and no leſſe cowardly, for any man lightly to eſteeme his liberty, and fondly to embrace bondage and ſubiection, being at others commaundement.
                     And if the Courtier would aunſwere mee to this, that though hee ſerue, yet at leaſt hee is in his Princes fauour. I would replye thus, Though hee bee in fauour with the Prince yet is he notwithſtanding ſlaue to all his other officers, For if the Courtier will ſell his horſe, his moyle, his cloke, his ſworde, or any other ſuch like whatſoeuer, hee ſhall haue ready money for all, ſauing for his liberty, which hee liberally beſtoweth on all for nothing. So that hee ſeemeth to make more eſtimation of his ſword or appaarrell hee ſelleth, then he doth of his liberty which hee giueth: For a man is not bound to trauell at all, to make himſelfe maſter of others, more then pleaſeth him: but to recouer liberty, or to maintaine it, he is bound to dye a thouſand deaths.
                     I ſpeake not theſe things for that I haue read them in my bookes, but becauſe I haue ſeene them all with mine eyes, and not by ſcience, but by experiennce: and I neuer knew Courtier yet content in Court, much leſſe enioying any iot of his liberty, which I ſo much eſteeme, that if al men were ſufficient to know it, and knew well how to vſe it, he would neuer for any Treaſure on earth forgoe it, neyther for any gage lendi
                           •
                        , were it neuer ſo precious.
                     Yet is there in Court beſides this an other kind of trouble, I haue

not yet touched, and that is not ſmall. For oft times thither commeth of our friends which be ſtraungers, whom of neceſſitie, and for honeſties ſake: the Courtier muſt Lodge with him at home, the Court beeing already full peſtered. And this happeneth oft in ſuch a time, when the poore Courtyer hath neither Lodging of his owne, to lodge them in: nor happily ſix pence in his purſe, to welcome themwithall.
                     I would you would tell mee alſo, what griefe and ſorrowe the poore Courtyer feeleth at his heart, when hee lodgeth in a blinde, narrowe-lane: eateth at a borrowed table, ſleepeth in a hyred bedde, and perhaps his Chamber hauing no doore to it: yea, and for the more part, his apparell and armor, euen to the very Sworde in gage. Then when any Friends of his commeth out of the countrey to lye with him, (hee being ſo poore, and alſo a ſtranger in an other mans houſe) how is it poſſible he ſhould accept into his companie any others, and perhaps as needie as hee?
                     Sometimes he were better, and had rather beare his friends coſt, and charges (being altogether vnable) yea, and to finde him all his neceſſaries (what ſhift ſo euer he made) then he ſhould ſuffer his Friend or ſtraunger to come home to his houſe, to knowe and ſee the miſerie he liueth in. For more is the honeſt heart and good nature aſhamed and grieued, to diſcouer his miſery, then it is to ſuffer and abide it. Commonly the Courtyer being alone, An honeſt hart is more greeued to ſhew his miſery then to ſuffer it. is content with a litle couch, one mattreſſe or quilt, one flock-bed, with one pillowe, and one paire of ſheets, with one couerlet, with one frying-pan, one grid-yron, one ſpit, one kettle, one baſine, with one candle-ſticke, and with one pot: which he cannot doe, if any ſtranger or friend of his come to him: For then hee muſt for his reputationſake hang his Chamber, dreſſe vp his bed, and furniſh it better, and muſt alſo prouide for a thouſand other ſuch trifles he ſtandeth in need of. And if it fall out his Hoſt and goodman of the houſe will not lend him theſe things or that perhaps he hath them not (as it chaunceth oft) he ſhalbe compelled to borrow vppon a pawne, or to hyre of others: wheras if he were alone with his owne people, hee would right well be contented with his ſmall ordinarie.
                     And when a ſtranger commeth to ſee him, he muſt be at greater coſt and charge: ſo that he ſhall ſpend more at one dinner or ſupper, then hee had done before in three dayes. And therefore doubtles the Courtyers are at more charges with their Friendes, that come to ſee them, then they are with themſelues. For the honourable and worthie Courtyers had rather faſt an other time, then to ſhewe himſelfe at this pinch needie &amp; harde, and after to bee mocked of his acquaintance.
                     Oh now many men are there in the world that waſte and ſpend in one day all that they haue trauelled to get together in many? Not for that they eſteem not their goods, and deſire not to keepe them: but onely for a little vain glory, to get them the name of a free-harted and liberall man: dealing honeſtly among his friends.
                     Alſo as great is the trouble to the poore Courtyer, when the Courte remoueth The Courtyer ſubiect to much trouble. oft from place to place. For, thē he muſt truſſ-vp his baggage, lode the moyles, &amp; hyre carts to carry it, afterwards pray the cofferer to pay him: the Harbingers to prepare him a lodging, &amp; then he muſt firſt ſend one of his men to ſee if the lodging be meere for him. Furthermore, Courtyers haue occaſion oft times to bee angrie with the carters, and Muletters, for loding too much, or too little: &amp; for cōming too late to the lodging, &amp; many times alſo, they muſt Ryde at noone-dayes,

&amp; in the greateſt heat, and ſomtimes in raine, dew, tempeſt, or in other il weather (whatſoeuer it be) for that the Carters and Carriers will not looſe their iourney.
                     And admit that all this may eaſily be carried, is it therefore reaſonable or meete, the poore Courtier ſhould ſpend at one voyage, or remouing of What epences the Courtier is at. the Court, all the profite and ſpare hee hath made in ſix moneths before? And what ſhall wee ſay alſo, of the ſtuffe and moueables that the poore Courtier of neceſſity muſt buy in euery place where the Court remayneth, as chaires, tables, formes ſtools, water pots, platters, diſhes, and other ſmall traſh. that would coſt more the carriage, then the buying of them anew. And to conclude, all things pertayning to Court are painefull, vnpleaſant, and chargeable for the poore Courtier: For if he ſhould carrie alwayes with him, all ſuch things as bee neceſſary, and that he ſhould need: in carriage they are broken or marde, or being left behind, they are in hazard to be ſtollen or loſt: for he that will bee a continuall Courtier, muſt be of a bolde and ſtout courage: For hee ſhall be forced hourely to leaue of his owne deſires, to pleaſe and content others, changing and ſhifting to diuers places, and ſtrange lodgings, and oft times of ſeruants and new family, dayly encreaſing his charge and expence.
                     And truely, if that which is gotten and gained in Court be worth much: much more doth that exceede that is ſpent in Court, and theſe expences are rather lauiſh, then moderate: diſordered, then well ſpent: for in effect Courtiers ſpend more with ſtrangers they receyue into their lodgings, then they doe with their ordinary ſeruants they keepe. Albeit that, that Courtiers loſe and leaue behind them at euery remouing of the Court, bee but of ſmall account or importance, yet it is notwithſtanding both griefe and diſpleaſure to them: for indeede there is no houſe ſo richly furniſhed, and repleniſhed with moueables, but that the Lord or Maſter of the houſe, will chafe to ſee a diſh or glaſſe broken, or ſpoyled.
                     Yet there is an other diſcommodity in remouing of the court, for ſom Courtiers there are that be ſo poore, that for want they can hardly follow the Court, and others alſo that are rich, are compelled to beare many of their charges, with whom they are in company with by the way: and ſome of thoſe are ſo rude and ill brought vp, that they had rather beare their charge all their iourney, then once againe to haue them in their company. But a Godsname, what ſhall wee ſay yet of the wretched Courtier, whoſe Coffers and horſe are arreſted at his departing for his debts? Truely I lye not: for once I ſaw a Courtiers moile ſolde for her prouender ſhee had eaten and that money not ſufficient to pay the hoſt: the Courtier remaining yet debter of an ouerplus; the poore man was ſtripped euen of his cappe &amp; gloues for the ſatisfaction of the reſt.
                     Alſo there is an other ſort of needy Courtiers, ſo troubleſom and importune, that they neuer ceaſe to trouble their friends, to borrow money of their acquaintance, ſome to finde themſelues, ſome to apparrell themſelues, others to pay their debts, others to play, and others to giue preſents: ſo that at the remouing day, when they haue nothing wherwith to pay nor content their Creditors, then they are ſued in Lawe, and arreſted in their lodging, and the The miſery that Courtiers are ſubiect vnto Creditors many times are not ſatiſfied with their goods, but doe take execution alſo of their bodies, laying them in faſt priſon, till they bee

payde and ſatisfied, of their whole debte.
                     Oh what follie may bee thought in thoſe, that cannot moderate their expences, according to their abilitie? For to ſay vprightly, hee ſhould cut his Garments according to his cloth, and meaſure his expences with his reuenues: and not following his affection and deſire. For, the Gentleman How Courtyers ought to order their expences. or Courtier in the ende hath not the meane nor commodiitie to ſpende as the Countrey-man hath, that liueth at home at elſe in the countrey, &amp; ſpendeth ſuch commodities as hee brings into his houſe, but the courtier conſumeth in court not his owne alone, but alſo that of others.
                     And therefore in Courte or elſewhere, let euery wiſe man bee diligent to bring his affayres to ende: but yet let him ſo moderate and vſe his Expences, as hee ſhall not neede, nor be driuen to morgage, and gage that hee hath. For hee that feaſteth and rowteth with others purſe, of that that is lent him, cannot chooſe but in the ende he muſt breake, and deceyue his creditours.
                     Therfore all worthiemen, that loue their honour, and feare reproache, ought rather to ſuffer, hunger, colde, thyrſt, care, paine, and ſorrow, then to be had in the checke-roule of ryotous and prodigall ſpenders, truſtleſſe of theyr promiſes, and ſuſpected of their wordes.
                     There is yet another great trouble, in the court of Princes, and that is the exceeding dearth of victualls, the vnreaſonable want of houſes, and the great price of horſes: for many times they ſpend more for ſtrawe, and litter for their horſe, then they doe in other places for hay, oats, and bread.
                     And further, if the Courtyer bee a poore gentleman, and that he would feaſt and banquet his friends or companions, he ſhall ſpend at one dinner or ſupper ſo much that he ſhalbe conſtrained to faſte a whole weeke after. Therefore if the Courtyer will be well vſed in following of the Courte, hee muſt not onely knowe, and ſpeake to, alſo loue, and inuite at times, the Butchers, Vittlers, Fruitrers, Keepers, and Foſters, Fiſhmongers, and Poultrers, and other purueyers of the ſame:: Of whom hee ſhall alwayes haue aſmuch neede of his prouiſion, as he ſhal haue neede of the iudges to ſhewe him Iuſtice when hee ſhall neede it. For meate, bread, wine, wood, haye, oats, and ſtrawe, are commonly very deare it Court; for fewe of all theſe things are to bee bought in Court, but of others infinit things to be ſolde, to profite and gayne the poore Courtyers, that elſe had no ſhift to liue.
                     And yet is there a little more trouble in Court, and that is: that continually letters are ſent to the Courtier The trouble courtyers haue with Friends, from his Friendes, to obtaine of the Prince or his Counſell, his diſpatch in his priuate affaires, or for his ſeruants or tenants, or other his friends.
                     And many times theſe ſutes are ſo ill welcome to the courtyer, that hee had rather haue pleaſured his friend with a piece of mony, then they ſhould haue layde vpon him ſo weightie a matter.
                     And beſides this, there is yet another trouble: that the bringer of this letter muſt needes lye at the Courtyers houſe attending his diſpatch: So that the Courtyer delaying his friends buſines, augmenteth his griefe, and keeping the meſſenger there, increaſeth his charge. And if perchance his buſines be not diſpatched, and the ſuite obtained, thoſe that wrote to him will not thinke hee left it off, for that hee would not do it or take paines therin: but for that he wanted fauour and credite, or at leaſt were very negligent in following their cauſe. And that that vexeth them throghly yet is, that their parents and friends thinke (which are

in the countrey farre from Court, that this Courtyer hath all the Courtyers at his commaundement, that he may ſay and doe what he will there.
                     And therefore his Friendes, when they haue occaſion to employ him in Court, and that they write vnto him, touching their affayres: and that hee hath now taken vpon him the charge and burden of the ſame, ſeeing himſelfe after vnable to diſcharge that hee hath enterpriſed, and cannot as hee The griefe of th
                              •
                            courtyer, that cā
                           not pleaſure his friend. would ſatisfie his friends expectation: then hee falleth to diſpaire, and wyſheth hee had beene dead when hee firſt tooke vpon him this matter, and that hee made them beleeue he could goe through with that they had committed to him, beeing vnpoſſible for him hauing ſmall credite and eſtimation' amongſt the Nobilitie and Councellours.
                     Therefore I would neuer councell him that hath Brethren, Friendes, or other neere Kinsfolkes in Court, to goe ſeeke them out there, albeit they had matters of great weight and importance: on hope to be diſpatched the ſooner, by their credit, fauour, and ſuite. And for this cauſe, for that in Court there is euer more priuate malice and enuie, then in other places: wherefore they cannot bee reuenged, the one of the other, but muſt tarry a time: and when they ſee opportunitie, they ſet in foote to ouerthrowe, and ſecretly to put backe theyr aduerſaries ſuite.
                     Now loe, theſe things, and other infinite plagues doe light vpon theſe vnfortunate courtiers, incredible happely to anie, but the olde and experienced Courtyer.
                     If the old and wiſe Courtier would count all the fauours and miſchances: the dearth and abundance: the frendſhips and enmities: the contentation and diſpleaſures: and the honor &amp; infamy hee hath endured in the Court: I belieeue aſſuredly we ſhould not be a little ſorrie for that bodie that had ſuffered ſo much: but much more for that heart that had abidden all thoſe ſtormes and broyles.
                     When the Courtyer ſeeth that hee is not heard of the Prince, nor ſpoken to of the beloued and fauoured of the The miſhaps of the Court are more then the fauors. Court: and that the Treaſurer doeth not diſpatch him, and the Cofferer keepe backe his wages: it is a miſerie to ſee him, and on the other ſide, a pleaſure and paſtime to heare what he ſayes: curſing the wretched life of this world. And euen then, in his heate and rage, he teareth and blaſphemeth GOD: and ſweares accurſedly, that thenceforth hee will forſake the vaine abuſes of Courte, and leaue alſo the Trompries of the deceitfull world, avowing to encloſe himſelf within precinct of Religious walles, and to take vpon him alſo religious habite.
                     Alas, if I fetched as many ſighes for my ſinnes, as Courtyers doe for their miſhaps and diſgraces: what a number would they come to? For a Courtyer, incontinent that hee feeleh himſelfe ſicke, that hee is alone, and reiected of his Friendes in Court, hee becommeth ſo heauie and penſiue, that with his deepe ſighes, he pierceth the heauens on hye: and with his flowing teares he moyſtneth the Earth below. So that a man might more eaſily number the troubles of the ſtout and hardy Hercules then thoſe which the Courtyer daily ſuffreth. And beſides thoſe manie wee haue recyted, yet further, theſe alſo we can recite: that their ſeruaunts robbe them: their Purſe-bearers conſume their money: ieaſters &amp; counterfait knaues lye euer vpon their reward: women picke their purſes, and ſtrumpets &amp; bawds ſpoile them of all. But what ſhal I ſay more to you? If the poore Courtyer be full of feathers, euery man plumes him: but if he want Winges, there is no man haſtie to

plume him. And to conclude, in Princes Courts you ſhall finde no ſuch trade of life, whereby you may ſatisfie euery man: For if the Courtier ſpeake little, they will ſay he is but a foole, and if hee bee too large of tongue, they will ſay he is a glorious foole, if he bee free in expences, they will ſay hee is a prodigal foole, if he be ſcarce of his purſe, they will ſay he is a couetous miſer, if hee be alone, and ſolitary at home, they wil account him an hypocrite: and if hee viſite others oft, they will ſay hee is a bold and troubleſome man, if he haue any train of men following on him, they will ſay, he is a proud man, and if hee goe without company, that hee is poore and miſerable. So that of Court, this may rightly be ſayde: That it is a very Theater, where one mocketh &amp; grinneth at another, and yet in the end they (all in a manner) finde themſelues ſcorned and deceyued.
                     Now diſcourſing alſo of ſleepe, doth the Courtier alwayes ſleepe as much as he will? no ſurely, but as The Courtier wanteth many things hee would haue. much as hee may.
                     And touching his meate, hath hee alwayes that hee liketh? no truely, but he is forced to be contented with that he hath. And as for his apparrell, is hee clothed according to his will? no, no, but according to others fanſies.
                     O vnhappy Courtier, that he ſpendeth the moſt part of his miſerable life, in combing his head, waſhing his beard, wearing fayre and braue houſe: varniſhing his ſword and dagger, blacking his bootes, prouiding him of cloakes, buying him cappes, furring him gownes, and fitting himſelf with other ſmall and needfull trifles: waſting in them all his owne goods, and that of his friendes.
                     I am not of that mind and opinion that others are, that ſay there are none in ſo great liberty as Courtiers bee, which ſhould not bee ſayde, and much leſſe credited, ſith wee ſee by dayly proofe, if they be in ſeruice, they are as ſlaues.
                     If they bee not in ſeruice with the King, or other noble men, they liue in poor eſtate. Now let every man ſay what hee will, where pouerty raigneth there liberty can haue no place. And there is nothing in the world deerer, then that wee buy with intreaty, and not with money. And therefore we muſt confeſſe, that Princes Courts are meeter to exerciſe the youth, then for the aged to liue there without reſt: For young men haue more hardines, to away with the paines and troubles of the Court, then they haue yeares, to ſeeke the griefes and diſpleaſures, they receyue thereby.
                     Now goe to the Court that liſt, procure office and authority that will: for hitherto, I neuer met or ſpake with man that was contented with the Court: For if he bee crept in fauour, he feareth euery houre to fall, and loſe his credit: if euer hee bee once out of fauour, and in diſgrace, he deſpaireth, hee ſhall neuer returne againe into fauour; and if he that goeth to the ſea, committeth himſelfe firſt to God before hee take ſhip; much more ought hee to doe it, that goeth to dwell in Court: For in the Sea, of a hundred ſhips, there doe not periſh ten: but Few purchaſe fauor in the court of a thouſand Courtiers, there commeth not three in fauour.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. II. Of Courtiers braules and quarrels, with the Harbingers for ill lodging.
                     
                     
                        After Lucullus the Romane his returne from Aſia, in an Oration A ſpeech of Lucullus, and may well bee applyed to euery Courtier. hee made before the Senate, hee ſayde thus: I ſweare vnto you by the immortall Gods (Fathers conſcript) that in all this my iourney I felt no paine, nor trouble, neyther for the conduct and gouernement of mine army, nor for the rebellion of the people, nor for the abſence of my friends, nor for the warre of the enemies, neyther for the long time, nor yet for the perill of my life: For all theſe things are incident to Souldiers and men of warre, and common to rulers in peace. But if you bee deſirous to know what was my trouble, and that which grieued mee moſt, it was on the remembrance of the quiet reſt I had at home: For as you know right well (Sacred Senate) during the time as a man lodgeth in other mens houſes, hee is neuer at liberty.
                     And this word of Lucullus me thinketh euery Courtier might well apply to himſelfe, for that hee is alwayes bound to doe ſeruice to the Maſter of the houſe where hee lodgeth, yea although hee receyue a thouſand iniuries of him: yet therefore it is not lawfull for him to anger or diſpleaſe him in any thing: Therefore in very ill and vnlucky howre is the Courtier arriued, when he muſt take his iorney in ſtead of reſt, trauell for quietnes, miſery for aboundance, bondage for liberty, and paine for pleaſure. And albeit Courtiers abide many paines and troubles, yet this mee thinketh is the greateſt, and leaſt tollerable, when they muſt be lodged: reaſoning of the paines, diſpleaſures, fortunes &amp; miſhaps that men ſuffer. Little is that my penne doth write herein, &amp; much leſſe that my tongue doth ſpeake in compariſon of that the wofull heart doth abide. O how many things are there, that are felt euen at the very bottome of the heart, and yet dare not the tongue once vtter them? Truly, how poor a houſe ſoeuer the courtier hath in the Country, hee ſhoulde more eſteeme it, then the beſt lodging that euer hee met with in Court; or elſe where. For at home he doth and commaundeth all that hee will: but in an other mans houſe, hee muſt take all that is giuen him.
                     A pilgrime or Traueller ſhal come into a City, where he ſhal ſee faire and goodly Churches, ſtately buildinges, rich gates, high wals, paued ſtreetes, large market places, prouiſion inough aboundance of victuals, and numbers of ſtrangers: and when hee hath ſeen all this, hee doth ſo little eſteeme of them, that to returne againe to his poore home, hee trauelleth though it be all the night.
                     And therefore wee ſhould not wonder at thoſe, that doe not greatly Courtiers are rather grieued then relieued with the princely pompes of the Court. ſtray from their houſe, and that are but ſeldome in many places: but wee might well haue him in ſuſpition, that continualy wandreth through ſtrange Countries and houſes: for notwithſtanding the great wonders he ſeeth: &amp; the great conuerſation of amity, hee hath, or can finde, yet in the ende they are only the eies that are fed with the ſight of other things, and not the hart that is contented with his owne: and alſo to ſee in Princes Courtes great treaſure and riches, bringes vs cōmonly more griefe then delight: &amp; the more his eyes are fed with view of

faire dames of Courte, and princely pompe thereof, the greater ſorrow aſſaulteth his heart, hee may not ſtill enioy the ſame, And therefore the renowmed Focion, the Athenian captain, anſwered once certaine men, that ſaid there were to bee ſolde in the Marketplace of Athens goodly ſtones, and rich iewells worthy the ſight, howbeit hard to be bought, beeing helde at ſo hie a price by the Merchant that ſolde them. From my firſt youth (ſaide this philoſopher) I made an Oath, neuer to goe ſee any Citie, vnleſſe it were to conquer it, and yeeld it ſubiect to mee: neither to goe ſee Iewells, that I could not buye.
                     
                     The great Emperour Traiane was much commended, for that he neuer tooke toye in his head, to goe ſee any thing, but for one of theſe 3. cauſes, that is to ſay: eyther to imitate that he ſaw, to buy it, or elſe clearely to conquer it. Oh worthy wordes of Focion and Traiane, and very meete to be noted and retained.
                     Now to ſpeake more particularly of the troubles daily heaped on their The particular troubles of thē which follow the Court. necks that follow the Court, and that are to be lodged in diuers places, and ſtrange houſes. I ſay that if the poore courtyer doe depart at night from the Court, to repayre to his lodging, hee findeth oft times the hoſt of his houſe and other his gueſts at home, already in theyr beds, and faſt a ſleepe: ſo that it happeneth ſometimes he is faine to goe ſeeke his bed in another place, for that night. And alſo if he ſhould riſe early in the morning, to followe his matters: or to wayte vpon his Lord or Maſter, his Hoſt perhappes and his houſholde are not yet awake, nor ſtyrring to open him the doore.
                     And further, if his Hoſte be angrie and diſpleaſed, and out of time: who ſhall let him to locke his doores, the day once ſhutte in? and who ſhould compell him to open his dores before it be brode day?
                     Truely, it is a great hap to be well lodged about the Courte, and much more to meete with an honeſt Hoſte. For it hapneth oft, that the great pleaſure and contentation we receiue, being lodged in a faire Lodging is lightly taken from vs, by the harde intreatie, and ſtreight vſage of the Hoſte of the ſame.
                     And in this is apparant, the vanity, fondnes, and lightnes of ſome Courtyers, that rather deſire, and ſeeke for a faire and pleaſaunt lodging: then for a good and profitable.
                     The ambition of the Courtyer is now growne to ſo great a follie, that hee deſireth rather a faire lodging for his pleaſure, then a commodious or profitable for his familie. For admit The Ambition of the Courtyers. the Harbinger doe giue them a good and commodious lodging, if it be not ſightly to the Eye, and ſtand commodiouſly, they can not like of it, by no meanes. So that to content them, the Fouriers muſt needs prouide them of a faire lodging to the eye, though little handſome to lodge in: and yet ſometimes they will hard and ſcant be pleaſed with that.
                     And if the Courtyer be of reputation, and beloued in Courte, I pray you what payne and trouble ſhall the poore Harbinger haue to content his minde, and to continue in his fauour? For, before maſter Courtyer will be reſolued which of the 2. Lodgings he will take: the faire and moſt honorable, or the meane and moſt profitable, he bleedeth at the noſe for anger, and his heart beates and leaps a thouſand times in his bodie. For, his perſon would haue the good and commodious Lodging: and his follie, the pleaſaunt and faire.
                     I neuer ſaw dead man complaine of his graue, nor Courtyer content with his Lodging. For, if they giue him a Hall, hee will ſay it wanteth a

chimney, if they giue him a chamber, hee will ſay it lacketh an inner-Chamber: if they giue him a kitchen hee will ſay, it is too low and ſmoaky, and that it wanteth a larder, if they giue him a ſtable, that it wanteth a ſpence or ſtorehouſe, if they giue him the beſt and chiefeſt parts of the houſe, yet hee ſayeth, he wanteth ſmall and little houſes of office, and if hee haue acceſſe to the well, he muſt alſo haue the commodity of the Baſe-Court.
                     And in fine, if they giue him a low paued Hall, to coole and refreſh him in ſummer, hee will alſo haue a high borded Chamber for the winter, and poſſible hee ſhall not haue ſo many roomes at home in his owne houſe, as he will demaund in his lodging abroad. And therefore many thinges ſuffereth the Courtier in his owne houſe, that he will not beare with all in an Inne, or an other mans houſe. And it may bee alſo, that the Harbingers haue prouided them of a fayre and goodly lodging, where hee ſhall commaund both maſter, ſtuffe, and al other things in the houſe: and yet the Courtier ſhall miſlike of it, finding fault it is too farre from the Court, &amp; reputeth it halfe a diſhonour, and an impairer of his credit, to be lodged ſo farre off, ſince others that are beloued, and in fauour in Court in deede, lye hard adioyning to the Court, or at the leaſt not farre of: For this is an olde ſayde ſaying, The neereſt lodged to the Court, commonly the beſt eſteemed of the Prince.
                     I haue ſeene many Courtiers offer large gifts and rewards, to intreate the Harbingers to lodge them neere the Court: but I neuer ſaw any that deſired to be lodged neere the church; and this commeth, for that they rather glory to be right Courtiers, then good Chriſtians.
                     And therefore Blondus reciteth in his booke De declinatione Imperit, that a Grecian called Narſetes (a Captain of Iuſtinian the Great) was wont to ſay oft, That he neuer remembred he Many rather glory to be right Courtiers tken good Chriſtians. went to the ſea, nor entred into the Pallace, not beganne any battell, nor counſelled of warres, nor mounted on horſebacke, but that firſt hee went to the Church and ſerued God.
                     And therefore by the doings and ſaying of Narſetes, wee may gather that euery good man ought rather to incline to bee a good Chriſtian, then to giue himſelfe to armes and chiualry to be a right Courtier.
                     It hapneth many times, that after the Courtier bee come to his lodging, hee liketh of it well, and is well pleaſed with all: but when hee hath beene in others lodgings, and hath looked vpon them, ſtraight way hee falleth out of liking of his owne, and thinketh himſelfe ill lodged to others. And this miſliking groweth not of his ill lodging but of an inward malice and ſpite hee hath, to ſee his enemy preferred to a better then his owne: For ſuch is the ſecret hate and enuy, in Princes Courts (a thing common to Courtiers) that they diſdaine not onely to thanke the Harbingers for their care taken of them, in placing them in good lodgings: but they muſt alſo complaine and ſpeake ill of them, for the good lodgings they haue giuē to their Aduerſaries, and companions better then that of theirs.
                     There is alſo a foule diſorder in Court among the Harbingers, in appointing lodgings: and little modeſty beſides in Courtiers in as king them: For ſuch there are, that many times, neyther they, nor their parents haue any ſuch lodgings at home in their owne houſes, as they will demand only for their horſekeepers and ſeruants: But the great pain of the Court is yet, that ſuch nouels as come newly to the Court, they ſay they are of great eſtimation

in the Countrey, rich and of an ancient houſe, and his Father of great authority and eſtimation; and when the truth is knowne, his fathers authority, and firſt eſtimation was, of good labourers, and husbandmen, their onely rents and reuenues conſiſt, in that they gote by the dayly ſwet and labour of their perſons, and their power and ability, in the rents of an other mans goods, and their liberty, in ſeruice and ſubiection of thoſe that gaue them wages, and hired them by the day. And would to God their bloud were not tainted with ſome other notable blot.
                     There is a plague alſo in the Court which alwayes dureth, and neuer leaueth The Courtyer of leaſt calling proues moſt troubleſom. Court, &amp; that is, that thoſe that are alwayes leaſt worth, and are of leaſt calling, doe preſume, and take vpon them moſt, and alſo are worſt to pleaſe of all others.
                     And this they doe (their power being ſmall) that they would ſupply, that in wordes &amp; countenance, which they want in deeds and effects. Ilye if I ſaw not once in the country of Aragon, a Gentleman that hired a whole houſe, where himſelfe and his family were very well lodged, and commodiouſly: &amp; after that I remēbred, I met with him in Caſtilla, where he could not content himſelf with the charge of eight houſes, beſides his firſt hee was appointed to: and the occaſion was, for that in Aragon hee payed for that houſe hee had, and for theſe he payed nothing: So that of an others purſe, euery man coueteth to ſhew his magnificence, and to declare his follies: but whē they defray their own charge they are as hard as flint, and goe as neere to worke as may be-
                     It is very true, that if there be any diſorder and trouble to bee lodged in the Court, it commeth alſo for the moſt part of the Harbingers, without whom the Courtiers could neuer be well lodged, although the Prince had commaunded they ſhould be lodged neere him. Albeit in the court a man may eaſily exempt himſelfe from the Princes counſell, and iuſtice of the ſame, hauing no ſutes there, and from the counſel and affayres of wars, being no captaine: From the Sinod All Courtiers ſubiectto the authority of the Harbingers. of the Spirituality, being no Eccleſiaſticall perſon: and from that of the Indians, going to no Magitians, from the conuentions of Marchants, keeping ſafely their Marchandiſe: and from the correction of the Lord high Marſhall of the Court, not being fooliſh and inſolent: yet neuertheleſſe, there is no Courtier (be hee neuer ſo high or great in fauour) that can auoyde himſelfe from the Harbingers authority, but hee muſt needs come vnder his lee, being in their power to diſpoſe the lodgings as they thinke good: to lodge them honourably or meanely, to pleaſe or diſpleaſe them, to lodge, or diſlodge them. And if the Courtier happen at any time to quarrell, or fall out with them: I warrant him he ſhal be remembred of the Harbingers in his lodging, and poſſibly a Horſekeeper (yea perhapps his enemy) ſhall bee better lodged then he, or elſe hee may ſeeke his lodging in the ſtreets, where he will: For all other iniuries or offences in Courte, whatſoeuer, the Courtier may eaſilie redreſſe them by iuſtice, but for thoſe he receiueth of the harbinger, he muſt take them quietly, and be contented with them: For otherwiſe we ſhoulde not only offend them, but iniure our ſelues, &amp; make them prouide vs of no lodging: ſo hereby wee ſhould vtterly be diſlodged, &amp; vnprouided. And therfore they beare with many thinges in that office, which they would not doe in any other office: as for example: Thoſe kind of officers muſt be much made of, of others well intreated, accōpanied, feaſted, flattred, folowed, yea

many times ſerued and wayted vpon. I meane in ſeruing their turne, annointing their hands, and alwayes enriching their gloues with ſompeece of gold or ſiluer: and alas the ſilly Courtier that hath not ſuch ſoueraign ointment in his boxe, to cure theſe aboue recited ſores, but onely to ſerue his owne turne: if hee be not How a courtyer may make the Harbinget his friend. his kinſman, or neare allyed, let him yet at leaſt get acquainted with him, and make him his friend: an eaſie thing to bring to paſſe, if hee doe not vexe him, nor giue him ouerthwart language, and ſometimes he muſt inuite him to dinner and ſupper: For in the court there is no goodnes gotten, neyther by the King, by the beloued, by the noble men, by the honourable of his Councell, Treaſurers, nor yet by the Harbingers, but in ſuffering them, and doing them alwaies good and acceptable ſeruice. And if perchance the Harbingers wrong you, and doe you diſpleaſure, or that they ſhould ſay, you were troubleſome and importunate: yet be you wiſe for to beare with them in any caſe, &amp; ſeeme not to heare them: For what loſeth the Courtier, if hee beare now andthen with a few crooked words at the Harbingers hands? marry by forforbearing them, he happily commeth to be lodged the better.
                     Suppoſe the Courtier bee not alwayes lodged to his mind and deſire, ſhould he immediately complaine of them, or murmur at them? no ſure, he he ſhould but ſo doing ſhew himſelfe of ſmall education. For what skilleth it, though among many poundes of good meate, the Butcher ſometimes mingle a morſell of liuer, lungs, or lights of the Beaſt. And therefore a man ſhould not blame the poore Harbingers ſo much as they doe: for they are not commanded of the King to build new lodgings, but ſuch as they are, to diuide them among the traine of his Court: So that they do lodge Courtiers in ſuch as they finde, and not in thoſe they would, adding thereto, that they haue regarde vnto their eſtates and demerits, and not to the affections and willes of the perſons they lodge. For it were more reaſon they ſhould appoint the greateſt and beſt lodgings, to the nobleſt peſonages, &amp; eldeſt ſeruants of Court, then to the late and new come Courtier, whoſe youth can better away How the Harbinger is to appoint his lodgings. with an ill nights lodging, then the gray hayres of the old Courtier. Otherwiſe, the ſeruice of the olde Courtier that hath ſpent his young yeeres in Princes Courts (to the great paine and trouble of their perſons) and in his ſeruice, ſhould for guerdon bee payde with ingratitude, if hee ſhould not be preferred to the beſt commodious lodging for his eaſe, and alſo the firſt to be aduanced by the Prince before the young Seruiture.
                     Now if it be honeſt and reaſonable, that the Harbinger haue greate conſideration to the merites of him that hee lodgeth: Euen ſo it is fitte, the Courtier ſhould weigh the preſſe of the Court, and incommodious place, where the Harbingers are conſtrained to lodge them: knowing that to day the Court remoueth to ſuch a place where there are happily ſixe thouſand houſes, and to morrow perhaps there are not a thouſand, therefore if in ſuch a place hee find but narrow Fuſtian to make him a doublet: let him take patience till ſuch time as they remoue to another place, where they ſhall finde broad cloath inough to make them large clokes.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. III. How the Courtier ſhould entreate his hoſt or maſter of the houſe where hee, lyeth.
                     
                     
                        THe good and ciuill Courtier muſt alſo The Courtier muſt entrear his hoſt well where hee lyeth. entreate his Hoaſt well where he lieth: for elſe, if hee come into his lodging brauling, and thretning, it may be, that beſides hee will keepe his heart and good cheare ſecret frō him, he will not alſo open his chamber dores to him. There are in the Court ſuch hare-braines and vnvndiſcreet perſons, that haue ſo little regard and reſpect to their honeſt hoſts, that they doe nothing in their lodgings, but reuell and keepe ill rule, and do euen what they liſt, as though the houſe were theirs to commaund, and not giuen them onely for lodging: Whereof ſprings two exceeding euils, the one that they offend God: and the other, that the Prince is alſo il ſerued. For the houſe is not giuen them to commaund, but onely appointed for them to lodge in.
                     We reade in the life of the Emperour Seuerus, that he ordained in Rome, that if the owner of the houſe did intreate his gueſt and ſtranger ill, or that he did him hurt or diſpleaſure, the ſtranger ſhould accuſe him before the Iuſtice, but in no wiſe braule nor quarrell with him in his owne houſe:
                     
                        Plutarch in his Politikes alſo reciteth, that in the Temples of the gods, in the Realme of Dace, there was no liberty or ſafety for malefactors, ſaue in their their owne proper houſes, which ſerued them for their only refuge, and inuiolable aſſurance: for they thoght that within the entry and gates of the ſame, none other but the Lords and Maſters of the houſe might pretend any iuriſdiction or Segnory.
                     Now, if among the Daces, no officer or Iuſtice could lay hold, or puniſh any man, ſo long as hee kept his, houſe: mee thinketh it is againſt all reaſon and humanity, that the Courtier ſhould once offer his hoſt an iniurious or vnſeemely word.
                     
                        Plato being one day reproued of his friends, for that hee would not rebuke his hoſt Denis the Siracuſian, who at the firſt receyued him very courteouſlie, and afterwards vſed him ill: anſwered them thus.
                     My friend, to be angry with fools that ſhew vs pleaſure, to take reuenge of children, whom wee haue brought vs, to beate a woman, with whom we muſt bee familiar, and to braue and braule with thoſe, in whoſe houſes we are lodged, neyther the Philoſophers of Greece ought to counſell him, nor the noble heart once to thinke to doe it.
                     I cannot deny, but that there are ſome hoſtes very rude and vnciuill, that it is in maner an impoſſible thing to bring him to any honeſty or ciuilitie. Howbeit, notwithſtanding, I would wiſh the noble and worthy Courtier to take in ieſt, all the wrongs and iniuries done, or ſayde to him by his hoſt, or at the leaſt to ſeeme, as though he heard them, not at all, otherwiſe, from the day the Courtier falleth out with him, hee may euen withall thinke preſently to depart his houſe, and to ſeeke him a new lodging: for hee can neuer bee quiet in his lodging, where the goodman of the houſe, and hee cannot agree. And whereſoeuer the fine Courtier ſhall lodge, let him neuer ſticke at the charges of a locke to his chamberdore, a hatch to the window, a degree

or two to the ſtayres, a rope for the well, a harth to the Chimney, nor for a caſemēt to the window: for theſe are but trifles, and they coſt little though he leaue them to the houſe: 
                           
                              •
                           ow the Courtier may make his hoſt beholden to him. yet with theſe trifles hee bindeth his hoſt, and makes him beholding vnto him. Alſo hee may not forget ſomtime, to ſend home cates to his hoaſt, and to inuite him to dinner to him, and likewiſe if his hoaſt did preſent him with any thing, hee muſt accept it in very good part, and thanke him much for it: For other while, by ſmall preſents, great friendſhippe is obtained.
                     The diſcreete Courtier muſt alſo forbid his Pages and ſeruants to come into his Hoſts garden, to ſpoyle his fruit, or to gather his flowers, to ſteale his hennes, or to breake any thing of his: That they pull not vp the pauements of the houſe, paint his walles with coles or chalke, that they robbe not his Doue-houſe, nor make any noyſe to ſteale his Coneyes, to breake his glaſſe windows, and to hurt or marre any thing about his houſe: For if many times they refuſe to lodge ſtrangers in their houſes, it is not for want of lodging, or that the Maſters ſhould comber them: but for the diſpleaſures and ſhrewde turnes they receyue by their pages, and ſeruants daily: Yet ſhall chance many times that a Citizen that hath a faire new houſe, goodly white wals, and trimly painted, ſhall haue a Courtier come to lodge in his houſe, that ſhal haue ſuch a traine with him of ſeruants, young children and their Nephewes, which are ſo fooliſh, proud, and ſo rechles: that they breake the formes, throw downe Tables, paint and bedawd the walls, beate downe dores, runne thorough the ſeelings, ſteale the birdes, and doe a thouſand other miſchiefes and vnhappy turnes, ſo that the poore owner of the houſe had rather lodge an other time Egyptians &amp; beggers, then ſuch rude and harmeful Courtiers.
                     And therefore I haue ſeene in the Court, by reaſon of the ſeruants diſorder, and ill rule, the maſters commonly ill lodged, lodgings denied them, or after they had them to bee quite taken from them.
                     One of the neceſſarieſt things a Courtier ſhould haue, is to keepe quiet and well conditioned ſeruants: otherwiſe it is to bee thought (as indeed the common ſaying is) the houſe to be ill gouerned, where the family &amp; ſeruants are ſo ill conditioned and diſordered.
                     And touching this matter, Aulus Gelius, De Noctibus Atticis ſayth, that when Cornelius Gracchus was returned to Rome, after hee had been Conſull a great while in the Iſles Baleares, hee ſayde theſe wordes before all the Senate. It is neceſſary for Courtiers to keepe quiet ſeruants.
                     
                     
                        You know (Fathers Conſcript) I haue beene Chiefe Iuſtice and Conſull thirteene yeares: during all which time I ſweare to you by the immortall Gods, that to my knowledge I neuer did wrong to any mā, neyther any ſeruant of mine diſpleaſure to any, nor done any thing that was not lawfull to bee done in the houſe where I lay.
                     
                     
                        Phalaris the tyrant, when he receiued any diſpleaſure of the Agrigentines, hee cauſed his ſeruants to lodge in their houſes with them, for the one and the other were ſo wicked, ſo vnthrifty, ſuch quarrellers and brawlers, that he could not worke them a greater ſpight nor diſpleaſure, then for to lodge them here and there in their houſes.
                     There bee alſo in the Court ſome Courtiers, that are eſteemed of euery man to bee of ſo euill behauiour and demeanour, their ſeruants and family of ſuch lewd and naughty conditions, that their hoſts are throughly reſolued

eyther not to receyue them into their houſes, or if they bee compelled to it, to abſent themſelues for the time of their being there: rather then to ſuffer ſuch iniuries and wronges, as they are ſure they muſt take at their hands.
                     The Courtier muſt conſider that The Courtier is to commaund his ſeruants courteouſly to aske of his Hoſt all needfull things. ſometimes hee hath need of a bottell of water to drinke, a broom to ſweepe his chamber, a platter or diſh to ſerue him withall, of a Table cloth and napkins, and of a towell for his hands, and his face, of a ſtoole to ſit on, and ſome kettle for the kitchin: and in ſuch caſe he ſhould charge his ſeruaunts courteouſly to aske theſe things of his hoſt, and not to take them perforce and vnasked.
                     Euery man deſireth to bee Maſter in his owne houſe, and bee hee brother, coſen, or friend, hee will not ſuffer him to beare as much rule in his owne houſe, as himſelfe. So that hee will be leſſe offended with the hurt &amp; loſſe of thoſe things that he hath lent, and were gently asked him: then with thoſe, which vnknowne to him by force, and againſt his wil, they haue taken from him, yea though they doe bring thē afterwards whole &amp; ſound againe.
                     And this our liberty is ſo much ſet by, that we ſhall ſee ſometimes a man for his pleaſure, play and loſe a hundred Crownes of gold, and ſay neuer a word: and on the other ſide, if one breake the leaſt glaſſe in his houſe, hee will cry, and rage to the heauens, I remember when I was a Courtier, and went to viſite an other Courtier, a friend of mine, that was ſicke in his lodging. I fell a chiding, and rebuking the hoſt, for that I found him exclayming and crying out of the Pages, which playing at the ball, had broken him a little lampe of glaſſe, and he anſwered me thus: I cry not ſir, for the loſſe of my Lampe, which is a halfe penny matter, nor for the oyle that they ſpilt, worth a farthing, but onely for the liberty they rob me of, and for the ſmall account they make of me.
                     The good and wiſe Courtier may not bee too familiar with his Hoſts wife, nor ſuffer his ſeruants to bee buſie with the maides of the houſe, more then to ſpeake to them for their neceſſaries: for in this caſe, they ſhould leſſe hurt the Maſter of the houſe, to ranſacke and ſpoyle his houſe, and all that he had in it, then to take from him his honour and good name. To caſt the beds on the flower, to breake the dores and windowes, to vnpaue the ſtone, to paint and blacke the walles, or to make any noyſe in the houſe, are all of them things, yet ſometimes tollerable, though not honeſt nor ciuill: but to take his wife, and to abuſe her, it is neyther lawfull nor poſſible to diſſemble it, much leſſe to ſuffer it: for it were too much ſhame &amp; reproch to the husband to abide it, &amp; high treaſō and crime abominable for the Courtier to doe it. Now ſince men are frayle, and that they cannot, nor will not ſubdue their paſſions and filthy motions of the fleſh, there wanteth notwithſtanding, not women in Princes Courts, whoſe loue and friendſhip they may eaſily embrace, which though they were all commanded to auoyde the Court, and the verge of the Court, yet it could not be choſen, but ſome might ſecretly continue ſtill in Court, to entertaine the Courtly Courtiers. For if in the Court, there Too many women about the Court. bee kept a table of play two moneths onely in the yeare, all the yeare long beſides they finde the ſtreetes full ſtored of common women, when the yeare is moſt plentifull, and fruitfull of all thinges, yet ſtill there lacketh ſome prouiſion of victuals in the Court, but of ſuch women, there is neuer no want, but rather to many.
                     
                        
And therefore wee haue not ſayde without great reaſon, that it were too much treaſon and diſhoneſtie for the Courtyer to fall in Loue with his Hoſteſſe: For in doing it, hee ſhould doe her husband too much wrong, defame the wife, and offend her Friendes and neighbors, and vtterly vndo himſelfe.
                     For Suetonius Tranquillus reciteth, that Iulius Caeſar cauſed a Captaine of his to be beheaded, onely for ſlaundering and defaming of his Hoſteſſe, the which he did not, tarying for the complaint of her Husband, nor the accuſation of any other.
                     And the Emperour Aurelianus, ſeeing one of his men at a windowe one day pulling his Hoſtoſſe by the ſleeue, cauſed his hand to bee ſtriken off immediately: althogh both his Hoſteſſe and he ſwore, he did it but in ieaſt, and to no other intent.
                     
                        Plutarch in his Booke De Matrimonio ſaith: that there was a law among the Licaonians, that if any ſtranger did but onely talke with his Hoſteſſe, his toung ſhould bee cut out of his head, and if hee had paſſed further, that he ſhould then looſe his head.
                     
                        Macrobius alſo in his Saturnales, reciteth, that amongſt the Romaines it was reputed a great infamie, if any man came, and prayſed the beautie and manners of the Miſtreſſe of the houſe, where he Lodged: For, in praiſing her, hee lets them vnderſtand he knew her: and knowing her, he ſpake to her, and ſpeaking to her, he opened his heart to her, and this doing, hee planely defamed her, and made her to be euill reported of.
                     
                        Aulus Gellius writeth, that the like puniſhment was inflicted on him that had carnall participation with any of the 
                           Ʋeſtall virgines: the ſelfe ſame was alſo executed on him that procured any infamie to his Hoſteſſe, where he was lodged.
                     Which puniſhment was, eyther to be cut in the middeſt, and quartred in foure partes, or elſe to bee ſtoned to death aliue.
                     The good Courtyer muſt alſo haue The care the Courtier ought to haue of his Apparell. an other great regarde, and that is, to commaund his ſeruants to looke well to his Ryding-apparell, and ſuch as are lent him of Courtyers, to weare otherwhiles, to ſee that it be kept clean, and well-bruſhed, and aboue all ſafely deliuered where it was borrowed.
                     For commonly the horſ-keepers haue the horſes lowſing-cloathes and theyr Maiſters Foote-cloath more neate and cleanly, then the Groomes and Pages of the Chamber haue his Apparrell: and this proceeds of their great ſloth and negligence.
                     And truely this paſſeth the bounds of ſhamefaſt degree: yea, and commeth much to charge the Courtyers conſcience, the ſmal account he hath, ſo to let his garments and Apparrell, and all other his moueables, to bee ſpoyled and loſt.
                     And this happeneth very oft by the negligence of their pages &amp; ſeruants: which now throweth them about the Chambers, dragges them vppon the ground: now ſweepes the houſe with them, now they are full of duſt, then tattred and torne in pieces: here their hoſe ſeam-rent, there their ſhooes broken: So that if a poore man come afterwards to buye them, to ſell againe, it will rather pitie thoſe that ſee them, then giue them any courage to buye them. Wherfore the Courtyer ought not to bee ſo careleſſe, but rather to thinke vppon his owne things, and to haue an eye vnto them. For, if he goe once a day to his ſtable to ſee his horſes, how they are kept and looked too, hee may likewiſe alſo take another day in the weeke, when hee may finde leyſure to ſee his Wardroppe, how his Apparell lyeth.
                     But what pacience muſt a poor man take, that lendeth his implemēts &amp; apparrell

to the Courtiers? that neuer layeth them abroad a ſunning, to beate out the duſt of them, nor neuer layeth them in water, to waſh &amp; white them, be they neuer ſo foule. And albeit the beds and other implements lent to the Courtier, bee not of any great value, yet it is not fitte they ſhould be throwne at their tayle, and kept filthily: for as charily and daintily doth a poore labouring, and huſ, bandman keepe his woollen coverlet, and ſetteth as much by it, as doth the iolly Courtier by his quilt, or ouerpaine of ſilke.
                     And it chanceth oft times alſo that though at a neede the poore mans bed coſteth him leſſe money, then the rich mans bed coſteth him: yet doth it ſerue him better, then the rich and coſtly bed ſerueth the Gentleman or Nobleman. And this to be true, we ſee it by experience, that the poore husbandman or Citizen ſleepeth commonly more quietly, and at his caſe, in his poore bedde and cabben, with ſheetes of towe, then doth the Lord or rich Courtier, lying in his hanged Chamber and bed of ſickeneſſe, wrapped in his fineſt Holland ſheetes, who ſtill ſigheth and complaineth.
                     And finally, wee conclude, that then when the Court remoueth, and that the Courtier departeth from his lodging where he lay, hee muſt with all courteſie thanke the good man and How the Courtier is to demeane himſelfe at his departure from his lodging. good wife of the houſe for his good lodging, and courteous intertainment hee hath had of them, and muſt not ſticke alſo to giue them ſomewhat for a remembrance of him, and beſides, giue certaine rewards among the maides and men ſeruants of the houſe, according to their ability, that he may recompence them for that is paſt, and winne their fauour for that is to come.

                     And the ſelfe reuerence and cuſtom had towards God, Moſes, Aaron, Tobias, Dauid, Salomon, and other Fathers of Egypt, making like interceſſiō when they ſpake with God, ſaying, Domine, mi Rex, Si inueni gratiam in oculis tuis, loquar ad Dominummeum.
                     
                     O my Lord and King, if I haue found fauour in thy ſight, I will ſpeake vnto thee: if not, I will keepe perpetuall ſilence: For there is no ſeruice ill, when it is gratefull and acceptable to him, to whom it is done: as to the contrary none good, when it pleaſeth not the party that is ſerued: For if he that ſerueth be not in his maſters fauor he ſerueth, he may wel take paine to his vndoing, without further hope of his good wil or recompence.

Wherfore touching that I haue ſaid, I inferre, that hee that goeth to dwell and abide in the Court, muſt aboue all, endeuour himſelfe all hee can to obtaine the princes fauour, and obtaining it, hee muſt ſtudy to keepe him in his fauour: For it ſhould little preuaile the Courtier to bee beloued of all otherr, and of the Prince onely to be miſliked. And therefore Alcamidas the Grecian, being once aduertiſed by a friend of his, that the Athenians did greatly thirſt for his death, and the Thebans deſired his life: hee anſwered him thus: If thoſe of Athens thirſt for my death, and them of Thebes likewiſe deſiring my life, I can but bee ſorry and lament. Howbeit yet, if K. Philip my ſoueraigne Lord and Maſter, holde me ſtill in his grace and fauour, and repute me for one of his beloued, I care not if all Greece hate &amp; maligne me, yea, and lye in waite for me.
                     Indeed ſir, it is a great thing to get into the princes fauour, but when he hath gotten it, doubtleſſe it is a harder matter to know how to keepe it: For to make them loue vs, and to win their fauour, wee muſt doe a thouſand manner of ſeruices: but to cauſe them to hate and diſlike of vs, the leaſt diſpleaſure in the world ſufficeth. And therefore the paine and trouble of him that is in fauour in the Court is The troble of him that is in fauour in the court is great. great, if hee once offend, or bee in diſpleaſure: For albeit the prince do pardon him his fault, yet he neuer after returneth into his fauor againe: ſo that to conclude, hee that once onely incurreth his indignation, hee may make iuſt reckoning neuer after, or maruellous hardly to be receyued againe into fauour. Therefore ſayeth the diuine Plato in his bookes De Republica, That to be a King and for to raigne, to ſerue and to be in fauour, to fight, and to ouercome, are three impoſſible thinges, which neyther by mans knowledge, nor by any diligence can be obtained: onely remaining in the hands, and diſpoſing of fickle fortune, which doth deuide, and giue them where it pleaſeth her, and to whom ſhe fauoureth beſt.
                     And truely Plato had reaſon in his ſaying, for to ſerue, and to be beloued is rather happe and good fortune: then induſtry or diligence.
                     Since wee ſee oft times, that in the Court of princes, thoſe that haue ſerued but three yeares onely, ſhall bee ſooner preferred and aduanced, then ſuch one, as hath ſerued perhaps 20. or 30. yeares, or poſſible all his life time.
                     And further, hee ſhall bee both diſplaced, and put out of ſeruice, by meanes of the other. And this proceeds not through his long and faithfull ſeruice hee hath done, but onely by reaſon of the good happe that followeth him.
                     Although Plato telleth, that to gette Realmes and Seigniories, to ouercome battels, and to be fauoured and beloued of princes, be things graunted to vs, rather by hazard and fortune, then by force of good works and laudable actes, or by long toyling in painefull ſeruice: yet the Noble and ſtout heart therefore ſhould not ceaſe at any time to enterpriſe, and manfully to execute in euery occaſion preſented to him, to atchieue to fame, and honour: neyther for any pain and labour to loſe the hope to obtaine his pretended purpoſe: for men ſometimes Want of audacity hinders good fortunes. loſe many things, rather through timerouſnes, and want of audacity, then for that they lacke good happ or fortune. To ſee in the Court of princes ſome to bee richer, more honoured, more noble, more eſteemed, better beloued, more wayted vpon, better ſerued, and better welcome then others, and more ſeared then others: we may by theſe tokēs know, that fortune

hath not vſed to reward thoſe with ſuch fauours and preferments, which liue at home idely, and much leſſe Courtiers, who liue in Court with all pleaſure and delicacie, wherewith they are neuer wearied.
                     Let no man bee ſo fond to thinke that fortune is ſo bountifull and liberall, The reaſon why fortune rayſeth ſome, and throweth down others that for his authority or onely thought, ſhee will be once moued to lift him out of miſery, to exalt him to higher place and dignity, without ſom ſecret and priuate reſpect had to his vertue: For when ſhee many times vpon a ſuddaine rayſeth any to high and great eſtate, it commeth by the merites of him that is exalted, or thorow the diſpleaſure of him that is throwne downe, in whoſe roome ſhe hath placed an other in fauour with her. As wee reade of Iulius Emilius, for a time high in fauour, and afterwards in great diſgrace with the Emperour Conſtantius, in whoſe place and roome ſucceeded afterwards an other named Alexander, who beeing one day reproued by ſome of his friendes of ingratiude towards them (that ſaide they were cauſers and furtherers of his honour and preferment) aunſwered them in this manner: Maſters, if I am come into ſuch fauour with the Emperour, my good and gracious Lord, ſucceeding in the place of Emilius, truly it was more by reaſon of his deſerued fall, then by your obtained means or requeſts: Fortune and his heauy deſtiny, hauing ſo willed &amp; ordained it, more to ouerthrow and diſplace him of his room and credit he was in, then to aduance and preferre mee to the ſame.
                     The which I ſay, to aduiſe the Citizen and Gentleman that goeth to the Court to be a Courtier, to the end hee be not fickle headed, and light of beleefe, to thinke that immediately he ſhall come to ſuch authority, that he may eaſily commaund all that he will: neyther that hee ſhould ſo much deſpayre, and be hopeleſſe, but that by time (in ſeruing well) he might come to be in as great fauour, as any other about the Prince.
                     Wee ſee dayly ſuch change and alterations in the Common-weale, and fortune to turne her vnſtable wheele ſo oft, that many times the adminiſtration of the Common weale is in his hands and rule, of whom before they made little or none account: and therefore I ſay to you, and againe returne to tell you, that the Courtier that ſeeketh to come into his Princes fauour, and to be beloued of him, and The courſe he muſt take that would bee in his Princes fauour. that coueteth to be well reputed of in Court, muſt endeauour himſelfe to bee very honeſt, and as neere as may be, faultleſſe of life, and true and faithfull in his charge or office hee taketh vpon him: For the good opinion that men haue of a man, is euer the firſt degree to attaine to the Princes fauour: For there is no man in the world, of whatſoeuer eſtate or condition hee bee, ſo vitious and laſciuious, but at the leaſt hee deſireth to haue an honeſt and vertuous man in his houſe: ſo that a man may ſay, that the good, and godly life is the readieſt meane &amp; way (where euer the perſon be) to bring him ſooneſt into the Princes fauour, and to make him to bee beloued generally.
                     Wherefore Phalaris the Tirant writing to an Emulator of his, ſayde theſe words vnto him: I confeſſe, thou art an honeſt man, but thou wilt not deny mee alſo, that all thoſe thou keepeſt in thy houſe, be wicked perſons, and of an euill life: a thing which in my houſe thou ſhalt finde all contrary: For although I am a Tirant, at leaſt yet I loue, that no ill diſpoſed perſon eate bread in my houſe: So though I am laden with many vices: yet am I accompanied alſo with many wiſe and learned men.
                     
                        
The diuine Plato came from Greece into Scicilia, onely to ſee Dioniſius the Syracuſan, and not Plato himſelfe alone but alſo diuers other Philoſophers, in company with him, whom he did not onely honor and entreat well, but alſo ſawe they wanted nothing fit, or neceſſary for them.
                     Many times Dioniſius was wont to ſay theſe words. I am Captaine of the Rhodians, ſith I defend them from the Affricans, and king of the Affricans, becauſe I gouerne them: and friend of the 
                        The ſaying of Dioniſius to Plato &amp; other Philoſophers that came to viſite him. 
                        Italians, becauſe I offend them not: and Father of the Philoſophers, becauſe I help to relieue them in all their neceſſities: &amp; the Scicllians call mee a tyrant, becauſe they ſee I leaue not to puniſh them, and keepe them vnder.
                     
                     By theſe two examples we may gather, that the tirants being friends to vertuous and honeſt men, much more and of neceſſity ought the good and iuſt Princes to be. Alſo the Courtier muſt take great heed hee be not arrogant, and a lyer, a flatterer and diſſembler: for thoſe and ſuch like faults are rather woods and by-paths, vtterly to loſe a man: then a plaine high way to bring him into fauour and credit. And although by chance there haue beene ſome, that with all theſe faults haue notwithſtanding crept into fauour: yet wee will ſhew them a hundred, that onely for thoſe vices haue beene caſt out of fauour and credit both: For commonly, all thoſe that by the fauor of wicked Princes beginne to bee great, and of ſome honour, and that ſtudy by all disſhoneſt and vnlawfull meanes to continue and keepe themſelues in credit and fauour: Albeit for a time wee ſee them raigne and flouriſh in proſperity: yet that laſteth not long, neyther is it perpetuall, but a time commeth againe, when we ſee them fall, and quite caſt of, to theyr great ſhame and vtter vndoing.
                     There are many that knoweth and vnderſtandeth the Princes Court but meanely, or not at all, which beleeue that for being well ſpoken, and being carefull and diligent in their buſines and affayres, they ſhould the ſooner for that come in fauour and credite before others: but in the end their hope and imagination is nothing, not aunſwering any thing their deſire: for as there are in Court many greene heades, and graceleſſe couertures, which are of no reputation, nor any thing ſet by, neyther deſeruing to bee well thought of: ſo are there many wiſe heades and beloued Courtiers, greatly eſteemed and reputed of.
                     And this for their owne good demerites, and by meanes alſo of the others wicked abuſe and diſorder. Sue tonius Tranquillus reciteth, that Scilla the Conſull, beeing a mortall enemy of the Marians, (of which faction was alſo Iulius Caeſar) ſayde: that from Caeſars infancy, his wiſedome made him more to bee feared and wondred at: then euer his ſtout and valiant courage he ſhewed.
                     
                        Plutarch writing to Tratan, ſayde. I aſſure thee (Soueraigne Prince) I doe more eſteeme and honour thy perſon, then I doe care for all thy Empire beſides: For I haue ſeene thee doe a thouſand good things to deſerue it, but I neuer ſaw thee once deſirous to haue it.
                     
                     And ſure in my opinion, I verily thinke there is no better Alchemy in Court, to grow to ſodaine Wealth, &amp; to acquire the Princes fauour: then that the fame of his good life ſhould rather reſound his praiſe to the Prince thereby to make him knowne vnto him: then the reſpect of his Noble houſe or progeny.
                     That Courtier alſo that craueth his Princes grace, muſt take heed in any wiſe hee bee not companion with raſh and haſty perſons, whoſe vnſtable heades miſlike of euery ſtate, ſtill deprauing all other vertues. Such

Fellow-mates and companyons, the wiſe Courtyer muſt in any caſe refuſe to be conuerſant with.
                     I muſt aduiſe him alſo, hee beware he be not raſh of ſpeeche, nor that he ſpeake yll of any man. For, it is a right kinde of treaſon, to detract or backebyte our Friends: and much more the Prince, to whom wee wholly owe our dutie and alleageance. And therefore the wiſe and vertuous Courtyer muſt flye from this company as farre as hee Backbyting is a kinde of treaſon, eſpecial
                              •
                           y againſt princes. can, that are poſſeſſed with ſuch vaine humours and paſſions of minde: For ſuch kinde of men, will neuer counſeli vs to ſerue well, nor to beware of liberall ſpeaking, but will rather infect vs, and bring vs to their naughtie vaine humour, and make vs bee deemed as bad as themſelues (though wee be not ſo,) onely for keeping them companie.
                     Like as in Common-weales, there are ſeditious heads, which moue and and ſtyrre vp the poore Commons to rebellion: euen ſo in Princes Courts, there are the like factious heads, that ſeeke to winne good will of courtiers: and ſo to ſtyrre vp their mindes alſo, to tumult and ſedition: which becauſe they haue no way to come vp, and grow in fauour, do detract, and ſpeak ill of thoſe that are in Fauour and authoritie.
                     One of theſe abiects, and inferior ſort, ſhall go to the houſe of another, (in like diſgrace and diſcredite that himſelfe is in:) and there theſe companyons ſhall open theyr throates againſt the Prince, and his Court: ſaying: The King careth not for his Subiects: Talking of the high mindes and countenaunces of the beloued and fauoured of Court: of the affections of the Counſell, of the parciality and enmitie of the Court: of the want of munition for warres, &amp; of the fall and decay of the common-wealth: and thus with theſe leaud &amp; vncomely diſcourſes, they ſpend the long and dolefull nights of Winters ſeaſon; and therewithall alſo, the long and hot Sunnydayes of Summers time.
                     
                        Adrian the Emp: being once in formed, that ther met and aſſembled together daily, at the houſe of one Lucius Turbon, a number of the ſeditious and The law of A drian the Emperour againeſt ſedicious perſons. factious ſort of Rome, which were offended with him, &amp; conſpired againſt him: to preuent them of inſurrection, proclaymed preſently through Rome, and enacted it for a law, that all Courtyers, that aſſembled there, ſhould loſe their heads, and all the Romains ſhould be baniſhed.
                     All this that we haue ſpoken, is to baniſh vices from Princes Courts if it may be: For now-adayes, as there are many houſes of ordinarie Tables, and and numbers of Dycing-houſes, for all manner of play: ſo is there alſo in the Court, beſides the Groom-porters, other Chambers where they meete, to murmur at each mans doings.
                     And as there are ſome that ſay: Goe, Let vs goe to ſuch a mans houſe, and there wee ſhall finde Playe enough: and Good fellowſhippe, to paſſe the Time away as wee will, &amp;c. Euen ſo theſe others ſay, Goe, we will goe to ſuch a chamber, and there we ſhal meet with our companyons and good-fellowes, where wee may talke liberally, and at our pleaſure, without checke or controll of anie.
                     In famous be that houſe, where there is no other exerciſe, but play and riot: and accurſed bee that, where they cannot occupye themſelues, but in defaming and back-byting their Bretheren and neighbours. For to conclude, it were leſſe euill to play, and looſe their money, then to robbe and ſpoyle his neighbour of his good name.
                     Now to get into the Princes fauour, it helpeth much to conſider, wherein the Prince taketh his chiefeſt delight, and whereto he is beſt affected: whether

to Muſicke, Hunting, Flying, Ryding of horſes, or Fiſhing, running, or Leaping: or any other actiuitie whatſoeuer it bee. And his Affect and deſire (beeing once knowne and obſerued) hee muſt giue himſelfe whollie to loue that the Prince loueth, and to follow that that he followeth. And as Noble Princes comonly are giuen to their wills, to like of ſome paſtimes, better then others: ſo doe they ſhew themſelues more fauorable and gratious, to ſome of their ſeruants, then others: and rather to thoſe whom only they ſee conforme and agreable with theyr affections, then to ſuch as are always moſt diligent and painfull about them, to doe them the beſt ſeruice they can.
                     The curious Courtyer may account him ſelfe happie, if hee can frame him ſelfe to commende that the Prince alloweth, and likewiſe to diſalow of that the prince miſliketh: and though perhaps hee were many times of the contrarie opinion: hee may well thinke and belieue to himſelfe what he liketh beſt, but in no caſe to vtter that hee thinketh, nor yet to make any countenance to the contrary.
                     The Emperour M: Aurelius neuer dranke other then red wine: and becauſe hee was informed, that Torquatus the Romaine for his ſake, did not onely refraine from drinking Whitewines, but did alſo plant his vynes with red-grapes: hee made him Cenſour of Rome, and gaue him the warde of the gate Salaria in the ſaide Cittie.
                     In eating and drinking, in hunting, and Tilting, in peace and in warre, in youthfull ſportes, and graue matters: the wiſe Courtyer muſt alwayes follow the ſteppes and will of his prince, and imitate him in the ſame, the beſt he can.
                     And if it bee beneficiall for the Courtyer, to obtaine the fauour of his Prince, and to bee eſteemed of him: let him in no wiſe enterprize to talke to much vnto him; For, by continuall frequenting the Prince, it cannot otherwiſe fall out, but hee ſhall both trouble him, and be thought a proud, arrogant, and an importunate foole of him. And if the Courtyer hath no graue and weighty matters to moue the Prince in, to what purpoſe doth hee ſeeme to moleſt and importune the King?
                     We ſay in weighty matters to communicate with him. For to talke with the Prince, and to trouble his eares with tryfles and matters of ſmall moment, hee ſhould bee reputed of the hearers a raſh man: and of the King himſelfe, held but for a witles foole.
                     Let vs conſider a little what is fit for the Courtyer to doe, and what becommeth him beſt, and whether it be lawfull for him to conferrs with the Prince, and then wee ſhall come to know, if it be decent for him to ſpeake ofte to the Prince?
                     Therfore to go to the King to ſpeake ill of any man, I thinke no wiſe man will offer to do it: and if it be to giue him ſecret intelligence of anything: he muſt firſt doubt, whether the King will belieue him or no? and to thinke to counſell him, it is a token of a light head: and to preſume to ſit with the Prince, and to bee merry with him, to paſſe the time away, let euery man beware he runne not into that error, nor that hee once preaſe to doe it.
                     To ſend to reproue a Prince, I know not what hee is that would be ſo fooliſh hardie, as once to dare open his lips againſt him. And to ſlatter him (if the Prince be wiſe, he will underſtand him) and if hee, finde him once, it is enough to turne the Flatterer to great diſpleaſure: yea, and to put him quite out of fauour with him. And therefore to liue in ſurety, and auoyde theſe dangers, me thinks it is beſt to ſpeake but ſeeldome vnto him. Lucullus
                        
was a great friend to Seneca, and was alſo Gouernour of Scicilia, and demaunding one day of Seneca, What he might do that might be acceptable to Nero his Lord and Maſter. Seneca anſwered him thus.
                     If thou deſire to bee acceptable to Princes, Doe them many ſeruices, and giue them few words.
                     And ſo likewiſe the diuine Plato ſayde in his bookes de Repub That thoſe that haue to moue the Prince in any thing, in any caſe be briefe: for in delating too much, they ſhould both comber the prince, and make him alſo not giue attentiue eare, neither could hee haue leyſure to heare them nor patience to tarry them. And hee ſayde further, Thoſe matters and ſubiects they treate with princes in, and that are vſed to bee tolde them, ought to be graue and ſententious: eyther tending to commodity of the wealepublike, to his honour or profite, or to the ſeruice of the King, to whom he ſpeakes.
                     Theſe counſels and aduertiſements of Plato and Seneca (in my poor opinion) deſerue to be noted and had in memory. And notwithſtanding all that I haue ſpoken, I ſay yet further to you, that there is nothing diſpoſeth the prince better to loue and fauour his ſeruants, then to ſee them diligent in ſeruice, and ſlow in ſpeaking. For to rewarde him onely that ſeekes it by meanes of his tongue, and by words: It is onely in our free willes to doe it: but to recompence him that by his diligent ſeruice, onely craueth a good turne, and not in words, wee are in conſcience bound to it: And hereof ſpringeth the vulgar prouerbe: The Good ſeruice demāds recompence, though the tongue bee ſilent. good ſeruice is demaund ſufficient, though the tongue be ſilent.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. V. What manners and geſtures become the Courtier when hee ſpeaketh to the Prince.
                     
                     
                        WHen the Courtier determineth to ſpeake to the Prince, hee muſt firſt ſhew himſelfe vnto him with great reuerence, before he come at him, and if the the King be ſet, hee muſt kneele to him vpon one knee, with his cappe in his left hand, holding it neyther too farre, nor too neere his body, but rather downwards towards his knee, with a good grace and comely faſhion, not too luſtily, nor too much boldly, but with a ſet ſhamefaſt grauity, putting himſelfe on the left hand of the prince to ſpeake with him, whether he bee ſitting or ſtanding: For placing our ſelues on the left hand, wee leaue the King on the right, as duty willeth vs: For the right hand belongeth euer to the beſt perſon.
                     
                        Plutarch ſayth, that in the banquets the Kings of perſia made, they ſate him, whom they loued, and made moſt account of, cheeke by cheeke, and on the left hand of the prince, where the heart lyeth: ſaying, that thoſe whome they loued with their heart, ſhould bee ſet downe alſo on that ſide the heart lay, and in no other place.
                     
                        Blondus ſayeth to the contrary, that the Romans did honor the right hand ſo much, that when the Emperour entred into the Senate, no man durſt euer put himſelfe on his right hand. And he ſayth moreouer, that if a yong man were perchance found ſitting on the right hand of an old man, or the

Setuant on the vpper hand of his maiſter: the Sonne on the right-hand of his Father, or any Page, Prentice, or Seruing man, on the vpper-hand of a Burgeis or citizen: they were no leſſe puniſhed by Iuſtice for that faulte and offence, then if they had done any notable crime or delict.
                     Whoſoeuer will ſpeake vnto the Prince, muſt ſpeake with a ſoft voyce, and not too haſtily. For if hee ſpeake too lowde, thoſe that ſtand by, ſhall heare what hee ſayth to the King: and in ſpeaking too faſt, the King ſhall not eaſily vnderſtand what he ſaith. And hee muſt alſo, ere he ſpeake vnto the Prince, premeditate long before what hee will ſay to him: and put into him good wordes, and aptly placed: For, wiſe men are more carefull what wordes their Tongues ſhould vtter, then what their hands ſhould doe.
                     There is a great difference betwixte ſpeaking well and doing well: For in the end the hand can but ſtrike and offend: but the Tongue can both offend and defame.
                     Euen when the Courtyer is telling his tale to the Prince, let him be aduiſed in all his actions and geſtures, and that he play not with his cap from one hand to an other: much leſſe that he behold the Prince too earneſtly in the face. For in the one he ſhould be taken for a foole, and eſteemed in the other for a ſimple Courtyer.
                     
                     He muſt take great heed alſo, that he ſpit not, coffe, nor hawke, when hee ſpeakes to him: and if it be ſo hee be conſtrained by Nature to it, then let him holde downe his head, or at leaſt turne at one ſide, that he breath not in the Kings face.
                     
                        Plinie writing to Fabatus, ſayth: that the Kings of India, neuer ſuffered any man (in ſpeaking to them) to approch ſo neere them, that their breath might come to their face. And they had reaſon to do it, to auoyd ſtrong and vnſauorie breaths, growing rather of the indiſpoſition of the ſtomacke, or of the putrefaction of the Lungs, or of the corruption of the braine.
                     And if the Courtyer haue to ſpeake with the King after dinner or ſupper, Let him beware hee eate no Garlycke, nor Onyons, nor drinke wine without Things to be eſchewed of him that would ſpeake with the King. water. For if he ſauour of garlicke or onyons, the King may thinke hee lacketh diſcretion, to come with thoſe Sents to his preſence: or if his breath were ſtrong of Wine, that hee were a drunkard.
                     Hee muſt be very circumſpect alſo that when hee ſpeaketh to the King, he ſpeake not with his Head, as well as with his Tongue: nor that hee play not with his hands, nor his feete, nor that he ſtroke his beard, nor winke with his eyes: For ſuch fonde countenances and geſtures, doe rather become a Foole or ieſter, then a ciuill or honeſt Courtyer.
                     
                     And in his diſcourſe with the prince that hee exceede not in ſuperfluous words, more then ſhall only be needfull, and touching his matter: and not to ſeeme in his prefence to depraue, or detract any man. Hee may honeſtly alledge, (and that without reproache) that ſeruice hee hath done him: but not to laye before him others faultes and imperfections.
                     For, at ſuch a time it is not lawfull for him to ſpeake yll of any man, but onely to communicate with him, of his owne affayres. And he may not go ſo farre alſo, as to remember him with too great affection, the bloud ſpent by his Aunceſtors in his ſeruice: nor the great actes of his Parents: For this onely word ſaide to the Prince, I did this, better pleaſeth, and liketh the Prince, then to tell him a hundred other words, of that his predeceſſours had done.
                     It pertayneth only to women, and they may iuſtly craue recompence of

the Prince for the liues of their husbands loſt in the Princes warres: but the valiant &amp; worthy Courtier ought not to demaund recompence, but for that he onely hath done by pearſing In what ſort the Courtier is to demand recompeuce of the prince launce, and bloudy ſword.
                     He muſt beware alſo that hee ſhew no countenance to the King of inſatisfaction, neyther to be paſſioned in caſting his ſeruice in the Princes teeth ſaying, All others haue been recompenced ſaue onely him, whom the Prince hath cleane forgotten: For Princes will not that wee onely ſerue them, but that we alſo (at their willes and pleaſures) tarry for recompence, and not to haue it when wee gape, or are importune for it.
                     Howbeit, it is lawfull notwithſtanding, humbly and lowly, without choler or paſſion, to put the Prince in remembrance of all that wee haue done for him, and of the long time we haue ſpent in ſeruing him. Alſo the curious Courtier ſhall not ſhew himſelfe to diſlike at all of the Prince, neyther by heaping of many words, to induce him to hear him with the better good will: For mens hearts are ſo prone to ill, that for one onely vnpleaſant or ouerthwart word ſpoken to them, they lightly forget a thouſand ſeruices done them.
                     
                        Socrates being one day demanded what hee thought of the Princes of Greece, anſwered: There is no other difference betweene the names, and propeties of the gods, &amp; that of princes, but that the gods were immortall, and theſe mortall.
                     For theſe mortall princes vſe in a manner the like authoritie heere in earth, that the Gods immortall do in Heauen aboue.
                     Saying, further alſo, that I alwaies was, am, and will bee of that minde, that my mother Greece remain a common weale.
                     But ſince it is determined to bee gouerned by princely Monarchy, I wiſh them in al, and for al, to acknowledge their obedience and allegiance to their King and Soueraigne: For when they would otherwiſe vſe it, they may bee aſſured, they ſhall not onely goe againſt mortal Princes, but alſo againſt the eternall God.
                     
                        Suetonius Tranqutllus ſayth, that Titus the Emperour being aduertiſed that the Conſuls would kill him, and vſurpe his Empire, aunſwered thus wiſely.
                     Euen as without the diuine will and prouidence I could neuer haue poſſeſſed the Emperiall Crowne: ſo without their permiſſion &amp; ſufferāce, it lyeth in no mans power to depraue mee of it: For to vs men it pertayneth onely to keepe the Emperiall iuriſdiction, and to the gods alone to giue and defend it: Which wee haue ſpoken, to the end no man preſume to be reuenged of his Prince, neyther in word nor deede: for to ſpeake ill of him, wee ſhould rather purchaſe vs their high indignation and diſpleaſure, then procure vs any cauſe or ſuggeſtion to be reuenged of him.
                     Let the good Courtier bee alſo aduiſed, that in talking with the Prince he bee not too obſtinate, to contende with the Prince, or any other in the Princes preſence: For this name of arrogant and ſelfe willed, becommeth not the perſon of a wiſe Courtier: For The Courtier ſhoulde not be obſtinate. we know, that in ſport, and argument euery man deſireth to ouercome, how trifling ſoeuer the matter bee: And therefore wee reade in the Life of the Emperour Seuerus, that Publius the Conſull ieſted one day with Fabritius his Companion, and tolde him he was in loue.
                     Whom Fabritius anſwered: I do doe confeſſe, it is a fault to bee in loue, but yet it is a greater faulte for thee to bee ſo obſtinate as thou art: for loue proceedeth of wit and diſcretion,

but obſtinacy commeth of folly and great ignorance.
                     If perchance the King aske the Courtiers opinion in thoſe matters, they diſcourſed, if he know his opinion to agree with the Princes, Let him therfore tell it him hardly: but if it be contrary, let him holde his peace, &amp; not contend againſt him, framing ſom honeſt excuſe to conceale his opinion. How princes are to be ſpoken to, if they be in an error. But if perhaps the King were obſtinate, and bent to his opinion in any thing, and that through his ſelfe will, and obſtinacie, he would do any thing vnreaſonable or preiudiciall to his Common-wealth, and that great detriment might come thereby: yet for all this, in ſuch caſe the Beloued Courtier ſhould not at that inſtant be too plain with him, to let him vnderſtand his error, neyther yet ſhould hee ſuffer him altogether to paſſe his way vntouched, but in ſome fine manner and proper words (as may become the place beſt) to giue him to vnderſtand the truth.
                     But to vſe it with more diſcretion, hee ſhall not need before them all to open his whole mind, but to keepe his opinion ſecret, expecting a more apter time, when the King ſhall be apart in his Priuie Chamber, and then franckely to tell him his whole minde, with all humility and reuerence, and to ſhew him the plaine truth, without keeping any one thing from his knowledge: For otherwiſe in telling the King openly, he ſhould make him aſhamed? and in diſſembling his faulte alſo priuily, he ſhould not be admoniſhed of his error committed.
                     Now therefore let our concluſion bee, that the Courtier that proceeds in his matters, rather with opinion &amp; obſtinacy, then diſcretion and iudgement, ſhall neuer be in fauour with the Prince, nor yet beloued in the Court: For it is as neceſſary for the Courtier, that will ſeeke the fauour of the Prince, and loue of the Court, to impoſe his tongue to ſilence: as it is to diſpoſe his body to all manner of ſeruice.
                     I know there are ſome ſuch raſh, vndiſcreet, and arrogant fooles, that as much do boaſt and reioyce to haue ſpoken vndiſcreetly to the King, and without reſpect of his princely Maieſty: as if they had done ſome maruellous thankefull ſeruice, with whome, truely no man ought to be greatly offended, for ſuch fond boſts and vants as they make, and much leſſe alſo with that that happens to them afterward: The Courtier alſo muſt bee well aduiſed, How the Courtier muſt demean himſelfe, when his Prince ſporteth before him. that albeit the king for his pleaſure doe priuilie play with his handes, or ieſt with his tongue with the Courtier, and that he take great pleaſure in it: yet that he in no caſe preſume to doe the like (yea, thoogh hee were aſſured the Kings Maieſty would take it well) but let him modeſtly behaue himſelfe, and ſhew by his words and countenance, that hee thinketh the Prince doth honour him, in pleaſing his Maieſty to vſe thoſe paſtimes and pleaſant deuiſes with ſo vnworthy a perſon as he is: For the Prince may lawfully play, and ſport himſelfe with his Lordes and Gentlemen: but ſo may not they againe with him: For ſo doing, they might be counted very fond and light.
                     With a mans companions and coequals it is lawfull fot euery man to bee merry and playe with all: But with the Prince, let no man ſo hardy once preſume further, more then to ſerue- honour, and obey him. So that the wiſe Courtier, muſt endeauour himſelfe alwayes to come in fauour by his wiſedome, and courtly behauiour, in mattsrs of weight and importance: and by great modeſty and grauity, in thinges of ſport and paſtime: Therefore Plutarch in his Apothegmes ſayth, That Alcibiades amongſt

the Greekes a worthy Captaine, and a man of his owne Nature, diſpoſed to much mirth &amp; pleaſure, being asked once by ſome of his familiar friends, why he neuer laughed in Theaters, Banquets, and other cō
                        mon playes where hee was, aunſwered them thus: Where others eate, I faſte? where others take paine and play, I reſt mee, and am quiet: where others ſpeake, I 
                        Where wiſe men are beſt known. 
                        am ſilent, where they laugh, I am courteous, and ieſt not: For wiſe men are neuer knowne but among fooles and light perſons.
                     
                     When the Courtier ſhall vnderſtand, or heare tell of pleaſant thinges to be laughed at, Let him in any caſe (if he can) flye from thoſe great laughters and fooleries: that hee bee not perhaps moued too much with ſuch to
                           •
                        es, to laugh too lowde, to clappe his hands, or to doe other geſtures of the bodie, or admirations too vehement, accompanied either with a rude and barbarous manner of behauiour, then with a ciuill and modeſt nobleneſſe: For ouer great and exceſſiue laughter was neuer engendred of wiſdome, neyther ſhal he euer be counted wiſe of other that vſeth it.
                     There are alſo an other ſort of Courtiers that ſpeake ſo coldly, &amp; laugh ſo drily, and with ſo ill a grace: that it were more pleaſure to ſee them weep then to laugh. Alſo to nouell or to tell tales to delight others, and to make them laugh, you muſt be as briefe as you can, that you weary not and comber not the Auditory, pleaſant, and not biting, nor odious. Elſe it chanceth oftentimes, that wanting any of theſe conditions, from ieſting they come many times to good earneſt. Elius Spartianus in the life of the Emperour Seuerus ſayth, that the ſayd Em-Emperour had in his Court a pleaſant foole, and hee ſeeing the foole one day in his dumpes and cogitations, asked him what he ayled to be ſo ſadde? The foole made anſwere: I am deuiſing with my ſelfe what I ſhould doe to make thee merry. And I ſw are to thee my Lord Seuerus, that for as much as I 
                        What diſpoſition ſhould be in a Princes Ieſter. 
                        weigh thy life ſo deare, poſſibly I ſtudy more the nights for the tales I ſhall tell thee in the morrow after, then doe the Senators touching that they muſt decree on the next day.
                     
                     
                        And I tell thee further, my Lord Seuerus that to bee pleaſant and delighting to the Prince, hee muſt neyther be a very foole, nor altogether wiſe: But though hee bee a foole, yet hee muſt ſmatter ſomewhat of a wiſeman: and if hee bee wiſe, hee muſt take a little of the foole for his pleaſure.
                     
                     And by theſe examples wee may gather, that the Courtier muſt needs haue a certaine modeſty and comely grace, as well in ſpeaking, as hee muſt haue a ſoft &amp; ſweet voyce in ſinging: There are alſo ſome in Court, that do not ſpare to go to Noble mens bords to repaſt, which being in deede, the vnſeemely grace it ſelfe: yet in theyr wordes and talke at the boorde, they would ſeeme to haue a maruellous good grace, wherein they are oft deceyued. For if at times the Lordes and gentlemen laugh at them, it is not for any pleaſure they take in their talke but for the ill grace, and vncomely geſtures they vſe in their talke.
                     In the banquets and feaſts, Courtiers make ſometimes in the Summer, there are very oft ſuch men in theyr company, that if the wine they dranke tooke their condition, it ſhould bee drunke eyther colder or hoter then it is.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. VI. How the Courtier ſhould behaue himſelfe to know, and to viſite the Noble men and Gentlemen, that be great with the Prince, and continuing ſtill in Court.
                     
                     
                        THe Courtier that commeth newly to the Court, to ſerue there, muſt immediately learne to know thoſe that are in authority and fauour in the Court, and that are the Princes Officers: For if hee doe otherwiſe, neyther ſhould he be acquainted with any Noble man or Gentleman, or any other of the Princes ſeruants, neither would they alſo giue him place, or let him in when he would. For wee bee not conuerſant with him wee know not, and not being conuerſant with him, we truſt him not, and diſtruſting him, wee commit no ſecrets to him: He that will come to fauour in the Court muſt be acquainted with all the Courtiers in the Court. So that hee that will come in fauour in the Court, muſt make himſelfe knowne, and be friend to all in generall.
                     And hee muſt take heede that hee beginne not ſo ſuddenly to bee a buſie ſuiter in his owne priuate affayres: or for his friend, for ſo hee ſhall be ſoone reputed for a buſie ſoliciter, rather then a wiſe Courtier. Therefore hee that will purchaſe fauour and credite in the Court, muſt not bee carefull to preferre mens cauſes, and to entermeddle in many matters: For the nature of Princes is, rather to commit their affayres into the hands and truſt of graue and repoſed men, then to buſie and importunate ſoliciters: The Courtier alſo may not bee negligent to viſite the Prelates, Gentlemen and the fauoured of the Court, nor to make any difference betweene the one and the other: and not onely to viſite their parents and friends, but his enemies alſo: For the good Courtier ought to endeauour himſelfe the beſt he can to accept al thoſe for his frends at leaſt, that he cannot haue for parents and kinsfolkes: For amongeſt good and vertuous Courtiers, there ſhould neuer bee ſuch bloudy hate, that they ſhould therefore leaue one, to company with another, and to bee courteous one to another.
                     Thoſe that be of baſe mind, doe ſhew their cankred hearts by forbearing to ſpeake, but thoſe that bee of Noble bloud and valiant courage, beginne firſt to fight, ere they leaue to ſpeake together. For there is alſo an other ſort of Courtiers, which beeing ſometimes at the Table of Noble men or elſe where, when they heare of ſome quarrell or priuate diſpleaſure, they ſhew themſelues in offer like Lyons: but if afterwards their helpe be craued in any thing, and that they muſt needs ſtand by their friend, and draw on his his ſide, then they ſhew themſelues as ſtill as Lambes, and gentle inough to bee entreated.
                     Amongſt other the new come-Courtier hath to be acquainted withall, he muſt learne to know thoſe the Prince fauoureth, and loueth beſt, on whome hee muſt wayte and attende vpon, and doe all the ſeruice he can, without grudge and diſdaine: For there is no King, but farre off on him, hath an other King, that ſtill contrarieth his minde, and preuenteth him of his intent and pleaſure: And euer A Prince hath alwais ſome fauourite: neere vnto him ſome, whom hee loueth and fauoureth, that may diſpoſe of the Prince as hee liſteth. Plutarch writing to Traian ſayde theſe words.
                     
                        
                        I haue, O Traian, great pitty on thee: for the firſt day thou tookeſt vpon thee the Imperiall Crowne of the Romane Empire, of a free man thou thraldeſt thy ſelfe to bondage: For onely you other Princes haue authority to giue liberty to al others, but neuer to graunt it to your ſelues: ſaying moreouer, that vnder the colour of royall liberty, you ſhall remaine more ſubiect then your owne ſubiects that euer obey you: For if you command many in their houſes, alſo one alone after commaundeth you in your owne Courte.
                     
                     Now although many commanded the Prince, or that he would follow the counſell but of a few, or that hee loued one aboue an other, or that hee conſented one alone ſhould gouerne him, the good Courtier neede not once to open his mouth to reaſon of the matter: For ſo it might eaſily fall out, hee ſhould beginne out of hand to feele in the Court, of what importance it were to enter into ſuch diſcourſe of the Prince, &amp; afterwards to goe home to his own houſe, to end it with teares.
                     Firſt,, to purchaſe the high indignation of the Prince: Secondly, to be The inconueniences that follow the needles reaſoning of that the King allowes. diſdayned of the Court: Thirdly, to be caſt quite out of fauour: Fourthly, to bee exiled and baniſhed the verge of the Court: and fiftly, and laſtly, to end the reſt of his woful daies in a vile and miſerable place.
                     Now if it be hard to compaſſe to get into the Princes fauour: I thinke it no very ill counſell that at leaſt hee ſeeke to bee in fauour with him, that is in the Princes fauour: For oftentimes there commeth as much diſpleaſure to vs, beeing ill willed of thoſe the Prince doth eſteeme and fauour: as there doth by the princes owne indignation that raigneth ouet vs: For that wee talke of princes, commeth not all to his eares (and but ſeldome) vnleſſe the matter bee ſlaunderous, and offenſiue to his Maieſty. But to the contrary, wee no ſooner ſpeake of thoſe that bee in fauour, and beloued of the prince, but they are not onely with ſpeede aduertiſed what was ſpokē of them: but they further deuine, what wee thought of them.
                     Therfore my friend Courtyer, ſith it lyeth not in thee to diminiſh or impaire his credite, that is in fauour with the Prince, and beloued in the Court: neyther to diſplace his matters, and ſuites he taketh in hand and that thou haſt no authoritie to reforme and gouerne the Common-weale, nor to redreſſe the wrongs and iniuries receyued, I would wiſh thee to followe my counſell.
                     If thou ſpye the faultes and imperfections of the Court that thou rather ſuffer &amp; abide them, in keeping them ſecret: then to ſeem to reproue them openly, when thou ſeeſt Noble-Princes contented to diſſemble, and couer them priuily.
                     It is therefore the ſounder counſell to followe and ſerue thoſe that are in fauor and credite, then to purſue them in worde or deede.
                     And therefore the Courtyer muſt be very choyſe with whom he is familiar, to whom hee ſpeaketh, whom he Betweene words ſpokē &amp; the intēt with which they were ſpoken is great difference. truſteth: who heareth him, and of whō he receiueth all his intelligence.
                     For there is great difference between the words that are ſpoken, and the intent and meaning, with which they were ſpoken. For, the bowells and entrailes of Courtyers are ſo damnable, and their harts ſo crooked, and diuerted from the right path-way of bountie and goodneſſe, that the new and ignorant Courtyer ſhal think himſelfe much profited by their aduiſes, and admonitions, when indeede they ſhall but deceiue him: and ſhall think he was well counſelled, when he ſhall find himſelfe the moſt deceiued in the world, &amp; in greater anger then before.
                     
                        
There are ſom alſo ſo little contented with the Prince, and ſo ill recompenced for their ſeruice, that they are not onely not his friends, but they practiſe ſecretly to purchaſe him moe enemies.
                     And when the Courtier ſeeth, that bee that is in fauour and credit, doth It is beſt for the Courtier to bee 
                              〈◊〉
                            friendſhippe with all, if can poſſible. in deed ſtick cloſe with him vnfaynedlie, what need he care then, though all the reſt be his enemies. And the good Courtier muſt conſider, that he goeth not to the Court to reuenge iniuries, but onely to purchaſe honor and profit. To whom alſo I giue counſel, that hee be not enemy to him that is in fauour, nor friend to his enemie: and yet it ſhall bee beſt for him to bee friend to all, and enemy to none, if he can poſſible.
                     Whoſoeuer deſireth to bee well thought of in the Court, and to bee beloued of Courtiers, it is better for him to ſuffer iniuries done him, then he him ſelfe to bee a procurer of them to others. And for the iniuries, detractions and mutinings, that they ſhall rayſe againſt the fauoured of the Court, no man ought to truſt any other perſon then himſelfe, ſith that for the moſt part whom they do truſt (when hee ſhall haue neede of the good report, and credite of him that is in fauour with the Prince, thinking to doe him a peece of great ſeruice) he he ſhall not care to vnfolde to him, euen the bottome of his friends ſecrets, which were cōmitted to him in great ſecreſie.
                     Hee muſt alſo conſider that hee cannot poſſibly in a ſhort time growe in fauour with the Prince, nor come alſo to be accepted for a friend of him that is in fauour about the Prince: but the ſooner to haſten his good fortune, hee muſt acquaint himſelfe throughly with the Officers and ſeruants of the beloued, &amp; do them a thouſand pleaſures dayly, as well in courteous words as in ſeruing their turns alſo with money or iewels, preſenting them euer with ſome prety ſmal token from him, to haue him in mind, and to remember him to their maſters: for the true order of this diſorder, is in effect to be rather friend to their ſeruants, then familiar or beloued with their maſters that are in ſo great fauour: hee muſt alſo bee informed, which of his Seruants (that is in eſtimation with the Prince) is in beſt credit with his Maſter, and him hee muſt ſeeke to make his friend aboue all other his fellows: for euen as the Prince hath a ſeruant whom hee loueth, that leades him altogether: There is no man, but giues more credit to one then another. euen ſo likewiſe hath the fauoured Courtier, a ſeruant about him that commaundeth him. There is no will ſo free &amp; liberall, neyther any lord ſo high and abſolute, nor Iudge ſo vpright a Iuſticer, but in the end, hee giueth more truſt and credite to one, then to another.
                     And hereof proceeds moſt commonly, that wee loue not thoſe wee ought to loue, but thoſe whom we fanſie moſt. Now therefore following our entent, touching the viſitation of the Courtiers, hee muſt lay watch and conſider well to procure knowledge: Firſt, if any ſuch Noble men, or other his friends, which hee hath denotion to viſite, bee occupied, or withdrawne to their bedde-Chambers, for ſome priuate buſineſſe of theirs: for if it were ſo, they would rather thinke he came to trouble them, then to viſite them.
                     And therefore hee that is wiſe, in viſiting his friends, may not bee too importune vpon them, to preaſe into their bedde-chamber, neyther to be too tedious and vnpleaſant in his wordes. There are ſome ſo ſolitarie, that would neuer be viſited, &amp; others, that deſires to be viſited euery day: Others there bee, that would the viſitation ſhould bee ſhort: Others,

that take pleaſure to heare a long diſcours, that hee would his Tale ſhould neuer be ended, So that the Courtyer muſt look into the natures of men, and ſo to frame his viſitations, according to the conditions of their minde: and to remember his viſitations to great graue men, bee not ſo ofte, and daily that they be troubleſom to him, nor ſo ſeldome, that they may thinke them ſtrangers, and that they had forgotten him.
                     That onely deſerueth the name of a true viſitation, where the perſon viſited, Wherein true viſitation of our betters or friends conſiſteth. may not bee troubled with importunacie: nor the viſiter may diminiſh any part of his credit and eſtimation, and alſo that he preiudice not his owne commoditie in his affayres.
                     I ſpeake it for ſome, that are ſo troubleſome in their viſitations, and ſo fooliſh and tedious in their words, not knowing howe to make an ende: that we may better call them troubleſome, enuious, and impudent, then honeſt viſiters, and faithfull true friends.
                     And therefore wee ſhould leaue them ſo contented we viſite, that they ſhould rather bee angrie to looſe our company, then that they ſhould complaine of our importunitie: giuing them rather occaſion to meete vs with a pleaſaunt countenaunce (when wee enter into their houſe, then to make them hide themſelues, or flye from vs, when they ſee vs) and ſay they are not within.
                     And mee thinks indeed where we haue not great and ſtraight Friendſhip, or elſe ſome affayres of great importaunce, that toucheth vs much, it ſhould bee ſufficient to viſite our friendes and acquaintance, once in a moneth: and where they would ſee more oftner, let vs tarry till they complaine and finde fault, and ſend to vs, to let vs vnderſtand it, and not that we be ſo ready to come to offer and preſent our ſelues vnto them, vnleſſe the neceſſitie of our cauſe doe vrge vs. There are ſome perſons ſo vndiſcreet in being viſited, that when others doe come to ſee them, eyther they make The indiſcretion of ſome that are viſited. the gates to bee ſhut vpon them, or they cauſe their ſeruants to ſay, they are nor within, or elſe they get them out at the backe dore, or they faine that they are a little acraſed, onely to auoide and flye from theſe troubleſom and babling viſiters: So that they had rather ſee a Sargeant enter into their houſe to arreſt them for debt, then to be cumbred with theſe lothſome and prating viſiters.
                     Alſo it is not fit to goe ſee theyr friends at vnlawfull howers, as about dinner or ſupper time: for thoſe that are viſited, will rather thinke they come to dine or ſupp with them, then of eurteſie and good will to ſee them: It hapneth ſometimes, that many are braue and rich in apparrell, that keepe but a poore and meane ordinary at their Table, ſparing from their mouth to lay it vpon their backs: and therefore they are very loath and offended that any of their friendes or familiars ſhould take them at meales to iudge of them: for they thinke it leſſe paine to faſt from meat ſecretly, then that their ſcarſity ſhould openly be diſcouered:
                     Alſo the Lawes of honeſty and ciuility doe not permit any man to enter into the houſe, hall or chamber of an other, without knocking, or calling firſt at the dore: for that onely priuiledge to come in the houſe ſuddenly, and ſpeake neuer a word, belongeth to the Husband or Maſter of the houſe.
                     Alſo it is not good to goe ſee his friend when he is at play, for if he be a loſer, it cannot be but he will chafe, &amp; be in choler, in his mind with his frend to come then to trouble him, &amp; to let him of his play: and if happly he were

a winner before his friend came to ſee him: and afterwards chance to bee a loſer againe: hee will lay, the occaſion of his loſſe vpon his friend that came of good will to ſee him, and ſay that he turned his good lucke away from him, and that hee came but to trouble him, taking it rather for an offence and iniury done him, then for any good loue or duety ſhewed him.
                     If our friend in like maner whom we go to viſite, come out of his chamber to receiue vs, not bidding vs come into the Chamber, nor to ſit downe, but ſtanding to talke with vs, without any other curteſie or entertainement, wee may eaſily perceyue by this his manner of entertainement that hee giueth vs good and honeſt leaue to depart when we will.
                     The Wiſe and fine Courtier, will as eaſily finde and vnderſtand him by his ſignes, as hee will doe ſomtimes by his words,
                     Alſo the Courtier muſt take great The diſcretion the Courtyer is to vſe in his curteſie. heede, that in ſeeming to vſe courteſie hee happen not to make ſome fooliſh countenance in pulling off his cappe, in making courteſie, comming into the Hall, or taking a ſtoole to ſitte downe, leſt hee bee therefore marked and mocked of the ſtanders by, or noted for proud or preſumptuous, for to ſtay or let at theſe Trifles, a man rather getteth the name of a glorious, light, and proud, then of a graue and ſober man.
                     All things touching conſcience, ciuility and honour, the good Cour, tier ſhould alwayes haue in memorie, and before his eyes, when hee ſhall diſcourſe with his Lord, or viſite his friend. And for the firſt beginning of his diſcourſe, and talke with him, (after they are ſet downe together) he muſt aske him how his body doth, and whether all his houſe be merry &amp; in good health: for it is the thing that wee muſt firſt procure for our owne priuate commodity: and ſecondly, deſire it for our friends.
                     Alſo in the Courtyers viſitations hee may not be too curious, or inquiſitiue of newes, neyther ouer-buſie to tell newes: for after his Friend were once aduertized of the truth, it might be lightly, hee would thanke him for his comming, and commend him for his courteſie: and not-withſtanding blame him for his newes, and count him a Lyar.
                     And if it happen we finde the party whom we viſite, ſad, comfortles, and in ſome neceſſitie: although hee were not our Friend, yet for that hee is a Chriſtian, wee ought to comfort him with words, and to ſeeke alſo to helpe and relieue him with ſomewhat.
                     
                        Lycurgus in his Lawes he made and ordained, that it ſhould not be lawfull for any man to come to ſee a priſoner, but he ſhould help to deliuer him: nor any poore man, but he ſhould relieue him: nor any ſicke or diſeaſed perſon, but he ſhold helpe and comfort him, to his able power.
                     And truly me thinkes Lycurgus had great reaſon to make this Law: ſince One gyft in neceſſitie is better then a thouſand words. we ſee that in experience, that a mans minde, for one onely thing that is giuen him, is better contented and ſatiſfied, then with a thouſand words that they can ſpeake vnto him.
                     And if his houſe whom they goe to viſite, and where hee dwelleth, bee his owne inheritance, and Fee-ſimple: or that hee hath it by Leaſe, or purchaſe, or that hee hath builded it out of the ground: or if he haue repaired, or new coated it: the Courtyer muſt pray him to let him ſee it, and when hee hath ſeene it, hee muſt greatly commend it to him: for all mortall men haue this common-fault and humour, that they muſt be praiſed for their doings, and not reproued for theyr faults.
                     Further, if they viſite any ſicke perſon, they muſt remember they ſpeake

but little vnto him, and that but ſoftelie, and in pleaſaunt matters, &amp;c: for otherwiſe it ſhould ſeeme (and they wil alſo beleeue) he came to ſee him, rather to aggrauate his ſicknes more, then to comfort him.
                     Wee muſt euer make ſhort viſitations, not onely with the ſicke and diſeaſed, but the whole and found. And then the good Courtier muſt take his leaue of them, when hee is euen in his moſt pleaſant diſcourſe, to the end, they may intreateth him to tarry longer, and not to tarry till they ſeeme to licence him, by outwarde ſignes and ceremonies, and hee that ſhall goe viſite another, let him take heed hee bee not ſo long and tedious in his talke, that the perſon whom hee viſiteth doe riſe before him: For it were too plaine a token hee were wearie of his company, and long tarrying, ſith he roſe before him to giue him ocaſion to depart.
                     If his wife whom hee viſiteth bee not a ſiſter, or kinſwomā of the Courtiers that viſites him, or that they bee not of very familiar acquintance together, hee ſhould not once ſeeme to aske for her, much leſſe to deſire to ſee her. For as Scipio ſayth, A man ſhould not truſt any to ſee his Wife, Two things which a mā ſhould not truſt any with. nor to proue his ſword.
                     It is alſo a cuſtome vſed among Courtiers, that when they goe to any mans houſe to ſee him, before they light off their horſe, they ſend to know whether he be within or no.
                     And when the Courtier taketh his leaue of him he hath viſited, hee muſt not ſuffer the Gentleman for to bring him out of his Chamber to accompany him, much leſſe to come downe the ſtayres with him: which if hee vſe in this manner, the other ſhall bee bound to thanke him for his comming, and ſhall commend him for his ciuility.
                     And if it happen when wee goe to viſite ſome Noble man, or other beloued of the Court at his lodging: and that at our comming hee is ready to com out of his houſe to ride abroad in the fieldes to take ayre, or to ride vnto the Courte, for to ſolicite ſome of his affayres: or to ride abroade in the towne for his pleaſure, the diligent Courtier muſt willingly accompany him, and offer him all the ſeruice hee can: and ſo hee ſhall deſerue double thankes of him, the one for his comming, and the other for his gentle offer and company.
                     To viſite the Princes ſeruants, it is not the manner (for that they are alwaies occupied in the Princes ſeruice) neyther ſhall they haue ſuch time of leyſure as other haue. And becauſe they haue no time commodious to ſee them at home at their owne houſes, yet at the leaſt the good Courtier muſt needes accompany them at times when they goe abroade. For there is more reaſon the eſteemed Courtier ſhould make more of him that accompanieth him, then of the other that is too importunate and troubleſome to him.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VII. Of the good countenance and modeſty the Courtier ſhould haue, in behauing himſelfe at the Prince or Noble mans Table in the time of his meale.
                     
                     
                        THoſe that are abiding ſtill in Princes A cuſtome wherein the Courtier may lauiſh hia reputation. Courts, muſt in any caſe goe ſeldome or not at all abroade to others Tables, but alwayes to keepe their owne. For that Courtier that

runneth from Table to Table, to eate of others coſt, to haue his meate free, is not ſo ſparing of his purſe, as hee is too prodigall and lauiſh of his good reputation.
                     Therefore Eſchines the Philoſopher being demaunded one day what a man ſhould do to be counted good he anſwered thus: To become a perfect Greeke, he muſt go to the church willingly, and of good deuotion, and to the warres of neceſſity, but to feaſts and banquets, neyther of will, nor of neceſſity, vnleſſe it be to doe them honour and pleaſure that doe inuite thee.
                     
                        Suetonius Tranquillus writeth that the Emperour Auguſtus prohibited in Rome, that no man ſhould enuite each other to feaſt or banquet with an other: but if his friend would do him that honour to come to his feaſt, that then he ſhould ſend him home to his houſe, of that meat hee ſhould haue 
                           •
                        ad at the feaſt, and banquet with them at their houſes.
                     And when he was asked of certain of his friends, what he meant to make this Law, he gaue them this anſwere: The cauſe that moued mee, good friend, to forbidd playes and banquets in Rome was, becauſe in play, no man kept himſelfe from ſwearing, and terrible blaſpheming the name of God: and in banquets euery man is giuen to de
                           •
                        ect and defame his neighbour.
                     
                        Cicero recounteth of Cato the Cenſor, that he lying on his death bed: at the mercy of God, ſhould ſay theſe words: Foure things I remember I haue done in my life, wherein I haue rather ſhewed my ſelfe a voluptuous, and negligent Barbarian, then a wiſe and good Romane Citizen, for the which I find my ſelfe ſore grieued.
                     The firſt is this, For that I ſpent a whole day, and forgot to ſerue the Gods, and did not profite my common Wealth in any thing, which I ſhould neuer haue done: For it is as great a diſhonor for a Philoſopher to be counted an idle and negligent perſon, as it is for a noble heart to bee counted a ranke coward.
                     The ſecond is, for that ſafely I might once haue gone by land, and perillouſly When a wiſe man may put himſelfe in perill. I hazarded my ſelfe vpon the water. A thing which well I ſhould haue let alone: for neuer no wiſe man ſhould euer haue put himſelf into perill, vnleſſe it were only for the ſeruice of the Gods, for the increaſe of his honour, or for the defence of his Country.
                     The third is, that I opened once a great ſecret, and matter of importance to a woman, which I ought leſſe to haue done then all the reſt: For in graue matters, and things of counſel. there is no woman capable to giue counſell, and much leſſe to take it, and leaſt of all to keepe it ſecret.
                     The fourth was, that another time I was contented to be ouercome by a friend of mine, that earneſtly inuited me to his houſe to dinner, and thereupon I went with him, which I ſhould not haue done: for to ſay the truth, there was neuer famous nor worthie perſon that went to eate in an other mans houſe, but that hee diminiſhed his liberty, hazarding alſo his grauity and reputation to the rumour and brute of others.
                     The which wordes being ſo wiſely ſpoken by the prudent Cato, were well worthy to bee noted and carried away, and ſo much the more, that being now drawing to his laſt home, &amp; euen in his laſt breathing hower, hee onely ſpake of theſe foure things, and no more: whereof, although hee were a Romane, yet he ſhewed to vs a repenting mind.
                     But woe is mee, that albeit I doe beare the name of a Chriſtian, yea, &amp; and that I am ſo indeed, yet in that laſt

day when Nature ſummons mee: I feare me, and belieue aſſuredly, I ſhall haue cauſe to repent me, of more then foure things.
                     Now by theſe things heretofore recyted wee may eaſily coniecture, that albeit wee are contented to be entreated and requeſted in many things, yet in this onely to goe to others tables to feaſt, and in ſtrange houſes, we ſhould not bee intreated, but rather compelled and againſt our wills.
                     And where the Courtyer is forced by importunacie to accept the bidding, How hee that is biddē to a feaſt may purchaſe thāk
                              •
                            of the bidder. without offering himſelfe before, hee deſerueth as great thankes of the bidder for his comming, as the other did in bidding him. For if it ſhould not be ſo, it ſhould ſeeme rather a dinner for ſtaungers, that trauell by the way, then for Noblemen and Gentlemen, that come from the Court.
                     For that day the Courtyer graunteth to dyne with any man, the ſame day hee bindeth himſelfe to be beholding to him that bids him: for although he come to him of good will, yet to acquite his courteſie done him, hee is bound of neceſſitie.
                     Alſo it is a ſmall reputation, (and worthy great reproche) that a Courtyer make his boaſt he hath eaten at all the Tables and Officers bordes in the Court, and no man can ſay hee hath once beene at dinner or ſupper with him at his owne houſe.
                     And truly I remember I knew once a Courtyer that might diſpende aboue two hundred Ducates by the yeare, who told mee, and aſſured me he neuer bought ſticke of wood, to warme him within his chamber, nor Pot to ſeeth his meate in, neither ſpit to roaſt with all, nor that euer hee had any Cater for his prouiſion, ſaue only that he had made a regiſter of many Noblemens bords: amongſt whom he equally deuided his dinners and ſuppers. By meanes whereof hee ſaued all his charges, ſaue onely his mens Boordewages.
                     But what vileneſſe or diſcurteſie could equall the miſerie and ſhame of this careleſſe Courtyer? Sure not that of the meaneſt and pooreſt Slaue of the world, that liueth only by his hire: No, it deſerueth not to be compared To what ende wee ſhould deſire riches. vnto it. For, to what ende deſire wee the goods of this world, but that by them we may be honored, relieue our Parents and Kinſmen, and thereby alſo win vs new Friends? what ſtate or condition ſoeuer hee be of, that hath ynough and aboundance, wee are not bound to eſteem the more of him for that, nor to do him the more honour, but onely for that he ſpendeth it well, and worſhipfully, and for his honour, if hee be honourable.
                     And this we ſpeake of Gentlemen, as of Cittizens. And he that in Court makes profeſſion to Dine at othermens Tables, I dare vndertake if they dine betimes on the Holliday, hee will rather loſe Seruice in the morning, then Dinner at noone. And if any Friend come to lye with theſe ſort of Courtyers, and that hee be but newly come the Court, ſtraight-wayes he will haue him with him to dinner: and bring him to ſalute the Gentleman, where he dines that day, ſaying: That hee was bolde, to bring his Kinſman and Friend with him, to ſalute him: And all this is not ſo much, to bring him acquainted with him, as it is to ſpare his meate at home for them both.
                     And yet they haue an other knacke of Court finer then this: They flatter the Pages and Seruants, becauſe they ſhold euer giue them of the beſt wine at the Table: and with certaine familiar nods, and ſweete wordes, they entertaine the Lords, Shewers, and Caruers, and make much of them: that they ſhould ſet before them full diſhes and of the beſt and daintieſt meate.
                     There are alſo ſome of theſe Courtiers,

that to be well wayted vpon at the fable, and to make them his friends, doe ſometimes preſent the Steward with a veluet capp, the ſhewers with a payre of waſhed or perfumed gloues, the Pages with a ſwordgirdle: and the Butlers or Cupbordkeepers with ſome other prety reward or deuiſe.
                     And it chanceth often times in noble mens houſes, that there are ſo many gueſts to dine and ſuppe with him dayly, that many times the boord will not holde them all by a great number; which when they once perceyue, to ſee how quickly, and with what ſpeed the Courtiers take their places to ſet them downe, and to be ſure of a roome: It is a world to ſee it.
                     But oh, I would to God, they were Many not 
                              〈◊〉
                            to ſerue God, as their own bellies. ſo happy and diligent to goe to the Church, and heare a Sermon, as they are buſie to get them ſtooles, to ſit at the Table.
                     And if perhaps a Courtier come late, and that the Table bee all ready full, and the lurch out, yet hee will not bee aſhamed to eate his meate neuertheleſſe: For albeit hee cannot bee placed at his eaſe, yet he is ſo bold and ſhameleſſe, that rather then faile, hee will ſit of halfe a buttocke, or behind one at the Table.
                     I remember I ſaw once at a Noblemans Table, three Courtiers ſitt vpon one ſtoole, like the foure ſonnes of Amon, and when I rebuked them for it, and tolde them it was a ſhame for them: They aunſwered me merily againe, that they did it, not for that there wanted ſtooles, but to proue if neede were, if one ſtoole would holde them three.
                     Such may well bee called greedie gluttons, and ſhameleſſe proulers, without reſpect or honeſty, that when they are dead, would bee buried in the higheſt place of the Church: &amp; when they are aliue, little force at whoſe table they ſit, or how they ſitt, little regarding their honor or eſtate.
                     Truely, for him, that is poore and needy, to ſeeke his meate and drinke, where he may come by it beſt: it is but meete: but for the gorgeous Courtier, bedeckt with gold, buttoned and be iewelled, ietting in his veluets, and ſilkes, to begge and ſeeke his dinner dayly at euery mans boord, being nobly and honourably entertayned of the prince, and able to beare his coū
                        tenance: what reproch, defame, and diſhonour is it to him?
                     Hee that vſeth dayly to runne to How he is welcome that is a common runner to other mens Tables. other mens Tables, is oft times forced to ſit loweſt at the boord vpon a broken ſtoole, and to be ſerued with a ruſty knife, to eate in foule diſhes, &amp; to drinke for a change hote water, and wine, more then halfe full of Water: and to eate hore bread, and that that of all others yet is worſt of all, euery one of the ſeruants lookes ouer theyr ſhoulder on him, and are angry with him in their minds.
                     Truely, hee that with thoſe conditions goeth abroad to ſeeke his dinner, were better in my opinion, to faſt with bread &amp; water at home, then to fil his belly abroad. But ſuch mēs reward, that haunts mens houſes in this manner, is this in the end, that the Noblemen to whoſe houſes they come to, are offended with them, the Stewards of the houſe murmur at them, the pages and ſeruants mockes them, and laughes them to ſcorne: The Taſters and Cup-bearers chafe with them in their mindes: The Cupborde keepers wonder at them, the Clerkes of the Kitchin thinkes them importunate and ſhameleſſe creatures. Wherfore it followeth (whoſoeuer will obſerue it) that ſo ſoone as the ſeruantes once ſee him come into the dining Chamber, ſome of them hides the ſtoole where hee would ſit downe, others ſet before him the worſt meat of

the boord, and the filthieſt diſhes they haue: and therfore he that may haue at home at his houſe, his poore little pittance well dreſt, a faire white Table cloath, a bright knife, new and white bread, wood and candle in the winter and other neceſſaries: if he like better to goe from Table to Table, from kitchen to kitchen, and from one Butterie to another, I will ſuppoſe hee doth it for great ſpare and hardineſſe, or for want of honeſty and good maners.
                     Now hee that keepes an Ordinary houſe, and remaines alwayes at home, may dine if it bee in the ſummer ſeaſon, in his ſhirr, if hee liſt, hee may ſit when hee will, and where it pleaſeth him, he drinkes his wine freſh, and hath the flyes driuen from his Table with the ventola, hee diſdayneth the Court and Noble mens boordes, keeping his owne as f
                           •
                        anke and as ſparing as hee liſt, and no man to gaineſay him: yea and after meate hee is at libertie to ſit ſtill, and take his eaſe, or to walke abrode in the ſhade as he wil. And in Winter if perhaps he be wet, he ſtraight ſhifts him, and changes all his cloathes, gets him a furred Nightgown on the backe of him, and a paire of warme ſlippers, to heate his colde ſeet withall: he eats his meat warme and ſmoking hote, and takes that hee likes beſt: he drinkes white wine, red wine, or claret-wine, as he thinks beſt, and needs neuer to care for them that behold him.
                     And therefore ſo great priuiledges as thoſe bee of libertie, the Courtyer ſhould neuer refuſe to buye them for his money much leſſe for the gaine of a meales meate he ſhould leaue to enioy them, &amp;c.
                     But if the Courtyer will needes determine to viſite Noble-mens-bords, hee muſt bee very warie that incomming to a Noble-mans Table, hee doe not ſo much commend his Fare and Ordinarie, that he complaine of other mens Tables where he hath ſed. For, How he is to demeane himſelf, that will viſite noble means Table. it is a kinde of Treaſon to defame and ſlaunder thoſe, whoſe houſes they are wont to viſite oft.
                     And when hee is ſet at the Table, the Courtier muſt behaue himſelfe modeſtly, hee muſt eate temperately, and finely, hee muſt alay his wine with water, and ſpeake but little: ſo that thoſe that are preſent cannot but praiſe him for his Temperancie and ſober dyet, but alſo for his wiſedome and moderate ſpeeche.
                     To feede mannerly is to be vnder ſtood, not to blow his noſe in his napkin, nor to leane his elbows vppon the Table: not to eate to leaue nothing in the diſh, not to finde faultes with the Cookes, ſaying: The meate is not enough, or not well dreſſed For, it were a great ſhame for the Courtyer to bee noted of the wayters, to be a bellygut, and to be counted a groſſe-feeder.
                     There are ſome alſo that make themſelues ſo familiar, and homely in the houſe, that they are not contented with that is ſerued them in the Diſhe, but ſhamefully they plucke that vnto them that is left in other diſhes: ſo that they are eſtemed for ieaſters, no leſſe ſawcie then malepert in their order, then infatiable in their beaſtly eating
                     The good Courtyer muſt alſo take heede hee lay not his armes too farre on the Table, nor that hee make any any noyſe with his teeth, nor tongue, nor ſmacke with his mouth when hee eateth, and that he drinke not with both his hands on the cuppe, nor caſt his eyes too much vpon the beſt diſhes, that he knaw nor teare his bread with his teeth, that hee licke not his fingers, nor haue done eating before others, nor to haue too greedy an appetite to the meate or ſauce hee eates, and that in drinking hee gulpe not with his throate. For ſuch manner

of Feeding, rather be commeth an Ale-houſe, then a Noblemans-Table. And although the Courtyer can not go ouer all the Diſhes that comes to the boord, yet at leaſt let him proue a little of euery one, and then hee muſt praiſe the good cookry, and fine dreſſing of them all. For commonly the Noble-men and Gentlemen that inuite Many loue to haue their cheere and attendance commended. any to their boord, take it vncurteouſly and are aſhamed, if the inuited praiſe not their meate and drinke they giue them, and not onely the noble men are aſhamed of it, but alſo the other Officers that haue the charge to ſee it well dreſſed, and in good order.
                     Alwayes hee that eateth at an other mans table, to doe as he ought ſhould praiſe the worthineſſe of him that bad him, (yea though perhaps hee made a lie) and commend the great care and diligence of his Officers in furniſhing his Table with ſo good meates, and in ſetting it forth in ſo good order.
                     I ſay not without a cauſe, that ſometime a praiſe with a lye may well ſtand together, ſince wee ſee ſome Noblemens Tables ſo ſlenderly furniſhed, and that his Ordinarie ſhould ſeeme rather a Preparatiue ſupper and dyet, for a ſickeman, that meanes to take phyſicke in the next morning, then an Ordinary, or dinner for Eaſter-day.
                     
                     And therefore (I ſay) that right the Lordes and Maſters are pleaſed, when they heare their Officers and Seruants commended. For they chooſe moſte comonly ſuch a Steward as they know to be wiſe, and curteous of nature: a Treaſurer true and faithfull: a Purueyer, expert and diligent: a Butler, haſty and Melancholie: the Groome of his chamber, painfull &amp; truſty: his Secretarie, wiſe and ſecrete: his Chaplaine ſimple: and his Cooke, fine and curious.
                     For manie thinke it more glorie to haue an excellent cooke in their houſe, then to haue a valiant Captain, to keepe a ſtrong place or holde. They are contented in Courte that Noblemens-chapleins be rather ſimple then otherwiſe, or well-learned. For if if he reade but little, he hath the ſooner ſaid ſeruice, and therfore alſo is more ſit to dredge and doe ſeruice about the houſe.
                     Now therfore continuing our begunne purpoſe, the Courtier that eateth at other mens Tables, muſt ſee hee drinke little, and that his wine be well delayed with water.
                     For wine tempered with water bringeth Wine tempered with water bringth 2. commodities. two commodities: the one, it makes him ſober that drinkes it, and ſhall not bee ouerſeene, the other, he ſhall not diſtemper himſelfe, that the wayters haue any occaſion to laugh at him. If he ſhould hap ſomtimes that he found the wine wel watered before, that it had ſtood a pawling long, or that it were ſomewhat ſharpe or ſower, or that the water weree too hote: the good Courtier ſhould not therefore immediately complaine and find fault at the table, for ſo hee ſhould ſhame the ſeruants, and make them angry with him, &amp; alſo diſpleaſe their maſter.
                     Truely, it is a griefe to ſuffer it; to ſee that he that hath nothing at home in his own houſe, eyther to eate or drink, will yet looke to bee well vſed at an other mans houſe: and is neuer ſatiſfied. I ſpeake it for certain, vndiſcreet Courtiers, and wanting iudgement, that being at any mans boorde (without any ſhame) dare diſprayſe the Cookes, and ſpeake ill of them, if perhaps the taſte of their pottage and meate miſlike them, and that it be not good, and acording to their appetite: And of the Butlers, if the wine be not colde and freſh: Of thoſe that waight about: if euery thing they call for, be not done at a becke and quickly, of the Stewards of the houſe, if they bee not ſerued immediately: and of the boies and Pages, if they giue them not drinke ſuddenly: Of the Caruers, if

they carue them not to their liking: and alſo with the Clerkes of the Kitchen, if they ſee them not ſerued with meate inough, that there bee inough left vpon the table. So that the Noble mens officers (for the more part) haue more trouble and diſpleaſure, by the diſcontentation of thoſe that come to their Maſters Table, then they haue by the euil words their Maſters ſpeake to them. And for this reſpect therefore no man ought to be ſo bolde, as once to open his lippes to complaine No man ought to complaine of want at anothers table. of any want in an others mans houſe, as if they ſerue him with Claret wine, rather then with white: or with white then claret: For a right and perfect Courtier ſhould not ſet his appetite in the taſt or variety of wines, or meats in an others houſe.
                     I graunt that it is very fit and lawfull for young Courtiers to runne wel, to leape farre, to throw the barre of Iron, to daunce well, to ride a horſe well, to manage, and giue him his carrere well, and to turne well, to handle his weapon well, and to breake a ſtaffe well, and otherwiſe to helpe himſelfe with all manner of weapons: but for one to defie another in drinkking, it ſhould be a great ſacriledge of the Courtier.
                     The Scithiens as ratifieth Trogus Pompeins, were ſo ſober and modeſt in eating &amp; drinking at their meales, that it was a foule fault among them for to breake winde or belch.
                     And therefore now a dayes, wee finde few Scithiens, but many drinkers, which depart from the Feaſt ſo ſull fraught, as immediatly when they are come home, they vnlode their charged ſtomacke, and lay open all that haue eaten and drunken: wherefore hee that vſeth to drinke cleane and pure water, is at more liberty thē thoſe that drinke wine ſimply without compound: for exceſſiue drinking of wine, doth not alone trouble and diſtemper the braine and iudgement of the drinker: but further diſcouereth to you great and horrible vices. Therfore yet touching our matter, I ſay once againe that it is fond to diſpute an argument, to proue which of the wines were beſt, pleaſant and moſt ſweeteſt, and which is oldeſt or neweſt, ſharpe or harde, ſoft or ſweet, cleareſt or darkeſt, or of beſt taſt or quickeſt ſauour. For to iudge of the taſte of wines, and to know the goodnes &amp; perfection of it, rather (to ſay truely) belongeth to a Tauerner or Vintner, then rightly to an honeſt Courtier. And it is fitter, and more decent alſo for him, to talke of arms and chiualry, then to deale in diſcourſe of Bacchus feaſts, what a mockery &amp; fooliſh niceneſſe is it of him, that not only drinks water alone, but alſo cannot drinke in that cuppe, where there hath beene wine filled before.
                     He ſhall alſo bee very circumſpect that is bidden to a ſtrāgers houſe, that hee drinke not ſo deepe at a draught, that hee leaue nothing in the cuppe, neyther that he drinke ſo long as hee hath breath, and the water ſtand in his eyes againe: For the graue and ſober Courtier ſhould neuer drinke till hee might no more, nor till there were none leſt.
                     And when hee is at the Table, hee ſhould not enter in argument, &amp; diſpute with any, neyther ſhould hee bee obſtinat in opinion, &amp; much leſſe vſe vncomly talke, and he muſt alſo bridle nature much, that he cry not out in in laughing, as ſome doe: for like as it ſoundeth to his reproch, to be noted a glutton and drunkard, it is in like caſe far worſe to be a foole and a Ieſter. Alſo it preuaileth litle that a courtier bee moderat &amp; honeſt in eating, if hee be What talke ſhould bee vſed at the Table. diſhoneſt and inſolent in his talke: for many times it hapneth at noble mens table, that they take more pleaſure in ſome, then in other ſome, not to ſee them eate and drinke well, but to

heare them tell lies, and to be pleaſant at the boorde. Therefore as we haue ſayde, the wiſe Courtier ſhould praiſe and commend all that hee ſeeth ſerued at another mans table, and it is not lawfull for him to diſlike or diſprayſe it.
                     And further becauſe hee is fedd at an other mans charge, he muſt of neceſſity take all in worth that is giuen him, and ſet before him, and not to looke to haue that that he deſireth. And when there is any queſtion moued at the table, of the beſt and moſt delicate diſhes, and of the ſineſt Cookes, &amp; of the new kinds of broths and ſawces, and from whence the fatteſt Capons come, it ſhall not be fitte for the wiſe Courtier to ſay in that all that he knoweth and vnderſtandeth: For how much honour it is for him to bee able to talke in martiall feates or chiualy: ſo much more diſhonor and reproch it is to him, to be skilfull in dreſſing of meates, and all to fill the belly.
                     I remember that being one day at a Biſhops boord, I heard a Knight make great boaſt and vaunt, that hee coulde make ſeuen manner of fricaſies, foure kindes of Pyes, twelue ſorts of ſawces, and ten of fruit tartes, and twelue diuers wayes to dreſſe egges: but for to heare him tel theſe tidings, was not to bee accounted of ſo much, as the geſtures and countenances he made in telling them: For he did liuely ſhew with his hands the preſent making of them, the eating of them, &amp; the right taſting of them with his tongue.
                     And becauſe it happneth many times that in ſome Noble mans houſe, there is not like fare and entertainement that an other hath, the ciuill Courtier To whoſe table it is beſt for a feaſt hanter to reſort. ſhould not be ſo diſhoneſt as to make report hee leaueth the Noble mans Table, to goe to an others that is better ſerued. For the worthy courtier ſhould not haunt that Table where he fareth beſt, but where he findeth himſelfe beſt welcome, and eſteemed. Ah how many noble men and knights ſonnes are there, that ſpare not to goe to any mans boord for his meate and drinke, yea, though it fall out they bee their fathers enemies: and they doe it not in reſpect to reconcile them, and their fathers together, but rather for a good meales meat, or more aptly to ſay, to fill their bellies with dainties.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VIII. what company the Courtier ſhould keepe, and how bee ſhould apparrell himſelfe,
                     
                     
                        THe wiſe Courtier both in court, and out of court, and in all places where hee commeth, muſt take great regard hee accompany Ill company loſeth a mans credit. with none but with wiſe and vertuous men. For if hee doe not, hee cannot winne nor acquire ſuch honour by his well doing, as he ſhall loſe his credit, by keeping ill company.
                     And therefore hee ſhall inforce himſelfe alwayes to be in the preſence and company of vertuous and noble men, and ſhall conferre with the moſt graue, wiſe, and honeſt Gentlemen of the Court: For vſing this way, hee ſhall binde them to him, by reaſon of his dayly acceſſe to them, and he ſhall purchaſe himſelfe a good opinion of them, beſides the good example hee ſhal leaue to others to tread his ſteps, and ſollow his courſe. For what is more true, then when a young Gentleman commeth newly to the court, you ſhall ſee immediately a company of other young fooles, a company of

amarous ſquires, light and idle perſons a company of troubleſome Ieſters, and couetous praters, beſides other young frye in the Court, that when they know a new come Courtier, namely, (beeing, of great liuing) They will ſeeke to attend vpon him, and traine him to the lure of their affects and manner, bidding him to like of their qualities and conditions.
                     Wherefore cunningly to ſhake of the route of theſe needy, greedy retainers, he muſt altogether feede them with faire words, &amp; ſhew them good countenance, and yet notwithſtanding ſeeke by all policy he can to flye their fellowſhip and company.
                     Noble mens ſonnes, Knights ſons, Wherefore Noblemen, Knights &amp; Gentlemēs ſonnes are ſent to the Court. and Gentlemens ſonnes, may not thinke their friends ſendeth them to the Court, to learne new vices, and wicked practiſes, but to winne them new friends, and obtaine the acquaintance of noble men, whoſe credit &amp; eſtimation, with the Prince, may honour and countenance them, and by their vertues and meanes, may after a time bee brought into the Princes fauour, and dayly to riſe in credit and reputation amongſt others.
                     Therefore ſuch fathers as will ſend their children to the Court, vnleſſe they doe firſt admoniſh them well how they ought to behaue themſelus, or that they recommend them to the charge and ouerſight of ſome deare and eſpeciall friend of theirs, that will reproue them of their faults, when they doe amiſſe. I ſay they were better to lay yrons on their feet, and ſend them to Bedlam, or ſuch other like houſe where mad men bee kept. For if they bee bound there in yrons, it is but to bring them to their wittes againe, and to make them wiſe: but to ſend them to the Court looſe, and at liberty without guide, it is the next way to make them fooles, and worſe then madde men, aſſuring you, no greater daunger nor iniury can bee done to a young man, then to be ſent to the court, &amp; not committed to the charge of ſome one that ſhold take care of him, and looke ſtraightly to him. For otherwiſe it were impoſſible hee ſhould bee there many dayes, but hee muſt needes runne into exceſſe and foule diſorder, by the meanes whereof he ſhould vtterly caſt himſelfe away, and heape vpon theyr parents heads continuall curſes, and griefes, during their liues.
                     And therefore their Fathers, ſuppoſing after they haue once placed their ſonnes in the Court, that they ſhould no more carke nor care of them, nor reckon to inſtruct them, to bee wiſe and vertuous, finde when they come home to them againe, that they are laden withvices, ill complexioned, worſe apparrelled, their clothes all tattered and torne, hauing vainely and fondly ſpent, and played away their money, and worſt of all forſaken their Maſters, leauing them diſpleaſed with their ſeruice.
                     And of theſe I would admoniſh With whom the young Courtier ſhould accompanie himſelfe. the young Courtier, becauſe he muſt of neceſſity accompany with other yong men, that in no caſe he acquaint himſelfe with vitious and ill diſpoſed perſons, but with the honeſt, wiſe, and courteous: amongſt whom hee ſhall put vpon him a certaine graue, and ſtayed modeſty, fitting himſelfe onely to their companies, being alſo apt and diſpoſed to all honeſt and vertuous exerciſes, decent for a right Gentleman, and vertuous Courtier, ſhuning with his beſt policy, the light fooliſh, and vaine toyes of others.
                     And yet notwithſtanding this, my intent and meaning is, not for to ſeeme to perſwade or teach him, to become an hypocrite, but onely to bee courteous, honeſt, and well

beloued of other young Gentlemen: winning this reputation with all, to be eſteemed the moſt vertuous and honeſteſt among them, gallant and liuely in his diſports and paſtimes, of few words, &amp; ſmall conuerſation amongſt boſters and back-byters, or other wicked and naughtie perſons: not to bee ſad among thoſe that are merrie, nor dumme, among thoſe that talke wiſely, and of graue matters: nor to belieue hee ſhould be accounted a trim Courtyer, to take his book in his hands to pray,, when others will take the ball to play, or goe about ſome other honeſt recreations or paſtimes, for exerciſe of the bodie.
                     For, in ſo doing, they would rather take him for a Foole, and an Hypocrite, then for a vertuous and honeſt young man. Being good reaſon the childe ſhould vſe the pleaſures and paſtimes of a childe: young men diſportes and actes of youth: and olde men alſo, graue and wiſe recreations fit for them. For in the end, doe the beſt we can, wee cannot flye the motions of the Fleſh, wherein wee are What vices the young Courtyer ſhould eſchew. borne into this world.
                     Theſe young Gentle-men-Courtyers muſt take heede that they become not troubleſome, importunate, nor quarrellers: that they be no filchers, lyars, vacabonds, and ſlaunderers, nor any way giuen to vice.
                     As for other things, I would not ſeemeto take from them their paſtime and pleaſures, but that they may vſe them at their own diſcretion. And in all other things lawfull and irreprouable, obſeruing times and houres conuenient, and therewitall to accompanie themſelues with their fellowes and companions.
                     Alſo the young Courtyer that commeth newly to the Court, muſt of neceſſitie be very well apparelled, according to his degree and calling, and his ſeruants that follow him well appointed. For in Courte men regarde not onely the Houſe and familie hee commeth of, but marke alſo his Apparell, and ſeruants that follow him.
                     And I miſlike one thing very much, that about the Court they doe rather honour and reuerence a man, braue and ſumptuous in apparell being vitious, then they doe a man that is graue wiſe, and vertuous-And yet neuertheleſſe, the Courtyer may aſſure himſelfe of this, that few will eſteeme of him, eyther for that hee is vertouus or nobly borne, if hee be not alſo ſumptuouſly apparelled and well accompanied: for them onely will euery man account and eſteeme of him.
                     Wherefore I durſt take vpon mee to ſweare, if it were poſſible, to take oath of our bodyes, that they would ſweare they needed them not, much leſſe deſire ſo large compaſſed gowns, that euery puffe of winde might ſwell thē as the ſayles of a Ship: neyther ſo long that trayling on the ground, they gather duſt; and caſt it into our eyes.
                     Howbeit I thinke now-adayes theſe fine men weare them large and wide, and women long, with traynes vpon the ground: becauſe in the Court and elſe-where, no man makes reckning of him that ſpendeth but orderly, and onely vpon neceſſaries to goe cleanly withall: but him they ſet by, that is prodigall, exceſſiue, and ſuperfluous. And who that in his doings and apparell is moderate, and proceedeth wiſely, they holde him in Court for a miſerable and couetous mans and contrarily, hee that is prodigall and lauiſh in A meane ought to be vſed in apparell. expence, him they count a noble and worthy perſon. Albeit the Courtyer be come of a Noble houſe, and that he be yong of yeares, rich, and wealthie, yet would I like better hee ſhould vſe rather a certain mean and meaſure in his apparell (wearing that that is comely and Gentlemanlike) then others of moſt coſte and worſhip. For, like as they

would count him a foole for wearing that he could not pay for: ſo they likewiſe would thinke him ſimple, if hee ware not that that become him, and that he might eaſily come by.
                     His apparrell ſhould be agreeable with his yeares, that is to ſay, on the holy dayes ſome more richer and brauer then on the worke dayes: and in the Winter of the hoteſt furres: in the ſummer light garments of ſattin and damaske: and to ride with, ſome others of leſſer price and more durable: For as the wiſdome of man is knowne by his ſpeaking: ſo is his diſcretion decerned by his apparrell.
                     Let not the poore Courtier ſtudy to weare or deuiſe any new or ſtrange faſhioned garment, for if he be of that humour, he ſhall quickly vndoe himſelfe, and giue others occaſion alſo to follow his light and vaine inuention.
                     There are now a dayes found out ſo many ſtrange wayes to dreſſe meate, and ſo many faſhions and patterns of apparrell, that now they haue vniuerſities of Taylers and Cookes.
                     What more greater vanity and lightnes can there be then this? that they will not ſuffer the mothers gowns to be made fit for their daughters, ſaying that they are olde, and out of faſhion, and that they vſe now a new kinde of apparrell and attire farre from the old manner. And notwithſtanding thoſe gownes bee it a manner new, good, whole, cleane, rich, and well made, &amp; without weme, yet their daughters muſt needes haue new gownes at their Whence new faſhions in apparrell proceede. marriage. So that we may aptly ſay, that a new folly, ſeekes alwayes a new gowne, namely, when they are light perſons, without wit and diſcretion. And I pray you, is it not a goodly ſight in the Court, to ſee a fooliſh Courtier weare a demy cappe, ſcant to couer the crowne of his heade, to haue his beard merquizotted, a payre of perfumed gloues on his hands, his ſhooes cut after the beſt faſhion, a little curted cappe, his Hoſe fayre pulled out, his doublet ſleeues brauely cut and pinct, his rapier &amp; his dagger guilded by his ſide: and then on the other ſide, the peſtilence of penny he hath in his purſe, to bleſſe him with: and beſides he is deepe in the Marchants booke for all thoſe things hee hath taken vp of credit of him.
                     Their nagges foote clothes would not be ſo litle and narrow, that ſhould ſeeme a Fryers hood, neyther ſo great &amp; large as the foot cloths of Biſhops moyles.
                     Alſo the Courtier muſt ſee that his footcloth be good and whole, cleane, and without ſpot, not tattered and ſeame rent.
                     This we ſpeake, becauſe there are ſome miſerable Courtiers that haue Who may bee rightly termed a Courtier. their footclothes threed bare, broken and ſeeme rent, foule and durty, narrow, and all digged full of holes with ſpurres. And therefore no man deſerueth to be called a right Courtier, vnleſſe hee he fine and neate in his apparrell hee weareth, and alſo courteous and ciuill in his words and entertainement.
                     And yet touching the reſt of the furniture of their horſe or gelding, their harneſſe and trappes muſt bee kept blacke and cleane, and they muſt looke that the reines of the bridle bee not brokē nor vnſowed, which I ſpeak not without cauſe: for there are a number of Courtiers that at Primero will not ſticke to ſet vp a ieſt of a 100. or 200. crowns, and yet will think much to giue their poore horſekeepers 12. pence, to buy them a payre of reynes. And truly the Courtier (in my iudgement) that is content to tye his horſe with vntagged points, to ſee his fire ſmoke when hee ſhould warme them, to ride with broken reines, and to cut his meate at the table with a ruſty knife, I would thinke him baſe borne,

and rudely brought vp. When the Courtier will ride his horſe, let him looke euer before hee take his backe, that he haue all his furniture fitte for him, his maine and tayle finely combed, A good order for it 
                              〈◊〉
                            great noties. his ſtirroppes bright gliſtering, his ſtirrops leather ſtrong, and his ſaddle well ſtuffed, and aboue all, let him ſit vpright in his ſeate, and carry his body euen, ſwaruing of neyther ſide, holding his legges ſtill, and keepe his ſtirrop.
                     For this name to bee called Chiuallier (ſignifieth in our tongue a rider of a horſe) came firſt becauſe hee could ride and manage his horſe well. And when he would ſtirre his legges, to ſpurre his horſe, let him beware hee ſtoupe not forwardes with his body, and when he doth ſpurre his horſe let him not ſpurre him low, but hie in the flankes, and whether he will runne or ſtand ſtill with his horſe, let him alwayes haue his eye vpon the reines, that in no caſe the raines goe out of his hand.
                     And in giuing his horſe a carere, let him not writhe with his body, nor bee too buſie in beating or ſpurring his horſe oft: For in his carere, to know when to ſpurre him, when to giue him head, or to pull him backe againe, and to ſtoppe him. I haue ſeene many take it vpon them, but few indeed that euer were skilfull, &amp; coulde do it well.
                     Now the Courtier being mounted on horſe or moyle, without his rapier by his ſide, ſeemeth rather a Phyſitian that goeth to viſite his ſicke patients, then a Gentleman of the Court, that for his pleaſure and diſport rideth abroad throgh the ſtreets: and if he were by chance intreated by ſome noble man to accōpany him, or to ride behind him throgh the ſtreets: euery honeſt Courtier ought not only to doe it, but vnasked to be ready to offer himſelfe to waite vpon him, and 
                           •
                        o goe with him willingly.
                     And let the fine Courtier beware that in giuing his hand to a Gentlewoman hee be not gloued, and if ſhe bee a horſebacke, that hee talke with her bare headed, to doe her the more honour, and if ſhee ride behinde him, &amp; they chance to diſcourſe together, let him neuer looke backe vpon her to behold her, for that is a rude manner, and a token of ill education.
                     And one common courteſie there is among Courtiers, that when they are in talke with Ladies and Gentlewomen, and entertaining of them, they ſuffer them to do with them what they will, to raigne ouer them, and to bee ouercommed in argument of them, and they holde it good manners to doe them ſeruice, when they haue any occaſion offered to ſerue them. And when he ſhal accompany any Gentlewoman to goe a viſitation with her, or to talke abroad for their pleaſure through the ſtreetes, he muſt ride fayre and ſoftly, and if ſhe ſhould happen to keepe him ſo long in talke till ſhe ſhould alight, the good Courtier muſt beare it courteouſly, &amp; make a good countenance, as thogh it grieued him nothing, ſith wee know very There is almoſt no end of a womans talke. well, that when women beginne once to talke, it is impoſſible for them tomake an end, vnleſſe they bee ouerta

                     Hee that will bee a Courter, muſt weare his ſhooes blacke and cleane, his hoſe ſtraight to his legges, and his garments without plight or wrincle, his ſword fayre varniſhed, his ſhirts finely wrought, and his cappe ſtanding with a good grace. For the chiefeſt thing of Court is, that noble men bee rich in apparrell, and the right Courtiers to bee fine and cleanly. It is not decent for a man to weare his ſlippers ſo long that the corke be ſeene, nor his garments till they be torne, nor ſurre till it be bare

before, nor ſhyrtes till they be worne out, nor his cap till the turffe be greaſie, nor his coate till it be threed-bare, nor his girdle till it be halfe-broken.
                     For, the Courtyer may not onely weare his Garments to content himſelfe, but alſo to like others, that ſhall behold it.
                     And after that hee is once determined to goe to the Courte, hee muſt ſuppoſe to goe thither well Apparelled, elſe ſure they wil not account him to be a right Courtyer. For in this caſe, the excuſe of pouertie may not be alleadged: for they will thinke them rather miſerable, then poore courtyers.
                     
                     The good Courtyer may not ſpare in Where the Courtier ſhould ſpare and ſpend. Court, to ſpend afterwards at home: but he muſt pinch at home, to be liberall afterwards in the Court.
                     And yet once againe I returne to recite, that for a Courtyer to come into the Princes fauour, hee may not any way bee ſparing or miſerable, but rather honeſtly liberall, and bountifull. For ſeldom-times concurre theſe two things together: to be miſerable, and yet with his miſerie, to attaine to the Princes fauour.
                     I remember I ſaw once a friende of mine in the Courte weare a Ierkin, faced at the coller with Martens, and they were all bare and greaſy, and there was a certaine Portingale in the Courte (a pleaſaunt companyon) that came to this Gentleman, and asked him properly, What faire Furres they were he ware about his necke? and this gentleman anſwered him, Martins: Martins Syr, ſaith the Portingale: Me thinks they ore rather like ſurres of Aſh-wendeſday, then of Shroue-tueſday: And finely this Portingale compared Mardi (that is Tueſday) to his martin furres: &amp; ſo likewiſe his martin furres to Mardi.
                     
                     And ſure hee had great reaſon not to praiſe them, but greatly to rebuke him for them. For, it had been more for his honour and worſhip, to haue had the coller of his Ierken lined with faire white lamme, then with ſuch old, ſtale, dyrtie, and ſweatie martins.
                     
                     The bruches that our Courtyer muſt weare in his cappe, muſt be very rich, and excellently well wrought, and his Deuſe or Motto, that hee will haue about it ſo curious, that though euery man may reade it, yet few ſhall vnderſtand what it meanes. For ſuch Deuiſes are euer lightly grounded of vaine and fonde toyes: and therefore they ſhould bee ſo much more ſecrete and obſcure. For ſure the faulte is great enough in a man to deuiſe it, though hee doe not bewray it.
                     Alſo his Seruaunts that waytes vpon him, muſt needes goe handſomely apparelled, and fine and neat in their How the Courtiers ſeruant ſhould bee apparrelled. cloathing. For, it is a ſmall honour for the Maſter to be well apparelled, if he let his ſeruants goe beggarly.
                     There are many Courtyers that haue their men following them with thred bare clokes, torn cotes, foule ſhirts, broken hoſe, and rent ſhoes. So that theſe poore ſeruing-men, if for one moneth they weare that their maſter giueth them for three other moneths they weare their own proper fleſh.
                     It is no wiſe mans part, but a meere folly to keepe a greater traine then he is able: For that Courtier that hath alwayes many ſeruants wayting on him, and they going tattered and torn hauing no good thing to put on their backes (or at leaſt that they haue is but meane and ſimple) ſhall ſooner winne the name of a broker, that preferreth other men to ſeruice, then of a Maſter that keepeth ſeruants himſelfe:
                     The good Courtier muſt giue vnto all his ſeruants that ſerue him, eyther apparrell or wages: for that ſeruant that ſerueth onely in houſe for bare meate and drinke, ſhall neuer ſerue truely while he doth ſerue.
                     
                        
And therefore let the Courtyer looke well to it, that hee entertaine no man into his ſeruice, but that firſt he agree with him for ſtanding wages: vnles it bee that hee be ſome nephew, or Kinſman, or ſome of his deere friends: or elſe in the ende, if he be a Noble-man, (vnleſſe he doe ſo) hee ſhall finde that at the yeares ende hee ſhall ſpend him more, then if hee gaue him ordinary wages, and beſides they will not bee contented with him, although it be to his greater charge.
                     Alſo let him conſider well, if it happen that (when hee hath neede of ſeruaunts to wayte vpon him) ſome brother or Neighbours childe be offered vnto him, whether he ſhal receiue him or no. For after he hath receiued him in his houſe, eyther hee ſhall be compelled to beare with his faultes, and diſorders he ſhall doe, or elſe deſirous to rebuke and reforme him, or to ſend him home againe: he ſhall but winne anger and diſpleaſure of his Father, or his proper kinsfolks. Surely ſuch Courtyers as take thoſe kinde of men into their ſeruice, haue a great deale of pain and trouble with them. And truly it is too great a crueltie, that the Courtyer, ſhold be driuen to beare the diſhoneſtie of his man that ſerues him, whē his owne Father could not away with his conditions.
                     Some Fathers are ſo much blinded, and beſotted with fatherly affection, and difficulte beſides to pleaſe, that they are not contented that the courtyer hath receyued their ſonne into his ſeruice, and that he entreat him as if hee were his owne kinſman: but further, they would haue the Courtyer his Maiſter, to beare with all his ſawcie deſhoneſtīes, and leawdnes: and if they cannot frame the young man to theyr minde, as they would haue him; yet at leaſt they would haue his maiſter to pittie him, for that hee is butyoung, and hath no knowledge, and for a while to wincke at all his faultes, in good hope of a better amendment.
                     The Courtier may not onely ſee, that his men be well in apparrell, but he muſt prouide alſo that they haue meate enough to put in their bellies: For the ſeruants that are ſtarued for meat, are wont to do ſmall ſeruice, and beſides that to complaine much. Let him beware alſo he doe not take into his ſeruice any lewde perſons, buſie bodies, and vnquiet men, cutpurſes, ruffians, quarrellers or whoremongers: if hee finde that hee hath ſuch in his houſe, let him turne him out of ſeruice ſtraight; for by keeping ſuch mates in his houſe, his houſe ſhall neuer be wel ordered, there ſhall euer be quarrelling and ſwearing amongſt them, and beſides that, the neighbors and common people ſhall bee offended.
                     Let the good Courtier foreſee that he haue no cardes nor dice in his houſe to occupie the ſeruants: For thoſe thriftles ſeruants that are giuen to play, beginne firſt to play, and afterwardes they learne to ſteale Let the Courtier be well aduiſed alſo when he chideth with his ſeruants, that hee bee not too lowde, that his voyce may bee heard abroad, as all the Hoſtes and Inne-keepers are: For in beeing too lowde, hee ſhould bee more diſhonoured then blamed, for the ill words he giueth his man. Let him take heed alſo that hee doe not call his ſeruants drunkards, theeues, villaines, Iewes, nor other ſuch like names of reproch.
                     For thoſe and other like vncurteous wordes are of ſmall correction, add yet they bring diſpleaſure, and diſdaine inough. And if the Courtier cannot giue bountifully and pleaſure his officers and ſeruants that are aboute him, yet at leaſt (howſoeuer the World go) let him not be behind

with them in paying them their whole wages due to them: for ſo it might lightly happen, that the ſeruāts would begin to make complaints of him, and that vnhappily in the end he might come to die with miſery in his enemies hands.
                     There is no enemy in the world ſo cruell, nor ſo much to be feared, as the ſeruant that is not contented with his Maſter, for as he is the theefe of the houſe, ſo knoweth hee very well what peece of his Maſters harneſſe is wanting for his body to ſet on him, when hee would in that place haue an arrow for his token.
                     Therefore ſo ſoone as it commeth to the Courtiers eares, that any of his ſeruants complaine of him, eyther let him giue him al that he would haue or put him out of his houſe immediately: For if he doe it not, let him be aſſured that that ſeruant will neuer leaue till hee haue put in diſcord with his friends, and defame with others. And aboue all things we haue ſpoken of yet, the Courtier muſt chiefely looke what his man is he truſted with his honour? for in this caſe many are wont not onely to be deceiued, but alſo many times ſcorned.
                     And there are many that will put their goods into the hands and truſt of a man, but their honour &amp; things of greateſt weight and importance, they will ſooner commit to the truſt of a young fooliſh, and ſimple Page, then of a wiſe and ſtayed man. And therefore how much more his buſines is of weight and importance, ſo much leſſe ſhould it be reueled to the ſecreſie of a boy.
                     And if hee doe otherwiſe, I can aſſure him, hee ſhall ſooner be ſpoken of of euery man, then hee ſhall haue his buſineſſe diſpatched.
                     The Courtier muſt alſo haue his chamber wel hanged, and finely kept, and cleane, and his houſe and family all in good order, and euery man quiet: For the cleanneſſe of the houſe, and ciuility of the ſeruants, are a great token and witneſſe of the nobility of the maſter.
                     In the Courtiers Chamber where hee lyeth, the bed muſt firſt of all bee made, and the cloth before the dore let downe, the chamber ſwept, the hangings and other ſtuffe that is there in good order, with ſome perfumes, or other ſweet odors, ſo that it ſhould laugh vpon a man that comes into it: for there are ſome in the Court ſo filthy, and ſo ill furniſhed of hangings, and other ſtuffe, that if any man come to ſee their chambers, they ſeeme rather ſheepe coates, then Courtiers Chambers.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. IX. Of the wiſe manner the Courtier ſhould haue to ſerue and honour the Ladies and Gentlewomen: and alſo to ſatiſfie and pleaſe the Vſhers, and Porters of the Kings houſe.
                     
                     
                        LEt the good Courtier A good caueat for Courtiers. bee alwayes circumſpect, that hee ſeeke not any fauour at the Iuſtices hands but that that is lawfull: For if eyther hee bee denyed, he ſhall returne with ſhame, or being graunted, hee ſhall leaue his conſcience to gage, In ſutes and controuerſies betweene men of Religion in the ſpirituall Court, Let him in no caſe deale: For at the firſt ſhew they ſeeme very eaſie to the Iudge, but when they come to the vnripping of the matter, to iudge of them then they are matters of great charge

and conſcience.
                     There were manie Towers in Ieruſalem, to any of which the diuell might haue brought IESVS CHRIST, to haue perſwaded and tempted him, to haue thrown himſelfe down: howbeit he would not bring him but to the pinacle of the Church, to let vs vnderſtand therby, that he tooke more pleaſure in one ſinne done in the Church, or of holy perſons, then of tenne committed in the world, &amp; of worldlings.
                     And notwithſtanding the Courtyer doth not ſee that the reaſon is of his ſide that is recommended to him, hee neede neuer paſſe for that, to entreate for him, or to charge his owne proper conſcience: as for example.
                     If any man intreat him to ſpeake to the Iudge, or to write him a letter. For manie times wee ſee the iudges make The cuſtome of many iudges. much more account of one only word or letter from him that is in fauor and eſtimation with the Prince, then they will of the Religion and and Iuſtice of another man. And alwayes write in this forme: Right Worſhipfull, or Honourable: the Letters of fauour that ſhall be requeſted of you, &amp;c. That by thoſe wordes the Iudge may know, that for that they were requeſted &amp; beſought, and not that it ſhould ſeem you write for affection: For doing otherwiſe, that that you ſhall write to him to ſatisfie others in, he will thinke that you doe it, becauſe eyther for reaſon, or dutie, hee ſhould performe your Letters.
                     The like conſideration and modeſtie the good Prince ſhould haue in that hee doeth commaund: the like and ſelfe-ſame ſhold the eſteemed and fauoured of the Court obſerue in his requeſts he maketh. For many times the requeſts of the beloued in Courte are with more celeritie performed, then the commiſſions of the Prince are accompliſhed.
                     Let the Courtyer alwayes haue in his minde alſo, that if hee meete with an Noble-man or Knight by the way, hee doe in any condition return with him and keepe him companie: although the Noble-man or Knight ſtriue with him, not to haue him got backe with him: yet let him not ſuffer himſelfe to be ouercome; to let all men knowe, that notwithſtanding the Noble-man or Knight paſſe him in degree or Apparrell, yet he ſhall not exceede him in curteſie and ciuilitie.
                     Now this courtly company is only to be vnderſtood to be offered the Knight when he rideth into the Citie of pleaſure, and not when he goeth alone: and ſheweth by his for-head an vnpleaſaunt countenance, troubled in his minde. Yet the Courtyer neuertheles muſt offer himſelfe to accompanie him, which if hee doe accept, hee may not then withſtand or importune him to doe it: For where he ſhould thinke to bee accounted courteous, they would repute him a troubleſom man.
                     When the Courtyer ſhall accompany any Noble-man of the Court, let Contention for place in accompanying a noble man. him not then ſeeme to contende with other Courtyers for place and honour in his preſence, who ſhould be before, or behinde another.
                     For this ſtrife comming to the Noble-mans eare whome they accompanie, it might eaſily happen that that companie, that came to wayte vpon him, and to doe him honour and ſeruice, ſhould then ſeeme to diſhonour and offend him.
                     Little knoweth he what honor meaneth, when in theſe trifles hee ſeeketh it. For the wiſe and courteous Courtyer, hath not only to ſeeke honour with them, with whom he rideth cheeke by cheeke: but alſo with thoſe that are beloued of the Prince. Now when the Noble-man is accompanyed, and that hee is come hard by the Court, your Courtyers bee readie to alight off your horſe, quickely before him:

and when hee ſhall likewiſe take his horſe againe, be as ready to take your horſe backe before him: For doing thus, you ſhall bee neare about him when hee lighteth off his horſe, and afterwards helpe him when hee mounteth on his horſe againe.
                     If perhaps at the comming in of a Chamber, the Lordes ſeruants want conſideration, or that they remember not to holde open the cloth ouer the dore, the good and diligent Courtier ſhould ſodenly put himſelfe before him, to lift and hold it vp: For many times it is as great an honour for a Courtier to be accounted one of good maner and bringing vp in the Court, as out of the Court, it is to be reputed a great and famous Captaine in wars.
                     And ſince the Courtier is determined to accompany ſome noble man to the Court, hee is alſo bound by the Lawes of the Court to wayte vpon him home againe, which if hee doe, the Noble man ſhall bee more beholding to him for the attendance hee hath giuen vpon him, then for his cō
                        pany to ride with him.
                     If any come to ſpeake with the courtier that were equall with him in degree, A point of

                     The good Courtier muſt euer ſpeake againe to him that ſpeaketh to him, do him reuerence that doeth him reuerence, put off his cappe to him, that putteth off his, and this hee muſt doe without any reſpect that hee is his friend or foe: for in the effects of good maners, no man ought ſo much to bee an Enemie, that the enmitie ſhould breake the boundes of curteſie and humanity. It is rather fit for common perſons, then for Courtlike gentlemen, in ſo meane things to ſhewe their enmitie.
                     For to ſay truely, the good Courtyer ſhould not ſhewe the enmitie of the heart, by putting on, or pulling off his Cap, but by taking ſworde in hand to reuenge his quarrell.
                     And if the Courtyer were in the Church, Court, or in the Chappell of the Prince, and ſet, and an other gentleman happely commeth in the ſame place where he is, he muſt doe him the curteſie to giue him the place and ſeat and to pray him to ſit downe: yea, and if there were no other place fit for the gentleman to ſit in, and that of curteſie alſo hee would not offer him that iniurie to accept it: yet at the leaſt let the Courtyer doe what hee may, to make him take a peece of his ſtoole, that parting with him his ſeate, the other may alſo come to part with him his heart.
                     If thoſe that were ſet hard by the Courtyer begun to talke in ſecrete together, Hee is ill taught that liſtneth to other men ſpeaking in ſecret. he ſhould riſe from thence, or goe a little aſide from them. For, in the Court they wil ſay he is ill taught, and brought vp, and wanteth ciuilitie and good manners that will ſeeme to harken to any bodyes tales or ſecrets.
                     The Courtyers muſt haue frienſhip alſo with the Porters, to open him the Court-gates that are kept faſt chained in, that they be contented to ſuffer their Moyle or Foot-cloth-nagge to enter into the vtter-court.
                     And the like muſt be practiſed with the gentlemen-Vſhers of the Chamber, and Captaine of the Garde, to whom hee muſt doe a thouſand pleaſures, that they may reſpect his perſon, and let him come in when he wil. and the next way to winne his friendſhip, and to continue them friendes,

and to be welcome of them, is to feaſt them otherwhiles: ſometimes with a banket, but eſpecially not to faile them with a new-yeares gift, on New-yeares day, what Trifle or preſent ſoeuer it bee.
                     That Courtyer that is not acquaynted with the Vſhers, and doth them no pleaſures, may bee well aſſured that thoſe aboue in the Hall, will make him tarry in the vtter-Court: and thoſe that ſtand at the gate of the Cheyne, they will make him light in the myre. With the Vſhers of the priuie-Chamber, hee muſt needes deale honourably withall, as to come and ſee them ſometimes, and to do them much honour, in giuing them ſome faire iewell or preſenting them with a Gowne, or Coate-cloth of ſilke or veluet. And thus he ſhall be aſſured, they will not only let him into the priuie-chamber: but they will alſo procure him, to ſpeake with the Prince, at his beſt leyſure.
                     To make the yeomen of the Guarde alſo that make gentlemen giue place, and ſtand a looſe off-from the Prince, it cannot bee but very profitable for the Courtyer to haue them his friends. For many times they may helpe vs to a fit place to talke with the King, it is ſuch a trouble and charge to ſpeake with the Prince, that if wee haue not greaat Friendſhip with theſe we haue ſpoken of, and that we doe them ſome pleaſures before we come to the Court they will ſhut the dores againſt vs, and wee ſhall come home aſhamed of our ſelues.
                     For, a Courtyer to bee acquaynted with the Ladies and gentlemen of the Court, it is rather of pleaſure then of neceſſitie: albeit it be true, that the young-Courtyer, that ſerueth not ſome Ladie or Dame in the Court, ſhall be rather blamed of his ſhamefaſtneſſe, and Cowardly heart, then approued for his modeſtie and grauitie.
                     In deede for a young-Gentleman that is rich, noble, and free-harted: it is an honeſt and comely entertainment, to become ſome Ladyes ſeruaunt of the Court: But for him that is poore, liuing in diſgrace, and out of fauour, let him vtterly flye the loue of Courtly Dames, and ſticke to the poor-friends ſhip of deuout Nunnes. For the property of Courtly Miſtreſſes, is to empty What the propertie of courtly Miſtreſſes is. their ſeruants-purſes, and the manner of religious-Nunnes, to beg alwayes of him that viſites her.
                     The Courtyer that offereth himſelfe to ſerue any Ladie or gentlewoman in court, doth bind himſelfe to a ſtreight religion: For ſometimes hee muſt kneele by her of one knee, ſometimes he muſt ſtand vppon his Feete before her, and alwayes he muſt haue his cap in his hand, and he may not ſpeake to her, vnleſſe ſhee commaund him firſt: and if ſhee aske any thing of him, hee is bound to giue it her ſtraight, if hee can: and though ſhee frowne vppon him, yet hee may not bee angrie with her - ſo that the Courtyer muſt needes imploy his whole perſon, and goods, in ſeruing of her, that hee loues. For, the Courtyer that is marryed, ſurely it is not fit for him to loue any other woman then his wife: neyther is it honeſt for the woman to be ſerued with any married courtyer, For theſe manner of loues are to no other ende, but for him to be merry with her, and for her to get ſomewhat of him.
                     Let the Courtyer be very wiſe, and beware that he doe not loue and ſerue ſuch a gentlewoman whom he cannot obtaine to his wife: For otherwiſe it ſhould be a great corſiue to his heart, and a more ſhame, to ſee another before his eyes to enioy her, and eate of that fruite, which hee had now to his great coſte and charges, made now a fruitfull Orch-yard.
                     And if it happen that his Miſtreſſe whom he ſerueth be nobly borne, very

fayre of complexion, pleaſant of condition, of good grace and behauiour in her conuerſation, very wiſe &amp; fine in her doings: hee may bee well aſſured, hee ſhall neuer forget this griefe, and ſorrow, and ſo much the more, if hee did loue her with all his heart and vnfainedly.
                     There is great difference between that we loſe, and that wee haue: For if the heart lament for the loſſe of that wee haue, it bewayleth bitterly to loſe that wee loue. Alſo the Courtier muſt be aduiſed that hee tell not to any that his wife hath told him, or any thing that hath paſſed ſecretly between thē, For women are of ſuch a quality, that for any thing they doe, they would neuer heare of it againe willingly, and thoſe ſecrets, that another commits to them of truſt, they can neuer keepe them ſecret.
                     There is a Law common between women and their Louers: for if they goe abroad, their louers muſt attende vpon their perſons, and if they buy any thing in the ſtreete as they goe, they are bound to pay for it. And if they be too late abroad, they muſt prouide them of torches to bring them home with; and when the Court remoueth frō place to place, theirs is the charge, to defray their expences by the way: and if any doe them iniury, they are bound to reuenge their quarrell: If they fall ſicke, they muſt doe them a thouſand pleaſures and ſeruices: if any challenge bee made in Court, of tilt, turney, or barriers, they muſt bee the firſt and beſt mounted and armed aboue others (if they may poſſible) with all, not forgetting their Ladyes colours and deuiſe, offering themſelus nobly to performe the challenge, giuing them to vnderſtand, that for their ſakes, they neyther feare to aduenture their liues, nor ſpare for any charge to doe them all honour and ſeruice. with out doubt, wee may ſpeake it truely, that hee putteth himſelfe to great perill and danger (whatſoeuer hee bee) that ſerueth women.
                     But when the wiſe Courtier is now become a ſeruaunt to any Lade, hee muſt beware in any caſe hee entertaine or ſerue any other then his miſtreſſe: for if hee did it otherwiſe, hee ſhould raiſe a mortall hate and diſcorde betweene theſe women: by reaſon whereof many ſlaunders &amp; broiles might enſue.
                     It is a naturall thing to all women, The nature of women in hating or louing to man. that to hate any man, a hundred will come to agree in one opinion: but to loue him, you ſhall not finde two of one minde. The good Courtier muſt couet the beſt he can to be alwayes at the making ready of the King, and at meat, and that for two cauſes: The one for that hee may be ready to doe him ſeruice, and the other, for that at ſuch a time they ſhall haue an apt time to treate with the Prince in any thing hee will, if he haue any occaſion of buſines with him. And when the King is eyther at his meate, or that hee bee putting on his apparrell, let the good Courtier be circumſpect he come not too neere the Table where he ſitteth, nor that hee touch the Kings apparell he weareth on: for no man ought once to preſume to bee ſo hardy to meddle with his meate, or his apparrell, vnleſſe he be Shewer or Chamberlaine, And if in this time of repaſt, or making him ready, there were preſent any Ieſters or fooles, that ſayd or did any thing to make them laugh.
                     The good Courtier muſt take heede that hee laugh not too loud, as in ſuch caſes many are wont to doe: For in ſuch a caſe the Prince would be better pleaſed at the modeſty of the Courtier, then at the knauery of the foole.
                     The honeſt Courtier muſt not haue a foole his friend, nor his enemy, for to make him his friend, hee is too diſhoneſt, and to be his enemy, hee is

too vile and cowardly. I wiſh the Courtier not to bee angry with him: what ſoeuer he doth: for many times it happeneth that the friendſhippe of a wiſe man doth not ſo much benefite The friendſhip of a wiſe man doth not ſo much good, as a fooles diſpleaſur doth hurt. or pleaſure, as the enmity and diſpleaſure of one of theſe fooles doth hurt. And if hee will giue them any thing (as he muſt needes) let him beware he giue him not occaſion to condemne his conſcience, and that hee ſtoppe their mouthes: For the Courtier that is Chriſtian, ſhall giue as much more to the poore to pray to God for him, as hee ſhall giue to others to ſpeake well of him to the king.
                     When the King ſneeſes, and that the Courtier bee preſent, hee muſt ſtraight put off his cappe, and bowe himſelfe in a manner to the ground, but for all that hee muſt take heed, he ſay not, Chriſt helpe you, or God bleſſe you, or ſuch other like: For to doe any maner of courteſie or honor: is pertinent onely to Courtiers: But to ſay, Chriſt helpe, or God bleſſe you: is the Country manner.
                     And if the King by chance ſhould haue any hayre or feather to flye vppon his clothes, or any other filthy thing about him: none but the chamberlaine onely ſhould take it away, and none other Courtier ſhould once preſume to take any thing from his backe, or to touch his garment, neyther any other perſon, vnleſſe it were in caſe to defend him.
                     When the king is ſet at the table, the Courtier may not come into the Kitchen, nor much leſſe leane vpon the ſurueying boorde: For though hee did it perhaps but to ſee the order of the ſuruey, and ſeruice of the Prince: yet it may bee ſuſpected of ſome, hee meant worſer matter, and and thereby they ſhould iudge ill of him. If the Prince haue a felicity in hawking, the Courtier muſt endeauour himſelfe to keepe a caſt or two of good Falcons, and if in hunting, then he muſt haue good Greyhounds. And when hee is eyther a hawking or hunting with the King, hee muſt ſeeke to ſerue him ſo diligently that day, that he may both find him game to ſport with, and procure for himſelfe alſo fauour at the Princes hand.
                     Many times Princes are ſo earneſt of their game, and ſo deſirous to kill that they hunt, that they are wonte boldly to chaſe the beaſtes they hunt, and purſue them ſo, that oftentimes they loſe the ſight of the reſt, In ſuch a caſe the good Courtier muſt euer haue his eyes vpon him, and rather ſeeke to follow the King, then to take pleaſure in hunting of other beaſts: for in that caſe it ſhal be a better hunting for him to finde out the King, and to be with him, then he ſhould take pleaſure in being alone with the Hart.
                     It may happen lightly, that the king galloping his horſe vpon the rockie ſtones, he might ſtūble at ſuch a ſtone, as both the King and his horſe ſhould come to the ground: and at that time it could not be but very profitable to the Courtier to bee preſent: For it might ſo happen, that by means of the Princes fall (he being ready to helpe him) he might thenceforth beginne to grow in fauour and credite with the Prince.
                     The moſt part of thoſe that delight to goe a hunting, are wont commonly to eate their meate greedily, &amp; drinke out of meaſure, and beſides to ſhout and make a wonderful noiſe, as they were out of their wits: which thinges the graue, and wiſe Courtier ſhould not do: for they are rather fit for vagabonds, &amp; idle perſons, that ſet not by their honeſty: then they are for the honeſt Courtier, that only deſireth and endeauoreth by modeſty &amp; wiſe behauiour to become great, and in fauour.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. X. Of the great pains and troubles the Courtier hath that is toilde in ſutes of Law, and how hee muſt ſuffer, and behaue himſelfe with the Iudges.
                     
                     
                        THere are in the Court alſo diuers kindes of men, that bee not Courtiers, Diuers and ſundry ſorts of Courtiers, &amp; Princes ſeruants, but only are Courtiers of neceſſity, by reaſon of ſuites they haue with the counſell. And theſe manner of Courtiers haue as much need of counſell, as of helpe: for hee that hath his goods in hazard, hath alſo his life in ieopardy.
                     To ſpeake of the diuers and ſubtill wayes of ſuffering, it is no matter worthy to bee written with ynke, but onely with liuely bloud: For indeed if euery one of theſe ſuters, were forced to abide for his faith, and beleeue thoſe paines, troubles, and ſorrowes, that he doth to recouer his goods, as much cruelty as tortures ſhould Vaglioditi, and Grauata haue, as euer had Rome in times paſt. In my opinion, I thinke it a hell to continue a long ſuter. And ſurely we may beleeue, yea and ſweare to, that the Martyrs executed in olde time in the Primitiue Church (which were many in number) did not ſuffer ſo much, neyther felt ſuch griefe to looſe their life, as doth now a daies an honeſt man, to ſee himſelfe depriued of all his faculties. It is a great trouble and charge to recouer any thing, but in the end of theſe two effects, a wiſe man ſuffereth and feeleth more the diſpleaſure he receyueth, then he doth the goods hee ſpendeth. And in my iudgement to ſtriue and contend is nothing elſe, but to bring matter to the hart to ſigh and lament: to the Eyes to weepe, to the Feet to go, to the Tongue to complaine, The heauie happe of thoſe that are in Sutes of Law. to the handes to ſpend, to intreat his Friendes to fauour his cauſe: and to commaund his ſeruaunts to be carefull and diligent, and his bodie to labour continually.
                     He that vnderſtandeth not the conditions of contention: I will let him know, they are theſe which follow, Of a rich man, to become poore: of a mery man, to be made ſad and Melancholie: of a free man, a bond-man: of a liberall man, a couetous man: of a quiet man, an vnquyet perſon: and of a htaefull, a deſperate perſon.
                     How is it otherwiſe poſſible, but that the hapleſſe Poore Suter muſt become deſperate? ſeeing the Iudge looketh vppon him with a frowning counteuaunce: his goods to bee demaunded of him wrongfully: and that now it is ſo long a time hee hath not bin at home, and knoweth not as yet whether Sentence ſhall be giuen, with him, or againſt him.
                     And beſides all this, that the Pooreman in his lingring Sute hath ſpent ſo much, that hee hath not left him ſixe pence in his purſe. If any of theſe troubles be ynough to bring a man to his end, much more ſhal they be to make the poore-man deſperate, and weary of his life. So diuers are the effects, and ſucceſſes ſeene in matters of Sutes, that many times there is no wit able to dyrect them, nor goods to bring them to end. Nay, wee may boldly and truely ſay, that the Lawes are ſo many, &amp; diffuſe of themſelues, and mens iudgements ſo ſimple to vnderſtand them: that at this day there is no Suite in the world ſo cleer, but there is found another law to put that in doubt, &amp; make it voyd. And therfore the good and ill

of the Suter, conſiſteth not ſo much in the reaſon he hath, as in the Law which the Iudge chuſeth to giue iudgmēt of.
                     It is well that the Suter belieue and thinke that he hath right, but the chiefeſt thing of importaunce is, that the Iudge alſo, deſire that hee haue his right. For, that Iudge that fauoureth my cauſe, and deſireth to doe mee Iuſtice, he will labour and ſtudy to ſeeke out ſome Law that ſhal ſerue my turn, to reſtore mee againe to my right.
                     To contend, is ſo profound a ſcience, that neither Socrates to the Athenians, nor Solon to the Greeks, nor Numa Pom pylius to the Romaines, nor Prometheus to the Egiptians, nor Lycurgus to the Lacedemonians, nor Plato to his Diſciples, nor Apolonius, to the Poets of Nemeſis, nor Hiarcus to the Indians, could euer teach it them: and much leſſe could they tell how to finde anie way to write it in the bookes of their Common-wealth.
                     The cauſe why theſe famous men did not finde it, was becauſe this Science could not be learned by ſtudying of diuers bookes, nor by trauelling through diuers countreyes, but onely by framing great Sutes and Proceſſes, and by infinite charge, and expences of money.
                     Happie, yea truly, and moſt treble happie were thoſe ages, in which they neither knew, nor yet could tell, what ſtrife or contention meant. For, indeede from that time hetherto, the world hath fallen to decay, and chiefly ſince men haue grown to quarrel, and each one contēded with his neighbor.
                     
                        Plato was wont to ſay, that in that Commonweale where there were found many Phyſitians, it was alſo an euident token that there were many vicious people: and likewiſe we may ſay, that in that Citie where there are manie Suters, it is to bee thought it followes alſo, that there are many yll diſpoſed-people.
                     That onely may be called a bleſſed and fortunate Common Weale, where men liue quietly, and haue not to doe with Iuſtices nor Iudges: for it is a true rule, when Phyſitians are much frequented, and Iudges much occupied, that amongſt that people, there is little health, and leſſe quiet. But to returne to the troubles of our Suiters: I ſay, that the Diſciples of the famous Philoſopher Socrates, were not bound to be ſilent in Athens aboue two yeares: but the vnfortunate Suiters What miſery the poore Clyents &amp; Suters are ſubiect vnto were bound to holde their peace ten yeares, if their ſuites did continue ſo long. For albeit the Iudge doe them open iniury, yet they may not ſeeme to complaine, but rather ſay, hee thinketh hee hath done him the beſt iuſtice in the world.
                     And if for his miſhap or plague of his offences, hee would not ſo approue and ſpeake them, let him bee aſſured, the Iudge will perceiue it by his countenance, and afterwardes let him know it by his iudgement.
                     Some Suters ſay, they are great Sinners, and I ſay they are Saintes: For of the ſeuen deadly ſinnes that are committed, onely of three they are but to bee accuſed: for in the other foure (although they would) they doe not giue him time nor leaue to offend How can the Suiter euer offend in pride, ſince hee muſt poore man goe from houſe to houſe with his cappe in his hand, and all humilitie to ſolicit his cauſe?
                     How can hee euer offend in Auarice, ſith hee hath not many times a penny in his purſe to buy him his dinner: nor to pay for the infinite draughts and Copies proceeding out of the Chancerie?
                     How can hee offend in ſloth and idlenes, ſith hee conſumeth the long nights onely in ſighes an complaints, and the whole day in trotting and trudging vp and downe.
                     
                        
How can he offend in Gluttony, ſince he would be content to haue onely to ſuffice nature, and not to deſire pies nor breakefaſts, nor to lay the Table euery day? That ſinne they moſt eaſily and commonly offend in, is ire, and indeed I neuer ſaw ſuter patient, and although hee be angry, wee may not maruell at it a whit: For if euer once in the end of halfe a year he happen to haue any thing that pleaſeth him, I dare bee bound euery weeke after hee ſhall not want infinite troubles to torment and vexe him.
                     Theſe men alſo offend much in enuy: for indeed there is no man that pleades but is enuious: and this proceedeth many times, to ſee an other man, by fauour diſpatched of his ſute, that hath not continued onely two moneths in Court a ſuter: and of his that hath continued aboue two yeares ſince it beganne, not a word ſpoken. They offend alſo in the ſinne of backebiting, and murmuring againſt theyr neighbours: For they neuer ceaſe complayning of the partiality of the Iudges, of the ſlothfulneſſe and timorouſnes of his Counſellor, that pleads his cauſe at the barre: of the little conſideration of the Attorney, of the payments of the Notary, and of the ſmall curteſies (or rather rudenes) of the officers of the Iudge: So that it may be well ſayde, that to ſtriue in Law, and to murmur, are neere kinsfolks together.
                     The Egyptians were in times paſt plagued onely with ten plagues, but theſe miſerable and wofull ſuters are dayly plagued with a thouſand torments. And the difference betwixt their plague &amp; theſe is, that the Egiptians 
                        What torments are incident to thoſe that haue ſutes in law. came from the diuine prouidēce and theſe of our poore ſuters, from the inueution of mans malice.
                     And it is not without cauſe, we ſay, that it is mans inuention, and not diuine: For to frame inditements, to giue delayes to the party, to alledge actions, to deny the demaund, to accept the proofe, to examine witneſſes to take out proces, to note the declaration, to prolong the cauſe, alledging well, or prouing il, to refuſe the iudge for ſuſpect, to make interceſſion, to take out the copy of the plea, and to call vpon it againe with a 1500. doubles.
                     Surely, al theſe are things that neither God commaundeth in the olde Teſtament, neyther Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour doth alow in his holy goſpel. The writings of Egypt, although they were to the great loſſe and detriment of the Seigniory of the Egyptians, yet were they neuertheleſſe very profitable for the liberty of the Egyptians: But the miſerable Plaintifes, are yet in an other great extremity; for notwithſtanding the plagues and miſeries the poore wretches ſuffer dayly, yet doe they leaue their ſoules buried in the Courts of Chauncery, and cannot notwithſtanding haue their goods at Liberty.
                     And if the plague of the Egyptians was by riuers of bloud, frogs, horſe flyes, death of cattel, tempeſts, leproſie, Locuſts, myſts, flyes, and by the death of the firſt borne children. The plague of the Plaintifes is to ſerue the Preſidents to beare with the Auditors to intreat the Notaries, to make much of their Clerks, to pleaſe the Counſellers, to follow their heeles, that muſt open their cauſes to pray the vſſhers, to borrow money, to goe from houſe to houſe, to ſolicite their Atturneyes, all theſe things are eaſily to tell, but very hard to ſuffer: for after they are once proued and tryed by experience, they are enough to make a wiſe man contented, rather to loſe a peece of his right, then to ſeeke to recouer it by any ſuch extremity: For hee may bee well aſſured, that hee ſhall neuer want faire countenance, ſugred words

and large promiſes: but for good doings it is a maruellous wonder, if euer they meet together.
                     And therefore before all other things it is neceſſary hee pray to God for his owne health and preſeruation: and next to him, for the preſeruation and long continuance of the Iudge, if hee will obtaine his ſute. Therefore I aduiſe him that hath not the Iudge for his friend, to beware, as from the Diuel, hee doth not commence any ſute before him: for to diſpatch him the better, eyther hee will finde the meanes to make his caſe very darke, or at the leaſt hee will prolong his ſute as long as he pleaſe.
                     It skilleth not much whether the Iudges bee olde or yong men, for both with the one and the other, the poore plaintife hath enough to doe. If they be olde men, a man ſhall trauel long ere he wil heare his cauſe. If they bee young men, he ſhal wait long alſo ere hee can informe them of the very points of his cauſe. An other great diſcommodity yet follow theſe olde Iudges, that being euer ſickly, and of weak nature, they neuer haue ſtrength nor time in manner to examine their caſes.
                     And as thoſe that haue loſt now a great peece of their memory, onely truſting in forepaſſed expences, they preſume to diſpatch their ſuites as lightly, without further looking into A Iudge not to truſt too much to his memory. them, or throughly examining them, as if they had already aduiſedly ſtudyed them. And peraduenture their caſe is of ſuch importance, that if they had looked vpon it very well, they could ſcantly haue told what to haue ſayd in it. And I would not that when any caſe ſhould be determined, and iudgement given vpon my matter, that the Iudge ſhould benefite himſelfe onely with that hee had ſeene, or read before.
                     For although experience bee a great helpe to the Iudge to giue the better iudgment vpon the matter, yet notwithſtanding he is to ſtudy a new to vnderſtand the merits of the cauſe. It is alſo a great trouble, and daungerous for a man to practiſe with new Iudges, and to put their matters into their hands, who onely were called to the place of a Iudge, being thought learned and fitte for it, and ſo brought to rule as a Magiſtrate: For many times theſe young Iudges, and new Phyſitians although they want not poſſible knowledge yet they may lacke a great deale of practiſe &amp; experience: which is cauſe that one ſort maketh many loſe their liues before they doe come to riſe in fame: &amp; the other vndoe many a man, in making him ſpēd all that euer he hath.
                     There is yet beſides, an other apparant daunger, to haue to doe with theſe new and yong experienced iudges: for when they come to ſit newly in iudgement, with their other brethren the Iudges, hauing the lawe in their mouth to ſerue all turnes, they doe but onely deſire and ſtudy to winne fame and reputation amongſt men, and thereby to bee the better reputed of his brethren.
                     And for this cauſe only when they are aſſembled together in place of Iuſtice to giue iudgement of the pleas layde before them, they doe not only inlarge themſelues, in alleadging many and diuers opinions of great learned men, and booke caſes. So that the Hearers of them may rather thinke they haue ſtudyed to ſhew their eloquence and learning, then for to open the deciſion and iudgement of the caſes, they haue before them.
                     And for finall reſolution I ſay, that touching Pleas and Sutes, I am of opinion, that they ſhould neyther truſte the experience of the olde Iudge, nor the learning and knowledge of the

young. But rather I reckon that man wiſe, that ſeeketh by little and little to grow to an agreement with his aduerſarie, and that tarieth not many yeares to haue a lingring, yea (and poſſibly) an vncertaine ende.
                     Alſo I would (in ſome ſort) exhort the poore Plaintiſe, not to bee ouer-curious, to vnderſtand the qualities of the iudge, as a man would ſay, If he be olde, or young, if he be learned or priuiledged, if he be well ſtudyed, or but little, if hee be a man of few or manie words: if hee be afflicted or paſſionate, tractable or ſelfe willed? For, poſſiblie beeing too inquiſitiue to demaund of any of theſe things, it might happen (though hee did it vnawares, yet hee ſhould finde them afterwards all heaped togethers in the perſon of the Iudge, to his hinderance and dammage in decyding his cauſe.
                     The wiſe Suter ſhould not onely not ſeek to be inquiſitiue of the iudge or his conditions: but alſo if any man would ſeeme to tell him of him, hee ſhould giue no eare to him at all. For if it come to the Iudges eares hee enquireth after his manner of liuing, and condition, hee will not onely be angry with him in his minde, but will be alſo vnwilling to giue iudgement in his fauour.
                     The poore Siuter ſhall alſo meete with Terrible Iudges, ſeuere, intractable, chollericke, incommunicable, and inexorable, and yet for all this he may not looke vpon his nature, nor condition: but onely to regarde his good conſcience.
                     For, what neede hee care if the Iudge be of ſeuere and ſharpe condition, as long as he may be aſſured that hee is of good conſcience.
                     It is as needefull for the vpright and good Iudge, to haue a good and pure Conſcience: as it is to haue a skilfull head, and iudgement in the Lawes. For, if he haue the one without the other hee may offend in malice: and if hee haue that without the other, hee may offend alſo in ignorance.
                     And if the ſuter come to ſpeake with the Iudge, and hee by chaunce finde him a ſleepe, hee muſt tarry till hee awake, and if then hee will not, or he cannot giue eare vnto him, hee muſt bee contented.
                     And if he cauſed his man to ſay he were not within (notwithſtanding the ſuter ſaw him) hee muſt diſſemble it: yea, if the ſeruants giue him an ill anſwere, he muſt take it in good worth: For the wary and politike ſuter muſt not bee offended at any thing that is done or ſayde to him, till he ſee the definitiue ſentence giuen with him, or againſt him.
                     It is a maruellous trouble alſo to the ſuter to chuſe his Counſellour: for many times hee ſhall chuſe one that ſhall want both law and conſcience. And ſome others ſhall chuſe one that though on the one ſide hee lacke not Law, yet on the other hee ſhall bee without both ſoule and conſcience: And this is apparantly ſeen, that ſomtime for the gaine of twenty Nobles, hee ſhall as willingly deny the truth, and goe againſt his owne conſciedce, as at another time he will ſeeke for to maintaine Iuſtice.
                     It is true there are many other Counſellours alſo that are both wiſe and learned, and yet notwithſtanding, they know the Law, they can by no meanes frame it to his Clients caſe, wanting deuice and conuayance to ioyne them together.
                     And ſo it happeneth many times that to compare it to his Clyants caſe, hee conuaieth him ſo vnfitlie as of a plaine caſe it was before, It is now made altogether a folde of infinite doubts. I graunt that it is a great furtherance vnto the Clyants, to haue a good and wiſe Counſellor▪
                        
but it is a great deale more for their profite, if they can giue a ſound and profound iudgement of his caſe.
                     For, it is not ynough for the Counſeller to bee able to expound the Law, but it is behouefull for him to applie it to his purpoſe, and to fit it to Time, and Place: according to the neceſſitie of his cauſe.
                     I haue knowne Counſellours my ſelfe, that in their Chayres and Readings in their Halls, haue ſeemed Eagles: The weake knowledge, of ſome Counſellers they haue flowne ſo high in their doctrine and interpretations; but afterwards at the barre where they plead and in the face of their Court, where they ſhould beſt ſhewe themſelues, there they haue prooued themſelues very capons.
                     And the onely cauſe of this is, becauſe they haue gotten by force of long trauell and continuall ſtudie, a knowledge to moote, and read ordinarily their Book-caſes in their chaires by common-practiſe, and putting of them each to other.
                     But when they are taken out of common-trade, and high beaten way, and brought to a little path-way ſtraighted, to a Counſellers-room, at the barre, to pleade his Clyents ſtrange and vnknowne caſe (much contrarie to theyr Booke-caſes before recited) then ſtript of their common-knowledge, and eaſie ſeate in chayre, they ſtand now naked on their feete, before the iudgement-ſeate, like ſenſe-leſſe creatures, voyde of reaſon and experience.
                     But now to ſupplye theſe imperfections of our rawe Counſellers, and to further alſo our Clyents cauſe the better: wee will that the Clyent be liberall, and bountifull to his Counſeller, (thereby the better to whette his wit, and to make him alſo take paines, to ſtudie his eaſe throughly) beeing true, That the Counſeller giueth Lawe, as hee hath rewarde. And that the Counſeller alſo be carefull of his clyents cauſe, and to goe through with that hee taketh vpon him, and truely to deſerue that he taketh of euery man, For elſe they will ſay (and who can blame the poor ſoules) That they are better takers, then good diſpatchers: A foule blot, to ſo great a vertue
                     But well, wee will compare them to their Brothers, the Phyſitians; who The Lawyers &amp; Phyſitians to be compared together. deale with their ſicke Patients, as the Lawyers do with their poore clyants.
                     For, if you giue him not a piece of golde or two in his hand, at each time of his viſitation, to reſtore the languiſhing bodie: hee careth as little for the preſeruation of his health, whether hee liue or dye, as the Lawyer doth for his clients caſe, whether, whether it goe with him or againſt him.
                     Moreouer, my penne ceaſeth not to write of the great troubles, diſpleaſures, iourneyes, expences and trauels, that the poore ſuters haue with theyr Counſellours dayly, as with their Atturneyes, Soliciters, Clerks, Officers, Regiſters, and Sealers, for want of matters to write on: but onely for that they are ſo tedious matters, and ſo foule examples, that they deſerue rather to bee remedied then written.
                     Therefore leauing this Law Diſcourſe, and returning againe to the priuate affaires of the Courtier, abiding ſtill in Court, I ſay, That the Courtier muſt learne to know the Noble men and chiefe Officers of the Prince, As the Lord Chancellour, the Lord Treaſurer, the Lord Marſhall, the Lord Steward, the Lord Chamberlaine, the Lord Priue Seale, The Treaſurer, the Controller, The maſter of the Horſe, The vice Chamberlaine the Secretary, the captaine of the Guard, and the Coferer. And hee need not force to weigh their ſtocke and family, whether they were rich or poore, humble or proude, ſtout or fearefull, nor regard their qualities

and complexions, much leſſe theyr perſons, ſaue onely their authoritie and office they haue, And to ſay truly, it cannot bee choſen, but wee muſt come before theſe Iudges and Officers, ſometimes to beſeech and pray them, now for our owne priuate cauſes, then for the miſrule and offence of our ſeruants, and alſo for the importunancy of our friendes in their matters, to labour them for iuſtice and fauour. And for this cauſe mee thinks it is a wiſe part of the courtier to get into fauour with the counſell, and other officers of Iuſtice, and to obtaine their good wils with continuall attendance of them, in doing them ſeruice at a neede, and alſo to entertaine them with ſome ſmall preſents, to continue their fauour.
                     Firſt, before wee beginne to trouble them, w
                           •
                        e muſt bee acquainted with them, viſite them, and preſent them with ſomewhat: For indeed it is a colde and vnfit thing to craue fauour at a Iudges hands, whom we neuer knew, nor did any ſeruice to.
                     The wiſe Courtier muſt beware alſo not to importune the Noble men and his friendes ſo much, that for euery trifling thing hee would haue them to goe to the Iudges, to ſolicite and entreate for him, which I ſpeake, becauſe I know there are ſome ſo vndiſcreet, that dayly doe importune the Iudges ſo much, and for ſuch trifles, that afterwards with ſhame they are repulſed and denied in maters of great weight and importance.
                     And there are ſome alſo that ſolicite their matter with grauity, and others with importunity, to whome I will bee ſo bold to ſay, and to tell them of it alſo, that importunacie ſheweth the ſimplicitie of the Suiter, and grauity, the honeſty of the worthy Knights, and Gentlemen Courtier.
                     It is but well done, and meete, for the Courtier that is a Suiter, to be diligent to ſolicite his cauſe, and to follow it throughlie, but yet without troubling or importuning too oft the Iudges: For if once the Iudges know him for an importunate and cumberſome ſuiter, they will not onely not ſpeake with him when hee comes, but alſo they will not let him come in at the gate, when they ſee him cōming to them.
                     And if hee happen to goe home to the Iudges houſe, and that hee tell his tale to him ſtanding, let him in no wiſe care to ſit downe, and that his wordes hee ſpeake to him bee fewe, and his memorial he giues him briefe: For obſeruing this order, hee ſhall at that time bee eaſily, yea willingly and courteouſly heard of him, and ſhall How the poore 
                              〈◊〉
                            ſhould demeane himſelfe, when he commeth before the Iudge. make him thinke that hereafter alſo he wil vſe the like order with him.
                     When hee ſeeth that the Iudge is troubled, and that his head is occupied, let him in no caſe at that preſent offer to trouble him, or to ſpeake to him in his matter.
                     For admit hee were contented to heare you quietly (though halfe vnwilling) and to ſuffer you to tell your tale: yet it is impoſſible hee ſhould wholy vnderſtand your caſe, his heade being otherwiſe occupied.
                     And it is needfull alſo to ſhewe you, that though the Iudge ſeeme to bee a little Melancholy, or Collericke: yet the Suiter neede not let for that to ſpeake to him, to open his caſe: yea, and to ſeeke to holde in with him ſtill: For many times wee ſee the Melancholy, and illdiſpoſed Natures, appeaſed and ouercome with the courteous and gentle conuerſation.
                     I remember touching this matter, I went once to the court to ſolicit the Iudge, to pray him to diſpatch my friends matter, and that he might haue iuſtice. And tooke my friend with me.
                     
                        
And the Iudge anſwered vs both, that with all his heart hee would diſpatch him, and ſware, and ſware againe to him, that hee ſhould haue iuſtice, and that with right good wil, hee would keepe his right all he could.
                     Nay ſir, ſayd my friend to him, whom the caſe touched: I thanke you ſir, very much that you will diſpatch mee quickly: but where you ſay, that you haue a great deſire to keepe my right and iuſtice, I vtterly appeale from that ſentence: For I come not ſir, and if it pleaſe you, to followe your heeles, and to waite vpon you to ſolicite my cauſe, to the end you ſhould keepe my right, and detaine it from mee: but that you ſhould giue it to me.
                     For I promiſe you this ſir, if you once giue it me, I meane neuer to trouble your worſhipp hereafter with the keeping of it againe, but will diſcharge you quite.
                     And now after all theſe things we haue ſpoken, I conclude, that whoſoeuer curſeth his enemy, and ſeeketh reuenge of an iniury done him, Let him not deſire to ſee him poore and miſerable, neyther hated nor ill willed of any other, dead, nor baniſhed: but let him onely beſeech God for to plague him with ſome ill ſute: For a man cannot deuiſe to take a greater reuenge of his enemy, then to ſee him entangied in a vile ſute to follow the Cour, or to attend in Chauncerie.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XI. The Author changeth his matter, and ſpeaketh to the beloued of the Court, admoniſhing them to bee pacient in their troubles, and that they bee not partiall in the affayres of the Common weale.
                     
                     
                        THe Courtier ſhall doe well and wiſely (and chiefely if hee be noble, and beloued, to paſſe ouer the iniuries done him, and to beare them patiently, and neuer for to giue any words to any that ſhall offend him; For the officers of Princes can by no other meanes ſo well aſſure their offices and authority they haue, as by doing good continually to ſome and to ſuffer others, no way making any countenance How euery wiſe and prudent Courtier ſhould behaue himſelfe. of diſpleaſure for the iniuries done them by others.
                     And if it happen (as many times i doth) that a follower and hanger on of the Court, hauing ſpent all that he hath, and driuen now to ſeeke a new banke, chaunce to ſpeake diſhoneſt words, and frame great quarrels againſt the Kings Officers; In this caſe the Courtier and wiſe Officer ſhould neuer anſwer him with anger and diſpleaſure, and much leſſe ſpeake vnto him in choller: For a man of honour and reſpect, will be more grieued with a diſhoneſt word that is ſpokē againſt him, then hee will bee for the deniall of that he asketh,
                     Thoſe that are beloued, and beliked of Princes, aboue all other things ought to bee very patient, courteous, and gentle in all things: For all that the followers of the Court, and ſuiters

cannot obtaine in the Court, let them not lay the fault to the Prince that denyed it them, but onely to the fauoured of the Prince, and thoſe about him for that they neuer moued it to the Kings Maieſtie: nor once thought of the matter, as the poore Suters ſuppoſed they had. The paines and troubles of Court are infinite and inſupportable. The Courtiers paines inſupportable.
                     
                     For, how quyet ſoeuer the Courtyer bee, they will trouble and moleſt him, if hee be pacient, they will be impacient and in ſtormes, ſaying: That ſuch a man ſpake yll of him, and ſeekes continually to defame him.
                     
                     Which things wee will the Courtyer heare with patience, and diſſemble with wiſdome. For the wiſe Courtyer ſhould not bee angrie for the yll wordes they ſpeake of him, but onely for the vile and wicked actes they doe vnto him.
                     Let not the Courtyer and Fauourite of the Prince be deceiued, in thinking that doing for this man, and for that man, &amp; in ſhewing them fauour: that for all that, hee can binde or ſtay their tongues that they ſpeak not ill of him, and their hearts, that they hate them not extreamly.
                     For, the Enemie receyueth not ſo much pleaſure of that the Courtyer giueth him, as hee doeth griefe and diſpleaſure for that that is behinde yet in the Courtyers hands to giue him.
                     Now in the pallaces of Princes, it is a naturall thing, for eache man to deſire to aſpire, and to creepe into the Princes fauour: to bee able to doe much, and to bee more worth then others, and to commaund alſo. And as there are manie that deſire it, ſo are they very few in number, that by their vertues and demerits come to obtaine that high fauour.
                     It is a thing moſt ſure and vndoubted, that one alone, enioying his Princes grace and fauour, ſhall be hated in manner of the moſt part of the people.
                     The more they are Rich, Noble, and of great power, that are beloued, and accepted of Princes: ſo much the more ought they to bee circumſpect, and to liue in feare and doubt of ſuch diſgraces, and misfortunes, that may happen to them, ſith all &amp; euery mans eye is vppon them: and that they are the more enuyed, for that they can do much; and deſire alſo to take from them that authoritie and credite they haue, and to ſpoyle them of ſuch treaſures as they poſſeſſe, or haue gotten by the Princes fauour.
                     And in this caſe the Fauourite of the Courte muſt not truſte in the pleaſures hee hath done them: neyther in the fauor he hath ſhewed thē: much leſſe the fayned friendſhips they ſeeme to beare him, and that hee thinks he hath gotten of them: neither muſt he truſt too much his Friends, Neighbors, and Kinsfolkes, no nor his owne Brethren: But let him bee aſſured, that all thoſe that are not in the like ranke of Fauour, and eſtimation that hee is, (be hee of what degree or parentage hee will be, yea, and as neere a kinne as may bee) they will all bee in that his very mortall foes.
                     Authority to commaund, being the chiefe and higheſt point of honor and whereto euery man ſeekes to aſpire, and which was cauſe that Pompey became the deadly enemy of Iulius Caeſar his father in Law, Abſolon of Dauid his naturall father, Romulus of his brother Remus, Alexander of Darius, who ſhewed himſelfe before a father in loue, in bringing on him vp, and Marke Anthony of Auguſtus Caeſar his great friend. So that I ſay, it may well bee ſaide, that after diſdain and cankered ire, haue once poſſeſt the delicate breſt of man onely concerning honour and commaundement, that it is neuer thenceforth

recured of that infeſted ſore, neyther by gifts &amp; promiſes, and much leſſe by prayers and requeſts.
                     It is true the accepted of the prince may well bee free from all thyrſte and hunger, colde, and heate, warres, plague, and pouertie, and from all other calamityes and troubles of this our wretched life, but hee ſhall neuer be free from detractions of venomous and wicked tongues, and from ſpightfull and enuious perſons. For no leſſe is Enuie ioyned to fauour, then is thyrſt to a burning ague.
                     In this caſe it is impoſſible but that the Courtyer ſhould receyue manie times diſpleaſure and diſgraces in the Court, but not to giue eare to theſe detracters, and ill-ſpeakers of men.
                     To remedy theſe things, the Courtyer muſt needes ſeeme to let them know by his lookes and aunſwers, that hee is more offended with them, that come and tell him theſe lewde tales: then with thoſe that in deed did truely report them of him.
                     This counſell would I giue the courtyer, that what ill ſo euer hee heareth ſpoken of him, I would wiſh him not ſeeme to know it, and much leſſe to be angrie withall, nor once giue a diſtaſtfull word to the reporters thereof.
                     For, his choller ouer-paſte, the euill words hee hath ſpoken to them in his anger, may turne him to more diſpleaſure, then he hath done him hurt that cauſed him ſpeake theſe words.
                     And therefore ſurely to bridle the Tongue, is rather a diuine then a humane vertue: and chiefly in that inſtant, when the heart is maiſtered and ſubdued with Chollericke paſſions. For afterwards it happeneth many times, that being quiet againe in our mindes we are ſorry for that wee haue ſpoken in our anger: yea, againſt them that haue angred vs.
                     If the Courtyer ſhould weigh euery worde that is ſpoken againſt him, and eſteeme euery thing that is done to him, he ſhould purchaſe himſelfe a continuall and ſorrowfull life: yea, and out of meaſure, a troubleſome and vnpleaſant, ſith Princes courts are euer full of Serpents-tongues, and venomous harts, and that it lyeth not in mans power to let, that the hearts of men hate vs not, and that their tongues ſpeake not ill of vs.
                     I would aduiſe the Courtyer to take all the ill that is ſpoken of him, in ſporte and mirth, and not in anger.
                     
                        Seneca ſayde (and that wiſely ſpoken) that there is no greater reuenge to puniſh an iniurious word, then to A worthy ſaying of Seneca. ſeeme to laugh at it; For it is a thing more naturall and proper to women, then men to deſire to take reuenge of wordes, with the like words againe: ſith the noble heart that eſteemeth his honour, muſt not haue his handes in his tongue, but his tongue in his hands.
                     O how many haue we ſeene, both out of Court, and in Court, the which for no other reſpect, but to reuenge one onely ſilly word, that touched them not much, would put themſelus, their goods, and fame in perill: and yet in the end had not that reuenge, which they deſired, but rather redoubled it againſt themſelues, in looſing their fond and vaine attempt. Therefore to conclude thoſe that will bee great in fauour and eſtimation in the Princes Court, and thoſe alſo that are now in fauour and credite with the Prince, and that deſire to continue, and perſeuer in his fauour ſtill, muſt not make account of any wordes ſpoken to him, or offences done him: for all that are in fauour haue neede to ſuffer, and no occaſion to report.
                     Till this preſent day I neuer ſaw any that receiued any hurt or detriment by being patient: but being impatient, I haue ſeen numbers caſt thēſelus away: you muſt alſo know, that in all

places, where troupes and companies of people be, there is alwayes euer diſcords and diuerſities, in opinions and iudgements of men, So that it happeneth many times in a common-weale, yea, and it meeteth ſometimes in one houſe, that all ſhalbe of one bloud and kinred, yet in priuate willes; and affections, mortall enemyes. Kindred are not alwayes friends.
                     
                     And therefore, ſure it is a thing worthy to be noted, and no leſſe to be wondred at, to ſee the fathers with the ſonnes, the Vnckles with the nephews, the graund-fathers with the children, the ſonnes in Law with their fathers in Lawe: and Brothers with their brothers: and ſiſters, the one to be as farre different from the other as white and blacke, and as much friends as the dogge and the cat. And all this is cauſed only, for that they are rather wedded to a ſelfe-will and opinion they haues, then they are adicted to loue and affect that that nature bindeth them to.
                     We ſee alſo many young Courtiers, that though they be vertuous and Noble, (hauing inherited and ſucceeded in Nobilitie of bloud their Anceſtors) by meanes whereof they are honoured and reuerenced: and poſſeſſing alſo the greatneſſe, and abundance of their goods and riches, (which makes them wealthy, and maintaines them honourably) enioying the Noble parentage for which they are regarded, hauing many friends and ſeruants that doe them great ſeruice and pleaſure. And all in reſpect of their Noble Anceſtors: and yet notwithſtanding al theſe great things wee haue ſpoken, they follow their owne inuentions and imaginations, which their Anceſtors, knowing, would haue fled: and hate and miſlike that, they, doubtleſſe, being aliue would haue followed.
                     And therefore it is rather a token of lightneſſe then of good will, for one to leaue to helpe and relieue his owne friends and kinsfolks, to ſuccour and doe good to ſtrangers, or others, whom hee neuer knew, nor can tell what they are. For I aſſure you, that one of the greateſt loſſes and miſhaps that can come to a Noble houſe, is to haue new friendſhippe and parciality with ſtrangers and men vnknowne. That Gentleman that giueth himſelfe to follow ſuch a one as pleaſeth his fantaſie beſt, and that leaueth to leaue to thoſe whom his Anceſtors heretofore both loued and liked: ſhall ſee thoſe old friends, not onely leaue and forſake him, but cleane giue him ouer to his will: and ſhortly after ſhall finde his ſubſtance and faculty conſume and waſte away; beſides, the honour of his houſe to bee brought to vtter decay and obliuion.
                     And this we haue ſpoken, onely to aduiſe the Princes Officers, and ſuch as haue credite and authoritie, that they doe not with fauour ſupport and ayde any partiall ſect: namely, that that concerneth the ſtate and body of Common-wealth: for the eſteemed of the Prince, more eaſily, and with leſſe occaſion, doe vndoo themſelues, and loſe the credite they haue wonne: by reaſon of their partialiteis and factions they maintaine, then they doe for their daily benefites and ſuits they importune the Prince in.
                     Wherefore the ſeruants and Officers of the Kings houſe, although they bee in good fauour with the Prince, and that it pleaſe him to like well of them, yet they may not ſo hardly ſupport any to doe hurt to others, and ſo abſolutely, as if they were the Lords and Princes themſelues.
                     For albeit it pleaſeth the King to call them, to honour, and to enrich them with goods and poſſeſſions, yet the King cannot, nor will not like that they ſhall bee ſuborners of factions,

and quarels amongſt their ſubiects in the Common-wealth.
                     And yet neuertheleſſe it happeneth many times, that thoſe that ſee themſelues onely in fauour aboue others, will preſume to doe violence and wrong to others, truſting to their great fauour they are in, that that ſhall ſuffice to cloke and hide any fault they ſhall commit, which they neuer ought to think, nor yet for any reſpect in the world to doe. For ſuch vnhaply might be the crime they doe commit, that although it be in the Princes power to doe great things for them, yet he could not at that time with his honor excuſe their offence, nor ſeeme to protect them in their lewdneſſe, without great murmour and diſcontentation of his ſubiects.
                     I know very well, that in Court the mindes, affections, and opinions of Courtiers are ſo diuers and variable, and notwithſtanding the beloued of the Prince endeauour himſelfe all hee can poſsible to pleaſe and content euery man in Court, yet of all impoſſibilities, it is a thing moſt impoſsible euer to attaine to it, to winne all mens good willes.
                     Neuertheleſſe, hee muſt ſo trimly and wiſely behaue himſelfe in all his doings, that thoſe, at leaſt, whom he cannot with all his pollicy and deuice make his friends, haue not yet any iuſt occaſion giuen them to bee his enemies. I ſee there is no meane, no reaſon, no deuice nor pollicy of man, fauour nor negligence, that can defend the honoured and eſteemed of Court from detraction and enuy.
                     Therefore I will boldly giue him this aduice with him that in matters of Iuſtice and other publike affayres, he beare himſelfe ſo vpright, that notwithſtadding they repine at his authoritie and credite: yet that they haue no cauſe offered to complayne of him.
                     The Courtyer is forced to complaine when his owne familiar companyons and fellow-ſeruants of the Prince, in his matters of contenion or quarrell ſtep between them, not to part them, but rather to the contrary to contend with them, and ioyne in demaund of that they ſtriue for: which the luckles Courtyer is very apt to know, although hee dares not diſcouer it.
                     For many times he ſuppoſeth it leſſe euill to ſuffer the perſecution of the enemie, then to fall into the diſgrace of the beloued, and eſteemed about the Prince.
                     For the reputed of the Prince, commonly thinke they doe much for the Common-weale, in bearing and fauouring ſome, and in puniſhing and perſecuting others.
                     For thoſe that are of great authoritie, profeſſing honour and reputation, and that feare ſhame: would rather themſelues to be defamed &amp; reiected, then to ſee their enemies aduanced, or prefered to the fauor of the Prince, or of thē that be in fauor with the prince: And the beloued or officers of the Prince may not thinke, that the fauor they giue to one againſt an other, can bee kept ſecret, and that it cannot come to light: for in ſo doing they are deceiued: For in deed there is nothing more manifeſt or known in the Common-wealth, then the doings &amp; practiſes of thoſe that are in fauour and authority, yea euen to the very words they ſpeake:
                     Thoſe that are agrieued, and haue to complaine of ſome iniury done them, or alſo thoſe that are euen the familiars of the fauoured, and that doe but aſpire dayly to grow in greater credite with their Prince then others, doe not ſee any thing ſaide or done to others, that are in better credit, then themſelus, be it in eating, drinking, watching, ſleeping, in play, beeing quiet or buſie, but they ſuddenly go &amp;

report it, and tell it to ſom other that is in fauour, to enter and to encreaſe alwayes into greater fauour and truſt with them.
                     If there happen any diſcention or enmity amongſt the people in the cō
                        mon weale or realme, the eſteemed of the Court muſt beware in any caſe, they put not in their hand: &amp; if they do at all, that it be but to pacifie them, and to make them good friendes againe, and not to diſcouer thē worſe then they were before: For if he do otherwiſe, all theſe quarrels in the end ſhall ceaſe, they being reconciled together, and now made perfect friends and to him they wil all ſhew themſelus open enemies.
                     And therfore it behoueth the fauored of Princes to behaue themſelues ſo wiſely towards them that are at diſcord and variance together, that both the one ſide and the other ſhould bee glad and well pleaſed, to make him arbitrater between them, to decide both their cauſes, without any ſuſpition that they haue of him, be it neuer ſo little, of partiality, of eyther part.
                     The ſame day that the fauoured of the Court ſhall take vpon him to beare any priuate affection to any of the Common weale, and that hee rather leane to one party, or to an other: the ſelfe ſame day and houre he ſhall put in great hazard his perſon, and not without great danger to looſe his goods, together with the fauour and credit of his Prince. And the ſecrete enemies he hath, through the enuie they beare him, ſhould ſuffice him, yea rather too much, by reaſon of his fauour and credit; without ſeeking anie new enemies, for that he ſaith or doth. Such as are great with the Prince, and that flye the paſſions, affections, and partialities of the Common-weale, may be aſſured they ſhall bee beloued ſerued, and honoured of all: but if they ſhall doe the contrary, they may truſt to it likewiſe, that their enemies wil be reuenged of them, becauſe they did purſue them: And their friends alſo will complaine of them, becauſe they did not fauour their cauſe as they ought. Therfore let not the beloued thinke, if he dare beleeue me, that by hauing onely the fauour of the perſon of the Prince, it is inough for him to gouerne and rule the whole Realme at his pleaſure: For although it cannot be denyed, that to haue ſo great a friend as the perſon of a King, it is a great aduantage and commodity, and that he may do much: yet wee muſt graunt alſo, that many enemies are able to hurt vs, and do vs great iniurie. And therefore my aduiſe ſhould be, that euery wiſe man, hauing one friend, ſhould beware to haue an other enemy.

                        SVurely it is a great ſeruitude &amp; trouble Great ſeruitude and trouble to liue in the Court. to liue in court, continually, but it is far greater when it is enforced of neceſſity, by reaſon of ſutes and troubles, and yet greateſt and moſt intolerable, whē they cannot obtain a ſhort and briefe diſpatch according to their deſire; for waying well the manner and conditions of the Court, that Suiter may reckon himſelfe happily diſpatched, euery time that he is quickly diſpatchd, although his diſpatch bee not according

to his mind. And I ſpeake it not without a cauſe, that he may reckon himſelfe well dispatched when he hath his anſwere: For without compariſon, it is leſſe ill of both: for the poore Suiter that attends on the Court, to be preſently denyed his Suit, then to continue him long with delayes, as they they do now a daies, the more is the pitty.
                     If the poore Suters that goe to the Court, did know certainely that the delay made in their Suites were for no other occaſion but for to dispatch them well, according to their deſire, although it were not ſo reaſonable, yet were it tollerable, the paines and trouble that they abide. But if the poore miſerable and wretched creatures haue great trouble in trauerſing the Lawe, and abiding their orders: obtaining it neuertheleſſe in the end with great labour and toyle: yea and contrary to their expectation: haue they not yet matter ynough trow yee to complaine of? yes ſure, enough to make them despaire.
                     Whatſoeuer he be therefore that goeth to the Court to be a Suiter for any matter of import, let him determine and thinke with himſelfe he ſhal not obtaine his ſuite, euen as he wold haue it: For if he ſhall feed himſelfe with certain promiſes, made in priuat, a thing common to Courtiers, to promiſe much, and performe nothing, with other vaine and fooliſh thoghts: the great hope he ſhall conceiue of their ſmokes of Court, muſt needes giue him afterwards occaſion to deſpayre when hee ſeeth the promiſe vnperformed. The court is a Sea ſo deep, a pilgrimage ſo incertaine, that there wee dayly ſee nought els, but Lambes ſwim with ſafety in the deepeſt chanel, and elephants down in the ſhalloweſt foord. To go ſue, to ſerue, to trauell, &amp; to ſolicite in the Court of Princes, may aptly be likened and compared to thoſe that put too many rich iewels to the Lottery in open market: in which it happeneth very oft, that hee that hath put in a 100. lots, ſhall not happen perhaps of one, and an other that only hath but in one, fortune ſhal ſo fauour him, that he ſhall euer after be made a rich man. The like we may ſay to him that hath liued ſo long in Court, that he hath not onely gotte him a beard, but it is alſo now becom a gray beard: and yet in all this long time of his ſeruice, he hath not gotten him any certainety, or ſtay of liuing to liue honeſtly, withall to maintaine his aged yeares in quiet: and he may well ſay, that all the lots haue beene vnfortunat to him which he put in aduē
                        ture. It is true that to be called a good and vertuous man, it ſufficeth to haue a ſharpe witte, and good head: but to become rich, he muſt only haue good fortune. And this is plainely ſeene in the Court, that ſome in 4. monethes wil grow great like a Melon, and ſome other in 40. yeares will neuer beare but little fruit like a palme tree.
                     We haue told you all theſe things, to this end, onely to remember thoſe that goe to the Court of Princes, to follow any fuite, or to continue a A leſſon for him that meaneth to be a Courties. Courtier ſtill, that in any caſe they carry a purſe with them, full of money, and a heart armed with patience. Oh what pitty is it euery way to ſee him that is a Suiter in the Court, to bee long haled with a tedious ſuite, and in the end not to obtain any partof his deſire, without a little pleaſing winde of court: for if he wil haue his ſuite go forward, &amp; take good ſucceſſe, and haue it ſpeedily granted, he muſt firſt buy it of God with bitter tears, and after of the king with hūble interceſſion, of the Secretaries with promiſes, and of the vſhers with preſents, and of the beloued, and in authority, with infinit ſeruice: ſo that to conclude, far greater is the rewarde they craue

then the value, of the fauour or benefite they beſtow.
                     If I haue diſcourſed vnto you ſufficiently what the vnlucky Suters haue done and do: you ſhall further know what they thinke and doe imagine, as it falleth out true.
                     The ſely ſoules they paſſe the nights in watch, deuiſing continually: not in what Church the next day they may heare the diuine Seruice, but onely by what meanes they may procure to come to the Fauourites of the Court, to ſpeake one word vnto them.
                     The poore Suter (vnskilfull of courtly practiſe) belieueth, that when hee hath once exhibited a bill or memoriall of his Sute, to the Maiſter of Requeſts: or that he hath ſpoken a word or two, to any one in fauour with the Prince, that ſtraight-wayes, without further delay he ſhall be diſpatched of his Sute, and that he ſhall not need to ſue any more. But alas, they are deceiued, &amp; preuented of their expectation.
                     For, the vnhappie Suter ſhall bee no ſooner out of his ſight, but they preſently forget all that hath bin ſaide vnto them: yea and peraduenture his minde ſo occupied, that his bill of Memoriall is alſo torne in pieces, and his Sute and bill committed to flying aire.
                     The affayres of the warres are done by force and neceſſitie, and thoſe of Friends by Good-will: but thoſe of the By what meanes affaires are diſpatched. 
                        miſerable Suters of the Court, by money or great importunitie.
                     So that it followeth, that hardly any man obtayneth the ende of his Sute, (bee his Right neuer ſo good) without great diligence, and painefull toyle. And many times the poore Suter of the Court departeth from his owne houſe, and goeth to the Court, on hope and deliberation to be diſpatched in two moneths: and afterwards the poore miſerable man ſhall ſpend aboue ſixe moneths there without diſpatch. But all this is nothing, to the griefe and diſpleaſure hee ſhall feele in the ende, if with better iudgement he meaſure and conſider, the pleaſure and felicitie hee might haue had at home, with the troubles and diſpleaſures hee abideth in the Court. For, making account with his purſe, hee ſhall perhaps finde all his money ſpent, ere his ſute in manner be begunne.
                     I tolde you but of a little wonder, to tell you that all his yll conſiſted in the emptying of the purſe. For, indeede I ſhould haue ſaide better, and more truely: telling you that hee had ſolde his Nagge, layde his Sworde in gage, baratted his cote and cloke, and of two ſhyrts he brought, the one hee ſolde: ſo that the poore-man hath no more left to chop, nor ſell. And yet moreouer, mee thinks I tell you little.
                     If I ſhew you not alſo, that after he hath conſumed all his Money that hee brought in his Purſe, ſolde, chopped, and layd to gage all the Apparell that hee had, hee is notwithſtanding all this enforced for debt, to gage to his Hoſt, all that remains behind, to ſatisfie him for his lodging. So that when he commeth home to his own houſe, he may ſay truely: That hee commeth home weary, aſhamed, conſumed, and all that he hath at gage.
                     
                     Hee that determineth to be a ſuter at the Court, is wont before he go from home, to make account what hee will ſpend euery day ordinarily: but what he ſhall ſpend extraordinarily, againſt his will, that he neuer reckons of.
                     And therefore I would counſell him for the beſt, if he put ten crownes in his purſe, for ordinary charges, let him alſo put ten crownes more for extraordinarie. For, it is impoſſible hee ſhould euer keepe an order and meaſure in ſo great a diſorder. For many times courtiers are compelled for their honor &amp; reputations ſake, to inuite their hoſts &amp; owners of the lodgings where they lie, and beſides the great charges they are

at the way, yet come there vnbidden to dinner and ſupper a company of Ieſters, players of Enterludes, Minſtrels and Muſitians, or other pleaſant companions, whom he cannot refuſe and turne away for honeſties ſake, but muſt needs make them eate and drinke beſides the reward they looke for.
                     So that when hee hath made his account of ten or twenty ſhillinges charges for his dinner or ſupper, let him looke in his purſe, and hee ſhall finde theſe mates haue pickt vp in rewards as much as the whole charges of his dinner or ſupper beſides.
                     Moreouer, they are dayly viſited of their friends and kinsfolks, and victuals are ſo deare, and of ſo exceſſiue price, that to make their prouiſion at the beſt hand, they muſt ſend out poſtes and Lackyes into all partes to be their Puruayers. And yet are they further recharged, that many times their ſeruants robbe them of all their money, and runne their way when they haue done, and ſomtimes they muſt new array themſelues, all which things the Courtier (in reſpect of his eſtimation) is bound to do thorowly, and with the beſt manner, or elſe to ſequeſter, and baniſh himſelfe from Court and Courtiers life. It is true that a poore Gentleman or other Suiter (that of neceſſity muſt follow the Court) knoweth very well the cauſe that moueth him to bee a Courtier, and attendant on the court; but yet hee ſhall not know what his charge and expence will be about that ſuite.
                     If hee haue any fauour or credite in the Court, hee may happilie obtaine a quicke and ready diſpatch, and ſo perhaps ſaue ſome part of his money in his purſe he determined for to ſpend, without which, hee ſhall not onely be enforced to borrow, but to ſend a new meſſenger to his houſe for more money. O more is the pitty, how many haue I ſeene in Princes Courtes ſpend all that euer they brought to the Court to follow their ſuit, and yet could not be diſpatched in any thing they came for, ſaue in ſtead of their money they conſumed, they purchaſed them great troubles &amp; diſpleaſurs bewayling their loſt time, and vaine expence.
                     And it is to be conſidered alſo, that if it be a great difficulty to ſpeake to the Prince in our matter, to the Preſident of the Councell, to the Maſter of the Requeſts, and to the Priuie Councell, to the Marſhals of the houſe, to the Treaſurers, to the Cofferers, and to the fouriers, and to the fauoured of the Court, it is farre greater and more trouble to entertain, and content their ſeruants and officers.
                     For I dare aſſure you, you ſhall ſooner and more eaſily winne the loue of the Maſter, then you ſhall obtaine the fauour and good will of the Seruant.
                     Princes are contented if wee obey How the ſeruants and Officers of the Court muſt be entreated. them; the fauoured of the court if wee ſerue them: but the ſeruantes are neuer contented, nor in quiet, if they ſee wee doe not entreate them, and worſhip them. And ſurely, I will not tell you a true tale, and will lye a worde to you. In thoſe dayes when I my ſelfe was alſo a Courtier in the Court of Princes, it ſtoode me vpon many times rather to trouble the maſters, then to pray the ſeruants. If perhaps for penance of his ſinnes) the ſuter ſhew himſelfe importunate in his affayres, and that he preſume to dareſay to him ſome nipping or vnpleaſāt word, let him bee well aſſured, he will not bee reuenged on him, to hurt him with ſword or lance: but onely in holding backe his penne, to delay him in his diſpatch: For I remember, that once being but a poore prieſt, I was entreted by the Procter of a Prouince

to ſay him a dozen of Maſſes for a great Noble Man, and in great fauour and eſtimation in the Court, that had his matter in his hands, &amp; he Conjured mee very earneſtly, that I ſhould not lay them for the health and ſaluation of his ſoule, but onely that GOD would inſpire him, and put into his minde to diſpatche him quickly of his buſines. Therefore as we haue ſpoken of the one, it is reaſon wee ſhould alſo ſpeake of the other.
                     And therefore I ſay, that there are ſome of theſe Officers and Clerkes of Iudges, Magiſtrates, Counſellours, Secretaries, Treaſurers, Marſhals, Fouriers, and other Officers alſo of the Court, that are ſo wiſe, and men of ſuch honeſty and ciuilitie, that the diſcourteſies and wrongs ſometimes their Lords and Maſters doe vnto vs: they doe the beſt they can eyther to take them from vs quite, or at the leaſt to leſſen or diminiſh them. For the contrary alſo, others there are ſo proud and ſhameles, ſuch tatlers, and vile perſons, and ſo vnconſcionable with all: of whom, as it is a great pleaſure for vs to ſee that they write, and to heare that they can ſpeake ſo well, and promiſe ſo liberally, onely to win your money, and to picke your purſe: ſo it is a great ſpight to vs, and more ſhame and reproch, and infamie for them, when afterwardes wee ſee the contrarie effects of their faire wordes, and fained promiſes, wherewith they ſeede vs continually.
                     And adding thereto alſo, wee ſee many times that ſuch a yong Courtier, in leſſe then foure yeares that hee hath remained in ſeruice with a Noble man, or other officer of the Kinges in the Court, hath gotten by his practiſe and policy a faire moile of great price: with her harneſſe all guilt, his coffers well filled, his tent for the field, with a field bedde and other furniture to it, his carpets on his Table, his cloths of Tapeſtrie ouer his dores, his gowns richlie furred for the Winter, &amp; thoſe of Sattin and Damaske, and Taffeta for the Summer: and yet notwithſtanding all this glory, he may poſſible keepe a Curtezan for his pleaſure, and maintaine her.
                     All which things conſidered, and put together, is impoſſible hee ſhould doe it by the gaines of his penne, or ſeruice, but onely by diſhoneſt meanes, and robbing of his Maſter. I ſaw once in my preſence a poore Suter, offer the Clerke of a Secretarie, eight Rials of ſiluer for to diſpatch him of his ſute, and hee refuſed them flatly, and would none of them, by no meanes, notwithſtanding, the poore man turned him vp the bottome of his purſe, and ſhewed him that he had but onely foure Rials left to bring him home withall: So the poore man came to me, and entreated me for to ſpeake to this Clerke for him, to perſwade The intollerable exaction of a Secretaries Clerke. him to take his money he offered him, and to diſpatch him ſince he had no more leſt then he ſhewed him. And I did ſo: And this worſhipfull Clerke made mee this vnhoneſt aunſwere.
                     
                        Sir, beholdmy face and complexion, and you ſhall finde that it is all of golde' and not of ſiluer. For I ſweare to you, by our bleſſed Lady of Lancet, that it is more then two yeares that I receyued for my paines no other but gold, and not ſiluer layde in my hands.
                     
                     It cannot bee but that ſeruaunt, that vaunts himſelfe to haue a face of golde, will one day put his Maſters face in the mire.
                     Now albeit we ſee the Kings officers, and others peraduenture vnder them, to ride on their nags with theyr foote clothes, to be braue in apparrel, to bee rich in Iewels, and happily to haue a hundred Crowns in his purſe, wee ſhould not maruell of it at all: but if wee haue cauſe to thinke any thing

ill in them: it is for that many times they play away more money fondly, then would ſerue any other man to ſpend in all his neceſſaries.
                     That officer or Clerke that hath not aboue a hundred Crownes in his purſe, and that in a night plaieth away two hundred crowns, what iudgemēt ſhall a man giue of him? but that eyther hee deceyueth others in his office or he ſtealeth &amp; pilfreth from his maſter or Lord, or elſe he exacteth vpon the poore Suters and racks them with all extremity, without conſcience and honeſty, and that hee will haue it on them, euen with plaine brawling? Yea and though theſe good fellowes bee liberall in play (as you haue heard) yet I warrant you they are not ſpare of diet neyther, but if they call their friends at a time to their table in the Hall, or elſe bid their Curtezan to ſome Garden, you may be aſſured they want no dainty meates, nor delicate wines to pleaſe their liking luſt: yea peraduenture with more copy, and better meate and drinke then their Maſters or lords haue any.
                     Here could I mate them with like companions to themſelues, that marchants prentizes, which for their lauiſh expence, their exceſſiue play, their luſty banquetting and feaſting, otherwhile their ſecret friends in gardens, and blinde tauernes, come not behind them at all in delicacy of fare, and in ſumptuous expence, but rather go before, and leaue them far behind.
                     And how thinke you, can theſe foule riots bee borne by any likelyhoode of the prentices owne ability? Nay ſure, of the Maſters coſt (as beſt able) whoſe purſe paieth for the good cheare, though hee good man fare at home but thinly.
                     But well, ſince it toucheth not our matter, I will returne againe where I left. All theſe thinges notwithſtanding, they are diſhoneſt, they are ſomtimes tolleruble, and to bee borne, ſo that with theſe faults they would bee diligent to diſpatch men, and eaſily to talke withall.
                     But alas, for pitty, wee ſee that for all theſe complaints they heare, and for all the requeſts and intreaty, that may be made to them, they will neuer take pen in hand before the poore ſuiter take his hand out of his purſe, that they may feele him a little.
                     We haue ſpoken all theſe thinges to admoniſh, remember, and beſeech the fauoured of the Prince, and other their officers, that neyther themſelues nor their ſeruants vnder them, be long and ſlow in diſpatching ſuch things as they haue charge, and chiefly of poor and miſerable Suters. For if we conſider the qualities and conditions of men, Wee ſee that to many Suiters it were leſſe detriment and more profit, to bee anſwered quickly (though they were denied) then diſpatched ſlowly (as to haue it graunted) to their great charge and long trouble: Truly, me thinkes it is a great ſecret of God to know, why all thoſe that are Suiters in the Court of Princes, and thoſe alſo whom wee ſue to are all mortall. And all the Suites that wee labour for, ſeeme, yea, to ſay more truly, are immortall.
                     And hereof wee ſee a dayly experience, that the Suiters dye, and their Some ſuiters dye, but their ſuites neuer haue end. ſuites liue for euer, being neuer determined. O excellent Art, and fine deuice of ſuite, that Courtiers are wont to vſe, that are gratefull to Princes, as for familiar example.
                     They find a way to put in a thouſand manner of lets to hinder and delay the ſutes, becauſe that when by tract of time, they haue more then halfe deſpayred the hopeleſſe Suiters: they then to reuiue them againe, and to make their honour ſeeme the greater, diſpatch them euen in a moment, without let or delay, and to the ſuiters

whole contentation. It is good reaſon the Noble Prince haue a regard of the things hee giues, and to whome they graunt them: and likewiſe of the Time and place. For, in receyuing fauour for a good turne, at the Princes hand, they ſometimes make more account and eſtimate of the Liberalitie, and bountifull minde of the Prince, then they will doe of the giftes themſelues.
                     Sure it is a good thing, and laudable, for thoſe that are continually about the perſon of the Prince, that they be eaſie to be ſpoken withall, pacient to heare, wiſe in aunſwering, of good fame in their life, and readie to The fauoured of the court ought to bee eaſily ſpoken with. diſpatch and doe good.
                     For being otherwiſe, they may be well aſſured they ſhall ſhew the marke and white for their enemies to ſhoote their piercing ſhafte at, and ſhall giue the Suters alſo occaſion to complaine and ſpeake ill of them.
                     And therefore to cut them ſhort, I giue them this counſell, that in thoſe things they are beſought, that they be not too harde to bee entreated: and in that they are requeſted, that they bee neuer too ſtraunge, nor drawing backe, much leſſe couetous: and in thoſe things that are giuen them, they bee neuer vnthankfull: and with thoſe that they are daylie conuerſant, that they bee very well aduiſed and conſidered: and thoſe thinges whereof they are aduertiſed, that they endeauour themſelues to keepe it in minde and memory, and neuer to forget it. And if they ſhal do otherwiſe, let them aſſure themſelues, and truſt vnto it, that if they in time of ſuite ſhall ſhut the dores againſt the poore ſuiters, that the common people alſo will neuer open their hearts once to ſerue or loue them: Princes ſeruantes ſhould ſo gouerne themſelues, that though there were found ſome ill perſons that diſpiſed them, for that they might doe much, and were of great authority: yet that there might bee many others alſo honeſt, that ſhould prayſe and commend them for the great good they doe.
                     That man that is enuied, diſprayſed, defamed, diſloued, and all thought of of all, ſhould thinke it leſſer ill to die honeſtly, thē to liue with ſhame and in diſgrace of euery man: For to ſay truely, me thinketh no man could liue a more bitter and hard life, although hee abode many ſorrowes, then to ſee him diſliked generally of the common weale.
                     It is an honeſt and naturall thing for men to endeauour themſelues by all diligence and induſtry to get much but it ſhould bee farre better, and much more worth, to procure themſelues good will: For in effect, nothing doth more ſatisfie and glad the heart, and maketh it more quiet, then to thinke that hee is beloued, and well accepted of all.
                     It is a moſt certaine Rule, that the foes and enemies of the fauoured Courtiers, neuer ioyne in friendſhip with others, but with thoſe whome they know to bee full of paſſions and quarrels like themſelues.
                     Of which detractors, if any one happen at times to go to the houſe of the honoured of the Court, vpon any occaſion of ſuite, and that they cannot preſently ſpeake with them: they will not ſay, I warrant you that he was buſie, and could not ſpeake with him, but that hee was ſo proud, and ſo haughty, that hee would not once heare nor ſee them.
                     Wee are ſo willing and forward in wiſhing well, and ſo ſelfe-willed and obſtinate in hating, that vpon a light occaſion many times wee doe loue thoſe wee loue, and with as much leſſe occaſion we defame and ſpeake il of thoſe wee hate. Therefore the fauored of Princes ſhal do great ſeruice to

                        GOD, and much profite to the Common-weale, if they giue order to diſpatch all Suters (high or low) ſpeedily: Since it is to the King onely that they impute the denyall of their Sutes, but for the delayes and prolongation of them, that only they lay to the charge of the Fauourites, and beloued of Princes.
                     And thoſe that are great with the Prince, may not excuſe themſelues, by reaſon of the numbers of matters they haue in their hands, For if he be alone, and that it lye in his hands only to diſpatch all, and that hee is not able to ſatisfie them all, it cannot bee but that ſome one of his Friends will aduertiſe the King that hee cannot doe all: and how the people complaine, and the poore-Suters finde themſelues agrieued: which purchaſe him great enemyes and yll-willers, by reaſon the Common-wealth is ſo altered.
                     So that he ſhall not tarry long, but the Prince vnderſtāding of theſe complaints, will ioyne a companyon with him, to eaſe him of ſome parte of his paines. And therfore the Noble princes and great Perſonages, ſhould admoniſh, and warne the Officers well, (whom they take to diſpatch matters) that they bee wiſe and Learned men, vertuous, and of good life: and that they bee not too partiall in theyr doings, nor too ſharpe and rough in their aunſwers. For many times there happen more Troubles, and ſiniſter vnlooked-for-chaunces, to Princes, and Noble-perſonages, for the vncurteous languages of their Officers and deputies, &amp;c: then for any euills that they themſelues doe commit.
                     And therefore thoſe that are in fauour and Authoritie with the Prince, What perſons ſhould be choſen for gouernors. muſt of neceſſitie foreſee, to chuſe vnder them ſuch perſons, to whom they giue the care and charge of their affaires and buſineſſes, to diſpatch mens matters and Sutes, that they be liberal of condition, pleaſant in their conuerſation, curteous in aunſwers, true in their wrytinges, eaſie and diligent in their diſpatches, very honeſt and modeſt in that they giue or take: and ſincere and perfite in all their other vertues, if it be poſſible.
                     So that they may euer be more carefull to get Friendes for their Lord and Maiſter, then money. For, like as the life of the maiſter of the Ship conſiſteth, and dependeth in the onely guiding and iudgement of the skilfull Pylote, and the conſcience of the Iudge in his Conſtitute, the goods of the Marchaunt in the iuſt dealings of his Factor, and the victorie of the Noble Prince, in his valiaunt Captaine: Euen ſo likewiſe doth the honour of the fauoured conſiſt in thoſe hee hath choſen officers vnder him for the diſpatch of mens affayres.
                     And although the ſeruant of the beloued bee no partaker with his Maſter of his favor with the Prince, yet hee is a coadiutor to him, to ſupport his credite and fauour, and many times alſo a ready meane vtterly to vndoe his Maſter, and to diſhonour him for euer.
                     The like watch and care the good Biſhoppe hath ouer his flocke, for to preach vnto them the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt: the ſelfe ſame ought the magiſtrates and higher powers haue to their Officers that are vnder them, in taking heed they be not ſlow and negligent in diſpatching ſuch buſineſſe as as they haue in charge, that they bee not diſhoneſt of life, preſumptuous in demaunding, and falſe in their writing: for the leaſt of theſe faults ſufficeth vtterly to vndoe the Seruant, &amp; alſo to defame the maſter.
                     And therefore ſo ſoone as the beloued of the Court haue any ſuſpition in the World, or inckling, be it neuer ſo little, that his Seruant is growne to be proud, diſhoneſt, and of a naughty

conſcience, he ought not onely immediately to correct him for it: but to put him out of his ſeruice forthwith, and to turne his coate ouer his eares. Otherwiſe they will murmur ſo much at the ſeruant that doth all theſe faults, as at the Maſter that will not ſee them, and ſuffereth them. Therefore the reputed of Court, muſt firſt ſee, and peruſe ouer the writings and doings of their ſeruants and Secretaries, before they diſpatch them out of their hands and to moderate their gaine with reaſon that is due to them.
                     Otherwiſe their enemies might iuſtly ſay, that they keepe not ſuch vnder them, to diſpatch poore men that ſue to their Maſters, but rather to ſpoyle and robbe them.
                     And therefore they were better to augment their wages they giue thoſe officers and ſeruants, then to conſent or diſſemble with their theft: For ſo doing, the ſeruant can neuer riſe in wealth, but the Maſter muſt needs diminiſh in honour.
                     It may happen many times, that the eſteemed of the Court ſhall bee ſo occupied in the affayrs of the Common weale, that he cannot though he wold giue audience to the Suiters.
                     But when they are thus occupyed that they cannot in deed, they muſt then commaund their ſeruants and officers, that they courteouſly entreate them, and heare them, and not checke or rebuke them, and call them importunate ſuters: For it is no reaſon, that for diſpatch of their buſineſſe, the poor ſoules ſhould be laden with iniurious words.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XIII. That the beloued of the Court beware they bee not proud and high minded: for lightly they neuer fall but thorow this wicked vice.
                     
                     
                        WEe reade that Rhehoboam ſucceeded his Father in 12 realmes that were his, althogh they were but ſmall realmes, who beeing requeſted and exhorted by the graue The cruelty of Rhehoboam, and his puniſhment. aged men of his Realme, to be courteous and temperate, and not greedy, nor auaricious in recouering the tributes and ſubſidies the other Realmes gaue him, and to bee merciful, and pittifull in puniſhing the offences committed, anſwered them thus.
                     My Father beate you onely with ſimple whippes, but I will not ſcourge you with whippes, but plague you with Scorpions: for my little finger is greater then was his whole arme.
                     Which happened very ill to him, that for to chaſtice the proude and arrogant words he ſpake to them, and to puniſh him for his wicked doings and enormities committed, they afterwardes reuolted againſt him, and tooke from him eleuen of his Realms and all his friendes forſooke him: ſo that as hee augmented in greatneſſe of his fingers, hee diminiſhed as much in his Realmes and riches.
                     So great was the pride likewiſe of King Pharaoh, that not contented that God had pardoned him his ſins, and with the ten plagues he had ſent him, did yet notwithſtanding reſiſt and purſue the people of Iſrael.
                     
                     
                        
Wherefor the ſea that was made a plaine paſſage and high way, for the ſafeguard of the children of Iſrael his enemies, was prepared a ſepulture for him and his.
                     
                        Pompey the Great alſo being in Aſia, when it was told him that he ſhold leuie his power, and prepare his men to be in readineſſe to reſiſt the battell that Iulius Caeſar came to giue him, with a great fury he ſtamped his foote vpon the ground, and proudly ſpake theſe words.
                     Next to the Gods I feare no mā, no not all mortall men, although they all were bent againſt mee, my power being ſo great, that I am able to deſtroy Iulius Caeſar, and all his power comming againſt me: And not onely the Realmes of Aſia ſhall fight for Pride was the ouerthrow of Pompey, &amp; many other Princes. mee, but alſo I will commaund the ground that I tread on to riſe againſt him.
                     But what was the fatall end of Pompeyes pride? His Captaines loſt the battell, his children their Realmes and Seigniories, and hee in fine his head, Rome her Liberty, &amp; his friends their liues.
                     The Emperour Domitian alſo was ſo vicious in his doings, and ſo proud in his thoughts, that he openly commaunded the Gouernours and Magiſtrates of his Realme in all their Edicts and proclamations to ſay theſe words:
                     Domitian, our God, and our Prince, commaundeth that this thing bee done: But loe the finall end of his pride, in taking vppon him the name of a god, by conſent and counſell of his wicked wife Domitia, hee had ſeuen deadly wounds giuen him in his bedde with a dagger. And thus wofully he ended his glorious life.
                     
                        Plutarch alſo recounteth that king Demetrius was the proudeſt Prince that euer raigned; For hee was not contented to ſee himſelfe ſerued of all men like a great and mighty Prince, as he was, but hee made them alſo honour him as a god, And he would not ſuffer any ſtraunge Ambaſſadours to come into his preſence, but they ſhold be apparrelled like Prieſts.
                     
                        Haman was alſo very familiar with the King Aſſuerus, and although all thoſe of his Realme did him great ſeruice, and that ſtrangers had him in great veneration, and did honor him maruellouſly, yet was there a glorious Mardocheus, that would neuer do him reuerence, nor once put off his cappe to him: by reaſon whereof this Haman that was in ſo great fauour commaunded a gybbet of fifty yardes high to bee ſet vppe for Mardocheus, whom hee would haue hanged on that gibbet, to be reuenged on him for the iniury he had done him: But the Diuine wil of God was ſuch, and fortune did permit it, that on the ſame Gallowes Hamon thought to haue put Mardocheus to death, on the ſelfe ſame himſelfe was hanged.
                     
                        Themiſtocles and Ariſtides were 2. famous men among the Greekes, and becauſe they were both great Princes and Philoſophers, and had in great reputation of all thoſe that knew them, there was ſuch a ſecret emulation and ambition betweene them, the one to raigne ouer the other, that both aſpiring, each to commaund other, there followed great diſorders and oppreſſions of the ſubiects of their Common-Weale.
                     Wherefore Themiſtocles moued with pitty and compaſſion of ſo great a Tirant, which for their ſakes, their Common weale endured, one day in the Market place before all his people with a loude voyce, hee ſpake theſe words.
                     Know you, O you people of Athens, that if you doe not lay handes on my exceeding preſumption, and on the ouer great ambition of Ariſtides,
                        
that our Gods will bee offended, the temples will fall down to the hard foundation, our treaſures will bee conſumed, our ſelues deſtroyed, and our common weales brought to vtter ruine and decay. Therefore once againe, good people, I ſay, bridle theſe our inordinate and vnſpeakeable affections betime, leſt the reines layde in our neckes be runne too farre. O golden wordes of a Prince, and worthie eternall fame.
                     
                        Lucanus alſo, when hee would reproue the pride and preſumption of the Romane Princes ſayde, that Pompey the great could neuer abide to haue any for his companion or equall with him within Rome: And Iulius Caeſar alſo wold neuer ſuffer that there ſhould bee any greater in the Worlde then himſelfe. And therefore to diſcourſe a little of this abominable and horrible vice of pride, we haue not without great reaſon layde before you theſe approued examples, before wee beginne to reproue it: For in al things the examples wee ſhew you, are wont to moue vs more, then the reaſons we ſeeme to tell you of. For that which I haue ſeene, for that I haue read, and for that I haue heard ſay alſo of others I am moſt aſſured and reſolued therof, that by the onely cauſe of this wicked ſinne of pride, proceedeth the ruine and vtter decay of all our greateſt Pride the ruine and decay of all things. things and affayres of this life for by all other ſinnes a man may indeede diſcend and decline from his degree and ſtate of honour and eſtimation: but by this onely ſinne hee cannot chuſe but hee muſt fall downe flat to the ground.
                     They finde out the middeſt and center of the earth, the depth of the ſea, and the higheſt toppes of Riphey Mountaines, the end of the great mount Caucaſus, and the beginning of the great floud Nile, and only the little heart of man, touching deſire to rule and commaund, can neuer finde ende.
                     The inſatiable couetouſneſſe is ſuch, that it cannot bee contented with the things wee haue, but onely with thoſe wee repute of leſſe price: Likewiſe Ambition &amp; pride to commaund, cannot bee contained within boundes, but onely by obeying: For neuer no vice can haue end, if hee that haue it, doe not leaue it, and baniſh it from him.
                     After Alexander the Great had conquered all Aſia, and had ſubdued the great India, he was one day reproued of the great Philoſopher Anacharſes, 
                        The ſpeech of Anacharſes the Philoſopher to Alexander. who tolde him theſe words. Sith thou art now, O Alexander, Lord of the earth, why doeſt thou weary thy ſelfe ſo much in thy affayres, as no paine ſeemeth troubleſome to thee? To whom Alexander anſwered. Thou haſt tolde mee many times, Anacharſes, that beſides this world, there are alſo three others. And if it bee ſo as thou ſayeſt, how great a reproach and infamy it were to me, that being three other worlds, I ſhould bee Lord but onely of one. Therefore I doe dayly ſacrifice to the Gods, that though they take mee out of the life of this World, yet at leaſt they will not deny mee of ſo glorious a conqueſt. I confeſſe that the Scriptures excepted I haue no wordes ſo riſe in memorie as theſe, whereby may eaſily be perceyued, that for to quiet and to content a proud and haughty heart, the ſeigniorie of the whole World is not yet ſufficient, and how ended the pride of this glorious prince? euen thus.
                     Hee that hoped for to conquere, and to bee Lorde of three other Worldes, did not rule this one onely aboue three yeares. Wee may boldly ſay this, and ſweare it, and may alſo plainely proue it, to any that deſire to ſee it, that he wanteth both

wit and knowledge that taketh vppon him to bee proud and preſumptuous: For the more hee looketh into himſelfe, and reconſidereth and conſidereth his ſtate and calling, and what he is, hee ſhall finde in him a thouſande occaſions, fitte to humble him, but neuer a one onely to make him proude and naughty. How great, rich, mighty, noble and worthy ſoeuer the perſon be, euery time that wee happen to ſee him, and that we haue no acquaintance of him.
                     And that we deſire to know what hee is, wee doe not aske of what Element, of what Sea, of what Fire, of what Planet, of what Climat, of what Sunne, of what Moone, nor of what ayre, but onely of what Countrey hee is of, and where he was born: For wee are all of the earth, wee liue in the earth, and in the end wee haue to turne into the earth, as to our naturall thing.
                     If the Planets, and the beaſts could helpe vs with the Inſtrument and benefite of the tongue, they would take from vs the occaſions of vaine glory: For the ſtarres woulde ſay, that they were created in the firmament, the Sunne in the Heauens, the birdes in the ayre, the Salamander in the fire, and the fiſh in the water: but onely the vnhappy man was made of earth, and created in the earth. So that in that reſpect, wee cannot glory to haue other kinsfolke neerer to vs, then are the wormes, the flyes, and horſe-flyes. If a man did conſider wel what he were, hee would aſſertaine vs that the fire burns him, water drowns him, the earth wearies him, the ayre troubles him, the heate grieues him, the colde hurtes him, and the day is troubleſome to him, the night ſorrowfull, hunger and thirſt makes him ſuffer, meate and drinke filles him, his enemies dayly follow him, and his friendes forget him: So that the time a man hath to liue in this wretched world, cannot be counted a life, but rather a long death.
                     The firſt day, wee ſee one borne, the ſelfe ſame we may make reckoning that he beginnes to dye: and although that perſon liued amongſt vs a hundred yeares after in this world, wee ſhould not ſay therefore that he liued a long time, but onely that he tarried a great time to dye.
                     Therefore that perſon that hath his life tyed to ſo many tributes, I cannot deuiſe, or thinke with my ſelfe why, or wherfore he ſhould be proud. But now returning againe to our purpoſe, let vs ſay, &amp; exhort the ſeruants and familiars of Princes, that they take heede they bee not proude and preſumptuous. For it ſeldome hapneth, that the fauoured of Kinges and Princes fall out of fauour and credite for that they haue, or can doe much, nor for that they craue and deſire much: but for that they are too bold and preſume too much. For in the Court of Kings and Princes, there is nothing more hurtfull and leſſe profitable, then pride &amp; preſumption: For oft times the ouerweening of the Courtier, and the fooliſh vaine pride The fauourites of princes ought to beware of pride. and reputation, he hath of himſelfe, bringes him to bee in the Princes diſgrace, and makes the people alſo to be offended and angry with him: For till this day wee neuer ſaw, nor heard tell of any that euer got into the Princes fauour and credite, for that he was proude and high minded, but onely for that hee hath ſhewed himſelfe an humble, obedient, courteous, louing, and a faithfull ſeruant. I would bee of this minde, that the Courtier that ſeeth hee is receyued into fauour in the Princes Courte, ſhould euer waxe better in ſeruing well, then grow worſe in preſuming too much.
                     And I dare boldly ſay &amp; affirm that it

is a meere point of Follie, by his pride and raſhneſſe to looſe all that in one day, that by great good Fortune hee hath attained vnto in many yeares.
                     And though that the Fauoured Courtyer (ſubiect poſſible to his Fantaſticall humour) be ſomtimes ouercome with choler or carnall deſire, drawne with auarice, and addicted to the gorge, enuironned with enuie, plunged in ſlouth and ydlenes, or ſome other vice and imperfection, it ſhall not skill much, neyther be any great wonder: ſince all mankinde is ſubiect to thoſe paſſions: and neyther the Prince, nor the Commonweale, will reckon much of that.
                     For, of all theſe faultes and vices, there can come no greater hurte vnto him, ſaue only that the common people would murmure againſt him. But his pride and Peacockes glorie once knowne and eſpied, euery man caſteth his eyes vppon him, to beholde his Princely gate, and curſeth him, in word and deede.
                     Therefore let a man bee in as great fauour as hee can deuiſe to be, as worthy, Noble, Rich, and of as great power and authority as hee deſireth to be: I neuer ſaw any ill in all my life, if with all theſe vertues hee were prowde and high-minded, but in the ende he was perſecuted of manie, and hated and enuyed of all.
                     For thoſe that are in greateſt fauor about the Prince, haue ſecret enemies enough to hinder theyr credite, although they doe not purchaſe nowe, to accuſe them of their pride and preſumption. And as we are taught by experience, the burning coale cannot onely be kept aliue, except it bee couered with the hote ymbers thereon. I meane, that the fauour of the Prince cannot bee long maintained, without good bringing vppe, and ciuill manners, gentle conuerſation, and Familiaritie.
                     The great men of authoritie about the Prince, runne eftſoones into great and many dangers: and this happeneth, becauſe they would not bee reproued in any thing whatſoeuer they doe, much leſſe heare any words that ſhould diſpleaſe them, neyther can they abide to be tolde of their faultes, much leſſe ſuffer to bee corrected for them.
                     Neyther doe they ſuffer willingly to be counſelled in any thing, be it of neuer ſo great weight &amp; importance, neyther would they haue any companion with them, in fauour with the Prince: but they deſire to be both on the right hand of the Prince, and on the left: ſtill they onely would be the fauored of the prince, and none other: aſpyring to gouerne them, in all theyr doings, and to bee thought and reputed the ſole and onely rulers of the affayres of the prince, and his commonweale, and to be belieued in all things of the prince, and to be obeyed alſo of the common-people.
                     Thoſe therefore that are continually reſident in the Courts of princes, and that haue the chiefeſt roomes and Offices in the Court, let them well conſider, and keepe in memorie this one word, which I will tell them: And that is this as followeth▪
                     
                     That the firſt day they take vppon them to bee ſuperintendents and gouernors of the Common-weale, euen in the ſelfe-ſame day they ſhall put in hazard their honour, fauour, and credit, how great ſoeuer they be. For, with great difficulty are the leaſt things the prince himſelfe comandeth, executed or done in his Realme, or Commonweale: and therefore may the fauored of the Court ſee, how much more hard it is for him to rule, (as ſole and abſolute Lord) the affaires of the Realme, and to be obeyed in the Commonweal: ſince the King himſelfe cannot doe it, by his Regall authoritie.
                     
                        
And therfore the leſſe he ſhall deſire to meddle with the affaires of the people, the more ſhall he liue in quiet and contented: For naturally the common people are ſo vnſtable, and vncertaine in their doings, vnthankefull of benefites receyued, and ſo ingratefull of a good turne done them: that the beloued of the Court, or any other perſon in fauour with the Prince can neuer doe any thing for the people (be it neuer ſo well) but they will ſpeake ill, and miſlike of him, and find fault with ſome of his doings.
                     It is impoſſible that thoſe, that will commaund many thinges in the Court of Princes ſhould alwayes doe their things ſo, but they ſhould ſomtime tread awry.
                     And admit their faultes bee but light, and of ſmall moment, yet they may bee aſſured there will be enough that will both open them to the common weale, and tell them alſo ſecretly to the Prince alone.
                     For thoſe that ſeeke to diuorce the fauored of the Court from the Prince, doe not complaine or finde fault for that they are more in fauour with the Prince then others, but they will ſhew they take it in ill part, they haue more authority and commaund then others in the Common-weale: Saying, that by meane of their place and authority, and vnder colour of good zeale, to miniſter iuſtice, they giue commonly foule and iniurious words, farre vnfit for the authority of the perſon, and worthineſſe of the place: ſo that it cannot be otherwiſe choſen, but that continuing this diſorder, they muſt needes make the king ſuſpect them, and beſides that bring a diſcorde betwixt the king and thoſe that hee fauoureth, and make him maruellouſly offended with them: For in the end, Princes would alwayes be ſerued, and obeyed, but not ruled and commanded. And it is a moſt true ſaying. Ouer-much familiaritie breedeth contempt. which although it may be borne, betweene men of like degree: and coequalitie, yet is it not tollerable, between the prince &amp; the fauored of the Prince. But rather euery day, houre, moment, that the Fauoured Courtyer entreth into the Princes pallace, or into his priuy-chamber, hee ought euer to doe it with as great curteſie, reuerence, humilitie, and honour, and in ſpeaking to the King, as if hee had neuer ſpoken with him, nor ſeene him.
                     So that hee ſhould let all men ſee, that though it pleaſe the Kings Majeſty to make of him, and to accept him into his fauour, yet that hee leaue not to ſerue him, and doe him that duety that all other ſeruants doe, and are bounde to doe.
                     The ſafeſt and moſt certaine way to maintaine thoſe that are ſublimated, and exalted in the Courtes of Princes, and to raiſe vp and bring thoſe to aucthority that are lowe and of baſe condition, is: that the eſteemed repute himſelfe euer a Seruant, and that the ſeruant neuer vaunt nor boaſt himſelfe to be fauoured or eſteemed.
                     The familiars of Princes ought euer to beware that there come no complaints The fauourites of princes ought to beware of complaints. of them to the Princes care: For, as a drop of Water, by Time and continuall Fall, commeth to pierce the hardeſt ſtone: ſo it might happen that the numbers of complaints might bee occaſion for the prince to withdrawe his fauor and loue from the Courtier againe. If his only ſeruices were ſufficient to induce the Prince to fauor &amp; loue him: ſo the number of his ſubiects cōplaints againſt him, were occaſion enough to make him miſlike him, and and put him out of fauor clean, changing his loue and fauor, to hate and diſcredite. For it is a certaine thing, that when the Prince doth looke well into his owne doings, he had rather be be loued of all, then ſerued of one alone.
                     
                        
The honored Fauorite of the Court may not ſo much regarde the honour and credit he is called to by his prince as the baſenes and pouertie he was in, when it pleaſed the king to like of him and that he came firſt acquainted with the King.
                     For, if he did otherwiſe, it might ſo happen, that like as Fortune had brought him to that high eſtate hee had: So Pride might ouerthrow him againe, and bring him as low as hee was before: For, I ſhould haue ſaide more truely a great deale, ſaying: That it would haue made him fall downe right: beeing the propertie of Fortune, to ſuffer the baſer ſort (whom ſhe hath caled to honour) onely to returne them to their meane eſtate &amp; calling, they were of at firſt, and neuer to leaue the fauored of the Prince, and men of aucthoritie (nor neuer ſatisfied) till ſhee hath throwne them downe headlong into extreame miſery, neuer to riſe againe.
                     
                     
                        Agathocles (firſt the ſonne of a Potter, and afterwards made king of Scicilia) whilſt hee liued, hee euer vſed this manner, that in his treaſurie or iewell houſe, yea, and alſo at his Table, amongſt all his cups and diſhes of gold and ſiluer, hee had alſo ſome of Earth amongſt them: and beeing asked the occaſion, why in ſo great a Treaſurie and maſſe of golde and ſiluer, he had ſo vile and baſe a thing as Earth?
                     Hee aunſwered thus.
                     
                        I drinke in golden cups, and eate in Earthen dyſhes, to giue thankes vnto the Gods, which of a Potters-ſonne that I was, brought mee to this Royall eſtate of

For, it is an eaſier thing, and more likelyer, for a king to become a Potter, then for a Potter to attain to the greatnes &amp; ſtate of a king Theſe wordes of Agathocles were euer worthie to bee noted and had in

It may well be, that this braue Courtier and fauoured of the Court, before hee came to this degree of honour, was but of a meane houſe, and b

                        Titus Liuius reciteth, that the renowmed Romane Quintus Cincinnatus, before he came to bee made Captaine of Rome, hee was taken out of the fields a labouring man, plowing &amp; tilling the ground. And this ſo noble a perſon beeing occupied in great affayres of the common weale, eyther in prouiſions, or munitions, or in expeditions of warre, was wont to ſigh before all the Captaines and ſay: Alas, who could tell me now any newes how my Beefes doe in my graunge, my ſheepe in the mountaines, and whether my ſeruauntes haue prouided them of Hay and Paſture for to keepe them the next yeare.
                     Surely it is to be thought, that whoſoeuer ſpeakes theſe wordes with his mouth, muſt needes haue little pride in his heart.
                     And vndoubtedly hee proued his words true, and ſhewed, that hee ſpake as hee thought and in good earneſt without intent of ieſt: ſince afterwards

returned home againe to follow the plough, to plant his vines, and to ſee his owne thinges gouerned, leauing behinde him a perpetuall teſtimony of his noble and worthy doings. And his common Weale alſo greatly enriched by his famous acts.
                     
                        Saul was King of Iſrael, and taken fot a God, and was annointed of Samuel, his Father a poore husbandman of the Countrey, and hee from his youth brought vp in that trade, for to holde the plough, and yet when hee was King, he neuer diſdayned for to plough his ground, to ſow his oates, and to driue his beaſts, now to paſture then home againe: So that the good King did glory this day to holde the plough, and to morrow to fight with his ſword.
                     When Fortune therfore ſheweth her ſelfe enemy to any, and that from great dignity and high calling, ſhee ouerthroweth him, and bringeth him to low and meane eſtate: It is then that he hath good cauſe to complain of fortunes cruelty, and to bewayle his wretched happe, aſhamed to ſee his lothſome miſery. But when ſhee worketh contrarily, and from mean eſtate brings him to great honour and credite, that muſt needes be great honor and glory to him. Therefore I ſay, let them beware that beare rule and authority in the Court, that they be not proud, glorious &amp; high minded, neither otherwiſe detected of any kinde of vice, though they be neuer ſo much in fauour and eſtimation. Sith Fortune ſheweth moſt her ſpight againſt the proud and diſdainefull heart, rather then to the humble and meeke.
                     To ſtop the enemyes mouth, there can bee found no better meanes, then for the beloued of the Court not to bee proude and preſumptuous, ſince no man is found ſo madde or Fooliſh in the ſame, as once to dare to ſay, I accuſe this man, becauſe hee is in fauour and eſtimation: but hee may boldly doe it, when hee ſeeth indeede that hee is a prowde vaine-glorious foole.
                     If wee ſee the fauoured of the Court offended with one another, wee will ſay, It is but heate, if wee ſee him eate too much, wee will ſay, it is but of a good ſtomacke. If he riſe late, we will excuſe him, and ſay, It was late ere he went to bed, and that hee was wearie with watching. If he play oft, we will ſay, he doth it for paſtime: if hee be carefull in keeping that hee hath together, that hee is wi
                           ••
                         and pollitike: If hee ſpeake much, that hee is a pleaſaunt man, and giuen to be merrie: If he ſpeake little, that he is wiſe and modeſt: If hee ſpend much, that he is liberall and bountifull: but if he be glorious and proude, what ſhall a man ſay on him, and with what honeſt meanes Pride of all other faults inexcuſable can wee excuſe him? Surely let others looke. For I knowe not.
                     Truely, for all other faultes and errors of men, they may honeſtly be excuſed, ſaue onely that of pride. For, though many times we commit other offences, it is but through frailty: but if we offend in Pride, it commeth of a great folly, and want of diſcretion.
                     And for the contrarie, the lowly and curteous condition of Courtyers, do not onely depreſſe and refiſt the detractions and murmurings of their Enemies, but doth inforce them againſt their willes to ſay well of them. For, GOD doeth ſuffer many times, that the peruerſe Nature and condition of one, is ſubdued and ouercome by the good and gentle vſage of another.
                     Therefore the beloued of the Courte ſhould take great heed that they ſhew not themſelues prowd in their words, and much leſſe in their ceremony o
                           •
                        , which they vſe in Court: as in going vp the ſtayres, in entring in at the dores, in taking the ſtoole to ſit downe, and alſo in the putting off his Cap, &amp;c.

And though perhappes hee that ſhall reade theſe our aduertiſementes, will thinke them rather precepts for Children, then for men: yet I will anſwer him neuertheleſſe, that they are verie neceſſary for thoſe that are in fauour in the Court, and for all other Courtiers, without the vſe of which he may happily nouriſh a venernous ſerpent in his breſt.
                     And therefore not without great reaſon wee haue ſpoken that we haue, that of too little heed taking, ſometimes there may follow great trouble to the fauoured Courtier. For many times they murmur more againſt him, in not putting off his Cappe; when hee is courteouſly ſaluted, then they doe, if they deny their fauour, when they are requeſted.
                     If one Courtier leaue to doe, curteſie to another, they ſay hee doth it not, for that hee beareth him ill will, but for want of bringing vp But if hee bee great with the King, then they ſay it is not for want of good maners, but for that he is too proude.
                     To ſay truly, it is an vnhappy life, the life of the beloued in the Court, ſith they attribute all their faults and errours to folly, although they committed them rather through negligence, and want of foreſight, then of pretended malice, or ill will, as it is taken and thought.
                     
                        Gneus Flacous a Noble Romane, going in company with other Romanes to viſite a ſicke man, and comming alſo to an other Romane to ſee the ſame ſicke perſon likewiſe, and being no place commodious in the Chamber, where the laſt might ſitte downe, neyther any ſtoole left to ſit downe vpon: they ſay, hee roſe off from his ſtoole, &amp; gaue him place that came laſt.
                     The which humanity and curteſie was afterwards publiſhed among all the Romanes, and after alſo greatly prayſed of the Writers.
                     And the Romanes alſo, being uery true, graue, curious, and worthy of great faith and credite in all that they wrote, it is to be credited, that that act of courteſie was much noted and eſteemed, ſith they would write it in the moſt noble and Heroicall acts of their Common-weale.
                     When the fauoured Courtier is accompanied with Knights and Gentlemen of the Court, that brings him to the Court, and it happeneth any to goe vp the degrees before him, hee ſhould not paſſe for that, much leſſe ſhew any token that hee made any rockning of it.
                     For to ſay the truth, it is no great matter for him to goe vp before him on the degrees of ſtoue, ſith hee went before al, on the degrees of fauour. What matter is it to the fauoured or Officer of the Court, to ſee an other enter in at the ſtayre dore before him, if afterwards when they ſhall come where the King is, hee ſhall goe into the Priuie Chamber, at one that indeed is in fauour and beloued, and the other ſhall ſtand without like a ſheepe?
                     And to conclude, I ſay, if I were in the number of thoſe that are thus beloued, and fauoured of the King: I would in the Kings Chamber vſe my fauour and credite, and abroad, all curteſie and ciuility.

                           AVlus Gelius, and Plinie render true teſtimony in their writings, that the honeſty of the Romanes was ſo great in their eating, and their modeſty in their maintayning of themſelues ſuch, that they did not ſuffer any Romane Citizen to haue more houſes then one to dwell in, nor but one gowne to put on his backe, one horſe to ride vpon, nor aboue two yoake of oxen to till his land, Titus Liuius, Macrobius, Cicero, Plutarch, Saluſt, Lucan, Seneca, Aulus Gelius, Herodian, Eutropius, Trebellius, Vulpitius, and all the other Romane Writers, do neuer ceaſe to prayſe the auncient Romane pouerty, ſaying the Common welth of Rome, neuer loſt one iote of her greatnes and honour, during the time that they went abroad to conquer other Realmes and Dominions: but only ſince they beganne to gather treaſure together.
                     
                        Lycurgus the Philoſopher, who The lawes of Lycurgus, King of the Lacedemonians. afterwards was King of the Lacedemonians) ordayned in his Lawes hee made, that no neighbour ſhould haue any more goods then an other, but that all houſes, lands, vines, and poſſeſſions, golde, ſiluer, apparrell, moueables, and generally of all other things whatſoeuer, ſhould be indifferently holden among them to the common vtility of all.
                     And being asked, why hee would not conſent that the Common weale ſhould haue her own priuate commodities and particulars, anſwered thus:
                     The paines and trauels men endure in this mortall life, and the greate troubles and diſorders that come dayly to the Common weale, chance not ſo much for that men haue neede of liuing to maintaine themſelues with all, but for that they do deſire to leaue their heyres and ſucceſſors. And therfore I haue appointed euery thing in common among ſubiects, becauſe that during their liues they might haue honeſtly to maintaine themſelues withall, and that they ſhould not leauy any thing to diſpoſe by will after their deathes.
                     
                        Herodotus ſayth alſo, that it was decreede by the Inhabitants of the Iſles Baleares, that they ſhould ſuffer none to come into their Country to bring them any golde, ſiluer, Iewels, or precious ſtones. And this ſerued them to great profite: For by means of this Law, for the ſpace of foure hundred yeares that they had great warres with the Romanes, the Carthagenians, the French, and the Spaniards, neuer any of theſe Nations once ſtirred to goe about to conquere their land, being aſſured that they had neyther golde nor ſiluer, to robbe, or conuey from them.
                     
                        Promotheus that was the firſt that gaue Lawes to the Egyptians, did not prohibite golde nor ſiluer in Egypt (as thoſe of the Iſles Baleares did in theyr territories) neyther did he alſo commaund that all things ſhould be common, as Licurgus: but alſo commanded, that none in all his Kingdome ſhould be ſo hardy once to gather any maſſe or quantitie of golde or ſiluer together, and to hoord it vp. And this he did vpon great penalties: for as hee ſayde, Auarice is not ſhewed in building of fayre houſes, neyther

in hauing rich moueables, but in aſſembling and gathring together great treaſure, and laying it vp in their coffers.
                     And Plutarch in his booke, De Conſolatione, ſayth alſo, That if a rich man dyed among the Rhodians, leauing behind him one onely ſonne, and no more ſuruiuing him, they wold not ſuffer that he ſhould bee ſole heyre of all that his Father left: but they left him an honeſt heritage, &amp; liuing, to his ſtate and calling, and to marry him well withall, and the reſt of all his Fathers goods they diſſipated among the poore and Orphans,
                     The Lydians, that neyther were Greekes nor Romanes, but right barbarous people, had a law in their common weale, that euery man ſhould be bound to bring vp his children, but not to be at charges in beſtowing thē in marriage: So that the ſonne or daughter that was now of age to marry, they gaue them nothing to theyr marriage, more then they had gotten with their labour.
                     And thoſe that will exactly conſider this laudable cuſtome, ſhall finde that it is rather a Law of true Philoſophers, then a cuſtome of barbarous people: Since thereby the children were enforced to labour for their liuing, and the parents alſo were exemted from all manner of couetouſneſſe or auarice, to heape vp gold and ſiluer and to enrich themſelues.
                     
                        Numa Pompilius ſecond King of the Romanes, and eſtabliſher of their Lawes and decrees, in the law of the ſeuen Tables which he made, hee left them order onely, which way the Romanes might rule their Commonweale in tranquilitie, and put in no clauſe nor chapter that they ſhould make their willes, whereby their childrē might inherit their fathers goods. And therefore being asked why hee permitted (in his lawes) euery man to get as much goods as he could, and not to diſpoſe them by will, nor leaue them to their heyres: He aunſwered, becauſe wee ſee, that albeit there are ſome children that are vnhappy, vicious, and abominable, yet are there few fathers, notwithſtanding this, that wil depriue and diſinherite them of theyr goods at their death, onely to leaue them to any other heere? and therefore for this cauſe I haue commanded that all the goods that remaine after the death of the owner of them, ſhold be giuen to the Common-weale, as ſole heyre and ſucceſſor of them: to the end that if their children ſhould become honeſt and vertuous, they ſhould then bee diſtributed to them: if they were wicked and vnhappy, that they ſhould neuer bee owners of them, to hurt, and offende the good.
                     
                        Macrobius in his booke De ſomno Scipionis ſayth, that there was in the olde time, an old and ancient Law amongſt A Law amongſt the Tuſcans, worthy to be obſerued. the Tuſcans duely obſerued, and kept, and afterwards taken vp of the Romanes, that in euerie place, where ſoeuer it were (in towne or village) within their territories, on newyeares day, euerie man ſhould preſent himſelfe before the Iudge or Magiſtrate of the place hee was in, for to giue him account of his manner of life, and how hee maintained himſelfe, and in theſe examinations they did accuſtome to puniſh him that liued idely, and with knauery and deceipt maintayned themſelues, as Minſtrels, Ruffians, Dicers, Carders, Iuglers, Coggers, Foyſter, Coſeners of men, and filching knaues, with other loytering vagabonds and rogues, that liue of others ſwet and toyle, without any paine or labour, they take vpon them to deſerue that they eate.
                     I would to God (if it were his will) that this Tuſcan Law were obſerued of Chriſtians, then we ſhould ſee how

few they be in number, that giue them ſelues to any faculty or ſcience, or other trade, to liue by their owne trauell and induſtry: and how many &amp; infinite a number they bee that liue in idle ſort.
                     The diuine Plato in his Timee ſayeth, that although an idle man bee more occaſion of many troubles and inconueniences in a Common-weale, then a couetous man, yet is it not alwayes greater: for the idle man, and that gladly taketh his eaſe, doth but deſire to haue to eate: but the couetous man doth not only deſire to eate but to bee rich and haue money enough.
                     All the eloquence and pleaſaunt ſpeech that the Orators ſtudied in their Orations, the Lawyers in theyr Law, and the famous Philoſophers in their doctrine and teaching, was for no other cauſe, but to admoniſh and perſwade thoſe of the Commonweale, to take very good heed in chuſing of their gouernours, that they were not couetous and ambitious, in the adminiſtration of their publike affayres.
                     
                        Laertius reciteth alſo, that a Rhodian ieſting with Eſchines the Philoſopher, ſayde vnto him.
                     By the immortall Gods, I ſweare to thee, O Eſchines, that I pitty thee to ſee thee ſo poore, to whom, he aunſwered, By the ſame immortall Gods I ſweare to thee againe, I haue compaſſion on thee, to ſee thee ſo rich. Sith riches bring but paine and trouble to get them, great care to keepe them, diſpleaſur to ſpend them, perill to hoorde them, and occaſion of great daungers, and inconueniences to defend them: and that that grieueth me moſt, is, that where thou keepeſt thy treaſure faſt lockt vp, there alſo thy heart is buried.
                     Surely Eſchines words ſeemed rather ſpoken of a Chriſtian, then of a Philoſopher. In ſaying, that where a mans treaſure is, there is alſo his hart: For there is no couetous man, but dayly hee thinkes vpon his hidde treaſure, but he neuer calleth to mind his ſinnes he hath committed.
                     Comparing therefore thoſe things wee haue ſpoken, with thoſe thinges wee will ſpeake: I ſay, that it becommeth the fauoured of Princes to know that it is leſſe ſeemely for them to bee couetous then others: For the greatneſſe of their fauour ought not to bee ſhewed onely in being rich, but alſo in being noble and worthy.
                     
                        Plutarch ſheweth, that Denys the Siracuſian comming one day into the Chamber of the Prince his ſonne, and finding great riches of gold and ſiluer that he had giuen him, he ſpake very angerly to him and ſayde: Thou haſt beene farre fitter for a Marchant of Capua, then to be as thou art the Kings ſonne of Scicilia, ſith thou haſt a witte to gather, but not to ſpend. Which is not fitte nor lawfull for thee, if thou wilt ſucceede mee after my time in my Kingdome.
                     And therefore I doe remember thee, that Kingdoms and high eſtates are not maintained with keeping of riches, but alſo with giuing and honorably beſtowing them well.
                     And to this purpoſe alſo reciteth Plutarch, that Ptholomeus Philodelphus 
                        A worthy ſaying of Plutarch. was demaunded why he was ſo ſlowe, and with ſo great difficulty receyued the ſeruices of others, and was ſo liberall, and noble in giuing, and granting fauours: hee aunſwered, I will not get reputation amongſt the gods, nor good renowne amongſt men for beeing rich, but onely I will bee prayſed and eſteemed for making of others rich, and hauing vnder mee rich ſubiects.
                     Theſe words that Ptholome ſayde to a friend of his, and thoſe that Denys ſpake to his ſonne: mee thinkes

the beloued of the Court ſhould not onely be contented to reade them, but to ſeeke to keepe them ſtill in minde: ſith by them wee may manifeſtly ſee, that Riches are euermore profitable for a man that oweth them, and giueth them bountifully: then to haue them, and with couetouſnes to hoord and locke them vp in their Coffers: And the fauoured of Princes ſhould not be enuied, for the goods that they can get by their fauour and credit, but onely for the good that thereby they may doe to their friendes and Kinſfolkes.
                     For they are thoſe that with others goods, make the people ſlaues vnto them. What greater Nobility can there be in this world, then to make others noble? What greater riches then to make others rich? and what more liberty then to make others free? The glory that the Princes, and thoſe that they eſteeme, and haue in their fauour ought to haue, ſhould not conſiſt in getting together much goods, but in winning many ſeruauntes, and friends.
                     Great are the priuiledges that the noble and liberall men haue, for their children are obedient vnto them, their neighbours loue them, their friendes doe accompany them, their ſeruaunts ſerue them faithfully, ſtraungers viſite them, and the enemies they haue dare not ſpeake againſt them: for althogh they ſpight at their greatneſſe and fauour, yet they dare not once preſume to rebuke or reproue their liberality. Phalaris the Agrigentine, Denys the Syracuſian, Cateline the Romane, and Iugurth the Numedian: Theſe foure famous tyrants did not maintain their ſtates and royall kingdomes with the vertues they had, but onely by force &amp; ample gifts they gaue:
                     So that wee may well ſay, that in the world there is no ſtone ſo Philoſophicall, nor hand ſo liberall as Treaſure and Riches: ſith that in giuing it, good-men become great, and Tirants thereby are ſupported.
                     I would thoſe that are Princes Familiars would note wel this word, that is, that great Fauor ioyned with much couetouſneſſe, is a thing vnpoſſible to continue long in any. For, if he meane to keepe himſelfe in fauour, hee muſt needes flye Auarice: and if hee will He that will be a Courtyer muſt ſhun couetouſnes. needes ſticke to Auarice, hee muſt of neceſſitie looſe his Fauour. There is no better meanes for him that ſeekes the Princes Fauour, to get into fauour, then to ſerue him diligently, and to trouble him but ſeldome.
                     The Kings Officer that ſerueth him in his houſe, muſt endeauour to make the King knowe that hee ſerueth him more for the Loue hee beareth him, then for any gaine or profit he hopeth at his handes. For, in ſo doing, the King will not only with his fauour and benefites beſtowed on him, treate and handle him as one he loueth, and maketh account of, but alſo loue him, as if he were his owne ſonne. It is moſt iuſt, the beloued of the Prince, loue and honour the prince, with all his heart, ſince hee loueth him, and needeth not.
                     Thoſe that are beloued, made of, and fauoured in Brinces Courts, ſhould make great account of it, and therefore they ſhould ſerue willingly. For, the loue we beare to Princes, commeth commonly rather of the neceſſitie we haue of them, then of our owne proper wills. But the loue of Princes to vs, commeth of meere good will, and not of neceſſitie.
                     If any man doe accompany mee, ſpeake to me, and ſerue me: it is onely in reſpect that I euer giue him, and for that hee hopeth I will giue him in time to come. And to ſuch a man I might truely ſay, hee rather flattereth, then loueth me. The eſteemed of the Court muſt note, if it pleaſe them that

though, the Prince haue others about him, whom he fauoreth and loueth, as well as himſelfe, that hee be not therefore offended not diſpleaſed a whit. For els all thoſe he ſeeth accepted into fauour with the prince, hee would make them his enemyes: and becauſe they may auoyde this inconuenience, they muſt take it in very good part. For albeeit the Prince giue his fauour to one alone, yet hee imparteth his gifts to diuers.
                     Thoſe that newly begin to riſe in the Court, and to doe much: may not euen vpon a ſudden ſhew themſelues to be Rich: but onely ſtudie daily to A good caueat for young Courtiors. increaſe in fauour. For, euery time that the Courtyer doeth aſſure mee he doth not diminiſh in fauour, I will bee bound to him he ſhal neuer be poore.
                     The way they muſt obſerue in the Court to be great, and to be able to do is this: That is, to viſite ofte, to ſuffer, to preſent, to perſeuer, to be beloued, and to continue in the princes fauour: Which I aſſure you, is a great ſecret, and right Alchymine of court, ſuddenly to riſe in fauour, and to be rich, and all in ſhort time.
                     By this I inferre that the wiſe man euer deſireth to be in fauor, before he couet to be Rich: but the Foole and Ideot deſireth firſt to bee Rich, and then in fauour laſt.
                     Not few but many wee haue ſeene in Princes Courtes, which though Fortune in ſhort time hath exalted to the firſt degree of Riches, and made them chiefe in fauor, yet within ſhort ſpace after, ſhee hath made them alſo looſe their Riches, and fall from the top of their pretended honour and dignitie.
                     It is moſt certaine that if one haue enemies in the Court, onely for that he is in fauor, he ſhall haue as many me: if being in fauour, hee be alſo Rich. For wee are all of ſo ill a condition, in thinges that touch our particular profire, that all that we ſee giuē to others, wee thinke ſuddenly taken away from our ſelues.
                     We haue heretofore ſaide, that it is not fit for the Courtyer, and thoſe that are in fauour, to commaund for his profite all that he liſt, neyther all thoſe that hee may. And wee now at this preſent, doe alſo aduiſe them to take heede, that they doe not accept and take all that is offered and preſented, although they may lawfully doe it. For, if hee be not wiſe in commaunding, and moderate in taking, a day might come that hee ſhould ſee himſelfe in ſuch extremity, that he ſhould be inforced to call his Friends, not to counſell him, but rather to helpe and ſuccour him.
                     It is true, that it is a naturall thing for a Courtyer that hath twenty crowns in his purſe, to deſire ſuddenly to multiplie The couetous deſire of ſome Courtiers. it to an 100. from a 100. to 200. from 200. to a 1000. from a thouſand to 2000. and from 2000, to an hundred thouſand.
                     So that this poore wretched creature is ſo blinded in couetouſnes, that hee knoweth not, nor feeleth not, that as this Auarice continually increaſeth and augmenteth in him, ſo his life daily diminiſheth and decreaſeth: beſides that that euery man mocks and ſcorns him, that thinketh The true contentation conſiſteth in commanding of Money, and in the facultie of poſſeſſing much riches, For to ſay truly it is not ſo, but rather diſordinate riches troubleth and grieueth the true contentation of men, and awaketh in them daily a more appetite of Couetouſnes.
                     
                     We haue ſeen many Courtiers rich and beloued: but none indeede that euer was contented, or wearyed with commaunding, but rather his life ſhould faile him then Couetouſnes. Oh how many haue I ſeene in the Court, whoſe legges nor feete haue bin able to carry them, nor their bodie ſtrong enough to ſtand alone, nor their hands able to

write, nor their ſight hath ſerued them to ſee to reade, nor their teeth for to ſpeake, nor their iawes to eate, nor their eares to heare, nor their memory to trauell in any ſuite or matter, &amp; yet haue not their tongue fayled them to require preſents and giftes of the Prince, neyther deepe and fine wit to practiſe in Court for his moſt auaile and vantage. So incurable is the diſeaſe and plague of auarice, that hee that is ſicke of that infirmity, can not bee healed neyther with pouerty, nor yet bee remedied with riches: Since this contagious maladie and apparant daunger is now ſo commonly knowne, and that it is crepte into Courtiers, and ſuch as are in high fauour and great authoritie by reaſon of this vile ſinne of auarice. I would counſell him rather to apply himſelfe to bee well thought of, and eſteemed, then to endeauour to haue enough.
                     Alſo Queene Semiramis was wife to king Belius, and mother of king Ninus, and although by nature ſhee was made a woman, yet had ſhee a heart neuer otherwiſe but valiant and Noble: For after ſhee was widdow, ſhee made her ſelfe Lord by force of armes of the great India, and conquered all Aſia, and in her life time cauſed a goodly tombe to bee made, where ſhe would lye after her death, and about the which ſhe cauſed to bee grauen in golden Letters theſe words.

And being reported to him by thoſe that had the charge to ſeeke the treaſure, that they had ſought The covetouſnes of King Cyrus rewarded with deceite to the bottomleſſe pit and Worldes end, but treaſure they could find none nor any other thing, ſaue a ſtone wher in were grauen theſe words.

                        By follies play abuſed was ſo much:

                        Plutarch and alſo Herodotus which haue both written this hiſtory of Semiramis, doe ſhew and affirme, that Queen Semiramis got great honour by this ieſt, and King Cyrus great ſhame and diſhonour.
                     If Courtiers that are rich, thinke and beleeue that for that they haue money inough, and at their will, that therefore they ſhould be farre from all troubles and miſeries, they are deceyned: For if the poore ſoule toyle and hale his body to get him onely that he needeth, much more dooth the rich man torment and burne his heart, till hee be reſolued which way to ſpende that ſuperfluitie he hath. Ieſu, what a thing is it to ſee a rich man, how bee tormenteth himſelfe night and day, imagining and deuiſing with himſelfe whether hee ſhall with the mony that is left, buy leaſes, milles, or houſer, anuities, vines, or cloth, lands, tenemēts or paſtures: or ſome thing in ſee: or whether he ſhal enrich his ſonne with the thirds or fifts: and after all theſe vaine thoughts, Gods will is, for to ſtrike him with death ſuddenly, not onely before he hath determined how hee ſhould lay out or ſpend this money, but alſo before he hath made his will.
                     
                        
I haue many times tolde it to my friends, yea, and preached it to them in the Pulpit, and written it alſo in my bookes, that it is farre greater trouble to ſpend the goods of this world well, and as they ought to be ſpent, then it is to get them: For they are gotten with ſwette, and ſpent with cares. Hee that hath no more then hee needeth, it is hee that knoweth well how to parte from them, and to ſpend them: but he that hath aboundance, and more then needfull, doth neuer reſolue what hee ſhould doe.
                     Whereof followeth many times, that thoſe which in his life time were Who knoweth who ſhall enioy his riches after his death. enemies to him, ſhall happen to bee heyres after his death of all the goods and money he hath. It is a moſt ſure and certaine cuſtome among mortall men, that commonly thoſe that are rich (while they are aliue) ſpend more money vainely in thinges they would not, and that they haue no pleaſure in, and wherein they would leſt lay it out: and after their death they leaue the moſt part of their inheritance to thoſe whom they loued leaſt: for it hapneth many times that the ſonne which hee loueth worſt, enheriteth his goods, &amp; that ſonne which hee loued beſt, and made moſt of, remaineth poore.
                     Therfore continuing ſtill our matter, I ſay, that I know not the cauſe why the fauoured of the Court deſire to bee ſo rich, couetous, and inſatiable, ſith they alone haue to gette the goods, where afterwardes to ſpende them, they haue need of the counſell and aduiſe of many.
                     Let not thoſe alſo that are in fauour with the Prince, make too great a ſhew openly of their riches, but if they haue aboundance, let them keepe it ſecret: For if their lurking enemies know not what they haue, the worſt they can doe, they can but murmur: but if they ſee it once, they will neuer leaue till they haue accuſed him.
                     To ſee a Courtier builde ſumptuous houſes, to furniſh them with wonderfull and rich hangings, to vſe exceſſe and prodigality in their meates, to haue their cupbordes maruellouſly decked with cups, and pots of golde, and ſiluer, to ſee infinite preſents brought into his houſe, &amp; to be greedy of money, and to haue a great train of ſeruants to wayte vpon them: All theſe are things not onely to make thē murmur and repine at, but alſo when time and place ſerueth to condemne and accuſe them to the Prince. And this were but little to murmur at them and accuſe them: ſo that they did not defame them, and diminiſh their honour and reputation: For they tell it abroad afterwards, eyther that they are corrupted with preſents, or that they doe robbe and ſteale from the Prince their maſter.
                     And therefore I returne once againe to admoniſh them, and ſpecially the officer of the Court, that they ſhal not neede, neyther is it requiſire they make any oſtentation of their riches: if they be wiſe at leaſt: For beſides that euery body will murmur againſt him, they will not ſpare to bring it to the Princes cares quickly, ſo that by miſfortune it might happen to him, that the King would doe that with his ſeruant, that the hunter doth oft with his beaſts hee taketh, that many times he cheriſheth him, and giueth him meate to eate, not to bring him vp, but to fat and kill him for his owne eating.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XV. That the fauoured of the Court ſhoulde not truſt too much to their fauour, and credite they haue, nor to the proſperitie of their life. A worthy Chapter, &amp; full of good doctrine.
                     
                     
                        WHat reputation Paul the Apoſtle had amongeſt the Chriſtians, the like had the great Cato the Iudge, among the Romanes, who in the progreſſion of his life, proceeded ſo honeſtly, and in the gouernement of the publike weale was ſo iuſt, that hee deſerued that this Epitaph ſhould be written vpon his Pallace gate.
                     
                        O Cato great, whoſe euerlaſting fame,
                     
                     
                        Amidſt the earth ſtill liues with honour due,

                        For iudgement wrong, whereby the guiltleſſe rule,

                     Among all the noble and renowmed Romanes, hee onely would neuer ſuffer ſtatue or Image of his, to bee ſet vp in the high Capitoll. Whereat diuers maruelling, and imagining diuerſly what was his meaning, hee beeing one day in the Senate ſayde to them theſe words openly.
                     I will they ſhall ſeeke the good workes I haue done, by which I did deſerue that my Image ſhould be erected in the Capitoll, then to giue thē cauſe to goe ſearch and enquire what linage I was of, what was my life, with intent to pull downe my Image: For it happeneth many times, that thoſe whom inconſtant fortune from a low eſtate hath rayſed vp to high degree and ſteppe of honour, doe become afterwardes by the ſame occaſion rather defamed, then prayſed: for there are many that are reuerenced, &amp; honoured openly, by reaſon of theyr honour and dignity they haue at this preſent, of whom they make a ieſting ſtocke afterwards when they ſee them fall.
                     
                        Lucan ſayeth, that Pompeius would ſay many times, when he would ſpeake of theſe worldly things: My friends, I can tell you a true thing, whereby you may know the little occaſion wee haue to truſt humane felicities. Example you may ſee in mee, which attained to the Romane Empire, without any hope I had euer to come vnto it: and afterwards alſo not miſtruſting any thing, euen ſuddenlie it was taken from mee, and I depriued of it. Lucius Seneca beeing baniſhed from Rome, wrote a letter to his mother. Albuina, in which hee did both comfort her, and himſelfe, and wrotte thus. O my deare mother Albuina, I neuer in all my life beleeued or truſted vnſtabel Fortune, although there haue bin many peaces and leagues made betwixt her and our houſe: for if at a time the traytereſſe conſented, that for a ſpace I ſhould bee quiet, and at reſt, ſhee did it not of good will ſhee had to leaue to purſue me, but for to giue me a more cloaked ſeuerity: For when ſhee ſeeth wee thinke our ſelues aſſured, then with al her force and fury ſhee giueth vs the aſſault, as if

ſhee came to aſſault the Enemies Campe: And I tell thee further, yet (good mother) that all the good ſhee wrought in mee, and the honour ſhee heaped on mee, and all the faculties and aboundance of riches ſhe broght to my houſe, hee tolde mee ſhee gaue them freely, but I alwayes aunſwered her, I did accept in way of impreſt, &amp; not of gift. Her promiſes therefore ſhee offered mee the honour ſhe layd vpon mee, and the riches ſhe gaue me, ſhee layde them vp in ſuch a corner of my houſe, that either by day, or by night, ſhe might at her pleaſur when ſhee would take them all from mee, without that ſhee ſhould trouble at all therefore my iudgement, or that ſhee ſhould ſorrow my heart a whit: And becauſe thou ſhouldeſt know how I did eſteeme of fortune, I tell thee, that I euer thought it good, neuer to let any thing come within me, 
                           •
                        or into my heart, but only neere vnto me and ſo I was contented to eſteeme it, and to keepe it vnder good ſafety, 
                           •••
                         not that I therefore applyed, and gaue all my affection and minde vnto it: I was glad to haue fortune my friend, but if I loſt her, I was neuer ſorry for her.
                     Finally, I conclude, that when ſhe came to aſſault mee, and to robbe my houſe, ſhe might well conuay all that was to put in the Arke, but not that ſhee could euer carry away the leaſt ſigh of my heart. They ſay that K. Philip father of Alexander the Great, beeing aduertiſed of three great victories The ſpeech of Philip K. of Macedonie. hapned in ſundry places to his Army, kneeled down on both his knees, and holding vp his hands to the heauens, ſayd, O cruel fortune, O merciful gods I beſeech you moſt humbly, that after ſo great a glory and victory as this, you haue hitherto giuen mee: you will moderate your correction, and puniſhment, which after this I looke for that you will graunt mee, that you puniſh me with pity, and not with vtter deſtruction and ruine. And yet he added this furder to his words.
                     Not without cauſe I Conjure thee Oh Fortune, and doe beſeeche you immortall Gods, that you wil puniſh me fauourably, but not to vndoe me: becauſe I am aſſured, that ouermuch felicitie and proſperitie of this life, is no more but a prediction and preſage of a great calamitie, and an yll inſuing happe.
                     Truely all the Examples aboue recited are worthie to be noted, and to be kept alwayes before the eyes of our mindes, ſith by them wee come to know, that in the proſperitie of this our thrawled life, there is litle to hope for, and much to be afrayd of.
                     It is true wee are very fraile by nature, ſince we are borne fraile, we liue fraile, and daylie wee fall into a thouſand fraylties: but yet notwithſtanding we are not ſo frayle, but wee may if we will reſiſt vice.
                     And all this commeth onely, becauſe one ſort of people followeth an other, but one reaſon ſeldome followeth another.
                     If wee fall, if we ſtumble, if wee be ſicke, if we breake our face, are we ſure (that ſeruing as we do the world) that the world will recure and remedie vs?
                     No ſure, it is not ſo. For the remedy the world is wont to giue to our troubles, is euer notwithſtanding greater trouble then the firſt: ſo that they are like vnto Searing-yrons, that burne the fleſh, and heale not the wound.
                     For the world is full of guile and deceyte, and ſubtill to deceiue, but very ſlowe to giue vs remedy. And this we ſee plainly. For if it perſwade vs to reuenge any iniury receyued, it doeth it onely in reuenging of that, to make vs receiue a thouſand other iniuries.
                     And if ſometimes wee thinke wee receiue ſome comfort of the world, of our paines and troubles of the body, if

afterwardes ouer-lodeth our mindes, with a Sea of thoughts and cogitations. So that this accurſed and flattering world maketh vs belieue, &amp; perſwadeth vs the right and perfite way, and in the end we are caſt vnwares into the Nets of all wickednes, priuily layde to enſnare vs.
                     How great ſoeuer a man bee in fauor with the king, how noble of bloud how fine of wit, and how warie ſoeuer hee be, let euery man bee aſſured that practiſeth in the world, he ſhall in the ende be deceyued by him. For, hee coſteth vs very deere, and wee ſell our ſelues to him good cheape.
                     I tolde you but little, to tell you we ſolde our ſelues good cheape, for I ſhould haue ſaide better, in ſaying we haue giuen out ſelues in preye wholly to him, without receiuing any other recompence. And in deede they are very fewe, and rare, that haue any reward of him: and infinit are they that ſerue him, without any other recompence, more then an ydle, fooliſh, and vaine-hope.
                     Oh Trayterous Worlde, in how ſhort a time doeſt thou receyue vs! and afterwardes with a glimce of an Eye ſuddenly doeſt put vs from thee: thou gladdeſt, and makeſt vs ſorrowfull, The vncertaintie of this worlds felicitie. thou calleſt vs to honour and abaſeſt vs, thou puniſheſt vs, and doeſt vs a thouſand pleaſures.
                     And finally I ſay, thou doeſt make vs ſo vile, and poyſoneſt vs with thy vile labourers, that without thee, wee are yet euer with thee: and that that grieues vs worſt of all is, that hauing the Thiefe in the houſe, we goe out of the houſe, to giue him place, and make him owner. When the world knoweth one once that is prowd and preſumptuous, he procureth him honour: to another that is couetous, riches: to another that is a glutton, good meats: to an other that is carnall, the commoditie of womē: to another that is idle, quyet and eaſe: and all this doth the Trayterous Worlde, to the ende that after, as Fiſh, whom hee hath fed, hee may laye the net of ſinne vpon vs, to catch vs in.
                     If we would reſiſt the firſt temptations the World offreth vs, it is impoſſible hee durſt ſo many times aſſaulte vs. For to ſay truely by our ſmall and weake reſiſtance, increaſeth his ouergreat audacitie.
                     I would theſe Louers of this worlde would but tell me a little, what 
                           〈◊〉
                         or what Hope they can hope of him, Why they ſhould ſuffer ſo manie e
                           •
                        
                        cumbers, broyles, and troubles as they doe?
                     To thinke the Worlde can giue vs perpetuall life, it is a mockery, and extreame madnes to hope of it. For we ſee when life is moſt deare to vs, and that we are lotheſt to leaue the world, then arriueth Death (in an vnhappie houre) to ſwallow vs vp, &amp; to depriue vs of all this our worldly felicitie.
                     To hope that the World will giue vs aſſured Myrth: euen this is alſo a madnes. For the dayes excepted, we muſt lament, and the houres allottod out to complaine, alas, we ſhal ſee but a ſmall ſurplus of Time left, to laughe and be mertie.
                     I can ſay no more, but exhort euery man to looke well about him, what he doth, and that he be aduiſed what hee thinketh. For when we thinke and belieue wee haue made peace with Fortune, euen then is ſhe in battel againſt vs. And I doe aſſuredly belieue, that that I now prepare my ſelfe to ſpeake euen preſently, ſhall be read of manie, but obſerued of few: and that is, that I haue ſeene thoſe come out of their owne proper houſes, mourning and lamenting that had ſpent and conſumed all their time in laughing and making good cheere, &amp; ſeruing this miſerable world: which is but only a giuer of all euils, a ruine of the good, a heap of ſinne, a tyraunt of vertues, a traitor of

peace and warre, a ſweet water of errors, a riuer of vices, a perſecutor of the vertuous, a combe of lyes, a deuiſer of nouelties, a graue of the ignorant, a cloake of the wicked, an ouen of lechery: and finally, a Charibdis, where all good and noble hearts doe periſh, and a Sylla, where all Noble deſires and thoughts are caſt away together.
                     For it is moſt certaine, that this Worlding that is not content with this World, and that leaueth his firſt eſtate, and that taketh vpon him a new manner of life, and chaungeth from houſe to houſe, and from Countrey to Countrey: hee ſhall neuer notwithſtanding content himſelfe, nor quiet his mind.
                     And the cauſe hereof is, that if a Worlding depart out of his houſe, neuer to come againe into it, there are yet at hand immediatly other ten licentious perſons, that do but watch to enter into his houſe. Speaking more particularly, I ſay, that in the Court of Princes they account them happy and fortunate, that be in fauour with the Prince, that haue great affairs in Court, that bee rich and of power: that be ſerued and honoured of euerie man, and that take place &amp; goe before euery man: So that it may be ſaid, that the common people doe not cal thoſe fortunate, that deſerue to be fortunat: but onely thoſe that haue enough. But the auncient Philoſophers were not of this mind, and much leſſe are the wiſe &amp; vertuous men at this day: For we ſee that in the Court of Princes many lacke fauor, rather then life, others lacke both fauour, and life together, and others not onely their life and fauour, but alſo their goods and faculties. So that, all that their fauour and credite haue giuen them in many yeares, and by ſundry griefes and troubles, they come afterwardes to loſe them euen vpon a ſuddain, and in ſhort time: I graunt notwithſtanding that it is a great honour, profite, and furtherance, for the Courtier to bee in his Princes fauour, but neuertheleſſe hee cannot deny me, but that it is a dangerous thing alſo: For naturally a great familiarity, bringeth alſo a great enuy with it, ſith the beloued of the Princes is commonly euill willed of the Common weale.
                     And that which is moſt daungerous is, that to obtain the fauor of his Prince, hee muſt ſo behaue himſelfe: that his ſeruice muſt bee more rare, better, and exquiſite, then all others: and otherwiſe, to fall in diſgrace, and to make the Prince forget all the good ſeruice he hath don him his whole life time, hee need but the leaſt diſpleaſure Examples of many Fauourites of Princes that haue come to vntimely ends. and fault he can commit.
                     
                        Euſenides was maruellouſly beloued with Ptolomey, who after Fortune had exalted and brought him to honour, and that he was grown to great wealth, ſayde one day to Cuſpides the Philoſopher theſe words.
                     O my friend Cuſpides, tell mee I pray thee of thy faith, is there any cauſe in mee to be ſadde, ſith Fortune, hath placed me in ſo great authoritie, and honour, as ſhe can deuiſe to doe, and that the King Ptolomey my Lorde, hath now now no more to giue me: he hath already beene ſo bountifull to me?
                     To whom the Philoſopher aunſwered, ſaying: O Euſenides, if thou wert a Philoſopher, as thou art a beloued ſeruant, thou wouldeſt tell mee an other tale, then that thou telleſt mee now: For although King Ptolomey hath no more to giue mee, knoweſt thou not that ſpightfull fortune hath power to take away from thee many things? For the noble heart feeleth more griefe, and diſpleaſure, to come downe one ſtayre, or ſteppe, then to clime a hundred.
                     Not many dayes after theſe words

paſſed betweene Cuſpides and Euſenides, it happened that one day King Ptolomey found Euſenides talking with a Lemman or Curteſan of his, which hee loued dearely, whereat hee was ſo much offended, that hee made her ſtraight drinke a cuppe of poyſon, and cauſed him to bee hanged before his owne gates.
                     The Emperour Seuerus had one in ſo great fauour and credit, which was called Plautius, and he loued him ſo extreamely, and truſted him ſo much, that he neuer read letter, but Plautius muſt reade it, and hee neuer graunted commiſſion or licence to any man, but it muſt paſſe vnder Plautius Seale: neither did hee euer graunt anything, but at the requeſt of Plautius, nor did make warres or peace, without the counſell and aduiſe of Plautius.
                     
                     The matter fell out ſo, that Plautius entring one night into the Emperours Chamber with a priuy coate, his ill happe was ſuch, that a little of his breaſt before was open, whereby was ſpyed the male: which Bahhian ſeeing, being the Emperours eldeſt Sonne, ſayde vnto him theſe ſharpe words.
                     Tell me Plautius, Doe thoſe that are beloued of Princes vſe to come into theyr Bed-Chambers at theſe howers, Armed with yron-coates? I ſweare vnto thee by the immortall Gods, and ſo let them preſerue me in the ſucceſſion of the Empyre: That ſince thou commeſt with yron, thou ſhalt alſo dye with yron: Which preſently tooke place. For, before hee went out of the Chamber, they ſtrake off his head.
                     The Emperour Commodus (that was ſonne of the good Emperour Marcus Aurelius) had a Seruant called Cleander: a wiſe and graue man, olde, and very pollitike: but withall, a little couetous.
                     This Cleander was oft times requeſted of the Praetorian company, that is to ſay of the whole band of ſouldiers, that he would commaund they might be payd their pay due vnto them: and to perſwade him the better to pay it: they ſhewed him a bill, ſigned from the Emperour, to which he anſwered: That the Emperour had nothing to do in the matter. For, althogh he were lord of Rome, yet had he not to deale in the affayres of the Common-weale.
                     Theſe diſcurteous and vnſeemely wordes related to the Emperour Comodus, and perceyuing the ſmall obedience, and reſpect of duty that Cleander ſhewed to him, hee commaunded forthwith he ſhould be ſlaine to his great ſhame, and that all his goods ſhould be confiſcate.
                     
                        Alcimenides was a great renowned King among the Greekes, as Plutarch writeth of him, and hee fauoured one Pannonius entirely well, to whom only hee did not commit his perſon, his truſt, but alſo the whole affaires and doings of the common weale, and hee might diſpoſe of the goods of the king, at his will and pleaſure, without leaue or licence. So that all the Subiects found, they had more benefite in ſeruing of Pannonius then in pleaſing of the King.
                     Therefore the King, and the beloued Pannonius playing at the ball together, they came to contend vpon a Chaſe, and the one ſayde, it was thus: the other ſayde it was contrary: and as they were in this contention, the king commaunded preſently thoſe of his guarde, that in the very place of the Chace where Pannonius denyed, they ſhould ſtrike off his head.
                     
                        Conſtantius the Emperour alſo had one whome hee liked very well, and made much of, called Hortentius, which might well bee counted a Princes darling, for hee did not onely rule the affayres of the common weale, of the pallace, of warres, his goods, and perſon of the Emperour: but alſo hee

was euer placed aboue all the Ambaſſadours at his table. And when the Emperour went in progreſſe, or any other iourney, he euer had him to his bedfellow.
                     Thus things being in this ſtate, I tell you, it happened that one day a Page giuing the Emperour drinke in a glaſſe, the glaſſ, by miſhappe fell out of the Pages hand, and brake in pieces, whereat the Emperour was not a little diſpleaſed and offended. And euen in this euill and vnhappy howre, came Hortenſius to the king to preſent him certaine billes, to the ſigne of haſty diſpatch, which was a very vnapt time choſen (and the Emperour yet contented to ſigne it, could neyther the firſt nor the ſecond time, becauſe the penne was ill fauouredly made, &amp; the inke ſo thicke, that it woulde not write, which made the king ſo angry, that euen preſently for anger, he commaunded that Hortenſius head ſhould be ſtrucken off.
                     But to the end wee may come to the knowledge of many things in few words, I will ſhew you how Alexander the Great ſlew in his choller his deere accounted Cratherus, and Pirrhus king of the Epirotes, Fabatus his Secretary.

                     All theſe aboue named, and infinit others alſo, ſome were Maſters, ſome Lordes, ſome kings, and ſom of great authority and fauour about Princes, by whoſe tragicall hiſtories and examples wee may plainely ſee, that they did not onely looſe their goods, fauor, and credit, but alſo vpon very light occaſions were put to death by ſword: Therefore mortall men ſhould put no truſt in worldly things, ſith that of little occaſion they become ſoone great and of much leſſe, they ſuddenly fall, and come to worſe eſtate then before.
                     And therefore king Demetrius aſking one day Euripides the Philoſopher, A worthy ſaying of Euripides the Philoſopher. what hee thought of humane debility, and of the ſhortneſſe of this life, anſwered.
                     Mee thinkes, O king Demetrius, that there is nothing certaine in this vnſtable life: ſith all men liuing, and all things alſo that ſerue them, endure dayly ſome clipſe. And hereunto replyed ſuddenly Demetrius and ſayde:
                     O my good Euripides, thou hadſt ſayde better, that all things vegitiue, and ſenſitiue, and each other liuing thing doth not onely feele the Eclipſes force, and change from day to day, but from houre to houre, and minute to minute. Meaning king Demetrius, by theſe words hee ſpake, that there is nothing ſo ſtable in this world, bee it of what ſtate or condition it will bee, but in the twinckling of an eye, is ready to runne into a thouſand dangers and perils: and albeit we bee all ſubiect (of what ſtate or degree ſo euer wee bee) to ſundry and diuers thrals, and miſhaps, yet none ſo neere neighbours to them, as thoſe that are in higheſt authority, and greateſt fauor with Princes: For there are many that ſhootes to hitte downe the white of their fauour, but few that being down, will once put it vp againe, and reſtore it to his place,
                     For to liue a contented life, a man had neede to want nothing, neyther to haue any occaſion to trouble him: But the things that trouble vs in this

vale of miſery, being ſo many, and of ſuch aboundance, and thoſe thinges contrarily ſo few, and rare to come by, that wee neede and want: wee may iuſtly account this life wofull and miſerable aboue all others: For ſure farre greater are the grieues and diſpleaſures wee receyue for one onely thing wee want, then the pleaſures are great wee haue for a hundred others, whereof we haue aboundance. Beſides that, the familiars of Princes cannot thinke themſelues ſo mighty and fortunate, that any man may preſume to call them bleſſed or happie.
                     For if ſome ſerue and honor them others there are that perſecute them: and if in their houſes they haue that flatter them, and make much of them: there want not in the Court others that murmur at them, and ſpeake ill of them.
                     And if they haue cauſe ſomtimes to reioyce that they are in fauour: ſo haue they likewiſe continuall trouble and feare that they ſhall fall, and bee put out of fauour: And if they glory to haue great treaſure, they ſorrow alſo to haue enemies.
                     And if the ſeruices and company they haue, doe delight them, the continuall buſineſſe they haue do vex them: So that wee may ſay of them, as of plaſtering houſes, which are neuer ſo fayre, but they become blacke with ſome ſpotte in time, and wormes and other vermine doe eate and waſt them.
                     If there bee none that dare once admoniſh theſe great men in authority, and tell them their faultes by wordes of mouth: yet I will take vpon mee to doe it with my writing, and ſay: That they ſpeake nothing but that it is noted: their ſteps they treade are ſeene: euery morſell of meate they eate is marked, they are accuſed for the pleaſures they take, and all thinges that they haue are obſerued: All the pleaſures that is done them is regiſtred, and all ill that they know by them is publiſhed.
                     And finally, I conclude, that the The fauourites of the Court compared

                     And therefore I haue ſayde it, and once againe I returne to ſay: that all thoſe that are accepted of Princes muſt liue continually very wiſely, and aduiſedly in all their doings: for it is true, and too true, that euery mans tongue runnes of them, and much more if they had time and opportunity, like as they defame them with their tongues, ſo would they offende them with their hands.
                     Wee doe not ſpeake this ſo much that they ſhould looke to defend their life: but to foreſee that they may preſerue their honour and goods from perill, and to giue them by this precept a good occaſion to looke about them.
                     For to put them in diſgrace with the King, all the dayes of their Life, (to their vtter vndoing and ouerthrowe, the King neede but onely for to giue eare and attention to his enemies.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XVI. The Author admoniſheth thoſe that are in fauour, and great with the Prince, that they take heede of the deceipts of the world, and learne to liue, and dye honourably, and that they leaue the Court before age ouertake them,
                     
                     
                        WHen king Aldericke kept Seuerine the Romane Conſull Priſoner, otherwiſe named Boetius: that Conſull complained much of fortune, ſaying, alas Fortune, why haſt thou forſaken mee in my age, ſince thou diddeſt fauour mee ſo much in my youth, and that I had ſerued thee ſo many yeares, why haſt thou left me A Diſeourſe betwixt Fortune, &amp; the Conſul Seuerius. to the hands of mine enemies.
                     To which complaints Fortune made anſwere thus. Thou art vnthankeful to mee, O Seuerius, ſith I haue vſed my thinges with thee in ſuch manner, as I neuer vſed the like with any other Romane. And that this is true, I tell thee. Conſider, O Seuerius, that I made thee whole, and not ſicke: a man and no woman, of excellent witte and vnderſtanding, and not groſſe and rude, rich and not poore, wiſe and not fooliſh, free and not bound, a Senator, and no Plebeian, noble and valiant, and not cowardly, a Romane, and no Barbarian, or ſtranger borne: in great, and meane eſtate, a graue man, and no light nor vaine perſon, fortunate, and not vnlucky, worthy of fame, and not obliuion: to conclude I ſay, I gaue thee ſuch part in the common weale, that thou haddeſt good cauſe to haue pittie of all others, and all others cauſe to haue ſpight, and enuie at thee.
                     Againe replyed Seuerius to this anſwere and ſaide. Oh cruell and ſpightfull Fortune, how Liberall thou art in the things thou ſpeakeſt, and reſolute in the thinges thou diſpoſeſt: ſith alwayes thou doeſt what thou wilt, and ſeldome that thou oughteſt?
                     And thou knoweſt there is no ſuch miſhappe, as to remember a man hath once beene Rich, and Fortunate in his Time: and to ſee himſelfe now broght to extreame miſerie. Heare Fortune thou oughtſt to know it, if thou knoweſt it not, that hee that neuer was rich, ſcant knoweth his pouertie.
                     But alas for pittie, he that was rich, and had once all pleaſures and eaſe, doth ſorrow much for the preſent extreamitie, and bewayleth the fore-paſſed felicitie. And I tell thee alſo, and thou oughteſt to belieue me, that wee repute them more happy whom thou neuer exalteſt nor gaueſt honor vnto: then we do thoſe whom thou haſt called to high Honours, and afterwardes haſt ouer-throwne them, and brought them lower, and in worſer ſtate then before. And as for mee, Oh Fortune, I tell thee truely, I thinke no man fortunate, but him that neuer knew what good-fortune meant.
                     And this was the diſcourſe betwixt Fortune, and the Conſull Seuerius. By which wee may perceiue and comprehend, that truly none may be thought vnfortunate and miſerable, but ſuch as haue been before in great honour and reputation: and he cannot be thoght abaſed of his ſtate, or countenaunce, if he were not before in proſperitie, and fauoured of fortune. So that we may well ſay, That neuer no man in this world was ſo free, as he that neuer ſuffered Fortune to enter into his gates.
                     I haue been deſirous to tell you of theſe things, becauſe that ſuch as are in fauor and credit with Princes, ſhold not reckon too much of their fauour: neyther that thoſe that are not in fauour

with them, ſhould be ſorie for it a whit.
                     For the great authoritie and credite that a man hath by the Court, is in this mortall life in the ende nothing elſe then as a little worm in an apple, a wizell in the corne, and a magot in peaſe: which without, ſeem very good and within they are all rotten &amp; eaten.
                     Princes authoritie aboue all others is moſt ſupream: for they are not ſubiect to the Cenſors and Iudges, to reproue them of their wordes and ſayings: neither to magiſtrates, to whom they ſhould render vp any accounts of their doings, whereof proceedes, that as they haue free-will to loue, ſo haue they a free libertie to hate, and abſolute power to puniſh.
                     Therefore thoſe that are in fauor in Court, and they that ſhall read this How ſuddenly the fauours of princes change. wrytings of mine, muſt well conſider what we meane by all thoſe things we haue ſpoken: whereby they ſhall eaſily know, that Princes are no leſſe apte to hate him to day, they loued yeſterday: then to loue him to morrowe, whom they hated the other day.
                     The firſt and chiefeſt point the Courtyer ought to obſerue, is to feare GOD, aboue all: and to follow the profeſſion and life of a good Chriſtian.
                     For in the ende they liue in Court with more ſafety, hauing a good and pure conſcience, then with all the great credite and fauour they can haue.
                     And therfore let euery Courtyer belieue me, as well in fauor as out of faour: That it is the beſt &amp; ſureſt way to obtaine the goods of this world, as alſo for the preſeruation of their ſoules, to eſteeme and make account of holie Scriptures &amp; Gods commandements And if hee doe otherwiſe, it ſhall happen many times vnto him that in the diſpatch of his weyghtieſt affaires, and needefull buſineſſos, euen when hee ſhall thinke his matters brought to a proſperous ende, and that it is without all doubt of diſpatch: then ſteps in crooked fortune with her wonted poiſon againſt him, and either makes him in a manner beginne his ſuite new againe, or at leaſt ouerthrow it quite: For there are in Princes Courts many times certaine ſuites that haue a good and better end then looked for: and contrarily many others that are at the point of diſpatching, and yet by ſiniſter accident clean ouerthrowne, and ſucceeding contrary to their aſſured expectation.
                     And yet notwithſtanding it ſeemeth to the ſuiter, that the cauſe hereof commeth, eyther through the ſoliciters negligence and default, and litle care to follow it, or elſe through the malice and ill will of the fauoured of the Court, that tooke vpon him the ſuite: and yet neyther the one, nor the other was cauſe of the diſorder: but onely the diuine prouidence of God, to admoniſh vs that in all our actions and doings it little preuayleth vs to moue the King or his Officers in all our matters, if we doe not deſerue at Gods hands to obtaine it. And therefore ſayde the diuine Plato in his Timeon, that thoſe that haue honour and proſperity in this life, haue as A worthie ſaying of Plato, much neede of good counſell, as the poore afflicted creatures haue of help and remedy. And ſurely, it was wiſely and profoundly ſpoken of him: For as neede and miſery in this wretched life bringeth men to deſpayre: ſo likewiſe we ſee proſperity induce men to forget themſelues and their ſtate. And that which I haue hitherto ſpoken of, and that I hope yet to ſpeak, none can vnderſtand nor conceiue, but ſuch as once in their time, in their Nauigation had a fortunate and proſperous Winde: And afterwardes turning contrary, euen at the Shore ſide haue caſt them on Rockes and vtterly periſhed them.
                     To the end that thoſe in reading my

wrytings, may yet lament and mourne for pittie: where the others can but onely reade, and goe no further.
                     If we compare and put together the Rich with the poore, the ſorrowfull with the merry, the Fortunate with the vnfortunate: the fauoured, with the baniſhed, the vertuous and noble, with the vicious and defamed: wee ſhall finde without doubt the number of thoſe farre greater, that could riſe againe beeing downe, and had taken a fall: then thoſe that keepe themſelues in the authoritie and fauour, that Fortune had brought them to.
                     I haue not ſaide it a fewe times, but euery moment I would returne to ſay it againe, that this Trayterous worlde in all his doings is ſo deceytfull, and Fortune in all that ſhee promiſeth ſo doubtful, that they make them belieue whom they make Rich, beloued, and raiſe to high eſtate, that they doe it but to honour them: and afterwards contrarily they ſpinne a thouſand deceipts and trumperyes, to make them ſooner fall to the ground.
                     Surely I haue ſeene but fewe, and I remember I haue read of none, vnto whom Fortune euer ſhewed herſelfe ſo benigne and curteous, that euer put a man in his chiefeſt toppe of proſperitie, and fauour, but in fewe dayes after, ſhe tooke his life from him, or at leaſt in the ende of his iourney, ſhee made him runne into ſome ſecret diſgrace or miſhappe.
                     And therefore I would that the Courtyer that obtayneth fauour in the Court, and Riches in the Commonwealth: that he ſhould reckon and eſteeme them as lent him, but not giuen him: And that he ſhould ſo gouerne the things of fortune, as hee would that man whom hee truſted not at all. A worthy ſaving of Seneca.
                     
                     For, as Seneca ſaith: No man is afflicted with Fortune, But hee onely that truſteth to her, without feare or ſuſpect at all of her. For Courtyers, and thoſe that are in great fauor and authority ought to know that like as in the deepeſt ſeas ſooneſt periſh the ſhippes, and as on the higheſt mountains the Sunne hath alwayes leaſt force and power: and as in the greeneſt boughs is ſooneſt hidden the Fowlers little net, to catch the ſilly Byrdes: And as with the fulleſt bayts of meate the Fiſh are ſooneſt taken, &amp; that with great force the wind doth blow on higheſt trees, and as the moſt prowd and ſtately buildings, the Earth-quake doth moſt hurt and ſooneſt ouerthrow them: Euen ſo by this I meane, that Fortune neuer ſtroue to throw downe anie, but ſuch as ſhe had made great in honour and fauour.
                     For, I doe not take it for great good lacke (though all things ſuccede to be fauoured of the Court, better then hee looked for) nor to ſee them brought by their friends to great eſtate and honour, For albeeit fortune for a time diſſemble with him, it is not for that ſhe hath forgoten him, but afterwards to giue him a greater puniſhment.
                     Thoſe that will maruell at that I will ſpeake euen now, it proceedes of nothing elſe, but wanting wit, and capacitie, to vnderſtand it.
                     There is no greater ſicknes in this world, then to be in health: No greater pouertie, then neuer to haue neede of any thing. And there is no greater temptation, then to be neuer tempted Nor there can be no greater ſadneſſe, then to be alwayes merry: Nor greater daunger, then neuer to be in danger. For many times it ſo happeneth, that where a man thinketh to paſſe ouer a dangerous floud ſafe enough, his horſe falleth ouer head and eares, and drowneth his Maſter, or hee eſcapeth hardly.
                     
                        Socrates being one day demaunded A true ſaying of Socrates. which was the moſt ſure and certaine thing of this life? Aunſwered thus: There is nothing more certain in this life: then to account all things vncertaine hee
                        
                        hath: nor among Riches any greater, then to haue life and health: But if the life bee doubtfull and vnquyet, what ſuretie or certaintie may bee found in it? Surely none.
                     King Ageſilaus beeing requeſted of certaine of his Grecian captains, to go ſee the Olympiade, in mount Olympus: where all the philoſophers did aſſemble to diſpute, and where all the Rich men of the countrey came to buy and ſell any thing, he anſwered them.
                     If in mount Olympus they ſolde and exchanged ſorrow for mirth, ſickneſſe for health, honour for infamy, and life for death. I would not onely goe to ſee it, but I would alſo ſpend all that I The ſpeech of king Ageſilaus. am worth, and that I haue: But ſince the buyer is mortall, and the thing alſo hee buyeth condemned to death, I will buye nothing in this life, ſince I can not carrie it with mee, into my graue.
                     Yet is there another deceipt, which the poore Courtyers fall into daylie: and that is, that in liuing many yeares, they think and aſſuredly belieue in the ende to light of a time, when they hope to haue eaſe and reſt, which is a mockery to thinke it, and extreame madneſſe to hope for it. For if their years grow by ounce, and ounce, their ſorrowes and troubles encreaſe by pounds.
                     Who can denie, but that milke that is kept many dayes doth corrupt and becommeth ſower and ſharpe? Yea, the garments that are now very olde, and haue beene long worne (without that euer moth doth touch it) doth in the ende alſo become rags and duſt.
                     By this therefore I doe inferre, that if it be a moſt certain thing for young men to dye quickly, then much more ſhould olde men be aſſured that they haue no long time to liue.
                     And there are many in the Courts of Princes alſo, that finde themſelues ſo laden with ſinnes and wickedneſſe, that they thinke aſſuredly, that in changing their age, time, and fortune, they ſhall not onely leaue their vices, but ſhall be diſcharged alſo of manie grieues and troubles. Which we ſee afterwardes happen contrary to them.
                     For there is no way ſo plaine in this world, but there is ſome aſcent or diſcent for vs to goe vp to the toppe, or ſome Riuer for vs to paſſe ouer: or ſome terrible mountaine to feare, or ſome crooked ill-fauoured way, to looſe vs in, or ſome Caue or hole to fall into.
                     Thoſe alſo that thinke certainely that the Sunne cannot loſe his light, nor that the Moone can be eclipſed, nor that the ſtarres may be darkened, and that the earth ſhall not ceaſe to bring forth, the ſeas to flow, the water to runne, the fire to burne, and Winter to be cold, let them alſo bee aſſured, that man cannot bee excuſed to ſuffer and abide much. For ſure it is impoſſible hee ſhould paſſe one day without ſome trouble or ſiniſter hap of Fortune.
                     And the greateſt trumpery and deceite that Courtiers for the moſt part are abuſed in, is, that the more they waxe in yeares, the more they enter dayly into greater affayres and buſineſſe, with a vaine hope and aſſurance they haue to diſpatch them, and bring them to ſuch end, as they liſt or deſire. But afterwards when they come The follie of olde Courtiers. to looke into their matters, it is the wil of God, and their deſerts to procure it, that the poore old men find (when they thinke to goe home to their houſes) that they ſee death approach neare them, and they afterwardes are carried to be buried in their graues.
                     O how many are there in Court, that become aged men, by long ſeruing in Court, with a vaine hope afterwards in their age to depart from the Court, and to repoſe their aged yeares in their owne houſes, in

quyet and tranquilitie, which abuſeth them very much.
                     So that they may bee called Chriſtians in name, and thoughtes, but right worldlings, and Courtyers in doings. And therefore many times I reproued diuers olde Courtyers my Friendes, for that they did not leaue the Court when they might haue left it with honour, and commoditie: tellling them it was more then time now they ſhould depart from the Courte, ſeeing that Age and grauitie had ſtollen vpon them.
                     Who could not tell how to aunſwere me, nor what to ſay, more then they would within a ſhorte time, goe home to their houſes, with deliberation and intent to take their eaſe at home, for the better health of their perſons, which they had not till then: and ſo to ſeclude them from all doings, ſaue onely in the morning when hee riſeth, to goe to the Church and ſerue GOD: and from thence to go vnto the Hoſpitalls, to viſite the ſicke and diſeaſed, to ſeeke out the poore Orphanes and widowes amongſt his Neighbours, and to make peace between neighbour and neighbour, and to relieue the poore.
                     And albeit they haue tolde me this tale many a time and ofte, yet I neuer ſawe any of them put it in execution with good will.
                     And I ſaw once an honorable and rich Courtyer, who was ſo olde, that for very Age hee had neuer a blacke haire on his head, nor any Teeth in The fooliſh opinion of an olde Courtier. his mouth, neyther any Children, or Sonnes or Daughters to inherite his good: who notwithſtanding was of ſo fooliſh and phantaſticall opinion, (brought to that kinde of madneſſe by his ſinnes) that he ſware vnto me, that for the diſcharge of his Conſcience onely hee would neuer leaue, or giue vp his Office hee had in Courte, to chaunge that ſeruile trade and courſe of life, for to obtaine his quyet reſt at home. Thinking aſſuredly, that enjoying reſt at home, in his owne houſe, hee might eaſily be damned, and abyding the paines and ſeruice of Court, hee belieued vndoubtedly hee ſhould be ſaued.
                     Surely wee may aptly ſay, that this olde Courtyer was more then a Dotard, and that hee had marred the call of his conſcience: ſince hee belieued that it was a charge of Conſcience to depart the court.
                     The ambition to do much, and the couetouſneſſe to haue much, maketh the miſerable Courtyers belieue that they haue yet Time ynough to liue, and to repent themſelues, when they will.
                     So that in the Court, thinking to liue two yeares onely in their Age good men: they liue fiftie, and three ſcore yeares, naughty and wicked perſons.
                     
                        Plutarch in his Apothegmes ſayth that Eudonius that was Captain of the Greekes, ſeeing Zenocrates reading A worthy ſaying of Plutarch. one day in the vniuerſitie of Athens, hee being not of the age of eightie fiue yeares, asked what that old man was and it was anſwered him, that it was one of the Philoſophers of Greece, who followed vertue and ſerched to know wherein true Philoſophie conſiſted: Whereupon he anſwered, If Xenocrates the Philoſopher tell mee, that hee being now eightie fiue yeares old, goeth to ſeek vertue in this age, I would thou ſhouldeſt alſo tell me what time hee ſhould haue left him to bee vertuous.
                     And hee ſayde moreouer, in thoſe yeares that this Philoſopher is of, it were more reaſon we ſhould ſee him, doe vertuous things then at this age to goe and ſeeke it.
                     Truely we may ſay the very like of our new Courtier, that Eudonius ſayde of Xenocrates the Philoſopher,

the which if hee did looke for other threeſcore yeares, or threeſcore and ten to be good, what time ſhould remaine for him to proue and ſhew that goodneſſe.
                     It is no maruell at all, that the olde Courtiers forget their Natiue Countrey and bringing vp, their Fathers that begate them, their friendes that ſhewed them fauour, and the ſeruants that ſerued them: but at that I doe not onely wonder at them, but alſo it giueth mee cauſe to ſuſpect them, is, that I ſee they forget themſelues. So that they neuer know nor conſider that they haue to doe, till they come afterwardes to be, that they would not be.
                     If the Courtiers which in Princes Courts haue beene rich, noble, and in authority would counſell with me, or at leaſt beleeue my writing, they ſhold depart from thence in time, to haue a long time to conſider before of death, leaſt death vnawares, and ſuddenly came to take execution of their liues.
                     O happy, and thrice happy may we call the eſteemed Courtier, whom God hath giuen ſo much witte and knowledge to, that of himſelfe hee do depart from the Court, before fortune A good Caueat for Courtiers. hath once touched him with diſhonour, or laid her cruell handes vpon him: For I neuer ſaw Courtier, but in the end did complain of the Court and of their ill life that they ledde in Court. And yet did I neuer know any perſon that would leaue it for any ſcruple of conſciēce he had to remain there, but peraduenture if any did depart from the court, it was for ſome of theſe reſpects, or altogether, that is to ſay: Eyther that his fauour and credite diminiſhed, or that his money fayled him, or that ſome hath done him wrong in the court, or that hee was driuen from the court, or that he was denyed fauour, or that his ſide &amp; faction he helde with, had a fall, or for that hee was ſicke, for to gette his health, hee went into the Countrey.
                     So that they may ſay, hee rather went angrie and diſpleaſed with himſelfe, then hee did to lament his ſins: If you aske priuately euery Courtier, you ſhall finde none, but will ſay he is diſcontented with the Court, eyther becauſe he is poore, or afflicted, enuied, or ill willed, or out of fauour, and hee will ſweare and reſweare againe, that he deſireth nothing more in the World, then to be diſmiſſed of this Courtiers trauell and painefull Life: But if afterwards perchance a little winde of fauour be but ſtirring in the Entrey of his chamber dore, it will ſodenly blow away all the good and former thoughts from his mind. And yet that, which makes mee to wonder more at theſe vnconſtant Courtiers, and vnſtable braines, is, that I ſee many build goodly ſtately houſes in their countrey, and yet they neyther dwell in them, nor keepe hoſpitality there: They graffe and ſet trees, plant fruites, and make good Gardens and Orchards, and yet neuer goe to enioye them: they purchaſe great Landes and poſſeſſions, and neuer goe to ſee them.
                     And they haue offices and dignities giuen them in their Countryes, but they neuer goe for to exerciſe them.
                     There they haue their friends and parents, and yet they neuer goe for to talke with them. So they had rather be ſlaues and drudges in the court, then lords &amp; rulers in their own countrey: we may iuſtly ſay that many courtiers are poore in riches, ſtrangers in their owne houſes, and Pilgrimes in their Countrey, and baniſhed from all their kindreds.
                     So that if wee ſee the moſt part of theſe Courtiers, backbite, murmure

complaine, and abhorre theſe vices they ſee daily committed in Court.
                     
                     I dare aſſure you, that this diſcontentation and diſlyking proceeds not only of thoſe vices and errors then ſee committed, as of the ſpight and enuie they haue daylie, to ſee their Enemyes, growe in fauour and credite with the Prince. For they paſſe little of the vices of Court, ſo they may be in fauour as others are.
                     
                        Plutarch in his book De exilio, ſheweth, that there was a Law amongſt the Thebanes, that after a man was fiftie yeares of age, if he fell ſicke, he ſhould not bee holpen with Phyſitians. For, they ſay, that after a man is once arriued vnto that age, he ſhould deſire to liue no longer, but rather to haſten to his iourneys ende,
                     By theſe examples wee may know that infancie is, till vii. yeares: Childhood to xiiii. yeares: Youth to xxv. yeares: manhood till xl. and Age to three-ſcore-yeares. But once paſſed three-ſcore, me thinks it is rather time to make cleane the nettes, and to content thēſelues with the Fiſh they haue till now, then to go about to put their nets in order againe to fiſh any more. I grant that in the Courts of princes all may be ſaued: &amp; yet no man can deny mee, but that in princes Courts there are mo occaſions to be damned then ſaued.
                     For, as Cato the Cenſor ſaith: The apt occaſions bring men a deſire to do yll, though they be good of themſelues. And although ſome do take vpon them and determine to leade a godly and holie life, or that they ſhew themſelus' great hypocrites: yet am I aſſured notwithſtanding that they cannot keepe their tongue frō murmuring, nor their hart from enuying. And the cauſe hereof proceedeth, for that ther are very few that follow the Court long but onely to enter into credit, and afterwards to vaxe rich, and growe in great authoritie.
                     Which cannot bee without bearing a little ſecret hate and enuy againſt thoſe that doe paſſe them in this fauour and authority; and without, ſuſpect and feare of others, which in 
                           〈◊〉
                         are their equals and companions. It were a good counſell for thoſe that haue 
                           〈◊〉
                         the Court or Princes till they be 
                           〈◊〉
                         old and gray headed, that they ſhould determine and liue the reſt of their yeares as good Chriſtians, and not to paſſe them as Courtiers: ſo that though they haue giuen the world a meale, yet they ſhould in the end giue the brain to Ieſus Chriſt. I know euery man deſireth to liue in Princes Courts, and yet they promiſe they will not dye in Court. And ſince it is ſo, mee thinkes it is a great folly and preſumption for ſuch men to deſire to liue long in ſuch ſtate, where they would not dye for all the golde in the world.
                     I haue liued in the Court manie yeares, and at this preſent I haue forſaken it quite: wherefore I dare boldly ſay, that if once a man come to enioy a qui life, and repoſed reſt, I am aſſured he would for euer hate and diſlike to be a Courtier longer.
                     But like as theſe ſenſeles Courtiers 
                           
                              〈…〉
                           
                         remember not the Life for to come, but onely account of theyr vaine and Courtly Life preſent, reputing that the moſt bleſſed and happie of any other.
                     So God ſeeing theyr folly and their fond addicted minde to the vanitie of Court to plague them, and ſcourge them there withall, withtheir owne rodde, doth great them no other nor better reſt, then that they onely enioy in Princes Courts, and ſo feedes them with their owne humour. And therefore it is very truely ſayde. That reſt and contentation neuer endeth into a 
                           〈◊〉
                         houſe.
                     
                        
O you worthy and Noble Courtiers, O you bleſſed and fauoured Courtiers, I will remember you, yea and againe remember, that you preſume not to cut or pull off the winges of Time, ſince you neyther ſhall haue time nor meane to plucke one feather from him: much leſſe the leaſt knowledge how to doe it.
                     And therefore it is ſayde, Ill cutteth the knife if the edge bee broken, and ill can hee gnaw bones that lacketh his teeth.
                     
                     And if hee ſeeme good vnto you and me alſo, That to day it is Time to gather the fruit of the vine of our youth, Let vs go now againe to ſeeke it about by the meanes of our amendment.
                     And if the Pipe or Caske wherein wee ſhoulde put our Wine bee fuſty, with the malignity and peruerſneſſe of our wicked doings. Let vs ſeaſon them with new and better Wine of good and holy deſires. And now to conclude, if to ſequeſter themſelues from Court, it be a wholeſome Counſell for Courtiers: much more wholeſome and neceſſarie it is for ſuch as beare ſway and reputation about the Prince. For other Courtiers doe dayly liue in hope to enlarge theyr countenance and credite, and to grow in fauour and authority: But theſe Darlinges and Beloued of Princes are continually afrade to fall, and vtterly to bee put out of fauour.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XVII. Of the continency of fauoured Courtiers, and how they ought to ſhunne the company and conuerſation of vnhoneſt women, and to bee carefull quickly to diſpatch all ſuch as ſue vnto them.
                     
                     
                        
                           TItus Liuius, and Plutarch writeth, that the Romanes had in In what veneration the ancients held them that were continent. ſuch veneration thoſe men that liued chaſte, and thoſe women alſo that profeſſed virgins Life, that they erected ſtatues of them in the Senate houſe, carrying thē thorough the City in triumphant chariots, recommending themſelues to their deuout prayers, and giuing them great gifts and preſents: and finally adored them as gods: and this was their reaſon, in that they honoured them as gods: for that they being of fleſh, and liuing in fleſh, did leaue to vſe the workes and inſtinct of the fleſh, which they helde a thing more diuine then humane.
                     
                        Filoſtratus ſayeth, that Appoloneus Thianeus was borne without any pain or griefe to his mother in all her travell. And that the gods ſpake to him in his eare, that hee rayſed the deade to life, healed the ſicke, knew the thoughts of men, diuined of things to come, how hee was ſerued with Princes, honoured of the people, and followed of all the Philoſophers: &amp; yet they did not make ſo great a wonder of all theſe things ſpoken of him, as they did for that hee was neuer married, and moreouer neuer detected with the knowledge of any woman liuing, much leſſe ſuſpected.
                     
                        
Whileſt Carthage was enuironed with ſiege on each ſide, a Virgine of Numidia taken priſoner, was preſented to Scipio, and ſhe was very fayre: which Scipio notwithſtanding, would not onely not deflower, but ſet her at liberty, and married her very honourably.
                     Which act of his was more appriſed of the Roman writers, then was his conqueſt of Numedia, the reſtoring of Rome her liberty, the deſtruction of Carthage, the ſuccour and reliefe giuen to Aſia, and the enobling of his Common wealth: For in all theſe enterpriſes hee ſtill fought againſt others, but in the effects of the fleſh, hee fought againſt himſelfe. And therefore hee muſt needes be maruellous wiſe, and of good iudgement, that can ſubdue the deſires and motions of the fleſh: For wee doe as much couet to follow theſe carnall deſires, as wee are apt to our meate when wee are hungry. Cruell and bitter are the aſſaultes of the fleſh to the ſpirite, and wonderful is the paine the Spirite abideth, to reſiſt the motions of the ſame, which by no meanes can be ouercome, but by eſchewing the occaſions thereof. As in brideling the deſires, puniſhing the fleſh, liuing with ſpare dyet, increaſing learning, giuing himſelfe to tears and altogether ſhutting the gates of our deſires.
                     O if this vice of the fleſh came of aboundance of heate, or rage of bloud, we might ſoon remedy it with letting our ſelues bloud: If it were any ſickneſſe of the heart, it ſhould be cured by interiour medicines: If of the liuer, wee would refreſh it with ointments.
                     If of Melancholy humour, wee would waſh away al the Opilations. If of choler, wee would procure eaſie purges: But alas, it is a diſeaſe ſo farre from pitty, that it miſliketh wee ſhould call for Phyſitians, and cannot abide wee ſhould offer it any remedy.
                     It cannot bee denyed, but that ciuill warre is moſt grieuous and dangerous in a Common-wealth: But much more perillous is that at home, betwixt the husband and the wife: but moſt ieoperdious of all is, that a man hath within himſelfe: For wee cannot reckon any other our enemy, but our owne deſires.
                     I remember I ſaw once written in a Courties houſe theſe wordes, which truely deſerued to bee written in golden Letters: and the words were theſe:
                     
                        The dreadefull Warves that I alas ſuſtaine, 
                        A worthy ſentence, and worthy to be engrauen in euery mans heart.
                     
                     
                        Where blinde deſire, becomes my mighty foe:
                     
                     
                        Againſt my ſelfe, perforce my ſelfe doth ſtraine
                     
                     
                        The wreckfull Gods, vouchſafe it doe not ſo.
                     
                     Surely, hee that wrote this for his word, wee thinke hee was no foole, nor euill chriſtian, ſith hee neither ſought for money, nor by ſleight of witte procured to deceiue or beguile neither he called his friendes to helpe him to withſtand his enemies, but only craued remedy againſt his vnhoneſt and vain deſires. And vndoubtedly he had reaſon: for a man may eaſily abſent himſelfe, it is an impoſſible thing. And therfore me thinks it is a thing more to be lamented then written, to ſee that a multitude of corporall enemies, cannot vanuquiſh vs, and yet notwithſtanding when wee are alone, and thinke nothing of it, this only vice of the fleſh, dooth not alone make vs ſtumble, but fal downe on the groūd: for neither to becom religious, a frier, nor to dwell in churches, nor to be ſhut vp in cloyſters, to ſequeſter

our ſelues from the world, nor yet to chaunge ſtate and condition: For all this I ſay, I ſee none of al theſe things helpe vs mortall men, to defende vs from this vice and ſinne. But the further we ſeeke to flye from it, the more daunger we finde to fall into it. And albeit to auoyd other vices and ſinnes it ſhall ſuffice vs to bee admoniſhed: yet againſt that alone of the fleſh, it behoueth vs to bee armed. For there is no ſinne in the world, but there are meanes for men to auoyd it: This only excepted of the fleſh, wherewith all wee are ouercome, and taken Priſonners. And to proue this true it is apparant thus.
                     Where raigneth Pride, but amongſt the Potentates? where Enuie but amongſt equalls? Anger, but amongſt the impacient? Gluttony, but amongſt gourmands? auarice, but amongſt the Rich? ſlouth, but amongſt the ydle? And yet for all theſe, the ſinne of the Fleſh, generally reigneth The ſinnes of the fleſh goeth beyond all other. in all men.
                     And therefore, for not reſiſting this abhominable vice, we haue ſeen kings loſe their kingdoms, Noblemen their Lands and poſſeſſions: the marryed wiues their auowd faith: the religious nunnes, their profeſſed virginitie: So that wee may compare this ſinne, to the nature and condition of the venemous ſerpent, which being aliue ſtings vs, and after hee is dead, offendeth vs with his noyſome ſtinke.
                     Examples by Dauid, who for all his wiſedome could not preuaile againſt this ſinne: nor Salomon, for al his great knowledge: nor Abſolon for all his diuine beautie: nor Sampſon, with his mighty force: which notwithſtāding the great Fame they had, for their renowmed vertues: yet through this only defect they loſt all: accompanying with harlots &amp; licentious women. Into which ſhameful felowſhip fell alſo Holofernes, Haniball, Ptholomeus, Pyr-Pirrhus, Inlius Caeſar, Auguſtus, Marcus Antonius, Seuerus, and Theodorius, and many other great Princes, with theſe aboue recited: the moſt part of the which we haue ſeene depriued of their Crownes, and afterwards themſelues haue come (to their vtter ſhame and diſhonour, on their knces to yeelde themſelues to the mercy of theſe their infamed louers, crauing pardon, and forgiueneſſe.
                     Many graue Writers of the Grecians ſay, that the Ambaſſadours of Lidia comming one day into the chamber of Hercules, vpon a ſuddaine to ſpeake with him, they found him lying in his Curteſans lappe, ſhe pulling his rings off on his fingers, hee dreſſed on his head with her womanly attire: and ſhe in exchnnge on hers bedect with his royall crowne.
                     They write alſo of Denis the Syracuſian, that albeit of nature hee was more cruell then the wild beaſt, yet he became in the end ſo tractable, and pleaſant, by meanes of a Curtezan his friend called Mirta, that ſhe only did confirme all the prouiſions and depeches of the affayres of the Weale publike, and he onely did but ordaine and appoint them. And if the Hiſtories written of the Gothes deceyne vs not, wee finde that Antenaricus the famous king of the Gothes, after he had triumphed of Italy, and that hee had made himſelfe Lord of all Europe, hee became ſo farre in loue with a Louer of his called Pincia: the whileſt ſhee combed his head, hee made cleane her ſlippers.
                     Alſo Themiſtocles, the moſt famous Captaine of the Greekes, was ſo enamoured of a woman hee had taken in the Warres of Epirns, that ſhee beeing afterwardes very ſicke: when ſhee purged her ſelfe, hee would alſo bee purged with her: If ſhee were let bloud, hee would alſo bee let bloud: and yet that that is worſt to bee liked,

is, that hee waſhed his face with the bloud that came out of her Arme: ſo that they might truly ſay, though ſhee were his priſoner, yet hee was alſo her ſlaue and ſubiect.
                     When King Demetrius had taken Rhodes, there was broght to him a faire gentlewomen of the Cittie, which he made his friend in loue: and this loue betwixt them, in time grewe ſo great, that ſhe ſhewing her ſelfe vpon a time to be angry with Demetrius, and refuſing to ſit neare him at the Table, and alſo to lye with him: Demetrius vtterly forgetting himſelfe, and his royall eſtate, did not onely on his knees pray her to pardon him, but alſo imbracing her, conueighed her in his armes into his chamber.
                     
                        Myronides the Grecian, albeit hee had made ſubiect to him the kingdom of Boetia, yet hee was notwithſtanding made ſubiect with the beautie of Numidia his louer. Hee enflamed thus with loue of her, &amp; ſhe likewiſe ſtrucken with couetous deſire of his goods, in fine they agreed, that he ſhold giue her all the ſpoyle he had wonne in the warres of Boetia: and that ſhe ſhould let him lye with her in hir houſe onely one night.
                     
                        Hanniball made warres xvii. yeares with the Romaines, and in all that time he was neuer vanquiſhed, till hee was ouercome with the Loue of a young mayden in the cittie of Capua: which proued a moſt bitter loue to him: ſith thereby it happened, that whereas hee had ſo many yeares kept in ſubiection all Italie: hee now was made a ſubiect at home in his owne countrey.
                     
                        Plutarch in his booke De Republica, writeth: That Phalaris the Tyraunt would neuer graunt a man any thing that he deſired: neyther euer denyed Plutark de Repub. any thing that a diſſolute Woman requeſted.
                     No ſmall, but great diſorder happened to the Common-weale of Rome by the occaſion of the Emperour Caligula, who gaue but 6000. Sexterces onely to repayre the Walls of Rome: and gaue otherwiſe for furring one one gowne alone of his Lemmans, a 10000. ſexterces.
                     By all theſe examples aboue recited, wee may eaſily vnderſtand, how daungerous a thing it is for the Courtier to haue friendſhippe and acquaintance with women of ſo vile a facultie: For the woman is of like quality, that a knot tyed of corde is, which is eaſily tyed of ſundry knots, and very hardly afterwards to bee vndone againe.
                     Heretofore wee haue beſought Courtiers, and the fauoured of Princes, that they ſhould not bee ſo liberall in commaunding: and now once againe wee pray them to beware of fornication and adultery; for albeeit this ſinne of the fleſh be not the greateſt in fault, yet it is the moſt daungerous in fame.
                     There is no King, Prelate, nor knight in this World ſo vicious, and diſhoneſt It is impoſſible that the Courtier that liueth diſordinately, ſhould continue in fāuour with the Prince. of life, but would be glad to haue honeſt, vertuous, and well conditioned ſeruants, ſo that it is impoſſible therefore for the fauoured Courtier, liuing diſhoneſtlie, to continue any long time in fauour with his Prince: For wee haue ſeene many in Princes Courts, and Common Weales alſo, that haue loſt their honour, fauour, &amp; riches, not for any pride they ſhewed in themſelues, nor for enuy that they had, nor for any treaſure nor riches that they robbed, nor for any euil words that they ſhould ſpeake, neither for any treaſon that they committed, but onely through the euill fame that went of them for haunting the company of naughty women: for women be of the right nature of Hedgehogs, which without ſeeing or knowing what they haue in their heart, do notwithſtanding drawe bloude of vs

with their prickes.
                     And let not any man deceyue himſelfe, hoping that if hee did commit a fault through the fleſh, that it ſhal be kept from the Princes cares, or that it ſhall not bee blazed abroad in the Court. For this ſinne is of ſuch a qualitie, that though it may bee hidden within Curtaines: yet it cannot bee kept ſilent with tongues.
                     How wiſe and ſlie ſoeuer a woman bee, yet at all times when ſhee giueth eare vnto mens requeſts, euen at that proſent ſhee reſolueth to impart the whole with ſome friend of hers. For theſe women doe glory more, to bee the friend of a Courtier, then to bee a true wife vnto their husbands. I haue my ſelfe ſeene in Princes Courtes many

Alas, what pitty is it to ſee thoſe affected Courtiers, what meanes they vſe to win a Ladies fauour, what pleaſaunt purpoſes and diſcourſe they put forth vnto them, what bitter ſignes they let fall, what ſeruice they offer them, what Iewels they giue them, what caſtles in the ayre they promiſe them, what ſorrowes they fayne, and what lyes they make them belieue: and theſe ſilly women (by nature proud and fooliſh) are with a few gifts ouercome, &amp; with a fewe flattering wordes beguiled.
                     Now let this Courtier and his Lady continue this mutuall friendſhip betweene them, one, two, three foure, or fiue yeares, though perhappes not fully theſe yeares compleate neyther many monethes alſo, and you ſhall ſee in the end vndoubtedly a maruellous breach, and hate betwixt them.
                     For this amorous Courtier, that ſo dearely ſeemed to loue his Lady, will now make court a freſh to others, to diſlike that heretofore he loued, and flie from her whom erſt hee followed, abhorring that once hee delighted in, miſliking the taſte of thoſe meats that once were ſweet and pleaſant to him: and cannot abide her face now, whoſe Image before hee had engrauen in his minde.
                     So if he before had ſpent 3. yeares ſeruice in making her his Miſtreſſe, he ſpendeth now 6. other yeares in the Courtiers muſt beware of diſhoneſt women. forgotting of her.
                     And therefore theſe Noble Courtiers and Beloued of Princes muſt beware they make not theſe young and diſhoneſt loues common in euery place: For the ſweete and fragrant Roſe which they ſeeke to gather, continueth ſcantly one houre: but the prickes and plagues of the pearſing thorne, reſteth hidden in their fleſh, their whole life time after.
                     A man erreth in nothing more in this World, then in taking to his charge a diſhoneſt woman: For if hee will bring her with him to the Court, ſhee ſhall ſhame him, put him to an vnreaſonable charge, beſides the burthen of his conſcience.
                     And if afterwards hee would put her away from him, ſhe wil not depart for any thing: and if he would compel

her to it, ere ſhee departe it will be all the Court ouer: ſo what things haue paſt betwixt them two alone in ſecret, ſhall afterwardes be knowne of euery man abroade. And therefore we haue not cauſeleſſe tolde you, that it muſt needs be a maruellous expence to the Courtyer to bring his louer with him, in the Court. For he muſt alwayes be at the charges to keepe a page, maide, or gentlewoman, to wayte vpon her.
                     He muſt content the Hoſteſſe of his houſe to lodge her ſecretly, pleaſe the Marſhall to ſeeme not to knowe of it, the Harbinger that hee prepare him a good lodging, the page that hee be diligent, and at her hand: and her ſelfe alſo muſt haue to liue withall. So that the expence and charge hee ſhall be at with her, muſt needs farre exceede all the benefites and commodity he hath by the Court.
                     And beſides that, hee may aſſure himſelfe, that this their leawde and fonde loue cannot long endure, neyther can care alſo of her ſelfe be kept ſecret. For, eyther his Hoſteſſe that lodged her, or the Bawde that procureth theyr meetings, or the page that bringeth commendations and meſſages betwixt thē, or the neighbors that ſee him frequent the houſe, or the ſeruant that ſhall ſuſpect him, or the mother that ſolde her vnto him, in the ende will bewray their ſecret practiſe and friendſhip. Whereof ſpringeth afterwards diſdaine, and from diſdain, to defame each other: So that of extreame Louers they were firſt, they afterwards become mortall Enemyes:
                     And therefore the Wiuell is not ſo hurtfull to the Corne, nor the locuſt to the Oates, nor the wormes to the vines, nor maggots to the fruit, nor the moths to the garments, as the woman is to a man, that once was his friende, and now become his enemie. For like as in time of her loue, ſhe robbed and ſpoyled him of all his goods: ſo likewiſe in the time of her hatred, ſhe deuoureth all his good fame and reputation.
                     But what ſhall wee ſay of the man that contenteth not himſelfe with one friend alone, but like an vnſatiable leacher taketh vpon him to keep another. Truly I cannot tell what to ſay of this man, but that it had beene better for him he had neuer been borne, then to haue kept company with ſuch vile and common women. For he ſhall neuer appeaſe the firſt, neyther with anger, nor flattery: nor humble her with preſents, nor can expell her hatred with promiſes, neyther pleaſe her with cheriſhing of her, and much leſſe ſhall ouercome her with threats.
                     The Ocean ſea is not ſo daungerous, nor the ſword of the tyrant ſo cruell, neyther lightning ſo ſuddaine nor Earthquakes ſo horrible and fearefull, nor Serpents ſo venemous as a What dāger followeth the courtier that keepeth leawd women. Harlot, when ſhe doth but ſuſpect her friend loueth another beſide her ſelfe: for ſhee ceaſeth not to defame him, and to follow the other, to raiſe a ſlander amongſt her neighbours, to complaine to his friends, to bewray the matter to the Iuſtice, to quarrell with Officers, alwayes to haue ſpyes for him in euery place, as if hee were one of her mortall enemies.
                     Oh would to GOD the Courtyer would eſteeme as much of his conſcience, as his Louer maketh account of his perſon: happie were hee. For, I dare aſſure him, if he know it not, that ſhee ſpyeth out all the places hee goeth to, and counteth euery morſell of meate he eateth, and becommeth iealous of all that hee doeth, and of all thoſe whoſe companie hee frequenteth: yea, ſhe deuiſeth and imagineth all that hee thinketh. So that he that ſeeketh a cruell reuenge of his enemy, cannot doe better then perſwade and induce him to loue one of theſe wellconditioned gentle-women.
                     
                        
Now let him thinke that he hath great warres, and by his euill hap hath made her his enemie, which heretofore hee ſo entirely loued: For any man that eſteemeth his honour and reputation, doth rather feare the euill tongue of ſuch a woman, then the ſword of his enemy. For an honeſt man to ſtriue, and contend with a woman of ſuch quality, is euē as much as if hee would take vpon him to waſh an aſſes head. Therefore hee may not ſeeme to make account of thoſe iniuries done him, or euill words ſhee hath ſpoken of him. For women naturally deſire to enioy the perſon they loue, without let or interruption of any, and to purſue to the death, thoſe they hate. I would wiſh therefore the fauoured of Princes, and ſuch as haue office and dignity in the court that they beware they incurre not into ſuch like errors: For it is not fitting that men of honour, and ſuch as are great about the Prince, ſhould ſeeme to haue more liberty in vice then any other, neyther for any reſpect ought the beloued of the Prince to dare to keepe company, much leſſe to haue friendſhippe with any ſuch common and defamed women, ſith the leaſt euill that can come to them, they cannot be auoided.
                     But at the leaſt hee muſt charge his conſcience, trouble his friends, waſte his goods, conſume his perſon, and loſe his good fame, ioining withall theſe alſo, his concubine to bee his mortall enemy: For there is no woman liuing that hath any meaſure in louing, nor end in hating. Oh how warily ought all men to liue, and ſpecially we that are in the Court of Princes for many women (vnder the colour of their authority and office) go ofttimes to ſeeke them in their Chambers, not onely as humble ſuiters, to ſolicite their cauſes, but alſo liberally to offer them their perſons, and ſo by colour to conclude their practiſes and deuiſes: So that the deciſion and cō
                        cluſion of proces which they faine to ſolicite, ſhall not goe with him that demaunds there goods of them, but rather with him that deſires but their perſons to ſpoyle them of theyr honour.
                     Now the Princes officers muſt ſeeke to be pure, and cleane from al theſe practiſes of theſe commō ſtrumpets, much more from thoſe that are ſuters to them, and haue matters before them. For they ſhould highly offend God, and commit great treaſon to the king, if they ſhould ſende thoſe Women from them that ſued vnto them rather diſhonored and defamed, then honeſtly diſpatched of their buſineſſe.
                     And therefore he bindeth himſelfe to a maruellous inconuenience, that falleth in loue with a woman ſuter: for euen from that inſtant hee hath receiued of her the ſweet delights of loue, euen at the preſent hee bindeth himſelf to diſpatch her quickly, and to end all her ſuites, and not without great griefe I ſpeake theſe words.
                     There are many women that come to the Court of Princes, to make vnreaſonable and diſhoneſt ſutes, which in the end, notwithſtanding obtaine their deſire: And not for any right or reaſon they haue to it: ſaue onely they haue obtained it through the fauour and credite they haue wonne of the fauoured Courtier, or of one of his beloued: So as wee ſee it happen many times, that the vniuſt furnication, made her ſuit iuſt and reaſonable. I ſhould lye and doe my ſelfe wrong me thinkes, if I ſhould paſſe ouer with ſilence a thing that hapned in the Emperours Court touching this matter: in the which I went one day to one of the princes chiefe officers, and beſt beloued of him, to ſolicit a matter of importāce which an hoſtes of mine

ſhould haue before him.
                     And ſo this fauoured Courtier, and great Officer after hee had hearde of men the whole diſcourſe of the matter, for full reſolution of the ſame, hee asked mee, if ſhee were yong and fayre, and I aunſwered him that ſhee was reaſonable fayre, and of good fauour.
                     Well then (ſayth he) bid her come to mee, and I will doe the beſt I can to diſpatch her matter with ſpeede, for I will aſſure you of this, that there neuer came fayre woman to my handes, but ſhee had her buſineſſe quickly diſpatcht at my hands.
                     I haue knowne alſo many women in the Court ſo diſhoneſt, that not contented to follow their owne matters, would alſo deale with others affayres, and gaine in feliciting theyr cauſes, ſo that they with theyr fine wordes and franke offer of their perſons obtayned that, which many times to men of honour, and great authority was denyed.
                     Therefore theſe great Officers &amp; fauoured of Princes ought to haue great reſpect, not onely in the conuerſation they haue with theſe Women: but alſo in the honeſt order they ought to obſerue in hearing their cauſes. And that to bee done in ſuch ſort, that whatſoeuer they ſay vnto them may bee ſecret, prouided alſo the place where they ſpeake with them, bee open for other Suiters in like caſe.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XVIII. That the Nobles and Beloued of Princes, exceede not in ſuperfluous fare, and that they bee not too ſumptuous in their meates. A notable Chapter for thoſe that vſe too much delicacy and ſuperfluitie.
                     
                     
                        THe greateſt care &amp; regard that Nature laide vpon her ſelfe was that men could not liue without ſuſtinance: ſo that ſo long as wee ſee a man eate (yea if it were a thouſande yeares) wee might bee bolde to ſay, that hee is certainely aliue. And hee hath not alone layde this burden vpon men, but on bruite beaſts alſo: For wee ſee by experience, that ſome feedeth on the graſſe in the fieldes ſome liues in the ayre, eating flyes, others vpon the wormes in carring, others with that they finde vnder the water: And finally, each beaſt liueth of other and afterwardes the wormes feede of vs all. And not onely reaſonable men and brute beaſts liue by eating, but the trees are nouriſhed thereby; and wee ſee it thus, that they in ſtead of meate, receiue into them for nutriture the heate of the Sunne, the temperature of the ayre, the moiſture of the earth, any dewe of heauen: ſo that the ſuſtenance for men is called meate, and that of plants and trees increaſe. This beeing true therefore that wee haue ſpoken, we muſt needes confeſſe, that to liue wee muſt eate: and yet withall, wee muſt vnderſtand that the ſin of gluttony conſiſteth not in that that wee eate for neceſſity, but only in that

that is eaten with a diſordinate appetite and deſire. And ſure now a dayes men vſe not to eate to content nature, but to pleaſe their licorous and dainty mouthes.
                     Hee that giueth him ſelfe ouer to the deſire of the throate, doth not onely offend his ſtomacke, and diſtemper his body, but hurteth alſo his conſcience: for all gluttons and drunkards are the children, or the brothers of ſinne.
                     And I ſpeake but little to ſay, that the mouth and ſinne are c
                           •
                        ſin Germanes together: for by their effects and operations me thinketh them ſo knit and combined together, as the Father and the Sonne: Sith burning Leacherie acknowledgeth none other for her mother, but onely the infatiable and gurmand throate. And the diuerſity of meates is but a continuall and importunate awaking of diſhoneſt thoughts. Doe we not reade of S. Hierome, that albeit hee remained in the wilderneſſe, burned of the Sunne his face dryed vp, and wrinkled, bare footed, and alſo bare headed, clothed with ſackcloth, his body ſcourged with bitter ſtripes, watching in the night, and faſting and hungering in the day, continually exerciſing his pen and his heart in contemplation, and yet for all this grieuous penance, him ſelfe confeſſed, that in his ſleepe, hee dreamed and thought he was among the Curtezans of Rome, and S. Paul the Apoſtle, who was a man of rare &amp; exquiſite knowledge, and deſerued to ſee the very ſecretes of Paradiſe, neuer here to fore ſeene, trauelling in his vocation more then any other of the Apoſtles, did not he get his liuing with The painefull trauel and induſtry of Saint Paul. his owne hands: and alſo went a foote preaching through all the world, bringing infinite barbarous people to the faith of Chriſt, being beaten in the day time by others, for that hee was a Chriſtian, and in the night time hee beat himſelfe for that he was a ſinner, puniſhing the fleſh, to make it ſubiect to the ſpirit. And yet neuertheleſſe he layth of himſelfe, that he coulde not defend himſelfe from diſhoneſt thoughts which did euer let him to preach and pray with a quiet minde: Saint Auſten reciteth of himſelfe in his booke De conſeſſionibus, that all the while he inhabited in the deſerts, hee eate little, wrote much, prayed oft, &amp; ſharpely chaſtiſed his body, with continuall faſts and grieuous diſciplines: But yet perceyuing that notwithſtanding all this, his diſhoneſt thoughtes ſuppreſſed his holy deſires, he began to crye with a lowde voyce thorough the deſerts, and rocky hils, ſaying. O Lord my God, thou commaundeſt me to be chaſt, but this fraile and accurſed fleſh can neuer keepe it. And therefore I humbly beſeech thee firſt to indue mee with thy grace, to doe that thou wilt haue me, and then commaund me what ſhall pleaſe thee: otherwiſe I ſhall neuer doe it.
                     If therefore theſe glorious Saints with their continual faſts and contemplations, and extreame puniſhing of their bodies, could not defend themſelues from the burning motion of the fleſh, how ſhal we beleeue that a company of drunkards and gluttons, can doe it, which neuer linne bibbing and eating. Wee may bee aſſured that the leſſe we pamper and feede our bodies with delicacy and idlenes, the morewe ſhall haue them obedient and ſubiect to our willes: For though wee ſee the fire neuer ſo great and flaming, yet it quickely waſteth, and is brought to aſhes, if wee leaue for to put more wood vnto it.
                     Exceſſe is not onely vnlawfull for the body, but it is alſo an occaſion of a thouſand diſeaſes both to the body &amp; ſoule: For to ſay the truth, wee haue ſeene more rich men die through exceſſe, then poore men of neceſſity.
                     
                        
And in mine opinion, mee thinkes the ſinne of Gluttonie need not to be otherwiſe puniſhed by diuine iuſtice, ſeeing that of it ſelfe it bringeth pennaunce ynough. And to proue this true: Let vs but require theſe gluttons to tell vs vpon their Oathes, how they finde themſelues in temper being full paunched? and they will confeſſe vnto vs, that they are worſe at eaſe then if they had faſted.
                     That their mouth is drye, their bodie heauie, and yll-diſpoſed, that their head aketh, their ſtomack is colde, and that Eyes are ſleepie, and their bellyes full, but that yet they deſire to drinke ſtill. And therefore Dyogenes Cinicus, deryding the Rhodians, ſayde theſe words:
                     Oh you drunken and gluttonous Rhodians: Tell mee I beſeech you, What occaſion mooues you to go to the Church, to pray to the Gods, to giue you health, when at al times keeping ſober diet, you may keepe it with you? And moreouer hee ſayde vnto them alſo: and if you wil be ruled by my counſell, I will tell yee, you neede not goe to the Churches, to beſeech the gods to graunt you health, but only to pray vnto them, to pardon you your ſinnes and iniquities you daylie commit. Alſo Socrates the Phyloſopher was wont to ſay to his diſciples, of the vniuerſitie of Athens:
                     
                     Remember Oh you Athenians, that in the well-gouerned pollicies, men liue not to eat, to glut the bodie: but A worthy ſpeech of Socrates the phyloſopher. doe onely eate to liue, and ſuſtaine the bodie.
                     O graue ſaying of the good philoſopher! and I would to GOD that euery good Chriſtian would carry this leſſon in minde. For, if we would but let Nature alone, and giue her libertie, and diſpoſition, of her ſelfe, ſhe is ſo honeſt, and of ſuch temperance, that ſhe wil not leaue to eate that that ſhal ſuffice her, neyther will alſo trouble vs with that that is ſuperfluous.
                     Yet an other foule offence bringeth this vice of Gluttonie, and that is, That many put thēſelues in ſeruice to waite on others: not ſo much for the Ordinary fare that is commonly vſed in their houſe, as for the deſire they haue to fill their bellies with dainty and ſuperfluous meates. And in eſpeciall, when they knowe they make any marriages or feaſts for their Friends, then giue double attendance, not contented alone with that themſelues haue eaten, but further in remembrance of the worthie feaſt, committeth to the cuſtody of his truſty Cater (his great Hoſe) perhappes a two or three dayes ſtore of thoſe rare and daintie dyſhes, which I am aſhamed to write, and much more ought they to be aſhamed to do it. For that man that profeſſeth to be a man, ought to inforce himſelfe neuer to engage his libertie for that, his ſenſuall appetite inciteth him to: but only for that reaſon binds him to.
                     
                        Ariſtippus the Philoſopher waſhing lettice one day with his owne handes for his ſupper, by chance Plautus paſſing by that way, and ſeeing him ſaid, If thou wouldeſt haue ſerued king Dioniſius, wee ſhould not haue ſeene thee haue eaten Lettiſes, as thou doſt now. Ariſtippus anſwered him againe. O Plautus if thou wert content to eate of theſe Lettiſes that I eate, thou ſhouldeſt not ſerue ſo great a Tyrant as thou doſt.
                     The exceſſe of meates is greater in theſe dayes, both in quantity, and in dreſſing of them, then in times paſt, For in that golden age, which the philoſophers neuer ceaſe to bewayle, men had none other houſes but naturall caues in the ground, and apparrelled onely with the leaues of trees, the bare ground for their ſhooes, their handes ſeruing them in the ſtead of Cuppes to drinke in: they dranke Water for Wine, eate rootes for

bread, and fruites for fleſh: and finally, for their bed they made the earth, and for their couering, the skie, beeing lodged alwayes at the ſigne of the Starre.
                     When the diuine Plato returned out of Cicill into Greece, hee ſayde one day in his Colledge: I doe aduertiſe you (my Diſciples, that I am returned A worthy ſaying of the diuine Plato. out of Cicil maruellouſly troubled, and this is by reaſon of a Monſter I ſawe there. And being asked, what monſter it was, he tolde them it was Dioniſius the tyrant, who is not contented with one meale a day, but I ſaw him ſuppe many times in the night.
                     O diuine Plato, if thou wert aliue as thou art dead, and preſent with vs in this our peſtilent age, as thou werte then in that golden: how many ſhouldeſt thou ſee, that doe not onely dine and ſup well, but before dinner breake their faſt with delicate meates and wines, &amp; banket after dinner and ſupper alſo before they goe to bed. So wee may ſay, though Plato ſaw then but one Tyrant ſuppe, hee might ſee now euery body both dine and ſuppe, and ſcant one that contenteth him with one meale a day, in which the brute beaſts are more moderate, then reaſonable men. Sith we ſee that they eate but ſo much as ſatisfieth them: and are not contented to eate inough yea till they be full, but more then nature will beare. And brute beaſts haue not alſo ſuch diuerſity of meates, as men haue, neyther ſeruants to wait on them, beds to lye in, wine to drinke houſes to put their heads in, money to ſpende, nor Phyſitions to purge them as men haue. And yet for all theſe commodities, wee ſee men the moſt part of their time ſicke.
                     And by theſe things recited, we may perceyue, that there is nothing preſerueth ſo much the health of man as labour, and nothing conſumeth ſooner then reſt.
                     And therefore Plato in his time once ſpake a notable ſentence, and worthy to be had in minde, and that is this, That in that City where there are Another ſentence of Plato. many Phyſitions, it muſt needs follow of neceſſitie, that the Inhabitāts there of, are vicious, and riotous perſons. And truly we haue good cauſe to carry this ſaying away: ſith wee ſee that Phyſitions commonly enter not into poore mens houſes, that trauell and exerciſe their body dayly: but contrarily into the rich and wealthy mens houſes, which liue continually idely, and at eaſe.
                     I remember I knew once a Gentleman (a kinſman of mine, and my very friend) which hauing taken phyſicke, I came to ſee how he did, ſuppoſing hee had beene ſicke, and demaunding of him the cauſe of his purgation: he tolde mee, hee tooke it not for any ſickneſſe hee had, but onely to make him haue a better appetite againſt hee went to the feaſt, which ſhould be two or three daies after.
                     And within ſixe dayes after I returned again to ſee him, and I found him in his bedde very ſicke, not for that he had faſted too much, but that hee had inglutted him ſelfe with the variety of meates hee did eate at the feaſt.
                     So it happened, that when hee purged himſelfe once onely to haue better ſtomacke to eate, hee needed afterwards a dozen Purgations for to diſcharge his loaden ſtomacke of that great ſurfet hee had taken at the feaſt, with extreame eating: And for the foure howres hee was at the Table where this Feaſt was, hee was lodged afterwardes in his Chamber, for two monethes to pay vſury for that hee had taken, and yet it was the greate grace and mercy of GOD hee eſcaped with Life: For if that it bee ill to ſinne, It is farre worſe to ſeeke &amp; procure occaſions to ſinne.
                     
                        
And therefore by conſequent, the ſin of Gluttonie is not onely dangerous for the conſcience, hurtfull to the health of the body, and a diſpleaſing of God: but it is alſo a worm that eateth, and in fine conſumeth wholy the goods and faculties of him that vſeth it. Beſides that, theſe gurmands receiue not ſo much pleaſure in the eating of theſe dainty morſels, as they do afterwards griefe and diſpleaſure to heate the great accounts of their ſtewards, of their exceſsiue expences. It is a ſweet delight to bee fed daylie with daintie diſhes, but a ſowre ſauce to thoſe delicate mouthes, to put his hand ſo oft to the purſe. Which I ſpeake not without cauſe, ſith that as wee feele great pleaſure and felicitie in thoſe meats that enter into our ſtomackes: ſo doe we afterwards thinke that they plucke out of our heart the money that payeth for theſe knackes. I remember I ſaw written in an Inne in Catalogia theſe words:
                     
                        You that hoaſt here, muſt ſay when you ſit downe to your meate: Salue regina, Yea and when you are eating, vitae dulcedo: yea and when you reckon with the hoſte: Ad te ſuſpiramus: yea and when you come to pay him, Gementes, &amp; flentes,
                     Now if I would goe about to deſcribe by parcels the order and maner of our feaſts and banquets, newly inuented by our owne Nation, there would rather appeare matter to you, to lament and bewayle, then to write. And it had beene better by way of ſpeech to haue inuented diuers faſhiōs of tables, formes and ſtooles, to ſit on, then ſuch diuerſity of meates to ſet vpon the Tables, as wee doe vſe now a dayes. And therefore by good reaſon did Licurgus king of Lacedemonia, ordaine and command that no ſtranger 
                           
                              〈…〉
                           . comming out of a ſtrange Countrey into his, ſhould be ſo hardy to bring in any new cuſtomes, vpon paine that if it were knowne, he ſhould be ſtraite baniſhed out of the Countrey, and if he did vſe and practiſe it, he ſhould be put to death. I will tell you no lye, I ſaw once ſerued in at a feaſt 42. ſorts and kindes of meates in ſeuerall diſhes. In an other feaſt of diuers ſortes of the fiſh called Tuny. And in an other feaſt being fleſh day. I ſaw diuers fiſhes broyled with larde. And at an other feaſt where I ſaw no other meat but Troutes, and Lamperies of diuers kinds of dreſſing. And at an other feaſt where I ſaw onely vi. perſons agree together to drinke each of them three pottles of wine a peece, with this condition further, that they ſhould bee 6. houres at the table, and he that dranke not out his part, ſhould pay for the whole feaſt.
                     I ſaw alſo an other feaſt, where they prepared three ſeuerall Tables for the bidden gueſts, the one boorde ſerued after the Spaniſh manner, the other after the Italian, and the thirde ſerued after the faſhion of Flanders: And to euery table there was ſerued 22. ſorts of meates. I ſaw alſo at an other feaſt ſuch kinds of meates eaten, as are wont to bee ſeene, but not eaten, as a horſe roſted, a cat in gely, little lyſers with hote broth, frogges fryed, and diuers other ſorts of meats which I ſaw them eat, but I neuer knew what they were till they were eaten. And for Gods ſake what is he that ſhall reade our writings, and ſee that is commonly eaten in feaſtes now a dayes, that it will not in a manner breake his heart, and water his plantes.
                     The onely Spices that haue beene brought out of Calicut, and the manner of furniſhing of our boordes, brought out of Fraunce, hath deſtroied our Nation vtterly. For in the old time they had no other kinds of Spices in Spaine but Saffron, Comin, Garlicke and Onions, and when one friend inuited an other, they had but

a peece of beefe, and a peece of veale, and no more: and it was a rare and dainty matter to adde to a Henne: Oh miſhaps of worldly creatures, you embrace not now the time that was: for now if hee bee an Officer, or popular perſon of any like condition, and that hee inuite his friend or neighbor, hee will not for ſhame ſet before him leſſe then vi. or vij. ſeuerall diſhes, though hee ſell his cloke for it, or fare the worſe one whole weeke after, for that one ſupper or dinner.
                     Good Lord, it is a wonder to ſee what ſturre there is in that mans houſe that maketh a dinner or ſupper. Two or three dayes before, you ſhall ſee ſuch reſort of perſons, ſuch hurly burly, ſuch flying this way, ſuch ſending that way, ſome occupyed in telling the Cookes how many ſorts of meats they will haue, other ſend out to prouide a Cater to buy their meate, and to hier ſeruants to wayte on them, and other poore folks to looke to the dreſſing vp of the houſe, brawling and fighting with their ſeruants, commaunding their maides to looke to the Butterie, to rubbe the tables and ſtooles, and to ſee all thinges ſet in their order, as fitte as may bee, and to taſte this kinde of Wine, and that kind of wine: ſo that I would to God they would (for the health of theyr ſoules) but imploy halfe this care and paines they take in preparing one dinner, to make cleane their conſciences and to confeſſe themſelues vnto Almighty God.
                     I would faine know, after all theſe great feaſtes, what there remayneth more, then as I ſuppoſe, the Maſter of the houſe is troubled, the Stewards and Caters wearied, the poore cookes broyled in the fire, the houſe all foule, and yet that is worſt of al, ſomtimes the maſter of the feaſt commeth ſhort of a peece of plate that is ſtollen.
                     So that hee cannot chuſe but bee ſorry for the great charges hee hath beene at, beſides the loſſe of his plate and veſſell ſtollen, and the reſt of his implements of houſe marred, and in a manner ſpoyled. And peraduenture alſo the inuited not ſatisfied, nor contented, but rather will laugh him to ſcorne for his coſt, and murmur at him behind his backe.
                     
                        Marcus Tullius Cicero was once bidden to ſupper of a couetous Romane, a Citizen borne, whoſe ſupper agreede with his auarice: So the next day it chanced this couetous Citizen to meete with Cicero, and hee asked him how hee did with his Supper: very well, ſayde Cicero, for it was a good Supper, that it ſhall ſerue me yet for all this day. Meaning to let him vnderſtand by theſe words, that his Supper was ſo miſerable and hee leſt with ſuch an appetite, as hee ſhould dine the next day with a better ſtomacke at home.
                     
                        The Author continueth his purpoſe
                        
                           IT is now more then time wee doe bring you aparant proofes The Author continueth his ſpeech concerning the abuſe of feaſts. (as well by Scriptures, as prophane Authors) that there was neuer made feaſt nor banquet, but the Diuell was euer lightly a gueſt, by whoſe preſence alwayes happeneth ſome miſchiefe. The firſt banquet that euer was made in the World, was that the Diuell made to Adam and Eue, with the fruite of terreſtriall Paradiſe: after which followed a diſobeying of Gods commā
                           dement, the loſſe that Adam had of his innocency, and a ſuddaine ſhame and

perpetual reproch to our mother Eue: Mans nature preſently brought to all ſinne and vice. So that wee may well ſay, they eat the fruit, that ſet our teeth an edge.
                        Did not Rebecca likewiſe make a feaſt to her husband Iſaac, in which Eſau loſt his heritage, and Iacob ſucceeded in the ſame bleſſing Iſaacke (through fraude) whom hee tooke for Eſau, and all through the counſell of his mother Rebecca, ſhe hauing her dedeſire and purpoſe as ſhee wiſhed. Abſolon, did not hee make an other to all his brethren, after which followed the death of Aman one of his brothers &amp; by one of the other brethren their ſiſter Thamar was defamed, and their father King Dauid very ſore grieued, and afflicted, and all the realme of Iſrael ſlaundered? king Aſſuerus made an other of ſo great and fooliſh expence, that he kept open houſe for a hundred and foureſcore dayes: and it followed that Queene Vaſti was depriued of her crowne, and the fayre Heſter inueſted in her roome: Many Fearefull examples of thoſe that haue made riotous feaſts. Noble men of the City of Hull were murthered and hewen in pieces, by meanes whereof the Hebrues came into great fauour and credit, and Aman, the chiefe in authority and fauor about the Prince, depriued of all his lands, and ſhamefully executed vpon the Gallowes, and Mardocheus placed in his roome, and greatly ſublimed and exalted.
                        Alſo the 14. children of the holy man Iob (which were 7. ſonnes, and ſo many daughters) beeing all feaſted at their eldeſt brothers houſe, before they reſe from the boord, were they not all ſlaine?
                        Alſo Baltezar Sonne of King Nabuchodonozer made a banquet to al the Gentlewomen and his Concubines within the City, ſo ſumptuous and rich, that that onely veſſell hee was ſerued withall, and the cuppes they dranke in, were robbed out of the Temple of Hieruſalem by his Father: and this followed after his great banquet. The ſelfe ſame night the king with all his Concubines dyed ſuddenly, and his Realme taken from him, and put into the handes of his enemies.
                        It had beene better for all theſe I haue recited, that they had eaten alone at home, then to haue dyed ſo ſuddenly accompanied.
                        Now let all theſe gourmands and licorous mouthed people marke what I ſhall ſay to them, and carry it well in mind, and that is this: that the ſin of Gluttony is nothing elſe but a diſpleaſure, great peril, and a maruellous expence. I ſay it is a diſpleaſure: for the great care they haue continually to ſeeke out diuerſity of fine and curious meates: great perill, becauſe they plunge their bodies into many diſeaſes, and in vnmercifull charge, for the curioſity and number of diſhes So that for a litle pleaſure and delight wee take in the ſweet taſte of thoſe dainety meates, but a ſatisfaction vnto the mind for a ſhort time: wee afterwardes haue infinite griefes and troubles, with a ſower ſawce, to our no little paine.
                        And therefore Ariſtotle mockeing the Epicurians ſayde, That they vpon a time went all into the Temple together, beſeeching the Gods that they would giue them neckes as long as the Cranes and Herens, that the pleaſures and taſte of the meates ſhould bee more long, before that it came into the ſtomacke, to take the greater delight of their meate, complayning of Nature for that ſhee made their neckes ſo ſhort: affirming that the only pleaſure of meates conſiſted in the ſwallowing of it downe, which they ſayde was too ſoone. If that wee ſaw a man euen vpon a ſudden throw all his goods into

the Sea or riuer, would we not imagine he were mad or a very foole?
                        Yes vndoubtedly. Euen ſuch a one is hee that prodigally ſpendeth all his goods in feaſting and banquetting.
                        And that this is true: doe wee not ſee manifeſtly that all theſe meats that are ſerued in at Noblemens boords to day, and to morrow conueyghed into the priuie, from the Eaters by their page or ſeruant?
                        Surely mans Stomacke is nothing elſe but a gutte or Tripe, forced with meate, bread, and wine: a Pauement fild with wine Lees, and a veſſell of ſtincking-oyle, a receypt of corrrupt ayre, a ſincke of a Kitchin, and a ſecret place, whereinto we caſt all our goods and facultie, as into the riuer.
                        And therefore Eſay ſayde, that all theſe noble citties of Sodome and Gomorrha, by this onely curſe did incurre into ſuch execrable ſinnes, for which afterwards they were deſtroyed. And this was euen through exceſſe of feeding, eating, and drinking, and too much ydleneſſe: and it is no maruell. For it is an infallible thing, that where ydleneſſe and gluttony raigneth, there muſt needes come ſome yll ende vnto that man.
                        The Greekes, the Romaines, the Egiptians, and the Scythes, although they were derected of many other ſins and vices, yet were they alwayes ſober and temperat in eating and drinking.
                        
                           Iuſtine that wrote of Trogus Pompeyus reciteth, that among the Scythes (which were the rudeſt and moſt barbarous that came into Aſia) vſed to reproue thoſe that let goe winde, and to chaſtiſe and puniſh thoſe that vomited: ſaying, that breaking winde, &amp; vomiting, came only of too much eating and drinking.
                        
                           Plutarch in his Apothegmes ſayde, that there was a philoſopher in Athens called Hyppomachus: that was ſo great an enemy to gluttonie, that he vſed in his Colledge ſuch and ſo great an abſtinence, that his Diſciples by that were knowne amongſt all the other Phyloſophers. And not for no other thing, but to ſee them buye their cates and prouiſion to liue withall: for they neuer bought meates to fat them, and keepe them luſty, but onely to ſuſteine nature, and that but little.
                        The Romanes made diuers lawes in the olde time to expell out of theyr Cities drunkards and Gluttons, wherof Wholſome lawes of the Romains againſt gluttonie. we will recite ſome vnto you, to the end that thoſe that ſhall reade our preſent writings, ſhall both knowe and ſee what great care our Forefathers tooke to aboliſh this horrible vice of Gluttony.
                        Firſt, there was a Law in Rome, called Fabian Law, ſo called, becauſe Fabian the Conſull made it, in which it was prohibited, that no man ſhould bee ſo hardy in the greateſt Feaſt hee made, to ſpend aboue a hundred Sexterces, which might bee in value a hundred peeces of 6. pence, Salets, and all other kinds of fruite, not compriſed within the ſame.
                        And immediately after that, came out another law called Meſſinia, which the Conſul Meſſinius made. By which they were alſo inhibited in all feaſtes to drinke no ſtrange wines, which only were permitted to be giuen to thoſe that were diſeaſed. After which followed alſo another law Licinia made by the Conſul Licinius, forbidding in all feaſts all kinds of Sawces, becauſe they incite appetite, and are cauſe of great expence. An other law Emilia, of Emilius the Conſul alſo, commanding the Romans ſhould be ſerued in their banquets but onely with fiue ſortes of diuerſities of meates, becauſe in them there ſhould be ſufficient for honeſt re
                              •
                           ection, and no ſuperfluitie to fil the belly: And then was there the Lawe Ancia made by Ancius the Conſull, charging all the Romanes for to endeuor

to learne all kinde of ſciences, except cookery. For, according to their ſaying: In that Houſe where was a Cooke, thoſe of that houſe became poore quickely: their bodyes diſeaſed, their mindes vitious, and al-together giuen to gluttonie.
                        
                        After this law there came forth another called Iulia, of Iulius Caeſar, comcommaunding al Romains, that none ſhould be ſo hardy to ſhut their gates when they were at dinner: and it was A Law made by Iulius Caeſar. to this ende, that the Cenſours of the Cittie might haue eaſie acceſſe into their houſes at mealtime, to ſee if their Ordinary were correſpondent to their habilitie.
                        And there was alſo another Lawe made afterwards, called Ariſtimia, of Ariſtmius the Conſull, by which it was enacted, that it ſhould bee lawfull for euery man to inuire his friends to dinner to him at noon, as they liked, prouided that they ſupped not together that night.
                        And this was eſtabliſhed thus, to cut off the great charges they were at with their ſuppers. For the Romanes exceeded in ſuperfluity of dainty and fine meats, and moreouer they ſat too long guzling &amp; eating at their ſuppers
                        Of all theſe Lawes heretofore recited, were authours Aulus Gelius: and Macrobius. And for this was Caius Gracchus well reputed of, by the Romanes, who notwithſtanding hee had bin Conſull in diuers Prouinces, (and that many times) and he was a man of great grauitie and authoritie in Rome, his wife was his onely cooke: and trauelling, his hoſteſſe of his houſe where he lay dreſſed his meate.
                        
                           Marcus Mantius in times paſt, made a booke of diuers wayes how to dreſſe meat, &amp; an other of the taſts, ſawces, and diuers maners of ſeruing of them in at the bankets, &amp; a third book, how to couer the table, ſet the ſtools in order, order the cupbord: and alſo how ſeruants ſhould wayte and giue theyr attendance at the Table: which three books were no ſooner imprinted, and publiſhed, but preſently and publikely they were burned by the Senate of Rome, and if his author had not quickly voyded Rome, &amp; fled into Aſia, he had accompanyed his bookes in the fire.
                        The auncient writers neuer ceaſed to reproue enough Lentulus, Caeſar, Scylla, Scaeuola, and Aemilius: For, a banket they made in a garden of Rome, where they eate no other meates, but Blacke-byrdes, Torteyſes, Mallardes, Nettles, pigs-brains, &amp; hares in ſauce.
                        But if the Romane Writers wrote in theſe dayes, I doe not beleeue they would reproue ſo ſimple a banquet made by ſo noble and famous perſons as they were: For now a dayes they doe ſo farre exceede in variety of diſhes at noble mens boords, that neyther they haue appetite to eate, nor yet they can tell the name of the diſhes.
                        But now returning to our purpoſe, I ſay the intent why wee haue layde before you theſe forepaſſed examples, was onely to this end, to admoniſh the fauoured of Princes, to looke into themſelues, that they auoid this filthy ſinne of Gluttony. Beeing a foule blot in a Courtier, to be counted a greedy gut, and carmarant at his meate, and being one, whoſe manners and behauior euery man marketh: for ſure it is more fitting for them to bee moderate and ſober in eating and drinking then others, and good reaſon why: For as they are more Noble then others, ſo haue they many that ſue vnto them, and they haue alſo the waightieſt matters of gouernement, paſſing vnder their charge: by reaſon wherof if they ſurcharge themſelus with exceſſe, they are then very vnapt to diſpatch any matters: for much eating cauſeth ſleepe, and much drinking depriueth thē of their iudgement

and ſences both.
                        Is it not to be wondered at, yea, and to bee reproued alſo, to ſee a Magiſtrate or Counſellour ſit in his chaire, to heare poor mens cauſes and ſuites: and the ſuiter opening his cauſe vnto him, he ſitteth nodding with his head in his boſome, ready to ſleepe?
                        Euen ſo doe I ſay likewiſe, that it is a great reproach to the beloued of the Prince, and great damage to the common-wealth, that it ſhould be ſpoken amongſt Courtiers and ſuiters, that to day hee was of this opinion, and to morrow he is of another. So that the Courtyer or ſuiter ſhould haue hope to diſpatch that to morrow, hee could not doe to day.
                        King Philip, Father of Alexander the great, although he was a Prince noble and fortunate, yet was hee noted and King Philip noted of drunkennes rebuked for drinking of wine: whereof followed, that after hee had giuen iudgement vppon a time, againſt a poore widow-woman: ſhe anſwered ſtreight, ſhe appealed.
                        The Noble-men that were preſent, hearing what was ſaide by the King: asked her, to whome ſhee would appeale, ſince the King in perſon gaue ſentence of her, and no other? And this was her aunſwere ſhe made them. I appeale to King Philip which is now drunke: that when he is ſober, he returne to giue ſentence.
                        And as the Hyſtoriographers ſay, that writeth this hiſtorie: This poore woman was not deceyued, in her appellation at all: For after K. Philip had repoſed and ſlept a little, he reuoked and repealed the Sentence that he had before giuen againſt her.
                        And therefore concerning this matter, I ſay, that that how wilde or tame ſoeuer a Beaſt bee, yet he ſtill continueth a beaſt in his kinde, onely a man except, who very often through too much exceſſe of meat and drink, ſtrayeth ſo farre from reaſon, forgetting himſelfe, that neither he himſelfe, nor any other knoweth well, whether hee be then a man or a Beaſt.
                        Thoſe that are the fauoured of princes, muſt bee very circumſpect, that they be not too ſumptuous, and prodigall, in their Feaſts and Banquets, for they haue many eyes attendant on them. And ſome will ſay, That they make not thoſe great feaſts of themſelues, but by the gifts and preſents of others.
                        I wiſh them in this caſe, that they ſhould not hope to excuſe themſelues by ſaying, That they onely feaſt theyr kinſfolks &amp; familiar friēds. For the enuie that comonly one beareth againſt the power &amp; authority of a man, is ſo great and extreame, that it ſpareth not friends, remembreth not kinsfolke neyther maketh account of the benefites receyued: but rather as ſoone as the bidden gueſts are departed from his houſe that bad them, they go talking among themſelues, and murmuring amongeſt others, ſaying many times that it is more worth, that is loſt by the vaine and lauiſh expences of the fauoured Courtier, then that that is commonly ſerued to the Princes owne boorde.
                        Alſo I counſell the beloued of Princes that they take heede whome they truſt, and whom they inuite vnto their Tables: For many times if they bee but foure that are bidden, one of them goeth ſure to eate and banket, &amp; the other three to fleere and mocke, and to marke all that is brought in, &amp; the manner of the ſeruice. And the worſt is yet, that he ſhall many times bring ſuch to eate with him, that would more willingly eate his fleſh, then his meate.
                        Theſe reputed Courtiers muſt be well aduiſed, that though they be too delicate and ſuperfluous in their meat yet at leaſt that they bridle their tongs; For they may be aſſured, that as their

gueſts they bad go full paunched from them, ſo cary they away with them all the ſuperfluous and vaine wordes they heard at the table.
                        Beſides that, that what ſo euer the Courtyer ſaid at the boord, reporting it otherwhere, they will not ſay that hee ſpake it of himſelfe, but that the King himſelfe tolde it him.
                        And yet is there a farre greater danger and perill then this wee haue ſpoken of, and that is: That they will not ſimply tell that they hearde of the beloued Courtyer, but will adde vnto it of their owne heads, what they thinke beſt, and what was his meaning, in ſpeaking it.
                        So that wee may ſay, that there are not ſo many Comments vppon the Byble, (as they make Gloſſes vppon the ſame reports, by their raſh iudgemēts and fond interpretations) which they did deſcant vpon one only word ſpoken vnawares perhaps, by ſome at the Table of this fauoured Courtyer.
                        It is a generall cuſtome amongſt all eſtates and conditions of people: that where the

                           e are ſumptuous Tables, and aboundance of dyſhes, there the inuited ſit long at their meate, and are liberall to ſpeake euill. Which ſure ſuch as are in fauour with the Prince, neyther ought to doe, nor ſuffer it to be done at his boord. For the good and honorable Feaſt, ought onely to bee ſerued, with good and daintie meates: but in no wiſe marred with the defaming of his neighbour.
                        Oh how manie Feaſts and Bankets are made in Princes Courtes, where without al compariſon there are more detractions vſed of their neighbours, then there are diuerſityes of dyſhes to eate.
                        A pernitious thing doubtleſſe, and and not to bee ſuffered nor abidden: For no man hurteth the reputation of another with his tongue, but with the ſelfe-ſame hee condemneth his owne conſcience: and therefore let men be aduiſed of their ſpeach, and what they How carefull a man ought to be to bridle his tongue. ſpeake of others.
                        For it is alwayes an eaſie matter to detract and hinder the good fame and reputation of a man: but very harde afterwards to ſatisfie the partie.
                        Therefore I counſell, and admoniſh thoſe Courtyers, that they doe not oft feaſt others: but also that they do not accept to goe to others Tables where they are bidden. For, they may bee aſſured, that they are beloued of fewe, and hated of all: and beſides that, it might ſo happen, that others ſhould be at the charge of the feaſt, and that they ſhould loſe their liues.
                        Alſo let not the fauoured Courtier truſt thoſe too much that come ordinarily to his Table, and that doe rebid him againe to theirs, yea though they ſeeme euen to bee wholly his to diſpoſe, and poſſible, as it were his right hand, and that they be thoſe whō hee happily to haue done much for, in diſpatching their affayres: for lightly in ſuch like feaſts, treaſons, and poiſonings are not practiſed with the maſter of the Feaſt, but only with him that waiteth at the Table to giue drink or elſe by the Cookes that dreſſeth the meate.
                        Alſo let not the Courtier truſt too much thoſe whom hee hath beene in Company with all at diuers feaſtes, (where he neuer had hurt) much leſſe knew any little occaſion to ſuſpect ill of them, touching any treaſon meant towards him: For ſo at a time when he ſuspecteth leaſt, he may bee in moſt daunger, and finde himſelfe deceyued. And therfore by my councell, he ſhall not eaſily be entreated to euery mans boorde, vnleſſe hee bee firſt well aſſured of the companie that are bidden as alſo of the Seruants that wayte: For the holes and ſpaces of the French riddles (with which they duſt their corne) ſometimes is euen ſtopped

with the very grains of the ſame corn: and letteth the cleare paſſage of all the reſt
                        One of the greateſt troubles (or to tearme it better) one of the greateſt daungers, I ſee the fauoured Courtier in, is this: that all the Courtiers and in a manner all the Citizens, deſire to ſee them out of fauour, or dead by ſome meanes. For euery man is of this minde, that with the chaunge of things, by his fall or death hee hopeth hee ſhall riſe to ſome better ſtate, or happily to catch ſome part of his offices or liuing.
                        An other miſchiefe and inconuenience yet happeneth to this fauoured Courtier, by haunting other Tables, and that is, that many times it chanceth, vnſeemely, and vnhoneſt wordes are let fall at the Table, and perhapps quarrell ariſe vpon it, which though hee bee preſent, yet he can neyther remedy, nor appeaſe it.
                        And becauſe theſe thinges were done &amp; ſpoken in the preſence of the eſteemed of the Prince, he that ſpake them hath credit, and thoſe that heard it, deſcryed it: Yet there is an other diſorder that commeth by theſe feaſts that is, that he which maketh the feaſt and biddeth gueſtes, dooth it not for that they are of his acquaintance, his kinsfolkes, or his faithfull friends, nor for that hee is bound and beholding to them, but onely to obtaine his deſire in his ſuites that he hath in hand: for they are few that ſeeke to pleaſure men, but in hope to be greatly recompenced. Therefore thoſe that are in fauor and authority about the prince: and that accept others bidding, ſure one of theſe two things muſt happen to them: Eyther that hee muſt diſpatch his buſineſſe that inuiteth him: yea although it be vnreaſonable, &amp; ſo vniuſt, and damnable, that obtayning it, both he and the fauoured Courtier goe to the Deuill together for company, for the wrong and iniury they haue done to another: or on the other ſide refuſing to doe it, the Bidder is ſtrucken dead, and repenteth his coſt beſtowed on him.
                        Aboue all things I chiefly admoniſh the Courtiers and Officers of Princes, not to ſell, chaunge, nor engage their liberties as they doe, the ſame day they beginne to follow ſuch feaſts, or to receiue gifts or preſents, or to linke themſelues in ſtraight friendſhippe with any or to deale parcially in any cauſe: For by theſe foreſayde occaſions, they ſhall oft binde themſelues to doe that that ſhall not bee fit for them, beſides the loſſe of their liberty they had before, to doe that was moſt honeſt and commendable.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XIX. That the fauoured of Princes ought not to be diſhoneſt of their tongues, nor enuious of their words.
                     
                     
                        
                           ANaxagoras the Philoſopher diſputing one day of the cauſe why Nature had placed the members of mans body in ſuch order as they are, and of the propertie and complexion of euery one of them, and to what ende they had beene ſo orderly placed by Nature, each member in his place, falling in the end to treat of the tong, ſayde thus of it: You muſt vnderſtand 
                        Anaxagoras his opinion concerning the tongue. 
                        my good Diſciples, that not without art and great myſtery, Nature gaue vs two feete, two hands, two eares, and two eyes, and yet for all this but one tongue, whereby ſhee ſhewed vs, that in
                        
                        our going, feeling, ſmelling, hearing, and ſeeing: we may bee as long as we will: but in ſpeaking wee ſhould be as ſparing and ſcant, as could bee: Alleadging further, That Nature ſuffered vs to goe open, and bare-faced: the Eyes, the eares, the hands, the feete, and other partes of the bodie bare alſo, excepting the Tongue, which ſhee hath enuironned with jawes, and empaled with Teeth, and alſo ſhut vp with lips: which ſhee did to giue vs to vnderſtand, that ther is nothing in this preſent life that hath more neede of Guarde and defence, then hath this our vnbrydeled Tongue.
                     
                     And therefore ſayde Pythachus the phyloſopher, that a mans Tongue is made like the yron poynt of a Lance, but yet that it was more daungerous then that: For the poynt of the lance can but hurte the fleſh, but the Tongue pierceth the heart.
                     And ſurely it was a true ſaying of this philoſopher. For I know not that man how vertuous or pacient ſo euer he be, but thinks it leſſe hurt, the bloudie ſword ſhould pierce his fleſh, then that he ſhould be touched in honour, with the venemous poynt of the Serpentine-Tongue. For, how cruell ſoeuer the wound be, Time doth heale it, and maketh it wel againe: but defame or infamie, neyther late nor neuer can be amended.
                     We ſee men refuſe to goe by water for feare of drowning: not to come too neer the fire for feare of burning, nor to goe to the warres, for feare of killing: to eate no ill meates, for beeing ſicke: to climbe vp on high, for feare of falling: to goe in the darke, for feare of ſtumbling: to auoyde the yll ayre and raine, for feare of rewmes: &amp; yet I ſee very few or none, that can beware of detractors and ill tongues. And that this is true I tell you, I doe not thinke that in any thing a man is in ſuch perill and daunger, as when he liueth accompanyed with men diſhoneſt in theyr dooings, and vile, and naught in their tongues.
                     I haue alſo read touching this matter, that Aformius the phyloſopher being asked what he meant to ſpend the moſt part of his time amongſt the deſart mountaines, and in hazard, euery houre to be deuoured of wilde beaſts? Anſwered thus. Wild beaſts haue no other weapons to hurt mee, but theyr hornes and nayles, and theyr Teeth to deuoure mee, but men neuer ceaſe to hurte and offend mee, with all their whole members.
                     And that this is true, behold I pray you, how they looke at mee with their Eyes, ſpurne mee with their feete, torment mee with their hands, hate mee with their hearts, and defame me with their tongues. So that we haue great reaſon to ſay: That a man liueth with more ſecuritie amongſt wilde beaſts, then amongſt malignant and enuious people.
                     
                        Plutarch in his booke De exilio ſayth That the Lidians had a Law, that as they ſent the condemned murtherers to rowe in the Galleyes, ſo they confined thoſe that were Detractors, and euill tongued men into a ſecret place, (farre off from all company) the ſpace Plutarch reciteth a Law vſed among the Lidians. of halfe a yeare. In ſo much that many times theſe lewde mates choſe rather to rewe in the Galley three yeers then to bee exempt from company, and ſpeaking with any but ſixe monethes.
                     Much like vnto this Law did Tiberius the Emperour make another, and condemned a great talker and railer of his tongue, and commaunded ſtraightly that he ſhould neuer ſpeake word the ſpace of a whole yeare. And as the hiſtoric ſayth, hee remayned dumbe, and neuer ſpake during the whole terme, but yet that hee did (with his dumbneſſe) more hurt with nods and ſignes with his fingers, then many other would haue done with

their ill tongues.
                     By theſe two examples wee may ſee, that ſith theſe naughty tongues are not to be repreſſed by ſilence, in ſecret, nor to entreate them as friends nor by doing them good, nor by ſending them to Galleyes: nor to make them holde their peace, and to be as dumbe men: By mine aduiſe I would haue them baniſhed (by general counſell) out of all Colledges counſels, chapters, townes and Commonwealthes: For wee ſee dayly by experience, that let an apple haue neuer ſo little a bruiſe, that bruiſe is inough to rotte him quickly, if hee be not eaten in time.
                     
                        Demoſthenes the Philoſopher was of great authority for his perſon, graue in manners, and condition, and very ſententious, &amp; profound in his words: but with theſe he was ſo obſtinate, &amp; wilfull, and ſuch a talker in all his matters, that all Greece quaked for feare of him.
                     Whereupon all the Athenians one day aſſembled in their hall, or common houſe, and there they appointed him a great ſtipend of the goods of the Common wealth, telling him that they gaue him this, not that he ſhould reade, but becauſe hee ſhould holde his peace. Alſo this great and renowmed Cicero that was ſo valiant and politicke in martiall affayres, ſo great a friend to the Common weale of Rome and moreouer a Prince of Eloquence, for the Latine tongue, though he was cruelly put to death by Marke Antony, it was not for any fact committed againſt him, neyther for any wrong or iniurie hee had done him, ſaue onely for that hee enuyed againſt him, and ſpake euill of him.
                     Alſo the Noble and famous Poet Saluſt, and famous Orator of Rome, was not hated of ſtrangers, and not beloued of his owne neighbours, for no other cauſe, but for that hee neuer tooke penne in hand to write, but hee euer wrote againſt the one, and neuer opened his mouth to ſpeake, but hee alwayes ſpake euill of the other.
                     
                        Plutarch touching this matter reciteth in his bookes De Republica, that amongſt them of Lidia, in their publike weale, it was holden an inuiolable What puniſhment by a Law of the Lidians, was due to him that would defame his neighbour. Law, that they ſhould not put a murderer to death for killing of any, but that they ſhould onely execute, and put him to tortur, that would defame his neighbour, or in any one Worde ſeeme to touch him in honour and eſtimation.
                     So that thoſe barbarous Nations thought it more execrable to defame a man, then to kill and murther him: And therefore I ſay, hee that burneth my houſe, beates my perſon, and robbeth me of my goods, muſt needes doe me great dammage: but he that taketh vpon him to touch my honour and reputation with infamy, I will ſay, hee offendeth mee much, and that ſo greatlie, as he may well ſtand in feare of his life: For there is not ſo little an offence done to a man of ſtoute courage, but hee carrieth it euer after imprinted in his heart, till hee haue reuenged the villany done him: euen ſo in Princes Courts, there riſe more quarrels, and debates through euill tongues and diſhoneſt reports, then there dooth for any play or ſhrewde turnes that are done.
                     I know not what reaſon they haue to ſtrike off his hand that firſt draweth ſword, and fauoureth and leaueth him vnpuniſhed, that draweth bloud with his il tongue.
                     O what a happy good turne were it for the Common weale, if (as they haue in all Townes and well gouerned policies, penall lawes, prohibiting for to weare or carry weapon) they had like lawes alſo to punniſh detractiue, and wicked tongues: Surely, there can not be ſo great a blotte or vice in a

Noble man, Knight or Gentleman of honeſt behauiour and countenance, as to bee counted and reputed a tatler of his tongue, and therewithall a detractor of others. But let not ſuch deceiue themſelues, thinking that for their countenance or eſtates ſake they bee priuiledged aboue others, at their wills and pleaſure to enlarge their tongues on whom they liſt in ſuch maner, but that their inferiours farre, will as liberally ſpeake of them, yea, &amp; as much to their reproach, as they before had done of them: repenting as much of their honeſty and credite for their calling (beeing in equiualent in eſtate or degree to them) as they doe of their dignity and reputation.
                     At that time when I was a Courtier, and liued in Princes Court, there dyed out of the Court a worthy knight, who at his noble funerals was commended of vs al, to be a good and deuout Chriſtian, and chiefly aboue all his noble and heroicall vertues, hee was onely lauded and renowmed, for that they neuer heard him ſpeake ill of any man.
                     So one of the company that was preſent, hearing this great prayſe of him, tooke vpon him to ſay this of him: If hee neuer ſpake ill of any, then did hee neuer know what pleaſur thoſe haue that ſpeake ill of their enemies. Which words when we heard though wee paſſed them ouer with ſilence, yet was there none but was greatly offended at them, and good cauſe why: For to ſay truly, the firſt degree of malignity is, for a man to take a felicity in ſpeaking ill of his neighbour.
                     King Darius being at dinner one day, there were put foorth of the Waighters and Standers by, certain Arguments of the Acts and doings of Alexander the Great: in which liſpute, one Mignus a Captaine of the King, and greatly in fauour with him, was very earneſt againſt Alexander, and went too farre in ſpeech of him. But Darius perceiuing him thus paſſioned, ſayde to him: O Mignus, 
                        A ſpeech of King Darius. holde thy tongue, for I doe not bring thee into the warres with mee, that thou ſhouldeſt infame Alexander (and touch his honour with thy tongue, but that thou ſhouldſt with thy ſword ouercome him.
                     By theſe examples wee may gather, how much wee ought to hate detraction and ill ſpeaking, ſince we ſee that the very enemies themſelues cannot abide to heare their enemies euill ſpoken off in their preſence: and this is alwayes obſerued of the honourable, graue, and wiſe men that are of noble mindes: For ſure each noble heart diſdaineth to bee reuenged of his enemy with his tongue, for his iniuries done him: if hee cannot be reuenged on him with his ſword.
                     It is fitting for all in generall to be modeſt and honeſt in their ſpeech, but much more it is due for him that embraceth the fauour and credite of his Prince: For it is his profeſſion to doe good, to helpe euery man, and to ſpeake ill of no man.
                     They haue ſuch Centinels of ſpies vpon them continually (which are officers in Court and about the Prince) to marke what they ſpeake and do, that treading once awry (how little ſoeuer it bee) it is ſtraight blowne into the Princes eares, and they perhaps accuſed of that which they neuer thoght delighting, and taking great pleaſure to tell openly what they heard them ſay.
                     Such therefore as are dayly Courtiers, attending vppon the What behauiour belongeth to a Courtier. Prince, and in fauour with him, muſt (if they meane to continue that fauour and credite) be gentle, and courteous in their Wordes, and bountifull to thoſe that ſtand in need of them.
                     
                        
Alſo the eſteemed Courtyer muſt beware hee doe not ſpeake yll of no man, but alſo that he be not too great a talker. For commonly theſe great talkers beſides that they are not eſteemed, bee alſo reputed of ſmall iudgement and of ſimple counſell.
                     
                        Pythyas', that was the great Gouerner, and Duke of the Athentan nation, was a Noble prince, beloued and feared, hardy, and valiaunt, and yet in the ende as ſaith Plutarch, the aboundance of wordes, obſcured the glorie of his heroicall deedes.
                     Although oft times theſe great talkers, and men too full of words bee of Noble byrth' or worſhip, wealthie in poſſeſſions, and otherwiſe of authoritie and eſtimation: yet neuertheleſſe, all that time they ſpende in ſpeaking too much, others that heare them, occupie the ſame in deryding and ſcorning of them.
                     I beſeech you conſider, what greater reproach could a Courtyer haue, then to be counted a babbler, a prater of his tongue, and a lyer? For when hee thinks euery man is attentiue, and liſtening to him, it is quite contrarie: for euen at that inſtant do they laugh him to ſcorne: and yet this is nothing to the ſhame they doe vnto him afterwards.
                     For thoſe that talke to him, whilſt he is thus babbling, pots at him with their mouthes, behind his backe, nods with their heads, holdes downe theyr Eyes, and ſoothes him in all that hee ſayes, and all this not to praiſe or commend him, but to be merry afterwards at the matter, when they are together. And it is a ſport to note, and heare of one of theſe great Talkers, if any man talke of warre, of the liberall ſciences, of hunting, or of husbandrie, hee will ſtreight leape into the matter althogh he be vtterly ignorant in the thing proponed, taking vppon him to reaſon of the matter, as if hee were very skilfull, or maſter of that faculty. And to make the hearers belieue, that that is true he ſaith, hee bringeth in an example: ſaying that he hath ſeene it, read it, or heard it, and all perhaps a ſtarke Lye, that hee neyther ſawe it, reade it, nor heard it of any: but onely deuiſed of his owne head, on a ſudden, vnder the colour of Truth, to forge and make a falſe Lye.
                     
                        Acaticus the Phyloſopher, beeing one day at a Feaſt, where hee neyther ſpake nor offered once to ſpeake: being asked after Dinner, what was the occaſion of his ſilence, anſwered them thus: It is better for a man to know his A wiſe ſaying of Acaticus the Philoſopher time to ſpeake, then it is to knowe to ſpeake. For to ſpeake well, is giuen vs by Nature: but to chuſe fit time to ſpeake, proceedeth of wiſdome.
                     
                        Epimenides the painter, after hee had dwelt long time in Aſia, returned to Rhodes, from whence hee firſt departed, and becauſe none of the Rhodians euer hearde him ſpeake any thing, eyther of that hee had ſeene, or done in Aſia, they maruelled very much, and earneſtly prayed him to diſcourſe vnto them ſome part of that he had ſeen, and ſuffered in Aſia. To whome hee made this aunſwere.
                     Two yeares I ſulked the Seas, abyding the perills of the water, and ten other yeares I was reſident in Aſia, to learn the perfection of a paynters art: ſixe other yeares I ſtudyed in Greece, to accuſtome my ſelfe to be ſilent, and nowe you would I ſhould feede you, with tales and newes.
                     O Rhodians, come to mee no more with any ſuch motion: for you ſhould come to my houſe to buy pictures, and not to heare newes. Albeit in ſo many yeares, and in ſuch farre and ſtrange Countries it could not be but Epimenides had ſeene many things worthy to bee recounted, and alſo very pleaſant for to heare: yet hee would neuer tell them, nor ſhew thē:

and ſure herein he did like a good philoſopher, and anſwered like a wiſe &amp; graue perſon: For in telling of ſtrange things, and of diuers countries, there are few that will beleeue them, and many that will ſtand in doubt whether they be true or not.
                     And therefore touching this matter alſo, Pythagoras the Philoſopher was one day asked vpon what occaſion he made his Scholers vſe ſo great ſilence in his Colledge, that in two yeares after they were entered, they might not ſpeake. He anſwered thus: In other Philoſophers Schooles they teach their Diſciples to ſpeake, but in mine there is taught nothing but to holde their peace. For in the whole World there is no better nor higher A ſpeech of Pythagoras philoſophy then to know to bridle the tongue.
                     It is a maruellous thing to ſee a mā that with time his beard and haires of his head become all white, his face withered, his eares deafe, his legs ſwoln his breath ſtinke, his ſpleene ſtopte, and his body faint and feeble with age, and all the parts thereof conſumed ſaue onely the heart and tongue, which we neuer ſee waxe olde in manner, how aged or impotent ſoeuer he bee, but rather dayly become greene: and that is worſt of all is, that what euill the wretched hart thinketh in that crooked and miſerable age, that doth that accurſed tongue with all celerity vtter.
                     There is a Companie of Courtiers in the Court that preſume to bee eloquent, and well ſpoken, and of Courtly entertainement, which when they will talke of ſome pleaſant matter, they muſt firſt tell you a lye, and ſurely theſe kind of Courtiers wee may better call them detractors of others, then ciuill entertainers.
                     Accurſed bee hee that to the preiudice of his neighbour maketh profeſſion to bee a Courtly entertainener, and you ſhall hardly ſee none of theſe recited Courtiers ieſt of any but they haue in ſecret Spunne the thread to weaue a great cloth of malice. And yet wee doe theſe men great honour and reuerence, not for any good will we beare them, but for that wee are afraid of their ill tongues, and althogh to diſſemble other while, it is a graue and wiſe mans part, yet for all that wee may not iudge ill of them, ſince wee ſee the beſt mans honour and credite commonly to be no greater nor leſſe: then a malignant perſon ſhal ſeeme to vſe his tongue to ſpeake of him. I remember there was in the Court in my time a noble man, noble of birth and perſon both, whome I reproued diuers times (as his familiar friend) of his prodigall liuing and ill ſpeaking: And he made me this anſwere.
                     Truely ſir, thoſe that report that I ſpeake ill of them, it is themſelues that do it of me: and if I follow them therein, it is for nothing elſe, but to bee a witneſſe for them, if any ſeeke to impugne their ſaying: but ſure of my ſelfe I neuer vttered, or deuiſed word, that might bee to the preiudice of any. O what euill cauſeth hee, that ſpeaketh ill of another, he onely offendeth not that beginneth, but hee that aſſiſteth him, and much more he that heareth him, and after publiſheth it but aboue all, hee that telleth it abroade, and addeth more then hee heard.
                     The Fauoured of Princes muſt alſo thinke, that though they are prohibited to ſpeake much, yet it is moſt The Courtyer ought to be a t
                              •
                           ue Secretarie. fitte and decent for them to bee true and faithfull Secretaries: For there is no thing that the Prince priſeth more, then the ſecret breaſt of his fauoured Courtier. And therefore I ſay not without cauſe that they ought to bee ſecret, but moſt ſecret: For the eſteemed Courtier muſt haue a better conſideration of his princes ſecrets

committed vnto him, then of the benefites receyued of him.
                     Sure it is no ſmall, but a great and moſt neceſſary vertue in a man to bee cloſe and of fewe words, and ſo ſecret in deede, that he make no more countenance of that was tolde him priuily, then if he had neuer heard it ſpokē of.
                     I know an other kinde of people ſo proane to ſpeake yll, that they cannot keepe ſecret theyr owne faultes, much leſſe others faults, publiſhing them in euery corner.
                     
                        Cecilius Metellus beeing asked one day of a Centurion, what he meant to doe the next day following? aunſwered thus.
                     Thinke not Centurion that thoſe things I am determined to doe, my hands ſhall ſo lightly diſcouer: for I am of this minde, if I knewe that my ſhyrt had any knowledge of that I will doe tomorrow, I would put it off, and throw it ſtraight into the fire, &amp; ſee it burned before my face.
                     It is not alike truſt, to put money into one mans handes of truſt, and to commit ſecretes to the breaſt of another: and this to be true we ſee it plainly, that the prince deliuereth his goods and treaſure to the cuſtodie of manie, but his ſecrets hee committeth onely to one.
                     The fauoured of Princes ought to be ſo ſecrete, that whatſoeuer they ſee the Prince doe or ſay (be it in the preſence of diuers, and that they are tolde of it by many:) Yet they ought not to be acknowne of it. For, indeede the Prince ſpeaketh many things cōmonly for his pleaſure, which being reported againe of the Fauoured Courtyer, wil be thought true, and moſt certain.
                     Therefore ſpeaking generally of this matter, I ſay, that ſurely Friendes are greatly bound to keepe the ſecretes of their friends: For that day I diſcouer my intent to any, the ſelfe-ſame I make him lord of my libertie. Therefore let that man thinke he hath wonne a maruellous treaſure, that hath a ſecrete friend. For without doubt it is no ſuch matter of importance, to keepe treaſure ſafely locked vp in a cheſt, as it is to commit and truſt ſecretes vnto the heart of another.
                     
                        Plutarche writeth that the Athenians hauing warres with King Philip of Macedonie, becauſe there came certain leters of K: Philips to their hands (intercepted by their ſcowtes) directed and ſent vnto his wife Olimpia: which they no ſooner vnderſtoode, but they preſently returned again ſafely ſealed, and vntouched of them, as they came firſt vnto them, ſaying: That ſith by theyr law they were bound to be ſecret, they wold not reueale the ſecrets of others, notwithſtanding they were their mortall enemies, as K: Philip was to them: and therefore they would neyther ſee them, nor read them openly.
                     
                        Diodorus Siculus ſayth alſo, that among the Egyptians it was a criminal act for any man to bewray the ſecrets of another: which was proued true by the example of a Prieſt, that in the Temple of the Goddeſſe Iſis had defloured a virgine, and they both truſting to the fidelitie of another Prieſt, making their loue knowne vnto him: euen as they were in Venus ſweete delights, hee not regarding any longer their ſecrets, in ipſo facto exclaimed and cryed out, and thereupon conuict and apprehended by the Iuſtice, theſe poore Louers were miſerably executed, and this ſpightful and vnfortunate Prieſt condignely baniſhed.
                     And this baniſhed Prieſt complaining of the vniuſt ſentence, ſaying, that which he reuealed was in fauour of the Religion, and for the behooſe of the Common wealth: the Iudge aunſwered him thus: If thou haddeſt knowne their offence of thy ſelfe, without their notice giuen thee, thou haddeſt had reaſon to haue complained of our ſentence,

but ſince they truſted thee with their doings, and thou gaueſt them thy word and promiſe to be ſecret, if thou hadſt called to minde the bonde thou werte bound to them in, and that thy ſelfe did freely without their compulſion ſubmit thy ſelfe vnto, thou wouldeſt not once dared to haue publiſhed the fact as thou haſt done.
                     
                        Plutarch in his booke de exilio ſayeth, that a man of Athens once demaunded an Egyptian (Diſciple of a Philoſopher) what hee had vnder his cloke, aunſwered him thus: Truely thou haſt ſtudyed little, and borne away leſſe, although thou art an Athenian borne, ſith thou ſeeſt that I carry ſecretly that thou demaundeſt, becauſe thou nor none other ſhoulde know it, and yet thou askeſt it of my ſelfe, what it is that I carry.
                     
                        Anaſillus that was a Captaine of the Athenians, was taken of the Lacedemonians, and put to the torture, becauſe he ſhould tell that hee knew: and what the King Ageſilaus his Lord and Maſter did, to whome hee gaue this anſwere. You Lacedemonians haue liberty to diſmember me, and to hewe mee in pieces: but ſo haue not I to reueale my Lord and Maſters ſecrets: A worthy anſwere of Anaſillus. For in Athens wee vſe rather to dye, then to bewray the ſecrets of our friend.
                     King Liſimachus entreated the Philoſopher Philipides very earneſtly, that he would come and dwell with him: but hee made them this anſwere: I would bee very glad to bee in your company, knowing you to bee a fauourer of Philoſophy: and if you will goe to the warres, I will follow you: and if you truſt mee with your goods, I will keepe them carefully and faithfully, if you haue children, I wil teach them with all my heart: if you will vſe my counſell in your affaires, I will giue you the beſt I can: And if you will alſo giue mee the charge of your common wealth, I will gouerne it with my beſt diſcretion.
                     Onely one thing I will requeſt you that you will neuer commaund mee: that is, not to make mee pertaker of your ſecrets. For it might happen that what you had tolde me in ſecret, your ſelfe vnawares at a time might tell it openly, and yet not thinke of it: and beeing afterwards tolde you by ſome other, you would preſently enter into ſuſpect that it came to knowledge by me. This Phyloſopher would firſt indent with the Prince (before hee would come to his ſeruice) that hee ſhould neuer heare any of theſe things the knowledge whereof bringeth many a man to their end, or at the leaſt to ſome great miſchiefe: onely to ſhew vs the eminent perill and daunger the Secretary of a prince ſtandeth in. For our heart is ſuch a friende of newes, that euery hower it feeleth a thouſand temptations to vtter that to others, that was deliuered to vs of ſecret.
                     In this our age we do not vſe for to keepe ſecrets, ſo well as in olde time the Grecians were wont, ſith wee ſee by experience, that if one friend haue to day told his friend a thing in ſecret, tomorrow, yea perhaps the ſelfe ſame night before, it was tolde among the neighbours.
                     There are alſo ſome kinde of men ſo deſirous to heare newes, that for to know it, they will ſweare a thouſande othes neuer to reueale it againe to any. But ſo ſoone as they know it, they are like vnto the bloud-hounds that follow the Deare, now here, now there ſmelling with their noſes, till they haue found the hurt Deare, then they open and baye for their Maſter.
                     Therefore I counſell and exhortal wiſe and diſcreet men, that they doe not accōpany with thoſe whom they know are not ſecret: for the hurt that

commeth by them, conſiſteth not only to tel that they know, ſee, and heare: but with this they tell that they haue imagined of their owne wicked, and malicious heads. It cannot be otherwiſe, but beeing men, wee are alſo ſubiect to the frailtie of a man: As for example;
                     To fall into the ſinne of the Fleſh, and in that to forget the ſinne of gluttonie, and to haue ſmall conſideration of that of ſlouth, to be aſſured of that of Auarice, or with that to bee ouercome with paſſion and rage, or to bee puffed vp in the ſinne of Pride. And if perhappes by misfortune, any one chance into ſuch mens company, that hath but parte, or all theſe conditions, and ſuch one as doe diſcouer and diſcloſe both his own ſecrets and others too, what other can there be hoped of, then a fire enflamed in his good fame and reputation, and a contagtous plague and peſtilence in his houſe?
                     For that that I haue heard, ſeen, and read, yea and alſo proued: I ſay and affirme, that there is no bread ſo ill ſpent, as that that is giuen to the Seruaunts which open and reueale their Maiſters ſecrets.
                     And ſure it may be ſaide, that ſuch are not Seruaunts that ſerue them, but Traytours that betray them, and fell their Maiſters libertie. And it is of ſuch importance, for the Fauoured of Princes, to keepe ſecret, and not to reueale any parte of the Princes ſecrets, that euery man muſt thinke, that when the Prince telleth them any thing in ſecret, he telleth it not alone to them, but rather he confeſſeth it vnto them.
                     Princes being men (as indeed they are) and much buſied, with the cares of the Common-wealth, it cannot bee, but when they are withdrawne a part into their priuy chamber, they wil both play, talke, ſleyt, ſigh, laugh, be angry, threaten, and make much againe of ſome before others.
                     All which things though they doe before their ſeruants in ſecret, it is not their pleaſure, neyther will they like it ſhould be told abroad amongſt theyr Subiects.
                     And ſure they haue great reaſon: for men of grauity and authority, doe not loſe their reputation for doing of No ſeruāt ſo hurfull as hee that reuealeth his maiſters ſecrets. things graue, and of good example: but they are iuſtly noted, when publikely they will ſhew any lightneſſe or folly, how lightly ſoeuer it be. Not only thoſe that be in authority and fauor about the Prince, but ſuch other officers of the Court and Seruants of houſhold of the prince alſo, ought not to tell or reueale any thing they ſee their Prince do: For they may be well aſſured, that the prince will be more offended and diſpleaſed to haue that he doth in his priuie Chamber tolde abroad by thoſe of the priuy Chamber, or other whom it pleaſeth him to make familiar with him, then he would be, if his treſurers and receiuers ſhould rob him of his treaſure. It was tolde to Denys the Sir acuſan on a time that Plato the Philoſopher was at the chamber dore to ſpeake with him, and hee preſently ſent Bias of his priuy Chamber (that hee loued well) to him to know what hee would with the King: The ſentence of Denis vpō Byas, a Courtyre. and Plato a
                           •
                        ked Bias what Denys did: and hee anſwered that hee laye ſtarke naked vpon a Table, which when Denys vnderſtoode, he was ſo offended with Bias, that he commanded forthwith hee ſhould bee beheaded, ſaying firſt theſe words vnto him. I will that like a traytor thou be beheaded, ſithence thou haſt trayterouſly betrayed mee, preſuming to diſcloſe the ſecretes of my Chamber. For I ſent thee not to Plato to tell him what I did, but for to know what hee would of mee. Now Princes familiars and Beloued of them, as they muſt bee very circumſpect and heedefull that they tell no man the

Princes ſecretes: ſo they muſt bee much careful that they tell it not chiefly to women, yea though they were their owne wiues: For as women are very good and profitable, to looke to Courtiers ought to keepe their ſecrets from women. things of houſholde, and ſafely for to locke vp their husbands goods: So are they on the other ſide very daungerous for man to commit any ſecrets to them: For notwithſtanding a woman know, that in reueling the ſecrets of her husband, ſhe putteth her life in perill, the honour of her husband, the loſſe of her children, the reputation of her houſe and kindred, and peraduenture the peace and tranquility of the Common weale: yet had ſhee rather dye, then ſhee ſhould not vtter that ſhee knoweth.
                     And many times for no other reſpect, but to make theſe women beleeue that heareth her, that ſhe onely commaundeth her husband, and all beſides in her houſe. Well, I will enlarge my ſelfe no further of this matter, for if I would but giue my penne leaue to write that I know, I ſhoulde finde lime and ſand enough to builde a Tower as high as Babylon.
                     
                     But to end my purpoſe, I will ſpeake this one word, and that is, That I coū
                        ſell and exhort, and with all my heart requeſt Princes Familiars or Seruants, that they commit not their Princes ſecrets to any, how great a friend, or neere kinsman ſoeuer he be to them: For they may bee aſſured, that ſince they refuſe to keepe ſecrete that the Prince commandeth them, that much leſſe their friend will keepe it ſecret for any requeſt they make to him. If thou cannot keepe the ſecret, that to open it, importeth the loſſe of thy fauour &amp; credite, and happily thy life alſo: how canſt thou thinke an other will doe it, that in telling it, winneth both honor and credit.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XX. A commendation of Truth, which profeſſed Courtiers ought to embrace, and in no reſpect to be found defectiue in the contrary, telling one thing for an other.
                     
                     
                        
                           EPimenides the Philoſopher being requeſted of the Rhodians to tell them, what the vertue was they caled verity, he anſwered them thus: Verity my friends, is a thing which the Gods aboue al other profeſſe, and her vertue is ſuch, that it warmeth the heauens, lighteth the earth, maintains iuſtice, and gouerneth the Commonwealth, and ſuffereth no euill thing in her, making plain and cleare all doubtfull and hidden things.
                     The Corinthians asked the like queſtion alſo of Chilo the Philoſopher what verity was; who aunſwered, that it was a perdurable pillar, neuer diminiſhing, nor decreaſing: a buckler or ſhield impaſſable, a fayre time that is neuer troubled, an army that neuer periſheth, a flower that neuer withereth, a Sea that neuer feareth fortune and a ſure hauen where neuer was ſhip wracke.
                     
                        Anaxarchus the Philoſopher, was alſo demaunded of the Lacedemonians what verity was, who aunſwered that it was a health without ſickneſſe, a life without end, a iuleppe and ſirrop that healeth all, a Sunne that neuer darkneth, a Moone without Eclipſe, an herbe that neuer dryeth, a gate that is neuer ſhut, and a way that neuer wearieth man.
                     
                        
The like was asked of Eſchines the phyloſopher touching veritie, by the Rhodians: And he ſaide, that it was a vertue, without which all force was weakned, Iuſtice corrupted, humilitie fained and diſſembled, patience inſupportable, chaſtitie vaine, libertie loſte, and pitie ſuperflous.
                     The like was demanded of Pharmacus the phyloſopher by the Romans. And his aunſwer was, that veritie was a true Center, wherein all things repoſed, a carde to ſaile by, to direct the pilote and mariners, a wiſdome to heale and recure euery man, and a preſent remedie for all euills: a height, in the top whereof euery man reſteth, and a bright light, to enlighten the whole world. And ſurely this maketh mee thinke that theſe Phyloſopehrs were great Friendes and Louers of veritie, ſince that they did ſo much enrich and ſublime the ſame, with ſo many rare and excellent titles.
                     But now omitting theſe Phyloſophers, who haue truly ſpoken that they knew: let vs come ſpeake of him that aboue all the World hath exalted veritie: which was the diuine WORD: and that was IESVS CHRIST, the onely begotten Sonne of GOD: and true glaſſe of Eternitie: who being asked the ſelfe-ſame thing of Pylate, ſaid not to him, I am wiſedome, neyther iuſtice, nor chaſtitie, nor patience, humanitie, not charitie: But onely ſaide vnto him, I am veritie. To let vs vnderſtand, that euery creature might bee partaker of that veritie. But our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was not partaker of that veritie, but the ſole and onely poſſeſſor of the ſame, hee beeing the very Trueth it ſelfe.
                     Oh of how manie is this vertue deſired? and of how few (yea, moſt fewe) obſerued. For, in effect it is nothing elſe but a marke, whereat all good men ſhoote with their Eyes, and all yll and wicked perſones looſe their ſight.
                     The Emperour Auguſtus in the Triumph hee made of Marke Anthony, &amp; his loue Cleopatra, amongſt others brought to Rome an Egyptian Prieſt, of 60. yeares of age, and the Senate being informed of a ſurety, that dayes of his life he neuer tolde lye, they agreede not onely to reſtore him to liberty, but to make him high Prieſt of their Temple, and to erect a Statue of him, among the noble and princely perſons of Rome.
                     
                        Spartianus writeth, that in the time of Clandian Emperour of Rome, there deceaſed a Citizen of Rome called Pamphylus reported neuer to haue tolde a true tale. 
                        Pamphilus, whoſe doings after his death examined, it was manifeſtly proued, that hee neuer ſpake one true Word all his life time, but alwayes lied in that he ſayde.
                     Which related vnto the Emperour, hee commanded his body ſhould not be buried, his goods ſhould be confiſcate, and his houſe raized to the foundation, and his wife and children for euer baniſhed Rome, and all her Territories, to the end there ſhould remayne no memory to the Commonwealth, of ſo peſteferous and venemous a beaſt.
                     At that time when theſe 2 thinges thus happened, the Romanes and Egyptians were mortall enemies, and therefore by theſe examples wee may ſee, of what force and power this vertue of verity is, ſith the Romans made a ſtatue to their enemy, only for that he was a true and iuſt man: and depriued of Sepulture their natiue childe, and a Romane borne, for that he was a lyer.
                     A true man may goe in any place where hee liſteth, freely without interruption, accompanied with all men, not fearing to be accuſed of any, and may with ſafety reproue the vitious, and ill perſons: And finally, to conclude, he may without the feare of any

ſpeake in the face of the world, &amp; ſhew his face among the beſt.
                     If a man will chuſe a friend, he need not bee inquiſitiue if he bee wiſe, iuſt, chaſte, carefull, couragious, or noble, but onely if hee be true of his worde. And if that be ſo, it followeth that all vertues and honeſty muſt abounde in him.
                     
                        Helius Spartianus reciteth of the life of Traian the Emperour that beeing one night at Supper, and accompanied with noble men at his boorde: they argued of the fidelity of friendes, and infidelity of enemies, whom Traian aunſwered. That hee neuer had friend in his life but he was good, true, honeſt, and faithfull; whereupon his Lordes beſought him, that it woulde pleaſe him to tell them the occaſion of his good hap in this, And he aunſwered thus:
                     The cauſe why I haue euer beene ſo fortunate herein was this, I neuer would chuſe to my friend a lyer and A worthy ſpeech of the Emperour 
                              〈◊〉
                            in concerning lyers. couetous man: For in him that raigneth auarice, and lying, there can neuer dwell perfect friendſhip.
                     Thoſe that are honeſt, and like ſo to be reputed, muſt endeauor them ſelues to ſpeake well alwayes, and euer to ſay, that that is true: and if they will not doe this for conſcience ſake, yet let them doe it for to auoide the ſhame that followeth them.
                     For there can bee no greater mockerie or deſpight done to a man, then openly to make him know hee hath lyed.
                     Wee ſee the childe when hee perceyueth hee hath tolde a lye, he bluſheth ſtraight, and is aſhamed: much more ought men growne in yeares, whoſe face is couered with hayres, not onely bluſh, but ſhame to tell a lye.
                     Many times I thinke what a great griefe the Marchant ſuffereth euerie houre not to bee counted a Lyer, whē he vttereth his ware, and ſure he dooth it but becauſe hee would not loſe his credite.
                     And lo here why they ſweare commonly by the faith of a Marchant to bee more aſſured, when to the contrary we ſee many other, that in apparance ſeeme to bee honeſt and graue men, that vſe not the manner, but rather they will ſticke no mere to tell you a lye, then to loſe a wheat grain:
                     But here I ſpeake nor, neyther doe meane to touch thoſe that are indeed vertuous and good men: but I ſpeake of thoſe that thinke themſelues honeſt and yet be not, God knoweth. And therefore wee may be aſſertained, that a marchant eſteemeth more his goods and marchandize, then a lyer doth his honour, otherwiſe honeſty.
                     There is nothing that preiudiceth truth ſo much, as a tatling tongue that neuer lyeth: being in a manner impoſſible, that amongſt many wordes, ſome lye he not interlaced. All things conſiſt not in other more or leſſe, ſaue onely in the vſe that men haue of it: for if a man doe vſe to eate little, hee alwayes goeth from the Table: if wee vſe to ſleepe little, wee alſo leaue our bedde. And if we accuſtome our ſelus alſo to lye, we ſhall haue it ſuch a continuall vſe, as though wee would, wee ſhall neuer leaue it after: For there are diuers ſorts of men, that as they accuſtome themſelues to eate and drinke oft times in a day, ſo doe they vſe to lye euery houre.
                     But I aske what is the greateſt and moſt perfect thing in this life, that a man whileſt he liueth may enioy. I dare boldly ſay, that it is neyther nobility, great parentage, nor fauour, neyther the great eſtate, health, nor riches: but rather that it is the ſole honour, which tatlers and lyers may neuer enioy, becauſe they are neuer credited nor beleeued in their wordes: What fame, credite, honour, reputation, or good can hee haue, out of

whoſe mouth there cōmeth nothing but lyes?
                     A lyer deſerueth credite of no man, neyther that any man ſhould deale with him in any thing, much leſſe to commit any matter of truſt into his hands, no nor loue him, nor accept of him, but rather as a detractor, and defamer of mens good name, wee How hatefull and odious a Lyer ought to be eſteemed among men. ſhould baniſh him our company.
                     
                        Hanibal that was the mighty Prince of the Carthagenians, ſo valiant in warlike proweſſe, ſo hardy to follow it, and therewithall ſo fortunate to ouercome his enemies, was yet notwithſtanding, blamed of Titus Liuius, and reputed for a malignant &amp; periured perſon: For hee neuer gaue that hee promiſed to his friends, neyther euer kept any couenant or agreement made with his enemies. Such was not Gneus Pompeius (ſonne to Pompey the great) with whom Octauian, and Marke Antony (both his mortall enemies) beeing at ſupper with him on the ſea, Menodorus the Captaine of his Armie ſent him word, if it were his pleaſure, he would ſo liuely haue hoiſt vp the ſayles of the ſhip, that he would ſoone haue periſhed them, or ſunked the ſhippe they were in. To which meſſage Pompey gaue this anſwer.
                     
                        Thou ſhalt tell Menodorus my Captaine, that if I were Menodorus as hee is, that neuer knew what truth meant, I would haue followed his aduiſe, and haue done that hee ſendeth to mee for: but if hee were Pompeius as I am, which keeps my word and promiſes with all men, ſuch a thought and treaſon would neuer haue occupied his head.

                        Herodotus writeth alſo, that when the Egyptians would make any new amitie betwixt themſelues, or bee in league, and confederate themſelues with ſtraungers, they vſed to binde their thombs harde to the thombes of thoſe with whome they would ioyne in friendſhip, and then with an inſtrument pricked euery one of theyr thumbes that the bloud ſpurted out, which they ſucked the one the other, with their tongue: inferring thereby, that they would rather ſheadde their whole bloud, then in one iote to falſifie and breake that friendſhip promiſed betweene them.
                     Is it not a goodly thing to heare him that ſweareth by the Maſſe, of mine honeſty, ſo God ketch mee, by my good ſooth, by cocke and pye, and other like nice oathes, only vnder ſimplicitie thereof to make you belieue a lye he will tell you: which in deed we ſhould leaſt then belieue, when hee is moſt ruffe in his oathes.

For that is a plaine demonſtration, that it is a prepenſed Lye, he would make vs belieue for a truth. It is a ſport to ſee a true man and a Lyer in Argument together: for the true man enforceth his words none otherwiſe but thus: Truely friend, it is euen thus as I tell thee, thou mayeſt if thou wilt belieue mee.
                     And the other to defend and maintaine his Lye, will inuocate for witnes all the diuells of Hell, &amp;c. So that for defence of the Trueth, it ſufficeth to ſtand faſt on his feete: but for the defence of a Lye hee muſt runne throgh the whole world.
                     If I were a King or prince to throw the beloued out of fauour, to put my men out of ſeruice, to depriue men of their office &amp; dignitie, or to diſgrade a knight of his order of knight-hood, or to giue no more faith nor credit to one then an other. I would deſire no better occaſion or teſtimonie, then once to take him with a Lye. And I

would think it leſſe ill, that the fathers ſhould rather pardon a great faulte in their childrē, that friend in his friend, and the maiſter in his ſeruant, then to beare with him in one lye. For by Time the wings of ſin is cut: But to Lye is of ſuch a condition, the elder a man waxeth, the more force and power it hath of him.
                     It is not ynough for a man to be free of this vice, but hee muſt alſo flye and ſequeſter himſelfe from the fellowſhip of thoſe which are poſſeſſed with that fowle and inueterate Error, For, it is commonly ſeene, when a man would bring out a ſudden Lye, to giue it the more credit, he will auouch his friend for a witnes, ſaying: hee knoweth it, and was preſent with me.
                     Now thoſe that heare this famous Lye, and know the very truth in deede of the matter as it was, condemneth his friend he auoucheth (although he be innocent of the matter) for that he is brought in for teſtimony, as they doe this notorious, and ſhameleſſe Lyer.
                     I ſhould lye alſo for companie, if I ſhould denie to tell you, that being in the Court vpon a time in a good preſence, a friende of mine ſtucke not to forge a Lye amongſt others: and ſaid that hee had ſayled in a ſhip, made all of the canes of Synamon, and he auouched mee for a witnes: affirming that I was likewiſe with him in his companie in the ſhip: and I to ſaue his honour (hee being my very friend) being aſhamed he ſhould incurre the name of a Lyer, was compelled ſeriouſly to confirme his tale with him, whereof I repented mee afterwardes with all my heart. For thereby I was in ſecret noted of the hearers, to be as great a lyer as hee.
                     Alſo another time, when I went to preach at the Court (being diſeaſed of the gout) I walked vp and down with a ſtaffe of reede to ſtay me withall, the ſelfe-ſame perſon I told you of before, tolde amongſt the Prelates that were in the Chapell where I preached, that hee had giuen mee a Reede or caue to walke withall, that from one knob to another, it wold hold three great pots of wine.
                     Loe, now by my example you may gather, what ſhame and deſhoneſtie an honeſt vertuous man ſuſtaineth, to bee a friend and companion of one ſo ſhameleſſe and horrible a Lyer.
                     For to bee plaine, I was brought to this paſſe, by meanes of this friend of mine, that I could not tell what I ſhould doe, but when I heard him beginne to ſpeake, to flye from him, and leaue him, becauſe I would not be reputed of like reputation with him: how beit in the end I was forced to vſe this policie: that what hee had openly auouched me a witneſſe in, ſecretly again I would excuſe my ſelfe and denie it.
                     But now returning to our matter againe, I ſay, That theſe Courtiers &amp; Familiars of Princes, ought to exile and baniſh from them this abominable crime of lying: For if a mean gentleman or ſimple Plebeyan happen ſometimes to tell one thing for another, It is but taken of the Hearers ſtraight for a ſimple lye.
                     But being ſpoken by one of the fauoured of the Court, or other Gentleman of reputation, it is thought a kinde of treaſon: For like as betwixt God and the ſinner, our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, is our onely meane and Mediatour, being called vpon by the Prieſt, euen ſo betwixt the king and his Subiects, that are ſuiters to his Prieſts ought not to diſtemble, nor be double in their words Maieſty: thoſe that are in fauour with the prince, are mediators for them: Now therefore if theſe Prieſtes bee double in their wordes and diſſemblers in that they ſpeake, how ſhall the ſinnes of the one be pardoned, &amp; the buſineſſe of the other diſpatched:
                     
                        
Oh wofull and vnhappy ſinner, that putteth his ſinnes into the hands of a naughty and wicked Prieſt, and likewiſe vnfortunate and miſerable is the poore ſuiter that comitteth his affaires to the truſt &amp; diſpatch of a lying and diſſembling Officer.
                     There are many officers in princes Courts, that tell the poore ſuiters ſtill they will diſpatch them, but when it commeth to the puſh, to followe the matter, all his faire words are then but winde, and indeede they make an arte of it, to ſpeake all men faire, to promiſe much, and to performe nothing, weening with their ſweete flattering wordes to winne the hearts and good wills of all, little regarding the great expence and loſſe of time of the poor ſuter: much leſſe alſo reſpecting their owne honour, honeſties, and credite. Sure it were leſſe diſhonour for them, to bee counted rough, and churliſh, then to be bruted for Lyers, and breakers of their promiſe.
                     The officer of the Princes pallace, that is a diſſembler, and a Lyer in his words, and doings, hee may for a time maintaine his ſuites, and goe through with his matters: but in the ende, his trecheries perceiued, himſelfe, his fautor, and all his dealings lye in the duſt, and are vtterly ouerthrowne.
                     Oh how many haue I ſeene riſe in Courte of nothing to great matters, and offices, and this not through their painefull ſeruice, but altogether by meanes of their deceipt and flatteries they vſed: not exalted alſo for theyr merites, but onely by a ſubtill meanes and pollicie they had, to drawe water to their Mill: nor for any good conſcience they had, but onely for theyr great diligence vſed in their practiſes. And all this not without the preiudice of others, but rather to the great hurt and vtter vndoing and ruine of theyr Neighbour: and not for any bountie they had to giue liberally, but a greedy and couetous a deſire to get: not for any needefull buſineſſe, but to haue thoſe that are ſuperfluous: and not for to relieue the poore and needie, but onely to ſatisfie their inſatiable apetites: and in fine, their account caſt, wee haue ſeene after theyr death their goods confiſcated, their ſeruants diſperſed, and gon away, and their Children vtterly vndone.
                     So that in briefe, there was no more memorie of them in this world, and GOD graunt alſo that in the other life their ſoules were not for euerdamned.
                     Courtyers may eaſilie with their fauour and credite attaine vnto great poſſeſſions, as the Iudges may alſo in robbing, the counſellers in pleading, and maintaining naughtie cauſes, the captaines in powling the Prince of the Souldyers wages, the Merchaunts in their falſe weights and meaſures, and their Brokers, in telling lyes out of all meaſure. But in the end of their journy &amp; pilgrimage, they may be aſſured that the ſoules of the Fathers ſhall not only be damned in hell, but the goods ſhall bee taken from their Children. And alſo that that is truely and iuſtly gotten by the honeſt induſtry and trauell of the man, with a good zeale and holie intent, and to a good and iuſt ende: it is written that it ſhall bee of long continuance, &amp; by the good permiſſion of GOD, &amp; prayers of the people, it ſhall alſo proſper and increaſe.
                     For the true gotten goods, atchieued by the ſweat and labour of man, GOD doth alwayes proſper and augment. And therefore continuing our matter, I ſay that the princes officers ought to determine with themſelues, to bee vpright in all their actions and doings, and aboue all, true &amp; iuſt of their words: which ſo performing, they ſhall be ſure to be beloued of all, not alone of them that paſſe vnder their Lee, but euen alſo of thoſe whom they haue denyed fauour. And

alſo they need not to beafraid to ſpeak boldly in all places where they come, beſides that they ſhalbe reuerenced of all men. Where to the contrarie, if he be a lyer, a babbler, &amp; diſſembler, there are few that wil feare them, much leſſe loue them, and leaſt of all do them reuerence, or honour. And although wee cannot denie, but that theſe officers of the Courte, and other men of authoritie be wayted vpon, viſited, accompanyed, reuerenced, and honoured of diuerſe ſortes of men: yet it were a follie for vs to belieue, that their traine and attendaunts doe them all that honour and reuerence, for any deſire they haue to doe them any ſeruice: but only they vſe all that curteſy and capping, to get themſelus &amp; their ſuites quickly diſpatched. And this to be true, we ſee it daily by experience.
                     For, when theſe ſuters haue at chiued their ſuite and deſyre, they doe not onely leaue off, and giue ouer to accompanie him, and to attend vpon him: but moreouer, they get them home, without eyther thanking of him, or once taking their leaue of him.
                     If all thoſe that haue Function, or Office of eſtate or dignitie, (hauing charge of the diſpatch of great and weightie matters, beeing alſo Lyers and diſſemblers in their doings) knew the yll reports that goe of them, and how they condemn their corrupt and naughtic conſciences: me thinketh it impoſſible (if they bee not altogether graceleſſe) but they muſt needs eyther change condition and eſtate, or elſe quite giue vp their rooms and offices. For they are in euery mans mouth called Bablers, liers, diſſemblers, traitors, perjurers, miſerable, auaricious, and vicious. And yet a worſer thing then all this, and that is: whileſt they liue, a thouſand complain of them: and after they are dead and buried, they take vp their bones out of the graue, to hang them vp vpon a gibbet. For thus ſaith the olde prouerbe: Such life, ſuch ende. So as we may ſay, that to theſe officers aboue recited, reſteth nothing but only theſe goodly titles. And herevnto we may adde alſo, that Officers of like conditions to them, need not to haue any to accuſe them, neyther yet to puniſh them. For a time will come one day, that they will plunge themſelues ſo deepe into a Sea of troubles, that it cannot be choſen but they muſt needs at laſt drown, and vtterly periſh, or at the leaſt bee driuen into the hauen of their greateſt Enemyes: ſo that they ſhall carrie the burden of their owne wickednes, and bee condignely chaſtiſed with their owne follie.
                     Therefore I pray all thoſe that ſhall read theſe writings of mine, for to obſerue them in their heart, and imprint them well in minde: beeing a matter of ſuch Moralitie and wiſdome, that it can hardly be vnderſtood of anie, but of ſuch as firſt haue had ſome proofe thereof.
                     
                        Helius Sparthianus writeth, that there was ſomtimes a Senator in Rome called Lucius Torquatus, who was a tyrant, a diſſembler, a great lyer, and very ſeditious, deuiſing onely to ſet diſcord between the Emperor Tytus and the people: who beeing many times complained vpon vnto Titus hee aunſwered them thus: I pray you good people let no man ſeeke to reprooue him, perſwade him, threaten, nor puniſh him: For he is ſo wicked and peruerſe in all things, that I truſt in the Gods one day his owne naughty and crooked condition, ſhall make reuenge and ſatisfaction of all the miſchiefes hee hoth done mee: which was a wonderfull thing in this noble prince, that for an iniurie of ſuch great importance as that was, hee would haue no other reuēge of him, but referre all to that he hoped to ſee by his own yll nature. And ſure the matter well conſidered, hee had good reaſon to doe it.
                     
                        
For a wicked perſon is of this condition, that after hee hath once begun to do euill, he neuer ceaſeth to do worſe, (if hee be not reclaimed by ſome honeſt man, vntill ſuch time as vnwares not looking to himſelfe) he vtterly falleth to ruineand perdition. So that we may aptly compare an ill man, to a cā
                        dle, which after it is once light, it neuer leaueth burning, till it haue made an end of it ſelfe. In great and weightie matters ſomtimes, ſuch as haue the diſpatching of thē, are wont to ſpeake one word for another, &amp; alſo to make ſome fainte promiſes to their ſuiters, not in reſpect to lye to them, nor deceiue them: but to prolong them longer in ſuit, to increaſe their gaine the more. Which I muſt ſay, they ought not to do, much leſſe once to think it. When the Fauoured Courtyer or Officer of the prince is moued in any matter by the ſuter, let him conſider well if it bee any thing that may diſpleaſe the Prince, bee it neuer ſo little: For they muſt take great heed that they tell not Princes nor theyr Seruants any thing that they know may be diſpleaſant to their eares: but only that that ſhall be both pleaſaunt to the eare, profitable to the purſe, and therwithal, that it be true and neceſſary to be told and looked to. For there is no greater deſtruction to the Commonweale, then to bring falſe reports vnto the K: of his affaires.
                     It is one of the greateſt kinds of treaſon that can be, for a Prince to diſcloſe the ſecrets of his heart to his Fauoured Courtyer, and for him againe to tell the Prince nothing but Lyes and tales.
                     How great a friend ſoeuer the Prince be to his Fauoured Courtyer, yet the beloued courtyer ought not to preſume to aduaunce himſelfe to tell, or make his Prince belieue one thing for an other. For the matter afterwards diſcouered, and the truth knowne, it ſhal not bee ynough for him in his excuſe, to tell the Prince that hee made him belieue ſo, onely to ſatisfie his friend. For the King may iuſtly tell him, that it is but an excuſe, and that hee meant no other but to deceiue him. For princes eares and conditions are ſo delicate, that I am bolde to admoniſh thē that are his familiars, and beloued of him, that they endeauour themſelues alwayes to ſpeake (with all humble duty and reuerence) that that is true, yea though in ſecret it pleaſeth the Prince to be merry with them.
                     This is euer true, he that is a friend of veritie, is alſo of iuſtice: and hee that is a friend of iuſtice, is alſo of the common weale: and he that is a friend of the common weale, is euer indued with a good conſcience: and he that hath a good conſcience, conſequently is of a good life, he that is of a good life, is alſo of a good fame, and beloued of all. Albeit we cannot deny, but that his enemies will euer ſpeake euill of him: yet wee may ſay alſo, that they can neuer hurt nor condēne him, but rather hee ſhould be counted a foole of all men, that will goe about or ſeek to be his enemy, who is honeſt in his doings, true in his wordes, modeſt in his behauior, beloued, and well thought of of all. Therfore he putteth himſelfe into a great perill, that dare make himſelfe a companion, and fellow in doings with a wiſe &amp; vertuous man: For he muſt thinke, that accō
                        panying with ſuch a man, he accompanieth not his perſon alone, but alſo the vertues that raigne in him: and if hee doe repugne and gaineſay reaſonable things, hee ſhall ſtraight ſhew himſelfe to come of a wicked race, and to bee plunged and rooted in all malice.
                     Now to the end we may leaue nothing behind, that may ſerue to aduiſe and counſell this our fauoured courtier. I ſay alſo, that there are many other in fauour with the Prince, that oft times do procure the Prince to giue

offices of dignitie, and realtie of the Realme, ſometimes to their kinsfolks, otherwhiles to their friends, and afterwards to their ſeruants alſo, which perhaps are ſo vnmeete and vnworthy for them, that neyther their merites ſhall deſerue to haue them, nor their knowledge and experience alſo fit, for ſo weighty an adminiſtration: And they do not procure theſe offices for them, for that they are wiſe and capable: but onely to aduance them aboue others, and becauſe they are very troubleſome and importunate. I am ſorry to write it, and much more to ſee it, that offices are not giuen now for the benefite of the Commonwealth, but to recompence thoſe of whome the fauoured Courtier hath receyued pleaſure, or elſe to ſatisfie the importunacie of his ſeruants of his owne houſe.
                     But by proceſſe of time it might happen (by meanes of their skilleſſe rule) that the king would take from them altogether their offices, or remoue them from one place to another, although they were neuer well ſetled in a towne, and commodiouſly: And being the Princes pleaſure to do this, the wiſe and beloued Courtier muſt take heede, he doe not contrary the king, much leſſe take vpon him to defend the ill gouernment of thoſe officers, hoping therby to come to greatter honour: For it were leſſe hurt for him, the officer loſt his eſtate and office, then he his credite and reputation. Therefore thoſe in fauour and authoritie ought to content themſelus with the Prince, the ſeruāts with their maſters, and the parents and kinsfols with the Princes officers, for that they procured them theſe offices at the Kings hands, with the ill wills of many: without that they further preaſe, and importune them, to ſuborne their faults: for after that the doings of theſe worthy officers be once diſcouered to be naught and corrupted, it is impoſsible by any meanes to make them good before the prince, with whom all the meanes the parents and kinsfolkes of ſuch perſons can make, cannot ſteade them to bring them to their firſt honour by their owne folly loſt.
                     And now to end this our preſent volume of the fauoured Courtier, I do aſſure all the beloued Courtiers, that if God ſhall find purity in their ſoules, the Common weale iuſtice in theyr owne houſe, &amp; the king troth in their mouthes, and fidelity in their hearts, the good and honeſt men grace in their fauour, and that the ill and wicked boaſt themſelues no more of their authority and office, and that the poor ſhall praiſe them for their good works and the King alſo finde them faithfull ſeruants: I will at this preſent with mine owne hand giue them ſuch faith and aſſurance, that they ſhall neede neuer to feare that God will forſake them, nor that men can hurt them, &amp; that they ſhall neuer bee detected of any infamy, ouerthrown by any miſfortune, neither put out of fauour and credit with their prince at any time.
                  
               
               
                  
                  HERE FOLLOWETH CERTAINE OTHER LETTERS, WRITTEN BY Marcus Aurelius. Selected out of the Spaniſh Copie, not written in the French Tongue.
                  
                     CHAP. I. Of the huge Monſter ſeene in Scicilie in the time of Marcus Aurelius, and of the Letters hee wrote with bloud vpon a gate.
                     
                     
                        IN the yeare of the foundation of Rome 720. and xlii, of the age of Marcus Aurelius, and two yeares before hee tooke poſſeſsion of the empire, the twenty day of Auguſt, about the going downe of the Sunne, in the Realme of Scicill, in the City of Palermo (a port of the ſea) there chanced a thing perillous to them, that ſaw it then, and no leſſe dreadfull to thoſe which ſhall heare it now. Whiles they of Palermo were celebrating a great feaſt with much ioye, that they had vanquiſhed the Nauy of the Numedians, the Pirates diuiding their bootie, were preuented by the Magiſtrates of the City, who cō
                        maunded the whole ſpoyle to be laide vp till the warres were finiſhed: for ſuch was the Law of the Iſle: And truly it was a iuſt law: for oftentimes the onely let why the peace is not made betweene Princes, is becauſe there wanteth riches to ſatisfie the damage done in wars.
                     When all the people were returned home vnto their houſes to Supper (for it was in the Summer) there appeared an huge Monſter in the Citie in this forme. Hee ſeemed to be of the length of three cubites, his head was balde, ſo that his skul did appeare Hee had no eares, ſaue onely two holes in the necke, whereby men iudged that hee heard: he had two writhen hornes like a Goate, his right arme was longer then his left, his

hands were much like the feete of horſes, without throte, his ſhoulders and his head were both of one height, his ſhoulders ſhone as doeth the ſcales of fiſhes, his breſt was all rough of haire. his Face in all things, was much like vnto a man, ſaue that hee had but one Eye, which was in the middeſt of his fore-head.
                     In his Noſe there was but one noſethrill. From the middle downwards, there was nothing ſeen, becauſe it was all couered: he ſate on a charyot with fowre wheeles, which was drawn with fowre beaſts: That is, two Lyons before, and two Beares behind. No man can tell of what wood the Charriot was made. In faſhion it differed nothing from thoſe which other men do accuſtomably vſe.
                     Within this Chariot ſtood a great Chauldron with eares, wherein the Monſter was, wherefore it could not be ſeene but from the middle vpward, It wandred a great ſpace in the Cittie, from one gate to another, caſting out ſparkes of fire.
                     The feare and terror hereof was ſo great throughout all the Cittie, that ſome Women with childe were with great daunger deliuered, and others beeing weake and fainte hearted, fell downe dead.
                     And all the people, both men and women, great and ſmall ranne to the Temples of Iupiter, Mars, and Februa, with dolefull clamours and cryes, making their importunate prayers.
                     At the ſame time, all theſe Rouers were lodged in the Gouernours Pallace of the Cittie, whoſe name was Solyno, borne at Capua, where alſo the riches was kept.
                     After the Monſter had beene in all patts of the Cittie (or in the moſt part thereof) it came to the pallace where the Pyrates were, and cut one of the Lyons eares off, and with the bloud therof wrote theſe Letters vppon the pallace gate, which was ſhut. R. A. S. P. I. P.
                     
                     Theſe Letters were of diuers men diuerſly interpreted: ſo that the interpretations were moe then the letters. And in the end a woman-propheteſſe greatly eſteemed for her ſcience (vnto whome God had giuen this ſecrete knowledge) opened the true meaning of theſe Letters, ſaying: R. ſignifieth Reddite, A aliena, S, ſivultis, P. propria, I. in Pace, P. poſſidere. Which altogether is to ſay: Render vnto others that which is theirs, if you in quyet will poſſeſſe your owne. Truly the pyrates were wonderfully afrayd of this ſudden commaundement, and he Woman was highly commended for her expoſition.
                     This being done, the Monſter went the ſame night out of the City, vnto a high hill called Iamicia, &amp; there ſtood for the ſpace of 3 dayes in the ſight of the City, the Lions with terrible voyces roaring, the Beares with no leſſe fearefull cries raging, and finally, the monſter moſt dreadful flames caſting. During all this time there was neither bride ſeene in the aire, nor beaſt in the fields. And the people offered ſuch great ſacrifices vnto their Gods, that they brake the veines of their handes and feet, and offered the bloud therof to ſee if they coulde appeaſe theyr wrathes.
                     Theſe three dayes being paſſed, there appeared in the Element a maruellous darke cloud, which ſeemed to darken the whole earth, and therewith it beganne to thunder and lighten ſo terrible, that ſundry houſes fell to the ground, and infinite men ended their liues.
                     And laſt of all there came ſuch a flame of fire from the Monſter, that it burned both the Pallace where the Rouers were: and all other thinges that were therein, ſo that all was conſumed with fire: yea the very ſtones themſelues. The

tempeſt was ſo great, that there fell aboue two thouſand houſes, and there dyed more then tenne thouſand perſons. In this place where this Monſter was on the toppe of the Hill the Emperour edified a ſumptuous temple to the God Iupiter in perpetuall memory of the ſame. Whereof afterwards Alexander Emperour, hauing warre with the people of the Iſle, made a ſtrong Caſtle.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II. Of that which chaunced vnto Antigonus a Citizen of Rome, in the time of Marcus Aurelius.
                     
                        AT the ſame time when this woefull chaunce happened in the Iſle, there dwelled a Romane in the ſame City called Antigonus, a man of a noble bloud, and well ſtrucken in age, who with his wife and daughter were baniſhed two yeares beefore from Rome.
                     
                     The cauſe of this baniſhment was this: There was an olde laudable cuſtome in Rome inſtituted by Quintus Cincinnatus the Dictator, that two of the moſt auncient Senators ſhould go with the Cenſour newly created in the moneth of December, to viſite al Rome, and to examine ſeuerally euery Romane, declaring vnto him the 12. Tables, and alſo the particular Decrees of the Senate, demaunding of of them, if they knew any man that had not obſerued theſe lawes: and if they did, they ſhould enforme the Senate thereof. And ſo euery man ſhould receyue condigne puniſhment according to his offence. But they neuer puniſhed before they warned, for they vſed the one yeare to admoniſh them of their faultes, and the next yeare if they did not amend to puniſh them, or elſe to baniſh them: Theſe were the wordes of the Law in the fift Table, and third Chapter.
                     The ſacred Senate doth ordaine the happy people do conſent, and the ancient Colonies doe allow, that if men as men in one yeare doe treſpas, that men as men for that yeare doe winke at them: but if they as euill men doe not amend, that then the good as good men doe puniſh them.
                     Moreouer, the Law ſayd, the firſt faults are diſſembled withall, becauſe they are committed through weake ignorance: but the ſecond ſhall bee puniſhed, becauſe they proceede of negligence and malice.
                     This inquiry was made in the moneth of December, becauſe in the moneth of Ianuary following the Officers of Rome were elected.
                     And it was reaſon the good from the euill ſhould bee knowne, to the entent they might know who merited to haue them, &amp; who deſerued to go without them.
                     The chiefe cauſe why this Antigonus his Wife and his Daughter were baniſhed was this:
                     It was ordained by the eleuenth Emperour of Rome Auguſtus, that no man ſhould bee ſo hardy as to piſſe neere the dores of any temple. And Caligula the fourth Emperour commaunded, that no woman ſhould giue or iell any Letters of Witchcraftes to hang about the peoples neckes, to deliuer them from the Feuer quartaine.
                     And Cato the Cenſour made a Law, that neyther man nor mayde ſhould talke together at the Conduites, where they vſed to fetch water, nor at the riuer where they waſhed their cloths, nor at the bakhouſe where

they baked their Bread: becauſe all the wanton youth of Rome ordinarily haunted one of theſe two places.
                     It chaunced when the Cenſors and Conſulles viſited the warde of mount Celio, Antigonus who dwelled thereby, was accuſed to haue piſſed againſt the walls of the temple of Mars: and his Wife likewiſe was complained of, for ſelling of writings to cure the Feauers: and his daughter was noted for one that commonly haunted the conduits, riuers, and bake-houſes, to talke with young-men: the which in thoſe daies was a great ſhame to maidens of Rome.
                     
                     The Cenſours therefore, ſeeing the euill preſident which they found in the houſe of Antigonus at that time regiſtred alſo before, and that he had been gently thereof admoniſhed: baniſhed him vnto the Iſle of Scicilie, for as long time as it ſhold pleaſe the Senate. And like as in ſumptuous and goodly Buildings, one ſtone falleth not without ſhaking of another, ſo it chaunceth likewiſe to men. For commonly one miſchaunce commeth not alone, but that another immediately followeth.
                     I ſpeake it for this purpoſe, for that Antigonus was not onely depriued of his Honour, goods, and countrey, but alſo by an Earth-quake, his houſe fell downe to the ground, and ſlewe his dearely beloued daughter.
                     Whileſt both theſe miſchaunces hapned, I meane the Monſter of Scicily, and of the baniſhment of Antigonus from Rome, Marke the Emperour was in the warres againſt the Argonantes: where hee receiued a letter from Antigonus of his baniſhment: whereof the Emperour was maruellous ſorrie, as it appeareth by the aunſwere which hee ſent to comfort him.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. III. How Marcus Aurelius ſought the wealth of his people, and how his people loued him.
                     
                     
                        THe ſecond yeare that Marke was elected Emperour the xlv. of his age, when hee returned from the conqueſt of the Germanes, and the Argonants, from whence hee brought great riches and treaſures to the Romane Empire, he to reſt himſelfe, and to appoint his men lay at Salon, vntill ſuch time as the Romanes had prepared all thinges conuenient for ſuch a glorious triumph: There was one thing done which neuer was ſeene in Rome: for the ſame day of his triumph, his ſonne Comodus by the aſſent of the whole people of Rome was choſen Emperour after the death of his Father.
                     Hee was not choſen at the requeſt of his Father, for he was againſt it: ſaying that the Empire ought not to bee giuen for the merites of thoſe which are deade, but hee ſhould bee choſen for his owne good workes beeing aliue.
                     This Emperour ſayde oftentimes that then Rome ſhould bee vndone, when the Election ſhall be taken from the Senate, and when the Emperour ſhall enherite the Empire by patrimonie.
                     Now to come to our matter, the Emperour being at Salon, trauelled much to bring his men into Rome in good order: and Rome was more careful for to receiue him triumphantly,

and as it appertained to ſuch a great conqueſt.
                     He was meruellouſly wel-beloued of all the Empire, and he alwayes ſtudyed the wealth of his People, and they were alwayes moſt faithfull in his ſeruices. So that ſundrie times there was a queſtion moued in the Senate: which of theſe two things was better, beloued: Either the Emperour of his people, or the people of their Emperour.
                     So that one day they appoynted two Iudges in this caſe: The one was the Embaſſadour of the Parthes, and the other was the Embaſſadour of the Rhodes, and the information was giuen on both parts in writing.
                     The Emperour alleadged the great profite he had done to the Commonwealth, and the many euills which hee had deliuered it from.
                     On the other part the Senators declared the good deeds they had done, in his abſence, and the great loue they bare him alwayes in his preſence.
                     So likewiſe the Emperour another day moued an other queſtion to the Senate, affirming that it was more glorie for him to haue ſuch ſubiects, then for them to haue ſuch an Emperour.
                     The Senate denyed it, affirming that the comforte was greater which they had of him, then that which hee could haue of them. And in this wiſe the Emperour gaue the glorie to his people, and the people gaue the glory to their Emperour.
                     Thus merily this matter was reaſoned of againe.
                     It was a pleaſaunt thing to heare the reaſons wherewith each party proued his purpoſe. For the good Emperour attributed the whole Land, for a perpetuall memorie vnto the people, becauſe of the great obedience, diligent ſeruice, and faithfull loue, which hee had found in them. And on the other parte the Fortunate people, gaue the glory vnto the Emperour, for his clemencie, and mercifulneſſe, for his vprighteous gouerning, for his honeſtie of liuing, and for his ſtoute courage in conqueting.
                     It was a thing worthy of noting, to beholde, how the people gaue the honour to their Emperour, and how the Emperour attributed the praiſe to his people.
                     Theſe matters were deliuered in truſt to the ſtraunge Embaſſadors, to the ende that all people might learne to obey their Princes, and alſo Princes learne to loue theyr people: only to this end, that by ſuch worthy examples (as it is reaſon) the better ſorte ſhould be encouraged, and the euill diſcomforted.
                     Thus the Noble Emperour prepared all things in readineſſe, with his Captaine and Captiues, for his Entring, and the people of Rome made as great preparation for to receyue him.
                     It was a maruellous thing for to ſee what people came forth of Rome to meete him, and what infinit number were at Salon to behold him. They that were at Salon had their eyes there and their hearts at Rome, and they that were at Rome had their hearts at Salon in ſuch ſort, that their hearts dazeled with that they ſaw, and their heartes alſo reioyced for that they hoped to ſee.
                     For there is no greater torment to the heart, then when it is deferred from that which it greatly deſired.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. IIII. How at the interceſſion of many which the Empreſſe had ſent, The Emperour graunted his daughter Lucilla licenſe to ſport her ſelfe at the feaſts.
                     
                     
                        YOu ſhal vnderſtand that the Romanes vſed alwayes in the moneth of Ianuary to permit that their Emperours ſhould triumph. And it chā
                        ced that at that time when they prepared for the triumph, Fauſtine the Empreſſe cauſed diuers noble Barrons to demaund licence of the Emperour, that her daughter might come from her miſtreſſe, where ſhee was taught, to the feaſts. Her name was Lucilla, who was elder then the prince Comodus her brother.
                     Shee had a goodly ieſture, ſhe was well made in the body, and deerely beloued of her mother, whom ſhee reſembled not onely in beauty, but alſo in liuing. Though the requeſt ſeemed to be reaſonable, and thoſe that made it his Counſellours and great about him, and thogh him whom they asked was the father, and ſhe that demaunded it was the mother, and ſhee for whom this requeſt was made was the daughter: yet the Emperour would not graunt it, but halfe againſt his will.
                     
                        Fauſtine when ſhee had obtained licence was exceeding glad, &amp; ſo ſoon as ſhee might poſſible, ſhee brought her daughter home vnto the Pallace: And when the day of the great Feaſt and ſolemne triumph came, the young Damoſell perceyuing her ſelfe at large without any Gouernour, truſting in the Innocency of her ſelfe, eſteemed not the malice of any other man: but reioyced with thoſe that reioyced, talked with them that talked, beheld thē that beheld her, and ſhee thought becauſe ſhee meant euill to no man, that no man willed euill to her.
                     In thoſe dayes it was as great an offence for a maide of Rome, to laugh in the company of men: as it was for a woman of Grecia to be taken in adultery with a Prieſt. So greatly was the honeſty at that time of the Romane Matrones regarded, and the lightnes of the maydens was ſo deteſted, that they gaue more ſharper puniſhment for one offence done openly, then for two which were committed in ſecret. Amongſt all other things, from theſe ſeuen the Romane Matrones did maruellouſly refraine, that is to ſay, from talking much at feaſts, from greedie eating among ſtrangers: From drinking wine whiles they were whole: from talking in ſecret with any man: from lifting vp their eyes in the Temples: from gazing much out at the windows, and from wandring abroad without their husbands: for the woman that was apprehended in any of theſe things, was alwayes after counted as one defamed.
                     There are many things ſuffered in perſons of mean eſtate, which cannot be endured in thoſe of higher degree: For Ladies of high renowne cannot keepe the reputation of their eſtates, vnleſſe they are maruellous circumſpect in all their doings.
                     All thinges that degenerate from their kind, deſerue blame, but the diſhoneſt woman meriteth infamy. If Ladies will be counted Ladies indeed let them know how much they excell others in riches, ſo much leſſe licenſe haue they then other to goe gadding in the ſtreetes: For of a ſurety the aboundance of their riches, and the liberty of the perſons, ſhould not bee a

ſpur to prouoke them to gad abroad, but rather a bridle to keepe them within.
                     All this is ſpoken for this cauſe that Lucilla, as a mayde tender and young, and Fauſtine her mother, as one not very old, ſometimes on foot and ſometimes riding: ſometimes openly, and now and then ſecrerly: ſometimes with company, and at other times alone: ſometimes by day, and oft times by night: vſed to foote the ſtreetes of Rome, to view the fields of Vulcane, to ſport them by the riuer of Tyber: to gather the fruites in the Orchardes of Saturne, to ſuppe at the conduites of Nero, and ſuch other vagaries they vſed, The which thinges though their age did deſire, and their idlenes allure them vnto: yet the grauity which Ladies ought to haue ſhould withdraw them from it.
                     I will ſpeake one thing, to the ende that other Ladies and Gentlewomen may take warning thereby: which is, that I cannot tell which was greater, eyther the ſmall diſcretion which moued Fauſtine and Lucilla to wander in ſuch ſort about the ſtreetes, or the audacity that euill men tooke thereby to talke of their perſons, and doubt of their honeſties.
                     The keeping of women in their houſes, is like vnto a bridle to holde ſtill euill mens tongues. The woman that is a ſtrayer abroad, putteth her good name in much danger. Of truth it were better for a woman neuer to be borne, then to liue with an euill name. Among all the families of the Ancient Romanes, that of the Cornelians was counted moſt fortunate, for among the men there was neuer any found a coward, nor among the women any that was defamed.
                     The Hiſtoriographers ſay, that there was one woman of that linage onely, for beeing light in her behauiour, was by the handes of her owne parents executed, and put to death. Surely, it was well done of the Romanes, to the intent that the lightneſſe of one woman alone, ſhould not defame the whole family. Where as is nobleneſſe and honeſty: there the matters that touch the honour, ought not to tarry whiles they bee remedied by iuſtice: but from that man or woman which among all hath loſt his good name, from the number of the liuing he ought alſo to be taken. It is not ſufficient for one to himſelfe to be good: but it is requiſite that hee giue no occaſion to others to iudge him to be euill.
                     All the loſſes of temporall goods that chance vnto men in this life, ought not to be compared with a little blemiſh of a mans good name. The man that hazardeth for a trifle his good name in this world, ſhal at a bū
                        dred ſhootes ſcarſly ſhoote one right. And contrariwiſe, that man that hath loſt his honeſty, and that eſteemeth not the reputation of his perſon, truly from him we ſhall neuer ſee any good thing proceed.
                     Now the Emperour like vnto a wiſe ſhippe-maſter, fearing after the great calmes ſome tempeſtuous ſtorme: ſeeing the lightneſſe of his Daughter, and vanitie of the Mother (I meane in the time of this great mirth and gladneſſe) feared leaſt any infamy ſhould enſue vnto theſe two Ladies.
                     And for a ſurety hee doubted not without a cauſe: for it is an infallible rule of enuious Fortune for to giue vs in many yeares a little proſperity, to the entent that afterwardes ſuddenly and at vnawares ſhee may bring vs into ſome great aduerſity.
                     By experience dayly we ſee, that the Sea is ſeldome times calme: but immediately there followeth ſome perillous Tempeſt. The extreame

heate of the day doth prognoſticate, that terrible thunder is the Euentide. I meane, when Fortune doth flatter vs with her golden pilles: it is a token that ſhee intendeth to catch vs in her ſnares.
                     The Mylner before the banke broken repayreth the dammes. The husband man before it raineth, thacketh his houſe, fearing the ſnow and raine that is to come.
                     So likewiſe the ſage man ought to cōſider that during this life he hath proſperitie but by leaue and aduerſity, as by patrimony.
                     
                        Marcus Aurelius among all other men was hee that knew how to enioy proſperity, and alſo to preuaile of aduerſity. Though fortune gaue him much proſperitie, yet he neuer truſted therein, nor for any troubles that euer he receyued in this life, he was at any time abaſhed.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. V. Of the ſharpe words which Marcus Aurelius ſpake to his wife, and to his daughter.
                     
                     
                        WHen the triumphes before named were finiſhed, this good Emperour then beeing willing to vnburden his heart, and to aduiſe Fauſtine, and to teach the yong damoſell his daughter, and to the end, that no man ſhould heare it, he called them a part, and ſayde vnto them theſe words.
                     I am not content Fauſtine with that thy daughter did, nor yet with that which thou haſt done, being her mother.
                     The daughters if they will bee counted for good Children, muſt learne to obey their fathers: and the mothers if they will be counted good mothers, muſt learn to bring vp their daughters well.
                     When the mother is honeſt, and the daughter ſhamefaſt, the father is excuſed in giuing counſell.
                     It is great ſhame to the Father being a man, that the Mother (beeing a woman) ſhould chaſtife his ſonne. And this is a great reproach to the mother, that the daughter ſhould bee chaſtiſed by the hands of any man.
                     There was a Law enacted amongſt the Rhodians, that neyther the Fathers ſhould haue to do with the daughters, nor the mothers with the Sonnes, but the men vſed to bring vp the men, and the women the women. And in ſuch wiſe, that they abiding all in one houſe, it ſeemeth vnto the fathers, that they had no daughters, and vnto the mothers that they had no ſonnes.
                     Oh Rome, Rome, I bewaile thee not to ſee thy ſtreets vnpaued, nor to ſee thy houſes ſo decayed, nor to ſee thy battlements ſo fallen downe, nor thy timber hewed downe, not for the diminiſhing of the inhabitants: for all this Time bringeth, and Time taketh away, but I weepe for thee againe, to ſee thee vnpeopled of good-fathers and vnprouided in the nouriſhing of their children.
                     Rome beganne to decay, when the diſcipline of Sonnes and Daughters was enlarged, and that their bridle was ſet at libertie. For there is now ſuch boldnes in Boyes, and ſo little ſhamefaſtnes in Gyrles, with diſhoneſtie of the Mothers: that whereas one Father ſufficed for xx. Sonnes, and one Mother for xx. daughters: now xx. fathers dare ſcarcely vndertake to bring vp well one Sonne, and xxx. Mothers one daughter.
                     I ſay this to you Fauſtine, you remember not how you are a Mother:

For, you giue more libertie to your Daughter then ought to bee ſuffered And now Lucilla, remember not how you are a daughter: for you ſhew to haue more libertie then requireth for a young Maiden.
                     The greateſt gift that the Gods haue giuen to the Matrones of Rome is, becauſe that they are women, they keepe themſelues cloſe and ſecret, &amp; becauſe they are Romanes they are ſhamefaſt. The day when the women want the feare of the Gods ſecretlie, and ſhame of men openly beleeue me they ſhall either faile the world, or the world them.
                     The common wealth requireth it of great neceſsity, that the women which therein inhabite ſhould bee as honeſt, as the Captaines valiant: for the Captaines going to warre defend them, and the women which abide at home conſerue them. As now foure yeares paſſed you ſaw this great peſtilence, and I demaunded then to haue account of the people, and I found that of a C. and xl. M. honeſt women lxxx. M. dyed, and of x. M. diſhoneſt women, in a manner they ſcaped all: I cannot tell for which I ſhould weep, eyther for the lacke that wee haue of the good and vertuous Women in our common wealth, or elſe for the great hurt and dammages that theſe euill and wicked women doe to the youth of Rome.
                     The fire that burneth in Mount Ethna, doth not ſo much endamage thoſe that dwell in Scicill, as one euill woman doth within the walls of Rome.
                     
                     A fierce beaſt and a perillous enemie to the Common wealth is an evill woman, for ſhee is of power to commit all euils, and nothing apt to doe any good. O how many realmes and Kingdomes reade wee of, which by the euill behauiours of one woman haue been loſt, and to reſiſt againſt them, there hath beene neede both of wiſedome, perils, money, and force of many men.
                     The vices in a woman is as a green Reede, that boweth euery way: but the lightnes and diſhoneſty is as a dry Kyxe that breaketh, in ſuch wiſe that the more euill they vtter, the more vnlikely is the amendment therof.
                     Beholde Fauſtine, there is no creature that more deſireth honour, and worſe keepeth it, then a Woman, and that this is true, wee ſee by Iuſtice, by Orations, by writing, and other Trauells, man getteth fame and renowm: but without it bee by flattering, and faire ſpeaking, this houre by auncient wryters we can read of few women or none, which eyther by writing, reading, working with Needle, ſpinning, or by weauing, haue gotten them any great renowme.
                     But euen I ſay of one, ſo I ſay of another, certainly of diuers we reade, by keeping themſelues cloſed in their houſes, being well occupyed in their buſines, temperate &amp; modeſt in their wordes, faithfull to their Husbandes, well-ordered in theyr perſons, peaceable with their Neighbours, and finally for beeing honeſt amongſt their owne Familie, and ſhamefaſt amongſt ſtrangers, they haue obtained great renown in their life time, and left perpetuall memorie of them after their death.
                     I will tell you an ancient hiſtory as profitable to reſtraine your vices, as it did then augment vertues, which is this: The Realme of the Lacedemonians ſaieth Plato: was a long time as diſſolute through the vnthriftines of the women-kinde, as infamed by the vices of the men: So that of all Nations they were both called and eſteemed barbarous, what time Greece of the Phyloſophers, was called The Mother of Phyloſophers.
                     
                     
                        Lycurgus, a moſte wiſe Phyloſopher in knowledge, and a right iuſt king concerning his gouernāce, partly

with his doctrine very profitable, and partly with his life moſt pure, ordayned Lawes in the ſaid Realm, whereby hee expelled all vices, and planted all vertues. I cannot tell which of theſe two were moſt happyeſt, the King hauing ſo obedient people, or elſe the Realme to haue ſo worthie a King?
                     Amongſt other Lawes for women, hee enacted one worthy of high commendations: the wich commaunded that the Father which dyed, ſhould giue nothing to his daughter: and an other, that neyther liuing nor dying, hee ſhould giue any Money to marrie her withall: to the intent that none ſhould take her for her goods, but only for her vertues: and not for her beautie, but for her good qualities: whereas now ſome are forſaken, becauſe they be poore, ſo then they abode vnmarryed, becauſe they were vicious.
                     Oh Time worthie to bee deſired: when maydens hoped not to be marryed with their Fathers goods, but by the vertuous works of their owne perſons: this was the time called The golden Worlde: when neither the daughter feared to be diſinerited by the father in his life, nor the Father to dye ſorrowfull, for leauing her without dowrie at his death.
                     Oh Rome, treble accurſed bee hee that firſt brought Gold into thy houſe, and curſed be he that firſt beganne to hoord vp treaſures. Who hath made Rome to be ſo rich of Treaſures, and ſo poor of vertues? who hath cauſed noble-men to marry the Plebeyans, and to leaue the daughters of Senatours vnmaried? what hath made that the rich mans Daughter is demaunded vnwilling, and the daughter of a poor man none will deſire: What hath cauſed that One marryeth a Foole, with 500. marks, rather then a wiſe woman with ten thouſand vertues: then I will not ſay that in this caſe the fleſh vanquiſhed the fleſh: but I ſay that vanitie is ouercome of malice. For, a couetous perſon will now-adayes rather take a wife that is rich and foule, then one that is poore and faire?
                     Oh vnhappy woman that bringeth forth children, and more vnhappie be the daughters that are born, the which to take in marriage no man deſireth: neyther for the bloud of their predeceſſors, nor the fauor of their friends, nor the worthineſſe of their perſons, nor the puritie of their liues.
                     Oh wicked world, where the daughter of a Good-man without money ſhal haue no mariage: but it was not wont to bee ſo. For, in the olde time when they treated of Marriages: firſt they ſpake of the perſons, and afterward of the goods: not as they do at this preſent in this vnhappie time. For now they ſpeak firſt of the goods, and laſt of all of the perſons.
                     
                     In the ſaid Golden-world, firſt they ſpake of the vertues, that the perſon was endued with, and when they were marryed, as it were in ſporte, they would ſpeake of the Goods.
                     
                     When Camillus triumphed ouer the Gaules, he had then but one ſonne, and he was ſuch a one that his deſerts merited great praiſe: and for the renowm of his Father, diuers Kings deſired to haue him to their ſonnes, and diuers Senators deſired to haue him to their ſonnes in law. This yong man, being of the age of thirty years, and the Father at 60. was importunately ſtyrred by his naturall friendes, and deſires of ſtrange kings, for to marie him: but alwayes the olde Camille withſtood the counſell of his friends, and the importunitie of the ſtraungers.
                     When it was demaunded, why he determined not vpon ſome Marriage for his ſonne: ſith thereby ſhould enſue the quyet life of the man, and the ioy and comforte of himſelfe, in his age: He aunſwered them thus,
                     
                        
I will not marry my Sonne, becauſe ſome offer mee rich daughters, ſome noble of lynage, ſome young, and ſome fayre. But there is none hath ſayde to mee, I giue you my vertuous daughter.
                     Certainely Gamille merited triumph, for that hee did, and deſerued eternall memory for that he ſaid.
                     I ſpake to you Fauſtine, all theſe wordes, becauſe I ſee you leade your daughter to Theaters and playes, and bring her into the capitol you put her to the keeping of the Sword players: you ſuffer her to ſee the Tumblers, and yet doe not remember that ſhee is young, and you not too aged, you goe into the ſtreetes without licence, and ſport you by the riuers: I find no villany therein, nor thinke that your daughter is euill but I ſay it, becauſe you giue occaſion that ſhe ſhould not bee good.
                     Beware, beware Fauſtine, neuer truſt to the race of fleſh of young people: nor haue no confidence in old folkes, for there is no better way then to flye the occaſion of all things.
                     For this intent the virgins veſtals are cloſed vp betweene the walles, to eſchew the occaſions of open places, not to bee more light and fooliſh, but to bee more ſad and vertuous, flying occaſions. The young ſhall not ſay, I am young and vertuous: nor the olde ſhall not ſay, I am olde and broken: for of neceſſity the drie flaxe will burne in the fire, and the greene flagge ſmoke in the flame.
                     I ſay, though a man be a Diamond ſet among men, yet of neceſſity hee ought to bee quicke, and to melte as waxe in the heate among Women. Wee cannot deny that though the Wood bee taken from the fire, and the imbers quenched: yet nevertheleſſe the ſtones oftentimes remaine hote.
                     In likewiſe the fleſh, though it bee chaſtiſed with hote and drie diſeaſes, conſumed by many yeares with trauell, yet concupiſcence abideth ſtill in the bones.
                     What neede is it to blaze the vertues, and deny our Naturalities? certainely there is not ſo olde a horſe, but if hee ſee a Mare will neigh once or twice: there is no man ſo young nor old but let him ſee fayre young Damſels, eyther hee will giue a ſigh, or a wiſh,
                     In all voluntary things I deny not but that one may bee vertuous: but in naturall thinges I confeſſe euery man to be weake. when you take the wood from the fire, it leaueth burning: when Sommer commeth, the colde winter ceaſeth, when the ſea is calme, the waues leaue their vehement motions: when the Sunne is ſet, it lightneth not the World. I will ſay then, and not before, the fleſh wil ceaſe to trouble vs, when it is layde in the graue: of the fleſh wee are borne, in the fleſh wee liue, and in the fleſh wee ſhall dye: and therby it followeth, that our good life ſhall ſooner end, then our fleſhlie deſires forſake vs: oftentime ſome wholeſome fleſh corrupteth in an euil Veſſell, and good wine ſometimes ſauoureth of the foiſt. I ſay, though that the Workes of our life bee vertuous, yet ſhall wee feele the ſtench of the weake fleſh,
                     I ſpake this, Fauſtine, ſith that age cannot reſiſt thoſe hote apetites, how can the tender members of youth reſiſt them? vnleſſe you that are the Mother goe the right way, how ſhould the Daughter that followeth you find it? The Romane Matrones, if that they will bring vppe their Daughters well, ought for to keepe and obſerue theſe Rules, when they doe ſee that they would wander abroade, that they breake their legges, and if that they ſhould bee gazing, then put out their eyes: and if they will

liſten, ſtop their eares: if they will giue or take, cut off their hands: if they dare ſpeake, ſowe vp their mouthes: if they will pretend any lightnes, burie them quicke: death ought to be giuen to an euill Daughter, in ſteade of a dowrie: for gyftes, giue her wormes, and for her houſe, a graue.
                     Take heed Fauſtine if you will haue much ioy of your daughter, take from her all the occaſions wherby ſhe ſhall be euil. To vnderſet a houſe, behoueth diuers proppes: and if the principalls be taken away, it will fall downe: I ſay you women are ſo fraile, that with keepers, with great paine they can keepe themſelues: and for a ſmall occaſion they will loſe altogether.
                     Oh how many euill hath there bin, not for that they would be ſo, but becauſe they followed ſuch occaſions, the which they ought to haue eſchewed.
                     It is at my pleaſure to enter into this battel but yet it is not in my power to attaine the victorie, it is for mee to enter into the Sea, yet it lyeth not in my hands to eſcape the perill: it is in the hands of a woman to enter into the occaſion, and after that ſhee is therin, it is not in her power to eſcape from euill, nor to deliuer her from tongues.
                     Peraduenture Fauſtine, thou wilt ſay vnto mee, none can ſpeake to your daughter Lucilla, vnleſſe thou heareſt it, nor ſee her but thou ſeeſt him, nor conuey her, but thou knoweſt where: nor make any appoyntment, without thy conſent: and yet thou knoweſt, that thoſe which will her euill, ſeeke with their tongues to diſhonour her: and thoſe that with their heartes loue her, ſpeake only in their harts.
                     Wee loue in young bloud, in the ſpring time, and flouriſhing youth is a poyſon, that forthwith ſpreadeth into euery vaine, it is an herbe that entreth into the entrailes, a ſwouning that incontinently mortifieth all the members and a peſtilence that ſlaieth the hearts: and finally, it maketh an end of all vertues. I know not what I ſay: but I feele that which I would ſay, for I would neuer blaze loue with my tongue, except I were ſore wounded therewith in my heart.
                     
                        Ouid ſayeth in his booke of the art of loue, Loue is I wot not what, it it commeth I know not from whence, who ſent it I wot not, it engendreth I know not how: it is ſatisfied I know not wherewith: it is ſelf, and I know not how, oft it ſlayeth, I know not wherefore: and finally, without breaking the fleſh outwardly, loue taketh roote, and moleſteth the heart inwardly. I know not what Ouid meaneth hereby, but I know when he ſayde theſe words, he was as farre baniſhed from himſelfe, as I am at this time from my ſelfe.
                     O Fauſtine, they that loue together, vtter the ſecrets of their hearts by diuers wayes, and in ſleeping they reaſon and ſpeake by ſignes, they vnderſtand each other. The many wordes outwardly declare ſmall loue inwardly, and the ſeruent inward loue keepeth ſilence outward. The entrailes within embraced with loue, cauſe the tongue outward to be mute: hee that paſſeth his life in loue, ought to keepe his mouth cloſe. And to the entent that you ſhall not thinke, that I ſpeake Fables: I will prooue this by auncient hiſteries, we find anciently, that in the yeare cclxx. after the foundation of Rome, Etraſco a young Romane that was dumbe, and Verona a fayre Lady of the Latines which was dumb alſo: Theſe two ſaw each other on the mount Celio at the Feaſtes, and there fell in loue together, and their hearts were as ſore fixed and entangled in Loue, as their tongnes were tyed from ſpeech.
                     
                        
It was a maruellous thing to ſee then, and fearefull to note now that this young Lady came from Salon to Rome: and he went from Rome to Salon, ſundry times by the ſpace of 30. yeares, without the knowledge of any perſon, and neuer ſpake together. It chanced at the laſt, that the husbande of the Lady Verona dyed, and the wife of Etraſco alſo, and then they diſcouered their loue, and treated a marriage betweene them.
                     And theſe two dumbe perſons had iſſue a ſonne of whom deſcended the noble lynage of our Scipions, which were more famous in the ſeates of Armes, then their Father and mother were troubled for want of words.
                     Then Fauſtine marke this thing, it had little auayled to haue cut out the tongues of the two dumbe perſons to haue remedied their loue, and not to haue cut our their hearts.
                     And I ſhall tell you of Maſiniſſa, a worthy knight of Numidie, and Sophoniſſa a famous Lady of Carthage, all onely by one ſight as they ſaw each other on a Ladder, hee declareth his deſire vnto her, and ſhe knowing his luſt, breaking the ores of feare, and lifting vp the anchors of ſhame, rayſed incontinent the ſayles of their hearts, and with the ſhippes of their perſons they ioyned each to other, heere wee may ſee how the firſt ſight of their eyes, the knowledge of their perſons, the conſent of their hearts, the copulation of their bodies, the decay of their eſtates, and the loſſe of their names, in one day, in one houre, in one moment, and in one ſteppe of a Ladder, were loſt: What will you that I ſay more to this purpoſe? Doe you not know what Helen the Greeke and Paris the Troian of two ſtraunge Nations, and of farre Countries, with the one onely ſight in a Temple their willes were ſo knitte together, that hee tooke her as his Captiue, and ſhee abode his priſoner.
                     In Paris appeared but ſmall ſorce, and in Helene but ſmall reſiſtance: ſo that in a manner thoſe two yong perſons, the one procuring to vainquiſh, and the other in ſuffering to bee vanquiſhed: Paris was the cauſer of his Fathers deſtruction, and both of their own deaths, loſſe and damage to both their Realmes, and ſlaunder to all the world. All this loue grew of one onely ſight.
                     When great King Alexander would haue giuen Battell to the Amazones, the queene (captaine of them) no leſſe faire then ſtrong and vertuous, came to a Riuers-ſide: and the ſpace of an houre each of them beheld the other, with their eyes, without vttering of any worde.
                     And when they returned to theyr Tents, their fiercenes was turned into ſweete amorous words. When Pyrrus the faithfull defender of the Tharrentines, and renowmed king of the Epyrotes was in Italie, he came into Naples, and had not beene there but one day, but hee was enamoured of a faire lady named Gemelicia, of a high linage and greatly eſteemed for her beautie, and the very ſame day ſhe was gotten with childe, and ſhamed throughout all Italie, and caſt out of the cittie: and after that ſhe was deliuered of childe, ſhe was ſlaine by one of her owne bretheren.
                     Alſo queene Cleopatra in the Prouince of Bythinia, in the wood Sechin, made a goodly banket to Marcus Anthonius her Louer, and though ſhee was not very honeſt of her ſelfe, yet had ſhee with her chaſt women. And thus the Banket endured a great parte of the night.
                     Now the wood being thicke, young damzels were not ſo wily to hide thē, but the yōg men Romains found them: ſo that of 60. daughters of the Senators 55. were goten with child among

the thicke buſhes, which thing made a great ſlaunder in the people, and augmented the infamy of Marcus Anthonius.
                     
                     Thus as I haue ſhewed of a ſmall number, I could ſay of many other. All men are not men, nor all women are not women. I ſpeake it, becauſe I would it ſhould bee ſaide, let it touch them that it toucheth, and let them that come vnderſtand me. There are ſom ſhips which are ſo light that they will ſayle with a little winde. And there bee other ſome milles that will grinde with a little water. I ſay there bee ſome women ſo brickle, that as a glaſſe with a philip will breake, and will ſlippe with a little mire.
                     Tell mee Fauſtine, haue you ſuffered your daughter to ſpeake but with her vncles, and keepe company but with her couſins? I ſay in this caſe, that the mother is in as much blame, as the daughter in perill.
                     Doe you not know, that the hote fire doth not forbeare the wood, bee it wet or drie: but in like manner it conſumeth the hard ſtones.
                     Doe you not know that the extreame hunger cauſeth beaſts to deuoure with their owne teeth the thing that was bredde in their entrals? Doe you not know, that the gods made a Law ouer all things, except ouer Louers, becauſe they may not abide it: and doubtles much more then I haue ſayde.
                     And diuers times mee thinkes I ſhould fall downe, becauſe I dare not weepe with mine eyes, yet I feele it inwardly in my heart. I would faine commune with thee in diuers things: Come I pray thee to Briette, to the entent that wee may ſpeake together: And ſith it hath pleaſed the Gods to take my child from mee that I loued ſo well, I would counſell with thee that art my louing friend. But fewe dayes paſſed, there came thither an Ambaſſadour from the Rhodes, to whom I gaue the moſt part of my horſes: and from the fartheſt part of Spaine, there were brought me eight: of the which I ſend thee foure. I would they were ſuch as might pleaſe thee: The Gods be thy ſafeguard, and ſend mee and my wiſe ſome comfort.
                     
                        Marcus Aurelius right ſorrowfull hath written this with his owne hand.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VI. A Letter ſent by Marcus Aurelius Emperour to Catullus Cenſorius, of the newes which were at that time in Rome.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArcus the new Cenſor, to thee Catullus now aged, ſendeth ſalutations. There are ten dayes paſt, that in the temple of God Ianus I receyued thy Letter: and I take the ſame God to witneſſe, that I had rather haue ſeene thy perſon: Thou deſiredſt that my letters may belong but the ſhortneſſe of time maketh mee to aunſwere thee more briefly, then I would. Thou willeſt mee to giue thee knowledge of the newes here. Thereto I aunſwere, that it were better to demaund, if there were any thing remayning here in Rome, or Italy, that is old: For now by our euill deſtinies, all that is good and olde, is ended: and new things which bee euill, now beginne: The Emperour, the Conſull, the Tribune, the Senators, the Ediles, the Flamines, the Pretours and Centurions, all things be new ſaue the vertues which be old.
                     Wee paſſe the time in making new officers, in deuiſing new counſels,

and in rayſing new Subſidies. In ſuch wiſe that there hath beene now more nouelties within theſe 4. yeares, then in times paſſed in 400. yeares: we now aſſemble together 300. to counſell in the Capitoll, and there wee bragge and boaſt, ſweare and promiſe that wee will exalt the vertuous, and ſubdue the vitious, fauour the right, &amp; not winke at the wrong, puniſh the euil, and reward the good, repaire old, and edifie new, plucke vices vp by the rootes, and to plant vertues, to amend the olde, and follow the good, reproue tyrants, and aſſiſt the poore: and when that wee are gone from thence, they that ſpeake beſt words are often taken with the worſt deedes.
                     O wicked Rome, that now a dayes hath ſuch Senators, which in ſaying we will doe, we will doe, paſſe their I for &amp; ſo euery man ſeeking his owne profit forgetteth the weale publike: Oftentimes I am in the Senate to beholde others as they regarde mee: and I do maruell much to heare the eloquence of their words, the zeale of iuſtice, and the iuſtification of their perſons: and after that I come thence, I am aſhamed to ſee their ſecret extortiōs, their damnable thoughts, and their euill workes.
                     And yet there is another thing of more maruell, and not to be ſuffered, that ſuch perſons as are moſt defamed and vſe moſt wicked vices, with their moſt damnable intentions make their auowes to doe moſt extreame iuſtice. It is an infallible rule, and of humane malice moſt vſed: that hee that is moſt hardy for to committe greateſt crimes, is moſt cruell to giue ſentence againſt an other for the ſame offence.
                     Wee thinke that wee behold our owne faults, as through ſmall nettes, which cauſe things to ſeeme the leſſe: but we beholde the faultes of others in the water, that cauſeth them to ſeeme greater.
                     Oh how many haue I ſeene condemned by the Senate, for one ſmall fault, done in all their life: and yet they themſelues commit the ſame euery houre.
                     I haue read in the time of King Alexander the great, there was a renowmed Pyrate on the Sea, called Dyonides, the which robbed and ſpoiled al the ſhipping that hee could get: and by commaundement of this good King Alex: there was an armie ſent foorth to take him. And when he was taken and preſented to K. Alexander, the King ſai
                           •
                        e vnto him, Shew me Dyonides, why doſt thou ſo ſpoyle on the Sea, that no ſhip can ſayle out of the Eaſt into the weſt for thee? The pyrate aunſwered, and ſayde: if I ſpoyle the Sea, why doeſt thou Alexander rob both the Sea and Land alſo? O Alexander, becauſe I fight with one ſhippe in the Sea, I am called a thiefe: and becauſe thou robbeſt with two hundreth ſhips on the Sea, and troubleſt all the world with 200000. men, thou art called an Emperour.
                     I ſweare vnto thee Alexander, if Fortune were as fauourable to me, and the Gods as extreame againſt thee: they would giue mee thine Empyre, and giue thee my little ſhippe: and then peraduenture I ſhould bee a better king then thou art, and thou become a worſe Thiefe then I am.
                     Theſe were high words, and well receyued of Alexander: and of truth to ſee if his wordes were correſpondent to his promiſes, hee made him of a pyrate a great captaine of an Armie, and hee was more vertuous on Land, then he was cruell on the Seas. I promiſe thee Catullus, Alexander did right well therein, and Dyonides was to bee praiſed greatly for that hee had ſaide. Now-adayes in Italie they that robbe openly are called Lords, and they that robbe priuilie, are commonly called

theeues. In the Annales of Liuius I haue read, that in the ſecond troublous warre punicke, between the Romanes and the Carthagenians, there came an Ambaſſadour Luſitaine ſent from Spaine, and to treate of accord of peace.
                     When hee came to Rome, he proued before the Senate, that ſith hee entred into Italy, he had bin ten times robbed of his goods: and whiles he was at Rome, he had ſeene one of them that robbed him, hang vpanother that had defended him.
                     Hee ſeing ſo euill a deed, and how the theefe was ſaued without iuſtice: as a deſperate man tooke a cole, and wrote vpon the gybet as followeth. O gybet, thou art planted among theeues, nouriſhed among theeues, ſquared of theeues, wrought of theeues, and hanged full of Innocents, with innocents.
                     
                     The originall of theſe wordes are in the hiſtory of Liuius, where the whole Decade was written with blacke inke, and theſe words with redde vermelion.
                     I cannot tell what other newes I ſhould ſend thee, but that euery thing is ſo new and ſo tender, and it ioyned with ſo euill ſement, that I feare mee, all will fall ſuddenly to the ground. I tell thee that ſome are ſuddenly riſen within Rome vnto honour, whoſe fal I dare rather aſſure then life: For all buildinges haſtily made, cannot bee ſure. The longer a tree is kept in his kinde, the longer it will bee ere it bee olde.
                     The trees whoſe fruite wee eate in Summer, doe warme vs in Winter: Oh how many haue wee ſeene, wherof we haue maruelled of their riſing, and beene abaſhed at their falles. They haue growne as a whole peece, and ſuddenly waſted as a skumme. Their felicity hath beene but a ſhort moment, and their infortune as a long life.
                     Finally, they haue made a mille, and layde on the ſtones of increaſe, and after a little grinding, left it vnoccupied all the yeare after, Thou knoweſt well, my friend Catullus, that wee haue ſeene Cincius Fuluius in one yeare made Conſull, and his children Tribunes, his wife a Matrone for young maydens: and beſides that, made keeper of the Capitoll: and after that not in one yeare, but the ſame day we ſaw Cincius beheaded in the place, his children drowned in Tiber, his Wife baniſhed from Rome, his houſe razed down to the ground, and all his goods confiſcated to the common Treaſury.
                     This rigorous example wee haue not read in any booke, to take a copie of it, but wee haue ſeene it with our eyes, to keepe it in our minds. As the Nations of people are variable, ſo are the conditions of men diuers. And mee thinketh this is true, ſeeing that ſome loue, ſome hate, and that ſome ſeeke, ſome eſchew: and that ſome ſet little by, other make much ſtore. In ſuch wiſe, that all cannot bee content with one thing, nor ſome with all things cannot be ſatisfied. Let euery man chuſe as him liſt, &amp; embrace the world when hee will, I had rather mount a ſoft pace to the falling, and if I cannot come thereto, I will abide by the way, rather then with the ſweat to mount haſtily, and then to tumble downe headlong.
                     In this caſe ſith mens hearts vnderſtand it: we neede not to write further with pennes. And of this matter, marke not the little that I doe ſay, but the great deale that I will ſay. And ſith I haue begunne, and that thou art in ſtrange lands, I will write thee all the newes from hence.
                     This yeare the 25. day of May, there came an Ambaſſadour out of Aſia, ſaying hee was of the Iſle of Cetin, a Baron right proper of body,

ruddy of aſpect, and hardy of courage: Hee conſidered being at Rome, thogh the Summers dayes were long, yet Winter would draw on, and then would it bee daungerous ſayling into this iſle, and ſaw that his buſines was not diſpatched: On a day beeing at the gate of the Senate, ſeeing all the Senators enter into the Capitoll, without any armour vpon them, he as a man of good ſpirite, and zelator of his Country, in the preſence of vs all ſayd theſe words:
                     O Fathers Conſcript: O happie people, I am come from a ſtraunge countrey to Rome; only to ſee Rome: and I haue found Rome without Rome. The walles wherewith it is incloſed hath not brought mee hither, but the fame of them that gouerne it: I am not come to ſee the Treaſury: wherein is the treaſure of all Realmes: but I am come to ſee the ſacred Senat, out of the which iſſueth counſell for al men: I came not to ſee it, becauſe yee vanquiſh other: but becauſe I thought you more vertuous then all other. I dare well ſay one thing, except the gods make me blinde and trouble my vnderſtanding, yee bee not Romanes of Rome, nor this is not Rome of the Romanes your predeceſſors. Wee haue heard in our Iſle, that diuers realmes haue beene wonne by the valiantnes of one, and conſerued by the wiſedome of all the Senate: and at this houre you are more likely to loſe, then to winne as your Fathers did. Al their exerciſe was in goodnes, and yee that are their children paſſe all your time in Ceremonies: I ſay this yee Romanes, becauſe you haue almoſt killed me with laughing at you, to ſee how you doe all as much your diligence to leaue your armour without the gate of the Senate, as your predeceſſors did take to them to defend the Empire.
                     What profite is it to you to leaue off theſe Armours which hurt the bodies, and to put on them thoſe which kill all the World? What profiteth it to the carefull Suiter, that the Senator entreth vnarmed into the Senat without ſword or dagger, and his hart entreth into the Senate armed with malice. O Romanes, I will that you know that in our Iſle wee eſteeme you not as armed Captaines, but as malitious Senators. You feare vs not with ſharpe golden ſwords and daggers, but with hard hearts, and venemous tongues: If yee ſhould in the Senate put on harneſſe, and therewith take away our liues it were but a ſmal loſſe, ſeing that you ſuſtaine not the Innocents, nor diſpatch not the buſineſſe of ſuiters: I cannot ſuffer it, I cannot tell in what ſtate yee ſtand here at Rome: for in our Iſle we take armour from fooles whether your Armours are taken away as from fooles or mad folks, I know not: if it bee done for ambitiouſneſſe, it commeth not of Romanes but of Tirants: that wranglers and irefull folke ſhould be iudges ouer the peaceable; and the ambitious ouer the meeke, &amp; the malitious ouer the ſimple? if it be done becauſe you are fooles, it is not in the Lawes of the gods, that three hundred fooles ſhould gouerne three hundred thouſand wiſe men.
                     It is a long ſeaſon that I haue tarried for mine anſwere and licence, and by your delayes I am now further off, then I was the firſt day.
                     Wee bring oyle, honey ſaffron, wood, and timber, ſalte, ſiluer: and ſolde out of our Iſle into Rome, and yee will that wee goe elſe where for to ſeeke iuſtice. Yee will haue one Law to gather your rents, and another to determine your iuſtice: yee will that wee pay our tributes in one day, and yee will not diſcharge one of our errands in a whole yeare.
                     I require you Romans, determine your ſelues to take away our liues, &amp;

ſo wee ſhall ende: or elſe heare our complaints, to the intent that we may ſerue you. For in another manner it may be, that ye know by hearing with your eares, which peraduenture yee would not ſee with your eyes. And if yee thinke my wordes be out of meaſure, ſo that ye will remedie my countrey, I ſet not by my life. And thus I make an ende.
                     Verily friend Catullus, theſe bee the words that he ſpake vnto the Senate, which I gate in wryting. I ſay of truth that the hardineſſe which the Romains were wont to haue in other Countreys, the ſame (as now) ſtrangers haue in Rome.
                     
                     There were that ſaide that this Embaſſadour ſhould bee puniſhed, but GOD forbid: that for ſaying trueth in my preſence, he ſhould haue beene corrected. It is ynough, and too much too, to ſuffer theſe euils, though wee ſlea not, and perſecute thoſe that aduertiſe and warne vs of them.
                     The Sheepe are not in ſurery of the wolfe, but if the Shephearde haue his dogge with him. I meane, dogges ought not to leaue barking, for to awaken the Shepheards.
                     There is no GOD commaundeth, nor Law counſelleth, nor Commonwealth ſuffereth, that they which are committed to chaſtice Lyers, ſhould hang them that ſay trouth. And ſith the Senatours ſhewe themſelues men in their liuing, and ſometimes more humane then others that bee Slaues, who elſe ſhould deliuer them, from chaſticement.
                     Oh Rome, and no Rome, hauing nothing but the name of Rome: Where is now become the nobleneſſe of thy Triumphs, the glorie of thy children, the rectitude of thy iuſtice, and the honor of thy tēples? For as now they chaſtice him more that murmureth againſt one onely Senatour, then they do them that blaſpheme all the Gods at once. For it grieueth mee more to ſee a Senatour or Cenſor to bee worſt of all other: then it diſpleaſeth mee that it ſhould be ſaide, that hee is the beſt of all other.
                     For a trueth I ſay to thee my friend Catullus, that now we need not to ſeek to the Gods in the Temples, for the Senators are made gods in our hands
                     There is a difference betweene them that bee immortall, and they that be mortal. For the Gods neuer do thing that is euill, and the Senatours do neuer any thing well. The Gods neuer Lye, and they neuer ſay trueth. The Gods pardon often, and they nouer forgiue: the Gods are content to be honoured fiue times in the yeare, and the Senatours would bee honoured tenne times a day.
                     What wilt thou that I ſay more? but whatſoeuer the Gods doe, they ought to bee praiſed: and the Senatours in all their workes deſerue to be reproued. Finally, I conclude that the Gods are conſtant in euery thing, and erre and faile in nothing: and the Senatours aſſure nothing, but erre in all things. Onely in one thing the Senators are not of reaſon to be chaſticed, and that is: when they intend not to amend their faultes, they will not ſuffer the Oratours to waſte theyr time to ſhew them the truth.
                     Bee it as may be, I am of that opinion, that what man or woman withdraweth their Eares from hearing the truth, impoſſibls it is for them to applye their hearts to loue any vertues: bee it Cenſour that iudgeth, or Senatour that ordaineth, or Emperor that commaundeth, or Conſul that executeth, or Oratour that preacheth.
                     No mortall man, take hee neuer ſo good heede to his workes, nor reaſon ſo well in his deſires, but that hee deſerueth ſome chaſtiſement, for ſome cauſe, or counſell in his doings. And ſith I haue written vnto thee thus of

others. I will ſomewhat ſpeake of my ſelfe, becauſe of the words of thy letter. I haue gathered that thou deſireſt to know of my perſon.
                     Know thou for certaine, that in the Kalends of Ianuary, I was made Cenſor in the Senate, the which office I deſired not, nor I haue deſerued it.
                     The opinion of all wiſe men is, that no man without he lacke wit, or ſurmounteth in folly, will gladly take on him the burthen and charges of other men. A greater cauſe it is for a ſhamefaſt man to take on him an office to pleaſe euery man: for hee muſt ſhew acountenance outward, contrary to that hee thinketh inward. Thou wilt ſay, that the good are ordained for to take the charge of offices. O vnhappie Rome, that hath willed to take mee in ſuch wiſe, as to be the beſt in it. Grieuous peſtilence ought to come for them that be good, ſith I am eſcaped as good among the euill, I haue accepted this office, not for that I had neede thereof, but to fulfill the commaundement of Antoninus my Grandfather. Haue no maruell of any thing that I doe, but of that I leaue to bee done: For euery man that is wedded to Fauſtine, there is no villany but he ſhall doe it,
                     I ſweare to thee, that ſith the day wee were wedded, me ſeemeth that I haue no wit. I leaue wedding for this time, and returne to ſpeake of offices: Surely, a peaceable man ought to bee in offices, though it be painefull: for as the offices are aſſured among them that bee vertuous, ſo perillouſly goeth the vertuous folke among Offices: And for the truth hereof reckon what they winne, and then thou ſhalt ſee what they loſe. Say that is good, if thou knoweſt it, and heare the euill, if thou deſire to know it.
                     Hee that will take the charge for to gouerne other, ſeeketh thought and trouble for himſelfe, enuie for his neighbours, ſpurres for his enemies, pouerty for his riches, a waking for theeues, perill for his body, end of his dayes, and torment for his great renowne.
                     Finally, hee ſeeketh a way to reiect his friends, and a repeale to recouer his enemies. O vnhappy man is hee, that taketh on him the charge of children of many mothers, for he ſhall bee alwayes charged with thoughtes, how he ſhould content them all: full of ſighes, becauſe one hath to giue him: feare that one ſhould take from him, weeping if he loſe, and feare that they infame him, Hee that knoweth this, without long tarrying ought to ſet a bridle in his head. But I ſay of one as I ſay of another: For I will ſweare, and thou wilt not deny it, that wee may finde ſome now a dayes that had rather bee in the parke to fight againſt the bulles, then be in ſurety vpon the Scaffold,
                     Oſtentimes I haue heard ſay: Go wee to the Theaters to runne at the Buls: Goe wee to chaſe the Harts &amp; wilde Bores: and when they come thither they runne away, not the beaſtes from them, but they from the beaſts, In ſuch wiſe as they went running, they returne againe flying. I ſay, theſe ambitious perſons procure for to gouerne, and are gouerned: they commaund, and are commaunded, they rule and are ruled: And finally, thinking to haue diuers vnder their hands, theſe wretches put themſelues vnder euery mans foote. For the remedy of all theſe perils, my thoughtes are comforted with one thing, and that is, without procuring or offering my ſelfe, he Senate of their own Will hath commaunded mee. In the eight Table of our auncient laws by theſe Wordes. Wee commaund that in our ſacred Senate, Charge of iuſtice bee neuer giuen to him that willinglie offereth him ſelfe

to it, but to ſuch as by great deliberation are choſen. This is certainely a iuſt Law: for men be now not ſo vertuous, not ſo louing to the Common wealth, that they will forget their own quietnes and reſt, doing damage to themſelues, to procure another mans profite.
                     There is none ſo fooliſh that will leaue his wife, children, and his owne ſweet Countrey, to gee into ſtraunge Countries: but if hee ſee himſelfe among ſtrange people, thinking vnder the colour of iuſtice to ſeeke for his owne vtility. I ſay not this without weeping, that the Princes with their ſmall ſtudy and thought, and the Iudges with their couetouſneſſe, haue vndermined and ſhaken downe the high wals of the policie of Rome.
                     O my friend Catullus, what wilt thou that I ſhall ſay, but that our credence ſo diminiſheth, our couetouſneſſe ſo largely ſtretcheth, our hardineſſe ſo boldneth, our ſhamefaſtneſſe ſo ſhameleſſe, that wee prouide for Iudges to go and rob our neighbours, as Captaines againſt our enemies: I let thee to know, where as Rome was beloued for chaſtiſing the euill, now it is as much hated for ſpoiling the good. I doe remember that I reade in the time of Dennis Siracuſan, that ruleth all Scicill, there came an Ambaſſadour from Rhodes to Rome, being of a good age, wel learned, and valiaunt in armes, and right curious to note all things.
                     He came to Rome to ſee the Maieſty of the ſacred Senate, the height of the high Capitoll, enuironed with the Colliſet: the multitude of Senators, the wiſedome of the Counſellors, the glory of triumphes, the correction of the euill, the peace of the inhabitants, the diuerſity of Nations, the aboundance of the mantenance, the order of the offices: And finally, ſeeing that Rome was Rome, hee was demaunded how hee thought thereby? He anſwered, and ſayde; O Rome, at this preſent world thou art ful of vertuous and wiſe men, hereafter thou ſhalt bee furniſhed with fooles.
                     Loe what high and very high words were theſe: Rome was ſeuen hundred yeares without any houſe of fooles, and now it hath beene three hundred yeares without any wiſe or vertuous man. Looke what I ſay, it is no mockery, but of truth, if the pittifull Gods now a dayes did raiſe our predeceſſors from death to life, eyther they would not know vs for their children, or elſe they would attach vs for fooles.
                     Theſe be things vſed in Rome, but thou ſendeſt no word of that is vſed in Agripine. I will write nothing vnto thee to put thee to paine: write to me ſome thing to reioyce me, if thy wi

                     CHAP. VII. Marcus Aurelius writeth to the amorous Ladies of Rome.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArk Orator, reading in Rhodes the art of humanity, to you amorous Ladies of Rome, wiſheth health to your perſons, and amendmēt of your deſired liues. It was written to mee that at the Feaſt of the mother Berecinthia, all you being preſent together, made a play of mee, in which you layed my life for an example, and ſlaundred my Renowne. It is tolde mee that Auilina compoſed it, Lucia Fuluia wrote it, and thou Toringua did ſing it, and you altogether into the Theater did preſent it.
                     You brought mee forth painted in ſundry formes, with a booke in my hand turned contrary, as a fained Philoſopher, with a long tongue, as a bold ſpeaker without meaſure: with a horn in my head as a common Cuckolde, with a nettle in my hand, as a trembling louer, with a banner fallen down as a coward Captaine: with my beard halfe ſhauen, as a feminate man, with a cloth before my eyes as a condemned foole: and yet not content with this, another day yee brought mee foorth portracted with another new deuiſe: Yee made a figure of mine, with feete of ſtraw, the legges of amber, the knees of wood, the thighes of braſſe, the belly of horne, the armes of pitch, the hands of mace, the head of yron: the eares of an Aſſe, the eyes of a Serpent, the heares of rootes

                        agged, the teeth of a catte, the tongue of a Scorpion, and the forehead of lead in which was writtē in two lines theſe letters, M. N. S. N. I. S. V. S. which in my opinion ſignifieth thus: This picture hath not ſo many mettals as his life hath changes.
                     This done, yee went to the riuer and tyed it with the head downwarde a whole day, and if it had not beene, for the good Lady Meſſelyne, I thinke it had beene tyed there till now.
                     And now yee amorous Ladies, haue written mee a Letter by Fuluius Fabritius, which grieued me nothing but as an amorous man from the handes of Ladies I accept it as a mockery.
                     And to the end I ſhould haue no leyſure to thinke thereon, yee ſent to demaund a queſtion of me, that is, if I haue found in my bookes, of what, for what, from whence, when, for whom, and how women were firſt made.
                     Becauſe my condition is for to take mockes for mockes, and ſith you doe deſire it, I will ſhew it vnto you. Your friendes and mine haue written to mee, but eſpecially your Ambaſſador Fuluius hath inſtantly required mee ſo to doe. I am agrieued with nothing, and will hold my peace, ſauing to your letter onely I will make aunſwere.
                     And ſith there hath been none to aske the queſtion, I proteſt to none but to you, amorous Ladies of Rome, I ſend my aunſwere. And if an honeſt Lady will take the demaund of you, it is a token that ſhee doth enuie the office that yee bee of. For of a truth, that Lady which ſheweth her ſelfe annoyed with your paine openly, from henceforth I condemne her that ſhee hath ſome fault in ſecrete: They that bee on the Stage, feare not the roaring of the Bull: they that bee in the Dungeon feare not the ſhot of the Canon.
                     
                        
I will ſay the woman of good life, feareth no mans ſlaunderous tongue, The good Matrons may keepe mee for their perpetuall ſeruant, and the euill for their chiefe enemie. I aunſwere.
                     It is expedient you know of what the firſt women were made. I ſay that according to the diuerſities of Nations that are in the world, I find diuers opinions in this caſe.
                     The Egyptians ſay, that when the tiuer Nilus brake, and ouerranne the earth, there abode certaine peeces of earth which cleaued together, and the Sunne comming to them, created many wilde beaſts, amongſt whom, was found the firſt woman. Note Ladies, it was neceſſary, that the floude Nilus ſhould breake out: ſo that the firſt woman might bee made of earth.
                     All creatures are nouriſhed, and bred in the entrailes of their mothers: except the Woman which was bredd without a mother. And it ſeemeth moſt true, that without mothers you were borne: for without rule yee liue, and with order yee die.
                     Truely hee that taketh vpon him a great thing, &amp; hath many cares in his minde, much to muſe vpon, needeth much counſell, needeth long experience, and ought to chuſe amongſt many women, that thinketh to rule the onely wife by reaſon.
                     Bee the beaſts neuer ſo wilde, at length the Lion is ruled by his keeper, the Bull is encloſed in his Parke, the Horſe ruled by the bridell, the little hooke catcheth the fiſh, the Oxe contented to yeelde to the yoake: onelie a woman is a beaſt, which will neuer bee tamed, ſhe neuer loſeth her boldneſſe of commaunding, nor by any bridle will bee commaunded, The Gods haue made men as men, and beaſts as beaſts, and mans vnderſtanding very high, and his ſtrength of great force: yet there is nothing, be it of neuer ſo great ſtrength and power that can eſcape a woman, eyther with ſleight or might.
                     But I ſay vnto you amourous Ladies, there is neyther ſpurre can make you goe, reine that can holde you backe, bridle that can refrayne you, neyther fiſh-hooke, nor Nette that can take you: and to conclude, there is no Law can ſubdue you, nor ſhame reſtraine you, nor feare abaſh you, nor chaſticement can amende you.
                     O to what great perill and danger putteth bee himſelfe vnto, that thinketh to rule and correct you: For if you take an opinion, the whole world cannot remoue: who warneth you of any thing, yee neuer beleeue him. If they giue you good counſell, you take it not: if one threaten you, you ſtraight complaine. If one pray you, then are you proude: if they reioyce not in you, then are you ſpitefull: If one doe forbeare you, then are you bolde, if one chaſtice you, ſtraight you become ſerpents.
                     Finally, a Woman will neuer forget an iniury, not bee thankefull for a benefite receyued. Now a dayes the moſt ſimpleſt of all Women will ſweare that they doe know leſſe then they doe: But I doe ſweare, which of them that knoweth leaſt, knoweth more euill then all men: and of a truth the wiſeſt man ſhall faile in their wiſedome.
                     Will yee know my Ladies, how little you vnderſtand, and how much you bee ignorant? that is in maters of great importance yee determine raſhly, as if you had ſtudyed on it a thouſand yeares: if any reſiſt your counſell, you holde him for a mortall enemie: Hardie is that woman that dare giue counſell to a a man, and hee more bolde that taketh it of a woman: but I returne and ſay, that

hee is a foole which taketh it, and hee is a foole that asketh it, but he is moſt foole that fulfilleth it.
                     My opinion is, that he which wil not ſtūble amongſt ſuch hard ſtones, nor pricke himſelfe amongſt ſuch thorns; nor ſting him with ſo many Nettles: let him harken what I ſay, and doe as he ſhal ſee, ſpeak well, and worke euill. In promiſing, avow much: but in performing, accompliſh little. Finally allow your words, and condemne your counſells.
                     If wee could demaund of famous men which are dead, how they liked in their life time the counſells of Women? I am ſure they would not riſe againe to belieue them, nor to be reuiued to heare them.
                     How was that famous King Philip with Olympia, Paris with Helene, Alexander with Roſana, Aeneas with Dido, Hercules with Deyanira, Hannibal with Tamira, Antonie with Cleopatra, Iulius with Domitian, Nero with Agrippina? And if you will belieue what they ſuffered with them, aske of me vnhappie man what I ſuffer amongſt you?
                     Oh ye Women, when I remember that I was borne of you, I loathe my mylife: and thinking how I liue with you, I wiſh and deſire my death. For there is no ſuch death or torment, as to haue to doe with you: and on the contrarie, no ſuch life, as to flye away from you.
                     It is a common ſaying among Women, that men be very vnthankfull, becauſe we were bred in your entrailes: Wee order you as ſeruants. Ye ſay for that ye brought vs forth with perill, &amp; nouriſhed vs with trauell, it is reaſon that wee ſhould alwayes employ vs to ſerue you. I haue bethoght me diuers times with my ſelfe, from whence the deſires that man hath vnto Women commeth?
                     There are no Eyes, but ought to weepe, no heart but ſhould breake, nor ſpirite but ought to waile, to ſee a wiſe man loſt by a fooliſh woman.
                     The fooliſh Louer paſſeth the day time to content his eye, and the darknight hee ſpendeth in tormenting of himſelfe with fond thoughts: one day in hearing tydings another day in doing ſeruices.
                     Sometimes in liking the darkeneſſe, and ſomtimes in loathing of the light, being in company, and ſolitary liueth: And finally, the poore Louer may that he will not, and would that he may not.
                     Moreouer, the counſel of his friends auayleth him nothing, nor the infamy of his enemies, not the loſſe of goods, and the aduenture of honour, the looſing of his life, nor the ſeeking of his death, neyther comming neer, nor flying farre, nor ſeeing with his eyes, nor hearing with his eares, nor taſting with his mouth, nor feeling with his hand: and to conclude, to get victorie, hee is alwayes at ſtrife and warre with himſelfe. Then I would ye louers knew, from whence your Loue doeth come, it is thus:
                     The entrailes whereof we are bredde be Fleſh, the breaſts that we ſucked are fleſh, the armes wherein we be faſtued bee of fleſh, the thoughtes which wee thinke be fleſhly, the works which wee doe are fleſhly, the men with whom wee liue are of fleſh, and the wonder for whom we dye are fleſh.
                     By which occaſion commeth, the reuerting of our fleſh to fleſh, manie free hearted are entangled with theſe ſnares of Loue.
                     
                     It ſeemeth well (my Ladyes) that yee were engendred in puddles, as before is mentioned of the Egyptians: the puddles haue no cleare waters to drinke, nor fruite to bee eaten, nor Fiſh to bee taken, nor yet ſhippe to ſayle in.
                     My meaning is, that in your liues ye be filthy, and your perſons without

ſhame in aduerſity, weake and feeble in proſperity, full of deceit and guile, falſe in your words, and deceitfull in your doings, in hating without meaſure, in loue extreame, in giftes couetous, in taking vnſhamefaſt: and finally, I ſay yee are the ground of feare, in whom the Wiſe men finde perill, and the ſimple men ſuffer iniury.
                     In you, the wiſe men holde theyr renowne ſlaundered, and the ſimple men their life in penury. Let vs omit the opinion of the Egyptians, and come to the Greekes, which ſay, that in the deſerts of Arabia, the Sunne ſhineth hoteſt: and at the beginning there was found one Woman, with one birde called the Phenix, which birde was created on the Water, and the woman engendered by the great heat of the Sunne, and of the powder of trees in this wiſe.
                     There was a tree ſore eaten with wormes, and vpon a time a blaſt of Lightning ſet it on fire, and burnt it: ſo as among the aſhes of that rotten tree, the firſt woman was made and found.
                     Although I bee a Romane Philoſopher, yet can I not diſallow the opinion of the Greeke Philoſopher. Of a truth 'ye amorous Dames, you haue your tongues of the nature of fire, and your conditions like the powder of a rotten tree.
                     According to the diuerſity of Beaſts, ſo Nature hath in diuers parts of the body placed their ſtrength: as the Eagle in her byll: the Vnicorne in the horne, the Serpent in the tayle: the Bull in the head, the Beare in his pawes, the horſe in the breaſt, the dog in the teeth, the Bore in the tuske: the Doues in the winges, and the women in their tongues. For of a truth, the flight of their loue is not ſo high, as the fantaſie of your fooliſhneſſe is vaine: the catte ſcratcheth not ſo ſore with her nayles, as yee doe ſcratch the fooliſh men with your importunities.
                     The dogge hurteth him not ſo much that hee runneth after, as ye do the ſorrowful Louer that ſerueth you: the life of him is not in ſo much danger that catcheth the Bul by the horns as is the fame of him that falleth into your hands.
                     To conclude, the Serpent hath not ſo much poyſon in his tayle, as ye haue in your tongues. I accept the Romane Ladies apart, for there are many very noble, whoſe liues are not touched with complaint, nor good fames had in ſuſpect. Of ſuch, neyther my Letter ſpeaketh ought, nor my penne writeth: but of thoſe women I ſpeake that bee ſuch, as all the venemous beaſts in the world haue not ſo much poiſon in their bodies, as one of thoſe haue in their tongues. And ſith the Gods haue commaunded, and our fate doth permit, that the life of men cannot paſſe without women: I aduiſe the youth, and beſeech the aged: I wake the wiſe, and inſtruct the ſimple, to ſhunne women of euill name, more then the common peſtilence. Reading the auncient Lawes of Plato, I finde written this. We command that all women openly defamed, bee openly baniſhed the City, to the entent that others ſeeing the ſinne puniſhed, may abhorre the ſame, for feare to fall in the like paine. The ſame Law ſayde further, Wee commaund that they pardon a woman for all her faults ſhee committeth boldly, in caſe yee ſee amendment likewiſe in her: but wee will that no fault bee pardoned, committed by the tong, For actuall ſinne done, is the frailety of nature, the tongue onely of malice. O diuine Plato, Maſter, and meaſure of all knowledge and ſcience, and prince of all philoſophers: when thou in the golden world madeſt ſuch

Lawes: In which time there was ſuch ſcarcitie of thoſe women which were euill, and ſo great plentie of them that were good: In this caſe what ſhould wee doe now in Rome, where there bee ſo many euill openly, and none good in ſecret?
                     Women ought naturally to bee ſhamefaſt in their face, temperate in their words, wiſe of wit, ſober in their going, honeſt in their conuerſation, pittifull in their correction, warie in their liuing, auoyding companies, faithfull in their promiſes, conſtant in their loue.
                     Finally, ſhee that will be counted honeſt, let her not truſt to the wiſedome of the Worldly-pretended-wiſe: nor commit her Fame vnto the wanton youth: Let euery wiſe woman take heede what hee is that promiſeth her ought. For after the flames of Venus be ſet on fire, and Cupid ſhotte his arrowes, the Rich offereth all that hee hath, and the poore all that hee may. The wiſe man will euer be her friend, and the ſimple-man, for euer her ſeruant.
                     The wiſe man wil loſe his life for her, and the ſimple will accept his death for her. The old men ſay, they will be friends to their friends: and the yong men will ſay, he wil be enemy to theyr enemyes. The aged promiſing to pay her debts, the other to reuenge her jniuries. Finally, the one becauſe to hide their pouerty, and the other to publiſh their beautie, leade theſe fooles loſing their liues, and bringing their fame to ende. I will leaue to ſpeake of the good Women, for I minde not to charge them with ought.
                     I aske you amorous Ladyes, if Plato was amongſt you, when ye made a play of my life, and drewe my picture about Rome? No ſurely, for that I ſee in your acte now: I doe ſuſpect that to be true, which hath been ſaide of others, for there are fewe in Rome that execute the paines of Platoes Law.
                     One thing yee cannot denie: if I were the worſt of all men, at the laſt ye ſee the end of my tranſgreſſing: but this you cannot denie, that ſhe which is leaſt euill of all you, the naughtines of her life, I could not ſufficiently ſet out in my life.
                     It is great perill to wiſe women to be neighboured with fooles, it is great perill to the ſhamefaſt to bee with the ſhameles: it is great perill to the chaſt to be with the adulterers: great perill it is for the honourable to be with the defamed: For there is no ſlaundered woman but thinketh euery one defamed, or at the leaſt is deſirous to haue them ſo, procureth to haue them ſlaundered, or ſaith they bee infamed. And in the end to hide their infamie, they ſlaunder all the good.
                     It is long ſith I knewe you amorous Ladyes, and you mee. If I ſpeake, I ſpeake: if you knowe, I knowe. If yee holde your peace, I am ſtill: if ye ſpeake openly, I will not talke in ſecrete.
                     Thou knoweſt well Auilina, thou diddeſt compaſſe the ieaſt of mee, that Eumedes ſolde Calues de
                           •
                        rer in the Butchery, then thou diddeſt innocent Virgines in thy houſe.
                     And thou Toringa knoweſt well, that before mee thou couldeſt not recount all thy Louers on thy fingers, but diddeſt deſire to haue a buſhell of peaſon.
                     Thou knoweſt well Lyuia Fuluia, when thou wert (thou knoweſt with whom) at Bretus, we made agreement with thy husband, thou tookeſt him aſide and ſayedſt: Vnles I may lye out of my houſe one Night in a weeke, thou ſhalt not lie quietly in thy houſe: Thou knoweſt well Rotoria, that in thy youth thou werte two yeares on the Sea, and diddeſt compound with the pirate, that no woman ſhold ſerue the 100. ſoldiers, but thou alone in a gally.
                     
                        
Thou knoweſt right wel Enna Curtia that when the Cenſor came to take thee, hee found v. mens apparrell, the which thou wareſt in the night ſeaſon and but one womans attire, wherewith thou wert clothed in the dayetime.
                     Thou knoweſt well Peſilana Fabricia, that Alluines, Metelles, and thou beeing married, demaunded openly what thou haddeſt gotten in his houſe with thy friendes in ſecret: Thou knoweſt well Camilla, not being content with thy owne Countrey folke, thou haddeſt ſuch reſorte and haunt of ſtrangers to thee, that thou canſt ſpeake all languages.
                     I will marke them that haue marked mee, hurt them that haue hurted mee, perſecute them that haue perſecuted mee, defame them that haue ſlaundered mee, all other my penne pardoneth, for that they pardoned me in their play. Becauſe my letter begunne with that ye did to my perſon: therefore I will end it, with that it knoweth of your good names.
                     And thus I conclude, that a man may eſcape from all dangers in ſhunning them: but from women, there is no way but to flye from them.
                     Thus I end, and beſeech the gods that I may ſee of you that which you would ſee of mee: and ſith yee bee louers, I counſell you, as you haue ſent mee the play in a mockery, euen ſo receyue my aunſwere.
                     
                        Marke now the Rhodian, to the amorous Ladies of Rome.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VIII. Of a Letter ſent by Marcus Aurelius to his loue Boemia, for that ſhee deſired to goe with him to the warres.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArcus the Romane Pretor, beeing in the warres of Dacia, ſendeth health to his louing Boemia, remayning in the pleaſures of Rome. Eſcaping from a cruell battell, thy fewe lines I read and vnderſtood thy large information. I let thee know thou haſt aſtonied me more, then mine enemies haue feared me, and taking thy letter in my hands, the herbe of malice entred into my heart. When I temper my body with the delights, I thinke my heart free from the venome of thy amours: ſith I of my will, and thou for want of power hath giuen vs to bee free of our pleaſures. I thinke as well to make a diuorce of our ſorrowes: But yee bee ſuch, yea ſuch I ſay, as are the baniſhments of loue, and the treaſure of griefes.
                     The loue of you all ought to bee digeſted with pilles, but the paſſion of one of you will not bee oppreſſed, with all the rubarbe in Alexandria, Yee ſhew your ſelues cruell to pardon an enemie, and euer lightly you change your friendes. I haue curiouſly made ſearch, whileſt delight gouerned my youth: yet could I neuer ſee in a woman ſtedfaſtneſſe, nor reaſon in their loue, nor end in their hate. The preſent wantonneſſe quarrelleth with my youth paſſed, becauſe thou ſeeſt not in me the auncient good will towardes thee, nor the preſent ſeruice.
                     And certainely hearing thy accuſation,

and not my iuſtification: thou mighteſt pay me as iuſtly with death, as I pay thee with forgetfulneſſe: The which forgetfulneſſe ought to bee as ſtraunge in him that ſerueth, as ingratitude in the Lady that is ſerued: thinkeſt thou that I haue forgotten the law of Venus? when I commaunded that the curious Louers ſhould exerciſe their ſtrength in chiualry, and occupy their hearts in loue? and more it willeth a man to weare his clothes cleanly, their feet right, their bodies conſtant, their voyce ſoft and humble, demure and modeſt of cheare: they ought to haue eyes open, alwayes looking vp to the Windowes, and their hearts ready to flye into the aire: For a truth, my friend Boemia, hee is a groſſe louer that hath his will in captiuity, and his iudgment free. The iudgment is of no value, where the will is in thraldome. This I ſay, that thou mayeſt know, though my age hath left the exerciſe: yet my vnderſtanding hath not forgot the art: Thou complayneſt becauſe I giue my ſelfe vnto much quiet, and that I haue forgotten thee. I will not deny the truth, the day of my forgetting maketh thee priuie of my thoughts.
                     And reaſon the Ouerſeer declareth that it is not requiſite for my grauitie to permit I ſhould loue: nor in thy age to ſuffer to be beloued. The world doth diſſemble many things in youth: which in age meriteth grieuous corrections. The wanton toyes of youth proceed of ignorance, but the villanies done in age grow of malice.
                     When I walked in the nights, I ietted the ſtreetes, I ſang ballades, I gazed to the Windowes: I played on the Gitiornes: I ſcaled the walles: I wakened the youth.
                     Thinkeſt thou that I win what I did in my youth? but ſithence I ſee my ſelfe bereaued of all my wonted wanton toyes, and poliſhed with ſo many white hayres, cladde with ſo many ſorrowes: eyther I thinke now I was not then, or elſe I dreame now, not knowing the way I ſtray in, nor ſeeing that ſtony way ready to ſtumble in.
                     Vnwittingly I haue fallen into the ſtayres, not foreſeeing the Whirlepoole: guideleſſe I entred, in the raſhneſſe of my youth I loſt mee: for the which I aske pardon. And nowe that I am out of the bryers, thou woldeſt haue me further in, then euer I was.
                     Now that I cannot take the purgations, thou offereſt to mee the ſirropes. I haue awaked all night, and now thou giueſt me a freſh alarum. By our auncient friendſhippe I pray thee, and by the Gods I coniure thee, that ſithence my heart is rebell to thy will, that thy doubtfull will doe ſuffer, and let alone my will out of doubt. And becauſe thou ſhouldeſt not thinke any ingratitude in my white hayres, as I may in thy young wanton perſon. I will that wee account that wee haue gotten, and that wee hope to get. Tell mee what commeth of theſe vaine pleaſures? the time euill ſpent, the fame in way of perdition, the goods conſumed, the credite loſt, the gods offended, the vertuous ſlaundered: from whence wee gette the names of bruit beaſts, and ſurnames of ſhame: Such bee yee and others.
                     Thou writeſt in thy Letter, how thou wouldeſt willingly leaue Rome, &amp; come to ſee mee in the Warres of Dacia.
                     
                     Conſidering thy folly, I laugh, but knowing thy boldneſſe I beleeue thee. And when I thinke on this I turne to my boſome, and peruſe thy ſeale: doubting whether the Letter were thine or not. The veines of my heart doe chaunge, my colour doth turne, imagining that eyther ſhame hath vtterly forſaken thee, or els grauitie

hath wholly abandoned mee: for ſuch lightnes ſhould not be beleeued, but of the like perſons.
                     Thou knoweſt well he that doth euil, deſerueth puniſhment ſooner then hee that doth infamy. I would aske thee whether thou wilt goe? thou ſufferedſt to be cut as a ſower grape, and now thou wouldeſt bee ſold for good wine? thou cameſt in with Cheries and yet wouldeſt remaine as quinces. Wee haue eaten thee in bloſſomes, and thou wilt bee like the fruite? the nuttes bee pleaſant, but the ſhelles bee hard. By dung thou wert made ripe in thy youth, and thou thinkeſt to bee in ſtill. Thou art nought elſe but rotten. And if thou bee rotten, thou art to bee abhorred. Thou art not content with forty yeares which thou haſt whereof 25. thou diddeſt paſſe in taſte, like to ſweet wine that is ſolde, or like the Melons that bee ripe and mellow.
                     Art not thou that Boemia which lacketh two teeth before? are not thine eyes ſunken into thy head? thy hayres whiter, the fleſh wrinckled, and thy hand periſhed with the gowt, and one rib marred with child-bearing? Whether doeſt thou deſire to goe? put thy ſelfe then in a barrell, and caſt it into the Riuer, ſo ſhalt thou become pure and white.
                     Wee haue eaten the freſh fiſh, and now thou wouldeſt bring hither the ſtinking ſalt fiſh. O Boemia, Boemia, in this caſe I ſee no truſt in youth, nor hope in age: For vnder this thy hored age there is hid the pangues of frayle youth. Thou complaineſt that thou haſt nothing: it is an old quarrel of the auncient amorous Ladyes in Rome, that taking all thinges, they ſay they haue left them nothing. The cauſe thereofis, where you do lacke credite, there you would haue it accompliſhed with money.
                     Beleeue me louing friend, the fooliſh eſtate of vnlawfull gaming, both giueth an vnſure eſtate, and alſo an euill fame to the perſon. I know not how thou art ſo waſtfull, for if I pulled off my rings with the one hand, thou pickedſt my purſe with the other: greater wars haddeſt thou then with my Coffers, then I haue now with my enemies.
                     I neuer had iewell, but thou demaundedſt it of mee, and thou neuer askedſt mee thing that I denyed thee I finde and bewaile now in my age the high parts of my youth. Of trauell &amp; pouerty thou complaineſt, I am hee that hath great neede of the medicine for this opilation, and playſters for the ſonne, and colde water for ſuch a burning feuer.
                     Doeſt thou not well remember, how I did baniſh my neceſſity into the land of forgetfulneſſe, and placed thy good wil for the requeſt of my ſeruice? in the winter I went naked, and in the ſommer loaded with clothes. In the mire I went on foot, and rode in the fayre way. When I was ſad I laught, when I was glad I wept. Being afraid I drew out my ſtrength, and out of ſtrength cowardnes. The night with ſighes, and dayes in wayling I conſumed.
                     When thou haddeſt neede of any thing, I robbed my father for it. Tell mee Boemia, with whom diddeſt thou ſulfill thine open follyes, but with the miſorders that I did in ſecret? Thinke you what I thinke of the amorous Ladies in Rome: that yee be mothes in olde garments, a paſtime for light perſons, a treaſure of fooles, and the ſepulchres of vices. This that ſeemeth to mee is, that in thy youth euery man gaue to thee, for that thou ſhouldeſt giue to euery one? now thou giueſt thy ſelfe to euery man, becauſe euery one ſhould giue them to thee. Thou telleſt mee that thou haſt two ſonnes and lackeſt helpe for them.
                     
                        
Giue thanks to the gods for the mercy they ſhewed thee. To xv. Children of Fabritius my neighbour, they gaue but one Father: and to thine onely two ſonnes, they haue giuen fifteene Fathers. Wherefore diuide them to their Fathers, and euery one ſhall bee well prouided for. Lucia thy daughter indeed, and mine by ſuſpect, remember that I haue done more in marrying of her, then thou diddeſt in bringing her forth: For in the getting of her, thou calledſt many: but to marry her, I did it alone. Verie little I write thee, in reſpect of that I would write.
                     
                        Butrio Cornely hath ſpoken much to mee on thy behalfe, and hee ſhall ſay as much to thee on my part. It is long agoe ſithence I knew thy impatience: I know well thou wilt ſende mee another more malitious.
                     
                        I pray thee, ſince I write to thee in ſecrete, diſcouer mee not openly: and when thou readeſt this, remember what occaſion thou haſt giuen me to write thus.
                     Although wee bee fallen out, yet I will ſend thee money. I ſend thee a gowne, and the Gods bee with thee Boemia, and ſend mee from this war with peace.

                     CHAP. IX. The aunſwere of Boemia, to the Emperour Marcus Aurelius, wherein is expreſſed the great malice, and litle patience of an euill woman.
                     
                     
                        
                           BOemia thy auncient Louer, to thee Mark of Mount Celio her naturall enemie, deſireth vengeance of thy perſon, and euill fortune during thy life I haue receyued thy letter, and thereby perceyue thy ſpitefull intents, and thy cruell malices. Such naughty perſons as thou art, haue this priuiledge, that ſith one doth ſuffer your villanies in ſecret, you will hurt them openly: but thou ſhalt not doe ſo with mee Marke, Althogh I am not treaſureſſe of thy good: yet at the leaſt I am of thy naughtineſſe: All that I cannot reuenge with my perſon, I will not ſpare to doe it with my tongue. And though we women for weakeneſſe ſake, are eaſily ouercome in perſon, yet know thou that our hearts are inuincible.
                     Thou ſayeſt, eſcaping from a battell, thou receyuedſt my Letter, wherof thou waſt ſore agaſt. It is a common thing to them that be ſlothful to ſpeak of loue, for fooles to treate of bookes, and for Cowards to blaze of Armes: I ſay it becauſe the aunſwere of a Letter was not needfull, to rehearſe to a woman whether it was before the battell, or after. I thinke well thou haſt eſcaped it, for thou wert not the firſt that fought, nor the laſt that fled. I neuer ſaw thee goe to the iwarre in thy youth, that euer I was fearefull of thy life: for knowing thy cowardlineſſe, I neuer tooke care for thy abſence, I

alwayes iudged thy perſon ſafe. Then tell mee Marke, what doeſt thou now in thy age? I thinke thou carrieſt thy lance, not to ſerue thy turne in thy warre, but to leane on, when the gout taketh thee. The head-peece, I iudge thou haſt not to defend thee from the ſtrokes of ſwords, but to drinke withall in tauernes.
                     I neuer ſaw thee ſtrike any man with thy ſword, but I haue ſeene thee kill a thouſand women with thy tong. O malitious Marke, if thou wert as valiant as thou art ſpitefull, thou ſhouldeſt be no leſſe feared among the barbarous nations then thou art abhorred (with good reaſon) amongſt the Romanes. Tell me what thou liſt, but thou canſt not deny? but both thou haſt beene, and art a ſlacke louer, a cowardly knight, an vnknown friend auaricious, infamed, an enemy to all men, and friend to none.
                     Moreouer, wee knew thee a light young man, condemne thee now for an olde doting foole. Thou ſayeſt that taking my letter into thy hands, forthwith thy heart receyued the hearbe of malice.
                     I beleeue thee well vnſworne: for any thing touching malice, dooth ſtraight finde harbour in thy breſt: the beaſts corrupted do take poyſō, which the ſound, and of good complexion refufeth, Of one thing I am ſure, thou ſhalt not dye of poyſon: For ſeldom times one poyſon hurteth another: but it driueth out the other. O malicious Marke, if all they in Rome knew thee, as well as the vnhappy Boemia doth: they ſhould ſee how much the wordes that thou ſpeakeſt, differ from the intention of thy hart. And as by the bookes thou makeſt, thou meriteſt the name of a Philoſopher, euen ſo, for the ilneſſe thou inuenteſt, thou doeſt deſerue the name of a Tirant. Thou ſayeſt, thou neuer ſaweſt conſtancy in a Womans loue, nor end in her hate. I ioy not a little, that other Ladies in Rome as well as I, doe know thy ſmall wiſedome.
                     Behold Marke, I will not mocke thee: for thou art ſuch a one as neuer deſerued that one ſhould beginne to loue, nor end to hate. Wilt thou haue ſtability in loue, and thou vnthankfull of thy ſeruice, wilt thou ſerue in mockerie, and be beloued faithfully? wilte thou enioy the perſon without ſpending any of thy goods? wilt thou haue no complaints on thee, and thou ceaſeſt not thy malice?: Thou knoweſt the il of women: I will that thou know, that wee bee not ſo fooliſh as yee ſuppoſe vs to be: nor thou ſo wiſe, as thou prayſeſt thy ſelfe to be.
                     Hitherto we haue ſeen more men follow the deſire of women, then women haue liked to follow men. I haue ſeene a thouſand times, yea and thou thy ſelfe, that one man hath not ſo mighty a heart as to ouercome three wiſe women, and one woman holdeth her ſelf ſtrong enough to ſubdue three hundred light perſons. Thou ſayeſt thou art aſhamed of my lightneſſe, to ſee mee forſake Rome, and come to thee into the wars.
                     Great is the loue of the Countrey and many leaue much goods which they haue in ſtraunge lands, to liue poorely in their owne: but greater is thy loue, ſith I would leaue Rome with the delights therin, and come to ſeeke thee in ſtrange lands among the rude ſouldiers.
                     O malitious Marke, O ſtraunge friend, if I leaue Rome, it were to goe ſeeke my heart, which is with thee in the warres. And certainly oftentimes when I thinke of thy abſence, I fall into a ſwound, as one that had no hart: but I neuer finde remedy. I thinke our loue is not like to theſe beaſtes, which haue their mindes onely vpon ſenſuall pleaſures, without the conioyning of the louing hearts.
                     
                        
I ſweare to thee by the goddeſſe Veſta, and the mother Berecinthia, that thou oweſt more to me for the loue I haue borne to thee in one day, then for the ſeruice I haue done to thee in 22. yeares▪
                     
                     Behold, vnhappy Marke, how much and dearely I loued thee. In thy preſence I alwayes beheld thee, and abſent I alwayes thought of thee: ſleeping I dreamed on thee, I haue wept for thy ſorrowes, and laught at thy pleaſures: and finally, all my welth I wiſhed thee, and all thy misfortunes I tooke as mine.
                     I aſſure thee of one thing, that I feele not ſo much the perſecution thou haſt done mee, as I doe the wailing forgetfulneſſe thou ſheweſt vnto mee. It is a great griefe to a couetous man to loſe his goods, but without compariſon it is a greater torment for the Louer to ſee his euil beſtowed, It is a hurt that is alwayes ſore, and a paine alwayes painefull, a ſorrow alwayes ſorrowfull, and it is a death that neuer endeth.
                     Oh if men knew how dearely and faithfully women doe loue, when they are bent to loue: and with what malicious hart they hate, being ſet to hate: I ſweare vnto you, yee would neuer companie with them in loue: or if ye did loue them, yee would neuer leaue, for feare of their hate. And as there is neuer great hate, but where there was firſt much loue: euen ſo, thou ſhalt neuer bee greatly hated, for that thou wert neuer truly beloued of the ladies.
                     The ſorrowfull Boemia hath loued thee xxii. yeares of her life: and now ſhee hateth thee till after her death. Thou ſayeſt I may bee eaten for vertiuyce: and yet would be ſold for wine.
                     I knowe I haue erred, as one both young and light: and when I found me to ſtray out of the way, I was too farre gone, and my miſhap could no other way, nor remedie.
                     It is a great loſſe of all loſſes when there is no remedy. I haue offended as a weake and fraile woman, but thou as a man ſtrong. I erred by ſimple ignoraunce, but thou of a purpoſed and wilfull malice. I ſinned not, knowing that I did amiſſe: but thou knoweſt what thou diddeſt.
                     I gaue eare and credite vnto thy words as a faithfull Knight, and thou betrayedſt mee with a thouſand Lyes, and proteſtations, as a common lyer.
                     Tell me, diddeſt not thou ſeeke occaſion to come into my mother Getuliaes houſe, to entice me her daughter Boemia, to thy minde?
                     Diddeſt thou not promiſe my Father, to teach me to read in one yeare: and readdeſt mee Ouide, of the arte of Loue? Diddeſt not thou ſweare to marrie mee, and after withdrewe thy hand as a falſe Adulterer? Diddeſt thou not know that thou neuer foundeſt in my perſon any villanie, nor in thy mouth any trueth?
                     At the leaſt thou canſt not denye, but thou haſt offended the Gods, thou art defamed amongſt men, odious to the Romaines, a ſlaunderer of the good folkes, an Example to the ill, and finally a Traytour to my Father, a breaker of thy faith to my mother, and to me the vnhapy Boemia, an vnkind louer.
                     
                     Oh malicious Marke, haſt thou not cut me in leaues, offering to my father to keepe his vines ſafe? Euill may the chicken truſt the Kyte, or the Lambs the wolfe, or the Doues the Faulcon, but thou art worſe, to bring vppe the daughters of good men.
                     Oh curſed Marke, a hurtfull keeper of vines hath the matrone of Rome foūd thee, in keeping their Daughters. I ſweare, that there was neither grape or cluſter, but it was eyther eaten, or gathered by thee. Thou didſt cut mee greene, for the which I promiſe thee, it hath ſet thy teeth on edge. Thou ſayſt I was riped by power of heat &amp; ſtraw.
                     
                        
It grieueth mee not ſo much that thou ſayeſt it, as that thou giueſt mee occaſion to ſay vnto thee, thy ſhame is ſo ſhameleſſe, and thy euill ſo malicious, that I cannot make aunſwere to thy purpoſe, vnleſſe I rubbe thee on the quicke.
                     I aske thee when thou marryedſt Fauſtine, whether thou foundeſt them green or ripe? thou knoweſt well, and ſo doe I alſo, that others gaged the veſſell and thou drankeſt the Lees: others had the meate, and thou the huskes: others did eate them beeing greene, and with the refuge ſet thy teeth on edge.
                     Oh curſed Marke: beholde how great thy euills are, and how the gods haue iuſtly puniſhed thee: that being young couldſt not deſerue to be beloued 
                           •
                        f thy Zouers: nor yet now in thy Age, thy wife keepe her faith to thee. For me to be reuenged of thy perſon, I need no more but to ſee thee marryed to Fauſtine.
                     
                     By the Mother Berecynthia, I promiſe thee, that if thy ſmall wiſedome might attain to know at the full, what they ſay of thee, and her in Rome: thou wouldeſt weepe both day and night, for the life of Fauſtine, and not leaue the wofull Boemia.
                     
                     Oh Marke, little care is taken for thee, and how farre is our vnderſtanding vncoupled from thy thoughts? For through thy great Learning, thy houſe in the day time is a ſchoole of phyloſophers, and the wantonneſſe of thy wife Fauſtine in the night, maketh it a receyte of Ruffians.
                     It is a iuſt iudgement of the gods, ſith that thy malice onely ſufficeth to poyſon many that bee good, the euilnes only of one woman, ſhalbe enogh to ſpoile &amp; take away thy good renowm,
                     
                     One difference there is betwen thee and me, &amp; thy Fauſtine, which is: that my facts are in ſuſpect, &amp; yours done in deede: mine bee ſecrete, but yours known openly. I haue but ſtumbled, but ye haue fallen. For one only fault I deſerue puniſhment: but you deſerue pardon for none. My diſhonor dyed with my fact, and is buryed with my amendment: but your infamie is borne with your deſires, nouriſhed with your malices, and ſtill with your works. Finally, your infamie ſhall neuer dye, for you liued neuer well.
                     Oh Marke malicious, with all that thou knoweſt: doeſt thou not know that to dye well, doth couer an euill fame, and to make an ende of an euill life, doth beginne a good fame?
                     Thou ceaſeſt not to ſay euill onely of ſuſpect, which thy falſe iudgements giueth: and yet wouldeſt thou wee ſhould conceale that wee ſee with our eyes? Of one thing I am ſure, that neither of thee, nor of Fauſtine, there are, or haue been any falſe witneſſes. For there are ſo many true euils, that there needeth no Lyes to be inuented.
                     Thou ſayeſt it is an olde cuſtome, with the amorous Ladies in Rome, though they take it of many, yet they are the pooreſt of all, becauſe we want credit, we are honoured for ſiluer: It is moſt certaine, that of holly wee looke for prickes, of acornes husks, of netles ſtinging, and of thy mouth malices. I haue ſeriouſly noted: I neuer heard thee ſay well of any, nor I neuer knew any that would thee good.
                     What greater puniſhment can I deſire for thy wickednenes, nor more vengeance for my iniuries, then to ſee al the amorons Ladies of Rome diſcontented with thy ſelfe, and ioy to think on thy death, curſed is the man whoſe life many doe bewayle, and in whoſe death euery one doth reioyce. It is the property of ſuch vnthankefull wretches as thou art to forgette the great good done to them, and to repent the little they giue.
                     How much the noble hearts do reioice in giuing to other: ſo much they

are aſhamed to take ſeruice vnrewarded. For, in giuing they are lords, and in taking they become ſlaues.
                     I aske what it is thou haſt giuen me, or what thou haſt receyued of mee? I haue aduentured my good Fame, and giuen thee poſſeſſion of my perſon: I haue made thee lorde of mee and mine: I baniſhed mee from my countrey, I haue put in peril my life. In recompence of this, thou doeſt detect mee of miſerie. Thou neuer gaueſt mee ought with thy heart, nor I tooke it with good will, nor it euer did me profit.
                     As all things recouer a name, not for the workes wee openly ſee, but for the ſecret intention with which we work: Euen, ſo thou vnhappie man deſireſt mee, not to enioy my perſon, but rather to haue my money.
                     Wee ought not to call thee a cleere Louer, but rather a Theefe, and a wily perſon. I had a little Ring of thine, I minde to throw it into the riuer: and a gowne thou gaueſt me, which I haue burnt. And if I thought my bodie were increaſed with that Bread I did eate of thine: I would cut my fleſh being whole, and let out my bloud without feare.
                     Oh malicious Marke; thy obſcured malice will not ſuffer thee to vnderſtand my cleare letter. For I ſent not vnto thee to aske mony, to relieue my pouertie and ſolitarines: but onely to acknowledge and ſatisfie my willing hart. Such vaine and couetous men as thou, are contented with gifts, but the harts incarnate in loue, are not ſatisfied with a little money.
                     For Zoue is rewarded alwayes with loue. The man that loueth not as a man of reaſon, but like a brute beaſt, and the woman that loueth not where ſhe is beloued, but onely for the gaine of her bodie: Such ought not to bee credited in words, nor their perſonages to be honoured.
                     For the loue of her, ends when their goods faileth, and his loue when her beautie decayeth. If the beautie of my face did procure thy loue, and thy riches onely allured my good will: it is right that wee ſhould not bee called wiſe Louers, but rather fooliſh perſons.
                     O curſed Mark, I neuer loued thee for thy goods, although thou likedſt me for that I was faire. Thou ſayedſt the Gods vſed great pittie on me, to giue me few children, and them manie Fathers, The greateſt fault in women is ſhameleſſe, and the greateſt villany in men is to be euill ſayers.
                     Diuers things ought to bee borne in the weakneſſe of women, which in the wiſedome of men are not permitted. I ſay this, for that I neuer ſaw in thee temperance, to cloke thine owne maliciouſnes, nor wiſdome to ſhadow the debilitie of others. Then I loued with my hart, and now I abhorre thee with all my heart.
                     Thou ſayeſt my Children haue many Fathers: but I ſweare vnto thee, that the children of Fauſtine ſhall not be fatherles although thou dye. And if the Gods as thou ſayeſt haue beene pittifull to my Children, no leſſe art thou vnto ſtraunge children. For Fauſtine keepeth thee but to excuſe her faultes, and to bee tutor to her Children.
                     Oh curſed Marke, thou needeſt not to take thought, for thy children haue no need to be marryed. For one thing wee are bound to thee, that is: the example of thy patience: for ſince thou ſuffereſt Fauſtine in ſo manie open infamyes, it is no great neede wee ſuffer any ſecretes in thee.
                     For this preſent I ſay no more, I ende my Letter, deſiring ſhortly to ſee the ende of thy life.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. X. ¶ Marcus Aurelius writeth to the Ladie Macrine the Romane, of whome, (beholding her at a window) he became enamored. Which declareth what force the beautie of a faire woman hath in weake man.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArke, the verie deſirous, to the Ladie Macrine greatly deſired. I knowe not well whither by euill chaunce, or by hap of my good aduenture: not long agoe I ſaw thee at a window, where thou haddeſt thy arms as cloſe, is I mine Eyes diſplayed, that curſed be they for euer: for, in beholding thy Face, forthwith my heart abode with thee as priſoner. The beginning of thy knowledge, is the ende of my reaſon, and falling in: ſhunning one euil, come infinite trauells vnto men.
                     I ſay it for this, if I had not bin idle, I had not gone out of my houſe: and not gone out of my houſe? I had not paſſed by the ſtreete. And not going through the ſtreet, I had not not ſeen thee at the windowe: and not ſeeing thee at the window, I had not deſired thy perſon, and not deſiring thy perſon, I had not put thy fame in ſo great peril, nor my life in doubt: nor we had giuē no occaſion to Rome to ſpeake of vs. For of truth Lady Macrine, in this caſe I condemne my ſelfe: For very willingly I did behold thee. I did not ſalute thee, thogh thou deſiredſt to be ſeene. Sith thou wert ſet vp as a white, it is no marell though I ſhotte at thee with the arrowes of mine eyes, at the butte of thy beautie, with thy rowling Eyes, with thy browes bent, well coloured Face, incarnate Teeth, ruddie lips, courled hayre, handes ſet with Rings, cloathed with a thouſand manner of colours, hauing purſes full of ſweete ſauours: the Bracelettes, and Eare-rings, full of pearles and precious-ſtones.
                     Tell me what this meaneth? The moſt that I can thinke of this is: ſith you ſhewe vs your bodyes openly, yee would wee ſhould know your deſires in ſecret. And if it be ſo, as I belieue it is: it ſeemeth to me Lady Macrine, thou oughteſt to loue him that liketh thee, to enform him that ſeeketh thee: to aunſwere him that calleth thee: to feele him that feeleth thee: and to vnderſtand him that vnderſtandeth thee: And ſith thou vnderſtandeſt me, I do vnderſtand thee, and vnderſtand that thou knoweſt not.
                     I doe well remember as I went by the ſtreet ſolitarily, to ſee two theeues put to death, mine eyes glauncing ſaw thee at a window: on whom dependeth all my deſires.
                     More iuſtice thou doeſt to mee, then I to the Theeues: For I beeing at iuſtice, thou haſt iuſticed the iuſtice, and none dare payne thee. The gallowes is not ſo cruell to them which neuer knew but doing euill: as thou art to mee, which neuer thought other but onely to ſerue thee.
                     They ſuffer but one death, and thou makeſt mee ſuffer a thouſand: They in one day and one houre ende their liues, and I eache minute doe feele the pangs of death. They dyed guyltie, but I innocently. They died openly, and I in ſecrete.
                     What wilt thou that I ſay more vnto thee? They wept for that they dyed, and I weepe daily teares of bloud from my heart, for that I liue. This is the difference, their torments ſpreadeth abroade through all their bodie, and I keep mine together, in my hart.
                     O cruell Macrine, I know not what iuſtice this is, that they kill men for robbing and ſtealing from manie? and ſuffer women to liue, which ſteale mens hearts?
                     
                        
If they take the liues from them that picke purſes: why then doe they ſuffer Ladyes, which robbe our entrails? By thy Noblenes I pray thee, and by the Goddeſſe Venus I Conjure thee, eyther ſatisfie my deſire, or reſtore me to my heart, which thou haſt robbed from me.
                     I would thou ſhouldſt know Lady Macrine, the cleare intention of my heart, rather then this Letter written with my hand. If my happe were ſo good, as thy Loue would permit me to ſpeak with thee, I would hope by ſight and ſpeech to winne that, which I am in ſuſpect by my Letter to looſe.
                     The reaſon whereof is, becauſe thou ſhalt reade my rude reaſons in this letter, and if thou ſaweſt me, thou ſhouldeſt ſee the bitter teares which I wold offer to thee, in this my vnhappy life.
                     Oh that my mouth could publiſh my cruell paines, as my heart feeleth them. I ſweare vnto thee Lady Macrine, that my woefull plaintes would ſtyrre vppe thy ſmall care, and as thy beautie hath made thee thyne owne, ſo the true knowledge of thy griefes, ſhould make thee mine. I deſire thou wouldeſt regarde the beginning: and therewith note the ende.
                     For of truth, the ſame day that thou impriſonedſt my hart at the window, in the dungeon of my deſires, I had no leſſe weakneſſe to ouercome, then thou haddeſt ſtrength to enforce me: and greater was thy power to take me from my ſelfe, then my reaſon was to put mee from thee.
                     Now ladie Macrine, I doe not aske other mercie of thee, but that we may declare our mindes together. But in this caſe, what wilt thou I ſay vnto thee? but that thou haſt ſo much power ouer mee, and I ſo little of my liberty: that though I would not, my heart muſt needes bee thine: and that beeing thine, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe to be mine. And ſith it may not be, but that my life muſt bee condemned in thy ſeruice: bee thou as ſure of my Faith, as I am doubtfull of thy goodwill. For, I ſhall haue a greater honour to be loſt for thy ſake, then to win any other Treaſure. I haue no more to ſay vnto thee now, but that thou haue reſpect to my perdition: and to drawe life out of my death, and turne my teares to ioye.
                     And becauſe I holde my Faith, and will neuer deſpaire in thy hope, I ſend thee x. little rings of gold, with x. rings of Alexandria: and by the immortall Gods I conjure thee, that when thou putteſt them on thy fingers, thou receyueſt my Loue into thy heart.
                     
                        Marcus thy Louer, wrote this with his owne hand.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XI. ¶ Of an other Letter, which the Emperour ſent to the Ladie Macrine: wherein hee expreſſeth the Fiery-flames, which ſooneſt conſume the gentle-hearts.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArke thy neighbour at Rome, to thee Macrine his ſweete enemie; I call thee Sweete for it is iuſt, I dye for thee: and enemy, becauſe thou ceaſſeſt not to kill me. I cannot tell how it is, but ſith the feaſt of Ianus hitherto I haue written three letters vnto thee, in the anſwer wherof I would haue been contented to haue receiued but two from thee. If I would ſerue thee, thou wilt not bee ſerued: If I ſpeak to thee, thou wilt not anſwer me If I behold thee, thou wilt not looke at mee: if I call thee thou will not anſwer me: if I viſite thee, thou wilt not ſee me: if I write vnto thee, thou wilt make no anſwer: And the worſt of all is, if others do ſhew thee of my griefs,

thou takeſt it as a mockerie.
                     Oh that I had ſo much knowledge where to complaine to thee, as thou haſt power to eaſe my plaint: then my wiſdome ſhould be no leſſe praiſed amongſt the wiſe, then thy beautie among the fooles. I beſeech thee hartily not to haue reſpect to the rudenes of my reaſons, but regard the faith of my teares, which I offer to thee, as a witnes of my will.
                     I know not what profite may come by my harme: nor what gayne of my loſſe thou mayeſt hope to haue, nor what ſurety of my perill thou maiſt attaine: nor what pleaſure of my paine thou mayeſt haue?
                     I had aunſwere by my meſſenger, that without reading my Letters, with thine own hands thou didſt rent them in peeces: it ought to ſuffice to thinke how manie perſons are tormented. If it had pleaſed you Ladie Macrine, to haue read theſe few lines, you ſhould haue perceyued, how I am inwardly tormented.
                     Yee women be very extreame: and for the miſaduenture of one man, a woman will complaine of all men in generall. So yee all ſhew crueltie for one particular cauſe: openly yee pardon all mens liues, and ſecretly ye procure death to all. I account it nothing Ladie Macrine, that thou haſt done, but I lament that which thou cauſeſt thy Neighbour Valerius to ſay to me.
                     One thing I would thou ſhouldeſt remember, and not forget, That is: Sith my libertie is ſo ſmall, and thy power ſo great, that beeing wholly mine, am turned to be thine: the more iniury thou doſt to me, the more thou hurteſt thy ſelfe, ſince by thee I dye, as thou by me doſt liue. In this peruerſe opiniō abide not, ſo maiſt thou hazard the life of vs both. Thou buriſt thy good name, and deſtroyeſt my health, in the end thou muſt come to the ſame Phyſicke Pardon me Lady Macrine, if I ſay ought that may offend thee. I know ye women deſire one thing greatly: that is, to haue ſouerainty of vs, and yet not ſeeme ſo much as by thought to wiſh the ſame. Thou haddeſt the fame of a gentle nature, though indeede thou wert not ſo: yet thou haddeſt the fame therof, and an ancient good name ought not to be loſt with a new vnkindneſſe. Thou knoweſt how contrary ingratitude is to vertue, in a vertuous houſe. Thou canſt not be called vertuous, but if thou be curteous. There is no greater ingratitude, thē not to loue againe.
                     Though I viſite thee, and thou not me, it is nothing: though I remember thee, and thou forgetteſt mee, it is nothing: thogh I weepe, and thou laugh, it is nothing: though I craue of thee &amp; thou denie me, it is nothing: thogh thou oweſt mee, and pay mee not, it is nothing: But if I loue thee, and thou not mee, this is a great thing: which the eyes can neither diſſemble, nor the heart ſuffer.
                     All the vices in mortall men are to be pardoned, becauſe they offend naturally, ſaue only this diſcurteſy in women, and vngentlenes in men, which are counted of malice.
                     Diuers ſeruices by mee done to thee, and all the good willes I haue heretofore borne to thee, thou onely Lady Macrine, with one thing reward me. I pray thee be not ſlacke to helpe me, for I was not ſo to offer mee into perill, If thou ſayeſt that Patroclus thy husband hath that property in thee, at the leaſt yet receiue me vpon proofe, &amp; I will pretend a poſſeſſion of thee: and in this wiſe the vainglory in being thine, ſhall hide the hurt being mine: thou makeſt mee maruell not a little, that for ſo ſmall a rewarde, thou wilt ſuffer ſo great an importunity. For certainly we grant many things to an importunate man, which wee denie to a temperate man. If thou lady Macrine, hopeſt to ouercom me, behold I yeeld

mee as vanquiſhed. If thou wilt looſe mee, I holde mee loſt: if thou wilt kill mee, I holde me dead.
                     For by the geſtures which I make before thy gates, and the ſecrete ſighes, which I fetch in my houſe, thou mayſt know how greatly I minde to reſt, but thy braue aſſaults are rather buildings to nouriſh death, then to comfort the life. If thou wilt I eſcape this danger, denie me not remedie. For it ſhalbe a greater diſhonour for to ſlay me, then ſhame to ſaue me. It is no iuſt thing for ſo ſmall a gaine, to loſe ſo faithfull a friend. I wote not how to make thee my debter, nor how to make thee pay mee: and the worſt of all is, I knowe not what to ſay, nor how to determine For, I was not borne to mine owne wealth, but to be faithfull in thy ſeruices. And ſith thou knoweſt whome thou haſt truſted with thy meſſages, the ſame I do truſt with this open letter, and my anſwer it ſecret. I do ſend to thee a jewell of pearle, and a peece of golde: I pray the Gods make thee receyue them, as willingly as I doe freely ſend them.
                     
                        Marke Orator, to the inexorable Macrine.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XII. ¶ Of a Letter which the Emperour Marcus Aurelius ſent vnto the ladie Lyuia, wherein he reproueth that Loue is naturall, and that the moſt part of the Phyloſophers and wiſe men haue been by Loue ouercome.
                     
                     
                        
                           MArke full of ſorrow, to thee careleſſe Lyuia. If thy little care did lodge in me, and my ſorrowes were harboured in thee, thou ſhouldeſt then ſee how little the quarrell is, that I make vnto thee in reſpect to the torments I ſuffer.
                     If the flames did iſſue out, as the Fire doeth burne mee within, the heauens ſhould periſh with ſmoake, and the earth ſhould make imbers. If thou doeſt well remember the firſt time I ſaw thee in the Temple of the virgine Veſtals, thou beeing there, diddeſt alwayes pray to the Gods for thy ſelfe, and I vpon my knees prayed to thee for mee. Thou knoweſt and ſo doe I, that thou diddeſt offer oyle and honnie to the Gods, but I did offer vnto thee teares and ſighes.
                     It is iuſt thou giue more vnto him that offered his heart, then to him which draweth mony out of his purſe I haue determined to write vnto thee this Letter, whereby thou mayeſt perceiue how thou art ſerued with the arrowes of mine Eyes, which were ſhot at the white of thy ſeruice.
                     Oh vnhappy that I am, I feare leaſt this preſent calme doth threaten mee with a tempeſt to come. I will ſay that diſcurteſie in thee, cauſeth doubtfull hope in mee. Beholde my miſaduenture, I had loſt a letter, and turning to the Temple to ſeeke it, I found the letter, which was of ſome importance: and had almoſt loſt my ſelfe, which is the greateſt thing.
                     Conſidering my ſmall reward, I ſee mine eyes (the Ladders of my hopes) ſet on ſo high a wall, that no leſſe certaine is my fell then my clyming was doubtfull. Thou bending downe thy harneſſe of thy high deſerts, and putting mee to the poynt of continuall ſeruice, ſuffereſt mee to enioy the fruite, and giue vnto whom thou wilt the leaues.
                     By the immortall Gods I ſweare vnto thee, that I maruell not a little: For, I thought that in the Temple of the Virgin-Veſtals no temptations could haue comen vnto any man: But contrary now by true experience

I finde, that that woman is eaſylier ouercome, which is moſt watched, then the other that hath honeſt libertie.
                     All bodily diſeaſes bee firſt had, ere they be knowne, and knowne ere they ſeene, and ſeene ere they be felt: and felt ere they be taſted: And ſo in all things except this dart of Loue: whom they firſt feele the ſtroke thereof, before they knowe the way how it commeth. The lightning commeth not ſo ſudden, but it is knowne before by the thunder. The wall falleth not ſuddenly, but firſt ſome ſtones fall downe.
                     The colde commeth not ſo faſt, but ſome ſmall ſhiuering is ſeene before: only Loue is not felt, vntill he hath had power in the entrailes.
                     Let them know that are ignorant, and thou lady Lyuia, if thou wilt know, Loue ſleepeth when we waken, and waketh when we ſleepe: laugheth when wee weepe, and weepeth when wee laugh.
                     It aſſureth in taking, and taketh in in aſſuring: it ſpeaketh when wee bee ſtill, and is ſtill when wee ſpeake. And finally, it hath ſuch a condition, that to giue vs our deſire, it cauſeth vs to liue in paine. I ſweare vnto the, when my will became thy ſeruant, and thy beautie made thee my Miſtris, when I was at the Temple, and there found thee, neyther thou in thy prayers diddeſt minde mee, nor (I vnhappie man) did thinke on thee.
                     Oh vnhappy heart of mine, that being whole, thou art diuided: being in health thou art hurt, being aliue thou art killed: being mine thou art ſtolne: and the worſte of all is, that thou not helping to my life, conſenteſt that death ſhould aſſault mee.
                     Conſidering manie times Lady Liuia with my ſelfe, my thoughtes to be high, and my Fortunes baſe, I would haue ſeparated my ſelfe from thee: but vpon better hope, knowing my trauells to be well employed in thy ſeruice, I ſay though I might, I would not now wiſh to bee ſeparated from thee.
                     I will not denie one thing, that is: The curſed Loue taketh away the taſte of all things, and in thoſe things only it giueth vs pleaſure, which are greatly againſt our profite. This is the proofe of him that loueth heartily, that one frowne of her that hee loueth, doeth more grieue him, then all the delights of the reſt of his life can pleaſe.
                     I deeme Ladie Lyuia, thou art abaſhed to ſee mee openly as a Phyloſopher, &amp; to know me ſecretly as a louer. I beſeech thee hartily diſcouer me not. For if the Gods graunt mee long life, I am now a young foole, yet in age, I will be wiſe.
                     The Gods know what I deſire, and the force which doeth enforce mee thereunto. And as the fleſh is weake, and the hart tender, the occaſions manie, the vertues fewe, the world deceitfull, the people malicious. So I paſſe this ſpring-time with flowres, in hope that in harueſt I ſhall haue ſome fruite.
                     Thinkeſt thou lady Lyuia, that philoſophers (bee they neuer ſo wiſe) are are not touched with the ſharpe darts of Loue? and that vnder their courſe cloathes, there is not ſofte fleſh and white? Certainly amongſt hard bones is nouriſhed ſoft fleſh: and within the pricking huskes growe the Cheſſ-nut.
                     I ſay that vnder the ſimple attyre, is the faithfull loue. I do not denie but our fraile nature doeth withſtand our vertues. Nor I denie not but that the wanton deſires are repreſſed with vertuous mindes. Nor I denie not, but that the raſhnes of youth are reſtrayned with the reynes of reaſon.
                     I denie not but many times wiſdome doeth withſtand that which the fleſh procureth: and yet I confeſſe that hee which is not amorous, is a Foole.
                     And doeſt thou not know, that although we be wiſe, we leaue not therefore

to be men? doeſt not thou know, all that euer wee learne in our life, ſufficeth not to gouerne the Fleſh one houre? Doeſt not thou know, that to wiſe men in this caſe hath fallen many errours? Doeſt not thou knowe, that there hath bin and are manie maiſters of vertues: and much more there are and hath bin followers of vices.
                     Then, why doeſt thou make ſuch a wonder onely of mee? I will nor ſay it without a trueth, that I neuer had my iudgement ſo good and perfite, as when Cupid blewe winde on mee, with his wings.
                     There was neuer man vntill my time accounted wiſe, but firſt hee was intangled with Cupids ſnares. Gratian was in loue with Tamira. Solon Salaminus the giuer of the laws, was enamoured with one Gretian. Pittachus Mytelenus left his owne wife, and was in loue with a Bond-woman that hee brought from the warres.
                     
                        Cleobolus when hee was foure-ſcore yeares elde, and had read Phyloſophie ſixtie-fiue yeares, climbing vp a Ladder, to ſcale his Neighbours wall, fell, and of the bruiſe dyed.
                     
                        Periander Prince of Achaya, and chiefe philoſopher of Greece, at the inſtance of his louers, ſlew his own wife. Anacharſis a Philoſopher, a Scythian by his Father, and a Greeke by the mothers ſide, loued ſo dearely a woman of Thebes, that hee taught her all that he knew: in ſo much that he being ſicke on his bed, ſhee read for him in the ſchooles.
                     
                        Epimenides of Creete, that ſlept 15. yeares without waking. Although hee was a great worſhipper of the Gods, yet he was baniſhed Athens 10. yeares for the louing of Women.
                     
                        Architus Tarentinus, the maſter of Plato, and ſcholler of Pythagoras, occupyed his minde more to inuent newe kindes of Loue, then to employ his ſtudies to vertue and Learning.
                     
                        Gorgias Leontinus, borne in Scicile, had mo concubines in his houſe, then bookes in his ſtudie. All theſe were wiſe men, and we knew them wiſe, yet at the ende they were ouercome with fleſh. Therefore blame me not alone, for as I haue tolde thee of theſe fewe, ſo could I of a whole armey.
                     For of trueth he ought to haue many things, that will bee accounted a curious Louer. He muſt haue his eyes diſplayed on her that hee loueth, his vnderſtanding much altered in that hee thinketh, his tongue troubled in that it ſhould ſpeake: ſo that in ſeeing he is blinde, in thinking diſmaid, in ſpeaking troubled.
                     O Ladie Lyuia, the louing in mockerie, paſſeth by mockery: but where true loue is, there is griefe and no mockery: there true loue ſpitteth his poyſon, and cruell Cupid fixeth his Arrowes vp to the feathers.
                     The Eyes weepe, the heart ſigheth, the Fleſh trembleth, the ſinewes doe ſhrinke, the vnderſtanding is groſſe, reaſon falleth to the earth: Finally, the heauie Louer abyding in himſelfe, holdeth nothing of himſelfe.
                     All this I ſay, becauſe if I want knowledge to make mee a Louer; yet am I ſure that the workes faile not in me to effect thy ſeruice. And though by miſhap I ſaw thee, yet by good chaunce I knew thee. I aske nothing of thee, but that thou loue me faithfully, ſith I loue thee vnfainedly. And if thou heareſt that I am ſicke from my hart, I deſire thee to doe me ſome good. Sith it is in thee only to helpe me, it is reaſon thou onely doe ſeeke for remedie.
                     I was greatly comforted when Fulius Carlotus deſired me in thy behalfe, to doe a pleaſure, which I did incontinent all that thou deſiredſt, to the intent that thou another day ſhouldeſt doe franckly that I deſire thee. And beholde faire Ladie Lyuia, the woman that is ſerued with ſeruices, it is great

reaſon within a while ſhe be ſued vnto by prayer. And though my ſtrength cannot open the gates of the purpoſe, or not agreeing to thy demand yet all my labors ſlacke not to vphold thy renowne. I pray thee diſcouer not the one, nor beguile me with the other: For thou ſeeſt in graunting is remedy, and in hoping is comfort: but promiſe is deceiuable, and delaying is perillous, and the entertayning bindeth.
                     I ſee well that the hearty demaund requireth a long anſwere: but I wold not thou ſhouldſt doe ſo. But as I loue thee, ſo loue mee: as I deſire of thee, ſo graunt thou mee.
                     I will ſay once againe, I am all thine, and nothing mine owne. And note Lady Lyuia, that it is as much honour to thee, as profitable for mee, that thou chaunge theſe thy deſires, and put in order thy diſordered will. For, thou ſeeſt it is much better to heale ſhortly, then too-late, with fayling thy purpoſe?
                     All Women obſerue an euill opinion, that is: yee neuer receiue councell, although it bee giuen you in neuer ſo weightie a caſe. And if it bee not ſo, then becauſe thou art eſteemed beautifull, bee likewiſe honoured for taking of good councell. In this ſort, though my loſſe be much, and thy patience little, yet ſhall they account me wiſe in giuing counſell, and the moſt happie to follow it.
                     One thing I will ſay vnto thee, and pardon mee therein. Women bee much defamed in that they will take no counſell, and ſuch as doe aſſure their renowme ſo much on the iudgement of others, as they condemne well doing before.
                     I thinke good if it ſo like thee, and would if thou wilt, that thou ſhouldeſt doe in all 
                           〈…〉
                         I haue counſelled thee.
                     I will ſay no more Lady Lyuia, but that I do preſent vnto thee, all my vnfortunate troubles, my ſighes as a deſperate man: my ſeruice, as thy ſeruant, my troubled griefes, my wordes of Phyloſophie, and my teares as a Louer: I ſend thee heere a gyrſtle of Gold, on condition that thou alwayes ſixe thine Eyes on that, and thy heart on mee.
                     I pray the Gods giue mee to thee, and thee to mee.
