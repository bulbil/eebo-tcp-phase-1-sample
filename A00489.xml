            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               ❧A good Exhortation to euery
man what he ſhould doo when he goeth to bed and when
he riſeth.
            To a new Northen tune.
            
               
                  AT night lye down prepare to haue:
               thy ſléep, thy death, thy bed, thy graue.
               A riſe a wake think that thou haſt:
               thy life but lent, thy breth a blaſt.
            
            
               Let not the ſluggiſh ſléep,
               cloſe vp thy waking eye:
               Vntil with iudgement déep,
               thy dayly deeds thou trye.
            
            
               He which one ſinne in conſcience kéeps,
               when he to quiet goes:
               More ventrous is then he which ſléepes,
               with twentie mortall foes.

                   the day haſt ſpent:
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                   if nought amis thou finde,
               if ought betime repent.
            
            
               And ſince thy bed a pattern is,
               of death and fatall 
                     •
                  earie:
               Bedward it ſhall not be amis,,
               thus to record in verie.
            
            
               The ſtretching armes, the yawning breath,
               that I to bedward vſe:
               Are patterns of the panges of death,
               when life muſt me refuſe.
            
            
               The nightly Bell which I heare ſound,
               as I am laid in bed:
               Foreſhowes the Bell which me to ground,
               ſhall ring when I am dead,
            
            
               My bed is like the graue ſo colde,
               and ſleep which ſhuts myne eye,
               Reſembleth death: Clothes which me folde,
               declare the moules ſo drye.
            
            
               The friſking fleas reſemble wel,
               the wringling worme to me:
               Which with me in the graue ſhall dwel,
               where I no light ſhall ſée.
            
            
               The waking Cock that early crowes,
               to weare the night away:
               Puts me in minde the trump that blowes
               before the later day.
            
            
               The ſplendent Sun whoſe golden ray,
               no eye can dure to ſée:
               Declares how in that dreadful day,
               God ſhall appéer to me.
            
            
               The riſing in the morn likewiſe,
               When ſleepy night is paſt:
               Puts me in minde how I ſhall riſe
               to iudgement at the laſt.
            
            
               I go to bed as to my graue,
               God knoweth when I ſhall wake:
               But Lord I truſt thou wilt me ſaue,
               and me to mercy take.
            
            
               Thus wil I wake, thus wil I ſléep,
               thus wil I hope to riſe:
               Thus wil I neither waile nor wéep,
               but ſing in godly wiſe.
            
            
               Repent, repent you ſinners all,
               and call to God for grace:
               That he may graunt vnto vs all,
               in heauen a dwelling place.
            
            FINIS.
