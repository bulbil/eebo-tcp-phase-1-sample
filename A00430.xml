            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE HIGH AND
MIGHTIE PRINCE,
HENRY, Prince of Great
BRITAINE.
            
               MY GRACIOVS LORD.
            
            
               GReat Attempts become great
Princes. And is there a greater
or a more worthy enterpriſe,
more holy in it ſelfe,
and more comfortable to the
world, then the re-eſtabliſhing
of peace in the Church,
and the refreſhing of Chriſtendome,
through the reconcilement
of the differences,
which ignorance, auarice
and ambition haue hatched,
and which paſſion and ſtomacke doe as yet maintaine? And is
there any Prince more worthy for the ſincerity of his life, more
capable for his ſolide iudgement, and rare knowledge in all
good ſciences, eſpecially in thoſe that belong to God, and godlineſſe,

then that great King your father, the nurſ-father of learning?
Who I ſay, more fit for this great buſineſſe then Hee, as
well for his eminent dignitie, power, credite and authority amongſt
the Chriſtian Princes of the Weſt, as alſo for the experience
which he hath in the managing of the like affaires, hauing
already well nigh pacified thoſe diuiſions, which the ouermuch
ſcruple of ſome, and the too too much libertie of others
had brought into the Church of England; vnto the which conformity,
he hath alſo moſt happily reduced the Church of Scotland,
to be conioyned and re-vnited both in diſcipline, and ceremonies;
that he may attainne to that marke which he aimes
at, that is, a holy and ſtrict vnion, as well in the religion, as in
the ſtate of all the people and Countries vnder his obedience?
Who I ſay, can with more hope of good ſucceſſe vndertake ſo
excellent a peece of worke, then he, whom the heauens haue
ſo richly endowed with ſuch rare qualities, as I haue ſayed, and
other perfections truely heroique, and admirable! And you my
renowned Lord, after him, and with him for to ſecond him in
ſuch a goodly and honourable enterpriſe, ſeeing that already
by reaſon of the generoſity of your ſpirit, the happy education
of your youth, the imitation of ſo rare an example, and that at
home, and of your owne Father: and aboue all the reſt, by reaſon
of the bountie and courage of your nature; you are the ſecond
hope of great Britane, and make men expect great and
mighty deſſeignes at your hands, and ſuch ſhal be profitable to
all Chriſtendome: and (if it pleaſe God) to be one day a principall
inſtrument to tame theſe damnable Monſters of wicked
factions and pernitious ſects, which haue almoſt made a ſpoile
of the body of Chriſt his Church; yet not ſo much doubtleſſe
through the diuerſity of beleefes in the matter of faith, which
is the ſoule and eſſence of religion (for the which we are greatly
to praiſe God) As for the differences of Eccleſiaſticall rytes
and ceremonies, whereof your highneſſe ſhall ſee here a patterne
or plat-forme, eſtabliſhed only to ſhew to the world, that
in the three other Clymates, yea euen among the blind Pagans
and impious Mahometiſts, the name of the Sonne of God is

knowne and called vpon, if not with ſo much puritie, yet ſurely
with more pietie (although that their doctrine is not ſo ſubtilly
expounded) then amongſt vs: and ſhall be more and more
(God willing) toward the end of the world, according to the
Propheticall and Euangelicall promiſes; and in the iſſue to
conuince and confound thoſe which doe empale and encloſe
the Church of Ieſus Chriſt, within the circuite of their walles,
or within the limits of one Prouince, or elſe within the regions
of thoſe people, who hold one ſelfe ſame opinion, and are obedient
to one chiefe or head aboue all other. Ieſus Chriſt is
the grand Soueraigne, and vniuerſal Patriarch of al his Church:
and the holy Ghoſt ſaith, that it neither hath, nor ſhall haue
any other bounds or limits, then the whole compaſſe of the
round world: and which is more, that it ſhall haue his preſence
and aſſiſtance for euer; although (for the ingratitude of men)
not at all times, nor in all places with like glorie, and efficacie.
The Sunne neuer ceaſeth to ſhine vpon the earth, but not euery
day and in euery place, with the like brightneſſe. This enterpriſe
of Reconciliation (my gratious Lord) hath been attempted,
not once or twice, but often in ages paſt, as well by calling
of Councells, as by publicke conferences; as for example, that
with the Donatiſts, through the mediation of Saint Auguſtine at
Carthage, where the end was happie enough, and might in
ſome ſort ſerue for a paterne in the differences of this age; as
alſo the conference at Ratisbon, vnder the authority of the Emperour
Charles the fift, for Germanie: and for Fraunce that
at Poiſi in the raigne of Charles the ninth.
            And beſides theſe publicke meetings and conferences, there
haue beene found learned, iudicious and moderate men, not a
a few from time to time, who bearing a great zeale to the
peace of the Church, haue opened and ſhewed certaine meanes
and wayes, euery one according to his knowledge and conſcience:
But theſe diſcoueries of the trueth, haue found no place
in the hearts of them that were lead with paſſion; but will (by
all poſſibilitie) bring foorth better fruit hereafter in their due
ſeaſon; that is to ſay. When as God being firſt ouercomeby

our Repentance, Cries and Prayers, ſhall cauſe that lamentable
Schiſme to ceaſe, being one of the greateſt Plagues that
euer happned or could happen among Chriſtians. Your Highneſſe
ſhal ſee by marking that which I haue here compiled out
of them and their writings, how the difficultie of reconciliation
for a great part of our controuerſies, whether it be with
the Eaſt or South Churches, or between our ſelues of the Weſterne
Churches, lies not ſo much in the things themſelues
which fall in queſtion, as in the peruerſe opinion of the diſputants:
and that thoſe things wherein we agree, are a thouſand
times of more importance, to the glorie of God, and our ſaluation,
then thoſe things wherein we varie and diſagree; and
ſhall haue farre more reaſon to loue vs for thoſe things wherein
we agree, then for to hate and perſecute vs cruelly for thoſe
things, which remaine as yet to be auoided from among vs:
yea ſeeing the greater part of our diſputations, happen for
want of vnderſtanding the ſtate of the controuerſies in queſtion;
or els by reaſon of our termes and faſhion of ſpeaking:
but farre more for want of conceiuing the true ſenſe of the holy
Scripture; which alſo ſome great men of our time haue ſhewed
manifeſtly, in certain points of doctrine, which were iudged
irreconcileable: wherein was manifeſted Gods iuſtice againſt
our ſinnes of preſumption, curioſity, vaine-glory, enuie, auarice
and ambition. I ſay the more, becauſe Princes and Soueraigne
Magiſtrates ſhould beare ſole authority, and by their abſolute
commaundement ſhould teſtifie their good will therein,
and employ the prudent aduiſe of their Eccleſiaſticall ſubiects,
not the wiſeſt onely, but the beſt and godlieſt alſo, not ſo much
to diſpute and winne the victory, as to conferre, and amiably
to agree: The God of peace will giue the fruit of peace, to his
glory and our good. But I know not by what Inchantment or
deſtinie, Kings for the moſt part know not their forces, and willingly
do diſpoyle themſelues of a greate part of their owne
Authoritie, and many times perceiue it too late. As for the particulars,
many doe know and ſee the euill, but doe perſwade
themſelues, that the remedie is moſt dangerous of all: or elſe

for feare, will not bee ſingular in opinion, be it neuer ſo good,
louing rather to ſuffer themſelues to bee caried away with the
torrent and ſtreame of diuiſion, and to be of the common faſhion,
that they may the better follow their priuate affaires. Euery
one doth bragge and vaunt himſelfe of his faith, but few
or none will practiſe charitie, and what is faith without charitie,
more then a tree without fruite? or a body without a ſoule?
I haue beene here emboldened to addreſſe my ſelfe to your
Highneſſe, for the reaſons aboue ſaid; and to the end that vnder
the luſtre of your name, this little Treatiſe, written onely
for the publike vtilitie, might be the more fauourably receiued
and reſpected of all men, eſpecially of the ſubiects of the kings
Maieſtie your father; amongſt whom are more learned Diuines
well practiſed in the art of diſputation, in the reading of the Fathers,
and in all the Hiſtories of the Church, then (peraduenture)
in three or foure other as great Countries. Their writings
doe teſtifie it, inſomuch that wee doe admire thereat in
theſe parts; and the Engliſh Liturgie gathered according to
the modell of the Auncients, the pureſt of them; in the which
through the aduiſe of ſo many excellent men in learning and
pietie, Engliſh men and others, hath beene reſerued for reuerence
of Antiquitie, all which might be left with a good conſcience.
Alſo it is very likely that it ſhall endure perpetually,
and ſerue for a patterne or example for thoſe which are not
as yet reformed: The praiſe whereof (next vnto God) ſhall be
to the good and wiſe Kings of Great Britane; the Predeceſſors
whereof haue receiued and embraced with the firſt, the
faith of Ieſus Chriſt, and not with the laſt, the Reformation
which was neceſſary in the Church: The principal cauſe truely,
or rather the only cauſe of this long peace &amp; proſperity, wherwith
God hath bleſſed the Kingdomes of your Iland, beſides
many benedictions wherewith he hath fauoured your Royall
houſe, and your Highneſſe in particular, who haue after his
Maieſtie the firſt place in age, in valour, and dignitie, and who
for the gratious reſpect which naturally you doe ſhew vnto all

men, which through any merite or ſeruice doe ſeeke the honor
of your fauour, will mooue you (I am aſſured) to receiue
this little preſent, as from him, who will thinke himſelfe
happy all the dayes of his life to ſay,

all their Prieſts. This Pope is acknowledged by the Italians,
Frenchmen, Spaniards, by ſome Germanes and Polanders,
and withall by ſome Americans and Indians, which of

Romane Catholickes do ſay and affirme themſelues to be very
ſtrongly vnited together, becauſe that they depend vpon one
head or chiefe: Neuertheleſſe, they are not all of one accord ſo

               ¶Secondly, Certaintie of Chriſtian Religion.
               
                  FOraſmuch as we intend to intreate of diuers points of the
Euangelicall veritie: It ſeemeth neceſſarie vnto vs, before
all things, to eſtabliſh and ſhew the foundation: The
which ſhall bee of more authoritie if we inſert here, the
end of a learned diſcourſe of Gennade, Patriarke of Conſtantinople,
                  Gennadius Confeſſion Hiſt. Eccl. de Conſt.
                  made by him in the preſence of Mahomet the
ſecond Emperour of the Turkes. Beſides theſe reaſons
(ſaith he) there are ſeuen which doe altogether aſſure
vs of our faith. The firſt, becauſe that the Prophets of
the Iewes, the which we doe receiue, haue foretold of
IESVS and all that which he did, and his Diſciples after
him through his power: And in like maner the Oracles
of the Grecians by the permiſſion of GOD, and
the Aſtronomers of Perſia and of Greece, did foretell
of him. The ſecond, becauſe the holy Scriptures is altogether
conformable to our Faith; for that thoſe which
did write them, had all one teacher; to wit, the grace of
God: for if the ſame had not beene, they had differed
and varied in ſome point. The third, becauſe that
men receiued this faith (although new and ſtrange)
with great care, among all nations, and in great daungers:
And not onely the fooliſh, but alſo the wiſe and
prudent:The Sybils. and all Diabolicke deceit was perfectly reuerſed
and ouerthrowne:To wit, Pagans. The fourth, becauſe that this
faith contayneth nothing that is impoſſible, and which
diſagreeth with it ſelfe: and that there is no corporall
thing therein, but rather ſpirituall, and it is the way
which leadeth the ſoule to the loue of God, and to the

hope of euerlaſting life: The fift, becauſe that thoſe
which haue receiued this faith, and that haue liued vertuouſly
according to the loue of Chriſt, haue receiued
great gifts of God, and haue wrought many miracles:
the which could not haue beene done, had not the faith
beene true. The ſixt, becauſe that all that, which may
be obiected againſt it, is eaſily refuted with firme arguments.
The ſeuenth, becauſe that the Kings of Paganiſme
Countries, haue made Warres againſt this faith
with infinite power and cruelties during many ages,
and haue profited nothing at all, but rather the faith
hath preuailed ſo well, inſomuch that it doth perſiſt
vntill this preſent, and when the Lord doth come he
ſhall finde it. To the ſame Ieſus our Lord and true
God be glory for euer. Amen.
            
            
               ¶Thirdly, the Subiect and end of this Treatiſe.
               IF the Schiſmes doe ruinate Chriſtendome by the aduantage
that the Infidels doe take, it is nothing leſſe endamaged
by the ſcandall which Chriſtians themſelues doe receiue the
one of the other: the one liueth vncertaine of that which he
ought to beleeue, the other perſwadeth himſelfe that he followeth
the right way, and animated out of meaſure againſt
the opinion of the reſt, he doth but attend the houre to renew
thoſe auncient Furors. If any man ſpeake of a Councell, or
to correct and eſchue thoſe vitious and ſcandalous extremities,
he is ſo ſoone reproued by thoſe which haue the eares of
Kings and people.Pſal. 120. 7. 
                  I ſeeke peace (ſaith the Prophet) and
when I talke thereof, they are bent to warres. The ſaying

of Zaga Biſhop of Ethiope, and Embaſſadour of Preſter
Damian à Goes de morib. Aethiop. 
                  Iohn is more charitable: It is a miſerable thing (ſaith he)
that Chriſtian ſtrangers ſhould be ſo ſharpely reprooued
as enemies, as I haue beene heere: and other things
which concerne not the true faith: But it ſhould be farr
more conuenient to ſupport all Chriſtians, be they
Grecians, be they Armenians, be they Ethiopians, be
they of any one of the ſeuen Chriſtian Churches, with
charity and loue of CHRIST, and to permit them to
liue and conuerſe amongſt other chriſtian brethren
without any iniurie, becauſe that we are all Infants of
one Baptiſme, and doe hold truely the true faith: and
there is no reaſon to diſpute ſo ſharpely touching ceremonies,
but rather that euery one ſhould obſerue and
keepe his owne, without hating or troubling the other,
and not to be excluded out of the commerce of the
Church; if being a ſtranger in other Prouinces hee
keepe and obſerue the cuſtomes of his owne Country.
This is the Diſcourſe of a Moore,Impedit ira animum ne poſſit cernere verum. which ſhould make vs
bluſh: But ſeeing that ignorance obſcureth the vnderſtanding,
and that anger ſtoppeth the eares, and ſhutteth the eyes
of the men of this world: It reſteth for the Louers of peace
and trueth, to put in practiſe the commandement of our Sauiour,
Take heede (ſaith he) of the leauen of the
                  Mat. 16. 6. 
                  Phariſees:
For who can aſſure himſelfe that this commaundement
hath not more ſcope? But, ſome man will ſay, what
meanes is there to diſcerne this leauen and theſe Phariſees,
in ſo great a conflict of reaſon? The anſwere is, that when the
Scriptures, the which all Chriſtians doe claime, haue not
ſufficient light, for to make the trueth in the doctrine of
controuerſies, to bee apparently perceiued: Yet may a man

now a dayes vſe that meanes which S. Ireneus councelleth
Lib. 4. contra haereſ. vs, which is, that he haue a recourſe to the Churches, where
the Apoſtles haue conuerſed for to learne the Apostolicke
tradition. But men are farre enough from taking this way.
The one perſwadeth himſelfe that the Apoſtolicke Churches
are periſhed, the other calleth them plaine heretickes: For it
is manifeſt, that we muſt beleeue the promiſe of the Son of
God, who ſaid to his Apoſtles, yea, as well to them as to the
Colledge of their ſucceſſors, Goe through the vniuerſall
world, behold I am with you vntill the conſumation of
the
                  
                     Mat. cap. vlt. 20, 
                  world. Here is the full But of this Treatiſe, to make
men ſee by Teſtimonie of Hiſtoriographers, being ocular
witneſſes, and of vnreproueable Authors, that there are
Churches in the Apoſtolicke Sees, and for to ſhew that they
are conformable among themſelues, and to the Scripture, in
that which is neceſſarie to ſaluation. As for ceremonies or
curious Queſtions, it matters not, if euery one of them doeth
make, or beleeue that which ſeemeth him beſt: That which is
worſt of all, is the diuiſion, which proceedeth of zeale, but with
little charitie, and it will not be amiſſe to recite the moderation
which Saint Paul commandeth: If you (ſaith he) bee
otherwiſe minded, GOD ſhall reueale euen the ſame
vnto
                  
                     Phil cap. 3. 15. 
                  you. As for the reſt, this Treatiſe is not for the learned
ſort, of whom we are willing to receiue both councell and
correction whereſoeuer it ſhall ſo fall out: It is but for to
ſolace thoſe which deſire to learne, and haue not the meanes
to read diuers authors, eſpecially the Greeke and Latin, Thoſe
alſo that ſearch diſcourſes garniſhed and painted out, with
all ſorts of flowers and coulers, ſhall not bee here ſatisfied.
This ſubiect cannot permit any rhetoricall ſentences, and
the faſhion of the Treatiſe is farre wide from it, here is

but a Collection of diuerſe paſſages, Coppies and ſentences
of authors word by word, with briefe and ſimple Annotations.
The breuity is, to the end that the ſimplicity ſhould
not be enuious, and the ſimplicity is, becauſe that it is conuenient
both to the matter and argument: In like manner
becauſe that which is moſt plainely ſpoken, ſhould haue leſt
ſuſpicion and be more intelligible. I doe not doubt that this
breuity will giue any aduantage to the contentious: But I
ſhall haue better meanes hereafter to ſatisfie them, God willing.
Let it then ſuffice thee for this preſent (Catholicke
Reader) to haue here a beginning of the knowledge of this
ſubiect, a knowledge which will increaſe in thee, through the
loue of the truth. The ancient Biſhop Meliton, (as Euſebius
writeth)Hiſt. Eccl. l. 4. cap. 22. did viſite the Churches of the Eaſt, for to learne
what were the Canonicall Bookes, and true writings
of the Apoſtles: If thou doeſt read this abridgment,
thou ſhalt imitate without
any paine, the holy curioſitie
of this good man.

The Apoſtles
being in Hieruſalem, St.
Peter tooke not vppon
himſelfe the Primacy,
neither, ſaid he, is it lawfull
for me to make a Canon
vpon the ſame: But
the Apoſtles and the
Prieſts aſſembled themſelues
together for to conſult thereupon, and Saint Peter
                     
reiected them not, but he began to ſpeake, and after
him Saint Iames ſpake: and they all did condeſcend to
the opinion of Saint Iames, that is to ſay, Saint Peter
himſelfe and the reſt of the Apoſtles and Prieſts.

                     De princip. cap. 2. I acknowledge that St.
Peter was an Vniuerſall Paſtor and Teacher, but hee
was not alone, but alſo euery one of the other Apoſtles
was in honour equall with him. It is true that our
Sauiour promiſed the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen
to Saint Peter, the which he declareth to bee no other
thing, then the power to binde and vnbinde: But
it is manifeſt, that he gaue the ſame power to the other
Apoſtles, ſaying, Whatſoeuer yee binde on earth, ſhall bee
bound in Heauen. Wee doe conclude then, that all the
Apoſtles had equall and like honour, in that which
was belonging to the Church, but Saint Peter was preferred,
in this holy dozen, and for that the others were
preſent, he propounded the queſtion, and peraduenture
receiued the honour to be ſet in the firſt ranke.

authoritie, but they would that hee ſhould bee their
Prince. And this ſaying of Anacletus, is confirmed, by
this ſigne, to wit, that the Grecians doe follow the contradictorie
of our concluſion, (that is to ſay, of the beliefe
of the Church of Rome) and none ought to ſay,
that ſoe great a people are in errour, a people I ſay, that
haue receiued the faith before the Romanes, and the
moſt part, at the very firſt foundation or planting of the
Church.

that hee was the onely head of the Militant Church:
And they ſay, that he receiued not of Ieſus Chriſt full
authority: The ſame they beleeue of the Biſhop of
Rome, the which they maintaine to bee like other
Biſhops.

                     Preſter-Iohn ſent to me, to aske wherfore
we haue diuided the Churches of Antioche and
Rome, ſeeing we profeſſe to be Chriſtians, &amp; ſeeing that
the Church of Antioche, was in a manner the chiefeſt,
vntill the Councell of Pope Leo, whom three hundred
and eighteene Biſhoppes aſſiſted. I anſwered as
I had ſaid once before to his greatneſſe, that indeed Antioche,
was heretofore the head of the Church,
which Saint Peter gouerned, and dwelt in it fiue yeares,
and in Rome fiue and twenty yeares. After that, hee
inquired whether we doe obay all that which the Pope
commaunded vs; I anſwered him, that we doe, and
that we were obliged therunto, by the Article of our
holy faith, which confeſſeth one holy Catholicke
Church. Whereupon hee replied, that if the Pope
would vſurpe ſo great prerogatiue, as to vſe towards
them an vnlawfull commaundement, they would not
make any reckoning of it: And if by ſuch meanes their
Abuna would preſume ſo farre, they would burne the
Coppie of ſuch commaundement.
                  
                     Annot. By this diſcourſe it is ſeene that the Aethiopian

Church doth hold, that the Primate of the Church
may erre, and commaund vnlawfull things, although
he doe it in the qualitie of a Primate (for hee commandeth
not by any other authority) and that the Iudgement
of the Church is good and valuable, without the
aduiſe and conſent of the Primate.

The Apoſtles (as Saint Cyprian ſayth)Simpl. prael. were all of an

                  ANNOTATION.
                  THere is three manners of gouernement, that is to ſay,
Monarchie, Ariſtocracie, and Democracie.
                     Bodin. Repub. l. 2. c. 1. 
                     Monarchie
is, when one alone hath power to commaund. Ariſtocracie
is, when the leſſer part of the people hath the
Soueraignetie in it ſelfe, to giue a law to the reſt of the people,
be it to all in generall, or to ſome one in particular. Democracie,
when all the people, or the greater part of them,
haue the ſoueraigne authority. Preſidencie is, when in a State
Ariſtocratique or Democratique, there is one that
hath the firſt ranke, and the charge to gouerne in the aſſemblies.
Magiſtracie, or Superintendencie, is when he, that
is Preſident, hath iuriſdiction ouer the particulars, for to
cauſe the Lawes and Statutes of the Common-wealth, or
Monarche, whereof he is a Subiect, to bee obſerued.

                     Durand. de ſacris Eccl. lib. 3. c. 2. This charge and Iuriſdiction is giuen ſometimes for
terme of life, and inſtituted both in Title and Office..
Sometimes for a certaine time and in the forme of a Commiſſion:
Some man may demand whether Saint Peter had
ſimply the Primacy, that is to ſay, the firſt ranke, or place amongſt
the Apoſtles, or whether he had Iuriſdiction ouer euery
one of them in particular, or whether he had a Monarchall
authority ouer their company Alſo whether had he the
Primacie in Diuine affaires, and in ſuch ſort, that it was not
Lawfull for his fellowes to giue to vnto another. The Romane
Church doth holde that Saint Peter had authority in diuine
matters ouer the company of the Apoſtles, and that he that is
elected and choſen, to preſide or gouerne in the Church, hath
the ſame authority ouer it, and is not obliged to follow the
greater voyce▪ in giuing his ſentence according to the conſultations
of the Councels. For proofe whereof is aleaged,
Thou art Peter and vpon this Stone, &amp;c. I wil giue thee
the Keyes.
                     Matth. 16. 
                     I haue prayed for thee,
                     Iohn. 
                     Feede my Sheepe,
Strengthen thy Brethren: And that the faith of the
Romanes was renowned through the
                     Rom. 1. 
                     world.
                  
                  This opinion of the Romane Church, is ſo particular,
that not onely the Catholicke and Apoſtolicke Churches of
the Eaſt, South, and of the North, and the reformed Churches
of the Weſt, but alſo the reſt, that make profeſsion to beleeue
the Roman Church, cannot approue of this point.
                  Neuertheles this is the ground &amp; foundation of the others.
For when one makes profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, it is neceſſarie
that he be reſolued to which hee ought to giue credit,
To wit, whether to the holy Scripture, expounded by the greater
voice of Biſhops, and of the Apoſtolicke Seas (which▪ is the
foundation of the Eaſt Churches2. Reſpon. Jerem. fine.:) or to a ſupreame head,

who hath aſsiſtance of the Biſhops of his quarter (which is the
foundation of the Latine Church.)
                  The Church of Rome, pretendeth that her Biſhop cannot
erre, in the things which he pronounceth in the quality of
the head thereof, although that one whole Councell was of a
contrary opinion: But the councel of Baſil (wherin was aſſembled
all the Latine Church) did hold the contrary: Yea many
Catholicke Romane Doctors doe mainetaine it in their
writings: Concilium eſſe ſupra Pontificem (ſaith Bellarmine)
aſſerunt omnes haeretici: idem aſſerunt Cardinalis
Camaracenſis, Io. Gerſon, Iac. Almaricus, Cuſanus,
Panormitanus, Cardinalis Florentinus, Abulenſis.
Moreouer it is the voice of the people, that it be ſo, and if one
doe aske a Romaine Catholicke wherefore he belieueth; or
doth ſuch and ſuch things, he anſwereth preſently, that the
Church hath ſo ordained it. In ſaying ſo hee confeſſeth that
the Soueraigntie belongs to the Church. For were not that a
haynous crime ſo to obſcure the Maieſtie of a Monarch, as
to ſay that the Eſtates doe make Lawes and Edicts? And it is
manifeſt that the Romane Catholickes, in ſoe doing, doe accuſe
the Pope and the Church of Rome of errour, to the
which they giue neuertheleſſe the title of Miſtreſſe of all
other Churches: and do confeſſe, that if there be any error in
this, there may be likewiſe in other opinions: And conſequently
the Grecians, and the Reformed Chriſtians, doe build
vpon a farre more ſure foundation.
                  As for the places of the holy Scripture alleaged by the Latine
Church, the foreſaide Apoſtolicke Churches doe clearely
and manifeſtly affirms, that thoſe places before alleaged
doe conclude nothing for a Monarchie:Apoc. 21. 14. That
the Church is founded vpon all the Apoſtles, in like manner

as vpon Saint Peter, That our Lord prayed for them all
Ioh. 14. 16. That all had power to binde and vnbinde,Mat. 18. 18 To Feede,1. Pet. 5. 1. and
confirme them,Acts 14. 22 And that the faith of the Church of Theſſalonica
(which is now the faith of the Greek Church) is ſpread
and ſcattered into all places,1. Theſ. 1. And moreouer that the Lord
made a promiſe to the company of the Apoſtles, more expreſſe
then that which he made to S. Peter, in particular:
I am (ſaith he) with you vntill the end of the world?
                     Mat. 28. 20. And
withall two great Lawyers of that time, viz. Hotman and
Ranchin

thereof:Reuiſ. Concil. From hence therefore the Catholicke and Apoſtolicke
concluſion is taken, That the Church (which in her
foundation is a Monarchie, becauſe that Ieſus Chriſt is
the King) ought to be gouerned Ariſtocratically by her
Biſhops,

And for that alſo ſhe hath born the firſt prerogatiue in

as ſhe doth.

                     De primat. l. 2. The Latines
ſay that the bleſſed Apoſtle Saint Peter was conſtituted
by the Lord, the Prince of the twelue Apoſtles, and that
he gaue into his hands the Keyes of Heauen, againſt the
which the Gates of Hell ſhould neuer preuaile, that hee
alſo prayed that his faith ſhould not faile, and ſuch like
things, as doe manifeſtly ſhew the Primacie of Saint
Peter: And they ſay, that the Pope was conſtituted to
be his ſucceſſor, and hath receiued of Saint Peter all the
Primacie, and that hee can, all that Peter could in
things, concerning faith, and that it is impoſſible
that he ſhould decline from the truth in matters of
faith: For if hee ſhould faile, all matters of faith
would runne to ruine. But Honorius Biſhop of Rome
was an heretike, according to the ſeauenteenth decree
of the ſixt Vniuerſall Councell. It may bee then that
the Pope might decline from the truth in matters of
faith. Yet graunt that hee erred in the faith, the
words of the Lord are not in vaine. That the gates of
Hell ſhall not preuaile againſt the Church.
                     Mat. 16. 18 The piety and
integrity of Religion, may be firmely preſerued in
other Biſhops. It is then manifeſt that it is not peculiar
to the Roman Church, to bee founded vpon this
ſtone, for that ſhould be hard and grieuous, and not far
differing from the Iewes baſeneſſe, to incloſe the

Church within Rome. Well then, Chriſt hath built his
Church; but he builded it vpon the faith and doctrine
of Peter, and vpon thoſe that ſhalbe keepers and obſeruers
of ſuch a confeſſion. And if Saint Agathon affirmed,
that his Church (to wit that of Rome) neuer erred
from the truth, it is no wonder, for it is becauſe that indeed
very ſeldome ſhe falleth from the faith. Otherwiſe
how ſhould a man interpret this place of Scripture: All
are gone out of the way: they are al corrupt▪ there is none that
doth good, no not

the time to come: and that which is to bee noted,
Agathon ſpake that, before the ſixt Synode.

                     Cap. 26. 
                     Preſter-Iohn calling to remembrance that
I had ſaid, that the Church had drawn theſe things
(that is to ſay, the ceremonies of the Maſſe) out of the
paſſion, he demaunded of me what was this Church;
and wherefore haue we two chiefe heads in Chriſtendome,
the one at Conſtantinople in Greece, and the other
at Rome in Italy: vnto whom I made anſwere,
that we acknowledged no more then one Head of the
Church, and although Conſtantinople was the chiefe
in the beginning, yet the ſame now was aboliſhed: for
that the head of the Church ought to be, where Saint
Peter dwelleth, becauſe that Ieſus Chriſt tolde him:
Tues Petrus, &amp; ſuper hanc petram &amp;c. And then, when
Saint Peter was in Antioch, the Church was there, by
reaſon that the chiefe head was then there reſident; the
which being now come to Rome: there, was the Eccleſiaſticall
Iudge eſtabliſhed, and ſo firmely placed, that
it remaineth there vntil this preſent. Moreouer he told
me then, that I yeelded ſufficient reaſon for the Church
of Rome; but hee asked me what I could ſay of the
Church of Conſtantinople, which was planted by St.
Marke, and of that of Greece, whereof Saint Iohn Patriarch
of Alexandria was head.

ſame with the Grecians in the controuerſie▪ againſt

Church be the chiefe and mother of the other
Churches, by reaſon that Saint Peter was her Paſtor, it
is more reaſon that Antioch ſhould obtaine theſe titles,
becauſe ſhe firſt embraced and receiued his preaching:
from thence it commeth, that Antioch is called Theopolis,
the citie of God; or elſe that Church of Ieruſalem,
which obtained the great and Soueraigne Sacrificer,
who preached, and offered himſelfe a Sacrifice therein.

Scripture, and the holy Fathers, that the Catholike and
Apoſtolike Church is not tyed to any one certaine

place, to one nation, or to one ſort of people, but that
it is in that place, and with thoſe nations, where the

                     Diſt. 21. Quamuis. Although that all the Catholicke
and Apoſtolike Churches, eſtabliſhed through the
vniuerſall world, are a nuptiall bedde of Chriſt: Neuertheleſſe,
the holy Roman Church was not preferred before
the other Churches, by any conſtitutions of councels,
but rather obtained the Primacy from the holy
words of our Lord. The Church of Rome is therefore
the firſt Sea of the Apoſtle Peter, ſhe hath no ſpot
or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing: but in theſe things the
higher her degree is, the greater is her authoritie: for
the greater haue the power to commaund, and the leſſer
are to yeelde obedience.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  
                     SAint Peter ought to be conſidered foure manner of
wayes: firſt, in the quality of an Apoſtle, ſent by God immediately:

as ſuch a one that had no ſucceſſor. In the ſecond,
place as an Apoſtle ſimply, hauing charge to plant many
Churches: in ſuch manner S. Marke and other Euangeliſtes
(their Subſtitutes, which alſo are called Apoſtles) were
his Succeſſors. In the third place, as a Biſhoppe and Preſident
in euery Church, where he was: that is to ſay, in Antioch,
Rome, Ieruſalem: as Euodias did ſucceede him in Antioch,
Clement in Rome, S. Iames the Apoſtle, and S. Simeon
in Ieruſalem. Fourthly, S. Peter is to be conſidered as
Primate in the Catholike Church: in ſuch manner S. Iohn
the Apoſtle (entirely beloued of the Lord) ſucceeded him▪
hauing out-liued S. Peter fiue and twenty, or thirty yeares:
Moreouer, that S. Iohn was preferred before all the Biſhops
of the world, is apparent by that, that he was taken for one of
the three pillers of the Church, and was one of the twelue
foundations, vpon which the ordinarie Biſhoppes of cities
were conſtituted. And withall, Tradition confirmeth this:
for there is no Church in the world which nameth not the
Apoſtles before the Biſhops: yea the Church of Rome preferreth
the Apoſtles before the Popes. It remaineth then
for vs to ſearch, who was the ſucceſſor of S. Iohn in the Catholike
Primacy, whether Polycarpus was his ſucceſſor in
Epheſus, or Simeon ſucceſſor to S. Peter in Ieruſalem, or
Albinus of Alexandria ſucceſſor of S. Marke, ſucceſſor and
choſen of S. Peter, or Ignatius ſucceſſor of Euodias, and of
S. Peter in Antioch: or Euariſtus ſucceſſor of Clement,
and of Linus, and of S. Peter in Rome.
                  There are two Churches which haue contended herein,
more then eight hundred yeeres, that is to ſay, that of Conſtantinople,
and that of Rome. The Romane Church ſaith,
that S. Peter hath ordained, is from God, that Rome ſhould

haue the Primacie and power to command, and that for euer.
They of Conſtantinople ſay on the contrarie ſide, that our
Lord neuer ſpoke any ſuch words, much leſſe Saint Peter
himſelf, and if any ſuch thing had been, ſome one of the Apoſtles
would haue written of it, this Article being the foundation
of all the doctrine, and gouernement of the Church.
Moreouer Saint Peter himſelfe would haue Preached the
ſame, and Saint Iohn who ſucceeded and out-liued S. Peter,
would not haue ſtayed in Epheſus. Well then, you ſee that all
the Churches planted by the Apoſtles not excepting any one,
doe teſtifie after many ages, that neither they, nor their fathers
neuer beleeued nor held, that the Primacie by diuine
power, was due to the Church of Rome, but rather that it appertaineth
to whoſoeuer ſhall bee choſen and elected by the
greater part of the Churches: and that the Biſhop of Rome
alone ought not to be q beleeued, much leſſe in his owne proper
cauſe. In like maner many learned men of the Latine
Church doe confeſſe, that the reaſon wherefore Rome is helde
to haue the Primacie in diuine affaires, is an opinion of
the vulgar ſort. So that rather to Conſtantinople appertaineth
the Primacie, ſeeing it was giuen her by the Apoſtolicke
Churches, which they gaue not then to Rome, being one
of the laſt ſeates of Saint Peter, but onely in regard of the
Imperiall ſeate. Well then, to make this the more intelligible,
it is neceſſarie to know how it happeneth, that the Citie
of Rome now a dayes, pretendeth that the Primacie is due to
her by diuine right. The aboue mentioned Apoſtolicke Churches
doe ſurmiſe, as followeth, and ſay.
                  Firſt, that Saint Peter had the firſt place among the Apoſtles,
for he was oftentimes demanded many things by the
Lord, and he anſwered in the name of his fellowes, ouer

whom neuertheleſſe he had no iuriſdiction nor authority:
although that ſome doe thinke, that he reſigned it to Saint
Iames, when they were together at Hieruſalem: after that
S. Iames was inſtituted Biſhoppe, that is to ſay, after that hee
was ſtaied, that hee ſhould make his ordinarie reſidence
there.
                  Secondly, that Saint Iohn during his life, after the time
of S. Peter, had the firſt place amongſt all the Euangeliſts and
Biſhoppes.
                  Thirdly, that he neuer taught that Rome by Diuine right,
ought to be the Miſtreſſe of the other Churches: if he had,
S. Polycarpus his Diſciple, and others his ſucceſſors in Epheſus
had not debated ſo earneſtly and obſtinately againſt
the Roman Church touching the feaſt of Eaſter.
                  Fourthly, that after S. Iohn, the Biſhop of Rome obtained
by iust title, the firſt place among the Biſhops which were vnder
the Romane Empire: for ſeeing that the Citizens of
Rome then raigned ouer the Inhabitants of other Cities: hee
had been both proud, audacious and vnreaſonable, which
would haue preferred himſelfe before their Biſhop, eſpecially
without any ordinance of a Councell.
                  Fiftly, that the churches of Italy, and other their neighbours,
through the laps of time gaue to the Biſhop of Rome,
not only the firſt place, but alſo the ſuperintendancie ouer the
Biſhops neare them, in particular, for to giue his aduice in
matters that happened, till a Synode might be had.
                  Sixtly, that the councell of Nice approued the ſame, and
ordained that Alexandria
                     Alexandria was the greateſt Citie of the Empire after Rome. Ioſeph. l. 4. c. 42.
                      ſhould in like manner, haue the
ouer-ſight of the Churches of Egipt and of Affrica, and that
the church ofAntioch was the third Citie Joſep. bello Iud. lib. 3. there was in this Citie 360. Churches of Chriſtians. 
                     Antioch ſhould ouer-ſee thoſe of the eaſt. And
after a certaine time, becauſe the Emperiall ſeate was tranſported

vnto Conſtantinople, it was ordained that that Biſhop
ſhould be ouer-ſeer of the Greeke Churches, and the Biſhop
of Ieruſalem ſhould be admitted to be one of the fiue, for Paleſtina:
and thoſe fiue were called Patriarches.
                  Seuenthly, that the Biſhop of Rome all this while had the
firſt ſeat, but yet without any vniuerſall iuriſdiction▪ but
rather euery one of the foreſaid fiue Patriarches, iudged or
rather gaue his aduiſe and opinion, till a Councell might be
had, as euen to this day they of Conſtantinople (although
that they call themſelues Oecumenicke) are ſubiect to Synodes,
but yet of Greece onely.
                  Eightly, that Maurice Emperour of Conſtantinople,
would haue taken away the primacie fromThe Grecians doe call him Gregorie Dialoger. 
                     Gregorie Biſhoppe
of Rome, and
                        John neſtentes. That is to ſay, the younger. giuen it to Iohn Biſhop of Conſtantinople,
who for a Marke of his place, deſired to haue the
Title of a generallOecumenicos. Biſhoppe: and that Gregorie did oppoſe
himſelfe againſt him, leaſt he ſhould looſe his place, vrging,
how inſolent that Title was, and ſaying, that Iohn
would vſurpe Dominion ouer the other Biſhops, (which peraduenture
was not the intention of Iohn:) but he on the
contrary ſide, to ſhew that he was contented with the ranke or
place of his predeceſſors, called himſelfe Seruus ſeruorum
Dei. The ſeruant of the ſeruants of God.
                  Ninthly, that Phocas hauing ſlaine Maurice gaue to
the Biſhop of Rome (which was then Boniface) the firſt
ſeate and Title of Generall or Vniuerſall Biſhop, and yet
without any iuriſdiction or Dominion ouer the other patriarches:
which notwithſtanding, the churches acknowledged
him not in that quality.
                  Tenthly, that Charles the great, King of France, hauing
ſubdued with armes a great part of Europe: The citie of

                     Rome craued his ayde againſt the Lombards, who being
ouer come by the ſame King, the Romanes proclaimed him
their Emperour.
                  11 That then the Emperors of the Eaſt with the conſent
of the Patriarchall and Apoſtolicke Churches tooke from
Rome the primacy, and gaue it to the ſaid Church of Conſtantinople.
                  
                  12 That then the Romanes ſeeing that by the Eccleſiaſticall
law they ſhould looſe the primacie, began to ſay that
the primacy belonged as of Diuine right to them, and to their
Biſhop: and conſequently, that the whole Church together
could not take away from them the firſt ranke, becauſe that
Rome is the Sea of S. Peter.
                  
                  13 That after that they of the Eaſt had rightly ſaid,
that hee is ſucceſſor of S. Peter, which is elected, confirmed,
and approued by the greateſt part of the Churches, in
what place ſoeuer he maketh his reſidence, and that imitateth
S. Peter in doctrine and humilitie. That the Biſhoppes of
Rome haue brought into their church many errours, and
haue innouated many things without and againſt the decrees
of the councels, withall they haue added to the Symbole of
Nice of their priuate authority, that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth
from the Sonne, euen as from the Father. That although
that the vniuerſall councell hath giuen the firſt
ſeate to the biſhoppe of Rome: yet did not they beleeue that
the church in future time could not take from him this
place: eſpecially if the church of Rome ſhould fall into any
errour, as they ſay ſhe is already fallen.
                  14 That in the meane while the prouinces of the Empire
of Charles the great, to wit, Fraunce, Italy, Germanie and
Spaine remained vnder the biſhoppe of Rome, as being

their neareſt Patriark, which is the reaſon that they now go about
to perſwade men, that the Primacie appertaineth vnto
him by Gods Law, but this ſhould bee no preiudice to other
Churches, nor to the trueth.
                  15. That the Biſhops of Rome enriched with the gifts
and Donations of the Kings of France, and per aduenture
beleeuing themſelues to be that which was repated of them,
haue ouerthrowne both Spirituall and Temporall Monarkes,
and haue cauſed to bee receiued, in places vnder obedience to
them, as well the Lawes of their predeceſſors the Popes, made
by the Church of Rome, as alſo thoſe Lawes which they
themſelues from time to time doe adde thereunto, in ſomuch
that the Churches of the Eaſt, South, and North, with good
reaſon haue oppoſed themſelues againſt theſe enterpriſes.
The confeſsion and beliefe of the Apoſtolicke Churches about
this Queſtion here in controuerſie, is this.
                  That the firſt ſeate (which is by diuine Law, ſo farr as
is neceſſarie for the order of Councels, and is meete to
ſhewS. Cypr. de ſimpl. cl. vnitie) is by the Eccleſiaſticall Law, as alſo the
Sea that appertaineth to any ſuch Biſhop, whome the
Catholicke Church ſhall iudge to be fit and capable of
ſuch a charge.

done in the life time, and after death. And to the
end that theſe may be true miracles, foure things are
requiſite: firſt, that they be of God, and not framed by
arte, or by the diuell; for miracles are wrought by the
wicked: ſecondly, that they be contrary to nature, as
that of the Rodde of Moſes turned into a Serpent:
thirdly, that they be not wrought by wordes, but thorough
the merites of a man: fourthly, that they be for
the confirmation of the faith.

                     Art. 5. We beleeue that
the word conteined in the Canonicall Writings

proceeded from God. And foraſmuch as it is the very
rule of trueth, it followeth, that neither antiquity, nor
cuſtomes, nor the multitude, nor humane wiſedome,
neither iudgements, nor viſions, nor Miracles ought to
be oppoſed to it.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THe Eaſt Churches doe beleeue, that the Roman and Ethiopian
Churches doe holde an erroneous and Hereticall
opinion, although there are Miracles wrought amongſt
them: In like manner the Romanes doe pronounce an Anathema
againſt all Chriſtians, that haue not obeyed them,
as well againſt them of the Eaſt and South, as alſo the North
Church, notwithſtanding their Miracles: the Church of
Affricke refuſe, nay, ſcorne to goe, and ſubmit or ſubiect
themſelues eyther to the Greeke Church, or to the Latine
Church, notwithſtanding their Miracles: the Latin church
in the foreſaid Canon, dooth confeſſe, that Miracles are
wrought by wicked perſons. The reformed Church ſaith,
that Miracles, or the bruite of Miracles, ought not to be taken
as a Marke of the true church: And which is more,
they beleeue that they are not giuen them for confirmation
of their doctrine, becauſe the ſame is ſufficiently prooued in
the holy Scripture, although that the truth it ſelfe is oftentimes
holden in ſuſpition. If then all the Sects of Chriſtians
doe vaunt themſelues equally to haue Miracles, how can
he that is out of the foreſaid churches, and is willing to become
a good and a true chriſtian, reſolue himſelfe by conſidering
of their Miracles? Surely if euery Nation doe ſay,

that the Miracles which are done amongſt other people, are
not aſſured ſignes, that the doctrine which they teach is altogether
true.
                  We may herethen make this concluſion, as Catholike,
and agreed vpon by all in generall, That miracles
are no prooffes of Doctrine, neither markes of the true
Church.

                     De princ. cap. 3. How abſurd is it, and out of reaſon
to ſay, that euery one of the Apoſtles
was a Paſtor and common Teacher of the
Vniuerſall world, as S. Peter was; and yet
that none of them left any ſucceſſors, but S Peter onely?
becauſe that if any one of the Apoſtles hath left for
his ſucceſſor, eyther Biſhoppes or Gouernours of the
Church, wherein any of them finiſhed his dayes, and
yeelded vp his ſoule to God, vpon what reaſon commandeſt
thou that all ſhould be created by the Pope?
Moreouer, if I ſhould affirme now, that the other Apoſtles
haue left ſucceſſors behinde them, amongſt whom
none was firſt or laſt, but all equal and of one ſelfe ſame
order: peraduenture you would not beleeue me, but if
I ſhall bring you here ſome vnreproueable teſtimonie,
you will not be able to withſtand it. It ſhall be Saint

                     Denis Areopagite in an Epiſtle which he wrote to Demophilus
a Monke, in theſe words: Moderate thou then
thy deſires, thy anger, thy purpoſes, as it is conuenient, to the
end that the holy Miniſters may haue authority ouer thee,
and the Prieſts ouer them, and the Biſhoppes ouer the Prieſts,
and the Apoſtles ouer the Biſhops, the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles:
for if any of them haue committed any fault in his office,
he may be corrected by them of the ſame order. This
man liued in the time of the Apoſtles, and knew exactly the
affaires and buſineſſe of thoſe dayes, which ſaith, that the ſucceſſors
of the Apoſtles, are of one equall order and calling.

                     De notis. Eccl. cap. 8. The fift marke of the Church, is
the ſucceſſion of perſons in the Romane Church,
continuing from the time of the Apoſtles, vntill now:
for that is the reaſon that ſhe is called Apoſtolike. For
if the ancient Fathers haue eſteemed it ſo great an argument
to proue the true Church, by the continuance of
twelue, or twenty, or fortie Biſhops; how much more
ought we to eſteeme the infallible ſucceſſion of more
then 200 Biſhops? eſpecially becauſe we ſee that the
other Apoſtolicke Sees are decayed and failed: that is
to ſay, thoſe of Antioch, Alexandria, and Ieruſalem, wherin,
after that thoſe places were taken away from the Romanes
by the Perſians and Sarraſins (ſithens which time,
there are nine hundred yeares paſt) there hath beene no
ſucceſſion, and if there were any, the ſame was verie obſcure.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  OVr Sauiour being now ready to aſcend to heauen ſaid to
his Apoſtles: Goe through the vniuerſal world, and
preach the Goſpell vnto all
                     Mar. 15. 16 
                     creatures, &amp;c. This commandement
was executed, as may appeare as well in the holy
ſcripture, as alſo in ancient hiſtories, that S. Peter was in
Antioch, S. Andrew in Greece and Moſcouia: S. Iames
kept in Iudea: S. Iohn went into Aſia: S. Philip into Aſſyria:

S. Thomas into India: S. Matthew into Ethiope:
S. Thaddeus into Armenia: S. Paul, called from heauen,
preached in all countries from Arabia vnto Sclauonia.
Wel then, euery one of them left ſucceſſors, and vntil this day
there is not any one of thoſe regions, where there are not
Chriſtian Biſhops, which plead to haue ſucceeded the Apoſtles
without any interruption. Bellarmine ſaith, that if
there be any ſucceſſion, it is obſcure. Others doe anſwer him,
that it was no more obſcure vnder the Perſians and Sarraſins,
then it was in the time of the ancient Biſhops of Rome
vnder the Roman Pagans and perſecuters of the Church.
The Eaſt Churches neuer ceaſe to vaunt and brag of their
Apoſtolicke ſeas. The Chriſtians of Africk doe exalt him of
Alexandria, and acknowledge no other head. The Abyſſines
by antiquity doe hold the ſucceſſion of that ſea ſo certain, that
none amongſt them can haue the impoſition of hands, but by
the hands of him that is eſpecially choſen by the Church,
whom they call Abuna, and whom they doe beleeue to haue
his ſucceſſion from S. Peter and S. Marke the Euangeliſt.
Finally if by perſonall ſucceſsion a man pretend to know the
true Church, he cannot know what part to take: And although
that the Latin Church only had the ſucceſsion without
Interruption, that could not be a ſure marke, ſeeing all
thoſe nations, which S. Ireneus writeth of, do beleeue that the
Roman Church is not the true Church, notwithſtanding
her ſucceſſion. We might here inſert the Catalogue of vniuerſall
Biſhops according to the Greek Church, proceeding
from S. Peter vntill the time of Neophytus, which now
holdeth or latelie held the Sea at Conſtantinople: But we
will omit that for breuitie ſake. This then here ſhall bee the
Catholick concluſion:
                  
                     
That the perſonall ſucceſſion of the Church of
Rome, or of any other, is not the make of a true beleefe.

the greatneſſe or multitude and diuerſitie of the beleeuers:
for the church that is truely Catholike, ought
not onely to comprehend all times, but alſo all places,
all nations, and all ſorts of people. And that our Roman
church is the true Church, may be proued by this argument:
that is, that before the time of Luther, there was
not in the world any more Religions then theſe: that
is to ſay, Paganiſme, Mahometiſme, the Greekes, the

Neſtorians▪ the hereſies of the Huſſites, and the Romane
Church.

one God and one Mediator betwene God and
men Ieſus Chriſt the Meſſias, one holy Ghoſt, one Saluation,
one faith, one couenant: it followeth neceſſarily
that there is but one Church: which is the cauſe that
we call it Catholike, becauſe that it is Vniuerſal and
ſpread through all parts of the world, and extendeth her
ſelfe vnto all times, not being incloſed within any time
or place. We condemne therfore the Donatiſts which
incloſe the Church in a certaine corner of Affrica. And
we approue not the Clergie of Rome, who affirme the
Romane church, to be the onely Catholike Church.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THere are two or three hundreth yeeres paſt, ſince that it
hath beene very hard to iudge by the multitude, whether
the name of the Catholicke Church appertained to the
Greeke Church or the Latine Church. The Greeke Church
had the Empires of Conſtantinople and Trebizonde, and
the Northern nations, who did maintaine her: But now ſhee
is diminiſhed by the oppreſsion of the Turkes, as the Latine
is increaſed by the conqueſts of the Spaniards, farre otherwiſe
then it was heretofore: For Almanie was halfe Pagans,
and Spaine Sarrazins, and this was at ſuch time as

there was diuiſion betweene the Greekes and Latines: So
that if the multitude did giue the Name of Catholickes, the
Grecians ſhould haue had it; and the certaine time when
they loſt this Title is not to be knowen. Notwithſtanding all
this, theſe two Churches and that of the Iacobites, doe profeſſe
themſelues to be Catholickes, the paſſages or proofes before
alleged doe ſhew that euery one of them is extended very
wide. Vnder the name of Iacobites wee will comprehend
the Cophites and the Abysſins, and we may adde thereunto
the Neſtorians: For Maſius telleth vs that theſe people
are rather differing in name, then in Religion: whoſe Teſtimonie
is reported to be very true. The reaſon wherefore
they haue in Ieruſalem diuerſe Churches and Oratories, the
one neere the other, is to the end euery nation might vſe that
language, which he beſt vnderſtandeth. Bellarmine alſo ſeemeth
to account theſe three for one: for it is certaine that
before Luthers time, there were Cophites, Abyſſines,
and Iacobites. The reſt, the ſame Maſius as it were diſchargeth
of the crime of hereſie, which was imputed to them. I
am aſſured (ſaith he)Praef. in Anaph. Baſilij 
                     they are free and exempt from
that wicked Doctrine of that infamous hereticke Neſtor:
For hauing read a great Volume of their ſolemne
Prayers which they make to God, I haue found nothing
that might offend any man of ſound opinion in
our Religion: if it be not this, that I ſuſpect them, becauſe
that they in many places call not the Virgine Marie
mother of God: But inſtead of this Title, they call
her the mother of life, and of light.
                  
                  Here is to bee noted, that Villamont
                     Lib. 2. cap. 24. had ſome notice
that Preſter Iohn had ſent to the Pope, to ſubmit himſelfe to
the Church of Rome, and Cotion the Ieſuite affirmeth

thatDe ſacrifi. the Patriarch of the Cophites had done the like:
But wee haue now freſher newes, and know that there
is no ſuch matter. Well then, if all thoſe people doe
make but one Church, the ſame is as great, or rather greater
and ampler then the Latin Church: and if the multitude be
the marke of the true Church, it muſt be attributed to them,
as the greater number of people. But becauſe it appeareth
not, that either they, or the Greeke Churches, doe constitute
or appoint the multitude for a marke of the true Church,
and that it doth not appeare where that multitude is: moreouer,
becauſe that thoſe which now are fewe in number may
exceed the reſt hereafter, and that the multitude of the Latins,
is not ſo great to induce others to turne to their religion,
we will conclude that according to their beliefe:
                  The multitude of people, or the greatneſſe or largeneſſe
of Regions, are not markes of the true Church.

                     THe confeſsion of Ausburg.
                     Art. 13. There hath beene great
diſputation concerning the authority and power
of Biſhops, wherein ſome haue very ill handled both
the Eccleſiaſticall authority, and the temporall power.
From this confuſion haue ſprung and ariſen great
warres and ſtirres, during the time that the popes relying
vpon the power of the keyes, haue not onely inſtituted
a new manner of worſhip, charging mens conſciences
by reſeruations of caſes, and by violent excommunications;
but alſo they haue attempted to tranſport
the kingdomes of the world, and to take the Empire
from the Emperours: But good men, and thoſe
that were learned in the Church, haue heretofore reproued
theſe things.
               
               
                  THE ROMANE CHVRCH.
                  
                     EXtraua. Vnam ſanctam.
                     De Maior. &amp; obed. Admit that the Grecians, and
others ſay, that the Primacy of the Church was not
giuen to S. Peter and his Succeſſors, then doubtleſſe
they muſt confeſſe, that they are not of the flocke of
Chriſt, who ſaid, that there is one fould, and one ſhepheard.
We are taught by the wordes of the Goſpell, that there
is therein two ſwords, that is to ſay, the one a ſpirituall,

the other temporall. For when the Apoſtles ſaid, Loe,
here are two ſwords, the Lord anſwered not that there
were too many, but ſaid it is enough. Truely he that
denieth, that the temporall ſword is not in the power
of S. Peter, taketh very little regard to the wordes of the
Lord, who ſaid: Put vp thy ſword into the ſheath: the one
and the other is therefore in the power of the Church,
to wit, the ſpirituall and the materiall: and both ſwords
ought to be gouerned by the Church, the one by the
Prieſts, the other by the hands of kings and men of war,
but according to the will and permiſſion of the Prieſts,
for the one ſword muſt be vnder the other ſword.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THe Biſhop of Rome was obedient in times paſt to the
Emperours of Conſtantinople, but after ſuch time as
the Citie of Rome was taken away from the Emperours of
of the Eaſt, and King Charles ſur-named the great, had receiued
from the ſaid Biſhop the title of Emperour: He and
his ſucceſſors grewe ſo much obliged to the ſame Sea of
Rome, that the Popes perſwaſion ioyned with their deuotion,
hath cauſed that they haue giuen the higher place to
them, which ought, as their predeceſſors did, to ſhew themſelues
obedient to the ſecular power. Notwithſtanding this,
when the Latin Monarches ſaw their authority too much abated,
they could not ſuffer this indignity: from thence aroſe
thoſe diſorders which all Europe hath ſeene vnder the Frederickes,
Henries, Philip, ſur-named the Faire, the factions
of the Guelphes and Gibellines, and ſuch like Tragedies.
Our Realme of France hath vnto this preſent maintained

ſome liberties, which were heretofore purloyned and
taken away from Italy, Spaine, and England. But now ſhe
foſtereth and nouriſheth in her boſome ingratefull children,
who daiely endeuour and ſeeke to receiue the Councell of
Trent. Beſides, if the Emperours of Germany haue oppoſed
themſelues againſt the attempts of Rome, the Grecians
haue paſſed farre beyond them. The Pope would haue taken
away before this time the Title of Emperour from the Emperour
of Greece. The Gretian by the conſent of the Apoſtolike
Sea had tranſported into the Eaſt S. Peters Chaire:
and notwithſtanding the Anathemes and inforcements of
the Romane Court, the Empire of the Eaſt was maintained
many ages, that is to ſay, vntill the yeare 1453. A fatall end,
at which time the prophecie of Daniel ſhould be accompliſhed:
He ſhall plant the Tabernacles of his Palace betweene
the Seas in the glorious and holy Mountaine,
                     Dan. 12. 45.
                     yet he ſhall come to his end, and none ſhall helpe him.
Vntill that time, this Empire was not held but from God,
and by the ſword: as the Gloſſe of the Canon Si Imperator,
The Emperour (ſay ſome men) hath not his authority
from the Pope, but from God onely: and the ſame doe
I likewiſe allow of: But where is that true Emperour?
It is he of Conſtantinople; for the other, that is to ſay, he
of Germany, is but a maintainer and defender of the
Church of Rome.
                  I muſt not paſſe ouer with ſilence, how the Romanes doe open
iniury to Charles the great, King of Fraunce, ſaying,
that the Pope gaue him the Empire of the Weſt, which is moſt
falſe and vntrue: for Charles obtained it by Armes, and
had conquered and brought the Citie of Rome it ſelfe into
ſubiection, if it had pleaſed him, or if they had not

willingly yeelded themſelues vnto him. If hee ſubmitted
himſelfe to the Pope, it was of curteſie and deuotion, and not
of any duetie. As for the Chriſtians of the Eaſt they haue
beene called Melchites, that is to ſay, Royaliſts orMelech a King. 
                     Imperialiſts,
becauſe that they haue neuer acknowledged none, no
not the greateſt man in the World, but the imperiall Maieſtie.
In like manner the Chriſtians of Affrica are alſo
Melchites. The auncient Catholike Church was Melchite
more then ſeuen hundred yeares: for there was neuer any
Councell where the Emperour had not the higheſt place, or
that the Popes of Rome yeelded not their due obedience. The
holy Apoſtles haue alſo beene Melchites, yea our Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt himſelfe, for he payed tribute aswell for himſelfe,
as for S. Peter.
                  
                  Likewiſe in the eſtate of the Iſraelites, an eſtate ordained
of God, the Prieſtly Soueraigntie bowed to the ſecular authoritie,
although that that high ſacrificer had an vnlimited
iuriſdiction, and that he was the repreſentatiue Image of the
great and eternall Sacrificer Ieſus. And as thoſe that ranke
the high Prieſt vnder Emperours and Kings, are Royaliſts
and Emperialiſts, in like manner in our time the reformed
Chriſtians haue called thoſe of the contrary opinion Papiſts:
as who would ſay, ſubiects of a Prieſt, for in Greeke, Papa
ſignifieth a Prieſt: a name neuertheleſſe which doth not properly
belong but to thoſe that beleeue, that the Pope hath
power to iudge and depoſe Kings. By this which hath bene ſpoken,
a man may ſee that the Imperialiſts are Catholikely
ſpread through the foure quarters of the world, and that
their beliefe in this point hath bene from the beginning:
therefore he that is a Melchite, is a Catholike: and whoſoeuer
holdeth a contrary opinion is an Hereticke. It is this

hereſie, that keepeth the kingdome of Nauarre vnder the
Spaniſh yoke. It is this hereſie that brought that frowning
fortune into our France, and had bene the ruine of her, if
her great and inuincible Melech ſeconded by faithfull Melchites,
otherwiſe called Polititians, had not preſerued and defended
her, with the grace and aſsiſtance of him, which is the
onely giuer and tranſlater of Monarchies. It is this Hereſie
that the moſt Puiſſant and mightie King of Great Britaine,
indeuoreth to quench &amp; aboliſh in the hearts of his ſubiects,
a hereſie which for a while lyeth hid vnder aſhes, but meeting
with any proper matter, will breake into a great combuſtion.
Euery one may here ſee, that the moſt part of Chriſtians
doe reiect this opinion, yea, the RomanesFr Paul of Venice in Apologie. themſelues,
although they ſuffer the Pope of Rome to maintaine it in the
Canons.
                  
                     Wee will then conclude according to the generall voice,
That the Primate of the Catholike Church, whether
he be at Conſtantinople, or at Rome, or at Alexandria,
hath no power or authoritie ouer Temporall Common-wealthes.

leſſe the whole bodie of the Scripture, as if

it were too ſhort, No, it is not vttered openly and plainely,

as great a fault, as to accuſe God, but God is voyd of
all blame.

proceedeth onely from the Father: the which they beleeue
(ſay they) becauſe that the GoſpellIohn 15. which containeth
wholy the Faith (that is to ſay, the doctrine of
the faith) maketh mention of the Father onely.

their delegation or Commiſſion, how had it bene
knowen to the world, that they were ſent to men?

that they receiue from the Greeke Doctors, conditionally
that they find nothing therein, contrary to their
owne opinion.
                  
                     Annot. The Chriſtians of the Eaſt are marueilous
iealous of the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Fathers,
neuertheleſſe they hold that the Scripture is neceſſarie,
againſt thoſe that ſay that the Church may erre. Moreouer
they hold the ſame ſufficient and a rule of Faith:
and therefore admit not altogether the Greeke and Latin
Doctors, but iudge of their doctrine: which they
could not doe but by examining it by the rule of
Scripture.
               
               
                  
                  THE SOVTH CHVRCH.
                  A Luares.
                     Cap. 31. It was demaunded of me, whether all
thoſe things (that is to ſay the cuſtomes of the Romane
Church) were contained in our Bookes, and whether
they ſeemed better vnto me, then thoſe which they
vſe. I anſwered that I found our bookes reduced into a
better order, then their bookes were: becauſe that ſince
the time of the Apoſtles, wee haue had alwayes great
maſters and teachers, which were neuer imployed in any
other vocation, but to compoſe and gather together
the holy Scriptures, and paſſages of the Prophets
and Apoſtles, ſcattered in many volumes. They replied
vnto me, that they had foureſcore and one bookes
of the olde and new Teſtament, and asked whether we
had more: I anſwered, that we had tenne times more,
drawne and extracted out of the olde and new Teſtament,
enriched with many expoſitions, wherein was
contained very deepe doctrine. Preſter-Iohn cauſed one
to tell me, that he was not ignorant of the great quantitie
of bookes which we haue; but that he deſired verie
much to know their names.
                  
                     Damianus a Goes.
                     De indor. leg. art. 11. The Abyſsins ſay, that they haue
all the writings of Moſes and the Prophets, and other
bookes of the old Teſtament: the foure Euangeliſts,
and all the Epiſtles of S. Paul, and that they want not any
booke of the holy Scripture, whereof they recyted a
Catalogue in my preſence.
                  Neuertheleſſe the Biſhop Zaga an Ethiopian, ſeemeeth
to count the bookes of the Bible otherwiſe: for he
ſaith, that in the new Teſtament there are fiue and thirtie:

peraduenture he comprehends thoſe which Aluars
ſaith, that they call Manda and Abetilis, diuided into
eight parts: but the ſame Abyſsins doe beleeue, that
the holy Scripture is ſufficient for ſaluation without
thoſe: for they denie not the name of true Chriſtians,
to thoſe that haue not thoſe bookes, and therefore they
hold them not to be of equall authority with the other.
                  The ſame Authour ſaith, that the Abyſsins beleeue
not that there is any power, whether Councel, or whatſoeuer
able to make lawes, which binde the conſcience,
much leſſe ſuch doctrine as is not grounded vpon the
Scripture.
                  
                     Annot. The Ethiopians are of the opinion of the
Reformed, if they meane thoſe foure-ſcore and one
bookes which are in the Volume of the Bible: for the
ſame number is to be found if one reckon the Epiſtle of
Ieremie for one booke by it ſelfe, and if one doe ſeperate
the Hiſtories which are not found but in Greeke, added
to the bookes of Daniel and Heſter. Moreouer it is to
be noted, that the Abyſsins do limite that which they
holde for the word of God, within the number of foure
ſcore and one bookes (againſt the opinion of the word
not written) and they demand if the faſhion and manner
of celebrating the Maſſe is to be found in the holy
Scripture. Aluares a Roman Catholik anſwereth them
cleane beſides the matter: ſaying, that the Romane
Church hath Doctors and Teachers, which haue a doctrine
farre greater and more perfect, then that of the
olde and new Teſtament. The Reformed Church ſubſcribe
not willingly to this Article, for they

make a contrary Article, as hereafter followeth.

                     Art. 5. We do beleeue
that the word which is conteined in theſe bookes,
proceedes from God, of whom it taketh his authority,
and not of men. And foraſmuch as it is the rule of all
truth and verity, conteining all that is neceſſary for the
ſeruice of God and our ſaluation, it is not lawfull for
men, neither for the Angels themſelues to adde, diminiſh,
or change it.

                     In 4. Sent. d. 24. q. 2. It is to be noted, that wee doe hold many
things to be diuine Law, which are not expreſly conteined
in the Diuine law (to wit in the holy Scripture)
neyther may they euidently be deduced from thence:
As for example, not to ordaine a woman to be Prieſt,
or the inſtitution of any one order. In like manner, we
read not in the new Teſtament (and much leſſe in the
old) that the ſoueraigne Biſhopricke was graunted to
the Succeſſors of S. Peter: yet notwithſtanding, wee
hold, the ſoueraigne Biſhopricke is by Diuine law.
                  
                     The councell of Trent.
                     4. Seſſ. decret. 1. The Councell ſeeing, that
this veritie is conteined partly in written bookss, and
partly in Traditions not written, doth receyue and honour
with equall affection, pietie, and deuotion, aſwell
all the bookes of the old and new Teſtament, as alſo all

Traditions which appertaine as well to faith as to good
manners.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  FIrſt, the Romane Catholickes (eſpecially) when they would
ſerue their turnes with the ſayings of the Fathers againſt
the Proteſtants, doe not diſtinguiſh the doctrine of faith,
from Eccleſiaſticall policie, which the Grecians call 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
The Proteſtants doe beleeue that all matters of
Faith may bee ſufficiently taken out of the holy Scripture:
And that, that which belongs to Policie, Ceremonie, and
Circumſtances, hath bene let go by Tradition not written;
ſuch Tradition which may bee changed by the Catholicke
Church, that is to ſay, by the mutuall conſent &amp; good will of all
Chriſtian people; in like manner by the particular Churches,
vnder the conſent and good liking of the Catholicke Church.
In ſum, that the Scripture is the rule of the faith of the Catholicke
Church, as the Catholicke Church is the rule of the
members thereof, in that which concernes Policie or outward
worſhip.
                  Secondly, the foreſaid Maior is deceiued in ſaying, that
the Scripture prohibiteth not, to ordaine women Preſts: the
prohibition is in Saint Paul,
                     1. Tim. 2. 11. as for the orders or inferiour
offices of Prieſthood,1. Cor. 14. 34. they are of meere Policie. And as
touching the ſoueraigntie of the Biſhop or Pope of Rome, it
is certaine that the Scripture maketh no mention of it, alſo
Tradition of the Catholicke Churches doth contradict it. It
is obiected that the Scripture maketh no mention of the perpetuall
virginitie of the Mother of our Sauiour. Wherevnto

ſome men anſwere, that itSmith apud P. Vermil. Martyrem de caelib. may be gathered out of the
Scripture, and that whereas the holy virgine is called bleſſed
among all women, if ſhe had not beene alwayes a virgine,
other virgines ſhould haue excelled her in bleſſedneſſe▪
                     He that marrieth doth well (ſaith Saint1. Cor. 7. 38. 
                     Paul) but hee
that marrieth not, doth better: well then, thoſe that haue
done beſt ſhall bee most bleſſed in heauen. Now if any man
will reſtraine her felicity in regard that ſhee bore our Sauiour,
he muſt giue an account of that reſtraint.
                  Thirdly, the Cardinall ofContra Tillenum. Perron ſaith that the holy
Scripture is ſufficient to ſaluatiō, becauſe it doth ſend vs back
vnto the Church, and the Church teacheth that which particularly
is wanting in the Scripture: But if that were ſo, the
holy Scripture ſhould bee manifeſtly imperfect and inſufficient:
for if the Scripture teacheth vs not, where is the head,
(as Maior auoucheth) how may one know by it the body of
the Church? And for to deſcant vpon the compariſon of
the ſame Cardinall, if the King ſhould ſay to one, my Chauncellour
ſhall tell you the reſt, and then many ſhould ariſe for to
ſpeake; vnto whom ſhould hee hearken? whom ſhould be beleeue
to be the true Chauncellour? Our Sauiour neuer
ſaid, that the Church ſhould continue in Italy or in France;
and that it ſhould faile in other Countries. Moreouer, it is
certaine, that our Sauiour knew all things, yet not as a bare
man, but by participation of the heauenly wiſedome: neuertheleſſe
he reuealed not all things to his Apoſtles. And the
Apoſtles knew things which were not lawfull for them to
declare: but they might happily declare farre more to their
Diſciples, then they haue written, to wit, many diſcourſes,
miracles, and other particularities of the life and doctrine
of the Lord, which got them a farre more▪ great and perfect

knowledge in Diuinitie. Moreouer there haue beene very
many profitable things for the gouernment of the Church,
which were not written, but are come to their ſucceſſors by
Tradition. But as concerning that which is properly belonging
to faith, and neceſſary as well for the Church in generall,
as for the particulars thereof, the Catholicke Church beleeueth,
That the holy Scripture is ſufficient to ſaluation.

bookes they held authenticall, and that he thought they
were in Hebrew. It is well knowen that the Abyſſins
doe retaine very much of the old law, and therefore one
ought not to thinke it ſtrange, if thoſe that call themſelues
Iſraelites, do conforme themſelues to the antient
Church of Iſrael.

                     hauing accounted amongſt the
other auncient Canonicall bookes, thoſe which otherwiſe
ſome doe call the ſecond Canonicall, to wit Iudith, Wiſedome,
and the Maccabees, ſaith thus: If there be any one that
will not receiue for good and Canonicall theſe bookes
all whole and entire, which haue beene accuſtomed to
be read in the Romane Catholike Church, let him be
accurſed.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THe foreſaid people of the Eaſt and South, and the reformed
of the Weſt ſay, that our Sauiour and his Apoſtles
after him, haue receiued for holy Scripture, and perfectly
authenticall, but onely thoſe bookes which were and haue
beene ſince in the Canon of the Hebrewes: wherein the books
of the Maccabees, VViſedome, and the third and fourth booke
of Eſdras are not conteined. That the Authours of theſe
bookes were not as the Prophets inſpired of God, who confirmed

their doctrine with Miracles: this is the cauſe why the
Church in that time receiued the one into the Canonicall
authoritie and not the other. That the Catholike Church
(much leſſe the Romane) cannot make newe Articles of
Faith. To affirme, that the Auncient Church knewe not
nor taught the verity in that behalfe, and that the
Church hath had ſince new reuelations, is an abſurd thing. In
fine, that they firſt which numbred theſe Deutero-canonicall
or Eccleſiaſticall with the Propheticall, intended not to
equalize them, but rather thought good to put them in the
Volume of the holy Bible, becauſe that there are good precepts
in them, and Hiſtories whereby one may ſee the eſtate of the
Church, after the time of the Prophees, vntill the comming
of the Redeemer. The Councell of Trent doth hold likewiſe
for Apocrypha, and in ſuſpect the 4. book of Eſdras, although
it be in the volume of the Bible. There are alſo learned
men of great account in the Catholike Romane Church, as
Cardinall Caietane, Nicholas de Lyra, and others, which
hold not the bookes of Maccabees for authenticall books. And
the generall voyce is, that
                  The bookes of Wiſedome, Syrach, the third and
fourth of Eſdras, the Maccabees and others (although
that they may perhaps call them Canonicall) haue not
equall authority with the bookes of the Prophets and
Apoſtles.

The writings of the Apoſtles are otherwiſe

diuided into many epiſtles.

that no ſmal profit would redound to the Church,
if of many Latine editions of the holy Scriptures one
were knowne to be Authenticke, doth ordaine and declare

that the ſame vulgar edition bee held for ſuch,
and that none be ſo bold to reiect it, vpon what pretence
ſoeuer.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THe Authour of the vulgar Latin tranſlation is not knowen:
The Romane Catholikes ſay, that it is the labour
of S. Ierome. The Reformed Churches doe thinke that S.
Ierome was not the Authour thereof. Neuertheleſſe the
Councell of Trent doth authoriſe it. Cardinall Bellarmine
affirmeth, that that Tranſlation is true, and that the originall
is corrupted: But there are many Romane
                        Ʋatable, Arias Mont. Aug Eugub. and others. Catholikes,
which doe hold the Catholike beleefe, and haue made newe
Tranſlations, and conſequently corrected the vulgar. Thoſe
of the Eaſt Churches hold, that onely the Greeke Originals,
written by the Apoſtles are authenticall. And as touching
the bookes of the old Teſtament, they allow of the Tranſlation
which is called the Tranſlation of the ſeuentie, or of
Ptolomeus. Neuertheleſſe, they hold it not for a certainty,
that thoſe be altogether the tranſlation of the ſeuenty, which
carry that name. It is thought that the Apoſtles did vſe
the Tranſlation of the ſaid ſeuenty, the which neuertheleſſe
was not altogether comformable with the Hebrew: but if
they haue approued it, then it followeth, that there was not
any errour, in that they haue alledged it: Moreouer the
Hebrew text is preferred before all other Tranſlations.
                  The Latines doe obiect, that it is not reaſonable to receiue
the Hebrew Bible of the Iewes. The Greekes doe anſwere,
that our Sauiour and his Apoſtles had the Hebrew
Bible, and that they left the ſame to their ſucceſſors, from

whom thoſe of this preſent time haue receiued it from hand
to hand, and not from the vnbeleeuing Iewes, and therefore
the vulgar tranſlation was taken from the Hebrew. It followeth
therefore, that the Hebrew was then in the Church:
or elſe that the Romane Church hath taken it from the
Iewes.
                  
                     Maſius

the Syrian tranſlation, of one Theodorus: peraduenture
they intend not to preferre or equalize it with the originall
Hebrew; and that the Grecians, the Moſcouites, the Abyſſines,
and the Armenians, would attribute each one of
them, to the tranſlation vſed in their Church, as much as
the Latins doe attribute to theirs: which would be but ſo many
particular opinions, each one of them being reiected by
the other: and therfore the Catholicke &amp; aſſured opinion is,
                  That the Latin tranſlation of the Romane Church,
or any other, hath not equall authority with the originall
Hebrew and Greeke of the Prophets and Apoſtles.

regard thereof they are the men, that truely and purely

preached and taught vnto them by the Apoſtles.

are not permitted to truſt vpon our owne particular
interpretation, or to vnderſtand or teach: but only that
which agreeth with the holy Councels and Doctors of
the Church: for feare that being once drawen or ledde
out of the way of the Euangelicall doctrine, and the
path of true wiſedome and vnderſtanding, we do erre,
and that our iudgement be tranſported as an other Proteus,
one while to one faſhion of beleefe, another while
to another. Well, ſome of you will demaund (peraduenture)
by what meanes may a man attaine to this?
That ſhall he doe by the aide and aſſiſtance of God, if he
doe attempt nothing, and follow but that which hath
bene ordained by the Apoſtles, and holy Councels. For
he that doth well and conſtantly continue within theſe
limits, ſhall march the very ſame pace, and be of the very
ſame faith and Communion with vs.

that all Doctrine and Diſcipline is contained in
Bookes written, and Traditions not written, following

of the faith, doth receiue and honour with equal

doe appertaine as well to faith, as to good manners, as
hauing beene ſpoken eyther by the mouth of Ieſus

                  ANNOTATION.
                  THere is no part of Chriſtendome that holde not themſelues
to haue the beſt forme of gouernement. The three
principall (that is to ſay) the Grecians, Romanes, and Abiſſins
or Aethiopians doe claime their Traditions from
the Apoſtles, notwithſtanding that they are found eyther
to be different or contrary: but in Hiſtories their Original
is to be ſeen, eſpecially the Traditions of the Grecians and
Latines. As touching thoſe of the Abiſſins or Aethiopians,
it is harder to find out the Authours: Neuertheleſſe
they haue receiued ſome of the Greekes and Latines in
the time of Iuſtinian the Emperour, as hereafter ſhall be
ſaid: But the moſt part of their ceremonies are taken from
the law ofScal. de emen. temp. in Eph. Eccl. Eth. 
                     Moſes. The Reformed ChriſtiansThe confeſſion of Beza. part. 7 ſay, that if

ceremonies muſt be, it is more conuenient to obſerue thoſe
which God hath in times paſt ordained, then to receiue any
Paganiſme ſuperſtition.
                  That which brought moſt nouelties into the Latine
Church, is the authority which is giuen to one alone: for euery
Pope would leaue ſome remembrance of faith: from
hence do proceed ſo many canonized ſaints, and faſhions to honour
them, feaſts, pilgrimages, Religions, or orders of monks
and friars, and ſuch like blind deuotion, wherein the Latins
haue ſurpaſſed all people: who accuſe the foreſaid Latines of
preſumption, becauſe they would make to paſſe for Catholike,
thoſe cuſtomes which were neuer ordained by the ſeuen
vniuerſall Councels. They of the Eaſt Church require the
obſeruation of thoſe of the generall Councels, but not of any
particular. The Reformed Chriſtians doe proteſt, that they
diſpute not againſt Catholike cuſtomes,Melanchton ad Lang. but againſt abuſe and
ſuperſtition: or if any thing diſpleaſeth them, it is the multitude
of ceremonies, rather then any one of them conſidered
in particular. It is true, that in reiecting thoſe that haue
beene brought onely in by the Church of Rome, they haue
not ſpared the Catholike ceremonies.De concilijs. 
                     Luther thought
that all Chriſtian nations would reforme themſelues, the one
after the other, and alſo that, that which ſeemed to be a particular
attempt, would be corroborated and confirmed by a
Catholike approbation. Howſoeuer it be, the learned and
greateſt men amongſt them doe proteſt to ſubmit themſelues
to a generall and free Councell. The Frenchmen likewiſe
who haue of late time begun, and had leſſe means giuen them
to errect or inſtitute ſuch an eſtate and forme of Church, as is
to be ſeene in other Countries, haue neuertheleſſe proteſted
in like manner in the conference at Poiſſy, that it would be

eaſier for them to fall into accord in ceremonies, if the differences
in doctrine were once appeaſed. So it is, that the contempt
of Catholicke Gouernment doth get the ſaid Reformed
Chriſtians an euill opinion among other Chriſtians.
And that produceth two effects, the one, that the ſaid Proteſtants
conſidering ceremonies, but as outward ſhewes, (and
the Romane CatholickesMatth. hiſtoriogr. 1. 6 diſc. 5. doe confeſſe that ceremonies haue
iuſtly that name) doe condemne the cuſtomes of other nations,
without diſcerning thoſe that are Catholike from other
more particular; or that are profitable and tollerable from
thoſe that are euill and naught. And the other ſeeing themſelues
diſpiſed and contemned without reaſon, perſwade
themſelues that it is all one, when one reprehendeth them in
a matter concerning faith. Saint Paul ſaith, that ſuch ceremonies
haue appearance of holines, in that they ſpare not the
body, and haue no regard to cloath or feede the ſame: but hee
ſaid not, that they ſhould abandon all Ceremonies, rather (ſayd
he) he that eateth doth well, and he that eateth not, doth likewiſe
well: much leſſe hath he approued that one ſhould rent
aſunder, or condemne the Catholike Church.
                  The other effect of condemning the Catholicke Church is,
that a man cannot (now a dayes) read the writings of the
ancient Fathers, nor the Hiſtories of the Apoſtolicke Churches,
no not the holy Scripture it ſelfe, without finding very
many ceremonies and faſhions of ſpeaking not vſed amongſt
the Proteſtants of France: from whence it happeneth that
many doe change their beleefe, being offended at the contemning
of Councels, as it is ſeene by their writings and conuerſations:
and on the other ſide they of the Romane Church
which doe relie too much vpon outward ceremonies, are more
and more confirmed in their opinion, preſuming that they

follow and ymitate in all things the holy Scriptures and the
Fathers: nay the moſt learned and thoſe that approue not in
all points the Romane Church, doe not thinke it in any wiſe
reaſonable to preferre the aduiſe or opinion of ſome particular
and new writers, before the iudgement of auncient
Councels, in that which concernes the Policie of the Church.
Heere it is to bee marked, that the moderne Chronicles in
writing the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie, doe cauſe the readers very
often to erre. They write the names of the auncient Biſhops of
Romein Capitall letters, naming them alone, and recounting
their actes &amp; liues, &amp; they gather their lawes, ordinances, &amp;
decrees, and make no mention of the Canons which the other
Biſhops haue made in their Churches: from thence grew the
opinion, that the ſaid Biſhops of Rome were Monarchs of all
the world, as the Emperours haue bene in temporall matters
of their Empire: and that ſuch Lawes, Traditions, and Decrees
(which were but onely for the Church of Rome) were
lawes giuen to the Catholicke Church, which is not ſo. For it
hath bene but of very late yeeres, that France, Spaine, Germanie
and England haue receiued them, that is to ſay, three
or foure hundreth yeres ſince: as for other nations they haue
not receiued and approued the ſame as yet, but haue inuented
others. In fine the reformed ChriſtiansDaneus in lib. de haere. ſay, that the eſtate
of the Church hath bene tollerable, during the fiue firſt ages,
and they approue not Aerius, and ſuch like, which in times
paſt troubled the Church in reiecting the Eccleſiaſticall cuſtomes:
and from thence it followeth, that the Cuſtomes receiued
during thoſe firſt ages, are not thoſe which haue
brought, or doe nouriſh the Schiſme in Chriſtendome, and
therefore all nations doe auowe,
                  That Catholicke Traditions ought to be receiued, if

the ineſtimable good of peace and agreement might
thereupon enſue: alwayes prouided, that you comprehend
not vnder the name of Catholicke, thoſe which
onely belong to the Greeke Church, or the Latin, or
the Abyſſin, Aethiopian, Armenian, or any other particular
Churches.

                     De proceſſione Spiritus ſancti. You ſee how many abſurdities doe ariſe on
euery ſide, if it bee concluded that the holy
Ghoſt doth proceede from the Father, and
from the Sonne. Hold not an euill opinion in the name
of the Lord. For if the Latins, the Church of Rome
and others, doe bring approued witneſſes, as it ſeemeth
likely to them, that is to ſay Auguſtine, Ambroſe, and Ierome,
we likewiſe can produce farre more, and more
worthy of credit. All which haue pronounced that the
holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father onely, and
haue prohibited vpon paine of a grieuous Anathema,
to hold any other beleefe.

CHVRCH.
                  
                     THe confeſsion of faith by the Councell of Trent.
                     Seſſ. 3. decret. 1. We
beleeue in the holy Ghoſt, the Lord and giuer of
life, which proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne,
which is worſhipped and glorified, together with the
Father and the Sonne, who ſpake by the Prophets.

                     Formul. Bapt. I beleeue in
one holy Ghoſt liuing, which giueth life vnto all,
who proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne.
                  
                     The King of Aethiope.
                     Epiſt. of Dauid. In the name of God the Father
Almightie Creator of all things, viſible and inuiſible:
In the name of God the Sonne Ieſus Chriſt,
which is one with the Father, light of lights: In the
name of the holy Ghoſt, God liuing which proceedeth
from the Father, I am King, &amp;c.

                     THe Engliſh Confeſsion. Wee beleeue that the holy
Ghoſt which is the third perſon in the holy Trinity,
is very God, not made nor created, nor begotten, but
proceeding from the one and from the other: to wit,
from the Father and the Sonne, in a manner vnknowen
and vnſpeakeable of men.
               
               
                  
                  ANNOTATION.
                  LOmbard ſurnamed Maſter by the Schoole Doctors of the
Latin Church
                     Li. 1. diſt. 1. 
                     ſaith as followeth, touching the differē
                        ces
between the Grecians and the Latins in this queſtion. The
Grecians ſay that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth frō the Father
only, and not frō the Son: which they hold, becauſe
that the truth in the Goſpel, which cōtaineth wholy the
faith, ſpeaking of the proceſſion of the holy Ghoſt, maketh
mention onely of the Father, and alſo that in the
principalleſt Councels which were celebrated with
them, their Symbols or Credes haue bene ſo fortified
by the Anathemaes added, that it is not lawfull for any
man to teach any thing touching the Trinitie otherwiſe
then is therein contained: in which Symbole or
Creede, the holy Ghoſt is fayd to proceede from the
Father, and not from the Sonne: And therfore (ſay they)
all thoſe are Anathema, that doe affirme that he proceedeth
from the Sonne: and a little after. Wee doe
conclude that the Grecians doe accord with the Latins
in the matter it ſelfe, although that they differ in
words.
                  Behold here the opinion of the Maſter of ſentences, who
to ſhew that there is no difference betweene the Greekes and
the Latins in that point, doth onely report the ſayings and
ſentences of the ancient Grecians, who ſay: that the holy
Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne. But that
hath not ſatisfied his followers, which thinke that the modern
Gretians hold not the beleefe of the ancient: beſids ſome
of the Latin Doctors doe confeſſe, that they vnderſtand not
well the intention and meaning of the Grecians, others doe

call them Heretickes and Schiſmatikes. The reformed
Churches doe leaue this queſtion with the ſame irreſolution.
                  
                     We reiect (ſaith Tilenus) the errour, or as others
tearme it, the
                     Logomamachiè, ſtrife about words. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     of the moderne Grecians. This
difference hath beene the cauſe, or at leaſt wiſe the pretext of
the Schiſme betwixt the East Churches and the VVeſt. The
Eaſt Churches who would tranſport the Primacie to Conſtantinople,
pretending that the Pope of Rome abuſeth the
Church, doe take occaſion to accuſe the Pope vpon this Article
(that Pope, was Nicholas the firſt, by the report of Bellarmine,
who alledgethDe Chriſto l. 2. c. 21. 
                     Anthoninus or Adrianus as ſome
will haue it) becauſe that he had beene ſo bolde as to adde of
his owne authoritie to the Symbole of Nice, that the holy
Ghoſt proceedeth from the ſonne: and becauſe (peraduenture)
he hath not expounded it fully, they of the Eaſt haue
accuſed the Latines of conſtituting two principles: and the
Latines laying the fault vpon them, doe impute vnto them
blaſphemie, ſaying, that they did derogate from the Diuinity
of the Sonne of God. Lombard and others ſay, that the difference
is in words, and not in the matter it ſelfe. Peraduenture
the Grecians doe denie the proceſsion of the holy Ghoſt
to be from the ſonne in one conſideration, and the Latines do
affirme it in another: for to know if it be ſo, wee are conſtrained
to enter into very curious conſiderations of Diuinitie.
It is therefore neceſſary to marke, that the ſonne is
conſidered three manner of waies:
                  Firſt as being the Diuine eſſence, and the very ſame
eſſence with the Father: hoc ſenſu filius non ſpirat: for
the actions are of the perſons, and not of the eſſence conſidered
apart.
                  
                     
Secondly, the Sonne is to be conſidered as a Sonne, and that
formally; So the Sonne produceth not the holy Ghoſt; for he
which is produced, ſo farre as hee is produced, produceth
not.
                  In the third place the Sonne is to be conſidered as a perſon:
and that is it which S. Auſten regarded, when he ſaide,
that the Sonne hath from the father, not onely to be ſonne,
but alſo to be, or his being: that is to ſay, to be a diſtinct perſon,
not to be ſimply the Diuine eſſence: for the Sonne hath
the ſame ofBellar. de Chriſto lib. 2. cap. 19. himſelfe, and the perſon begetteth not the eſſence,
but the eſſence begetteth the perſon: and if the ſonne
produce not in this maner (that is to ſay) as a perſon, then the
holy Ghoſt proceedes not from the Sonne in any wiſe: for as
it hath beene ſaid, the holy Ghoſt proceeds not from the Sonn,
eyther as an eſſence, or as a Sonne.
                  Well then, if the Grecians ſay not that he (to wit the holy
Ghoſt) proceedeth from the eſſence of the Sonne, being ſimply
taken, neyther from the Sonne as a Sonne, the Latines ſhould
not take occaſion to condemne them, ſeeing that they ſay the
ſame.
                  But becauſe the Grecians ſay, and that according to the
Goſpell, that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father: it
is manifeſt, that they denie not the proceſsion of the holy
Ghoſt to be from the Sonne, becauſe he proceedeth not from
him, either as an eſſence, or as a Sonne: for if that were
ſo, they ſhould denie in like manner his proceſsion to be from
the father: for the father produced not the holy Ghoſt as an eſſence
ſimply (for the eſſence produceth not:) neither as a father,
for if he had produced him as a father, the holy Ghoſt
ſhould be then his ſonne.
                  The Grecians doe hold, that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth

from the father in ſuch a ſort as he cannot be ſaide to proceede
from the ſonne. And they haue reaſon to ſay ſo, becauſe
the holy Ghoſt is in the perſon, and from the perſon of
the Sonne, the which the father hath begotten as a ſonne: and
the father begot not a Sonne, which had not the holy Ghoſt,
and his productiue grace and fertility: Likewiſe the father
is the cauſe (the Greeke Doctors do vſe this word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) of the
holy Ghoſt, both as a perſon primo &amp; per ſe, and as a father
per filium. But the Sonne inſpireth not as a ſonne, primo
&amp; per ſe, neyther in producing another perſon, which ſhould
produce the holy Ghoſt. This obſeruation remaineth obſcure,
if it be taken without diſtinction, that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth
from the Father and from the Sonne: alſo the Grecians
ſhould ſeeme to ſpeake more properly then the Latines.
The auncient Doctors confeſſe that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth
from the father proprie: as hee ſpeaketh more properly,
which ſaith, the King commandeth, then he that ſaith, the
King goeth: for the commandement proceedeth from the
King, as a King, but the King goeth as he is a man. If then
the Sonne be an inſpirer, the Father is the cauſe, euen as a father.
But becauſe that the Grecians do abſolutely denie that
the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Sonne, denying thereby
that his perſon is an inſpirer: a man muſt take heede leaſt he
fall into a 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : for if by the word proceede, they vnderſtand
to haue his originall or beginning, they ſay not ill,
conſidering the Father alone is the beginning. The Diuines
doe confeſſe as much, when they call the Sonne Principium
quaſi Secundarium. This word Secundarium deſtroieth
the name of Principium, and the word quaſi, ſheweth
that it is to ſpeake improperly. Yet here one cannot
ſpeake properly enough. Therefore you may ſee that the

holy Ghoſt is ſayd to proceed from the Father alone in diuers
ſorts, the which the Churches of the Eaſt doe regard. But
they regard not the reaſons, wherefore he may be ſaid to proceed
from the Sonne: as alſo it is very hard to expreſſe how
the perſon of the Sonne is an inſpirer without conſidering
him either as an eſſence ſimply, or as begotten, for in this
perſon is conſidered but the eſſence, and the relation, as thoſe
ſchoole diuines affirme; the which relation hath the place of
forme from, which the action ought to proceed.
                  It is likewiſe very hard to ſay, how the Father inſpireth as
a perſon, without inſpiring neither as a Father nor as an
Eſſence: Neuertheleſſe we muſt ſo ſay, ſeeing the ſonne of
God himſelfe hath ſayd and taught ſo, as his beloued Diſciple
Saint Iohn teſtifieth vnto vs, which heard it of himſelfe:
But becauſe he hath not ſaid that the holy Ghoſt proceeds
from himſelfe, the Churches of the Eaſt will not ſay ſo: but do
conſider the Father as Father, and the Sonne as Sonne, and
they ſay with their great Doctor Saint Damaſcenus:
                     Orth. fid. li. 1. ca. 13. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the Father alone is the cauſe and beginning
as well of the Sonne as of the holy Ghoſt.
                  That which moueth the Latins to be ſo obſtinate, and to
ſay that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the perſon of the
Sonne, is becauſe they feare that otherwiſe men would feigne
or imagine inequallitie in the perſons: And if the Father
did not communicate to the Sonne the inſpiratiue power, he
communicated not vnto him all, that is in him: but hee communicated
vnto him all, except the conſtitutiue propertie of
his perſon. Neuertheleſſe the truth is, that the Grecians
confeſſe conſtantly the equality of the perſons, &amp; they ſay that
the Father did communicate all to the ſonne: but they ſeeme
to denie that that production is the action of the Sonne, becauſe

that the Son doth not inſpire, but the perſon already begotten
and reſident in himſelfe: and they ſay moreouer, that
there is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                     Damaſc. ibid. that is, that the inſpiration is one and the
very ſelfe ſame action of them both, the which neuertheleſſe
onght to be attributed to the Father alone, becauſe that he alone
is the beginning. The Latins do confeſſe all this, that
is to ſay, that there is one ſelfe ſame inſpiratiue vertue, and
conſequently one ſelfe ſame inſpiration which proceedeth
from the Father, yea euen in that, that it is the action of the
Sonne, and that the Father and the Sonne doe inſpire becauſe
they are both one, for the eſſence is the foundation of
the power, although that it is the Perſons that doe produce
it. It is as if one would ſearch to know, whether the light
which ſhineth ſometimes in the night time, doth proceede
onely from the Sunne, or elſe, as well from the Sunne, as
from the Moone A man ſhould not doe amiſſe to maintaine
both the one and the other, I ſpeake this, yet not comparing
the moſt holy myſteries with creatures, as ſome for want of a
more ſolid diſcourſe are wont, and would make men beleeue
ſo. I ſay this onely, that there may be found Logomachies
as well in the one, as in the other. The concluſion according
to the intention of all the Churches ſeemeth to be, that,
                  The Father as a perſon produceth the holy Ghoſt, and
as a Father begot the Sonne, who through the inſpiratiue
vertue communicated, produceth alſo the holy
Ghoſt: in ſuch ſort that the holy Ghoſt is ſaid to proceede
from the Sonne, if one conſider the action of the
Sonne ſimply, but if one haue regard to the beginning
of the ſame, he proceedeth from the Father only.

that ſinnes are not pardoned, nor neuer haue bene par-pardoned
to any, which vaunteth himſelfe of his beleefe
and certainty of the remiſſion of his ſinnes, and repoſeth
himſelfe only vpon that: although perhaps he be
an vtter heretike: and that in our time this vaine hope,

being farre from all pietie is preached with a great force
againſt the Catholicke (Romane) Church. And wee
ought not to be aſſured, that it muſt needes bee; that
thoſe which are truly iuſtified without doubting any
thing, doe relie vpon themſelues, that they are iuſtified
and that none can be abſolued of his ſinnes &amp; iuſtified
but he that beleeueth for a certaintie that he is abſolued
and iuſtified: and a little after: for none can know by the
certaintie of faith▪ without all queſtion of falſhood, that
he hath obtained the grace and fauour of God.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THe Councell of Trent ſaith, that confidence is a vaine opinion,
a preſumption, a vice, remote from all pietie,
and conſequently the way to damnation. The reformed on
the contrary ſide, doe maintaine that confidence is a Theologicall
vertue, and that faith whereof the Goſpell maketh mention
ſo often: and is not hurtfull, but rather aboue all things
neceſſarie to ſaluation: and that hee that repenteth, ought
to be aſſured that he is abſolued before God, eſpecially then,
when he receaueth the Sacraments, the ſeales of the remiſſion
of ſinnes, and at ſuch time, (ſay the Greekes) as one is
poſſeſſed with the affection of him that ſaid, I haue hated
iniquitie, that is to ſay at ſuch time, as ſinne raigneth no
more in that man, although it doth remaine in him. Euery
one ſeeth that this point is of importance: for if the ſayings
of the Proteſtants be true, it goeth very hard with the Romane
Catholikes: becauſe that they follow the doctrine of the
ſaid Councell, albeit not all, and caſt farre from them this

hope as vaine and deceitfull, and in ſo doing cannot be ſaued.
On the other ſide, the reformed doe runne in hazard if they
doe perſwade themſelues, that this confidence commeth of diuine
inſpiration, which in the decree of the Councell is a
vice farre voide from all piety. But becauſe that this is not
a place to debate vpon the reaſons which are alledged on the
one ſide, and on the other, it ſhall ſuffice to aduertiſe you, that
out of the paſſages before mentioned, is gathered, that the
Churches of the Eaſt and South, and many of the Catholike
Church of Rome, doe hold with the Reformed, contrary to the
Councell of Trent,
                  That the faith which God giueth to the repentant, is
a firme aſſurance of ſaluation: and conſequently, that
whoſoeuer hath this aſſurance, hath the faith which
God giueth.

                     IEremie.
                     1. Reſp. c. 18 It is of vs to chuſe and will, but
it is of God to performe and bring it to
effect. And beeauſe that which is moſt
excellent is of him: S. Paul attributeth all
vnto him, imitating therein the cuſtome
of men. As when we ſee a houſe built, we atttribute
all to the chiefe builder: yet neuertheleſſe all is not

done by him, but by the workemen, and by the owner
that prouided the ſtuffe: but we attribute all vnto him,
becauſe he hath layed the foundation, and is the chiefeth
builder. In like manner is it here, for ſo ſaith S. Paul alſo:
It is not in him that willeth, neither in him that runneth:
which ſaying preuenteth two miſchiefes, the one
that no man exalt himſelfe, for graunt ſaith he, that
thou runneſt, or that thou doeſt endeuour, yet thinke
not, that which is well done is thine, for if thou art not
inſpired from aboue, all is in vaine. It is neuertheleſſe
confeſſed, that thou ſhalt attaine vnto the end of that
which thou deſireſt, becauſe that thou runneſt, and becauſe
thou laboureſt: For he ſaid not ſimply that wee
runne in vaine, but that we runne in vaine, if we thinke
that all is of vs, and make not God the principall partie
for God would not, that all ſhould be from him, leaſt
he ſhould ſeeme to crowne vs for no ſeruice, neither
that all ſhould be of our ſelues, leaſt we ſhould happen
to fall into a fooliſh opinion of our ſelues: for if we be
proud of the leaſt part thereof becauſe it is in vs, howe
much more ſhould we be, if we had all in our ſelues?
                  
                     Item, in recyting of S.
                     Idem 
                     Chryſoſtome. To the end that
the greatneſſe of his benefits exalt the not, behold how
he doth humble thee: that is (ſaith hee) by giuing grace
through faith. On the contrary ſide, to the ende that
free-will haue no preiudice, hee hath alſo added that
which is of vs: And againe he hath taken it away: for
the ſame (ſaith he) is not of vs: nay faith it ſelfe is not of

                     Seſ. 6. can. 4 If any one ſay that the freewill
of a man, being moued and ſtirred by God,
doth not cooperate at all, in aſſenting to God, which
moued and called it; to the end that hee diſpoſe and
prepare himſelfe to obtaine the grace of iuſtification,
and that he cannot conſent if he would, nay rather that
he doth nothing at all, as a thing without a ſoule, and
that he is onely a patient and no agent, let him bee
accurſed.

                     Can. 5. If any one ſay, that the freewill of a man hath
beene ſo loſt and razed out after the fall of Adam, that it
is a thing without a name, or rather a name without a
thing: and to conclude, That it is a fiction that Sathan
hath brought into the Church, let him be accurſed.

                     THe confeſsion of the Saxons.
                     Art. 4. Thoſe men that were
well inſtructed, haue alwaies diſtinguiſhed outward

diſcipline, from the regeneration of the ſpirite,
which is the beginning of eternall life: and haue taught
that in man there is ſuch a freedome of will, to rule the
externall motions of the body, that thoſe which are not
regenerate, may in ſome faſhion accompliſh that diſcipline,
which is, an externall obedience according to the
law. But a man cannot deliuer himſelfe from ſinne, and
from eternall death by his naturall ſtrength. For this
deliuerance &amp; conuerſion of man to God, is wrought
by the Sonne of God, which doth quicken vs through
his holy ſpirit: and the will hauing once receiued the
holy ſpirit, is neuer after idle or voide.
                  
                     The confeſsion of Ausburg.
                     Art. 18. Touching freewill, the
Churches doe teach, that mans will hath ſome liberty
to worke ciuill righteouſnes, and to chuſe that which
is conformeable vnto reaſon: But it hath not the power
to worke ſpirituall righteouſneſſe, which is the righteouſnes
of God. We confeſſe that all men haue freewill,
which haue the iudgement of reaſon: neuertheleſſe
not ſuch, as that they are ſufficient of themſelues, either
to begin without God, or to end without him, in that
which concerneth God, but onely in the workes of this
preſent life, as well good as badde.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  SOme men doe thinke that the difference touching free-wil
conſiſteth all in wordes, which may be graunted, becauſe
that the Romane Catholikes doe not hold any thing to be in
a man that is regenerated, which the proteſtants doe not confeſſe
with them, that is, that it proceedeth either in all, or in

part from free-will. But the difference is in this, that the
Proteſtants doe thinke it neceſſary that a man ſhould haue an
aſſured faith, the which (ſay they) proceedeth in no wiſe from
free-will, nor by conſequent from the workes that doe proceed
from this faith: for if it proceede totally from God, it followeth,
that the effects ought to be imputed to him onely. If
the Latines would confeſſe that God giueth this confidence,
they ſhould approue the opinion of the Proteſtants; and indeede
many doe ſo, and therein are true Catholickes. The
Churches of Aſia and Affrica, which affirme, that it is neceſſary
to ſaluation, to haue this confidence: do alſo confeſſe, that
it commeth from God, and therefore begge it of him, and conſequently
denie therein free-will, as the Proteſtants doe, and
are contrary to the Latines, although that they doe not debate
with them about it, and (though they know it not) agree
with the Proteſtants: thoſe Proteſtants (I ſay) which beleeue
that the Grecians do contrary them, as much or more then
the Latines: and ſo it is certaine that the fault is for want of
vnderſtanding the matter.
                  Now to comprehend well this thing, a man muſt marke
the propoſitions of the Patriarch Ieremie, and explane them,
to the end he may gather his meaning by his owne diſcourſe.
                  Firſt he ſaith, that a man hath power or ability to chuſe
the good as well as the euill. Theſe termes are ſtrange to the
Reſp. 2. Ierem. de l. arb. Protestants. Neuertheleſſe they are true, becauſe that hee
ſpeaketh of the ſoule, which is the inward man, and the cheefeſt
part of a man (for ſo he expoundeth himſelfe.) This
ſoule is of it ſelfe apt to iudge and chuſe the good (that is to
ſay, that good which belongeth to morall vertue:) but the
bodie which is the ſoules inſtrument, doth ſuggeſt vnto it
without ceaſing thoſe obiects, which haue appearance of good,

in ſuch ſort that the ſoule cannot reſiſt but very hardly; euen
as a ſhippe, which of it ſelfe is apt to be conducted any
way, is oftentimes carried by the winde againſt the will of
the Pilot.
                  Secondly, Ieremie ſaith, that a man attempteth, and that
God effecteth. The Proteſtants doe confeſſe the ſame likewiſe,
ſaying, that a man may by his free-will doe a ciuil worke
ofThe foreſaid confeſſion of Ausburg. iuſtice, and ſuch as is commanded by God: But becauſe that
of it ſelfe it profiteth nothing to ſaluation, the ſame Ieremie
addeth, that God effecteth, by beſtowing that which is his own,
that is to ſay, faith.
                  
                  Thirdly. Neuertheleſſe the Proteſtants ſay, that all proceedeth
from God: The ſame Authour ſaith ſo alſo, and in
the very ſame termes, and ſheweth that the morall worke is
but as the matter: euen a matter vnprofitable, to the which
God giueth a forme, that is to ſay, faith. Euen as an Houſholder
which would build, prouideth the matter, but the Maſter
workeman maketh the houſe or building, in ſuch ſort that
all the commoditie of inhabiting, which is the vſe of the
houſe, is attributed to him that builded it.
                  Fourthly, Ieremie ſaith, that God dooth cooperate. It is
neceſſary here to marke, that two cauſes may concurre to one
effect. Reaſon leadeth a man to a worke of iuſtice, the holy
Ghoſt doth likewiſe driue him: And a man fortified with
ſpecial grace, executeth it better, then if he were caried alone
by naturall reaſon: Neuertheleſſe all is attributed to God, becauſe
that the ſoule being illuminated, employeth her naturall
faculties to a good end, the which it would neuer do without
God: and for this cauſe S. Paul ſaith, that it is not in him
that willeth, nor that runneth: wherein he teacheth, that a
man may will and runne, but becauſe that in running he erreth,

S. Paul addeth to it, that God muſt needs giue his mercy,
which he doth, when he purifieth the heart through faith;
faith (I ſay) which not onely maketh the Morall works good,
which proceede of reaſon, but alſo bringeth forth a farre
greater number, and maketh the righteouſneſſe of the faithfull
to exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſies:
for a man loueth God according to that proportion, that hee
beleeueth in him; and a man doth good workes according to
that meaſure, that hee loueth him; and it cannot be otherwiſe:
for in all our willingneſſe the principall part, or all
proceedes from inſpiration, and in this conſideration it is
ſayd, that God giueth the will and the deede.
                  5. When a man ſpeaketh of faith, it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh
it: for the want of this, is the cauſe of the ſtrife about
words. The Latins neuer ſpeake but of that faith, which
Bellarmine defineth thus: Catech. cap. 11. Faith is a
Theologicall vertue, whoſe office is to illuminate the
vnderſtanding, and to raiſe it vp to a firme beleefe of all
that, which God hath reuealed vnto vs by the meanes
of his Church, although it be a hard thing, and farre
paſſing naturall reaſon.
                  6. The Councell of Trent ſaith, that this faith dependeth
partly vpon free will, that is to ſay, in as much as a man diſpoſeth
himſelfe to receaue it, and may reiect it, when it is offered
him. The Proteſtants doe call this faith hiſtoricall,
and do confeſſe that a man may furder himſelfe in receiuing
of it. For the authoritie of the Church may moue a man to
beleeue that the Goſpell is a true hiſtorie: likewiſe the teſtimonie
of the Apoſtles, who are vnreproueable Authors, and
the predictions of the Prophets and the Sybils: yet ſo
that all this would be weake, if God ſhould not illuminate the

vnderſtanding to beleeue firmely. The Proteſtants doe confeſſe
alſo that one may reiect this faith, and fall into diſpaire
for this faith hath her ſeat in the vnderſtanding (as the Romane
Catholickes ſay very well) but in ſuch ſort that the vnderſtanding
draweth not the will to accept and reſt in it ſeing
that by this faith a man is not aſſured, whether any 
                        〈◊〉
                     
be giuen to himſelfe, but onely he beleeueth that it is 
                        〈◊〉
                     
to ſome men, in ſuch ſort that if he loueth God, it is of a 
                        〈◊〉
                     
proportionable to this faith. Hee loueth him as the Author
of nature, and as a benefactor to them that pleaſe him. If he
keepe in ſome ſort his commaundements, it is more formidine
paenae, then virtutis amore: rather of ſeruice feare
then of filiall loue. It is impoſsible for a man to loue him
withall his heart, whom he miſtruſteth.
                  6. This is the cauſe that the Church of the Eaſt &amp; South;
together with the reformed Church of the Weſt (and that againſt
the Councell of Trent) doe hold that a man muſt haue
confidence and aſſurance. The confeſsion of Saxonie ſaith
as followeth:De remiſſ. art. 3. Faith ſignifieth not onely to know the hiſtorie
as the diuels themſelues doe, which beleeue and tremble
but alſo ſignifieth to imbrace all the Articles of the faith,
and amongſt the reſt this alſo: I beleeue the forgiueneſſe of
ſinnes, and doe beleeue that they are forgiuen, not only vnto
others, but alſo vnto me.
                  7. Behold here the true knot of the queſtion of free-will.
The Proteſtants affirme that this faith of aſſurance, dependeth
not at all vpon free will: this is not to ſay, that it is not
a man, which beleeueth and which willeth, but that he beleeueth
not, nor willeth not, if God of his extraordinary and
eſpecial grace would not, that a man beleeued &amp; were willing.
Moreouer this is not to ſay, that naturally the actuall vnderſtanding

cannot beleeue all that which is credible, and that
the will naturally accepteth not all, that which the iudgement
propoſeth to be good: but man is ſayd not to helpe himſelfe
by his free will to receiue this faith, becauſe that nature doth
not ſhew to the iudgement of man any reaſon, whereby hee
might conclude that God loueth him, &amp; would faine be fauorable
&amp; merciful vnto him, as Ieremy very learnedly ſaith
in his ſecond anſwere: all that which is proued by arguments,
is examined very profoundly by earneſt inquirie
or ſearch: but the ſimplicitie of faith is more firme then
the demonſtrations which reaſon doth deuiſe. Moreouer,
man cannot reiect this faith when it is offered him,
becauſe that God hath ſo ordered, that a man iudgeth and beleeueth
without any precedent debating. And withall, a man
cannot haue a will to reiect it at ſuch time as it is in the vnderſtanding
becauſe that the wil naturally &amp; neceſſarily, but
freely (for otherwiſe it ſhould be no will) yeeldeth it ſelfe to
that which the iudgement eſteemeth to bee good and profitable.
The Proteſtants in the confeſsion of Saxonie and
Ausburg, and others doe confeſſe alſo, that it may be imputed
to the vnderſtanding, by reaſon of other ſucceeding obiects,
as the cauſe that vice raigneth in man; for man
hath his free will to euill, and God hath not promiſed ſaluation
to them which ſinne willingly and notoriouſly.
                  8. As touching the Chriſtians of the South, although
that this queſtion is not found handled in their writings, yet
they ſpeake very ſufficiently. They ſay that aſſurance of faith
is a guift of God, and therefore they begge it at his hands, and
they confeſſe that a man cannot doe any good in the world, to
wit, by his free will. Moreouer the Councell of Trent confeſſeth,
that thisSeſſ. 6. 9. faith proceedeth not at all from free will:

Euery man (ſaith the Councell) when he hath regard to
himſelfe, and to his owne indignity and indiſpoſition,
may haue ſome feare and doubt of Gods grace: ſeeing
a man cannot know by any certainety of faith, that hee
hath obtained the grace of God. Out of this confeſſion
of the Councell a man may conclude, that if God giueth this
confidence (as the Apoſtolike Churches doe beleeue againſt the
ſaid Councell) then it is a ſupernaturall gift, and dependeth
no way on freewill.
                  
                  9. But the Reformed ſtay not on ſo faire a way, They ſay
that we cannot doe any good workes through free-will: They
would ſay, in as much as theſe workes proceede of faith:
for in that they proceede from naturall all reaſon (which is no
leſſe in the faithfull then in the vnfaithfull) the free-will
doth cooperate alſo, neuertheleſſe they are not therefore truely
good, that is to ſay, rewardable: but they are, in that they
proceede of faith, or that they are addreſſed to a true end
through faith: and therfore the Catholike Church beleeueth,
                  That God giueth a kind of faith, called confidence,
which proceedeth not in any wiſe from free-will, nor
by conſequent works conſidered as effects of this faith.

               Whether a man receiueth remiſsion of ſinnes by a confident
faith, without the workes of the law.

                        IEremie.
                     2. Reſp. de iuſt. The one hath neede of the other, that
is to ſay, grace of the works, and the workes of
grace: as the light of the ſight, and the ſight

of the light: as the ſoule of the body, and the body of the
ſoule. Seeing then that both the one &amp; the otherdoth auaile
to ſaluation, without doubt a man ought to haue
them both: a true faith with works, &amp; the works of vertue
through faith; and a man ought to beleeue without
doubting, for doubt and perplexity in faith, is no faith:
for that which is proued by arguments, though once
receiued, is examined more profoundly by ſearching:
But the ſimplicity of faith is more firme then the demonſtrations
of reaſon: and thoſe things which are beleeued
without arte, are more ſtrong then thoſe that
are artificiall, without all compariſon. For if one ſound
the depth of Faith, ſhe is toſſed to and fro; but if ſhe be
conſidered in her ſimple diſpoſition, ſhe remaineth ſtedfaſt.
It being then moſt certaine, and not to be doubted,
that a man muſt beleeue without Doubting, It remaineth
here onely, that we muſt with all our might
ſeeke and find in ſome faſhion, what that is? becauſe
that we ought to apply our ſelues to obtaine ſaluation:
for faith without workes, and workes without
faith, are equally reiected of God.

for to iuſtifie me: but let that faith ſuffice me for all. It

and mourning.

                     Cap. 4. When the Goſpell
doth reprehend our ſinnes, the aſtoniſhed hearts
ought to holde for a certaintie, that the remiſſion of ſins
and iuſtification through faith are giuen vs freely thorough
Ieſus Chriſt, which was made a ſacrifice for vs,
and hath apeaſed his father: Albeit then the Goſpel requireth
repentance, yet neuertheſſe to the end that the
remiſſion of our ſinnes might be certaine, it teacheth
vs, that it is giuen freely, and that it dependeth not vpon

condition of our worthineſſe, and is not giuen in confideration
of any precedent workes, neither of any inſuing
worthineſſe or dignitie. For remiſſion ſhould
become vncertaine, if wee ſhould hold it not to bee
giuen, but after ſuch time as it was merited by precedent
workes, or elſe by ſome notable repentance.

                     THe Councell of Trent,
                     Seſſ. 6. ca. 8. when the Apoſtle ſaith, that
man is iuſtified by faith, and that freely, thoſe words
ought to be vnderſtood in that ſence, that the Catholike
Church hath alwayes held &amp; expounded them, that
is to ſay, that we are iuſtified by faith, becauſe that faith
is the beginning of the ſaluation of mankind, the foundation
and root of our iuſtification, without the which
it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, &amp; to come into the companie
of the ſonnes of God. And that we are freely iuſtified
by reaſon that there is no other thing that goeth
before iuſtification (bee it faith, or good workes) which
meriteth the grace of Iuſtification. For if it be of grace,
it is not of works: otherwiſe (as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith)
grace were no grace. Item,
                     Can. 12. If any man ſay that iuſtifying
faith is nothing els, but the truſt which one hath on
the mercy of God, which pardoneth ſinnes for the loue
of Ieſus Chriſt: or that this truſt is the onely thing
through which we are iuſtified, let him be accurſed.Can. 13. If
any man ſay, that to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes, It
is onely neceſſary that a man beleeue aſſuredly, and neuer
to make any doubt, notwithſtanding his owne infirmitie

and indiſpoſition, that his ſinnes are pardoned
him, let him be accurſed.

                     TIme (ſaith Malancthon)De pace ad Lang. 
                     hath mollified the controuerſie
touching iuſtification; for the learned agree
in many things, which in the beginning they had
in great diſputation: all doe now confeſſe and mainetaine
that faith is needfull, that is to ſay, confidence in
Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſinnes: of the which faith or
confidence the Schoole men made no mention. Melancthon
did ſuppoſe, that there were very many men in the
Church of Rome, whom they counted learned, that were not of
the opinion of the Councell of Trent: but confeſſed with the
Churches of the Eaſt and South, and with the Reformed
Church, that a man both may, and ought to haue aſſurance
and confidence. Neuertheleſſe the Reformed ceaſe not to debate
vpon this point of iuſtification, as alſo vpon that of free
will, not onely againſt the Latins, but alſo againſt the Grecians.
Reſpon. Reſp. Ierem. The Author of a certaine diſcourſe called Examen
pacifique ſaith, That theſe are but ſtriuings about
wordes inuented to trouble the Church, becauſe that
one taketh this word Iuſtification, in one ſenſe, and another
in another ſenſe: one taketh the word Faith
in one ſenſe, and another in another ſenſe. In
ſuch ſort that both the one and the other ſaie true, being
taken according to their meaning, although that
they differ in words. We haue ſaid in the queſtion precedent,
that the Latins and the Reformed agree vpon the point of
free will, if all the Latins would confeſſe, that the Faith of

the Elect is a full aſſurance; wee ſay the very ſame in this
point of Iuſtification: but to ſhew where the difference is, we
ought not to vſe the word Faith or Iuſtification, without
diſtinguiſhing of what faith, or what iuſtification we ſpeake
                  The Councell of Trent ſaith foure things, Firſt, that
faith (that is to ſay, that which is without confidence, which
the Proteſtants call hiſtoricall, for the Councell acknowledgeth
none other) is the beginning of mans ſaluation: and that
this faith commeth from God. The Proteſtants doe acknowledge
both the one and the other: to wit, that it is neceſſary
firſt that one beleeue that the Goſpell is a true hiſtorie,
and then that one cannot beleeue perfecty, and as he ought,
without the grace of God, as the ſame Councell ſaith.
                  Secondly, that this hiſtoricall faith, is the beginning and
root of Iuſtification, that is to ſay, that it bringeth forth good
workes which God doth approue, and for which God iuſtifieth
a man, that is to ſay, he holdeth and declareth him iuſt.
The Proteſtants ſay that this faith may bring forth a certain
inherent iuſtice, through the which a man isDanaus Eth. Chriſt. iuſtified, Secondum
quid, that is in a ſort, but not abſolutely, for a man
that doth one good worke, doth a thouſand bad workes, which
doe make him vniuſt: ſo that the ſame man is good and bad,
iuſt and vniuſt, approued of God, and condemned of God againe.
God were vniuſt if he ſhould not hold himiuſt whom
he himſelfe hath iuſtified; well then he iuſtifieth men according
to ciuill righteouſneſſe, in giuing this hiſtoricall faith,
and in ſtirring vp in them charity, ſuch as it is, that is, proportionable
to this faith. One cannot (ſaith Bellarmine)
De Crana lib. 64. 
                     loue God himſelfe, as the Author of nature, if it bee
not by the helpe of ſpeciall grace. And ſo there is no
difference in this point.
                  
                  
                     
In the third place the Councel ſaith, that through this hiſtoricall
faith a man is not abſolued of his former ſinnes. The
Proteſtants doe confeſſe as much, and adde withall, that no
more is he through good works, which proceed from thence,
which (ſay they) are not good, but for humane ſocieties ſake.
                  In the fourth place the Councell ſaith, that Saint Paul
and S. Iames, ſpeaking of this faith in the example which
they alleadge of Abraham: the which (ſaith the Councell)
was iuſtified, that is to ſay, found iuſt, in that he beleeued
God; but plainely iuſtified, that is to ſay, held iuſt of all, when
he effected the commandement of God. The Churches of the
Eaſt doe approue this opinion, but it is not needfull to debate
much, touching the intention and meaning of S. Paul. The
Scripture may receiue diuerſe expoſitions and al orthodox. It
is certaine that Abraham was iuſtified in that he beleeued:
and more iuſt in that he laid his hands to the worke.
                  But there are two concluſions wherein the Apoſtolicke
Churches, and the Reformed Church are contrary in the ſayd
Councell. The firſt is that the ſaid Councell doth hold that
through the workes which proceede of this hiſtoricall faith a
man obtaineth (others ſay a man meriteth) that God ſhould
pardon his former ſinnes, in imputing vnto them, that doe
thoſe good workes, the merite of the paſsion of our Sauiour.
The Proteſtants on the contrary ſide ſay, that ſuch works proceeding
from ſuch hiſtoricall faith ſerue not to ſaluation.
Hereunto the Churches of the Eaſt do agree, who ſay that the
workes which proceede from a true faith, are truely good:
and they call this faith Confidence, which ought to be noted,
to the end that none ſhould doubt the truth of the hiſtory,
for they declare ſufficiently, that they meane, that it is not
needfull that a repentant man ſhould doubt of his ſaluation.

That is alſo ſeene more plainely in that, that they of the Eaſt
haue written before, to the Proteſtants of Germany, who
preſſe very hard this point of Confidence, wherein they of the
Eaſt doe approue and confirme their ſaying.
                  The ſecond difference is in that the Proteſtants ſay, that a
man is abſolued (they call it iuſtified) at that inſtant, that he
receiueth this confidence by diuine inſpiration, and that without
any conſideration of precedent workes (otherwiſe grace
ſhould be no grace) as alſo without conſideration of any future
workes: for it happeneth ſometimes (as it did to the
good thiefe) that a man ſhall haue no time to doe good works:
and if the faith of confidence ſufficeth as ſoone as it is in fuſed,
yea and ſufficeth as an inſtrumentall cauſe to put a man
in poſſeſsion of the paſsion of the Lord, which is the formall
cauſe of abſolution, it followeth, that during all the tearme
of a mans life, he neede not ſeeke any other inſtrumental
cauſe of this application. For when our Sauiour healed the
ſicke, he ſayed not vnto them, loueſt thou me? although it was
neceſſary that they ſhould haue loued him, but he ſaid to them
beleeueſt thou? for by this beleefe they were healed. And
that the Churches of the Eaſt doe beleeue, that this confidence
putteth a man in poſſeſsion of the grace of God, they ſhew in
that which their Patriarch ſayth, that his confidence vniteth
things ſeparated, and that diſtruſt doth diſ-vnite and
ſeperate them: for what vnion can there be with God without
remiſsion of ſinnes? Moreouer the Grecians confeſſe that
God inſpireth this confidence: If it be ſo, it followeth, that at
that very inſtant a man obtaineth pardon: otherwiſe God
ſhould be the Authour of deceitfull and vaine confidence. But
ſome will then demaund, to what end ſerue good workes?
The Grecians and the Proteſtants with one conſent doe anſwere,

that without them one cannot be ſaued: and if there
be no good workes, a man falleth from the abſolution already
receiued: and looke how much force confidence hath to put a
man in poſſeſsion of the merite of the paſsion of the Lord,
ſo much euill workes haue (that is to ſay, ſo long as they
remaine and raigne in the ſoule) to breake the vnion that
faith had contracted. In like manner good workes are cauſes,
ſine quibus non, of this iuſtification, or elſe may be ſaid
to be cauſes per accidens: Neither the Chriſtian Churches
of this time, nor the fathers, nor the holy Scripture, doe
ſet downe the order of euery one of theſe cauſes, according to
the termes of Philoſophers, neyther is it neceſſary: It ſufficeth
that euery one haue faith, and that euery one giue himſelf
to good works, and that he know that both the one and the
other is neceſſary. The difference betweene the foreſaid people,
and the Proteſtants is: that the Proteſtants ſeeing that
the Latines doe not attribute enough to faith, or rather doe
not acknowledge this faith of confidence, to the which they
attribute ſo much, cannot endure to haue this faith diſgraced:
And other Chriſtians hearing of the commendations
of this faith, doe perſwade themſelues, that it makes
to the preiudice of good workes; for which cauſe they cannot
by any meanes hold their peace.
                  Well then, becauſe that wee haue ſaid, that euill workes
cauſe men to fall from iuſtification, that is to ſay, from abſolution
(which is the beleefe receiued, without any contradiction,
in all times, and by all Christian people) It may be obiected,
that amongſt the Proteſtants there are ſome found
(for all doe not ſo, as is to be ſeene in the confeſsions of Auſburg,
Bohemia, Saxonie, and Wirtenberg) which ſay, that
he that hath this iuſtifying faith cannot fall. From whence

it followeth according to their ſayings, that hee which beleeueth
himſelfe to be iuſtified, may giue himſelfe to all wickedneſſe.
                  To this may be anſwered, that thoſe which hold this propoſition,
eyther doe not explane themſelues well, or elſe their
explication is not well vnderſtood.
                  For they ſay not ſimply that euery one ought to beleeue that
he is iuſtified, but only he that is repentant ought ſo to beleeue.
Alſo that repentance (whereof euery one may iudge in his
owne ſoule) ſheweth, whether his faith be a iuſtifying faith.
And that he that ſhall ſay, I will doe euill, is not at all repentant:
for theſe are quite contrary.
                  Moreouer thoſe which are ſaid to hold this opinion, ſay
ordinarily that none ought to commit ſinn, in hope to repent:
for none can or ought to promiſe himſelfe, that God will
giue him time and meanes to accompliſh it: Thoſe which doe
haunt their Sermons, can beare witneſſe if this be not an ordinary
leſſon. Well then, what is this but to ſay that none
can haue this confidence at ſuch time as vice and ſinne dooth
raigne in him? And if one cannot haue it, is not this as
much as to ſay, that if one had it, he may looſe it, in giuing
himſelfe to wickedneſſe? But behold here how their ſaying
is true: forſooth becauſe confidence of faith doeth coutaine in
it Hiſtoricall faith which remaineth in him, in whom vice
doth raigne, as the Councell of Trent alſo ſaith: And this
faith, if he be elected will moue him to repentance, which endeth
not in diſpaire, as in the reprobate, but in a full confidence,
and all by the aſsiſtance of God. The Catholicke concluſion
is:
                  That a man receiueth remiſſion of his ſinnes at the
very inſtant that the aſſurance of faith is infuſed into

his ſoule, and that without any conſideration of former
or future workes.

we praiſe good workes, we doe not pretend
to exalt our ſelues by them, or to
put our truſt in them: for we ſhould then
ſinne very much in ſo doing: But we deſire
that men would giue themſelues thereunto, as to
things that are eſpecially neceſſary to ſaluation, and the
which euery one is bound to exerciſe according to his
power, following the commaundement of God. But if
we truſt in that great and incomprehenſible mercie of
God, and his onely grace, in ſuch ſort that wee doe
hope for ſaluation remaining vnfruitful and ingrateful:
that muſt not be by no meanes; for it will bring vs no
profite at all. As for the reſt, let vs iudge of that which
is in vs (although that there is not any thing that is perfect)
Neuertheleſſe the ſame doth profite and makes
knowne what it is which we haue in our ſoules, to wit,
that we are charitable and obedient to the commaundement
of God, and that we pretend not to be carried
into heauen, as people amaſed, and without vnderſtanding,
negligent and idle, the which certainely we can

neuer obtaine, if we doe not conioine our owne power
and endeuours, with the grace and mercy of God,
for in ſticking faſt to ſinne, we are iuſtly to be eſteemed
fooles and ſenſeleſſe, as cleauing to thoſe things that
can helpe vs nothing, and which hauing no beeing
in themſelues, are nothing, the which we ought aboue
all things to hate and eſchew: becauſe that they
doe prouoke Gods wrath againſt vs, and doe draw vs
backe farre from him. Therefore when we are euen at
the point to offend God, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before
the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, which is very terrible,
whereon he ſhall ſit in a high and glorious place, as
a iuſt iudge, before whom ſhall appeare all creatures
beholding his glory and maieſtie, for to render an account
of all their words and actions.

are likewiſe Coheires with the Sonne of God for his
ſake, and not for their owne merits: in like maner thoſe
that repent are accounted iuſt by faith, by the onely
meanes of the Son of God, and are quickened through
him, and for the loue of him, as alſo eternall life is giuen
them for his ſake, and not for their merits. And
we muſt not doubt that the Sonne of God hath onely
merited for vs a preparation to eternall life, to the end
that afterwards we might merite by our good works.

workes of a iuſtified man are the gifts of God only,
and that they are not as good merits of him that is iuſtified,
or that the ſame man that is iuſtified doth not truly

that he die in grace, and alſo the augmentation of glory

                     THis queſtion may ſeeme to be a 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , becauſe of the
ambiguity of the word Merite, which in the writings
of the Fathers ſignifieth to Obtaine, as the confeſsion of
Bohemia doth well note, in the which ſenſe the Proteſtants
of AusburgeConfeſſ. art. 4. 
                     haue made no ſcruple to vſe it. But becauſe
that the Councell ſaith that a man doth truely merite, wee
muſt confeſſe that it ſpeaketh of a merite which the Proteſtants
admit not of. And euen ſo Cardinall Bellarmine
ſheweth, when he ſaith thus. Some men doe imagine that
there is but one ſatisfaction, to wit that of Chriſt, and
that we doe not properly ſatisfie: but that we doe ſome
things, in conſideration whereof God doth applie vnto
vs the ſatisfaction of Chriſt: that is to ſay, that our good
workes are but conditions, without the which the ſatiſfaction
of Chriſt ſhould not be applied vnto vs, or at
the moſt, but a diſpoſition; ſo ſaith Michael Bauius, the
which opinion ſeemeth vnto me erronious: for the holy
Scripture and the Fathers, ordinarily doe call our
workes, ſatisfactions, and redemptions of ſinnes. Moreouer,
if a man may by his good workes merite De Condigno,
Life Euerlaſting, wherefore may hee not ſatisfie
for temporall paine which is leſſe? From this diſcourſe of
Bellarmine may be gathered two things. The firſt is, that
in the Romane Catholicke Church, there are ſome which hold
the opinion of the Proteſtants. The other is, that the Councell
by theſe words, To merite truely euerlaſting life, doeth
meane that one may merite it, De condigno, and not that
works are onely cauſes, Sine quibus non, or only diſpoſitions.
                  
                  The Proteſtants doe oppoſe themſelues against that very

ſtrongly and firmely, and doe maintaine that merite taken
after the meaning of Bellarmine, preſuppoſeth a man
hath beene profitable to him of whom hee meriteth: but
men euen when they are moſt perfect are vnprofitable ſeruants
(to wit to God, and not to themſelues or to their neighbours)
as our Sauiour ſaith. God doth excell both men and
Angels from all eternity, and in perfect beatitude. And if
he had appointed to bring them all to naught, euen as he created
them of nothing, he ſhould not be vniuſt: If hee doe a
deede of mercy in eternizing them, it is becauſe hee doth it
according to his promiſe, freely and not of merite. For if a
man by his good workes hath not obliged God to promiſe, he
obligeth him not neither to effect the ſame. If a begger by
asking almes doth get tenne crownes, no man will ſay that he
merited them de Condigno: no although the giuer had
made him a promiſe. Well then, to pray to God and to faſt,
is to begge his mercy.
                  As touching the Churches of the Eaſt, they vſe not the
word Merite, but vſe the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is to ſay, to obtaine
or to carry away a recompence, which is a phraſe of
Scripture. Therefore good workes are recompenceable, that
is to ſay, they diſpoſe or make a man fit to receiue a recompence,
but yet as a gratuitie. The ſame Churches doe holde
alſo that opinion which Bellarmine condemneth, that is to
ſay, that good workes are cauſes ſine quibus non: without
the which (ſaith their anſwere) one cannot obtaine ſaluation.
                  Moreouer the benefite of good workes is recyted: vice is neither
decent nor profitable, &amp; nothing elſe but the depriuation
of al goodnes. Good works do ſhew what we are, to wit, whether
we be in grace. In fine, good workes are the cauſe of our
ſaluation (but by accident) ſeeing that the omiſsion of good

workes, and the commiſsion of euill, doe ſtrange a man much
from God.
                  As touching the Chriſtians of the South, there hath not
beene any diſputations among them touching this queſtion,
but they agree with vs therein. They call themſelues vnprofitable
ſeruants, and confeſſe that they haue not done any
good in the world. It would be a great iniurie to the pure
ſimplicitie of thoſe Chriſtians, if one ſhould ſuſpect them to
hide a diſſembling ſoule vnder thoſe words.
                  It is to be noted, that the Councell of Trent doth make two
ſorts of recompence, that is to ſay, euerlaſting life, and diuers
degrees of beatitude. As concerning life euerlaſting, one
would thinke it were thus by ſearching the cauſe, to wit, that
God loueth himſelfe perfectly, becauſe that he is the louer of
perfect goodneſſe and Iuſtice. And that the perſon of his
Sonne, which is the very ſame eſſence with the Father, hath
taken in perſonal vnion, the ſonne of the Virgin, who conſequently
is perfectly loued, that is to ſay, hee hath perfect
righteouſneſſe, the which the Diety hath communicated
vnto him: Therefore it cannot be but that God gaue to this
humanitie all the felicity whereof it was capable. Well then,
this loue and felicity ſhould not be perfect, if it did not extend
to the myſticall bodie of this Emmanuel, God and man, that
is to ſay, to all them that are one with him, as he is one with
the Father. In like manner all thoſe that are of that bodie,
are capable of that felicity by reaſon of the loue that God beareth
to them in his Sonne: yea when they haue not the
meanes to doe any good workes: as it is ſeene in little children;
which if they be ſaued (as it is confeſſed) it is onely for
the vnion which they haue with the ſon of God, whoſe righteouſneſſe
is recompenced in them. Then if this righteouſnes

of Chriſt be ſufficient to make them happy: it followeth,
that the ſame is alſo ſufficient to make thoſe happy, which are
grownein yeares, who by the very ſame meanes haue eternal
life, that is to ſay, by reaſon of his perfect righteouſnes.
                  But as God loueth his ſonne, being a man in regard of his
actions that are perfectly good, by reaſon whereof God hath
giuen him a name aboue all names: In like manner loueth
he thoſe which God hath giuen him, by reaſon of their good
workes, although vnperfect: and therefore in conſideration
and according to the proportion of them, he recompenceth
them with ſundry degrees of felicity: Not that their workes
were the cauſe of euerlaſting life, which was not abſolutely
promiſed, but to thoſe which haue perfect righteouſneſſe
The Catholike concluſion in this Queſtion is,
                  That a man meriteth not properly eternall life by
his good workes, although that they be worthy of reward,
that is to ſay, that they make a man fit to receiue
a recompence through the grace of God.

to S. Luke, teaching what ſhall bee the condition
both of the one and the other, ſaith that Lazarus as
ſoone as he was dead, was carried by Angels into Abrahams
boſome: and that the ſoule of the rich man, as
ſoone as he was dead, was carried into hell, and there
tormented. And alſo by the boſome of Abraham hee
ſignifieth the finall eſtate of the beloued of God in bleſſed
reſt: and by hell and torments, finall damnation and
eternall paine. And hath left no other place betweene
both, hauing any temporall paine; and ſaith, that there is
but one bottomleſſe pit, beyond the which none can
paſſe, which ſeperateth the one from the other, and ordained
an extreame and vtter contrariety betweene
them.

that there is a Purgatorie, are wont to ſay, ſpeaking
of their deceaſed parents: God haue mercy on
their ſoules.

faithfull are tranſported to Ieſus Chriſt ſtraight after
corporall death: and that they haue no neede of the

prayers and ſuffrages of the liuing. We beleeue alſo
that the wicked are ſtraight-way caſt into hell, from
whence they cannot come forth. And that ſame which
ſome men teach touching the fire of purgatorie, is contrary
to Chriſtian faith, I beleeue the forgiuenes of ſinnes,
and the al-ſufficient purgation made by Ieſus Chriſt,
and his word: Verily, verily I ſay vnto you, that whoſoeuer
heareth my wordes, and beleeueth in him that ſent me, hath
euerlaſting life, and ſhall not come into iudgement, but paſſeth
from death to life.

                     THe Councell of Trent.
                     Seſſ. 9. Foraſmuch as the holy Catholicke
Church, guided by the holy Ghoſt, hath
taught according to the holy Scriptures, and the ancient
Traditions of the Fathers in the holy Councels, and
laſtly, in that holy vniuerſall Councell, that there is a
purgatory, and that the ſoules which are there deteined,
are helped by the praiers of the faithfull, and principally
by the acceptable ſacrifice of the Altar: The holy
Councell doth commaund the Biſhops, that they take
paines, and ſtudy diligently, that the good and holy doctrine
of Purgatory, which the holy fathers and Councels
haue deliuered, be receiued, held, taught and preached
euery where.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THis point here hath no difficultie: for as touching the
praiers which they make in the Eaſt for the dead, wee

will intreat in that queſtion, where it ſhall be debated whether
it be lawfull to praie for the Saints which are in heauen.
Onely it is to be noted, that the Councelle of Trent doth
faine that the holy Scriptures doe warrant Purgatorie:
which the Churches of the Eaſt doe denie: And if the true
Interpretations of Scripture ought to be taken out of the
Apoſtolicke Churches which haue retained it from hand to
hand from their Fathers: it followeth, that thoſe places of
Scripture, which the Church of Rome doth alleadge to proue
Purgatorie, are wreſted by them to another ſenſe, as the Grecians
haue ſhewed in their Apologie, in the Councell of Baſil.
And the Author of the Treatiſe of the fire of Purgatory
before alleadged, doth proue it very ſlenderly. Moreouer
many Romane Catholike Doctors, and of very good eſtimation
doe confeſſe, that Purgatorie cannot be proued by the Scripture.
Amongſt the reſt Alphonſus de Caſtro auoucheth,
not onely that it is not proued by the Scripture, but alſo that
the Fathers doe ſeldome make mention of it, eſpecially the
Greeke Fathers: From thence (ſaith he) it commeth that euen
vntill this preſent time the Grecians doe denie Purgatorie.
The Catholicke Concluſion thererefore here
is this:
                  That there is no fire of Purgatorie, nor any other
torment, where ſoules are purged and puniſhed, and
that prayers ſerue not to deliuer them, but rather are
ſuperfluous and vnprofitable1. Mach. 11 if that they be made to
that intention.

(to the end that it might be perceiued that they deſired

Pardon with all their heart, and to the ende that
their example ſhould profite others) were not receiued
vpon a ſuddaine, but the abſolution was deferred: for
certaine daies, to the end that they might be ſeene to
aske it publickely. Afterwards ſuperſtition encreaſed
ſo much, that faſting was ordained, and abſtinence
from women many yeares. Theſe wil-worſhippes being
too much augmented, the Biſhops againe releaſed
them.
                  The relaxation of ſuch cuſtomes were called Indulgences.
The Monks doe not conſider the Hiſtorie of
theſe things, if they imagine that they make ſatisfaction
for eternall paine, or the paine of Purgatorie, and others
of this life, or do adde, that ſatisfactions were ordained
by the Church, to the end that theſe paines ſhould be
qualified. Well, we ſay that this application of Indulgences,
by the which the Pope applyeth the merites of
the Saints, is inuented at his pleaſure.

                     Seſſ. 9. de Indul. Foraſmuch as the power to
conferre Indulgences, hath beene giuen by Ieſus
Chriſt to the Church, and hath beene vſed in very auncient
time, with the like power as it was diuinely giuen:
The holy Councell teacheth and commaundeth, that
the vſage of theſe Indulgences which are very neceſſarie
for Chriſtian people, and approued by the Authoritie
of the holy Councels, ought to be receiued in the
Church.
               
               
                  
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THe Proteſtants ſay that the cuſtome in times paſt was,
to appoint to repentant ſinners a certaine terme, during
which by their good workes, they might giue the Church teſtimonie
of their repentance. The ſame is as yet practiſed in
the Eaſt and South Churches.
                  
                     Ieremie Patriarcke of Conſtantinople, diſcourſeth
hereupon as followeth. Satisfactions are profitable, if they be
impoſed as a medicine by the ſpiritual miniſters, that is to ſay,
for thoſe that are Proude, Couetous, Gluttonous, Incontinent,
Enuious, Quarrelous, or giuen to ſuch like vices: Who
if they would conuert and repent, ought to ſubmit themſelues
to the rules made according to the aduiſe of the holy Fathers.
But if thoſe ſatisfactions bee tranſlated to the gaine and profit
of thoſe that giue them, and not to the true end, which is
to prouide for the ſaluation of the Soule, and to heale each
ſinne, which is the intention, for the which they were inſtituted:
In that faſhion we doe reiect them, and doe ſay that
they were ordained in vaine, which cannot by any meanes
be denied. And we doe pronounce remiſsion of ſinnes, with
ſome puniſhment adioyned for many conſiderations.
                  Firſt to the end, that a man for voluntarie affliction,
might eſcape the ineuitable paine of an other life. Bring
forth fruites worthy of Repentance, ſaith S. Iohn, Euery
tree that beareth not good fruit ſhall be cut down,
and throwne into the fire, to wit, Euerlaſting. For God is
not ſo much pleaſed with any thing, as with affliction, and
therefore S. Gregorie ſaith, Teares are recompenſed
with mercie.
                  
                  Secondly, to the end that the inclination of the fleſh to voluptuouſneſſe,

which is the cauſe of vice, ſhould be taken away.
                  Thirdly, to the end that that puniſhment ſhould be a ſtay to
the ſoule, to the end it fall not into ſuch like ſinne, or worſe.
                  Fourthly, to the end that a man ſhould accuſtome himſelfe
to take paines, for vertue is gotten with trauaile.
                  Fiftly, to the end that a man might bee aſſured, whether
he perfectly hateth euill. Neuertheleſſe we doe leaue all theſe
things in thoſe that depart: For we doe count that it is ſufficient,
if in him that repenteth, there bee a true conuerſion.
Therefore we doe pronounce remiſsion of ſinnes according to
the power of him that ſaid, If you remit ſinnes, they ſhall
be Pardoned. We beleeue that by the ſame meanes the puniſhment
is pardoned, for aſſurance whereof, we doe giue the
diuine gift of the Euchariſt. For repentance hath his ſeate
in the ſoule of the ſinner, but not to vndergoe puniſhment,
is in the handes of God, which for this cauſe hath really
by his owne humanitie, giuen remiſsion, as to the thiefe who
did but deſire of the Lord, that hee would remember him
when he came to his Kingdome. See here the Doctrine of
the Churches of the Eaſt touching ſatisfaction. The Proteſtants
doe proceede more compendiouſly, they are content
that in regard of vnknowen ſinnes, euery one doe apply according
to his diſcretion, the ſaying of S. Iohn, Bring forth
fruits worthy of repentance. As concerning ſinnes knowen
by the moſt part of the Church, ſatisfaction ſufficeth not
vnleſſe it make a reparation or publike acknowledgment, in
asking pardon of God, and the Church for the ſcandale: and
if the offence be knowne but to a few, the ſame acknowledgement
is made in their Conſiſtories. Thoſe that refuſe
doe remaine ſuſpended or excommunicated, vntill that they
doe obey, and they giue no Indulgence. There is alſo apappointed

to the repentant a time of ſuſpenſion from the Sacraments,
more or leſſe, according to the fault; as well for
a puniſhment, as alſo to the end that the Church may ſee,
whether ſuch repentance be true or fained by the fruits therof.
The auncient Church impoſed puniſhments, and ſometimes
ſo hard, that they were conſtrained to releaſe the rigor
of them, and that relaxation was called Indulgence. The
Churches of the South doe releaſe or mittigate nothing at
all, and alſo reiect Indulgences in what ſort ſoeuer they are
taken: for this euill proceedeth from appointing puniſhments
ſo hard, that they are conſtrained afterwards to reuoke
them. But if ſatisfaction doe conſiſt in doing good workes:
It is very il done to diſpence with men, for doing all the good
that is poſsible for them to doe. The people of the Eaſt and of
the South allow not of this abuſe, but they condemne rather
the opinion of the Romane Church, which ordaine ſatisfactions
to auoide certaine paines of Purgatorie, and teach, that by
Indulgences the ſaid paines are eſcaped, without performing
or making of any ſatisfaction: yea as if by Indulgences a man
might be deliuered from the obligation whereby he is bound
to God, to doe all that is poſsible to obtaine pardon of him.
Alſo the Apoſtolicke Churches doe beleeue, that there is neither
Pope nor any other perſon, which by Indulgences can
deliuer men from the puniſhments that God inflicteth:
which if it be ſo, that Indulgences do not deliuer a man from
temporall puniſhments of this life, as pouertie, ſickeneſſe, and
death it ſelfe, how can they deliuer him from the paines of
Purgatory? For there is the ſame reaſon for the one as for
the other. It followeth vpon the premiſes, that the Church
cannot diſpence with times and workes lawfully ordained
for proofe and diſproofe, but may well releaſe for iuſt and

reaſonable cauſes the cuſtome of confeſsing ſecret ſinnes, and
may pronounce remiſsion without any confeſsing, as they of
the Eaſt Churches doe to this day by their Synchoreſes, as
we will relate in his due place. We will then make this Catholike
concluſion, that
                  The Pope cannot by his Indulgences deliuer aniy
from thoſe temporall puniſhments which God inflicts:
neither ought he to diſpence with the doing of al thoſe
workes of repentance that are poſſible.

that Ieſus Chriſt deſcended into hell in his ſoule ſeperated
from his body, to triumph ouer Satan. The
Sybilles doe deriue this word Ades, which ſignifieth
hell, of the word Adam, by reaſon that Adam deſcended.
This place ſeemes to be elſ-where then in heauen.

to wit, that Chriſt deſcended into hell in that faſhion
as we haue ſayd (in ſuffering in his ſoule) but if any one
can defend that he deſcended in any other faſhion, it
is well, but as for me I cannot beleeue it.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THe auncient Catholike Church beleeued, that the ſoules
of the Fathers in the old Teſtament went to a place called
in Hebrew Scheol, in Greeke Ades, in Engliſh Hell.
And all Chriſtians for the moſt part doe beleeue, that the Apoſtles
haue taught ſo likewiſe, ſeeing that there is not any
one particular man knowen, that ſhould be the author of this
opinion. And although that this Article was not in the beginning
in the Creede of the Apoſtles (as it is not in the
Creed of Nice) neuertheleſſe hauing beene receiued without
contradiction, the ſame doth argue that the beleefe was
ſuch before time. And which is more, the Scripture of the
old Teſtament makes no mention in any place, that the ſoules
ſhould aſcend into heauen, but very often it maketh mention
of Scheol, or Hell, and to deſcend. I will deſcend into
Scheol, with ſorrow for my ſonne, ſayd that good man

                     Iacob: and to deſcend ſignifieth to go to ſome lowe place. It is
true that the word Scheol ſignifieth ſometimes a graue, but
the Catholike Church takes it here for Hell: for the Greeke
tranſlator approued by the Apoſtles, taketh it ſo, as alſo Saint
Luke in this ſentence of the Pſalmes, cited by S. Peter, Thou
wilt not leaue my ſoule in Hell.
                  
                  For to vnderſtand well this queſtion, you muſt note firſt,
that it doth not appertaine to ſaluation, to know whether the
ſoules of the Fathers were aboue or belowe, prouided alwayes
that one doe not call the holy Scripture into doubt, which it
is not done by and by, although a man doe not alwayes attaine
to the true ſenſe of it.
                  Secondly, there are two places that the moſt learned diuines,
yea, the antient, and now a dayes the Latins and the
Proteſtants can hardly agree off▪ So that in ſo doing, ſome
proceede in one faſhion, others in another. The Creede ſaith
that our Lord deſcended into hell, and our Lord ſaid, This
day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe. Some men will
aske,Obiection. how aſcended he into Paradiſe ſeeing he deſcended into
hell. The greater voice of the Romane CatholikesCatech. Concil. de deſc. and of the
Proteſtants is,Laſic. Theol. Moſc. that Hell was Paradiſe, when our Sauiour
was there, but there are many learned men of the Catholike
Romans, asIn 3. ſent. diſ
                           •
                        . 22. quest. 3. 
                     Durand, and the learnedIn Apol. cap. de deſc. 
                     Picus, which thinking
it abſurd to ſay that Paradiſe was in Hell, haue thought
fit otherwiſe to agree vpon it: And haue written that the
ſoule of the Lord went really vnto the true Paradice, and deſcended
not into Hell, but by efficacie or vertue. On the other
ſide, amongſt the Protestants, Caluin and Beozo, haue
thought more to the purpoſe, to referre this word Hell to the
torments that our Sauiour ſuffered; to the end, that that
which the Scripture ſaith (that our Sauiour went to Paradiſe)

ſhould be beleeued without running to any falſe or forged
Expoſition.
                  Alſo there are learned men amongſt the Latines and the
Proteſtants, which doe decline from the common opinion
herein, becauſe that it ſeemeth very abſurd vnto them.
                  Neuertheleſſe, becauſe that none of the three is receiued
without contradiction, it ſheweth that there is difficultie in
them all. For to ſay that the Lord deſcended not into Hell, but
by his efficacie or vertue, is to wreſt that place of Scripture,
Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in Hell.
                  
                  
                     To ſay that Hell, whereof mention is made in the
Creede, is the torments which the Lord ſuffered vpon the
Croſſe: is an Expoſition altogether vnknowen to the Ancients,
and againſt the intention and meaning of thoſe which
added that clauſe to the Creede, and thoſe Proteſtants themſelues
for whom this ſerueth, are ready to receiue one more
proper, as is to bee ſeene in that ſentence before alleadged of
Vrſinus. As for the reſt, one may giue many Expoſitions;
and all Orthodoxall of one ſelfe ſame place of Scripture,
when one is not aſſured of the intent and meaning of the
Authour, ſo is it likewiſe in the Creede.
                  But about theſe difficulties, the Apoſtolicke Churches in the
Eaſt doe furniſh vs with a fourth Expoſition, and that moſt
ancient of all: They hold with S. Chryſoſtome a very true
Catholicke teacher, that the ſoules of the Fathers were in
Ades (the Latines call that place Infernum &amp; Lymbus:
but improperly) and that our Sauiour deſcended thither:
And that he was the very ſame day in Paradiſe, and that Paradiſe
is no other place, but the ſame which the thiefe conceiued
and meant, for if our Sauiour had ſpoken of one place,
and the Thiefe had conceiued and meant another, his vnderſtanding

had beene deceaued. Now the Thiefe meant no
other Paradiſe but that earthly Paradiſe: for hee could not
know what Paradiſe it was, but by the Scripture of the old
Teſtament, which ſpeaketh not of any other Paradiſe. It followeth
then, that our Sauior was that ſame day in that Paradiſe,
and his ſoule was not left in hell. It is there alſo, whether
the Fathers were conducted, wherof ſome roſe with the Lord,
and were ſeene in Ieruſalem.
                  It is in this Paradiſe (ſay they) that Henoch and Elias
were placed in their bodies, and peraduenture Moſes, who
appeared at the transfiguration of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt:
and all the Fathers were rapt vp into heauen, ſome in their
bodies when our Sauiour aſcended, the other onely in ſoule,
when he roſe from the dead as the ſame Saint Chryſoſtome
ſaith,Serm. de deſc. And this opinion is not onely held by the Apoſtolicke
Churches of the Eaſt, as we haue vnderſtood by themſelues:

for the Catholike Reader to follow and approue, that is to ſay,
either of the foreſaid three opinions, or elſe that of the Churches
of the Eaſt and South, which is,
                  That the ſoules of the Fathers were in hell, called in

committed againſt the Goſpel, where it is written: That
which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which is borne of

to be deliuered, came to receiue the Sacrament, after
their vſage, law, and faith, and that afterwards her childe

was baptized, and freede from puniſhment and damnation.

                  ANNOTATION.
                  THe Proteſtants in France doe hold, that the Infants of
the faithfull, dying without baptiſme, are neuertheleſſe
ſaued. This word Faithfull ſeemes to be reſtrained to the

Elect: for there are wicked Chriſtians, againſt whom God
denouncethExod. 20. that he will puniſh the iniquitie of the fathers
vpon the children: Moreouer it may happen that the parents
may be Gods Elect, and neuertheleſſe (as all men are
ſubiect to erre) they may be negligent to procure Baptiſme
for their Infants. Now it may beCaluin Inſt. l. 14. c. 5. 22. doubted, whether this fault
be any preiudice to the Infants. Theſe conſiderations perhaps
haue moued Chriſtian people to encline to this beleefe,
that the Church ought to haſten Baptiſme, becauſe they know
not who be the children of the Elect, and that one cannot erre
in prouiding for the ſaluation of theſe Infants by baptizing
them, by reaſon that in Baptiſme (a token or ſigne ordained
by the Lord) the inuocation of the holy Trinity is vſed, and
the pardon of originall ſinne is asked for him that is baptized,
wherein we muſt beleeue that God heareth his Church.
                  The churches alwaies are carried away ſome with more care
others with leſſe. The Latin Church falleth into an extremitie,
and beleeueth the perdition of children not baptiſed, in ſo
much that ſhe permitteth not onely the Laickes, but alſo women
to baptiſe, yea Pagans and heretickes: wherein ſhe hath
a particular opinion, and that which the other Churches approue
not; to ſhew that they haue a better hope of the ſaluation
of the ſame Infants: And aboue all the reſt, the Church of
Aethiope which beleeueth, that they are ſanctified in the
wombes of their Mothers. The Grecians doe permit the Laickes
to baptize, but they thinke not the ſame to be true baptiſme.
And indeede the Moſcouites, who are vnited to
the Church of Greece, permit not the miniſtration of baptiſme
to any, but vnto Prieſts, and that within the Temple; or
at leaſt wiſe, that was the place in times paſt: for Faber hath
written ſo, about a hundred yeares agoe: peraduenture both

they and the Greekes were then of this opinion: and alſo
now a daies they rebaptize them, that are baptized by the
Laickes. The Proteſtants of Germanie doe permit the Laickes
to baptize: neuertheleſſe they confeſſe that the children
of the elect are ſaued without baptiſme, as it was concluded
by them at Wirtenberg, in the yeare one thouſand fiue
hundred thirtie ſixe. The Church of England imployeth all
the diligence that may be poſsible.
                  
                     Thus ſaith the
                     Can. 69. 
                     Canon: If any Miniſter being aduertiſed
of any ſickeneſſe and danger of death, or finding any
Infant within his Pariſh not baptized, refuſe to baptiſe
them, or do delay in ſuch ſort, that being able to
come in time where the Infant is, &amp; to baptize him, and
the ſame Infant happen to die without baptiſme by
his fault; the ſame Miniſter ſhall be ſuſpended for
three moneths, and ſhall not receiue the fauour of abſolution,
vntill he acknowledge his fault.
                  From that which hath beene ſaid, a man may drawe this
concluſion as Catholike and Orthodoxall.
                  That Baptiſme is the ordinary meanes for Infants
to obtaine ſaluation, yet neuertheleſſe God ſaueth extraordinarily
the Infants of the Elect, which haue not
neglected baptiſme, and that the Church which knoweth
not the Elect, ought to haſten by all good meanes
the baptiſme of their Infants.

in that they reiect the Sacrament of confirmation, as a

the authoritie of the Biſhoppe and of the Prieſt is alike.

but that the Apoſtles in the beginning of the Goſpell
reuealed, and confirmed at the Feaſtiuall day of
Pentecoſt, haue giuen by the impoſitition of hands the
admirable gift of the holy Ghoſt, to thoſe which beleeued
in Chriſt, to the end that they ſhould ſpeake in diuers
languages. But of a perſonall and temporall act
of the Apoſtles, there ought not to bee a generall and
perpetual Sacrament in the Church without the commaundement
of God. And it is a horrible thing to
heare it reported, that the Sacrament of confirmation
which the Biſhops Suffragans haue accuſtomed to miniſter
to infants, excelleth in dignitie the Sacrament of
Baptiſme. For there are ſome which feare not to affirme
the ſame. As it is a thing (ſay they) done by the
greateſt, that is to ſay, by the Biſhops, and cannot bee
done by the meaner ſort of Prieſts: ſo ought it to bee
held in greater honour and eſtimation.

doe iniurie to the holy Ghoſt, Anathema. If

                  THe Apoſtolick Churches of the Eaſt, North and South,
doe vſe oyle after Baptiſme.
                  
                     Socolouius thinketh that this is the Sacrament of confirmation.
We follow here a contrary opinion, firſt becauſe that
his Authors before alleaged, and others denie it. Secondly,
Zaga a Biſhop of Aethiop ſayth plainely, that there is no
oyle amongſt them, that is held for a Sacrament. Thirdly,
the foreſaid Churches do not hold the vſe of oyle in Baptiſme
by the inſtitution and commaundement of God, but by the
ordinance of the Church, which (ſay they) hath inuented many
things: (ſo ſpeakes the Patriarch Ieremie; touching the
vnction) Fourthly, the Tradition amongſt thoſe people was to
permit the Biſhops onely, to adminiſter the ſayd oyle of Baptiſme.
Fiftly, They adminiſter this oyle, only to ſhew that in
Baptiſme the Infant receiueth grace to beare the name of a
Chriſtian, a name which commeth from Chriſt, which ſignifieth
anointed: that is it alſo, which as Ieremie declareth,
alwayes is called vnction, A myſterie: wee will ſpeake
of this word, in his place. To end, the Church of Rome, doth
both the one and the other, they vſe oyle in Baptiſme as the
other Apoſtolicke Churches: but beſides in particular, they
make it a Sacrament. Moreouer if they will haue vnction
to be a Sacrament a part, it followes then vpon that that, the
foreſaid Churches haue Baptiſme well nigh in the ſame ſimplicitie
or puritie wherein it was ordained by our Sauiour:

for they adde not any thing, neither ſalt nor ſpittle. As for
the reſt, the ProteſtantsConſtit. Angl. can. 60 &amp; Cal. instit. li. 4. ca. 19. 4. doe approue confirmation by the
impoſition of hands, as is to be ſeene in the Conſtitutions of
England, but yet as a ceremonie, not calling it a Sacrament.
To conclude, the Councell of Trent, which was very neere
wholy compoſed of Italians and Spaniards, doth excommunicate
all the Apoſtolicke Churches for theſe two Articles:
firſt becauſe they hold not, beſides the vnction in Baptiſme,
a Sacrament of the vnction of confirmation: Secondly, becauſe
they ſay, that although it were a Sacrament, yet the
Prieſt might adminiſter it as well as the Biſhop: but he that
will beleeue the Catholicke Church, notwithſtanding the Anathema
of the Latin Church, will ſay,
                  That the oyle may be as well applied by the Prieſt, as
by the Biſhop in Baptiſme, and that it is no Sacrament,
that is to ſay, a ceremonie commaunded by God, or by
the Church, beſides Baptiſme.

intier confeſſion of ſinnes, and by Diuine Law it is
neceſſary for all thoſe which are fallen after baptiſme.
It is moſt certaine that Prieſts cannot exerciſe their

iudgement without hauing knowledge of the matter in
hand, and that they cannot keepe and obſerue equity
and iuſtice, in injoyning penance or puniſhment, if men
declare their ſinnes onely in generall, and not in ſpeciall.
From hence a man may gather, that the penitents
muſt declare in their confeſſions all the mortall ſinnes,
which they know in their conſciences, after ſuch time as
they haue diligently examined them, although
that they were ſecret and hid, and committed onely againſt
the two laſt commandements of the Decalogue:
which wound ſometimes their hearts more deepe, and
are more dangerous then thoſe which they commit
publickely. But becauſe that all mortall ſinnes, and euery
ſinne according to deſert, dooth make men the children
of wrath, it is neceſſary to aske pardon of all, by open
and penitent confeſsion.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  ALl Chriſtians doe confeſſe that the Lord gaue to the Apoſtles,
and to their Succeſſors, vnto the end of the
world, the charge of bynding and looſing, to remit and to
retaine ſinnes: that is to ſay, to denounce againſt the wicked
and impenitent, that they are in the eſtate of perdition, and
to the penitent and repentant, that they are in the eſtate of
grace: In ſuch ſort, that whatſoeuer the Miniſters of the
Church, which haue this office, doe open or ſhut with the keye
which was giuen them, that is to ſay, according to the trueth
of the word of God, is confirmed and ratified in them. Some
man peraduenture will aske, whether it be ſuffcient to preach
it in generall, or it be commaunded to certifie euery one in

particular. The Catholike Church anſwereth that our Sauiour
meant, that it ſhould be done in the beſt forme, by following
his example, Thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee, ſayd he to
the particulars. If one conſider well what is practiſed in the
greateſt part of the world, he ſhall finde a conformity in doctrine
and beleefe, but ſome diuerſitie in the forme and maner
of proceeding.
                  The Iacobites confeſſe not their ſinnes, but onely to God,
as many Authors affirme: The ſame is alſo true of ſome nations,
aboue all the reſt of thoſe who haue their Metropolitane
in Caramit, as Boterus ſaith, for that Church extends
into many parts of the world: The Iacobites (who
come out of Egypt) doe report that particular confeſsion is
in vſe amongſt thoſe, which are called there Iacobites and
Cophites. The Proteſtants in Fraunce confeſſe their
knowen ſinnes, either in the Church or in their Conſiſtories,
and there receiue abſolution: and their doctrine declareth,
that it is very good for the eaſing of a troubled conſcience, to
confeſſe ſinnes particularly: but none can learne when and
how the ſame is practiſed. The Reformed Proteſtants of
Germanie, Poland, and Bohemia haue eſtabliſhed an order
to confeſſe their ſinnes, and to receiue abſolution: But
without naming their faults. They of the Eaſt are not farre
from this forme of proceeding: for they ſay, that the numbring
of ſinnes which they require, is not by any diuine law,
but rather they confeſſe, that they hold it otherwiſe: for the
commaundement of the Church binds not in foro conſcientiae,
vnleſſe it be in caſe of ſcandall: but it is no ſcandall to
conceale an vnknowen offence. But the ſaid Churches of the
Eaſt doe more: that is, they hold that a man is not bound to
confeſſe that which he is aſhamed to declare: which is to open

a doore to the proceedings of the foreſaid Reformed: for
if a man be aſhamed of all, it followeth that he is not bound to
confeſſe any.
                  Moreouer, if Shame doth diſpence, wherefore doe not
other conſiderations of more importance doe the ſame likewiſe:
as the danger to be diuulged, and afterwards puniſhed
by the Magiſtrate, or diſhonoured for euer? But to ſhew
how the Churches of the Eaſt doe proceed in pronouncing abſolution
without any confeſsion made, we are aduertiſed, that
the Popes, that is to ſay, the Prieſts, doe it in particular: But
becauſe that in that Church of the Eaſt, there is a Patriarch
which gouerneth, it ſeemes vnto them (hauing regard vnto
all the Churches, to whom the keyes were giuen) that if hee
declareth that abſolution, it is more authenticke, and giueth
more conſolation to the conſcience: to content the curious
reader, we will inſert here the forme or manner of a Synchoriſme
tranſlated out of Greeke.

                      by the grace, gift and power of the
holy and liuing ſpirit, which our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt
hath giuen to his Diuine Diſciples, and the holy Apoſtles,
for to bind and looſe the ſinnes of men, ſaying, receiue
the holy Ghoſt: to whom you remit ſinnes, they
ſhall be remitted, and whoſe ſinnes you ſhall retaine,
they ſhall be retained: and thoſe that you bind on earth
ſhall be bound in heauen likewiſe, and thoſe you looſe
in earth ſhall be looſed in heauen. Wee hauing by a
ſucceſſiue deſcent receiued from them this Diuine
grace, doe abſolue N. aſpirituall ſonne of the ſame, in
all things wherein he hath erred or ſinned, as a man, and

offended God in word, deede, or thought, and in all his
ſenſes, if he be vnder the curſſe of the Biſhop or Prieſt,
or of his father or mother: or if he bee fallen into any
of his owne ſinnes, hauing ſworne by an oath, and not
performed it, or if hee hath tranſgreſſed as a man in other
ſinnes, and hath confeſſed them to his ſpirituall fathers,
and hath receiued of them the Canon exactly; of
all thoſe things and others whereby he is bound, wee
doe vnbind and looſe him by the power and grace of
the moſt adored and holy Spirit, and alſo of all things
which he hath left vnconfeſſed, whether they be by forgetfulnes,
or Shame. All which be pardoned him of the
moſt mercifull God, which is bleſſed eternally, Amen.
                  The Latines, otherwiſe called the Romane Catholikes, ſay
that our Sauiour comaunded euery one to confeſſe particularly
euery ſinne, and all the circumſtances thereof, to imploy
all poſsible diligence to remember them, and that hee that
confeſſeth not all thoſe memorable ſinnes, cannot be ſaued. If
their opinion be true, the Apoſtolicke Churches of the Eaſt,
South, North, and the Reformed or Proteſtants in the Weſt
are damned; and the gates of hell ſhall preuaile againſt the
Catholicke Church. He that liſt, let him beleeue them: ſo
many there be, that doe hold with one conſent,
                  That our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt hath not
comaunded any particular confeſſion by numbring our
ſinnes, but that it is an ordinance of the Church: which
neuertheleſſe conſtraineth no man to confeſſe thoſe
ſinnes which he is aſhamed to declare.
               
            
            
               
               QVESTION. XXII. Whether the Bread and Wine in the holy Sacrament are
changed into the body and blood of the Lord.
               
                  THE EAST CHVRCHES.
                  
                     
                        THe anſwere of the Patriarch Ieremie.
                     Cap. 10. The
tenth Chapter doth treat of the Lords Supper:
yet not amply, but (if we may ſo ſay)
obſcurely. For amongſt you, men vnderſtand
many things touching the ſame, the which agree
in no wiſe with vs. The Catholike Church therefore
beleeueth that the bread after the ſanctification is changed
into the body of Chriſt, and the wine into his
blood by the holy Ghoſt: prouided that the bread bee
leauened, not without leauen. For the Lord in that
night in which he was betraied, hauing taken bread, and
giuen thankes, broke it, and ſayd, Take eate, this is (ſayd
he), not bread without leauen, or the figure of my body,
but) my body and my blood. Neuertheleſſe at that
time, the fleſh of the Lord which he carried about him,
was not giuen to the Apoſtles to eate, nor his blood to
drinke, nor now in the diuine celebration of thoſe myſteries,
as if the body of the Lord deſcended from heauen:
for it were a blaſphemie to ſay ſo: but both then
and now by the inuocation and grace of the Almighty
Spirit, the beginner or Author of this myſterie, the
bread is conuerted and changed into the body of the
Lord, and the wine into his blood. And in another
place he ſayth thus: And from thence it commeth, that

the Maſſe or Lumpe of bread is broken in peeces, &amp; it is
not offered entyer or whole: which figureth the paſſion
of our Sauiour. And at the time that this bread is
offered, it is Common Bread, offered onely to God,
but afterwards it is made extraordinary bread, and is
chaunged in deede: but if wee would by reaſons, cauſes,
and effectes, debate and reſolue thereof, we ſhould
neede a thouſand tongues, and yet they would not bee
ſufficient. But our Sauiour hath commaunded to doe
this in remembrance of him.
                  
                     And a little after, he ſaith, that the Church is ſignified
in myſteries, and not as in Symboles; but as the
members depend on the heart, and as the boughes on
the roote of the plant: and (as the Lord ſaid) in that faſhion,
that the branch is in the ſtocke of the vine. For
here is not only a Communion of name, or a ſimilitude
of Analogie, but the identitie of the things themſelues.
For the body and blood of the Lord are true myſteries,
which are not changed into any humane bodie, but we
are changed into them: for the better things haue euer
the preheminence. Euen as Iron being vnited with
fire becommeth fire, but the fire neuer becomes Iron.
And euen as whe the Iron is glowing hot, wee ſee not
the Iron, but only the fire, the properties of the Iron not
being apparant: euen ſo alſo if a man might ſee the
Church of God, as it is vnited to him, and participates
of his body, hee ſhould ſee nothing elſe but the onely
body of our Sauiour, by reaſon whereof Saint Paul writeth,
Yee are the body of Chriſt.

ſubſtance was not created, but art the pure word;
thou art the Sonne of the Father, thou art the bread of
life deſcending from heauen, who wouldeſt come in the
figure of a Lambe without ſpot, for the redemption of
the world: Now, O thou louer of mankinde, wee doe
moſt humbly beſeech thy bounty, praying thee that
thou wouldeſt ſhew the light of thy countenance vpon
this bread, and vpon this portable Altar; bleſſe, ſanctifie,
purifie, and tranſlate this bread into thy ſpotleſſe
fleſh, and this wine into thy precious bloud, and let it
be made an ardent and an acceptable ſacrifice, and the
ſaluation of our ſoules and bodies, for thou art our
King.

redeemer Ieſus Chriſt hath ſaid, that it was his true
body, which he offered vnder the forme of bread: for
this cauſe the Church of God hath alwaies had the
ſame perſwaſion: and this holy Councell doth againe
declare it, that through the conſecration of bread and
wine, all the ſubſtance of the bread is conuerted into the
ſubſtance of Chriſt our Lord, and all the ſubſtance of
the wine into the ſubſtance of his blood. And this
conuerſion hath the Catholicke Church conueniently
and properly called Transubſtantiation.

                     Cap. 19. We beleeue that the
Euchariſt is a Sacrament inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſt
himſelfe, and the vſe thereof was recommended to the
Church, vnto the end of the world. But becauſe that
the ſubſtance thereof is one thing, and the vſe another,
we will ſpeake in order of them both.
                  Touching the ſubſtance of the Euchariſt, we beleeue
and teach, that the true body and blood of our Sauiour
Ieſus Chriſt is diſtributed in the Euchariſt, &amp; do reiect
thoſe that ſay that the bread and wine in the Euchariſt
are but ſignes of the body and blood of Chriſt being
abſent. We doe alſo beleeue, that the Almightie power
of God is ſo great, that hee may eyther bring to nothing
the ſubſtance of the bread, or change it into the
body and blood of Chriſt: but it cannot be proued by
the manifeſt word of God, that God exerciſeth in the
Euchariſt any ſuch abſolute power; and it appeareth
that no ſuch matter was knowne to the auncient
Church. But as when he ſpeaketh of the Citie of Ieruſalem,
portrayed vpon a bricke, this ſame is Ieruſalem, it
was not neceſſary that the bricke ſhould be chaunged
into the Citie of Ieruſalem: In like manner when he
ſpeaketh of the bread; this is my body, It is not neceſſary
that the ſubſtance of the bread ſhould be changed into
the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt: But it ſufficeth for
the veritie of the Sacrament, that the body of Chriſt be
truely preſent with the bread: yea rather the verity of
the Sacrament requireth, that the true bread remaine
with the true preſence of God. For euen as for the

truth of the Sacrament of Baptiſme, it is neceſſary
that in the vſe therof, the water ſhould be and remaine
true water: In like manner it is neceſſary in the Lords
Supper, that the bread in the vſe therof be and remaine
true bread; becauſe that if the ſubſtance of the bread
were changed, the veritie of the Sacrament remained
not in his true nature.

                     Art. 12. We ſay that the bread
and the wine are ſacred and celeſtiall myſteries, and that
by them Ieſus Chriſt the true bread of life eternall, is offered
vnto them that are preſent, that doe receiue his
body and blood through faith: Neuertheleſſe we ſay
not, that we beleeue that the nature of the bread and
wine are wholly changed and reduced to nothing.
                  
                     Liturgia Gall. Let vs lift vp our ſpirits and our hearts,
where Ieſus Chriſt is in the glory of the father, and
from whence we looke for our redemption. And let
vs not dwell vpon theſe earthly and corruptible Elements,
which we ſee with our eyes, and touch with our
hands, to ſeeke for it there, as though it were incloſed
in the bread or wine. For then our ſoules ſhall be fit to
be nouriſhed and reuiued by his ſubſtance, when they
ſhall be eleuated aboue all terreſtiall things, to obtaine
heauen, and to enter into the kingdome of GOD where
he dwelleth.

                     Art. 36. We do confeſſe
that the holy Supper of the Lord is a teſtimony vnto
vs, of the vnitie which wee haue with Chriſt Ieſus, becauſe
that he is not onely dead and riſen againe for vs:
but alſo nouriſheth and feedeth vs truely with his fleſh
and blood, to the end that we ſhould be one with him,

and that his life ſhould be our life. And albeit that he
be in heauen, vntil ſuch time that he ſhal come to iudge
the world; yet neuertheleſſe we beleeue that through
the ſecret and incomprehenſible power of his ſpirite,
he nouriſheth and quickeneth vs by the ſubſtance of
his body and blood.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  ALl Chriſtian nations do with one conſent agree, that the
bread and wine of the holy Sacrament are conuerted into
the body and bloud of the Lord. It is true which Alphon. de
Caſtro ſaith, that the Armenians haue heretofore otherwiſe
beleeued, but he ſheweth not, whether it was their auncient
manner, or whether any particular man brought it in
amongſt them. As touching the Abyſſins, there is mention
made oftentimes of tranſmutation in their Liturgie,
which they referre to the Apoſtles, according to the ſubſcription
thereof. But theBerth. tabu. geog. de Abyſſ. after many others. Hiſtoriographers doe ſay, that
the ſaid Abyſſins were not Chriſtians ſo long agoe as they
make vs beleeue. They report themſelues to haue receiued
the Chriſtian faith, by the Eunuch of Queene Candace, and
by Saint Matthew, and Saint Philip: But it is thought in
theſe parts, that in the fifteenth yeare of Iuſtinian Emperor
of Conſtantinople, Adad King of the Auxumites made a
vowe to become a Chriſtian, if he got the victory againſt the
King of the Omerites; which hauing obtained, he ſent Embaſſadours
to the Emperour Iuſtinian, to haue Biſhops ſent
to him, which being come thither, conuerted his people to the
faith. Both opinions may be true, that is to ſay, that Adad
would haue receiued the faith, and yet not after the forme of

the other Ethiopians, but rather after the Eaſt Church. In
like manner the French men receiued the faith vnder king
Clouis, the which faith notwithſtanding, was in Fraunce
three hundred yeares before. Likewiſe Great Britaine is
ſaid, to haue receiued the Goſpell by Ioſeph of Arimathea:
Yet neuertheleſſe the Romanes doe bragge that they conuerted
the Engliſh men fiue hundred yeares after. Howſoeuer it
be, the Liturgie of the Ethiopians came vnto them from the
Sea of Alexandria, as appeareth by the Greeke names which
are inſerted therein. Aluares ſaith, that they haue another
ſo briefe, that it was no ſooner begun, but it preſently ended:
One might doubt whether this were not the auncienteſt. If
we had the bookes which the ſaid Aluares ſaith that they
haue in great number, one might know whether they differ.
But howſoeuer it be, it appeareth not, that this beleefe of
Tranſmutation was receiued in any place of the world as a
new thing. Now a daies it is a queſtion whether the Fathers
haue beleeued it, or whether it be ſlipt in by little and little.
If the Latines and Greekes do alleadge proofes out of the Fathers:
the Proteſtants doe thinke them to be Hyperbolicall
tearmes, for to lift or moue mens ſoules to the worſhipping
of the Sacrament. If the Proteſtants doe bring on the contrary
ſide other proofes: ſome will anſwere them that the
Fathers did keepe cloſe that beleefe, for feare of giuing occaſion
to the Pagans to mocke them. We will leaue theſe difficulties:
the Fathers are not in the worlde now to reſolue
vs: But the Churches ſcattered through the vniuerſall
world, are as yet to beare witneſſe of the Tradition in this
point as well as in others, and to declare and explane their
meaning to thoſe that vnderſtand it not. Well then, ſeeing
that the bread and wine in the Sacrament are changed, wee

muſt examine their diſcourſe to find who doth ſwarue from
the Catholike faith.
                  There are foure things in a true bodie, Firſt the matter,
Secondly the accidents and eſſentiall properties, Thirdly the
forme, which the Philoſophers hold to giue life or being to a
thing, Fourthly the hidden properties which depend vpon
the forme.
                  As touching the accidents and eſſentiall properties of
the body of the Lord, all doe confeſſe that they are not in the
Sacrament: but rather the accidents and properties of the
bread.
                  As concerning the matter of the ſaid body: the Latins
doe beleeue that it is inuiſibly contained vnder the accidents
of bread, and that the matter of the bread becomes nothing:
but the beleefe of the Churches of the Eaſt and South ſeemeth
to be quite contrary to that. Firſt the Patriarch Ieremie abſolutely
ſaith, that the fleſh of our Sauiour which he carried,
was not giuen to his Apoſtles to eate. From whence it followeth,
that they did eate ſome other matter, which neuertheleſſe
was alſo the body of Chriſt. Moreouer hee expoundeth
it, ſaying, that it is as Iron or Wood burnt, which is called
fire, becauſe that the fire ſurmounteth or ouercommeth: and
the mater of the Iron is not reduced to nothing. As concerning
the third, he ſaith in like manner, that thoſe that doe
communicate the Sacrament, are chaunged into the body of
Chriſt, and that the Church is the true body of Chriſt: Neuertheleſſe
euery one confeſſeth, that the matter of humane
bodies is not reduced or brought to nothing. Likewiſe one
may ſee that the Church is called the true body of Chriſt, or
elſe if the bread be called the true body of Chriſt: this word
True, is put as oppoſite, (euen as the ſame Author doth expound

it) to the bare ſimilitude, figure, or proportion, and
not as referred to the identitie of the matter. The Churches
of the South ſay the very ſame: they do pray in their Liturgie
or ſeruice, that God would chaunge the bread and wine of
the Sacrament, as he changed the water into wine in Cana:
for the matter of the water was not reduced to nothing, to
giue place to other wine created a new, but the water loſt his
forme, and that matter which was before water, receiued the
internall forme, and all the qualities and properties of wine.
Theſe conſiderations and many others, the which would bee
too tedious to recite, doe make ſome Latin writers (and amongst
the reſt Durandus) to beleeue, that the bread looſeth
his forme, and not his matter, no more then the accidents
and properties thereof. It is alſo to be noted, what the
foreſaid Ieremie ſaith againſt conſubſtantiation, that there
is not two things in the holy Sacrament, to wit, the bread and
the body of Chriſt: but one onely, to wit, the body of Chriſt,
giuing to note thereby, that that matter which remaineth
is no more the matter of bread, but the matter of the body of
Chriſt: as in the miracle of Cana, that matter which was
then the matter of water, whē it had the forme of water, was
the matter of wine, when it had the form of wine. And which
is more, there was no chaunge wherin the matter continued
not the ſame. And if one well waigh the ſayings of the Fathers,
who beleeued ſome miracle to be in the Sacrament, hee
ſhall find that they doe accord heerein: alſo they ſay, that the
ſubſtance of our fleſh is augmented by the Euchariſt, and that
there be two ſorts of the fleſh of Chriſt. We muſt then obſerue,
how they conceiue that the bread is chaunged into the body of
Chriſt. It ſeemes that they would onely haue it a matter, (be
it that it looſed his forme, as Durandus ſaith, or looſed it

not) which ſhould receiue the forme of the body of Chriſt, and
the hidden properties which doe proceede from that forme:
and that that forme being ioyned to the matter, it is no more
bread, neither the matter of bread; but it is the bodie of
Chriſt; and the matter of the body of Chriſt: for as the Philoſophers
ſay, forma dat eſſe rei. Some wil ſay it is a dangerous
curioſitie to ſound theſe myſteries: but I aunſwere that of
two inconueniences, the leſſer is to be choſen, and that it is a
moſt dangerous careleſneſſe to leaue the Church in diuiſion,
and to cauſe Chriſtians to be wounded and ſlaine, for want of
teaching, that the difference is not ſo great as it is imagined.
Moreouer, the learned men of the Church of Rome haue a
thouſand times more curiouſly ſearched this point, and haue
left themſelues nothing to ſay, in ſuch ſort that that will ſuffice
to make vp a peace, which they haue ſearched out by debate
amongſt themſelues. This then may likely bee gathered out
of the Liturgie of Chriſtian people, that the bread taketh the
forme of the body of the Lord, which (for the matter and accidents
thereof) is but onely in heauen: or that it receiueth
the hidden properties of the forme of the body of Chriſt, although
that this forme be not without his matter. Theſe faculties
and properties ſerue (as the ſaid Ieremie noteth) to
ſanctifie a man, and to make him capable of euerlaſting life.
If it be demaunded what this forme is? The Prince of Philoſophers
anſwereth, that mans vnderſtanding is as fitly diſpoſed
for the knowledge of naturall things, as the eyes of an
Owle to behold the brightneſſe of the ſunne. And that learned
Fernelius beginneth his booke of Phyſicke thus: When
the Spirit is free and vnbound, ſeeing the naked and
cleere ſubſtances of things, it enioyeth a moſt perfect
and cleere knowledge, but whileſt it is wrapped within

the body, it remaines in extreame ignorance.
                  
                  The Philoſophers and Phiſitians ſeeing in nature ſundry
admirable effects, haue iudged that they could not proceede
from the matter which is one in all things, but haue beene
conſtrained to confeſſe that the forme or eſſence, was the beginning
and foundation of thoſe effects. But if they acknowledged
mans vnderſtanding, vnfit to iudge of thoſe formes:
much leſſe can Diuines determine this effect, which they confeſſe
to proceede of the body of Ieſus Chriſt. Alſo that which
we doe attribute to the Chriſtians of the Eaſt and South, touching
the forme of the body of the Lord comming vpon the
matter of the bread, we cannot determine that their beleefe
is ſuch, for they reſolue vpon nothing, ſaying, That a thouſand
heads are not able to expreſſe it: which is nothing
elſe but to ſignifie, that the Sacrament may bee ſayd to bee the
true bodie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, although it be graunted,
that the matter of the bodie of Chriſt is onely in heauen. For
it ſufficeth for a change, euen in things praeexiſtent, that
there be an identitie of form, or elſe of qualities and hidden
vertues.
                  As for the Proteſtants, though they hold not the beleefe of
the ſame people, yet they haue not written againſt them, but
much againſt the Latins, who doe conſtitute accidents without
a ſubiect, one matter in many places, a body without his
eſſentiall properties, one God and man liuing in the hoſt or
bread, who heareth not, ſeeth not, feeleth not, nor taſteth
not, which is (ſay the Proteſtants) an opinion contrary to the
holy Scripture, and neuer entred into the imaginations or
hearts of the auncient Fathers, or of the Diuines of the Eaſt
and South Churches, who neuer yeelded or gaue place to the
Latins, either in quickeneſſe of ſpirit or in curioſitie: and

who haue had no want of heretickes to giue them occaſion, to
exerciſe themſelues in theſe difficulties, whereinto ſome one
amongſt ſo many learned men as they haue had, in ſo many
ages, and ſuch as haue written ſo many volumes, muſt haue
neceſſarily fallen, if that they beleeued that the body of the
Lord is materially in the hoſt or bread
                  Now wee muſt ſee how farre the beleefe of the Proteſtants
differs from thoſe of the Eaſt and other people: which to performe
we muſt enter into the conſideration of ſecret or hidden
faculties and proprieties. There are two ſorts of opinions,
touching ſupernaturall operations: ſome thinke that
God worketh immediatly in the place where the thing is,
from whence it ſeemeth that the effect proceedeth: euen as
when the water of the poole of Siloe being mooued or ſtirred
by the Angell, did ſeeme to heale, they ſay that God healed of
himſelfe and by himſelfe, euen then after the touching of
the water. Others doe beleeue that this ſupernaturall facultie
is giuen to the things themſelues, ſo that the ſayd water
receiues of God ſuch a vertue, as ſome medicines or ſalues
haue in ſome diſeaſes. For it is as eaſie for God to giue thoſe
properties to a forme, as it was for him to giue them to thoſe
that haue them euer ſince the creation of the world. Neuertheleſſe,
this is not thus done by the diuels, who cannot create
eſſences or beings, neither indue them with admirable
faculties, ſo that the diuels doe worke the like by illuſions.
                  Behold here then the difference: The foreſaid Chriſtians
doe beleeue that the matter of bread receiueth the forme of
the body of the Lord, or that the forme of bread obtaineth
the hidden properties thereof, or that there is ſome ſpirituall
thing which hath the place of forme in that matter, and
that thereupon dependeth the Myſticall vnion, whereof S.

                     Paul ſpeaketh. But the Proteſtants, whom ſome call Caluiniſts,
doe hold, that the body of the Lord is onely in heauen, together
with his quickning forme and vertue, and that a ſubſtance
proceedeth fromConfeſſ. of Coyer. him, and is applyed to the ſoules of
men by the vertue of the holy Ghoſt, and that immediately:
which certainly is a very ſlender diſputation, and of ſmall
eſtimation, in compariſon of the report which is made of it:
conſidering that all doe confeſſe, that the bread is really the
communion of the body of Chriſt, as S. Paul ſaith. Alſo
theſe words, This is my body, being referred to the whole,
ſhould be ſpoken without figure, but referred to that which
one ſeeth, that is to ſay, to the accidents, and to the matter
through the accidents, they are figuratiue. This conſideration
hath cauſed that thoſe who are called Caluiniſts and Lutherans,
and ſome Grecians in Poland, haue treated of ſome
means of agreement, imagining that the difference is not in
re, but in modo rei. This vnion hath beene hitherto hindered
by two opinions, which fall into extremities: Brentius,
Smidlin, and others, for the better prouing of the reall,
yea materiall preſence, haue had recourſe to vbiquitie: And
on the other ſide (as Iurguieius findeth fault) there are
ſome who ſpeake in ſuch ſort of the receiuing of the Sacrament,
that they haue deſtroyed by their contrary tearmes,
that which they thought to haue built vp, ſaying, that the
faithfull vnder the old Teſtament receiued Ieſus Chriſt, as
they receiue him now a daies: from whence it ſhould follow,
that if there be any myſticall vnion made, it ſhould bee
wrought onely by the Diuinitie, as in times paſt, and not by
the humanity, whereof the holy Scripture alwaies beareth
witnes, that it hath life in it ſelfe, and that it quickeneth. Others
ſay alſo, that a man doth participate of the body of the

Lord without the Sacrament, in the ſame manner as with the
Sacrament: So that one receiueth but the ſigne at the moſt.
Theſe men ſeeme not to ſpeake properly, for one is not ſaid
to receiue that, which he hath ordinarily. See heere the diuers
termes that are vſed. But the truth is, that Vbiquitie
is reiected in the body by the Lutherans, and the reall communicating
with the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt, is confeſſed
by the others in the body, as it was reſolued in the Synods
at Rochell in Fraunce, and at Torun in Poland.
                  
                  We will bring in here two ſimilitudes, by the which amongſt
others, Proteſtants doe cauſe their meaning to be vnderſtood,
and doe ſhewe that the communion which they beleeue,
is reall, and neuertheleſſe hath no abſurdity in it. The
body of the Sunne (ſaith Caluin) is onely in heauen, notwithſtanding
the light thereof is here vpon earth. Therefore
many doe hold that light is a ſubſtance, otherwiſe it ſhould
not be found out of his proper ſubiect. Moreouer the Philoſopher
ſaith, that Sol &amp; homo generant hominem:
Wherefore then ſhould not the Sunne of righteouſneſſe haue
power to regenerate a man, though his body be not on earth?
The Adamant ſtone (ſaith Beza) draweth Iron, communicating
it ſelfe with the Iron, through an admirable vertue,
without mingling his matter therewith: In like manner
the body of the Lorde vniteth it ſelfe with a mans ſoule,
though the matter of his body be no where elſe but in heauen.
Hereupon that is to be noted, which Gilbertus a learned
Phyſition obſerued, that is to ſay, that the forme of the
Adamant is carried out of the limits of his owne matter,
and is found in the Load-ſtones ſubiect, and not in the ayre
betweene both. It may be ſaid likewiſe, that the body of the
Lord doth communicate it ſelfe from heauen without extenſion,

multiplication, or any mixture of matter. If a man
hold himſelfe firmely to theſe ſimilitudes, he ſhall neuer ſet
his imagination or thoughts vpon the place of Realitie: for
theſe effects of nature are reall and true.
                  To conclude, a man may ſee by that which hath beene ſpoken,
that the Churches of the Eaſt and thoſe of the South doe
not approue this laſt opinion, neither that of the Lutherans:
withall, as it ſeemeth, they hold not that of the Latines, touching
the reall eating of the matter of the body of the Lord:
neyther the abſurdities that followe thereupon; for they
doe openly denie that the Apoſtles did eate the fleſh, that our
Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt did carry about him. This then is
their ſaying or opinion:
                  That the body of the Lord, as touching the matter
and accidents, is onely in heauen, yet notwithſtanding
the bread and wine in the Sacrament are changed into
the body and blood of the Lord, in ſuch a faſhion as
none can vtter or comprehend; in like manner as the
faithfull, which receiue it, are ſaid to be changed into
the true body of Chriſt.

the ſignes, dependeth vpon the onely ordinance and
promiſe of God, although it be not locall, nor in any
naturall manner. Theſe men on the contrarie ſide (that
is to ſay the Latins) will by the vertue of three or foure
words haue the bread to be changed into the body, and
the wine into the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, which would
be plaine ſorcerie.

                     Seſſ. 3. ca. 3. The true body of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, &amp; his true blood, together with his ſoule
and his diuinity are vnder the form of bread &amp; wine; but
his bodie is vnder the forme of bread, by the force and
vertue of the words.
                  
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  IN the Liturgie of the Churches of the Eaſt and South,
there are three principall parts, as wee haue beene inſtructed
by thoſe of that Countrey.
                  The firſt conſiſteth in the hiſtorie or narration of the inſtitution
of the holy Sacrament: at that time (ſay they) although
one doth pronounce theſe words, This is my body,
it maketh not the conſecration.
                  The ſecond part is the prayer or prayers, wherein they beſeech
God that the ſignes may be changed: then ſay they, is the
conſecration made. For by prayers a man obtaineth that
which he demaundeth: and our Sauiour did the ſame after
that he had taken bread, for it is ſayd that he bleſſed or conſecrated
it.
                  
                     
The third part is, when they addreſſe their wordes to the
people, ſaying, Take, eate, this is the body of the Lord:
Words which declare vnto the people, and teach them, that
it is that, which is preſented vnto them. In like manner our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſpake to his Apoſtles, not to the bread, when
he ſayd, Take, eate, this is my body. The Proteſtants doe
ſay (as the foreſaid people) that they doe bleſſe the bread and
wine principally through prayers, and not through thoſe
words, to the which God hath not giuen any intrinſecall vertue
to conuert ſubſtances.
                  The difference betweene the Church of Aſia, Africa, and
the Reformed is, that thoſe Reformed Churches aske not, nor
obtaine not by their prayers, as the foreſaid Churches do pretend,
that the bread bee changed into the body of Chriſt:
but do aske and obtaine that that body may be giuen them in
the Communion, which they ought to ſue for. All men alike,
doe condemne the opinion of the Latins, who beleeue that
tranſubſtantiation is made by theſe words, Hoc eſt enim
corpus meum: or to ſpeake better, by the laſt ſillable, Vm,
This opinion of the Church of Rome, is the cauſe that the
learned men amongſt them who receiue it, doe enter into very
great difficulties and doubts amongſt themſelues, in deſiring
to take away (ſome by one meanes, and others by other)
the abſurdities which follow thereupon. The Chriſtian Reader
may aduiſe himſelfe, which doctrine hee ought rather to
follow, whether that of the Latins, or the Catholike, which is,
                  That the conſecration and Communion of the body
of the Lord is obtained through the prayers of the
Church, and not through any vertue hidden in theſe
words, Hoc eſt enim corpus meum.

Sacrament of the Euchariſt conſecrated the day of the
holy Supper, is onely meete to be giuen to the ſicke,
and not that which is conſecrated euery day: and they
keepe it alſo all the yeere long in a Cup, prepared for
that purpoſe, ſometime till it be full of Wormes, and
ſpoyled, and they giue it in a little ſpoone. Moreouer,
they conſecrate Salt in Chalices of wood, and caſt the
kernels thereof being dried among their ſmall linnen.
They conſecrate (for them that goe to the warres)
Wheaten bread in the body of Chriſt, &amp; deliuer it into
the hands of the lay people, who vpon the very point of
the battell, doe fill with ſome liquor or other the firſt
veſſell that comes to their hands, fit to containe meate
or drinke, and putting therein this bread, they doe communicate
in order.

harme and perill that the little children doe endure

                  ANNOTATION.
                  THe paſſages or places before alleadged, ſeeme not to bee
to the purpoſe of this queſtion, neuertheleſſe they ſatiſfie
ſufficiently. We ſearch out in this Treatiſe the Tradition
of Chriſtian people, and becauſe that this queſtion hath
not bene diſputed vpon before this time, a man cannot finde
any expreſſe teſtimonies: in ſo much that it muſt be gathered
from the practiſe of the Church, what her beleefe is. Some
man will aske, whether Chriſtian people doe beleeue or haue

beleeued, that after the vſage of the Sacrament, the body of
the Lord be in the reſt of the bread and wine conſecrated, and
whether the reſt of the bread and wine bee holy things, or
whether they haue no holineſſe in them, euen as the water of
Baptiſme, which is not ſcrupulouſly kept, after it is once vſed.
The Romane Church holdeth the affirmatiue, that is to
ſay, that the bread being loſt, the wine being ſhed or ſoaked
into wood, are and ſtill remaine the true bodie of Chriſt, as is
to be ſeene by the cautions of the Canon before alleadged. But
ſeeing that other people take not ſuch care to keepe the remnants,
and to gather them vp religiouſly; it followeth, that
they beleeue not that it is in any wiſe the body of our Sauiour
Ieſus Chriſt. When we ſpeake of the remnants, we meane not
that which is pretended to be kept for the ſicke: for that remainder
is thought to abide ſtill chaunged in thoſe places
where that cuſtome is, to wit, in the Eaſt: but not in the
Churches of the Abyſſins, or Aethiopians. The Maronites
of Ieruſalem, who ſucke the Sacrament of blood with a pipe,
cannot draw out all. Thoſe that doe eate with little reuerence,
and doe caſt away the rest of the ſacred bread, attribute no
more to it. The Abyſſins although that they waſh the baſen
wherein the Sacramentall bread was, and doe drinke the water,
and alſo ſeeme to doe it with reuerence and care: yet neuertheleſſe
ſeeing that they cauſe the little children perforce
to eate this ſacred bread, it cannot be otherwiſe, but they muſt
needs looſe ſome of it. As touching that which is practiſed
amongſt other nations, to vſe wooden Chalices, that ſheweth
manifeſtly that they attribute not, or that their Anceſtors
haue not attributed any diuine vertue to the leauings which
ſoaketh into the wood. Howſoeuer the law of Pope Pius be,
it is not obſerued: for the wooden Chalices nor the pipes are

not ſcraped nor burned, neither the aſhes kept within the Altar.
From thence may be gathered,
                  That they beleeue not, that the Remainder of the
Sacrament (wherewith no man meanes to ſerue his
turne any more) is the body of Chriſt.

                  THe Chriſtian nations, contrary to the practiſe of the
Latine Church, doe thinke that we ought to follow the
example of the Lord, and to obey his commaundement. He
broke the bread and gaue the peeces to the Apoſtles, and commaunded
them to doe as he had done, that is to ſay, to giue to
the Communicants the peeces of one ſelfe ſame bread. This
Circumſtance is noted in that great Myſterie, whereof Saint
Paul ſpeaketh: It is (ſaith he) a great Myſterie in Chriſt
and the Church: and he ſheweth that all the faithfull do participate
of the ſame body of the Lord, and are one body amongſt
themſelues. The cuppe of bleſſing (ſaith S. Paul)
which we bleſſe,
                     1. Cor. 10. 16 
                     is it not the communion of the blood
of Chriſt? and the bread which we breake, is it not the
communion of the body of Chriſt? for we that are many,
are one bread, and one body: for wee are all partakers
of one bread.
                  
                  And as for the reſt, our Sauiour would that a man ſhould
doe that which he did, and that in remembrance of him. And
this Sacrament is not ſimply a memoriall of him, being conſidered
as he is in heauen, but a memoriall of his paſsion: and
alſo of the effect thereof, which is to make them that communicate
partakers of his body, being broken for them all. The
foreſaid Chriſtians doe thinke that thoſe little Wafers are

not fit to call to mind that Communion. They ſhew rather
that the Lord was not broken, and that euery one hath his
Chriſt apart. This therefore ſhall be the Concluſion:
                  That in the holy Sacrament, the bread ought to be
bigge enough, and that it ought to be broken, and the
parts there of diſtributed to the people.

Wine conſumed in the Water. Alſo in ſtead of wine
they vſe ſometimes the Iuice of Apples, which they
colour with ſome redde berries. They make no ſcruple
to put in ſo much water after the conſecration that

the wine being conſumed by the number of the Communicants,
there remaineth no taſte of wine at all.

                  ANNOTATION.
                  THe diuerſitie of the practiſe of Chriſtians doth declare,
that this is an indifferent point, for the which we ought
not to conteſt and ſtriue. And the one part ought not to condemne
the other. The Armenians doe mingle no water.
The Grecians mingle it not at the ſame time that the Latines
doe. The Abyſſines and Indians mingle it not for any
ceremonie, but vſe wine that hath more water then wine.
The Moſcouites care not whether there bee more wine or
water. Alſo no man knoweth, whether our Sauiour did
mingle more of the water or of the wine. The Proteſtants
finde no fault with the Northren nations that vſe Syder:
What ſhould one doe (ſaith Bucanus) in a Region
where is no bread, as ours wherin is no wine? we muſt
vſe ſuch food as men vſe in thoſe Countreys, for that agreeth
with the intention of Ieſus Chriſt.
                  
                  The Catholike concluſion drawen from that before alleadged,
is,
                  That there is neither Diuine or Eccleſiaſticall Law,
that condemneth thoſe that mingle, or thoſe that mingle

not water with the wine, whether it bee by way of
Ceremonie, or without Ceremonie.

that afterwards it hath bene receiued by the Prieſts, and

all this notwithſtanding; the Law, and authority of the

God will be obeyed, yea Adam and all his children
and race, for hauing eaten of the forbidden fruit was loſt.
And God would haue ſlaine Moyſes, becauſe that his Sonne
was not circumciſed. Vzzah fell downe dead, becauſe hee
touched the Arke, notwithſtanding his good intention. It is
a wonder to ſee that thoſe that beleeue this, haue yet made a
Law contrary to the Diuine commaundement of God. The
fault is now a dayes knowen to many; yet they will not confeſſe
that there is any error therein, for feare leaſt men

about the right vſe of this liuely Sacrament of the

crowne of all the Saints, to the end that it may ſhine

                  ANNOTATION.
                  ALl Chriſtian Nations doe agree together againſt the Romane
Church, that none ought to keepe the Sacrament
to employ it to any other vſe, then that to which our Sauiour
hath dedicated it, to wit, the Communion: And therefore it
ought not to be carried in Proceſsion, as Pope Clement hath
of late time commaunded, in the inſtitution of the feaſt of
God, or Corpus Chriſti. As for the reſeruation which is
made to be caried to the ſicke, it is not in vſe in the Churches
of Affrica, but the Grecians and Latines doe approue it, yea
and the Proteſtants likewiſe, as appeareth in the place before
mentioned.
                  Thinkeſt thou (ſaith Beza) that none ought to celebrate

it was the cuſtome to ſend the Euchariſt by the Deacons
to the ſicke, being abſent, to whom I doubt not,
but that the ſame did bring great conſolation: I deſire

                  THere is no Catholicke (ſaith
                     De Sacr. Eu. l. 4. c. 29. Bellarmine) that teacheth,
that the Sacramentall ſignes muſt be adored
in themſelues, and properly, with that worſhip which
is called Latria, but that they muſt be worſhipped with
a leſſer honour, which belongeth to all Sacraments.
But we ſay that Chriſt muſt be worſhipped in himſelfe,
and that adoration or worſhippe dooth belong to the
ſignes, in regard that they are conceiued to be the ſame
thing with Chriſt: euen as they that adored Chriſt, being
cloathed vpon earth, adored not him onely, but alſo
his habite, for hee commaunded not himſelfe to bee
ſtript naked.
                  
                     
The Latines doe accuſe the Proteſtants, becauſe that they
worſhip not the Sacrament, or Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament;
but if a man conſider the matter well, he ſhall finde that they
doe all that Bellarmine requireth.
                  
                     Socolouius to ſhew that there is a great defect, yea impiety
in them, layeth before them the example of all the
Chriſtians of the world, who (ſaith he) doe worſhippe or adore
Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, euery one Suo modo.
And if one can ſhew that the Proteſtants doe the ſame alſo,
Suo modo: thoſe that ſearch out occaſion to complaine, ſhall
they not haue reaſon to be content? Bellarmine ſpeaketh of
the worſhipping of the ſignes, and of the worſhipping of Ieſus
Chriſt ſignified In both theſe the Proteſtants doe vſe
ſuch adoration as Bellarmine himſelfe doth paint out. Thoſe
that honoured our Sauiour being in his Clothes, had not any
intention or meaning to honour or adore his cloathes: likewiſe
following the example of Bellarmine, be it that a man
haue no intention to honour the Sacrament, he is blameleſſe.
If Bellarmine doe ſay, that the Cloathes of the Lorde were
worſhipped per accidens: I doe anſwere him, that in like
manner the Proteſtants doe honour the ſignes per accidens
In Germany they receiue the Sacrament vpon their knees:
The conſtitutions ofCan. 23. England do ordain the like. In ſo doing
they doe adore Ieſus Chriſt before the Sacrament, that is to
ſay, the Sacrament per accidens, with a more humble ceremony
then the Chriſtians of the Eaſt doe, who (as Vilamont
ſaith) receiue it not vpon their knees. The Churches of
the South doe the like. If the Frenchmen doe follow their
example, they adore it alſo: eorum modo, and Suo modo.
                  
                  The Romane Catholikes themſelues doe not kneele alwaies
when they pray or adore, as it is ſeene in the benediction of

the table, it ſufficeth then in adoring to haue the head vncouered,
according to the ordinance of Saint Paul. As for the
reſt, thoſe of the Eaſt doe eleuate or lift vp the Chalice in
ſaying to the people Proſchomen, agia tois, agiois: let vs
prepare our ſelues, holy things are for holy people. Theſe words
doe ſhewe that this eleuation of the Cup is not to require any
adoration, nor to be a ſigne of a ſacrifice: but it is done
after the example of Ieſus Chriſt, who ſaid to his Apoſtles,
Take, eate. In like manner it is very well ſpoken to all the
people, that they may prepare themſelues to take it, yea, our
Sauiour did ſhew it to his Apoſtles, when he ſaid Take, and
the Apoſtles ſaw it. And when there bee many people in
a Church, and the Altar is low, it cannot be ſeene of the people
without eleuation: but there needeth not any ceremonie
of inclination or bowing then (for the eleuation is not to
that end) it is good at the very inſtant of receiuing. If the
queſtion be of the adoration of Ieſus Chriſt, there is none that
will not confeſſe, but that he ought to bee worſhipped properly
and with that honour called Latria, in the Sacrament. But
the Proteſtants ſay that to doe this, men muſt lift vp their
hearts on high, as it is ſaid in all the Syrian, Grecian, Romane,
and Aethiopian Liturgies.
                  Theſe words Surſum Corda, doe declare that we muſt
worſhip him in heauen, and ſuch as he is: in ſo doing we ſhall
not deceiue our ſelues. But he ſhall deceiue himſelfe that imagith
him to be vnder the figures: for if he doth honour him
vnder them, as if he were there in ſuch manner as he is in
heauen, that is to ſay, hauing his diſtinct parts, he is deceiued,
for it is not ſo: and on the other ſide, one cannot imagine
ſuch a humane body, as it is ſaid that hee is; to wit, without
dimenſions, taking vp no place, without order of parts: hauing

the leaſt part of his feet and armes, with the leaſt part of
his head, without ſeeing, hearing, feeling, or mouing &amp; yet liuing.
A man cannot comprehend ſuch things, he conceiueth
that which preſenteth it ſelfe before his eyes, that is to ſay the
Figures, and erreth in the fact, although that he had no euill
intention (thinking that it had bene materially.) Moreouer,
a man cannot know whether the Prieſt hath had a meaning
to conſecrate, and ſo, either one deceiueth himſelfe, or
elſe cannot know whether he be deceiued or no. But one cannot
be deceiued, if hee remember Surſum Corda: for ſo a
man adoreth both Ieſus Chriſt, with true worſhip, and the figures,
Per accidens, as Bellarmine will haue it. This conſideration
alſo of the eleuation ſerueth to auoid an important
queſtion, that is to ſay, Whether the ceremonie of the externall
ſacrifice bee made in the very body of Ieſus
Chriſt. It appeareth here not to be ſo, for if it be not made
by the eleuation (as it is certaine that the foreſaid people doe
beleeue, ſeeing they make no eleuation) it is not made neither
in the breaking of the bread, for the bodie of our Sauiour
cannot be really broken: nor in the diſtribution, for that
belonges not to the eſſence of the Sacrifice, but rather to the
Sacrament: It followeth then, that the Ceremonie of the Sacrifice
is not made outwardly in the proper perſon of Ieſus
Chriſt, and conſequently it is a Sacrifice purely mentall and
ſpirituall. From this aboue written, and from the practiſe
of the Apoſtolicke Churches it followes:
                  That none ought to eleuate the Sacrament, neither
with an intention to cauſe it to be adored, nor to offer
it to God: vnleſſe (peraduenture) that he doe it to ſhew
it to the people, when he ſummons them to the Communion.

priuate and vnlawfull, but doth approue and command
them.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  WHen our Sauiour inſtituted the holy Sacrament, he
broke the bread, and dealt the peeces, and commanded
that others ſhould doe the like. The Proteſtants doe accuſe
the Latins for doing the contrary: for their Prieſts doe
breake the hoſt, but deale not about the peeces, which is the
principall end of breaking. The greater part of Chriſtian
people vſe the Communion, and aboue all the rest, thoſe of Africa:

which was the reaſon that Marnix ſaid, that they had
the Lords ſupper, but not the Maſſe. Neuertheleſſe the
Latines doe call the Maſſe the Ethiopique celebration. As
touching the name, it is neither Maſſe nor Supper; for
they call it Codaſh, and the bread is called by the Abyſsins
Corbon. If queſtion be about the thing it ſelfe, it ſeemeth
that euery thing ought to be conſidered according to his principall
end, and the principall end of the Codaſh, of the Cophites
and Abyſſins, is the Communion: the which Communion
is not at all in the Latine Maſſe, but the ſame Maſſe
hauing another ſpeciall principall end, to wit the Sacrifice:
it followeth that the Codaſh or celebration of the Corbon
is the Supper, according to the ſaying of Marnix, and
not the Maſſe, as Father Coton the IeſuiteDe Sacr. imagineth.
                  As for the Croſſe, waxe Candles, Cenſings, and Proceſsions
which are in vſe in the foreſaid celebration, they change
not the eſſence of the Sacrament, but rather it continueth entire,
for all that ſplendor of ceremonies: A man may gather
by that which hath beene ſpoken, that the voice of
Chriſtians is well nigh diuided into two parts. The Armenians,
Indians, Affricans, and the Proteſtants of the Weſt do
not celebrate without a Communion: But the Latines and
Grecians doe. I put the Grecians in this ranke, becauſe that
although their Liturgie holdes more of the Sacrament then
of the ſimple Sacrifice: yet they doe approue or tollerate the
Liturgies without a communion; Neuertheleſſe they ſay, that
it is not their intention: but that it is the fault of the people,
who preſent not themſelues, although that they were
ſummoned thereunto. And they forbeare not to celebrate
the Liturgie, for ſeeing that action hath diuers ends, they
thinke that although they cannot obtaine the principall, yet

they ought not to omit the other, vnles (peraduenture) ſome
man will ſay, that the Liturgie is a Sacrament to the Prieſt,
and ſerueth the people ſimply as a Sacrifice. But becauſe that
particular Liturgies were not ordained by any vniuerſall
Councell, which the one halfe of Chriſtians, or rather more,
haue not, and the Greeke Church hath onely by tolleration,
and that ſeldome, it may be ſaid; that,
                  The Liturgie ought not to be celebrated without a
Communion, which is the principall end thereof.

and obtaining the interceſsion of Saints, remedie
for diſeaſes, and ſuch like things.

in two ſortes, the one by mediation, for
gifts preſented, becauſe that they are preſented,
doe ſanctifie thoſe that doe offer
them, and thoſe for whom they are offered,
and doe make them fauoured of God: The other
by receyuing, for that is vnto vs the true bread and
drinke, as Chriſt ſaith. Of theſe two ſortes, the firſt is
common to the liuing and dead, for this Sacrifice is
made as well for the one as for the other. The other
appertaineth to the liuing onely, for the dead can neyther
eate nor drinke: What then? doth not that ſanctification
which commeth by receiuing, concerne them,

and is their condition worſe then that of the liuing?
That is not ſo; for Ieſus Chriſt communicateth himſelfe
vnto them, in a faſhion beſt knowne to himſelfe.

then the other, wherein is an excellent prayer. Hee
maketh no mention in that Liturgie of offering the body
and blood of Chriſt, much leſſe to ranſome by that
deede, the liuing or the dead, or to apply it for others.

but alſo doe apply the merits of this Sacrifice.
                  
                     Bucanus. The oblation of the vnbloody Sacrifice
doth continue ſafe and ſound with vs, whether one regard

the benediction of the ſignes, that is to ſay, the recitall
of the inſtitution of the Lord, and the explication
thereof ioyned with prayers: by the which (as S. Cyprian
ſaith) the paſſion of the Sonne in ſome ſort is offred
to God his father: or that by that Sacrifice one vnderſtand
the profeſſion of the faith, or the giuing of thanks,
or the Contribution of Almes.

                     THe councell of Trent.
                     Seſſ. 6. 3. If any man ſay that the Sacrifice
of the Maſſe is onely a Sacrifice of praiſe and
thankſgiuing: or only a commemoration of the Sacrifice
made on the Croſſe, and not propitiatorie: and that
it profiteth him onely that receiueth it, and that none
ought to offer it for the liuing and the dead: and that it
is a coſonage to celebrate the Maſſe in the honour of
Saints, and to obtaine their interceſſion to God, let him
be accurſed.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THis is a very hard point to be vnderſtood: Firſt it may
be demaunded, whether the Euchariſt be a ſacrifice: Secondly,
what that is that is offered: Thirdly, whether it be
expiatorie: Fourthly, whether it profite them that communicate
not: Fiftly, whether it may ſerue to obtaine the interceſsion
of Saints.
                  Firſt, All Chriſtian people doe hold it for a ſacrifice, yea
the Proteſtants, Marcyr, Beza, and Chemnitius: Bucanus
calleth it (with the Catholicke Church) a Sacrifice not

bloudie: Euery one ſeeth plainely that it is ſo. If therefore
the Auncient Fathers haue aſcribed vnto this holy Sacrifice
the propheſies of Malachie, and others, they are not peraduenture
farre wide from the intention of the Prophets. Neuertheleſſe
if the principall end of this action is to be a Sacrament:
the name of Sacrament is more fit and conuenient
for it. In a Sacrifice one offereth, at the Sacrament one receaueth:
here one receiueth not, becauſe he hath not firſt offered,
but one offereth, to the end he may receiue.
                  Secondly. The difference is not ſuch in the thing which is
offered: One cannot offer but either gifts, or Ieſus Chriſt: But
he explanes not his meaning, which ſpeakes on this faſhion,
that is, to offer Ieſus Chriſt: he was offered onely once, when
vpon the Croſſe he beſought God, that hee would receiue his
paſsion, then preſented in ſatisfaction for al the ſinnes of the
world. Moreouer he is a continuall interceſſor for men,
and preſenteth to God, not a new paſsion, which might be
the formall cauſe of expiation: for that was once done, and
cannot be done againe, vnleſſe he ſhould die againe: but hee
offereth a continuall ſacrifice of that paſsion, in that he inceſſantly
intreateth, that God would receiue that very ſame
paſsion: And to deſire of God to receiue or accept a thing, is
to offer it to him. Well then, if men doe beſeech him, that hee
would accept and receiue the paſsion of Ieſus Chriſt, they offer
it him, euen as Ieſus Chriſt offred it him: but with this difference,
that Ieſus Chriſt offred it by himſelfe alone, and immediatly;
and men doe it by the meanes and interceſsion of
the great Sacrificer, and by ſeconding his ſacrifice, and adioyning
their owne vowes. But ſome man will ſay, hereupon it
followeth, that in all praiers Ieſus Chriſt is offered. The anſwerere
is, that there are foure ſortes of offering: the firſt is,

that by the which Ieſus Chriſt offered himſelfe in ſuffering
on the Croſſe: then he beſought God either by expreſſe words
or in ſilence, that God would receiue his paſsion there preſented.
Secondly, Ieſus Chriſt at his laſt ſupper by the breaking
of the bread, and by the diſtributing thereof, repreſented his
Paſsion, and obtained of God that the Apoſtles might receiue
that expiation, which was to be merited by his then approching
paſsion. In like manner he is offered in the Euchariſt,
and that faſhion of offering by ſignes is called Sacrifice.We ſpeak with the voice, the heart, &amp; by ſignes, ſaith Bellarmine, in his 2. booke and 30. Chap. De Imag.
                     
                  
                  Thirdly, vnder the Law they offered ſacrifices, which figured
the paſsion of the Lord, and his onely Sacrifice: but thoſe
were bare figures. For the Fathers, although that they knew
that they ſhould be ſaued by the Meſſias, yet they knew not altogether,
or at leaſt cleerely, that the ſame ſhould be accompliſhed
by his ſacrifice vpon the Croſſe and paſsion of our
Sauiour: It is to be ſeene, that the Apoſtles themſelues, euen
after that they had beene inſtructed, could not conceiue this
in their hearts and ſoules. So that the auncients in ſacrifiſing
intended not to offer the onely ſacrifice of the Paſsion of
Chriſt.
                  Fourthly, there is a mentall ſacrifice, which is made euery
time, that one beſeecheth God to receiue the ſacrifice of Ieſus
Chriſt: But becauſe that there is no viſible thing therein,
neither the Paſsion of Ieſus Chriſt, nor the repreſentatiue ceremonie
thereof: therfore it is not properly called a ſacrifice.
It ſeemes that this before may be agreed vpon, as well by the
Latins, as by the Proteſtants: but behold here the difference.
The Liturgies, and amongſt the reſt that of the Romane
Church, doe not explicate this point cleerely: but ſay indiſtinctly,
that God receiueth Ieſus Chriſt: ſo that one cannot know
whether it muſt be vnderſtood, that God is intreated to re

receiue or except the action preſented by the Prieſt being conſidered
in himſelfe; or whether one deſireth that God would
receiue the ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt repreſented by the action
of the Prieſt. Moreouer one cannot know whether he ought
to vnderſtand, that God receiueth Ieſus Chriſt conſidered in
his Paſsion; or conſidered as he is beleeued to be in the hands
of the Prieſt. For if a man pretend to offer him in this laſt
faſhion, that will not be to preſent or repreſent the auncient
and only ſacrifice, but to make another, and of another qualitie,
although that it be the very ſame hoſt. And it is this
very point, that the Epiſtle to the Hebrews doth contradict,
ſaying,Heb. 10. 5. to the 15. 
                     That Ieſus Chriſt offreth not himſelf again, That
is to ſay, conſidered in the eſtate wherein he is at this preſent;
but yet he offereth himſelfe, as hee is conſidered in the ſacrifice
of his Paſsion alwayes preſented before God. That beforeſaid
(which of other men might haue bene better explaned)
being well and truely diſtinguiſhed, may take away the
offence riſen thereupon. But it is not in theſe dayes that theſe
words of offering Ieſus Chriſt, haue troubled the Chriſtian
world.
                  
                     Peucer
                     Chronol. li. 4 ca. Manuel. writeth, that in the time of the Emperour Manuel
Comnenus, this very ſame thing was debated in
Greece, euen as it is here with vs now a dayes. In this time
(ſaith he) was argued that queſtion touching the oblation
which is made in the Maſſe, for the liuing and the
dead. Some men doe diſpute of the Canon of the
Greekes, which ſpeaketh more ſtrictly then the Latins,
that is to ſay, that in the Maſſe the Sonne of God offereth
himſelfe to his Father, and is offered by the hands
of the Prieſt, and whoſoeuer contradicted that fiction
was depoſed and baniſhed. Hereby a man may ſee that many

haue beleeued that the meaning of the Liturgie is, that
Ieſus Chriſt is offered, being conſidered ſo, as he is beleeued to
be there: which being taken in that ſenſe, cannot bee true.
And it is nothing to the purpoſe, to ſay that becauſe hee is offered,
therefore it is neceſſary that he ſhould be there really
and materially: for Saint Irenaeus
                     Aduer. haereſ. cap. 34. ſaith, that Altare noſtrum
eſt in coelis: Our Altar is in heauen, and likewiſe the
hoſt. Ieſus Chriſt is alſo very neare to God, and the ſame
Chriſt conſidered in his onely ſacrifice, is in heauen, as he was
on the earth. Say it bee true, that all the foreſaid Chriſtians
doe thinke (as it hath bene ſaid) that the matter which was
the matter of bread, is the matter of the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt,
in this faſhion it may bee ſaid to bee preſent in the Sacrament:
but that is not of the eſſence of that ſacrifice, ſo as the
Church pretendeth. When I name the Church, I doe imagine
that the Doctors and Teachers thereof, if they haue not
well explaned themſelues, will doe it better hereafter.
                  Thirdly, there is no great difficultie in the demaund, that
is, whether that ſacrifice be expiatory and propitiatory. If it
be meant in that ſenſe, as prayers are called propitiatorie,
there is no danger. The Publicane ſaid, Be mercifull (O
God) vnto me a poore ſinner. This was done, God was
mercifull vnto him, he receiued remiſsion and forgiueneſſe
of his ſinnes, and obtained all this by his prayers: a man obtaineth
no leſſe in the Sacrament.
                  Fourthly, Some man may aske whether the Liturgie profiteth
them that Communicate not. The Africanes are altogether
for the Proteſtants: for they ſay no Maſſe, neither
for the liuing, nor for the dead. As for the Grecians they
make no great matter for thoſe that communicate not: but
admit that they ſay for them particularly, or that they doe

comprehend them in the publike Liturgie: they diſtinguiſh,
and that very well, ſaying, that in the Liturgie there muſt be
two things conſidered. Firſt the praiers and gifts which are
preſented, that (ſay they) doth profite thoſe which communicate
not. The Proteſtants confeſſe the ſame, for they themſelues
in the prayers of the Liturgie, doe pray for men: well
then to pray, giue and offer in the Church, to obtaine Gods
grace for another, is a deede which cannot be euill: all which
is graunted for thoſe that are aliue and Communicate not:
for as concerning the dead, the Grecians meane thoſe that are
in Paradiſe, as hereafter ſhall bee declared: therein they are
not approued, neither by the Romane Catholicks, nor by the
Proteſtants: ſeeing neither the one nor the other pray for the
Saints which are in Paradiſe. Now remaineth the principall
point, yea all the Sacrament, to wit, the breaking and
the receiuing thereof. The Grecians doe ſecretly confeſſe,
that it was not inſtituted, to the end that thoſe which eat and
drinke thereof, ſhould obtaine by that eating and drinking
any benefit, for thoſe that did neither eate nor drinke thereof:
which is as much as to ſay, that priuate Maſſes are abuſes,
being conſidered as a ſacrifice and Sacrament: but yet that
they profite thoſe for whom they are ſaid, in conſideration of
the prayers and gifts. Neuertheleſſe, leſt all ſhould ſeeme to
be attributed vnto this holy Sacrament: they ſay, that the
ſame doth verily profite, but God knoweth how. Their irreſolution
being ioyned with the practiſe of the Churches of Africa,
and of India, doth giue vs good occaſion to gather, that
the greateſt part doe hold, that ſuch Liturgies profite thoſe
nothing which Communicate not, whether liuing or dead:
vnleſſe onely in conſideration of the prayers which there are
made.
                  
                     
Fiftly, the queſtion is, to know whether the holy Sacrament
and Sacrifice was inſtituted to obtaine the interceſsion
of Saints, the healing of diſeaſes, and ſuch like. If all this be
beſides and againſt the intention of Ieſus Chrriſt, it is manifeſt,
that it were an abuſe to cōuert it to other vſes. The Councell
of Trent doth excommunicate thoſe that hold this to be
euill: it would be knowen, whether this Councell bee allowed
by the Apoſtolicke Churches. The Grecians
                     1. Reſp. c. 13 ſay, that in
their Liturgie they make mention and remembrance of the
Saints: but this is not to ſay, that they thinke that the Liturgie
was ordained to that end. Likewiſe, although that
the Armenians doe kiſſe and ſalute one another in the Liturgie;
yet no man will impute vnto them, that they doe beleeue,
that it was inſtituted for to kiſſe &amp; ſalute one another.
If the Romane Catholikes cannot ſhew, that the foreſaid Nations
doe ſay their Liturgies of purpoſe for to obtaine thereby
the interceſsion of Saints: It is a hazard but they will be
found alone in that opinion: attending to ſee if that will be,
we will here conclude, as well vpon this laſt Article as vpon
the precedents, and will ſay,
                  That the Liturgie which the Latines call the Maſſe,
and the Proteſtants the Lords Supper, is a Sacrifice
wherein the Communicants, by the receiuing of the
Sacrament and Prayers, doe obtaine forgiueneſſe of
their ſinnes: and by their prayers and offerings, and not
by the Communion, doe profite thoſe that Communicate
not: but this Sacrifice is not inſtituted to obtaine
the interceſſion of the Saints, nor for any other
vſes.

                  IN the Catholike Church of the Eaſt, VVeſt, North, and
South is manifeſtly accompliſhed, that Scripture, which
ſaith, That all languages doe confeſſe the Lord. The
Church of Rome onely (ſay the Proteſtants) labours to hinder
the ſame: They will not permit the Maſſe, nor any part of
Diuine ſeruice, to bee celebrated in the French tongue in
Fraunce: and which is more, they haue brought their Latine
ſeruice into America: But the people cannot ſay1. Cor. 14. 16. 
                     Amen,
to any purpoſe: if they vnderſtand not that which is
ſaid in the Church, their vowes and their intentions cannot
be ioyned together with thoſe of the Prieſt.
                  The Prieſt and the people, which ſpeake a language vnknowne
and barbarous each to other, may thinke one thing
and ſay another: behold here the confuſion. Likewiſe one
may gather by the places or ſentences before alleadged, that
the foreſaid Apoſtolicke Churches prohibite not at all the
reading of the holy Scripture: for if it be permitted to the
Laicks, yea commaunded, to be preſent at the reading therof,
being written in the vulgar tongue: it followeth that they
may reade it alſo in priuate. There are Romane Catholickes
which on the contrary ſide doe abhorre and hate the ſame.

the Tranſlation of the holy Scripture into the vulgar tongue
is the mother of hereſies.
                  But there are many Catholikes in the Church of Rome
which are not of this opinion, and who reade attentiuely the
holy Scripture. Immitating therefore the practiſe of the
Catholike Church, we will ſay,
                  That the language of the Countrey ought to bee
vſed in euery Church, and that it is good to read the
holy Scriptures, and to heare them read in the vulgar
tongue.

which they abuſe, our men haue well vſed: And to the

which all ſucceſsion is but continuance of abuſe, and a

that after the Romane Church (which by the diſpoſing
of God obtaineth the principalitie of the ordinarie power
and authority ouer al the reſt, as a Mother and Miſtreſſe
of all the faithfull Children of Chriſt): that of
Conſtantinople haue the firſt place: that of Alexandria
the ſecond: that of Antiochia the third: and that of Ieruſalem
the fourth: reſeruing for each one her proper
dignitie: in ſuch ſort, that after that their Prelates haue
receiued the Pall or Robe, ofPallium. the Biſhoppe of Rome,
(the which is the liuery of the plenitude of the Pontificall
Office) and made vnto him the Oath of obedience
and fidelity: they likewiſe haue licenſe to giue the foreſaid
Pall to their Suffragans, receiuing of them the Canonicall
profeſsion, and taking of them promiſe of obedience
to the Church of Rome.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  THe queſtion is not here, to know in what part of Chriſtendome,
the true ſucceſsion and Ordination is to bee

found, and which is the Church that hath it not. This cannot
bee found out by the Tradition of the Churches, and
the greater number therof: for euery one ſeuerally doth condemne
in generall and in particular all the reſt. It is ſufficient
to know, whether they beleeue, that it is neceſſary for Biſhops
and Prieſts, to take their ordination from one head or
cheefe whoſoeuer he be. It may be gathered out of the Authors
afore alleadged, that they doe thinke that the Apoſtles
hauing left Succeſſors behind them in all parts and quarters,
thoſe Succeſſors had power to ordaine Biſhops: Neuertheleſſe
for order ſake, the Church hath giuen particular charge and
authoritie to the Patriarkes and Metropolitanes to ordaine
other Biſhops. Alſo the Biſhops of Conſtantinople, Ieruſalem,
Antiochia, Alexandria, and others haue equall authoritie
euery one in his owne quarter, and they are inſtalled
into their charges by thoſe of their quarter without incroaching
one vpon another.
                  Alſo thoſe of the Clergie of England haue their odinay
and lawfull ordination: for if the Church of England did
voluntarily ſubmit it ſelfe to receiue Ordination and Confirmation
from the Church of Rome, ſhe might challenge her
auncient right. Touching the Paſtors and Euangelicall Doctors
of other places, the Romane Catholikes doe thinke them
as much, or rather more, intruded without vocation, ſeeing
that Luther and Zuinglius themſelues, and others were no
Biſhops, and conſequently excluded by their Canons from the
power to ordaine. But the anſwere is, that indeed a Prieſt alone,
as a Prieſt, cannot ordaine, but a Prieſt authoriſed by a
companie of Prieſts, may: for he hath the place and power of
the body of the Presbetery. If a companie of Prieſts cannot
make a Prieſt a Biſhop, the Pope could not be a lawfull Biſhop

of Rome: for he is not made Biſhop of Rome, but by Prieſts and
Cardinall Deacons, that is to ſay, the principalleſt of the
Church of Rome; it followeth therefore,
                  That Ordination dependeth not vpon an vniuerſall
head, but onely vpon the Patriarkes or Metroplitanes
of euery place.

that there is no other difference. The foreſaid people notwithſtanding
doe differ from the Proteſtants in this one
point, that is to ſay, that they neuer receiue or admit any into
the gouernment of the Chrurch, but onely thoſe men that
are married. This hath bene practiſed in all ages, peraduenture
the Church hath had reſpect to that which S. Paul
ſaith, that a wiſe Biſhop muſt gouerne well his owne family,
ſo that they would haue none but aged and approued men.
And whereas they admit not them that are twiſe married, it
is becauſe they want not conuenient and fit men for that
charge, vnto the which the moſt continent are preferred: one
may therefore ſay,

that is to ſay, Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons.

people to receiue impoſition of hands of the Abuna,
(for no other but he could giue them orders,) the
ſaid Abuna made an exhortation vnto them, in the
forme of a Sermon, then he cauſed thē to paſſe through
a tent wherin he was, and made euery one of them read
on a booke, and if they could read, he cauſed them to
paſſe on further, and vpon thoſe that were examined,
and were found capable, he impoſed his hands, and they
were ordained Deacons.

                     Art. 20. As touching the
true Church, we doe beleeue that it ought to bee

gouerned according to the policie, which our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed: that is to ſay, that there be
Paſtors, Elders, and Deacons, to the end that puritie of
Doctrine may haue his full ſcope and courſe, that vices
may be corrected, and repreſſed, and that the poore and
all that are afflicted may be ſuccoured.

                     Diſt. 21. Cleros. All thoſe that ſerue in Chriſt his Church,
are called generally Clerkes; whoſe names and degrees
are theſe: the Doore-keeper, Pſalmiſt, Lector, Exorciſt,
Acolythit, Sub-deacon, Deacon, Prieſt, and Biſhop. And
the orders of Biſhops are fower, to wit, Patriarchs, Archbiſhops,
Metropolitans, and Biſhops.
                  
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  FIrſt, The Church is compoſed of Clerkes, ſo called of the
word Cleros, which ſignifieth heritage, becauſe that they
are after a ſpeciall faſhion, dedicated to the ſeruice of God; and
of the Laickes, that is to ſay, thoſe of the Common people, ſo
called, becauſe that they are the greateſt part thereof. Of
Clerkes ſome are Biſhoppes, that is to ſay, Superintendants,
others Prieſts, that is to ſay, Elders, others Deacons, that is to
ſay Diſpenſers.
                  Secondly, there are fiue degrees of Biſhoppes, according to
the fiue ſorts of aſſemblies or reſortes. The Parſon or Curat
which reſideth in Pariſhes (for ſo were the particular
Churches in times paſtEuſeb. l. 2. c. p. 1. called, yea the greateſt.) The Biſhops
of the Dioceſſes, gouerning the Presbiterie, or the Senate of

the Dioceſſe. The Metropolitans in the Prouinciall Synods,
the Patriarches in the Synods of nations, and the Oecumenicke
or generall (as they call the Biſhoppe of Conſtantinople
at this day) which ought to preſide or rule in generall Synods.
The Biſhoppe being conſidered without Iuriſdiction,
is by Diuine Law: Let all things be done in order, ſaith
S. Paul. If he be conſidered with Iuriſdiction, and out of aſſembly,
he is by poſitiue law. Let the Biſhops know (ſaith
Saint
                     In Epiſt. ad Tit. cap. 1. &amp; ad Euagr. 
                     Ierome) that they are greater then the Prieſts, more
by the cuſtome of the Church then by Diuine inſtitution. This
word More ſheweth that he acknowledged a certaine Diuine
authoritie in them: Therefore the Biſhoppes in the charge
of ruling or gouerning, are ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts:
For after them this charge fel to the moſt ancient
Paſtor of euery Church: One may gather by all likelyhood that
it is of ſuch Biſhoppes, which is ſpoken in the Apocalyps:
Write to the Angell of Epheſus: Write to the Angell
of Pergamus, but by and by afterwards a man holdeth it
better, that, Non aetas ſed meritum faceret Epiſcopum:
                  
                  The ſecond ſort of Clerkes are the Elders, whereof ſome
are Preachers and Doctors, and doe all that which the Biſhop
doth excepta Ordinatione.
                  
                  The others doe teach the rudiments or principles of religion,
but not in publicke, Sine

fit to doe, they are calledDion. eccl. Hier. cap. 5.

adminiſter the Sacraments, hauing ſufficient inſtructions,
contained in the Formularies of the Church. Theſe Elders
are called Papes in Greece: The Ruſsians haue few Preachers
but onely theſeTheuet. 19. 12. 
                     Papes. They are very profitable and
neceſſary for little Churches, and for the meaner ſort of people,
which get more inſtruction from a ſimple Cathechiſme,

then from a learned Sermon. They finde many men capable
of this office, and vſe to chuſe thoſe that are good and approued
people, and which are no charge to the Church.
                  In Aethiope (ſaith
                     Lib. 2. c. 14. Theuet) the Prieſts after that they
haue ſaid Diuine ſeruice, doe goe to worke to get their
liuing, ſeeing that the Reuenues which they haue, are
not ſufficient, to nouriſh them and their Familie: For
they giue not ſuch Donations to the Church there, as
they doe in theſe quarters. Of theſe Prieſts the Nouvelle
123. maketh mention: We permit not that any Prieſt
be made▪ which is not fiue and thirtie yeares of age. And
S. PaulTim. 5. 17. 
                     ſaith, The Prieſts that rule well, are worthy of
double honour, eſpecially they which labour in the
word and Doctrine.
                  The third ſort of Clerkes are the Deacons, their office is
to ſerue at the Tables or Altars: as well in the receiuing of
the gifts or offerings, as in the celebration of the Liturgie.
                  Fourthly, the Laickes doe alſo employ themſelues in Eccleſiaſticall
affaires; Princes themſelues doe rule ouer the Clergie
of their Dominions. The Elders of the people were in
times paſt Counſellors to the Biſhops. Saint Ambroſe thinkes
it not good, that men ſhould looſe any benefit of time. Thoſe
of the Clergie haue ſince that caſt away this precept altogether:
The Laickes which ſerue in the Church, are the Sub-Deacons,
Readers, Singers, Porters, Acolytes, Labourers,
and Diaconiſſes.
                  
                  Theſe according to the Councell of Nice ought not to bee
accounted amongſt the Clerkes. There were no Monkes in
times paſt. As concerning the office of Sub-Deacons, Lecturers,
&amp;c. they haue beene in ſeuerall times and places eſtabliſhed
in a formall office, yea and that with ceremonie:

Neuertheleſſe (and yet this is the queſtion, whereof Diuines
doe here diſpute) the Catholike Church doth beleeue,
                  That theſe little Offices are not Sacramentall, that is
to ſay, neyther by Diuine nor Apoſtolike inſtitution.

with another woman, he ſhall be prohibited
to enter into the Church (becauſe that the Lay-people,
enter not within, or doe not enter within the
Cloſſet, where the Clerkes be) and ſhall not participate
of their Reuenues. This I know to be true, becauſe that
I ſaw one which was called before the Patriarch for being
found a bedde with a woman, the which he could
not denie, and confeſſed the ſame in my preſence; for
puniſhment whereof hee was forbidden to carry anie
more the Croſſe in his hand, and condemned to take

vpon him the eſtate of a ſecular man. Moreouer, If a
Prieſt that is a widdower doe happen to marrie with a
woman (that is to ſay, without diſpenſation, as Zaga
ſayth) he muſt remaine amongſt the Lay people.

of orders, is imprinted a Character which
cannot be defaced, raiſed out, or taken away, as in Baptiſme,
and in Confirmation: The holy Councell hath
iuſt occaſion to reiect as damnable, the opinion of thoſe

doe ſpeake of a Spragis a Seale, or marke: Socolouius interpreteth
it a Character, peraduenture willing to perſwade
men, that the foreſaid Churches do hold with the Romane
Church, that in the ſoules of Clerkes, there is an indeleble
and perpetuall Character ſo ſurely imprinted, that after
their death it may be knowen. It appeareth not that they haue
this opinion, howſoeuer it be, both they and the Africanes doe
hold the opinion, which the Councel of Trent doth call damnable,
to wit,
                  That there is not any ſuch indeleble or perpetuall
Character, which hindereth a Clergie man to take againe
vpon him the eſtate of a ſecular man.

of the ſicke was inſtituted by our Lord Ieſus

the Romane Catholike Church and the reformed Church.
The Churches of Affrica and Aſia which doe vſe it, are manifeſtly
on the Proteſtants part. As touching the Greeke
Church, thoſe that haue trauelled thoſe parts doe proteſt vnto

vs, that this vnction or anointing is not alſo in vſe there.
Neuertheleſſe Ieremie writeth, that they hold it vntill this
preſent time as a Myſtery: It is peraduenture likely that
the vſe of oyle hath beene deliuered by ſome one or other
of the Apoſtles, but it is cleare that it was ordained
by S. Iames: it is his Tradition, which ſince his time
hath beene obſerued of vs. Thoſe of that Countrey do tell
vs, that they holde it not neceſſary, and therefore it is not
vſed, although they holde it as a Myſterie, to fill vp the tale
of the ſeuen holy numbers. Sacranus witneſſeth, that in his
time (which is but a hundred yeares ſince) the Moſcouites,
and conſequently the Grecians did beleeue, that this oile was
onely to heale diſeaſes. But becauſe that Ieremie ſayth, that
it ſerueth for the body and the ſoule, and alleadgeth for it the
very text of Saint Iames, one may eaſily reconcile that place
in ſaying, that the vnction properly regardeth corporall diſeaſes:
Neuertheleſſe conſequently it was a marke of remiſsion,
becauſe that God giueth not the one without the other.
And therefore a man may by this which hath beene
ſpoken gather, that the meaning of the Churches is,
                  That the annointing of the ſicke is one of the ſeuen
Myſteries: Neuertheleſſe the vſe thereof is not at
this time neceſſary, in regard that the ſame was purpoſely
Inſtituted for the miraculous healing of
Diſeaſes.

                  ANNOTATION.
                  HEre is a queſtion concerning the wordes Sacrament
and Myſterie. As touching the word Sacrament, noe
Chriſtian Nation is holden to vſe it: for it is grounded neither
vpon Diuine law, nor Eccleſiaſticall Catholicke law. The
word is Latine, and the Catholike Church neuer ſpeaketh Latine,
but onely Greeke in the vniuerſall Councels. If therefore
the Proteſtants will call none Sacraments, but Baptiſme
and the Euchariſt, they doe nothing either againſt God, or againſt
the Church. But theſe two Ceremonies are by them
eſteemed ſo holy, and ſo authenticall, and to haue ſuch prerogatiues,
that they thinke it meete and reaſonable to cal them by
ſome peculiar name: firſt becauſe that they are common to
all thoſe of the Church: ſecondly, becauſe that they haue a viſible
ſubſtance or matter, ordained by Ieſus Chriſt: and thirdly,
becauſe that the holy Scripture doth attribute very much
vnto them.
                  But ſome will ſay, the Proteſtants are contrarie to the Eaſt
Church, both in the name and in the thing it ſelfe: for that
Church beleeueth that there are ſeuen Myſteries. Here is
to be noted, that as concerning the word Myſterie, the Proteſtants
haue not as yet put it in vſe, and haue not defined
what that is, which may be called Myſterie. That word with
them is further extended then the word Sacrament: and

which is yet more, they confeſſe that the word Sacrament may
be taken more largely, and they proteſt, that they will neuer
be ſuperſtitious about words. Chemnitius ſaith, that it was
neuer yet ſtood vpon, but that abſolution of Penitents might
be called a Sacrament. Caluin ſaith, that Impoſition of
hands in anie Ordination, may be called a Sacrament. And
the Apologie of the Confeſsion of Ausburg ſaith the verie
ſame. Confirmation is commaunded in the Canons of the
Engliſh Church: and Caluin deſireth that it might be vſed
and practiſed. The Annointing or Vnction of the ſicke is
likewiſe a Sacrament, yea euen at this time, as Monſieur de
Moulin
                     In his anſwere to the demands. ſaith: for the reaſon wherefore it is not vſed, is,
becauſe that men ſee not the effects of thoſe daies. As concerning
Marriage, if it be likewiſe taken ſimplie, they neuer
call it a Sacrament: It is common both to the Iewes, Turkes,
and Pagans; but if one ſpeake of the marriage of Chriſtians,
conſidered as it is contracted, and bleſſed in the face of
the Church, it may be called, as the Patriarch Ieremie calleth
it, a Myſterie or a Myſterious action, and a holy celebration.
And if all, or the moſt part of Eccleſiaſticall actions may bee
called Sacraments, then more properlie may they by them be
called Myſteries: for although that the word of God in it
ſelfe be alſo called a Myſterie, yet more particularly when it
is emploied in ſome holy action. The Churches of Affrica
hold not for Sacraments, neither the Chriſme nor the oile of
Extreame Vnction, as Zaga-Zabo one of their owne Biſhops
and Aluares, who dwelt many yeares in Aethiope, doe witneſſe.
Theſe men are more credible then Titelman, and
ſuch like, who neuer were there. Peraduenture the Abyſſins
would expound them according to the beleefe of them of
the Eaſt: but ſeeing that here is nothing controuerted but

pitty vpon our Fathers and Brethren, whoſe ſoules
thou haſt receiued: giue them reſt, call to remembrance
our holy Fathers the Patriarkes, Prophets, Apoſtles,
and aboue all the reſt the holy and glorious Virgine
Marie, Saint Iohn Baptiſt, and Saint Stephan. Graunt
(O Lord) that the of ſoules them all may reſt and repoſe
in the boſome of our holy Fathers, Abraham, Iſack
and Iacob, graunt that their ſoules may inhabite and

dwell in a greene place by the waters of Comfort in the
Paradiſe of pleaſure, from whence griefe, heauineſſe, and
ſighings are chaſed away. Raiſe their bodies in the day
which thou haſt ordained according to thy true promiſes,
which cannot faile.

                     De Sanct. Beat. The firſt queſtion is, whether the ſoules
of the faithfull ſeparated from their bodies (and ſuch
as haue no need of Purgatorie) are admitted to enioy
the felicitie which conſiſteth in the cleere viſion of
God. This hath beene the opinion of auncient and
moderne heretickes, that they are reſerued vntill the laſt
day in ſome ſecret receptacle, where they ſee not God,
and are not bleſſed, but in hope. Tertullian affirmed it
firſt: Vigilantius followed him: Guido attributeth the
ſame to the Armenians. The Grecians held it in the
Councell of Florence. Luther holdeth the very ſame
error, and Caluin
                     Inſtit. l. 4. 20 alſo, who bringeth no arguments
to proue it.

                     Cha. 24. De mem. Def. The State is all one
of a Saint which is at reſt in Chriſt, and a faithfull
man that dieth, for he that dieth in the Faith is a Saint.
We doe thinke it a thing agreeable to a godly ſoule to
make an honeſt mention of his Elders departed in the
faith. Charitie requireth that we wiſh and deſire to the
dead all tranquilitie and felicitie in Chriſt. But there is

no teſtimonie in the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall doctrine,
that the dead are helped by Prayers, Watchings
and Merits, or that they obtaine in heauen a greater felicitie
thereby.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  
                     BEllarmine telleth vs, that the Churches of Greece and
Armenia doe beleeue, that vntill the day of Iudgement,
the Saints doe not enioy that perfect felicitie, which is called
the viſion or ſight of God. They thinke (ſaithL. 2. ch. 21. 
                     Vilamont)
that there are none there but the Virgine Marie, and (peraduenture)
the good thiefe. And that the reſt are in certaine
Chambers, where the Angels wont to viſite them: They
would ſay lodgings, whereof our Sauiour ſpeaketh. In my
Fathers houſe are many manſions. The Africanes doe
beleeue the ſame, as may be gathered by their Liturgie. Bellarmine
attributeth the ſame to Caluin. As for the Syrians,
their errors (ſaith Villamont) are not ſo great as theſe
of the Grecians: for they beleeue that the righteous are in
Paradiſe, and the wicked in hell, and that in praying for the
dead, their paines are diminiſhed, albeit there is no place to
purge ſoules; the Anaphore of the Syrians,
                     Anaph. D. Baſil. ſaith thus: O
Lord, Creatour of ſoule and body, remember thoſe
that are departed out of this world, refreſh them in thy
Tabernacle: paſſe them thither from horrible lodgings,
draw them out of darkeneſſe and dolour. In like maner
the opinion of the Apoſtolicke Churches, is contrarie both to
the Romane Catholickes and to the Proteſtants (but it is a curious
queſtion.) For they hold,
                  That the Saints which are in Heauen, doe not enioy

the viſion or ſight of God, vntill the laſt day, and that
we ought to pray for them, that is requeſt that God
would put them in a cleere place, or that hee would
keepe them if they are his owne, or that he would raiſe
them in the laſt day, or that hee would pardon them at
the day of the1. Mach. 12 Reſurrection.

properly to God alone, and appertaineth

that which is done to the Saints, is not properly due to
them, but (if it may be ſo ſaid) rather by accident and

by reaſon of the Cuſtome receiued, albeit that
the ſame be dangerous: neuertheleſſe it would be determined:
whether it ought to be conſtituted in that

forme, which is in the auncient prayers of the Church,
where Inuocation is made to God, and not to Saints:
and yet there is mention made of ſome interceſſion, for
it is certaine that the Saints in heauen doe pray for the
Church in generall, as godly men doe in this world.

pray to God for vs in ſome ſort: But for all the Prayers
of the Saints which are in heauen, we muſt not take occaſion
thereby to call vpon the Saints: for in the holy
Scripture there is neyther commandement nor example
thereof. And ſeeing that it is neceſſary, that he that
is called vpon ſhould be a ſearcher of the hart, the ſaints
ought not to be called vpon.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  BEhold here two queſtions: the one concerning faith or
beleefe, the other concerning the practiſe of the Church.
Firſt, A man may demaund, Whether the Saints doe
vnderſtand our praiers? The Romane Catholik Church doth
anſwere, that they vnderſtand them in the viſion or ſight of
God, as in a glaſſe. The beleefe of the Eaſt Church is contrary,
which ſaith, that the Saints doe not vnderſtand anie
thing at all: and indeede, as it hath beene ſaid in the precedent
queſtion, they beleeue not that the Saints doe enioy perfect
felicity in the viſion of God. But rather they hold with
the Reformed Churches, which doe abhorre this Inuocation
of Saints, eſpecially becauſe the Church of Rome doth attribute
vnto them, that which appertaineth to God, and which
God neuer communicated to any creature whatſoeuer, to wit,
to haue an habituall knowledge of the thoughts of men: for

if any Prophet hath had by reuelation any knowledge, the
ſame was by an extraordinarie diſpenſation. S.De cura pre mort. 
                     Auguſtine
ſaith, that if the Saints haue any care of the liuing, it is
euen as the liuing haue care of them, to wit, the one not hauing
any particular knowledge of the eſtate of the other.
                  Secondly, The other queſtion is, to know whether it be lawfull
for a man to recommend himſelfe to the praiers of the
Saints. Here they commit three Logomachies: The firſt
is in the word to Inuocate or Inuocation, which ſound ſo il
in the eares of the Proteſtants, that they therfore doe abhorre
all other Chriſtians. Ieremie Biſhoppe of Conſtantinople,
auoucheth, that this word is improper: It reſts onely then to
finde out a word more pleaſing and fit.
                  Well then thus it muſt be, to recommend a mans ſelfe to
the praiers of Saints, is to attribute vnto them ſome diuine
matter; but on the contrarie ſide it confeſſeth them to bee
creatures, ſubiect to the Creator, nay it is to debaſe them,
when a man doth deſire them to pray for him, which is as
much as to endeuour to ſtirre vp their piety and charity.
                  The ſecond Logomachia is in the word Interceſſor,
which they vſe for want of another, to ſignifie him that praieth
for another. Bellarmine himſelfe confeſſeth, that Ieſus
Chriſt is the onely Interceſſor, and therefore if the Saints
are heard, it is by reaſon of Ieſus Chriſt the Interceſſor, as
well for the liuing as for the dead. In like maner, the Saints
dead and liuing are in the ſame ranke, and the Saints departed
are Interceſſors vnto Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe for the
liuing.
                  The third variance in words is, in that the Grecians and
the Latins doe pray thus, Saint Peter helpe vs, our Lady haue
pittie vpon vs vs. Bellarmine ſaith that this is, as if one

ſhould ſay, Saint Peter helpe vs through thy prayers: but the
Protestants would that men ſhould ſpeake plainely, and they
are as farre from receiuing theſe tearmes, as the Latines are
little diſpoſed to correct their Howers, or the Grecians
their Horologe, (for ſo they call their bookes of prayers). It
appeareth not that the Aethiopians vſe this manner of
ſpeech: yea Hondius in his Coſmographicall Cart or Map,
ſaith that they do in no wiſe call vpon the Saints. Aluares
neither ſaith not that they doe, which he would hardly haue
forgotten, if it had bene ſo: ſo that if they haue no other inuocation,
but that which is found in their Liturgie, a man
may thinke that theſe are rather Apoſtrophes and Proſopopaeaes,
to ſtirre them vp to deuotion, then true inuocatitions:
as alſo the Proteſtants doe ſing with the Pſalmiſt,
                  
                     Prayſe God yee Angels of great power, yee Angels
of God, which doe all that he commaundeth, as ſoone
as you heare his voice. As for other matters, two things
are obiected againſt this inuocation or exhortation of Saints
practiſed by the Grecians, Armenians, &amp; other of the Eaſt: the
one, that it is an idle &amp; vnprofitable interpellation, ſeeing
that the Saints vnderſtand not at al thoſe that pray vnto thē.
Whereunto they aunſwere, that the ſpirit of Charitie, which
they haue, vnderſtandeth the Prayers, and knoweth the
thoughts of men, and that this ſpirit was promiſed them vntill
the end of the world: It ſeemes that by this word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
which they vſe, they meane the holy Ghoſt, dwelling in the
faithfull: for the Patriarch Gennade taketh it in this ſenſe,
in that place of Scripture which wee haue alleadged in the
Preface of this Treatiſe, where it is ſaid, that all the Apoſtles
had one ſelfe ſame teacher, to wit, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . So that the opinion
of the Grecians ſhould be this, that it is good to recommend

our ſoules to the prayers of Saints, becauſe that the holy Ghoſt
which dwelleth in them, and which vnderſtandeth the prayers
of them that are liuing, doth moue the Saints to pray for
them. The other obiection is, that there is no commaundement
of God to recommend a mans ſelfe to the Prayers of the
dead. They anſwere, that God commanded the friends of Iob,
to goe vnto Iob to pray him, to pray to God for them, and
that there is no impediment, why a man may not doe the like
to the Saints that are dead. The greateſt argument herein,
is the cuſtome receiued from antiquitie in the Catholike
Church. The intention or meaning thereof now a dayes is,
                  That the Saints doe not vnderſtand the Prayers of
the liuing, neuertheleſſe it is lawfull for vs to recommend
our ſelues to their Prayers, becauſe that the holy
Ghoſt, the ſpirit of Charitie, which dwelleth in them,
doth induce them to pray for the liuing, either in generall,
or in particular for thoſe that recommend themſelues
to their prayers.

                  They are worthy of the hate of al good men, though
there were no other reaſon but this, that they haue depraued
by their fables, the Hiſtories of the liues and
deaths of the Saints, which doubtleſſe were very full of
true doctrine and conſolation.

                     De rel. &amp; Ʋen. The Pope alone
hath power, not onely to extoll ſome amongſt the
Saints, but alſo to Canoniſe them: firſt becauſe it is one
of the greateſt matters that can bee propounded amongſt
Chriſtians: Secondly, becauſe miracles are attributed
vnto faith: Thirdly, becauſe that if it appertainneth
vnto the Pope, to determine thoſe things that are
doubtfull in the Scripture, then by farre greater reaſon
ought he to iudge of holineſſe: Fourthly, to the end that
the people ſhould not be deceiued through the ſimplicity
of many Biſhoppes: and fiftly, to the end there
ſhould not be an infinite number of Saints, leaſt that
thereby deuotion ſhould grow cold.
               
               
                  ANNOTATION.
                  IT is a thing confeſſed, that particular Churches may erre,
namely in the Canonizing ofBellar. de Sanct. beat. lib. 1. cap. 18. Saints: and by tradition
of the Catholike Church: the Church of Rome ought to bee
held for a particular Church. This aboue written doth ſhew
that the moſt part of Chriſtians doe not hold for Saints thoſe
which the Pope hath canonized. If any man ſay that the
Church cannot erre: I will anſwere, that from thence it followeth,
that it cannot be, that ſhe can vndertake to Canonize
them, whom ſhe neuer did while they were in their bodies.
The Church cannot make a new article of Faith. Pope Leo
the third (ſaith Bellarmine) was the firſt which Canonized
Saints; before they were honoured by cuſtome, and not
by law: the ſame is retained as yet in the Eaſt Countries,

where they name none Saints, but thoſe auncients which liued
about a thouſand years agoe; there are none in thoſe Churches
which thinke themſelues able to know, who thoſe be whom
God hath choſen. Not becauſe that none ought to hold for
ſaints, thoſe whoſe holineſſe the ancient Church did acknowledge:
it would be worſe to doubt it, then dangerous to beleeue
it charitably. That which induceth the Proteſtants to ſay
that Catherine, George, and Chriſtopher neuer liued, is
the falſhood of their Legends: Bellarmine confeſſeth, that
they are Apocrypha. They of the Eaſt doe beleeue, that
there was a certaine man named Chriſtopher, but no Giant.
They hold likewiſe that there haue beene a S. Catherine,
and a S. George, both very renowned in all the eaſt:
But if credible hiſtories doe contradict the Storie of their
liues, it may well be ſaid, that they were not, to wit, ſuch as
they are imagined to haue beene. To end, ſeeing that the
Churches haue euery one the memorie of the Saints, who haue
liued in their Countries: the ſureſt way is, not to condemne
them without good and ſufficient proofe: Neuertheleſſe it is
not an Article of Faith, that they ſhould be al Saints, no nor
thoſe neither of the Church of Rome: for all the Churches do
beleeue,
                  That thoſe which the Pope Canonizeth, are not vndoubtedly
Saints.

                      None ought to reprehend
vs if we incline or bow our ſelues before the Images
of Saints: for we do bow as well before the one as
before the other, becauſe that they are made after the Image
of God: and Saint Baſile ſaith, that the honour of
the Image doth aſcend vnto the firſt patterne. And the
Iſraelites did kneele round about the Tabernacle,
which bore the Image of Celeſticall things, and of
all the Creation.

                  ANNOTATION.
                  THere are diuers and ſundry opinions touching Images.
Firſt the Mahometiſts will haue none at all. Secondly,
the Iconomaques do thinke it vnlawfull to haue any in their
Churches. Epiphanius held this opinion, ſaying, that it is
againſt the authoritie of holy Scripture, that the Image of a
man ſhould hang in a Church, but hee citeth not the place of
Scripture: Alſo the Grecians and Latines doe not beleeue
that ſo learned a man did write the Epiſtle, where the ſame is
found. Thirdly many Proteſtants now a dayes doe ſay, that
it is not expedient to place Images in Churches, confeſsing
thereby that the ſame is a thing of it ſelfe indifferent.
Fourthly Chemnitius ſaith that Images are profitable in
regard of the hiſtorie, and decent for the Ornament of
Churches: and that the abuſe maybe auoided by the preaching
of true Doctrine. Fiftlie, the ſecond Councell of Nice after
Saint Baſill and others (followed by the Churches of the Eaſt

and Africa) doth teach that it is lawfull to bow downe before
Images: and becauſe that the law of God is by ſome oppoſed
thereunto, Thou ſhalt not bow down to them, the Councell
aunſwereth by diſtinguiſhing, that there are two faſhions
of inclining or bowing. The one Latria, which is to haue
truſt and confidence in that thing, before which a man boweth,
or to proſtrate himſelfe altogether before it. The other
is the inclination called Dulia, which a man vſeth when hee
meeteth with one of his friends: (for in the Eaſt Countreys,
the cuſtome is to bow their heads in ſaluting one another, as
they doe put off their hats in Fraunce) in this faſhion ſaith
the Councell, it is lawfull to bowe or incline before Images:
And which is more, the ſame Councell ſaith, that this inclination
or bowing, doth altogether tend to the thing repreſented:
the meaning of the Councell was explaned in this
verſe, Hanc videas, ſed mente colas, quod cernis in ipſa.
Behold the Image, but honour in thy heart, that which it doth
repreſent.
                  Moreouer, to the end that none ſhould thinke that this
is ſome particular Ceremonie belonging to Images onely, the
Councell and the Grecians doe hold to this day, that paſsing
before any Church or Croſſe, or in taking vp the holy Bible, a
man ought to encline or bow his head, which is as much as
for a man in France to put off his hat: and that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
ſaith the Councell, that is to ſay, hauing the heart eleuated vp
to God. The Abyſſins doe not paſſe beyond theſe limits. They
haue pictures in their Churches, but the people very ſeldome
enter into the place where they are: they are not vpon the
Altars, towards the which they turne themſelues in praying.
Alſo if they doe incline or bowe their heads, it is in paſsing
before Churches, Croſſes, or the ſtones of the Altar. The Eccleſiaſticall

perſons enter not into the Church with their hoſe
and ſhooes on, according to that which God ſpake to Moyſes,
Put off thy ſhooes, for the place where thou ſtandeſt is
holy ground. He that commeth by a Church, if he be a horſebacke,
will alight, vntill he be paſt it. Behold here the Ceremonies
of the Africanes. They of the Eaſt doe paſſe theſe
limits; eſpecially the leſſer, for they ſtand ſtill, while they
pray and bow their head before the images, but they kneele
not downe. Ieremie ſaith, that it is not in fauour of the Images:
for all the honour is carried to the patterne; as if
he ſhould haue ſaid, that they are honoured onely by accident,
as when a man ſaluteth any one, he putteth off his hat, before
his habite, without hauing any meaning or intention, to doe
it in honour of his habite. So that wheras they pray before the
pourtraict or Image, it is, (ſay they) to ſtirre vp themſelues
to deuotion, and to ſhew how much they honour the thing repreſented.
All theſe exceptions take no place amongſt the
Proteſtants. We ought not (ſay they)Obſ. in harm. Conf. Sect. 2. 
                     attribute to the
Images of Saints any kind of worſhip, either Ciuill or
Religious, for the ſame cannot be done without deteſtable
ſuperſtition. It ſeemes that this is the greateſt accuſation,
which the Proteſtants haue againſt the Churches of the
Eaſt and Africa. Neuertheleſſe this cuſtome is not now a
dayes, the auncient doctors which deſtroied the Pagane idolatrie
haue approued it: their deuotion did lead them to it.
Peraduenture no man will thinke it ſtrange, if he conſider
the perſons, time, and place. Thoſe Fathers might defend
themſelues, as hauing the Spirit reſting vpon them inſignes,
which is not granted to the meaner ſort of people. The Chriſtians
of the Eaſt haue beene alwayes giuen to ceremonies. It
was the cuſtome to bowe the head before the Images of
Kings and Princes.
                  
                     
                     Artabanus king of Perſia (ſaith Suetonius) worſhipped
the Eagles and the Images of the Emperous. The
Grecians at this time doe argue thus: If it be lawfull to vncouer
the head, in paſsing by the Image of a King, why not in
like manner by the Image of Ieſus Chriſt?
                  They of theſe Countries doe anſwere, that it is not the cuſtome
amongſt them, to vncouer their heads before the Images
of2. Reſp. ad Gre. Kings: whoſoeuer ſhould doe it, would be held ridiculous.
In like manner, if a man ſhould doe ſo before the
Image of a Saint, the Proteſtants would call it ſuperſtition.
The Romane Catholikes doe paſſe very often by Churches,
and Images, without once mouing their hats, or bowing their
bodies: Neither doe they ſo, when they take in hand their
Howers, or the holy Bible. The cuſtome in theſe parts is, to
put off the hat, when in publik acts the King is named: Moreouer
the Proteſtants in England doe ordaine, that men put
off their hats at Sermons, when they heare the name ofCan. 18. Ieſus.
In like manner all countries haue their cuſtomes: that
which is ridiculous and ſuperſtitious in one place, is held and
eſteemed comely and religious in another. The moſt expedient
way would be, in ſtead of calling one another Idolaters
and Heretickes, to exhort one another charitably, to doe all to
edification; to auoid the appeareance of euill, and exceſſe, and
not to ſcandalize the Infidels and vnbeleeuers. If any Infidell
doe enter into the Church (ſaith S. Paul) will not
he ſay, that you are out of your wits?
                  
                  In like manner, when an Infidell or vnbeleeuer doth ſee a
Chriſtian praying, with his eies fixed vpon an Image: will
not he ſay, that he ſpeaketh to the Image? Intreaties, obteſtations,
and mutuall demonſtrations doe ſerue ſometimes to
procure the peace of the Church, but iniurious ſpeeches will

neuer take away ſchiſmes, and the paſſages or places of Scripture
which are alledged, to make that ſeeme vnlawfull, which
is but vndecent: do not cauſe eyther the ſuperſtitious to leaue
their ſuperſtition, or the leſſe deuout their irreligion. The
ſtrife founded vpon the Equiuocation of the Greeke word

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      edifies as little. A great part of the Church will
neuer conſent to a manifeſt alteration. Thoſe that gouerne
the Church, doe ſweare at their entrance, to follow the tract
of their Predeceſſors: but it happeneth very often that euill
cuſtomes doe ware away by laps of time, although not ſo faſt
as thoſe which are good.
                  
                     The Church of Rome neuer ſtaieth vpon theſe termes, as
Wicelius a Romane Catholike writeth, yea one that was
verie much
                     Epiſt. in exerc. verae pietat. 
                     affectionate. If I would (ſaith he) I could
produce the teſtimony of the Primitiue Church, by the
which the vſe of the interceſſion of Saints is coroborated.
But as I doe affirme this, ſo I alſo confeſſe, that it
doth greeue me, that vnder pretext of I know not what
Dulia, it is affirmed, that one may and ought to honour
with adoration the Saints and their Images? The Diuines
of the auncient Church haue preached to the
people, that they muſt honour, but not worſhippe or
adore the Saints: Well then, if they haue truely ſpoken
thus of the Saints, what thinke you, would they haue
ſaid of the Statues and Images of Saints worſhipped
in Appearance, and honored with the manner of Diuine
worſhippe? Thoſe who in Churches adore Images
through any appearance, ſeeme not much vnlike thoſe,
which in times paſt worſhipped Gods and Goddeſſes.
Where is the ſobrietie of our vnderſtanding, to bow
or ſtoope before carued or molten Images, contrary

to the law of God? vnleſſe peraduenture wee
would offend the Iewes, the Saraſins, and thoſe which
are parted from vs, through ſuch like enormities? The
ſtrange nations, of whom we haue ſpoken (to wit the
Chriſtians of the Eaſt and South) haue very holily kept
and obſerued the law of God touching adoration, and
haue honoured the ſoules of the Saints, in rendering to
God that which appertaineth to God, and to the Saints
that which appertaineth to the Saints: for who can
find colours alwaies to excuſe himſelfe if he daily being
too much giuen to vice, doe fooliſhly ſearch out extremities,
by miſtaking the meane?
                  From this diſcourſe of Wicelius a man may learne two
things: Firſt, that the Churches of the Eaſt, and of Affrica,
are not fallen into the errour of the Latines. Secondly, that
in the Church of Rome there are good people, which will not
be Idolaters, no not in outward appeareance, They are to be
well aduiſed, whether it be tollerable for them to ſtay in the
Church of Rome, and to call her Mother and Miſtreſſe, and
to hold them for heretickes which doe depart from her, and
yet withall to call her Mother and Miſtreſſe of Idolatrie.
For it is certaine, that ſhe approueth not onely the appeareance
of euill, which Wicelius condemneth, but alſo the euill
it ſelfe. And for the ſame cauſe Thomas of Aquin. hath
beene canoniſed by her, yea honoured by a ſolemne feaſt, as a
Saint and a true Teacher: and it is he that maintaineth,
that a man ought to adore and worſhippe Images with the
ſame adoration or worſhippe as the thing repreſented; to
wit, the Image of Ieſus Chriſt with Latria, and thoſe of the
Saints with Dulia, in ſuch ſort, that the Images are alſo the
obiect of adoration: againſt which doctrine, the learned Earle

                     In Apol. de im. 
                     Picus hath written, who neuertheleſſe denieth not, that a
man ought to adore Images: but not, ſaith he, with that
adoration which Thomas maintaineth.
                  Some man may aske, if Thomas went beyond the meane,
in the adoration of Images, how ſhall we call that errour and
vice? The Image adored with Latria, ſhal it not be an Idole?
and he that adoreth it in like maner, ſhal he not be called an
Idolater? But this opinion is not yet forgone in the Church
of Rome. Cardinall Bellarmine their great Doctor maintaineth
it. We muſt not (ſaith hee) adore the Images
onely by accident or improperly (as the Grecians ſay) but alſo
properly, and in themſelues.
                  
                  The foreſaid Chriſtian people are alſo contrarie to the
Church of Rome, in that they will not haue the Diuine eſſence
painted, eſpecially in the Churches: and follow the opinion
of their Doctor Damaſcen, although that there are
ſome Grecians in places neare to Italy, which take libertie
herein, as may be ſeene in their Horologies, printed at Venice.
Moreouer they abhorre Images of Gould, Siluer, wood
and ſtone, as ſmelling of Paganiſh idolatry, and haue none but
pictures. The concluſion of this queſtion, according to the
opinion of the foreſaid people, is,
                  That it is lawfull, but not neceſſary, neither (peraduenture)
profitable to bow, or vncouer the head before
Churches, Altars, Croſſes, Pourtraitures, or Images of
Saints, or in handling holy Reliques, or the bookes of
the holy Scripture. That it is ſome appearance of Idolatrie
to paſſe theſe limits. That it is plaine Idolatry
to adore Images properly. That it is an imitation of
the Pagans to haue Images of releefe in Churches. That
it is follie, and impiety to make an image of God.

with the deede. Ieſus Christ approueth this will and thisMat. 19. 11 eſtate.
That is the cauſe that the Grecians did extoll it, following
S. Baſil, but with hyperbolicall termes, as may bee ſeene
in their anſwere to the Diuines of Wittemberg: They beleeue
that if it be a Diuine and ſupernaturall guift, then it
ought not to bee eſteemed vnprofitable, neither as a humane
inuention. The hate which a man beareth to the abuſe of a
thing, ought not to preiudice the true vſe of it. They call
that life Angelicall: Acertaine Grecian expounding that
word, hath told vs, that they beleeue that the life of the Caloiers
is Angelicall, as long as they doe good, but diabolicall
as long as they doe euill. Secondly, is to be noted the Cuſtome
of thoſe that will follow this inſtitution, to aſſociate themſelues
in Colledges. The Proteſtants condemne not that. The
Monaſteries (ſay they) were in times paſt houſes, where ſome
did labour and worke with their hands, others did exerciſe
themſelues to ſerue in the Church. The third thing to bee
noted is the Vow. The Proteſtants likewiſe do not abſolutely
condemne it, but in that (ſaithInſtit. lib. 4. cap. 13. 
                     Caluin) it is made by
thoſe that haue not the power to accompliſh that which they
haue vowed; the ſame Author doth thinke that a Vow may
be taken at threeſcore yeeres of age: For S. Paul ſaith, Let
not a widdow be taken into the number vnder that age.
That Canon of Saint Paul hath not beene obſerued by his ſucceſſors,
for afterward were they receiued at fiftie yeeres of
Nouel. 6. age, and afterNouel. 123. that at fortie. Neuertheleſſe, the ſame is
continued, and is as yet held in the Eaſt Churches, becauſe it

is neceſſarie that he that Voweth, ſhould haue knowledge by
long experience, that he hath receiued of God power to accompliſh
and performe that which hee hath vowed, contrarie to
which the doctrine of the Councell of Trent is, which ſaith,
that a Vowe may be made at ſixteene yeeres of age. The foreſaid
Churches would not allow of diuers Sects of Munkes and
Friers: and therein are differing from the Latine Church, or
rather contrarie to it. As touching the begging of Munkes,
the proofes before alleadged doe ſhew that theſe Churches approoue
it not. Amongst the Latines themſelues, there were
many which haue condemned it, as Pope Nicholas the third
De uerb. ſig▪ c. 2. ſaith. In the Churches of Africa, the ſolemne vowes of chaſtitie,
Pouertie &amp; Obedience, are not vſed, as in the Church
of Rome. Therfore the beliefe of the foreſaid Churches is,
                  That ſuch may vow Chaſtitie, as know by ſufficient
experience, that they haue power to accompliſh &amp; performe
their vowes. And that Munkes, ought not to
beare the name of diuers Sects, nor conſume by their
begging that which appertaineth vnto thoſe which
cannot labour.

why they ſinge not the Maſſe during that time, but
only in the night: and after ſeruice they communicate,
and then goe to ſupper. And euen as they haue theſe
fiftie daies of Lent: In like manner they take other fifty
dayes after Eaſter, and the Pentecoſt, wherein they faſt
not, and then when it is not faſting day, they celebrate

                  ANNOTATION.
                  THis Queſtion might haue beene omitted: Neuertheleſſe
becauſe that there are too many ſcrupulous
people, which take more heede to the externall ſeruice of God,
then to the truth of beliefe, it ſhall not bee much beſides the
purpoſe, to giue here aduertiſement touching Feaſtes and
faſting. It is therefore to be vnderſtood, that the Apoſtles
neuer made in common any order touching Feasts and Faſting:
If they had, it would haue beene knowne, for the Tradition
would haue beene alike amongſt all Nations, which is
not, nor neuer was. Incontinently after the time of the Apoſtles,
the Churches of Aſia, where Saint Iohn gouerned, yea,
where S. Peter and S. Paul taught, were found to differ from
the Church of Rome, touching the Feaſt of Eaſter. There is
no doubt, but that the Feaſts of the Apoſtles were ordained
a long time after their deceaſe. As touching faſting, there
are two ſorts: The one (which is truely and properly faſting)
is abſtinence from all kind of meate: this faſting is obſerued
and very much vſed in Aethiop, and amongſt all the Iacobites.
The other kind of Faſting, is an abſtinence from the

moſt delicate and delicious meates. Againſt which Faſting,
the Proteſtants doe bring this ſentence out of S. Paul.
                     1. Tim. 4. 1. 
                     The
ſpirit ſpeaketh euidently, that in the latter dayes, men
ſhall giue heede vnto the ſpirits of errour, and doctrine
of Diuels, which teach lies through hypocriſie, commanding
to abſtaine from meates, which GOD hath
created, to bee receiued with giuing of thankes. Some
will demaund whether the Proteſtants doe pretend, that this
place of Scripture is abſolutely againſt Lent and obſeruation
of Fridayes: Zanchius anſwereth no. Lent was inſtituted before
the yeere 139. and the Author is not knowne: For the
conſtitution of Teleſphorus ſerued but to confirme that,
which was then already receiued: So that if ſome of the Apoſtles
were not the inuenters thereof, yet it is certaine that it
was ſome of their Diſciples, all the reſt conſenting thereunto.
The ſaying alſo of S. Paul cannot be applied to that inſtitution;
for S. Paul ſaith, that this forbidding ſhould bee in the
latter dayes. The ſame Zanchius ſaith, that Lent was free
vntill the time of Pope Gregorie the ſeuenth, that is to ſay,
vntill the yeare 1075. And that this Pope did forbid (in
the Latine Church) to eate fleſh, vpon paine of mortall ſinne:
And that this prohibition ſo abſolute and exact, is that
whereof S. Paul ſpeaketh: For otherwiſe it is not a true prohibition
or forbidding. The Romane Catholikes do bring
other exceptions, to wit, that theſe meates are not forbidden
as euill of themſelues: Another anſwereth them, that Saint
Paul ſaith, the vſe of them muſt not be forbidden, and ſpeaketh
in the ſame ſort of Marriage, which is not forbidden,
but onely to thoſe which haue vowed neuer to marrie. Alſo
vnleſſe one doe vow not to eate fleſh, the vſe ought not to be
abſolutely forbidden him. The Latines ſay alſo, that they

forbid it not, but for certaine times. The contrary part doth
reply, that it is euer a forbidding. That which is white
for one day (ſaithEth. 1. 
                     Ariſtotle) is no leſſe white, then if it
had beene ſo a whole yeare. As for the Chriſtians of the
Eaſt, they are more exact obſeruers of Faſting and abſtinence
then the Latines are, although that their Church hath not
this doctrine, that it ſhould be vnto them a mortall ſinne:
Zeale and deuotion is many times imitated by ſuperſtition.
The Reformed Churches haue their Faſts, and do keepe them
ſtraightly, and the common people amongſt them might fall
into ſome ſcruple of conſcience, but that they are oftentimes
aduertiſed of their Chriſtian libertie.
                  It hath beene ſaid before, that the Ethiopians doe beleeue,
that the commandements of the Church doe not binde a man
vpon paine of mortall ſinne. And in that point they are
manifeſtly on the Proteſtants ſide, as the Grecians alſo are,
if they hold that which their aunceſtors held: all alike doe
beleeue, that the Biſhoppes may both make lawes, vſe their
cenſures, and impoſe certaine puniſhments vpon the infringers
or breakers of them: but not forbidde as God, If thou
doſt eate of this fruit, thou ſhalt die the death, both temporall
and eternall. So that ſome ſcruple is noted among
Chriſtians, but the doctrine which they confeſſe, is,
                  That the Church may ordaine holy or feſtiual daies,
together with abſtinence of all or ſome kind of meats:
neuertheleſſe not ſo as to bind the conſcience, without
contempt or ſcandall: and the diuers practiſe therof
doth ſhew, that there is no Catholike eccleſiaſticall
law, which hath ordained either feſtiuall daies, or faſting
daies, or the manner of keeping thoſe feaſts or faſts.
               
            
         
         
            
            ¶The Concluſion of this Treatiſe.
            
               THe Councell of Baſil hath declared the Pope
to bee ſubiect vnto the Church. If the ſame
were beleeued at this day by the Latines, as it
is by all other Chriſtians, it were ſufficient to
make a peace. If the Pope may tranſport that
Sea out of Rome, the Church may doe it farre better; yea the
Eaſt Church might haue done it at ſuch time, as it was greater
then the Latine. It followeth alſo, that all that the Popes haue
ordained, approued, or tollerated, is vnder correction. If there
had not beene ambition in him, or in his Clergie of Rome, hee
would haue heard the Catholike voyce of the Church: This
ambition is the cauſe, wherefore the Grecians doe call him an
Arch-hereticke, the Indians a reprobate Biſhoppe, the Proteſtants
the ſonne of perdition. Thoſe that liue vnder him vſe
not theſe termes: Neuertheleſſe they are not farre wide from
this beleefe. If the Duke of Venice ſhould preſume to call himſelfe
Monarch, and that the moſt part tooke armes againſt him,
calling him Tyrant, Capitall and Principall enemy of the Common-wealth;
and that there were others more patient then
they, which confeſſed that in truth he was not ſuch a one, as he
counted himſelfe to be: neuertheleſſe beleeued that he ought
to be ſupported: I pray you would not all theſe Cittizens agree
together in the principall point, although they were of diuers
opinions in the manner of proceeding?
            FatherDe Sacr. 
               Coton after many others, maketh an argument here,
which he thinketh to be inuincible: The Sonne of Perdition
(ſaith he) muſt ſit in the Temple of God according to Saint
Paul, that is to ſay, in the Church of God, according toVpon the 2. Epiſtle to the Theſſ. cap 2. 4. 
               Cryſoſtome:
And we muſt not goe out of the Church, for out of
it there is no ſaluation; therefore we muſt continue vnder the
ſonne of perdition.
            
               Anſwere. The Temple of God is all the earth: in this Temple
there are many Epiſcopall Chaires, which (as Pope Pelagius
ſaith) are one nuptiall bed of Chriſt, that is to ſay, which make

but one Church, which begetteth children to God by baptiſme.
Well then, if hee that ſitteth in S. Peters Chaire teacheth
not at all, who will gaine-ſay, but that without forſaking the
Church, one may goe to heare him which ſittes in Saint Peters
chaire at Antioch, among theStan. Or

                  . Armenians, or in the ſeate of S.
Andrew in Conſtantinople? Some will ſay that the Proteſtants
doe not take this way: But we haue ſhewed that if ceremonies
were laid apart, and that Logomachies were eſchued, there
would want but little of agreement: and ſcarce would there be
any diſcord, but onely in theſe foure points: Firſt, about Images:
Secondly, praiers to Saints: Thirdly, the time of making
Monaſticall vows: Fourthly, about the conuerſion of Bread and
Wine in the Euchariſt, and peraduenture not ſo great as is
imagined.
            For the firſt, it is decreed in the ſecond Councel of Nice, that
one ſhould put off his Hat in paſſing before a Church, a Croſſe,
an Altar, an Image or portraict of a Saint, hauing the heart lifted
vp to God. The Proteſtants doe call the ſame ſuperſtition.
See, here is a great hereſie, a trimme ſubiect to diuide Chriſtianitie!
Panigarolas confeſſeth that one may altogether let paſſe
Images, why not then this ceremonie? The Catholicke Romans
know well enough, that ſometimes they were not vſed at all.
And Wicelius ſaith that wee ought to eſchew all appearance of
euill. In the time of S. Baſil there was tolleration herein. Vigilantius
brake the peace, peraduenture his iniurious ſpeeches
haue beene the cauſe, why men did more in hate of him.
            The ſecond Queſtion, whether one ought to recommend
himſelfe to the Prayers of the Saints, is of the ſame nature.
They of the Eaſt Churches doe confeſſe, that the Saints doe not
vnderſtand our Prayers: Neuertheleſſe, that the holy Ghoſt
which they haue, doeth induce them to pray and to crie Abba
father, (ſaith S. Paul) that is to ſay, in generall, for thoſe that
recommend themſelues to their Prayers. The Proteſtants doe
confeſſe that the Saints doe pray, and that one may wiſh or deſire,
that they would ſo doe; notwithſtanding, they hold it abſurd
to addreſſe our Prayers vnto them, ſeeing that wee doe

know that they vnderſtand vs not. Melancton thinketh that one
might peraduenture vſe the ancient maner, that is, to direct
our Prayers to God, in making mention of the Prayers which
the Saints doe make: So that all doe tend to the ſame end, but
doe differ in termes.
            The third difference is of leſſer importance. It is certaine
that in the time of the Apoſtles, the widowes were receiued,
without any regard to their age: If there had beene no abuſe, S.
Paul would not haue made mention of Reformation. If the Caloiers
of the Eaſt, and the Antonians or Eſtafarus of Aethiop, are
not good people, it is for the Biſhops of thoſe Prouinces to
prouide and ſee to it, as alſo they ought not to thinke much,
that other Nations haue found out a lawfull remedie.
            The fourth and laſt point, is the Queſtion ſo much diſputed
vpon now a dayes, touching the changing of the Euchariſt.
Here without doubt is a difference in mens beliefe. But the
Reformed Churches haue not debated againſt the Catholike
Church, and are not ſeperated from them of the Eaſt and the
Africans, for they were not in their vnion. Moreouer, thoſe
that denie it, ſhewe themſelues ready to communicate with
them that beleeue Conſubſtantiation, which not withſtanding
by their ſaying, is almoſt as contrarie to the Articles of Faith,
as the Romane Tranſubſtantiation. Leſſe occaſion haue they
to hold themſelues ſeperated from the other Apoſtolicke Churches,
which (as hath beene ſaid) beleeue not Ieſus Chriſt to be
any where elſe then in heauen, touching his humanitie: And
their beliefe, containeth not any thing that doeth contradict
the Scriptures, although they be not able to conclude the ſame
neceſſarily out of the Scriptures.
            The beliefe of theſe Churches is, that by Prayers the Bread
is changed into the body of the Lord, as Chriſtians are, and
that in both there is a change not onely in name but really. Becauſe
that ſome ſupernaturall thing proceeding from the matter
of the body of the Lord, which is onely in heauen, is infuſed
into the matter of bread, and from thence paſſeth into the ſoule
of the Communicant, and hath the place of forme both in the

one and in the other, and cauſeth that both the one and the other
be called, after a ſpeciall faſhion, the body of Chriſt: Becauſe
that they ſuffer a change through the obtaining of a new
forme, or elſe their forme ſuffereth a change through the obtaining
of new faculties. And that is the reaſon, why aſwell the
ſaid Churches as the Reformed, doe confeſſe that (as S. Paul
writeth) The bread is the Communion of the body of the Lord;
The difficultie therefore lieth in this point, to wit, whether the
Bread hath poſitiuely in it ſelfe this forme or faculties: to communicate
them vnto the Soule by it ſelfe: Or whether the ſoule
receiueth them of the Bread, becauſe that the holy Ghoſt which
is preſent in the Bread, as in all things, cauſeth that when one
receiueth this bread, he receiueth the body of Chriſt, by meanes
of this eſſence, or faculties which proceede immediatly from
the ſame body. If there were as much Charitie in men as zeale,
they might find this aboue mentioned tollerable, vntill an vniuerſall
and lawfull Councell.
            In the meane time, it is the part of the louers of truth, and enemies
of hereſies, to ſearch and ſeek out the truth, ſufficiently
contained in the holy Scriptures, wherein if they find any obſcuritie
(which they ſhall not in thoſe things neceſſarie to ſaluation)
it is their part to haue recourſe vnto the voice of the
Churches, to the which our Lord hath promiſed his aſſiſtance.
And if they be not of one accord, then to ſuſpend their iudgement:
or elſe with a holy libertie to trie all, and to retaine that
which they take to be good in euery one of them. If you proceede
thus (Chriſtian Reader) you will no more ſay, I am of
Paul, and I am of Cephas, but rather you ſhall bee true Catholickes
and Orthodox Chriſtians, and in no maner Idolaters or
Heretickes, Grecians nor Romanes, Papiſts nor Huguenots,
Lutheranes nor Caluiniſts, Proteſtants nor Puritanes: and
make them lyers, that ſeeke to ſtaine your beautifull and holy
profeſſion, with names ſo infamous and vnworthy of honourable
people and true Chriſtians.

THE READER.
            
               THoſe that do build Religion on Ceremonies, will thinke
that this Booke is lame or maimed, becauſe that it doth
not declare thoſe, which are obſerued by euery Nation.
But we thought it a labour as much vnprofitable, as enuious

hath written a volume against the Grecians, wherein hee ſpeaketh
almoſt of nothing elſe. That we may not omit any thing of importance,
we doe aduertiſe, that there are two euill Ceremonies found
among the Grecians. The firſt is, that they vſe Leauened bread in
their Sacrament: The other that they abſtaine from things ſtrangled
and from blood: In both they thinke themſelues grounded vpon the
holy Scripture, The Grecians hauing oppoſed themſelues againſt
the Latines,
               In anſwer to the confeſſion of Ausburg. doe reprehend them becauſe they vſe litle Wafers vnleauened,
and not ordinarie Bread, as our Sauiour did. They doe
not thinke that this word Bread, agrees to thoſe Hoſts or Wafers,
and that moſt commonly that name is not giuen them. Moreouer to
make their faſhion ſeeme better, they haue thought good to ſay, that
Ieſus Chriſt did not inſtitute this Sacrament in the dayes of ſweete
bread. As for vnleauened Bread, the Romane Catholickes doe not
inſiſt much vpon it. And it is not ſo important a matter of faith,
to know vpon what day the Sacrament was ordained, prouided that
one pretend not to preiudice thereby the Hiſtorie of the Goſpel, the
paſſages or ſentences whereof may bee better reconciled through the
one,Acts 15. 15. then through the other. As for abſtinence from things ſtrangled
and from blood: It is founded vpon the decrees of the Apoſtles aſſembled
in Ieruſalem, the which Decree they doe not thinke to be abrogated,
becauſe that their Church which they hold to be true and Catholicke,
hath ſtill obſerued it: Yea, this maner of abſtinence hath
beene confirmed by the ſixt Synode. There is likelyhood that they
haue remitted this to a generall Councell, for they haue not much
preſſed this point againſt the Latines. The Aethiopians are both
in the one and in the other, on the Romanes and Proteſtants ſide. In

               France the Proteſtants doe vſe leauened Bread, after the faſhion of
the Grecians.
            Againſt the Churches of the Abyſſines in the South is obiected
that they are rebaptized euery yeare: But the Ambaſſadour of
Preſter-Iohn ſaith, that the cauſe why they bath themſelues in Riuers
and Ponds, is not becauſe that they thinke it neceſſary to ſaluation,
but they doe it vpon the day of the Epiphanie in remembrance
of the Baptiſme of our Sauiour. It is to be noted, that this ceremonie
is new amongst the Abyſſins: for their King Dauid which
raigned but about ſome hundred yeares agoe, ſaid that the ſame was
by the inſtitution of his Grandfather. The Romane Catholikes haue
no occaſion to impute this vnto the Abyſſins for an errour: ſeeing
that in the Church of Rome they baptize Bells, and contrary to the
practiſe of the Apoſtolicke Churches, they ſprincle water euery day
entring into their Churches, for remiſsion of veniall ſinnes, a cuſtome
taken eyther from the Iewes, as the Grecians doe reproach them, or
elſe from Pagan Idolaters.
            The other accuſation againſt the Iacobites is, becauſe that they
tollerate Circumciſion: vpon which Berthius ſaith thus: They circumciſe
their children, both Male and Female, but they borrow
not that from the Iewes: (inſomuch that the ſame is not for
any Religion ſake, as Aluares alſo ſaith) but it is an auncient cuſtome,
for Herodotus witneſſeth, that the Ethiopians in times paſt
likewiſed vſed it. It hath beene likewiſe thought by ſome, that the
Iacobites baptize with fire: But the Hiſtoriographers and thoſe of
the Countrey doe certifie vs, that the ſame is not ſo: but they make
inciſions in their temples, either for comlines, or els for their healths
ſake. If the Ethiopians haue no other errours, then thoſe which appeare
vnto vs, we might (peraduenture) appropriate vnto them by
better right that place of Scripture,Cant. ca. 1. 
               vbi cubas in meridie,
then the auncient Donatiſts could attribute it
vnto themſelues.
