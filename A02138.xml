            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

And if I consent not vnto these vnrighteous Iudges I am like to be vniustlie accused of the like crime, so that both I shall suffer death without cause, &amp; yet (which is most gréefe, not die without shame.

               ie imagining against Susanna to put hir to deth. They therfore commanded presently before al the people to sende for Susanna the daughter of Helchias Ioachims wife &amp; immediatly

they sent for hir who came accompanied with hir father and mother, hir children and all hir kinred. The Iudges séeing Susanna to be come, and that she had hir face couered with a vale, commaunded presentlie to vncouer hir face, that so they might satisfie their filthie lust with the sight of hir beautie, and féede their doting fansie with the glistering hewe of hir deuine feature. The people nowe more narrowlie noting hir erquisite perfection, and singuler beautie taking pittie of hir mishap sorrowed and wept. But the two Elders stood vp in the middest of the assemblie, and laieng their hande vppon Susannas heade, which powred foorth teares, and heaued vp hir eies towards heauen, for hir heart trusted in the Lord, begun their tale of this manner.
            We are sorie quoth they that wée haue cause this daie to accuse Susanna the daughter of Helchias, and wife of our fréende Ioachim, neither would we willingly be witnesse against hir, if our own conscience did not compell vs to beare a true testimonic, we are Iudges &amp; Elders

of the people, appointed by God and chosen by the multitude and constrained by the lawe to haue no respect of persons, but to doe iustice vnto all men, neither to be parcial to our fréendes, nor enuious to our foe, but with the ballance of equitie to measure euerie man according to his merrit, and with the sworde of iustice t

Thus quoth they haue you hearde this hainous crime wherevnto we are witnesses, sorrowing that such sinne shoulde be founde in

Israel, and especiallie in the childe of so honest a father, &amp; in the wife of so honest a husband. The Iudges hauing finished this their forged tale, the people gaue credite to their word

Susanna hearing the fatall doome pronounced against hir by these vniust Iudges, cried out vnto the Lorde with a loude voice and saide.
