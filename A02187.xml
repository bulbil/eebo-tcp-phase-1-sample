            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE AND MY VERY GOOD LORD, EDmund Lord Sheffeild, Lord Lieutenant in the North, and Lord Preſident of his Highnes Counſell there, of the noble order of the Garter: and to the right ho
               nourable and religious Ladies, the Lady Dowglaſſe his mother, and Lady Vrſula his wife, and to all the vertuous of-ſpring of that noble race, Grace and Peace, &amp;c.
            
               GIVE me leaue (right Honourable) to put you all in one Epiſtle, whom God and nature haue linked ſo well together: Nature in the neereſt bond, and God in the holieſt Religion. For a ſimple new-yeares gift, I preſent you with as ſtrange a ſtory, as (out of the holy ſtories) was euer heard. Will your Honours haue the whole in briefe, afore it be laid downe at large? Thus it is.
            
               Galeacius Caracciolus ſonne and heire apparent to Calantonius, Marqueſſe of Vicum in Naples, bred, borne, and brought vp in Popery, a Courtier to the Emperour Charles the fift, nephew to the Pope Paul the fourth, being married to the Duke of Nucernes daughter, and hauing by her ſix goodly children; at a Sermon of Peter Martyrs was firſt touched, after by reading Scripture and other good meanes, was fully conuerted: laboured with his Lady, but could not perſwade her. Therefore that he might enioy Chriſt, and ſerue him with a quiet conſcience, he left the lands, liuings, and honoures of a Marqueſdome, the comſorts of his Lady and children, the pleaſures of Italy, his credit with the Emperour, his kinred with the Pope, and forſaking all for the loue of Ieſus Chriſt, came to Geneua, and there liued a poore and meane, but yet an honourable and an holy life for fortie yeares. And though his father, his Lady, his kinſemen; yea the Emperour and the Pope did all they could to reclaime him, yet continued he conſtant to the end, and liued and died the bleſſed ſeruant of God, about fifteene yeares agoe, leauing behind him a rare example to all ages.
            This (right Houourable) is a briefe of the whole, and it is a ſtory admirable and imitable if any other in this later age of the world.
            Some vſe to craue of great perſonages, not to reſpect the gift but the giuer: but in this caſe I contrariwiſe intreat your honours, not to reſpect the giuer but the gift: of the giuer I ſay enough if I ſay nothing; but of the gift,

I meane of noble Galeacius, I ſay too little, when I haue ſaid all I can. But this I muſt needs ſay: So religions, ſo noble, ſo vertuous was the man, ſo reſolute, ſo holy, ſo heroicall was the fact, ſo ſtrange the beginning, ſo admirable and extraordinary the perſeuerance, as if the ſtory were not debaſed by the rudenes of my tranſlation; I durſt ſay, none ſo great but might reade it, nor ſo good but might follow it. I may ſay much ratherGeneſ. 47. then Iacob, Few and euill haue my da

                  s beene: Yet in theſe few daies of mine ſomething haue I ſeene; more haue I read, more haue I heard; yet neuer ſaw I, heard I, or read I any example (al things laid together) more neerely ſeconding the example of Moſes then this, of this moſt renowned Marqueſſe Galeacius. Moſes was the adopted ſonne of a Kings daughter: Galeacius the naturall ſonne, and heire apparent to a Marqueſſe: Moſesa Courtier in the Court of Pharaoh: Galeacius in the Court of the Emperour Charles the fift: Moſes by adoption a kinne to a Queene: Galeacius by marriage a kinne to a Duke: by blood, ſonne to a Marqueſſe, nephew to a Pope: Moſes in poſſibility of a Kingdome: he in poſſeſſion of a Marqueſdome: Moſes in his youth brought vp in the heatheniſme of Egypt: Galeacius noo
                  •
               eled in the ſuperſtition of Popery: Moſes at laſt ſaw the truth and embraced it, ſo did Galeacius: Moſes openly fell from the heatheniſme of Egypt▪
                ſo did Galeac us from the ſuperſtition of Popery. But all this is nothing to that which they both ſuffred for their conſcience. What Moſes ſuffred Saint Paul tels vs: Moſes when he was come to yeares refuſed to
               Heb. 11. 
               be called the ſonne of Pharaohs daughter: and choſe rather to ſuffer aduerſitie with the people of God, then to enioy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon; ſteeming the rebuke of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures of Egypt: Nay Moſes had rather be a baſe bricke-maker amongſt the oppreſſed Iſraelites, being true Chriſtians; then to be the ſonne of a Kings daughter in the Court of Pharaoh amongſt Idolaters. In like caſe noble Galeacius, when he was come to yeares and knowledge of Chriſt, refuſed to be called ſonne and heire to a Marqueſſe, Cup▪hearer to an Emperour, Nephew to a Pope; and choſe rather to ſuffer affliction, perſecution, baniſhment, loſſe of lands, liuings, wife, children; honours, and preferments, then to enioy the ſinfull pleaſures of Italy for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the rebuke of Chriſt greater riches then the honours of a Marqueſdome without Chriſt: and therefore ſeeing hee muſt either want Chriſt or want them, hee diſpoyled himſelfe of all theſe to gaine Chriſt.
            If (right Honourable) the wife fooles of this world might haue the cenſuring of theſe two men and their actions, they would preſently iudge them a couple of impaſſionate and ſtoicall fellowes, or elſe melancholike and brame-ſicke men, to refuſe Marqueſdomes and Kingdomes for ſcruple of co nſcience: but no matter as long as the men are Saints in heauen, and their actions honoured of God and his Angels; admired of good men, and neglected of none, but thoſe who as they will not follow them on earth, ſo are they ſure neuer to follow them to heauen. So excellent was the fact of Moſes, and ſo heroicall, that the holy Ghoſt vouchſafes it remembrance both in the olde and new Teſtament, that ſo the Church

in all ages might know it and admire it: and doth Chronicle it in the Epiſtle to the H brewes, almoſt two thouſand yeares after it was done. If God himſelfe did ſo to Moſes, ſhall not Gods Church be carefull to commend to poſterity this ſecond Moſes? whoſe loue to Chriſt Ieſus was ſo zealous, and ſo inflamed by the heauenly fire of Gods ſpirit, that no earthly temptations could either quench or abate it; but to winne Chriſt, and to enioy him in the liberty of his word and Sacraments, he delicately contemned the honors and pleaſures of the Marqueſdome of Vicum. Vicum one of the Paradiſes of Naples: Naples the Paradiſe of Italy: Italy of Europe: Europe o▪the earth: yet all theſe Paradiſes were nothing to him, in compariſon of attaining the celeſtiall Paradiſe, there to liue with Ieſus Chriſt.
            If any Papiſts (muſing as they vſe, and meaſuring vs by themſelues) do ſuſpect the ſtory to be ſome fained thing, deuiſed to allure and intiſe the peoples minds; and to ſet a flouriſh vpon our Religion, as they by a thouſand falſe and fained ſtories and mirables vſe to doe. I anſwere, firſt in the generall; farre be it from vs and our Religion to vſe ſuch meanes, either for our ſelues, or againſt our aduerſaries: No, we are content the Church of Rome haue the glory of that garland: Popery being a ſandie and a ſhaken, a rotten and a tottering building needs ſuch proppes to vnderſet it: but truth dare ſhew her ſelfe, and feares no colours. But for the particular, I anſwere: cunning liers (as many Monkes were) framed their tales of men that liued long agoe, and places a farre off and vnknowen; that ſo their reports may not too eaſily be brought to triall. But in this caſe it is far otherwiſe; the circumſtances are notorious; the perſons and places famouſly knowen: Vicum, Naples, Italy, Geneua, are places wel knowen: Calantonius his father, Charles the fiſt, his Lord and Maſter, Pope Paul the fourth his vncle, were perſons well knowen: examine either places or perſons, and ſpare none; truth ſeekes no corners; diſproue the ſtory who can, we craue no ſparing: neither is the time too farre paſt, but may ſoone be examined. He was borne within theſe hundred years, and died at Geneua within theſe twenty yeares: and his ſonnes ſonne at this day is Marqueſſe of Vicum. Let any Papiſt doe what he can, he ſhall haue more comfort in following the example, then credit in ſeeking to diſproue the ſtorie.
            In the courſe of my poore reading (right Honourable) I haue often found mention of this noble Marqueſſe, and of his ſtrange conuerſion; but the ſtorie it ſelfe, I firſt found it in the exquiſit Library of the good gentleman Maſter Gee; one that honours learning in others, and cheriſheth it in himſelfe; and hauing not once red it, but often peruſed it, I thought it great loſſe to our Church to want ſo rare a iewel; and therfore could not but take the benefit of ſome ſtolne houres to put the ſame into our tongue, for the benefit of my brethren in this Realme, who want knowledge in Italian and Latine tongues. And now being tranſlated, I humbly offer and conſecrate it to my holy mother the Church of Fngland; who may reioyce to ſee her Religion ſpredding it ſelfe priuily in the heart of Italy; and to ſee the Popes nephew become her ſonne. And next of all vnto you (right Honourable) to whom I am bound in ſo many bonds of duety, and

to whom this ſtory doth ſo fitly appertaine. You (my honourable good Lord) may here ſee a noble gentleman of your own rank in deſcent, birth, education, aduancements like your ſelfe; to be like you alſo in the loue and liking of the ſame holy Religion. And you good Madam, may here conceiue &amp; iudge by your ſelfe, how much more happy this noble Marqueſſe had bin, if his Lady Madam Victoria had bin like your ſelfe. I meane, if ſhe had followed and accompanied her Lord in that his moſt holy and happy conuerſion. And you all (right Honourable) in this noble Marqueſſe as in a cryſtal glaſſe, may behold your ſelues: of whom I hope you wil giue me leaue to ſpeake (that which to the great glory of God you ſpare not to ſpeake of your ſelues) that you were once darknes, but now are light in the Lord: Bleſſed be that God the father of light, whoſe glorious light hath ſhined into your hearts: Behold (right honorable) you are not alone; behold an Italian; behold a noble Marqueſſe hath broken the ice, and troden the path before you: In him you may ſee that Gods Religion is as well in Italy as in England: I meane that though the face of Italy be the ſeat of Autichriſt, yet in the heart thereof there is a remnant of the Lord of hoſts. You may ſee this noble Marqueſſe in this ſtory now after his death, whom in his life time ſo many noble Princes deſired to ſee. His body hath lien in the bowels of the earth theſe ſeuenteene yeares, but his ſoule liues in heauen in the boſome of Ieſus Chriſt, and his Religion in your hearts, and his name ſhall liue for euer in this ſtory. Accept it therfore (right honourable) and if for my ſake you will vouchſafe to read it once ouer, I dare ſay that afterwards for your owne ſake you will read it ouer and ouer againe: which if you do, you ſhall find it wil ſtir vp your pure minds, &amp; inflame your hearts with a yet more earneſt zeale to the truth: and wil be an effectuall meanes to increaſe your faith, your feare of God, your humility, patience, cōſtancy, and al other holy vertues of regeneration. And for my part, I freely &amp; truely profeſſe I haue bin often rauiſht with admiration of this noble example; to ſee an Italian, ſo excellent a Chriſtian, one ſo neere the Pope, ſo neere to Ieſus Chriſt; and ſuch bleſſed fruit to bloſſome in the Popes own garden; and to ſee a noble man of Italy forſake that for Chriſt, for which, I feare, many amongſt vs would forſake Chriſt himſelfe. And ſurely (I confeſſe truth) the ſerious conſideration of this ſo late, ſo true, ſo ſtrange an example, hath bin a ſpur to my ſlownes, &amp; whetted my dul ſpirits, and made me to eſteeme more highly of Religion then I did before. I know it is an accuſation of my ſelfe, &amp; a diſcloſing of my own ſhame to confeſſe thus much; but it is a glory to God, an honour to Religion, a credit to the truth, and a praiſe to this noble Marqueſſe, and therefore I will not hide it.
            And why ſhould I ſhame to confeſſe it? when that famous &amp; renowned man of God, holy Caluine freely confeſſeth (as in the ſequell of this ſtory you ſhall heare) that this noble mans example did greatly confirme him in his Religion, and did reuiue and ſtrengthen his faith, and cheere vp all the holy graces of God in him. And ſurely (moſt worthy Lord, and honorable Ladies) this cannot but confirme and comfort you in your holy courſes, and as it were put a new life vnto the graces of God in you, when you ſee, what; not the common people, but euen ſuch as were like your

ſelues haue ſuffred for Religion; and when you ſee that not only the poore and baſer ſort of men, but euen the mighty and honourable (as your ſelues are) doe thinke themſelues honored by embracing Religion. Pardon my plainenes and too much boldnes with your honors, &amp; vouchſafe to accept it as proceeding from one who much tendreth your ſaluations, and reioyceth with many thouſands more, to behold the mighty &amp; gracious work of God in you. Goe forward right noble Lord, in the name of the Lord of hoſts, ſtill to honour that honorable place you hold, ſtil to defeat the vaine expectation of Gods enemies; and to ſatisfie the godly hopes and deſires of holy men: ſtill to diſcountenance Popery and all prophanenes: ſtil by your perſonall diligence in frequenting holy exerciſes, to bring on that backward citie: by your godly diſcipline in your familie, to reforme or to condemne the diſſolutnes and diſorder of the moſt great families in this country: ſtil to miniſter iuſtice without delay; to cut vp contentions, &amp; ſaue the lawyers labour: ſtill to relieue the fatherleſſe and the widow, and helpe the poore againſt their oppreſſors: and which is all in all, ſtill to ſupplant ſuperſtition, popery, ignorance, and wilfull blindnes; and to plant and diſperſe true Religion in that citie, and theſe Northern countries. By al theſe meanes ſtill ſhewing your ſelfe an holy and zealous Phinehes (vnder the great Phinehes our moſt worthy Soueraigne) to execute Gods iudgement, and to take vengeance on the Zimri and Cozbi of our nation: namely, on Popery and prophanenes; the two great ſinnes which haue pulled downe Gods plagues on our land, and the due and zealous puniſhment whereof, will be the meanes againe to remoue them.
            But I wrong your Honours to trouble you with theſe my too many and too ragged lines: and I wrong this noble Gentleman to cloth his golden ſtory with this my rude and home-ſpun Engliſh ſtile: and I wrong you all to keepe you ſo long from being acquainted with this noble Marqueſſe, ſo like your ſelues; at whoſe meeting and acquaintance I am ſure there will be ſo much reioycing, and mutuall congratulating at the mighty and gratious worke of God in you all. The ſame God and mercifull father I humbly beſeech, and euer will, to accompliſh his good worke in you, as he did in that noble Marqueſſe: and as he hath already made you ſo many waies bleſſed; bleſſed in your ſelues, bleſſed one in another, bleſſed in your conuerſions, bleſſed aboue many, in your many and religious children: ſo at laſt he may make you moſt of all bleſſed in your ends; that ſo after this life, you may attaine the eternall glory of a better world, whither this noble Marqueſſe is gone before you.
            
               From my ſtudie, Ian. 12. 1603.
               
               Your Honours in all Chriſtian duety, W. CRASHAVV.
            
         
         
            
            TO THE CRISTIAN and courteous Reader.
            
               GOOD Reader, conceiue I pray thee, that this tranſlation being made diuers yeares agoe, and communicated to my priuate friends; I thought to haue ſuppreſſed it from ſpreading further: but being preſſed by importunitie, and vrged with vnauoidable reaſons, I haue now yeelded to let it paſſe in publike: the rather conſidering, that though at this day almoſt euery houre yeeldes a new booke, yet many ages affoord ſcarce one example like to this. I haue diuided it into Chapters for thy better eaſe in reading and remembring: and ſeeing I find in other Authors often mention of this noble Marqueſſe, and his heroicallfact: I haue therefore not tied my ſelfe preciſely to the words of the Latine ſtory, but keeping the ſenſe and ſcope, haue ſometime inlarged my ſelfe as the circumſtance ſeemed to require, or as I had warrant and direction from other ſtories.

            CHAP. 1.
            Of the linage, birth, and infancy of Galeacius Caracciolus the noble Marqueſſe of Vico.
            
               My purpoſe is to commit to writing the life of Galeacius Caracciolus: as being a rare example of a moſt ſtrange and ſeldome ſeene conſtancy in the defence of Godlineſſe and true Chriſtian Religion.
            
            
               HE was borne at Naples, a renowned Citie in Italie, in the moneth of Ianuary, in the yeare of Chriſt 1517.The very yeare when Luther began to preach the Goſpell. His fathers name was Calantonius, who was deſcended of the ancient and noble houſe of the Caracciolies in the Country of Capua. This Calantonius euen in his youth, was not onely well reſpected, but highly eſteemed, and a familiar friend of that noble Prince of Orarge, who after the taking and ſacking of Rome, was placed in the roome of the Duke of Borben: yea his faithfulneſſe and induſtry was ſo well approued to the Prince (as often times afore, ſo eſpecially) at the ſiege of Naples, what time it was aſſaulted by Lotrechius, as that afterward, when the Emperour Charles the fiſt of that name, (who then was at Rome to receiue the Imperiall crowne and other ornaments of the Empire) did appoint the ſaid Prince with certaine forces, to go and beſiege the Citie of Florence; he thought it needfull to take the ſaid Calantonius with him, for his wiſedome and graue counſell. From whence when that ſeruice was ended, he being ſent to Caſar himſelfe, he did ſo wiſely demeane himſelfe in all his affaires, and did ſo ſufficiently ſatisfie the Emperour in

all things, that he made good in euery point, that worthy teſtimony which the Prince had giuen of him; whereupon he being at that time moſt honourably entertained of the Emperour himſelfe, was by him not only aduanced to the ſtate and title of a Marqueſſe, but alſo equally ioyned in commiſſion with the Viceroy of Naples (for his wiſedome and experience in all kind of affaires) to be aſſiſtant vnto him, and fellow with him in ſwaying the Scepter of that Kingdome. In which office and function hee ſo caried himſelfe, as he wonne the good will of both ſmall and great, as wel of the Nobles, as of the Commonalty: yea inſomuch as he was deepely inueſted in the fauour of the Emperour Charles and king Philip his ſonne. And ſo he continued in this dignitie till the laſt day of his life, which was in the moneth of February, in the yeare 1562. he being himſelfe more then three ſcore and ten yeares of age.
            Such a father, and no worſe had this Galeacius. As for his mother, ſhe was deſcended of the noble familie of the Caraffi: and her owne brother was afterwardThat is, Pope Paul the fourth. Pope of Rome. Which I affirm notto that end, as though this in it ſelf was any true praiſe or honour to Galeacius, but that his loue to true Religion, and his conſtancy in defence thereof, (euen againſt ſuch mighty ones) may appeare the more admirable to all that heare it, as it hereby did to all that knew him. Ofwhich his loue to true Religion, we ſhall ſpeake more anon.
            
               Galeacius being twenty yeares olde, and the onely ſonne of his mother, who was now deceaſed; his father Calantonius being deſirous to continue his name, to preſerue his houſe and poſteritie, and to maintaine his eſtate and patrimonie, whoſe lands amounted to the ſumme of fiue thouſand poundes a yeare and vpward; did therefore prouide him a wife, a Virgin of noble birth, called Victoria, daughter to the Duke of Nuceria, one of the principal Peeres of Italy, with whom he had in name of portion or dowrie ſixe thouſand fiue hundred pounds. He liued with his wife Victoria vnto the yeare 1551. at which time he forſooke houſe, familie,

and country for Religions ſake: and in that time he had by his wife ſix children, (foure ſonnes and two daughters.) His eldeſt ſonne died at Panorma, in the yeare 1577. leauing behind him one ſonne and one daughter: the ſonne obtayning by inheritance the Marqueſdome of Vicum▪
                (amongſt diuers other things) married a wife of noble birth afore his grandfather Galeacius died. By whom, as I heare, he hath two children, to whom this Galeacius is great Grandfather.
            Now all theſe particulars doe I thus ſet downe to this end, that the perſeuerance of ſo great a man may appeare the better by all theſe circumſtances, which is no leſſe then a moſt glorious victory ouer ſo many temptations.
         
         
            CHAP. II.
            Of his preferment at Court, and the firſt occaſion of his conuerſion.
            THe Marqueſſe Calantonius ſeeing ſo good hope of the continuance of his houſe and poſterity, deſiring not to preſerue onely, but to increaſe and augment the dignity of his houſe, purpoſed therefore that his ſonne Galeacius ſhould ſeeke further honour and follow the Court. Wherefore making offer of him to the Emperour Charles, he was moſt kindly entertained into the Emperours houſe and ſeruice, and ſoone after was made the Emperours Gentlemanſewer. In which place and office within ſhort time, he both wonne the fauour of the Nobility, and the reſt of the Court, and grewe to be of ſpeciall account euen with the Emperour himſelfe: for all mens opinion and iudgement of him was, that there was not one of many to be compared with him, for innocency of life, elegancy of manners, ſound iudgement and knowledge of many things. Thus Galeacius was in all mens opinions, in the high way to all honour and eſtimation: for the Prince whom he ſerued was moſt mighty, and the Monarch of the biggeſt part of the Chriſtian world. But all this was little: for God, the king of

kings, of his ſingular mercy and grace did purpoſe to call him to farre greater dignity, and to more certaine and durable riches. And this ſo great and rare a work did the Lord bring to paſſe, by ſtrange and ſpeciall meanes. So it was that in thoſe daies a certaine Spaniard, a noble man, did ſoiourne at Naplcs, who had to name Iohannes Waldeſius: this Gentleman being come to ſome knowledge of the truth of the Goſpell, and eſpecially of the doctrine of Iuſtification; vſed often to conferre with, and to inſtruct diuers other noble men his companions and familiars, in points of Religion, confuting the falſe opinions of our owne inherent Iuſtification, and of the merits of good workes, and ſo conſequently detecting the vanity of many Popiſh points, and the fondneſſe of their ſuperſtitions: by which meanes he ſo preuailed, or rather the Lord by him, that diuers of theſe noble Gentlemen began to creepe out of Popiſh darkeneſſe, and to perceiue ſome light of the truth: Amongſt theſe, was there one Iohannes Franciſcus Caeſarta, a noble Gentleman and kinſeman to this our Galeacius.
            
            Of this Gentleman firſt of all did Galeacius heare diuers things in conference, which ſeemed to him much contrary to the courſe of the vaine world; yea much to croſſe euen his age and eſtate, and courſe of life; as namely of the true meanes of our Iuſtification, of the excellency and power of Gods word, of the vanity of the moſt of Popiſh ſuperſtitions, &amp;c. For Galeacius eſteemed and vſed this Gentleman as his familiar friend, both being neere of his blood, and eſpecially for that hee was▪ a Gentleman of very good parts. Now although the ſpeeches of this gentleman did not at the firſt ſo farre preuaile with him, as to make him forſake the vanities of this life; notwithſtanding it was not altogether in vaine: for that God which had ordeined him to be a ſpeciall inſtrument of his glory, would not ſuffer ſo good ſeed to periſh, though it ſeemed for a time to be caſt euen amongſt thornes: neither will it be beſide the purpoſe to ſet downe particularly the meanes, which it pleaſed God to

vſe for the working of this ſtrange conuerſion: amongſt which this was one.
         
         
            CHAP. III.
            Of the meanes of his further Sanctification.
            AT that time Peter Martyr Vermilius a Florentine, was a publik Preacher and Reader at Naples. This man was a Canon regular (as they call them) a man ſince then of great name, for his ſingular knowledge in Chriſtian Religion, his godly manners and behauiours, and for his ſweet and copious teaching; for he afterward caſting away his monkes coule, and renouncing the ſuperſtitions of Poperie, he ſhone ſo brightly in Gods Church, that he diſperſed and ſtrangely droue away the darkeneſſe and miſts of popery. Galeacius was once content at Caeſerta his motion to be drawen to heare Peter Martyrs Sermon; yet not ſo much for any deſire he had to learne, as moued and tickled with a curious humour, to heare ſo famous a man as then Martyr was accounted. At that time Peter Martyr was in hand with Pauls firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, and as he was ſhewing the weakeneſſe and deceitfulnes of the iudgement of mans reaſon in ſpirituall things, as likewiſe the power and efficacy of the word of God, in thoſe men in whom the Lord worketh by his ſpirit; amongſt other things he vſed this ſimilie or compariſon: If a man walking in a large place, ſee a farre off men and women dancing together, and heare no ſound of inſtrument, he wil iudge them mad, or at leaſt fooliſh; but if he come neerer them, and perceiue their order and heare their muſicke, and marke their meaſures and their courſes, he will then be of another minde, and not onely take delight in ſeeing them, but feele a deſire in himſelf to beare them company and dance with them. Euen the ſame (ſaid Martyr) betides many men, who whē they behold in others a ſuddain and great change of their looks, apparell, behauiour, and whole courſe of life, at the firſt

ſight they impute it to melancholy or ſome other fooliſh humour; but if they looke more narrowly into the matter, and begin to heare and perceiue the harmony and ſweete concent of Gods ſpirit, and his word in them, (by the ioint power of which two, this change was made and wrought, which afore they counted folly,) then they change their opinion of them, and firſt of all begin to like them, and that change in them, and afterward feele in themſelues a motion and deſire to imitate them, and to be of the number of ſuch men, who forſaking the world and his vanities, doe thinke that they ought to reforme their liues by the rule of the Goſpell, that ſo they may come to true and ſound holineſſe. This compariſon by the grace of Gods Spirit wrought ſo wonderfully with Galeacius, (as himſelfe hath often toldeSee how the firſt ſtep of a mans conuerſion from popery, is true and ſound mortification of carnall luſts, and a change of life. See alſo how the firſt meanes to bring a man out of error to the truth, is ſtudy of holy Scriptures. his friends) that from that houre he reſolued with himſelfe, more carefully to reſtraine his affections from following the world, and his pleaſures, as before they did, and to ſet his mind about ſeeking out the truth of Religion, and the way to true happineſſe. To this purpoſe he began to reade the Scriptures euery day, being perſwaded, that truth of Religion and ſoundneſſe of wiſedome was to be drawen out of that fountaine, and that the high way to heauen was thence to be ſought. And further, all his acquaintance and familiarity did he turne into ſuch company, as out of whoſe life and conferences, he was perſwaded he might reape the fruit of godlineſſe and pure Religion. And thus farre in this ſhort time had the Lord wrought with him by that Sermon: as firſt, to conſiderwith himſelf ſeriouſly whether he was right or no: ſecondly, to take vp an exerciſe continuall of reading Scripture: thirdly, to change his former company, and make choice of better. And this was done in the yeare one thouſand fiue hundred fortie and one, and in the foure and twentieth yeare of his age.
         
         
            
            CHAP. IIII.
            Of the ſtrange cenſures the world gaue of his conuerſion, and how the better ſort reioyced at it.
            BVt when this ſudden alteration of this noble and yong Galeacius was ſeene and perceiued in Naples, it can be ſcarce ſet downe how greatly it amazed his old companions, which as yet cleaued to the world▪ and to the affections of the fleſh: many of them able to render no cauſe of it, could not tell what to ſay of it; ſome iudged it but a melancholicke paſſion; others thought it plaine follie, and feared he would become ſimple and doting and that his wit began by ſome meanes to be empaired Thus euery one gaue his verdict and cenſure of him, but all wondred, and doubted what it would turne to. But the better ſort of men and ſuch as feared God, and had their mind enlightned with ſome knowledge of Religion, as they wondred no leſſe to ſee ſo great a change in ſo great a man, ſo likewiſe they were ſurprized with exceeding ioy to ſee it: for they were perſwaded that God had ſome great and extraordinary work in it; that a yong gallant, a noble man of ſuch wealth, and honor as he was, liuing in ſuch delight and pleaſures, in ſo general a corruption of life, both in court and countrey, but eſpecially this age, nobility, wealth and honour being ioyned with the wanton deliciouſnes of the courtly life: I ſay, that ſuch a man ſhould bee indued with the ſpirit of holineſſe, and ſo farre affected with repentance, as that he ſhould contemne all thoſe in reſpect of heauen; they eſteemed of it (as it was indeed) a rare matter and ſeldome ſeene in the world: and therefore they greatly reioyced at it, and praiſed the Lord on his behalfe. Amongſt thoſe men that thus reioyced at his conuerſion, was one Marcus Antonius Flaminius a ſcholar of great name, and an excellent Poet, as his Paraphraſe on the Pſalmes, and other very good Poems do ſufficiently teſtifie. Galeacius about this time receiued a

letter from this Flaminius, wherein▪ he did congratulate and reioyce with him, for the grace and gift of God, which was beſto wed on him in his conuerſion. This letter I thought good to inſert into the bodie of this ſtory, (as being worthy of no leſſe) to the end that it might be a witnes in times to come, of the good opinion which ſuch men had conceiued of him, who knew the foundatiō of true Iuſtification, thogh they were yet poſſeſſed with other errours, as about the Sacraments, and of the Maſſe, &amp;c. which alas as yet they were not able to diſcerne of, as after by the greater grace of God this Galeacius did. The copy of the letter is this.
         
         
            CHAP. V.
            Marcus Antonius Flaminius a great ſcholar in Italie, writeth to Galeacius, and congratulateth with him, for his holy and happy change.
            
               
                  To the right honourable Galeacius Caracciolus.
                  RIght noble Lord, when I conſider ſeriouſly theſe words of Paul. *Brethren you ſee your calling, that not
                     1. Cor. 1. 26, 27. 
                     many noble, not many wiſe, according to the fleſh, not many mightie are called: but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of this world to confound the wiſe, and weake things to confound the mightie, and baſe things in the world, and things not accounted of, and things that are not, to bring to nought things that are. When I ſay, I conſider of theſe words ſo often, I admire at that rare bleſſing of God, which he hath vouchſafed to you a noble and mighty man: namely, that he ſhould grace you with that true and incomparable nobility, which is attained by true faith in Chriſt Ieſus, and a holy life. As much greater as this bleſſing is, ſo much the more holy and ſincere ought your life to be, and ſo much the more vprightly are you to walke with your God; leſt that your thornes (that is, riches, pleaſures, and honours,) ſhould choke the ſeede of the Goſpell

which is ſowne in you. For this I am ſure of, that God hath begun ſome great worke in you, which he will finiſh to the glory of his owne name, and will bring to paſſe; that as heretofore you had care ſo to liue a noble man, amongſt noble men, that you might obſerue the decorum and maintine the dignity of nobilitie: ſo hereafter that you may employ your whole ſelfe in this, that you may defend and vphold the honor &amp; dignity of the children of God; whoſe duety it is to aime at the perfection of their father with al endeuors; and in their life vpon the earth to reſemble that holy &amp; heauenly life, which they ſhal lead in the world to come. Call to mind continually (my good Lord) in all your words and deedes, that we are graced with this honour to be made the ſonnes of God by Ieſus Chriſt: for that mediation will by the helpe of the holy Ghoſt, worke this care in vs, that we neuer commit any thing vnworthy of that holy name of Chriſt, by which we are called. And yet alas, ſuch is our eſtate, as that if we do endeuour to pleaſe Chriſt, we are ſure to diſpleaſe men, and muſt bee content to contemne the vaine glory of the world, that we may enioy heauenly and eternall glory with God; for it is impoſſible (as Chriſt ſaith) for him to beleeue in God, which
                     Iohn. 
                     ſeekes the honour and praiſe of men. I meane of the men of this world, which as the kingly Prophet ſaith, are lighter and
                     Pſal. 
                     vainer then vanity it ſelfe. And therefore their iudgement is little worth, and leſſe to be eſteemed; but rather the iudgement of God, who ſeeth not all our actions onely, but euen our moſt hidden thoughts and purpoſes. Which being ſo, were it not folly and madneſſe to diſpleaſe ſuch a God, to pleaſe ſo fond a world? It were a ſhamefull thing if a wife ſhould endeuour to pleaſe other men, rather then her husband. How much more then vnworthy is it if our ſoules ſhould rather ayme to pleaſe the vaine world, then their moſt holy ſpouſe Chriſt Ieſus? If the onely ſonne of God was content, not only to be reuiled, yea and ſcourged; but euen to die vpon the croſſe as a curſed malefactor, and all for vs: why ſhould not we much more beare patiently

the taunts and mockes, yea euen the ſlanders of Gods enemies? Let vs therfore arme our ſelues as it were with a holy pride, and (in a ſort) ſcorne and laugh at their mockes: and putting vpon vs mercy and pity as the feeling members of Chriſt, let vs bewaile ſo great blindneſſe in them, and let vs intreat the Lord for them, to pull them out of that palpable darkneſſe into his true and marueilous light, leſt Satan binde them to himſelfe in his euerlaſting prentiſhippe; and ſo being his bondſlanes, and hired ſworne ſeruants of his blacke guard, doe ſend them out to perſecute Ieſus Chriſt in his members. Which when they haue done all they can, and all that the diuell their maſter can teach them, though the diuell himſelfe ſhould burſt with malice, and they for anger grinde their teeth; yet ſhall it all tend to the magnifying of Gods glory, which they labour to obſcure, and to the furtherance of their ſaluation whom they ſo diſdained: yea to the increaſe of their glory in a better world, whom in this world they thought worthy of nothing, but of all diſgrace. And ſurely (my moſt honourable Lord) he that is poſſeſſed with the certaintie of this faith, will without doubt make open warre with the corrupt affections of his owne nature, and with all the world: yea euen with the diuell himſelfe, and will not doubt but in time euen to ouercome them al. Therfore let vs humble our ſelues to our God and Father euerlaſting, that he would increaſe that ſaith in vs, &amp; bring forth in vs thoſe moſt bleſſed &amp; ſweet fruits of faith in our harts &amp; liues, which he vſeth to work in them whom he hath elected: that ſo our faith being fruitful of good works, may appeare to be not a fained but a true faith: not a dead but a liuing faith: not a humane but a diuine worke in vs: that ſo it may be to vs an infallible pledge of our ſaluation to come. Let vs labour to ſhew our ſelues the legitimate and vndoubted children of God, in ſeeking aboue all things, that his moſt holy name may be ſanctified in our ſelues and others; and in imitating his admirable loue and gentleneſſe, which makes his ſunne to ſhine on good and badde. Let vs worſhip his heauenly

Maieſtie in ſpirit and truth: and let vs yeeld vp the temple of our heartsto Chriſt Ieſus as an acceptable ſacrifice vnto him: yea letvs ſhew our ſelues members of the heauenly high Prieſt Chriſt Ieſus, in ſacificing to God our owne bodies, and in crucifying the fleſh with the affections and the luſts thereof; that ſinne being dead in vs, the ſpirit of God may create in vs a ſpirituall life, whereby Chriſt Ieſus may liue in vs. Let vs die to ſinne, and die to our ſelues, and to the world, that we may liue bleſſedly to God and Chriſt Ieſus: yea let vs acknowledge and ſhew by our liues, that we were once 
                        ••
                     ad; but now are raiſed to the life of grace, by the power of Chriſt Ieſus. Let our conuerſation be heauenly, though we liue on the earth: let vs begin that life here which we hope to lead in heauen: let the image of God ſhine bright in vs: let vs diſgrace and weare out the olde image of ſinne and ſatan, and labour to renue the image of Chriſt Ieſus, that all that ſee vs may acknowledge Gods image in vs. Which holy image of grace, as it is beautifull and glorious in all Gods Saints; ſo in you (my good Lord) it ſhall be ſo much more glorious, in as much as you go before others in birth, nobility, honour, and high place. O what a pleaſant ſight is it to all true Chriſtian men; yea to the Angels; yea how acceptable to the Lord himſelfe, to behold a man of your place and eſtate, ſo farre to forget the world and denie himſelfe: ſo deepely to conſider the frailty of his own nature, and the vanity of all temporal things as to ſay with Chriſt, I am a worms and no man: and to crie out with Dauid, turne thy face to me and haue mercy vpon me, for I am
                     Pſal. 
                     deſolate and poore? O happy and true rich man, which hath attained to this ſpirituall and heauenly pouerty, and can giue a farewell to himſelfe, and the world, and all things that he hath for Chriſts ſake, and can freely renounce and forſake carnall reaſon, humane learning, company and counſell of friends, wealth, honours, lord ſhippes, pleaſures of all ſorts, delight of the court, high places and preferments, dignity and offices; yea fauour of Princes; yea his owneſelfe! How welcome ſhall he be to Chriſt, which

can denie all thoſe for Chriſts ſake? Such a one may go for a foole in the world; but he ſhalbe of the Almighties counſell: ſuch a man knoweth that felicity conſiſts not in any thing that this world can afford, and therefore in the midſt of all his wealth and abundance, he crieth out to God as though he had nothing, euen out of the feeling of his heart; Giue vs this day our daily bread. Such a man preferreth the rebuke of Chriſt before the honour of the world, and the afflictions of Chriſts religion, before the pleaſures of the world: and becauſe hee deſpiſeth all things in reſpect of Chriſt, and his righteouſnes, and is poſſeſſed and grounded with Gods ſpirit; therefore hee ſings with true ioy ofPſalme. heart, with the kingly Prophet; The Lord is my ſhepheard, therefore I can want nothing: neither will I feare hunger or any outward thing▪ he feeds me in greene paſtures, and leads me forth beſides the water of comfort. This man diſtruſts himſelfe and all the creatures in the world, that he may truſt and cleaue onely to God: neither aimes he at any pleaſure, any wiſedome, any honour, any riches, any credit or eſtimation; but ſuch as comes from God himſelfe: and therforePſalme. he profeſſeth with the ſame Prophet, I haue none in heauen but thee alone, and none in the earth doe I deſire but thee: my ſleſh conſumeth with longing after thee, and thou Lord art my heritage and portion for euer. He that ſpake thus was a wealthy and mighty King, yet ſuffered he not the eyes ofhis mind to be blinded or dazled with the glittering glory of riches, pleaſures, or honour, or ought elſe that a kingdome could giue: for he knew wel that they al came of God, and were held vnder God, and muſt all be vſed to his glory, and that he that gaue them hath farre better things to giue his children. And therefore that King and Prophet makes1. Chron. 28. his heauenly proclamation before al his people; Bleſſed art thou O Lord God our father for euer and euer: thine O Lord is greatnes, and power, and glory, and victory: all that is in heauen and earth is thine, thine is the kingdome Lord, and thou excellest as head ouer all: riches and honour come of thee, and thou art Lord of all: in thy hand is power, and ſtrength, honour, and dignitis, and kingdomes
                     
                     are in thy diſpoſition: therefore wee giue thee thankes O God, and we extoll thy great and glorious name. But who am I, and what is my people, that we ſhould promiſe ſuch things to thee? For we are ſtrangers before thee, and ſoiourners as all our fathers were; our daies are like a ſhadow vpon the earth, and here is no abiding.
                  
                  See how Dauid cannot content himſelfe in abaſing himſelfe, and extolling the Lord: and in how many words his affections vtter themſelues. This was Dauids meditation, and let this be your looking-glaſſe; and into the looking-glaſſe of this meditation looke once a day, and pray daily that God would ſtill open your eyes to behold your owne vileneſſe; and his incomprehenſible power and loue to yee, that with King Dauid you may humble your ſelfe vnder the mighty hand of his Maieſty, and acknowledge all power and glory to belong to God alone, that ſo you may be made partaker of thoſe heauenly graces, which God beſtoweth not on the proud and lofty, but on the humble and meeke. Remember that ordinance of the eternall God, that ſaith: Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſedome, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, nor the rich man in his
                     Ieremy. 
                     riches, but let him that glorieth, glorie in this, in that he vnderſtandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which doe mercy and iuſtice on earth: for theſe things pleaſe me, ſaith the Lord. (Therefore my good Lord) if you liſt to boaſt, boaſt not as the world doth, that you are rich, or that you are of noble birth, or that you are in fauour with the Emperour and other Princes, or that you are heire apparant of a rich Marqueſdome, or that you haue married ſo noble a waman: leaue this kind of boaſting to them, who haue their minds glued to the world, and therefore haue no better things to boaſt on: whoſe portion being here in this life, they can looke for nothing in heauen. But rather reioyce you in that you are entred into the kingdome of grace; glory in this that the King of kings hath had mercy on you, and hath drawen you out of the miſty darkeneſſe of errors, hath giuen you to feele his endleſſe loue and mercy in Chriſt, hath

made you of the childe of wrath▪ his owne ſonne; of a ſeruant to finne and the diuell, an heire of heauen; and of a bondſlaue to hell, a free deniſion of the heauenly Ieruſalem; and glory in this, that euen Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe is giuen you, and made your owne, and with him all things elſe. So that as Paul ſaith, All are yours, whether the world, or life, or death, things preſent or things to come, all are yours in and by Chriſt, who is the onely felicity of our ſoules; and therefore whoſoeuer haue him, haue with him all thing elſe. This is the true glory and the ſound boaſting of Chriſtianity: for hereby is Gods mercy extolled, and mans pride troden vnder foote, by which a man truſting too much to himſelfe, rebelleth againſt God. This glorious boaſting makes vs humble euen in our higheſt honours: modeſt and meeke in proſperity: patient and quiet in aduerſity: in troubles ſtrong and couragious: gentle towards all men: ioyfull in hope: feruent in praier: full of the loue of God, but empty of all loue of our ſelues or ought in the world: yea it makes vs Chriſts true beadſmen, and his ſworn ſeruants, and maks vs yeelde vp our ſelues wholly to imitate and follow Chriſt, and to eſteeme all things elſe as fraile and vaine; yea

                  Right honourable and my good Lord, you ſee that I am ſo willingly employed in this ſeruice of writing to your honour, and in conferring with you of heauenly matters, that I haue forgot my ſelfe, or rather your honour, in being ſo tedious, which in the beginning I purpoſed not. I am priuie to my ſelfe and of my owneignorance; and guilty of mine owne inſufficiency, as being fitter to be a ſcholar then a teacher; and to heare and learne my ſelfe, rather then to teach others: and therefore I craue pardon of your honour. Farewell. The moſt reuerend Embaſſadour deſireth in his heart he had occaſion to teſtifie indeede, that true good will which in his ſoule he beares you: In the meane time he ſalutes you, &amp; ſo doth the illuſtrious Princeſſe of Piſcarta her highneſſe; and all other the honourable perſonages which are with me▪ all which reioyce for this good worke of God

in you, and in all kindnes do kiſſe your hands; and they do all earneſtly intreat the Lord for you, that he that hath begun ſo great a worke in you, would accompliſh the ſame to the end: and the richer you are in temporall goods, in lands, and lord ſhippes, that he would make you ſo much the more poore in ſpirit; that ſo your ſpirituall pouerty, may doe that which your worldly riches and honour cannot: namely, bring you at laſt to the eternall and neuer fading riches of the world to come: Amen. Farewell. From Viterbium.

            CHAP. VI.
            Of the many temptations the diuell vſed to pull him backe, as by his father, his wife, and by noble men of his acquaintance.
            BY this and other holy meanes Galeacius was confirmed in the doctrine of the truth, and went forward conſtantly in the courſe of Gods calling, and the way of godlines. But the more couragiouſly he went on, the more fiercely the diuell raged againſt him by his temptations; endeuouring thereby to hinder him in that happy courſe: yea and if it were poſsible to driue him backe againe, which courſe lie commonly takes againſt thoſe, who haue propounded to themſelues to tame the rebellion of the ſleſh, and to relinquiſh the vanities of the world. And firſt of all, this zealous courſe of his in Religion procured him an infinit number of mockes, and made him ſubiect to moſt vile ſlanders; yea made him incurre the hatred of a great number, but eſpecially did he herein diſpleaſe &amp; vex his father, as one that was not only of a contrary religion, but one

who onely intended the honour of his houſe, and the aduancing of his poſterity, which in reſpect of Religion Galeacius cared not for at all: and therefore he did often ſharpely chide him, and charged him with his fatherly authoritie, to put away thoſe melancholy conceits (as hee termed them.) No doubt but this was moſt grieuous to him, who alwaies was moſt ſubmiſſe and obedient to his father. But another griefe did more inwardly afflict him, which was in reſpect of his wife Victoria. Who though ſhe was alwaies a moſt kind and dutifull wife, as alſo very wiſe, yet ſhee would by no meanes yeelde to this motion and change of Religion; becauſe ſhe thought and feared it would breed infamy and reproch, to her ſelf and her houſe; and therfore was continually working on him by all meanes and deuices ſhe could: labouring to mooue him by teares and complaints, and by all kinds of intreaty that a wife could vſe to her husband: and withall ſometimes vrging him with ſuch vaine and fond reaſons as commonly women of that Religion are furniſhed withall. What a vexation this was, and what an impediment to his conuerſion, ſuch may iudge eaſily, who are cumbred with husbands or wiues of a contrary Religion. And no little griefe and temptation was it to him, beſides all theſe, that the moſt part of the noble men in and about Naples (being either of his blood, or kinred, or his familiar friends) vſed continually to reſort vnto him, to follow their old and ordinary ſports and pleaſures. Alas how hard a thing was it to ſhake off all theſe on a ſudden, and to take vpon him a direct contrary courſe of life to that he had ledde with them afore; which he muſt needs doe if he would goe on as he had begun? And further, it was no little vexation to his ſoule to liue in the Court, when his office and place called him thereunto: for there hee might heare of any thing rather then of Religion: and not a word by any meanes of Gods word, but talke enough of common and worldly preferments and pleaſures, and deuiſing of meanes for the moſt cruell handling and diſpatching out of the way all ſuch as ſhould depart from the Romiſh

faith. Any Chriſtian heart may eaſily conceiue how deepely thoſe temptations and hinderances vexed his righteous ſoule in this his courſe towards God: inſomuch as a thouſand to one, they had turned him backe againe; and doubtleſſe they had done ſo indeed, had not God aſſiſted him with ſpeciall grace.
         
         
            CHAP. VII.
            How he eſcaped the ſnares of the Arrian Anabaptiſts, and▪ after of the Waldeſians: and of his reſolution to leaue his countrey, hono urs, and liuings, to enioy the liberty of Gods Religion.
            BVt aboue all theſe, Satan had one aſſault ſtrongeſt of all, whereby he attempted to ſeduce him from the true and ſincere Religion of God. About that time the Realme of Naples was ſore peſtred with Arrians and Anabaptiſts: who daily broched their hereſies amongſt the common people, colouring them ouer with glorious ſhewes. Theſe fellowes perceiuing Galeacius not fully ſetled as yet in Religion, nor yet ſufficiently groūded in the ſcripture, tried al meanes they could to intangle him in their errours and blaſphemous fancies: wherein the mightie worke of God was admirable towards him: for he being a youth, a gentleman, but a meane ſcholar▪ and little ſtudied, and but lately entred into the ſchoole of Chriſtian Religion; who would haue thought that euer he could haue reſiſted and eſcaped the ſnares of thoſe heretikes; many of them being great and grounded ſcholars, and throughly ſtudied in the Scripture? Notwithſtanding, by the ſincere ſimplicity and plainneſſe of Gods truth, and the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, hee not onely deſcried the fondneſſe of their hereſies, but euen vntied the knots, and brake their nets, and deliuered himſelfe, and mightily confuted them: yea ſuch was the working of God, as being ſometime in their meetings, hee was

ſtrongly confirmed in the doctrine of the truth by ſeeing and hearing them. Thus by Gods mercie he eſcaped and was conquerour in this ſight.
            But the diuell had not ſo done with him, for another and more dangerous battell preſently followed. The Waldeſians, of whom wee ſpake before, were at that time in Naples in good number. With them did Galeacius daily conuerſe, their courſes of life and ſtudy being not farre vnlike. Theſe diſciples of Waldeſius knew as yet no more in Religion but the point of Iuſtification: and miſliked and eſchewed ſome abuſes in Popery; and neuertheleſſe ſtill frequented Popiſh Churches; heard Maſſes, and were preſent ordinarily at vile Idolatries. Galeacius for a time conuerſed with theſe men, and followed their way: which courſe doubtleſſe would haue ſpoiled him, as it did a great ſort of them; who afterwards being taken and committed for the truth, were eaſily brought to recant their Religion, becauſe they wanted the chiefe and the moſt excellent points, nor were ſufficiently ſetled: and yet afterwards againe, not daring to forſake their hold in Iuſtification; and therefore comming to it againe, were taken as relapſers and backſliders, and put to extreame torments and cruell death. In the like danger had Galeacius beene, but that the good prouidence of God otherwiſe diſpoſed, and better prouided for him: for his office and place that he bare in the Emperours Court, called him into Germany, and ſo withdrew him from his companions the Waldeſians: for the Lord had a greater worke to worke in him then the Waldeſians were able to teach him: for there in Germany hee learned (that he neuer knew afore) that the knowledge of the truth of Iuſtification was not ſufficient for ſaluation; whilſt in the meane time a man wittingly defiled himſelfe with Idolatry, which the Scripture cals ſpirituall whordome: and of no man did he reape more ſound and comfortable inſtruction then of Peter Martyr, of whom we ſpake afore, whom God had lately called out of Italy, and confirmed him in the truth. This Martyr inſtructed Galeacius ſoundly, in the

way of the truth, and made it plaine vnto him, by priuate conferences as well as publicke reading: for he was at that time publick profeſſor of diuinity at Stransbrough in Germany. Galeacius furniſhed with thoſe holy inſtructions, returned to Naples, and preſently reſorting to his companions, the Waldeſians, amongſt other points, conferred with them about the eſchewing of Idolatry, and deliuered his iudgement therein. But they not induring ſcarce to heare it, preſently forſooke him, for they would by no meanes entertaine that doctrine, which they knew was ſure to bring vpon them afflictions, perſecutions, loſſe of goods and honours, or elſe would cauſe them to forſake country, houſe, and land, wife, and childe, and ſo euery way threatened a miſerable eſtate to the profeſſors thereof. Now this their forſaking of him, and telling him of the danger of this profeſsion, was another ſtrong temptation to keepe him wrapped in their Idolatry, and to make him content himſelfe with their imperfect and peeced Religion. But GOD which had in his eternall election predeſtinate him, that he ſhould be a ſingular example of conſtancy to the edification of many, and the confuſion and condemnation of lukewarme profeſſors; gaue him that excellent reſolution, and that heauenly courage, as he eſcaped at laſt conquerour ouer all thoſe temptations and aſſaults of Satan; and nothing could ſuffice or content him but the pure Religion, and alſo the profeſſion of it: and therefore ſeeing no hope of reformation in Naples, nor any hope to haue the Waldeſians ioyne with him, and ſeeing plainely that he could not ſerue God in that countrey; he reſolued vndoubtedly that hee would forſake the countrey, and ſeeke for Chriſt and his Religion whereſoeuer hee might find them; and that hee would rather forſake father, wife, children, goods and lands, offices and preferments to winne Chriſt, then to enioy them all and want Chriſt Ieſus.
         
         
            
            CHAP. VIII.
            Of the grieuous combats betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit, when he reſolued of his departure.
            NOw heree by the way it may not be omitted, what kind of cogitations he hath often ſaid came into his mind, as he was deliberating about this great matter. For firſt of all, as often as he looked on his father, which he did almoſt euery houre, who decrely loued him, and whom againe he reſpected in all duety and reuerence: ſo often doubtleſſe he was ſtriken at the heart with vnſpeakeable griefe to thinke of his departure; his mind no doubt often thinking thus: What, and muſt I needes forſake my deere and louing fathr, and cannot I elſe haue God my Father? O miſerable and vnhappy father of my body, which muſt ſtand in compariſon with the Father of my ſoule! And muſt I needes faile in duety to him, if I performe my duety to God? O miſerable old man! for what deeper wound can pierce him, then thus to be depriued of the onely ſtaffe and comfort of his old age! Alas ſhall I thus leaue him in ſuch a ſea of troubles; and ſhall I bee the onely meanes to ſtrike into his heart the deepeſt wound of grieſe that yet euer pierced him in all his life? This my departure is ſure to make my ſelfe the obloquy of the world: yea to breede reproch and ſhame to the Marqueſſe my father, and to my whole ſtocke and kinred. How is it poſsible that the good old man can ouercome or indure ſo great a griefe, but rather he muſt needs be ſwallowed vp of it, &amp; ſo with woe and miſery end his life? Shall I then be the cauſe of death to my father, who would if neede had beene redeemed my life with his owne death? alas what a miſery is this like to be either to me, or him, or vs both? yet muſt I care leſſe for bringing his gray head with ſorrow vnto the graue, then for caſting my owne poore ſoule with horror into hell. And no leſſe inwardly was he grieued in reſpect ofhis noble wife

               Victoria: for hauing no hope that ſhe would renounce Popery, and go with him, therefore he durſt not make known vnto her the purpoſe of his departure; but rather reſolued for Chriſts ſake to leaue her and all, and to follow Chriſt. Shee was now as he was himſelfe in the prime of youth, a Lady of great birth, faire, wiſe and modeſt; but her loue and loyalty to her husband ſurpaſſed all. How was it poſsible patiently to leaue ſuch a wiſe, ſo that his perplexed mind diſcourſed on this faſhion when he lookt on her: And ſhall I ſo, yea ſo ſuddenly, and ſo vnkindly leaue and forſake my wife, my moſt deere and louing wife, the onely ioy of my heart in this world, my companion and partner in all my griefe and labour; the augmenter of my ioy, the leſſener of my woe? And ſhal I leaue her, not for a time, (as hertofore Idid when the Emperors ſeruice called me from her) but for euer, neuer againe to enioy her: yea it may be neuer to ſee her? And ſhall I depriue my ſelfe of her, &amp; thereby depriue my ſelfe ofal others alſo, &amp; of al the comfort of the coniug all life &amp; married eſtate? And ſhal I ſo leaue her deſolate &amp; alone in that eſtate &amp; age whereof ſhe is? Alas poore Lady, what ſhal ſhe doe, what ſhal become of her, and of her litle ones when I am gone? How many dolefull dayes without comfort, many waking nights without ſleep, ſhal ſhe paſſe ouer? What wil ſhe do but weep &amp; waile, &amp; pine away with grief? And as he caſt theſe things in his mind, he thought he euen ſaw his wife, how ſhe tooke on with her ſelf, ſighing &amp; ſobbing and weeping; yea howling &amp; crying, &amp; running after him with theſe pitifull out-cries: Ah my deere Lord, and ſweete husband; whither will you goe? and will you Ieaue me miſerable woman, comfortleſſe and ſuccourleſſe? What ſhal become of me when you are gone: what can honors, pompes, riches, gold, ſiluer, iewels, friends, company, all delights and pleaſures in the earth; what can they all do to my comfort when I want you? And what ioy can I haue in my children without you, but rather my griefe to be doubled to looke on them? And how can I or the world be perſwaded that you care for them, and for my ſelfe? Is

this the loue that thou haſt ſo often boaſted of? Ah, miſerable loue which hath this iſſue! either neuer didſt thou loue me, elſe neuer had true loue ſo ſtrange an end as this of yours hath, And yet which is worſe then all this, you neuer ſhewed me cauſe of this your ſtrange departue; had I knowen cauſe, it would neuer haue grieued mee halfe ſo much: But now that the cauſe is not knowen, what will the world iudge, but that the fault is in me? at leaſt, if they cannot condemne me for it; yet how reprochfull will it be to me, when euen euery baſe companion dare lay it in my diſh, and point at me with their fingers when I go by, and ſay, this is that fond woman who married him with whom ſhe could not liue, and whom her husband diſdained to liue withall? This is that ſimple foole, who is deſolate hauing a husband; and a widow, her husband yet beeing aliue. Either ſhall I be counted wicked, which haue cauſed thee to leaue me; or fooliſh, miſerable, and vnhappy, who choſe ſo fondly, as to take him, whom I could not be ſure of when I had him. In a word, I ſhall be depriued of thee: yea of all poſsibility of hauing any other, and ſo hauing a husband, I ſhal liue in al miſery altogether without a husband. Theſe two cogitations of his father and his wife greatly tormented him, and the more becauſe hee laboured to keepe cloſe this fire, which burned and boiled in hisheart: namely, to conceale his departure, leſt by being knowne it might haue beene hindred, which he would not for a world.
            Yet there was a third and ſpeciall care that pinched him, and that was for his children, which were ſixe in all; goodly and towardly children, and worthy of ſo noble parents: the more griefe was it, in that they were ſo yong, as that they could not yet conceiue what it was to wanta father; the eldeſt was ſcarce fifteene, and the yongeſt ſcarce foure yeares old: hee loued them with moſt tender and fatherly affection, and was againe loued and honoured of them. It is wonderfull to thinke, how when his wife the Lady did giue into his armes his yongeſt childe to play withall (as oftentimes wiues vſe to doe) how it were poſsible

for him, and what a do he had with himſelfe to containe from floods of teares; eſpecially becauſe his eyes ſeeing them, and his hands holding them, and his heart taking delight and pleaſure in them, his minde could not but diſcourſe on this manner: And ſhall I within theſe few daies vtterly forſake theſe ſweete babes, and leaue them to the wide and wicked world, as though they had neuer beene my children nor I their father? Yea happy had I bin if I had either neuer had them, or hauing them might enioy them. To be a father is a comfort, but a father of no children, and yet to haue children, that is a miſery. And you poore Orphans, what ſhal become of you whē I am gone? your hap is hard euen to be fatherleſſe, your father yet liuing: and what can your great birth now helpe you? for by my departure you ſhall loſe all your honour, all your liuing and wealth, and all dignity whatſoeuer; which otherwiſe you had bin ſure of: nay my departure ſhall not onely depriue you of al this, but lay you open to all infamy, reproch, and ſlander, and bring vpon you all kind of miſery: and thus miſerable man that I am, ſhall the time be curſed that euer they had me to their father. And what can your wofull mother doe when ſhe looketh on you, but weepe and wring her hands, her griefe ſtill increaſing as ſhe lookes vpon you? Yet thus muſt I leaue you al confounded together in heaps of griefe, weeping and wailing one with another, and I in the meane time weeping and wailing for you all. Many other griefes, temptations, and hinderances aſſaulted him, though they were not ſo weighty as theſe formerly named, yet which might haue beene able to haue hindred any mans departure, being in his caſe; as to leaue the company of ſo many gallant noblemen and gentlemen, his kinred and acquaintaince; to loſe ſo honourable an office and place as he bare in the Emperours Court; to leaue for euer his natiue ſoile the delicate Italy; to depriue himſelfe and his poſterity of the noble tittle and rich liuing of a Marqueſdome; to vndertake a moſt long and tedious iourney; to caſt himſelfe into exile, pouerty, ſhame, and many other miſeries without

hope of recouery for euer: to change his former pleaſant life into all hardneſſe, and to giue a farewel to al the delicacies of Italy, wherein he was brought vppe; to leaue that goodly garden of his father the Marqueſſes, which once ſhould be his owne; the goodlieſt garden almoſt in all Italy or all Criſtendome; which was furniſhed with plants of all ſorts; and theſe not onely of all ſuch as grow in Italy, but euen ſuch as were to be got out of all other countries: this garden and Orchard was ſo exquiſite both this way, and in diuers other ſorts of elegancies, that a great number of men of all qualities reſorted daily out of all countries to ſee it. But this and all other the pleaſures and delicacies of this preſent life could doe nothing with him to remooue him from his purpoſe; but he renounced them all, and reſolued to leaue them all to follow Chriſt: ſo ſtrong and admirable was the conſtancy of this noble Gentleman.
         
         
            CHAP. IX.
            How after all the temptations which fleſh and blood laid in his way to hinder his departure, he conſulted with the Lord, and from him receiued grace to ouercome them all.
            BVt it may be asked, whereupon was grounded ſo great vnmoueableneſſe of this purpoſe, or whence came it? If we aske the world and common iudgement, they will anſwere, that doubtleſſe melancholike humours preuailing in him, ſpoiled the man of his iudgement and naturall affections, and empaired common ſenſe and reaſon; and thence proceeded this obſtinate and deſperate purpoſe, as the world iudgeth of it. But if a man lift vp his eyes higher and behold the matter more ſeriouſly, he might haue manifeſtly ſeene that it came to paſſe by the mercifull bleſsing and ſtrong hand of God, who from al eternity had predeſtinate him, that hee ſhould ſtand ſo vnmoueable againſt

all temptations, and continue in one tenour ſteady and ſtedfaſt, vntill he had made voyde all the attempts of Satan, and remoued all the ſtumbling blockes which his fleſh and blood and carnall reaſon could caſt in the way; for the which purpoſe the ſpirit of God enabled him to reaſon with himſelfe on this ſort: Thou Lord art hee who drew and deliueredſt me out of the thick and miſty darknes of ignorance, and haſt enlightned my mind with the light of thy holy ſpirit, and with the heauenly knowledge of thy truth: thou haſt made knowen to me the way of ſaluation, and haſt ranſomed me to thy ſelfe by the blood of thy Sonne. Now therefore good Lord and holy father, I am wholly thine, and conſecrated to thy glory; and as I am thine, I will follow thee, and obey thee, and walke in the way of thy will whitherſoeuer thou ſhalt call me. Not my father, nor my wife, nor my children, nor my honours, nor my lands, nor my riches, nor all my delicacies and pleaſures ſhall hold or hinder me one houre from following thee. I denie my ſelfe O Lord, and I deny this whole world for thee and thy ſake: O Lord thou knoweſt me, and the readineſſe of my mind to wait vpon thee; and how that my heart is inflamed with the fire of thy loue: yet thou ſeeſt againe how many enemies compaſſe mee, how many hinderances lie in me way, and how many temptations and impediments lie vpon me, ſo that I am ſcarce able to moue or lift vp my head vnto thee: O Lord I am now in the depthes of thoſe troubles, out of which the holy Prophet Dauid once cried to thee as I doe now; O Lord haue mercy on me and deliuer my ſoule. And although Satan and my owne fleſh doe affright me in this my purpoſe, whilſt they ſet before my eyes, the croſſe, and the infamy, and the pouerty, and ſo many miſeries, which I am like in this my new profeſſion to vndergoe: notwithſtanding O Lord, I lift vp my ſelfe in the contemplation and beholding of thy infinite Maieſty; and therein I ſee and confeſſe that that croſſe and affliction is bleſſed and glorious, which makes me like and conformable to Chriſt my head; and that infamy to be honorable

which ſets me in the way to true honour; and that pouerty to be deſired, which depriuing a man of ſome temporall goods, wil reward him with an heauenly inheritance, then which, there is nothing more pretious: I meane O Lord with thy owne ſelfe, and thy glory O euerlaſting God, and that by thy onely ſon Ieſus Chriſt; that ſo I enioying thy glorious preſence, may liue for euer with thee in that heanenly ſociety: O bleſſed and happy theſe miſeries which pull me out of the worlds vanities, and ſinke of ſinne; that I may be made heire of an euerlaſting glory. Welcome therfore the croſſe of Chriſt, I wil take it vp O Lord, and wil follow thee: With theſe &amp; ſuch like holy meditations &amp; other holy meanes, he ouercame at laſt all the attempts of Satan, al his owne natural and carnal affections: yea and the world it ſelfe, and verified that in himſelfe which Paul affirmeth of Gods true elect, that they that are Chriſts haue crucified the fleſh with the affections and the luſts: that is, haue crucified their ſoules for Chriſt, who crucified himſelfe for them. O Satan, Gods enemy and his childrens, how vaine were all thy attempts, and how light al thy aſſaults? In vaine doſt thou ſet vpon thoſe for whom Chriſt vouchſafed to die, and ſuffer on the croſſe: vpon which croſſe he ſo brake thy head and thy power, and ſo trampled ouer thee, that now thou ſhalt not be able to touch the leaſt haire of the head of any of thoſe for whom he died. And as for Galeacius, hee had builded his houſe on the rocke, and founded it ſo ſure, that no wind, no raine, nay no floods of griefes, nor tempeſts of troubles, nor whirlewind of temptations could once remoue him: and ſo he continued reſolute as a Chriſtian ſouldier &amp; conqueror; fully minded to leaue his country at the next opportunity he could take: his mind I cannot tell whether more rauiſhed with ioy one way, or more perplexed with griefe another way; but betwixt ioy and griefe he ſtill continued his purpoſe, vntill at laſt his ſpiritual ioy ouercomming his naturall and carnal griefe, he fully concluded that in deſpight of the diuell and all impediments in the world, hee would ſurely goe.
         
         
            
            CHAP. X.
            How he performed his heroicall reſolution, leauing all for Chriſt, and going to Geneua.
            WHereupon making knowen his mind but to a few, &amp; thoſe his moſt familiar friends, and of whom he hoped wel for religion; he wrought vpon them ſo far, as that they promiſed and vowed that they would accompany him in this voluntary &amp; Chriſtian baniſhment, that ſo they migh enioy the true liberty and peace of conſcience in the true Church of God. But how deepe and vnſearchable the iudgements of God are, the euent afterward ſhewed: for diuers of them (though not all) who for a time ſeemed to be indued and led with a moſt earneſt zeale of Gods glorie in this action; when they came to the borders of Italy, &amp; conſidered what they forſooke, and to what they now tooke themſelues: firſt began to looke backe againe to Italy; afterwards went backe againe indeed, and ſo turned againe to the vomit of their pleaſures. But this ingratitude to the Lord for ſo great a fauour offred them, the Lord purſued with a iuſt reuenge: for purpoſing to ſerue God in their pleaſures, and in the midſt of Popery, they were after taken by the Spaniſh Inquiſition; and ſo publikely recanting and abiuring Chriſtian Religion, they were afterward ſubiect to all miſery &amp; infamy; neither truſted nor loued of the one ſide nor the other. This fearful deſertiō &amp; backſliding of theirs, doubtleſſe was moſt grieuous to Galeacius; &amp; verily the diuel hoped hereby yet once again to haue diuerted him from his intended courſe, in making him be forſaken of thoſe by whoſe company and ſociety he hoped to haue been greatly comforted in this diſcomfortable voyage. But notwithſtanding al this, Galeacius continued reſolute in his purpoſe, and at laſt finding opportunity, attempted his departure, and made fit for it; yet made no ſhew of any ſuch matter; but rather coloured and concealed his intent, leſt the authoritie

of his father might any wayes hinder his ſo godly a purpoſe: and ſo gathering together ſome thouſand markes of his mothers goods which ſhe had left him: on the one and twentieth of March, 1551. in the yere ofhis age the foure and thirtieth, he departed from Naples in manner as he was wont to doe afore, making it knowne that he purpoſed to go into Germany to the Emperour; who at that time held his court at Auspurge: and thither indeed he went accordingly, and ſtayed ſeruing in his place and office till the ſixe and twentieth of May in the ſame yeare: Vpon which day▪ leauing the court and the Emperours ſeruice, &amp; his honorable office which there he beare; &amp; taking his laſt and euerlaſting farewel at the court, and all worldly delights, (and yet departing in ordinary ſort as afore, and in purpoſe to goe into the Low countries, as ſome thought) he tooke his iourney ſtraight towad Geneua, and thither came by Gods good hand the eight of Iune, and there reſted his weary body, and repoſed his much more wearied conſcience, with a full ioyfull heart: yea with the greateſtioy that euer came to him in all his life, but onely at the time of his conuerſion.

            Of his arriuall at Geneua, and his entertainment there: and eſpecially his acquaintance and friendſhip with Caluine.
            
            In the city of Ceneua (though there was a Church of Italians who likewiſe were come thither for the Goſpell) yet hee found not one whom he knew, ſaue one Lactantius Rangonius, a noble man of Siena in Italy: this Gentleman had beene one of his familiar acquaintance when they were at home, and now was preacher of Gods word to the Church and Congregations of the Italians, who were then at Geneua, Now when he ſaw that the mercy of God had granted him to ariue at this quiet and happy hauen, where he might with

liberty of conſcience ſerue God, free from the corruptions of the world, and the abominable ſuperſtitions &amp; Idolatry of Antichriſt; preſently he ioyned himſelfe in friendſhip, and yeelded himſelfe to the inſtruction of Maſter Iohn Caluine, the chiefe Miniſter and Preacher of that Church. Caluine being a man of deep inſight and exquiſite iudgement, perceiuing him to be a man of good knowledge and experience, of a moderate and quiet ſpirit, of an innocent and vpright life, and indued with true and ſincere godlineſle; did therefore moſt kindly and louingly intertaine him into his fellowſhippe: for the good man of God in his wiſdome foreſaw that ſuch a man as this, would doubtleſſe become a ſpeciall inſtrument of Gods glory, and a meanes of the confirmation of many (but eſpecially of Italians) in the knowledge and loue of Religion: this holy loue and Chriſtian friendſhippe thus begunne, was ſo ſtrongly grounded betwixt this noble Marqueſſe and renowned Caluine, that it continued till the yeare 1564. which was the laſt yeare of Caluines pilgrimage in the earth, and the entrance into his heauenly reſt. The Church and people of Geneua can teſtifie of their true and conſtant friendſhippe; but it needes not: for there is extant at this day a ſpeciall teſtimony thereof, euen from Caluine himſelfe in a Preface of his; wherein he dedicates to Galeacius, his Commentary vpon the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinths; which I thought good here to ſet downe word by word, that thereby it may appeare how greatly Caluine eſteemed ofhim.

               Caluines Epiſtle to Galeacius, congratulating his holy and happy conuerſion.
            
               
                  To the noble Gentleman, and as well honourable for his excellent vertues, as for his high deſcent and linage, Galeacius Caracciolus, the onely ſonne and heire apparent to the Marqueſſe of Vicum: Iohn Caluine ſendeth greeting in our Lord.
                  
                  
                     I Wiſh that when I firſt put out this Commentary, I had either not knowen at all, or atleaſt more throughly knowen that man, whoſe name I am now conſtrained to blot out of this my Epiſtle: Yet I feare not at al, leſt he ſhould either vpbraid me with inconſtancy▪ or complaine of iniurie offred him, in taking thatfrom him which afore I beſtowed on him; becauſe it was his owne ſeeking, both to eſtrange himſelfe from mee, and from all ſociety with our Church: wherefore he may thanke himſelfe and take the blame on his owne necke: for, for my owne part I am vnwillingly drawne thus farre to change my accuſtomed maner, as to race out any mans name out of my writing. And I bewaile that the man hath throwne himſelfe downe from that ſeat of fame wherein I had placed him: namely, in the forefront of my booke, where my deſire was he ſhould haue ſtood, thereby to haue beene made famous to the world. But the fault is not in me, for as then I held him worthy, ſo ſince then hee hath made himſelfe vnworthy; and therefore let him be as he is, and he for mee buried in obliuion: and ſo for the good will I once bare to him, I ſpare to ſpeake any more of him. And as for you (right

honourable Sir,) I might ſeeke excuſe why I put you now in his roome, but that I am ſo ſufficiently perſwaded of your great good will and true loue to me; the truth whereof can be teſtified by ſo many witneſſes in our Church. And that I may make one wiſh more, I wiſh from my heart that I had knowen you as well ten years agoe, for then I ſhould haue had no cauſe to haue altred the dedicatiō of my booke, as now I do. And as for the publicke eſtate of the Church, it is well that it ſhall not onely loſe nothing by forgetting that man, whoſe name I now blotte out, but by your comming into his ſtead, ſhal receiue a far greater gain, and a ſufficient recompence. For though I know you deſire not the pub licke applauſe of the world, but reſt contented in the teſtimony of Gods ſpirit in your conſcience: (neither is it my purpoſe to publiſh your praiſes to the world) notwithſtanding, I thinke it my duety to make knowne to the readers ſome things concerning you, and whereof my ſelfe and this Church and City are daily eye witneſſes: and yet not ſo much for your praiſe, as for the benefit &amp; inſtruction of the readers. And this is it that I would all men ſhould know &amp; make vſe of; that a Gentleman, a Lord, ſo wel and highly borne, flouriſhing in wealth &amp; honor, bleſſed with a noble &amp; vertuous &amp; louing wife, and many goodly children, liuing in al peace &amp; quietnes at home &amp; abroad, wanting nothing that nature could deſire, &amp; euery way bleſſed of God for all things of this life, ſhould willingly &amp; of his owne accord leaue al thoſe, &amp; forſake his country, a rich &amp; fruitfull &amp; pleaſant ſoile; ſo goodly a patrimony &amp; inheritance, ſo ſtately a houſe, ſeated ſo commodiouſly &amp; ſo pleaſantly, to caſt off al domeſtical delight and ioy which hee might haue had in ſo good a father, wife, children, kinred, affinity, and acquaintauce, and all that for this onely, that he might come &amp; ſerue Chriſt Ieſus in the hard &amp; vnpleaſant warfare of Chriſtianity; and ſhould depriue himſelfe of ſo many alluring delights of nature, &amp; to content himſelf with that ſlēder meaſure of al things which the diſtreſſed eſtateof our Church is able to affoord, &amp; frō al the ſuperfluities of a

Courly &amp; Lordly life, here amongſt vs to betake himſelf to an eaſie rate and frugal kind of life, euen as though he were no better then one of vs: and yet I ſo recite al this to others, as I let it not paſſe without vſe to my ſelfe. For if I do ſet out your vertues in this my Epiſtle, as on the toppe of a Towre for all men to ſee them; that ſo they may conforme themſelues to the imitation of them; it ſhould be ſhame for my ſelfe not to be much more neerely and inwardly touched with a loue of them, who am continually an eye witneſſe of them, and daily behold them, not in an Epiſtle, but in the cleare glaſſe of your owne life: and therefore becauſe that I find in experience how much your example preuailes in me, for the ſtrengthning of my faith, and the increaſe of godlines in me (yea and all other holy men who dwel in the city, doe acknowledge as well as I, that this your example hath beene greatly to their edification in al grace) I thought it therefore a neceſſary duety to impart this rare example of yours to the world; that ſo the profit and benefit of vs might inlarge it ſelfe, and ſpread out of this citie into all the Churches of God; for otherwiſe it were a needleſſe labour to make knowne to the furtheſt parts of Chriſtendome, the vertues of ſuch a man, whoſe nature and diſpoſition is ſo out of loue with pride, and ſo farre remoued from all oſtentation. Now if it ſhall pleaſe God that many others (who dwelling farre off, haue not hitherto heard of you;) ſhall by the ſtrangeneſſe of this your example addreſſe themſelues to the imitation of it, and leaue their pleaſant neſts, whereto the world hath ſetled them ſo faſt; I ſhall thinke my ſelfe bountifully rewarded for theſe my paines: for out of queſtion it ſhould be common and vſuall amongſt Chriſtians, not onely to leaue liuings and lord ſhips, and caſtles and townes, and offices and promotions, when the caſe ſo ſtands that a man may not enioy both Chriſt and them: but euen willingly and cheerefully to deſpiſe and ſhake off whatſoeuer vnder the Sunne (though it be neuer ſo deere and pretious, ſo pleaſant and comfortable) in reſpect and compariſon of Chriſt. But ſuch is the ſlowneſſe and ſluggiſhneſſe

of the moſt of vs, that we doe but coldly and formally profeſſe the Goſpell: but not one of a hundred, if he haue but ſome little land, or peece of a Lordſhip, that will forſake and deſpiſe it for the Goſpel, ſake: yea not one of many, but very hardly is drawn to renounce euen the leaſt gaine or pleaſure, to follow Chriſt without it: ſo farre are they from denying themſelues and laying downe their liues for the defence of it. I wiſh theſe men would looke at you, and obſerue what it is you haue forſaken for loue of Chriſt; and eſpecially I wiſh that all men who haue taken vpon them already the profeſſion of Religion, would labor to reſemble you in the denial of themſelues, (which indeed is the chiefe of all heauenly vertues:) for you can very ſufficiently teſtifie with me, as I can with you, how little ioy we take in theſe mens companies; whoſe liues make it manifeſt, that though they haue left their countries, yet they haue brought hither with them the ſame affections and diſpoſitions which they had at home: which if they had alſo renounced, as wel as they did their countries; then had they beene indeed true deniers of themſelues, and beene partaker with you of that true praiſe; wherein alas, you haue but few compartners. But becauſe I had rather the Reader ſhould gather the truth and ſtrangenes of this your example, then I ſhould goe about in words to expreſſe it; I will therefore ſpare further ſpeech, and turne my ſelfe to God in praier, deſiring of his mercy, that as he hath indued you hitherto with an heroicall courage, and ſpiritual boldneſſe; ſo he would furniſh you with an inuincible conſtancy to endure to the end: for I am not ignorant how ſtrangely the Lord hath exerciſed you heretofore, and what dangerous pikes you haue paſſed ere you came to this: by which former experience your ſpiritual wiſdome is able to conclude, that a hard and toilſome warfare doeth ſtill remaine and wait for you; and what neede there is to haue the hand of God from heauen raught out to aſsiſt vs, you haue ſo ſufficiently lea rned in your former conflicts, as I am ſure you will ioyne with me in prayer, for the gift of perſeuerance to

vs both: and for my part I will not ceaſe to beſeech Ieſus Chriſt our King and God (to whom all power was giuen of his father, and in whom are kept all the treaſures of ſpiritual bleſſings) that he would ſtil preſerue you ſafe in ſoule and body, and arme you againſt all temptations to come, and that ſtill he would proceed to triumph in you ouer the diuell and all his vile and wicked faction, to the magnifying of his owne glory, and the inlarging of his kingdome in your ſelfe, and others of his children.

            CHAP. XIII.
            Newes of his departure to Geneua came to Naples, and the Emperours Court: and how the old Marqueſſe his father and other his friends were affected with the newes.
            AND thus (to returne againe to our ſtory) Galencius ſetled himſelfe downe at Geneua as at a ioyfull reſting place. But when the newes of ſo ſudden and ſtrange a departure, and ſo wilfull an exile came to Naples, and were made knowen in the Emperours Court: it would ſcarce be beleeued or thought, how ſtrangely it affected &amp; moued al that heard it. All men wondred at it, and the moſt could not be perſwaded it was ſo; but when it was certainely knowen and out of doubt, it was ſtrange to ſee, how euery man gaue his verdit of the matter: ſome one way, ſome an other, as the courſe of men in ſuch caſes is. But aboue all, it ſo abaſhed and aſtoniſhed his owne friends and familie, that nothing was heard or ſeene amongſt them, but cries and lamentations, moſt bitter teares and pitiful complaints. And ſurely to haue beholden the ſtate of that family, how

miſerably it ſeemed at that time to bee diſtreſſed: a man would haue thought it euen a liuely paterne and picture of all woe and miſery. But none was more inwardly pinched then the Marqueſſe his father, whoſe age and experience being great, ſeemed to aſſure him of nothing to follow hereupon but infamy and reproch, yea the vtter vndoing and ſubuerſion of his whole eſtate and family; notwithſtanding, paſſing ouer that fit of ſorrow as ſoone and as eaſily as he could, the wretched and carefull olde man began to bethinke himſelfe by what meanes he might preuent ſo miſerable a ruine and fall, which ſeemed to hang ouer him and his. One thing amongſt other came into his mind, which alſo had once cauſed many grieuous temptations to Galeacius, and had much troubled his mind afore his departure. It was this.
         
         
            CHAP. XIIII.
            The firſt meanes vſed by his father the old Marqueſſe to recall him home againe: he ſent a kinſman of his, whom he knew his ſonne deerely loued, to perſwade him to returne, but he could not preuaile.
            
               GAleacius had a coſen-german, whom alwaies hee eſteemed and loued as his brother: this Gentleman ſo tenderly loued of Galeacius did the Marqueſſe ſend to Geneua to his ſonne▪ with commiſſion and letters full of authority, full of proteſtations, full of pitifull complaints, full of cryings and intreatings that he would come home againe; and thereby cheere vp his old father, and make happy againe his vnhappy wife; be a comfort to his diſtreſſed children, a reioycing to his kinsfolkes, and to the whole citie of Naples, and ſaue his whole houſe and poſteritie from that extreame ruine, which otherwiſe it would be ſure to fall into. Thus this Gentleman was diſpatched away and haſted to Geneua,
               
with great hope for their ancient and faithful loue to haue preuailed with Galeacius. Where by the way wee are to remember that Galeacius did alwaies ſo loue him, that the gentleman was not ſo ſorrowful for his departure: but Galeacius was much more ſorowfull that he could not winne him to haue gone with him, in this holy pilgrimage for religions ſake; but he ſo much feared to haue bin hindred himſelfe, that he durſt not deale with this gentleman his deareſt cofin, no nor with his wife, to perſwade them to haue gone with him. The gentleman comming to Geneua inquired after Galeacius. At that time Galeacius dwelt in an ordinary &amp; meane houſe which he had taken to his owne vſe, hauing no more attendance, but onely two ſeruants: the gentleman at laſt found him out, and preſented himſelfe into his ſight: It had bin a pitiful ſpectacle to haue ſeene the meeting of thoſe two gentlemen: their firſt meeting and imbracings were nothing at all, but ſighes and ſobs, and teares, and vnutterable ſignes of griefe: ſuch vnſpeakeable ſorow did their naturall affections breed in them, that for diuers houres they could not ſpeake a word one to other: but at laſt the gentleman, burning in deſire to inioy againe his deareſt Galeacius, braſt forth into ſpeeches, &amp; mixing teares and ſobs with euery worde, deliuered his letters, till hee could come to more liberty of ſpeech: and at laſt hauing obtained of his affections leaue to ſpeake, he added to his letters, exhortations, ſtrong perſwaſions, earneſt entreaties, and withall plentie of teares, that he would haue reſpect to the ouerthrow of his houſe, the griefe of his olde father, the deſperate eſtate of his wife and children, the continual complaints made by all his friends and kinsfolks: all which notwithſtanding were not ſo paſt cure, but that yet they might be remedied by his returne again. This was the ſubſtance of his meſſage. Galeacius taking not long time to aduiſe himſelfe, in this which the world would thinke ſo waighty a caſe, addreſſed him immediatly this anſwere in briefe: that he perceiued very wel▪ al to be true that he ſaid; but as for his departure it was not done raſhly, nor vpon

any fond conceit, but vpon mature deliberation; that the Lord was the author of the action, that Gods grace was the cauſe mouing him, and the meanes whereby he brought it to paſſe: which grace of God, he ſaid, had opened his eyes, and enlightned his mind with the knowledge of the truth; and made him ſee and diſcerne the coſenages, and ſuperſtitions and Idolatry of Popery, which by an impious and ſacrilegious diſtribution diuideth the glory of God (which is incōmunicable) &amp; imparteth the ſame with fained &amp; filthy Idols: he likewiſe told him that he wel foreſaw all the infamies &amp; miſeries which would enſue vpon this his conuerſion: and al the danger &amp; damage which therby his houſe and children were likely to incur. But he ſaid, that ſeeing one of thoſe muſt needes be choſen, either to ſtay at home with a conſcience burdened with a heauy heape of errors and ſuperſtitions piled together by the ſleight of ſatans art, &amp; euery momēt to ſin againſt the Maieſty of God ſo many thouſand waies; or elſe to leaue his houſe, his goods his family, his country, yea the world and all the glory of it, and thereby purchaſe liberty of conſcience to ſerue the Lord according to his word: that therefore he reſolued of the two euils to chuſe the leſſe, and of the two good to chuſe the greater, and rather to ſhut his eies at all theſe, then the ſight of them ſhould hinder him from yeelding to the cal and voice of his Sauiour Chriſt: who ſaith, That a man is not worthy to be his diſciple, who leaueth not father &amp; mother, &amp; children, &amp; brethren, and ſiſters; yea and his owne life, in compariſon of him. And this he ſaid was the cauſe, why he did forſake parents, and wife, and children, and all his friends, and had renounced all his wealth and dignities: becauſe hee could not enioy both Chriſt and them. And as for them all, hee was ſorie that either they would not come to him, or that hee might not more ſafely liue with them, thereby to comfort them. But as for himſelfe, hee ſaid, hee had riches, and honour, and ioy enough: yea all ſufficient happineſſe, as long as (with theſe two ſeruants and his little cotage) he might liue in the true Church of God, and might

priuily ſerue him, and might enioy Gods word and ſacraments, not being mixed and defiled with the ſuperſtitious deuiſes of mans braine; and as long as he might liue in the company of godly men; and haue time and liberty to meditate by himſelfe, and to conferre with them of the great bleſſings which in his conuerſion his good God had vouch▪ ſafed to him: that ſo he might with true contentation and perfect peace of conſcience, aime &amp; aſpire at that immortal glory which Chriſt Ieſus hath prepared for al his children: yea he concluded, that his want was abundance, his pouerty pleaſant, and his meane eſtate honourable in his eyes, as long as he indured them for theſe conditions.
            This his anſwere was as hardly entertained of his kinſman, as it was vnlooked for afore it came: but ſeeing he could not reply with any reaſon, nor anſwere him with any ſhew of argument; and perceiued it hard, or rather impoſſible to remoue the man one iot from his reſolution; for that he had grounded it, not on any reaſon or will of man, but vpon the holy word of God, and his powerfull and vnreſiſtable calling; therefore with a ſorrowfull heart hee held his tongue, bitterly complaining within himſelf of his ſo hard hap, and vncomfortable ſucceſſe: and ſo reſolued to returne home againe; heartily wiſhing he had neuer taken that iourney in hand: and ſo at laſt he went indeed and tooke his leaue of his beloued Galeacius, but not without plenty of teares on both ſides, with many a wofull crie and pitifull farewell. And no maruell: for beſides neerenes in blood, their likeneſſe in manners and daily conuerſation together, had linked them in a ſure bond of friendſhippe: but there wanted in one of them the ſureſt linke in that chaine, that is, Religion, and ſo it could not hold: and therefore the world pulling one of them from Chriſt, and Chriſt pulling the other of them from the world: ſo theſe two friends left each other, being in feare neuer to ſee one the other againe.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XV.
            Of his coſens returue to Naples without ſucceſſe, and how Galeacius was proclaimed Traytor for his departure.
            ANd thus at laſt he came home to Naples with heauie cheare. Whoſe approch being hard of, there was running on all ſides to heare good newes: but when he had deliuered his meſſage; alas how all their ſorrow was redoubled vpon them; and how his father, wife, children, and al his friends were ouerwhelmed with griefe: and the rather, becauſe as at the ſame time an edict was publiſhed, wherein Galeacius was proclaimed guilty of high treaſon: and therefore al his goods comming to him by his mother, were confiſcate, and himſelfe, and all his poſterity vtterly cut off and excluded from all right of ſucceſſion in his fathers Marqueſdome; which thing (aboue all other) grieuouſly affected the old Marqueſſe, and grieued the good old man at the very heart; the aduancing and honouring of his poſterity being the onely thing hee had aimed at all his life. Whereupon hee bethought himſelfe as old as he was to make a iourney to Caeſar the Emperour, and thereby if it were poſſible to preuent this miſchiefe; purpoſing to make but this ſute to his Maieſty, that his ſonnes departure from the Roman Church, might not preiudice nor hinder the ſucceſſion and honour of his children and poſterity, but that he himſelfe might onely beare the puniſhment of his owne fault.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XVI.
            Of the ſecond meanes vſed to recall him: his father ſent for him to come and meete him at Verona; but all he could doe by himſelfe or others whom he ſet on, preuailed nothing at all.
            AND whilſt he was reſoluing of this purpoſe, hee bethought him of another remedy and meanes, whereby he hoped to remoue his ſons mind from his purpoſe, and withdraw him from the company of theſe heretikes of Geneua, as hee and the world accounted of them. Therefore in haſt he diſpatched away a meſſenger with letters to his ſonne, commanding him by the authority of a father to meete him at a certaine day appointed at the citie of Verona in the Dominion of the Venetians; at which towne he promiſed to ſtay for him, as he went to wards Germany to the Emperour: and for his ſonnes more ſecuritie, he procured a ſafe conduct from the Duke and Signory of Venice; that his ſonne might goe and come without danger of life or liberty. Galeacius receiuing the letters, and being reſolued by his owne conſcience, and them to whom he imparted the matter, that hee might not any way with good conſcience diſobey ſo reaſonable a requeſt and lawfull a commandement of his father, anſwered that he would goe; although he feared that by this meeting, and talke of his father and him, his fathers minde would but be more vehemently exaſperate againſt him: for he firmely reſolued afore he went, that all the threatnings, intreaties, counſels, and temptations that his father could deuiſe, ſhould not ſtirre him one inch from that courſe of Religion, whereby he had begun to ſerue the Lord. With this purpoſe he departed Geneua, Aprilis 19. 1553. furniſhed with heauenly fortitude, aſſiſted 
                  〈…〉
               aiers of the Church, and armed with conſtancy, and with the ſword of Gods word; whereby he hoped to ſuſtaine and beat backe all the darts of

temptations whereby hee knew hee ſhould be aſſaulted. Comming to Verona, there he found the Marqueſſe his fafather, who receiued and vſed him kindly, though he could not but manifeſt in his countenance the inward anger and griefe ofhis heart. After a few ſalutations, the father began with all his cunning to deale with him about his returne home againe, laying open to the ful that perpetuall in famy, which was ſure to fall on his houſe and poſterity, vnleſſe that Galeacius did preuent ſo great a miſchiefe: which (ſaith he) thou eaſily maieſt doe, and of right oughteſt to doe: and I know thou wilt doe, if there be in thee but one ſparke of naturall affection to father, wife, or children. Galeacius the ſonne with ſuch reuerence as was due to his father, anſwered with all sub
                  •••
               sion that his bodie and eſtate is his fathers, but his conſcience is the Lords: and tels him he can by no meanes returne home, but he ſhould make ſhipwrack of a good conſcience: he proues it to him by good reaſons, and ſuch as his father could not reſiſt; and therefore humblie intreats his father, that ſeeing his deſire is onely to obey the Lord, and ſaue his ſoule; that therefore he would not vrge him to reſpect more the good eſtate of his children, then the glory of God, and his owne ſoules health. The Marqueſſe perceiued he laboured in vaine to remoue his ſonne from his reſolution, which he iudged to be nothing but a peruerſe ſtubbornneſſe againſt the Catholike Religion, as he thought: and therefore with griefe ofminde ceaſed that ſute; and imparted to him the cauſe ofhis iourney to the Emperour; ſtrictly enioyning him that he ſhould not returne to Geneua, but abide in Italy till he had obtained his ſute at the Emperours hand, and was returned out of Germany; which thing Galeacius promiſed and performed: for he a bode in Italy vntill Auguſt: at what time he had notice that his father had preuailed in his ſute bfore the Emperour. During which time, one Hieronymus Fracaſtorius,
               Hieronymus Fracaſtorius. a notable Philoſopher, Phyſition, and Poet (being procured and ſet on by the Marqueſſe) dealt with Galeacius with all his might and eloquence, to perſwade him to yeelde to

his father; adding withall, that that new ſect (as he termed) was falſe and deceitfull, and not worthy to be beleeued. Galeacius heard all he could ſay, and anſwered him point by point: and finally, by the pure ſimplicity of the word of God, he ſo ſatisfied him (though he was both wiſe and learned) that he willingly held his tongue; and at laſt friendly intreated him, that he would not be angrie for that his importunitie and boldneſſe with him.
         
         
            CHAP. XVII.
            Of his returne to Geneua, where he founded and ſetled a forme of diſcipline in the Italian Church.
            THus Galeacius hearing of his fathers ſucceſſe, returned with a ioyfull heart towards Geneua; for that he ſaw his father deliuered from the feare of that infamy, which the confiſcation of his goods, and forfeiture of his lands, might haue brought vpon his family: and therefore he hoped he would be the leſſe moued againſt him. Whereuppon ſetling himſelfe downe againe at Geneua, and deuiſing how to ſpend his time in doing good; he began to conſider ſeriouſly of ſetling the diſcipline in the Church of the Italians, which was then at Geneua (for thither had a great number of Italians tranſported themſelues and their families for Religions ſake, flying the tyranny of the vnholy inquiſition.) And about that time it fell out fitly that Calume going Embaſſadour from Geneua to Baſill in cauſes of Religion and other matters; intreated Galeacius to beare him company: whereunto he willingly condeſcended. At Baſill he found an Italian called Celſas, whoſe right name was Maximilian, and was deſcended of the noble houſe of the Earles of Martinongo in Italy: this man had got a great name in Italy amongſt the Papiſts for his eloquency &amp; ſpeech, and lately by the mercy of God was eſcaped out of the mite of popiſh ſuperſtitions. Galeacius right glad of him, perſwaded him to breake off the purpoſe that he had for England, and goe to

               Geneua with him, where he might liue in the fellowſhip of a great number of his country men Italians, and inioy the benefit of the company, conference and familiarity of many worthy men, but eſpecially the moſt ſweete acquaintance of that great Caluin, and al thoſe, with the liberty of a good conſcience. The good gentleman yeelded, and ſo they comming to Geneua by their induſtry and good meanes (together with the helpe and direction of Caluin in all things) that forme of diſcipline was eſtabliſhed in the Italian Church, which at this day ſtandeth &amp; floriſheth in the ſame church, &amp; remaineth recorded in a book for that purpoſe: &amp; Maximilian the Earle, of whom we ſpake afore, was the firſt Paſtor elect of that church, &amp; vndertooke the charge, purely to expound the word of God, and to adminiſter the Sacraments that Chriſt left behinde him, and to watch ouer that flocke and people: certaine Elders were ioyned as aſſiſtants to him, to whom was committed the care of the Church, to looke to the puritie of doctrine and life in all eſtates; the principall of the Elders was Galeacius himſelfe, vnto whom the honour is due of bringing to paſſe ſo worthy an enterpriſe, and the rather for that by his authority, diligence and watchful care, he preſerued the ſame in good and ſure eſtate all his life time; and after him it hath continued, being deriued to others, to the great good and profit of many ſoules. And thus he paſſed this yere 1554. withioy and comfort.
         
         
            CHAP. XVIII.
            The third temptation to drawe him away: liberty of conſcience offered him by his vncle, Pope Paul the fourth: which after many temptations of fleſh and blood to the contrary, at laſt by the aſsiſtance of Gods grace he refuſed.
            NExt ſucceeded in order the yere 1555. wherein Satan aſſauted him with new ſtratagems and deuices: for

that yere his vncle which was Paulus quartus, his mothers brother, attained the feate of the Papacy of Rome, whereby the Marqueſſe his father conceiued good hope, by this meanes either to draw his ſonne home againe, or at leaſt to procure him liberty of conſcience, and leaue to liue in ſome Citie of Italy, where he might inioy the ſociety of his wife and children, and they of him. Whereupon hauing occaſion of buſineſſe to trauel that way, hee ſent letters to his ſonne to Geneua, commaunding him to meete him at Mantua in Italy, and for his eaſier diſpatch hee ſent him prouiſion of money for the iourney. Galeacius obeying againe his fathers will, tooke his iourney from Geneua, and came to Mantua the fifteenth of Iune, where hee was entertayned by his father with more then ordinarie kindneſſe, and in more louing maner then heretofore was accuſtomed. And at laſt hee opened his minde vnto him, the ſubſtance and effect whereof was: that hee had obtained of his vncle, who now was Pope▪ a diſpenſation for him; whereby liberty was granted him, to liue in any City within the iuristiction of the Venetians, whereſoeuer he would without any moleſtation to be offred him, about his Religion or conſcience. His father tels him that if he doe this, this will bee a greater ſolace to his olde age, then his departure and abſence hath beene griefe vnto him: beſides all this, the good old man moſt earneſtly intreated him (though hee was the father and ſpake to the ſonne) that hee would gratifie him in this his requeſt: and added many beſeechings, who in any lawfull thing might by his authoritie haue commanded him: and euery word that he ſpake was ſo ſeaſoned, as comming from the affection of a father; and at laſt with many ſtrong reaſons perſwaded him, not to reiect this ſo extraordinary a fauor offered him by the Pope in ſo ſpeciall and rare clemency, whereby he might without hurt of his conſcience liue more commodiouſly then euer afore, and be reſtored to his former honour, and place, and eſtate: and recouer the former loue and eſtimation of all his friends: yea and of many

ſtrangers, who hearing of this his obedience to his father, would loue him for it, vnto which obedience to me (ſaith the father to his ſonne) thou art bound both by the bond of nature, and by the law and word of God, which thou ſo much talkeſt of and vrgeſt to me: therefore, ſaith he, if there be in thee either ſparke of naturall affection, or any Religion and conſcience of thy duety, thou wilt yeelde vnto me in this, eſpecially ſeeing thou maiſt doe it without hurt or endangering of thy conſcience and Religion. This talke and requeſt of the Marqueſſe diuerſly affected Galeacius: for the thing he requeſted, and the reaſons he vrged ſeemed to be ſuch, as he could with no good reaſon contradict them; and yet he durſt not preſently entertaine the motion: beſides that, the preſence, authority, and reuerent regard of his father, the vehemency and affection of his mind, and eſpecially the naturall bond and obligation, wherein the ſon ſtands tied to the father in things law full and indifferent (eſpecially when by that obedience no violence is offred to good conſcience) all theſe did greatly moue him. Alſo naturall and carnall reaſon for their parts, aſſaulted him no leſſe violently with ſuch kind of arguments, as for the moſt part preuaile with all men. For his father offred him yearly reuenues, competent and fit for his eſtate, the ſolace of his children, and ſociety of his wife: which two things he deſired aboue all other in the world. So that to this motion and requeſt of his father the Marqueſſe, Galeacius knew not well what to anſwere on the ſudden, but ſtood for a time muſing and doubtfull what to ſay; and the rather, for that he then wanted his ſpeciall friend, faithfull Caluine, with whom he might conſult in ſo waighty a cauſe. It ſeemed to him impious and vngodly, not to yeeld to his father in ſo lawfull and reaſonable a requeſt, and he ſaw no way how he might denie it, but he muſt needes incurre and vndergoe his fathers extreame diſpleaſure: and yet how hee might yeelde to it with ſafety of conſcience he much doubted; for he feared that more danger to his profeſſion and Religion, and conſequently more hurt to his ſoule might

hereupon inſue, then he could preſently perceiue: ſo that he ſtood altogether vnreſolued in his owne reaſon what to doe; therefore in this extremity he denied himſelfe and renounced his owne wit, and in humble and feruent prayer betooke himſelfe in this difficulty to the bleſſing and direction of his God and Sauiour, the author and true fountain of wiſedome and conſtancy: humbly crauing of the Lord to aſſiſt him with his holy ſpirit, that in this extreamity hee might aduiſe and reſolue of the beſt and ſafeſt courſe, for Gods glory and his owne ſound comfort. (O how truely ſung that ſweete ſinger of Iſrael King Dauid, when he ſaid, How happy and bleſſed are they that feare God, for God will teach them the way they ſhould walke!) Galeacius found it moſt true in his owne experience; for vpon this his ſubmiſſion and prayer, the Lord from heauen reſolued him in this ſort: That ſeeing the Pope did (Antichriſt-like) directly oppoſe himſelfe to Chriſt▪ and his Religion and Church; that therefore he might by no meanes ſue for, or accept any fauour at his hands, nor be by any meanes beholden to him at all. Becauſe what ſhew of ſeruice ſoeuer was done to him by the enemy of Chriſt, ſeemed to bee taken from Chriſt himſelfe. Further, Gods ſpirit perſwaded him it caried too great a ſhew of Apoſtaſie, or backſliding; to forſake the company of godly profeſſors, and the fellowſhip of Chriſts Church; and to liue amongſt Idolaters in the midſt of all abominations. The ſame ſpirit of God ſet before his eyes that ſcandall and offence, which this fact of his would breed in the minds of the faithfull▪ which would thinke that he had taken his farewel at Religion, and would now ſhake hands again, &amp; renue his acquaintance with his old friend the world: that he had lightly eſteemed the ſpirituall bleſſings &amp; heauenly iewels of graces, which God diſtributeth daily in his Church; and would now betake himſelf again to the olde affections of his fleſh. The ſame ſpirit reſolued him, that thus to forſake the ordinary meanes, and depriue himſelfe of the true vſe of the word and Sacraments, and to liue in a place where was nothing but Idolatrie,

was to tempt God in the higheſt degree. God likewiſe opened his eyes, that he perceiued the ſleight of Satan by this his fathers d
                  ••
               t: namely, to entangle him againe in the net of worldly cares, to wrappe his mind in the ſnards of Italian pleaſures; and ſo to dazle his eies with the honours, and pleaſures, and ſenſuall delights▪ which once he had bin brought vp in, that his Religion might decay by little and little and that all godlineſſe might by the heat of theſe new pleaſures, fall and melt away like as waxe before the fire: and laſtly, the Lord vpon his prayer granted him the wiſedome of his holy ſpirit, to anſwere al his fathers obiections, and confute all his arguments. And amongſt many other, he earneſtly intreated his father that he would not do that vnto him, which afterward hee would repent that euer hee had done: namely▪ that he would not be a meanes to make him a prey to the Papiſts; which had confirmed for a law, and ratified it by many examples, that promiſe, faith, nor oath is to be kept with any man whom they call heretikes. Whereupon, ſaid he, it is better for me, and more ioy to you, to liue as I doe with this poore eſtate, then with hope of better to endanger my life, and ſo our whole poſterity. By theſe, and ſuch like perſwaſions it pleaſed God ſo to worke vpon the Marqueſſe, that hee was ouercome in this ſute, wherein he ſuppoſed to haue preuailed; and therefore he yeelded againſt his will: and ſo with a ſorrowfull heart he returned to Naples. And as he went, he certified the Pope the obſtinacy of his ſonne, and ſo the father and the vncle bewailed together their ill ſucceſſe.
         
         
            CHAP. XIX.
            Of his acquaintance with Franciſcus Portus, and the Religious Dutches of Ferrara in his returne home to Geneua.
            BVt in the meane time Galeacius after he had accompanied his ſorrowfull father ſomewhat on the way, returned with a full glad heart; and came to the city of Ferrara▪
               
               
where he was ioyfully receiued of Franciſcus Portus, a noble and renowned man for learning, and who afterwards taught publikely at Geneua many yeares, and read the Greeke Lecture with great profit to the audience, and praiſe to himſelfe. This Portus bought Galeacius into acquaintance with the noble Dutches of Ferrara, who entertained him honourably: and after much conferrence had with him of the alteration of his Religion, of the ſucceſſe of his long voyages, and tedious iourneies; of the Church of Geneua, of Caluine, and of many chiefe points of Chriſtian Religion; ſhe diſmiſſed him, and left him to his iourney; but not without all courteſies that ſhe could affoord him: and namely for one, to relieue the length and tediouſnes of the way, ſhe lent him her owne chariot: and thus Galeacius was conueyed in the chariot of ſo great a Princeſſe as far as to the towne of Francolium: from whence hauing a pleaſant tide down the riuer of Po, or Padus, he came by water into Venice: where taking ſhippe and croſſing the ſea, he went thorow Switzerland to Geneua, and thither came the foureteenth of October in the ſame yeare, the whole congregation, and eſpecially his chiefe friends, reioycing with ioy vnſpeakeable, for the ſafety of his returne. And thus this cruell tempeſts thus being ouer-blowen and now quieted, and Satan ſeeing he preuailed not by any of thoſe forcible aſſaults; yet thought to trie him with one more, and therefore came vpon him a freſh, like as a ſecond fitte of an ague ſtronger then the firſt: and by this Satan feared not but to giue him the ouerthrow▪ and to bring him home againe into Italy: and thus it was.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XX.
            The fourth aſſault that Satan vſed to bring him backe againe, was by his wife, who by her letters won him to come and meete her in Italy: which he yeelded vnto, and gaue her meeting.
            HIS wife Victoria burned in long loue and hearty affection toward her husband Galeacius, ſo that it cannot be vttered how vehemently ſhe deſired his company: wherupon ſhee neuer ceaſed writing to him, and intreating him to returne againe to her and his children. But when ſhee ſaw her womanly arguments and vaine ſcribling did no good, at laſt ſhee in all earneſt manner deſired him to meete her in ſome City within the territorie of the Venetians, not farre from the kingdome of Naples. To this motion Galeacius yeelded: and thus the husband and wife promiſed to meet; but the ends that they aymed at were diuers: ſhe hoped by her ſlattery and faire ſpeeches, her teares and lamentations, to winne her husband home againe: on the other ſide he was much more buſie in deuiſing how he might perſwade her to deliuer her ſelfe out of the filth of Popery, and come and dwell with him. With theſe reſolutions they both going forward, ſhee came to Vico, to her father in law the Marqueſſe. He came from Geneua to Laeſina, a citie in Dalmatia. This Laeſina is diſtant from Vicum an hundred Italian miles by water; and ſtandeth iuſt ouer againſt Vicum; and the ſea called the Venetian gulfe lieth betwixt them. Galeacius here abode and expectedSinus Adriaticus. his wife: but at that time ſhe came not as ſhe had promiſed, and he expected. Yet he could neuer learn the cauſe of her ſtaying at that time, nor what it was that moued her ſo to diſappoint him; yet though ſhe came not her ſelfe ſhe ſent two of her eldeſt ſons to their father; whoſe ſight was moſt welcome, &amp; their company moſt cōfortable to Galeacius:
               
but one way it grieued him the more; becauſe the ſight and company of them more affected him with the abſence of his wife; for whoſe ſake and company eſpecially he had taken ſo long a iourney: therefore ſending them ſoone after home againe, he went away ſorowfull to Geneua. Where he had reſted but a few daies, but another packet of letters came poſting from his wife, beſeeching him not to thinke much at her former negligence, and to vouchſafe once againe to come to the ſame place; where, without all faile, ſhe would moſt gladly attend him, and ſolemnly vowed with largeproteſtations ſhe would not diſappoint him. The requeſt was very vnreaſonable, &amp; it was a hard caſe for Galeacius thus to ſpend his time, and wearie his mind and body in ſo long and dangerous iournies, and to ſo little purpoſe as hitherto he had. Notwithſtanding, one thing mooued him to yeelde euen to this motion alſo: namely, a perſwaſion that he had, that when he firſt forſoke his country, he did not fully diſcharge his duety, in labouring to winne his wife to haue gone with him; by explaining to her the chiefe heads of Chriſtian doctrine, whereby ſhe might poſſibly haue receiued ſome taſt, and ſo haue taken ſome liking of true Religion: deſiring therefore now if it were poſſible to make amends for his former negligence, he yeelded to goe. And ſo obtayning for his better ſecurity in going and returning, a paſport or ſafe-conduct from the high Court of Rhoetia; he departed from Geneua the ſeuenth of March, in the yeare 1558. and came to Laeſina in Dolmatia, ouer againſt Vicum: where he had intelligence that the Marqueſſe his father, his wife, his children, and his vncles ſonne (he of whom we heard before) were already come to Vicum, with purpoſe to haue beene by that time at Laeſina with Galeacius; but they could not, by reaſon that a mariner of Venice had broken promiſe with them, and diſappointed them: by reaſon whereof, and of other dangers of the ſea, they could not as yet take ſhipping, nor durſt venture ouer the water. Whereupon Galeacius not induring patiently ſo long delayes, reſolued to goe himſelfe ouer to Vicum. Such was

his faith in the Lord, and his loue to his friends, that hee reſpected not the imminent danger: but conſtantly relied on the Lords protection; knowing that no fleſhly affections droue him to his iourney, but a ſincere zeale to Gods honour, and the ſoules health of his kinred, and the diſcharging of his owne duety vnto them; whereunto he was perſwaded that he had a ſpeciall calling.
         
         
            CHAP. XXI.
            Of his arriuall at Vico, his fathers chiefe houſe, and his entertainment there: and what meanes were vſed to ſeduce him: and how his wife refuſed not onely to goe with him, but euen to lie with him, becauſe he was an heretike: being thereto, as ſhe ſaid, commanded by her Confeſſor.
            AND ſo arriuing by Gods mercy on the coaſt of Italy, not farre from Vicum, he gaue intelligence of his approch to his father the Marqueſſe; who preſently ſent his children to meete their father: and all his retinue to attend him into the caſtle; at whoſe entrance, it cannot be expreſſed how great ioy was in all that houſe and noble familie; and how all the Nobles and Gentlemen of his kinred and acquaintance reioyced at his returne; and beganne to cheere vp their hearts with a new hope which hitherto had beene caſt downe and oppreſſed with griefe and deſpaire. But aboue all other his wife (Madam Victoria) ſurpaſſed in ioy and new conceiued delight; hoping ſhe had now recouered her moſt deere Lord and beloued husband, the only comfort and the ſweete ſolace of her life. All (but Galeacius) exceedingly reioyced at this meeting here; though indeed it greatly ioyed his naturall affection, to enioy the company of his friends, ſo many, ſo neere, and ſo deere vnto him: yet his ioy was tempered and allayed with a certaine doubting feare which ranne in his minde night and day.

for the wiſe Gentleman well foreſaw, that the fruition of that pleaſure was but to laſt a while, and ſoone would haue an end▪ for the end of his comming was not that which they imagined: and euery day new matters ranne in his heads the conſideration whereof did not a little trouble him. Hee hath often ſince diſcourſed vn to his friends, that all thoſe dayes he liued in continuall feare, to be ſuddenly apprehended, and caſt into ſome filthy priſon; where he ſhould ſpend his daies in languiſhing and lamentations, without any ſolace of his friends: yea and be vtterly debarred of the comfortable reading of Gods holy word. But returne to the matter. At his firſt arriuall hee was entertained with much ioy on all ſides, and many cherefull countenances and kind welcomes. But alas, within a few daies all this mirth and ioy was turned into teares and lamentation, and vnmeaſurable griefe: for when once he had opened to his father the Marqueſſe his conſtant purpoſe to perſeuere in the truth of that Religion hee had begunne to profeſſe; and that hee would rather die in the defence of it, then be drawen from it; then alas, what fighing, what crying, yea what dolefull lamentation did it moue in them all! But then let the Chriſtian reader iudge what a troubled ſpirit and wofull heart that good man had in this ſo fearefull a combatte betwixt the grace of God and his naturall affections; and what a torment it was vnto him, to ſee them all ſo neere and deere vnto him, labour to withdraw him from God; and to ſee his conſtancy in Religion ſo to grieue them, which was the ioy of his owne heart. Yet taking vp with himſelfe as well as nature could, and comforting himſelfe in his God, he afterward dealt with his wife in all louing and yet earneſt manner that ſhe would follow him her husband, and delay no longer time, but come and liue with him according as the law of God and nature required: which if ſhe would doe, he promiſed her liberty of her conſcience and Religion, to liue as ſhe would▪ But for his owne part, he told her aforehand, as ſhe ſhould after find; namely, that he was firmlie

eſolued to liue and die in that Religion, which (by the hand of God leading him) hee had vndertaken; and for the which he had forſaken countrey, kinred, and all thoſe excellent and comfortable bleſſings of thus life, which God had giuen him. Here I leaue it to the reader, but eſpecially to the harts of ſuch women, as being wiues, do truely loue their husbands, to iudge with what ſobs and heart-breaking the ſilly Gentlewoman heard theſe words of her husband, whom ſhe now ſaw paſt all hope to be perſwaded to ſtay with her; which ſhe deſired aboue all worldly things. Yet it appears it was but in meere carnal and worldly reſpects, as the conſequent ſhewed: for though ſhe loued him and deſired his company neuer ſo much; yet beeing a wiſe, worldly, wilfull, and indeed a right Papiſt, ſhe anſwered him plainely (though with many teares) that ſhe would neuer go with him to Geneua, nor to any other place, where was any other Religion, but that of Rome; &amp; that ſhe would not liue with him as long as he was intangled with thoſe hereſies (as ſhe called them) wherby it appeares that ſhe was a carnall politike Papiſt. She loued him, but where? in Italy; and there would line with him, but not at Geneua: and why? for in Italy he might aduance her to the ſtate of a Marchioneſſe; in Geneua he could not: there ſhe might liue with him a life ful of al delights; but in Geneua a hard, baſe, &amp; obſcure life, and ſubiect to many outward dangers and miſeries. In which reſpects it was that ſhe was ſo inſtant vpō him to ſtay with her. But the concluſion was, her deſire was to enioy him &amp; Italy both: but rather then ſhe would leaue Italy and the delicacies therof, ſhe choſe plainely to forſake him; &amp; to withdraw the duty of a wife from him. For it may in no caſe be omitted (which afterward hee imparted to ſome his intiereſt and moſt inward friends) that ſhee euen then and there denied him that duetie which a wife is bound to yeeld to her husband by the law of God and nature: that is, ſhe would by no meanes giue him due beneuolence, nor conſent to lie with him as man and wife: and gaue this reaſon; that ſhee was expreſly forbidden of her

Confeſſor, vnder paine of excommunication, becauſe hee was an heretike. Where behold Popiſh Religion what it is, that can ſeparate man and wife for diſparity in Religion; and can diſcharge men and women from thoſe dueties of marriage with which God hath charged them. How this monſtrous vnkindnes and vnwomanly anſwer pierced his heart, let any Chriſtian man iudge, whom God hath honored to be an husband. Yet he ouercame and euen deuoured all theſe tormenting griefes, and beare them with an inuincible conſtancy and quietnes of mind. Yet he purpoſed not to beare ſo great an iniury for cuer, but to redreſſe and helpe it if it were poſſible: and therefore he further proceeded with her, and openly and plainely denounced to her, that vnleſſe ſhe would yeeld him that matrimoniall duety, which by Gods law ſhe ought: namely, to eate, and lie, and liue with him; it would be a cauſe to make him ſue out a diuorce againſt her, and ſo procure a finall ſeparation; which if ſhe were the cauſe of, ſhe might thanke or rather blame her ſelfe, who withdrew her necke from that yoke of duety towards him which marriage required, and which he for his part ſaid, he would neuer haue done to her, though her Religion was ſo farre differing from his. Yet notwithſtanding▪ he ſaid, that ſhe firſt refuſing him, hee had then iuſt cauſe to refuſe her, who had firſt by refuſall of that duety refuſed her ſelfe as it were, and denied her ſelfe to bee his wife. And ſo he concluded with her, that vnleſſe ſhe would be his wife, he would no longer be her husband. This proteſtation no doubt, amazed and troubled her not a little, and vexed the ſilly womans mind; eſpecially for that he was and had alwaies beene ſuch a husband to her, ſo good and kind, and euery way ſo well deſeruing, that ſhe loued him as her owne eyes (therefore more was ſhe to blame, that ſhe eſteemed him not as the light of her eyes:) but though this troubled her ſore, yet it moued her not to her duety; ſo good a ſcholar was ſhe in this Popiſh learning, that ſhe would rather incur her husbands, yea Gods diſpleaſure then her Confeſſors; and rather breake their

commandements ſo holy and iuſt, then his, which was ſo vngodlie, and ſo vnreaſonable: and it alſo leſſe preuayled with her becauſe ſhe imagined he would not ſo doe (though he ſpake ſo) but onely did it to feare her, and ſo in feare hereof to make her yeeld vnto him.
         
         
            CHAP. XXII.
            Seeing he could not reclaime his Ladie, he reſolued to returne to Geneua: and of the greeuous temptations he endured: where he tooke his laſt farewell of his father, wife, children, and friends: and of his heauenly courage, in bearing and paſſing thorow them all.
            WHen therefore the good gentleman ſaw all things ſo farre amiſſe, that euen his wife was againſt him of all other, and gaue him a deeper wound then all other his friends; denying him that ſocietie and fellowſhip which the bond of marriage yeeldeth, &amp; ſeeing that the time paſſed without any good doing, but rather to the increaſing of griefe on all ſides; hee theerfore reſolued to depart, and ſo calling his wife 
                  Ʋictoria againe, he iterated vnto her his former proteſtation; and ſo bad her take it as his laſt warning. The dolefull day of his departing being come, hee held on his purpoſe, and ſo entred into the chamber of his father the Marqueſſe to do his duetie vnto him, and to take his leaue: Who ſeeing his ſon thus paſt al hope of recouery, quenching his fatherly affection in fury and raging madneſſe, like a frantike or deſperate man, reuiled him in moſt diſpitefull termes, and at laſt giues him his farewel with many a heauy and bitter curſe. This ſo ſtrange and extraordinary perſecution, did this good gentleman ſuffer for Chriſts ſake; and it is marueile that it did not cauſe him to looke backe againe, and turne his courſe. But it was Gods doing that his father ſhould vſe theſe extreme and violent curſes,

rather then to goe about to winne him by allurements and gentle perſwaſions: for hee hath often vſed to tell his friends, that this monſtrous inhumanity and vnnaturalnes of his father did rather confirme and ſettle his minde; his nature being rather to be ledde then drawen, and rather to be wonne by friendlineſſe and faire meanes, then to be vrged by extremities. But God would haue his ſeruant to be tried by both meanes: namely, the allurements of his wife and the minacings of his father. Thus God would purge him in the fire of all kind of temptations. And thus by the power of Gods grace hauing paſſed thorow this fire, behold a hotter is to be ventured on. Departing his fathers chamber, with that burden of curſes (which the Lord turned into bleſſings) he came into the great chamber, and ſo into the hall; where he found his wife, his children, his vncles ſonne (afore ſpoken of) diuers noble gentlemen his kinsfolks, and ſome his ancient familiars and domeſtick friends: all fraught with griefe, and making heauy cheere; nothing was heard but ſighes, and ſobbes, and cries; nothing was ſeene but teares and wringing of hands: his wife embracing him, and taking him about the necke, beſeeched him in moſt louing and moſt pitifull maner, that be would haue care of himſelfe, of her, and of all his children, and whole houſe; and not ſo wilfully to caſt them all away. His yong children all vpon their knees, with armes ſtretched ou t, and hands holden vp, and faces ſwolne with teares, cried vnto him to haue pitie on them his owne bowels; and not to make them fatherleſſe before the time. His coſen and other kinſmen with heauie countenances and watrie eyes looked rufully on him; and though for griefe they were not able to ſpeake one word to him; yet euery looke, and euery countenance, and euery geſture was a loud crie, and a ſtrong intreatie, that he would ſtay, and not leaue ſo ancient and noble a houſe in ſuch woſull and deſolate caſe. No words can ſuffice to expreſſe the griefe of that doleful company, nor that lamentable departure that there was to be ſeene. Vnutterable was the griefe on their ſide,

and vnſpeakeable was the torment &amp; temptation which the noble gentleman felt in this agonv, when he muſt either leaue Chriſt Ieſus or leaue all theſe for him. But amongſt &amp; aboue al, there was one moſt lamētable ſight, which would euen haue wrung tears frō a hart of flint. Amongſt al his children he had one daughter, a towardly &amp; goodly yong gentlewoman of xij. yeres old, who crying out amain &amp; wallowing in teares, fell downe, &amp; catching faſt hold about his thighes and knees, held him ſo hard as he could by no means ſhake her off: &amp; the affectiō of a father wroght ſo with him, as he could not offer with violence to hurt her; he labored to be looſe, but ſhe held faſter; he went away, but ſhe trailed after, crying to him not to be ſo cruell to her his childe; who came into the world by him. This ſo wonderfully wrought with his nature, he being a man of a moſt louing &amp; kind affection; that he hath often reported he thought that all his bowels rowled about within him &amp; that his hart would haue burſt preſently, &amp; there inſtantly haue died, his child ſo hauing him faſt about the legs. But notwithſtāding al this, he being armed with a ſupernatural &amp; heauē
               ly fortitude, he brake thorow al theſe tēptations, &amp; treading vnder foot whatſoeuer might hinder him frō Chriſt, he eſcaped out ofthis perillous battell a glorious cōquerer; &amp; ſo leauing that ſorrowful houſe &amp; dolorus cōpany, he came with ſpeed to the ſhore: where preſētly taking ſhipping, he cauſed them to hoiſt vp ſailes towards Laeſina with a turmoiled &amp; diſtreſſed mind, one way ſurcharged with ſorow to remēber the maner of his departure; another way ſurprized with ioy to remēber that he had eſcaped. And euen as a ſhip in a tēpeſtuousſea, the boiſterous waues toſſing it vp &amp; down, is thrown about, ſomtime touching the clouds▪ ſomtime plunged into the depth: So no doubt the noble mind of this yong marqueſſe was no leſſe diſtracted with cotrary cogitations; being as it were in a labyrinth of diſtempered affections: ſometimes he could not but remēber that lamētable eſtate wherin he left his father, wife, &amp; children: he often imagined he was ſtil amongſt thē; he thought he hard them cry &amp; cal vpon him; thought he ſtill felt his litle deere daughter claſping him about the legs &amp; trailing after him; neither could he contain but breake out into tears; neither could he for his life but often looke backe at that princely houſe, with al thoſe goodly orchards, gardēs, granges, fields &amp; teritories: to al which he was the only heire apparēt; yet al which he ſaw he muſt leaue for Chriſt ſake. But one thing pierced his heart

to ſee his wife, and children, and other his alliance ſtanding on the ſhore; who when they could not ſpeake to him, looked at him; and when they could not ſee him ceaſed not to looke after the ſhippe as long as it was in ſight; neither could hee refraine but with a wofull countenance looke at them againe as long as hee could diſcerne them: and withall he called to minde the bitter words and heauy farewell which the Marqueſſe his father gaue him at his departure; all which cogitations running in his head, did doubtleſſe wring from his ſorrowfull heart many a deepe ſigh and heauy grone, and many a bitter teare from his watrie eyes: and yet notwithſtanding all theſe, the ſpirituall ſtrength and courage of his minde was conſtant and inuincible. And euen as a good Pilot in a raging ſea, when clouds and darkeneſſe, thunder and lightnings, ſtorme and tempeſt runne together, and toſſe the ſhippe from waue to waue, as lightly as a ball from hand to hand; yet for all that he ſits ſtill at the helme, with vndanted courage, and markes his compaſſe; and by his courage and skill together keepes on a right and ſtedfaſt courſe thorow all the rage of ſea and weather: euen ſo this our thrice noble Galeacius taking hold of the holy and heauenly anchor; namely, a liuely faith in Chriſt, and a ſtedfaſt hope in God, he ſurmounts the clouds, and fixeth thoſe anchor-holdes in heauen, and looking ſtedfaſtly with a ſpirituall eye, at the true load ſtarre: namely, Chriſt Ieſus and the hope of eternall happineſſe; he directs his courſe towards the ſame with an heroicall ſpirit, and heauenly reſolution thorow the tempeſtuous waues of thoſe fearefull temptations: and the ſhippe that caried his body, did not ſo faſt tranſport him from delicate Italy towards Dalmatia, as the ſhippe of heauenly conſtancy and loue of God withdrew his minde and meditation from all naturall reſpects and worldly delights, and made it mount aloſt in holy contemplation. And thus the preſence and grace of Gods ſpirit, hauing ouercome the power of naturall affections; he began to cheere vp himſelfe after this tempeſt: and firſt of all, bending the

knees of his heart to the eternall father in heauen; hee yeelded his Maieſty moſt hearty thankes, for that he had furniſhed his ſoule with ſuch a portion of his grace, as to withſtand and conquere Satan in ſuch a perillous battell: and for that hee had deliuered him from the danger of Popiſh thraldome, from the inquiſition, and from that perpetuall impriſonment both of conſcience and body which the Popiſh Church would haue brought him vnto, had he not thus eſcaped their hands. Hee likewiſe praiſed God vnfainedly, that he vouchſafed to giue him time, opportunity, and grace to diſcharge that duety to his wife the yong Marchioneſſe, which at his firſt departure he had omitted, and which oftentimes he had with great griefe bewailed, and that he had enabled him to omit nothing which might haue perſwaded her to haue left Sodome, and to haue vndertaken with him this bleſſed pilgrimage towards the heauenly Ieruſalem. The remembrance of theſe things much refreſhed his troubled minde. It alſo much contented and ſatisfied his conſcience, that vpon that monſtrous and vndutifull behauiour of his wife towards him (ſpoken of before) hee had made that proteſtation which hee did: namely, that he would vſe the lawfull meanes to be diuorced from her, who had firſt of al diuorced &amp; cut off her ſelfe from him, by denying that duety of loue, which the wife may not denie to the husband, nor the husband to the wife: he perſwaded himſelfe that this proteſtation would worke well with her, and make her more confirmeable to her duetie, when ſhe had aduiſedly thought of it.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XXIII.
            Of his iourney home againe by Venice, and thorow Rhoetia, Switzerland: and his ſafe arriuall at Geneua: and of the great ioy he brought to the Church by his ſafe returne.
            REuiuing his troubled ſpirits with theſe cogitations, he arriued at Laſina in Dalmatia, which is the countrey ouer againſt Italy; from whence he paſſed in a very quiet paſſage, and calme ſea to Venice: where hee found many faithfull ſeruants of God, and good Chriſtians; who hauing heard afore that he was gone to Vicum, were exceedingly afraid for that imminent and ineuitable danger they ſaw he was in, either to haue his conſcience a ſlaue to Popiſh vanity, or his perſon a priſoner to Popiſh cruelty; therefore they ceaſed not to pray for him night and day: and yet for all that they feared greatly what would become of him. But when now at laſt they ſaw him returne, both ſound in conſcience, and ſafe in perſon; &amp; ſuch a glorious conquerer ouer Satan, and ouer ſo many ſtrong temptations with which the world and naturall affections had aſſailed him: their feare was turned into comfort, their ſorrow into ioy, and they all glorified the Lord for him. And ſo after mutuall comfort giuen and receiued, he departed from Venice, and trauelled thorow Rhoetia and Switzerland; where he viſited the Churches of the Proteſtants, and comforted them greatly with his preſence, and by telling them what great things the Lord had done for him: and ſo by the good hand of his God vpon him, he came in ſafety to Geneua the fourth of October in the yeare 1558. His ſafe arriuall brought exceeding ioy to the whole Church there; but eſpecially to the Italian Congregation: for his long abſence had brought them into ſome ſuſpence and doubt, not of any alteration of his Religion, but of ſome cruell and falſe meaſures to haue beene offred him by the deceitfull

Papiſts. But when they ſaw him ſo ſafely returned, vntoucht in conſcience, and vnhurt in his perſon; and that he had paſſed ſo many pikes of temptations which they knew had beene pitcht againſt him; they gaue great thankes to the Lord for him. But when he had diſcourſt vnto them particularly the whole courſe of the proceedings: firſt, what a ſtrong battry of temptations and aſſaults the diuell and the world had planted againſt him, then how manfully he fought and withſtood, and at laſt ouercame them all; they fell into admiration of ſo rare conſtancy, and thought him worthy of all honour, to whom it is giuen (as the Apoſtle ſaith) to ſuffer ſo much for Chriſt and for Religions ſake: and in all earneſt manner they magnified the ſingular grace and mercy of God towards him, and towards the whole Church in him; which had not ſuffred his ſeruant (this noble Galeacius) to be ſeduced out of the way of that holy calling whereto the Lord had called him: and who had deliuered him from ſo ſubtile a traine, laid by the policy of the enemy Satan, to haue intrapt his ſoule and conſcience, by ouerturning him in the race of his Religion: and they all acknowledged that this noble and godly Gentleman found it verified in himſelfe, which the kingly Prophet ſaith in the Pſalme: Becauſe he hath truſted in me, therefore I will ſet him free: I will be with him in his troubles, I will deliuer him, and crowne him with honour: and in another place, he that truſteth in the Lord ſhall neuer be confounded. And thus the Church receiued a double benefit by him: for firſt, his practiſe was an example vnto them all of a moſt extraordinary and heauenly conſtancy in the loue and profeſſion of true Religion: ſecondly, the mercifull dealing of the Lord with him, was a notable confirmation of their faith, and an encouragement to them to perſeuere and ſtand to the truth, with aſſurance that the Lord himſelfe would ſtand by them.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XXIIII.
            Certaine yeares after his returne to Geueua, he begins to feele in himſelfe a neceſsity of marriage: he deliuers his caſe to Caluin, who refuſed to conſent: the matter is referred to the Churches of Switzerland, and by them he is reſolued that he is free from his firſt wife, and may marry againe.
            AND thus with vnſpeakeable contentment in his owne conſcience, and with publike ioy and thankeſgiuing of the whole Church, he ſetled himſelfe at Geneua in his former priuate and quiet life. Where after a few yeares he began to find in himſelfe ſome reaſons which perſwaded him to thinke it needefull for him to liue in the eſtate of marriage: and therefore hauing thus long waited and expected a more wiſe and duetiful anſwer from his wife; and perceiuing by her not anſwering, that ſhe ſtill perſiſted in that monſtrous and vnnatural wilfulnes, which her blinded Popiſh mind had formerly vndertaken by the perſwaſion of her blind and Popiſh guides; he therefore purpoſed to take ſuch courſe for his remedie, as by the law of God and his Church ſhould in that caſe ſeeme allowable: namely, to be diuorced from her; who for her part had broken the bond and vntied the knot of matrimonie. And firſt of all he imparted his mind and purpoſe to M. Caluine, and craued his godly and wholſome counſel in a caſe of ſo great importance. His counſell was firſt of all, that it was more conuenient and leſſe ſcandalous to the enemies of Religion, if he could abſtaine. But the Gentleman replied, that the caſe was ſo with him, as he could not abſtaine, and gaue him many weighty reaſons which drew him to marriage; and withall participated vnto him ſome ſecret reaſons: for the which he affirmed it was altogether neceſſary

for him to marry. Holy Caluine as he was a man indued from God with ſharpeneſſe of iudgement, and a wiſe and diſcerning ſpirit: ſo he foreſaw plainely that many would ſpeake euill of the fact, others would take offence at it, ſome would plainely condemne it, and ſpeake euill of Religion for it; and the rather becauſe (as he truely ſaid) very few did rightly conceiue the full truth in the doctrine of diuorcement: but feweſt of all would or could know the whole circumſtance of this particular fact. He likewiſe wiſely conſidered that the like preſident was ſeldome ſeene, eſpecially in the Italian Church, whereof this Gentleman was a principall member, and of ſpeciall account, both for his nobility, birth, and deſcent, and for his zealous loue to Religion. All which conſiderations, with diuers other, made reuerend Caluine not too eaſily to ſubſcribe to this purpoſe and motion of Galeacius. Notwithſtanding, when the Gentleman vrged him out of the word of God and good conſcience, with arguments which he ſaw and confeſſed he could not ſufficiently anſwere; therefore leſt he ſhould burden and trouble the conſcience of ſo good a man, which alledged for himſelfe, that he was driuen by neceſſity to that courſe; he yeelded thus farre to him: that if he would repaire vnto the learned and reuerend Diuine Peter Martyr, and aske his opinion, and the opinions of all the learned and chiefe Diuines of Rhoetia, and Switzerland; and deſire them ſeriouſly to conſider of it (as in a matter of ſuch moment, and of ſo great conſequence, it was requiſite) and then ſet downe their iudgements in the matter, and the reaſons mouing them thereunto; he promiſed that he would alſo ſubſcribe vnto them, and moſt willingly yeelde vnto him, what liberty ſoeuer they did allow him: alwaies prouided, that he alſo ſhould ſubmit himſelfe vnto their cenſure, and ſtand to the triall of their iudgements in this caſe. Galeacius moſt willingly yeelded hereunto, as who deſired nothing, but that which the Lord by his word, and by the voyce of his Church, ſhould allow vnto him; and ſo taking the courſe that Caluine had aduiſed him,

he cauſed letters to be drawen and ſent to Zurich, Berue, and other the Churches of Switzerland; opening the whole circumſtance of the matter, and expounding the caſe truely and fully; and humbly craued the iudgement of the Church in a caſe of conſcience ſo great and doubtfull. The chiefe Preachers and moſt learned Diuines yeelded to his honeſt and godly requeſt, and aſſembled about it: the matter was much and long debated, and argued at large on both ſides: and after mature deliberation, and ſufficient conſultation had; it was concluded and agreed on by them all with one conſent̄, that he might with ſafe conſcience, depart from that wife, which had firſt of all on her owne part broken the bond, and diſſolued the marriage knot: and for the proofe of this their opinion, many cauſes and reaſons were alledged and laid downe out of the Scriptures, Fathers, Councels, and out of the Ciuil law, which is the law almoſt ofal countries in Chriſtendome. All which (both their concluſions &amp; their reaſons) were put in writing, and are regiſtred and ſafely recorded; and are kept to this day ready to be ſhewed to whomſoeuer and whenſoeuer neede ſhall ſo require: for it was thought good by the Church ſo to doe; both for that the caſe was extraordinary, and would be ſiniſterly ſpoken of, and cenſured by many; who knew not ſufficiently how it ſtood: and eſpecially for the preuenting of any ſlander or cauill, which the enemies might obiect againſt our Religion.
         
         
            CHAP. XXV.
            By publike ſentence of the Church and iudgement of the law, he is diuorced from his former wife: and after a time he marrieth a French Gentlewoman, a widow of about fortie yeares of age, himſelfe then being about three and fortie.
            
               GAleacius hauing thus laid his foundation▪ proceeded further; but ſtill with the conſent of the Church, and

obſeruing the due forme of Law, and the ordinary courſe of Iuſtice in ſuch caſes, he craued publikely of the Magiſtrate that he might be diuorced, that is, that he might bee pronounced to be free and diſcharged from that wife, who had already cut off her felfe from him. The Magiſtrate conſidering the trueth and circumſtance of the caſe, together with the iudgement of the Diuines, wherunto alſo was agreable the iudgement of the Law, graunted vnto him, as by his aduocates it was required; &amp; ſo in publik Court, and by ſentence definite, and irreuocable he was diuorced, and was pronounced to be free, and diſcharged of his former wife Victoria; and that it was lawful for him and in his choice to liue vnmaried, or to marrie as hee himſelfe would. After which liberty obtained, hee imparted the matter to his friends, and applying himſelfe to thinke of another wife, he asked their aduices in this point alſo. And herein hee tooke that courſe, which generally men in the world take, not; for in his choice he reſpected not ſo much wealth, birth nor beauty, but onely to find a fit companion of his life, and ſuch a one, as with whom he might lead that which remained of his life, in a comfortable contentment, in tranquillity of minde and peace of conſcience; that ſo hee might the more cheerefully ſerue the Lord, and waite for the comming of Ieſus Chriſt. Which courſe of his is more to be noted, eſpecially in ſo great a man, and ſo honorably diſcended; and the rather to croſſe and controle the carnall and worldly courſes, which men for the moſt part and women alſo obſerue in their mariages; reſpecting thoſe things firſt, which ſhould be laſt, and that laſt or not at al which ſhould be firſt and aboue all. Galeacius continuing this his purpoſe, and looking about for his choice, the prouidence of God (which doth neuerfaile his children, eſpecially in ſo great matters) did offer vnto him a fit opportunity. For ſo it was that at the ſame time, a certaine gentlewoman of France, a wido we came from Roan to Geneua, for true religions ſake, which ſhe loued and profeſſed, and for the loue of it left her country, &amp; came thither for liberty of her conſcience. She was a matronelie,

and a graue woman, and well reported of for her modeſty, honeſty, feare of God, and for manifold good qualities: her name was Anna Fremeria, and was about fortie yeares of age. All which circumſtances Galeacius well obſeruing, thought her a fit and conuenient wife for him: and ſo with the conſent and liking of other his good friends, he tooke her to wife, and married her the ſixteenth day of Ianuary, in the yeare 1560. and in the three and fortieth yeare of his age; and they liued together many yeares after with much comfort one of another, &amp; in an excellent agreement, being both of the ſame Religion, and of one mind; alwaies drawing in one yoke, and bearing one burden; diuiding it betwixt them; whether it was ioy or ſorrow: ſo that the vnquietnes of his life paſt, was now recompenced with a life full ofall contentment; and ſo louing her, and being truely loued ofher, they ſpent their daies in all mutuall comfort, ſolacing themſelues in their quiet and priuate life, and ioying in the mutuall faithfulnes and loyalty which one performed to another. Loe thus ſhall the man be bleſſed that feareth the Lord.
         
         
            CHAP. XXVI.
            Of his courſe of life after his marriage: his frugality.
            NOw being married, he laboured to deliuer and disburden himſelfe of worldly cares; and therefore he preſcribed to himſelfe a ſparing and frugall courſe of life; reſoluing to keepe himſelfe within the compaſſe of his reuenue▪ which although it was as much againe as it was afore, by his wiues dowrie: yet by many other hinderances was farre leſſe then heretofore it had beene. And firſt for his houſhold, his care was to haue it little as might be, and thereforeHis ſeruants, but two. for his ſeruice and attendance, he onely kept two maidſeruants: and for himſelfe, he ledde his life in great ſobrietie, and in very meane eſtate, yet alwaies free from ſordid baſenes, and alwaies keeping a ſeemely decorum; neuerHis attire plaine, but comely. wanting any thing that was neceſſary, nor hauing much that was ſuperfluous. His attire was plaine and homely,

but alwaies comely, cleane and handſome: and he that in his owne countrey might haue beene Lord of ſo many tenants, and commander of ſo many ſeruants, did now walke the ſtreets of Geneua alone, often not hauing the attendance of one man: yea he would not diſdain to come himſelfe intoHis humilitie and lowly minde. the market, nor think ſcorn to prouide himſelf of neceſſaries: and ſometime would buy and cary home fruits, herbs, roots, and ſuch other things. And this courſe of life, together with liberty oftrue Religion, he eſteemed greater happines then the Marqueſdome of Vicum. And although by this courſe of life he could ſcarce be diſcerned from an ordinary man, and from the common ſort of people: notwithſtandingEuidences of nobility ſhining in his actions and behauiours. in his countenance appeared that grauity in his geſtures, behauiours, and in his whole body ſhone that comely maieſty; as any wiſe man to haue ſeene him, and well conſidered him, would haue preſently iudged that he came of noble race; and that he had beene fit for the greateſt imployments of the world: which alſo was ſo much the greater, becauſe that with his excellency of birth and perſon, &amp; perfection of all gentlemanly behauiours was ioyned true godlines, &amp; the feare of God; which of it ſelfe is of ſuch force as it is able euen to honour him, who wanteth theſe worldly ornaments and outward perfections. How much therefore did it magnifie him, who had it in ſo great meaſure, and accompanied with ſo many true complements of gentry and honor? By alwhich it came to paſſe that ſo many parts of the chiefeſt excellencies meeting in that one man, made him to ſhine aboue other the members of the Church, euen as the moone amongſt the ſtars. So that the Italian Church, though but little of it ſelfe; yet by the vertues and worthineſſe of this one noble gentleman, ſeemed worthy to be compared with the whole Church of Geneua. And as he was a creditHow greatly he was eſteemed in Geneua. and honour vnto that Church, ſo was he againe moſt honorablie eſteemed of that Church: yea not onely of that Church, but of the whole Church and State of Geneua: for not one Senator nor Magiſtrate of the City, not one of the Preachers &amp; Miniſters of the church was to be found, which

had not alwaies in their mouthes, the commendation of noble Galeacius: yea he was honored and highly eſteemed of bythem all, and it was hard to ſay whether hee was more loued, or admired amongſt them. In a word, he was loued of all men, lookt at of all men, ſpoken of by all men, magnified and extolled, yea wondred at of all men; and though he knew not many himſelfe, yet all men laboured to knowe him. No publike meeting was appointed, no ſolemne feaſt was made, wherto this our Galeacius was not moſt ſolemnly called: yea euery man was deſirous of him, and happy was he that might haue his company: yea they thought their meetings graced, and their houſes honoured with his preſence; and in all aſſemblies the chiefeſt and higheſt roome was offred him: yeawas thruſt vpon him, thoughThey ſtil called him by the title of Marqueſſe. he nothing at all reſpected it. And although he refuſed the name and title of Marqueſſe; becauſe, he ſaid, the Emperour had cut off his ſucceſſion, and depriued him of that honour becauſe of his Religion: notwithſtanding, do what he could, he was called byno other name al his life long, and that not by ſome few his friends and fauorites, but by all ſorts of men, euen ſtrangers themſelues, and ſuch as were not of his Religion. For all men thinking that he had iniury to be depriued of his lawfull ſucceſſion; therfore though they could not giue him the liuing and eſtate, yet they gaue him all they could▪ that is, the name and title. Such were his noble and gentlemanly qualities (beſides his Chriſtian vertues) that they wonne the loue and liking of all men; and cauſed them to honour him far aboue that he deſired orHe was alwaies viſited by ſtrangers, and trauellers, eſpecially Princes and noble men. cared for: yea euery one laboured to ſhew any ſeruice or to performe any duety of loue and kindnes towards him: nay ſtrangers themſelues were deſirous to ſee him, and were drawen into an admiration ofhim: inſomuch as whenſoeuer any of the nobility or Princes of Chriſtendome, eſpecially of Italy, did trauell to ſee forraine nations; and for the moſt part taking Geneua in their way (which place generally all trauellers haue a great deſire to ſee) they would by no meanes omit to ſee and viſit Galeacius. Thus did Francis and

               Alphonſus the yong Dukes of Ferrara, Octauius the Prince of Selerum: and thus did Ferneſius the Duke of Parma, and diuers other: who in their trauell comming by Geneua entertained him in all the complements of courteſie and of honour, no leſſe then if he had beene at Naples in his former glorie; or if he had ſtill beene a courtier in the Emperours Court, as heretofore he had beene. In a word, no Noble man, no Embaſſador, no great ſcholar, no man of note, of any forraine nation came that way, but preſently they vſed meanes to haue a ſight of this noble Marqueſſe; and for the moſt part deſired to haue ſome company and conference with him: So that he was reſorted vnto continually by men of all ſorts; as though he had not beene a priuate man, keeping a meane eſtate and dwelling in a little houſe; but rather as though he had beene a great Prince in the Court, or one neere in place to the Emperour himſelfe. But though all men deſired his acquaintance and company, and he againe was not curious in that point, but courteous toHis company and conuerſation. all as occaſion was offred: yet for the moſt part, his moſt familiar conuerſation was with the men of his owne nation: namely, with his countrimen the Italians, of whom there was a flouriſhing Church at Geneua at the ſame time; and which alſo flouriſhed the better by his meanes, as heretofore hath beene declared. Amongſt whom though he behaued himſelfe, it is doubtfull whether more ciuilly, or more humbly; yet for all that he was honoured of them all, and vſed more like a Lord then a priuate man: which although he in euery reſpect deſerued, yet by no meanes deſired. And ſo beſides all his worthy and excellent parts, his humble minde andHis courteſie and affabilitie. friendly conuerſation made him more honourable. And to ſpeake but truth of him, out of all queſtion hee was not onely a good Chriſtian, but (which is not alwaies ſeene) a perfect and an abſolute man: yea a man can hardly name any of thoſe good parts and amiable qualities; which forHis rare perfections. the moſt part doe winne a man loue in the world; which were not to be found in this noble gentleman. For beſides his noble birth and Princely education, his Religion and

true feare of God; he was alſo humble minded, affable, curteous and friendly to all men: he was wiſe, diſcreete, of goodHis eloquence and ability of ſpeech. conceit, and of an excellent ſpeech and diſcourſe. It would haue delighted a man to haue heard him ſpeake; for as his memory was exceeding good, ſo his naturall eloquence, his ſmooth ſtile, his eaſie, quiet and ſeemely deliuerie, made his ſpeech to be greatly commended of all that heard him. A man would haue wondred to haue ſeene how many, euen of the beſt ſort, would haue laboured to haue bin in his company, and as it were haue catcht vp &amp; eaten his words from his mouth, when it pleaſed him to diſcourſe of ſome of thoſe exploits and aduentures, which had fallen within the compaſſe of his own knowledg: as of the Emperor Charles the fift his voiage into Prouence, and of his warres which he waged in Gelderland, againſt the Duke of Cleeue, and of many other great affaires and ſpecial imployments. Neither was hee onely a fit companion for gentlemen and men ofHis mildneſſe to his inferiors. eſtate, but ſuch was the mildnes of his nature and diſpoſition, that he was alſo kind and courteous to men of lower place, and moſt ofall to the poore, amongſt whom, if they were godly and honeſt he would conuerſe as familiarly, as with his equals, or with men of greater place. He was alſo of a free and liberall hart, no poore or diſtreſſed man did euerHis charity to the poore. require his aſſiſtance, or craue his helpe, but preſently hee would reach vuto them his helping hand, and relieue them by all meanes he could, yea the want of his former wealth and loſſe of his Marqueſdome, did neuer grieue him, but when he had not wherewithall to exerciſe his charitie, towards the poore ſoules of God: it was his ioy and delight to be lending and giuing to thoſe that wanted, and in that reſpect onely he often wiſhed himſelfe as great a man in Geneua as he was in Italy: but to his power and ability his good workes did farre exceed the proude and phariſaical papiſts,His good workes and charitable deedes. who glorie in their workes, and will bee ſaued by them. Priſoners &amp; men in danger did often feele his bountie; hee omitted not to viſite his ſicke brethren, and that moſt diligently: ſuch as were poore hee relieued; yea the

richeſt and learnedſt of all, did thinke themſelues in their ſickneſſes happy to haue him with them; his preſence andHis ordinary exerciſes of Religion, publike and priuate. company, but eſpecially his talke and Chriſtian exhortations were ſo comfortable vnto them. His ordinary exerciſes were theſe; euery day hee repaired to the Church and heard diuine ſeruice, and miſſed not to be preſent at prayers with the congregation, eſpecially he neuer omitted to heare the Sermons and the word preached; which he did alwaies with wonderful deuotion &amp; reuerence to the word of God; for he iudged and eſteemed that the true happines of a man, and the onely ſweete and pleaſant life conſiſted in liuing holily, in walking in Gods waies, in meeting with Satans temptations, in bridling the corruptions of his nature, and in ſeruing God truely and ſincerely without hypocriſie: vnto all which ſteps of happines he thought he could neuer attaine, but by the preaching of the word; wherunto he alſo adioyned a daily courſe of reading the Scripture; thus labouring out of the Scriptures to lay the foundations of his own ſaluatiō, which he applied to the profit and comfort, not ofhimſelfe, alone, but of many others with him.
            Beſides al this, for the loue he beare vnto the Church, and the deſire he had to do al good he could; he tooke vpon himHis particular and perſonall calling. the office of an Elder in the Church: the duety whereof he ſupplied daily, carefully obſeruing and inquiring into the maners and liues of profeſſors; allowing &amp; incouraging the good, and cenſuring the offenders, which he did with great care &amp; conſcience, leſt that ſcandals &amp; offences might ariſeHis courage and iuſtice. in the Church, whereby either the quiet and good eſtate ofthe Church at home might be diſturbed, or the enemie might haue any occaſion to ſlander the profeſſion of Religion. Neither ſtayed he here, but beſide this publike care andHis loue of peace, and continuall ending of contentions, and ſetting men at vnity that were at variance. labour, hee alſo was daily well occupied in more priuate matters: for where euer he ſaw, obſerued, or heard of any diſſenſions, ſutes in law, or controuerſies amongſt Chriſtian neighbours, hee was exceeding carefull to end and compaſſe them; and for that end, as he had a ripe wit and a good conceit and deepe inſight, ſo hee would imploy them all to the finding out the trueth and ſtate of the

cauſe: and hauing found it, hee would vſe all his authority, yea he would make himſelfe beholden to men, on condition they would yeelde one to another, and 
                  〈◊〉
                in peace. In a word, his whole courſe of life ſauoured of grace, and did ſhew him to to be a ſanctified man; yet doubtleſſe he thoght himſelfe borne not for himſelfe, but for God and for the Church; and he thought no time ſo well ſpent, nor any buſines ſo wel diſpatcht, as that wherin, not any priuate gain, or pleaſure to himſelfe was ſought or obtained, but only Gods glory aduanced, his Church edified, religion maintained, and the good worke of Gods grace confirmed in himſelfe and others.
         
         
            CHAP. XXVII.
            Being aged he falleth into a long and languiſhing ſickneſſe.
            ANd thus he liued at Geneua many yeres full of ioy and quietnes, comfort, and contentment: farre from all worldly ambition, and as it were forgetting what he was, &amp; what he was borne to in this world, onely reſpecting what he was to inherite in the world to come; &amp; as he had begun, ſo he continued in a loathing and deteſtation of all popiſh ſuperſtition, and impieties. But with this great quietnes of mind and conſcience there wanted not ſome outward and corporal vexations: for after his long peace, new afflictions &amp; ſtorms came vpon him, wherby the Almighty would yet better trie him, and make his faith, his hope, his patience and perſeuerance to ſhine more gloriouſly; that ſo afterward he might receiue a more excellent reward, and a more glorious crowne. For firſt of all, he fell ſicke of a grieuous, doubtful &amp; dangerous diſeaſe, which had bred vpon him by abundance of rheume, wherby he became ſo ſhort winded that he could hardly draw his breath; by force of ſuch weakenes he was exceedingly tormented night and day: for the good gentleman was conſtrained oftentimes to ſit vp whole nights together

and was faine to be remoued from roome to roome, and from one place to another, to ſee if by any meanes he might take ſome ſleepe, which by the vehemency of this diſeaſe was almoſt quit gone from him. This diſeaſe had growen vpon him by reaſon of his many and long and ſore iournies, which he had taken by ſea and by land for his conſcience ſake: and of the great diſtempers and alterations of the ſtate of his body, which for his ſoules ſake he had vndergone.
         
         
            CHAP. XXVIII.
            A new temptation aſſaults him: a Ieſuite is ſent from his friends in Italy to reclaime him, by offring him great ſummes of money, and to▪make his yonger ſonne a Cardinall: but he valiantly ſcorneth it all, and ſends him backe with ſhame.
            BVt this languiſhing ſickeneſſe did not ſo much afflict his weake and aged body as Satan laboured by another deuice, and a new temptation to trouble and vex his righteous ſoule. For it came to paſſe that about the ſame time, when this diſeaſe had ſeazed vpon him, there came to Geneua out of Italy a nephew of his, the naturall ſonne of his owne ſiſter, with letters to him from his former wife Victoria the Marchioneſſe, as alſo from his eldeſt ſonne the yong Marqueſſe: vnto which letters this yong gentleman being alſo a ſcholar, added many words of his owne to little purpoſe; labouring to perſwade and allure him with much and vaine babling, that now at the laſt he would acknowledge his error, and returne home againe to his owne countrie to his former Religion, and to his ancient inheritance, that goodly Marqueſdome. The principall cauſe both of their writing, and his comming ſo farre was this: becauſe that if he would now at laſt returne againe, hereby he ſaid that out of all doubt he might aduance his yongeſt ſonne Charles, either to the princely State of a Cardinall, or at leaſt to be ſome great Biſhop. For, ſaith he, whereas your ſonne is now admitted into holy orders, and is (for his great

friends and alliance, and for his ſpecial towardlines) in poſſibility of ſo great preferment, your pertinacy and obſtinate peruerſenes, in following and defending a new found and vpſtart Religion; and condemned (as he ſaid) by al the great eſtates of Italy, is the very only hindrance of your ſons preferment. Theſe kind of news how highly they offended the holy and Chriſtian ſoule of this thrice noble Galeasius, who from his hart abhorred, and in his ſoule deteſted thoſe vaine and vngodly and prophane dignities in the popiſh Church; I leaue it to be iudged by the Chriſtian reader. And therfore hauing with much griefe of mind hard thus much of this vnſauory and vnpleaſant meſſage, and not ablelonger to forbeare, lie firſt of all tooke the letters, and before his face that brought them, threw them into the fire; and then briefly, but grauely, wiſely, and zealouſly hee ſhaped him his anſwere by word of mouth: thinking ſo badde and baſe a meſſage vnworthie the time and labour of writing. And firſt of all hee tolde him, that there could not haue come to him more heauie and vnwelcome newes of his ſonne then theſe; that hee was ſo blind a Papiſt, that for the hope of this worldly aduancement he would venture the ruine and ſubuerſion of his ſoule. And bad him tell his ſonne that he would hinder him in that vngodly courſe by all meanes he could: and hee ſaid, hee knew not whether it more grieued him to ſee the vanity of his ſons proceeding, then it reioyced him that it lay in his power any waies to hinder him in the ſame: Yea, ſaith he, know thou, and let that my ſeduced ſonne know, that you could haue vſed ſcarce any argument vnto me ſo forcible to make me perſiſt in my Religion, and to deteſt Popery, as this; that in ſo doing I may hinder my ſonne from the abominable dignities of the Popiſh Church: and therefore, ſaith he, returne my ſon this anſwere; that in ſtead of helping him to theſe preferments, I will pray for euer to the Lord for him, who is the father of his ſoule and mine, that he would open his eyes to ſee the truth, and that he may haue grace after the example of me his father to ſee the horribleſuperſtitious

idolatries &amp; impieties of Popery, &amp; ſeeing thē to abhor &amp; deteſt them: &amp; renouncing the vanities of al worldly pomp and honor, to direct his foote ſteps to the Lord, and embrace his holytruth, and yeeld his ſoule and conſcience obedient to the heauenly calling, and ſo become the ſeruant and childe of the moſt high God: whereby he may aſpire and attaine to the true and higheſt dignity; which is to enioy the fauour and comfortable preſence of God, &amp; his holy grace; to loue God, and to be loued of him; and ſo at laſt to be aduanced to that heauenly and eternalglory which is prepared for them who in this world do forſake themſelues and their owne deſires, that they may in true holines ſerue the Lord. With theſe and ſuch like holy ſpeeches he anſwered the diſholy and diſhoneſt demand of this carnall Papiſt. But for all that this importunate and vnreaſonable Ieſuite (for he was of that ſect) ceaſed not to be troubleſome to this noble and holy Gentleman▪ ſtill vrging him with fond and friuolous reaſons, and preſſing him with rediculous arguments: as this eſpecially for one; he promiſed him a huge ſum of money, if he would returne home: which, ſaith he, lies ready at Lions for you, and the Brokers and Exchangers there are prepared to pay it. And he further aſſured him, that if he would come againe into Italy, they had procured him liberty of his conſcience and Religion at Turing: and there alſo (he ſaid) he ſhould find a great ſumme of money ready for him. But when this importunatefellow preſumed to preſſe the good conſcience of this reſolute Gentleman with ſuch baſe arguments▪ and began to weigh Religion in a paire of gold weights; then the noble heart of this holy Chriſtian could not but ſhew it ſelfe mooued, and therefore in a holy zeale and an ardent loue of his Sauior Chriſt Ieſus, he cryed out, Let their money periſh with thē who eſteeme al the gold in the worldworth one daies ſociety with Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; his holy ſpirit: &amp; curſed, ſaith he, be that religion for euer, which ſhal wed men to the world, &amp; diuorce them from God. Go home therfore, ſaith noble Galeacius, take away thy ſiluer again, &amp; make much of that droſſe of the earth, together with your dregs of popery, lock thē vp together in the cheſt

               And as for me, know it, that my Lord &amp; Sauior Chriſt, hath made me enamored of far more precious iewels and durable riches. But the heauenly conſtancy of this holy man, droue this frantike papiſt from his bias, into an extreme choller, for he according to the nature of his Popes holy religion thought that when all arguments had failed, yet money would haue wonne him, and therfore ſeeing him ſo highly to ſcorne, and ſo diſdainfully to contemne ſo great offers, hee thought it very ſtrange; and therefore ſeeing all his labor loſt, and his beſt hold proue ſo weake, he fell from mony to meere madnes; and forgetting himſelfe, and his duty, brake out into ill words, and reproohfull termes: But when the Magiſtrate was informed of it, and ſaw that this arrogant papiſt durſt ſo far abuſe the patience of ſo honorable a man, therfore by their authority, they forbad him the Citie (as the manner of that place is in ſuch cafes) and ſo this newes bringer had his paſport to be packing, and to go home and count his siluer; and there to bragge of his good ſucceſſe; for he now could ſay by good experience, that ſo much money as was enough to lead an hundred popiſh friers to and fro whither a man would, like Beares by the noſe, could not touch the conſcience of one proteſtant, much leſſe make him a papiſt.
         
         
            CHAP. XXIX.
            Being deliuered from the importunitie of the Ieſuit: not long after, came a Monke, nimble witted and learned, a kinſman of his owne, who had a ſtrong conceit that he could haue reclaimed him: but he came too late, the Marqueſſe being dead before he came.
            AND thus it pleaſed God to deliuer this ſick gentleman from this troubleſome tempter, and this meſſenger of Satan which came to haue buffeted him; but he buffeted, yea and vanquiſhed him, &amp; Satan in him; and he might report at home, that he found the Marqueſſe ſicke in bodie, but whole in mind, yea that he neuer ſaw in all his life ſo reſolute a conſcience, and ſo couragious a mind in ſo weake a body. And

thus the Lord doubtleſſe did in mercy to him; that being from this diſquiet companion▪ he might with more comfort and leſſe griefe, beare the burden of his ſickenes, which now grew vpon him more and more, and left him not till it made him leaue the world, and till it had tranſlated him from this his pilgrimage, to his eternall reſt; and till it had made him of a poore Marqueſſe vpon earth, a glorious King in heauen. Whoſe death as it was wonderfully lamented of the whole Church for the vnrecouerable loſſe they had of him: ſo it was a merciful bleſſing, and a welcome meſſenger of God to him: for it freed and deliuered him from many ſtormes of new temptations which the Diuell was raiſing againſt him; for within a ſhort time after his death, there came to Geneua a certaine Monke, a good ſcholar, a gentleman by birth▪ and neere a kin to Galeacius; who being puft vp with Monkiſh pride, and a conceit of his owne ability for ſuch an enterpriſe, thought ſo farre to haue preuailed with Galeacius by his nimble wit and eloquent tongue, as to haue perſwaded him now at the laſt, either to haue relinquiſhed his Religion, or at leaſt to haue left Geneua and to haue returned into Italy (where his vncle had beene lately Pope) that ſo by his preſence and countenance, and the helpe of his great friends (which he had both in the Popes and the Emperours Court) his children might be in more poſſibility of thoſe high dignities and great places in the world, which they and their other friends aimed at: and for the attainment whereof, nothing ſo much hindred them as their fathers Religion, and courſe of life. But he returned home a proud foole as he came, and aſhamed of his proud and inſolent ſpirit; which perſwaded him by his vaine babling he could haue ouercome him whom he found when he came to Geneua to haue ouercome the world, and all ſpirituall enemies, and now to be triumphing in the glory of heauen. And ſo leauing him and all other his Popiſh carnall kinred, gnaſhing their teeth for anger to ſee his admirable conſtancy; let vs returne againe to our ſicke gentleman, whoſe end now haſting on, will alſo haſten an end of this ſtrange ſtory.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XXX.
            His long and languiſhing ſickenes grew and increaſed vpon him in ſuch meaſure, as his paine was moſt grieuous; but hee bare it all with an heroicall and heauenly courage: ſo that it might manifeſtly appeare that euen the Lord from heauen did lend him ſtrength; and as the torments and pangs of the diſeaſe increaſed, ſo hisfaith and patience and all heauenly vertues ſhone in him more and more: ſo that it was moſt true of him which the Apoſtle ſaith, as the outward man periſhed ſo the inward man was renued daily. His body pined away, buthis minde and ſoule grew from ſtrength to ſtrength: and as a by-ſtander feeles not the paines of him that is tormented or racked before his eyes: ſo his ſoule and mind ſtood as it were a farre off, beholding the paines and vexations of the body; and being vntoucht it ſelfe, did as it were laugh at Satan, ſinne, death, and damnation; who by all their ioynt power could doe no more, but onely to vex and racke this poore carcaſe with bodily diſeaſe, but were not able to touch the ſoule, to vexe the minde, or wound the conſcience. If any man aske the reaſon why his mind and conſeience were ſo quiet in this ſo great torment of the body: the reaſon was▪ for that his mind was imployed in holy meditations, as of the ſingular loue of God his father vnto him in Chriſt Ieſus; whereby he aſſured himſelfe vndoubtedly of ſaluation, of the manifold holy graces, wherewith God had adorned him: by the force whereof, he ſaid, he had borne off ſo many buffets of Satan, had paſſed ſo many pikes of troubles, and come away conquerer in ſo many fearefull fights, as had oppoſed themſelues againſt him in his conuerſion. Theſe gifts and graces of God he weighed with the croſſes of his ſicknes, and found them far heauier; and he compared theſe momentany and light afflictions, with that exceeding and eternall weight of glory, which, he ſaid, he knew was laid vp for him in heauen. Theſe and ſuch like meditations cheered vp his ſpirit more then the force of his ſickenes could appall him.
            But aboue al things he felt vnſpeakable comfort and ſweetnes

in his prayers to the Lord; which he 
                  〈◊◊◊〉
                feruently, and with a zealous and faithfull heart. 
                  〈◊◊〉
                often ſay, that in the midſt of his prayers, his ſoule ſeemed to him to be euen rauiſhed out of himſelf, and to taſte of the bleſſed ioyes of heauen. So that the ſaying of the bleſſed Apoſtle was verified in him, As the ſuffrings of Chriſt abounded in us, ſo conſolation by Chriſt abounded much more. In his ſickenes he wanted no helpe of the Phyſitions, for they came to him out of all parts of the citie: and willingly did they all do their diligence about his body; whoſe ſoule they knew had Chriſt Ieſus to be the Phyſition for it. His friends alſo continually viſited him, who were of the chiefe men in the citie; and they were all welcome to him rich and poore: and it is hard to ſay whether he receiued more comfort by them, or they more ſpirituall edification by him; his ſpeeches and behauiours were ſo full of patience, and ſo well ſeaſoned with all grace. All his friends performed to him what duety ſoeuer was in their power, but eſpecially his worthy wife did then ſhew her ſelfe moſt louing and loyall, for ſhe was neuer from about him, and ſaw that he wanted nothing which the world could yeelde for the recouery of his health. But all was in vaine, for the time of his diſſolution was at hand, and he had runne the royall race of a moſt holy Chriſtian life; and now nothing remained but a bleſſed death. He might ſay as the Apoſtle did with much ioy of heart: I haue run my race, I haue finiſhed my courſe, I haue kept the faith: from henceforth is laid vp for me a crown of righteouſnes, which Chriſt the righteous Iudge will giue to me, and to all ſuch as wait for his appearing.
            
            After few daies the violence of his ſickenes was ſuch, as it ouercame all power of phyſicke; ſo that it was manifeſt, that that bleſſed houre approched, wherin the Lord had appointed to accompliſh his owne good worke in him; therefore he ſequeſtred himſelf altogether from any more care of his body, and from al worldly cogitations; he renounced the world and all in it; he tooke his farewell of his wife, and all his Chriſtian friends, and ſaid, hee ſhould lead them the way to heauen. Hee fixed all his thoughts vpon his ſoule, and

               
                  〈◊◊〉
               ixed on the Lord in heauen: and cried to 
                  〈◊◊〉
               hat as he had ſought him al his life, ſo he would 
                  ••
                him, and acknowledge him for his owne. And thus as all his friends ſat about him, and as the Preachers and Miniſters were occupied in holy praiers and reading of the Scriptures, and applying to him the heauenly conſolations of God▪ word, in the performance of theſe exerciſes he ended his dales, wherein hee had taken▪ delight all his life long: and as hee reioyced to haue them in this life, ſo it pleaſed the Lord that he ſhould haue them at his death. And ſo in the midſt of all his friends, in the preſence of the Miniſters, euen in the fight of them all, he peaceablie and quietly yeelded vp his ſpirit, and rendred his ſoule into the hands of his mercifull God and faithfull Creator, of whom he had receiued it; who immediatly by the miniſtery of his holy Angels receiuing it at his hands, and waſhing it pure in the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, crowned it with the crown of eternal &amp; heauenly happines. And thus this holy man was tranſlated from a noble man on earth, to be a noble Saint in heauen: and of a Marqueſſe on earth in bare name and title, he was aduanced to be a glorious &amp; triumphing King in heauen: where he now raignes in glory with that God whom he ſo faithfully ſerued on earth. That God and mereifull father grant that all we that reade this admirable ſtory, may be allured to take vpon vs the ſame moſt holy profeſſion, that this thrice noble Marqueſſe did; and may renounce and caſt off what euer in this world we ſee doth hinder vs from the holy fellowſhippe of Chriſt Ieſus; and ſtrengthen vs that we may be faithful to the end: that ſo we may obtaine the crowne of life in that glory, where this noble Galeacius and all the heauenly hoſt of Gods Saints do wait for vs. Amen. This was his life, this was his end: let thy life be like his, and thy heart walke in the ſame way▪ then ſhall thy ſoule die his death, and thy latter end ſhall be like his.
            
               O Lord how glorious art thou in thy Saints!
            
            FINIS.
