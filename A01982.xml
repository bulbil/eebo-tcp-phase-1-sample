            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

in memory. They way eaſily be

amplified by any that hath anie

            Morning Praier for
a Familie.
            
               O Eternall God, wee thy
poore ſeruants acknowledge
that from thee wee firſt receiued
our being, and euery good
thing we inioy▪ and that by thee
the ſame is continued and preſerued
vnto vs, by thy good prouidence
is this day renewed vnto
vs, and wee kept ſafe vnto it:
wherefore, deſirous to performe
our dutie vnto thee, and
to receiue a bleſſing from thee,
(without which we cannot proſper
in any thing that we take in
hand) we doe humble our ſelues
before the glorious throne of thy
grace, to offer vp vnto thee our
morning ſacrifice of prayer. We
know that our ſinnes haue made
vs odious in thy ſight, vnworthy
of all thy bleſſings, and lyable
to al the iudgements denounced

in thy Word: they are for
number innumerable, for wee
haue committed more ſinnes
then we haue liued moments; all
our thoughts, words, and actions
haue beene ſinfull, euen the
beſt things which we doe are defiled
with that ſinck of naturall
corruption which is in vs, and by
our careleſſe manner of performing
them. Euery ſinne is in
the nature of it infinitely heinous,
becauſe it is committed
againſt thee, a God of infinite
Maieſtie: but our ſinnes
are ſo much the more heinous,
becauſe they haue been committed
againſt our knowledge and
conſcience, yea and againſt thoſe
manifold meanes, which thou in
mercie haſt affoorded to kéepe vs
from ſinne: we haue long inioied
the Miniſtrie of thy Word, but
haue little profited thereby: thou
haſt accompanied the ſame with
many ſweet bleſſings, all which

wee haue abuſed: like a carefull
Father thou haſt tenderly
corrected vs; yet wee haue
not been bettered thereby, but
carried our ſelues ſtubbornely againſt
thee. We are very prone
to yeeld to all the corrupt ſuggeſtions
of our fleſh, and to the euill
temptations of the Diuell: and
wee are too much delighted with
the wicked cuſtomes and faſhions
of this world: but exceeding
dull and vntoward wee are to all
holie exerciſes, and to euerie good
thing. When we enter into an
examination of our ſpirituall eſtate,
wee can finde in our ſelues
nothing but matter of horror,
and of deſpaire: wee doe therefore,
as we haue iuſt cauſe, vtterly
denie our ſelues, and renounce
all confidence in our ſelues, we
flie to thy mercie-ſeate for mercie
and pardon, and that in the
name of thy deare ſonne Chriſt
Ieſus, who came to ſaue ſinners,

and who by the ſacrifice of himſelfe
hath made a perfect ſatiſfaction
vnto thine infinite iuſtice
for all our ſins Enter not therefore
into iudgement with thy
ſeruants (O Lord) but accept of
that alſufficiēt ſacrifice of Chriſt
for vs; and be pleaſed wee moſt
humbly beſeech thee, to remoue
the guilt and puniſhment of all
our ſinnes, that they may neuer
riſe vp in iudgement againſt vs,
to depriue vs of thy fauour and
bleſſing, or to prouoke thy wrath
and vengeance againſt vs in this
world or in the world to come.
And we doe alſo earneſtly intreat
thee for Chriſts ſake to ſubdue in
vs all our corruptions, that they
may not beare ſuch ſway in vs
as they haue done heretofore:
make vs wiſe and watchfull ouer
our ſelues, that wee may auoide
as all ſinnes, ſo all occaſions
and prouocations, whereby
we may be lead into euill: and

make vs conſcionable in practiſing
all good duties which wee
are bound to doe, and in vſing
all good meanes whereby wee
may be kept in compaſſe of our
dutie. O Lord let thy good ſpirit
alwaies abide in vs, to aſſure
vs of thy loue to vs, and to renew
vs daily more and more according
to thine owne moſt glorious
image. Wee beſéech thee
to inlighten our dark vnderſtandings,
to rectifie our peruerſe
wils, to mollifie our hard hearts,
to quicken our dul affections, and
to reform all our outward parts,
ſo as wee may ſerue thee in true
holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all
the daies of our life.
            Make vs iuſt, faithfull, and
true in al our actious and words:
make vs pitifull and mercifull to
ſuch as ſtand in need of our help,
and that according to their neceſſitie
&amp; our abilitie: and grant
that by our humble, modeſt, gentle

carriage of our ſelues towards
all men, wee may adorne
out Chriſtian profeſſion.
            And now, heauenly Father,
we commend our ſelues, ſoules,
and bodies to thy bleſſing. Bleſſe
vs we beſeech thée in our callings,
direct thou the worke of our
hands, and proſper them vnto
vs. Sanctifie alſo all thy good
creatures which thou affourdeſt
vnto our vſe.
            We humbly beſeeth thee to
bleſſe alſo thy whole Church:
and particularly the whole Nation
wherein we liue: continue
in it the light of thy Goſpell, and
giue a free paſſage thereunto.
Vouchſafe vnto it all needefull
proſperity. Wee heartily pray
thee to bleſſe our royall Soueraigne
King Iames and his gouernement:
long preſerue his
life, &amp; health, and raigne. Bleſſe
all our Magiſtrates and Miniſters
of thy holy word. Succour
all the aflicted members of Chriſt

Ieſus. Doe good to all our kindred,
aliance, friends, acquaintance,
neighbours. Linke all of
vs together by the bond of thy
holy ſpirit, who are knit by any
outward bond; that thus wee
may haue iuſt cauſe to reioyce
one in another, and to bleſſe
thée one for another. Let thy
bleſſing remaine on all Chriſtian
families which call vpon thy
name, and particularly vpon this
our familie: grant that we may
make our houſe to be thy Church
by performing an holy worſhip
vnto thee, that ſo thy gratious
preſence may bee euer among
vs: and becauſe thy promiſes
do belong to vs, and our children,
we pray thée to bleſſe our iſſue
with all néedefull bleſſings.
Work in vs a religious care wel
to traine them vp, and giue thou
a bleſſing to all the meanes that
are vſed for their good education,
that they being taught by vs
to feare thée, may teach their children

alſo ſo to doe, and thus thy
feare bee continued among our
poſterity from generation to generation.
O Lord our God, we
know that the good things wee
want, and the dangers whereunto
we are ſubiect, are many more
then wee can thinke of, yet are
they all well knowne vnto thee;
wee doe therefore intreate thee
to beſtow vpon vs what good
things ſoeuer thou ſeeſt to bee
needfull vnto vs, and to preſerue
vs from al thoſe euils which thou
ſeeſt vs ſubiect vnto.
            According to our bounden dutie
we doe alſo offer vp our ſacrifice
of praiſe vnto thy diuine
Maieſty, in the mediation of
Chriſt: bleſſing thee firſt of all,
and aboue all, for thoſe bleſſings
which are proper to thine elect: as
are our redemption by Chriſt,
our reconciliation with thée, our
adoption to be thy children, our
iuſtification &amp; ſanctification, and
hope of eternall life, together

with all the good graces which
by thy good Spirit thou haſt
wrought in vs. We thank thée
alſo for all the meanes of our ſaluation,
and for all the meanes of
preſeruing our temporall life. In
particular, we thanke thee for the
laſt nights quiet reſt, and for
bringing vs ſafely to the beginning
of this day. Neither are we
vnmindefull of thy generall bleſſings
vpon thy whole Church,
vpon this Land and Kingdome,
vpon our houſe and familie, and
vpon all that any way belong
vnto vs. We acknowledge thée
(O Lord) to bee the Author and
giuer of all things; &amp; accordingly
we giue the praiſe of al vnto thée.
            Accept (we beſeech thee) this
our bounden dutie, pardon all
the defects &amp; imperfections thereof,
for thy Sonne, and our Sauiour
Ieſus Chriſts ſake: in whoſe
name we conclude our praiers
with that perfect forme of praier
which he hath taught vs, ſaying▪

            Euening Prayer for
a Familie.
            MErcifull Father, Lord of
heauen &amp; earth, by thy good
prouidence haue wee been ſafely
kept this day, and all the daies of
our life heretofore. Many are the
bleſſings which thorowout the
whole courſe of our life wee haue
receiued from thée. It hath pleaſed
thee to affoord vs ſufficient
meanes for the preſeruation of
our life, health, and eſtate in this
world, and alſo to bring vs to eternall
life: we praiſe thy holy
name for them all: And now being
about to goe to our reſt for
this night, we cōmend ourſelues,
ſoules, bodies, goods, and all that
belong to vs, to thy ſafe keeping.
O Lord accept vs in thy beloued
ſonne, and be reconciled vnto vs,
pardon we beſéech thée al the ſins
which this day, or at any time
heretofore wee haue committed

againſt thée: grant that we may
put off the old man with all the
corrupt luſts therof, and that the
néerer we approach vnto our diſſolution,
and the glorious appearing
of Chriſt vnto iudgement,
the better we may bee prepared
thereunto. For this end (we moſt
humbly and earneſtly pray thee)
our knowledge of thy holy will,
ſtrengthen our faith in thy gratious
promiſes, eſtabliſh our hope
of eternall life, work in our harts
ſuch a ſweete ſence of thy loue to
vs, as thereby we may be prouoked
to loue thee againe; and in
and for thée to loue our brethren,
yea euen our enemies. Giue vs
grace daily to renew our repentance,
and to bring forth fruits
meet for repentance. Continue
in vs a true feare of thy great
name, which may kéepe vs from
ſinning againſt thee; and an holy
zeale of thy glory, which may ſtir
vs vp to honour thee. Seaſon
all other graces with honeſty,

and ſincerity of heart, wherwith
thou (O Lord, the ſearcher of
hearts) art much delighted. So
frame the diſpoſitiō of our minds
and hearts, as wee may wholly
reſigne our ſelues to thy guiding
prouidence, and remaine
contented in our ſeuerall places,
patient vnder all croſſes, thankfull
for al bleſſings, and conſtant
in our Chriſtian courſe, till wee
come to receiue the Crowne of
glory, promiſed by thy diuine
Maieſty to all that ouercome.
In particular, we beſéech thée to
bleſſe vs this night, and to take
vs into thy ſafe protection. O our
God, who neither ſlumbereſt, nor
ſleepeſt, watch ouer vs whether
wee wake or ſleepe. Kéep vs, and
all that belong vnto vs ſafe from
all dangers: eſpecially kéepe our
perſons ſafe from all the aſſaults
of Sathan, that hee get no aduantage
againſt vs. Giue vs,
we pray thee, ſuch quiet and moderate
reſt, as our bodies may

be refreſhed thereby, and we the
better inabled to doe that worke
which thou appointeſt vnto vs
in our ſeuerall places. O Lord
heare and grant vnto vs al néedfull
good things for Chriſt Ieſus
ſake. In whoſe name and
words we further cal vpon
thée, ſaying, Our Father
which art in
heauen,
&amp;c.
            
            FINIS.
