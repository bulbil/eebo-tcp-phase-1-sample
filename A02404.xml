            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               DEclare and make knovvne for vs, and our Succeſſours, aſwell vnto our Kingdoms Duke domes and Principalities, as to euery one whom this may Concerne. That wee Guſtavus Adolphus King of Swethland haue out of compaſſion taken to heart, the vn heard of grevous Oppreſſion and miſerable diſtreſſe into which the preſent Duke of Statine and Pomer is faine, and which he hath ſuffred in body, country &amp; people thoſe three

yeeres laſt paſt, whereby wee are not only, moved &amp; bound therevnto, in regard of conſanguinitie, fidelitie, and amitie, but alſo by reaſon of that eſpeciall faithfulnes, which time out of minde hath bin found, betweene the Crowne of Swethen and the Pomeriſh Countries &amp; inhabitants by a ſetled Commerce, which hetherto hath bin continually kept and mainteyned betwixt them: as alſo when wee call to mind the dèepe Obligations, Contracts, Alliances, and Treaties, made by our pious Predeceſſors, betweene the Crowne of Swethland, and the Duke of Pomer his Lands States &amp; Territories, concluded at Old Statin Anno 1570. Having taken alſo into our conſideration how greatly wee are interreſſed in the keeping and poſſeſſion of the Baltike ſea, how and in what manner to our great preiudice the pomeriſh countries (the cauſe af all theis troubles) are not onely poſſeſſed: But alſo all free tradeing expulſed, and dryven out of them to annoy vs and our Kingdoms, vſing our name as a pretext to this horrible oppreſſion. All which being duly wayed, (thongh not by the inſtigation of the Duke of Pomer and his Countries) it concerns vs moſt neerly not to abandon and forſake theis Dukedomes and lands of Pomer, to th'end, that the love &amp; Neutralitie, which they haue ſhowne to vs may be ſetled vpon a ſute foundation. And that by the help of God, by our power and aſſiſtance, wee may cleere his innocency, and deliver them from this vniuſt violence, and oppreſſion, and out of their manifold adverſities and intolerable compulſions, committed againſt all humaine lawes and rights. And by our means, to vindicate their vnproclamed vndeſerved, and vnlooked for hoſtile attempts and ſurpriſalls. The cauſe which made vs arrive here in Pomerland which a reaſonable Armie, hauing by Gods aſſiſtance not oonely taken in the principalitie of Rugen, and have made ſuch a progreſſe into it, that almoſt without any blowes or

reſiſtance, wee haue turned out thoſe, who gaue themſelves out for the defendors of the Land: but alſo haue poſſeſſed the Ilands, Townes Ports, and forts which lay as a Bulwark before the cheefe Cittie of Pomer, and though againſt the Duke of Pomers will, tooke occaſion to beſeige the Cittie of Statin, and to make our ſelves Maſter thereof.
            
               And for our Parte wee Bogis Laus Dukes of Pomer and Statin, call to minde theſe Agrevances.
               1. That wee were left deſolate, and Comfortles without the help and aſſiſtance of any man.
               2. That wee were not ſtrong enough to reſiſt the great power, which was brought againſt vs.
               3. That our ſubiects of the Land, and thoſe which ſhould haue holpe to defend it, were diſarmed.
               4. All ability which was yet remaining, was taken from vs, and wee drawne ſo dry, that wee ſcarely had any meanes for the ſuſtenāce of life, much leſſe to make any defēcefor vs.
               5. After theſe three yeares oppreſſion, in which wee were ſo vnchriſtianlike intreated, our people had a greater deſire to deliver themſelves, and theirs out of it then to plung themſelves deeper into it, with the loſſe of life and goods.
               6. Eſpecially, ſeing they could promiſe themſelves noe hope of helpe and comfort, but found rather that all which was aſſured them by ſo manifold Capitulations, and which was ſigned vnto and promyſed them ſo holily, little or nothing heitherto was kept and obſerved.
               7. For the helping whereof his Royall Ma. was forced to betake himſelf to theſe Chriſtian meanes.
               8. Though his Ma. is loath to meddle which his Imperiall Maieſtie, and the Empire.
               9. But onely to reſtraine the inſolencie of the deſtroyers of this Land (to our great preiudice againſt all right and

equitie) who haue falne vpon it, and poſſeſſed theis Countries, by declaring themſelues as enemies.
               10. And therefore it is needfull, that theis Countries ſhold bee freed from theis oppreſſions, vyolences, and diſtreſſes, by reducing and re eſtabliſhing them in their auncient ſtate and libertie, and in ſo doing to ſecure the ſafetie of the Kingdome off Sweathland. Moreover his Matie hath likewiſe proteſted before vs in the behalff of the Cittie of Stralſound, and the recovered principality of Rugen, to ſhewe, vnto them henceforward aſwell, as vnto all other places all love and freindſhip both in deed and word. And therefore wee had much rather the ſame ſhold bee poſſeſſed by him, then that hereafter wee ſhold excuſe our ſelves with the extreame loſſe and danger of our Countries. It is ſo therefore, that wee the afore ſaid King of Sweathland, and Duke of Pomerland, for vs our Kingdome, Dukedomes, and Principalities haue on both ſides, for the honour of God, the comfort, ſecuritie, and proſperitie of our people Kingdome, Dukedomes, lands and principalities, entred into this Treatie, made this agreement, haue ioyntly conſented vnto it, and concluded it in this manner following.
               1. That wee on both ſides henceforward with our Lands, States, and People, ſhall live together in a firme, neighbourlike amitie, peace, and affiance one of an other attempting no hoſtile Act, or enmitie the one againſt the other, or ſuffer any to bee plotted, or practiſed ſecretly by any others, but doe binde our ſelves in a ſtrickt league, and alliance in all our rights, dignities, States, and publick liberties, againſt all wronge, vyolence, oppreſſion, invaſion, devaſtation aſſaults preſſures and contribution whatſoever. In ioyning our ſelves to geather Muius armis &amp; Auxilijs. That is, by help of Armes mutually to preſerve and defend our ſelves on both ſides. It no wiſe forſaking one an other, much

leſſe by attempting any hoſtile act, one againſt the other. But by all means to ſeeke the welfare and good of each other. By ſetling a free Commerce out of the Kingdoms of Sweathland into Pomerland, and out of the Duke dome of Pomerland into Sweathland, with out any hinderance or moleſtation whatſoever: But to advance and further the ſame in everie place to the vtter moſt of our powers.
               In Conformitie whereof, wee for vs and our Poſterities, and States aboue mentioned, doe make this league. Amitie and neighbourlike vnitie and affiance betweene vs our Kingdome, Dukedomes, and Principalities. And all what ſoever depends on them, which is not onely hereby renewed. But alſo by vertue hereof renforced and reeſtabliſhed and ſhall continew for ever. And this vnion every tenth yeare ſhalbe renewed agayne.
               2. This renewed vnion made at this preſent, aymes onely at a defenſiue warr, and the preſervation of our ſelves, againſt all vniuſt violence oppreſſions and attempts, and in noe wiſe to goe offenſively. Vnles theſe Compacts, and this renewed Conſervation force vs therevnto of neceſſitie. In ſuch a caſe the one ſhall help and aſſiſt the other, as wee are bound to the vttermoſt of our abillitie.
               3. Moreover this vnion is not made Contra m
                        •
                     ieſtatem Imperatoris &amp; Imperij. That is, againſt his Imperiall Maieſtye, and the Empire, but rather reſpectivè pro imperij ſtat

                     , for the good of the State of the Empyre, and to keepe and reeſtabliſh it in the Auntient forme, libertie, peace, and the preſervation of the publick Religion againſt all the Inſolent diſturbers of the publick peace. Seeing alſo hereby is intented the continuation of the frendſhip, which wee Bogis Laus Dukes off Statin and Pomerland doe owe vnto the Romiſh imperiall Maieſty, the holy Empire, and the vpper Territory of Sarony may not be aboliſhed, but rather

according to our bounden dutie continewe the ſame; vpon condition the like be don on their part, and not by ſuffring any thing to be attempted, which ſhalbe preiudiciall to theſe contents. And declare further, that wee together with our principalities, Countries and people continewe by the Romiſh Empire, Imperiall laws and Inſtitutions, nether will ſuffer our Lands and States to ſever and alter from them, neither ſhall our Lands, principalities, Soveraignities Regalities Rights, and iuriſdictions: as likewiſe the Pomeriſh Countries Subiects and States, as Prelates, Nobility, Gentry, and Townes, either in their generall or ſpeciall priviledges immunities, rights, publick lawes, and ſtatutes, and legibus fundamentalibus, aſwell in their Iuribus ſingularibus as their common rights, and immunities be once abrogated, diſannulled or infringed thereby.
               4. But ſeeing this vnion is cheefely made to this end, that wee the Duke of Pomer, conſidering the vnchriſtianlike vſage and oppreſſion, wherewith wee have bin afflicted theſe three yeares, againſt the wholeſome Imperiall lawes, &amp; inſtitutions wholly impugning them. The publick inſtitutions and the many Capitulations, made for the lands peace. Yea againſt the Imperiall ſyncerationis mandata, and publick declarations, that our innocencie, &amp; conſtant fidelitie to them might appeare, that the Pomeriſh lands being thus ſurpriſed, might be reduced &amp; preſerved in their former State, that our Frontiers, paſſages, ſea ports, and Townes may not be damnified, but henceforward, may be ſecured from all innovation, oppreſſion and perill: It is agreed on on both ſides with an vnanimie conſent, that wee binde our ſelves faithfully together, that what befalls the one, ſhall befall the other, for the procuring of the publick good, and peace of the Religion in the holy Empire, and to reſiſt and oppugne the contrarie, in ioyning our forces together and

to prevent and divert the ſame to the vttermoſt of our powers.
               5. Likewiſe the Pomeriſh Provinces, Townes and places, which are or ſhalbe taken in by vs the King of Sweathland, ſhalbe faithfully redeliuered and reſtored againe to L. D. Duke of Pomer to his Allegeance and obedience, with all Regalties and rights there vnto belonging (none excepted) without any denyall, or demaunding of militarie charges to take them againe into his poſſeſſion. As alſo the Cittie of Stralſonnd ſhalbe reſtored likewiſe into the handes of L. D. Duke of Pomerland. And wee the ſaid Duke of Pomer doe not hereby ſeparate &amp; alienate the ſame from our other Pomeriſhlands, eſpecially the Principallitie of Rugen, to bee given ouer into the hands of ſtrangers, provided that they vſe all diligence, for the accommodating of the King of Sweathlands his Commiſſaries with all things neceſſarie whatſoeuermay further the publick defence of the land, in ſhewing them all loue, and good affection, and that aboue all the Cittie of Stralſound, ſhall hold and keepe their owne priueleges. in holding a ſpeciall alyance, with the Kings Ma. off Sweathland and in time ſhallbe caſed of their agreeuances as is fitting.
               6. Seing alſo that the Biſhoprick of Cammin is not comprehended vnder the Pomeriſh lands and Countries: Notwihſtanding that Pomer may diſpoſe of all things in this agreement to their good: it is ſo that the ſaid Dioceſſe, and State, ſhallenioy prorato the benefit eand fruit thereof, and for the taking away of all iealouſie and ſuſpition, it is agreed on for future tyme, that the ſaid Dyoceſſe, and their Cathederall Chapiter, ſhall not be troubled or forced to any thing againſt their ancient priviledges, Statutes, and other fundamentall lawes in electing a Biſhops. and his Coadin tours in any mannour whatſoeuer. Therefore the ſaid

Kinge of Sweathland, togeather with the Duke of Pomer. Doe hereby promiſe faithfully not onely to prevent and croſſe any ſuch thing: But alſo to mainteyne this Chapiter and dioceſſe in their free election, Dignities, State, and rights, againſt any violence which ſhalbe intended, or attempted againſt them.
               7. Without th'others foreknowledge and conſent, neither partie ſhall goe out of this alliance, much leſſe wee the Duke of Pomer by this preſent Act, will permit none to enter into this alliance, and agreement without his Ma conſent, &amp; his Royall Ma. doth like wiſe promiſe, that hee will not treat or conclude of any good for vs, and our Pomeriſhlands, but will before communicate the ſame vnto vs in due manner, that wee and our Countries bee not excluded thereout.
               8. And if any Chriſtian Potentate will ioyne with vs in this vnion, and come in aequis conditionibus vpon equall conditions it ſhalbe free for them to doe ſoe: Provided that thereby no parte of the Countrie ſhalbe put in duriorem conditionem, that is, into harder termes and conditions.
               9. All things wich may concerne this particular, and all rights for the conſervation of the publick peace of Pomerland, no further confederations ſhall come into conſiderations, much leſſe be made, which may in anyway be preiudicall or repugnant to this vnion, &amp; for our part we the Duke of Pomer hoe hereby promiſſe to make no league or confederacie with any other whoſoever, againſt the will &amp; conſent of his Royall Ma.
               10. If the ſaid Duke of Pomer his Countriesand Subiects ſhould by reaſon of this aliance, bee aſſaulted, ſurpriſed or perſecuted by any whoſoever it bee, wee the ſaid Kinge of Sweathland for our parte and our Kingdome, doe not ononely take into our faithfull protection the ſaid Duke and

all his Countries of Pomer, But will indevour to drawe all other Confederate Potentates into this league and coniunction with vs. And ſo by media defenſionis ſtrengthen our ſelves ſo much the more. And wee the Duke of Pomer for vs and our lands &amp; ſubiects; doe promiſe the like, that if the Crowne of Sweathland ſhold bee invaded and aſſaulted in regard of his aſſiſtance to vs, to diſcharge the ſame obligation.
               11. Likewiſe in the vnion and iuncture privilegium indigenatus, even as the inhabitants enioy them in that which concerneth the ſubiects of the Crowne of Sweathland, and the principalitie of Pomerland ſhabe (mutu
                        •

That is, in peace and warre, yet ſo as reſerving their ſupreame rights on both ſids, not extenuating their privileges, but rather furthering and reſpecting them
               12. That trading and Commerce ſhalbe better obſerued maintained and kept, that the King of Swethlands Coine ſhall goe currant in Pomerland, and the Pomeriſh in Swethland, according to the Valuation of the place.
               14. If any diſcord, ſtrife, or mis vnderſtanding ſhould hereafter ariſe betweene the Kings Ma. of Sweathland, and the Duke of Pomer, or on both ſides betweene them their Countries and people, the ſame ſhall not be decided by warr and the dint of the ſword, but according to the Agreement made at Statin Anno 1570. ſhall be appeaſed and ended by ſelected Commiſſioners, and deputies in all loue and frendſhip.
               14. Laſtlie wee the ſaid King of Sweathland haue expreſlie conditioned, that if any ſudden blowe or death ſhould befall vs, or that the aboueſand Duke of Pomer ſhold

happen to depart this world without any lawfull male Iſſue or Inheritour, Before the Prince Electour Brandenburch ſhall eventualiter be inveſted to the Dukedome hee ſhall ratify and confirme this vnion, ere the land be cleared and diſpoſſeſſed by his Ma. And in caſe the ſaid prince Electour ſhold be oppugned, or his title queſtioned by others touching his ſuceſſion. Wee the King of Swethland and our Succeſſours of the Crowne, will keepe theſe lands in ſequeſtratoria clientelari protectione, in our poſſeſſion ſo long vntill punctus ſucceſſarijs be abſolutelie decided, and till wee by the ſucceſſours thereof, be fully payd the military charge, of warr, yet ſo, as without laying any burden, charge or taxation vpō the the land of Pomer, or the States and countries therevnto belonging, and till this conionction and vnion be duely ratyfyed confirmed and accompliſhed. All which is done in the faith, and promiſſe of a chriſtian without all fraude.
               In witneſſe whereof, and for the conſtant and inviolable obſervation and keeping hereof: We the King of Swethland for vs and our ſucceſſours, Kingdome, and Lands. And wee the Duke of Pomerland for our Dukedomes, principalities, Lands and poſterity, haue ioyntly ratifyed and confirmed this alliance, and Aggreement with our Royall and princely ſeales, &amp; ſigned it with our owne knowledge and hands. Giuen at old Statin the tenth of this preſent month of Iune old ſtile, According to the Natiuity of our Redeemer Ieſus Chriſt 1630.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
               An Appendix, or Memoriall of the heads and chiefe Aggrevances, vvhich vvas preſented by his grace the Duke of Statin and Pomerland, vnto the Lord Iulian the King of Swethlands Commiſſarie Generall Anno 1630.
            1. THat in manie Quarters, and large Countries, the church of God is ſo diſperced, that they can performe noe religious excerſices, not be ſuffred to adminiſter the Lords holy Sacraments, ſo that, the poore people run vp &amp; downe together in flocks, without any Conſolation for their ſoules; yea their children dying without receiuing the holy ſeale of Baptiſme.
            2. That theſe Countries by reaſon of theſe two laſt yeeres and a halfe oppreſsion, and the quartering of ſouldiers in them, are reduced into the vttermoſt extremitie, yea, and are brought into ſucha caſe, that the ſuſtenance of life will come to late, neither can they get any foode, becauſe the ſommer ſeede is diſtroyed, and cannot be brought in, in ſo much, that whole Countries lies waſt, and vntilled, as euery place can ſufficiently witneſſe.
            3. That all proviſion of money and money-worth, as Tynne, Copper, and other Mettle, together with all manner, of malts, and proviſions for the kitchin, linnen &amp; Bedding are giuen in Contribution: yea, wee conceale howe the good Inhabitants of theſe Countries are forced for helping of themſelues, to laye their credit &amp; goods to pawne, to take vp moneys to paye this Contribution, to the end, that the rigourous execution (not by a fewe, but by a great number of ſouldiers, yea of whole companies in committing all manner of inſolences, as burſting open of doores, ſcoffing and geering the magiſtrates of Townes, &amp; vnfurniſhing the inhabitants of neceſſaries without reſpect of perſons, by forcing and conſtrayning from the people, might once ceaſe and not be committed.
            4. That the people by reaſon of the ſouldiers marchings too and

fro, and their continuall compulſions, being depriued of means, were not onely driuen to Eate hoggswaſh, the barke of trees, &amp; other vnnaturall things; yea dead mens fleeſh, &amp; to eate their owne parents, for the ſatisfying their hunger, in ſuch ſort, that of late time ſome freſh tragicall ſpectacles haue bin ſeene hereof. For in his graces Iuriſdiction of Wolgaſt, there were diuerſe people found dead with graſſe in their mouthes, And a woman in the village of Dandum, murthered her owne child, dreſt it, and eate it, and therewith ſatisfied her hunger of which there are many credible proofs. I conceale how many haue made an end of themſelves out of deſperation, and by poy ſonmg them ſelues, to eſcape from the threatned tourments of the ſouldiers, requiring that from them, which they had not, ſo that the moſt part dyed miſerably, and periſhed with hunger.
            5. And though for the taking away of horſes, many ordinances haue bin publiſhed, yet they are ſo litle regarded, that there is ſcarce now a ſouldier goes afoote, but muſt ride a cock horſe, which cauſes that the ſeede is not onely ſowne, but alſo noe horſe can be gott vpon the high-waies, or for his Imperiall maieſties ſeruice.
            6. And albeit the officers are furniſhed with horſes, and forrage provided for them, yet never theleſſe the poore people, when the officers iourney a hors back, or haue any thing brought vnto them, they take their horſes from them, or the ſouldiers rides them dead.
            7. When that the poore people for want of horſes cannot furniſh them to put into their waggons and karrs, as they require, and at the officers pleaſure, that then the magiſtrates in the Townes, yea likewiſe his graces owne officers and Councill if they refuſe, againſt the Lord Generalles order, where there lie ſpeciall Safe-gards, preſentby to vexe them they are taken from them, and they ſend them ſouldiers to lye vpon them, and thus are plagued and terrified with them. Therefore it is good reaſon, that they ought to be protected &amp; defended againſt theſe inſolences of the Emperours armies, and ſuch vnanſwerable enormities ought to be ſeuerely puniſhed.
            8. That the officers are not contented with their vſuall billet-moneys and fyring, but hewe downe the growing woods, cutt downe whole groves, and will not be contented vnleſſe they haue variety of diſhes.
            9. It is therefore needfull to take ſuch order therein, that this land in all places (in ſtead of their ſubiection, and dutifull devotion) be not brought into a vaſt wilderneſſe and that the one be not conſtrayned to paye for the other.
            
               
10. That the people be not proſt to ſend many waggons, ſhow vels, ſpades, pickaxes for the ordinance, and ſuch like materials: and yet not with ſtanding by ſharpe exactions are forced to ſend great ſommes of money, yea ſometimes a thowſand Rix-dallers vpon a waggon, beſide the daylie furniſhing thē with victualls, &amp; munitious. Therfore the neceſsitie requires that not onely ſuch, but alſo ſuch other like innovations, and committed exactions, which are againſt the lands welfare ſhould be ſeverely prohibited.
            11. That his graces cuſtomes and Toles againſt the Lord Generals ordinance notwith ſtanding they be in the midſt of the land are neuertheleſſe taken from him.
            12. That beſides the manifold huntings (yea which are ſo common by the vnder officiers) in ſhooting of Deere and game and ſpoiling of chaſes continew ſtill.
            13. That the manie out-flyings of the ſouldiers, and out rydings of horſemen into villages, which giues an euill exſample to others, and emboldens them the more are not forbidden.
            14. When the poore people complaine of theſe inſolences, they cannot be heard, but are ſent awaye with geering and threatnings, or whenſoener his grace or his graces Officers interceeds for them, they diſdayne to giue them an anſwere.
            15. That they will not abate the charge of contribution, but the officers and ſouldiers though not withſtanding they be maintained by the quartiers will preſse the exaction of what is required to a penny, therefore they entreate, that what they haue had to much maye be deducted from them.
            16. That the Cattle and Mettails (ſeing there are but a litle left,) maye be receiued vpon a due price, and the vſuall worth, and though a certaine price is ſet therevpon. yet the fame in their exactions are not kept and obſerued.
            17. That for diverſe Churches, which are broken downe and althings plundred out of them, as was committed lately by the Gotriſh horſemen in Rughen, it is exceeding need full they ſhold be puniſhed there fore, and an exſample be made thereof.
            18. Robing in the high-waies is ſo frequent and common in diverſe places, that the poore people cannot bring vp their grevous taxation, and after it is taken from them muſt pay it once againe.
            19. Beſides, whatſoeuer is conditioned and promiſſed them, nothing is performed, but firſt one end then an other is threatned with execution.
            
               
20. That others comprehended in the laſt diſpatched ordinances, not a point thereof is kept, nor the violaters there of once puniſhed, but the more the complaints are, the leſſe remedie is for them.
            To conclude then, according as the prince himſelfe muſt acknowledge, and the teſtimonie of all the provinces, the Emperours ſouldiers doe not performe &amp; keepe any thing of that which they haue promiſſed, and therefore all thir treaties and Contracts, which wee take vpon truſt, and the ſteadfaſtneſſe which one ought to relie vpon them, is rather to be avoyded, then to be entred into with them.
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            A Letter of Ferdinand the Roman Emperour to the moſt Illuſtrious King of Svvethen Guſtavus Adolphus, &amp;c. tranſlated out of Latine into Engliſh.
            Together vvith his Maieſties an ſvvere concerning the preſent Germaine Warre.
            
               Caeſars Letter.
               
                  WEe Ferdinand the ſecond, by the grace of God, Emperour of the Romans, &amp;c. Declare to the moſt Illuſtrious King of the Swethens Gothes, and Vandales, our frendſhip love, and much health.
               Moſt Illuſtrious Prince, moſt deare frend, it is related to vs from places deſerving credit, that your Maieſtie hath this yeere gathered a ſtrong Armie of horſe and foote, &amp; againſt expectation ſett forth a part thereof, firſt vpon the Iles of the Sacred Roman Empire, and next vpon the reſt of the Territories thereof, that you haue alſo not onely de facto ſeized vpon ſome places, Forts, and Cities of great moment in the Duchie of Pomer, and vſurped to yourſelf in them the right of impoſt, which as regall doth properlie belong to vs: but alſo yow haue determined moreover, to in vade vs, and the Empire with further hoſtilitie.
               But foraſmuch as wee doe nowaies remember, that in

all the time, that the weightie burthen of the Empire hath bin ſuſtained by vs, any adverſe or ſiniſtrous accident hath hapned, eyther betwixt vs, or betwixt the Empire, and your Ma. or that we, or the Empire (for ought we knowe) haue giuen any occaſion of any troubles, or diſſentions, much leſſe of ſuch open hoſtilitie: it ſeemeth verie wonderfull to vs, that for controverſies ariſen, concerning the towne of Straleſound, of which your Ma. needed not haue feared any hurt, your Ma. hath nowe de facto begun a warre, hurtfull perhaps to both ſides againſt vs, and the Empire: ſeing therefore all theſe things are done, within our and the Empires bounds, and concernes the lawes and priviledges of the Empire, in the which your Ma. maye limit vs noe further, then your Maieſtie would not diſdaine in ſuch kinde of controverſies to be limited by others, within the Kingdome of Swethen: eſpeciallie, ſeing that in our opinion the ſaid controverſies might without all doubt vpon iuſt conditions have altogether bin compoſed, and ſet at reſt, without theſe hoſtilities, and vntimely profuſion of bloode, by the mediation of the King of Denmarke (which being by excellent advice propounded vnto him, he did with noe leſſe readineſſe embrace) if your Ma. had with the like zeale with vs inclined to the ſaid compoſition, and ſent your officers at the time appointed with ſufficient inſtruction to the ſaid Treaties, but certainlie howſoeuer the matter were, it had bin expedient by the lawes of all nations, if your Ma. had not thought, that breaking of amitie with vs, you had ſufficient reaſon to invade vs by warre, that your Maieſtie ſhould firſt haue lawfully denounceed that warre againſt vs, and not againſt all law and equitie invaded the Empire: Surely we certifie and aſſure your Maieſtie, that theſe our preparations of warre vpon the Balticke ſea, as alſo the reſt, did never tend to the offence of your Ma. nor doe they as yet, tende

therevnto; but that we were alwaies readie and prompt to continew that mutuall frendſhip, &amp; neighbourhood, which is betweene vs, your Ma. and the Kingdome of Swethen, and that this is yet ſtill our minde if your Ma. giue vs noe further cauſe to change our reſolution, but will breake off this vnneceſſarie warre. Wherefore we frendlie exhort your Ma. not to meddle noe further with the ſtate of the Empire, &amp; the reſt of the members thereof, foraſmuch as we haue given your Ma. noe cauſe at all, but that leaving the places, which your Ma. hath ſeized vpon, your Ma. doe without delaye withdrawe your armie from the Iles &amp; lands of the Empire, that with your Shipps, yee doe not hinder navigation, trading, and commerce, and that neither by Sea, nor by land ye be not offenſive to vs, or to the Empire in the rights thereof. But if the contrarie hereof ſhall appeare, your Ma. maye aſſure your ſelf, that in contemning, and deſpiſing this out imperiall declaration, and that your Ma. with a confident ſecuritie ſhall attempt and goe on in this your begun hoſtilitie, and will not yeeld to reſtore theſe places (which yee haue de facto, eyther by warlike force, or by ſlight poſſeſſed your ſelfe off) we will according to our might by the vnanimous ayde of the Electours of the Empire, prepare our ſelues ſpeedelie to recover the ſame, and will alſo chiefely take to heart our owne, and the Empires reputation, the preſervation, and tuition of our obedient ſtates, as alſo howe any further calamitie maye be diverted. But we hope your Ma. will not ſuffer the matter to come into theſe extremities, and according as this our Imperiall letter takes effect with your Ma. we ſhall be readie to doe you all frendſhip and whatſoever elſe maye be acceptable to your Ma▪ Giuen at our &amp; the ſacred Empires citie of Ratis bona the 18. of Auguſt Anno 1630.
               
                  To the moſt illuſtrious prince, Lord Guſtavus Adolphus King of the Sw
                        •…
                     , Goths and Vandales our most deare frend and Couſin. 
                  Your Ma. Couſine readie to all duetie.
               
            
            
               
               The King of Svvethen his anſvvere.
               MOſt Illuſtrious and moſt Mightie Emperour, moſt deare friend, and Couſin: wee have, not without admiration, vnderſtood by your Imperiall Mas. letter, ſent to vs the 18. of Auguſt laſt paſt, &amp; delivered to vs in our Campe at Ribnits the 6, of this month, that your Imp. Ma. doth much wonder, that we have this laſt ſommer paſſed over with an army into Germany; and would ſo turne over the Fault, both of making this warre, as alſo of the neglect of denouncing it vpon vs. certainly, we did not thinke your Imp. Ma. to have ben ſo vnmyndfull of matters paſt, that yow ſhould doubt, which of vs did firſt offend the other by armes; and we have all wayes promiſed our ſelves more of your Imp. Mas. equanimity, then that he would have that imputed to the one, which is committed by the other. That the Mareſhall of your Imp. Mas. army, did the laſt yeare, without any proclamation of warr, bring (in greatnes) a reaſonable army, together with the hoſtile Imperiall enſeignes againſt vs into Pruſsia (that we may paſſe by the long and greevous traine of other hoſtilities and injuries heaped the one vpon the other) it is as well knowne to all men, as it is certaine, that we have now ſufficiently proved the hoſtile mynde and invaſion of thoſe Imperiall forces, which neither our innocencie, not the moſt, equitable requeſts of our Counſell by their meſſage was able to ſtay or revoke. Wherfore all reaſons being well and diligently diſcuſſed, we can ſcarcely ſee, by what title or right, the cauſe of this warr can be attributed to vs, or by what colour or pretext of equitie your Imp. Ma. doth require of vs (not making, but repelling warr) a denounciation of warr, neglected by yourſelff, and doth inthat behalff accuſe vs of violating the lawe of Nations; for as much, as it is manifeſt, that it is no leſſe agreable to the lawe of Nations, that thoſe warrs, which are vndertaken for the repelling of force, are not proclaymed by a Heralde, but by nature it ſelff: Neither have we nothwithſtanding altogether omitted all denunciation (howbeit in

this caſe noewayes-neceſſarie on our part) but we have ben very carefull, and warie, that no man, might by any right complaine, that being deceived by hope of Peace, he ſuffered hoſtilitie vnawars; by two letters, we ſent to the Electors of the Roman Empire, as alſo by ſignifying to the Generall of your Imp. Ma. army, by the Legate of our Counſell, that vnles the errours alreadie committed by the other ſide, were in time amended, a neceſsity ſhould be laid vpon vs, by the iniquity of the neglecters of our moſt juſt complaints, by other meanes to provide for our ſecuritie and dignity. Moreover, your Imp. Ma. doth affirme that while he hath governed the raines of the Empire, nothing hath ben done by him, either injuriouſly, or maliciouſly againſt vs, nor that his preparations of watt both by ſea and land did tend to any ſuch thing, wherby we and our ſtates needed to feare any daunger. and finally, that all matters controverted betwixt your Imp. Ma. and vs, might be eaſily ſet at reſt, by other means, and that they were not of ſuch importance, that therfore preſently armes were to be taken againſt the Roman Empire. But, we doe not, on the contrarie, ſearch and inquire ſo diligently, whether theſe proteſtations be not contrary to the deede it ſelff, all which we confidently leave to be judged of by the world? Whether your Imp. Ma. had any intention in any kinde to offend vs, we doe not know, as being vnable to dive into the moſt inward and hidden ſecrets of your mynd: but, that vnder the ſhadow and authoritie of the high imperiall name (and that either by your Imp. Ma. command, or at leaſt, connivence) many and divers indignities, hoſtilities, and injuries were done vnto vs, is ſo cleare, that to attempt to deduce it more at large, were all one, as to pres to adde light to the ſunne, neither doe we feare to appeale to your Imp. Mas. owne conſcience, either as witnes, or judge in this matter. What we ought likewyſe to have promiſed our ſelves of your Imp. Mas. preparations of warr, we will not ſo much declare, as his officers and miniſters actions, endeavours, and devyces, not only ambiguous and ſuſpected, but manifeſt, doe ſufficiently vtter and ſignifie: all which, if they be ſilent, let Pomer ſpeake, which together with the adjacent Provinces, hath theſe years bygone bene miſerably vexed, exhauſted and brought to nought by your Imp. Mas. forces, in malice againſt vs, and vnder no other colour, then vnder the pretext of warr againſt Swethen. More over, we doe not deny but the controverſies, which were ariſen, might have bene decided more commodiouſly by other means, then by armes, and it were to be

wiſhed, that your Imp. Ma. had eſteemed as equitably of that ſupply wherwith we (with no damage to the Roman Empire, but rather to the benefite therof) did moſt juſtly ſuccour the Citie of Stralſound; as we did conſtantly, with a mynd reſolutely bent to patience, for the good and tranquillity of common Chriſtianity pardon that hoſtility, which (together with many more injuries) the Duke of Holſatia did exerciſe againſt vs, moſt vnjuſtly, vnder the very Colours and Enſeignes: of your Imp. Ma. for we ſhould hardly doubt, but that then, whatſoever diffidence and diſcord had ariſen betwixt your Imp. Ma. and vs, might eaſily have bene compoſed by a friendly tranſaction, neither ſhould perhaps a neceſſity have bene laid vpon vs; to have leavied an army, at ſo great a charge, and to place our colours vpon the confines of the Roman Empire, to the end we might maturely prevent the imminent evill, leaſt it ſhould ſpread itſelf further. But ſince it hath otherwiſe ſemed good to your Imp. Ma. and that your commiſsioners have, contrary to the ſtatutes of all Nations, refuſed to admit our ambaſſage, ſent to Lub
                     •
                  c cheefly, to decide the cauſe and controverſie of the Sound, ſeing alſo your Imp, Ma. armyes have declared themſelves ſo open enimies to vs, and have exerciſed all hoſtilitie againſt vs, offending vs with all manner of hoſtile attemps: every lover of equitie, and indifferent arbitratour in this cauſe, will ſay, that not we, but rather your Imp. Ma. vilipending other equitable and lawfull means, hath at the firſt attempted extremities: how beit therfore, that (being ſo many wayes vnworthily provoked, and almoſt dejected from all hope of any frendly compoſition) we might, without all note or ſuſpition of any vnjuſt attempt, rather have bene ſollicited for other means thencefoorth, then for proffers of any farther peace: yet nothwithſtanding, that we might teſtifie to all the Chriſtian world our fervent deſire, and endeavour for common tranquillity, we would no wiſe caſt of our reſolution of peace, but did, by our earneſt and frequent calling bring the moſt Gracious King of Denmarck this laſt winter ſo farre, that interpoſing himſelff for peace, we prepared the way for appointing a frendly treatie betwixt our and your Imp. Ma. commiſſaries at Dantfike then did we alſo furniſh and provide our Chancelour, with the reſt adjoyned to him, with full commiſsion to enter into that treatie: and finally, leſt the motions of warr ſhould any wiſe diſturbe the deliberations of peace, we ſuffered our militarie expedition (not without loſſe both of time and means) to be differred for a long time. of this our care and ſollicitude for the common quietnes,

and tranquillitie of Chriſtian contreyes, this was the truſt we gained, that our beſt deliberations, being ſhifted of by divers ſlights and ſubtilities, did not only evaniſh without taking any effect; but that now alſo your Imp. Ma. doth make no ſcruple to aſcribe the cauſe to vs, why that buſines had no proſperous ſucceſſe: wheras it had bene more agreable to equitie, rather to have examined the doings of your Imp. Ma. Commiſſarie, who did with earneſt endevour hinder the mediators from viſiting our Ambaſſadors, reſiding at Dantſike, and from laying the foundation of the future treatie, according to the due and accuſtomed manner and it had bene altogether more expedient, that your Imp. Ma. ſhould have pondered with your ſelff, whether this often aforeſaid treatie ought ſo ſtrictly to have bene tyed to the towne of Dantſike that (that place being, by reaſon of what happened afterwards, in reſpect of ſome ſeed of variance, which was then ſowne betwixt our officers, and the towne of Dantſike made incommodious and ſuſpected to thoſe of our ſide) it might not have bene celebrated elſwhere, but was to the hurt of the common tranquillitie, for that cauſe only, to be altogether broken off, becauſe our Deputies (though for reaſons vrgent and pregnant enough) could not preciſely appeare in the ſaid place. All and each of theſe, being weighed in a juſt ballance, let any man, who doth ſincerely eſteeme of matters, judge which of vs hath juſter cauſe to complaine of the other, yea we commit this to be examined and diſcuſſed by your Imp. Ma. his owne ſecret thoughts, in the which we doe fully perſwade ourſelves, that we arte clearly purged. Now your I. M, does indeed affirme, that yee will maintaine inviolable frendſhip with vs, and our Kingdome of Swethen, if ſo be, that we reſtraine, yea altogether lay downe our armes. but for as much, as the matter is not now any more entire and the daunger hanging over the heads of our States, cannot be ſaid to be imaginarie, but hath often really and effectually ſhowne it ſelff, and ſince that we have bene wronged and offended both by ſea and land, not in word, but by armes, and other hoſtile enterpriſes; we deſire your I. M. to pardon vs, that we can not admit of ſuch caution and proviſion for our ſecuritie, and that, being beyond words offended, we cannot in this manner be ſatisfyed, but have determined to maintaine theſe armes, which we neceſſarily and juſtly have put on, vntill ſuch time, as that we have either this way ſufficiently provided for our ſecurity and dignitie; or then, the juſt feare, and reall imminent daunger as alſo the offences, and injuries really inferred vpon vs, be redreſt by

ſufficient proviſion, and real ſatisfaction: and commending the whole matter to the goodnes of God, and to the equitie of the cauſe, we doe not refuſe to abide whatſoever may befall vs, in this our moſt equitable, and conſtant reſolution, but if in the meane time your I. M. thinke that the ſhip of the Chriſtian worlde, which hath now this long time bene vehemently toſſed by the huge and violent waues of warr, is rather to be brought into the deſired and calme haven of peace, then any longer to be committed to the ſtormy ſea of contention and armes, and for this cauſe, does incline to any farther treatie, your Imp. Ma. ſhal ſee, that we ſhall nowayes be avers from ſo ſafe and pious a reſolution, and ſo ſoone as your Imp. Ma. ſhall ſuffer yourſelff to be induced ſo farr, that we may ſee the Princes and Common wealths of Germany, our reſpectiue allies, Kinſmen, frends, and moſt deere neighbours ſo reſtored to that former eſtate, wherin they were, before this German warr did beginne to wax or increaſe, that our States may thencefoorth be duely ſecured, and mutuall truſt and frendſhip may againe be renewed betwixt our Kingdome and theſe people, as alſo, that by experience we may try and perceave theſe vnuſuall preparations of navies and armes vpon theſe coaſts, partly juſtly to be ſuſpected of vs, and partly nowayes to be tollerated, in reſpect of the defence of the Balthik ſea, which doth belong to vs, to have ceaſed, and a due conſideration to be had of the injuries inferred vpon vs, as alſo of the noe ſmal charges which we have bene forced to beſtow for this our defence: verily, no ſooner ſhall any man ſee theſe things accompliſhed on your Imp. Ma. his part, but he ſhall really and ipſo facto find it made manifeſt by vs, that our greateſt deſire doth moſt tend, to keep inviolated frendſhip with your Imp. Ma. no les, then with the reſt of our neighbours, and mutuall truſt and confidence being renewed, and all other contention

being laid a ſide) only to contend with your Imp. Ma. in good will, and all other kind of dueties whatſoever. Mattors ſtanding in this condition, we ſhould alſo ſcarcely give occaſion to any man juſtly to complaine, that we did to curiouſly prye into other mens affairs: for, as we are not accuſtomed to intermix our ſelves with other mens matters except other mens affairs be ſo mingled with ours, that the one doth involve the other; and as in all this time, that Germany hath bene burning in the flame of warr, we, being contented with the care of our owne Kingdome, did not involve our ſelves, in the affairs of Germany, vntill ſuch time, as the iniquitie of other men did bring the matter to that pas, that other mens affairs did alſo concerne vs, ſo ſhould we alſo be found to be of the ſame mynd then, neither ſhould we in any kinde trouble your Imp. Ma. by making the affairs of Germany to be ours. But howſoever the matter fall out, and whether it appoint vs peace or warr, we doe religiouſly proteſt that we doe foſter no hoſtilitie in our mynd againſt the Roman Empire (wherto your Imp. Ma. would ſeem to draw and wreſt the poynct of the buſſines) and that we are ſo farr from deſyring any thing to be attempted to the prejudice therof, that we have rather determined to keep inviolated and ſound frindſhip with the ſame, ſo long as it doth abſtain from all manner of hoſtilitie againſt vs, and doth not wreſt out of vs, though vnwilling, a juſt retaliation, either by favouring our enimies, or by aſſociating it ſelff vnto them.

Having by all theſe ingenuouſly declared our mynd concerning the matter in hand, we frendly recommend your Imp. Ma. to the protection of God. Given at Stralſound the laſt of October, 1630.
