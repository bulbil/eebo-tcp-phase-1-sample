            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            Inſtructions for the Clergie.
            1 THat the Lords, the Biſhops, giue charge in their Triennall Viſitations, and
at other conuenient times, both by themſelues and the Archdeacons, that the
declaration for ſetling all queſtions in difference, bee ſtrictly obſerued by
all parties.
            2 That they take great care concerning the Lecturers, in their ſeuerall Dioceſſes,
for whom we giue theſe ſpeciall directions following.
            1 That in all Pariſhes, the afternoone Sermons, may bee turned into Catechiſing by
Queſtion and Anſwere, where and whenſoeuer there is not ſome great cauſe
apparant to breake this ancient and profitable order.
            2 That euery Biſhop ordaine in his Dioceſſe, that euery Lecturer doe read Diuine
Seruice according to the Liturgie printed by Authority, in his Surplis and
Hood before the Lecture.
            3 That where a Lecture is ſet vp in a market Towne, it may be read by a company of
graue and orthodox Diuines, neere adioyning, and in the ſame Dioceſſe: and
that they preach in Gownes, and not in Clokes, as too many doe vſe.
            4 That if a Corporation doe maintaine a ſingle Lecturer, he be not ſuffered to preach,
till he profeſſe his willingneſſe to take vpon him a liuing, with Cure of ſoules
within that Incorporation, and that he doe actually take ſuch Benefice or Cure,
ſo ſoone as it ſhall be fairely procured for him.
            3 That the Biſhops doe countenance and encourage the graue and orthodox Diuines
of their Clergie, and that they vſe meanes by ſome of their Clergie, or
others, that they may haue knowledge, how both Lecturers and Preachers
within their Dioceſſes, behaue themſelues in their Sermons, that ſo they may
take order for any abuſe accordingly.
            4 That the Biſhops ſuffer none vnder Noble men, and men qualified by Law, to haue
any priuate Chaplaine in his houſe.
            5 That they take ſpeciall care, that Diuine ſeruice be diligently frequented, as well
for Prayers and Catechiſing, as Sermons: And take particular note of all
ſuch as abſent themſelues, as Recuſants or otherwiſe.
            6 Laſtly the Lord Arch-Biſhop is commanded to giue an accompt to the Kings
Maieſty euery yeere the ſecond of Ianuary, of the performance of theſe
Commands.
