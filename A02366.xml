            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

For we are carefull, and conſider of euery part, to the ende we maye reſtore it to the owne proper nature. But this knowledge of euerye member can not bee generallye compriſed, but onelye by a full knowledge of euerye part in the ſame. Therefore whoſoeuer will knovv the nature of the eyes,

muſt firſt of all know and vnderſtande by little peeces all the partes whereof they are made, and by the ſame maner all their offices and functions, to what ende they ſerue, and of what ſubſtance or matter they are made.Gal 3. booke of method. med. For the curing of diſeaſes doth not onely conſiſte in the knowledge of them, but alſo in the skill rightlye to appoint and duelye to applye the remedies which are proper to the diſeaſed partes, all which in reſpect of their diuers nature requyre diuers medicines. For this cauſe I haue thought it verye expedient to declare the nature of the eye, before I lay open the particular diſeaſes of the ſame.

And by good right they haue ſuch rule and ſoueraigntie amongeſt al the ſenſes, and all other partes of the bodye, that thoſe vvhich are depriued of ſight either by nature, or by any other miſhap doe thinke them ſelues in great miſerye. They coulde not haue beene placed more fitlye then in the higheſt part of all the body,The place of the eye. as it vvere in a moſt high tovver, ſeeing they muſt ſerue as ſpies and vvatch-men to defende and guide all the other partes: vvherevnto nature hath made moſte cunninglye twoo hollovve places or troughes in the heade named of their roundnes orbitas.

                        THE eies are compaſſed and armed aboue and beneath, on the right hand, and on the left, and on euerie part, not only for their protection and defence, but alſo to make them appeare more beautifull &amp; fairer. And indeede the noſe ſerueth as a rampire and bulwarke vnto them, purging them and the braine of ſuperfluous humours. The bones named Ethmoides &amp; Iugale are no leſſe commodiouſlie placed for their preſeruation and maintenaunce. And concernyng the eye lyddes wherewyth they are defended and couered:The vſe of the eye liddes. they are not onelie an ornamente, but alſo as gates and drawing bridges, hauing their muſcles as chaines to lift them vp, and let them downe when it ſhalbe expedient, either in ſeing, ſleeping, or waking, and to ſtay whatſoeuer might fall into them, and on their edges they haue the haires called Cilia, which are as little pales ſtraight &amp; ſure placed in a conuenient diſtaunce one from another,The hayres of the eye liddes that they might mutuallie imbrace eche other, whereby the

eie ſhould be more ſurelie ſhut. Moreouer, they ſerue to directe the beames in ſeeing, that they may looke more ſtraightlie, and in like maner to defend them againſt litle flies, againſt the duſt, againſt little chips or ſhiuers, and ſuch like thinges, which entring into them might hurt them: and they doe alſo beautifie them being ſet round about them as a little border.The browes and hayres on them. Not vnlike to theſe are the browes with their haire, which beſides the ornament that the eyes receiue from them, do ſerue principallie to defende them againſt raine and ſweate of the head and forehead, which deſcending downe, might fall vpon them: therfore were they faſhioned like vnto halfe a circle or croſſe, or a little vault, or appenthouſe iointlie or equallie agreeing at the top of the noſe, to the end that the ſweat and the raine might haue his courſe &amp; eaſie diſcent on both ſides without flowing or dropping into them. And leaſt themſelues ſhould be anie hinderance vnto the eyes or enter into them,The hayres on the eielids grow little or nothing. God hath created thē &amp; the hairs on the eie lids of ſuch a nature, that either they grow not at all, or els verie little, but

                        CHAP. 3. Of the coates and membranes or Partchmemtlike ſkinnes of the eies.
                        
                           The matter of the eies moſt excellent.COncerning the matter wherof the eies are made, it farre excelleth all other parts, whether wee haue reſpect to the membranes or partchement-like ſkinnnes, or to the humors, ſinewes, vaines, arteries, muſcles, or to the glandulous ſubſtance, and kernels whereof they are made. Now becauſe the humours are thinne and moiſt,The vſe of the membranes. nature hath giuē vnto them membranes or partchment skins which might fitlie keep them in their appointed place to the perfourming of their office, which by the ſearching of the Anatomiſtes haue beene noted to bee fiue in number.The firſt coat of the eie. The firſt is noted in Latine adnata, alba, adhaerem, coniunctiua, in Engliſh the white of the eye. This mē
                           brane or partchment skinne is verie thinne and ſlender, ſeruing to containe the eye in his circle or collet: whoſe beginning is from Pericranium, that is

from the skinne which compaſſeth the the skull, and his ende is in the circle named Iris or the rainbow: this which is called Iris,
                           what Iris is. is a circle in the eie repreſenting manie diuers colours, the varietie and number whereof are not to be iudged to proceed frō the humours but from the membrane called vuea. For the humors in all perſons are alwaies of like colour,Humors are like in al men. but the circle named Iris is not ſo, becauſe in ſome mē it appeareth more blacke, in others more white or blew, according to the diuerſitie of the colours which are in the membrane called vuea. It was named Iris, which in Engliſhe ſignifieth a Rainbow, bicauſe in it do appear ſuch change of colours as are ſeen in the Rainbow.The ſecond coat of the eie The ſecond membrane or partchment skinne is named Cornea, that is, hornie, which is more ſtrong and hard, reſembling horn that is made thin &amp; bright, euen ſuch wherof Lanternes are made, from the likeneſſe wherof it ſeemeth to haue been named Cornea, that is horny. Now god hath ſo created it, that it ſhould bee a ſurer defence to all the humors of the eies, &amp; to help the light which the eies

receiue into them, through whoſe middeſt it ſhineth &amp; ſendeth out the light euen as the candle which is in the Lantern, caſteth his light toward the horn whereof the ſame is made.The horny membrane is not in euery place of the ſame nature This hornie membrane is not in euery part like vnto it ſelfe: for the former parte of it, which wee may and doe beholde: wherein the apple of the eie is placed and enuironned with Iris, or the Rainbowe, that part I ſay, is bright, &amp; hath a through light, that ſo colours might haue the better paſſage and entertainment, but the hinder part of it is darke and verie thick &amp; groſſe,The errour of Arabians. which thing cauſed the Arabians to make it two membranes. VVe muſt marke and obſerue that it is made of manie little skinnes, and as it were thinne barks, which take their beginning from dura mater, whiche is diuided into ſundrie ſmall skinnes. The vſe and office of this membrane, is to make the eye round by compaſsing in all the humours of the ſame.The third coate. The third membrane or partchment skinne is vuea, vvhich is in Engliſh like to a grape, being ſo called, becauſe it hath in the outvvarde parte the reſemblaunce of a

blacke grape when it is preſſed, vvhoſe beginning is from the ſecond skinne, compaſſing the braine, called pia mater, which after it hath encloſed the ſinewe of ſight, named neruur opticus, ſpreadeth abroade vnder the hornie membrane, aſcending vnto the circle Iris, and yet inwrappeth not the whole eie. For when it is cōmed thus far, then leauing the hornie membrane it maketh the hole for the apple of the eie, and bendeth backward to the circle &amp; large circumference of the criſtaline humour, vnto which it cleaueth faſt, ſtaying the wateriſhe humour that it ſhould not couer &amp; burie al the whole cryſtaline humour.The vſe. The outward part of it is blacke, to the end it might gather and heape vp in it ſelf, the glittering beames, and that the diuers kinds of colours might be thereby better vnited, receiued, and conioyned. For as it is the propertie of white to ſcatter abroade, ſo is it the nature of blacke to gather together.Diuers coloures in the eyes. And touching the innermoſt part of it, it is indued with many colours, that by ſeeing manie colours we might the better iudge of them, and bee able to diſtinguiſhe one

from another when they are offered to our ſight. Otherwiſe, if it had been died but with one colour onelie, then all thinges which our eies doe behold, woulde haue ſeemed to haue been of this onelie colour: euen as wee ſee a greene or red glaſſe maketh all things appeare greene or red. Furthermore, this change and diuerſitie of colours refreſheth the weried eies in ſuch ſort, that before we haue viewed and looked on a thing diligentlie, we ſtay our eyes for this purpoſe, that the ſpirites of ſight may as it were, retire themſelues to this diuerſitie of colours as to a place of recreation and comfort. This membrane named vuea is ſoft, leaſt it might hurt the cryſtaline humor,wherefore v

                              ea is ſoft. and found directlie ſet to the ſaid humor, that the light might haue more free entrance, and that by his darkneſſe the paſſage of the colours might not bee ſtopped: it is nouriſhed with the veines &amp; arteries of the hornie membrane.The apple of the eie. Now that which is ſeen on the hole or centre of the eye like vnto a black pricke, is named the apple of the eye, by the which we ſee: and albeit it doth appeare blacke, yet is neither it

nor any thing vnder it black, but thorowlie cleere and bright.The 4 coat. The fourth membrane is named in Greek amphybleſtroides, which in Engliſh ſignifieth a caſting net, which taketh his beginning frō the ſinew of ſight called ner

                              us opticus, whoſe coate is ſtretched foorth, and vvouen like to a net of manie veines and arteries, which it receiueth from the membrane vuea, both for his nouriſhment and life, and for the glaſsie humor wherewith it is clothed on the hinder part.The 5. coa

                            The fift is called Arachnoides, becauſe it reſembleth the Spiders webbe, which is in greeke arachne, whoſe beginning as ſom think is from Pia mater, but as others affirme, frō the cryſtalin humor to wit, from the ſuperfluous matter &amp; excrement of the ſame. His vſe is to enwrap the ſaid humor in all the former parte.Ambroſe Pare. 
                           Ambroſe Pare reporteth one moſt excellent commodity of the ſame: that it ſerueth to the criſtaline humor, as a glaſſe to behold, ſo that it is vnto it as Lead, whereby it falleth out that the diuers ſorts and kindes of viſible things which are ſent from any part of the obiect, that is frō the thing

which is offered to our ſight, may bee retained in the ſaide humor by ſuch a coniunction, and linking of each to other, as we ſee in a looking glaſſe that is made of glaſſe and Lead, which hath force and power to ſtay the outwarde face and image from paſſing through, but holdeth them as it were gathered on a heap in the vppermoſt part of it.

There are foure of theſe muſcles ſtraight, taking their beginning frō the bottome of the circle, in which the eye is placed,The vſe of the foure muſcles called orbita, which compaſsing the ſinewe of ſight doe ende in the middeſt of the eye, that is to ſay one in the vppermoſt part drawing it towardes the noſe, an other in the left ſide drawing it vpwarde, the thirde in the loweſt parte drawing it downevvarde, the fourth in the right ſide dravving it tovvards the eare, and vvhen they haue accompliſhed their action, they plucke it invvarde. The

other two turne the eie, yet not fullie, but onelie on the ſide, that it might looke backward. For there is not anie thing to bee ſeene vvithin, but onelie vvithout the head. The firſt is verye long &amp; ſlender, beginning at the bottome of the circle named orbita, toward the great corner ending vvith a thin tendon, vvhich pearceth thorovv a little membrane or skinne like vnto a ring, vvhich is made faſt neere vnto the moyſt kernell, from vvhich in weping teares proceed, called commonlie glandula lachrymalis, by the vvhich vvhen it hath paſſed as it vvere by a powly, it maketh a ſtraight corner goyng forvvarde, vntyll it bee imparted in the vppermoſt part of the eie.

Then vvith your Launcet open vvhether you vvill, making no greater an iſſue then you doe in common blood-letting letting run forth s;o much blood as ſhall be expedient,

This affection (as Galen ſayth) commeth by the defaulte of the muſcle which maketh faſt the eie,Definition. med. compaſſing the loweſt part of the ſinewe of ſight yet the latter anatomiſtes haue not founde this muſcle in menne,Later anatomiſts diſſent from Galen.
                            neither haue I obſerued it, albeit in Oxen it is moſt euident. Therefore I iudge the cauſe of this trembling to come not from the weakeneſſe of one, but rather of all the muſcles.

If the whole eie be looſed it is hardly cured eſpecially in olde folke: if it bee naturall it is vtterly incurable.

And vvhere there is hope, you muſt doe as followeth. The ſicke muſt eſchew ſtrong wines, vaporous &amp; groſſe meates, vſing ſuch onely, vvhich are eaſily digeſted, and make the humours thinne: if the partie be of a good complexion hee ſhalbee let blood in the arme, thē being prepared with cliſters, he ſhalbe purged, afterward let him vſe to chewe certaine proper remedies in his mouth, and haue others put into his noſe to drawe dovvne the matter, and vſe vomite faſting, yet without great conſtraint, &amp; alſo hauing bound the eye before leaſt it might ſtart forth thorough the vehement vomiting.

In the particular cure the eye ſhalbe bathed with ſuch herbes as are good for the ſinewes, hauing vertue partly to comfort,A tried remedie. partly to make thinne, and let a plaiſter or cataplaſme bee layd vpon it made of the ſame hearbes putting to it a little caſtoreum carefully prouiding

                           LAgopthalmos is when the higher eielidde is ſo dravven backe, that in ſhutting the eie, the vvhole is not nor cannot be couered vvholy, and in ſleepe it is open, as vvee ſee Hares doe ſleepe.Three kindes thereof. There are three kindes thereof according to Auicen: the firſt is, vvhen the eie-lidde being dravven backe, couereth

not the vvhite of the eie, vvhich cōmeth either from the firſt frame of it, or by inciſion made in the aforeſaide eie-lidde, and this is called leporinus, that is the hares-eie. The ſecond kinde is when one part of the white is not couered, and thereupon ariſeth abbreuiatio that is ſhortnes, which hath the ſame cauſes vvith the former. The third is, when the higher eie-lidde toucheth not, nor couereth the lower, which proceedeth eyther of ſome kernell, or outgrovving of fleſh, or by a conuulſion of the ſame eye-lid. Beſide the afore-named cauſes,Cauſes. this diſeaſe may come ſometime by the cloſing vp or as it is commonly called, cicatrizing of a wound or vlcer, and that, eyther vvhere the vlcer doth it of it ſelfe, as in a carbuncle, or after the eye-lid is verie much cut, and ſo ouer much looſed, or becauſe it hath beene lifted vp by cutting, or hath bene cauterized or feared vnaduiſedly. Cōcerning the cure,Cure. if the eye-lid be too ſhort, it is vnpoſſible to recouer it by any kind of cure or operation: If it vvant but a little, it maye be amended and reſtored in this manner, vvhen you haue felt the ſicke partie

The deepeneſſe of the inciſion muſt enter to the griſtle, yet not touch it: For if it be cut, the ey-lid falleth down, and afterward cannot be lifted vp. You ſhall make ſeperation of the edges in the inciſion vvith ſcraped lynt, to the ende that the eye-lid may fall downe, and return equally to his former ſhape and greatneſſe, as alſo to ſtay the diuided skinne from reioyning, cauſing a little fleſhe to growe and fill vp that place, that afterward the eye maye bee eaſily and conueniently opened.

                           ECtropium is,Definition. when the lovver eye-lid turneth the inſide out, &amp; draweth ſo much backe, that it couereth not the vvhite of the eye, nor is ioyned to the other eye-lid which is aboue. This affection is not naturall, but hath growne from too much looſing medicines,Cauſes. or from ſuperfluous fleſh which hath growne in the inner parte of it: or rather, as Aetius ſayth,Aetius. when the fleſh in the corner of the eye is increaſed and ouergrowne: or by cutting avvay too much of the skinne in a palſey, labouring by that meanes to make it ſhorter: in like manner, burning, cicatrizing, or cutting in the outwarde parte of the eye-lid, maye bring this fault▪ and old-age alſo maye procure it. The cure muſt be diuers,Cure. as the cauſes are diuers requiring rather the hande of the Chirurgian then medicines: If then it proceede from

the ouergrovving of fleſhe, and the ſame be little and tender, it may be abated and conſumed with medicines properly affected to take away fleſh, if it be olde and drie it ſhalbe cut avvay. The operation ſhalbee in this order. Take a needle vvith threade in it, and put it thorough the lovveſt part of the fleſhe which grovveth out, then vvith the ſame threade lift it vp, and the eie-lidde with it, and with the point of a penknife cutte it by little and little, or with a crooked vauſe, you may cutte it all at once if you canne, but take heede leaſt you rake any part of the eie-lidde avvay. If the eie-lidde recouer his naturall faſhion, and returning invvard doe couer the eie, vve will be content therewith vſing onely medicins, ſomewhat a ſtringent to cloſe vp that which is cutte away, and to preuent paine and inflammation: but if it fall backe, and returne to the former diſorder,An other way of inciſion. thē muſt tvvo ouertvvhart inciſions bee made gently in the innermoſt part of the eie-lidde, which ſhall beginne in the middeſt and lovver part of it, being drawen both ouerthwartly, one to the great corner, the other to the ſeſſe, nigh

vnto the eie-lidde, and hauuing gathered both together there vvill bee taken avvay a little piece like vnto the great letter of the Graecians named Λ, being notvvithſtanding carefull to auoide cutting of the skinne in ſuche manner: Let the poynt of it be to the lower part and bottome of the eye, &amp; the larger open parte ariſe and aſcende tovvardes the eye-lid. Nowe if this default haue proceeded from inciſion, burning, ſearing, cicatrizing in the eye lidde, which hath not beene vvell and cunningly performed, then muſt inciſion be made of the skinne in the outvvarde parte, not farre from the eye-lidde, which beginning at one corner of the eye ſhall ende at the other, in forme of a croſſe, making ſeperatiōs of the edges vvith lint put betwene them leaſt they ſhould ioyne againe. But if it proceede from olde-age, or of too much looſing, all that which is looſe muſt be outvvardly ſeared, eyther with a fine inſtrument, vvhich kinde is called Cauterium actuale, or with a medicine which is called Cauterium potentiale, with great care that you touch not the eye.

But if the bladder be cut it procureth great payn, becauſe it ſendeth foorth his moyſture, vvhich being thinne and ſmall, or as it vvere

                           TRichiaſis is,Definition. when the haires which growe either naturally or vnnaturally on the eye-liddes, doe hurte and pricke the eye, and cauſe vveeping. The old writers haue left vnto vs three kinds of them, vvhereof the firſt is named ptiloſis, vvhich is,Ptiloſis. vvhē the eyelid is looſe, &amp; the natural haire falleth round

about into the eie, and pricketh it. The ſecond is called diſtrichiaſis,
                           Diſtrichiaſis. or duplex ordo pilorum, that is, a double order or ſet of haire, when one hurteth the other as contrary aduerſaries. The third is called phalangoſis,
                           Phalangóſis. or acies pilorum, that is, rankes of haire, when the edge of the eie-lidde with the haire which is vpon it without any relaxation of the eie-lidde is turned and wreſted into the eie, in ſuche manner that the hayre is hidde, neither can it bee ſeene without the eielidde be lifted on high.Cauſes. The cauſe of this vnnaturall generation of haire, proceedeth of the abundance of ſuperfluous moiſture, which neuertheleſſe is not ſharpe nor biting, euen as the earth being ouer moiſte bringeth foorth plentie of hearbes. For if the humor were ſharpe or in anye manner fretting, by remaining in the eie-lidde it would de file and corrupte the hayre, which nature had there planted. It migt alſo cauſe by increaſing and long continuance a looſeneſſe in the eye-lids. Concerning the cure, if the haires bee vnnaturall which growe there,Cvre. let them be pulled away with pincers, and afterward applye ſuche medicines as

may ſtay them from grovving againe: of this ſort, are antes egges, the gall of a calfe, the bloud of al ſorts of frogs: amōgſt other, rhis of Archigenes is praiſed vvonderfully,

I confeſſe I haue not ſeen anie tryal of theſe remedies, and therefore, after the eye is turned vvhere they ſticke, the beſte courſe is, to ſeare them to the rootes vvith an yron made for that purpoſe, for this vvill vtterly deſtroy them. This done, apply ſuch remedies as may preuent inflammation, &amp; the eſcarre being once remoued, the vlcer vvil heale eaſilye. In this order ſhall you deale vvith thoſe haires vvhich grovve naturally, if their turning invvarde offend the eyes. But before you come to ſeare the place, you muſt labour to gather and tie vp the haires, vvhich you ſhall doe more conueniently, if you knitte them vvith other haire vvhich is neare to them, by a plaiſter framed after the manner of drie ſtitching. VVhen al are thus gathered and made faſte to the outvvarde parte, let them ſo abyde a good ſpace, that they may not returne

into the eie, but receiue another ſhape: But if the edge of the eye-lidde be alſo turned inward, yet the eye-lidde not looſed, there muſt be inciſion made on the inſide in a ſtraight forme or line, that by this meanes the skinne may be ſeperated and let looſe,The cure of the olde Phiſitions. which did draw the eye-lidde inwarde, and the hayre ioyntlie with the ſame may looke vpwarde.

he lifte them vp vvith his hande, vvhich is the cauſe that they vvhich are in this miſerable eſtate, cannot avvake, nor ſee plainly.Cauſes. This maladie commeth by the abundance of moyſture vvhich ſofteneth and looſeth the eye-lidde, vvhich is ſtretched further then the boundes of nature, ſo that vvhen one vvould by the benefite of the muſcles lift vp his eye-lidde, and open his eye, hee cannot doe it fully, becauſe of the vveakeneſſe and looſeneſſe.Cure. The cure muſt bee in this order. VVhen the Chirurgian hath placed the patient to his liking, hee ſhall take betvveene his fingers the skinne of the eye lidde (leauing the griſtle, vvhich, ſith it is not looſed,The griſtle muſt not be cutte. needeth not inciſion) lifting vp ſo much of it as hee ſhall thinke expedient in the reſtoring of the naturall forme to bee taken avvay. For there are tvvoo daungers: one, leaſt too much bee cutte avvaye, for then the eye-lidde will not couer the vvhole eye: the other leaſt too little bee cutte, for then your labour is loſte, and the inciſion vtterly vnprofitable.
                        Therefore in this conſideration,

it ſhall be neceſſary to marke the place vvith incke, dravving tvvoo ſtraight lines vvhere the inciſion ſhall be made In this order, that betvvene the edge vvhere the haires doe grovve, and the neareſt of your lines, there be ſpace remaining to thruſt in a needle.Celſus.
                        
                        This done, you ſhal cut gently, pearcing the skin vvhich is betvvene the tvvo lines,One kinde of inciſion. vvhich may bee done all at once, holding vvith the fingers, and lifting vp ſo much of the eye-lidde as you vvil cut avvaye: aftervvard vvith a penknife, launcet, or ciſers cut directly vpon the tvvo lines, taking avvaye the piece vvhich is in the middeſt: or rather make your inciſion vppon eche line ſo long as is requiſite,An other kind of inciſion. and cutte avvay that vvhich is in the middeſt, beginning at one ende, and gently remouing the skinne vntill you come to the other, and all be cleane taken avvaye. Hauing proceeded thus farre, you ſhal then ioyne both ſides of the vvounde vvith a needle put into the middeſt, vvhich ſhal not be vvholy and ſodainly ſtaied, but commaund the pacient to cloſe his eies, and if the eyelid come not dovvne to couer all the eye, let

the point of the needle ſlippe, if it doe couer all, make it faſt: &amp; in vvhat part the skinne of the eye-lid ſhall bee yet too large, there take avvay your thread vvhich is in the higher lippe of the vvound, and cut avvay ſo much of it as you ſee needefull,How to ſtitch then thruſt thorovve the thread againe, and dravve together both the lips or edgcs of the vvounde: and aftervvard at both the endes put thorovv the needle. This part of your vvorke thus finiſhed, you ſhal then applie a defenſiue, and alſo a medicine, vvhich may ioyne the contînuitie diſſolued.

In the cure,Cure. the skinne of the eye-lidde muſt be cut euen to the bladder which keepeth the humor, and if it be poſſible it muſt bee wholy together taken out: for if anye parte remaine, the diſeaſe returneth.

Some of them ſticke not to the eie in euerie place, but hold onely by their edges, ſo that betvveene the nayle and the eye an inſtrument may be put thorowe.Cauſes. The cauſe is a fulneſſe in the heade, ſpecially of thinne bloud myngled with ſalte fleume, and weakneſſe in the eye, vvhich maketh it fitte to receiue theſe humors.

In ſome bodies it is engendred thorow the coldenes of the time and place, as in olde men which abound with ſalte fleume, or in an intemperate perſon. which drinketh ſo much that he quencheth natural heat: the coldeneſſe of the time and place doe increaſe it, when they which are ouerladen with ſuch humors, by colde doe multiply and ſtirre vp the coutſe therof. If the ſtreame of humors bee outwarde,Signes to know the courſe of the humors. the veines ſeeme redde and great, there is an obſcure darkeneſſe like to ſmoke vppon the horny membrane, the checkes are redde, and the diſeaſe verie much lifted vp aboue the white of the eye, there is great payne and heate on the browes, and the skin named Sebel, groweth in ſome parte of the eye-lidde. If the courſe of humors be inward, the veines are not ſo thicke and redde, the partie neeſeth oft, ſpecially if he bee in the ſunne, hee feeleth great itching, the eye ſendeth foorth teares. This diſeaſe, and principally Sebel,
                           
is ioyned with itching, boyling, reddeneſſe, vlcers, teares, ſwelling of the eye-liddes, ſlowe motion of the eye: it ſo hindereth the ſight, that the partie cannot abide the light any long time. The cure is both long and hard.Praedictions. For ſome are neuer healed, other haue it by inheritance,Auicen. and in certaine it is contagious, yea (Auicen ſayth) it goeth from one eye to the other. That kinde vvhich is vvhite,VVhich be curable or incurable. and narrowe at the bottome, is eaſily cured, eſpecially if it ſticke not faſt in euerie place, but that vvhich hath none of theſe qualities can hardly be healed. There is no dealing vvith a nayle or vvebbe which is thicke, ſtanding foorth, hard, and by conſent cauſing paines in the temples: for this is malicious, and of a cancrous nature.

At this ſame time let the Chirurgian with a paire of pincers,Celſus. or ſome fitte inſtrument lifte vp the web, and with the other hande thruſt thorovve a needle with threade vnder the vvebbe, cloſe by the membrane, wherunto it is faſt ioyned: and leauing the needle there, hee ſhall take both the endes of the threade which is paſſed thorovv and by them lifte vp the web:Howe to ſeperate the web. if it ſticke faſt in any parte hee ſhall ſeperate it with the poynte of a vauſe, or ciſers, or ſome ſuche ſharpe, fine, and delicate inſtrument, vviping avvaye the bloud iſſuing from it at the ſame inſtaunt, vntill hee ſee the veynes of the vvebbe decayed and conſumed by the auoyding of this bloud: continuing his worke vntill hee come to the corner: and marke hovv oft he dravveth the threade, ſo oft ſhall hee looſe it, vntill hee attaine to the beginning of the vvebbe, and the ende of the naturall fleſh reſting in the corner.Two inconueniences.

vvhen the threade is paſſed thorovve, he ſhall cut off the needle, that there may be tvvoo endes of the threade in the ſame place, and take twoo endes thereof in one hande, and twoo in an other. This done, hee ſhall knit one of the threads on a faſt common knot, &amp; after-ward with a running knot to the end it maye bee more eaſily looſed at your pleaſure: according to this manner you ſhall tie the other threade.

They which are troubled with this diſeaſe,Signes. thinke euerie thing vvhich they ſee to be greater then it is, which errour commeth by the ſcattering of the ſpirites at the largeneſſe of the hole in the apple of the eye. Sometime it is not onely inlarged and ſtretched abroad, but it ſeemeth to be remooued from the middeſt of the eye, and to haue chaunged his place, which in Arnoldus is called, pupillae e loco remotio.
                           Pupillae e loco remotio. Novv both theſe diſeaſes happen eyther naturally, or of ſome other cauſe. If they be naturall and from the birth,Cauſes. yet they hurt &amp; hinder the ſight. If any other cauſe haue procured them, it is either outwarde, as by a fall, or ſtroke: or invvarde by a recourſe of humours, vvhich falling dovvne by little and little, do cauſe the membrane vuea to be ſtretched out, where-vpon enſueth the enlarging of the apple of the eye. This

diſeaſe is hardly cured,Praedictions. becauſe the coat vuea beeing much ſtretched foorth by his skinnie nature in continuaunce of time becommeth ſo harde,Blacke eyes haue the apple of the eye great. that it cannot be afterward eaſily dravvne ſtrayter. They, whoſe eyes are naturally blacke, haue alſo the apple of their eye great, and for this cauſe doe eaſily incurre this inconuenience. Some ſee verie well, although they haue this default from their byrth.Cure. Concerning the cure, it is generall in good dyet, purging, cupping, rubbing, bloud letting, both in the arme and corners of the eye, or particular in the vſe of binding, and ſtrengthening medicines, as fomentations and ſalues made ex roſis, croco, nardo, thuris cortice, pompholyge, ſpodio, acatia, being prouident to auoyde ſharpe medicines, becauſe they drawe downe great abundaunce of humours,Obſeruations. vvhich ſtill make the apple of the eye broader.

This default (ſayth Auicen) maye be in it from the firſt beginning,Little eies haue quicke, ſight. but they vvhich haue the apple of the eye ſo little haue their ſight moſte ſharpe and quicke. VVhen this affection is not naturall,Cauſes. it may grovve by the dryneſſe of the membrane vuea, vvhich is withered and drawne together, or by aboundaunce of moyſture deſcending

vpon the ſame, which maketh the edges and borders of the hole ſo large, that they touch ech other, and ſo it is made narrovve: euen as wee ſee in a ſieue made of parchment, the vvhich being wette, the holes thereof are cloſed vp. Moreouer the dryneſſe of the wateriſh humour may procure this diſeaſe, which beeing dried becommeth leſſe, and thereby is the coat that couereth it made narrower.VVeakenes of fight cauſeth all thinges to ſeeme greater then they are. It may alſo be engendred thorow great weakneſſe and extreme ach of the head. To them which are thus affected, all thinges appeare greater then they are of their owne nature: and in truth in alweakeneſſe of the ſight, the obiects are more great in ſhow, but not ſo plainely diſcerned: which errour happeneth by the littleneſſe of the apple of the eye.Cure. This order muſt bee obſerued in the cure: If moyſture haue brought forth this maladie, it ſhall bee cured by contrary medicines. It is profitable to rub the partes aboue it, and alſo the eyes with the fingers, to vvaſh the face and head, to rub it, and anointe it with oile of flower-deluce.

From the quantitie, when it is whole, couering all the compaſſe of the apple of the eie, in ſuch ſorte, that the partie cannot ſee any thing. Sometimes it couereth onely halfe of the apple of the eie,How it commeth to paſſe that onely ſome part of the obiectis ſeene or ſome part of it either aboue or beneath, or in the middeſt in ſuch maner that that onely part of the thing before our face can be diſcerned which is placed againſt the part of the eie which is free from this diſeaſe, whereby it falleth out oftentimes, that either the partie ſeeth nothing, or onely ſome part of thinges. For if that which is offered to the ſight be ſet before the part affected fully, he ſeeth nothing, but if hee prie at it with that part of the eie which is ſounde he may ſee clearely.

                           Fernelius thinketh the cauſe thereof to bee a courſe of humors deſcending by little and little vpon the ſinewe of the ſight, which in the beginning cannot be perceiued:A cataract engendred in one day. notvvithſtanding hee boldly affirmeth to haue ſeene a cataract made &amp; framed in one day. For (ſaith he) if at one moment a groſſe ſlimie humour maye fall vpon the ſinevve of ſight, wheruppon enſueth the loſſe of the vvhole ſight, why maye it not ſodainly ingender

a perfect cataract, hauing before time had recourſe vppon the apple of the eye?Signes of the cataract beginning.

VVhen theſe thinges doe thus fall out, if you looke vpon the apple of the eye, it appeareth cleare and pure, but if you beholde and vievve it more nearely, it will ſeeme ſomevvhat troubled, and if you compare it with the other eye which is ſound, it vvil appeare ſomevvhat appalled.Predictions

Concerning praedictions, and foretelling of the euent which vvil enſue, thoſe vvhich are like to ruſtie iron or pearles, or haue a greene or aſhe colour or reſemble a turquoiſe, or ſea water, are fit to be couched: on the contrary, thoſe vvhich are like to chalke, lead, citrons, blacke or yelowe, cannot

be couched with a needle.

But if it bee ſcattered into pieces when it is ſpreadde abroade, it is not yet ready nor fitte to bee couched. Neither may you deale vvith that vvhich is not ſtretched forth in breadth and largeneſſe, ſith it is an euident ſigne that the ſinevve of ſight is ſtopped, vvhereby the ſpirite vvhich cauſeth ſight ſhoulde bee conuayed forth as vvith a blaſt made larger: for it is but loſt labour ſith hee coulde not ſee any thing albeit that vvere remooued.How to know if the ſinew of ſight bee ſtopped. Thus you maye make proofe hereof, if the eie being ſhutte hee rubbe gently vpon the eie-lidde vvith his fingers turning it ſometyme to this ſide, ſometyme ot that, and then lifting vppe the eie-lidde ſodainely, conſider, if the cataract doe ſpreadde abroade and returne againe preſently or not. The ſame obſeruation you maye take by

cloſing the other eie wherein is no cataract: for in thus doing you ſhall perceiue the ſpirites inlarged in that which ought to haue beene caried to both the eies.

Novve when the needle is thruſt through, it muſt be ſtaied on the the top of the cataract, &amp; by little and little turned gently to bring the cataract toward the loweſt part of the apple of the eie: &amp; whē it is couched there, you ſhall preſſe it

downe very hard, that it may abyde in that place. If it doe remaine there, the cure is perfect, if it aſcend vp again, thē with the ſame needle breake and cut it into many peeces, which wil cauſe leſſe hindrance, and require leſſe roome. After this draw out the needle, &amp; lay with in the eie the white of an egge, vvith a linnen cloth folded together, and with out apply ſomthing to preuent inflammation, with a roller binding it vp.

                           GLaucoma is vſed in two ſences: for it is taken vnproperly for a webbe cataract or ſpot which is gathered and dried round about the apple of the eie: which ſignification ſome of the olde phiſitions haue vſed this worde as Aegineta writeth ſaying, the auncient writers haue ſuppoſed Glaucoma and hypochyma to bee one and the ſame diſeaſe,Aegineta. which haue beene onely diſtinguiſhed by the new writers.Galen. Neither doth Galen much diſcent from this opinion, affirming glaucoma to be like to the webbe or cataract, and that both of them may bee comprehended vnder the ſame name.Gorraus. Neuertheleſſe

(as Gorraeus ſayth) it foloweth not that they are like. For the cataract is a collection and an heape of other humors, then of thoſe vvhiche are naturally in the eye, flovving vnto it from ſome other place: but glaucoma is properlye vſed when the Criſtaline humor is dry and thicke,The difference between glaucoma and hipo

Moreouer, the cataractes are alvvaies ſo greate that they ouerſpreade and couer the vvhole apple of the eie, and hinder the vvholeſight: but glaucoma poſſeſſeth all the Chriſtaline humour, and it is drie in euery part, and by reaſon of the drineſſe it grovveth ſo thicke. Beſides theſe, cataractes may be cured, but Glaucoma is vncurable, when it hath once attained to perfection as Aegineta writeth concerning the opinion of Ruſus.

Some haue imagined that a greene colour intermedled with the Cryſtalline humour cauſeth this diſeaſe, and maketh this gray or azure color called glaucoma.

Of this there are two ſorts. The one is moſt commonly tender, looſe,Two kindes without pain, red in color, yelding eaſilie to medicines. The other is malicious, hard, rugged blewiſh, hauing pricking pain, not relenting by medicines but is only curable by the hand of the Chirurgyan. There are three principall cauſes of this maladie, The firſt is a flowing,Three cauſes and an heap of melancholicke humors, vvhich make the fleſh in the corner of the eie groſſe, as we ſee it in warts. The ſecond is, vvhen the fleſh grovveth out through ill handling of an vlcer vvhich hath beene in that place. The thirde is the remainder of a nayle or vvebbe, vvhich vvas not fully taken avvay, and therefore hath grovven and encreaſed vnto a more groſſe nature.

                           RHaeas is a diminiſhing or conſūptiō of the fleſh which naturally groweth in the corner of the eye with continual greeuous vveeping. It ariſeth either

by ill curing of the vveb, fiſtula, or encanthis,
                           Cauſes. vvhen too much of the glandulous fleſh or kernels vvhich grovvin that place is cut avvay or conſumed by medicines. For hereuppon the teares cannot be ſtayed, but the eye ſemeth to vveep alvvaies, yea the cheekes are continually vvet vvith the teares.A double vſe of the glandulous fleſh. For ſeing ther is a double vſe of this glandulous fleſhe or kernels, vvhereof the firſt is to ſtop the hole in the corner of the eye vvhiche hath paſſage into the noſe▪ leaſt the excrements vvhich diſcēd from the forepart of the brain vpon the bon called as cribroſum becauſe it reſembleth a ſieue ſhuld run into the eye, and it preuenteth the violent carriage of aire into the eye therby, vvhen we blow or ſnuff, or any way clenſe the noſe of that filth which is in it The ſeconde vſe is to couer the little corner conduit in the corner of the eye, by the which the excrements and naturall ſuperfluities are conuayed into the noſe. This excrement is a thin liquid humor which floweth out in weping, or laughing, and whenſoeuer the braine doth diſburden it ſelfe of theſe ſuperfluities. If this humour bee not muche in

quantitie, and commendable in quality, then the kernels do receiue, retaine and keepe it,The eye muſt be kept moiſt. to ſprincle it vpon the eie (as is the office of other glandulous fleſhe or kernels placed at thee root of the tongue) to keep it moiſt, and make it moue more eaſily, which it could not doe if it were very drie, and it coulde not but bee very drye, ſith it is moued continually, whereby it is made hoate. But if this humor contained in the kernels offend either in quantity, or quality, it bringeth forth vlcers, teares, and other diſeaſes before ſet downe. Now when too much of the fleſh is taken away, either by cutting, ſearing, or corroſiue medicines, there is made not onely a ſcarre in the place, but alſo the hole entring into the noſe remaineth open, thorough the which the excrementes of the braine fall without any hinderance vpon the eie, which procureth continuall weeping.Cure. In curing hereof ſome vſe binding medicines to the end they may ſtoppe the hole, and cut of the paſſage: others ſcarrifie the ſkinne, round about, with incarnatiue medicines (as they call them) labouring to reſtore, and ingender newe fleſhe

in place of the former whiche was decayed: and when it is growen ſufficientlye they cloſe it vppe and make it dry. But becauſe this kinde of cure is both harde and daungerous,An hard and daungerous cure. manye content themſelues with cloſing vp of the hole, not regarding the reſtoring of new fleſh. Theſe men force not the manifolde diſcōmodities which ſpring by ſtopping of the eie. For firſt the paſſage of ordinary excrementes vnto the eie is debarred. Secondly,Aninconuenient cure. ſith the cicatrice is none other thing but hard dryed fleſhe, by reaſon of the thickeneſſe therof it is not able to receiue &amp; drink vp theſe ſuperfluities: hereupon enſueth cōtinuall teares dropping from the eies. Therfore in regard of this inconuenience it is more expedient to adventure the generation of newe fleſhe, then onely to cloſe vp the vlcer.

                           AMauroſis moſt commonly is a hinderance of the whole ſight,Definition. without any appearance therof in the eie: for the apple of the eie remaineth ſounde, and vnchanged the ſinewe of ſight onely is ſtopped.

And ſome haue thought the difference of theſe two to conſiſt onelye in this, that the cauſes of ambliopia are leſſe, but the cauſes of amauroſis are greater and ſtronger. Now the cauſe of that which commeth altogether ſodainly, and (as we ſay) at one puſh which is rightly called amauroſis is when the ſinew of ſight is filled &amp; ſtuffed with thick ſlimy humors falling into the hollowneſſe of it, which will not ſuffer the ſpirit of ſight to be conuayed therby into the eye.How to know if the ſinew of ſight be ſtopped. The way to knovv the ſtopping of the ſinevv of ſight, and that no ſpirite can paſſ thorow it is this Shut the other eie, &amp; the apple of that eie which is ſtopped will not appear to be enlarged, vvhiche it vvould be if the ſpirite of ſight were conuaied thereto by the ſinewe: for this ſpirite doth as it were with a blaſt make the apple of the eie broader. Therfore where this is not apparaunt, you muſt iudge either the

ſinevve to bee ſtopped, or rather that the braine is not able to ſend ſpirits to this ſinevve vvhiche maye happen by vveakeneſſe thereof, grovving of long ſickneſſe trouble, or old age, vvhereby the ſpirits are vvaſted &amp; ſcattered.Praecedent cauſes. The forerunners and as it vvere outvvarde cauſes of this diſeaſe are much ravvnes or ill diſgeſtion, drinking of pure vvine, great heat of the ſonne, or colde on the head, continuall reading, bathes after meat, vomiting, immoderate company vvith vvomen, holding in of the breath as vvee ſee in trumpeters: for all theſe things fill the heade vvith vapours.

                           Paremptoſis is vvhen the ſinevve of ſighte is ſtopped by meanes of ſomme humoure vvhiche flovveth into the ſame, becauſe the ſinevve gapeth and ſeemeth as it were

clouen or chincked. The vvaye to diſcerne and diſtinguiſh one of them frō the other is this. If it be vtterly brokē as in aporexis, and ſeperated from the braine,now to diſcerne aporrexis from paremptoſis. by a ſtroake or fall on the head, firſt the eie is thruſt forth, aftervvard it ſinketh in deepe, then it receiueth no nouriſhment as it ſhoulde, the ſight is vvholy loſt vvithout any recouery: and if one of the ſecond paire of ſinevvs be broken, the eie hath neither ſence, not moouing, but abideth fixed in the circle. But vvhen this ſinevve of ſight doth onely gape ſeeming to bee clouen, and as it vvere rent, the eie remaineth in the place, and the ſicke partie ſeeth (as vve ſay) by fits, eſpecially in ſhort time after, vvhen ſome parte of the humour which vvas entred into the eie is reſolued and diſperſed, the ſinevv is ſtrengthened, &amp; in ſome part ioyned againe. Concerning the cure,Cure. the Chirurgian ſhall haue more care to maintaine and preſerue the beauty of the eie, then to endeuour the reſtoring of the ſight vvhich is vtterly loſt. And it is to bee feared leaſt ſome great courſe of humors, paine, or inflammation, do come

vnto the eies, vvhereby they maye bee cōſtrained either to fall out of the head or to burſt aſunder, as vve haue vvritten before. Therefore to auoid and eſchevve the returning againe thereof, you ſhall haue recourſe both to generall and particular medicins vvhich are able to ſtay and heale the aforeſaid inconueniences vvhenſoeuer they ſhall happen.
                        WHen I hadde finiſhed this my treatiſe to be printed, I receiued a letter from Mounſieur le Ieune Chirurgian to the king, and to my Lorde the Duke of Guiſe, a manne muche trauailed and experienced in Chirurgery: the Copy whereof I haue thought good to adde in the ende of this my booke becauſe the diſeaſe of the eie whereof hee hath written vnto me is very ſtrange and rare.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  The Copie of the Letter.
                  
                     FOR aſmuch as I vnderſtande that you haue written a litle treatiſe touching the diſeaſes of the eye, wherein you haue compriſed not onely whatſoeuer the aūtient writers cold affoord, but alſo what by your owne obſeruation your ſelfe hath learned: I thought it expedient to aduertiſe you, that in this place not many dayes paſt, one of our houſe came vnto mee troubled with a diſeaſe in the eye in this order. There are vpon the membrane coniunctiua or white of

the eye little beaſts, like vnto little lice, or great wormes in the handes, which cauſe ſo vehement itching, that vvhen the partie is troubled therewith, hee become vnpatient, rubbing his eye without ceaſing. I laboured to cure it by thoſe meanes which the olde writers haue ſet down in Ptheriaſis, but I preuayled eyther nothing or little. Therfore the aforeſayd patient addreſſed him ſelfe to goe to a woman dwelling about Ioynuille, who in my preſence with a ſiluer needle tooke awaye very cunningly and with ſmal pain the wormes or the nits from the membrane: And vnleſſe I had ſeen them go, I ſhould ſcarcely haue bene perſwaded that ſuch vermine could be engendred on the white of the eye.

The woman auouched to me that ſhee hadde taken the like from manye others at diuers times without any hurt enſuing, and that many in this part the country were ſubiect to the like maladie, which thing by diligent inquiſition I haue prooued true.
                  
                     Fare you well.

                  ¶ To the courteous and carefull Chyrurgian.
                  
                     THis Treatiſe of the Scorby, hath bene a long time prepared for thee, but it wanted a prosperous gale of winde. Perhaps delaye may b

Surely, others gaine, is not my grief, but I am ſory that I cannot alſo preſent them to thee. I hope a better furniſhed leaſure and skill wil ſhortly impart to thee this benefite. In the meane time, haue Wyers paynes, in high price, which are not inferiour to others. Ronſleus and Langius wade into deep difficulties, fitter for a learned cenſurer, then a plaine practiſer.

                     Ecthius paynteth out the ſignes, and poynteth to the cure▪ but affordeth not the pith and marow of ſpeciall medicines: The other Treatiſe which is of the canker, was painfully weaued by Textor: who (in mine opinion) diſcouereth the deceipt of Penelopes webbe. For the crabbed vlcer craueth helpe, hut accepteth none, as the matrone euer laboured, neuer ended her worke. Neuertheleſſe as her webbe deluded her ſutors, and ſupported the hope of Vlyſſes returne: So this crooked Caecilius may receiue often eaſe of payne, though none end of grief. The authours deſerue commedacion, the interpreter, deſireth friendly acceptaunce, the Printers diſcourage, both.

                  ¶ A diſcourſe of the Scorby tranſlated out of Wyers obſeruations.
                  
                     I He Scorby is a ſtopping of the ſplene hindering thereby the courſe of Melancholy, vvhiche mingling vvith the reſt of the bloud infecteth all the body vvith vile vvaſting corruption, the groſſe part vvhereof falling downe, ſtaineth the legges with ſpots like vnto pomgranats, and the thinner part being carried vp defileth the tender gummes vvith ſharpe fretting and loathſome growing out of the fleſh. It is lawfull for Phiſitions to define and lay opē ſo largely the nature of thinges for the better vnderſtanding of them, although I knovv that amongſt Logicians, theſe thinges wilbe more narrowly ſifted. The name was inuented by the Duchmen vvhiche dvvell nigh

to the Germaine Sea. For Scorbuc in their language ſignifieth burſten belly, as if the ſides and belly (as it commeth to paſſe) vvere affected. In high dutch vvhen the gummes are infected, it is called Scormunt, that is burſten cheekes or mouth, but when the ſignes and tokens thereof appeare in the legges they name it Scorbem, which is broken legs, the Holanders of the ſpots reſembling pomgranates call it blanſchuit. It ſeemeth to bee ſtomacace and ſceletyrbe vvhereof Plinie maketh mention in the 25. booke of his naturall hiſtorye and thirde chapiter in theſe wordes: Neither doe beaſtes onely hurt but ſometimes water and the ſoile where men liue. VVhen the Emperour Germanicus pitched his tents beyonde the Ryuer Rhene in Germanye there was vpon the ſea coaſt one onely ſpring of ſweete water, whereof whoſoeuer had dronke within two yeares ſpace his teeth would fall out, and the ioyntes of his knees would bee looſed. The Phiſitions did call it ſtomacacen and ſceletyrben, to the curing of the which they haue founde out, an hearbe named britannica, which is not onely holeſome

for the ſinewes, but alſo for diſeaſes in the mouth, againſt ſquincyes and ſerpentes, the leaues of it are long and blacke, the root blacke, the iuice of it is preſſed forth both of the leaues and of the roote.
                  The people of frieſland amongſt whom they camped, ſhewed it. This diſeaſe hath hitherto growen worſe &amp; worſe amongeſt them, and the neare inhabitauntes of the ſea, ſpecially amongeſt ſuche as dwell towardes the North. But in theſe latter yeares it hath begun to creep into the countries adioyning (wherein it was neuer heard of before) either through ill dyet, or contagious infection, ſo that it is nowe knowen almoſt in all lowe Germanye: notwithſtanding it is vnknowen in the dominions of high Germany, as in Italy, Fraunce, and Spaine. If this infection may perhappes be in any place of Aſia, or Africa, either that bordereth on the ſea, or there is want of ſweete water, or their dyet and the Aire nouriſheth it. Therefore this diſeaſe is proper to that Region, as to the inhabitaunts of the North partes, and not familiar to all places in the worlde, as is the crevve

of other maladyes. The Nabathaeans whiche dwell in that part of Arabia, whiche for the fruitfulnes is called Arabia Faelix, that is happy Arabia, and the Romanes alſo comming thither in the dayes of Auguſtus Caeſar ſeeme to haue beene troubled with this diſeaſe. For when at his commaundement Aelius Gallus hadde leadde the Romaine Armye into Arabia, hee was conſtrained in the voyage to leaue it in Albo vico whiche is the greateſt market Towne of the Nabathaeans, where they remayned all Sommer, and winter, that they whiche were weake, might recouer their ſtrength.
                  For the Hoaſte was aflicted with diſeaſes in their mouthes and Legges, and other ſickeneſſes incident to that place, in both whiche diſſeaſes there was a diſſolution and looſeneſſe of the Legges, and iavves, vvhiche proceeded from the vvater, and fruites as Strabo vvriteth neare to the ende of his ſixteenth Booke, vvho liued in that ſame tyme. I finde not any proper name, for this diſeaſe amongeſt the Arabians: but either the Greeke

Phiſitions vvhiche then practyſed amongeſt the Romaines, or ſuche as vnderſtanding Latine and beeing alſo cunning in the Greeke tongue folloed and vvayted in the Romaine Armie inuented Greeke Names, from the ſignes and accidentes vvhiche appeared in the mouth and Legges, calling it Stomacaece, of hurting the mouth, and Sceletirbe of hurting and infecting the legs. For the Phiſitions vvhich then attended on the Emperour Germanicus receiued not theſe names from the Hollanders, vvhich ſeeme at that time to haue beene deſtitute of learned Phiſitions, and ſuch as vvere cunning in ſtrange languages, ſo that they vvere not able to giue fitte names in Greeke vnto diſeaſes: but if they hadde any Phiſitions they vvere of their ovvne Country, and very meanely learned. Neither receiued the Phiſitions vvhich follovved Aelius Gallus theſe names from the Arabians or Nabathaeans. Moreouer that diſeaſe which is named Scelotirbe by the Author of the definitions vvhich beare Galens name, is not our Scorbie, ſeeing hee vvriteth that it is a kynde of Palſey, vvhiche

ſuffereth not them whiche haue it to vvalke ſtraight, but ſometime they bovve to the right hande, ſometime to the left, ſometime they dravve their legges after them, not vnlyke thoſe vvhiche goe vppe ſteepe places: his his vvordes are theſe: Scelotirbe is a kinde of Palſie vvherein the Patient cannot goe ſtraight, but novve vvritheth to the right hande, novve to the left, and dravveth his legge after him, as they doe vvhiche aſcende into high places. I ſuppoſe that Marcellus called this diſeaſe Oſcedo becauſe it eateth into the mouth &amp; gums, it is called of others Gingipedium, as it vvere hurting the feete and gummes. Here novv ariſeth a queſtion, vvhether this peſtilence vvere knovven and vvritten of by the olde auncient Greeke and Arabian vvriters of Phiſicke. Albeit ſome doe affirme it to be true, yet I incline to the contrarye, for Auicen Chapt. 3. Fen. 15. tract. 2. Chapt. 2. of the tokens of Apoſtemes in the Spleane rehearſeth a number of ſuche ſignes and accidentes as may bee ſeene in the ſcorbie: Neuertheleſſe he deſcribeth not our ſcorbie though he

come neare vnto it. Hippocrates vvriteth of great Spleanes in ſuche ſorte, that in the ſeconde booke of his Praedictions hee pointeth out certaine markes of the ſcorbie, but our ſcorbie is not layde open vvith a fevve ſignes and tokens vvhiche appeare in the diſeaſes of the Spleane. For hee ſaith, they vvhiche haue great Spleanes are ſubiect to ſoare gummes, and a ſtincking breath, againe vvhoſoeuer haue great Spleanes vvithout bleeding, or a ſtincking breath, they haue vlcers and blacke ſcarres in their legges. Let vs novve vvaigh and examine Hippocrates vvordes. Hee affirmeth that ſuche as haue great Spleanes haue infected and ſtincking gummes, that is one token: then hee addeth. If in ſuche as haue great Spleanes there is neither rotten gummes, nor bleeding, then there ariſe in their legges malignaunt vlcers, and blacke ſcarres. By this it is plaine that Hippocrates iudged both theſe tokens coulde not ioyntly happen in a great Spleane, but that vlcers vvoulde bee then in the legges vvhen the melancholy ſharpe humour vvas either not carried vppe to the

gummes, or vvas diminiſhed by bleeding, and vvhen it ſettleth into the Legges it breedeth filthye Vlcers, and leaueth behynde it blacke Scarres. But in the Scorbie, ioyntlye the Gummes doe rotte and ſtincke, and great blewe ſpottes appeare in the Legges, whiche very ſeldome come to bee an Vlcer.
                  The ſpottes goe before the Vlcers, whiche are very malignaunt, and alſo very rare, neyther is there any mention of theſe ſpottes whiche are alwayes euident in this diſeaſe, but Hippocrates onely ſpeaketh of ſuche ſcartes whiche remayne after all melancholyke Vlcers. It is true they are moſt hardely cured: VVherefore P. Aegineta,

                     Furthermore I haue founde out by longe experience that the Scorbie differeth from the blacke Iaundes, and from the thirde kinde of Volvulus, called by Hippocrates Haematites: and Balduinus Ronſseus, an excellent Phyſition, and my familiar acquayntaunce ſheweth the ſame verrye learnedly, in his excellent Booke intituled De magnis Hippocratis lienibus. Amongeſt the newe writers Olaus Magnus, borne in Svvizerland, ſomewhat ſetteth out the Scorbie, in his hiſtorye of thoſe Nations whiche dwell vnder the North Pole, in his ſiixteenth booke and fiftye one Chapiter, albeit in many places hee is full of forgeries. There is a diſeaſe amongeſt Souldyers vexing ſuche as bee beſieged and ſhut vp, in ſuche ſort, that the fleſhye parts waxe groſſe and ſenceles, conſuming vnder the ſkin as waxe melteth, and when they are preſſed downe with the finger they yeeld. The teeth are ſet on edge, and ready to fal out, the white ſkin hath blewe ſpots, there is a heauy ſluggiſhnes with loathſomnes of medicins, this diſeaſe is commonly called

For it is not ſo full of force and ſtrength, vvhere their vvalls are bourded vvith any kinde of vvood, vvhatſoeuer it bee.

                     The Signes.
                     THe ſignes in the beginning of the diſeaſe are heauineſſe of the whole bodie, ſodaine groſneſſe, ſtraitneſſe about the ſides, and belly, vveakeneſſe in the legs, and ſome coldneſſe with little payne, ſoreneſſe in the iavves, vvith an itching reddeneſſe altered from the naturall colour, the face from paleneſſe chaunging into blevvneſſe: In the increaſing appeare a looſe ſvvellyng, and flovving of bloud from the gummes, rottenneſſe vvith a ſtyncking breath, ſometimes the fleſhe is conſumed to the rootes of the teeth, and they ſhake readye to fall out, there are ſpottes in the legges, not vnlyke the ſpryncklinges of bloud, and almoſt reſembling flea-bitinges, yet ſome-what greater, which may ſome-time be ſeene in the thighes, and diſperſed ouer all the bodye, proceeding of the leſſe groſſer bloud: commonly the ſpots are great,

coloured like to lead, blew, purple, darker then black violets, begotten of the groſſeſt corrupte bloud, which falleth downe that waye, wherefore they ſeldome ſpring in any other places, except the legges And whenſoeuer theſe appeare, they fore-tell moſt certainly, that the Scorby is there, albeit other markes are hidden and ſecrete. Sometime this blewneſſe ſheweth it ſelfe in the iawes, but that is in ſuche, whoſe whole body is drowned in this corruption, that death is nigh at hand. VVhen the diſeaſe groweth worſe and worſe, then there is coldneſſe in the ſinewes of the legges, vnabilitie to walke, the crampe, ſtraightnes of breath, eſpecially when the ſicke partie ſitteth, moueth or is lifted vp: for then he eyther ſowneth, or is neare vnto it, but when hee lyeth, he doth breath more eaſily, and is much refreſhed. Some doe often deſire meate, others haue their appetite decayed. The grieuouſnes of it is obſerued in manye on the fourth and fift day, in the moſt on the third day, in verie fewe euerie day, yet without any euident feuer. Notwithſtanding there is no doubt, but at the ſame time ſome

haue a feuer. For in this diſeaſe, ſome are troubled with a lingting and changing feuer. It ſo falleth out, that there goe before it burning peſtilent feuers, double tertians and I haue ſeene when the Scorby not beeing perfectly cured, a moſt peſtilent quartaine hath enſued, and in the decay of the quartaine, the Scorbie hath againe appeared, which by ſound aduiſe and councell hath beene ouercomed. So thoſe feuers ſeeme not ſo much to be ended in their ſeperation, as to cauſe new diſeaſes worſe then the former, by the weakenes of the bovvels, want of nouriſhment, and the great &amp; filthy corruption of the bloud. Some haue their bellies bounde, ſome looſe. The blewneſſe doth ſo compaſſe all the legges with ſvvelling vnto the feete, that it might bee accompted a token of leproſie. Againe, ſome haue their legges ſo ſmal, that there ſeemeth to be nothing but the ſimple skin couering the bones, vvith greate heate moſte commonly, yet ſometime vvithout heate. Some men haue their ſpots, turning and conſuming into ſcales, as for the moſt part it falleth out in Eriſipelas, others haue them remayning

light, ſmooth, and ſhining, leauing a little print when they are preſſed with the finger. And ſometime (albeit but ſeldome) there appeareth a fulneſſe and ſvvelling of the veynes, ſuche as is to be ſeene in the diſeaſe varix, and vnder the tongue are little veines not vnlike to that, and they are alſo euident in the nether lippe.
                     The pulſe, as in the quartaine feuer, is inconſtant, ſlender, hard, ſwift, weake, altering with the time of the diſeaſe. The vrine or vvater is redde, troubled, thicke, and lyke the lees of nevve redde wine, as alſo it is vſually ſeene in a hoat quartaine, hauing alſo a ſtrong ſmell &amp; ſauour.
                  
                  
                     The Prognoſtications.
                     THe Scorbie is ſometime perceiued to be common in the ſame houſe, becauſe they all haue vſed the ſame dyet: th
                           •
                        refore it is accompted infections, vvhich contagion partly proceedeth by drinking of the ſame cuppe, vvhen the mouth and gummes are infected, partlye corrupte ſpirites are

dravvne in by continuall handling of the ſicke. Sometimes it is receiued as it vvere by inheritance from the parents. Feuers many times do ceaſe &amp; change into this diſeaſe. A conſumption is a moſt common companion of it. Somtimes the dropſie, or flixe, but alvvayes Atrophia, that is, a languiſhing of the bodie, for vvante of nouriſhment waiteth on it.
                     If vlcers ariſe in the legges (whiche are verye rare) they are hardly ioyned togeather, becauſe they are ſtincking, peſtilent, and ſometimes chaunge to a gangrene, ſo corrupte, that they feele not a launcet thruſt into them. Some haue ſounde gummes, albeit fifthy and ſpotted legges, and ſuch doe bleede either at the noſe or mouth. The ſpottes are hidden in many that dye, in others they budde out abundantly after they are dead.
                  
                  
                     Their Diet.
                     LEtte his dyet be of ſuch thinges as maye bee eaſily diſgeſted, hauing good iuyce ſome-vvhat hoate, thinne, piercing, &amp; clenſing, whervnto ad ſuch

as haue ſome force to bind and ſtrengthen. Fried barly, or oates, or barly huſked, and ſodden in pottage, or vvater, then ſtrained vvith vvine, ſmall corains ſodden in ſome broth agreeable therevnto, or in vvater, or vvine, and ſo ſtrained, where-vnto you maye put ſometime the yolke of an egge. If the ſicke partie be thirſtie, he may eate of thoſe rayſens: alſo ſvveet almonds, &amp; a fevv bytter, prepared in a decoction made vvith vvheat, is very profitable. Sometimes ſpices, in regarde of the feblenes of the body, and ſtate of the diſeaſe, are to be mingled vvith his meate, as cynamon, mace, nutmegges, ginger. It is not vnprofitable to eate ſovver grapes. Let his ſauce bee capers, with great raſyns ſteeped in oxiſaccharū, or oximel, which are not to bee ſwallovved before they be chevved verie ſmall. Let his drynke be good ale vvel clarified, ſpecially with vvormevvood, and vvormvvood wine, vvhich is marucilous profitable, if hee be declining to a dropſie. Let him vſe vvith diſcretion the vvhey of mylke: alſo goates milke, or the mylke of kine vvhen it is nevve, in vvhich lette there bee ſodden vvater-creſſes, or garden-creſſes,

vvhich ſome cal winter-creſſes, vvhoſe leaues are broader. Manye vſe vvith good ſucceſſe Scorby-graſſe, ſuch eſpecially as haue bene accuſtomed to eate mylke. Let him bee kept in a drye, warm, cleane, &amp; light chāber, &amp; let him auoide ſorrovve. You ſhall begin your cure vvith bloud-letting, if the body be full of bloud, and the age and ſtrength of the patient can beare it, but let him not bleed much It is beſt and fitteſt to procure the emroodes, to bee purged that vvay. If the ſplene be ſpecially affected, open the ſplene or middle veine in the left arme, but if the liuer be more or as much grieued, then open a veine in the right arme. Now ſeeing the Phiſition is ſeldome called, except the maladie haue taken deepe roote, and preuailed muche, and ſpottes doe appeare in the legges, my counſaile is, to abſtaine from bloud-letting. Purge the bodie gentlye vvith the leaues of ſena Alexandrina, ℥ſ, or ʒ iii or leſſe if you put thereto a little epithimum, vvith a fevve great raſyns, fenell ſeede, &amp; ginger, of each halfe a dram, vvhich vvhen you haue put into a ſufficient quantity of whey, and made hoat, let them ſtand

ſoaking a vvhole night in the ſame: In the morning after you haue agayne made it hoate, ſtrayne out the cleareſt parte, and giue it to him to drinke. Halfe an ounce of this povvder follovving, maye bee in the ſame manner ſteeped and ſtrayned, and then drunke.

If any will giue confectionem Hamech, they muſt haue ſingular regarde to the quantitye, ſith this diſeaſe cannot receyue vehement purging vvythout daunger, becauſe the heart is ſo quicklye hurte The bodie beeyng thus gentlye purged, on the dayes follovving in the morning when manye ſvveate, and at foure of the clocke in the after-noone, hee ſhall take ℥ iiii. of iuyce of the hearbes follovving, putting there to ſome ſugar, and a little cinamon. Take Scorbye graſſe, vvater-creſſes, vvinter-creſſes,

of eache equally beeyng greene, and halfe as muche as of one of them, of brooke lyme, ſtamp them vvith a wodden peſtill in a ſtone morter, and then ſtraine out the iuyce. For theſe haue a ſingular priuiledge, and prerogatiue in reaſon, to pull vp this diſeaſe by the rootes, ſith the three firſt doe cutte, make thynne, and purge by vryne, the fourth bryngeth the other to a iuſte temperature which therfore in reſpect of the bodye, and heate of the diſeaſe, may be increaſed or diminiſhed. They may be ſtamped and ſodden in goates milke, or covves milke, and ſo ſtrayned out and drunke.
                     It is moſte forcible, beeing nevvlye made euerie day. I haue had good ſucceſſe vvhen I did ſeeth the hearbes in vvhey, yet the drinking of the iuyce is to bee preferred. But theſe maye bee chaunged at the diſcretion of a learned and expert Phyſition. I remember they haue beene ſodden not vnfitly vvith redde vvyne. And foraſmuch as the hearbes are full of iuyce, you muſt not put into them muche lyquor, but ſo muche as maye couer them, vvhen they are ſodden.
                     
                        Othervviſe you may ſtampe &amp; ſtraine the iuice vvith other liquor, vvringing them ſtrongly. Common wormewood put vnto it is exceeding profitable, and I haue vvith no ſmall fruite and benefite added fumitorie, and germander. VVhen the bovvels are vveakened, &amp; the ioyntes looſed, then put to it tvvopenny-graſſe. Other men delight to haue a mixture, or a hodge-podge of many other thinges, as of Indyan myrobolanes, mother-vvoort, mayden-haire, ſelandine, betony, hyſſope, agrimony, ſcabious, rootes of valerian, enula campana, ſortell, parſely, pimpernel, cychory, borrage, bugloſſ, aſh, fool-foote, fenell, elder, broome-flovvers, aniſeedes, fenell-ſeeds, lichoras, dodder, tyme, raſyns, biſtortae, corticum radicum capparum, phillitidis, ceterach, tamarices, ſenae Alexandrinae, ſeminum frigidorum, &amp; many others, but I haue had happy cures by vſing a fevv hearbs in good order I vnderſtand many haue bene cured vvith this medicine. Take of the tops of common vvormevvood dryed, iuniper berries beaten to povvder, an. m.i. of goates milke lib.iiii.lette them be ſodden vntill the thirde parte

be conſumed, then ſtraine it, and put thereto a dram of ſaffron in powder, &amp; boyle them againe a walme or tvvoo, and after ſtraine it, giue him a draught of this vvarme thriſe in a daye, in the morning, at three of clocke in the afternoone, and vvhen he goeth to bed. I knewe a vvoman famous for curyng the Scorby, which after the body vvas purged, gaue to the patient this drink. Take of brooke-lime, water-creſſes, of eyther three or foure hand-full, vvhen the hearbes are bruiſed, put thereto of rockat-ſeed, of the roote of the garden flower-deluce, of eache halfe an ounce, ginger two drammes, long pepper one dram, with two pounde of redde wyne, ſtrayne them. Shee gaue them of this drink ſtirred together, euery day in the morning warme, and couering the patient with clothes procured ſweate, ſo beſtowing 9. daies in this cure. In the cuntry of Marchia, the noble matrons drinke brooke-lime, water-creſſes, and aloes beaten together, &amp; ſtrained with milke.

                     Take ſixe quartes of Rheniſh wyne, (euery quart muſt weigh foure pound) foure ounces of the radiſh root nevve, and beaten to povvder in a ſtone morter, lette them ſteepe in a little earthen potte vvyth ſome of the wine, by the ſpace of an hovver, then put this beyng ſtrayned agayne to the reſte of the vvyne: after into an other portion of thys vvyne, put the quantitye of three filberdes of Oxe doonge, and

gooſe doonge, and lette it remayne an houre, then vvryng it foorth, and put it to the other vvyne: This beeing done, take nutmegges, cloues, of eache ʒ ii. beaten ſeuerallye, and bynding them in a lynnen cloath, hang them in the fore-ſaide vvine, and lette this drynke ſtande xxiiii houres. Lette the patient drinke hereof ſo often as hee is thirſtie, neyther lette him vſe anye other drinke vntill hee bee fully ſounde. If neede ſo requyre, this drynke maye bee prepared the ſecond time for him. But he maye not eate ſalte meates, nor rye breade, during the tyme of hys cure.
                     Becauſe Friezeland is full of Bulles and Oxen, and plentifull in geeſe, therfore they prepare their medicines of ſuche thynges as maye bee moſte eaſily gotten It is not to bee doubted, that there is ſo greate heate in gooſedoonge, for it burneth the graſſe vvhere it lyeth, and therefore infuſed in a fitte liquour, it helpeth to procure vtyne, the flowers in vvomen, and ſecond byrth. The afore-named purgations maye bee repeated often in the cure.
                     
                        After-ward on other dayes, lette hym take in the morning the conſerue of Scorby graſſe, or germander mingled togeather, or ſeuerally, to the which ad a borrage, bugloſſe, or enula campana roote preſerued. Heere muſt be noted, that al ſharpe plants vvhich haue force to cutte and make thinne corrupt matter, doe helpe to driue away this maladie, leaſt any man ſhould imagine that either of their hoate ſubſtance, or by ſecrete propertie onely theſe hearbes vvere ſo effectuall, (vvhereof vvee haue ſpoken before, and vvhich are ſo familiarly knowne, I meane Scorby graſſe, vvater-creſſes, brooke lyme) to expell this diſeaſe. Of this ſorte (beſide the aforenamed) are taragon, ſcordiū, ſtone-croppe, all hearbes appropriate to the ſplene, opening rootes, hoat ſeeds, bay berries, iuniper berries, and other of this ſort. Annoynt the ſides, the lefte with this, or the lyke. Take oyle of capars one ounce, the oyntment of bryonie againſt the ſplene halfe an ounce, mingle them. Annoint the righte ſide vvith the oyle of wormewood, vvherein, if neede ſo require, you maye ſeeth the iuyce of the former hearbes.
                     
                        In the meane time lette the looſe ſtinking gummes bee vvaſhed vvith a decoction made of the leaues and barke of barberies, Scorby graſſe, water and vvinter-creſſes, redde roſes vnripe, prepared in vvater, in which iron or ſteele hath bene quenched, to vvhich beeyng ſtrayned, you may put a little allome. In regarde of the taſte and cleanſing, mingle vvith it either vnclarified hony, or hony of roſes, or for the ſurer preſeruation and ſtrengthening of the gums, &amp; delaying of heate conſerue of mulberies. To this purpoſe are profitable the leaues of the vvilde oliue ſtrayned vvith plantaine vvater, and the barke of the ſloe tree.
                     Another vvater to waſh the mouth, may bee thus made. Take a pounde of vvater, ſalte, and allom, of eache tvvo drammes, boyle them together. Alſo take the citron pylle, ſumach, the citron flovvers, of each halfe an ounce, an ounce of raiſyns, ſeeth them in foure pound of rayne-vvater till halfe bee conſumed, and vvhen the lyquor is ſtrayned, put to it tvvo ounces of honye of Roſes, tvvo drammes of allome.

In the meane while ſucke and ſpitte forth the bloudy matter. After waſhe the gummes vvyth a decoction of radicum biſtortae, which is in ſtrength not inferiour to britannica, preſſe out the iuyce of it, as you vvere taught to do in your creſſes, and mingling vvith it the double quantitye of conſerue of Mul-berryes, annoynt the teeth. Or take the iuyce of biſtorta, and honye of roſes, of eache three ounces, ſeeth them vntill the iuyce bee ſpente, put thereto a dramme of allome, make of it a liniment. Vſe this confection.
                     Take of biſtortae ℥ſ ſalte ℈ i. vvyth conſerue of mul-berries, make a conſerue of them togeather. You maye make the lyke of allome, pellitorye of Spayne, and not clarified honye myngled togeather, adding to them a lyttle ſage and olibanum made in powder.

The Fryzians make an other water of two pounde of ale vyneger, halfe an ounce of bole armoniake, ii. drams of allom, iii. ounces of honye, boyling all togeather. The Saxones for the moſt part put to it ſauin. If the rotten ſvvelling of the gummes grow too ranke, cutte ſome part away with your ſciſſers, and conſume the reſt with vnguentum Aegyptiacum, or burnt allome mixed vvith hony of roſes, or ſtaye it vvith oleum vitrieli.

If you wring out of it vvarme ſponges, and applye them to the lovver parts of the legges round about, you ſhall dravve out ſuch ſpottes as lye hidden vnder the skinne, that the manifeſt ſignes of the Scorbye maye ſeeme to flouriſh. Alſo annoynt them vvith this.

There is conſideration to bee had of heate, that ſuche hearbes as are ouer hoate maye be diminiſhed, and brooke-lyme increaſed, and that the decoction bee prepared

The vvaters vvhich are frozen colde, and troubled, thorowe ſnow and yee, are full of ſlime and filthines. They vvhich drinke of them, haue great ſplenes and ſwelled, and their bellyes are harde, ſlender, and hoate, their ſhoulders, necke, and face, are thynne and ſmall. For their fleſh waſteth into the

ſplene, vvhere-vppon they become leane. Such cannot but eate and drinke muche: and ſith they haue both theyr higher and lovver bellye exceedingly hoate, it is requiſite they ſhoulde haue ſtronger medicines. Therefore this diſeaſe is familiar vnto them in vvynter and ſommer. They are alſo ſubiecte to many and incurable dropſies. For ſommer bryngeth foorth manye flixes laſkes and quartaine feuers. And by longe continuaunce theſe diſeaſes leade them into dropſies, and kill them.
                     Theſe are the diſeaſes of Sommer: but winter cauſeth in young men inflammation of the longes, and maddeneſſe, in olde men hoat feuers, becauſe they are bounde in their bellyes: but vvomen are ſvvollen, and ſtuffed vvyth fleume, they conceyue hardly, &amp; bryng foorth paynefully: their children are great and ſvvollen, and thorovve theyr ill nouriſhment, they become deformed, and pyne awaye. They are not ſufficiently purged after their trauaile.
                     Ruptures are incident to children, and ſvvollen veynes called varices, and vlcers in the legges vnto men.

Moreouer vvomen thynke they haue conceyued, but vvhen the tyme of theyr deliueraunce is novve preſente, that burden and fulneſſe vaniſheth avvaye. This proceedeth from vvater vvhere-vvith the vvombe is troubled. And truly I ſuppoſe theſe vvaters to bee vtterly hurtfull.

Thys vvheye is in vertue lyke vnto the thynneſt

part of the bloude whiche is the vrine, and therefore it is ſharpe, hotte, thin, clenſing, opening, mouing vrine, and moſt profitable to the abandoning of this diſeaſe by the teſtimonye of olde writers. For Aetius Amidenus writeth thus out of Galen in his ſecond Booke and 94 chapter. Euery one vſeth ſtronger wheye to thoſe bodies and diſeaſes which haue neede of ſtronger remedies ſpecially in olde bliſters and wheales, and blew ſwellings in the veins, and in all corrupt humors which pierce thorough the skinne, as leproſie, and ſuche like, alſo in old vntamed vlcers, in running ſoares of the head: Moreouer in continually watering eyes, in ſcabs on the eye-liddes, in ſpots on the face, yea in the continuall courſe of feuers, and in them which from a former ſickenes fall into a dropſie. Meſues gaue the firſt place to that whey, which is ſeperated from goates milke, then next to wheye of ſheepes milke, ſaying thus: the watry part of milke is fit matter wherein any thing may be ſteeped and ſoaked, and it is of it ſelfe a ſafe medicine without danger. That is eſteemed beſt which is gathered from the milke of black goats

feeding in good paſtures vvhiche haue lately brought forth their young. It is hoat and dry perfitely in the firſt degree and vnto the ſeconde. Moreouer it hath vertue to make thin, to vvaſhe avvay, to cleanſe, and to purge the belly gently thorough the ſaltnes vvhiche is in it. It expelleth both blacke and yeallovv choler begotten of dried and burnt humours, vvhereby it is maruelous profitable to madde and melancholicke perſons. It is auaileable in the ſtopping of the intrels, and helpeth the diſeaſes that grovve from thence, as dropſies, yeallovv and blacke Iaundies. It maye bee conueniently giuen in Agues proceeding from choler, and in the ſtoppings of the veſſels and bovvells. It ſerueth alſo in diſeaſes proceeding from burnt cholericke humours vvhich ariſe out of the skinne, vvherefore it is fitly and agreeably vſed in tettars, meſſels, ſcuruines, morphevve, leproſie.

                           FOr as much as the nevve cancer beeing a diſeaſe of his own proper nature ſo euill, is not for the moſte parte amongeſt the beſt practized Chyrurgions founde alvvayes to be curable, it ſeemeth not then a thing very muche to bee maruailed at, if the olde and greate canker bee ſo rebellious, that it is not tamed vvith the moſte ſtrongeſt medicynes, no not vvith cutting and ſearing, but rather is ſometimes made farre vvorſe thereby.
                        Notvvithſtanding, ſith this onely remedy remaineth to the perfect Cure thereof, then if the Patient be ſo tormented that hee craue the Surgeons helping hande, and the cancer bee in thoſe partes vvhich may bee cutte and ſeared ſafelye, to the bottome and rootes of it, then (though happely it be found exceeding great) yet is it to be cutte avvay from the ſound parts, and ſo plucked vppe by the rootes. I call the rootes the Veines abounding with melancholicke bloude ſtretched forth rounde about the place.
                        But although wee graunt this manner of Cure to bee greatly commended

of Auicenne and Galen, yet becauſe it is daungerous in a greate and olde Cancer, vvee allovve not ſo raſh proceeding. For that in ſuche kinde of inciſion, it is many times muche to bee feared, that an exceſſiue fluxe of bloud maye follovve becauſe there are large veines and Arteryes in the place: and in ſcaring of them ſome noble part of the body therunto adioyning is hazarded, and ſo both vvayes the lyfe of the partye is in perill. Myne aduyſe is rather to ſtay the malady from growing both by the diet afore ſette down, and alſo by gentle medycines vvherewith many haue contynued vntyll old age, vvythout further vyolence offered to the dyſeaſe. At the leaſtvviſe if no other remedy at all bee thereby attayned, this one good propertie thereby yet enſueth, that by ſuch meanes it is kept cleane from filthye matter.
                        To bee ſhorte their gentle dealyng vvyth this diſeaſe is more ſafe, and free from ſlaunder: on the contrarye, rough and ſharpe medycines exaſperate the maladye and haſten death.
                        For experyence teacheth, that

after a cancer hath bene thus healed, it hath ſhortly after become more fierce not vvithout danger, yea vvith loſſe of life. Neuertheleſſe ſome are not afraid to aduenture this maner of Cure, but vvith vvhat ſucceſſe they ſee. But if cutting bee requiſite, there muſt purging goe before it, by vvhiche meanes vvhatſoeuer is hurtfull and noyſome may be remoued vtterly. After the inciſion if there be fluxe of groaſſe bloud a cauterye is to bee vſed to diſperſe and conſume the reſt of the matter, to ſtrengthen the member, to ſtaye the fluxe of bloude. This done, the Cure is to bee finiſhed according to the order in other Vlcers.

Or if the place vvill abide it, firſt cut it, then feare it to the quicke, and aftervvarde put vpon it cantharides beaten to povvder vvith allome, and oile of cypreſſe, as ſome do

Moreouer of vlcered cancers thoſe onely are cut &amp; ſeared, whiche are in the vppermoſt part of the body, &amp; doe ſo torment the party that he neceſſarily requireth the Surgeons hand, &amp; alſo may be cut away with their rootes.

In three daies ſpace the effect of arſenicum will appeare. After the remouing of the arſenicum the paine is to be aſſwaged, &amp; the falling awaye of the cruſt or eſchar to be haſtened, vvhen the cancer is taken away the vlcer which remaineth is to be cured after the order of other vlcers. The ſignes that the cancer is quite gone are theſe, good &amp; ſound fleſh, no filthye ſtinke of matter in the place, no lothſome ſmell. Archigines appointeth this medicin for vlcered cancers.

This is to be applied alone to the cancer, but if it waxe thicke, you may put to it a little wine. If it be applied to the cancer in the nature, it muſt be often waſhed in wine. If it be diſſolued in aſſes milke it aſſwageth paine, and is profitable for all eating vlcers vvithout inflammation. It hath propertie to drye filthye running eares, and looſe conſumed gummes, and all vlcers vvill hardly bee cycatryzed. For hovve ſhoulde gentle

vlcers reſiſt it, ſith fierce and vntamed yeeld to it. I Textor did thus prepare it. R. rhu. lib. ij. pillul. cupreſs. lib. ſ. gallar. immaturar. casſiae ana ℥ ij. vini aſtringētis lib. viij. In the declining of it, treacle waſhed in milke &amp; oyle of Roſes in ſoft woll is to bee applied to the vlcer. And it may be dronke vvith vvine very profitable againſt this diſeaſe, as other counterpoiſons and preſeruatiues vſed againſt the ſtinging of beaſtes. I thinke it is not meete to cloaſe vppe a cancer vntill all the hardnes be conſumed by ointmentes and cearceclothes. But to ſay the truth touching an vlcerate cancer, whether it be ſo by nature, or otherwiſe, ſeeing it refuſeth gentle medicins, yea ſcarcely at any time abideth them, and is not to bee cured, but with ſtrong medicins: which neuertheleſſe make it worſe &amp; more fretting, is not to be deemed incurable? Certes if any ſuche bee cured, it lieth not deepe but onely is in the vppermoſt partes, from vvhence it may bee remoued by inciſion, or ſearing, if the part vvill ſuffer it, and the rootes of it may be pulled vppes and the griefe of the patient cauſeth this extremitye to bee aduentured.

                           Aetius in his ſixteenth Booke and fortye foure Chapiter ſayth thus: An vlcerate Cancer gnaweth continually, and diggeth deepe vvythout ſtaye, it ſendeth foorth a thyn corrupt matter, more vile then the poiſon of any vvilde beaſt, moſt abhominable both for abundance and ſmell, and the payne is continually pricking. Tagaultius with many others ſayth thus: An vlcerate cancer, whether of it ovvn nature, or by medicines applyed, is worſt of all others, and vtterly refuſeth all ſounde cure. For vvhereas it needeth ſharpe byting medicines to cure it perfectly, by theſe it becommeth vvorſe. I haue ſaide heretofore, that I did vtterly miſlike burning medicines, commonly called cauſtickes and ruptories, as hurtfull to be vſed to any kinde of cancer, vvhich is neare to the heart, of vvhiche ſorte is that which is in the breſte, becauſe they procure extreame paynes, vvatching, abſtinence, agues: and this ſtinking ſincke beeyng once raked, there followe more cruell tormentes, and the ſtrength decaying by little and little, at the laſt the whole bodye languiſheth and conſumeth.

                        ALl theſe are deſperate and incurable. For beſides that they cannot bee cutte away, it is to bee feared leaſt the partie dye in the Surgeons handes by too much effuſion of bloud. That cancer which is in the top of the teat, maye bee cured by putting awaye that part. A cancer not vlcerate in the breſt is an exceeding greate ſwelling, not yeelding when it is touched, vnequall, cruell, like a ſauage beaſt, piercing and ſticking faſt vvithin. ſtretching his rootes very broade, bound as it vvere vvyth veynes ſwelling like varix round about: the colour is aſhye, ſome-what declining to purple, of a dark blew, ſoft to the ſight, but in feeling moſt harde, hauing pricking paine euerye where ſo largely ſtretched, that by conſent therof it hath procured peſtilent buboes in the arme-holes, which haue reached vnto the ſhoulders.
                        
                           Aetius in his 16. booke, and 46. chap. ſetteth downe out of Leomidas, hovv a Surgeon is to deale in curing a cancer

in a womans breſt Let the patient lye on her back, and firſt cut the ſound part of the breſt, &amp; preſently after the inciſion ſeare it, to procure a cruſt vpon it, vvhich vvil ſtay the fluxe of bloud: Not long after make inciſion againe to the bottome of the breſt, vvith often ſcarifiyng, then alſo ſcare it Both cutting &amp; ſearing muſt bee often vſed. After all is cut away, ſeare the parts vntil they bee dried. For the firſt ſearing is to ſtaye bloud, the latter to aboliſh the reliques of the diſeaſe. In the apoſtemous ſwelling of the breſt, vvhich threateneth a cācer to enſue, cutting without ſearing to the ſoūd part wil ſuffiſe, vvhē there is no danger of great iſſue of bloud. After the inciſiō, linamēts muſt be applied to bring it to ſuppuration, then muſt a dry cure be cōtinued as the maner of vlcers requireth. VVhen there is ſearing with inciſion, theſe thinges are to be applied immediatly: a cataplaſm of plantain, or knot graſſe, or ſeſamine finely beaten, putting ſometimes to them crums of bread. Lay vppon the cataplaſme a linnen cloth wette in water, which onely remedie for the moſt part is ſufficient. Alſo milke mingled with honye, applied

like a liniment, remoueth the cruſt. Her diet muſt be ſuch, which maye bee ſafe from cold vvhen the vlcer is clenſed, leaſt any convulſion enſue: Therefore the patient muſt bee kepte in a warme houſe.
                        On the ſecond or third day vnlooſe the medicine, and vvaſh the place with warme vvater, then make an oyntment of lentils with a little hony, and vppon it lay a vyne leafe or lettyce, which you muſt continue vntill the cruſt fal away. After-vvard your linimentes muſt bee made of vvomen or aſſes milke, wherwith oile of roſes is mingled. Let your lynnen cloath bee ſingle, and very fine, which muſt be vvette in the mylke. Beware of ſharpe and fattye medicines, both vvhich recall this diſeaſe. Manye cloths are grieuous to the ſore. VVhen you would bring it to ſuppuration, let your oyle be moſt, when to cleanſing, let your milke more abound.
                        If extremitie of paine do ſo require, applye melilot with oyle of roſes and water, or womans milke aboue the cataplaſme. If there be neede of dry medicines to cloſe vp the vlcer, the aſhes of pompholygos waſhed and dryed, or
