            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  MOst gratious God, and omnipotent Father, which dost from the Throne of thy grace behold

all the wickednesse of mortall Men; pardon wee beseech thee our most lamentable and grieuous sinnes, and wash them away by the precious blood of thy most blessed Sonne Christ Iesus, who dyed to saue vs sinful men, of which sort we are the most miserable and wicked. We giue thee most hearty thankes (O Lord) that thou hast brought vs safe to the beginning of this day, and

raysed vs from the sinne of Sloth and Ignorance; and grant (O Lord) that wee may so spend this day that it may be most to thy glory, &amp; the comfort of our owne Soules; giue vs grace most heauenly Father, that wee may follow our vocations wherevnto thou hast called vs, and that we may doe alwayes those things which may bee righteous in thy sight; Graunt these our humble petitions most heauenly

Father, &amp; all things necessary for vs, for thy deere Sonnes sake Christ Iesus, to whom with thee and the blessed Trinity, be all Honour and Glory both now and for euer more, Amen.
            
            
               An Euening Prayer for a Familie.
               OH Euerlasting Lord God, and mercifull Father, wee thy poore and

wretched Creatures from the bottome of our hearts, giue thee most humble and hearty thankes, that of thy mercy thou hast vouchsafed to nourish vs with thy goodnesse, &amp; by thy power preserued vs from all dangers and perils that might haue befalne vs this day, yea and at all times of our life heeretofore: We most humbly beseech thee in the merits of thy Sonn Christ Iesus our blessed Lord and

Sauiour, not to respect our vnworthynesse, but in his graue to bury our misdeeds which we either wittingly or ignorantly haue done. Especially those sins which this day we haue commited against thy diuine Maiesty, either in thought, word or deed. O Lord bee mercifull vnto vs, and forgiue vs the euill that we haue committed, and supply the good which wee haue omitted; Lord restore what we haue

lost, lighten our darknesse, and alter the whole course of our mindes, that nothing may bee wanting in vs to the setting forth of thy prayse. Wée beseech thee (O Lord) according to thy goodnesse, to defend vs this night from all perills and dangers: keepe vs from feareful dreames and vaine cogitations: preserue our bodies from eternall death, and our soules from euerlasting damnation. Grant

these things O Lord, and all other thy graces requisite for vs, euen for thy Son Christ Iesus sake: In whose name we conclude this our vnworthy prayer, in that forme of prayer which hée in his Gospell hath taught vs saying, Our Father, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               
               A Prayer for the obtaining of Grace.
               
                  In this wicked world,
                  O Christ whiles I liue,
                  To gouerne and guide me,
                  thy spirit of grace giue.
               
               WOrship, Praise, Honour, Glory, &amp; Maiestie, be giuen vnto thee, O God, my Creator; to thée, O Christ, my Redéemer, and to thee, O holy Ghost,

my Sanctifier; for all the blessings of thy grace most plentifully powred vpon mee: for my election, my Creation, my Redemption, my sanctification, and for all other thy good giftes and benefites: beséeching thée (O swéet Sauiour,) that as by thy bitter death and passion, the power of sinne was suppressed, the concupiscence of the flesh subdued, the wickednes of the world asswaged, and the

maliciousnesse of Satan quenched; so it would please thee to ouer-shadow mee with the Shield of thy fauour, that I a painefull pilgrim, and weary wanderer in the world, may passe my pilgrimage in peace of conscience: comforting me with the hope of thy promises, which wilt &amp; canst refresh the fainting soule, and restore it when it is attainted with any dāgerous disease. O Christ, my Phisician, so

prepare the thoughts of my heart vnto thee, that I may be swallowed vp in the contemplation of Heauen, and heauenly ioyes, not regarding the vanities of this world, which are but baits and snares to intangle vs, and to make vs lothsome in thy sight. Giue me grace (O thou Son of Dauid) to liue in the world, as ready to leaue the world. Let the world continue as thou diddest make it, euen a seruant

for the maintenance of men: and not a soueraign to rule and haue them at commandement. And because thy Kingdome, O Christ, is not of this world, giue me (I beséech thee) such a renewed heart, such a sanctified soule such a godly desire, and such an earnest endeauour to do thy wil, that I contemning this wicked world, with all the transitory pleasures of the same, may raigne with thee in thy kingdome, purchased

for the faithful, euen by thy precious Blood, Death &amp; Passion: Graunt this, O Christ, my Mediator, at the appointed time of thy good will and pleasure. Amen.
            
            
               A Prayer for thankefulnesse to God for his gifts.
               
                  For Wisedome and Wealth,
                  with other gifts more,
                  Lord, giue me the grace
                  To thanke thee therefore.
               
               IEsus Christ, thou which art the Wisedome of thy

Father, I thy poore creature sometimes a slaue to sinne, and a firebrand of Hell: but now a child of election and grace, (as I hope and constantly beleeue,) giue thee hearty thanks for thy goodnesse, diuers and sundry wayes testified vnto mée. And because it hath pleased thee to be so bountifull, as to endue mée with Wisedome, whereas thou mightest haue made mée a senselesse and vnreasonable creature;

beside that, blessed me with worldly wealth: I beséech thee, be so gracious vnto me, as to shew me the way how to vse this Wisedome to thy glory, and the comfort of other: not boasting therein, because it is thy free gift: nor abusing it, because it is thy blessing. Also (O swéete Sauiour, and Sonne of the eternall God) because wealth without thée, is but wretchednesse: riches, pouerty, and

all earthly pleasures, but méere miseries: I beséech thée, to shine into my heart with the bright beames of thy Spirit, that I may like a faithfull Steward, not only dispose and lay out the talent, which thou hast lent me: but also increase the same: making thy glory the marke wherat to direct all my doings: and thy word the rule to kéepe me within the compasse of thy will. O Christ heare me, O heare

me sweet Sauiour,) which art the Well of life, whereof whosoeuer tasteth, hee shall neuer see Death: Heare me, O gracious Redéemer, and let me féele inwardly the fruits of my faithfull prayer, Amen.
            
            
               A Prayer for Loue, and Vnitie with all men.
               
                  To liue in loue,
                  all men among,
                  
                     Giue grace, O Christ,
                  to old and young
               
               LOrd Iesus, thou Patterne of true and vnfeined loue: yea, of loue leading to life euerlasting▪ without whom there can bee no loue or concord amōg men: I beseech thee, to heare the prayer of me thy poore seruant: and that which I aske in spirit, vouchsafe to giue me of thy free mercy. And because loue is the fulfilling

of the Law, and the seale of saluation to the consciences of all Christians. Furthermore, for so much as thou hast commaunded vs to doe good to all men, which cannot be, vnlesse loue be the lampe to giue vs light: I beséech thée, to fill my heart with that loue; yea, to poure that loue abundantly into the hearts of all, both old and yong, that we may first and principally loue Almightie God the Father:

thée, O Christ the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, with such a loue as is loath to turne the fauor of God into displeasure, his gentlenesse into rigour, his mercy into iudgement, and his forbearance into vengeance. Secondly, to loue my Soueraigne Prince, whom I am bound in conscience to obey: to loue my superiors, to loue mine equals, to loue mine inferiors, to loue mine enemies: Finally, to loue all,

and hate none, that by this meanes I may dwel in God the Fountaine of loue: who of méere loue for the saluation of the soule of man, sent thee (O my Sauiour) into the world to suffer death vp on the crosse, euen in the face of his enimies and persecutors. Grant this, O Christ, to whom with the Father and the holie Ghost, be all praise and glory for euermore, Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer for the hearing and true vnderstanding of the word of God.
               
                  To heare thy word,
                  and liue therein,
                  Vs to renew,
                  O Lord begin.
               
               LIghten my heart, O Lord GOD, with the lampe of thy holy and blessed word, which is the weapon of euery true Christian souldier, and the sword of the spirit, to cut off all the temptations of the Diuell,

the world, and the flesh, if it be vsed according to thy wil, O Lord which art the giuer and author of the same. And for so much, O Lord, as thy worde is the rule, whereby wée are bound to direct all our doings: and the square, whereat to frame the whole course of our life: I beséech thée, to circumcise my heart, that all carnall cogitations and thoughtes expelled and driuen out, I may betake my selfe wholy vnto the reading,

hearing, studying, &amp; folowing of thy word, which is the food of our soules: the comfortable bread, which killeth hunger and the pleasant drinke, which quencheth thirst: not the hunger &amp; thirst of the body, against the which, it hath pleased thée to prouide most healthfull remedies: but the hunger and thirst of the soule, which are no way else asswaged, but by the vertue and heauenly working of

thy word. This word, O Lord, vouchsafe to make florish and fruitifie in vs, that thereby wee may bée wonne to the worshipping of thée, in true feare, vnfained faith, and perfect holinesse of life, through Iesus Christ our Sauiour, Amen.
            
            
               
               A Praier to God for forgiuenesse of manifold and grieuous sinnes.
               
                  My heart vncleane,
                  Lord circumcise:
                  And make my soule
                  thy sacrifice.
               
               IN sinne, O Lord, was my conception, in sinne my education, in sinne the whole course of my life. Nothing is cleane and vnspotted in mée: nothing is sound, nothing perfect, nothing holy,

nothing sanctified. I am full of sinne and iniquitie, my thoughts &amp; desires are attainted with sinne: my labours and handy works are defiled with wickednes, my words and communications are tempered with the leauen of iniquity: my hart is corrupt &amp; putrified; there is nothing sound in me, but all mine entrails are infected, and poysoned with sin, the high way to euerlasting shame, death, and condemnation.

O miserable wretch that I am, to whom shall I run for succour: To whom shall I make my sorrowes knowne: Before whom shall I powre my plaintes: Art not thou the Samaritane, which with the oyle of mercie souplest my festered woundes: Art not thou the good Sephearde, which bringest home the straying Shéepe to the shéepefold: Art not thou the good Captaine, which fightest in defence

of thy Souldiers: O, yes Lord, thou art euen he: and doubtlesse, had not the oyle of thy mercy healed my filthy Botches: had not thy hand fetcht me home to the flocke: had not thy loue and grace ouer shadowed me in danger, I had rotted in my filthinesse; I had perished in my wandering, and I had béen vtterly ouerthrowne in combate. O Lord my God, circumcise my heart, and clense it from all euill

thoughts, deuises, imaginations, &amp; consentes to sinne. Sanctifie my soule, renew my spirit, and garnish mée with the garment of regeneration, that I may become a swéete smelling sacrifice before thée a sacrifice of acceptable incense, a sacrifice of holines, &amp; righteousnes: so shall I prayse thée in the assemblie of the iust, &amp; extoll thy glorious name among thy people. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer for to be setled in the Truth.
               
                  Thy Truth send downe,
                  Lord from aboue,
                  And giue me grace
                  the same to loue.
               
               ACcording to thy louing kindnesse, O Christ, heare the praiers of thy seruant; &amp; that request which Hope inboldeneth mee to make, vouchsafe in mercy to grant. And because the Deuill is the father of all falshood and lying; and thou the

fountaine of all truth and righteousnes; as thou saiest of thy selfe; I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: therefore I beseech thee (O gracious God &amp; Sauiour) to plant in me the Trueth; without the which, all entrance into heauenly ioy is stopt vp: &amp; to banish out of my heart, (which by nature is a nest of wickednesse) all maner of sinne, resisting the Truth. And for so much as Truth is a pearle of price,

and a Iewell of great value to the godly, the ornament of the faythful, and the treasure of the true Christian: therefore I beséech thée, O Christ, giue me grace, to thirst after truth, &amp; to hunger after the taste of that heauenly foode: that my desiring soule may be succoured, &amp; my longing heart refreshed euen with the fulnes of ye same. And wheras by nature we are bōdslaues of sinne, and by that meanes

vtter enemies of truth: we beseech thee notwithstanding, to make vs partakers of mercy, and not of iudgement: remembring that thy death and bloodshed paid the price of redemption for all mankinde. Thou God of truth, heare my prayer, and let the suite of me thy poore Seruant, come before thy presence: and that which I haue asked with boldnesse, vouchsafe to graunt of thy speciall goodnesse, Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer to leade our life according to the will of God.
               
                  To doe thy will,
                  teach me, O Lord,
                  And let my life
                  thereto accord.
               
               MOst mighty, most iust most mercifull, most louing, most tender &amp; deare Father; forsomuch as there is no way to heauen, but by doing thy wil: we say with humblenes of heart, as Iesus 
                     •
                  hrist thy Sonne, and

my swéete Sauiour hath taught: Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in Coelo, &amp; in Terra; Thy will be done in earth, as it is in Heauen
                   And, because it is thy will, that we should walk in holines and righteousnes before thée, all the dayes of our life; we beséech thée, to be the Schoolemaster of our Soules and Spirites, that thy Wisedome instructing and teaching vs, to make a difference betwéene good and bad, we

may follow the one, and forsake the other: considering, that the doers of thy wil, and not the knowers of the same, shal be partakers of the promises of life and saluation. For thy Sonne Iesus Christes sake, my onely Sauiour and Redeemer, grant this request (O most gracious God, both vnto mee, and to all thy people. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer to fast, and abstaine from sinne.
               
                  To fast from Sinne,
                  is Christians ioy:
                  My heart thereto,
                  O Lord employ.
               
               LOrd God, maker of heauen &amp; earth, Iudge of the quicke and the dead; thou that by wisedome séest all things, and by thy prouidence orderest all creatures; wee beséech thée, to cast thine eyes of care and

compassion vpon vs miserable sinners, who from the day of our birth, haue liued in wantonnes, and all kind of wickednes, therby kindling thy wrath and Iustice against vs to our confusion. O let vs yet at length, haue our eyes opened, and sée the brightnesse of thy glorie, which the blindnesse of our minds, will not suffer vs to behold. Let vs not pamper our selues in securitie, lyuing out of rule, and abandoning

all godlinesse; which is a kinde of surfetting in iniquity, and ouercharging our hearts with heapes of abominations: but let vs become new Schollers in the Schoole of Christianitie, walking warily, redeeming the time, louing light, and detesting darknesse. O Lord, vouchsafe to be mindfull of vs thy creatures, and of thine owne glory, which art our Creator. Teach vs to fast aright, not superstitiously,

in abstaining from this or that kind of meate, vsing a vaine order in dyet, and differences of meates: but as thine holy ones haue in times past, fasted the true Fast, which thou in thy Word requirest: so grant, I beséech thee, that I, and all people, may fast after the same fashion: to fast from sin &amp; wickednes, that the flesh may bee brought into subiection, and the spirit quickened. Graunt this,

O Lord, for thy Sons sake, Iesus Christ my Redéemer and Sauiour. Amen.
            
            
               A Praier for grace to forsake euill, and to follow that which is good.
               
                  From Heauen▪ O God,
                  send vs thy grace,
                  Ill to forsake,
                  and good t'imbrace.
               
               ALmightie God, I beseech thee to giue mee true vnderstanding &amp; knowledge, not onely to confesse

thée a most mercifull Father, but also an vpright Iudge; fauouring thy children, which liue within the compasse of thy Commandements: and punishing offendours, which run headlong into all mischiefe, not once looking backe to the written Tables of the law. And, because it standeth not with the frailtie of man, to fulfill the summe of the law; vpon the breach whereof, condemnation doth insue:

we beseech thée, to inrich our harts with the treasure of thy Grace, that we waxing wealthy therewith, may be able to withstand all the assaults of Satan, our subtile aduersarie. Moreouer, good GOD, forsomuch as this Grace of thine, is the badge of thy fatherly affection; and guydeth the thoughts, the words, &amp; the déedes of euery Christian: wée besech thée, to shield vs with the same, that wée

may follow, and stand stedfastly in that, which is acceptable in thy sight; renouncing the Deuill, and his workes of darknesse: and betaking our selues body and soule, to the healthfull guiding of thy grace. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer for the assistance of the Holy Ghost.
               
                  Th'assistance of
                  the Holy Ghost,
                  Sweete Iesus spread
                  in euery Coast.
               
               MOst comfortable Sauiour, most victorious Captaine, most triumphant Redéemer, most mercifull Mediatour, Iesus Christ, thou beloued Sonne of the eternall God spread abroad

the brightnesse of thy Maiestie, to the consolation of all people. And, forsomuch as without thée, the whole world is nothing else but a solitarie Wildernesse, destitute of faith, hope, charitie, loue, gentlenes, compassion, forbearance, and all other workes of Christianitie: we beséech thée, to be a gracious God, as thou art an omnipotent God; that where thy power is séene, thy mercie may likewise be perceiued.

Let not thy creatures continue in ignorance of thée their Sauiour, but so assist them with the present aide of thy comforting Spirit and the holy Ghost, that they may sée in what by-wayes of destruction &amp; dangers they trauerse. Let thy holy Ghost be their lodesman, let the holy Ghost be their teacher, let the holy Ghost be their right hand, and their left: let the holy Ghost be to them all in all;

that they being thus inspired, &amp; filled with the power of thy sanctifying Spirit, may feele in themselues a spiritual inclination &amp; working, all desires of the flesh being cut off, &amp; cast away: and may also be receiued into thy shéepfold, &amp; be reckoned among the number of the faithfull. Graunt this, O Christ, thou tender Sauiour of our soules. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer against Wrath and Malice.
               
                  From hatefull heart,
                  and fraught with ire:
                  Saue vs, O Lord,
                  wee thee desire.
               
               BOuntifull God, which hast giuen vs commandement to loue all men, and to hate none: to be angry, but not to sinne: to be displeased a little, but not to let the Sunne set vpon our

wrath: wée beséech thée, to purge our heartes cleane from all hatred, from all enuie, from all malice, from al vncharitablenesse, from all vntowardnesse, from all bitternesse, from all quarrelling, from all misreporting, from all backbyting, from all reuengement seeking: sinally, from al the motions of a wicked spirit. Let loue banish hate, let friendlines displace vnkindnes, let charitie remooue ouerthwartnes,

let forbearance dispossesse maliciousnes: al which are most shamefull sinnes, and so hatefull in thy sight, O God, that he is no Christian, but an Antichristian; no child of blisse, but of Baall, no heire of Heauen, but of Hell; no vessell of election, but of reprobation; no partaker of ioy, but of woe; no souldier of the Church, but of the Synagogue, in whom they beare rule. And therefore (most gracious

God (root out of our hearts all such wéedes of wickednesse, that we may become new griftes of righteousnesse, through Iesus Christ our Sauiour, Amen.
            
            
               A Praier for obedience to the keeping of Gods Commandements.
               
                  To liue within the rule of Law,
                  keepe vs, O Lord, in feare &amp; awe.
               
               EVerlasting God, whose name is so glorious, that it passeth the capacitie of

man, to giue it due aduancement: we beséech thée, of thine infinite goodnes, thou soueraigne Law-giuer, to arme our harts with the ful furniture of obedience, that we may first and principally feare thée, which art our Creatour: and in thée, thy Sonne our Redéemer: and in both the holy Ghost, our Comforter. This if we do, (as it is not vnlike we shal▪ if thy grace gouerne vs) our wils &amp; wits shalbe brought

into such subiection, that whatsoeuer duties earthly Magistrates bind vs vnto by Law &amp; commandement, (so the same be not to thy dishonour) there shall want no readinesse in vs to fulfill and accomplish. Vouchsafe therefore (O heauenly Father) to keepe vs in thy feare, to limit vs within the bounds of true obedience, both to thée, O our GOD, and also to our superiours and betters, that whatsoeuer

is required of vs in the way of godly submisson and reuerence, we murmur not thereat, but doe our endeauours therin, with all zeale and earnestnesse. Amen.
            
            
               A Prayer for true and hearty repentance.
               
                  Repentance for
                  our foule misdeeds,
                  Graunt vs, O God,
                  whose grace exceeds.
               
               WE wretched outlaws O Lord God, cast our

selus along before thy mercie seate, beséeching thée to inspire our minds with perfect wisedome, and to arme vs with the true and liuely knowledge of thy Law: that both in body, &amp; also in soule, we may walke the way of thy Commandementes and Testimonies. So gouerne vs by thy Grace, O God, and so conduct vs by thy louing kindnesse, that being throughly informed, and reformed to thy Law, we may

be stricken inwardly with a godly feare, and Christian trembling of transgressing thy preceptes, which thou hast appoynted vnto vs, in this darke &amp; palpable time of securitie, and wickednes, (when all people and nations for the most part stumble at the blockes of their owne sinnes) to be a lanterne to lighten our féete, and the day starre to direct all our doings. And though wée can not of our selues,

(such is the infirmitie of our nature, and weaknes of our flesh) but fall into the snares of sinne: yet, wée humbly beséech thée, (for thy beloued Sonnes sake Iesus Christ our Sauiour,) to touch our guiltie consciences with the finger of thy grace, that through a sorrowfull féeling of them, we may by fayth, take sure and fast hold of the staffe of thy promises, who made a vow to haue mercy on the ssnner,

repenting him of his lewd life, and forsaking his iniquity. Grant this, O God, for the comfort of thy chosen, and for thy Sonnes sake Iesus Christ our Mediatour, and Aduocate, Amen.
            
            
               
               A prayer to the Lord, to turn his wrathfull displeasure away from vs.
               
                  Thy wrath, O Lord,
                  remember not,
                  Though such desert,
                  my sinnes allot.
               
               IVdge me not, O Lord, in the heate of thine indignation: O consume me not in the furie of thy rage. I confesse, that mine offences cry out for vengeance, euen as a dry &amp; sandy soyle gapeth

for raine. Howbeit (O most mercifull Father) remember thy mercy, and let not sentence passe in iudgement to my condemnation: my sinnes haue laid out my lot, euen thy vengeance, O Lord, I cannot say the contrary: but thou hast Mercy in store, which pleadeth against Iustice; so that thy Wrath (I hope) shall not ouerthrow me, though my wickednesses (like waues) ouerwhelme my soule. O

Lord, heare my prayer, and for the honour of thy name, turne from me the punishments which thou hast denounced against mee in iudgement. I am a worme, and no man; yea, the offscowring of men, a wretch, and forsaken, an outcast, and an alien frō the Common wealth of Israel: my sinnes haue made a separation of thy fauour from me: but the death of thy Sonne hath put out the handwriting,

and broken downe the partition wall betwixt thée and mee. And therefore I come with boldnesse and confidence to thee, hoping to taste the swéetnes of thy Mercy, though I haue deserued the sharpnes of thy Iustice. As thou wilt, O Lord, so be it. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer for a cleare and quiet Conscience.
               
                  A Conscience cleare
                  from all vnrest,
                  Graunt vs, O God:
                  whose name be blest.
               
               LEt the light of thy coū
                  tenance shine vpon vs, (most mercifull Father,) let the comfort of thy spirit drop into our hearts, let thy fauour &amp; louing kindnesse be vnto vs a pauilion in the

warfare of this life. Bee thou vnto vs a gracious God, and a Father inclined to compassion: that whereas the horror of our sinnes, and their haynousnesse, together with the manifoldnesse of our offences, kindleth in vs a kind of feare vnto death, disquieting our consciences, and raising vp within vs accusers to giue in euidence against vs, for the violating &amp; breaking of thy commaundements: it

would please thee, like a Father, tenderly to deale with vs as with thy children, and not like a seuere Iudge to handle vs, as guilty persons, giuing vs ouer, and leauing vs to the spoyle of our mortall enemies. Our conscience indeed, layeth dayly to our charge, that we haue playd the back-sliders, that we haue not kept vs within the compasse of thy holy precepts, that wee haue withstood

thy heauenly will, and like stubborne rebels, denied thée the honour due vnto thy Name: neuerthelesse (O Lord God) cast vs not off into confusion, neither leaue vs to continuall torment, and vexation of conscience for our sinnes: but looke vpon vs with the eyes of mercy, that the terrour of conscience which we feele for sinne, may bee turned into rest and quietnesse: least if it happen

otherwise, wee be driuen (with Iudas) into desperation: From the which we beseech thee to deliuer vs, for the honour of thy name (O GOD Almighty, Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer to be Zealous in the hearing of the word of God.
               
                  To heare thy Word,
                  and loue the same,
                  Vouchsafe, O Lord,
                  our hearts to frame.
               
               LOuing Father &amp; gracious God, forsomuch as thy word is the rule of life, and the high way to happines, we beséech thee, to kindle in vs an earnest desire

to heare the same, and that not only with the outward eares of the body, but with the inward eares of the heart: which is the hearing in deed, whereby profit and comfort is gathered. Thy Word is the Sword to cut downe sinne; thy Word is the weapon which thy Ministers vse, to conquer the kingdome of Satan: It is the felicitie of the faithfull in this life: it is the stumbling blocke of offence

to the wicked: yea, to the vncircumcised Philistine, it is the sauour of death vnto death: but to the circumcised Israelite, it is the sauour of life vnto life. Vouchsafe therefore, (O bountifull God) to kindle in mee the fire of zeale vnto thy word, that I may so estéeme and count thereof, as of the chiefest treasure of a Christian in this vale of misery, hauing mine eares alwayes open to

heare it, and my hart ready to receiue it: my tongue plyant to speake of it, and my mind earnest to meditate in it: so shall I reape such profit thereby, as thou hast prepared for them that come reuerently therunto. This, and all things néedfull for this life, graunt (O most mercifull Father) for thy Sonnes sake our onely Mediatour and Aduocate. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer for a patient Minde in trouble.
               
                  In trouble, Lord,
                  to thee we call,
                  A patient Spirit
                  to giue vs all.
               
               IN all afflictions and tribulations (O GOD Father of all mercy and consolation) wée beséech thee to looke vpon vs. &amp; in the bowels of compassiō to mittigate

and asswage our miseries. And as it hath pleased thée of thy fatherly pitty, to call vs to thée the running Riuer of all refection and comfort; so we beséech thée, euen then specially to heare our cryes &amp; lamentations, when we lie groning vnder the heauie burthen of affliction and trouble. Thou hast commanded vs, to make our meane vnto thée, saying; Call vpon me in the time of thy trouble, and I

will heare thee. O bountifull and gracious God, doe therefore with thy seruāts according to thy word: and as thou art faithfull in thy promises; so I humbly beséech thée, that I, among the rest of thy people, may féele and tast the swéetnes of thy fauour and grace; which is the most soueraigne succour that can be, in al necessities and distresses. To thee therefore which art the rich treasure,

of all goodnes, &amp; the healthfull welspring of all perfect peace, we approch; submitting our selues before thy face, and crauing at thy handes the spirit of patience, wherwith, as with an vnpeaceable target being defended, we may constantly abide and weare out any kind of crosse and tribulation, wayting the good time of thy pleasure for our deliuerance. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer in time of Prosperitie, or Aduersitie.
               
                  If Poore, or Rich,
                  O Lord, we bee,
                  Teach vs to know,
                  all comes from thee.
               
               ALmightie GOD, Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which madest Heauen and earth, the sea, &amp; all the wonders of the Déepe: wée confesse, that thou art

the author of al things, and that vpon thee the whole estate of man doth depend: humbly beséeching thée, of thy goodnes, to guide vs so farre with thy grace, that if we sée our selues blessed with the Wealth of this world, which winneth worship and credit among people: or oppressed with pouerty, which bréedeth contempt and abasement: we may notwithstanding, neither by the one wax proud

or insolent: neither yet by the other become mistrustfull, or desperate: but referring all to thee, which distributest thy giftes to thine owne liking vpon the tryall of thy seruants, wée may learne this; that as thou art able to make the rich poore, &amp; the poore rich: so in thée it is, to giue euery man an inward knowledge and assurance of thy will, whatsoeuer estate it hath pleased thée to place him, or

them in: the which inward knowledge, I beséech thee, powre into my spirit, that as well in pouerty, as in riches, I may glorifie thy name: vsing my riches as thy blessing, in signe of thy careful prouidence; and not repining, but well contenting my selfe with pouerty, as thy chastisement, to kéepe me vnder awe and obedience: thy will, and not my will, O Lord, be done and fulfilled. Amen.
            
            
               
               A praier for patience in time of losse of Goods, or Landes.
               
                  The losse of Life,
                  of Goods, and Lands,
                  O gracious God,
                  is in thy hands.
               
               MOst mighty God, and merciful father▪ from whō all good things do procéed, as tokens of thy kindnesse: and all punishments

for sinne▪ as signes of thy displeasure: which giuest life, &amp; takest away the same againe at thine appoynted time: which inrichest thy seruants with goods of sundry sorts, and changest their condition in a moment: which blessest thy creatures with Lands and Possessions, and turnest all in an instant, into extreame need and nakednesse; as thou didst deale with Iob. that perfect paterne of patience:

We beséech thee, to inspire vs with an vnderstanding heart, that we may so liue, as willing to die: that we may enioy our goods, as not grudging to forgoe them: and that wée may hold vs to our Lands, as not loth to loose them; considering, that as they came from thée, so in thée it is to dispose them as thou wilt, either to blessing, or to cursing. O gracious God, let vs not grow in forgetfulnesse

of the life to come, by too much louing this present transitorie Life, which is but a shadow, a smoke, and a dreame. Let vs not bee drowned in the desires and delights of worldly goods, least wee neglect the riches of Paradise; which nothing can purchase, but Faith in the blood and death of Christ: let vs not wed our willes and witts to Landes and Possessions, which are but

momentany maintenances▪ least in ouerliking them, wee loose the sweet inheritance of the holy land, Ierusalem, not built with hands, but glorious and triumphant: wherto bring vs, O God, for his sake that bought vs, Iesus Christ the righteous, Amen.
            
            
               
               A thankes-giuing for Meat, Drinke, and Clothing.
               
                  For Meate and Drinke,
                  and Cloth to weare,
                  Wee praise thy name,
                  O God, with feare.
               
               LORD Iesus, the Redéemer of all mankind, which vouchsafedst to shed thine owne heart Blood vpon the Crosse, for the saluation of our soules, which else through sinne had miserably

perished; we praise thée, we magnifie thée, we worship thée, we glorifie thee, wee giue thankes to thée, for thy great kindnes, for thy tender loue, for they zealous affection, and for thine excéeding goodnesse, in caring for vs, in louing vs, in tendering vs, in susteining vs, in relieuing vs, and in supplying all our wantes and necessities. Thou numbrest all the haires of our head; and

without thy wil, they waxe not one lesse. Thou giuest vs food &amp; nourishment, to comfort and strengthen our bodyes. Thou giuest vs Garments of sundry wearing, both for the safegard of health, &amp; also for comelines. Thou giuest vs Houses to harbour in: &amp; whatsoeuer wee stande in need of, thou of thine abundant grace, pourest the same most plentifully into our bosomes. Thou féedest the

young Sparrowes, thou cloathest the Lillies of the field, thou garnishest ye trées of the Forrest with gréene leaues, thou inrichest the secretes of the earth, and the sea, with precious treasure, &amp; is it like, that thou wilt not haue an eye to man, a creature fashiōed after thy owne image and likenesse, for whom all these thinges were made and created? No, no, thy loue is euerlasting, and thy mercie excéedeth

all measure. They shall lacke nothing, that pitch the pauilion of their pilgrimage vpon thy Prouidence: which that wee may euer do, and so be blessed with aboundance; wee beséech thee, giue vs thy Grace, so shall we laude and magnifie thee with heart and voyce, for euermore, Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer for ayde and helpe in all extreamities and need.
               
                  Helpe vs, O Lord,
                  in all our needes:
                  And guide our thoughts,
                  our wordes, and deedes.
               
               ALl glory, honor, praise, dominion, &amp; thankes, be giuen vnto thée, O King euerlasting, which hast made me a reasonable creature, furnished mee with discretion and iudgement,

indued me with knowledge and vnderstanding, and bestowed vpon me benefits of most singular excellencie. Like glory and thankes be giuen vnto thée, for thy prouidence and care for me, vile créeping worme of the earth, who in comparison of thée, am much woorse than stinking doung, and filthy offscowring of the earth. Thou dayly assistest me, thou cōtinually regardest me, thou euermore defendest

me from dangers, both bodily and ghostly: for had not thy hand ouershadowed me, I had sunke long since in mine owne shame and confusion. And because, Lord, manifold are the calamities belonging to this life, hurtful to the outward man, &amp; noisome to the inner man, I beséech thée stretch out the shield of safty in full breadth ouer me, that I may walke without feare, not troubled with

wicked thoughtes, not tempted with euill words, not prouoked to deedes of darknes: but keeping my feete in the path of light, looking alway to the lampe of thy word, which shineth vnto sinners sitting in the shadow of death, and leadeth the righteous and true repentant to life euerlasting, Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer against slaunderous and euill tongues.
               
                  From euill Tongues,
                  which poyson spit,
                  Vouchsafe, O Lord,
                  thy flocke t'acquit.
               
               MOst truely spake thy seruant Saint Iames, (O my swéete Sauiour,) that the Tongue being but a little member, was notwithstanding a world of wickednesse. Which to be

so, thou knowest in thy secret counsell, and thou thy selfe haddest proofe thereof, whiles thou keptst thy standing in the faire of this life. It pleased thée therefore to instruct and teach thine Apostles before hand, what they should be subiect vnto in time to come: namely, to backbitings, slanders, acursed spéeches, tauntes, &amp; controlments: yea, to reuilings, buffettings, &amp; imprisonments.

For if they spared not the Lord and Master, much lesse will it sinke into their hearts to fauour the Seruāts; whom they hate vnto the death, for their masters sake. From euill Tongues therefore, O Lord wee beseech thee, to saue vs: not from suffering the bitternesse which procéedeth from them; for we are content to tast that which thou hast tasted before vs: but from offending

in our tongue, which oftentimes woundeth the very soule. O Lord, giue vs grace, to set a watch before our Tongue, that we trip not in our talke, &amp; hurt not onely them, against whom wee are maliciously minded; but also our selues, whom we cānot but greatly annoy, whiles we séeke, either in thought, word, or deed, to wreake our wrath vpon others, considering that thou hast reserued all

vengeance to thine owne selfe. O Lord, be gracious vnto vs; and as thou art the Shepheard of our soules, feeding vs in the sweete pastures of thy grace: so we beséech thee, to kéepe vs from all manner of spirituall diseases: vs (wee say) which are thy people, and the sheepe of thy pasture. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer for Peace in time of Warre, or other vexations.
               
                  In time of Warre,
                  to pray for Peace,
                  A zeale in vs,
                  O Lord increase.
               
               BOuntiful Sauiour, thou Sonne of the eternall God, thou God of peace-vnitie, and concord: thou that in stead of Peace, plaguest men with Warre, tumultes,

and vprors: We beseech thee, to prolong peace &amp; quietnesse amongst vs; not onely peace betwéene people and people, but peace of Conscience, that precious peace; which who so wanteth, he is no member of the Commonwealth of Christianitie. Not onely for this peace of minde, but for the other also of body, we beséech thée, O Lord, frame our heartes aright to pray vnto thee:

knowing that by Prayer, that thing is obtained at thine hands, which is not else where to bee sought. And because thou art the Author of peace, without whom the whole world is set on Warre: we humbly beseech thée, to prosper that peace, which thou hast planted in all Christian kingdomes, which because thou hast for our sinnes sake, taken from vs for a time, sending vs in place

thereof, Warres and Tumults: Wée giue thee thankes notwithstanding, acknowledging the same to bee a punishment layd vpon vs for our sinnes, and specially for abusing that Peace; the benefite whereof, whiles we might haue vsed to our true comfort, we turned the same (as we feele by due proofe at this present) into bitternesse. Neuerthelesse, to thee we come, and before thy face

we fall, not onely praying for the withdrawing of Warre, and the restoring of our former Peace: but also beséeching thée, to kindle &amp; increase in vs a zeale to pray▪ not only for Peace, but for all other thy good Giftes needfull and belonging to this life: to the honour and glory of thy name Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer for deliuerance from Foes spirituall and temporall.
               
                  From feare, and force,
                  of all our Foes:
                  Preserue vs Lord,
                  and them depose
               
               EVerlasting God, whose right hand is the shield of safegard to the faythfull: we beséech thée, of thine vnspeakable goodnesse, to looke vpon vs, who are incompast round about with

enemies, not onely of the body, but also of the soule: Of the body, as with swearers, backbiters, slaunderers, fighters, brawlers, quarellers, murtherers, &amp;c Al which, we that are Christians, account our Foes, insomuch as they are the enemies of Christ thy beloued Sonne, and sworne aduersaries of thy holy Gospell: Of the Soule, as with Satan, sinne, the flesh the world, the Diuell, Hel,

death, and damnation: and that which we through our weakenesse, cannot fulfill, doe thou by thy strength, supply and bring to passe, that we may not onely be defended from theire force, but that they, and euery of them, féeling the weight and greatnes of thy power, may lie vanquished vnder foote, &amp; cease their further assaultes: for Iesus Christes sake, our onely Sauiour and Redeemer, Amen.
            
            
               
               A prayer of a penitent soule ouerburdened with sinne.
               
                  A silly soule,
                  to sinne in thrall,
                  For mercy, Lord,
                  to thee doe call.
               
               WOunderfull, wise, &amp; excéeding righteous art thou in thy iudgments; O God, a punisher of the vngodly, and a iust rewarder of the faithfull. O looke vpon mée silly soule, ouerwhelmed with wickednes

looke vpon mée, O Lord. and deliuer me. For I am in thrall: yea, in thrall am I vnto sinne, the wages whereof is death. O succour me, succour me: Oh assist me, assist me: Oh saue me, saue me. Bitterly I complaine and am sorry for my misdeedes, heauily I lament for mine iniquities, vnfeignedly I repent me of my life wickedly ledde. Appease thine anger. O God, asswage thy wrath:

Oh let mee be reconciled vnto thee. Cast me not away, whom thou hast created: let not Satan triumph ouer me, whom thy Son hath redeemed. Be gracious, O be gracious, (most mercifull Father) and let the moystning riuer of thy Mercy, quench the boyling fornace of thy Iustice, that I being comforted in this life with assured taste of thy clemency, may glorifie thy name, with consent of heart

and voice; and that by mine example, others may do the like. Graunt this, O God, in Christ thy Sonne, mine onely Sauiour, Amen.
            
            
               A Prayer to be freed from all Ʋices.
               
                  From Vices all defend vs,
                  Sweet Iesus, and amend vs.
               
               IEsus Christ, thou immaculat Lambe, which wast slaine for the sinnes of the whole world, that by thy

death, we might all be deliuered from death yea, from eternall death, due vnto vs by deserte of sinne. And because this world is like a Wildernesse replenished with wild beasts, or rather Monsters (vices I meane, diuelish and damnable, as pride, adulterie, flatterie, idolatrie, blasphemie, disobedience, stubbernesse, extortion, vsuries, hipocrisie, dissimulation. enuie, rancour, malice, murther, letcherie,

surfetting, wantonnesse, and an infinite number of the like hellish rable) whereto we are dayly endangered; insomuch, that oftentimes we are ready to be deuowred. Stretch out (O swéete Iesus) the arming sword of thy Spirit, cut them off by the wast, that they may haue no power to assault vs: and after this conquest wrought in vs, frame vs anew, by the word of regeneration, that

our liues being amended, we may (like Sheaues of pure Corne) be bound vp, &amp; brought into thy Barne. Heare our Prayers, O Christ, and let our cries come vnto thée, for thy name sake, Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer against vaine delights, and worldly pleasures.
               
                  From vaine delights,
                  Lord turne mine eyes,
                  And saue my soule,
                  in losse which lyes.
               
               LOrd God, Creator of all things, illuminate my heart with the Lampe of true vnderstanding and knowledge; that although mine outward eyes slumber and sléep in the shadow

of death: yet the eyes of my soule may he kept waking in the way of life. Direct me, O Lord in thy feare, &amp; guid me by thy grace: turne mine eies from all vaine delights of this world, preserue me from al the sweet entismēts of the flattering flesh; fortifie &amp; strengthen me against all the craftie temptations of Satan. And wheras my soule lieth vpō losse, &amp; is not like but to be lost, if if be left vnto it selfe

I beseech thee (O Father of mercy, &amp; God of all consolation) to take vpon thée the safety of the same, that neither Satan my subtile aduersary; nor the flesh, ye alluring harlot; nor the world, that foule ill fauor'd monster, may preuayle against it: but by thy power may vtterly be vanquished put to shame &amp; confusion. Grant this, O God▪ for thy sonnes sake, Iesus Christ my Sauiour. Amen.
            
            
               
               A prayer of a penitent sinner lamenting his former life so ill spent.
               
                  My life misse-led▪
                  
                  I doe lament,
                  And of my sinnes,
                  I mee repent.
               
               LOoke on mée, (O heauenly Father and gracious God,) with thy fauourable countenance, and in the fulnes of thine euerlasting compassion, comfort mée, which am swallowed

vp with heauinesse. And though my Sinnes surmount in thy sight, the Sandes of the Seas; yet I beséech thee, haue an eye to thy Son Iesus Christ, whom thou didst send into the world, to take vpon his shoulders the whole burden of our sinnes; and by his death, to make satisfaction vnto thee for the same. And albeit, O Lord, by my deserts. I am the child of wrath, of death, and

condemnatiō: yet notwithstanding, I beseech thée, O God, giue eare vnto the voyce of my Mediatour Christ Iesus, who maketh continuall intercessiō vnto thee, not only for mee, but also for al such as constantly beleeue in him, &amp; make him the sure ground work of their saluation. Looke not Lord vpon my deformities, but vpon his innocencie: not vpon mine iniquitie, but vpon his righteousnes:

not vpon the multitude of my misdeedes, but vpon the manifoldnesse of thy mercies. Remember the bleeding stripes and woundes of thy Sonne my Sauiour, in whom alone, by the increasing of a liuely &amp; iustifying fayth, I am a new creature, regenerate, and made cleane; not with Water, but by Grace: thy Mercie, O Father, being the fountayne of this Heauenlie

benefit. O heare the praier of thy poore seruant, and for thy Sonnes sake Iesus Christ grant my petition. Amen.
            
            
               A Prayer of a sorrowfull sinner, laying his heart open, praying for a firme fayth.
               
                  My heart, O Lord,
                  wide ope I lay,
                  And vnto thee,
                  for Faith I pray,
               
               
                  I Beséech thée (O Father of endles mercy) to looke

vpon me thy poore creature: poore indeed, and desolate; naked and bare of spirituall riches. I lay my heart wide open before thee, which hath no good thing dwelling in it. Lord, I beseech thee, plough it vp with the Plough of thy Spirit, and sow therein the seeds of a true Christian faith, such a fayth as may haue attending and wayting vpon it Hope and Charitie, as handmaides.

Also, O Lord GOD, I humbly beseech thee, that as thou hast made me thy Steward, and put mee in trust with a Talent of thy blessing; namely, Riches, worldly Wealth, &amp; transitory Treasures: so I may be furnisht with the instrument which is able to informe me how to imploy the same aright, euen faith: not an idle faith, barren, and vnfruitfull; but a busie fayth, flowing full of good

workes; that thereby I may be as a Citie builded vpon an Hill, amiable and beautifull: and like a Lanterne of light vnto all men, who seeing my good works may glorifie thee, O Father: to whom all glory belongeth both in Heauen, and in Earth. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer desiring mercy and forgiuenesse.
               
                  Of thee, O Lord,
                  Mercy I craue,
                  For Iesus sake▪
                  
                  his life which gaue.
               
               AS thou art a gracious God (O thou Iudg of Israel,) as thou art faythfull in thy promise, and iust in thy word: so I beseech thee, deale fauourably with me poore sinner, who bend the knees of my heart before

thee, crauing that with teares; which if I obtaine not, alas what shal become of me but death &amp; damnation? In thee is my hope, in thee my trust, in thée my confidence: let me not be ashamed, let me not be forsaken, nor confounded: but for thy sonne Iesus Christ his sake, who suffered a reprochfull death, in the face of his sworne and deadly enemies; haue mercy vpon me, haue mercy vpon me,

vpon mee miserable soule; on whom vnlesse thou haue mercy, Satan with his whole power, is ready to ouerrun me. In time therefore, O Lord, helpe me; in time assist me, in time succour me, or else I am a castaway, and the child of reprobation. Let thy mercy stand betweene my sinnes and thy iudgement: for Iesus sake my sweete Sauiour, succour mee miserable sinner, who neuer cease

crying: O Father, which art in Heauen, O our Father which art in Heauen, haue mercy, O haue mercy Lord in time. Amen.
            
            
               A Prayer, to be prepared against the houre of death.
               
                  Lord at my death,
                  the iewell chiefe,
                  Which I desire,
                  is true beliefe.
               
               MOst mightie God, and mercifull Father, as thou hast created and made

me of the mould of ye earth, and inspired into the grosse lumpe of my body, a liuing and quickning soule: so, O Lord I beseech thee, to indue me with such knowledge and vnderstanding: yea, with such an earnest zeale, &amp; burning desire of thy heauenly dwelling, and immortall mantion, that I may loath this life, which is but a span long: and thirst after death; which is the entrance to endlesse ioy

and happinesse. Also, O Lord, I most humbly beseech thee, when it shall please thee to visit me with sicknesse, or otherwise to call me out of this life, that I may féele working in my heart, an vnfained Fayth, and a true Christian Beliefe, whereby euen in the nipping agonies, and pinching passions of death I may lay fast hold vpon Iesus Christ my Sauiour, hoping in him to liue, who

by his death purchased euerlasting life, for all the faythfull. O heare my prayer, O God, and let my cry come vnto thee, for Iesus sake: vnto whom, with thee, and the holy Ghost, be all laude, honour and prayse, for euermore. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer to leade our liues according to the law and will of God.
               
                  Giue me, O Lord,
                  a mind and will,
                  To loue thy Law,
                  and it fulfill.
               
               LOuing Lord, and most mercifull Father, thou that art righteous in thy workes, &amp; iust in thy iudgements: faithfull in thy words, &amp; true in thy promises: make me (I heartily

beseech thee) alwayes plyant (like Waxe) both in mind and will to loue thy Law, and to liue after the same. Giue my heart the cleere light of true Christian knowledge, that I hauing the eies of my soule broad waking, may discerne betweene light and darknesse, Christ and Beliall, God and the Diuell, Hell and Heauen, the Flesh and the Spirit. Guide thou, O Lord, all my goings

by thy grace, that all my thoughtes may rest vpon thée. Gouerne thou my will, and all mine affections, that they may keepe within the limits of thy holie Law and Commaundements: that all my endeauour may be directed to the accomplishment and fulfilling of thy Statutes and Ordinances, so farre foorth as my weaknesse can wade through the rough waues of this most wicked world.

let thy spirit lead me to doe those things that please thy diuine maiestie, that at the last day, whē thou shalt sit vpon the Raine bowe, treading the Cloudes of the skies vnder thy féete, and compassed round about with legions of Angels, Cherubim and Seraphim, armies of Saintes, and holy Martyres, I may be receiued into the number of the elect, and enter into possession of that inheritaunce,

which neither Gold nor Siluer, but the precious Blood of thy beloued Sonne, my swéete Sauiour Iesus Christ, bought and purchased: Grant this most mercifull Father, for thy mercies sake, which are vnmeasurable: and for thy kindnesse sake, which is vnsearchable, and for thy tender loue sake, which is vnspeakable, Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer to keepe our tongue from speaking ill.
               
                  From an ill tongue.
                  Lord make me cleane:
                  To great and small,
                  good fayrh to meane.
               
               ALmighty God, which canst not away with a double heart, and to whom an euill tongue is fowle dishonour; giue me grace, (I beséech thée) to speake nothing but that which is true, right, and iust; not

hurting any with my tōgue which thou hast giuen mee to doe all men good, and to vse as an instrument for the sounding foorth of thy prayse and glory. And be, cause a lying and an euill Tongue, draweth the soul into death and destruction, put backe (I beséech thée) from my lippes, all guilefull speaches, all deceitfull communications, and al lying wordes. Moreouer, because thou. O Lord, art

truth it selfe, and therefore delightest in truth &amp; innocencie, giue me grace alwayes to enure my tongue vnto truth, abhorring all such talke as may offende thy diuine Maiestie, and diminish the honour due vnto thy holy name. Let thy sanctifying Spirit take charge ouer my heart, that I may doe good vnto all, and hurt vnto none: vttering yt with tongue, which I meane in heart, purposing

as well in déede as in word, nothing but good fayth &amp; true christianitie. Grant this, O God, for Iesus Christs sake. Amen.
            
            
               A Prayer to fast, and pray aright.
               
                  To Fast aright,
                  teach vs the way,
                  O Sauiour Christ,
                  we humbly pray.
               
               MOst bountifull Iesu, most sweet Iesu, most louing Iesu, which by thine

example diddest teach vs to Faste aright, not after the painted fashon of Pharisies and Hypocrites; but according to the plaine manner of vnfeigned Christians: I heartily &amp; humbly beséech thée, to giue me grace, to exercise my selfe in godly Fasting &amp; Prayer that the man of sinne, may be subdued and brought vnder: that my heart may be cleansed from all sinne and vnrighteousnesse, that

my thoughtes and cogitations may be scoured from corruption and filthinesse: that my wordes may not smell of Heathenish vnholinesse &amp; wickednesse; that my déedes may not be leauened with beastly wantonnesse: but that the course of my whole life, may be seasoned with the sauorie salt of sanctification, that whatsoeuer I thinke, whatsoeuer I say, or whatsoeuer I do, it may carry with

it some signe of the true Fast; namely, the fast from sin: vnto which fast, whosoeuer apply themselues, they are sure to be thy children, and are builded vpon a stedfast hope, to inherite that place of endlesse happinesse, which thou boughtest with thy precious blod. This fasting (I beseech thee) O sweete Sauiour, giue me grace to exercise; so shall my sinfull flesh bee kept in awe, as a seruant,

and my Spirit shall beare rule ouer it, and kéepe it in subiection. This, O Christ, and whatsoeuer else is necessary, vouchsafe of thy goodnesse, to grant vnto me thy poore creature, who aske it euen in zealous and hearty prayer. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer against wilfull sins and snares of Satan.
               
                  From wilfull sinne,
                  Lord saue vs,
                  That Satan may
                  not haue vs.
               
               Be vnto vs a brasen wale (most mercifull Father) against all the assaults of sinne, specially preserue vs from wilfull offences, and from transgressing of very malice, which is a wheting of thy wrath against vs, and a kindling of our owne confusion, without hope

of mercy at thy heauenly hands. O Lord, let vs not be so farre estranged from obedience, as of set purpose to runne into contempt of thy glorious name: let not our hearts become so flintie, as to be void of all feeling of sorrow for sinne: yea as to be emboldened to heape sinne vpon sinne, to our vtter shame. We know this is Satans séeking; we are assured this is the Diuels drift, we cannot be ignorant

that this is Belsebubs intent, therby to haue vs wiped (in thy wrath) out of the Booke of life, and so he to haue full sway ouer vs, as children of condemnation; But thou, O Lord, art mercifull, thou art gratious, thou art carefull ouer vs: defend vs therefore from all sinn, and chiefely from the sin of wilfulnes and malice, for the honour of thy name. Amen.
            
            
               
               A Prayer for the feare of the Lord, and loue of his word.
               
                  Increase in me.
                  O Lord, thy feare,
                  That to thy word,
                  I may giue eare.
               
               ETernall God, &amp; omnipotent Creatour, whose word layd the foundation of the whole world, &amp; furnished the same with all things behoofefull for the

maintenance of man: wee humbly beseech thee, increase in vs a louing feare of thee, and thy word: that whatsoeuer we are inioyned and commanded to doe therein, wee may rather neglect life, lands, goods; &amp; all precious possessions, then to leaue it vndone: knowing, that by hearing thy word, wee vnderstand thy will; which who so kéepeth, they are assured in spirit, to be thy faithfull seruants▪
                  
So fill vs therefore, O God, with this godlie feare, that we stopping our eares, and waxing dull against all worldly vanities, may bee rauished in heart and mind with the sweetenesse of thy word, wherein the comfortable promises of life &amp; saluation are conteined: that wee may exercise our selues therein day and night: that wee may reuerently vse it, as the healthfull foode of our

soules: that we may bring vp our children &amp; seruants, in the knowledge of the same: being fully perswaded, that there is nothing in the world comparable thereunto; for it exceedeth al treasure, &amp; whē al things are consumed, thy word shall continue in glory, brightnesse, &amp; perfection. O Lord, heare our praiers, and for the honour of thy name, heare the suites of thy poore seruants, euen

for thy beloued Sonne his sake▪ Iesus Christ our Sauiour: vnto whom, with thee, and the holy Ghost, one Deitie in Trinitie, be all laude, honour, prayse, dominion, power, glory, and maiestie, both now and world without end. Amen.
            
         
         
            
            The Contemplation of a Christian.
            
               
                  The misery,
                  of euery man,
                  Through Satans guile,
                  by sinne began:
                  But Christ vouchsaft
                  mans thrall t'asswage;
                  His power supprest,
                  old Satans rage.
               
               
                  WHen Sinne had blemished the happy estate of our first Parents, their whole race felt

the smart of their punnishment, and are at this day subiect vnto miserie.
               Iniquitie made a gappe for many calamities, sundry kinds of sicknesses, manifold maladies, &amp; infinite tribulations: which we had neuer tasted, if our first Parents had not offended.
               Lamentable is our case, by theire meanes: for the Lord of life hath punished their sins in their posteritie, by degrees of generaons,

throughout many ages.
               Little hope of health is in our selues: nay, there is in vs no hope of saluation at all: for by the subtiltie of Satan, sinne got dominion ouer vs, &amp; by sin, death.
               Iustly therefore are we subiect to so many miseries; &amp; in that we feele the heauy hand of God laying load vpon vs, it is for our offences, and our disordered life.
               
                  According as our deserts haue beene, so GOD hath dealt with vs: nay, he hath handled vs far better then we deserued; who by nature are the children of wrath and confusion.
               Most mercifully hath he looked vpon vs, and of his plentifull compassion, hee sent his boloued Sonne Christ Iesus into the world, that he by his bloodshed, might worke our releasement.
               
                  Like reprobates and condemned persons, wee had been plunged into the déep pit of hell, had not the death of Christ made full satisfaction for vs, &amp; wrought our Redemption.
               A Lion of the tribe of Iuda, a brāch springing from the stocke of Iesse, pittying vs poore desolate soules, by the vertue of his power suppressed Satans rage.
               Maruelous mightily did he vanquish the Diuel, our

mortall enemy; who intended our destruction and vtter ouerthrow, had not he in time brought our deliuerance to passe.
               Be ioyfull therefore, all nations, and lift vp your heads: extoll this Lambe of God; whose innocencie tooke away our iniquitie: and whose heauinesse, was our hapinesse.
               Euerlasting prayse and thankes be ascribed vnto his name, by whose death,

we are receiued to life: yea to eternall life: O prayse his glorious name for euer. Amen.
            
            
               
                  Death ouer vs
                  possest such power.
                  That meanes he sought,
                  vs to deuower:
                  But Iesus Christ
                  did set vs free:
                  To whom all prayse
                  and thankes giue wee.
               
               WEe are iustly subiect vnto death: for death is the reward of sinne and iniquitie.
               
                  Iniquitie hath changed our order of creatiō, which was perfect and Angeilcal.
               Life vnto vs, through sinne, is turned vnto death, and the mercy of God into iudgement.
               Lord haue mercy vpon vs; for in vs there is no hope of health: for Death hath power ouer vs.
               Increase of new calamities doe light vpon vs dayly; and we see our selues forsaken.
               
                  Among our enemies we walke continually, euen in the face of the Flesh, the World, and the Diuell.
               Miserable were wee, if Iesus Christ, with the shield of safetie should not ouershadow vs.
               Little should wee differ from the children of wrath: nay, our case were as comfortlesse as theirs.
               A most mercifull Sauiour, art thou, O Christ; A most mercifull Redeemer,

and Aduocate.
               Make vs thankfull vnto thee for thy goodnesse: for thou didst set vs free from all misfortune.
               Blessed be thy name, and great be thy glory, through out all the world, for this thy kindnesse.
               Early &amp; late, thou art to be praysed: yea, in ye assemblies &amp; cōgregations of the faythfull &amp; righteous, thou in thy greatnes, O God, shalt be gloryfied, Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  The World is vaine,
                  and all therein;
                  Yea, man is vile,
                  because of sinne:
                  Yet Iesus Christ
                  redeemed all,
                  To Death, and Hell
                  that were in thrall.
               
               WOe be to this world, for it is as vaine as smoke: yea, it is more vaine then vanitie it selfe.
               In riches, there is shame: and in pleasure, there is punishment, because of sinne and iniquitie.
               Like a dreame is the life

of man: his dayes are but a spanne long, and his time tarryeth not,
               Like a Fansie, or a Maygame; which hath but an houres delight &amp; recreatiō.
               In the world there is nothing more common then wickednesse: in the world there is no goodnesse.
               Al are bent vnto mischiefe and villanie: the sonnes of men haue set their heartes vpon euill.
               Mightie men, and poore

slaues, all haue troden the path of sinne: and vanitie is in all their wayes.
               Like Sheepe without a Shepheard, they are gone astray: and had beene lost, if Christ had not holpen.
               All were in the mouth of Hell gates, and had sunke in their owne shame and destruction.
               Miserably had they perished, if that good shepheard of our soules had not taken vpon him our deliuerance.
               
                  Bring Frankinsence vnto his Altas (O ye people) prayse him, who is prayse worthy, for his power and magnificence.
               Enter into his Temple and Sanctuary, sing songs all with one consent to the honour of his name, for all the benefits and goodnesse, which hee hath plentifully bestowed vpon vs at all times: &amp; let al the faithfull answer, and say, Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  Gods prouidence is wonderfull:
                  He shewes himselfe most merciful
                  In all our wayes defending vs,
                  And by his grace amending vs.
               
               WIthout th'assistance of Gods spirit, miserable were the condition of all mankind: yea, most miserable.
               In sinne we are conceiued, in sin we are brought vp, and the whole course of our life is full of iniquitie.
               Like a menstruous cloth,

so is our conuersotion in the sight of God, and his holy Angels.
               Like a filthy and loathsome Sinke, so is our behauiour before the face of the faithfull.
               Iudgment is more méete for vs, then mercy: yet it hath pleafed God, to deale with vs in mercy.
               And that doth daily experience testifie: for we sée manifest proofes of his prouidence.
               
                  Meate and cloathing, and whatsoeuer is necessary toward the maintenance of man, he hath giuen vs.
               Like a Father, he tendereth vs, and esteemeth vs as Children, begotten a new by free Grace.
               As a Henue hoouering ouer her Chickens; so doth he defend vs in all our wayes, day by day.
               Mercie is on his right hand: Mercie goeth before him; and vpon Mercy, is

the seate of his Maiestie built.
               Be glad therefore, and clappe your hands, all people: for God is gratious and fauourable.
               Euermore shall his praise bée in my mouth; I will talke of his goodnesse euen among mine enemies: yea without ceasing, I will extoll and prayse his name. Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  The holy Ghost doth sanctifie,
                  Such as in faith doth fructifie:
                  The wicked stil wax worse &amp; wors,
                  And run into Gods heauy curse.
               
               WOrship and honour, bee giuen vnto God the holy Ghost, by whom we are sancctified vnto life euerlasting.
               Infinite is thy working; in holinesse he doth renew the flintie heart, &amp; maketh it relent at Gods iudgementes.
               
                  Least Satan should triumph ouer vs, therefore hath he vouchsafed to clense and purifie our spirit.
               Let vs therefore ascribe vnto him all honour: for through sanctification, wee are made heires of saluatiō
               
               Iniquitie defiled our soules: but through fayth increasing in vs, we felt an inward reformation.
               And hauing our eyes opened, we saw our filthinesse; and by the gift of grace became

new creatures.
               Many were the enormities which reigned in vs; but the holy Ghost purged vs of all, and set vs free.
               Long wandred we in bywayes of wickednesse but are now restored againe vnto righteousnesse.
               As for the vngodly, they haue no part of this sanctifying Spirite: but dayly waxe worse and worse.
               Much like vnto such as GOD hath cursed in his

wrath and denounced sentence of death against thē.
               Be glad, O yee iust: for you are they whom God loueth, &amp; in whom he magnifieth his owne name.
               Excellent &amp; wonderfull in working is God the holie Ghost: who with the Father and the Sonne, be praysed and magnified for euer. Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  It is not wealth,
                  to haue at will,
                  That can vs keepe,
                  and saue from ill:
                  Gods grace it is
                  which worketh that:
                  Let vs reioyce,
                  therefore thereat.
               
               WHat is the Wealth of this world, but Winde? and what Riches, but the shadow of Smoke?
               In Wealth to trust, is to trust to a broken réede: and in Riches to boast, is to boast in a thing of naught.
               
                  Lay wealth to the grace of God, and what is it? Euen filthy Dunge, and a worse thing.
               Lay Riches to Gods Grace, and what are they? Euen painted shewes of transitory vanities.
               In Wealth therefore glory not; for there is in it, no power to preserue from the euill day.
               And of Riches brag not, for in them is no hope of health in the dangerous

time of trouble.
               Make the grace of God, the perfect ioy of thy heart, and trust thereunto, as vnto a Brazen wall.
               Looke for safetie from thence, in the perilous season: for the grace of God is a strong refuge.
               Arme thy soule therewith, as with Iron-plate Armour: so shall the assaultes of thy aduersaries doe thee no harme.
               Make thy moue vnto the

Almightie in the time of tribulation: &amp; he shall furnish thee with his grace.
               Be thankfull vnto him, when thou hast receiued it: and shew not thy selfe in any case vnkind.
               Euery day prayse him for his goodnesse, and extol his greatnesse among the multitude: for he is good and gratious to his chosen: O magnifie and prayse him all people. Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  To loue to liue,
                  in peace and ease,
                  The Lord of life,
                  doth much displease:
                  Let such as lacke,
                  and comfort craue.
                  Thy helping hand,
                  in hazard haue.
               
               WHen God hath blessed thée with abundaunce of Benefites▪ so vse them as God may be well pleased.
               In peace pamper not thy

selfe: for that is the way to minister cause of courage and loftinesse to the flesh.
               Looke vnto the Lord, who hath giuen thee these good giftes: and become not slouthfull with ease.
               Life commeth from the Lord: and whatsoeuer belongeth therevnto, it proceedeth from his goodnes.
               In prosperitie, be mindfull of aduersitie: and let not the plentie of thy peace make thee proud.
               
                  A Father of the fatherles, shew thy selfe in necessity: &amp; shut not vp the sluces of mercy against the poore.
               Make not thy Mony thy God: and hoord it not vp for thine owne profit onely, not regarding others need.
               Let not the poore lie comfortlesse: let not them starue and perish, whom it is in thee to helpe.
               Apply thy selfe to works of mercy: and stretch out thy hand to them that are

needy and succourlesse.
               Mooue not God (who gaue thee these giftes) to wrath; least in his anger, he turne all to thy shame.
               Beware therefore, and let Wisedome rule thee in thy wayes: so shalt thou not offend, or doe amisse.
               Extoll thy Creator, and say, that he is gracious &amp; mercifull: a louing God, and a most bountifull Father vnto his Children. Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  Looke ere thou leape,
                  and vse thine eyes:
                  Else shalt thou shew,
                  thy selfe vnwise;
                  The simple sort,
                  with councell ayde:
                  Thus ought thy talent
                  out be layde.
               
               WIsedome is the blessing of God, and it is much more excellent then Gold, Siluer, or precious Stones.
               In time of necessitie, it is a present remedie, and a sufficient refuge in perill

and ieobadie.
               Little auayleth worldly policie, where this Wisedome wanteth: O happie is he, whom God hath armed therewith.
               Leaue riches, forsake honor, set pleasure at naught to come to the enioying of this preacious treasure,
               Immortalitie followeth this wisdome: and such as haue it are sure to grow in estimation and fame.
               Aske it of him, who is the

Well of Wisedome, from whom it commeth, euen the Lord God Almighty.
               Make not thy boast thereof, neither apply it to thy priuate profite: but extend the same to the succour of the simple.
               Learne this lesson, That it is but lent vnto thee of the Lord: thou art the Steward therof but for a time.
               Abuse it not, lest it turne to thine owne cōfusion: for as it is the gift of God, so

will be he honored therein.
               Make it not an instrumēt of follie, least God ouerthrow thée in the vanitie of thine owne mind.
               Be a counseller to the vnlearned, and teach the ideot vnderstanding: so shalt thou glorifie GOD in thy wisedome.
               Enterprise nothing vnaduisedly: in all thy beginnings, procéedings, and endings, remember God. Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  If thou be poore,
                  hold thee content,
                  It is a crosse▪
                  
                  which God hath sent
                  Remember Iob,
                  a man most iust,
                  From stately seat,
                  cast downe to dust▪
                  
               
               WIth thine estate not to be contented, it is to repine and murmure at the appoyntment and ordinance of God.
               In pouertie be not desperate: but fixe all thy hope vpon the rocke of Gods

prouidence: for he is faithfull.
               Lament thy sin, and bée sorry for the same: consider also with thy selfe, that pouertie is Gods chastisement.
               Let not pouerty therfore so pull thee downe, that thou shouldest thereupon mistrust the Lord God to be mercifull.
               It is a crosse layd vpon thee in this life, to keepe thee in subiection, and to

make thee know thine owne estate.
               A happy child art thou, that canst reforme thy selfe, and amend that which is amisse in thee, by his fatherly correction.
               Marke the example of Iob, a man so iust, so faithfull, &amp; so righteous, that the Diuell of Hell could not preuaile against him.
               Look vpon him, how he was tormented, how hee was brought low, being

sometimes placed in exceeding great prosperity.
               All the blessings of God, belonging to this life, hee had them in abundāce: yet all turned into neede and beggerie.
               Miserable was his estate yea, most vile and filthy, in the face of the world: yet God cast vpon him a carefull eye.
               Bee mindfull of these things; for profite insueth therevpon: and in thy pouerty

arso learne to be patient and méeke.
               End not thy dayes in despaire as the wicked doe: seeke not by vnpatience &amp; violence, to preuent Gods appoynment: tarrie the time which thy Creatour hath ordeyned; it is thine, mine, and all our duties, to yeeld our willes to Gods will. waite his leasure therefore whose name be praysed for euermore. Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  Loue euery man,
                  owe no man grudge:
                  God sits aboue,
                  as soueraigne Iudge:
                  He seeth all thinges,
                  aboue, below:
                  And euery where
                  an eye doth throw,
               
               WRath is the way to vengeance: a foule and diuelish vice disallowed of God, and horrible among men.
               It is a Fire which consumeth, a Canker which eateth, a Mouth which fretteth:

the marke whereat it shooteth, is Mischiefe.
               Let not thy heart lie open therevnto, least the Diuell thereby getting entraunce, possesse thée, and carry thée headlong into confusion.
               Lay apart all occasions of grudge; hate no man, loue al men: knowing this, That Loue is the fulfilling of Gods law.
               Iudge ill of none, thinke well of all: for God reserueth iudgement and vengeance,

vnto himselfe.
               Against thine enemies vse not violence: but rather in charity (as thou art commaunded) vse forbearance.
               Make the best of that which is amisse, for therein thou shalt shew thy selfe méeke: howbeit, winke not at wickednesse.
               Looke vp vnto Heauen, and thinke vpon him that sits aboue▪ séeing and marking the thoughts &amp; déeds of all men.
               
                  All thinges are manifest vnto him; yea, whatsoeuer we doe in corners, he séeth as plainly as at noone day.
               Mocke not thy selfe therfore with thine owne imaginations, neither be thou seduced in the vanitie of thine owne fantasies·
               Be not forgetfull of him, who vttered this voyce: Heauen is my seate, and the Earth my footstole.
               Euerlasting prayse be ascribed vnto his name glorie,

maiestie, and power, belongeth vnto him, for euermore. Amen.
            
            
               
                  In that we haue,
                  the world at will,
                  And take delight,
                  to follow ill;
                  Neglecting God
                  in holy word:
                  Against our soules,
                  we whet a sword
               
               WHat doth it profit a man to be Lord ouer the whole World, and yet to be the seruant and slaue of sinne.
               
                  It is euen as if we should mingle poyson with swéet dainties, &amp; in tasting them, to swellowe downe our owne death.
               Let not thy minde therefore, be drowned in ye vaine delights of this world: but vse them as they are made, euen with modestie.
               Lay not inwait for them, to enioy them with excesse: least they turne thée to destruction &amp; vtter vndoing.
               In the Rich man, view a

patterne of wantonesse: who forgetting mercie, felt the heate of Gods heauie iudgement.
               Amidest the scorching flames, he lay crying without comfort; because he abused the benefits of Gods creation.
               Making them instrumentes to serue his beastly appetites, neglecting in the meane time, all deedes of Christian charitie.
               Let not vs be so rauished

with worldly pleasures▪ that we forgetting GOD, should disherite our selues of th'heauenly inheritance.
               As the rich man did, who in the midst of his banquetting viandes, and pleasant melodie despised the poore.
               Most mortall enemies to our selues are we in so doing: and stopping our eares at the word of God, wee weaue our owne woe,
               Because the word of life, through our default, is

made vnto vs the sword of death, which doth strike downe to hell.
               Eternall God, and most mercifull Father, illuminate our vnderstandinges, inspire vs with heauenly knowledge, lighten our wittes, and giue vs grace to be spiritually minded, that we may vse thy giftes, blessinges and benefites, to the glory of thy name. Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  A day there is,
                  when all shall rise,
                  Out of their Graues,
                  in wonderous wise:
                  The elect of God,
                  long for that day:
                  Come, come, O Christ,
                  come soone, we say.
               
               WRetched were wee, if there were not an other World, besides this wicked World, transitorie and corruptible.
               In a miserable case were we, if the children of God, (whom we hope our selues

to be) wayted in vaine for another world.
               Lamentable were our lot; yea, accursed our condition, if our happinesse were not the life to come:
               Looke we in wast for the comming of our Christ? No, no; he will come at the sound of the last Trumpe from Heauen.
               In maiestie will he come, to iudge the whole world, and to giue generall sentence against the wicked

and vnrighteous.
               All shall rise out of their graues, and shall see him with their bodily eyes: the iust to their ioy, the vngodly to their paine.
               Many legions of Angels shall attent vpon him, and shall shew the brightenesse of his glory, maiestie, and celestiall power.
               Lord Iesus; thy chosen children long to see that day: yea, they labour and are in trauel, vntill that day

of comfort come.
               Abridge &amp; shorten these troublesome times, wherein thy children are set at naught, and hasten the day of their resurrection.
               Make speed, sweet Iesus, come quicklie, that the kingdome of Satan may be ouerthrowne, and the powers infernall suppresed.
               Be mindefull of thy faithfull flocke, which wander vp and downe in this wildernesse,

like Lambes among venomous wolues.
               Ende the daies of this our mortalitie, and let vs heare that sweete voyce: Come yee blessed, possesse the Kingdome, prepared for you from the beginning of the world. Amen, Amen.
            
         
         
            
            The Seauen Petitions of the Lords Prayer, with a briefe exposition thereof, drawne out of holy Scripture.
            
               Our Father, which art in Heauen.
               DOubtlesse thou art our Father: Although Abraham bee ignorant of vs, (or would refuse vs, to bee

his children,) and Israell know vs not: yet thou, O Lord, art our Father, and our Redéemer: thy name is for euer. Esay. 63.16.
                  
               
               There is one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme, one God &amp; Father of all, which is aboue all, in power, (&amp; through all) by his prouidence,) &amp; in vs all, (by his grace,) Ephes. 4.5.6.
               
               The Lord is in his holie palace, the Lords throne is in the heauen, his eies will

consider the poore, and his eie-lids will trie the children of men. Psal. 11.4.
               
               The heaurn is my throne and the earth is my footstoole, (such is the greatnesse of Gods Maiestie,) Esaie. 66.1..
               
               But our conuersation is in Heauen, (in minde and affection,) from whence also we looke for the Sauiour, euen the Lord Iesus Christ. Philip. 3.22.
                  
               
            
            
               
               
                  1. Halowed be thy name
               OVr help is in the name of the Lord, which hath made Heauen and Earth. Psal. 124.8.
               The Lords name be praised from the rising of the Sunn, to the going downe of the same. Psal. 113.3.
               Kinges of the earth, and all people; Princes and all Iudges of the World: Young men, and Maydes:

also, Old men, and Children, let them prayse the name of the Lord; for his name only is to be exalted, and his prayse aboue the earth &amp; the heauens. Psal. 148.11.12.13.
            
            
               
                  2. Thy Kingdome come,
               THe kingdome of God is not meat nor drink; but righteousnes &amp; peace, and ioy in the holy Ghost. Rom. 14.17.
               
               
                  But rather séeke ye after the kingdome of God, &amp; all these things, (which are but accessaries, and common as wel to the wicked, as the godlie,) shalbe ministred vnto you. Luke. 12.31
                   Feare not little flocke, for it is your Fathers pleasure to giue you the kingdome, (which is the chefest thing that can be giuen. (Luke. 12.32 In my Fathers house are manie dwelling places: I goe to prepare a

place for you, (So that there is not onely a place for Christ, but for all that are his.) John. 14.2.
               
            
            
               
                  3. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heauen,
               IN the roll of the booke it is written of me, I desired to doe thy good will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my hart Psal 40.7.8
               
               That seruant that knew

his Maisters will &amp; prepa: red not himselfe, neither did according to his will, shalbe beaten with many stripes. Luk. 12 47.
               
               For this is the will of God, euen your sanctification: and that ye should abstaine from fornication, (And dedicate your selues wholy to God) that euery one of you should know, how to possesse his vessell in holinesse and honour: (His body that is prophaned

by such filthinesse.) 1. Thes 4.3, 4.
               
               And fashion not your selues like vnto this world, but be ye chāged by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prooue what is the good will of GOD, and acceptable, and perfect. (Whatsoeuer is not agreeable to Gods will, is euill, displeasant, &amp; vnperfect.) Rom. 12.2.
               
               Wherefore, be ye not vnwise, but vnderstand what,

the will of the Lord is. Ephes. 5.17.
               
            
            
               
                  4. Giue vs this day our daily bread.
               BEhold, the eye of the Lord is vpon them that feare him, (he worketh that in mercy, which man by no meanes can compasse,) and vpon them that trust in his mercie: to deliuer their soule from death,

and to preserue them in famine. Psal. 33, 18.19.
               
               The eyes of all waight vpon thee, and thou giuest them their meate in due season: thou openest thine hand, and fillest all things liuing with thy good pleasure. (Gods prouidence stretcheth both to man and beast.) Psal. 145.15.
               
               Man shall not liue by bread only, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of GOD.

                  (The order that God hath ordeined to maintaine his creatures by, is here ment) Deut. 8.3. Matth 4.4.
               
               The cheefe thing of life, is water &amp; bread, &amp; clothing, &amp; lodging to couer thy shame. Eccles. 29.23.
               
               Two things haue I required of thee: denie mee them not before I die. Remoue far from me vanitie &amp; lies, giue me not pouerty nor riches: feede me with foode conuenient for mee,

least I bee full, &amp; deny thee, and say: Who is the Lord? (For Riches make men forget their Maker.) Or least I be poore, and steale, &amp; take the name of my God in vaine Prou. 30.7.8.9.
               
               When we haue foode and raiment, let vs therwith be content. 1. Tim. 6.8.
               
            
            
               
               
                  5. And forgiue vs our trespasses as we forgiue them that trespasse against vs.
               FOrgiue thy neighbour the hurt that hée hath don to thee: (for man ought not to seeke vengeance,) so shall thy sinnes be forgiuē thée also when thou prayest. Should a man beare hatred against a man, and desire forgiuenesse of the Lord: He will shewe

no mercy to a man which is like himselfe, and will hée aske forgiuenesse of his owne sinnes: Eccles. 28.2.3.4.
               
               Iudge not, and ye shall not be iudged: condemne not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgiue, and ye shall be forgiuen. Giue, and it shall be giuen vnto you, a good measure, pressed downe, shaked togeather, and running ouer, shal men giue into your bosome.

For, with what measure you meate, with the same shall men meate vnto you againe. Luke. 6.37.38.
               
               Loue your enemies, doe well to them which hate you. Luke. 6.27.
               
               There shall be iudgement mercilesse, to him that sheweth no mercy: and mercie reioyceth against iudgement: (and feareth it not.) Iam. 2.13.
               
            
            
               
               
                  6. And lead vs not into temptation.
               BE sober and watch; for your aduersarie the Diuell, as a roring Lion, walketh about, séeking whom he may deuour. 1. Pet. 5.8.
               In whom the God of this world, (euen Satan,) hath blinded the mindes, that is, of infidels, that the light of the glorious Gospell of Christ, which is the image of God, (in respect of his

office,) should not shine vnto them. 2. Cor. 4.4.
               Whensoeuer a man heareth the word of the kingdome, and vnderstandeth it not, the euill one commeth. (euen the Diuell,) and taketh away that, which was sowen in his hart. Mat. 13, 19.
               The Prince that ruleth in the aire, euen the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience. Ephes. 2.2.
               
                  Loue not the world, (as it is aduersarie to God:) neither the thinges that are in the world. If any man loue the world, the loue of the Father is not in him, &amp;c. 1. Iohn. 3.15.16.17.
               We know that we are of God, &amp; the whole world lieth in wickednesse, (al men, as of them selues, lie as it were busied in euill.) 1. Iohn. 15.19.
               Know ye not that the amitie of the world, is the

enmitie of god? Whosoeuer therefore, will be a friend of the world, maketh himselfe the enimie of God. Iam. 4.4.
               For all that is borne of God, ouercōmeth ye world: and this is the victorie that ouercommeth the world; euen our fayth. Who is it that ouercommeth the worlde, but hee which beleeueth that Iesus is the sonne of GOD: 1. Iohn. 5.4.5.
               
                  That the righteousnesse of the law, (that, which the law requireth,) might be fulfilled in vs, which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit: For they that are after the flesh, sauour the thinges of the flesh, (their will, vnderstanding, reason, wit, &amp; all, is fleshlie.) The wisdome of the flesh is death, it is enmitie against God: They that are in the flesh, can not please God. Rom. 8·4
            
            
               
               
                  7. But deliuer vs from euill. Amen.
               HElpe vs, O GOD, of our saluation, (seeing we haue none other Sauiour,) for the glory of thy name, and deliuer vs. Psal. 69.8.
               In the day of my trouble, I will call vpon thée, for thou hearest me. Psal. 86.7.
               There shall none euill come vnto thée. He shall

giue his Angels charge ouer thée, to keepe thee in all thy wayes: they shall beare thee in their hands, that thou hurt not thy foote against a stone. Because he hath loued me, (Gods protection promised,) therefore will I deliuer him, I will exalt him, because he hath (known my name. He shall call vpon me, and I will heare him: I will be with him in trouble: I will deliuer him, and glorifie

him. &amp;c. Psal. 91.9.10.11.12. &amp;c.
               
               
                  O Lord, giue vs grace to learne this, and liue thereafter, Amen.
               
            
         
         
            
            The beliefe of a Christian, commonly called the Apostles Creede; diuided into twelue Articles and expounded.
            
               
                  1. I beleeue in God the Father Almighty, maker of heauen and earth.
               HEare, O Israel, the LORD our God, is Lord onely. Deut. 6.4.
               Blessed be GOD, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus

Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort. 2. Cor. 1.3.
               Thou Lord in the begining hast stablished th'earth, and the heauens are the works of thine hands. Psal. 102.25. Heb. 1.10.
               Haue we not all one Father: Hath not one GOD made vs: Malach. 2.10.
               By the word of the Lord were the heauens made and all the hoast of them by the breath of his mouth. Psal▪
                   33.6.
            
            
               
               
                  2. And in Iesus Christ, his onely Sonne our Lord.
               THere is but one GOD, which is the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him: And one Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. 1. Cor. 8 6.
               If we walke in the light, as he is in the light, we haue fellowship one with another, Christ with vs, and we with our selues,) &amp; the blood of Iesus Christ his

Sonne, cleanseth vs from all our sinnes. 1. Ioh. 1.7.
               Who hath deliuered vs from the power of darknes and hath translated vs into the kingdome of his deare Sonne, in whom wée haue redemption, through his blood, that is, the forgiuenesse of sinnes. Colos. 1.13.14.
               This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am wel pleased. Math. 3.17.
            
            
               
               
                  3. Which was conceiued by the holy Ghost, borne of the Ʋirgin Mary.
               BVt when the fulnesse of time was come, God sent foorth his Sonne made of a woman, &amp; made vnder the Law (or subiect to the law,) that he might redéeme them which were vnder the Law; that wee might receiue the adoption of the sonnes Galat. 4.4.5.
               
               And the Word was made

flesh, (Christ was formed, and made man, by the operation of the holy Ghost, without the working of man,) and dwelt among vs, and we saw the glory thereof, as the glorie of the onely begotten sonne of the Father, full of grace and truth. Ioh. 1.14.
               
               The holy Ghost shall come vpon thée, (This was spoken to Mary,) and the power of the most high shal ouershadow thée:) it shall

be a secret operation of the holy Ghost:) therefore also, that holy thing which shall be borne of thée, shall be called, the Sonne of God. (Hee must be without sinne, which must take away sinne.) Luke 1.35.
               
               Behold, a Virgin shalbe with child, and shal beare a Sonne, and they shall call his name Emanuel, which is by interpretation, God with vs. Matth. 1.23. Esaie. 7.14.
               
               
                  When Marie was betrothed to Ioseph, before they came togeather, (before he tooke her home to him,) she was found with Child by the holy Ghost. Math. 1.18.
               
            
            
               
                  4. Suffred vnder Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, buried, and descended into Hell.
               FOr Christ also suffered for vs, leauing vs an example, that we should follow

his steps. Who his owne selfe bare our sinnes in his body, on the trée, that we being deliuered from sinne, should liue in righteousnesse, by whose stripes we are healed. 1. Pet. 2.21.24.
               
               They scourged Iesus, they stripped him, they put vpon him a Scarlet robe, (to deride and mocke him, because he called himselfe a King,) they gaue him Vineger to drinke, mingled

with Gall, (to open his veines, &amp; so to hasten his death: this was giuen him hanging vpon the crosse,) they crucified him betwéen two théeues, they cast lots for the parting of his garments they set a scornefull writing ouer his head, they reuiled him, &amp; ceassed not, till he gaue vp the Ghost- Matth. 27.26, 28, 29, 30, 34 35, 37, 50.
               
               So Ioseph tooke the body, and wrapped it in a

cleane Linnen cloth, and put it in his new Tombe, (Christs burying doth so much the more verifie his death and resurrection,) which he had heawen in a rocke, and rolled a great stone to the doore of the sepulchre, and departed. Matth. 27.59 60.
               
               I know that ye seeke Iesus, which was crucified: he is not heere, for he is risen, as he sayd. Come, see the place where the

Lord was layd. &amp;c. Matth. 28.5.6.
               
               God made him to be sinn for vs, which knew no sinne, (a sacrifice for sinne,) that we should be made the righteousnesse of God in him, (By inputation, when wee shall bee clad with Christes righteousnesse.) 2. Cor. 5.21.
               
               Hee destroyed, through death, him that had the power of death, that is the Diuell: and that he might

deliuer all them, which for feare of death, (and Gods anger,) were all their life time subiect to bondage. Heb. 2.14.15.
               
               Christ hath abolished death, &amp; brought life and immortalitie to light, through the Gospell. 2. Tim. 1.10.
               
               Death is swallowed vp in victory, O death, where is thy sting: O graue, where is thy victory: 1 Cor. 15.55.
               
            
            
               
               
                  5. And the third day he rose againe from the dead.
               IEsus Christ was deliuered to death for our sinnes, and is risen againe for our iustification, (to accomplish and make perfect our iustification▪) Rom. 4.25.
               
               Goe quickly; and tell his Disciples that he is risen from the dead: and behold he goeth before you into Galilie, there ye shall see

him: loe, I haue told you. (The Angell assureth the women, that come to see Christes Sepulchre, of his resurrection.) Math. 28.7. Mark. 16.6.7. Luke. 24.6. Joh 1, 20.1. Act 1.21.22.
               
               But now Christ is risen from the dead, &amp; was made the first fruites of them that sleept: (by his resurrection, being the first, we are all assured of our resurrection.) 1 Cor. 15.20.
               
               Destroy this Temple,

and in three dayes I will rise it vp againe. (This he meant of his body, which should die, and did rise againe the third day after his death.) Iohn. 2.19.21.
               
               First of all, I deliuered vnto you that which I receiued, (or, learned by Gods worde,) how yt Christ died for our sinnes, according to the scriptures, and that he was buried, rose againe the third day, and was seene of Cephas then

of the twelue, (though Iudas wanted, yet they were so called still:) after that, of more then fiue hundred brethren at once, &amp;c. 1. Cor. 15.3.4.5.6▪
                  
               
            
            
               
                  6. He ascended into heauen, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almightie.
               ANd it came to passe, that as he blessed them, he departed from them and was caried vp into heauen. Luke. 24.51.
               
                  So, after the Lord had spoken vnto them, he was receiued into Heauen, and sate at the right hand of God. Mark. 16.19.
               And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken vp, (whereby they knew certainely whither he went,) for a cloude tooke him vp out of their sight, Act. 1.9.
               It is Christ which is dead: yea or rather, which is risen againe, who is also

at the right hand of God, and maketh request for vs. Rom. 8.34.
            
            
               
                  7. From thence he shall come againe to iudge the quike and the dead.
               THis Iesus: which is taken vp from you into heauen, shall so come, as ye haue séene him go into heauen: (euen the true Redeemer, to gather vs vnto him.) Acts. 1.11.
               
               
                  And when the Sonne of man commeth in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then shall hee fit vpon the throne of his glorie. Math. 25.31.
               
               And then shall they see the Sonne of man comming in the cloudes, with great power and glorie. Mark. 13.26.
               
               And when these thinges begin to come to passe, then looke vp, and lift vp your heades, for your redemption

draweth neere. (The effect of that redemption shall appeare, which Iesus Christ hath purchased.) Luk. 21.27.28.
               
            
            
               
                  8. I beleeue in the holy Ghost.
               GOe therefore and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and the Sonne, &amp; the holy Ghost. Matth. 28.19.
               
               But the Comforter, which is the holy Ghost, whom the Father wil send

in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all thinges to your remembrance, which I haue told you. Iohn 14.26.
               
               This holy Ghost, is called somtime, The spirit of truth, proceeding from the Father, (because hee worketh the truth in vs.) Iohn. 14.17 &amp;. 15.26. some time, the Spirit of the Father, speaking in his Ministers. Matth. 10.20. sometime, the Spirit of the

Sonne. Rom. 8.9. sometime the good Spirit. Psal. 143.10. sometime, an holy Oyntment. 1. Iohn. 2.20. sometime, a Comforter. Iohn. 14.16. &amp; 15.26. &amp; 16.7. sometime, the earnest of our Inheritaunce, (The holy Ghost is the gage or pledge of our second redemption, which shall be at the possession of our inheritance in heaued. (Ephes. 1.14 somtime, the earnest of the Spirit in

our heartes. 2. Cor. 1.22.
               
               No man can say, that Iesus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost 1. Cor. 12.3.
               
            
            
               
                  9. The holy Catholik Church the Communion of Saints.
               CHrist loued his Church, and gaue himselfe for it, that he might sanctifie it, and cleanse it, by the washing of water, through the word, (Baptisme is a token of the Churches consecration,) that he might make

it vnto himselfe a glorious Church, not hauing spot or wrinckle, (because it is couered and clad with his righteousnesse and holinesse,) that it should be holie, and without blame. Ephes. 5.27.
               
               I am the Rose of the field, and the Lillie of the vallies: like a Lillie among the thornes, so is my Loue among the doughters, &amp;c. (Christ preferreth his Church aboue all other

thinges) Cant. 2.1.2
               
               For other foundation can no man lay, then that which is layd, which is Iesus Christ. 1. Cor. 3.11.
               
               Know ye not, that ye are the temple of God, &amp; that the spirit of God dwelleth in you: 1. Cor. 3.16. In this Church are many members, but one body in Christ Rom. 12.4.5. 1 Cor. 6.15. Let vs follow the truth in loue: and in al things grow vp into him, which is the

head that is Christ. Christ being head o
                        •
                      his Church. nourisheth his members, and ioyneth them togeather by ioynts, &amp;c. (Ephe. 4.15.
               
               Christ is the head of the body of the Church Col. 1.18.
               
               Now reioyce I in my sufferings for you, (or your commoditie,) and fulfil the rest of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, (for Christ suffereth dayly in his members, as partaker

of their infirmities and therefore a reuenger of their iniuries,) for his body sake, which is the Church, Coloss. 1.24. (the edification of the Church is heere ment.)
               
               There are many members, but one body. 1. Cor. 12 20.
               
               Now ye are the body of Christ, and members for your part. (For all Churches dispersed throughout the world, are diuers,

members of one bodie.) 1. Cor. 12.27.
               
               God is not the author of confusion, but of peace; as we see in all the Churches of the Saints. 1. Cor. 14.33
               
            
            
               
                  10 The forgiuenes of sinnes.
               WHose sinnes so euer ye remit, they are remitted: and whose sinnes soeuer ye retaine, they are retained. Iohn. 20.23.
               He that shall beleeue, and be baptised shall be saued:

but he that will not beléeue shal be damned. Luk. 16.16
               It behoued Christ to suffer, and to rise againe from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sinnes should be preached in his name among all nations. Luk. 24.46.47.
               And GOD saw their workes, that they turned from their euil wayes: (the fruites of their repentance proceeding of fayth, planted

by the Prophets preaching to the people of Niniueth:) and God repented of the euill that he had said, that hee would doe vnto them, and hee did it not. Ionah. 3.10.
               Stand in the wayes, and behold, and aske for the old way, (wherein the Patriarches and prophets walked, directed by the word of God, signifying, that there is no true way, but that which God prescribeth,)

which is the good way, and walke therein, and ye shall finde rest for your soules. Ierem. 6.16.
            
            
               
                  11. The resu
                     •
                  rection of the body.
               FOr since by Man came death, by Man came also the resurrectiō of the dead. 1. Cor. 15.21.
               
               Behold, I shew you a secret thing, We shall not all sleepe, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in

the twinckling of an eye at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall blow, and the dead shall be raysed vp incorruptible, &amp; we shall be changed. (When the Lord commeth to iudgement, some of the Saints shall be aliue, whō he will change, euen as if they were dead; so that this change shall be to them in stead of death. 1. Cor. 15.51.52.
               
               The Lord himselfe shall descend from heauen with

a shoute, and with the voice of Th'archangel and with the trumpet of God, &amp; the dead in Christ shal rise first Then shall we which liue, &amp; remaine, (euen we which are aliue, or shall be then found liuing,) be brought vp with them also in the cloudes to meete the Lord in the ayre▪ and so shall wée be euer with the Lord. (In this sodaine taking vp, there shall be a kinde of change of the qualities of

our body; which shallbe as a kind of death.) 1. Thes. 16.17.
               
               And he shall send his Angels, with a great sound of a trumpet▪ and they shal gather togeather his elect, from the foure windes, and from the one end of the heauen vnto the other, &amp;c. Matth▪ 24.31.
               
               And though after my skin, Wormes destroy my body, yet shall I sée God in my flesh: whom I my

selfe shall sée, and mine eies shall behold▪ and none other for me, though my reines are consumed within mee. (Iobs full hope, that both soule and body should enioy the presence of God, in the last resurrection. Iob. 19.26.27.
               
               I know that he shall rise againe in the resurrection at the last day. (The words of Martha to Iesus, concerning dead Lazarus. The errour of the Sadduces,

(men marueilous quidditiue) concerning the resurrection, is here confuted.) Iohn. 11.14.
               
            
            
               
                  12. And the life euerlasting, Amen.
               
                  I Am the resurrection, and the life, (Christ restoreth vs from death, to giue vs euerlasting life,) hée that beléeueth in me, though he were dead, yet shal he liue. And whosoeuer liueth, and beleeueth in me, shall neuer die. Iohn 11.25.26.
               
               
                  I am the liuing bread, (which giue life to the world,) which came downe from heaven: if any man eate of this bread, hée shall liue for euer; and the bread that I giue you, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world. Iohn. 9.51.
               
               Thou hast the wordes of eternall life. (Then without Christ, there is but death: for his word onely leadeth vs to life. Joh. 6.68.
               
               
                  This is the will of him that sent me, that euery one which séeth the Sonne, and beleeueth in him, should haue euerlasting life, and I will raise him vp at the last day. Iohn. 6.40
               
               Verily, verily, I say vnto you, hée that heareth my word, and beléeueth in him that sent me, hath euerlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but hath passed from death vnto life. Iohn. 5.24.25.26.
               
               
                  The houre shall come, in the which, al that are in the graues, shall heare his voyce, and they shall come foorth, that haue done good, vnto the resurrection of life: but they that haue done euill, vnto the resurrection of condemnation. 
                     Iohn 5.8.29.
               
               Search the Scriptures, for in them yee thinke to haue eternal life. 
                     Ioh. 5.39
               
               If thou knewest the gift of God, (Christ ment himselfe,

who was sent of his Father, to conuert the woman of Samaria,) and who is he that saith vnto thee, Giue mee drinke, thou wouldest haue asked of him, and he would haue giuen thee Water of life. (which is the loue of God in his Sonne, powred into our heartes by the holy Ghost, vnto euerlasting life.) Iohn. 4.10.
               
               Whosoeuer drinketh of the water that I shall giue

him, (euen spirituall grace) shal neuer be more a thirst, (shall neuer be dried vp, destitute, or forsaken:) but the water that I shall giue him▪ shall be in him a well of water, springing vp into euerlasting life. Ioh. 4.14.
               
               Come ye blessed of my Father, (for our saluation commeth of the blessing and fauour of God,) inherite ye the kingdome prepared for you from the foundations of the world.

(Note the certantie of our predestination to saluation. Matth. 25.34.
               
               And these shall goe into euerlasting paine, (which followeth mens fantasies, neglecting the will of God, and his commandements,) and the righteous into life eternall. Math. 25.46.
               
               And many of them that sléepe in the dust of the earth, shall awake, (all shal rise at the generall resurrection,)

some to euerlasting life, &amp; some to shame and perpetuall contempt. Dan. 12.2.
               
               And they shal come foorth that haue done good vnto the resurrection of life: but they that haue done euill, vnto the resurrection of condemnation. Iohn. 5.29.
               
               For the Lambe,) Iesus Christ our Mediatour and Redeemer, (Which is in the midest of the throne, (being very God,) shall

            The ten Commaundements of Almighty God, called: The two Tables of the Law.
            
               The first Table. 1. J am the Lord thy God, thou shalt haue none other Gods but mee.
               HEare, O Israel. The LORD our God, is the onely Lord: Thou shalt

therefore loue the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy minde, (or thought,) and with all thy strength. Marke. 12.29.30
               
               Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, &amp; him onely shalt thou serue. Math. 4.10. Luk, 4.14.
               
               I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt haue none other Gods before my face (God bindeth vs to serue him lonely, without superstition,

or idolatry.) Deu. 5.6.7.
               
               I am the Lord your God, ye shall keepe my Sabbathes, and reuerence my Sanctuarie: I am the Lord. Leuit. 26.1.2.
               
               Come, let vs worship, and fall downe before the Lord our maker (We must wholly giue our selues to the seruice of GOD.) Psa. 95.6.
               
               All the Gods of the people, are Idols: but the Lord made the Heauens.

                  (Idols therefore, or whatsoeuer made not the Heauens, are not God.) Psal. 96.6,
               
            
            
               
                  2. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Jmage, nor the liknesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue, nor in the earth beneath nor in the water vnder the earth; thou shalt not bow downe to them, nor worship them: For J the Lord thy God, am a ielous God, and visite the sinne of

the fathers vpon the children, vnto the third and fourth generation, of them that hate me; and shew mercy vnto thousands, in them that loue me, &amp; keepe my commaundements.
               NO man hath séene God at any time, the onely begotten Sonne of God, which is in the bosome of the Father, (hee is most deare and straitly ioyned to his Father, not onely in

loue, but also in nature and vnion.) hee hath deliuered him. (God was made visible, as it were, in Christ.) Iohn. 1.18.
               
               God is a Spirit, and they that worshipe him, must worship him in spirit and truth,) God being of a spirituall nature, requireth aspirituall seruice, and agreeable to his nature. Ioh. 4.24.
               
               For somuch then, as we are the generation of God

we ought not to thinke, that the Godhead is like vnto Gold, or Siluer, or Stone, grauen by art, and the inuention of man. Act. 17.29.
               
               The worshipping of Idoles, which ought not to be named, in the beginning, and the cause, and the end of all euill. Sapi. 14 26
               
               The inuenting of Idols, was ye beginning of whoredome: and the finding of them, is the corruption of

life. Sapien. 14.12.
               
               Better therefore is the iust man, that hath none Idols: for he shall be farre from reproofe. Baruc. 6.72
               
               Confounded be all they that serue grauen Images, &amp; that glory in Idols: worship him all ye Gods. (Let all that is of estimation in the world, fall downe before the Lord.) Psal. 97.7,
               
               Thou shalt make thée no gods of Mettal. Exo. 34.17
               
               
                  Babes, keepe your selues from Idols. (From euery forme and fashion of thing, which is set vp for any deuotion to worship God.) 1. Iohn. 5.29.
               
            
            
               
                  3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine: for the Lord will not hold him guilt lesse, that taketh his name in vaine.
               YEe haue heard how it was said to them of old time. Thou shalt not forsweare

thy selfe, but shalt performe thine othes to the Lord. But I say vnto you, Sweare not at all, neither by heauen, (all superfluous oathes are deba
                        •
                     red,) for it is the Throne of God: nor yet by the Earth, for it is his Footstoole: neither by Hierusalem, for it is the Citie of the great King. Neither shalt thou sweare by thine head, because thou canst not make one Haire white or blacke: But let

your communication be, Yea yea: Nay, nay: (let simplicitie and truth, be in your wordes; and then ye shall not be so light, &amp; ready to sweare:) For whatsoeuer is more then these, commeth of euill. (when one speaketh otherwise, then he thinketh in heart, it commeth of an euill conscience, and of the Diuell. (Matth. 5.33.34.35.36.37.
               
               This is the curse that

goeth foorth ouer all the whole earth. &amp;c. And euery one that sweareth, (he that transgresseth the first Table, and serueth not God aright, but abuseth Gods name) shall be cut off, as wel on this side, as on that: I will bring it foorth, saith the Lord of Hoasts, and it shal enter, &amp;c. into the house of him yt falsely sweareth by my name; and it shal remaine in the middest of his house, and shall consume it,

with the timber thereof, &amp; stones thereof, Zach. 4.3.4.
               
               Accustome not thy selfe to swearing, (for in it there are many falles:) neither take vp for a custome, the naming of the holy one (for, thou shalt not be vnpunished for such things.) For, as a seruant which is oft punished, cannot be without some scarre: so he that sweareth, and nameth God continually, shall not be faultlesse, &amp;c. (Read the

Chapter, it is notable.) Eccles. 23.9.10.11.
               
            
            
               
                  4 Remember that thou keepe holy the Sabbath day Sixe dayes shalt thou labour and doe all that thou hast to doe but the seuenth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it, thou shalt do no manner of worke, thou, and thy sonne, and thy daughter, the man-seruant, &amp; thy mayd-seruant thy cattell, and the stranger that is within thy gates. For

in sixe dayes, the Lord made Heauen, and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seuenth day: wherefore the Lord blessed the seuenth day and hallowed it.
               IT is lawfull to doe wel, (or doe a good deed,) on the Sbbath day Matth. 12 12.
               
               The Sabbath was made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath: wherefore the Sonne of man is Lord

euen of the Sabbath. Mar. 2.27.28.
               
               If thou turne away thy foote from the Sabbath, (If thou refraine thy selfe from thy wicked works,) from doing thy will on my Holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, to consecrat it, as glorious to the Lord and shalt honour him, not doing thine owne wayes nor séeking thine own wil, nor speaking a vaine word: then shalt thou delight in

the Lord, and I will cause thee to mount vpon the high places of the earth, (I will aduance thee, &amp; make thee honourable, (and féed thée with the heritage of Iacob thy Father, (and blesse thee with plentie of all things, to thy full contentation:) for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. Esai. 58.13.14.
               
               Keepe the Sabbath day to sanctifie it, as the Lord thy God hath commaunded.

                  Since God permitteth sixe dayes to our labours, we ought willingly to dedicate the seauenth, to serue him wholly. The keeping of the Sabbath, consisteth not in our selues, but it commeth from aboue, euen from God the authour of the Sabbath.) Deut. 5.12.
               
            
            
               
               The second Table 5. Honour thy Father, and thy Mother that thy dayes may be long in the lād, which the Lord thy God giueth thee
               HOnour thy Father, and Mother: (And) He that cursoth Father, or Mother let him die, (without any hope of pardon) Mat. 15 4. Mark 7.10.
               
               Honour thy Father, and Mother, (which is the first Commaundement, with

promise,) that it may be well, with thée, &amp; that thou mayst liue long on earth. (The Promise is conditionall, for if we neglect the dutie to vs enioyned, we make the Promise voyde, and of none effect, Ephes. 6.23.
               
               The Lord will haue the Father honoured of the Children, (for hee hath so commaunded,) and hath confirmed the authority of the Mother, ouer the Children,

Who so honoureth his Father, his sinnes shal be forgiuen him; and he shall abstaine from them, and shall haue his dayly desires, (God will be so gracious vnto him, and so guide him, that he shall not doe amisse:) And he that honoureth his Mother, is like one that gathereth treasure. Eccle. 3.2.34
               
            
            
               
               
                  6. Thou shalt doe no murder.
               YEe haue heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; for whosoeuer killeth, shall be culpaple of Iudgment, (or subiect to punishmēt:) but I say vnto you. Whosoeuer is angry with his brother vnaduisedly, shall be culpable of Iudgement, (for God knowing his secreat malice, will punish him.) And whosoeuer

saith vnto his brother, Raca, (Idle braine, a biword spoken in contempt, and despight,) shall be worthy to by punished by the Coū
                  cell, (by Iudges thereto appoynted.) And whosoeuer shall say, Foole, shall be worthy to be punished with hell fire, Matth. 5 21.22.
               
               Loue your enemies, blesse them that curse you, doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which hurt you, and persecute

you: and vnto him that smiteth thee on the one cheeke, offer also the other, (Rather endure more iniurie, then reuenge your selues.) Luk. 7.27.28.29.
               
            
            
               
                  7. Thou shalt not commit Adulterie
               YEe haue heard that it was sayd to them of old time, Thou shalt not commit Adulterie: But I say vnto you, that whosoeuer looketh on a Woman, to

lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. (Chastitie is required both in bodie and minde.) Math. 5.27.28.
               
               Flee Fornication. Euery sinne that a man doth, is without the body: but he that committeth Fornication sinneth against his owne body. (He more polluteth &amp; defileth his owne body, then he that committeth any other sinne.)

1. Cor. 6.18.
               
               Know ye not, that your bodyes are the members of Christ: shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an Harlot: God forbid. 1. Cor. 6.15.
               
               Mariage is honourable, (and a remedie ordeined of God, against incontinencie,) among all, and the bed vndefiled but: Whoremongers and Adulterers, God will iudge. Heb. 13.4
               
            
            
               
               
                  8. Thou shalt not Steale.
               THou knowest the Commaundements: Thou shalt not steale Mat. 10.19
               Why rather suffer yée not wrong: Nay, ye your selues doe wrong, and that to your bretheren: (hatred grudges, wrongfull dealings, and desires of reuenge, &amp;c. are forbidden.) Know ye not, that the vnrighteous shal not inherite the kingdome of God: Be

not deceiued; neither adulrerers nor théeues, &amp;c. shall inherite the kingdome of God: and such were some of you &amp;c. 1. Cor. 6 7 8.9.10
               Let him that stoale, steale no more; but let him rather labour, and worke with his handes, the thing which is good that he may haue to giue vnto him that néedeth Ephes. 4 28.
            
            
               
               
                  9. Thou shalt not beare false witnesse against thy neighbour.
               THese sixe things doth the Lord hate: yea, his soule abhorreth seauen. 1. The hauty Eyes: 2. a lying Tongue: 3. Handes that shed innocent blood: 4 an Heart that imagineth wicked enterprises: 5. féete that be swift in running to mischiefe, (that is, affections

which carry a man away in such sort, that hee can not tell what he doth.) 6. a False witnesse: 7. him that rayseth vp Contentions among brethren, (or neighbours.) Prou. 6.16.17
               
               Wherefore, cast off lying, and speake euery man truth vnto his neighbour; for we are members one of another Ephes. 4.25.
               
               A wicked witnesse mocketh at iudgement, and the mouth of the wicked, swalloweth

vp iniquitie. (Taketh a pleasure, and delighteth therein. as gluttons and drunkards, in dilicate meates and drinkes) Pro. 19.28.
               
               A false witnesse shall not be vnpunished: and he that speaketh lyes, shall perish. Prou. 19.9.
               
            
            
               
                  10. Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours house, thou shalt not couet thy neighbours wife nor his seruant, nor his mayd,

nor his oxe, nor his asse, nor any thing, that is his.
               WHatsoeuer ye would that men should doe to you, euen so doe to them: for this is the lawe and the Prophets. (The whole Law and the Scriptures, set foorth and commend charitie vnto vs.) Matth. 6.12 Luke. 6.31. Tob 4.15
               
               To loue a mans neighbour as himselfe, is more than all burnt offeringes

and sacrifices. (Than all the ceremonies of the Lawe, wherein Hipocrites put great holinesse.) Mark. 12.31.33.
               
               Let your conuersation be without couetousnesse, &amp; be content with those thinges that ye haue Heb. 13 5. Godlinesse is great gaine, if a man be content with that he hath. (Religion is the true riches (1. Tim. 6.6
               
               A foolish mans foote is soone in his neighbours

house: but a man of experience is ashamed to looke in. Eccles. 21.22.
               
               Follow not thy lusts, but turne thee from thine owne appetites: for if thou giuest thy soule her desires it shall make thine enimies that enuie thee, to laugh thee to scorne. Eccle. 18.30
               
               Let not sinne therefore reigne in your mortall body, that ye should obey it in the lustes thereof. (The mind first ministreth euill

motions, wherby mans will is enticed: thence burst foorth the lustes, by them the body is prouoked, and the body by his actions doth sollicite the minde, therfore we are commanded, at the least to rule our bodies.) Rom. 6.12.
               
               Sit not at al with another mans wife, neither ly with her vpon the bed, nor banquet with her, least thine heart incline vnto her, and so through thy desire, fall

into destruccion. Eccl. 9 11.
               
               Giue me thy vineyard, that I may make me a garden of hearbes thereof, &amp;c. (Achabs inordinate lust, after Naboths inheritance, sharpely punished.) 1. Kin. 21.2.4.6 &amp;c.
                  
               
               If mine heart hath been deceiued by a woman, (to lust after her,) or, if I haue laid waite at the doore of my neighbour, let my wife grinde vnto another man and let other men bowe

downe vpon her. To abuse her. Iob. 31.9.10

                  Gods blessing doth bring.

               Euen so it fares,
               with euerie one,
               whose sinnes to such,

               Ten thousand thousand
               sore complaintes.
               And with sharpe torments,
               them attaines.
               Thus doth their conscience
               them arraine,
               And to confesse,
               doth them constraine,
               
                  All such misdeedes,
               as they haue done:
               So that into
               Gods curse they runne:
               Which threatens death
               and hell to such,

               An euill conscience,
               this hath wrought:
               A conscience voyd
               of Gods good grace:

                  This is the worme.
               which euer gnawes
               The corsiue salue,

               This is the fire

                  t King and King,
               (Although this be
               a precious thing:)
               For where in peace,
               Kings weare the Crowne
               There all dissention
               is cast downe:
               There people liue
               in hearty loue
               There is no cause,
               to fend and proue,
               Their high estates
               such dutie haue,
               As their degrees
               and callings craue:
               
                  Th'inferiour knowes,

               There is no grudge,
               there is no strife.
               Where people passe
               in peace their life.
               The seedes which we
               in soyle doe sow.
               Spring vp, and spread,
               increase and grow.
               Vnto our charge,
               we haue an eye,
               Our labours doe
               our lackes supply.
               
                  We worship God.
               His name we feare,
               And to our Prince
               true heartes we beare.
               Among our selues
               in loue we liue
               These are the fruits,
               which peace doth giue
               But yet the peace
               which doth surmount
               All precious thinges
               that we can count,
               It is not peace,
               twixt man and man:
               Which no long time▪
               
               continue can:
               It is that peace,
               which bringeth blisse:
               Their precious peace,
               perpetuall is.
               
                  The authour of
               This peace, is God:
               Who for our sinnes,
               with vs was od,
               For as we know,
               through Adams fall,
               To God his wrath,
               We were in thrall:
               So that hereby
               this gaine we got,
               Euen death for life,
               (ah hellish lot:)
               Our owne misdeedes
               deserueth death:
               And God, who giueth
               life and breath,
               Suppressing peace,
               became our foe:
               And from the heauens
               aloft, did throw
               
                  His thunderbolts
               of fearefull threates,
               And in his heate,
               his sword he wheats:
               Even warriour like,
               to strike vs downe,
               (For man doth melt
               when God doth frowne.)
               Thus with the Lord,
               we were at ods,
               Ours was the smart
               the vengeance Gods:
               Which whiles it did
               endure and last,
               All hope of peace.
               was gone and past:
               Till he from heauen
               beholding vs,
               With wrethednesse
               inclosed thus:
               
                  Prouided in
               this heauy case,
               T'amend our state,
               by his good grace:
               This he vouchaft
               to bring to passe:
               (A wonderous work
               of his it was:)
               From mercie seate,
               he sent his Sonne,
               At whose corruption.
               peace begunn.
               God did ordaine,
               that Christ should die,
               Vpon a Crosse
               reard vp on hie:
               By losse of life,
               to purchase peace.
               True Christian comfort,
               to increase:
               
                  Among the Iewes
               betrayd, he fell:
               One of the twelue,
               presumd to sell.
               For thirtie pence,
               his Maisters life:
               The losse whereof,
               abolisht strife.
               The Iewes did lay
               on him their hands,
               His limbs and ioynts
               they bound with hands:
               They scoft and mockt
               him too too bad:
               Their wish and will
               on him they laid:
               Vpon the Crosse
               he made his end,
               His soule to God
               he did commend.
               
                  This sacrifice
               God highly pleasd,
               And this his rigorous
               rage apeasd.
               Heere reconcilement
               first began,

               most perfect peace.

               our enimies old

               to doe thee harme,
               God is thy helpe,

               This is the Locke.
               which thou and I,
               And euery one,

               Which Locke if we,

               Of all therefore,
               this is the summe,
               If to this Conduit
               we will comme:
               And thence fetch comfort
               at our need.
               (This is) if we
               to pray proceed:
               
                  And aske of God,
               the things we want,
               Beseeching him
               the same to graunt:
               For Iesus sake,
               his onely Sonne.
               By loue this worke
               must be begonne.
               Which if we haue,
               then sure we may
               Before the Lord,
               approch and pray:
               For otherwise,
               all that we doe,
               Is sinne and death
               belonges thereto.
               This locke of loue.
