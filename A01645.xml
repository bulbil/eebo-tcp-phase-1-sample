            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE the Reverend Father in God JOHN Lord Bishop of ROCHESTER.
                  
                     IT was the answer of Vespasian to Apollonius desiring entrance and accesse for Dion and Euphrates two Philosophers: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . My gates are alwayes open to Philosophers: but my very breast is open unto thee. What Vespasian professed in word to Apollonius, the late Reverend Dean of SALISBURY hath performed indeed to me: The gates of his liberalitie and hospitalitie

have never been barred against scholars and strangers: but the inward temple of his divine breast was unlocked unto me, and through that I saw his heart flaming with affection towards me. The experience of that his divine Philanthropie moved me formerly to desire entertainment for a stranger, not doubting of his wonted Philoxenie, not for Dion or Euphrates the Philosophers, but for Gerard the Divine, having then new put on an English mans habit. I obtained my desire. At SALISBURIE he was welcome. In citie and countrey afterwards he found good entertainment. After three yeares he came again to Cambridge. I furnished him with ink and paper. Then he resolved to take another progresse. On

New-yeares day I left him on his way to Rochester. He promised not to divert to any place till he had seen your Lordship, and presented my most humble service. Happy Gerard, that may see your Lordship. O that I might but see once again those heavenly eyes whose first aspect and influence blessed me! O that I might but kisse those saving hands which raised me! O that I might but visit that temple, and worship that divine breast, where my soul found sanctuary! If Gerard may, in part I shall. That which I cannot see with mine eyes, my dayly thoughts shall present unto me: Him whom I cannot reverence with cap and knee, I will alwayes honour in heart and minde: whither with the feet of my bodie

I cannot walk, I will travel with all dutifull affection. But what shall I do to expresse my thankfulnesse? He that hath scap'd shipwrack will hang up his sails to Neptune for a monument: I have none other sails but such as are made of thin paper, and those scarce yet drie. He that hath passed through the pikes, and is come off safe and sound, will offer a 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      unto Salus: I have no other 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      but my self: and that is but a poore scholars service. He that is recovered of a dangerous sicknesse, will do his devotions at Aesculapius his temple: My prayers shall alwayes be directed to Almighty God, who hath the hearts of all men in his hands, who opened the good Dean of SALISBURIES heart unto me: Unto him shall my prayers

early and late be directed, to open unto the Bishop of ROCHESTER the treasury of all blessings temporall and eternall: And I hope the Reverend Father in God will accept this tribute of a devout soul. Servatus hath nothing else to give: But he shall alwayes remain
                  
                     
                        Your Lordships most humbly devoted servant R. Winterton.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                  To the ancient, religious, and learned Lady, the Lady COPPEN.
                  
                     THe earth is watered with drops from above, and in vapours sends them up again: The rivers come from the sea, and flow back again: The aire will cleave the rock to get up to its place again: The fire came down from heaven, and thither it tends up again. From the mixture of these elements, all bodies have their temperaments: Those have in them a character of naturall gratitude, and these should follow them. This character an illiterate man may see in creatures without sense; and he that is learned may reade to the life in creatures that have sense. Man is the Epitome of all perfections in other creatures: But without this character he is like to

none of them. He hath spent his time ill at the Vniversitie that denies the first principles, and he would be sent back again to learn the first elements. In the soul of man, as Galen saith, there is an art of arts, and in the bodie of man an instrument of instruments: Reason is the art, and the hand is the instrument: I have both, and both are the Lady COPPENS. I have reason to acknowledge it, and an hand to subscribe to it.
                  
                     
                        Your Ladiships servant Ra
                           ••
                        h Winterton.
                  
               
               
                  
                  To the Right Worshipfull my most munificent friend and benefactour, Sr JOHN HANBURIE Lord of Kelmash in Northamptonshire.
                  
                     A Generous benefactour writes what he gives in running water; so doth Sr 
                     John Hanburie: A thankfull receiver writes what he receives in a pillar of marble; so would Ralph Winterton. The one professeth the art of forgetfulnesse; so do you: The other practiseth the art of remembrance; so will I. Six yeares are passed since the golden streams of your bountie flowed down upon me: But the water of Lethe hath not yet washed them out of my memorie. I hope I shall never be sick of a lethargie: But it is good to use a help for memorie. A benefit once received ought alwayes to be remembred: Mans alwayes is not alwayes: Come death, farewell memorie. Letters

after the death of them to whom they are sent, are usually burnt for waste papers. Therefore I durst neither trust the one nor the other with keeping the record of your bountie, and my thankfulnesse: knowing that death for certain will blot out memory, and fire may burn up the Registers office. It may be your bountie would have been well pleased with a private acknowledgement: But my dutie could not be satisfied without a publick monument. None more publick then that which hath passed through the presse: For that of one can make a thousand; so it did formerly. But now I have made fifteen hundred witnesses of my thankfull remembrance: and more may hereafter. Gerard where he is known is in favour every where: But he is no where without Sr JOHN HANBURIE,
                  
                     
                        At whose service GERARD is and his Translatour RALPH WINTERTON.
                  
               
               
                  
                  To the Worshipfull my very worthy friends, Mr 
                     Nathanael Henshaw of Valence in Essex, Mr 
                     Benjamin Henshaw of Cheap-side in London, and Mr 
                     Thomas Henshaw of Saffron-Walden in Essex.
                  
                     IT is reported by Tacitus, that Licinius grew so stupid, that if he had not been put in minde by others, he had forgot himself to be a Prince. If I should forget the HENSHAVVES, I should forget my self to be a man: For an unthankfull man is no man, but an enemie to God and man: so the Persians were wont to call him. Where bounty hath an hand to give, thankfulnesse should have an hand to write received. I have formerly recorded with mine own hand your names in the catalogue of my benefactours:

And that hand should deserve to be cut off, if it should now expunge them. The old copie may decay: I thought good therefore now to renew it. Gerards Meditations had never seen English light for me, if yours and others bountie had not set my head on work to finde out some occasion to give publick testimonie of my thankfulnesse: If Gerard had not been, I might still have been to seek for an occasion. As often therefore as Gerard and I live together, at every impression you may challenge at my hands a new expression of my service. This debt I shall be alwayes readie to pay, but not as men pay money: for that being once paid can be required no more: But this I shall be alwayes paying, and still remain your debter.

                     They more and more do fructifie.
                     
                        Gerard did bring forth fruit before,
                     But now it is deriv'd to more:
                     What be beyond the sea did sow,
                     Now Englishmen at home may mow.

                     To honour him whose service honours thee.
                     If thou beest hungrie, thirstie: Taste and see
                     Christs flesh and bloud presented unto thee.
                     If thou beest naked: To this wardrobe hie,
                     Where Christ his robe of righteousnesse doth lie.
                     If sick thou art: For every maladie
                     Here is a very present remedie.
                     If thou thy self defiled hast with sinne:
                     Here is a fountain for to bathe thee in.
                     If thou delightst in flowers: Here do grow
                     Such flowers as Art and Nature ne're could show.
                     Choose what thou wilt, here's what thou canst desire,

                     But now he hath his language altered:
                     Behold a change! see how Arts pencill can
                     A Latine turn into an English-man.

                     He was to those that learned were,
                     To thee he was not though be were.
                     Before, thou couldst not understand,
                     He's now translated to thy hand.
                     Reade him, and use him as thy friend,
                     And hee'l be thine unto the end.

                     THou that desir'st on earth a blessed end,
                     And seek'st the way to th'heavens to ascend,
                     Resort to Gerard: hee'l direct the way
                     Whereby thou mayst ascend and live for ay.
                     Thou needst no guide, 'tis easie to be gone,
                     All lets removed are by Winterton.
                     
                     The way's made plain, which was before obscure,
                     That thou thereby mayst heavenly blisse procure.
                     Endeavour then this way to walk aright:
                     And it will lead thee to eternall light.

                     in the day of judgement. I examine my life, and behold, it is altogether vain or profane. Vain and unprofitable are many of my actions, my speeches much more, and my thoughts most of all. Neither is my life vain onely, but profane also, and ungodly: I finde in

it nothing that is good: for though something in it may seem good, yet it is not truely good and perfect, because the contagion of originall sinne and my corrupt nature hath polluted it.Job 9.28. Holy Job said, I was afraid in regard of all my works. If the holy man so complain, what shall the ungodly do?Isa. 64.6. 
                     All our righteousnesse is as the cloth of a menstruous woman. If our righteousnesse be such, what then shall our unrighteousnesse be? If you shall do all things (saith our Saviour) which are commanded you,

If I owe my self unto thee, and all that I can, yea though I should not sinne: what shall I be able to give unto thee, holy God, to redeem me from sinne?Gregory in his moralls. Our seeming righteousnesse, if it be compared with the divine righteousnesse, is meere unrighteousnesse. A little light may shine in the darknesse: but being set in the light of the sunne, is darkened. The wood not brought to the rule may appeare

                     escence, where it is crooked. The image of the seal may appeare perfect in the eyes of the beholders, and yet it may be much imperfect in the eye of the artificer: Even so, that which glittereth in the estimation of the worker, is oftentimes base and sordid in the discretion of him that judgeth:Isa. 55.8. For the judgements of God are of one kinde, and the judgements of men are of another. The memorie of many sinnes doth affright me: and yet there are many more that I do not know of.Psal. 19.12. 
                     Who knows how oft he offendeth? cleanse me, O Lord, from my secret faults. I dare not lift up mine eyes unto heaven, because I have offended him which dwelleth in the heavens. In earth I finde no refuge: for what favour can I expect of the creatures, when I have offended the Lord of the creatures?Austine. My adversary the devil accuseth me, and saith unto God, Thou most just Judge, judge him to be mine for his sinne, that would not be thine by grace. He is thine by nature, but he is

mine by delighting in his sinnes. He is thine by thy passion, but he is mine by perswasion. He is disobedient unto thee, and obedient unto me. He received of thee the robe of immortalitie, and innocencie: He hath received from me the raggs of unrighteousnesse. He hath cast off thy cloth, and put on mine. Adjudge him therefore to be mine, and to be damned with me. All the elements accuse me: The heaven saith, I have given thee light for thy comfort.Hugo. The aire saith, I have given thee all manner of fowls to be at thy command. The water saith, I have given thee divers kindes of fishes for thy meat. The earth saith, I have given thee bread and wine for thy nourishment. And yet thou hast abused all these to the contempt and dishonour of our creatour: Therefore let all our benefits be turned to thy punishments. The fire saith, Let me burn him. The water saith, Let me drown him. The aire saith, Let me fanne and winnow him. The earth saith, Let me swallow him up. And hell saith, Let me devoure him.Heb. 1▪ 14 
                     The holy Angels,

which were appointed by God to minister unto me in this life, and to be my consorts in the life to come, they accuse me: And by my sinnes I have deprived my self of their ministery in this life, and hope of their fellowship in the life to come. The voice of God, that is, his divine law accuseth me: either I must fulfill it, or perish. To fulfill it, it is impossible: To perish everlastingly, it is intolerable. God the most severe judge, and most powerfull executour of his eternall law, accuseth me: Him I cannot deceive, for he is wisdome it self: From him I cannot fly, for he is power it self reigning every where.Psal. 139.7. Austine upon the 32 Psalme 
                     Whither then shall I flie? To thee O Christ my alone Redeemer and Saviour. My sinnes are great indeed: but thy satisfaction is greater. My unrighteousnesse is great, but thy righteousnesse is greater. I acknowledge: forgive thou. I set open: shut thou. I uncover: cover thou. In me there is nothing, but that which will condemne me: In thee there is nothing, but that which will save me. I have committed many things, for which most deservedly

I might be condemned: Thou hast omitted nothing, whereby I might be saved. I heare a voice in the canticles, which bids me hide my self in the clefts of the rock.
                     Cant. 2.14. Thou art that rock, thy wounds are those clefts of the rock: In them will I hide my self against the accusations of all the creatures. My sinnes crie aloud, even unto heaven:Heb. 12.24. but thy bloud, which was poured forth for my sinnes, cries louder. My sinnes are strong to accuse me before God: but thy passion is of more force to defend me: The unrighteousnesse of my life is powerfull to condemne me: but thy most perfect righteousnesse is more powerfull to save me. I appeal therefore from the throne of thy justice to the throne of thy mercie: Neither dare I appeare in judgement, unlesse thou interpose thy most holy merits betwixt me and thy judgement.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Meditat. II. An exercise of repentance from the crosse of Christ.
                  
                     Thy Saviour on the crosse did choose,
                     To save thy life, his own to lose.
                  
                  BEhold thou faithfull soul the grief of him that suffered,Bernard. the wounds of him that hanged, the torments of him that died on the crosse. That head, at which the angels tremble, is crowned with thorns. That face, which was most beautifull above the sonnes of men, is defiled by the spittings of the ungodly. Those eyes, which were more bright then the sunne, are darkened in death. Those eares, which were wont to heare angelicall praises, do ring now with the proud speeches, and the derision of sinners. That mouth, out of which did proceed most divine oracles; that mouth, which taught the angels, hath no other drink but gall and vineger. Those feet, which are to be adored, are fastned with nails. Those hands,John 19▪
                      which stretched forth

the heavens, are stretched forth on the crosse, and nailed. That body, which was the most sacred temple of the deitie, is whipped, and wounded with the speare: neither remains there any part in him save onely a tongue, and that, to pray for them that crucified him. He that reigneth with the Father in the heavens, is by sinners grievously afflicted on the crosse: God dies upon the crosse: God suffers: God poureth forth his bloud. Judge the greatnesse of the danger by the greatnesse of the prize. Judge the danger of the disease by the value of the remedie. Surely those wounds were great indeed, which could no otherwise be cured, but by the wounds of the living and quickening flesh. Surely that disease must needs be great, which could not be cured but by the death of the physician.
                  Consider, thou faithfull soul, Gods most fierce anger against us. After the fall of our first father, the eternall, onely begotten, and well beloved sonne of God becomes suter unto his Father for us: And yet his anger

was not turned away from us. He by whom the world was made, interceded for us,1. John 2.2. became our advocate, and took the cause of us miserable sinners upon himself: And yet his anger was not turned away from us. Our Saviour took upon him our flesh, that by the glorie of the divinitie, communicated unto the humanitie, he might expiate and purge our sinfull flesh: that by the saving vertue of his most perfect righteousnesse communicated unto our nature, he might wipe away that venemous qualitie of sinne which cleaveth to our nature, and in stead thereof conferre grace upon us: And yet his anger was not turned away from us. Our sinnes and the punishment of our sins he taketh upon himself. His body is bound, whipped, wounded, pierced, crucified, buried. His bloud, like a dew, distilled most copiously down all his members at his passion. His most holy soul is made sorrowfull above measure, yea even unto death.
                     Matt. 26.38. He feels the pains of hell. The eternall Sonne of God crieth out that he is forsaken of God.Matt. 27.46. So great was his

bloudie sweat, so great was his anguish, that he which comforteth the angels, stood in need of an angel to comfort him.Luke 22.43. He dies who is the authour and giver of life to every living thing.Luke 23.31.

                           •
                        se in the green tree, what shall become of the dry wood? If this comes to passe in the just and holy, what shall become of sinners? How shall God punish us for our own sinnes, who is so wrathfully displeased with his own sonne for other mens sinnes? If his sonne is so grievously punished, shall we his servants think to escape alwayes unpunished? What shall the reprobate suffer, if such be the sufferings of his best beloved? If Christ departed not without a scourge, and yet came into the world without sinne, what scourges do they deserve which come into the world in sin, live in sin, and depart in sinne? The servant rejoyceth, whilest the sonne is in grievous dolour and pain; and that, for his sinne. The servant heapeth up the anger of God, whilest the sonne doth thus labour to pacifie and appease his Fathers wrath. Oh the infinite anger

of God! oh his unspeakable furie! oh the inestimable rigour of his justice! He which is thus enraged against his onely and best beloved sonne, the partaker of his own essence; and that, not for any sinne of his own, but because he intercedeth for the servant: what will he do to the servant that persevereth and continueth still securely in his sinnes? Let the servant fear and tremble, and be sorrowfull for his own merits, when the sonne is thus punished, and yet not for his own. Let the servant fear, who ceaseth not to sinne, when the sonne of God is thus afflicted for sinne. Let the creature fear, which hath crucified his Creatour. Let the servant fear, which hath slain his Lord. Let the sinner and the ungodly fear, which hath thus tormented the pious and the godly. Beloved, let us heare his cries, let us behold his teares: he cries from the crosse. Behold O man what I suffer for thee:Bernard i

Have mercy, have mercy on us, thou whose propertie it is to have mercy, and convert our stony hearts unto thee.
               
               
                  
                     Meditat. III. Of the fruit of true and serious repentance.
                  
                     Our Saviour cry'd, Repent, repent,
                     As John that 'fore our Saviour went.
                  
                  THe foundation and beginning of holy life is saving repentance. For where there is true repentance, there is remission of sinnes: And where there is remission of sinnes, there is the grace of God: And where there is the grace of God, there is Christ: And where Christ is, there is his merit: And where there is Christs merit, there is satisfaction for sinnes: And where there is satisfaction for sinnes, there is righteousnes: And where there is righteousnesse,

there is joy and tranquillitie of conscience: And where there is tranquillitie of conscience, there is the holy Spirit: And where the holy Spirit is, there is the sacred and holy Trinitie: And where the holy Trinitie is, there is eternall life: Therefore where there is true repentance, there is eternall life. Where there is not true repentance, neither is there remission of sinnes, nor the grace of God, nor Christ, nor his merit, nor satisfaction for sinnes, nor righteousnesse, nor tranquillitie of conscience, nor the holy Spirit, nor the holy Trinitie, nor eternall life.
                  Why therefore do we deferre our repentance? and why do we procrastinate it from day to day? To morrow is not ours, and to repent truely is not in our power: And in the day of judgement we must give an account not onely for to morrow, but also for the present day. To morrow is not so certain, as the destruction of the impenitent is certain. God hath promised remission to the repentant:Austine▪
                      but he hath not promised to morrow. There is no place for

Christ his satisfaction, where there is not true contrition in the heart.Isa. 59.2. 
                     Our sinnes do separate betwixt God and us, so saith the Prophet Esay. And by repentance we return again unto him. Acknowledge and bewail thy sinnes: so shalt thou finde God in Christ appeased towards thee. I blot out thine iniquities,
                     Isa. 43.25 saith the Lord: Therefore our sinnes are enrolled in the court of heaven.Psal. 51.9. 
                     Turn away thy face from my sinnes, begs the Prophet: Therefore our iniquities are set in the sight of God. Be converted unto us O God, prayeth Moses: Therefore our sinnes do separate us from God.
                     Isa. 59.2. Vers. 12. 
                     Our sinnes have answered us, complaineth Esay: Therefore they accuse us before Gods judgement-seat.Psal. 51.2. 
                     Cleanse me from my sinnes, prayeth David: Therefore our sinnes appeare most foul and filthie in the sight of God.Psal. 41.4. 
                     Cure my soul, for I have sinned against thee, prayeth the same David: Therefore sinne is the disease of the soul. Whosoever shall sinne against me, I will blot him out of my book,
                     Exod. 32.32. saith the Lord: Therefore for our sinnes are we blotted out of

the book of life.Psal. 51.11. 
                     Cast me not away from thy face, prayeth the Psalmist: Therefore for our sinnes God casts us off. Take not thy holy Spirit from me: Therefore as bees are driven away with smoak,Basil upon the 33 Psal. and pigeons with ill savours: so by our sinnes is the holy Spirit driven out of the temples of our hearts. Restore me the joy of thy salvation:
                     Psal. 52.12. Therefore sinne doth torment the minde, and dry up the moisture of the heart. The earth is defiled by the inhabitants thereof,
                     Isa. 24.5. 
                     which have transgressed the law, crieth Esay: Therefore sinne is a contagious and infectious poison. Out of the deeps have I cryed unto thee O Lord, saith the Psalmist:Psal. 130.1. Therefore our sinnes presse us down unto hell. We were sometimes dead in our sinnes, saith the apostle:Ephes. 2.1. Therefore sinne is the spirituall death of the soul. By mortall sinne man loseth God: God is the infinite and incomprehensible good: Therefore to lose God is an infinite and incomprehensible evil. As God is the chiefest good, so sinne is the chiefest evil. Punishments and calamities are not

absolutely evil: for many times there comes good of them. Yea rather it appeares that they are good, because they come from God who is the chiefest good; from whom can proceed nothing but that which is good. They were in the chiefest good, to wit, in Christ: And the chiefest good cannot partake in that which is evil truely so called. And moreover they leade us unto the chiefest good,Luke 24.26. that is, to life everlasting. Christ by his passion entred into his glorie: And so do Christians by tribulations enter into eternall life:
                     Acts 14.22. Therefore sinne is the chiefest evil, because it withdraws us from the chiefest good. The nearer thou comest unto God, the further thou departest from sinne: The nearer thou comest unto sinne, the further thou departest from God. How saving therefore is repentance, which withdraws us from sinne, and brings us back again unto God! Sinne is measured by the greatnesse of him that is offended: But him the heavens &amp; the earth cannot contain: In like manner such is our repentance as he unto

whom we return by repentance. The sinner is accused by his conscience, which he hath defiled; by the Creatour, whom he hath offended; by the sinnes, which he hath committed; by the creatures, which he hath abused; and by the devil, by whom he hath been seduced. How saving then is repentance, which frees us from such accusations! Let us make haste therefore, let us make haste to such a saving medicine for such a grievous disease. If thou repentest at thy death,Aust. of repentance. thou dost not leave thy sinnes, but thy sinnes leave thee. Thou shalt scarce finde any one that repented truely at his death, unlesse it were the thief upon the crosse. Fourteen yeares have I served thee,
                     Gen. 31.41. said Jacob to Laban, it is time now that I should provide for mine own house: And if thou hast served the world and this life so many yeares, is it not fit that thou shouldest begin now to make provision for thy soul? Every day doth our flesh heap sinne upon sinne: Let the Spirit therefore every day wash them away by repentance. Christ died that sinne might die in us: And

shall we suffer that to live and reigne in our hearts, for the destroying whereof the sonne of God himself died?Bernard. Christ enters not into the heart of man by grace, unlesse John Baptist prepare the way by repentance. God poureth not the oyl of mercie, but into the vessel of a contrite heart. God doth first mortifie us by contrition,1 Sam. 2.6 that afterwards he may quicken us by the consolation of the Spirit. He first leads us into hell by serious grief, that afterwards he may bring us back again by the taste of grace.1 King. 19 11. Elias first heard a great and strong winde, overturning mountains, and cleaving rocks; and after the winde an earthquake; and after the earthquake there appeared fire. At length there followed a small and still voice.Vers. 12. In like manner terrour goes before the taste of Gods love, and sorrow before comfort. God bindes not up thy wounds, unlesse thou lay them open by confession, and bewail them. He covers not, unlesse thou first uncover. He pardons not, unlesse thou first acknowledge. He justifies not, unlesse thou

first condemne thy self. He comforts not, unlesse thou first despair in thy self. This true repentance God by his holy Spirit work in us!

                     ke, do unto me according to thy name: &amp; seeing that thou art a true and a great Saviour, surely thou dost respect those that are sinners indeed, yea great sinners. Have mercie on me, O good Jesus, in the time of mercie, that I be not condemned in the time of judgement. If thou receive me into the bosome of thy mercy,Anselm. thou shalt have never the lesse room. If thou bestow upon me the crumbes of thy goodnesse, yet thou shalt want never the

more:Isa. 9.6. For me thou wast born, for me thou wast circumcised, to me also thou art become a Jesus: How sweet and delightfull is this name! For what is Jesus, but a Saviour? and what harm can happen to those that are saved? what else can we desire, or expect beyond salvation? Receive me, Lord Jesus, into the number of thy sonnes, that together with them I may land thy holy and saving name. Though I have lost my integritie: yet thou hast not forgotten thy mercy. Though I had power to lose and condemne my self: yet thou in thy mercie art more powerfull to save me. Lord do not thou so look upon my sinnes, as to forget thy mercy: do not so ponder and weigh my offences, that they overpoise thy merit: do not so remember my wickednesse, as therefore to forget thy goodnesse. Remember not thy anger against my guiltinesse: but remember thy mercie towards my miserie. Thou who hast given me a minde to desire thee, withdraw not thy self from my desire▪ Thou who hast shewed unto me my unworthinesse, and just damnation,

hide not from me thy merit, and the promise of everlasting salvation. My cause is to be tried at the heavenly tribunall: but this is my comfort, that in the court of heaven thou hast assigned unto thee the name of a Saviour: for that name was brought down from heaven by an angel. O most mercifull Jesus,Luke 2.21. to whom wilt thou be Jesus, if not to miserable sinners that seek thy grace and salvation? They that trust in their own righteousnesse and holinesse, seek salvation in themselves: but I flie unto thee my Saviour; for I finde nothing in my self worthy of eternall life: Save the condemned: shew mercie to the sinner: justifie the unrighteous: absolve the accused. Thou Lord art truth,John 14.6. thy name is holy and true. Let thy name also become true in respect of me, and become thou my Jesus and Saviour. Be thou unto me Jesus in this present life, be thou unto me Jesus in death, be thou unto me Jesus in the last judgement, be thou unto me Jesus in the life which is everlasting. I know thou wilt, sweet Jesus: for as thou art immutable in

thy ess
                        •
                     nce, so also thou art immutable in thy mercy. Thou wilt not change thy name, Lord Jesus, for my sake alone, who am a miserable sinner: Yea rather thou wilt become my Saviour; For thou dost not cast out him that cometh unto thee. Thou that hast given me a will to come unto thee, grant also unto me that coming I may be received: For thy words are truth and life. Let the propagation of originall sinne within me condemne me:John 14.6 yet thou art my Jesus. Let my conception in sinne condemne me: yet thou art my Jesus. Let my forming in sinne and under the curse condemne me: yet thou art my Saviour. Let the corruption of my nativitie condemne me: yet thou art my Saviour. Let the sinnes of my youth condemne me: yet thou art my Jesus. Let the course of my whole life, defiled with most grievous sinnes, condemne me: yet thou art still my Jesus. Let de
                        •
                     th the just punishment of my many and grievous sinnes and offences condemne me: yet thou art my Saviour. Let the severe sentence in the last

judgement condemne me: yet thou art my Jesus. In me is sinne, reprobation, damnation: In thy name is righteousnesse, election, salvation. I was baptized in thy name: I beleeve in thy name: In thy name will I die: In thy name will I rise again: In thy name will I appeare in judgement. In this name are all good things prepared for us, and shut up as it were a treasure: So much are they diminished, as my diffidence is increased: which that it may be farre from me, I beseech thee by this thy name, good Jesus, that for my sinne and unbelief I be not damned, whom by thy precious merit and saving name thou wouldst have saved.

                     The grace of Jesus Christ to me
                     Is th'onely true felicity.
                  
                  SEe Lord Jesus, how injurious I am to thy passion: My heart is vexed, and my soul is very sorrowfull;

because I have no good works of mine own; because I have no merits: when as thy passion is my action, thy works my merits. I am injurious to thy passion, when as I seek for the supplement of my works, whereas it is in it self all-sufficient. If I should finde righteousnesse in my self, thy righteousnesse would profit me nothing, or else I should not so much desire it. If I seek for the works of the law, by the law shall I be condemned: But I know that now I am no longer under the law, but under grace. I have lived wickedly, I have sinned,
                     Luke 15.2 
                     holy Father, against heaven and before thee, I am not worthy to be called thy sonne, yet thou wilt not refuse to call me thy servant. Deny me not, I pray thee, the fruit of thy passion: let not thy bloud wax barren, but let it bring forth fruit, and deliver my soul. My sinnes have alwayes lived in my flesh: but, I intreat thee, let them at length die with me. Hitherto the flesh hath alwayes ruled over me, but let the Spirit at length triumph: Let the outward

man be subject to corruption and worms, that the inward man may be glorified. Hitherto I have alwayes given way to the suggestions of the devil; but grant hereafter, I beseech thee,Rom. 16.20. that I may trample them under my feet. Satan is readie at hand to accuse me; but he hath nothing in me. The sight of death affrighteth me; but death is the end of my sinnes, and the beginning of an holy life. Now at length shall I be able perfectly to please thee, O my God: Now at length shall I be confirmed in goodnesse and vertue. Satan terrifieth me with my sinnes, but let him accuse him which took upon him my infirmities,Isa. 53.4▪
                      whom the Lord hath smitten for my sinnes: The debt which I ow is great indeed, and I cannot pay any part thereof: but my trust is in the riches and bounty of him that hath undertaken the payment. Let him discharge me, who hath made himself suretie for me: Let him pay for me, who took my debt upon himself. I have sinned, O Lord, and my sinnes are many and grievous: But this horrible sinne I

will not commit, to make thee a lyar, who by thy words, works, and oath dost testifie that satisfaction is made for my iniquities. I am not afraid by reason of my sinnes: for thou art my righteousnesse. I am not afraid by reason of my ignorance: for thou art my wisdome. I am not afraid of death: for thou art my life. I am not afraid of my errours: for thou art my truth. I am not afraid of corruption: for thou art my resurrection. I am not afraid of the sorrows of death: for thou art my joy. I am not afraid of the severitie of judgement:1. Cor. 1.30. for thou art my righteousnesse. Distill upon my withered soul the dew of thy grace and quickening consolation. My spirit waxeth dry: but it shall shortly rejoyce in thee. My flesh doth languish, and is withered: but it shall shortly bud forth. I am subject to corruption: but thou shalt deliver me from corruption: for thou hast delivered me from all evils. Thou hast created me: How then can the workmanship of thy hands be dissolved? Thou hast redeemed me from all mine enemies:

How then can death have rule over me? Thou hast bestowed thy body and bloud and all that thou hadst, yea even thy self for my salvation: How then shall death withhold them, which thou hast redeemed with so precious a ransome? Thou, Lord Jesus, art righteousnesse it self: So then my sins cannot prevail against thee. Thou art life it self, and the resurrection: So then my death cannot prevail against thee. Thou art God: Therefore Satan cannot prevail against thee.2. Cor. 1.22. Thou hast given me the earnest of thy Spirit: in that do I glorie, in that do I triumph, and am fully perswaded, without doubting, that I shall be admitted to the marriage of the Lambe. Most deare bridegroom,Rev. 19.7. thou art my wedding-garment, which I put on in baptisme: thou shalt cover my nakednesse,Gal. 3.25▪
                      neither will I sow the supplement of my righteousnesse to this most precious and beautifull garment. What is mans righteousnes, but the cloth of a menstruous woman?Isa. 64.6. How then can I dare to patch that most precious garment of Christs righteousnesse with

this abominable ragge? In this garment will I appear before thy face in judgement, when thou shalt judge the world in righteousnesse and equitie:Act. 17.31. In this garment will I appear before thy face in the kingdome of heaven: This garment shall cover my confusion and reproch, that no man remember it any more for ever: There shall I appear glorious and holy in thy sight: And this my flesh, this my body shall be arayed with beatificall glory, which glory shall be everlasting, and without end.Rev. 22.20. Come Lord Jesus, and whosoever loveth thee let him say, Come.

                      All the rest of the godly consists in the wounds of our

Saviour, our life in his death, our glory in his exaltation. How great is thy mercy, O heavenly Father and Almighty God! Of my self I could offend thee, but of my self I could not appease thee: Thou therefore in Christ dost reconcile me unto thee.
                  Behold therefore, holy God, the holy pledge of his flesh,
                        Anselm.
                      and forgive the guiltinesse of my flesh: Have respect unto what thy Sonne hath suffered for me, and forget what thy wicked servant hath done against thee: My flesh doth provoke thee to anger: Let the flesh of Christ I beseech thee, move thee to mercy. It is much that my wickednesse hath deserved: but it is much more that the holinesse of my redeemer hath merited. Great is my unrighteousnesse, but much more great is the righteousnes of my redeemer. For as much as God is higher then man, so much is my wickednesse lower then his goodnesse, both in qualitie and quantitie.

                     To will, I have from thee: Let me have from thee to do also. Holy God, just Judge! If my sinnes be concealed, they are uncurable: if they be seen, they are detestable: they do burn me with grief, and do much more terrifie me with fear. Do not withhold, I pray thee, thy true mercy where thou findest so true miserie. Great is the sinne which thou findest here, but let thy grace be greater and more plentifull. Holy Father, poure not I beseech thee thy wrath upon me, seeing that thou hast smitten thy Sonne for me.
                  O holy Jesus, deliver me from the wrath of God, thou that didst take it upon thy self for my sake upon the crosse. O holy Spirit, protect me by thy consolation against the wrath of God, thou that in the gospel hast declared mercie to the contrite and penitent. O holy God and just Judge, I finde no place to flie unto from the

presence of thy wrath: If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:
                     Psal. 139.8. 
                     If I descend into the deep, behold thou art there also:
                     9. 
                     If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the utmost parts of the sea,

                        nd lay hold on me: Unto Christ therefore will I flie, and hide my self in his wounds. O mercifull God, behold the body of thy Sonne wounded in every part, and look not upon the wounds of my sinnes. Let the bloud of thy Sonne wash me from all my spots. Heare his most ardent prayers offered unto thee for the salvation of the elect. O holy God and just Judge, my life affrights me:
                        Anselm.
                      for if it be exactly examined, it is either sinne, or barrennesse: And if there seem to be any fruit in it, it is either counterfeit, or imperfect, or some wayes corrupted; so that it cannot please thee, yea it must needs displease thee. Truly, all my life is either sinfull and damnable, or unfruitfull and contemptible. But why should I separate unfruitfull and damnable? Certainly, if it be unfruitfull, it is damnable: for every

tree that bringeth not forth good fruit,
                     Mat. 3.10. 
                     is hewen down and cast into the fire. Not onely the tree that bringeth forth ill fruit, is cast into the fire: but that also which bringeth forth no fruit. The goats affright me, for they were set on the left hand of the judge,Mat. 25.41. not because they did any evil, but because they did no good. To the hungry they gave no meat: To the thirsty they gave no drink. Therefore thou withered and unfruitfull tree, which hast deserved everlasting fire, what wilt thou answer in that day when thou shalt give account for all the time spent in this life even to the twinkling of an eye? An hair shall not perish from thy head, nor a moment from time. O the straits! On this side shall be thy sinnes accusing: On that side justice terrifying: Underneath thee the horrible pit of hell gaping: Above thee the angry judge condemning: Within thee thy conscience burning: Without thee the world flaming.Pet. 4.18 
                     The just man shall scarce be saved: Whither then shall the sinner thus taken unawares betake

himself? To lie hid, it is impossible: To appear it is intolerable.
                  From whence then shall I seek for the salvation of my soul?
                        Bernard.
                      from whom shall I seek counsel? Who is he that is called the Angel of great counsel? It is Jesus: He is the judge between whose hands I tremble. Fear not then, O my soul, be comforted, despair not: Hope in him whom thou fearest, betake thy self unto him from whom thou hast fled. O Jesus Christ, for this thy names sake do unto me according to thy name. Look upon me miserable man, that call upon thy name: If thou receive me into the most ample bosome of thy mercy, thou shalt no whit be straited. It is true, O Lord, my conscience hath deserved damnation, and my repentance is not sufficient for satisfaction: But it is most certain, that thy mercie is greater then my offence. In thee, O Lord,
                     Psal. 31.1. 
                     do I put my trust, let me never be confounded.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     Meditat. VII. Of the fruit of the Lords Passion.
                  
                     My hope on Christ is fixed sure,
                     Who wounded was my wounds to cure.
                  
                  AS often as I think of the Lords passion, I presume much of the love of God and the forgivenesse of my sinnes. He bowes down his head to kisse me:
                        Bernard upon the Passion. He stretcheth forth his arms to embrace me: He openeth his hands to give unto me: He openeth his side that I may see his heart flaming with love: He is lifted up from the earth that he may draw all unto him: his wounds are blue with grief, and shining with love: Therefore by the opening of his wounds we ought to enter into the secrets of his heart. With him there is most plenteous redemption, because his bloud distilled not down drop by drop, but flowed down most plentifully from five parts of his body: As the grape cast into the wine-presse is squeezed,
                        Bernard.
                      and poureth forth liquour on every side: So the flesh of Christ being

pressed with the weight of Gods anger, and our sinnes, doth on every side poure forth the liquour of blood. When Abraham would have offered his sonne for a sacrifice, the Lord said,Gen. 22.12. 
                     Now I know of a truth that thou lovest me: Do thou likewise acknowledge the infinite love of the eternall Father, in that he would deliver his onely begotten Sonne to death for us.
                     John 3.16 
                     He loved us when we were his enemies:
                     Rom. 5.10 And can he forget us when we are reconciled unto him by the death of his Sonne? Can he forget the precious bloud of his Sonne, when as he telleth the tears and the steps of the godly?Psal. 56.8. Can Christ in his life forget those, for whom he was willing to undergo death? Can he in the time of his glory forget those, for whom he suffered so great torments? Consider thou faithfull soul,
                        Luther.
                      the manifold fruits of the Lords passion. Christ poured forth for us a bloudy sweat, that in the agonie of death a cold sweat might not oppresse us. It was his pleasure to wrestle with death, that we might not faint in the agony of death. It was his will to suffer most

grievous anxietie and sorrow even unto death, that he might make us partakers of everlasting joy in the heavens. He would be betrayed with a kisse, which is a signe of friendship and good will, that he might blot out the sinne by the which Satan betrayed our first parents under the colour of friendship. He would be apprehended and bound by the Jews, that he might set us at liberty which were bound in the chain of our sinnes, and subject to be cast into everlasting damnation. He would begin his passion in the garden, that he might purge away sinne which took its beginning in the garden of paradise. He would be comforted by an angel, that he might make us angels fellows in the heavens. He was forsaken of his own disciples, that he might glue unto himself us, who had most shamefully revolted from God. Before the Councel he was accused by false witnesses, that Satan might not accuse us by the law of God. He was condemned on earth, that we might be absolved in heaven. He that committed no sinne was

speechlesse, that we might not in the day of judgement be strucken dumbe by reason of our sinnes. He was willing to be buffeted, that we might be freed from the sting of conscience and buffetings of Satan: He suffered himself to be mocked, that we might insult over Satan the insulter: His face was covered, that he might remove from us the vail of sinne by which we were hindred that we could not behold the face of God, as being involved in damnable ignorance: He would be disrobed, that he might restore unto us the robe of innocencie, which we had lost by sinne: He was pricked with thorns, that he might cure the compunctions of our hearts: He underwent the burden of the crosse, that he might take from us the burden of everlasting punishment: He cr

                     Matt. 27.46. that he might purchase for us an everlasting habitation with God: He thirsted on the crosse, that he might merit for us the dew of Gods grace, and free us from everlasting thirst: He would be scorched in the fire of

Gods anger, that he might free us from the fire of hell. He stood as guiltie, that he might absolve us. He was condemned, that we might be delivered from condemnation. He was scourged by the hands of the unrighteous, that he might free us from the scourges of the devil. He cried out for grief, that he might preserve us from everlasting exclamation. He poured forth tears, that he might wipe away tears from our eyes. He died, that we might live. He felt the pains of hell, that we might never feel them. He was humbled, that so he might cure our sinfull tumour. He was crowned with thorns that he might merit for us a celestiall crown. He suffered of all, that he might save all. His eyes were darkened in death, that we might live in the light of celestiall glory. He suffered ignominie and reproches, that we might heare the angels sing chearfully in heaven. Despair not then, O faithfull soul: An infinite good was off
                        •
                     nded by thy sinnes, and an infinite price is payed for them. Thou shouldest have been

condemned for thy sinnes: But the Sonne of God took upon him the sinnes of the whole world, and was condemned for them. Thou deservedst to be punished for thy sinnes: But God hath punished them alreadie in his Sonne. The wounds of thy sinnes are great: But the balsam of Christs bloud is more precious, and of vertue to cure them.Deut. 27.26. Moses pronounceth thee cursed, because thou hast not kept all that was wrote in the book of the law: But Christ was made the curse for thee. In the court of heaven there is an hand-writing against thee: But Christ hath cancelled that with his bloud.Col. 2.14. Let thy passion therefore, O Christ, be my last refuge!

                     st thou still doubt of the mercie of God? Remember

thy Creatour: Who created thee without thee?Psal. 139.15. 
                     Who formed thy body in secret in the lower parts of the earth? Who took care of thee when thou wast not? will not he have care of thee, now he hath made thee after his own image? I am the creature of God, to the Creatour do I convert my self: Though my nature be infected by the devil, though it be wounded by theeves, that is, by my sinnes,Luke 10.30. yet my Creatour liveth: He which made me, can also renew me: He which created me without any evil, can take all evil from me, whatsoever hath entred into me by the suggestion of the devil, by Adams prevarication, by my own action, yea though it hath overrun my whole substance: Therefore my Creatour can reform me, if so be that it stands with his good pleasure and will: and certainly he will, for who ever hated his own workmanship? Are we not before him like clay in the hands of the potter? If he had hated me, certainly he would never have created me, when I was nothing.1. Tim. 3.10. 
                     He is the Saviour of all men,

but especially of them that beleeve. He created me wonderfully, but he redeemed me more wonderfully:
                        Bernard.
                      It never appeared more plainly that he loved us, then in his wounds and passion. Surely he is truly beloved,
                        Clem. Alex.
                      for whose sake the onely begotten Sonne of God is sent from the bosome of his Father: I
                        •
                      thou didst not desire my salvation, Lord Jesus, why didst thou descend from heaven? But thou didst descend upon earth, to die on the crosse. God to redeem a servant, spared not his own Sonne.
                     Rom. 8.32. Therefore assuredly, God loveth man with a wonderfull love, seeing that he hath delivered up his Sonne to be afflicted, slain, and crucified for the redemption of man. Very deare,1. Pet 1.18. and very great was the price of our redemption: Therefore great and deare is the mercy of our Redeemer. It might seem to some that God loves his adopted sonnes, as dearly as his onely begotten Sonne: For that on which we bestow any thing, is dearer then that which we bestow: That he might make us his adopted sonnes▪ he spared not his natural and coessentiall Sonne:

It is no wonder then if he hath prepared for us mansions in his heavenly house,Joh. 14.2. seeing that he hath given us his own Sonne, in whom is the fulnesse of the divinity. Certainly, where there is the fulnesse of the divinitie, there is also the fulnesse of life and glory everlasting: But if he in Christ hath given unto us the fulnesse of life everlasting, how shall he denie unto us a little particle thereof? Assuredly our heavenly Father loveth us his adopted sonnes with exceeding great love, seeing he hath delivered up his onely begotten Sonne for us. Assuredly the Sonne embraceth us with exceeding great love, seeing that he hath delivered up himself for us. To make us rich, he endured extreme povertie: for he had not where to lay his head.
                     Matt. 8.20. To make us the sonnes of God, he is made man: neither doth he neglect us now, having finished the work of our redemption, but still intercedeth for us,
                     Rom. 8.34 sitting at the right hand of the divine Majestie. What thing is there necessary for my salvation which he shall not obtain, seeing that he hath bestowed himself

to merit salvation for me? What will the Father denie unto his Sonne who became ob

                     Phil. 2.8. What will the Father denie unto his Sonne, seeing that long ago he hath accepted the price of our redemption paid by him? Let my sinnes accuse me, yet in this my Mediatour do I trust: He which excuseth me, is greater then he that accuseth me: Let my weaknesse affright me, yet in his strength will I glory: Let Satan accuse me, if my Mediatour excuse me: Let heaven and earth accuse me, and mine iniquities prove me guiltie; it is sufficient for me that the Creatour of heaven and earth, and righteousnesse it self doth intercede for me. The sufficiencie of my merit is to know that my merit is not sufficient:
                        Bernard.
                      It shall be sufficient for me to have him propitious, against whom onely I have sinned: Whatsoever he hath decreed not to impute, shall be as if it had not been: Neither doth it trouble me that my sinnes are both grievous and divers, and often repeated: For if I were not burdened

with sinnes, what need I desire his righteousnesse?
                        Austine.
                      If I had no disease, what need I implore the help of the physician?Mat. 9.12. Mat. 1 21. 1. Cor. 1.30. He is the Physician, he is the Saviour, he is righteousnesse it self, he cannot deny himself: I am sick, I am condemned, I am a sinner, I cannot deny my self. Have mercy on me, O thou my Physician, my Saviour, and my righteousnesse! Amen.
               
               
                  
                     Meditat. IX. That God alone is to be loved.
                  
                     By love cleave fast to God above:
                     For nought on earth deserves thy love.
                  
                  
                     
                        Anselm.
                     RAise up thy self, O faithfull soul, and love that chief good in whom are all goods, without whom there is no other true good. No creature can satisfie our desire, because no creature is perfectly good, but onely good by participation. Some current of good doth descend upon the creature from the Creatour, but the fountain is still in God: Why therefore should we forsake the fountain, and follow the current? All good in

the creatures, is but the image of that perfect good which is in God, yea, which is God: Why therefore should we lay hold on the image, and let go the thing it self? Noahs dove could not finde on the moveable waters where her foot might rest:Gen. 8.9. Even so our soul amongst all sublunarie things cannot finde out which can fully satisfie her desire, by reason of their inconstancie and frailtie. Doth not he wrong himself which loveth any thing unworthy of his love? Now the soul of man is more noble then all the creatures, because it was redeemed by the passion and death of God: Why therefore should it love the creatures? Is it not contrary to that majestie unto which God hath exalted the Saints? Whatsoever we love, we love either for power, or wisdome, or beauty: And what is more powerfull then God? what is more wise then God? what is more beautifull then God? All the power of earthly kingdomes is from him, and under him: All the wisdome of men compared with the wisdome of God is foolishnesse: All

the beautie of the creatures compared with the beautie of God, is deformitie. If some powerfull king should treat by messengers with a virgin of mean rank and condition concerning marriage: should she not do foolishly in neglecting the king, and settling her affection upon the messengers the kings servants? So God by the beautie of all the creatures desires to call us unto him, &amp; invite us to love him: why therefore should our soul, which Christ would have to be his spouse, cleave unto the creatures the messengers of this spirituall marriage? The creatures themselves crie, Why do ye cleave unto us? why do ye place the end of your desire in us? We cannot satiate your appetite: Come ye rather to the Creatour of us both. From the creatures we can expect no reciprocall love: The creatures did not begin first to love us: But God who is love it self,1. John 4.16. cannot but love those that love him: Yea he prevents our desires and our love, by loving us first: How greatly then is God to be loved, who in the first place hath loved us so greatly! He

loved us when as yet we were not: For it was the love of God that we came into this world.Rom. 5.10 
                     He loved us when we were his enemies: For it was his mercy and his love that he sent his sonne to be our redeemer.8. He loved us when we were fallen into sin: For it is his love that he doth not presently deliver us to death in our sinnes, but still expects our conversion. It is his love that beyond our merits, yea contrary to our merits, he translateth us to the celestiall palaces. Without the love of God thou canst never come to the saving knowledge of God: without the love of God all knowledge is unprofitable, yea hurtfull: Wherefore love exceedeth the knowledge of all mysteries, because this may be in the devils, but that cannot be but in the godly. Why is the divel most unhappy? Because he cannot love the chiefest good. Contrarywise, why is God most happy and blessed?Wisd. 11.24▪
                      Because he loveth all things, because he is delighted in all his works. Why is not our love of God perfect in this life? Because the measure of our love is according

to the measure of our knowledge.1. Cor. 13.12. 
                     Now in this life we know but in part, and in a glasse: In the life to come we shall be perfectly blessed, because we shall perfectly love God: We shall perfectly love God, because we shall perfectly know him. No man can hope to have the perfect love of God in the world to come, which beginneth not to love God in this world. The kingdome of God must begin in the heart of man in this life, or else it cannot be consummated in the life to come. Without the love of God there is no desire of eternall life: How then can any one be partaker of the chiefest good, which loveth not, which seeketh not,
                        Savanar.
                      which desireth not? Such as thy love is, such art thou; because thy love transformeth thee into it self. Love is the chiefest couple, because the lover and the thing loved become one. What hath conjoyned the most just God and wretched sinners? What hath conjoyned them being infinitely distant one from the other? Infinite love. And yet that the infinite justice of God

might not be weakned, the infinite price of Christ interceded. Again, what hath conjoyned together God the Creatour and the faithfull soul created, things infinitely distant? Love. In the life which is eternall, we shall be joyned to God in the chiefest degree. Why? Because we shall love him in the chiefest degree. Love uniteth and transformeth: if thou lovest carnall things, thou art carnall. If thou lovest the world, thou shalt become worldly:1. Cor. 15▪ 50. Kempis.
                      
                     But flesh and bloud cannot enter into the kingdome of God. If thou lovest God and celestiall things, thou shalt become celestiall. The love of God is the chariot of Elias ascending up into heaven. The love of God is the joy of the minde, the paradise of the soul, it excludeth the world, it overcometh the devil, it shutteth hell, it openeth heaven. The love of God is that seal by which God sealeth the elect and beleevers:Rev. 7.3. God at the last judgement will acknowledge none to be his, but those that are sealed with this seal. For faith it self, the onely instrument of our justification and salvation,

is not true, unlesse it doth demonstrate it self by love. There is no true faith, unlesse there be a firm confidence; and there is no confidence without the love of God. That benefit is not acknowledged, for which we do not give thanks; and we do not give thanks to him whom we do not love: If therefore thy faith be true, it will acknowledge the benefit of our redemption wrought by Christ; it will acknowledge, and give thanks; it will give thanks, and love. The love of God is the life and rest of the soul: When the soul departs from the body by death, then the life of the body departeth: When God departs out of the soul by reason of sins, then the life of the soul departeth. Again, God dwells in our hearts by faith,
                     Eph. 3.17. God dwells in the soul by love, because the love of God is diffused in the hearts of the elect by the holy Spirit:Rom. 5.5. There is no tranquillitie to the soul without the love of God: The world and Satan do much disquiet it: But God is the chief rest of the soul: There is no peace of conscience but to those that are justified by

faith: there is no true love of God but in them that have a filiall confidence in God: Therefore let the love of our selves, the love of the world, the love of the creatures die in us, that the love of God may live in us: Which God begin in us in this world, and perfect in the world to come!

                     and bare our griefs and sicknesses. O Lord Jesus! That which in us merited eternall punishment, thou tookest upon thy self: That burden which would have pressed us down into hell, thou hast undergone: Thou wast wounded for our iniquities, thou wast broken for our sinnes:
                     Isa. 53.5. By the bluenesse of thy wounds are we healed:6. 
                     The Lord hath laid upon thee the iniquities of us all. Surely wonderfull indeed is this change.

Thou takest our sinnes upon thy self, and bestowest thy righteousnesse upon us: Death due unto us thou undergoest thy self, and conferrest life upon us: I cannot therefore by any means doubt of thy grace, or despair by reason of my sinnes. The worst thing that was in us, thou tookest upon thy self: How then canst thou despise that which is the best in us and thine own work, to wit, our soul and body? Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,
                     Psal. 16.

                     neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption: For he is truly sanctified whose sinnes are abolished and taken away: Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, and to whom the Lord imputeth not his sinnes:Psal. 32.1. How can God impute our sinnes to us, when he hath already imputed them to another? For the wickednesse of his people he hath smitten his best beloved Sonne:
                     Isa. 53.8. By the knowledge of him therefore he shall justifie many, and shall bear their iniquities. How shall he justifie those that are his? Heare and attend, O my soul: He shall save

them by the knowledge of him, that is, by the saving acknowledgement and firm apprehension by faith of the mercie and grace of God in Christ. This is life eternall,

                      And therefore if thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and beleeve in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Faith apprehendeth Christs satisfaction: He bare the iniquities of those that are his, he suffered for the sinnes of many, he interceded for the transgressours: For he should have had very few just, unlesse in mercy he had received sinners. Thou shouldst have had few just, O Jesus, unlesse thou hadst remitted the sinnes of the unjust. How then shall Christ judge according to severitie, the sinnes of the penitent, which he hath taken upon himself? How shall he condemn him that is guilty of sinne, seeing that he himself was made sinne for us? Will he condemn those,2. Cor. 5.21. whom he calleth his friends?Joh. 15.14▪
                      Will he condemn

those, for whom he hath intreated? Will he condemn those, for whom he died? Lift up thy self therefore, O my soul, and forget thy sinnes,Ezek. 18.22. for the Lord hath forgotten them. Whom dost thou fear as the punisher of thy sinnes but the Lord, who himself made satisfaction for thy sinnes? If any other had payed the price of my redemption, I might have doubted whether the just Judge would accept of that satisfaction: If a man or an angel had satisfied for my sinnes, yet still there might be a doubt, whether the price of redemption were sufficient: But now there is no place for doubt. How can it be that he will not accept of that price which he hath payd himself? How can that choose but be sufficient, which is from God himself?Psal. 42.5. Psal. 25.10 Psal. 119.137. Psal. 42.5. 
                     Why art thou troubled O my soul? All the wayes of God are mercie and truth: Iust is the Lord, and just are his judgements: Why art thou troubled O my soul? Let the mercy of God raise thee up, let the justice of God also raise thee up. For if God be just, for one offence

he will not exact double satisfaction. For our sinnes he hath smitten his Sonne: How then can he smite us his servants for them? How can he punish our sinnes in us, which he hath already punished in his Sonne? The truth of the Lord endureth for ever: As I live, saith the Lord,
                     Psal. 117.2. Ezek. 33.11. 
                     I will not the death of a sinner, but rather that he turn from his wickednesse and live.
                     Matt. 11.28. 
                     Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you, saith our Saviour. Shall we make God a liar, and labour by the weight of our sinnes to bear down his mercy? To make God a liar, and to denie his mercy,

                     Rom. 5.20. 
                     there also grace hath abounded much more, and overweigheth our sinnes by infinite degrees. For sinnes are but the sinnes of men; but grace is the grace of God: Sinnes are temporall; but the grace of our Lord is from eternitie to eternitie. Satisfaction

hath been made for our sinnes, and the grace of God is repaired by the death of Christ, and is established for ever: unto which I betake my self as a devout suppliant.

It is true indeed, Lord Jesus, I am burdened overmuch, and I sigh under the weight of my sinne: But I make haste unto thee the fountain of living water. Come unto me, Lord Jesus, that so I may come unto thee: I come unto thee, Lord, because thou first camest unto me: I come unto thee, Lord Jesus, and with anxietie I desire thee, for I finde no goodnesse in my self. But if I found any goodnesse in my self, I should not with such anxietie desire thee. True, Lord Jesus! I labour and

am heavy laden; neither can I compare my self with any of the saints, or penitent sinners, unlesse it be with the thief upon the crosse. Lord have mercy upon me, thou which hadst mercy on the thief upon the crosse. I have lived wickedly, I have lived i

Let thy merit succour me, as being my last refuge, and a remedie against my sinnes! For in that thou sufferedst, thou sufferedst for me: Therefore in that thou meritedst, thou meritedst for me and for mine unworthinesse:Rom. 5.8. Therefore God commendeth his love towards us, and proveth it by a testimonie surpassing the understanding of all men, yea of the angels themselves, in that Christ died for us when as yet we were sinners and the enemies of God.

bitter passion, by his most cruel death. O Lord Jesus! Thou that intreatedst for me, sufferedst for me, and diedst for me, before I could desire thy merit and passion, or move thee by my prayers to pay the ransome for me, how canst thou cast me away from thy face? How canst thou denie unto me the fruit of thy most holy passion,Psal. 130.1. when as now out of the deeps I cry unto thee, and beg the fruit of thy merit with tears and sighs? I was an enemie by nature when thou diedst for me: but I am made by grace thy friend, thy brother, and thy sonne. Thou heardst an enemie before he prayed unto thee, and how canst thou despise thy friend which comes unto thee with prayers and tears? Thou wilt not cast out him that cometh unto thee,
                     Joh. 6.37. because thy word is truth. Thou hast spoken unto us in spirit and truth, and we have received from thee the words o

kinsfolks: Before, our help was in the death of Christ; but now, it is in Christ his life: Before, we were dead in sinnes; but now, we are quickned in Christ: Oh the exceeding love of God,

                     Luk. 1.78. But if the death of Christ hath brought unto us righteousnesse and life, what shall his life do? If our Saviour dying paid the price unto his Father, what shall he do now being alive and interceding for us? For Christ liveth and dwells in our heart, if the remembrance of his most holy merit live and flourish in it. Draw me, Lord Jesus, that I may possesse in the truth of the thing, that which here I expect by the firmnesse of hope!

                     Faith is but dead, wants charity.
                  
                  O Thou beloved soul consider the power of faith, and give thanks unto God who is the onely giver thereof: It is faith alone that doth in such manner ingraft us into Christ, that as vine-branches do draw their sap from the vine,Joh. 15.4▪
                      so we also from him do draw life, righteousnesse, and salvation. Adam fell from the grace of God, and lost the divine image by his incredulitie: But we are again received to grace; and the image of God begins to be renewed in us by faith. By faith Christ becomes ours, and dwells in us: And where Christ is, there is the grace of God: And where the grace of God is,Eph 2.8. there is the inheritance of eternall

life. By faith Abel offered unto God a greater sacrifice then Cain:
                     Heb. 11.4 So by faith we offer unto God spirituall sacrifices,
                     Heb. 13.15. Heb. 11.5 that is, the fruit of our lips▪ By faith Enoch was translated: So faith takes us from the society of men, and makes us have our conversation in heaven,
                     Philip. 3.20. yea whiles we are here upon earth. Christ even now dwels in us, we have already eternall life in us,Heb. 11.7 but it is hid. By faith Noah prepared the ark: So we by faith do enter into the Church, in which our souls are preserved, when all other perish in the vast sea of this world. By faith Abraham left the idolatrous land:
                     8. So by faith we go out of this world, leaving our parents, brethren, and kinsfolks, and cleave unto Christ, who calleth us by his word. By faith Abraham went into a strange countrey in expectation of the promised land:
                     9. So we by faith do look for the celestiall Jerusalem which God hath prepared in the heavens.
                     Rev. 21.2. We are strangers and pilgrims in this world,Psal. 39.12 and travel by faith unto a celestiall countrey.Heb. 11.11. 
                     By faith Sarah conceived her sonne Isaac

in her old age: So we being spiritually dead, have received by faith strength to conceive Christ spiritually.

By faith Abraham offered up Isaac:
                     17. So also we by faith do spiritually mortifie and sacrifice our own will, which is the beloved sonne of our soul:Mat. 16.24 For he which will follow Christ must denie himself, that is, renounce his own will, his own honour, and the love of himself.

                  But faith is not a naked opinion, and profession, but a true and lively apprehension of Christ propounded to us in the gospel, a full perswasion of the grace of God, the confident rest of our soul, and peace which relies onely upon the merit of Christ. This faith is begotten of the seed of Gods word: For faith and the Spirit are one, and the word is the coach by which the holy Spirit is brought unto us. The fruit doth follow the nature of the seed: Faith is a divine fruit: Therefore the seed must be divine, and that is, The word. As in the creation light was made by the word of God; for God said, Let

there be light,
                     Gen. 1.14 
                     and there was light
                     ▪ So the light of faith ariseth from the light of the word of God: In thy light shall we see light,
                     Psal. 36.9. saith the Psalmist. Seeing faith doth joyn us unto Christ, seeing it makes us one with him, therefore it is the mother of all vertues in us. Where there is faith, there is Christ; where Christ is, there is an holy life; to wit, true humility, true gentlenesse, true love. Christ and the holy Spirit are not severed: where the holy Spirit is, there is true holinesse: Therefore where there is not an holy life, there is not the sanctifying Spirit. And where there is not the Spirit, neither is there Christ; where there is not Christ, neither is there faith. Whatsoever branch doth not suck its life and nourishment from the vine,Joh. 15.4. is not to be judged a part of the vine: So neither are we yet joyned to Christ by faith, unlesse we suck our life and nourishment from him. Faith is a kinde of spirituall light: For our hearts are enlightned by faith: Therefore it spreads abroad the rayes of good works: But where

the rayes of spirituall life are not, there is not yet the true light of faith. Bad works are the works of darknes: But faith is light:2. Cor. 6.14. And what communion is there between light and darknesse? Bad works are the seed of Satan: But faith is the seed of Christ: And what communion is there between Christ and Satan?2. Cor. 6.15. By faith our hearts are purified: But how can there be any inward purity in the heart, when the words are impure, and the outward works appear impure? Faith is the victorie which overcometh the world:
                     1. Joh. 5.4 And how can there be true faith there, where the flesh overcometh the Spirit, and leadeth it as it were captive? By faith we have Christ, and in Christ eternall life: But no impenitent sinner that persevereth in his sinnes, can be partaker of eternall life: How then can he be partaker of Christ? How can he be partaker of faith? Kindle in us, O Christ, the light of true faith, that by faith we may obtain eternall salvation.

                     Rejoyce in the Lord with gladnesse, and leap thou faithfull soul, for joy in thy God, who hath clothed thee with the garments of salvation, and compassed thee about with the robes of righteousnesse, like a spouse adorned with jewels and bracelets. Rejoyce for the honour of the bridegroom:
                        Austine.
                      Rejoyce for the beauty of the bridegroom: Rejoyce for the love of the bridegroom. His honour is the greatest that can be: For he is true God blessed for ever.
                     Rom. 9 5. How great then is the dignity of this creature, I mean the faithfull soul,

seeing the Creatour himself is willing to betroth her unto himself! His beautie is the greatest that can be: For he is beautifull above the sonnes of men, for they saw the glorie of him,John 1.14 Mat. 17.2. 
                     as the glory of the onely begotten of the Father: his face shined like the sunne, and his garments were white as snow.
                     Psal. 45.2▪ Psal. 8.5. 
                     His lips were full of grace, and he was crowned with glory and honour.

On the bridegrooms part there is the greatest beautie: On the spouses part there is the greatest deformitie.

                      Behold thou faithfull soul, behold the infinite love of the bridegroom! It was his love that drew him down from

heaven unto the earth: It was his love that bound him to a pillar: It was his love that fastened him to the crosse: It was his love that enclosed him up in the grave: It was his love that he descended into hell. What could make him to do all these things? Surely, it was his love towards his spouse. But our hearts are stony, and heavier then lead, if the bond of so great love cannot draw us unto God, whereas it hath drawn God unto us. Naked was his spouse,Ezek. 16.22. and being naked could not be admitted into the royall palace of the heavenly King:Isa. 61.10 And he hath clothed her with the garments of righteousnesse and salvation, whereas she lay enwrapped and involved in the foul coat of her sinnes, and the most filthy rags of iniquitie: He hath granted unto her to be arayed in fine linen,
                     Rev. 19.8. 
                     clean and white: the fine linen is the righteousnesse of Saints: That garment is the righteousnesse which was obtained by the death and passion of the bridegroom himself. Jacob laboured fourteen yeares to obtain Rachel to be his wife:Gen. 29.27. But Christ for

thirty foure yeares almost endured hunger, thirst, cold, povertie, ignominie, reproches, bonds, whips, the bitternesse of gall, and death upon the crosse, to purchase unto himself the faithfull soul to be his spouse. Samson went down and chose out of the Philistines,Judg. 14.1 which were adjudged to destruction, a wife unto himself: The Sonne of God came down and chose unto himself a spouse out of men that were condemned, and subject to eternall death. The whole stock of the spouse was at enmitie with the heavenly Father, and he by his most bitter passion hath reconciled it unto his Father. The spouse was prostrate upon the face of the earth,Ezek. 16.22. and polluted in her own bloud: But he hath washed her with the water of baptisme, and cleansed her with a most holy laver: He hath cleansed the bloud of his spouse with his own bloud: For the bloud of the Sonne of God doth cleanse us from all our sinnes.
                     1. Joh. 1.7▪
                      The spouse was deformed: But he hath anointed her with the oyl of grace and mercy.Ezek. 16.9 The spouse was not honourably

apparelled, but he hath put bracelets and eare-rings upon her: He hath adorned her with vertues and divers gifts of the holy Spirit.11. The spouse was very poore and had no pledge to give unto him:
                        Tertull.
                      Therefore hath he left unto her the pledge of his Spirit, &amp; received frō her the pledge of his flesh, and hath carried it up into heaven. The spouse was hungry: But he hath given unto her fine flour
                           •
                         and hony and oyl to eat:
                     Ezek. 16.19. He doth feed her with his flesh and bloud unto eternall life. The spouse is disobedient, and often breaketh her marriage faith; she committeth fornication with the world and with the devil, and yet the bridegroom out of his infinite love doth receive her again into favour, as often as she returneth unto him by true repentance. Acknowledge and confesse, thou faithfull soul, these so many and so great arguments of his infinite love. Love,
                        Austine.
                      thou faithfull soul, the love of him that for love of thee descended into the wombe of the virgin: We must love him that delivered up himself for us,
                        Anselm.
                      so much more then our

selves, by how much he is greater then us: Let us make our whole life conformable unto him, who for the love of us made himself wholly conformable unto us. He is justly to be accounted most unthankfull, who loveth not again him of whom he was first beloved. How greatly therefore ought we to love him, who for the love of us, did as it were forget his own majestie! Happy soul, which by the bond of this spirituall marriage is joyned unto Christ! She doth safely and confidently apply unto her self all the benefits of Christ: even as in another case, by wedlock the wife doth shine glorious by the reflexion of the husbands rayes upon her. Now by faith alone are we made partakers of this blessed and spirituall marriage, as it is written,Hos. 2.19. 
                     I will betroth thee unto me in faith: Faith doth ingraft us into Christ,Joh. 15.5. as a branch into the spirituall vine, that we may suck our life and nourishment from him. And as they which are joyned in marriage,Mat. 19 6. 
                     are no more two but one flesh: So they which by faith are joyned unto the Lord,1. Cor. 6.17. become

one spirit with him, because Christ by faith dwelleth in our hearts:
                     Eph. 3.17. Gal. 5.6. And this faith if it be true, it worketh by love. As in the old Testament the priests were compelled to marry virgins:
                     Lev. 21.13 So the celestiall priest doth spiritually couple unto himself such a virgin as doth keep her self pure and undefiled from the embracements of the devil, the world, and her own flesh. Vouchsafe, O Christ, at length to admit us unto the marriage of the Lambe.

                  LEt us withdraw our mindes a while from these temporall things, and let us contemplate the mysterie of the Lords nativitie. The Sonne of God came down from heaven unto us, that we might obtain the adoption of sonnes.
                     Gal. 4.5. God is made man▪
                     
that man may be made partaker of divine grace and nature.1. Pet. 1.20. About the evening of this world would Christ be born; to shew that the benefits of his incarnation concern not this life, but that which is everlasting. In the time of Augustus the peace-maker would he be born;Luk. 2.1. because he made peace between God and man. In the time of Israels servitude would he be born; because he is the redeemer and deliverer of his people. Under the reigne of a forrein king would he be born;Joh▪ 18.
                           •
                        6 because his kingdome was not of this world. He is born of a virgin, to signifie that he is not conceived or born, but in the hearts of those that are spirituall virgins, that is, whose mindes adhere not unto the world and the devil, but unto God in one spirit. His birth was pure and holy, to sanctifie our impure and polluted nativity.
                        Tertull.
                      He is born of a virgin betrothed to an husband, to honour matrimony, which was Gods institution. He is born in the darknesse of the night; because he was the true light which illuminateth the darknesse of the world. He is laid in a

manger, because he is the true food of our souls.Luke 2 7. He is born betwixt an ox and an asse, that men which were become like unto the beasts, might be restored to their former dignitie. He is born in Bethlehem, that is, in the house of bread,Mat. 2.1. because he brought with him most plentifull food of divine benefits. He is the first and onely begotten of his mother upon earth, because he was according to his divine nature the first and onely begotten of his Father in heaven. He is born poore and needie, to purchase for us celestiall riches.2. Cor. 8.9 He is born in a stable, to bring us to his royall palace which is in heaven. From heaven is sent the messenger of this so great a benefit,Luke 2.9. because no man on earth understood the greatnesse thereof: And further it was meet that the messenger of celestiall gifts should be celestiall. The armies of the angels rejoyce,
                     13. because we are by the incarnation of the Son made partakers of their happinesse. To the shepherds first is declared this so great a miracle,8. because the tru
                        •
                      shepherd of our souls came to bring

back the lost sheep into the way. To the ignoble and those that were despised is the matter of so great joy declared, because no man can partake thereof, unlesse he become vile in his own eyes. To them that watch over their flocks is his nativitie declared, because they onely whose hearts do watch unto God, and not they that lie snorting in their sinnes, are made partakers of so great a gift. The quire of heaven, which was made sorrowfull for the sinne of our first father,13. doth now sing and rejoyce. The brightnesse and glory of that Lord and King appeareth now in the heavens, whose lowlinesse men despised here on earth. The angel sayes unto them, Fear not, because he was born,10. who would quite take away all cause of fear. Joy was declared from heaven, because the authour and giver of joy was born. Joy is commanded, because enmity between God and man, the cause of all sorrow, is removed. Glory in the highest is rendred unto God,
                     14. which our first father, by his unlawfull transgression of the commandment,

would have taken away. True peace is obtained by his nativitie, because before, men were enemies unto God; before, their own conscience was their adversarie; before, they were at dissension one with another. True peace is restored to the earth, because he is overcome which held us captive.14. 
                     Let us go with the shepherds to Christs manger,
                     15. that is, to the church, and in his swadling-clothes, that is, in the sacred scriptures, shall we finde the infant enwrapped. Let us with Mary the holy mother of our Lord,19. 
                     keep the words of so great a mysterie, and let us every day recall them to our memorie. Let us follow with our voice the angels which sing before us,13. and let us render unto God due thanks for so great a benefit. Let us rejoyce and be glad with all the heavenly army. For if the angels do so greatly rejoyce for our sake: How much more ought we to rejoyce, seeing unto us he is born and given?Isa. 9.6. If the Israelites did lift up their voices with jubile when the ark of the covenant was brought unto them,2. Sam. 6.15. which was but a figure and

shadow of the Lords incarnation: How much more ought we to rejoyce, unto whom the Lord himself is come, and hath taken our flesh upon him?Joh. 8.56. If Abraham rejoyced when he saw the day of the Lord; when the Lord,

                      in an humane shape assumed for a time, appeared unto him: What should we do now Christ hath coupled unto himself our nature by an everlasting and inviolable covenant? Let us admire here the infinite goodnesse of God, who himself would descend unto us, seeing that we could not ascend unto him. Let us admire the infinite power of God, who of two things most distant, I mean the divine and humane nature, could make one, so nearly, that one and the same should be God and man. Let us admire the infinite wisdome of God, who could finde out means to work our salvation, when men and angels saw no means. An infinite good was offended; and an infinite satisfaction was required: Man had offended God; of man was satisfaction required: But by man neither could an infinite satisfaction be

made, neither could Gods justice be satisfied without an infinite price: Therefore God was made man,
                        Anselm.
                      that both he which had sinned might satisfie, and he which was infinite might pay an infinite price. Let us admire this wonderfull temper of Gods justice and mercie, which no creature could finde before God did manifest it, and none could fully perceive after it was made manifest. Let us admire these things, and not curiously prie into them: Let us desire to look in, though we cannot conceive all: Let us rather confesse our ignorance, then deny Gods omnipotence.

                     Of great joy indeed, that is, such as passeth mans understanding. It was a very great evil, that we

were held captive under the wrath of God, under the power of the devil, and under eternall damnation: But it was yet greater, because men either knew it not, or else did neglect it. But now, great joy is declared unto us, because he that delivereth us from all evils, is come into the world: He is come, a physician to the sick,

                      a redeemer to the captives, the way to the wanderers, life to them that were dead, &amp; salvation to them that were condemned.Exod. 3.10. As Moses was sent from the Lord to deliver the people of Israel from the servitude of Egypt: So Christ was sent from his Father to redeem all mankinde from the devils slavery. As the dove after the drying up of the waters of the deluge,Gen. 8.11 
                     brought an olive-branch into the ark of Noah: So Christ came into the world, to preach peace and the reconciliation of man with God. Therefore we have cause to rejoyce, and conceive great things of the mercy of God.Rom. 5.10 He which loved us so, being his enemies, that he did vouchsafe to assume our nature to be united to his divinitie, what will he

deny unto us being joyned unto him by participation of our flesh? Who ever hated his own flesh?
                     Eph. 5.29. How then can that chief and infinite mercy repell us from him, being now made partakers of his nature? Who can in words expresse, or in thought conceive the greatnesse of this mystery? Here is the greatest sublimitie, and the greatest humilitie; the greatest power, and the greatest infirmity; the greatest majestie, and the greatest frailtie: What is higher then God, and lower then man? What is more powerfull then God, and weaker then man? What is more glorious then God, and more frail then man? But that chief power found out a means to conjoyn these, seeing that the chief justice did necessarily require such a conjunction. Who also can conceive the greatnesse of this mysterie? An equivalent and infinite price was required for the sinne of man,
                        Anselm.
                      because man had turned himself away from the infinite good, which is God. But what could be equivalent to the infinite God? Therefore infinite justice it self takes

as it were of himself an equivalent price: and God the Creatour suffers in the flesh, that the flesh of the creature should not suffer for ever. An infinite goodnesse was offended, and none could intercede but a mediatour of infinite power: And what is infinite, but God? Therefore God himself reconciled the world unto himself,
                     2. Cor. 5.19. God himself became mediatour, God himself redeemed mankinde by his own bloud.
                     Act. 20.28 Who can conceive the greatnes of this mystery? The chief Creatour was offended, and the creature sought not with care to appease him, and to be reconciled unto him: So he which was offended, assumes the flesh of the creature, and becomes Reconciliatour. Man had forsaken God, and turned away himself unto the devil the enemy of God: and he that was forsaken makes diligent inquisition after the forsaker, and invites him most bountifully to come again unto him. Man had departed from that infinite good, and fallen into an infinite evil: And that same infinite good, by giving an infinite price of redemption,

delivered the creature from that infinite evil. Is not this infinite mercie farre exceeding all the finite understanding and thought of man? Our nature is become more glorious by Christ, then it was dishonoured by Adams sinne. We have received more in Christ, then we lost in Adam: Where sinne did abound, Gods grace did superabound.
                     Rom. 5.20 In Adam we lost our innocency, in Christ we have received perfect righteousnes. Let others admire Gods power: But his divine mercy is yet more to be admired; although power and mercy in God are equall, for both are infinite. Let others admire our creation: But I had rather admire our redemption; although creation and redemption are both acts of infinite power. It was a great thing to create man, having deserved nothing; for as yet he had no being: But it seems yet to be greater, to take upon him to satisfie for the debt of man, and to redeem him when he deserved evil. It was a wonderfull thing that our fl

                     sh and our bones were formed by God,Gen. 2.23. but yet it is more wonderfull that

God would become flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bones. Be thankfull,Eph. 5.30.

                      feeleth not the sweetnes of the heavenly feast: and he which hungreth not, tasteth not. To beleeve on Christ, is to come to his heavenly feast: But no man can beleeve unlesse he confesse his sinnes with contrition, and repent him of the same. Contrition is the spirituall hunger of the soul, and faith is the spirituall

feeding. To the Israelites God gave Manna in the wildernesse, being the bread of angels:

                     Joh. 6.51. 
                     Luk. 15.16. He that is full with the husks of the swine, that is, with the delights of this world, desires not that sweetnesse. The outward man perceiveth not what is sweet unto the inward. God gives his Manna in the wildernesse, that is, where all earthly meat, and all earthly consolation is taken from the soul. He which had married a wife,
                     Luk. 14.20. 
                     refused to come: But the chaste virgins, that is, those souls which neither cleave unto the devil by sinnes, nor to the world by delights, do come unto this feast.2. Cor. 11.2. 
                     I have espoused you, as a chaste virgin, to one husband, saith the Apostle. Our soul must not commit spirituall adultery, that so God may contract spirituall marriage with her.Luk. 14.18. 
                     He which had a desire to

go see his field, refused to come: They which love the pleasures of this world, come not unto the sweetnesse of the heavenly feast. The desire is the foot of the soul: Our soul comes not to this mysticall feast, unlesse it desires; and it cannot desire the heavenly sweetnesse, if it be full with this worldly comfort. When the rich young man heard that for Christ he should forsake his riches, unto which his soul did cleave, he went away sorrowfull.

                      They which set their

hearts upon riches, desire not the heavenly riches. Earthly riches by a kinde of false shew of sufficiency satisfie the desire of the soul, that she may not seek after her true sufficiencie in God, which onely doth fully satiate the appetite. All earthly riches consist in the creatures, in silver, gold, building, ground, cattel: but no creature doth fully satisfie the soul, because she is more excellent then all the creatures; for they were all made for her use. How insufficient the creatures are to satiate and fulfill our desires, it appeareth at death, when all creatures forsake us. It is wonderfull that we should so firmly stick unto the creatures, when as they stick unto us so weakly and unconstantly.Gen. 3.6. 
                     Adam, when he turned away from the consolation of God, and sought delight in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, was driven out of Paradise: Our soul, if it turn away from God unto the creatures▪ is deprived of celestiall comfort, and is quite driven away from the tree of life. But what remains unto them that neglect this

feast? The world passeth away, and so do all they that cleave unto it:1. Joh. 2.17. The creatures passe away, and all they that put their trust in them. Our heavenly Father sweareth, that they which preferre oxen, fields, wives, that is, any earthly things whatsoever, before the sweetnesse of the heavenly feast,Luk 14.24 
                     shall never taste of his supper. After supper there is no further provision of meat made: and, if we neglect Christ, there is no other remedy left for us. Those contemners shall be punished with eternall famine, and live in eternall darknesse. They which would not heare Christ thus inviting them,Mat. 11.28 
                     Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavie laden, shall heare him at length denouncing,Mat. 25.41 
                     Go ye cursed into everlasting fire. The Sodomites were consumed with fire,
                     Gen. 19.14. because being called to this feast by the preaching of Lot, they would not come. The fire of Gods wrath, which lasteth for ever, shall consume them who being called by the gospel, have despised this feast. At the coming of the bridegroom,
                     Mat. 25.8. the virgins that

                     had no oyl in their lamps,
                     10. Granat.
                      staying too long, were shut out: So they whose hearts in this world are not filled with the oyl of the holy Spirit, shall not be admitted by Christ to the participation of joy, but they shall have the gate of indulgence, the gate of mercy, the gate of consolation, the gate of hope, the gate of grace, &amp; the gate of good works shut against them. Christ hath yet an inward kinde of calling: and happy is he that heares it!Rev. 3.20. Christ often knocks 
                           •
                        t the gate of our hearts by holy desires, devout sighs, and pious cogitations; and happy is he that openeth unto him! As soon as thou feelest in thy heart any holy desire of heavenly grace, assure thy self that Christ knocks at thy heart: Let him in, lest he passe by, and afterwards shut the gate of his mercy against thee. As soon as thou feelest in thy heart any spark of godly meditations, perswade thy self that it was kindled by the heat of divine love, that is, of the holy Spirit; cherish and nourish it, that it may grow to be a fire of love:1. Thess. 5.19. Take heed that thou quench not the

Spirit, and hinder the work of the Lord. He that destroyeth the temple of the Lord,
                     1. Cor. 3▪17. 
                     shall feel his severe judgement: Our heart is the temple of the Lord: And he destroyeth it, whosoever refuseth to give place to the holy Spirit inwardly calling by the word. In the old Testament the prophets could heare the Lord speaking inwardly: In the new Testament all the true godly do feel those inward motions of the holy Spirit drawing them. Blessed are they which heare and follow!
               
               
                  
                     Meditat. XVII. Of the fruits of Baptisme.
                  
                     If thou polluted art with sin,
                     The fountain's open, enter in.
                  
                  REmember, thou faithfull soul, the grace of God conferred upon thee in the saving laver of baptisme. Baptisme is the laver of regeneration:
                     Tit. 3.5. Therefore he that is dipt in the laver of baptisme, is no longer altogether carnall as before:John 3.5. But because he is born of God by water

and the Spirit, therefore, he is also the sonne of God;Rom. 8.14 and because a sonne, therefore an heir also of eternall happinesse. As the eternall Father at the baptisme of Christ uttered this voice,Mat. 3.17. 
                     This is my beloved Sonne: So all those that beleeve and are baptized, he adopteth to be his sonnes. As at the baptisme of Christ the holy Ghost appeared in the shape of a dove: So also is he present at our baptisme, and gives force unto it: yea, he is conferred by baptisme upon the beleevers, and effects in them new motions, that they become wise as serp
                           •
                        nts,
                     Mat. 10.16 Ravan.
                      
                     and innocent as doves. As it was at the creation, so is it also at our regeneration: At the first creation of things the Spirit of the Lord moved upon the waters,
                     Gen. 1.2. and gave a vitall force unto them: So also in the water of baptisme the holy Ghost is present, and makes it a saving means of our regeneration. Christ himself our Saviour would be baptized, that he might leave a testimonie, that by baptisme we are made his members. Oftentimes medicines are applyed to the head to

heal some other parts of the bodie: Christ is our spirituall head; He received the medicine of baptisme for to heal his mysticall bodie. God in the old Testament made a covenant with his people by circumcision:Gen. 17.11. So by baptisme in the new Testament we are received into the covenant of God. Baptisme succeeded in the place of circumcision: He therefore that is in the covenant of God, need not be afraid of the devils accusation. In baptisme we put on Christ:
                     Gal. 3.27. And from hence it is that the Saints are said to have made their robes white in the bloud of the Lambe.
                     Rev. 7.14. Christs perfect righteousnesse is that beautifull robe: whosoever therefore hath put on this robe, let him not fear the stains of sinne. There was a pool in Jerusalem about the sheep-market, into which at a certain time the angel of the Lord descended and troubled it,
                     John 5.4. 
                     and he that first descended into it after the troubling of the water, was cured of what disease soever: The water of baptisme is that pool, which healeth us of every disease of sinne, when the holy Spirit

descends into it, and troubles it with the bloud of Christ, who was made a sacrifice for us: In like manner in time past the sacrifices were washed in that pool at Jerusalem.
                  As at the baptisme of Christ the heavens were opened:
                     Mat. 3.16. So also at our baptisme the gate of heaven is opened unto us.
                        Luther.
                      At the baptisme of Christ all the holy and sacred Trinitie was present: And so likewise at our baptisme: And so by the word of promise, which is annexed unto the element of water, faith receiveth the grace of the Father adopting, the merit of the Sonne cleansing, and the efficacie of the holy Ghost regenerating. Pharaoh and all his host was drowned in the red sea;Exod. 14.27. The Israelites passed through safe and sound: So in baptisme all the host of vices is drowned; and the faithfull safely attain to the inheritance of the kingdome of heaven. Therefore also is baptisme that sea of glasse which John saw:Rev. 4.6. Through it, as through a kinde of glasse, the brightnesse of the sunne of righteousnesse enters into our mindes. And that sea was before

the throne of the Lambe: The church is the throne of the Lambe, in which onely the grace of holy baptisme is to be had. The prophet Ezekiel saw waters going out of the temple,
                     Ezek. 47.1 which did quicken and heal all: In the spirituall temple of God, that is, in the church, the saving waters of baptisme do yet spring forth, into the profunditie whereof our sinnes are thrown:Mic. 7.19 Whosoever come unto it, shall be healed and live. Baptisme is the spirituall floud in which all flesh of sinne is drowned. The impure crow goes forth like the Devil: But the dove like the holy Ghost flies and brings the olive-branch, that is, peace and tranquilitie unto our mindes. Remember therefore, thou faithfull soul, the greatnesse of the grace of God conferred upon thee in baptisme, and render due thanks unto him.
                  The more plentifull grace is conferred upon us in baptisme, the more diligent must we be in the custodie of the gifts conferred.Rom. 6.4. 
                     We are buried with Christ by baptisme: Therefore as Christ was raised up from the

dead unto the glory of his Father: So let us walk in newnesse of life.Joh. 5.14. 
                     We are made whole, let us sinne no more, lest a worse thing happen unto us. We have put on the most precious robe of Christs righteousnesse: Therefore let us not defile it with the stains of sinne. Our old man is crucified and dead in baptisme: Let the new man therefore live in us. We are regenerated and renewed in the spirit of our mindes by baptisme:Eph. 4.23. Therefore let not the flesh domineer over the spirit.2. Cor. 5.17. 
                     Old things are past: Behold a
                           •
                         things are become new: Let not therefore the oldnesse of the flesh, prevail against the newnesse of the spirit. We are made the sonnes of God by spirituall regeneration: Let us therefore live as it becometh the sonnes of such a Father. We are made the temple of the holy Ghost: Let us therefore prepare a thankfull seat for such a guest. We are received into Gods covenant: Let us take heed therefore that we do not serve under the devil, and so fall from the covenant of grace. Effect in us all these things, O blessed Trinity in Unitie!

Thou that hast given us such grace in baptisme, give us also the grace to persevere in it.
               
               
                  
                     Meditat. XVIII. Of the saving participation of the body and bloud of Christ.
                  
                     He that doth eat and drink by faith
                     Christs flesh and bloud, salvation hath.
                  
                  
                     HE that eateth my flesh,
                     John 6.54. 
                     and drinketh my bloud, shall live for ever, saith Christ. Exceeding great was the bountie and goodnesse of our Saviour, in that he did not onely assume our flesh, and exalt it to the throne of celestiall glory, but also feedeth us with his bodie and bloud unto eternall life. Oh the saving delicates of the soul! Oh the heavenly and angelicall food to be desired!1. Pet. 1.12. Heb. 2.16 Although the angels did desire to look into this mysterie, yet he did not assume the nature of the angels, but the seed of Abraham. Our Saviour is nearer unto us, then unto

the angels: for we have knowledge of his love by this,1. John 4.13. 
                     in that he hath given us of his own Spirit; neither of his Spirit onely, but of his bodie and bloud: For so saith Truth it self, of the bread and wine in the Eucharist:Matt. 26.26, 28. 
                     This is my bodie; This is my bloud. How can the Lord forget those whom he hath redeemed with his bodie and bloud, and whom he hath nourished with his bodie and bloud?Joh. 6.54. 
                     He that eateth the flesh, and drinketh the bloud of Christ, remaineth in Christ, and Christ in him. I do not much marvel therefore that the haires of our head are numbred,
                     Matt. 10.30. Luke 10.20. Isa. 49.16. Isa. 46.3. that our names are registred in heaven, that we are described in the hands of the Lord, and that we are carried in his bosome, seeing that we are fed with the bodie and bloud of Christ. Without doubt great is the dignitie of our souls, seeing that they are fed with a price of redemption of such value. Great also is the dignitie of our bodies, which being redeemed, and fed by the bodie of Christ, become the habitacles and temples of the holy Ghost, and the

dwelling places of the whole and most holy Trinitie. It cannot be that they should remain in the grave, being fed with the bodie and bloud of our Lord. This is meat indeed. We eat it: But we change it not into the nature of our bodie, but are changed into it. We are the members of Christ, and are animated by his Spirit, and fed with his body and bloud. This is the bread which came down from heaven,
                     Joh. 6.51. and giveth life unto the world: He that eateth thereof, shall never hunger. This is the bread of grace and mercy; Of this whosoever eateth,Psal. 34.8. Joh. 1.16. he shall taste and see how sweet the Lord is, and receive of his fulnesse grace for grace.
                     Joh. 6.50. 
                     This is the bread of life, not onely the living bread, but the quickning bread: Whosoever eateth thereof, he shall live for ever.
                     Joh. 6.58. 
                     This is the bread which came down from heaven; neither is it onely heavenly, but it makes those that eat thereof heavenly: They which eat it savingly in the spirit, shall become heavenly, because they shall not die, but shall be raised again at the last day.
                     Joh. 6.54. They shall be raised

again, but not to judgement; because he that eateth of this bread cometh not into judgement, nor into condemnation;Rom. 8.1. because there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus: but they shall be raised to life and salvation. For he that eateth the flesh of the Sonne of man,
                     John 6.56 
                     and drinketh his bloud, hath life in himself, and shall live through Christ.55. 
                     His flesh is meat indeed, and his bloud is drink indeed. Let us be filled therefore with the meat,Isa. 55.2. not of our works, but of the Lord.
                     Psal. 36.8. 
                     Let us be abundantly satisfied with the fatnesse, not of our house, but of the Lord. This is the true fountain of life; He that shall drink of this water shall never thirst;
                     John 4.14 
                     but it shall become in him a fountain of water springing up unto eternall life. All ye that thirst come unto these waters,
                     Isa. 55.1. 
                     and ye that have no silver, make haste, buy without money. Let them that thirst come, and come thou my soul that art vexed with the raging heat of sinne. But if thou beest destitute of the silver of thy merits, make haste the rather: If thou hast no merits of thine

own, make haste the more ardently to the merits of Christ: Make haste therefore, and buy without silver. Here is the chamber of Christ and the soul, from which let not thy sinnes deterre thee, and into which let not thy merits enter. For what can be our merits?Isa. 55.2. 
                     They lay out their silver, and not for bread; they labour, and not for fulnesse. Our labours do not satiate, neither is the grace of God bought with the silver of our merits: Therefore heare O my soul, and eat that which is good, and thou shalt be delighted with fatnesse. These words are spirit and life,
                     John 6.63 
                     and the words of eternall life. The cup of benediction is the communion of the bloud of Christ,
                     1. Cor. 10.15. 
                     and the bread which we break is the participation of the Lords bodie.
                     1. Cor. 6.17. 
                     We cleave unto the Lord: Therefore we are one Spirit with him. We are united unto him, not onely by the communion of nature, but also by the participation of his bodie and bloud. I do not therefore say with the Jews,John 6.5▪
                      
                     How can this man give us his flesh to eat? But rather crie out, How doth the

Lord distribute unto us his flesh to eat, and his bloud to drink! I do not prie into his power, but do admire his benevolence: I do not examine his majestie, but I reverence his goodnesse: His presence I beleeve, the manner of his presence I know not: I am certainly assured that it is most neare and inward.Ephes. 5.30. 
                     We are members of his body: flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones.
                     Joh. 6.56. 
                     He dwelleth in us, and we in him. My soul desireth to dive by cogitation into this most profound abysse, but cannot finde with what words to set forth and declare that goodnesse; and therefore is altogether amazed at the sight of the greatnesse of the grace of the Lord, and the glory of the blessed.
               
               
                  
                     Meditat. XIX. Of the mysterie of the Lords Supper.
                  
                     Be wise: Do not to farre enquire
                     'To that thou rather shouldst admire.
                  
                  IN the Lords holy Supper there is set before us a mysterie to be

trembled at, and to be adored of us by all means: There is the treasure and treasurie of divine grace. We know that there was a tree of life planted by God,Gen. 2.9. whose fruit might have conserved our first parents and their posteritie by the fertilitie and felicitie thereof. There was also placed in paradise a tree of the knowledge of good and evil:
                     9. But even that which was appointed by God for their salvation and life, and for an exercise of their obedience, became unto them an occasion of death and condemnation, whilest they, poore wretches, obeyed the devils allurements, and their own desires. Here also is prepared a tree of life, that sweet wood, whose leaves are for medicine, and whose fruit for meat:
                     Ezek. 47.12. The sweetnesse thereof doth take away the bitternesse of all evils, yea of death it self. Unto the Israelites was given Manna,
                     Exod. 16.15. that they might be fed with heavenly food: Here is that true Manna, which came down from heaven to give life unto the world.
                     Joh. 6.51. This is the heavenly bread, and the angelicall meat,35. of which whosoever

eateth, shall never hunger. The Israelites had the ark of the covenant,
                     Exod. 28.43. and the mercy-seat, where they might heare the Lord speak face to face:
                     Exod. 33.11. Here is the true ark of the covenant, that is, the most sacred bodie of Christ,Col. 2.3. 
                     wherein the treasures of all science, knowledge, and wisdome are laid up. Here is the true mercyseat in the bloud of Christ,
                     Rom. 3.25 which makes us to be beloved in the beloved:
                     Ephes. 1.6. neither doth he speak unto us onely by his inward consolation, but also dwelleth in us: neither doth he feed us onely with heavenly Manna, but with himself.Isa. 66.1. Here is the gate of heaven indeed, here is the angels ladder:
                     Gen. 28.12. For can heaven be greater then he that is in heaven? Can heaven be more nearly united unto God, then the flesh and humane nature which he hath assumed? Heaven indeed is the throne of God:
                     Isa. 11.2. But in the humane nature assumed by Christ resteth the holy Spirit.
                     Col. 2.9. God is in heaven: But in Christ dwelleth the fulnesse of the divinitie.
                     
                        Ambrose.
                      Certainly, this is a great and infallible pledge of our salvation. He had no greater

thing to give unto us: For what is greater then himself? What is so closely united unto him as his humane nature, which is assumed into the fellowship of the most blessed Trinitie, and made the treasurie of all heavenly goods? What is so nearly conjoyned unto him as flesh and bloud? And yet with these most heavenly nourishments doth he refresh us miserable worms, and make us partakers of his nature: And shall not he then make us partakers of his grace? Who ever hated his own flesh?
                     Eph. 5.29. How can the Lord then despise us whom he feedeth with his own flesh and bloud? How can he forget those, unto whom he hath given the pledge of his own bodie? How can Satan be able to overcome us, seeing that we are fed with heavenly food, that we faint not in battel? We are deare unto Christ; because he bought us at so deare a price: We are deare unto Christ; because he feeds us with such deare and precious things: We are deare unto Christ; because we are his flesh and members.
                     Eph. 5.30 This is the onely Panacea of all spirituall diseases,
                        Ignatius.
                      this

is the medicine of immortalitie: For what sinne is there so great,
                        Bernard.
                      that the sacred flesh of God cannot expiate? What sinne is so great, that the quickning flesh of Christ cannot heal? What sinne so mortall, that is not taken away by the death of the Sonne of God? What fierie darts of the devil can be so deadly, that they cannot be quenched in this fountain of divine grace? What so great stain of the conscience, that this bloud cannot purge? The Lord was present to the Israelites in a cloud, and in fire:
                     Exod. 13.21. Mal. 4.2. But here is no cloud, but the sunne of righteousnesse, the present light of our souls: Here is not felt the fire of Gods fury, but the heat of his love; neither doth he depart from us, but makes his mansion with us. Our first parents were brought into paradise,
                     John. 14.23. Gen. 2.8. that most sweet and fragrant garden, the type of eternall beatitude, that being put in minde of Gods bountie, they might perform due obedience unto their Creatour. Behold! Here is more then paradise in this place. For the creature is filled with the flesh of the Creatour: The

penitent conscience is cleansed by the bloud of the Sonne of God. By the body of Christ are nourished the members of Christ the head. The faithfull soul is fed with divine and heavenly dainties. The sacred flesh of God, which the angels adore in the unitie of person, which the archangels reverence, at which the Powers do tremble, and which the Vertues admire, is our spirituall food. Let the heavens rejoyce,
                     Psal. 96.11. 
                     and let the earth be glad, but much more the faithfull soul, upon whom such and so great benefits are bestowed.

handled of us: Therefore a due preparation is required, lest we finde death in stead of life, and receive condemnation in stead of mercy. How did that most holy Patriarch so famous for the strength of his faith,Gen. 18.2. how did he fear and tremble when the Sonne of God appeared unto him in the shape of man, and threatned that he would destroy Sodom? Here the Lambe of God is not set before us to look upon, but to be tasted and eaten.2. Chr. 26.16.19. 
                     Vzziah coming inconsiderately unto the ark of the covenant, was by the Lord suddenly smitten with a leprosie: What wonder is it then,1. Cor. 11.27.29. if he that eats of this bread, and drinks of this wine unworthily, eateth and drinketh his own condemnation? For here is the true ark of the new covenant, which was prefigured by the old. Now the apostle teacheth true preparation in one word:1. Cor. 11.28. 
                     Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread. Now as all divine examination is to be squared according to the rule of divine scripture, so also is this, which Paul requires. Let us therefore consider

in the first place our own infirmitie: For what is man?Gen. 18.27. 
                     Dust and ashes. We were made of the earth, we live of the earth, and we return to the earth.
                  What is man? Stinking seed,
                        Bernard
                      a sack of dung, and meat for worms. Man was born to labour, and not to honour. Man is born of a woman, and therefore with guiltinesse: He liveth but a short time, and therefore in fear: he is full of many miseries, and therefore of weeping: many indeed, because both of body and soul. Man knoweth neither his beginning nor his end. We have our being for a while like a fading flower: But this short life hath long sorrows and labours. Let us consider in the second place our unworthinesse: Verily, every creature in respect of the Creatour, is a shadow, a dream, nothing: Therefore man also. But man is unworthy in a greater and more grievous manner: For he offended his Creatour by his sinne. God is just by nature and by essence: Therefore by his nature and by his essence he is offended and displeased with sinne.

What are we stubble to that consuming fire?
                     Deut. 4.24 How shall our most filthy deeds appear? How shall our iniquities which thou settest before thee,
                     Psal. 90.8 
                     and our errours which thou placest in the light of thy countenance? God is infinite, and alwayes like himself, of infinite justice and infinite anger: And if in all his works, then certainly in his anger, justice, and revenge, God is altogether great and wonderfull. He that spared not his own Sonne,
                     Rom. 8.32 will he spare his own workmanship? He that spared not the most holy one, will he spare the wicked servant? God so hateth sinne, that he doth punish it even in the best beloved; as it appears by Lucifer the prince of the angels. But let not this examination respect us onely, but the blessed bread also, which is the communication of the Lords bodie: Then shall the true fountain of grace, and the inexhaustible spring of mercie appear. God cannot altogether neglect us, seeing that he maketh us partakers of his own flesh:Ephes. 5.29. 
                     For who ever hated his own flesh? Therefore this holy banquet shall transform

our souls: This most divine banquet shall make us divine men; untill at length we be made partakers of future happinesse,
                        Nazian.
                      being made capable of God wholly and onely, and wholly like unto God. What we have here by faith, and in a mystery, there we shall have in deed, and openly: Yea our bodies have attained to this dignitie, that in them we shall see God face to face: I say our bodies,1. Cor. 13.12. which are now the temples of the holy Ghost, and are sanctified and quickned by the body and bloud of Christ dwelling in us. This most holy medicine cures all the wounds of sinne: This quickning flesh overcometh all mortall sinne: This is the most holy seal of divine promises, which we may shew before Gods judgement. Having this pledge we may glory, and be secure of eternall life. If Christ his bodie and bloud be exhibited unto us, assuredly all other benefits by that most holy body and most blessed bloud are prepared for us: How can he that hath given us the greater things, denie us the lesse? He that hath given his Sonne to us,
                     John 3.16

                     Let the spouse therefore be glad and rejoyce; for the time is at hand when she shall be called to the marriage of the Lambe: Let her put on precious apparel, let her put on her wedding garment,
                     Matth. 22.12. that she be not found naked. This garment is the bridegrooms righteousnes, which we put on in baptisme: But our righteousnesse is so farre from being a wedding garment,, that it is as the cloth of a menstruous woman.
                     Isa. 64.6. Let us be afraid therefore to bring the most filthy and stinking rags of our works to this nuptiall solemnitie. Let the Lord cover us,

                     Meditat. XXI. Of Christs ascension.
                  
                     Christ is ascended up on high:
                     And we must up like eagles flie.
                  
                  MEditate upon thy bridegrooms ascension, thou faithfull soul: For Christ withdrew his visible presence from the faithfull, to exercise

their faith: And blessed are they that see not, and yet beleeve.
                     John. 20.29. Mat. 6.21. 
                     Where our treasure is, there let our heart be also: Christ our treasure is in heaven: Let our hearts therefore be set upon those things that are heavenly,
                     Col. 3.2. and meditate upon the things that be above. The spouse desires with most earnest sighs the return of her beloved: So let the faithfull soul desire the coming of that day, when she shall be admitted to the marriage of the Lambe:Rev. 10.7. Let her put her confidence in the pledge of the holy Spirit, which the Lord left unto her at his departure: Let her put her confidence in the bodie and bloud of the Lord, which she receives in the mysterie of the supper: And let her beleeve that our bodies which are filled with this incorruptible food, shall at length be raised up again. That which we now beleeve, we shall then see: Our hope shall then be reall fruition: The Lord is present unto us here, while we are on the way, in a strange shape: But in the mansion of our heavenly countrey we shall behold him and know him as he is. It was our Saviours

The mount doth call and invite us to heavenly things: seeing therefore we cannot follow him with our bodily feet, let us follow him with the fee

                     Exod. 19.3. Joh. 4.20. Gen. 13.11, 12. 
                     The holy patriarchs worshipped in the mount. Abraham made choice of the mount, and Lot of the plain: Let the faithfull soul leave the plain of this world, and by holy devotion go up to the heavenly mount: So shall she feel God speaking unto her inwardly, and that most sweetly: So in her prayers may she worship in spirit:
                     Joh. 4.24. So shall she be able with Abraham to escape the everlasting fire prepared

For the plain of this world. Bethanie signifieth a village of humilitie and affliction, by which we must passe to the kingdome of heaven, even as Christ himself passed from the place of affliction to the joyes of heaven. Till this time heaven was shut, and paradise, which is above, was kept by a flaming sword:
                     Gen. 3.24. But now Christ being conquerour doth set open heaven unto us, to shew us the way into our heavenly countrey, from which we had fallen away. The disciples stood lifting up their eyes, and looking up towards heaven:
                     Acts 1.11. So let the true disciples of Christ lift up the eyes of their heart to behold heavenly things.

                      Lord Jesus what a glorious clause followed thy passion! How happie and sudden a change is this! How did I see thee suffering on mount Calvarie, and how do I behold thee now in the mount of Olives! There thou wast alone; here thou art accompanied with many thousands of angels: There thou didst ascend up to the crosse; here thou dost ascend up into heaven in a cloud: There thou wast crucified between

Where our flesh doth reigne, there let us beleeve that we shall also reigne: Where our bloud doth rule, let us hope that we shall also obtain glorie: Though our sinnes do hinder us, yet the communion of nature doth not repell us: Where the head is, there shall the other members be also: Our head is entred into heaven: Therefore the members have just cause to hope for entrance, not onely so, but that they have possession there already.
                        Eusebius.
                      Christ descended from heaven to redeem us; and again he ascended up into heaven to glorifie us. Unto us was he born, for us did he suffer: For us therefore did he

ascend.
                        Bernard.
                      Our charitie is confirmed by Christs passion, our faith by Christs resurrection, our hope by Christs ascension. We must follow Christ our bridegroom not onely with our ardent desires, but also with our good works. Into that citie which is above, nothing shall enter that is defiled:
                     Rev. 21.27. In token of this the angels that came from the heavenly Jerusalem appeared in white apparel;Acts 1.10 by which puritie and innocencie is figured.
                        Eusebius.
                      With the Doctour of humilitie there ascended no pride; with the Authour of goodnesse there ascended no malice; with the Lover of peace there ascended no discord; and with the Sonne of the Virgin there ascended no lust. After the Parent of vertues there ascend no vices; after the Just there ascend no sinnes; and after the Physician there can ascend no infirmities. He that desires to see God hereafter face to face, let him here so live as in his sight. He that hopes for celestiall things, let him contemn terrestriall. O draw our hearts thee, good Jesus!
               
               
                  
                  
                     Meditat. XXII. An Homilie of the holy Ghost.
                  
                     God sealeth by his holy Spirit
                     As many as shall life inherit.
                  
                  OUr Lord ascending up into the heavens, and entring into his glory,Acts 2.4. sent the holy Ghost unto the disciples upon the day of Pentecost. As in the old Testament God when he proclaimed the law in mount Sinai,
                     Exod. 19.11. 
                     came down unto Moses: So when the gospel was by the apostles to be propagated throughout all the world, the holy Ghost came down upon them. There, was thundering and lightning, and the loud sound of the trumpet; because the law doth thunder against our disobedience, and makes us subject to Gods indignation: But here, is the sound of a gentle winde; for the preaching of the gospel doth lift up the souls that are cast down: There, was the fear and trembling of all the people; because the law worketh wrath:
                     Rom. 4.15 But here, the whole multitude doth flock

together to heare the wonderfull things of God; for by the gospel we have accesse unto God: There, the Lord descended in fire, but it was in the fire of his wrath and furie; therefore was the mountain moved, and did smoke: But here, the holy Ghost descendeth in the fire of love, so that all the house is not shaken by the wrath of God, but is rather replenished with the glory of the holy Ghost. What wonder is it if the holy Ghost be sent from the court of heaven to sanctifie us, seeing that the Sonne was sent to redeem us? The passion of Christ had not profited us, unlesse by the gospel it had been preached unto us; For what use is there of a treasure that is hid? Therefore our most mercifull Father did not onely prepare a great benefit by the passion of his Sonne, but also would have it offered to all the world by sending the holy Ghost. The faithfull mother giveth unto her tender infant both her dugs. God who is faithfull doth send unto us both the Sonne and the holy Ghost. But the holy Ghost came upon the

apostles, when they were assembled together at prayer with one accord:Acts 2.1. Zech. 12.10. For he is the Spirit of prayer, he i
                        •
                      obtained by prayer, and he moveth us to pray. Wherefore? Because he is that bond by which our hearts are united with God, as he doth unite the Father with the Sonne, and the Sonne with the Father: For he is the mutuall substantiall love of the Father and the Sonne. This our spirituall conjunction with God is wrought by faith: But faith is the gift of the Spirit. It is obtained by prayer: But true prayer is made in the Spirit. In the temple of Solomon, when incense was offered unto God,1. King▪ 8.11. 
                     the temple was filled with the glory of the Lord: So if thou offerest unto God the sweet odours of prayers, the holy Ghost shall fill the temple of thy heart with glory. Let us here admire the mercy and grace of God: The Father promiseth to heare our prayers,Psal. 50.15. Rom. 8.34 Gal. 4.6. Austine.
                      the Sonne maketh intercession for us, and the holy Ghost prayeth in us. The angels carrie our prayers unto God, and the court of heaven is

open to receive our prayers. God of his mercie doth give unto us the affect of prayer; because he giveth unto us the spirit of grace and prayer: He giveth unto us also the effect of prayer; because he doth alwayes heare our prayers, if not according to our will, yet according to that which is most profitable for us. The holy Ghost came when they were all met together with one accord in the same place.
                     Acts 2.1. For he is the Spirit of love and concord that joyneth us unto Christ by faith, unto God by love, and unto our neighbour by charitie. The devil is the authour of discord and separation: by our sinnes he separates us from God; by hatred, contention, and brawling, he separates men one from another: But the holy Ghost as in Christ he hath conjoyned the divine and humane nature, by his wonderfull overshadowing:
                     Luk. 1.35. So doth he by his gifts poured upon us, conjoyn men with God, and God with men. As long as the holy Ghost remaineth in man by his grace and gifts, so long doth man remain united to God. As soon as man

by sinne falleth from faith and love, and shaketh off the holy Ghost, he is separated from God, and is deprived of that most blessed union. He that hath the holy Ghost hateth not his brother. Why? Because by the Spirit he is made partaker of the mysticall bodie of Christ, whose members all the godly are:Eph. 5.29. And who ever hated his own members? Yea more, He that is governed by the Spirit of the Lord, loveth even his enemies. Why?1. Cor. 6.17. Because he that cleaveth unto the Lord, becomes one spirit with him: And God causeth his sunne to rise upon the good and bad:
                     Mat. 5.45. Wisd. 11.2
                           •
                        
                        ▪
                      
                     And hateth nothing which he hath made: He that hath the Spirit of God is readie to be servant unto all, he to his power doeth good unto all, he is readie for all to make use of, because God is the fountain of all mercie and grace to all. Now the Spirit of God effects in man such motions as he himself is: As the soul gives unto the body life, sense, and motion: So the Spirit makes man spirituall, seasons his minde with divine saltnesse, and directs all his members to the

performance of all duties towards God, and towards his neighbour. From heaven came that sound which was the signe of the coming of the holy Ghost: Because the holy Ghost is of an heavenly nature, to wit, of the same nature with the Father and the Sonne; from whom, that is, the Father and the Sonne, he proceedeth from all eternitie. Moreover, he maketh men to think upon heavenly things, and to seek those things which are above. He which cleaveth unto earthly things, and is by his love united unto the world, is not yet made partaker of the heavenly Spirit. He came in the type of breath:
                        Ambrose.
                      Because he affordeth unto the afflicted quickning consolation; and because we live according to the flesh by the reciprocall breathing out and sucking in of the aeriall spirit. He came under the type of spirit and breath: For he giveth unto us, To live according to our better part. The winde bloweth where it listeth,
                     John 3.8. 
                     and thou hearest the sound thereof, but thou knowest not whence it comes, or whither it goes: So is every one that

is begotten of the Spirit. And it was meet that he should come in the type of breath: Because he proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne by one breathing from eternitie. It was a powerfull breath: Because the grace of the holy Ghost comes with power. The holy Ghost moveth the godly, in whom he dwelleth, to all that is good; and so moveth them, that they regard neither the threats of tyrants, nor the treacheries of Satan, nor the hatred of the world: He conferreth upon the apostles the gift of tongues:Psal. 19.24. Because their sound was to go into all lands: And so the confusion of tongues (which was the punishment of pride and rashnesse in the building of the tower of Babel) was taken away;Gen. 11.7· and the dispersed nations, by the gift of the holy Ghost, through diverse tongues were gathered together into the unitie of faith. It was meet that he should come in the figure of tongues: Because the holy men of God did speak as they were inspired by him;2. Pet. 1.21 Because he spake by the apostles; and because he putteth the words of God into the mouthes

of the ministers of the church. For these so great gifts blessed and praised be the holy Ghost together with the Father and the Sonne for ever and ever!

                     One is my beloved, saith the bridegroom in the Canticles: One indeed; because there is but one true and orthodox church, the beloved spouse of Christ. Without the body of Christ there is not the Spirit of Christ,Rom. 8.9. and he that hath not the Spirit of Christ is not his; and he that is not Christs, cannot be made partaker of life everlasting. All that were without the ark of Noah did perish in the floud:Gen. 7.21. And they that are without the spirituall ark of the church, must needs be

overwhelmed in everlasting destruction.

Consider, thou devout soul, that every day many thousands of souls descend into hell for this cause, because they are without the bosome of the church. Nature hath not separated thee from them, but onely the grace of God that sheweth mercie. When Egypt was involved in palpable darknesse,
                     Exod. 10.21. the Israelites onely had light: So in the church onely is the light of divine knowledge. They that are without the church, do passe from the darknesse of ignorance in this present life, to the darknesse of eternall damnation in the life to come.

                      He that is not a part of the militant church, shall never be a part of the church triumphant: For these things following have a neare conjunction together, that is to say, God, the word, faith, Christ, the church, and life everlasting. The holy church of God is a mother, a virgin, and a spouse. She is a mother: Because she brings forth spirituall

sonnes unto God every day. She is a virgin: Because she doth keep her self chaste from the embracements of the devil and the world. She is a spouse: Because Christ hath betrothed her unto himself by an everlasting covenant, and hath given unto her the pledge of the Spirit.Mat. 8.23. Chrysost. upon Mat. The church is that ship that carries Christ and his disciples, and brings them at length to the haven of everlasting felicitie: The church sails through the sea of this world with a prosperous course, having the stern of faith, God for her pilot, and the angels for her rowers, and carrying the companies of all the saints: In the midst thereof there is erected the saving tree of the crosse, upon which do hang the sails of evangelicall faith, by which she is carried to the securitie of eternall rest, by the breathing of the holy Ghost.Mat. 21 33 The church is that vineyard that God hath planted in the field of this world, which he hath watered with his bloud, about which he hath set an hedge of angelicall guard,Isa. 5.2. in which he hath made the winepresse

                         feet: Because she despiseth earthly things that are subject to sundry changes. Consider, thou devout soul, the exceeding great dignitie of the church, and render due thanks unto God. Great are the benefits which are in the church of God, but all do not meet with them. It is a garden enclosed,
                     Can. 4.12. and a fountain sealed up: No man sees the beautie of this enclosed garden, but he that is in it: Neither doth any one know the benefits that are in the church, but he that is himself in it. This spouse of Christ is black without,Can. 1.5. Psal. 45.13 but beautifull within. For the kings daughter is all glorious within. This ship is tossed with many tempests of persecutions:Matt. 8.24 This vineyard being bound doth rise up, and being cut down groweth up. For this woman the infernall Dragon lieth in wait after diverse manners.Rev. 12.

church is a fair lilie:
                     Cant. 2.2. Ambrose.
                      But yet among thorns. The church is a most beautifull garden: But when the Northwinde of tribulations doth blow upon it, the spices thereof fall. The church is Gods daughter: But she is exceedingly hated of the world: She looks for an heavenly inheritance: and therefore she is compelled to be a pilgrime in this world. In this pilgrimage she is oppressed, in her pressure she is silent, in her silence she is strong, in her strength she overcometh. The church is a spirituall mother: But she is compelled to stand under the crosse with Mary the mother of Christ.
                     John. 19.25. The church is a palmtree: Because under the weight of tribulations and tentations she grows most. Consider, thou devout soul, the dignitie of the church: And beware thou commit nothing to her dishonour. The church is thy mother: Take heed therefore that thou contemn not her voice. She is thy mother: Therefore thou must alwayes hang upon her breasts. The breasts of the church are the Word and the Sacraments. The church is a virgin:

If therefore thou art her true sonne, abstain from the worlds embracements. Thou art a member of the virgin the church: See therefore that thou prostitute not the virgins members, and so commit fornication with the devil, by sinne. The church is the spouse of Christ, and so is every devout soul: Let her beware therefore that she cleave not unto Satan. Thou art the spouse of Christ: See thou lose not the earnest of the holy Spirit which he hath given thee. Thou art the spouse of Christ: Pray continually that the bridegroom would make haste, and lead thee in unto the celestiall marriage. But the bridegroom will come in the night of securitie:Matt. 25.13. 
                     Watch therefore, lest when he cometh he finde thee sleeping, and so shut thee out of the gate of eternall salvation. Let the oyl of thy faith shine, lest at the coming of the bridegroom thou beest constrained to desire it in vain. Thou art carried in the ship: See therefore that thou dost not throw thy self headlong into the sea of the world before thou comest to the haven: Thou art carried

in the ship: pray that thou beest not swallowed up by the tempests of afflictions, and waves of tentations. Thou art called into the Lords vineyard:
                     Matt. 20.1 See that thou labourest stoutly: Think upon the penie, and not upon the dayes labour. Thou art the Lords vineyard: Cast away all unprofitable branches, that is, the unfruitfull works of the flesh, and think the whole time of thy life to be the time of pruning. Thou art a vine-branch in Christ the true vine: See that thou dost remain in him, and bring forth much fruit: Because the heavenly husbandman will take away every branch that bringeth not forth fruit,
                     John 15.2 
                     and purge that which bringeth forth fruit, that it may bring forth more fruit. Thou hast put on Christ by faith,Gal. 3.27. and art clothed with this sunne of righteousnesse: See then that thou treadest the moon, that is,Mal. 4.2. Rev. 12.1. all earthly things under thy feet: And esteem all other things little worth in respect of eternall goods. O good Jesus, thou that hast brought us into the church militant, bring us at length also into the church triumphant▪
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     Meditat. XXIIII. Of Predestination.
                  
                     In Christ we are by God elect,
                     Without Christ God doth all reject.
                  
                  O Devout soul, as often as thou wilt meditate upon thy predestination, behold Christ hanging upon the crosse,Rom. 4.25 
                     dying for the sinnes of the whole world, and rising again for our justification.
                     
                        Austine.
                      Begin from Christ lying in the manger, and so thy disputation of predestination shall proceed orderly.Eph. 1.4. 
                     God elected us before the foundations of the world were laid; but yet he elected us in Christ: If therefore thou art in Christ by faith, do not doubt but that election belongeth unto thee: If with a firm confidence of heart thou adherest unto Christ, do not doubt but that thou art in the number of the elect. But if thou goest further beyond the limits of the word, and wilt search into the profunditie of predestination, it is greatly to be feared that thou

wilt fall into the profunditie of desperation. Without Christ God is a consuming fire:
                     Deut. 4.24 Take heed therefore of coming too neare this fire, lest thou beest consumed. Without Christs satisfaction, God by the voice of his law accuseth all, and condemneth all: Take heed therefore that thou drawest not the mysterie of predestination out of the law. Search not into the reasons of Gods counsels, lest thy cogitations do much seduce thee. God dwelleth in light that no man can attain unto:
                     1. Tim. 
                           •
                        .16. Presume not therefore to come unto it rashly: But God hath revealed unto us the light of his gospel; and in this thou mayest safely inquire into the doctrine of this secret; and in this light thou shalt see true light.
                     Psal. 36.9. Leave the profunditie of this eternall decree made from eternitie, and convert thy self to the clearnesse of the manifestation which was made in time. Justification made in time is the glasse of election made without time.
                        Luther.
                      Out of the law take notice of the wrath of God for sinne; and repent: out of the gospel take notice of the mercie

of God through Christ his merit, and apply that unto thy self by faith: Take notice of the nature of faith, and shew it by thy godly conversation: Take notice of Gods fatherly castigation in crosses, and endure through patience: And then at length begin to handle the doctrine of predestination: This method the apostle teacheth: This method let him that is the apostles disciple, follow. There are three things alwayes to be observed in this mysterie: The mercie of God loving us, the merit of Christ suffering for us, and the grace of the holy Ghost by the gospel sanctifying us. Gods mercie is universall; because he loved the whole world. The earth is full of the Lords mercy;
                     Psal. 33.5. yea his mercy is greater then heaven and earth: For it is as great as God is: For God is love. He hath witnessed by his word, that he will not the death of a sinner:
                     Ezek. 33.11. And if this be too little, he hath confirmed it with an oath: If thou canst not beleeve him for his promise,
                        ierome.
                      beleeve him for his oath. He is called the Father of mercies;2. Cor. 1.3 because it is his property to spare and

to have mercy.
                        Bernard.
                      The cause and originall of shewing mercie, he hath from himself; of condemning and punishing, from another: Insomuch that it may appear, that mercie and punishment proceed from him after a farre different manner. The merit of Christ also is universall; because he died for the sinnes of the whole world. What can then more plainly prove his mercie, then that he loved us, when as yet we were not? For it was his love that he created us. Moreover he loved us when we were turned away from him; For he sent his Sonne to be our redeemer. To the sinner adjudged to eternall torments, and not having wherewithall to redeem himself, the Father saith, Take my onely begotten Sonne, and give him for thee. The Sonne himself saith, Take away me, and redeem thy self.Cant. 2.1. Christ was a flower of the field, not a flower of the garden; because the odour of his grace is not shut up to some few, but laid open to all. Doubt not of the universalitie of Christs merit: Christ suffering, prayed for them that crucified

him; and poured forth his bloud for them, by whom it was poured forth. The promises of the gospel are universall; because Christ saith unto all, Come unto me all ye that labour.
                     Matt. 11.28. That which was performed for all, is also offered to all: As farre as thou travellest amongst these goods by the foot of trust and confidence, so much also shalt thou obtain. God denies his grace unto no man,
                        Bernard upon the Cant. but unto him that thinks himself unworthy of it. Consider therefore, thou faithfull soul, these three props of predestination, and rest upon them with the firm confidence of thy heart: Consider the benefits of Gods mercie that are past; and thou wilt not doubt of finall perseverance.
                        Bernard upon the 116 Psal. When as yet thou wast not, God created thee: When by the fall of Adam thou wast condemned, he redeemed thee: When thou livedst in the world out of the church, he called thee: When thou wast ignorant, he instructed thee: When thou wentst astray, he redeemed thee: When thou sinnedst, he corrected thee, When thou stoodst, he upheld thee: When thou wast fallen, he lifted

thee up: When thou wentst, he led thee: When thou camest unto him, he received thee. His long-suffering appeared, in that he expected thee; and his mercie, in that he pardoned thee.Psal. 23.6. Gods mercie prevented thee: Hope firmly that it will also follow thee.

                      Gods mercie prevented thee, that thou mightest be healed; and it shall also follow thee, that thou mayest be glorified:
                        Savanar.
                      It prevented thee, that thou mightest live godly; it shall also follow thee, that thou mayest live with him for ever. How came it to passe that in thy fall thou wast not ground to pieces? Who put his hand under thee? Was it not the Lord? Be confident therefore hereafter in Gods mercie, and hope assuredly for the end of perfect faith, that is, eternall salvation.
                        Bernard upon the 31 Psal. In whose hands doth thy salvation consist more safe and certain, then in those which made both heaven and earth,
                     Isa. 66.2. those hands that are never shortned,
                     Isa. 59.1. those hands that do abound with the bowels of mercie, and those hands that have holes in them by which mercie may flow forth? But consider O devout

soul, that we were elected of God,Eph. 1.4. 
                     that we might be holy and blamelesse: Whosoever therefore studie not to live an holy life, to them belongs not the benefit of election. We were elected in Christ: In Christ we are by faith: Faith shews it self by love. Therefore where there is not love, neither is there faith; where there is not faith, neither is there Christ; where there is not Christ, neither is there election:2. Tim. 2.19. 
                     The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth who are his; But let him depart from unrighteousnesse, whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord: The sheep of Christ shall no man take out of his hand,
                     John 10.28. but yet let the sheep of Christ heare his voice.
                     27. 
                     We are Gods house;Heb. 3.6. But let us retain our confidence and the glory of hope firm, even unto the end. O Lord, thou that hast given us to will,
                     Phil. 2.13. give us also to perfect.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     Meditat. XXV. Of the saving efficacie of prayer.
                  
                     Our prayers do pierce the starrie skie,
                     And fetch down blessings from on high.
                  
                  IT is an exceeding great benefit of God towards us,
                        Austine.
                      in that he requires us to conferre with him familiarly by pious prayer: He bestoweth upon us the gift of prayer, and the fruit of prayer. Great is the force of prayer which is poured forth on earth, but hath its operation in heaven. The prayer of the righteous is the key of heaven: Prayer ascendeth, and deliverance descendeth from God: Prayer is a saving buckler, by which we repell all our adversaries darts.Ephes. 6.16. Exod. 17.11. Ambrose.
                      
                     When Moses stretched forth his hands, Israel prevailed against the Amalekites: If thou stretchest forth thy hands towards heaven, Satan shall not prevail against thee. As the enemie is kept off by the wall:
                        Hierome upon Ezek. So the anger of God is repelled by the prayers of the saints. Our Saviour himself prayed, not that he had any

need, but to commend unto us the dignitie thereof. Prayer is the tribute of our subjection: Because God hath commanded that we should every day offer unto him our prayers, as a spirituall tribute. It is the ladder of our ascension unto God: For prayer is nothing else but the souls travelling unto God.
                        Nazian.
                      It is the buckler of our defence: For the soul of him that continueth in prayer, is secure and safe from the assaults of the devil. It is our faithfull messenger unto God:
                        Bernard.
                      For it goeth up unto his throne, and solicits him to aid us. This messenger never returns in vain: For God alwayes heares our prayers, if not according to our will, yet to our profit and salvation. We may assuredly hope for one of these two: Either he will give us that we ask, or else that which he knoweth to be more profitable for us. God gave his own Sonne that most excellent gift, being not intreated: What will he do then if he be intreated? We cannot doubt of the Fathers hearing,Num. 7.89. or the Sonnes interceding: Upon all occasions thou mayest with

                     Moses by prayer enter into the tabernacle,
                     
                        Kempis.
                      and consult with God the Lord: And thou shalt speedily heare his divine answer. Christ was transfigured when he prayed:Luke 9.29 So in the time of prayer there are many changes wrought in the soul: For prayer is the light of the soul,
                        Bernard upon the Cant. and oftentimes leaves him in joy, whom she found in despair.
                        Chrysost.
                      With what face canst thou behold the sunne, unlesse thou dost first worship him, who sends that most pleasant light for thee to look upon? How canst thou at thy table fall to thy meat, unlesse thou dost first worship him, who in his bounty bestows it upon thee? With what hope darest thou commit thy self unto the darknesse of the night, unlesse thou dost first arm thy self by prayer? What fruit canst thou expect of thy labours, unlesse thou dost first worship him, without whose blessing all labour is unprofitable? If therefore thou wantest spirituall, or temporall blessings, ask and receive. If thou desirest Christ,Matt. 7.7. 
                     seek him by prayer, and thou shalt finde: If thou desirest that the gate of divine

grace, &amp; eternall salvation should be opened unto thee, Knock and it shall be opened unto thee.

Come unto the spirituall rock, which is Christ, come with devotion, and strike it with the rod of prayer, &amp; thou shalt feel the streams of divine grace cool the thirst of thy penurie.Exod. 17.6. Wouldest thou offer an acceptable sacrifice unto God? Offer thy prayers: so shall God smell a sweet odour,
                     Gen. 8.21 Cyprian.
                      and his wrath shall cease. Wouldest thou every day converse with God? Love prayer, which is the spirituall conference between God and the devout soul.Psal. 34.8. Wouldest thou taste how sweet the Lord is? Invite the Lord to the house of thy heart by prayer.
                        Anselm.
                      Prayer pleaseth God, if it be made in a due manner: Whosoever therefore desireth to be heard, let him pray with wisdome, with fervencie, with humilitie, with faith, with perseverance, &amp; with confidence: Let him pray with wisdome, that is, for such things as tend to the glory of God, and the salvation of his neighbour. God is omnipotent:

Therefore do not thou in thy prayers tie him to means. God is most wise: Therefore do not thou in thy prayers prescribe him an order. Let not thy prayers break forth rashly, but let them follow the conduct of faith: Now faith hath respect unto the word: Therefore such things as God hath promised in his word absolutely, pray for absolutely: and such things as he hath promised with a condition, as temporall things, pray for with a condition: and such things as he hath in no wise promised, in no wise pray for.
                        Bernard.
                      God oftentimes gives in his wrath, that which in his mercy he doth denie: Therefore follow Christ who resigned his will wholly unto God. Pray with fervencie: For how canst thou desire that God should heare thee, when thou hearest not thy self? Wouldest thou have God mindfull of thee, when thou art not mindfull of thy self? When thou wilt pray,
                     Mat. 6.6. 
                     go into thy closet, and shut thy doore. Thy heart is the closet,
                        Austine.
                      thou must enter into it: If thou wilt pray as thou oughtest, thou must shut the doore, that

the cogitations of worldly businesse may not trouble thee. Thy words come not unto Gods eares without the affection of the heart: The minde must be so inflamed with the heat of cogitation, that it may farre surpasse what the tongue expresseth: And this is to worship in spirit and in truth,
                     Joh. 4.23. as the Lord requireth: Christ prayed in the mount,
                     Luk. 6.12. and lifted up his eyes unto heaven:
                     Joh. 17.1. So we must turn away our mindes from all the creatures, and turn them unto God. Thou doest injurie unto God, if thou prayest unto him to attend unto thee, when thou dost not attend unto thy self.

There is not alwayes need of clamour; because God heareth even the sighs of our hearts, seeing that he dwelleth in the hearts of the godly. There is not alwayes need of words; because he is present even with the thoughts. Oftentimes one sigh moved by the holy Ghost, and offered to God in the spirit, is more acceptable to God then long

repetitions of prayers, where the tongue prayeth, and the heart is plainly d

                      Let him pray with humilitie, and place no confidence in his own merit, but in the grace of God onely. If our prayers relie upon our own worth, they are condemned, yea though the heart for very devotion should sweat drops of bloud. No man pleaseth God but in Christ: Therefore no man prayeth aright but through Christ and in Christ. The sacrifices did not please God, which were not offered on the onely altar of the tabernacle: So prayer pleaseth not God, unlesse it be offered upon the onely altar, which is Christ. God promised to heare the Israelites prayers, if they prayed with their faces turned toward Jerusalem:1. King. 8. So we in our prayers must convert our selves unto Christ, who is the temple of the divinitie. Christ at his passion being about to pray, cast himself to the ground: Behold how that most holy soul humbled it self before the divine majestie!Mar. 14.35 Let him pray with faith,
                        Anselm.
                      let him offer himself to want all joy, and to suffer all punishment.

The sooner one prayeth, the more profitably; the oftner, the better; the more fervently, the more acceptably with God.

So then all the court of heaven doth as it were serve us, &amp; convey their ben
                        •
                     fits unto us. I do not wonder now that all the inferiour creatures were made for man,Psal. 34.7. seeing that the angels themselves, creatures farre more excellent, do not deny their ministerie unto us. What wonder is it that the heaven ministers light unto us by day, that we may labour, and darknesse by night, that we may rest, seeing that those that dwell in heaven do minister unto us? What wonder is it that the aire affordeth us vitall breath, and all kindes of fowls to our service, seeing that the celestiall spirits watch over us for our safety? What wonder is it that the water affordeth us drink, purgeth away our filth, watereth things that are dried, and brings forth sundry kindes of fishes, when as the angels themselves are present with us, and do refresh us, when we are weary with the heat of calamities and tentations? What wonder that the earth beareth us, and nourisheth us with bread and wine, and furnisheth our tables with all kindes of fruits, and living creatures,

when as he hath given his angels charge to keep us in all our wayes,
                     Psal. 91.11. and to bear us up in their hands,
                     12. 
                     that we dash not our foot against a stone. The angels were solicitous concerning Christ.Luk. 1.31 Luk. 2.10. For an angel foretells his conception: An angel declares his nativitie: An angel bids him flee into Egypt:
                     Mat. 2.13. Mat. 4.11. Luk. 22.43. The angels minister unto him in the desert: The angels minister unto him in the whole ministerie of his preaching: An angel is present with him at the agonie of death: An angel appeares at his resurrection:44. Mat. 28.2. Act. 1.10. The angels are present at his ascension: The angels shall be with him when he returns to judgement.Mat. 24.31. So then, as the angels waited upon Christ in the dayes of his flesh, so also are they solicitous for all them that are incorporated into Christ by faith. As they served the head, so do they also serve the members: They rejoyce to serve them on earth, whom they shall have their companions in heaven. They do not deny their ministerie unto them, whose most sweet fellowship they hope for hereafter.Gen. 32.1. 
                     The angels of God appeared to Jacob in the

way to his countrey: So in this life, which is the way to our heavenly countrey, the angels are the keepers of the godly. The angels defended Daniel in the midst of the lions:
                     Dan. 6.22. So likewise they defend all the godly from the treacheries of the infernall Lion. The angels preserved Lot from the fire of Sodom:Gen. 19.16. So by holy inspirations and protections against the devils tentations they often preserve us from the fire of hell:Luk 16.22. The angels carry the soul of Lazarus into Abrahams bosome: And so they translate the souls of the elect unto the palace of the heavenly kingdome. The angel leads Peter out of prison:Act. 12.7 And so he doth often deliver the godly out of most apparent dangers. Great is the power of our adversarie the devil: But let the guard of the angels lift us up.
                        Hierome.
                      Doubt not but these will be present to aid thee in all dangers; because the Scripture describeth them with wings,
                     Exod. 25.20. Isa. 6.2. under the figure of Cherubim and Seraphim, that thou mayst know assuredly, that they will come with incredible celeritie to bring aid and succour.
                        Bernard.
                      Do not doubt but these

will be thy protectours in all places; because they are most subtile spirits which no body can resist: All visible things give way unto them, and all bodies alike, though they be solid and thick, by them are penetrable and passable. Do not doubt but these spirits know thy dangers and afflictions;M

                        t. 18.10. because they alwayes behold the face of thy heavenly Father, and are alwayes ready prest for his service. Know also, thou devout soul, that these angels are holy: Therefore study for holinesse, if thou wouldest enjoy their fellowship. Likenesse of conditions doth most beget friendship: Accustome thy self therefore to holy actions, if thou desirest to have the angels to be thy keepers. In every place and angle stand in awe and reverence of thy angel, and do nothing in his presence which thou wouldest be ashamed to do in the sight of man. These angels are chaste:
                        Basil.
                      Therefore they are driven away by filthy actions: Smoak drives away bees, and an ill savour drives away doves: So, lamentable and stinking sinne drives away the angels the keepers of our

life. If by sinne thou deprivest thy self of their tuition: How canst thou be safe from the devils treacheries? If thou beest destitute of the angels protection: How canst thou be safe from the invasio
                        •
                      of many dangers? If thy soul be not fenced by the wall of the angels defence: the devil will easily overcome it by his deceitfull perswasion.Heb. 1.14. The holy angels are sent by God as his messengers to us:
                        Luther.
                      Therefore thou must be reconciled unto God by faith, if thou wilt have an angel to be thy keeper. Where the grace of God is not, neither is there the guard of angels: Let us behold the angels as Gods saving hands, which are moved to no work without his direction. There is joy in heaven before the angels over one sinner that repenteth. The teares of the penitent are as it were the wine of the angels: But an impenitent heart puts to flight the angels our keepers. Let us therefore repent, that we may cause the angels to rejoyce. The angels are of an heavenly and spirituall nature: Let us therefore think upon heavenly and spirituall

things that they may take pleasure to be with us. The angels are humble and hate pride altogether; because they are not ashamed to tend little children: Why then is earth and ashes proud,
                     Ecclus. 10.9. when the heavenly spirits so humble themselves? At death especially the devils subtiltie is to be feared, because it is written that the serpent lieth in wait for the heel.
                     Gen. 3.15 The heel, which is the extreme part of the bodie, is the last term of our life. In that last agonie of death, the angels guard is most necessary; that they may deliver us from the fierie darts of the devil, and carry our soul when it is gone out of the prison of our bodie, into the heavenly paradise. When Zacharie was in the temple busie about his holy function, the angel of the Lord came unto him:Luk. 1.11. So likewise if thou delightest in the exercise of the word and prayer, thou mayst rejoyce to have the angels thy protectours. O most mercifull God, thou that leadest us through the desert of this world by the conduct of the holy angels, grant that we may at length be carried

by them into the kingdome of heaven!

                  COnsider, thou devout soul, in what danger thou art, because the devil thine adversarie is alwayes lying in wait for thee. He is an enemie, for boldnesse, most ready;
                        Lactant.
                      for strength, most powerfull; for subtiltie, most cunning; for engines, well stored; in fight indefatigable; into all shapes changeable: He enticeth us into many sinnes, and having enticed us he accuseth us before Gods judgement seat. He accuseth God to men,
                        Chrysost.
                      and men to God, and men one to another.

                      He exactly considers every ones naturall inclination; and then he layes for them the snares of tentations. As in the besieging of cities the besiegers come not against the strong and fortified places, but where they finde the walls weak,

the ditches plain, and the turrets without guard: So the devil when he assaults the soul of man, first sets upon that part which he findes softest, and best affected for him the easier to work upon: If he be once overcome, he doth not presently remove, but comes again to tempt with greater force; that so he may by tediousnesse and neglect overcome those whom by violence of tentations he could not overcome. Against whom will he not use his subtile tricks, when he was so bold as to set upon the Lord of majestie himself with his craft and subtiltie?Matt. 4.3. What Christian will he spare,Luk. 22.31. when he sought to winnow Christs apostles themselves like wheat? He deceived Adam in his nature instructed:Gen. 3.4. Whom cannot he deceive in his nature corrupted? He deceived Iudas in the school of our Saviour: And whom will he not deceive in the world the school of errour? In all states the devils treacheries are much to be feared. In prosperitie he lifts us up with pride: In adversitie he drives us to despair: If he sees a man delighted with frugalitie, he entangleth

him in the fetters of unsatiable covetousnesse: If he sees a man of an heroicall spirit, he sets him on fire with flaming anger: If he sees a man somewhat merrier then ordinary, he incites him to burn with lust: Those whom he sees to be zealous in religion, he labours to entangle in vain superstition: Those whom he sees exalted to dignities, he pricks them forward with the spurres of ambition. When he allureth a man to sinne, he amplifies Gods mercie; and when he hath cast him headlong into sinne, he amplifies Gods justice: First he will leade a man to presumption▪ and afterwards he labours to bring him to desperation.
                        Bernard.
                      Sometimes he assaults outwardly by persecutions; sometimes he assaults inwardly by fiery tentations: Sometimes he sets upon us openly, and by force; sometimes secretly, and by fraud. In eating he sets before us gluttony; in generating,
                        Austine.
                      luxurie; in exercising, sluggishnesse; in conversing, envie; in governing, covetousnesse; in correcting, anger; in dignitie, pride: In the heart he sets evil cogitations; In the mouth, false

speakings; In the other members wicked actions: When we are awake, he moves us to ill works; when we are asleep, he moves us to filthy dreams. So then in every place and in every thing we must beware of the devils treacheries. We sleep, but he watcheth: We are secure, and he goes about like a roaring lion.
                     1. Pet. 5.8. If thou shouldest see a lion ready to assault thee; how wouldest thou fear and tremble! When thou hearest that the infernall lion lies in wait for thee; doest thou sleep soundly on both eares? Consider therefore, thou faithfull soul, the treacheries of this most potent enemie, and seek the aid of spirituall arms:Eph. 6.14. Let thy loyns be girt with the girdle of truth, and covered with the breast-plate of righteousnesse: Put on Christs perfect righteousnesse; and thou shalt then be safe from the devils tentations. Hide thy self in the holes of Christs wounds,Can. 2.14. as often as thou art terrified by the darts of this malignant serpent. The true beleever is in Christ: as therefore Satan hath no power over Christ,Joh. 14.30 so hath he no power over the

true beleever. Let thy feet be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
                     Eph. 6.15. Let our confession of Christ be alwayes heard in our mouthes: So no tentations of the devil shall hurt us. The words of the enchanter do not so drive away the corporall serpent, as the voice of constant confession doth put to flight this spirituall serpent. Take the shield of faith, to quench all the fiery darts of this most wicked enemie.Eph. 6.16. 
                     Faith removes mountains;Mat. 17.20 understand the mountains of doubts, persecutions and tentations. The Israelites whose doore-posts were signed with the bloud of the paschall Lambe,Ex. 12.13. were not smitten by the destroying angel: So likewise those whose hearts are by faith sprinkled with the bloud of Christ, shall not be hurt by this destroyer. Faith relies upon Gods promises: Now Satan cannot overthrow Gods promises: Therefore Satan cannot prevail against faith. Faith is the light of the soul, and the tentations of the malignant spirit do soon appeare through this light. By faith our sinnes are thrown into the profoundMic. 7.19.

                      Endure tentation, and expect an issue out of the tentation: For God is the moderator of them that contend, and the crown of them that overcome. If there be no enemie, then no fight;

                      if no fight, no victorie; if no victorie, no crown. Better is that fight that brings us nearer to God, then that peace which alienateth us from God. We must also take the sword of the Spirit, that is, the word of God.

                     He's onely wise who God doth know,

                  EVery day thou drawest nearer to thy death, judgement, and eternitie: Therefore think every day how thou mayst be able to stand in that most strict and severe judgement, and so live for ever. Look diligently unto thy thoughts, words,Eccles. 12.14. and deeds, because hereafter thou must give an exact account for all thy thoughts, words, and deeds. Every evening think that thou shalt die that night: Every morning think that thou shalt die that day. Do not deferre thy conversion and good works till to morrow; because to morrow is uncertain, but death is certain, and hangs over thy head every day. Nothing is more contrary

to godlinesse then delay: If thou contemnest the inward calling of the holy Spirit, thou shalt never attain to true conversion.Ecclus 18.22. Deferre not thy conversion and good works till thy old age; but offer unto God the flower of thy youth. It is uncertain whether the young man shall live till he be old: But it is certain that destruction is prepared for the young man which is impenitent. No age is fitter for Gods service, then youth which flourisheth in strength both of body and minde. For no mans sake undertake an evil cause; for it is not that man but God that shall hereafter judge thee. Do not therefore preferre the favour of men before the grace of God. In the way of the Lord either we go forwards, or else we go backwards: Therefore examine thy life every day whether thou goest forwards or backwards in the study of pietie. To stand in the way of the Lord, is to go back: Do not delight then to stand still in the course of godlinesse; but study alwayes to walk in the way of the Lord.

Alwayes think upon three things to come: Death, then which nothing is more horrible; judgement, then which nothing is more terrible; the pains of hell, then which nothing is more intolerable. Let thy evening prayers amend the sinnes of the day past. Let the last

day of the week amend the faults of the dayes past. In the evening think how many are plunged that day into hell; and give thanks unto God for granting thee time to repent. There are three things above thee, which never let slip out of thy memorie: The eye that sees all, the eare that heares all, and the book wherein all things are written.
                        Bernard.
                      God hath communicated himself wholly unto thee; Communicate thou thy self wholly unto thy neighbour. That is the best life which is busied in the service of others: Shew obedience and reverence to thy superiour, give counsel and aid to thy equall, defend and instruct thy inferiour. Let thy bodie be subject to thy minde, and thy minde to God. Bewail thy evils past, and esteem not the goods that are present, and desire with all thy heart the goods which are future.
                        Petrarch.
                      Remember thy sinne, to grieve for it: Remember death, that thou mayst cease from sinne: Remember Gods justice, that thou mayst be kept in fear: Remember Gods mercie, that thou mayst not despair.
                        Bernard.
                      As much as thou

canst, withdraw thy self from the world, and addict thy self wholly unto the service of the Lord. Alwayes in delights think that thy chastitie is in danger; in riches think that thy humilitie is in danger; in many businesses think that thy godlinesse is in danger. Study to please none but Christ: Fear to displease none but Christ. Alwayes pray thou unto God to command what he will, and to give what he commands. Pray unto him to cover what is past, and to govern what is to come. As thou desirest to seem, so also thou must be. For God judgeth not according to the shew, but according to the truth. In thy words take heed of much babling:
                     Matt. 6.7. Matt. 12.36. because for every idle word thou must give an account in the day of judgement. Thy works, be they what they will, do not passe away; but are cast as certain seeds of eternitie: If thou sowest in the flesh,
                     Gal. 6.8. 
                     of the flesh thou shalt reap corruption: If thou sowest in the spirit, of the spirit thou shalt reap life everlasting. The honours of the world shall not follow thee after death; neither shall

thy heaps of riches follow thee; neither shall thy pleasures follow thee▪ neither shall the vanities of the world follow thee: But, after all, thy works shall follow thee:Rev. 14.13. As therefore thou desirest to be at the day of judgement, to day appeare to be such in the sight of God.
                        Cyprian.
                      Do not esteem those things that thou hast; but rather esteem those that thou wantest. Be not proud for what is given thee, but be humbled rather for that which is denied thee. Learn to live whiles thou mayst live: In this life is eternall life either obtained or lost: After death there is no time to work, but the time of recompense begins. In the life to come working is not expected, but the reward of working. Let holy meditation bring forth in thee knowledge, and knowledge compunction, and compunction devotion, and let devotion make prayer.
                        Kempis.
                      The silence of the mouth is a great good for the peace of the heart. The more thou art separated from the world, the more acceptable thou art unto God. Whatsoever thou desirest to have, ask of God; whatsoever

thou hast, give unto God. He that is not thankfull for that which is given already, is unworthy to receive more. Gods graces cease to descend, when our thanks cease to ascend.
                        Bernard.
                      Whatsoever happeneth unto thee, make use of it for good: When thou art in prosperity, think that thou hast then an occasion to blesse and praise God: When thou art in adversitie, think that thou art then put in minde of thy repentance and conversion. Shew the strength of thy power in helping,

Let all thy life be directed unto Christ as unto the mark; Follow him in the way, that thou mayst overtake him in thy countrey. In all things have a speciall care of profound humilitie, and ardent charitie. Let charitie lift up thy heart unto God, that thou mayest cleave unto him: And let humilitie keep thy heart down, that thou beest not proud. Judge God to be a Father,

the other: Be not secure in adversitie, but whatsoever adversitie happ

                      the reward of thy sinnes. God often punisheth secret offences by open corrections: Think upon the grievous stains of thy sinnes, and fear him that shall judge thee for thy sinnes according to his justice. Be not secure in prosperitie: For God is angry with him that is not punished in this life.
                        Nazian.
                      What are the afflictions of the godly? Bitter arrows sent from the sweet hand of God. God esteems many in this life unworthy to be punished, whom notwithstanding he reprobateth for ever. Outward felicitie is oftentimes a signe of eternall damnation: Nothing is more unhappy then the happinesse of sinners, and nothing more miserable then he that knows no miserie.
                        Austine.
                      Whithersoever thou turnest thine eyes, thou seest cause of grief, and findest remedies against securitie: Think upon God above, whom we have offended: Think upon hell beneath, which we have deserved: Think upon the sinne behinde, which we have

committed: Think upon the judgement before, which we stand in fear of: Think upon the conscience within, which we have defiled: And think upon the world without, which we have loved.
                        Bernard.
                      Consider whence thou camest; and be ashamed: Consider where thou art; and be sorrowfull: Consider whither thou goest; and tremble. The gate of salvation is narrow;Mat. 7.14. but the way of salvation is yet narrower. God hath given unto thee the treasure of faith, but thou carriest it about thee in vessels of clay: He gave thee the angels to be thy keepers: But the devil is not farre off;2. Cor. 4.7 Psal. 91.11 and he is ready to seduce thee. Thou art renewed in the spirit of thy minde: But yet thou hast much of the oldnes of the flesh.Eph. 4.23 Thou art set in the state of the grace of God: But yet thou art not set in eternall glory. There is a mansion prepared for thee in heaven: But yet thou must endure first the afflictions and assaults of the world. God hath promised forgivenesse to him that repenteth:
                        Anselm▪
                        
                      But he hath not promised will to repent to him that sinneth. The consolations of eternall

life expect thee: But yet thou must expect to enter in through many tribulations.
                     Act. 14.22 The crown of eternall reward is promised unto thee: But first thou must fight the great fight, and be conquerour. God doth not change his promise: Neither must thou change the study of holy life.

                      Let a man therefore lament &amp; grieve, shaking off all securitie, lest in the just and secret judgement of God he be forsaken, and left in the power of the devils to be destroyed. If thou hast the grace of God,
                        Bernard.
                      so delight thy self in it, as knowing that it is the gift of God, and that thou dost not possesse it by any hereditarie right: Yet be thou so secure concerning it, that thou canst not lose it, lest on a sudden when God shall withhold his gift, and withdraw his hand, thou beest discouraged, and become more sorrowfull then is fit: But happy shalt thou be if thou labourest with all care and diligence to avoid securitie the mother of all evil. God will not forsake

thee: But take heed that thou dost not forsake God. God hath given thee his grace: But pray thou unto him that he would also give thee perseverance. God bids thee be certain of thy salvation: but he bids thee not be secure.2. Tim. 4.7. Thou must fight valiantly, that thou mayest at length triumph gloriously. Thy flesh within thee fighteth against thee: And the enemie the nearer he is, the more he is to be feared. The world about thee fighteth against thee: And the greater the enemie is, the more to be feared. The devil above thee fighteth against thee: And the more potent the enemy is, the more to be feared. Through the power of God fear not to encounter with these enemies: Through the power of God thou shalt be enabled to obtain the victory. But thou canst not overcome these so great enemies by securitie, but by assiduity in fighting: The time of life is the time of fight: Then thou art most assaulted, when thou knowest not that thou art assaulted: Then do thy enemies most gather their forces together, when they

seem to grant truce. They are vigilant: And dost thou sleep? They make themselves ready to hurt: And dost not thou make thy self ready to resist? Many faint by the way, &amp; never come home into their countrey: How many of the Israelites died in the wildernes, and never came to see the promised land! How many spirituall sonnes of Abraham do perish in the wildernes of this world,Deut. 1.35 &amp; never come to enjoy the promised inheritance of the kingdome of heaven! Nothing is more powerfull to make us shake off security, then to think of the paucity of them that endure to the last. Let it therefore be our onely desire, to attain to the glory which is in heaven: Let it be our onely love to come thither: Let it be our onely grief that we are not alreadie come thither: And let it be our onely fear that we come not thither: That so we may have no joy but in those things that either further us in the way thither, or give us hope of coming thither. What profiteth it thee to rejoyce for a moment, &amp; to lament for ever?
                        Anselm.
                      What joy can there be in

this life, when that which delighteth passeth away, and that never passeth away which tormenteth? We live in securitie, as if we were past the snare of death &amp; day of judgement. Christ saith, that he will come to judgement at such an houre as we think not of.
                     Matt. 24.24. This saith Truth it self, and again he repeats it: Heare this and fear. If the Lord will come at such an houre as we think not of, we have great cause to fear; that so we come not unto judgement unprovided. If we come unprovided; How shall we be able to endure the strict examination in judgement? Notwithstanding, that which is lost in this one moment cannot be recovered again for ever. In the shortnes of one moment, judgement shall passe what we shall be for all eternitie. In this one moment life or death, damnation or salvation, punishment or eternall glory shall be appointed to every one. Lord, thou that hast given us grace to that which is good, give us also perseverance in that which is good!
               
               
                  
                  
                     Meditat. XXX. Of the holy imitation of Christ his life.
                  
                     Christs life must be a rule to thee,
                     If Christs disciple thou wilt be.
                  
                  THe holy life of Christ is the most perfect pattern of all vertues:
                        Gregor.
                      Every action of Christ serves for our instruction. Many would come to Christ;
                        Bernard.
                      but they will not follow him: They would enjoy Christ; but they will not imitate him. Learn of me,
                     Mat. 11.29 
                     for I am meek and lowly in heart, saith our Saviour: Unlesse thou wilt be Christs disciple, thou canst never be a true Christian: Let not Christs passion onely be thy merit, but let his action also be thy example to live after: Thy beloved is white and ruddie:
                     Can. 5.10. Be thou also ruddy, by the sprinkling of his bloud; and white, by the imitation of his life. For how dost thou love Christ, if thou lovest not his holy life? If ye love me,
                     Joh. 14.15 
                     keep my commandments, saith our Saviour: Therefore he that

keepeth not his commandments, loveth him not. Christs holy life is the perfect rule of our life: And this one rule of Christs life, is to be preferred before all the rules of Francis or Benedict. If thou wilt be the adopted sonne of God, consider what was the life of his onely begotten Sonne. If thou wilt be a coheir with Christ, thou must be a follower of Christ. He that liveth in vices, hath given himself to the service of the devil: And he that will be with the devil, how can he be with Christ? To love sinne, is to love the devil;1. Joh. 3.8. because all sinne is from the devil: How then can he that is a lover of the devil, be a lover of Christ? To love God, is to love holy life; because all holy life is from God: How then can he that is not a lover of holy life be a lover of God▪
                     
                        Gregor.
                      The doing of the work is the triall of love: It is the property of love to follow and to obey him that is beloved, to will the same that he willeth, and to be affected as he is: If then thou lovest Christ truly, thou wilt obey his commandments, thou wilt with him love holy life,

and being renewed in the spirit of thy minde,
                     Eph. 4.23. thou wilt think upon heavenly things.Joh. 17.3. 
                     Eternall life consists in the knowledge of Christ: And he that loves not Christ, knows him not. He that loves not humility, chastitie, gentlenesse, temperance, and charitie, loves not Christ: Because the love of Christ was nothing else but humilitie, chastitie, gentlenesse, temperance, and charitie. Christ saith that he knows not them,
                     Mat. 7.23. that fulfill not the will of his Father: Therefore they also know not Christ, that fulfill not the will of their heavenly Father. But what is the will of our heavenly Father? It is, according to the Apostle,1. Thess. 4 3. Rom. 8.14 
                     our sanctification. He is not of Christ that hath not the Spirit of Christ: Now where the Spirit of Christ is, he is present with his gifts and fruits. But what are the fruits of the Spirit?
                     Gal. 5.22. 
                     Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith, meeknesse, temperance. As the holy Ghost rested upon Christ;23. Isa. 11.2. Mat. 3.16. So doth he also rest on all those that are in Christ, by true faith: Because the spouse of Christ doth run in the odour

of Christs ointments.
                     Cant. 1.3. 1. Cor. 6.17. Mat. 19.5. 
                     He that cleaveth unto the Lord, is one spirit with him: As the carnall copulation of the man and the woman maketh of them one flesh: So the spirituall conjunction of Christ &amp; the faithfull soul maketh of them one spirit. And where there is one spirit, there is one will; and where there is the same will, there are the same actions. Therefore he that doth not conform his life to the life of Christ, is convinced that he neither doth cleave unto God, neither hath his Spirit.

                      Is it not meet that we should conform all our life to the life of Christ, who in love conformed himself wholly unto us▪ 
                     God manifesting himself in the flesh,
                     1. Tim. 3.16. set before us an example of holy life; that whosoever doth not live an holy life, might be without excuse as concerning the flesh. No life is more pleasant or quiet then the life of Christ; because Christ is true God: And what can enjoy more pleasure or tranquillity then God, who is the chiefest good? This life bringeth forth short joy, but draws with it eternall sorrow. To whomsoever

thou conformest thy self in this life, to him also shalt thou be conformed in the resurrection: If thou beginnest here to conform thy self unto the life of Christ; thou shalt in the resurrection be more fully conformed unto him. If thou conformest thy self unto the devil by sinne; thou shalt in the resurrection be conformed unto him by torment. He that will follow me,
                     Mat. 16.24. 
                     let him denie himself, saith our Saviour, and take up his crosse daily. If in this life thou deniest thy self; at the day of judgement Christ shall acknowledge thee for his. If for Christ here in this life thou renouncest thine own honour, the love of thy self, and thine own will; in the life to come Christ will make thee partaker of his honour, of his love, and of his will. If in this life thou partakest of the crosse; in the life to come thou shalt partake of eternall light: If in this life thou partakest of tribulation; in the life to come thou shalt partake of consolation: If in this life thou partakest of persecution; in the life to come thou shalt partake of a most large retribution.

He that shall confesse me before men, saith our Saviour,Mat. 10.22▪
                      
                     him also will I confesse before my Father which is in heaven: But we must confesse Christ not onely by the profession of doctrine, but also by conformity of life; So shall he at length at the day of judgement acknowledge us for his. Whosoever shall denie me before men,
                     33. 
                     him also will I denie before my Father which is in heaven. Christ is not onely denied by words, but also, and that much more, by wicked life: Whosoever therefore doth in this life deny Christ by his deeds, shall in deed be denied by Christ at the day of judgement. He is not a Christian that hath not the true faith of Christ: But true faith ingrafts us into Christ as vine-branches into the spirituall vine. Every branch that is in Christ,Joh. 15.2. and bringeth not forth fruit, the heavenly husbandman taketh away: But he that remaineth in Christ, and in whom Christ dwelleth by faith,
                     Eph. 3.17. bringeth forth much fruit. That branch is not in the vine, which draweth not from the vine its sap &amp; nourishment: So neither is that soul

in Christ by faith, which draweth not from Christ the sap of love by faith. Conform us, good Jesus, unto thy life in this world; that in the world to come we may be fully conformed unto it!
               
               
                  
                     Meditat. XXXI. Of the deniall of a mans own self.
                  
                     Thou from thy self must first depart,
                     Before thou canst in Christ have part.
                  
                  
                     Mat. 16.24
                     WHosoever will follow me, let him denie himself, saith our Saviour: To denie ones self, is to renounce the love of ones self: For the love of ones self doth exclude the love of God. If thou wilt be Christs disciple, it is necessary that self-love should altogether die in thee. No man loveth Christ, unlesse he hateth himself.Joh. 12.24 
                     Vnlesse the grain of wheat which is cast into the earth do die, it doth not bring forth fruit: So thou canst not reap the fruits of the holy Spirit, unlesse self-love do die in thy heart. The Lord said unto Abraham, Go out from thine own land,
                     Gen. 12.1 
                     and from

thine own kindred, and from thy fathers house, unto the land which I shall shew thee: Thou canst not be the true disciple of Christ, and a true spirituall man, unlesse thou goest forth from the love of thy self.Gen. 32.24, 31. 
                     Jacob in his wrestling with the Angel was lamed in one foot, the other being sound and whole:
                        Granat.
                      By the two feet is understood a double love; the love of ones self, and the love of God. Then shall a man be partaker of Gods blessing, when he halts upon the foot of self-love, the other foot, that is, of the love of God, remaining sound and whole.
                        Joh. Clim.
                      It is impossible for thee with one eye to behold heaven and earth: So it cannot be that with one and the same will a man should love himself inordinately, &amp; love God also. Love is the chiefest good of our soul: Therefore we must give the chief good of our soul to the chiefest good, that is, to God. Thy love is thy God, that is, whatsoever thou lovest chiefly thou settest in the place of God: But God is truly the chief being. Whosoever therefore loveth himself, judgeth himself to be

God, and setteth himself in the place of God, which is the greatest idolatry that can be. Whatsoever thou lovest chiefly, thou makest it to be the end of all other things, and thou judgest it to be the last complement of all thy desires: But it is God onely who is the beginning and the end of the creatures,Rev. 1.8. he is the first and the last, he onely filleth the desire of our hearts, and there is no created thing that can satisfie thy desires: Therefore thou must preferre the love of God before the love of thy self. God is the beginning and the end: In him therefore must our love begin, and in him also must it end. The essence of God is without all the creatures, as God was in himself from all eternitie: So withdraw thou thy love from all the creatures. Such as thy love is, such are thy works: If thy works proceed from true faith and love of God; they are acceptable unto God, and appear great in his eyes, though in the eyes of all men they seem but small: If they proceed from self-love, they cannot please God. Self-love defileth the most excellent works.

When Christ was in the house of Simon a certain woman broke a vessel of precious ointment,
                     Mat. 26.6 7. Joh. Arn.
                      
                     and anointed the head of Christ: The work seemed to be small, and yet notwithstanding it was acceptable unto Christ; because it proceeded from true faith, pure love and serious contrition. Sacrifice in the old Testament was a work acceptable unto God; and yet God was not well pleased that Saul set apart the spoils of the Amalekites to offer sacrifice unto God. Why?1. Sam. 15.15. Because this did not proceed from the love of God: For if he had loved God truly, he would not have contemned the commandment of God about the burning of all the spoils: He loved himself, and his own devotion. Love is a kinde of fire: For so the Church prayeth; Come, O holy Ghost, and kindle in the faithfull the fire of thy love. Fire doth not cleave fast unto the earth, but alwayes tends upwards: So thy love must not rest in thee, but it must be lifted up unto the Lord. Again, to denie ones self, is to renounce his own honour: Unto the chief good

alone is due the chiefest honour: And God is the chiefest good. He that seeketh his own glory, cannot seek Gods glory, as our Saviour said unto the Pharisees,Joh. 5.44. 
                     How can ye beleeve, which receive honour one of another? Behold the example of Christ, and follow it: He often witnesseth of himself, that he seeks not his own glory,Joh. 5.41. that he receiveth not honour from men, and that he is humble in heart.Mat. 11.29. All thy gifts thou receivest from God: Therefore render them again unto God. The rivers of all goods do flow from this fountain of Gods goodnesse: Therefore let them all flow back again into the sea. The herb which is called Tornsol, or Heliotropium, doth alwayes turn it self unto the sunne, by vertue whereof it draws its life and nourishment: So do thou with all thy gifts and honour turn thy self towards God, and attribute nothing unto thy self. If thou hast any thing of thine own, thou mayest seek thine own honour, and attribute thy gifts unto thy self: But seeing that thou hast nothing of thine own, but all from God, therefore

thou must seek, not thine own honour, but the honour of God. The seeking his own honour doth turn a man away from God: We have an example in Nabuchadnezzar, who said,Dan. 4.30 
                     Is not this great Babylon that I have built for the house of my kingdome, by the strength of my power, and for the honour of my majestie? But what follows?31. 
                     Whiles the word was in the kings mouth, a voice came from heaven, saying,
                     32. 
                     To thee, O Nabuchadnezzar, is it spoken: Thy kingdome is departed from thee, thou shalt be cast out from the company of men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: Even so if thou out of vain-glorie and pride dost boast of thy Babylon, that is, the building of thy good works, and take the glory thereof unto thy self, and not give it unto God; thou shalt be cast away from the sight of God. Last of all, To deny ones own self, is to renounce his own will: We must alwayes obey the best will: And Gods will is alwayes the best: We must obey his will,1. Cor. 4.7▪
                      from whom we have all that

we have: And from God comes all that we have. We must obey his will, who leadeth us alwayes unto life and that which is good: Delight in the Lord,
                     Psal. 37.4. 
                     and he shall give thee thy hearts desire. Our own will leads us unto death, and unto damnation. By what did our first father fall from the grace of God, and state of salvation, into eternall damnation? By leaving the will of God, and following his own will. He neglected the commandment of God, and gave eare unto the perswasion of the devil: Therefore the true disciple of Christ renounceth his own will, and desires to follow the will of God. Behold Christ!Mat. 26.39. He being in the agony of his passion, offered his own will as a most acceptable sacrifice unto God: Offer thou also unto God thine own will, and so shalt thou perfect that denial of thy self, which Christ requireth.Mat. 6.10. Let thy holy will, O Lord, be done in earth, as it is in heaven!
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     Meditat. XXXII. Of the true rest of the soul.
                  
                     Thy soul can nothing satiate
                     But God who did thy soul create.
                  
                  IN the transitorie things of this world the soul often seeks for rest, but findes it not: Why? Because the soul is more worthy then all the creatures, and therefore she cannot finde peace &amp; quietnesse in them as being more vile. All worldly things are flitting and transitorie; but the soul is immortall: How should she then finde true rest in them? All those are terrestriall, but our soul hath a celestiall originall: How should she then satiate and fulfill her desire in them? In Christ she findes rest,
                     Mat. 11.29 he can satisfie and fulfill her desire. Against the wrath of God she rests in the wounds of Christ: Against the accusations of Satan she rests in the power of Christ: Against the terrour of the law she rests in the gospel of Christ: Against the sinnes which accuse

her she rests in the bloud of Christ which speaketh better things,
                     Heb. 12.24. before God, then the bloud of Abel: Against the terrour of death she rests with confidence in the session of Christ at the right hand of the Father: And thus our faith findeth rest in Christ, and our love findeth great rest also. He that by his love cleaveth unto earthly things, hath no true rest; because earthly things themselves have it not in them: They cannot fully satiate the souls appetite; because they are all finite: But our soul being created after the image of God, doth desire that infinite good in which is all good. As therefore our faith ought not to relie upon any of the creatures, but upon the merit of Christ onely: So also our love should not be settled upon any of the creatures, nor upon our selves. For self-love hindereth the love of God: We must preferre the love of God before all. Our soul is the spouse of Christ: To him alone therefore must she adhere. Our soul is the temple of God: Therefore she must give entertainment to none but him.1. Cor. 3.16. Many seek

for rest in riches: But without Christ there is no rest to the soul.Mat. 8.20. Where Christ is, there is povertie, if not in act, yet in affect. He being the Lord of heaven and earth, had not where to rest his head: And so would he commend and sanctifie povertie unto us. Riches are without us: But that which will quiet the soul must be within. To what shall our soul cleave unto at death, when we must leave all worldly things? Either our riches forsake us, or we them: often in our life, but alwayes at our death. Where then shall our soul finde peace and rest? Many seek for rest in pleasures: But pleasures can bring no rest or delight unto the soul; although they may unto the body, for a time: At length grief and sorrow follow as companions. Pleasures belong unto this life: But the soul was not created for this life, because she is by death compelled to depart. How then should she finde rest in pleasures? Without Christ there is no rest to the soul: But what was the life of Christ? Extreme grief from

the first moment of his nativitie, even unto his death. By this means he the true prizer of things would teach us what to think concerning pleasure. Many seek for rest in honours: But miserable are they that at every change of popular breath are compelled to want their rest. Honour is without, and a flitting good: But that which will give rest unto the soul must be within.
                        L. Vives.
                      What canst thou say more of the praise and glory given by men, then of Apelles his commended picture? Consider the corner wherein thou keepest: What is the proportion thereof to a whole province, to all Europe, and to all the habitable world? That is true honour indeed which God shall hereafter give unto the elect. The rest of a thing is in its end: neither doth a thing rest naturally, untill it hath attained to its end and place. God is the end whereunto the soul was created: For it was made after the image of God. Therefore it cannot be quiet and at rest but in its end, that is, in God. As the soul is the life of the body:
                        Austine.
                      So is God the life of the soul.

As therefore that soul doth truly live in which God dwelleth by spirituall grace: So likewise that soul is dead, which hath not God dwelling in it. And what rest can there be to the soul that is dead? That first death in sinne doth necessarily draw with it the second death of damnation.Rev. 20.15. Whosoever therefore doth firmly cleave unto God with his love, and inwardly enjoyeth divine consolation, his rest can no outward things disquiet. In the midst of sorrows, he is joyfull; in povertie, rich; in the tribulations of this world, secure; in troubles, quiet; in the reproches and contumelies of men, still; and in death it self, living. He regards not the threats of tyrants: Because he feels within, the riches of divine consolation. In adversitie, he is not made sorrowfull: Because the holy Spirit within, doth comfort him effectually. In povertie, he is not vexed: Because he is rich in the goodnesse of God. The reproches of men do not trouble him: Because he enjoyeth the delights of divine honour. He regards not the pleasure of the

flesh: Because the sweetnesse of the Spirit is more acceptable unto him. He seeketh not after the friendship of the world: Because he seeketh the love of God, who is mercifull, and a friend unto him. He gapeth not after earthly treasures: Because his chief treasure is hidden in the heavens. He feareth not death: Because in God he alwayes liveth. He doth not much desire the wisdome of the world: Because he hath the Spirit within to be his teacher. That which is perfect taketh away that which is imperfect. He feareth neither lightning, nor tempests, nor fire, nor water, nor flouds, nor the sorrowfull aspects of the planets, nor the obscuration of the lights of heaven: Because he is carried up above the sphear of nature, and by faith resteth and liveth in Christ. He is not drawn away by the allurements of the world: Because he heares within him the voice of Christ which is sweeter. He fears not the power of the devil: Because he feels Gods indulgence. He that lives and overcomes in him, is stronger then the devil,

that in vain labours to overcome him. He follows not the enticements of the flesh: Because living in the Spirit, he feels the riches of the Spirit; and by the vivification of the Spirit mortifies and crucifies the flesh.
                     Gal. 5.24. He fears not the devil his accuser: Because he knows Christ to be his Advocate.
                     1. Joh. 2.1 This true rest of the soul he grant unto us, who is the onely authour and giver thereof, our Lord God blessed for ever!
               
               
                  
                     Meditat. XXXIII. Of the puritie of conscience.
                  
                     Labour to have a conscience pure:
                     When all things fail, that will endure.
                  
                  IN every thing thou takest in hand have a great care of thy conscience. If the devil incites thee to any sinne, stand in fear of the inward check of thy conscience. If thou art afraid to sinne in the presence of men, let thine own conscience much more deterre thee from sinne. The inward testimonie is of more efficacy then the outward: Therefore, although

thy sinnes could escape the accusations of all men, yet they can never escape the inward witnesse of thy conscience. Thy conscience shall be in the number of those books,
                     Rev. 20.12. that shall be opened at the judgement to come, as is testified in the Revelation. The first is the book of Gods omniscience; in which the thoughts, words, and deeds of all men shall manifestly appeare. The second book is Christ,Rev. 13.8. which is the book of life; in this book whosoever shall be found written by true faith, shall be carried by the angels into the court of heaven. The third is the book of the Scripture, according to the prescript rule whereof our faith and good works shall be judged: The word that I have spoken,
                     Joh. 12.48. saith our Saviour, shall judge them at the last day. The fourth book containeth in it the testimonies of the poore, which in the day of judgement shall receive us into an everlasting habitation.
                     Luk. 16.9. The fifth book contains the inward testimonie of the conscience: For the conscience is the book in which all sinnes are written:
                        Bernard.
                      The

conscience is a great volume in which all things are written by the finger of truth. The damned cannot deny their sinnes at the day of judgement; because they shall be convinced by the testimonie of their own consciences: They cannot fly from the accusation of their sinnes; because the tribunall of the conscience is within, and at home.
                        Nazianzen.
                      A pure conscience is the most cleare glasse of the soul, in which she beholds God and her self. A filthy eye cannot behold the splendour of true light: Hereupon saith our Saviour, Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.
                     Mat. 5.8. Camer.
                      As a beautifull and fair face is pleasing to the eye of man: So a pure and cleare conscience is acceptable in the sight of God: But the putrified conscience begets never-dying worms. Let us therefore in the present have a sense and feeling of the worm of conscience, and labour to destroy it▪ But let us not foster it, lest it live with us for ever. All other books were invented to mend this book:
                        Bernard.
                      What doth much science profit, if there be a foul conscience? Thou shalt be judged hereafter before

the throne of God, not by the book of thy science, but by the book of thy conscience. If thou wilt write this book right indeed, write it according to the copy of the book of life:Rev. 13.8. Christ is the book of life: Let the profession of thy faith be conformed to the rule of Christs doctrine, and let the course of thy life be conformed to the rule of Christs life. Thy conscience shall be good, if there be puritie in thy heart, truth in thy tongue, and honestie in thy actions. Use thy conscience for a lanthorn in all thy actions:
                        Nil. Bish·
                      For that will plainly shew unto thee what actions in thy life be good, and what be evil. Avoid that judgement of thy conscience in which one and the same shall be both defendant,
                        Cyprian.
                      and plaintiffe, witnesse, judge, tormentour, prison, scourge, executioner, and slaughterer. What escape can there be there, where it is the witnesse that accuseth, and where nothing can be hid from him that judgeth?
                        Gregor.
                      What doth it profit thee, if all men commend the
                        ••
                      and thy conscience accuse thee? What shall it hurt thee, if all men

detract from thee, and thy conscience defend thee? This judge is enough to accuse, judge, and condemne every man. This judge is uncorrupt, and cannot be moved with prayers, or corrupted with rewards.
                        Bernard.
                      Whithersoever thou goest, and wheresoever thou art, thy conscience is alwayes with thee, and carrieth about her whatsoever thou hast laid up in her, whether it be good or evil. She keeps for the living, and restoreth to the dead that which was committed to her keeping. So it is true that a mans enemies are they of his own houshold:Mat. 10.36. So in thine own house and amongst thine own family, thou hast those that do observe, accuse, and torment thee.
                        Lud. Vives
                      What doth it profit thee to live in all abundance and plenty, and to be tormented with the whip of conscience? The fountain of mans felicitie and misery is in his minde: What doth it profit a man in a burning fever to lie upon a bed of gold? What doth it profit a man t

                        ••
                     conscience, to enjoy all outward felicitie? As much as we regard everlasting

salvation, so much let us regard our conscience. For if a good conscience be lost, faith is lost; and if faith be lost, the grace of God is lost; and if the grace of God be lost, how can we hope for everlasting life? As the testimony of thy conscience is, such judgement mayest thou expect from Christ. Sinners shall become their own accusers, though none accuse them, or bring ought against them.
                        Chrysost.
                      As the drunkard, while he is overwhelmed with wine, hath no sense of the hurt which he receiveth by the wine; but when he hath slept out his drunken fit, then he feels the hurt: So sinne, whiles it is in action, doth blinde the minde, and like a thick cloud doth obscure the brightnesse of true judgement: But at length the conscience is roused, and gnaweth more grievously then any accuser. There are three judgements; The judgement of the world, the judgement of thy self, and the judgement of God: And as thou canst not escape the judgement of God: So neither canst thou escape the judgement of thy self; although sometimes thou

mayest escape the judgement of the world. No walls can hinder this witnesse from seeing all thy actions: What excuse can save thee, when thy conscience within doth accuse thee? The peace of conscience is the beginning of everlasting life. Thou mayest more truely and heartily rejoyce in the midst of troubles, having a good conscience, then thou canst in the midst of thy delights, having an evil conscience. Against the backbiting of all that bear thee ill will, thou mayest confidently oppose the defence and excuse of thy conscience. Enquire of thy self concerning thy self;
                        Bernard.
                      because thou knowest thy self farre better then any other man doth. At the last judgement what will the false praises of others profit thee, or the backbitings of others without a cause, hurt thee? By Gods and thine own judgement shalt thou either stand or fall: Thou shalt not stand or fall by the testimonie of others. The conscience is immortall, as the soul is immortall: And the punishments of hell shall torment the damned as long as the accusation of

conscience shall endure. No externall fire doth so afflict the bodie, as this inward fire doth inflame the conscience. The soul which is burned, is eternall; and the fire of the conscience is eternall. No outward scourges are so grievous unto the bodie, as these inward whips of conscience are unto the soul. Avoid therefore the guilt of sinne; that so thou mayest avoid the torment of conscience. By true repentance blot thy sinnes out of the book of thy conscience; that they may not be read at the judgement, and that thou mayest not be afraid of the voice of Gods sentence. Mortifie the worm of conscience by the heat of devotion; that it do not bite thee, and so beget eternall horrour. Extinguish this inward fire by thy teares; that so thou mayest attain to the joyes of an heavenly cooler. Grant, O Lord, that we may fight the good fight,
                     2. Tim. 4.7. 
                     keeping faith and a good conscience; that at length we may come safe and sound into our heavenly countrey!

                        Bernard.
                      miserable in his progresse, and lamentable in his egresse. He is assaulted by devils, provoked by tentations, allured by delights, cast down by tribulations, entangled by accusations, bestripped of vertues, and ensnared in evil customes. Wherefore then art thou proud,
                     Ecclus 10 9. 
                     O earth and ashes? What wast thou before thou wast brought forth? Stinking seed. What is thy life? A sack of dung. What after death? Meat for worms. If there be any thing good in thee; it is not thine, but Gods: Nothing is thine, but sinne. Challenge therefore unto thy self nothing that is within thee, but thy sinnes.
                        Kempis.
                      He is a fool &amp; an unfaithfull servant that will be proud

of his masters goods.
                        Bernard.
                      Behold, O man, the example of Christ! All the glory of heaven serveth him; yea he himself alone is the true glory: And yet he rejected all worldly glory. And still he cries,Mat. 11.29 
                     Learn of me, for I am meek and humble in heart. He is the true lover of Christ, that is the follower of Christ. He that loveth Christ, loveth also humilitie. Let the servant that is proud blush and be ashamed, seeing that the Lord of heaven is so humble. Our Saviour saith of himself that he is the Lily of the valleys;Cant. 
                           •
                        .1. because he, the most noble amongst flowers, is born and bred, not in the mountains, that is, in proud and lofty hearts, but in the low valleys, that is, in the contrite and humble mindes of the godly. For the soul that is truely humble,
                        Austine.
                      is a seat and delectable bed for Christ, as a godly man saith. True grace doth not lift a man up, but doth rather humble him: Therefore he is not yet partaker of grace, who walketh not in humblenesse of heart. The fluents of Gods grace flow downwards,
                        Bernard.
                      not upwards. As water by nature doth

not seek high places: So the grace of God doth not flow upwards, but downwards upon the hearts that are humble. The Psalmist saith, God dwelleth on high,
                     Psal. 113.5. and yet beholdeth he the things that are humble in heaven and in earth. Surely, this is a marvellous thing, that we cannot draw nigh unto God, who is the highest of all, unlesse we walk in the path of humilitie.
                        Bernard.
                      He that is vile in his own eyes, is great in the eyes of God. He that displeaseth himself, pleaseth God.Heb. 11.3. Of nothing did God create the heaven and the earth: And as it was in the creation, so also is it in the reparation of man. God creates of nothing, and repairs of nothing. Therefore that thou mayest be made partaker of regeneration and reparation, seem nothing in thine own eyes, that is, arrogate and attribute nothing unto thy self. We are all weak and frail: And think thou no man more frail then thy self. It hurts not to make thy self inferiour to all,
                        Kempis.
                      and by humilitie to put thy self under all: But it hurts very much, to preferre thy self before any one.

The holy angels the Seraphims cover their faces before the face of Gods majestie: And what then should man do, who is so vile a creature, and so unthankfull to his Creatour? Christ the true and onely begotten Sonne of God in wonderfull humilitie descended from heaven, and took our weak nature upon him, and condescended to take upon him our flesh, to die, and to be crucified: And what should man do, who by his sinnes is gone so farre astray from God? Behold, O faithfull soul, with what wonderfull humilitie Christ hath cured our pride! And dost thou still desire to be proud? By the way of humilitie and his passion Christ entred into glorie:Luke 24.26. And dost thou think ever to come to the glorie of heaven walking in the way of pride? The devil for his pride was banished out of the kingdome of heaven: And doest thou having not yet the fruition

of celestiall glorie think to come thither by the way of pride?Gen. 3.24 
                     Adam for his pride was cast out of paradise: And dost thou think to come to the celestiall paradise by the way of pride? Let us rather wish to serve,
                        Granat.
                      and to wash the feet of others with Christ, then to seek ambitiously with the devil for an higher place. Let us be humbled in this life; that we may be exalted in the life to come.
                        Beda.
                      Think not, O faithfull soul, what thou hast, but what thou wantest. Grieve for the vertues which thou hast not, rather then glorie for the vertues which thou hast.
                        Bernard.
                      Cover thy vertues; but lay open thy sinnes: For thou hast great cause to fear, that if thou shewest the treasure of thy good works by glorying in them, the devil will steal them away by making thee proud of them. Fire is best kept, if it be covered with ashes: So the fire of charitie is never more securely kept, then when it is covered with the ashes of humilitie. Pride is the seed of all sinne: Take heed therefore of being lifted up, lest it happen that thou beest cast headlong

into the abysse of sinne. Pride is a pleasing bed for the devil: Take heed therefore of being lifted up, lest it happen that thy miserable soul be made subject to the devils yoke. Pride is a winde that burneth and drieth up the fountain of Gods grace: Take heed therefore of being lifted up, lest it happen that thou beest separated from the grace of God. Cure, O Christ, the tumour of our pride! Let thy holy humilitie be our onely merit in this life, and let it be the pattern of our life! Let our faith firmly embrace thy humilitie, and let our life constantly follow after it!
               
               
                  
                     Meditat. XXXV. Of fleeing from covetousnesse.
                  
                     The man that covets, is but poore,
                     Although he riches have great store.
                  
                  AS thou dost tender the salvation of thy soul, see that thou dost hate the sinne of covetousnesse. The covetous man is the poorest amongst men; because he wanteth as

well that which he hath, as that which he hath not. The covetous man is the most miserable of all men; because he is good to no man, and worst to himself. Pride is the beginning of all sinne;1. Tim. 6.10. and covetousnesse the root of all evil: That, by turning us away from God; and this, by turning us unto the creatures. Riches bring forth sweat in the getting, create fear in the possessing,
                        Savanar.
                      and bring grief in the losing: And, which is worse, the labour of the covetous shall not onely perish, but shall also cause them to perish. Riches do either forsake thee,
                        Bernard.
                      or thou dost forsake them: If therefore thou puttest thy trust in riches, what will be thy hope at the houre of death? How wilt thou commend thy soul unto God, if thou dost not commend the care of thy body unto him?
                        Lud Vives.
                      God which is Almighty hath a care of thee: Wherefore then dost thou doubt whether he can sustain thee or no? God who is most wise hath a care of thee: Wherefore then dost thou doubt how he will sustain thee? God who is most bountifull hath a

care of thee: Wherefore then doest thou doubt how he will sustain thee? God who is most bountifull hath a care of thee: Wherefore then dost thou doubt whether he will sustain thee or no? Thou hast the word and bond of Christ, who is the Lord of all that is in heaven and earth,Mat. 6.33. that they which seek the kingdome of God, shall want nothing that is necessary for man. Trust in this promise of Christ, he will not deceive thee: For he is truth it self. Covetousnesse is the greatest Idolatry:
                     Colos. 3.5. Because it sets the creatures in the place of God. The covetous man putteth his trust in the creatures, whereas he should put his trust in God. Whatsoever we love more then God, we preferre before God; and whatsoever we preferre before God, we set up in the place of God. Esau sold his birth-right for a mease of pottage:Gen. 25.33. So many sell the inheritance of the kingdome of heaven, which was purchased by Christ, to get things temporall. Judas sold Christ for thirty pieces of silver:
                     Mat. 26.15. And covetous men sell Christ for temporall

riches. How can he ever come to the kingdome of heaven, who is filled daily with the husks of the swine? How can he ever come unto God by lifting up his heart unto him, who studies to seek rest for his soul in riches? Riches are thorns,Mat. 13.22 so saith truth it self: He therefore that loveth riches, doth indeed love thorns. O ye thorns, how many souls do ye choak! Thorns do hinder the increase of the seed: And even so doth the solicitude and care about riches hinder the spirituall fruit of the word. Thorns do afflict the bodie with punctures: And even so do riches torment the soul with cares. Thou shalt be sure to perish,
                        Austine.
                      if thou gatherest onely such treasures as do perish. They which lay up treasures here on earth, are like unto them that lay up their fruits in low and moist places, not considering that there they will soon come to rottennesse. What fools are they that place the end of their desires in riches!
                        Billius.
                      How can that which is corporall satisfie the soul which is spirituall? when as that rather doth so

comprehend corporall things by the vertue of its spirituall nature, that it cannot be distended and filled by any quantitie. The soul was created for eternitie: Thou doest wrong unto her therefore if thou placest the end of thy desires in temporall and momentanie things. The soul the more it is lifted up unto God, the more it is withdrawn from the love of riches. All things the nearer they are unto heaven, the lesse they

                     o

                     et and hoard up: As the fowls of the aire, which neither sow nor reap.
                     Mat. 6.26. It is a great signe that the soul is busied about heavenly things, if it do undervalue and contemne earthly things. Mice and creeping things hoard up in the holes of the earth: for they are of a worse condition and of a baser nature then the fowls. It is a great signe that the soul is turned away from God, and fastned unto the creatures, if it cleave unto riches with an inordinate love. God gave a soul unto thee: And wilt thou not commit thy bodie to his care? God feedeth the fowls of the aire: And dost thou, which art created after his image,

doubt whether he will sustain thee or no? God clotheth the lilies of the field: And doest thou doubt whether he will provide clothes for thee or no? Be ashamed, that faith and reason should not effect as much in thee, as a naturall instinct doth effect in the fowls. The fowls neither sow nor reap, but commit the care of their bodies unto God. The covetous men do not beleeve the words of God, before they make provision for their own sustenance. The covetous man is a most unjust man: Wherefore?1. Tim. 6.7. Because he brought nothing with him into this world, and yet he is so troubled about these earthly things, as if he meant to carry much with him out of this world. The covetous man is a most unthankfull man: Wherefore? Because he enjoyeth many gifts which come from God, and yet is never lifted up unto the giver thereof by the confidence of heart. The covetous man is a most foolish man: Wherefore? Because he leaveth the true good, without which nothing is good indeed, and cleaveth unto that which is not good without

the grace of God. He that is held bound by the love of earthly things, doth not possesse them, but is possessed of them. Covetousnesse is neither diminished by plenty, nor want: By want it is not diminished; because his desire of having doth still increase, when he cannot attain what he hath long desired: And by plenty it is not diminished; because the covetous man, the more he getteth, the more he desires: And when he hath got what he covetously desired, he hath still a new occasion ministred unto him to desire more: Like unto fire; which, as more wood is still laid on, the more it increaseth.
                        Gregor.
                      Covetousnesse is a torrent at first small, but afterwards increasing infinitely: Set a term therefore to the desire of riches, lest thy covetousnesse at length draw thee into everlasting destruction. Many devoure in this life that which they must afterwards digest in hell:
                        Austine.
                      And many whilest they thirst after gain,
                        Leo.
                      run unto most certain death. Think upon these things, O devout soul, and as much as thou canst, flee from covetousnesse. Thou

shalt carry to judgement none of thy riches, but those which thou hast given to the poore. Doest thou refuse to give thy temporall and fading riches to the poore, for whom Christ refused not to give his life? Give unto the poore, that thou mayest give unto thy self: That which thou dost not give unto the poore, another shall have. He is too too covetous,
                        Bernard.
                      to whom the Lord is not sufficient. He doth not yet truely hope for heavenly things, who overprizeth earthly things.1. John 3.16. How would he lay down his life for his brother, who denieth his temporall substance to his brother that asketh? The hand of the poore is the treasurie of heaven: That which it receiveth it layeth up in heaven, that upon earth it may not perish. Wouldest thou perform an acceptable office unto Christ? Shew thy bounty to the poore: That which is done unto his members, the head takes as done to himself.
                     Mat. 25.40 Austine.
                      Christ saith unto thee, Give unto me of that which I have given unto thee. Do good with thy goods, that thou mayest obtain good. Give thy earthly

things liberally, that thou mayest keep them: For in keeping them too frugally thou losest them. Heare Christ admonishing, that thou beest not compelled to heare him at the judgement saying, Go ye cursed into everlasting fire,
                     Mat. 25.41, 42. because ye fedde me not when I was hungry. The holy seed of almes-giving, as it is sowed sparingly or bountifully,
                     2. Cor. 9.6 so it shall be reaped sparingly or bountifully. If thou wouldest be in the number of the sheep, do good unto the sheep. Let the goats cause thee to fear:
                        Nazianz. Mat. 25.33. For they are placed at the left hand; not because they took any thing away, but because they gave not. Incline our hearts, O God, unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousnesse.

                     Meditat. XXXVI. Of the properties of true love and charitie.
                  
                     The signe by which the Saints we know,
                     It is by love their faith to show.
                  
                  TRue &amp; sincere love is an inseparable property of the godly: No

Christian without faith; and no faith without charitie. Where there is not the brightnesse of charitie, neither is there the heat of faith: Take away light from the sunne, and thou mayst take away charitie from faith. Charitie is the outward act of the inward life of a Christian man.Jam. 2.26. 
                     The bodie is dead without the spirit; and faith is dead without charitie. He is not of Christ, that hath not the Spirit of Christ; &amp; he hath not the Spirit of Christ, that hath not the gift of charitie. Charitie is the fruit of the Spirit:Gal. 5.22. The tree is not known to be good unlesse it bring forth good fruit.Col. 3.14. 
                     Charitie is the bond of Christian perfection: As the members of the bodie are knit together by the spirit, that is, the soul: So the true members of the mysticall bodie are united by the holy Spirit in the bond of charitie. In Solomons temple all was covered with gold within and without:1. Kin. 6.21. So in Gods Spirituall temple let all be beautified with love and charitie within and without.
                        Luther.
                      Let charitie move thy heart to compassion, and thy hand to contribution: Compassion

is not sufficient, unlesse there be also outward contribution: Neither is outward contribution sufficient, unlesse there be also inward compassion. Faith receiveth all from God, and charitie giveth it again unto our neighbour. By faith we are made partakers of the divine nature: But God is love.
                     1. Joh. 4.8 Therefore where charitie sheweth not it self without, let no man beleeve that there is faith within. No man beleeveth in Christ, which loveth not Christ: And no man loveth Christ, unlesse he love his neighbour. He doth not yet apprehend the benefit of Christ with true confidence of heart, whosoever doth denie unto his neighbour the office which he oweth unto him. That is not truely a good work which proceedeth not from faith:Rom. 14.23. Neither is it truely a good work which proceedeth not from charitie. Charitie is the seed of all vertues:
                        Bernard.
                      It is no good fruit which springeth not forth from the root of charitie: For charity is the spirituall tast of the soul: For unto it alone is every good thing sweet, every hard thing sweet,

all adversitie sweet, and all pain and trouble sweet; yea more, the taste of charitie maketh even death it self most sweet:Cant. 8.6. 
                     For love is strong as death, yea stronger then death; because love brought Christ to die for us: And love doth so stirre up the true godly, that they doubt not to die for Christ. All the works of God proceed from love, yea punishments themselves: So let all the works of a Christian man proceed from love. In all the creatures God hath set before us the glasse of love. The sunne and the starres shine not to themselves, but to us: The herbs purge not themselves, but us: Aire, water, beasts, and all creatures serve man: Do thou also give thy self wholly to serve thy neighbour. Tongues profit not without char
                           •
                        tie:
                     1. Cor. 13.1. 1. Cor. 8.1 1. Cor. 13.2. Because without charitie knowledge of tongues puffeth up, but charitie edifieth. Knowledge of mysteries profits not without charitie: Because the devil also hath knowledge of mysteries; but charitie is onely proper to the godly. Faith also which can remove mountains, profits not without charitie:
                     
For such faith is the faith of working miracles, and not of salvation. Charitie is better then the gift of doing miracles: Because that is the undoubted mark of true Christians; but this is sometimes granted to the wicked. It profits not to give all that one hath unto the poore, if there be not charitie: For the outward action is done in hypocrisie, if there be not inward love. Rivers of bounty profit not, unlesse they spring from the fountain of charitie. Charitie is patient:
                     4 For no man is easily angry with him that he loveth truly. Charitie is bountifull:
                     4 For he that by charitie hath bestowed his heart, which is the chief good of the soul, how should he denie the outward goods, which are lesse? Charitie envieth not:
                     4 Because he that is in charitie looketh upon anothers good as upon his own. Charitie thinketh no evil:
                     5 No man easily hurts him whom he loveth truly, and from his heart. Charitie is not puffed up:
                     4 Because by charity we are all made the members of one bodie; and one member prefers not it self before another.

                     Charity doth not behave it self undecently:
                     5 For it is the property of an angrie man to bear himself undecently; but charitie is the bridle of anger.5 
                     Charitie seeketh not those things which are her own: Because that which one loveth, he preferreth before himself, and seeketh the profit thereof more then his own.5 
                     Charitie is not provoked to anger: For all anger proceedeth from pride; but charity puts it self under all. Charitie imagineth no mischief:5 For it plainly appeareth that he is not yet in perfect charitie, whosoever worketh mischief against any one.6 
                     Charity rejoyceth not in iniquitie: For charitie maketh anothers miserie to be her own. Charitie beareth all things,
                     7 
                     beleeveth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things: For charitie refuseth not to do unto others as she desires that others should do unto her. Tongues shall cease, prophesies shall cease, and sciences shall be destroyed: But charitie shall▪ not cease; but the imperfection thereof shall be taken away, and the perfection thereof shall be compleat in

the life to come. God commanded two altars to be built in the tabernacle; and fire was carried from the outward to the inward: God hath congregated a twofold Church, a militant and a triumphant: The fire of love shall at length be translated from the militant to the triumphant. Think upon these things, O devout soul, and study after holy love: Whatsoever thy neighbour be, yet he is one for whom Christ vouchsafed to die: Why then dost thou deny to shew thy charitie to thy neighbour, when as Christ did not stick to lay down his life for him?
                        Bernard.
                      If thou lovest God truly, thou must also love his image. We are all one spirituall body:
                        Ofiand.
                      Let us therefore have all one spirituall minde: It is unfit that they should be at variance upon earth, which must at length live together in heaven. Whilest our mindes agree in Christ, let our wills also be conjoyned. We are the servants of one Lord: It is not fit that we should be at variance. That member of the body is dead, which hath not a sense of anothers grief: Neither let him judge

himself a member of Christs mysticall bodie, whosoever doth not grieve with another that suffereth. We have all one Father, that is, God, whom Christ hath taught thee daily to call our Father:
                        L. Vives.
                      And how shall he own thee to be his true sonne, unlesse thou again own his sonnes to be thy brethren? Love him that is commended unto thee by God, if he be worthy; because he is worthy: and if he be not worthy, yet love him; because God is worthy whom thou oughtest to obey. If thou lovest a man that is thine enemie, thou shewest thy self to be the friend of God. Do not mark what man doth against thee, but what thou hast done against God. Observe not the injuries offered thee by thine enemies; but observe the benefits conferred upon thee by God, who commandeth thee to love thine enemie. We are neighbours by the condition of our earthly nativity,
                        Austine.
                      and brothers by the hope of our celestiall inheritance: Let us therefore love one another. Kindle in us, O God, the fire of love and charity by thy Spirit!
               
               
                  
                  
                     Meditat. XXXVII. Of the studie of chastitie.
                  
                     The soul that's chast is Christ his spouse,
                     His bed of rest, his lodging-house.
                  
                  HE that will be the true disciple of Christ, must study to be chast and holy. Our most gracious God is a pure and chast Spirit: And thou must call upon him with chast prayers. It was the saying of a wise man,
                        Berosus.
                      That the chastitie of the body and the sanctitie of the soul are the two keys of religion and felicitie. If the body be not kept pure and immaculate from whoredome, the soul cannot be ardent in prayer.
                        
                           •
                        .Cor. 6.19. Our body is the temple of the holy Ghost: We must beware therefore, and be very carefull that we pollute not this holy habitacle of the holy Ghost. Our members are the members of Christ:15 We must beware that we take not the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot. Let us cleave unto the Lord by faith and chastitie;17 that we may be one spirit with him: Let us not cleave unto

an harlot; that we be not made one body with her.16 Gen. 19.11. The Sodomites burning with lust were smitten by the Lord with blindnesse corporall and spirituall: And such is the punishment of unchast men even unto this day. The Sodomites lust was punished with fire and brimstone
                     ▪ falling down from heaven: So God shall inflame the heat of this evil concupiscence in whoredomes with everlasting fire. This fire is not to be extinguished:Rev. 14.11. Rev. 22.15. But the smoke of the torments ascendeth up for ever and ever: Without, that is, without the heavenly Jerusalem, are dogs, that is impure and lustfull men. Christ hath washed us with his precious bloud in baptisme: And therefore we must beware, and be carefull that we do not defile our selves with filthy lust. Even nature her self hath taught men to blush and to be ashamed to commit such filthinesse in the sight of men: And yet they are not ashamed to commit it in the sight of God and his angels. No walls can hinder God from seeing; for his eyes are brighter then the sunne: No angles, or corners

can exclude the presence of the holy angels: No secret turnings can keep away the testimonie of the conscience. This is a wonderfull thing, That the heat of lust should ascend up into heaven,
                        Granat.
                      when the stink thereof descendeth even unto hell. This short pleasure shall bring forth everlasting sorrow:
                        Beda.
                      That which delighteth is momentany, but that which tormenteth is everlasting: The pleasure of fornication is short, but the punishment of the fornicatour is for ever. Let the memorie of him that was crucified crucifie in thee thy flesh.
                        Bernard.
                      Let the remembrance of hell quench in thee the heat of concupiscence. Let the tears of repentance extinguish in thee the fire of lust. Let the fear of God wound thy flesh, that the love of the flesh deceive thee not: Consider with thy self that the appetite of lust is full of anxietie and folly; the act full of abomination and ignominie; and the end full of repentance and shame. Look not upon the fawning face of the devil inciting thee to lust, but look back upon his tail, when he flyeth, which is full of pricks. Think

not upon the shortnes of the pleasure; but rather think upon the eternitie of the punishment.
                        Hierome▪
                        
                      Love the knowledge of the Scriptures; and then thou wilt not love the vices of the flesh. Be alwayes doing somewhat, that the tempter when he cometh may finde thee busied.2. Sam 11.2. Gen. 39.8. He deceived David when he was idle: He could not deceive Joseph; for he was busied in his masters service. Think every houre that death is at hand; and thou wilt easily despise all the pleasure of the flesh. Love temperance; and thou shalt easily overcome evil concupiscence. The belly set on fire with wine, doth presently some with lust. Amidst thy dainties thy chastitie is in danger: If therefore thou feedest thy flesh daintily and immoderately, thou nourishest thine own enemie. So feed thy flesh, that it may serve thee: keep it so under,
                        Hugo.
                      that it be not proud. Think upon the terrour of the last judgement, and thou shalt easily extinguish the fire of lust: For at the day of judgement the secrets of the heart shall be revealed;1. Cor. 4.5 and then how much more those things

that are done in secret?Matt. 12.36. 
                     Thou must give an account for unprofitable words: And how much more then for filthy speeches? Thou must give an account for filthy speeches: How much more then for impure actions? As long as thy life hath been,
                        Bernard.
                      so long shall thy accusation be: As many as thy sinnes have been, so many shall thy accusers be. Those thoughts which men make no reckoning of, shall come to judgement: What then doth it profit thee to have thy fornication for a time concealed from men, seeing that it must be revealed in the sight of all men at the day of judgement? What doth it profit thee to escape the judgement-seat of an earthly judge, seeing that thou canst not escape the judgement-seat of the supreme judge? This judge thou canst not corrupt with gifts; for he is a most just judge: This judge thou canst not move with prayers; for he is a most severe judge: This judge his province and jurisdiction thou canst not flee from; for he is a most powerfull judge: Him thou canst not deceive with vain excuses;

for he is a most wise judge: From his broad and proclaimed sentence thou canst not appeal; for he is the supreme judge. There shall be truth in the inquisition,
                        Bonavent.
                      nakednesse in the publication, and severitie in the execution. Therefore, O soul devout towards God, let the fear of this judge be alwayes before thine eyes; and the fire of lust shall not deceive thee. Be thou the rose of charitie, the violet of humilitie,
                        Bernard.
                      and the lilie of chastitie.Matt. 11.29. Learn humilitie of Christ thy bridegroom, and of him learn also chastitie.
                        Erasmus.
                      Great is the dignitie of chastitie, which was consecrated in the body of Christ: Great is the dignitie of chastitie; because whiles we are in the flesh it makes us to live as out of the flesh. As nothing is more vile then to be overcome of the flesh: So nothing is more glorious then to overcome the flesh. Neither must we onely avoid outward fornication, but also impure cogitations: Because God is judge, not onely of the outward acts, but also of the inward thoughts. Piety is often wounded by the looks, and chastitie is often wounded by

the eyes: Heare what truth it self saith: He that looketh upon a woman to lust after her,
                     Mat. 5.28. 
                     hath alreadie committed adulterie with her in his heart. As the fight is difficult:
                        Bernard.
                      So shall the victorie also be glorious. It is a difficult thing to quench the flaming fires of lust. Lust incites them that are not yet come to the yeares of youth; it inflames those that are young; and it wearieth those that are old and decrepit: It despiseth not cottages, neither doth it reverence palaces. But as difficult as it is here to fight, so laudable shall it be hereafter to triumph. The first sparks are presently to be quenched; and we must not adde fewel to the fire of evil concupiscences. The Apostle, when he reckons up the vices with which we must strive,
                        Camerar.
                      bids us not fight with fornication, but flee from it: Flee, saith he,

                        . Cor. 6.18. 
                     from fornication: For even as a stranger feigning simplicitie comes to us like a beggar to deceive us: if we denie him entrance, he goes his way; if we receive him in, he becomes our guest, and gathers strength: and at length, if we consent, he becomes

our lord and master: So the motions of evil concupiscence assail us: if we foster them not, they depart away; if thou wouldest not have this enemie to rule over thee, receive him not into the house of thy heart. Keep us, O God, in sanctitie of life, and chastitie of body!

                     Mov'd to and fro, and quickly gone.
                  
                  THink, O devout soul, upon the miserie and brevitie of this life, that thy heart may be lifted up to the desire of the celestiall inheritance. This life whiles it increaseth, it decreaseth; whiles it is augmented, it is diminished: Whatsoever is added to it, is also taken from it.
                        Seneca.
                      It is but a point of time that we live, yea it is yet lesse then a point: Whilest we turn our selves, immortalitie comes upon us. We are in this life, as in a

strange house: Abraham had not in the land of Canaan a place to dwell in;Gen. 23.4 but onely an hereditarie place for buriall: So this present life is like unto an inne, and to a burying-place. The beginning of this life is presently the beginning of death.
                        Ambrose. Gregor.
                      Our life is like unto him that saileth; for whether he stand, sit, or lie down, still he comes nearer &amp; nearer unto the havē, &amp; goeth thither, whither he is carried by the motion of the ship: So also we, whether we sleep, or wake, lie down or walk, will or nill, are carried still moment after moment till we come to our end. This life is rather a death; because every day we die:
                        Bernard.
                      For every day we spend some of our life. This life is full of grief for things past, full of labour for things present, and full of fear for things to come.

                      Our ingresse into this life is lamentable; because the infant begins his life with tears, as it were foreseeing the evils to come: Our progresse is weak; because many diseases afflict us, and many cares torment us: Our egresse is horrible; because we do not depart alone,

We are begotten in uncleannesse, we are nourished in darknesse, and brought forth in sorrow. Before we come forth, we are a burden to our wretched mothers; and when we do come forth, we do like vipers tear a way.
                        Austine.
                      We are strangers in our birth, and pilgrims in our life; because we are compelled to depart away by death. The first part of our life is ignorant of it self; the middle part is overwhelmed with cares; and the last part is burdened with grievous old age. All the time of our life is either present, past, or to come. If it be present, it is flitting; if it be past, it is then nothing; if it be to come, it is then uncertain.
                        Sol. Salam.
                      We are filthines in our originall, we are bubbles in our life, and we are meat for worms at our death. From earth we come, on earth we go, to earth we must return. The necessitie of our birth is base, our life miserable, and our death lamentable.
                        Sidonius.
                      Our body is an

earthly house in which do dwell together sinne and death, which every day consume it. All our life is a spirituall warfare. Above, devils lie in wait for our destruction: On the right hand and on the left, the world oppugnes us: Beneath and within, the flesh fighteth against us. The life of man is a warfare: Because in this life,Gal. 5.17. there is a continuall fight between the flesh and the spirit. What true joy then can a man have in this life, when there is in it no certain felicitie? What thing present can delight us, when other things do passe away, but that which hangeth over our heads, doth never passe away? And again what can delight us, when that which we love is quite ended, and grief that shall never have end, doth approch still nearer unto us? This is all we gain by long life:

                      To do more evil, to see more evil, and to suffer more evil. This is all that long life doeth for us: It makes our accusation the greater at the last judgement. What is man? The slave of death, and as a passenger on the way: He is lighter then a bubble,

shorter then a moment, more vain then an image, more empty then a sound, more brittle then glasse, more changeable then the winde, more flitting then a shadow, and more deceitfull then a dream.
                        Bapt. Mant.
                      What is this life? The expectation of death, the stage of mockeries, the sea of miseries, an hemine or phial of bloud which every light fall breaketh, and every fit of an ague corrupteth. The course of our life is a labyrinth; we enter into it when we come out of the wombe, and we go out of it by the passage of death.

                        Ware nought but earth, and earth is but a fume:
                        A fume is nought, as nought do we consume.
                     
This life is frail as glasse, is sliding as a river, is miserable as a warfare: And yet it seems to many much to be desired. This life seems outwardly as a gilded nut:
                        Gregory▪
                        
                      But if thou openest it with the knife of truth, thou shalt see that within there is nothing but worms and rottennesse. There are apples growing about Sodom, which are pleasing for outward beautie: But being touched they fall to dust. The felicitie of this life doth

outwardly delight; but if thou pressest it with a more weightie consideration, it will appear to be like unto smoke and dust. Therefore, O beloved soul, do not suffer thy cogitations to set up their rest in this life: But let thy minde alwayes pant and breathe after the joyes to come. Compare the short moment of time granted unto us in this life, with eternitie which never shall have end: and it will appear what a foolish thing it is to cleave unto this life that flitteth away, and to neglect that which is everlasting. This life of ours posteth away: And yet in it do we either get or lose everlasting life. This life is most miserable: And yet in it do we either get or lose everlasting life. This life is subject to many calamities: And yet in it do we either get or lose everlasting joy. If therefore thou hopest for life everlasting: in this flitting life desire it with all thy heart. Use the world; but let not thy heart cleave to the world: Negotiate in this world; but fix not thy minde upon this present life: The outward use of worldly things hurteth

not, unlesse thy inward affection cleave unto them. Heaven is thy countrey; the world is but the place of thy sojourning: Be not so much delighted with the momentanie entertainment of this world, as to have thy minde withdrawn from the desire after thy heavenly countrey. This life is our sea; but eternitie is our haven: Be not therefore so much delighted with the momentanie tranquillity of this sea, as that thou canst not attain to the haven of everlasting tranquillity. This life is sliding, and doth not keep faith with her lovers, but doth often flee from them when they never think of it: Why therefore wilt thou trust it▪ It is very dangerous for thee to promise unto thy self security for one houre: For oftenti

In the gourd wherewith Jonas was delighted,Jon. 4.7. God prepared a worm that it might wither: So in these worldly things, whereunto many

cleave so fast, as if they were glewed to them, there is no certaintie; but the worms of corruption do breed in them.
                        Austine.
                      The world is now so worn away with a long consumption, that it hath even lost the face by which it was wont to seduce: And therefore they that delight to perish with the world now perishing are as much to be blamed and condemned, as they are to be praised and commended, that flourished with the world then flourishing.

                     Meditat. XXXIX. Of the worlds vanitie.
                  
                     Love not the world: The world is vain:
                     But love those things that ay remain.
                  
                  
                     1. John 2.15.SEt not thy love, O devout soul, upon those things which are in the world:
                     1. Cor. 7.31. 2. Pet. 3.10. The world shall passe away, and all the things therein shall be consumed with fire: Where shall thy love be then? Love that good

which is everlasting; that so thou mayest live for ever.Rom. 8.20. Every creature is subject to vanitie: Whosoever therefore cleaveth with his love unto the creatures, shall also become vain himself. Love that good which is true and stable; that thy heart may be quieted and established. Why doth worldly honour delight thee? He that seeketh the honour of men,John 5.44. cannot be honoured by God. He that seeketh the honour of the world, must be conformed unto the world: and he that pleaseth the world,
                     Gal. 1.10. 
                     cannot please God. All things are un

                     able and must perish, whatsoever are given by those that are unstable and do perish: How then can the honour of the world be stable? He that was yesterday extolled to the skies by the praises of men, is brought down again to morrow with disgrace. Desire therefore to please God; that thou mayest be honoured of God: For that is the true and stable honour.
                        Kempis.
                      What is a man the better for being reputed great by man? If a man be great in the sight of

God, then is he great indeed, not otherwise. Christ being sought for to take a kingdome,Joh. 6.15. fled from it; but being sought for to be reproched, and to be ignominiously crucified, he offered himself:Joh. 18.5. Bernard.
                      Delight therefore rather in the disgrace then the glorie of the world; that so thou mayest be conformed unto Christ. He that doth not despise the world for Christ, how would he lay down his life for him? There is no way to true glory but by contemning the glory of the world:Luke 24.26. for so Christ entred into his glorie, by the ignominie of the crosse. Be content therefore to be despised, to be vilified, and to be rejected in this world; that thou mayest be honoured in the world to come. Christ taught us by his life how we should esteem of the world.
                        Bernard.
                      All the glory of the heavens serveth him, yea he alone is even glory it self: And yet he rejected worldly glory. Therefore the more a man is honoured, and the more he aboundeth in bodily consolations; the more deeply and inwardly must he become sorrowfull, that he is so farre from being conformable

unto Christ. Vain is the praise of man,
                        Kempis.
                      if an evil conscience accuseth within: What doth it profit a man sick of a fever, if he be laid in a bedsted of ivorie, when as notwithstanding he is tormented with raging heat within? It is the testimonie of thy conscience that is the true honour and praise indeed. There is no juster judge of thy doings, then God and thine own conscience: Desire to approve thy deeds before this judgement. Is it not enough for thee to be known of thy self, and, which is most of all, to be known of God? But why dost thou so much covet after riches?
                        Bernard.
                      He is too covetous unto whom the Lord is not sufficient. This life is the way to our eternall countrey: What then do much riches profit? They do rather burden the traveller, as great burdens do a ship. Christ the king of heaven is the riches of Gods servants.
                        L. Vives.
                      The true treasure must be within a man, and not without him.
                        Kempis.
                      That is the true treasure which thou canst carry with thee to the generall judgement: But all these outwaad goods are taken

from us in death. The goods gathered together do perish;
                        Bernard.
                      but first he that gathered them doth perish, unlesse he be rich in the Lord. Poore thou camest into the world,
                     Job 1.21. 
                     and poore must thou go out: And why should the middle differ from the beginning and the end?
                        Dionys.
                      Riches are appointed for our use: And how few will be sufficient! A little gift of grace and vertues is better then all earthly riches. Wherefore? Because vertue pleaseth God, but riches do not please him without vertue. The povertie of Christ must be more acceptable unto us,
                        Bernard.
                      then the riches of the whole world. Povertie was sanctified through Christ. He was poore in his nativitie, poore in his life, and poorest of all at his death. Why dost thou stick then to preferre povertie before worldly riches, when as Christ preferred it before heavenly riches? How will he commit his soul unto God, who doth not commit unto him the care of his body? How will he lay down his life for his brother, who doth not bestow his riches upon him? Riches

bring forth labour in the getting, fear in the possessing, and grief in the loosing: And, which is most to be lamented, the labour of the covetous doth not onely perish, but it causeth them also to perish, as Bernard teacheth. Thy love is thy God:Mat. 6.21. 
                     Where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also: He that loveth these bodily, worldly, and perishing riches, cannot love the spirituall, heavenly, and eternall riches. Wherefore? Because those presse down the heart of man, and draw it downwards; but these lift it upwards.
                        Austine.
                      The love of earthly things is as the birdlime of spirituall punishments, as one of the true lovers of Christ said.Gen. 19.26. 
                     Lots wife which was turned into a pillar of salt doth yet preach unto us, Not to look back to those things which are in the world; but to go straight on to our heavenly countrey.Mat. 4.22. The Apostles left all and followed Christ. Wherefore? Because the knowledge of the true riches taketh away the desire after false riches. If we have tasted the Spirit,
                        Gregory.
                      the flesh pleaseth not our taste. If Christ be sweet to a mans taste, then the

world is bitter unto it. But why dost thou so much seek after pleasures? Let the remembrance of him that was crucified, crucifie in thee all desire of pleasure. Let the remembrance of hell-fire quench in thee all the fire of lust. Compare the short moment of pleasure with eternall punishments. Pleasures are brutish, and they make us like brutes.
                        Bernard.
                      The sweetnesse of the kingdome of heaven pleaseth not his taste, that is daily full with the husks of the swine.
                        Granat.
                      Let us mortifie all sensuall pleasures, and let us with Abraham offer to God as a spirituall sacrifice this our beloved sonne,Gen. 22.3. that is, the concupiscences of our soul, by renouncing voluntarily all pleasure, and by embracing the bitternesse of the crosse. It is not a plain way strewed with roses, but a sharp way and set with thorns, that leadeth unto the kingdome of heaven. The outward man increaseth by pleasures; but the inward man by the crosse, and by tribulations. As much as the outward man is augmented, so much is the inward man diminished. Pleasures serve the bodie; but the true

godly have least care of their body, and the greatest care of their soul. Pleasures do captivate our hearts that they cannot be free in the love of God. Not pleasures, but the contempt of pleasures at death shalt thou carry away with thee, and bring to judgement: Let the fear of God then wound thy flesh; that the love of the flesh deceive thee not.
                        Bernard.

                     The palm-tree grows the more prest down,

                  IT is profitable for the faithfull soul, to be tried and confirmed by tentations in this world: Our Saviour himself would wrestle with the devil in the wildernesse,Matt. 4.1. that for us and for our salvation he might overcome him, and be the first champion in our quarrel. He descended first into hell, and afterwards ascended up into heaven: So the faithfull soul doth first descend into the hell of tentations; that so it may ascend into celestiall glory.Josh. 23. The people of Israel could not come to possesse the promised land of Canaan, before they had overcome divers enemies: Neither can the faithfull soul promise unto it self the kingdome of heaven, untill it hath overcome the flesh, the world, and the devil. Tentation proveth,

                      purgeth, and enlighteneth us. Tentation proveth us: For faith shaken by adversitie is

confirmed more strongly in the rock of salvation, it enlargeth it self more into the boughs of good works, and riseth up higher unto the hope of deliverance.Gen. 22.10. When Abraham being commanded to sacrifice his sonne, shewed himself ready to obey Gods command: after the tentation the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, saying,12. 
                     Now know I that thou fearest God, seeing that for my sake thou hast not spared thine onely sonne. Even so in tentations if thou shalt offer unto God the beloved sonne of thy soul, that is, thine own will, thou shalt be reputed one that truly feareth God, and thou shalt in thine heart heare God speaking unto thee. Fire proves gold, and tentation proves faith. The souldiers valour is seen in the fight: And the strength of our faith appeareth in tentations. When the whirling windes and the stormie waves beat upon the ship of Christ,Mat. 8.24.26. Judg. 7.4. then it appeareth of how little▪ faith some of the disciples are. The Israelites whom God commanded to be led forth to overcome the Midianites,

were first proved at the waters: So they which are to be admitted into their heavenly countrey after the conquest of their enemies, are first to be proved in the waters of tribulations and tentations. Whatsoever adversitie therefore, whatsoever tentations happen unto the faithfull soul; let her think with her self that they are for triall and not for deniall.
                        Bernard.
                      Tentation also purgeth. To purge out the pestilent humour of self-love, and the love of the world, Christ our Physician useth many grains of bitter Aloes. Tribulation sends us to search our conscience, and recalls to our memorie the sinnes of our life past: And further, as Physick preserveth the bodie from contagious diseases: So also doth tribulation preserve the soul from sinnes. Man is alwayes prone to sinne: But more in time of prosperitie then in adversitie.Matt. 13.22. 
                     Riches are thorns to many men: Therefore God plucks out the thorns; that they may not choak their souls. Varietie of worldly businesse hindereth many from the service of God: Therefore God sendeth diseases upon them; that

they may come to themselves, and begin to die to the world, and to live to God.
                  
                     Some men have tumbled down the hill of great prosperitie:
                     And have enjoyed truest rest in their adversitie.
                  
                  The honour of the world puffeth men up with pride: Therefore God brings them into contempt, and withdraweth from them the fewel of pride. Last of all, Tentation enlighteneth. We come not to know the frailtie and vanitie of all worldly comfort, but by tentations.Acts 7.56. 
                     Stephen when he was stoned, saw the glorie of Christ: So Christ manifests himself unto the contrite soul, in calamities. There is no true and solid joy but where God dwelleth; and Gods dwelling is in the contrite and humbled spirit.
                     Isa. 57.15. Affliction it is and tentation which humbleth the spirit, and maketh it contrite: Therefore true and solid joy is in the soul of the afflicted. Tentation is the way to come to the knowledge of God: Therefore the Lord saith,Psal. 61.16. 
                     I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him, and make

him see my salvation.
                     16. Blinde Tobie saw nothing either above him, beneath him, or before him, and therefore he saw not himself: But being enlightned of God by the angel Raphael, he saw all things, which before he could not see, using no other medicine but the gall of a fish:Tob. 6.8. To shew, that our eyes are to be anointed with the gall of bitternesse; that so we may be enlightned, and come to the true knowledge of our selves and worldly things. Why saith the Apostle, that we know but in a glasse? Because in tentations we come to know that God maketh the elect joyfull under the shew of sorrow,1. Cor. 13.12. and quickeneth them under the shew of death, and healeth them under the shew of sicknesse, and enricheth them under the shew of povertie. Therefore must the crosse and tentation be welcome unto him,
                        Bernard.
                      whosoever is not unthankfull to Christ who was crucified and tempted for us. O good Jesus! Let me be burned here, let me be smitten here, that I may be spared hereafter! O good Jesus! Thou which dost often cast us off from

thee by sparing us, make us to return unto thee by striking us! Afflict and presse the outward man; that the inward man may grow and increase! O good Jesus! Fight within me, against me: Be thou the moderatour of the fight, and the crown of my victorie! Whatsoever adversitie I feel in this life,

                      let it tend to the strengthening and increasing of my faith! O good Jesus! Help my weak faith! For so thou hast promised by thy holy prophet: As a mother comforteth her children, so will I comfort you:Isa. 66.13. Weller.
                      As a mother cherisheth and nourisheth her sucking infant with much care: So do thou (O good Jesus) erect and confirm my languishing faith! Grant that thy inward comforts may prevail more with me then the contradictions of all men and the devil himself, yea and the cogitations of mine own heart! O thou good Samaritane, poure▪

                     Take up thy crosse do but endure:
                     To overcome thou shalt be sure.
                  
                  BE quiet, O devout soul, and endure with patience the crosse which God hath laid upon thee: Consider the passion of Christ thy bridegroom. He suffered for all, of all, and in all. He suffered for all, yea even for them, which despise his precious passion, and wickedly trample his bloud under their feet.Heb. 10.29. He suffered of all. He is delivered, he is broken in pieces, he is forsaken of his heavenly Father,Matt. 26.56. he is forsaken of his disciples, he is rejected of the Jews his own peculiar people: For they preferred Barabbas the thief before him:Matt. 27.21. He is crucified of the Gentiles. He suffers for the sinnes of all men: And therefore he is afflicted of all men. He suffered also in all:Matt. 26.38. His soul was sorrowfull even unto death, and being pressed with the sense and feeling of

Gods anger, cries out that he was forsaken of God:
                     Matt. 27.46. All the members of his bodie are in a bloudy sweat: His head is crowned with thorns:
                     29.34. Psal. 22.16. John 19.34. His tongue tastes a cup of gall and vineger, his hands and feet are boared with nails, his side is wounded, his whole bodie is scourged, and he is stretched forth on the crosse: He suffered hunger, thirst, cold, contempt, povertie, reproches, wounds, death, and the crosse: And then how unjust a thing were it for the servant to rejoyce, when the Lord suffereth! How unjust were it that we should rejoyce in our sinnes, when our Saviour is so grievously punished for them! How unjust were it that the other members should not condole, when the head is afflicted! But rather it is necessary that we enter through many tribulations into the kingdome of heaven:Acts 14.22. as it was necessary that our Saviour should by his passion enter into celestiall glorie.
                     Luke 24.26. Rom. 8.18 Consider also the bountifull reward: The sufferings of this present life are not worthy of the glorie which shall be revealed unto us. How great soever our suffering is;

it is but temporall, yea sometimes but for a day: But the glorie is everlasting. God doth exactly observe all our adversities, and will at length bring them to judgement:
                     Eccles 12.14. How disgracefull a thing then will it be at the generall assembly of the whole world, to appear without the jewels and bracelets of the crosse, and passions!Isa. 25.8. Rev. 7.17. 
                     He shall wipe away all tears from the eyes of those that are his: O happy tears, which shall be wiped away by the hand of such a great Lord!
                        Dionys.
                      O happy crosse, that shall finde a crown in heaven! David was not ten whole yeares in his exile, but he was fourtie in his kingdome:2. Sam. 5.5 Here we have the shortnesse of our suffering prefigured, and the eternitie of the glorie which is to follow. It is but a moment of time wherein the Saints are exercised by the crosse: But the mercies by which they are comforted are for ever. And thus after adversitie in the morning, follows prosperitie in the evening. Consider also the tribulation of all the Saints.Job 2.8. Matt. 3.4. Behold Job mourning on the dunghill, John hungry in the wildernesse, Peter stretched

out upon the crosse, James beheaded of Herod with the sword! Behold Mary the blessed mother of our Saviour standing under the crosse!John 19.25. She was the type of the Church the spirituall mother of our Lord. Blessed are ye, saith Christ,Matth. 5.11, 12. 
                     when men shall persecute you for my names sake: For so have they done to the Prophets. O glorious persecution which makes us conformable unto the Prophets and Apostles, and all the Saints, and even unto Christ himself!

                      Let us therefore suffer with those that suffer, let us be crucified with those that are crucified, that we may be glorified with those that are glorified. If we be true sonnes indeed, let us not refuse the condition of the rest of our brethren. If we truly desire the inheritance of God, let us accept it wholly: For the sonnes of God are not onely heirs of joy and glory in the world to come, but also of heavinesse and sufferings in this present world.Heb. 12.6. 
                     For God scourgeth every sonne whom he receiveth: He punisheth their sinnes here, that he may spare them at the judgement to

come: He multiplies tribulations here, that he may multiply their reward hereafter: And so not onely the persecution, but the reward also is increased. Consider the happy condition of the crosse.
                        Bernard.
                      It plucks the love of the world out of us by the roots, but it sows in our hearts the seed of the love of God. The crosse begets in us an hate of worldly things, and lifts up our minde unto heavenly things. When the flesh is mortified, the spirit is quickened; and when the world waxeth bitter, Christ becometh sweet unto us. Great is the mysterie of the crosse, for by it God calls us to contrition, to true fear, and to the exercise of our patience. Let us open to him when he knocketh, and we shall heare what the Lord will say within us. The sight of the crosse is contemptible in the sight of the world, and in the carnall eyes of the outward man: But it is glorious in the sight of God, and in the spirituall eyes of the inward man. What was reputed by the Jews more base and vile then the passion of Christ? And what was

more glorious and precious in the sight of God? For it was the price paid for the sinnes of the whole world:
                     1. John 2.2. Even so the just man is afflicted; the just man dies, and no man considereth it:
                     Isa. 57.1. But precious is the crosse,Psal. 116.15. and precious is the death of the Saints in the sight of the Lord. The church which is the spouse of Christ, is black without,Cant. 1.5. by reason of calamities and persecutions: But she is beautifull within, by reason of divine consolation. The Church and every faithfull soul is as a garden enclosed,
                     4.12. and none knows the beauty thereof but he that is in it. We shall never fully and perfectly feel the consolation of the spirit, unlesse our flesh be afflicted without. If the love of the world dwelleth in us, the love of God cannot enter in. A full vessel cannot be filled with new liquour, unlesse the first be emptied. Let us therefore poure out the love of the world, that we may be filled with the love of God. Therefore God by the crosse doth extinguish in us the love of the world, that there may be

room for the love of God. Besides, the crosse drives us to our prayers, and is an occasion of vertue. When the North-winde blows upon the garden,
                     Cant. 4.16. that is, when persecutions assault the Church, then the spices thereof are scattered abroad, and the vertues thereof are increased, and they cast forth an odour pleasing unto God. The beloved bridegroom of my soul is white and ruddy;5.10. white for his innocency, and ruddie for his passion: And so is also the beloved spouse of Christ; white for her vertues, and ruddie for her sufferings. And thus the grace of God can produce oyl and hony out of the most hard rock of afflictions: And so, out of the bitter root of calamities God knows how to bring forth the most pleasant fruit of eternall glory. Unto which he bring us and admit us! Amen.

                  HOly Lord Jesus, the most loving bridegroom of my soul! when will the time come that thou wilt lead me to the solemnitie of thy marriage?
                     Rev. 19.7. Psal. 39.12. 
                     I am a pilgrim and a banished man from thee: But yet I most firmly beleeve and nothing doubt, but that I shall be shortly set at libertie out of the prison of my bodie, and appear before thy face.Psal. 55.5. 
                     Fear and trembling are come upon me; because I carry my treasure in vessels of clay:
                     2. Cor. 4.7 My minde is prone to errour, and my will is prone to sinne; and therefore my spirit within me is not alwayes ready,Matt. 26.41. 
                     but the flesh is alwayes weak. Sinne leadeth me captive, and the law of my members is repugnant to the law of my minde.
                     Rom. 7.23. 
                     Fear and trembling are come upon me;Psal. 55.5. because Satan lieth in wait for my

treasure: His subtiltie is great, his desire to hurt is most earnest, and his power is exceeding great. He deceived Adam in paradise,Gen. 3. John 13.27. and Judas in our Saviours school: And how then shall I be safe from his treacheries? Fear and trembling are come upon me,
                     Psal. 55.5. 1. John 5.19. because I am still in the world, which is altogether set upon wickednesse: The delights of the world entice me, adversities in the way of the Lord affright me, sometimes the enticements of the world are pleasing unto me, and all the world is full of snares: Miserable man that I am! how shall I be able to escape them? Joyes do assault me, and sorrows do assault me: Miserable man! how shall I be able to stand? Fear and trembling are come upon me,
                     Psal. 55.5. Phil. 2.13. because it is God that worketh in me both to will and to perfect. I am afraid lest I should force God, by my negligence and want of care, to take from me that good will which he hath given me. I make not a right use of remission of sinnes, and I refuse the first grace which was given freely: And therefore I have

cause to fear, lest God in his secret and just judgement justly take from me that which I have unjustly abused. I am afraid lest I be forsaken of him, whom after my first conversion I have so often forsaken. How grievously am I vexed when I consider, that the heavie and severe judgement of God shall follow after his benefits, if I make not a right use of them! But the infinite mercie of God raiseth me up; because as he hath given me to will, he will also give unto me to perfect; for he is God and is not changed: His mercy also is confirmed towards me,
                     Psal. 117.2. and shall not be changed:2. Tim. 2.16. 
                     The foundation of God is sure; sure indeed, because it is in God, in whom there is no change:
                     Jam. 1.17. Sure indeed, because it is confirmed by the bloud of Christ,
                     Heb. 12.24. 
                     which alwayes speaketh loud before the throne of God: Sure indeed, because it is signed with the sure seals of the Sacraments. If I should seek never so little salvation in my self, I must needs doubt of my salvation: But as all my righteousnesse is in Christ, so in him also is all the hope of my salvation.

If I had apprehended and laid hold upon Christ of mine own free will, I might yet fear, lest my will should change, and so I should loose Christ: But he that was found of him that sought him not, will not assuredly withdraw himself again after he is once found. He that hath translated me out of the shadow of death unto the participation of light,Luke 1.79 will not suffer me to return again unto my former darknesse.Rom. 11.26. 
                     The gifts of God are without repentance, and our vocation by God, as concerning the will of God: But I could wish that even I also were unchangeable in that which is good. That treasure is alwayes present; but the hand that should apprehend it doth sometimes languish: But I shall be able to apprehend Christ; because as he hath revealed himself unto me in his word and promises, so likewise he will grant unto me of his goodnesse that I may beleeve his word and promises. I will use the help and support of prayer to strengthen my faith, and I will not suffer the Lord to depart out of the chamber of my heart, untill I

have obtained salvation.1. Pet. 1.5. 
                     By the power of the Lord I shall be able to be preserved unto salvation: The power of the Lord doth lift me up and comfort me, but mine own infirmitie doth cast me down and make me sorrowfull.2. Cor. 12.9. But the power of the Lord shall be perfected in my weaknesse: He shall strengthen me, from whom cometh all the strength of my faith: The grace of God doth lift me up, but mine unworthinesse doth cast me down: But if there were any worthinesse in me, then it were no grace, but a reward. If of works,
                     Rom. 11.6 Austine.
                      
                     then certainly not of grace: For grace is not any way grace unlesse it be every way gratis. Therefore have I no respect unto my works:
                        Bernard.
                      That which is amisse, he will amend; that which is wanting, he will make up; that which he will not impute against me, shall be as if it were not. Therefore is my salvation onely from God,
                     Hos. 1.39. and therefore sure.

                        •
                      death every houre: Because it waits for thee every houre. In the morning when thou risest, O man, think that it is thy last day: And in the evening when thou goest to bed, think that it is thy last night upon earth. Whatsoever thou doest, whatsoever thou goest about, look about thee, and consider with thy self first, whether thou wouldest do such things or no, if thou shouldest die that houre, and so go to Gods judgement: What! Dost thou think that death doth not approch, because thou thinkest not of it? or dost thou think that it draweth nearer, because thou thinkest upon it? whether thou thinkest upon it or no, whether thou speakest of it or no, it hangs alwayes over thy head. Life was lent unto thee,

not given as a free-hold. Upon this condition thou didst enter in, that thou shouldest go out:Job 1.21. 
                     Naked thou camest, and naked thou must go. This life is a pilgrimage: when thou hast travelled a good while, then thou must return home again. Thou art but a farmer and tenant in this world, and not a perpetuall lord: Every houre think with thy self whither thou hastenest every moment. In this we are deceived, in that we think we die then, when we breathe out our last: Every day, every houre, every moment we die: Whatsoever is added unto our life is taken from it, and as it increaseth it also decreaseth: we fall not into death suddenly, but walk into it step after step. This life of ours is a way, and every day we must ridde some of it: Life and death seem to be most distant, but they are as neare as neare can be: For one passeth away, and the other cometh on. As it is with those that travel by sea, they oftentimes come to the haven, and yet they neither feel, nor so much as think whither they are carried: So likewise it is

with us: whatsoever we do, whether we eat, drink, or sleep, we draw nearer alwayes to our death. Many have passed away their life, even in the time whiles they were seeking after things belonging to the sustentation of this life. No man entertains death joyfully, unlesse he hath long before prepared himself for it. In this life die daily unto thy self; that so in death thou mayst live unto God. Before thou diest, let thy sinnes die in thee: In thy life time let the old Adam die in thee: So at thy death Christ shall live in thee. In thy life time let the outward man daily decay, that at thy death the inward man may be renewed in thee.2. Cor. 4.16. Death translateth thee from time to eternitie: for as the tree falls, so it lies:
                     Eccles 11.3. How carefully then ought we to think upon the houre of death! Time passeth away, but the infinite space of eternitie remains behinde: In time therefore make thy self ready for eternitie. What we shall be for ever, whether blessed or miserable, it shall be decreed at the houre of death: In that one moment, is

eternall felicitie either enjoyed or lost. Wherefore, O faithfull soul, how solicitous and carefull oughtest thou to be in preparing thy self for that houre! Thou wilt easily contemn all worldly things, if thou considerest with thy self that thou must die: Consider that thine eyes shall be darkened in death; and thou wilt easily turn away thine eyes from beholding vanitie:
                     Psal. 119.37. Consider that thy eares shall wax deaf at thy death; and it shall be easie for thee to stop thy eares against impious and filthy speeches: Consider that thy tongue shall be tied at thy death; and thou wilt have more regard unto thy words: Set before thine eyes the cold sweat and anxietie of those that are ready to die; and thou wilt easily contemn all worldly delights: Look upon the nakednesse of them that depart out of this world; and povertie in this life will not seem grievous unto thee: Consider the trembling of the whole bodie at the point of death; and thou wilt easily contemn the splendour of the world: Consider the mourning of the soul

being compelled to go out of the house of the bodie; and thou wilt easily beware of the guilt of all sinne: Consider the corruption that followeth after death; and thou wilt easily bring down thy proud flesh: Consider how naked thou art left at thy death, being forsaken of all the creatures; and thou wilt easily turn away thy love from them, and turn it towards the Creatour: Consider how narrowly death looks to thee, that thou carrie away nothing with thee at thy death; and thou wilt easily contemn all the riches of the world: He that in this life dieth daily through his sinnes, doth passe from death temporall unto the punishments of death eternall. No man is translated unto everlasting life, but he that begins here to live in Christ. That in death therefore thou mayest live, be ingrafted into Christ by faith: Let death be alwayes in thy thoughts; because it is to be expected alwayes.

                      We carry death alwayes about us; because we alwayes carry sinne about us,Rom. 6.23. 
                     and the wages of sinne is death. But if thou wouldest

escape the bitternesse of death, keep the word of Christ. Faith doth conjoyn and unite us unto Christ: Therefore they which are in Christ, die not: For Christ is their life.1. Cor. 6.17. 
                     He that is joyned unto God by faith, is one spirit with him: And therefore the faithfull man dieth not for ever; because God is his life.Exod. 1
                           •
                        .18. The people of Israel passed through the Red sea unto the promised land; but Pharaoh and his host were drowned: So the death of the godly is unto them the beginning of true life, and the gate of paradise; but the death of the wicked is not the end of their evils, but it coupleth together those evils which are past and those that follow after: They passe from the first unto the second death.
                     Rev. 20.14 So neare is the union between Christ and the faithfull,Rom. 8.38 that death it self cannot dissolve it. In the thickest cloud of death the torch of Gods grace shineth before them: In their dangerous journey Christ provideth for his beloved the angels to be their protectours. The bodies of the Saints are the temples of the holy Ghost:
                     1. Cor. 6.19. The holy

Ghost will not suffer his own temples altogether to be destroyed by death.1. Pet. 1.23. The word of God is the incorruptible seed: It is not destroyed by death; but it is hid in the hearts of the godly, and shall quicken them in their due time.

                     25. If thou art affrighted by reason of he bitternesse of death, God sheweth unto thee a tree which turneth

                     Isa. 11.1. This branch is Christ, and whosoever keepeth his word shall never see death. This life is burdensome:John 8.51. Ambrose.
                      And therefore it is good to be eased of it. The miserie of a Christian dieth: But the Christian man dieth not. That which we call death is but going a journey; it is not an end of life, but a beginning of a better life.
                        Ter. of patience. We do not lose our friends at their death, but send them before us; our friends do not die, but life enjoy; they go before us, they do not go from us for ever.

                      Do our friends die? Make this interpretation of it: That they cease to sinne, they cease to be tossed, and they cease to be miserable. Do they die in the faith? Interpret that thus: That they depart out of the shadow of life, that they may passe unto true life; from darknesse, to light; and from men, to God. Our life is a navigation, and death is the haven of securitie, and

safetie: Therefore we must not grieve that our friends are dead; but rather rejoyce in their behalf, that out of the turbulent sea they are come safe to the haven. This life is the souls imprisonment, but death sets her at libertie: Therefore old Simeon being about to die, crieth out, Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.
                     Luke 2.29. He desires to be set at libertie, being shut up in the prison of the bodie: We must rejoyce therefore in the behalf of our friends, that they are as it were delivered out of prison, and received into true libertie. In like manner the Apostle desires to be dissolved,
                     Phil. 1.23 as being bound to his body of earth in a kinde of miserable servitude. What? shall we be sorrowfull that our friends are delivered out of their bonds and set at libertie?

when as God hath wiped all tears from their eyes?Rev. 7.17. Shall we mourn and trouble our selves with grief, when as they are in the place where there is neither mourning, nor grief,
                     Rev. 21.4. 
                     nor any cry heard,
                     Rev. 14.13. but they rest from their labours? Shall we for their departure kill our selves with immoderate grief, when as they do enjoy the fellowship of the angels, and true solid joy? Shall we for their sakes weep and wail,Rev. 15.3. when as they sing a new song of the Lambe,
                     2

                        Cyprian.
                      What profit it is for to depart out of this world, Christ shewed, who when his disciples were sad, because that he said he should depart, answered, If ye loved me,
                     John 14.28. 
                     ye would rejoyce rather. If as thou wert sailing, a stormie tempest should arise, and the windes lift up the waves, and threaten shipwrack, wouldest not thou haste to the haven? Behold the world staggereth, and reeleth, and threatneth her ruine not onely for her old

age, but also by the end of things: And dost not thou thank God, and art not thou glad for thy friends, that being departed the sooner, they are delivered from ruines, shipwracks, and imminent plagues? In whose hands art thou kept safer then in the hands of Christ? In what place can the souls of thy friends rest safer then in the kingdome of paradise? Heare what the Apostle saith concerning death:Phil. 1.21. 
                     Death is gain: It is gain to have escaped the increase of sinne; it is gain to have left the things that are worse, and to have passed to the better. Although those whom by death thou hast lost were very deare unto thee: yet let God be more deare unto thee, whose will it was to take them unto himself. Be not angry with the Lord for taking away what he hath given: He hath received his own, he hath taken nothing from thee. Do not take it ill that the Lord doth require what he did onely lend thee: It is onely the Lord that foreseeth evils to come: It was his providence therefore to take away thy friends that they might

not be entangled in the misfortunes to come.Rev. 14.13. 
                     They that die in the Lord rest sweetly in their graves, when those that are alive are tormented grievously even in the palaces of their kingdome.
                        Bernard.
                      If by death thou hast lost those that were deare unto thee: Beleeve that thou shalt hereafter receive them more deare unto thee. A little distance of time doth separate thee from them: But blessed and secure eternitie shall joyn thee again unto them.
                        Austine.
                      For we hope upon a most true promise, that we shall depart out of this life, from whence some of our friends are departed before us; and that we shall come to that life, where the more known the more deare they shall be unto us, and amiable, without fear of any dissension.

                        What'ever souls have been before, or shall hereafter be,Bapt. Mant.
                        

                        Shall be receiv'd i'th theatre of huge capacitie.

                        There shall we know the face of them that of our kindred be,

                        And speak &amp; answer in our course each interchangeably.

                        
                           There with the brother sister shall, and sonne with father be:

                        And there they shall keep holy-day for all eternity.
                     
Therefore think not onely upon the time of thy friends forsaking thee, that is, at their death; but think also upon the time when they shall be restored again unto thee, that is, at the resurrection. To them that firmly beleeve the resurrection, death seemeth not death, but rather a quiet sleep. The whole universe seems to be a glasse,
                        Tertull.
                      in which we may behold the resurrection: The sunne that sets every night, riseth again in the morning: The herbs that are dead in the winter, shoot up again in the spring: The Phenix at her death reneweth her self again: When times and seasons are past they return again: After fruits are come to maturity, still there succeed others: Seeds unlesse they die and be corrupted, they rise not again with increase: All things are preserved by perishing, and generated by corrupting: Shall we think then that God hath to no end or

purpose set before us these types in nature? Shall nature be more powerfull then God, who hath promised that our bodies shall rise again?
                        Austine.
                      He that quickneth the grain of the seeds that are dead and rotten, that thou mayest live thereby in this world, shall not he much more raise up thee and thine, that thou mayest live with them for ever? God hath called thy loving friends unto their beds:
                     Isa. 57.2. And do not thou envie them their quiet rest: The resurrection will shortly come. It may be, thou didst hope that thy friends before their death would have been profitable members of the militant Church: But it hath pleased God to make them members of the Church triumphant: Seeing it hath so pleased God, be thou also well pleased. It may be, thou thoughtest that thy friends before their death would have attained to the knowledge of divers things: But it hath pleased God to take them up into the heavenly Academie, there to learn true wisdome: Seeing therefore it hath so pleased God, be thou also well pleased. It may be, thou didst hope

that thy friends before their death would be raised out of the dust, and be set with princes:
                     Psal. 113.
                           •
                        . But it hath pleased God to make them the fellows of heavenly princes, that is, the holy angels: Seeing therefore it hath so pleased God, be thou also well pleased. It may be, thou didst hope that thy friends before their death would have gathered together much riches: But it hath pleased God to make them partakers of the delights of his heavenly kingdome: And therefore seeing that it hath so pleased God, be thou also well pleased. Holy God, thou hast taken away nothing but what thou gavest, blessed be thy name for ever and ever!
               
               
                  
                  
                     Meditat. XLV. Of the last judgement.
                  
                     Remember that Christ Jesus shall
                     Thoughts, words, and deeds to judgement call.
                  
                  
                     THe Father judgeth no man,
                     John 5.22 
                     but hath committed all judgement to his Sonne. I know, Lord Jesus,
                        Carthenius
                      that thou wilt come as the severe Judge of all men, to bring their thoughts,
                     1. Cor. 4.5 words, and deeds to light, though they were done in darknesse. Above, there shall be a severe judge; beneath, hell gaping; within, the conscience gnawing; without, the fire flaming; on the right hand, sinnes accusing; on the left hand, the devils terrifying: The good angels keeping out of heaven, and the evil angels pulling down to hell: Then, Lord Jesus, to whom shall I betake my self in these my straits? I am afraid of all my works, knowing that thou sparest not every one that offendeth.Job 94.28. I shall there be set between time and eternity: Time will be past, but the infinite space of

eternitie will remain behinde. The malignant spirits will require their wicked works, unto which they have perswaded me; and in that severe judgement they will produce all they know against me, that they may draw my soul into the fellowship of their torments.Isa. 34.4. 
                     All the host of heaven shall consume away, the heavens shall be rolled together like a scrole, all the host of them shall fall, even as a leaf falleth from the vine or figge-tree. The sunne shall be ashamed, and the moon shall be brought to confusion:
                     Isa. 24.23. But if these the works of thy hands, which never committed any evil against thee, if they flee away from thy sight, how shall I miserable sinner be able to appear before thy face? The heavens of heavens are not clean in thy sight:
                     Job 15.15.16. 1. Pet. 4.18. What am I then that drink iniquitie like water? But if the righteous shall scarce be saved, where shall the sinner appear? Whither then shall I fly, or to whom shall I go, but unto thee, O Lord? Thou shalt be the Judge of my sinnes, who diedst for my sinnes: For the Father judgeth no man,
                     Joh. 5.22. 
                     but

hath committed all judgement unto his Sonne: The Father delivered all judgement to the Sonne; but the Son again was delivered for our sinnes. For God so loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne,
                     Joh. 3.56. not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him: How canst thou then condemn me, Lord Jesus, when as thou wast sent by thy Father to save me? Thou 
                        •
                     idst fulfill the will of thy Father in all things: How then wilt thou not fulfill it in saving me miserable sinner? It is not the will of thy Father that one of the little ones should perish:
                     Matth. 18.14. And I am a little one in thy sight, and a little one also in mine own sight:Gen. 18.27. For what am I but dust and ashes? Neither onely dust and ashes, but also a very little one, and a very dwarf for proficiencie in piety: Perfect therefore in me little one the will of thy Father. Thou camest, O Jesus, to save that which was lost:
                     Matt. 18▪ 11. How then canst thou condemn him that desires to be saved? My sinnes will accuse me, and call upon the Judge for severe sentence: But thou hast taken

my sinnes upon thee:Joh. 1.29 Thou takest away the sinnes of the world: How then hast thou not taken away mine also? How canst thou condemn me for my sins, when thou diedst for them? Thou diedst for the sinnes of the whole world:
                     1. John 2.2. How then hast thou not died for mine also? Certainly, Lord Jesus, if thou hadst meant to deal with me in thy strict judgement, thou wouldest never have descended from heaven to take upon thee my flesh, to die, and to be crucified. The devils will accuse me, and require of my soul the works whereunto they have perswaded me:John 14.30. But the prince of this world is condemned, and hath nothing in thee; and if he hath nothing in thee, then certainly he hath nothing in me: For I beleeve in thee, O Lord, therefore thou abidest in me,
                     John 15.4 
                     and I in thee: He will accuse me, that am thy friend; He will accuse me, that am thy brother, that am the beloved sonne of the eternall Father: How then canst thou deal with me in thy strict judgement, seeing that I am thy friend, thy brother, and thy sonne? At that judgement

                     Moses will accuse me,Deut. 27.26. and pronounce me accursed, for not keeping all that is written in the book of the law: But thou, O Christ, wast made a curse for me,Gal. 3.13. that I might be freed from the curse of the law. I shall be cursed by Moses, but blessed by thee: For I desire to heare that voice;Matt. 25.34. 
                     Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdome prepared for you. Moses will accuse me: But thou wilt not accuse me to thy Father; yea, thou makest intercession for me.
                     Rom. 8.34 Therefore I am not afraid of Moses his curse; because thou hast blotted out the hand-writing which was against me.
                     Col. 2.14. The damned will accuse me, and pronounce me guiltie of the same fault with them: I confesse, Lord Jesus, my guiltinesse doth conjoyn me with them: but the acknowledgement of my guiltines, and the saving knowledge of thee doth disjoyn me from them. He that heareth thy word, and beleeveth on him that sent thee,
                     John 5.24 
                     hath life everlasting, and shall not come into condemnation. I heare thy word, Lord, and in thee I beleeve with

weak faith,Mar. 9.24. but yet faith: Lord I beleeve; yet help thou my unbelief▪
                      Lord I beleeve; but yet do thou increase my faith:Luk. 17.5. Although I am not free from all the sinnes of the damned, yet thou, O Lord, shalt deliver me from unbelief. All my accusers do terrifie me, but thou being my Judge dost comfort me: To thee hath the Father committed all judgement.
                     Joh. 5.22. Matt. 11.27. Rom. 8.32 Into thy hands hath he delivered all things; and again, thee hath he delivered up for us all: and thou hast delivered up thy self for the Church, to sanctifie it, and cleanse it by the washing of water through the word:Eph. 5.26. How canst thou then according to severe judgement judge those for whom thou hast delivered thy self to death, even the death of the crosse?Eph. 5.29.30. Thou canst not hate thine own flesh: we are members of thy body, of thy flesh, and of thy bones.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     Meditat. XLVI. Of the desire of eternall life.
                  
                     All earthly things tread under thee,
                     And let thy thoughts in heaven be.
                  
                  DEvout soul, thou must not love this life which is transitorie; but rather that which remaineth for ever: Ascend up by thy desires to the place where there is youth without old age, life without death,
                        Austine.
                      joy without sorrow, and a kingdome without change: If beauty delight thee;
                        Anselm.
                     
                     The righteous shall shine as the sunne:
                     Matt. 13.43. Matt. 22.30. If swiftnesse, and strength; The elect shall be like unto the angels of God: If a long and healthfull life; There shall be healthfull eternitie, and eternall healthfulnesse: If fulnesse; The elect shall be filled, when the glory of the Lord shall appear: If melodie; There do the quires of angels sing without end: If pure pleasure; God shall make those that are his, drunk in the torrent of pleasure: If wisdome; The very wisdome of God shall shew it self unto them: If

love; They shall love God more then themselves, and one another as themselves; and God shall love them more then they themselves: If concord delight; There they shall be all of one minde: If power; To the elect shall all things be easie; they shall desire nothing but what they shall be able; and they shall desire nothing but what God will have them to will, and to desire: If honour and riches delight; God will make his faithfull servants rulers over many things:
                     Matt. 25.23. If true securitie; They shall be as certain never to want that good, as they are certain that they themselves would never lose it willingly; and that God that loveth them will never take from them against their wills that which they love; and that nothing is more powerfull then God, to separate God and them asunder.
                        Bonavent.
                      Whatsoever the elect can desire, there they shall finde; because they shall behold him,1. Cor. 13.12. that is all in all, face to face. So great are the goods of that life that they cannot be measured;
                        Pelarg.
                      so many that they cannot be numbred; and so precious that they cannot be valued.

There shall be eternall health unto our bodies, and great puritie unto our souls; there shall be glory and fulnesse of divine pleasure; there shall we have familiaritie with the saints and angels for ever, having our bodies of admirable clearnesse and brightnesse.
                        Bonavent.
                      The elect shall rejoyce for the pleasantnesse of the place, which they shall possesse; for the pleasant societie, in which they shall reigne; for the glory of their bodies, which they shall put on; for the world, which they have despised; and for hell, which they have escaped.
                        Austine.
                      The least crown of eternall life shall be more worth then a thousand worlds; because they are all finite, but this is infinite: Neither is there any fear that they shall envie one anothers brightnesse; because there shall reigne in them all, unitie of love: By reason of that high degree of love, whatsoever happeneth to one of the elect, the rest shall as much rejoyce at as if it were their own. There is no greater good then God, in heaven and in earth: Therefore there can be no greater &amp; perfecter joy, then to see &amp;

possesse God: Therefore to see God for one moment, shall go beyond all joyes: For we shall see God in himself, God in us, and our selves in God: In the way of this life we have Christ with us,
                        Bernard.
                      but hidden under the covering of the word and sacraments. We know him not here as he is, but in the life to come we shall behold him in presence, when he shall distribute unto us the bread that satisfieth for ever: As the disciples knew him not upon the way,
                     Luke 24.35. but in the Inne at length, when he broke bread unto them. The heavenly Jerusalem hath no temple made with hands, neither sunne nor moon; because the temple thereof is eternall,Rev. 21.23. and God is the life thereof. Vision succeeds in the place of faith, attainment in the place of hope, and perfect fruition in the place of love. As at the building of Solomons temple there was heard neither the sound of ax nor hammer:
                     
                        Berthor. 1. Kings 6.7. So in the heavenly Jerusalem, there is neither pain nor tribulation felt; because the materials of this temple, to wit,1. Pet. 2.5. the spirituall stones are prepared by tribulation in the world long

before.1. Ki

Therefore let the faithfull soul lift up her self, and consider what good things are prepared for her: Thither let the spirit be directed whither at length it shall go: In time we must strive to go thither, where at length we must remain for all eternitie: Into this glorie of the Lord shall no man enter but he that desireth to enter:

                     God shall be all in all, and shall distribute unto every one good things according to the desires of his own heart: If thou desirest life, if health, if peace, if honour, God shall be there all in all. The mysteries which are now sealed up in the great doctours of the Church, shall be then revealed even unto babes: The blessed humanitie of Christ shall be there present unto us, and shall preach unto us with a most sweet voice concerning the mysterie of our salvation.Cant. 2.14 Psal. 45.2. Psal. 8.5. 
                     His voice is sweet, and his face is comely: Full of grace are his lips: And he is crowned with glory

and honour:
                        Bernard.
                      But if God shall be all in all, then shall he be fulnesse of light to the understanding, plenty of peace to the will, and continuance of eternitie to the memorie. The Sonne will satisfie the understanding with perfect knowledge, the holy Ghost will satisfie the will with most sweet love, and the Father will satisfie the memory with the remembrance of both.

If the sight of God appearing in the shape of man, brought salvation and life unto the soul: Certainly the seeing of him face to face shall bring

life and everlasting felicitie. What then can be added to this felicitie? What can the elect desire beside the fruition of the sight of God? And yet notwithstanding they shall enjoy the most sweet and blessed fellowship of the angels: Neither shall they onely enjoy their fellowship, but they shall be also like unto them for the nimblenesse, brightnesse, and immortalitie of their bodies: We shall be clothed with the same garment that they are;Rev. 7.9▪

                     If into hell thou would'st not fall,
                     Be there by thoughts continuall.
                  
                  THink, O devout soul, upon the grievousnesse of hell-torments, and thou shalt easily get the mastery of all wicked pleasure in sinne. There shall be the presence of all evil,
                        Carthenius
                      &amp; the absence of all good. What evil can be wanting to them who are punished for the greatest evil, &amp; that is sinne? what good thing can be present to them, who are removed from the chiefest good, and that is God? There shall be the heat of fire and the freezing of cold; There shall be perpetuall darknesse; There shall be smoak and continuall tears; There shall be the terrible sight of the devils; There shall be crying for ever; There shall be drinesse, thirst, the stink of brimstone, the worm of conscience, fear, grief, shame &amp; confusion for sins made manifest to all, envy,

hatred, sorrow, want of the divine vision, and losse of all hope. By the power of God the light of the fire shall be separated from the burning qualitie; the light shall serve for the joy of the saints, and the burning qualitie for the torment of the damned. It shall shine to the damned, but not as an object of comfort, that they may see it and rejoyce: But to the increasing of their miserie, that they may see and grieve the more. The sight shall be deprived of the light of the sunne, moon, and all the starres, as also of the sight of Christ and all the saints: And it shall be punished with weeping, smoak, and the sight of the devils and all the damned. The eares shall heare schreetchings, and frequent blasphemies of the damned, and the horrible roaring of the devils The taste shall be afflicted with hunger and thirst, and shall be deprived of all the pleasure of meat and drink. The smell shall be tormented with the stink of brimstone. The touch shall feel the fire within and without, burning &amp; piercing even to the marrow. The bodies

of the damned shall be deformed, obscured, slow, and heavie: The memorie shall be tormented with the remembrance of sinnes past; neither will she grieve so much, that she hath sinned, as that she hath lost her pleasures. One spark of hellfire shall more torment the sinner, then if a woman should remain in labour and travail a thousand yeares: There shall be weeping for grief, and gnashing of teeth for madnesse:Mat. 22.14 In the flesh they shall be tormented by the worm of conscience.
                        Bernard.
                      There is no sinne which shall not there have its proper torment. As there is nothing to be desired in the kingdome of heaven which may not be found: So in hell there is nothing found that is desired. It will nothing profit the damned there, to have enjoyed divers pleasures in their life: yea the remembrance of them shall grievously torment them. It will nothing profit the damned to have lived here in this life in perpetuall fulnesse and drunkennesse: for then they shall not obtain so much as a little drop of water.Luk. 16.24 It will nothing

profit them, to have been clothed with costly garments: because they shall be covered with confusion, and have their bodies clothed with shame. It will nothing profit them, to have lived in honour: for in hell there is no honour, but continuall sighing and dolour. It will nothing profit them, to have heaped up riches in this life: because they shall be all there poore alike.
                        Bernard.
                      They shall be removed from the beatificall vision of God. Not to see God, exceeds all the punishments of hell. If the damned which are shut up in the prison of hell could but see Gods face, they should feel no pain, no grief, no sorrow. They shall feel the wrath of God, and yet they shall never see the beatificall face of God: They shall feel punishments from his face, and yet they shall never behold his face.
                        Polycarp.
                      The furie of the Lord shall alwayes kindle the fire of eternall damnation like a river of brimstone. Neither shall they onely be removed from beholding God, but they shall be also miserably tormented by the sight of the devils.

They shall feel their whips, whose commands they have followed in this life. If the sight of a seeming ghost doth almost exanimate a man in this life, what shall the horrible sight of the devils which shall last for ever? Neither shall they onely be compelled to be with the devils, but they shall feel themselves tormented by them for ever. If in this life by Gods permission, the devil doth so grievously afflict the saints: How grievously shall he torment the damned which are given up to his power for ever! The damned shall not onely be tormented by the devils outwardly, but by the worm of conscience also inwardly. All sinnes whatsoever they have committed, shall be set daily before their eyes: And their torture shall be so much the greater, because there remains no more the benefit of repentance. When the virgins that are prepared are entred in with the bridegroom, the gate shall be shut presently:Mat. 25.10. Granat.
                      Understand thou the gate of indulgence, the gate of mercie, the gate of consolation, the gate of hope▪
                     
the gate of grace, the gate of holy conversion. The damned shall cry,
                     Revel. 6.16. 
                     and say to the mountains &amp; rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us from the wrath of the Lambe: But their cry shall be in vain; because heaven and earth shall flee from his wrath, as it is written, Every island fled away,
                     Rev. 16.20. 
                     and the mountains were not found. Whatsoever is given to the elect to the increasing of their glory, all that shall turn to the damned to the increasing of their sorrow. There shall be indeed degrees of punishments: But yet he that feeleth least torment, shall receive no ease thereby. He that is tormented with greater punishments shall envy him that is tormented with lesse. The damned shall receive no ease from this, that some of their kinsmen &amp; friends are received into the heavenly palace: Because the elect shall not grieve at all, that some of their kindred are gone to hell to be tormented for ever. So great shall the pain and torment be in the damned, that their minde can think upon nothing but that whereunto the force of pain driveth them. The damned

shall hate all the creatures of God, they shall hate one another, they shall hate the holy angels, and the elect, and even God himself, but not in himself, and in his own nature, but in the effects of his justice. All the evils of this life are single: One is troubled with poverty, another is tormented with grievous sicknesse; one is oppressed with hard servitude, another is laden with the burthen of reproaches: But there all at once shal be tormented with all evils. The pains there, shall be universall, in all the senses, and in all the members. In this life, hope of release mitigateth all troubles: But there, is left no hope of deliverance. The punishments of hell are not onely eternall, but there is no ease so much as for a moment. And hence it is, that if all men since Adam to this presen

torments, that all fellons and malefactours have ever suffered. O Lord grant unto us, that we may think upon hell, that we never fall into it!

                        Paulinus.
                      In hell there is a raging flame which burneth without end. The life of the damned is to die without end; the death of the damned is to live in eternall torments: For neither is the tormentour wearied,
                        Bernard.
                      neither doth the tormented die. So doth the fire consume there, that still it leaves somewhat; So are the torments there increased, that still they are renewed;

So shall the damned die, that they shall alwayes live: So shall they live,
                        Isidor.
                      that they shall alwayes die. For a man to be tormented without any end, this is it that goes beyond all the bounds of desperation: For what is more grievous, then alwayes to will that which shall never be, and to ni
                        •
                     l that which shall alwayes be? The damned shall never obtain what they would, and shall be constrained ever to suffer what they would not. When the wrath of God shall cease, then shall the torments of the damned cease: But the wrath of God is eternall, and therefore the torments are eternall. When the damned shall truely repent, then they shall be delivered from their sins: But the time of repentance is past, and therefore there remains no hope of indulgence. When the devils shall cease to torment, then shall the damned cease to be tormented: But the furie of the devil shall never cease, therefore the torments of the damned shall never cease. When Gods justice shall be changed, then the torments of the damned shall be changed: But the

justice of God is unchangeable, therefore the torments of the damned shall be eternall.
                        Gregor.
                      The sentence of severe judgement requires, that they should never want punishment, who in this world never want sinne. It is just, th
                        •
                     t there should be no end of the punishment of the damned; because, as long as they could, they would make no end of sinning. The damned sinned in their eternitie, that is, as long as they lived: Therefore it is just that they should be punished in Gods eternitie. Their sinne had an end, because their life had an end: But they would have made no end of sinning, but that they were forced to make end of living, that so they might have sinned without end. The matter of hell-fire is eternall, that is, the stain of sinne: And therefore meet it is that the punishment should be eternall. The filthinesse of the sinnes of the damned can never be removed out of the sight of God: How then can the greatnesse of punishments appointed for sinne be removed? Besides, sinne is an infinite evil; because it is committed against an infinite

good; and Christ paid for it an infinite price: And therefore meet it is that their punishment, who die in their sinnes, should be infinite. Man destroyed in himself the eternall good: And therefore in the judgement of God he doth justly fall into everlasting evil. God at the beginning created man after his own image,
                     Gen. 1.26. that he might live with him for ever: God by Christ reformed man after his own image, when he was fallen into sinne: He hath provided for all, means of eternall salvation; and he hath offered unto all, the reward of eternall life: And therefore it is just, that they which would voluntarily want everlasting rewards, should be made subject to everlasting punishments. An evil will shall never be taken away from the damned: Therefore the punishment of their evil will shall never be taken away from them. The damned made choice of momentanie pleasure &amp; finite goods, before God the infinite good; they longed after the delights of this short and flitting life, rather then the riches of eternall life: It is just therefore

that they should suffer eternall punishments. Oh eternitie not to be termed! Oh eternity not to be measured by any space of time! Oh eternitie not to be conceived by humane understanding! How much dost thou augment the punishments of the damned! After innumerable thousands of yeares they shall be compelled to think, that then is but the beginning of their torments. What a grievous thing is it to lie, though in a very soft bed, for thirtie yeares without moving! And how grievous shall it be then to burn in that lake of brimstone thirtie thousand thousand yeares! Oh eternity, eternity! it is thou alone that dost increase the punishments of the damned beyond all measure.
                        Dionys. Carthus.
                      Grievous is the pain of the damned for the crueltie of the punishments; it is yet more grievous for the diversitie of the punishments; but it is most grievous for the eternitie of the punishments.
                        Gregory in his Morals There shall be death without death, end without end, defect without defect: because death ever liveth, and the end ever beginneth,

and the defect is never deficient. The damned shall seek life, and shall not finde it:Rev. 9.6. 
                     they shall seek death, and it shall flee from them. After an hundred thousand thousand thousand of yeares they shall return without end to the same punishments. Th
                        •
                      thought of the continuance of their sorrow shall torment them more then the sense of outward torment. What can be more miserable then so to die that thou mayest alwayes live, and so to live that thou mayest alwayes die? That life shall be mortiferous, and that death shall be immortall: If it be life, why doth it kill? and if it be death, why doth it alwayes endure? What eternitie is, we do not perfectly know; and it is no wonder: For what created minde can comprehend that which cannot be measured by any time? But if thou wouldest guesse what the space of eternitie is, think upon the time that was before the world was created. If thou canst finde Gods beginning, then mayest thou finde when the punishments of the damned shall have an end. Imagine thou sawest an exceeding high

mountain▪ which for its greatnesse exceeded heaven and earth: Imagine also that some bird every thousandth yeare should carrie from this mountain one grain of the smallest dust: There might be some hope that at length after the end of many incomprehensible thousands of yeares the greatnesse of that mountain might be consumed: But it cannot be hoped that the fire of hell should ever go out. The rewards of the elect shall never be ended; therefore the punishments of the damned shall never be ended: Because as the mercy of God is infinite towards the elect, so the justice of God is infinite towards the reprobate. Imagine that the damned had so many kindes of torments, as there are little drops in the vast sea: Imagine also that at every thousandth yeare some little bird should fly thither, and suck a small drop thereof: There might be some hope that at length the sea would be exhausted and become dry: But it cannot be hoped that the punishments of the damned should ever have an end. O devout soul, think

alwayes upon the eternall punishments of the damned: To think upon hell, preserves a man from falling into hell.
                        Kempis.
                      Have a care to repent, whiles yet there is time for pardon. What else shall the fire devoure but thy sinnes? The more thou heapest up sinnes, the more matter thou layest up for the fire. O Lord Jesus, which by thy passion hast made satisfaction for our sinnes, deliver us from eternall damnation! Amen.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Meditat. LI. Of the spirituall resurrection of the godly.
                  
                     Doth Adam die, Christ in thee live?
                     Christ shall eternall life thee give.
                  
                  CHrists resurrection profits thee nothing, unlesse Christ also rise in thee. As Christ must be conceived, born, and live in thee: So also must he rise in thee. Before resurrection goes death, because none riseth again but he that is fallen: And so it fares in this spirituall resurrection. Christ riseth not in thee, unlesse Adam
                     
first die in thee. The inward man riseth not, unlesse the outward man be first buried. The newnesse of the spirit will not come forth, unlesse the oldnesse of the flesh be first hidden. It is not enough for thee, to have Christ once risen in thee: because the old Adam cannot be extinct in one moment. The old Adam will revive in thee daily: And thou must daily mortifie him, that Christ may begin to live in thee daily. Christ ascended not into heaven, neither entred he into his glory before he rose from death: So neither canst thou enter into celestiall glory, unlesse Christ first rise in thee and live in thee. He is not a member of the mysticall bodie of Christ, in whom Christ liveth not: Neither shall he be brought by Christ into the Church triumphant, who hath not been a member of his bodie in the Church militant. Betrothing goes before matrimonie: And that soul shall not be brought in unto the marriage of the heavenly Lambe, which is not in this life betrothed to Christ by faith,Hos. 2.19. 2. Cor. 1.22. 
                     and sealed by the earnest of

the holy Spirit: Let Christ therefore rise, and live in thee, that thou mayst live with him for ever.Rev. 20.5, 6. 
                     This is the fi

                        st resurrection: Blessed and holy it be that hath part in the first resurrection: over him shall the second death have no power. If thou wilt at the resurrection come forth unto life, Christ must daily rise in thee in this life. At the resurrection of Christ the sunne rose:

                           •
                        . 16.2. So if Christ be spiritually risen in thee, the light of the saving knowledge of God shall rise in thy soul. How can the light of the saving knowledge of God be there, where the darknesse of most grievous sinnes still hath place? The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdome:
                     Psal. 111.1
                           •
                        . How then can heavenly wisdome be there, where the fear of God hath no place? But he that is destitute of the light of divine knowledge in this life, how can he be made partaker of eternall light in the life to come? The sonnes of light onely do passe unto eternall light, but the sonnes of darknesse unto eternall darknesse. Christ at his resurrection triumphed over death: So he, in

whom Christ is spiritually risen,Joh▪ 5.24. 
                     is passed from death to life: For he cannot be overcome by death, in whom Christ the conquerour of death doth live. Christ rising again brought with him perfect righteousnesse:Rom. 4.25 
                     for he died for our sinnes, and rose again for our justification: So he also, in whom Christ is spiritually risen, is justified from his sinnes. For how can sinne have place there, where the perfect righteousnesse of Christ liveth and flourisheth? Now this righteousnesse of Christ is applyed unto us by faith. Christ rising from the dead, got the victory over Satan: for in his descent to hell, he destroyed his kingdome, spoiled his palace, and broke his weapons in pieces: And so also in whomsoever Christ is spiritually risen, against him shall not Satan prevail: for how can he be overcome of Satan, in whom Christ liveth who overcame Satan? At Christs resurrection there was a great earthquake:Mat. 28.2. So the spirituall resurrection with Christ is not without the earnest commotion and contrition of heart. The old Adam cannot

be overcome without striving and resistance: Therefore Christ also cannot rise in thee spiritually without great commotion. There is no spirituall resurrection with Christ, unlesse there be a blotting out of sinne; and there is no blotting out of sinne, unlesse acknowledgement of sinne go before; and there is no true acknowledgement of sinne without serious contrition of heart: Therefore there is no spirituall resurrection of Christ in thee, without inward contrition of heart.

                     O Lord, so shall they live again, and so shall my spirit be quickned: Thou shalt correct me, and thou shalt quicken me. Again, Thou hast cast all my sinnes behinde thy back:
                     17. Behold a spirituall resurrection from sinne! At Christs resurrection an angel of the Lord descended from heaven,
                     Mat. 28.2. 
                     and sat upon the sepulchre: So if Christ be risen in thee spiritually, thou mayest rejoyce in the fellowship of the angels. Where the old Adam lives and reignes, there

is a pleasing bed for the devil: But where Christ liveth and reigneth, there the angels rejoyce to dwell. For it is written,Luke 15.7 
                     There is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth: But where there is true repentance,
                        Luther.
                      there also is Christ risen spiritually, Where Christ is not yet risen spiritually, neither is there yet the grace of God; and where there is not yet the grace of God, neither is there the guard of angels. Where Christ is not yet spiritually risen, there still doth the old Adam reigne; and where the old Adam doth reigne, there doth sinne also yet reigne; and where sinne doth reigne, there the devil doth reigne: And what communion can there be between the blessed angels and the devil? Christ after his resurrection presented himself alive unto his disciples:Luke 24.15. So if thou beest made a partaker of the spirituall resurrection by faith, shew thy self to be a lively member of Christ by love. A man is not judged to be alive, unles he shew forth outwardly the actions of life. Where Christ is, there is also the holy Spirit; where the holy

Spirit is, there he inciteth and moveth to every good work: because they which are led by the Spirit of God,
                     Rom. 8.14 
                     are the sonnes of God. If therefore we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
                     Gal. 5.25. The light of the sunne doth every way disperse the brightnesse of his beams: So the light of faith doth every way diffuse the heat of love. Take light from the sunne, and thou mayest separate love from true faith. Sinnes are dead works: If thou walkest in dead works,
                     Heb. 9.14. how dost thou live in Christ, and Christ in thee? Sinnes belong unto the old Adam: If the old Adam doth still reigne in thee, how art thou spiritually risen with Christ? Sinnes belong to the old flesh: If thou walkest in the old flesh, how doth the new man live in thee? Raise us up, O good Jesus, from the death of sinne, that we may walk in newnesse of life! Let thy death kill the old Adam in us, and let thy resurrection raise up the inward man unto life! Let thy bloud wash us from our sinnes, and let thy resurrection put upon us the robe of righteousnesse!

                  The disposition and method of this daily Practise of pietie.
                  THis Practise of piety is reduced to foure heads, according to the number of the objects about which it is employed: For we must every day weigh and consider with our selves,

                        
                           1 The grievousnesse of our sinnes: and ask pardon thereof for Christs sake.
                        
                           2 GODS benefits: for which we must offer humble and heartie thanksgiving.
                        
                           3 Our own necessities: where we must pray for conservation and increase of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and for a spirituall victory in all tentations.
                        
                           4 Our neighbours necessities: where we must pray for all things needfull for them, for this life, and that which is to come.

                     The Argument.
                     The meditation of our sinnes comprehendeth in it these two heads, of originall and actuall sinnes. Actuall sinnes are committed in thought, word, and deed: By the committing of evil, and by the omitting of good: Against GOD, our neighbour, and our selves The offences of our youth a

                        e many, and our daily infirmities many. We are often tempted of the flesh, and we do often yeeld unto it. We partake many times in other mens sinnes: and in many things we are defective our selves. We are convicted of our sinnes by all the creatures: and we behold the severitie of GODS anger against our sinnes, in the passion and death of CHRIST.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER I. He weigheth and considereth the grievousnesse of originall sinne.
                     
                        HOly God, and just Judge! I know that I was conceived and born in sinne:
                        Psal. 51.5· I know that I was formed of unclean seed in the wombe of my mother:Job 14.4. That poyson of sinne hath so corrupted and putrified my

whole nature, that no facultie of my soul is free from the contagion thereof: That holy pledge of the divine image, which was committed unto me in our first father, is perished in me: There is no power at all in me, to begin to come unto the saving knowledge of thee, the fear of thee, confidence in thee, and love of thee: There remains no sufficiencie in me, to perform obedience unto thy commandments: My will is averse from thy law:
                        Rom. 7.23 and the law of sinne in my members, being repugnant to the law of my minde, makes my whole nature become corrupt and perverse. I wretched and miserable man, do feel the power of sinne cleaving fast to my members: I do feel the yoke of wicked concupiscence grievously pressing me: For although I am regenerate,Titus 2.5. and renewed by the spirit of grace, in the laver of baptisme; yet am I not as yet wholly free from the yoke and captivitie of sinne. For that root of bitternesse, which lieth hidden in me, doth alwayes desire to put forth new branches: The law of sinne reigning in my flesh, doth strive to

captivate me: I am full of doubts, distrust, and desire of mine own honour:Matt 15.19. 
                        Out of my heart proceed wicked cogitations: Filthy thoughts defile me throughout in thy sight: Out of that poysoned fountain flow forth rivers of poyson.Psal. 143.2. 
                        Enter not therefore into judgement with thy servant, O Lord; but be propitious unto me,
                        Psal. 51.1. Psal. 42 8. 
                        according to thy great mercie: The deep of my miserie, calleth upon the deep of thy mercy: For this uncleannesse and filthinesse of my polluted nature, I offer unto thee the most sacred conception of thy Sonne: For me he was born:
                        Isa. 9.6. For me therefore he was conceived. For me he was made sanctification,
                        1. Cor. 1.30. 
                        and righteousnesse: For me therefore he is become purification and cleannesse. Through him, and for him, thy Sonne, have mercy on me, O thou most highest:Psal. 90.8. and set not in the light of thy countenance that hidden corruption that cleaveth to my nature; but look upon thy beloved Sonne my Mediatour, and let his most holy and immaculate conception succour my miserie! Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     PRAYER II. He recalls to our memorie the sinnes of our youth.
                     
                        Psal. 25.7. Jer. 31.34.HOly God, and just Judge! Remember not the offences of my youth, and call to minde no more my sinnes that are past. How many venemous fruits hath the vicious root of concupiscence, that is inherent in me, brought forth! In my childhood what an innumerable brood of actuall transgressions hath the evil of originall sinne hatched!Gen. 6.5. 
                        The very thoughts of my heart are wicked and perverse, even from my childhood; yea, even from my tender infancie: For when I was an infant but of one day, I was in no wise innocent before thee. As many as the dayes of my life are, so many offences do burden me; yea many more by farre in number,Pro. 24.16 seeing that the just man falls seven times in one day: But if the just fall seven times in one day, then I wretched and unjust man, without doubt have fallen seventy times seven times. As my life hath increased, so hath the web of my sinnes increased: and as much as hath been added to

my life by thy bounty; so much hath been added to the course of my sinnes, by the wickednesse of my corrupt nature. I examine my life that is past: and what else do I behold, but a filthy stinking cloke of sinne? I attend unto the light of thy precepts: and what do I finde in the course of my yeares that are past, but darknesse and blindnesse? The tender flower of my youth ought to have been crowned with vertues, and offered to thee for a sweet savour: The best part of my age past did ow it self unto thee the best Creatour of nature: But the dirty filth of my sinnes hath most foully polluted the flower of my age, and the stinking mud of my offences hath in a wonderfull and miserable manner defiled me. The first age of man is amongst all the rest the fittest for the service of God: But I have spent a good part thereof in the service of the devil. The memory of many sinnes, which the unbridled loosenesse of my youth hath committed, is set in my sight: and yet there are many more which I cannot call to memory.Psal. 19.12. 
                        Who knows how oft he offendeth?

cleanse thy servant from secret faults. For these offences of my youth, I offer unto thee (holy Father) the most holy obedience, and perfect innocency of thy Sonne, who was obedient to thee unto death, even the death of the crosse.
                        Phil. 2.8. Luk. 2.42. 
                        When he was but a childe of twelve yeares old, he performed holy obedience unto thee, and began to execute thy will with great alacritie. This obedience I offer unto thee (just Judge) for a price and satisfaction for the manifold disobedience of my youth. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER III. He reckons up our daily falls and slips.
                     HOly God, and just Judge! There is no man innocent in thy sight, no man free from the spot of sinne: And I am bereaved of that glory, which I should bring with me to judgement: I am stripped of that garment of innocencie, with which I ought to appear arayed before thee:Prov. 24.

                        Seven times, yea and oftener every houre I fall: seventie times seven times I sinne every day. The spirit

indeed is sometimes ready; but the flesh is alwayes weak: The inward man flourisheth, and is strong; but the outward man languisheth, and is weak:Rom. 7.19 
                        For I do not the good that I would, but the evil that I would not. How often do vain, wicked, and impious cogitations arise in my heart! How often do vain, unprofitable, and hurtfull words break forth! How often do perverse, wicked, and ungodly actions pollute me! All my righteousnesse is as the cloth of a menstruous woman:
                        Isa. 64 6. Therefore I dare not plead for my righteousnesse before thee: But I humbly prostrate my self before thy most just tribunal, and out of the deeps do I cry unto thee: Lord,
                        Psal. 130.3. Psal. 143·3. 
                        if thou shalt decree to impute sinne, who sh

                           ll abide it? If thou wilt enter into judgement, who shall stand? If thou wilt call me to appear according to the severitie of thy justice, how shall I come before thee?Job 9 3. 
                        If thou wilt exact a strict account of my life, I shall not be able to answer thee one for a thousand: Therefore my mouth is stopt, and I acknowledge before thee, that I have

deserved eternall torments; and withall I confesse with tears, that thou mayst justly cast me into prison for ever. Therefore for these daily sinnes of my life, I offer unto thee (holy Father) the most precious bloud of thy Sonne, which was poured forth on the altar of the crosse, which washeth me from all my sinnes. My sinnes which lead me captive, are many in number, and most powerfull: But the ransome of thy Sonne is much more precious, and of more efficacy: Let that most perfect, plenarie, and holy price payed by Christ, obtain for me remission of sinnes! Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER IIII. He examines our life, according to the rule of the first table of the commandments.
                     HOly God, and just Judge! Thou gavest unto us thy Law in mount Sinai,
                        Exod. 20.1. and thou wouldst have it to be the rule of all our actions, words, and thoughts: That whatsoever is not squared by it, should in thy judgement be accounted sinne.
                     As often as I look upon that most

clear glasse, I perceive mine own filthinesse, and tremble every part of me. I ought to love thee (O my God) above all things: But how often do I love the world, and forget the love of thee! I am bound to fear thee (O my God) above all things: But how often do I consent to sinne, and let thy fear slip out of my memorie! Thou requirest, that I should trust in thee (O my God) above all things: But how often in adversitie doth my soul waver, and anxiously and carefully doubt of thy fatherly goodnesse! I am bound to obey thee (O my God) with all my heart: But how often doth my refractary flesh resist the resolution of obedience,Rom. 7.23 
                        and lead me captive into the prison of sinne! My cogitations ought to be holy, my desires pure and holy: But how often is the quiet state of my minde troubled with vain and impious cogitations! I ought to call upon thee (O God) with all my heart: But how often doth my minde wander in prayer, and doth anxiously doubt, whether her prayers be heard or no! How often am I remisse in prayer, and demisse in conceiving

confidence! How often doth my tongue pray, and yet I do not worship thee in spirit and in truth!Jo

Thou dost daily poure thy benefits upon me in a loving manner▪ and yet I do not daily return unto thee thanksgiving. How cold is my meditation of thy immense and infinite gifts bestowed upon me! What slender devotion is there for the most part in my heart! I use thy gifts, and yet I do not praise thee who art the giver. I stick in the rivers, and come not to the fountain. Thy word is the word of spirit and life:
                        Joh. 6.51. But I through sinne and corruption have destroyed the work of thy holy Spirit within me. The sparks of a good resolution often inkindled, I as often extinguish: and yet I do not sue to thee for increase of thy gifts. For these and all other my sinnes and defaults, I offer unto thee (O my God) the most pure and perfect obedience of thy Sonne, who loved thee in the dayes of his incarnation most perfectly with his whole heart, and cleaved unto thee most firmly with

all his soul: in whose deeds, words, and thoughts, there was found no blot of sinne,Isa. 53.9. nor spot of the least offence. That which I want, by faith I draw from his fulnesse: Therefore for this thy wel-beloved Sonnes sake, have mercy Lord upon thy servant▪

to forgive him! How often am I solicited by my flesh, to anger, hatred, envy and brawling! How often doth the fire of my angry heart burn within me, although contentious words be not heard without! Thy holy will requires that I should live chastly, modestly, and temperately: But how often hath the love of drunkennesse and lust, made my soul captive to sinne! How often do fires of lust flame within me, although my outward members be restrained!Mat. 5.28. 
                        He that looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart, saith the Text: How often therefore in the sight of God do we commit adultery! The inordinate and immoderate use of meat, drink, and wedlock, often steals upon us, and makes us appear guilty before thee, if thou wouldest enter into judgement with us. Thy holy Writ requireth, that in bargaining I deceive not my neighbour in any sort; but that I rather further, and procure his good; that I traduce not his faults, but rather cover them with the cloke of charitie; and that

I do not censure him rashly and unadvisedly: But how often do I seek mine own profit by injustice! How often do I spend my judgement rashly upon my neighbour! Thy holy will requires, that my spirit, minde, and soul be free from concupiscence: But how often doth my flesh solicite me to sinne, and contaminateth my spirit with wicked concupiscences! As a fountain doth abound with continuall bubbling of water: So doth my heart alwayes swell with evil concupiscence.

How often do I neglect freely and boldly to chide him, when he sinnes! How often do I, being hindred either by favour or fear, reprove him for his sinnes more slightly then I ought!

                        ours. For a man to pray for himself, it is a duty of necessity: But to pray for the salvation of his neighbour, it is a deed of charity: As often therefore as I neglect to pray for the salvation of my neighbour, so often I condemne my self for the breach of the commandment of the love of my neighbour. My neighbour dies the death of the body, and sorrow fills all with lamentation and mourning; when as yet the death of the body brings no hurt to a godly man, but rather gives him a passage into a celestiall countrey: My neighbour dies the death of the soul, and behold. I am nothing troubled at it: I see him die, and grieve not at all; when as yet sinne is the true death of the soul, and brings with it the losse of the inestimable grace of God and eternall life. My neighbour delinquisheth against the king, who can onely kill the body; and behold, I seek by all means his reconciliation: but he sinneth against the King of all kings,Mat. 10.28. 
                        that can cast both body and

soul into hell-fire: and yet I behold it in security, and consider not that this offence is an infinite evil.
                     My neighbour stumbles at a stone; and I runne presently to save him from a fall, or otherwise to raise him up, if he be fallen: He stumbles at the corner-stone of our salvation; and behold I securely passe by it,Psal. 118.22. and labour no

                     HOly God, and just Judge! If I look up to heaven, I think with my self, that I have many wayes offended thee my God and Father:Luke 15.18. 
                        I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, I am not worthy to be called thy sonne.
                        19. If I look down upon the earth, I think with my self, how I have abused thy creatures by my sinnes: I have infinitely abused not onely the darknesse of the night, but also the light of the day to work works of darknesse. If I look upon the examples of sinners, upon whom thou in thy just judgement hast inflicted punishment, I finde that the weight of my sins will counterpoise theirs. If I look upon the examples of the saints, I finde that I come farre short of them in my holy service of thee. If I think upon the angel my keeper, I finde that often I put him to flight by my sinnes. If I think of the devils, I finde that I have often given place to their suggestions. If I weigh

with my self the rigour of thy law, I finde that my life is many wayes irregular. If I look upon my self, I finde that the very cogitations of my heart do accuse me before thy judgement. If I think upon the houre of death to come, I finde that it is the just reward of my sinnes,
                        Rom. 6.23 and (unlesse thou of thy meere mercie for Christ his sake shalt receive me) the gate and entrance into everlasting death. If I think upon the judgement to come, I finde my deserts such, that thou mayst justly call me to the most exact account, and punish my sinnes according to the strict severitie of thy law. If I think upon hell, I finde that I have deserved by my sinnes the most just punishment there. If I think upon eternall life, I finde that I have by my sinnes justly fallen away from all hope of attainment. All things therefore convince me of my sinnes: Onely thou, O my God, be not thou extreme against me! To Christ thy beloved Sonne my onely Mediatour I betake my self: By him I most firmly beleeve I shall obtain thy grace and remission of my sinnes.

Thy creatures accuse me; the book of my conscience accuseth me; both the tables of thy divine law accuse me; Satan accuseth me day and night: But take thou upon thee my patronage, O sweet Jesus! To thee the poore man is left, bereft of all solace of the creatures. All my refuge is placed in thy satisfaction for my sinnes, and in thy intercession at the right hand of the Father for me. My soul, take thou the wings of the morning, and, like a dove, hide thy self in the clefts of the rock, that is,Cant. 2.14 in the wounds of Christ thy Saviour. Hide thy self in this rock, till the anger of the Lord be passed by: and thou shalt finde rest, and thou shalt finde protection, and thou shalt finde deliverance therein. Amen.

                     HOly God, and just Judge! My heart is contrite and humbled, my spirit is heavy and in a great strait, by reason of the burden of

my sinnes wherewith I am oppressed. The courage of my heart hath failed, and the sharpnesse of my eyes is decayed. My heart is pressed, and from thence gush out tears: My spirit is oppressed, and I forget to take my bread: My heart is wounded, and from thence gusheth out bloud, and a fountain of tears.

My heart that is in a great strait sigheth unto thee: O thou true joy, give unto me peace and quietnesse of heart, that being justified by faith,

Now the immense and innumerable benefits of God may be divided according to three articles of our Christian faith; God hath created, redeemed, and sanctified us. He heapeth his benefits on us in this life, and hath promised greater unto us in the life that is everlasting. He conferres upon us the gifts of the minde, of the body, and of fortune, which we call externall goods. He preserveth us from evil, and conserveth

                        Thou hast given me life and mercy, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. This thy great mercy bestowed upon me, I will celebrate with perpetuall praises. Thy goodnesse I will sing of in continuall songs.Psal. 139.13 
                        Thou didst protect me in my mothers wombe. I will confesse unto thee: For I am wonderfully formed:
                        14 
                        Marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.
                        15 
                        My bones are not hid from thee, which thou didst make in secret, and deckedst me with divers members in the lower parts of the earth.
                        16 
                        Thy eyes saw me yet being imperfect, and in thy book were all my members written, which day by day were fashioned when as yet there were none of them.
                        17 
                        How precious unto me are thy thoughts, O God! how great is the summe of them!
                        18 
                        If I go about to reckon them, I finde them multiplied above the sands of the sea.
                        
Thou didst shew thy mercy unto me before I understood it: Thou didst prevent me with thy blessings before I did desire them: Thy bounty did embrace me on every side, before I could give thanks for it. Thou art he who not onely didst form me wonderfully in the wombe, but also didst take me out: Thou art my hope even from my mothers breast: Out of my mothers wombe I was cast upon thee: Thou art my God from my mothers wombe. As often as I think upon many that have been extinct, and never came to the light of this life: So often I admire and praise thee for thy mercy, which brought me out of that prison into the theatre of this world safe and sound. How many yeares are past in which I was not, and yet thou didst erect for me this house of my body, and didst bring me out of that bottomlesse pit, and the darknesse of my mothers wombe! Thou gavest unto me a reasonable soul: Thou madest me a man, not a stone, or a serpent. To thee (O my God) for this thy mercy be honour and glory for ever! Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     PRAYER II. He renders thanks for our sustentation.
                     I Render thanks unto thee, Almighty and mercifull God, for that thou hast sustained me from the very first dayes of my life. Naked I came into this world, and thou coveredst me most graciously. Hungry I entred into this world, and thou hast hitherto fed me most bountifully. In thee I live, move, and have my being: Without thee I fall again into nothing, and die. Through thee I bowe, and move my members: Without thee I can neither be partaker of life, or motion. Thine is the sunne that giveth me light,
                        Mat. 5.45. which I see daily with mine eyes. Thine is the aire which I draw in with continuall breath. The night is thine, and the day is thine, whose intercourses serve for my labour and rest. Thine is the earth, whose fruits do nourish me most plentifully. Every creature in heaven, aire, earth, and sea is thine, and is appointed for my use and service. Silver is thine,
                        Hag. 2.8. 
                        and gold is thine. Whatsoever is necessary for

the sustentation of this my present life, all that I receive from thy most liberall and bountifull hands. O God, how liberall art thou to mankinde
                           •
                         All things thou createdst long ago for the use of man: All things thou dost as yet preserve for the good of man. Whatsoever thou, of thine infinite goodnesse, affordest to the other creatures, thou affordest also unto me; for as much as thou dost wonderfully form, furnish, and conserve them for my sake. Some of the creatures serve to obey me; some to nourish me; some to clothe me; some to cure me; some to chastise me: But all of them to teach and inform me. Who can reckon up those divers kindes of nutriments, which thou hast created, and dost as yet produce out of the earth unto this day to nourish us? Who can enumerate those divers species of herbs which thou dost every yeare cause the earth to bring forth, to cure us? Who can in words comprehend those sundry kindes of living creatures, which were made for mans use, and do yet all serve him? To

thee be praise and honour for ever, who art the Creatour and Conserver of all things! Without thee the true sunne, I should vanish away as doth the shadow: Without thee the true life, I should presently depart out of this life: Without thee the true being, I should suddenly fall to nothing. To thee onely is due, that I live, move, and have my being. Therefore to thee alone will I live and adhere for ever. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER III. He renders thanks for our redemption wrought by Christ.
                     I Ow unto thee (O eternall and Almighty God) most heartie thanks for that thou hast created me when I was nothing: But much more for that thou hast redeemed me when I was lost and condemned. I did hang in the jaws of hell: And thou didst pluck me out by the bloud of thy Sonne.
                        Col. 1.14. I was the slave of Satan: but thy grace hath delivered me out of the power of the devil, and translated me into the kingdome

of Christ. I ow my self wholly unto thee: because thou createdst me wholly. My tongue ought alwayes to praise thee: because thou gavest it unto me. My mouth ought alwayes to set forth thy praise: because the aire and breath which it drawes is thine. My heart ought alwayes to cleave unto thee with perpetuall love: because thou didst form it. All my members ought to be ready for thy service: because thou didst wonderfully frame them, how many and how great soever they be. But if I ow my self wholly unto thee, because thou createdst me: What shall I repay unto thee for redeeming me out of slavery and captivity! The lost sheep thou hast delivered out of the claws of the infernall wolf. The fugitive slave thou hast pluckt out of the prison of the devil. The lost groat thou hast sought out with great carefulnesse.Luk. 15.8. In Adam I fell, and thou hast erected me: In Adam I was captivated in the bonds of sinne, but thou hast set me at liberty: In Adam I was lost, and again thou hast saved me. What am I worm,

that thou shouldest be so solicitous for redeeming me? What am I worm that thou shouldest be so prodigally bountifull for saving me? If thou hadst altogether cast off our first parents after their fall, and hadst thrown them with all their posteritie out from the presence of thy glory into the lowest pit of hell, there is none of us could justly complain of any wrong done unto him: For they had received, and we had received for our deeds a just reward. What else could we have desired or expected from thee, who createdst us after thine own image, and furnishedst us with power and sufficiencie to have kept our innocencie. But in this thou didst manifest thy incomprehensible and unspeakable love towards us, in that thou didst promise unto our first parents after their fall, thy Sonne for their Redeemer,Gal. 4.4. 
                        and in the fulnesse of time didst send him unto us, to call us from death to life, from sinne to righteousnesse, and from the infernall pit unto celestiall glorie. O thou lover of man, whose delight is with the sonnes of men,
                        Prov. 8.3
                              •
                           
                        
                        
who can worthily set forth the praise of thy love to man? Yea, who can in minde conceive the worthines thereof? These are the incomprehensible riches of thy goodnesse: This is the infinite treasure of thy gifts which the slendernesse of our capacitie and understanding cannot conceive. Was a servant so deare unto thee, that thy Sonne must be delivered to death for his redemption! Was an enemie so much to be beloved, that thou shouldest appoint thy most beloved Sonne to be his redeemer! My soul is astonisht with the very consideration of this thy goodnesse▪

                     PRAYER IIII. He rendreth thanks for the incarnation of the Sonne.
                     I Render thanks unto thee, Jesu Christ, thou alone Mediatour, and Redeemer of mankinde, for that thou hast in the fulnesse of time personally united unto thee the true humane nature,Gal. 4.4. and hast vouchsafed to be born of a Virgin. How great is thy love to man,Isa. 7.14. Heb. 2.16. 
                        in that thou didst not assume the

nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham!1. Tim. 3.16. How great is the mystery of godlinesse, that thou being very God, wouldest be made manifest in the flesh! How great is the inclination of thy pity, that descending from heaven for my sake, thou hast endured to be born of a Virgin! For me most vile creature, Creatour Almighty, thou art become man. For me most abject servant, most glorious Lord, thou hast put on the shape of a servant, that by taking flesh upon thee, thou mightest set my flesh at libertie. To me thou art born:Isa. 9.6. Whatsoever celestiall good therefore thou bringest with thee in thy Nativitie, shall be mine. To me thou art given: And therefore all things with thee. My nature in thee is more glorified, then it was in Adam dishonoured: For thou dost assume it into the Unitie of thy Person, whereas it was weakened with accidentall corruption onely by Satan. Thou art flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone.
                        Eph. 5.30. Thou art my brother: And what canst thou deny unto me, seeing thou art most nearly joyned unto me in the same

flesh and affection of brotherly love? Thou art the Bridegroom, who according to the good pleasure of thy heavenly Father, hast coupled unto thee by a personall league, the humane nature, as a spouse: To the joy of those nuptials I do proclaim and thankfully acknowledge that I my self am invited.Mat. 22.2. I wonder now no more that the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them were made for man by God, seeing that God himself would for man become man. Thou canst not utterly divorce me, and cast me away from thee, seeing that thou canst not deny that thou art a man, and therefore my brother. Thou canst not altogether forget me, because thou hast graven me in thine own hands:
                        Isa. 49.16. For the very communion of the flesh doth daily and continually put thee in minde of me. Thou canst not altogether forsake me, seeing that it hath pleased thee to conjoyn unto thee the humane nature, in a most neare bond of personall union. Although therefore my sinnes do hinder me, yet the communion of nature doth not

repell me. I will adhere wholly unto thee, because thou hast wholly assumed me wholly. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER V. He renders thanks for Christs passion.
                     HOw great thanks do I ow unto thee, O most holy Jesu, for that thou hast taken upon thee the punishment of my sinnes, and hast endured hunger, thirst, cold, wearinesse, reproches, persecutions, sorrows, povertie, bonds, whips, pricking of thorns; yea, and that most bitter death of the crosse for me sinner! How great is the flame of thy love which forced thee of thine own accord to throw thy self into that sea of passions, and that for me most vile and unthankfull servant! Thy innocency and righteousnesse made thee free from all sufferings: But thy infinite and unspeakable love made thee debter and guilty in my room. It is I that trespassed, and thou makest satisfaction. It is I that committed rapine, and thou makest restitution. It is I that sinned, and thou undergoest the passion. O Jesu most benigne, I acknowledge the bowels of

thy mercy and the fiery heat of love. Thou seemest to love me more then thy self, seeing thou deliverest up thy self for me. O most innocent Jesu, what hast thou to do with the sentence of death? O thou most beautifull amongst the sonnes of men, what hast thou to do with spittings upon thee? O thou most righteous, what hast thou to do with whips and bonds? These things belong not unto thee: They are all due unto me: But thou of thine unspeakable love didst descend into the prison of this world, and take upon thee the shape of a servant, and most willingly undergo the punishment that was due unto me. I was for my sinnes to be adjudged to the lake that burneth with everlasting fire: But thou by the fire of love being burnt upon the altar of the crosse, dost free me from it. I was to be cast away for my sinnes from the face of my heavenly Father: And thou for my sake complainest that thou art forsaken of thy heavenly Father.Matt. 27.46. I was to be tormented of the devil and his angels for ever: And thou of thine infinite love dost deliver thy

self unto the ministers of Satan to be afflicted and crucified for me. As many instruments as I see of thy passion, so many tokens do I see of thy love towards me: For my sinnes are those bonds, those whips, and those thorns which afflicted thee, all which of thine unspeakable love thou enduredst for me. Thy love was not yet satisfied with taking my flesh upon thee: but thou wouldest make it as yet more manifest, by that most bitter passion of thy soul and bodie. Who am I, most mighty Lord, that for me disobedient servant, thou thy self wouldst become a servant so many yeares? Who am I, most beautifull Bridegroom, that for me the most filthy vassal of sinne, and whore of the devil, thou hast not refused to die? Who am I, most bountifull Creatour, that for me most vile creature, thou hast not been afraid of the passion of the crosse? I am to thee, most loving Bridegroom, the true spouse of bloud, for whom thou dost poure forth such plenty of bloud. I am to thee, most beautifull Lily, a thorn indeed that is full of prickles. It is

I that laid upon thee a heavy and sharp burthen, with the weight whereof thou wast so squeezed, that drops of bloud did distill abundantly from thy sacred bodie. To thee, Lord Jesu, my alone Redeemer and Mediatour, for this thine unspeakable love will I sing praises for ever. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER VI. He renders thanks for our calling by the word.
                     VNto thee, O Lord my God, is most due, all praise, honour, and thanksgiving, for that thou wouldest by the preaching of thy word make manifest unto us that thy Fatherly will, and determinate counsel concerning our salvation. By nature we are darknesse;Eph. 5.8. Luk. 1.79 we sit in darknesse, and in the region of the shadow of death: But thou by the most clear light of the Gospel dost dispell this darknes. In thy light do we see light;Psal. 36.11. John 1.9. that is, in the light of thy word we see that true light that lighteneth every one that cometh into this world. What use were there of a treasure that is hid, and a light that is put under a bushel?
                        Mat. 5.15.
                        
I do therefore declare with thankfulnesse that great benefit, in that thou hast by the word of thy Gospel revealed unto us that treasure of benefits in thy Sonne.Isa. 52.7. Nah. 1.15 
                        How beautifull are the feet of those that bring good tidings, and tell of salvation! This peace of conscience, and salvation of the soul, by the preaching of the Gospel thou dost yet declare unto us,Rom. 10.15. and call us unto the kingdome of thy Sonne. I was led into the by-paths of errours, as it were a weak and miserable sheep: But thou hast called me into the way again by the preaching of thy word. I was condemned, and utterly lost: But thou in the word of thy Gospel dost offer unto me the benefits of Christ; and in the benefits of Christ, thy grace; and in thy grace, remission of sinnes; and in remission of sinnes, righteousnesse; and in righteousnesse, salvation and life everlasting. Who can sufficiently in words expresse those bowels of thy mercy? yea, who can in minde conceive the greatnesse, &amp; the riches of thy goodnesse?Rom. 11.25. The mysterie of our salvation kept secret from eternitie, by the manifestation

of thy Gospel thou dost lay open unto us. The counsels which thou hadst concerning our peace before the foundations of the world were laid, thou dost reveal unto us by the preaching of thy word,
                        Psal. 119.105. which is a lantern unto our feet, whiles we go through this darksome valley int

                         light everlasting. What had it profited us to have been born, unlesse by Christ thou hadst delivered us when we were captivated through sinne? What had it profited us to have been redeemed, unlesse thou hadst by thy word declared unto us the great benefit of our redemption? Thou dost spread forth thy hands unto us all the day.
                        Isa. 65.2. Rev. 3.20. Thou knockest at the gate of our heart every day, and callest us all unto thee by thy word. O Lord most benigne, how many thousand thousands of men do live in the blindenesse of Gentilisme, and in errours and have not seen that light of thy heavenly word which thy bounty hath granted us of all men most unthankfull! Alas, how often through our contempt and unthankfulnesse do we deserve that thou shouldest take

from us the candlestick of thy word! But thou of thy long patience dost make as if thou sawest not our sinnes;Rev. 2.5. Wisd. 11.23. and of thy unspeakable mercy dost yet continue unto us that most holy pledge, and most precious treasure of thy word. For which thy great benefit we render unto thee eternall thanks, and we humbly beseech thee to continue it still unto us. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER VII. He renders thanks unto God for the expectation of our conversion.
                     I Render unto thee, most mercifull Father, immortall thanks, for that thou wouldest with so great patience and long-suffering expect my conversion; and hast brought me out of the path of sinne, unto the fellowship of thy kingdome. How great is thy long-suffering,
                        Rom. 2.4. that thou hast not cast me away from thy face, and thrust me down into everlasting torments, whereas I have deserved it a thousand times! How many thousands hath death prevented before they could attain unto true repentance! How many sinners hath the devil

made obstinate, that they might not obtain forgivenesse of their sinnes! There was no distinction in nature between me and them; onely thy goodnesse and long-suffering: My offence was no lesse then theirs; but thy grace did abound. Thy mercie strove with my miserie: I went on in my sinne; and thou didst go on in thy mercy: I deferred my conversion; and thou didst deferre my punishment: I went astray; and thou didst call me: I refused to come; and still thou didst expect me. This thy goodnesse, most indulgent Father, I cannot extoll with sufficient praises. This thy long patience, most mercifull God, I cannot recompense with any merits. Thou didst preserve me from many sinnes, whereinto the corruption of the flesh, the deceit of the world, and the perswasion of the devil, would have thrown me headlong as well as others. Neither hast thou onely kept me from falling into sinne; but also hast most graciously expected my conversion from sinne, into which I had fallen. I finde thee more mercifull then I am sinfull: I sinned; and

thou madest as if thou didst not see it: I contained not my self from wickednesse; and yet thou didst abstain from punishment.
                           Bernard in his 2 Serm. of the seven loavesI did long time prolong my iniquity, and thou didst prolong thy pitie. What were then my deserts? Surely evil, and the worst of evils, to wit, my sinnes, many in number, most grievous for weight, and detestable for varietie. Therefore to thy grace and bountie alone do I attribute it, that thou hast so long expected my conversion, and delivered my soul out of the snares of

                     I Render thanks unto thee, my God, for that thou hast converted my heart that was hard, and knew not how to repent; and for that thou hast taken from me my stony heart, and given me an heart of flesh. I had of my self power to sinne: But I had not of my self power to rise again to repentance. I could go astray of

my self: But I could not return again into the way without thee.
                           Grana. in the 2 book of the life of Chr. chap. 2. For even as he that is born crooked from his mothers wombe, cannot be made straight by naturall means, but onely by divine and supernaturall power▪ So my soul being by nature crooked and prone to sinne, and the love of earthly things, could by no humane power, but thy grace onely, be rectified, and lifted up to the love of thee, and heavenly things. I could deform my self by my sinnes most foully: But thou onely couldst reform me. As the Ethiopian cannot change his skinne,

                            neither can I do that which is good, being by nature addicted unto the love of that which is evil. Thou my God didst convert me, and I was converted; and when I was converted,
                        Jer. 31.19 
                        then I repented; and when I was instructed, then I smote my thigh.
                        Eph. 2.5. 
                        I was dead in sinne: And thou didst quicken me. As much power as a dead man hath to raise himself: So much had I to convert my self. Unlesse thou hadst drawn me, I had never come unto thee; unlesse

thou hadst stirred me up, I had never watched unto thee; unlesse thou hadst illuminated me, I had never seen thee. My sinnes were more sweet unto me then hony and the hony-combe: But I am to thank thee, that now they are sharp and bitter unto me; for thou hast given me a spirituall taste. The works of vertue were more bitter unto me then gall and aloes: But I am to thank thee, that now they are become pleasant and sweet; for thou hast by thy Spirit changed the corrupt judgement of my flesh.Isa. 53.6. 
                        I went astray as a sheep that is lost, and declined to the way of iniquitie: But thou,
                           Grana. out of August. meditations. which art the good shepherd, hast found me out, and brought me again unto the flock of thy saints. It was late ere I knew thee; for there was a great and darksome cloud of vanitie before mine eyes, which would not suffer me to see the light of the truth: It was late ere I saw the true light; because I was blinde and loved blindnesse, and walked through the darknesse of sinne, into the darknesse of hell: But thou hast illuminated me; thou

soughtest me, when I sought not thee; thou calledst me, when I called not upon thee; thou convertedst me, when I was not converted unto thee; and thou saidst with a most powerfull voice, Let there be light in the inward parts of his heart, and there was a light; and I saw thy light, and I knew mine own blindnesse. For this thy immense and infinite benefit, I will praise thy name for ever and ever. Amen.

                     I Ow and render unto thee, eternall and mercifull God, great thanks, for that thou hast not rejected me when I came unto thee,
                        Joh. 6.37 but diddest most readily receive me, and most mercifully forgive me all my sinnes. I was that prodigall sonne, most indulgent Father, I was that prodigall sonne,
                        Luke 15.13. that by living riotously wasted his Fathers substance: For I have defiled the gifts of nature; I have refused the gifts of grace; I have deprived my self of the gifts of glory. I was naked and destitute of

all good things: and thou coveredst and enrichedst me with the robe of righteousnesse: I was lost and condemned: and thou of thy free grace hast bestowed upon me eternall salvation. Thou of thine ardent mercy didst embrace me and kisse me, in sending thy most beloved Sonne that is in thy bosome; and thy holy Spirit,Joh. 1.13. which is the kisse of thy mouth,
                        Cant. 1.2. as ample witnesses of thine infinite love. Thou clothedst me with my first robe, in restoring me my former innocencie. Thou gavest me a ring for my hand, by sealing me with thy Spirit of grace.Eph. 6.25. Thou didst put shoes upon my feet, by arming me with the Gospel of peace.
                        Luke 15.23. Thou killedst the fat calf for me, by delivering thy most deare Sonne to death for me. Thou didst cause me to feast and make merrie, by restoring the joy of heart, and the true peace of conscience unto me. I was dead; and through thee I was restored to life: I went astray; and through thee I came again into the way: I was consumed with povertie; and through thee I entred again into my former possession.

Thou mightest in thy just judgement have rejected me, seeing that I was polluted with so many sinnes, covered with so many offences, and corrupted with so many iniquities: But thy mercy did abound above my sinnes;Rom. 5.21 thy goodnesse was greater then mine iniquity. How often have I shut the gate of my heart when thou diddest knock! Therefore when I knocked thou mightest most justly have shut the doore of mercy against me. How often have I stopt mine eares, that I might not heare thy voice! Therefore when I sighed unto thee, thou mightest most justly have stopped thine eares, and not hearkened unto my voice. But thy grace was more abundant then all my sinne and transgression. Thou didst receive me with thy hands spread forth,
                        Isa. 65.2. and put away mine iniquities as it were a cloud,Isa. 38.17. and cast all my sinnes behinde thy back. Thou remembrest my sinnes no more, but receivest me into the most ample bosome of thy mercy. For this thy inestimable benefit, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     PRAYER X. He renders thanks unto God for conserving us in that which is good.
                     
                        TO thee Lord, be honour and glorie, and blessing,
                        Rev. 6.12. 
                        and thanksgiving: for that thou hast not onely in mercy received me upon my repentance; but also hast enabled me to abstain from sinne, and live more reformedly. What should it profit a man, to be free from his sicknesse, and presently to fall into a worse relapse? What should it profit, to be absolved from sinnes past, unlesse grace be conferred to lead a godly life? Thou, God most faithfull, hast shewed all the parts and offices of a faithfull and skilfull Physician in the cure of my souls wounds. My wounds were deadly, and thou didst cure them by the wounds of thy Sonne: But there was cause to fear, that the wounds that were healed might wax raw again: And thou by the grace of thy holy Spirit, as it were a fomentation, hast hindred it. How many be

those, that after remission of sinnes obtained, return again to their former course of life, and reiterating their sinnes, more grievously offend God! Alas, how many do we see, that being freed from the yoke of sinne, return to their former captivitie, and being brought out of the spirituall Egypt, look back again to the pots! They have fled from the pollutions of the world,
                        2. Pet. 2.20.22. 
                        by the knowledge of Christ, and do wallow again in the same, by repeating the former conversation of their most wicked life. They were freed out of the bonds of Satan by their conversion, and again are held entangled in the same, by the delusion of wicked spirits: Surely, their latter end is worse then their beginning:2 Pet. 2.21. 
                        And it had been better for them never to have known the way of righteousnesse, then having known it, to turn away from the path of the holy commandments, which were delivered unto them. These are the dogs that return again to their vomit;
                        22. 
                        and sowes that after their washing, wallow again in the mire. Whatsoever hath happened unto

them, might have happened unto me; but that it hath pleased thee by the grace of thy power, and the efficacie of thy holy Spirit, to enable me to continue in that which is good. The same wicked spirit that vanquished them, assaulted me: The same world that seduced them, enticed me: The same flesh that overcame them, allured me. Onely thy grace protected me against their assaults, and furnished me with power sufficient for victory. Thy strength was powerfull in my weaknes:
                        2. Cor. 12▪ 9. From thee the strength of the Spirit descended, with which I was enabled to bridle the assaults of the flesh. Whatsoever good there is in me, it descends all from thee, who art the fountain of all good: for in me by nature there is nothing but sinne. Therefore as many good works as I finde in me, which notwithstanding are impure and imperfect, by reason of my flesh; so many gifts they are of thy grace, I must needs confesse. For this thine inestimable gift conferred upon me, I will give thee thanks for ever. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     PRAYER XI. He renders thanks for all the gifts of the soul and bodie, and for externall goods.
                     I Render unto thee, eternall and mercifull God, as it is most due, eternall thanks: for that thou hast not onely made me a bodie and a soul; but moreover hast furnished me with sundry gifts of the soul and bodie, and also with externall goods. Thou which art wisdome it self, teachest man all knowledge:Psal. 94.10 If therefore I know any good, it is a demonstration of thine abundant grace towards me. Without thy light, my minde is darksome: Without thy grace, my will is captive. If there be in me either any wit or prudence, it is all to be attributed to thy clemencie. Wisdome is the eye of the soul, and divine grace is the eye of wisdome. Whatsoever we know, we know either by the light of nature, or by the revelation of thy word: But from thee, O thou light of eternall wisdome, doth the illumination of nature spring: From thee also doth the

revelation of the word come: Therefore whatsoever we know, descendeth unto us as thy gift. Thou, O indeficient fountain of life, art my life, and the length of my dayes. Thou, O eternall health it self, art the strength of my body, and the vigour of my vertue. Man liveth not by bread onely,
                        Mat. 4.41 
                        but by every word that proceedeth out of thy mouth: So then man is not preserved in health and strength by bread onely; neither is he preserved from diseases by physick onely: but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Tranquillitie of the minde preserveth the health of the bodie: And true godlinesse begetteth tranquillitie of the conscience. From thee (O thou chief good) all true godlinesse, all tranquillitie of the minde without disturbance, and all wished-for health of body doth come. Moreover, whatsoever externall good I do possesse, all that I ow unto thy liberality and bounty. A crust of bread is not due unto my deserts: How much lesse then are all these externall goods which thou dost heap upon

me? They are called indeed the gifts of fortune: But they are in deed and in truth the gifts of thy grace. There is nothing more blessed then to do good, and to be liberall to others: and thou hast made me partaker of this blessednesse, by bestowing liberally these outward goods upon me. Thou hast sowed in me the seed of thy grace, that from thence there may arise to others an harvest of liberality and beneficency. Thou hast committed many things unto me, as unto a steward, that I might have wherewithall to do good to my fellow-servants. From thee the fountain of all good, there descends upon me streams of goods: Whatsoever I am, whatsoever I possesse, whatsoever I bestow, depends all, I confesse, upon thy bounty. For this thine inestimable mercy, I will give thee thanks for ever. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     PRAYER XII. He renders thanks for the sacrament of Baptisme.
                     TO thee, O eternall and mercifull God, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, I render humble tha
                           ••
                        s, for that thou hast washed me in the holy laver of baptisme from all my sinnes: and for that thou hast received me into the covenant of grace, and made me an heir of everlasting life. I acknowledge it is thy gift that I was born of Christian parents, and by them brought unto this heavenly fount. How many thousands of infants are born in Gentilisme, and without this sacrament do die in their sinnes! There is no difference in nature between me &amp; them: Onely thy superabundant grace hath made a difference. I was joyned with them in communion of sinne: But I was separated from them by participation of thy grace. How great is this thy goodnesse, that thou diddest finde me,Matt. 7.
                              •
                           . when I sought thee not; that thou didst heare me, before I asked; that thou didst open unto me,

before I knockt. This thy mercie exceeds all praise, yea and all admiration.Mat. 28.19. I was baptized in thy holy name, thy name for me was called upon: Therefore I am received into the heavenly family, being made the sonne of my heavenly Father, the brother of Christ, and the temple of the holy Ghost. This is an holy and heavenly laver: In it therefore I am washed and purged from all my uncleannesse. It is the laver of regeneration and renovation: By it therefore I am regenerated &amp; renewed by the grace of the holy Ghost. Whatsoever Christ my Saviour merited by his most holy obedience, &amp; by the effusion of his most precious bloud; of all that he hath left the saving fount of baptisme as a pledge. Therefore the conferring of baptisme, is the besprinkling of the bloud of Christ. That precious bloud of Christ doth make me clean from all my sinnes,
                        1. Joh. 17 
                        and makes me whiter then snow in the sight of God.Psal. 51.7. O eternall God, thou hast made an eternall covenant with me in baptisme; unto which I have alwayes recourse by true and serious

repentance. Thou hast betrothed me unto thee for ever in judgement and righteousnesse, in grace and mercy:Hos. 2.19. Thou hast given me an earnest and pledge of thy Spirit in baptisme:Eph. 1.14. Therefore thou wilt not cast me away from thy face; but being mindefull of thy promise, thou wilt lead me into the joyes of the celestiall marriage. As at the baptisme of Christ my Mediatour and head, the heavens were opened:Mat. 3.16. So by the communion of the same baptisme, thou hast opened unto me the gate of paradise. As at the baptisme of Christ, the holy Ghost descended upon him, and a voice from heaven did testifie that he was the beloved Sonne of God: So by the same communion of the same baptisme, I am made a partaker of the holy Ghost, and adopted to be a sonne of God. For which inestimable benefit, I will give thanks unto thee, my God, for ever. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     PRAYER XIII. He renders thanks for the sacrament of the Lords supper.
                     HOw great thanks do I ow unto thee, most high God, for that in the most sacred mystery of the supper, thou dost feed me with the bodie and bloud of thy Sonne! What is there in heaven or in earth of more price and excellency, then that body which is united to thy Sonne personally? What more certain testimonie and pledge of thy grace can there be, then the precious bloud of thy Sonne poured out for my sinnes, on the altar of the crosse? The very price of my redemption thou bestowest upon me, that I may have a most certain testimony of thy grace towards me. As often as I fall through my sinnes from the covenant of baptisme: So often by true repentance, and the saving use of this supper, I am restored unto it again. It is a sacrament of the new Testament, and it alwayes enriches me with new gifts of the Spirit. In this body life it self dwells,

and therefore it refresheth me, and quickneth me unto everlasting life. By the effusion of this bloud, satisfaction is made for our sinnes: And therefore by the drinking thereof, the remission of my sinnes is confirmed unto me. Christ saith it, Truth it self saith it;Joh. 6.54. 
                        Whosoever shall eat my flesh, and drink my bloud, hath eternall life, and I will raise him up at the last day, that is, to the life of glory.50▪
                         For this is the bread of life which descended from heaven, that whosoever shall eat thereof, may not die, but have everlasting life. It is the eating by faith that Christ so commends, which must needs be added unto the sacramentall eating, that so that which was appointed to life, may be received by us unto life. I come therefore with true faith unto this heavenly banquet, being firmly perswaded, that the body which I eat, was delivered unto death for me, and the bloud which I drink, was poured forth for my sinnes. I cannot in any wise doubt of the remission of my sinnes, when as it is confirmed by the participation of the price which

was offered for my sinnes. I cannot in any wise doubt of Christ his dwelling in me, when he seals unto me the same by the communion of his body and bloud. I cannot in any wise doubt of the assistance of the holy Spirit, when my infirmity is strengthened with such safegard. I am not afraid of Satans assaults, when as this angelicall food doth make me strong to fight. I am not afraid of the allurements of the flesh,
                           Hilar. in his 8. book of the Trinitie, pag▪ 141. when as this quickning and spirituall food doth corroborate me by the vertue of the Spirit. These taken and drunk do make Christ to dwell in me, and me in Christ. The good shepherd will not suffer the sheep that is fed with his own body and bloud, to be devoured by the infernall wolf: Neither will the power of the Spirit suffer me to be overcome by the weaknesse of the flesh. To thee (O Saviour most benigne) be praise, honour, and thanksgiving, for ever and ever. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     PRAYER XIIII. He renders thanks to God, for preserving us from sundry evils.
                     TO thee (O eternall and mercifull God) I render eternall thanks, for that thou hast hitherto preserved me from infinite evils and dangers, and hast kept me safe by the guard of thy holy angels. Thy privative blessings, by which thou dost keep me from evil, are more in number then thy positive, by which thou dost conferre good upon me. As many evils of soul and bodie as I see in others; so many tokens do I see of thy mercie toward me: For my deliverance from those evils is to be attributed as due onely to thy goodnesse. How great is the power of the devil! How great is his subtiltie! As often therefore as that malignant and most subtile spirit, and our most potent adversarie doth labour to do us any mischief; so often by the buckler of thy benignity, and by the guard of thy holy angels being protected, I have been able to escape his

nets. But who can reckon up the treacherous assaults and invasions of the devil? Who can therefore reckon up the riches of thy bounty? When I sleep by night, the eye of thy providence doth watch over me, that the infernall enemy which goeth about like a roaring lion, may not be able by his strength and subtilty to oppresse me. When by day Satan by his tentations doth set upon me, the strength of thy right hand doth most bountifully comfort and strengthen me, that the deceitfull tempter may not allure me into his snares. When an innumerable host of evils hangs over my head, thy blessed angels encamp about me like a fiery wall.Psal. 34.7. Zech. 2.5. There is no creature so vile, so weak, and so little, of which I do not stand in danger many wayes. How great and immense a benefit is it therefore, that thy providence doth preserve me safe from them! My soul is prone to sinne, and my bodie to falling: Therefore (O Lord most benigne) my soul thou governest by thy blessed Spirit, and my body by thy angelicall buckler:Psal. 91.11. 
                        For

thou hast given thy angels charge over me to keep me in all my wayes, and to bear me up with their hands, that I dash not my foot at any time against a stone.
                        Lam. 3.22 To thy mercy I attribute it that I am not consumed. New dangers compasse and environ me about every day: Thy mercy is therefore renewed unto me every morning.Psal. 121.4. 
                        Thou dost neither slumber nor sleep, O thou faithfull and watchfull keeper of my soul and bodie: Thy grace is the shadow on my right hand, that the noon-tide rayes of open and violent persecution strike me not, nor the darknesse of the night cause me to fall into the secret and hidden snares of the devil. Thou dost keep my ingresse; thou dost direct my progresse; thou dost govern my egresse: For which thy great benefit, I will sing praises unto thee for ever. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     PRAYER XV. He renders thanks for the promise of everlasting salvation.
                     I Render thanks unto thee, heavenly Father, for that thou hast not onely given me free remission of my sinnes, and the inward renewing of the Spirit, but also an assured promise of everlasting salvation. How great is thy goodnesse, that to me poore miserable man, and a sinner, having had so often experience of thy mercy, thou hast given boldnesse to hope even after heavenly things, and to conceive an assured hope of habitation in the everlasting mansions of thy heavenly house! The goods of that true and everlasting life are so great,
                           Bern. in his 2 serm of the 7 loaves, p. 181. Bonavent. in the 7. book of his Compend. cap. 32. that they cannot be measured; and so many, that they cannot be numbred; so farre extended, that they cannot be termed; and of such price, that they cannot be valued. How great therefore is thy goodnesse and bounty to me undeserving wretch, in that thou dost in the prison and work-house of this life, make me blessed in part, with an

infallible promise of those goods! That I am already saved by hope,
                        Rom. 8.24. the Apostle of the truth doth manifest:Rom. 5.5.
                        And that hope maketh not ashamed, it is proved by evident testimonie. Why therefore is the ship of my heart, in which Christ is carried by faith, so often tossed up and down with storms and waves of doubtings? Thou hast given unto me a promise of salvation, O God, thou God of truth: How can I therefore any longer doubt of the certainty and immutability of thy promise? That promise of life comes of thy meer free-will: And therefore it depends not upon the merit of my works. I am by faith as surely ascertained of the benefits promised of thy grace, as I am assured by the sight of mine eyes of those which I already have. Thou feedest me with the bodie and bloud of thy Sonne. Thou sealest me by the inward testimony of thy Spirit: What more certain testimony, or more precious pledge can there be to confirm unto me the promise of salvation? I finde in very deed that thou art with me in the troubles of this presentPsal. 91.15.
                        
life: How can it otherwise be but that I shall be with thee in that most blessed fellowship of eternall life? If thou bestowest upon me such great things in the poore cottage of this world: How much greater wilt thou bestow in the palace of the heavenly paradise! Whatsoever thing to be hoped for thou hast promised, is as certain unto me, as all those things, which thou hast given me for my use in this world. Thy mercy and truth is strengthened and shall be strengthened over me for ever.Psal. 117.2. Thy mercy did prevent me,Psal. 23.6. and thy mercy shall follow me: It prevented me in my justification, and it shall follow me in my glorification: It prevented me that I might live piously, it shall follow me that I may live for ever with thee. Therefore I will praise and sing of thy mercy and truth for ever. Amen.

                     THou hast lighted in my heart, thou living and eternall God, the light of saving faith: which I humbly beseech thee, of thy goodnesse and clemencie, to keep and

increase. I often feel weaknesse of faith, I often waver, and am tossed with storms of doubts and fears: Therefore I humbly call upon thee with thy blessed Apostles,Luk. 17.5. that thou wouldest vouchsafe to increase it. My heart propounds unto thee a good word.Isa. 42.3. 
                        Thou wilt not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax.
                        2. Cor. 4.7▪
                         I carrie my treasure in a vessel of clay: The torch of faith I bear about me in a brittle vessel. What else remains there, but that with serious prayers and sighs I commend it unto thy custodie, and daily pray unto thee for increase of the same? In the darknesse of this life and present world, make me partaker of the heavenly light of faith. Thy word is light and life: Grant unto me of thy mercie that by true faith I may stick unto thy word, and be made by thee a sonne of light and life. Against all the tentations of Satan, against all oblocutions of the world, yea against the cogitations of mine own heart, let the comfort of thy word prevail in me. One word of Scripture is of more worth

then heaven and earth, in that it is more firm then heaven and earth.
                        Luk. 21.33. Effect in me by thy holy Spirit, that I may firmly beleeve thy word, and yeeld my reason and my senses to the obedience of faith. Thy promises are of thy meer free grace, neither do they depend upon the condition of my worth and merits: I may therefore with most assured faith relie upon them, and with my whole heart trust in thy goodnesse.Eph. 3.17. Gal. 2.20. 
                        By faith Christ dwells and lives in my heart: Conserve therefore in me the free gift of faith, that my heart may be and alwayes remain the habitacle of Christ. Faith is the seed of all good works, and the foundation of holy life: Conserve therefore, most bountifull Lord, and confirm this in me, that my spirituall harvest, and dwelling, suffer no losse. Strengthen my faith, that it may overcome the world,
                        1. Joh. 5.4. Matt. 5.16. and the prince of the world: Increase the light thereof, that it may daily cast forth more clear beams outwardly: Conserve it in the midst of the darknesse of death, that it may cast a

light before me to true life. Rule me by thy holy Spirit, that I lose not this faith by consenting unto the lusts of the flesh, and taking pleasure in sinne against my conscience: But confirm in me that good work which thou hast begun, that by perseverance of my faith I may obtain the inheritance of eternall life. Amen.

                     ALmighty, eternall, and mercifull God, I beseech thee by the most sacred wounds of thy Sonne, to uphold in me the prop of saving hope. Sometimes my heart doth wave lik a ship in the midst of the sea: But grant thou unto me the safe and firm anchor of immoveable hope;Heb. 6.

                         Still the waves of tentations and doubts: Thou that art the God of hope, and all consolation. As certain and immoveable as the truth of thy promise is, so certain may the firmnesse of holy

hope be in me. I rest upon thy promises: And thou wilt not leave me destitute of aid. My confidence is in thy bountie: And thou wilt not leave me destitute of comfort. I know on whom I have beleeved,
                        2. Tim. 1.12. Bern. Serm 3. of the fragments of the 7 loaves, col. 183. Phil. 1.9. 
                        and I am sure that he is able to keep that which is committed unto him by me, against that day. I am most certainly perswaded, that thou which hast begun a good work in me, wilt also finish it untill the day of Jesus Christ. There are three things that lift me up when I am prostrate; that uphold me when I am falling; that direct me when I am wavering: to wit, thy love in my adoption; the truth of thy promise; and thy power in performance. This is the threefold cord, that thou lettest down unto me into this prison, out of my heavenly countrey, that thou mayst lift me up, and draw me unto thee, unto the sight of thy glory. This hope is the anchor of my salvation: This is the way that leadeth unto paradise. The meditation of thy command makes me hope: The meditation of thy goodnesse suffers me not to despair of

thy mercie: the meditation of mine own frailtie suffers me not to hope and trust in my self, or mine own power and merit. By how much the lesse my hope is fastened on these frail and fluxible sands of present goods and humane aid: By so much the more solidly and certainly it is stablished upon the firm and immoveable rock of thy promise, and celestiall things. Unite my heart unto thee, that I may altogether withdraw my self from the wo

                        and the rock of my strength, and horn of my salvation. In me there is nothing but sinne, death, and condemnation: In thee there is nothing but righteousnesse, life, health, and consolation. I despair therefore in my self, and I hope in thee: I am dashed in pieces of my self, and I am raised up by thee. Let tribulations be multiplied, so that thy quickening consolations be present unto me, and erect my hope.Rom. 5.3.

                     ETernall and mercifull God, who art charitie and love it self:1. Joh. 4 8. Grant unto me the riches of true and spirituall love. My heart is cold, my heart is earthy: O thou that art fire, O thou that art love it self, kindle me. My heart is hard and stony: O thou that art the rock, O thou that art love it self, soften me. My heart is full of thorns and thistles of anger and hatred: O most gracious Father, O thou that art love it self,Psal. 18.1, 2. weed me. I will love thee, O Lord my strength, my rock, and my tower of defence, my deliverer, my God, my buckler, and the horn of my salvation. Whatsoever I see in the creatures either good or excellent, all that I finde in thee, who art the

chief good, more abundant and excellent. I will love thee therefore with all my heart above all things, in whom I know there is such plenty &amp; excellencie of all good. It is so much the better for me, by how much the more I come unto thee, then whom there is nothing better: But I will come unto thee, not walking on the feet of my body, but loving thee with the affection of my heart. If I desire beauty, thou art the most beautifull of all: If I desire wisdome, thou art the wisest of all: If I desire riches, thou art the richest of all: If I desire power, thou art the most powerfull of all: If I desire strength, thou art the strongest of all: If I desire honour, thou art the most glorious of all. Thou didst love me from eternity: I will therefore love thee again unto eternitie. Thou didst love me in giving thy self for me: I will love thee again in rendring my self up wholly unto thee. Let my heart be set on fire; let every creature seem vile unto me: Do thou onely become sweet unto my soul. It was thy will that the humane nature should

be united unto thy Sonne by an unseparable union: How much more is it fit that my heart be joyned unto thee by an unseparable bond of love? A divine love drew thy Sonne from heaven to earth, tyed him to a pillar to be whipt, and fastened him to the crosse to be crucified: Should not as fervent a flame of love lift up my heart from earth to heaven, and binde me to thee the chief good, and that unseparably? I should offer much injury unto thee and unto my self, if I should love terrene, vile, and mean things, when thou hast so much honoured me, and given me such large promises, to the end I might love thee. From this love of thee, let there arise in my heart a sincere love of my neighbour.Joh. 14.15.

he was so deare unto thee, that thou didst wonderfully create him, mercifully redeem him, and graciously call him to the fellowship of thy kingdome: In thee therefore and for thee I ought to love my neighbour, whom I see to be raised by thy grace and mercy to such an height of glory. Strengthen and increase in me this true and sincere love, thou that art love eternall, and unchangeable. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER V. He prayes for the conservation and increase of humility.
                     ALmighty and mercifull God, which art a severe hater of all pride, grant that I may be the rose of charity, and the violet of humilitie: that I may by my deeds of charitie cast forth a good and fragrant smell, and think humbly of my self in my heart, What am I Lord in thy sight? Dust, ashes, a shadow, nothing. Wherefore seeing that I am nothing in thy sight, grant that I may seem to my self nothing in mine own sight. Keep down that swelling

pride that was born together with my heart, that I may receive the dew of thy heavenly grace: For the streams of thy grace do not flow upwards to the high mountains, but are carried downwards to the low valleys of the humble heart. There is nothing at all mine but infirmitie and iniquitie: Whatsoever good thing there is in me, it descends from the fountain of thy goodnesse unto me. Therefore I can challenge no good unto my self, seeing that there is nothing properly mine. By how much the more I think highly of thee: By so much the more I think basely of my self. Farre be it from me, most gracious Lord, farre be it from me, to be proud of thy blessings, and in respect of them to despise others. The treasures of thy riches thou didst depose in the chest of my heart, as many and as great as it pleased thee: God forbid that I should attribute them unto mine own worth, and ascribe them unto my self. Thou didst kindle in my heart, by thy Spirit, the fire of pietie and love: Grant, I beseech thee, that I may cover it with the ashes of humilitie.

How little is the honour that by man is given unto man! How little is the praise wherewith man is graced by man! But he, O most mighty Creatour, is great indeed, that is great with thee. He that pleaseth thee, pleaseth the true prizer of things: But no man pleaseth thee, unlesse he displease himself. Thou art the life of my life: Thou art the soul of my soul: I therefore resigne my life and soul into thy hands, and with an humble heart cleave fast unto thee. Let thy highnesse look upon my lowlinesse:Psal. 1

Why do I so much lift up my self, when as the yoke of sinne doth so keep me down? Let the goad of thy godly fear prick my heart, lest it die of the most dangerous disease of spirituall tumour. Let my sinnes which are innumerable be alwayes in my sight. As for my good works, let them be buried in oblivion. Let the remembrance of my sinnes make me more

sorrowfull, then the glory of any work that I do, seemingly good, but indeed unclean and imperfect, merry and joyfull. In thee alone do I rejoyce and glory, who art my joy and my glory for ever. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER VI. He prayes for the gift and increase of patience.
                     ALmighty, eternall, and mercifull God, with humble sighs I implore thy grace, that thou wilt grant unto me true and sincere patience. My flesh coveteth after things pleasing unto it, that is, soft and carnall, and refuseth patiently to endure things contrary. I beseech thee powerfully to represse in me this desire of the flesh, and underprop my weaknesse with the power of patience. O Christ Jesu, thou doctour of patience and obedience, furnish me within with thy holy Spirit, that I may learn of thee to renounce mine own will, and patiently to bear the crosse that is laid upon me. Thou enduredst for me things more grievous then thou layest upon me: and I have deserved

more grievous punishments then thou inflictest. Thou didst bear the crown of thorns, and the burden of the crosse; thou didst sweat bloud; thou didst tread the wine-presse for me:Isa. 63.3 Why therefore should I refuse with patience to endure such small sufferings and afflictions? Why should I be loth to be made conformable unto thy sorrowfull image in this life? Thou didst drink of the brook of passions in the way:
                        Psal. 110.7. Why then should I deny to drink a small draught out of the cup of the crosse? I have by my sinnes deserved eternall punishments: And why should not I suffer a little in this world a fatherly correction?Rom. 8.29. 
                        Those that thou from eternitie, before the foundations of the world were laid, didst foreknow, thou hast decreed that they should be made conformable unto the image of thy Sonne in the time of this life. Therefore if I should not endure patiently this conformitie by the crosse, I should despise thy holy and eternall counsel concerning my salvation: which farre be from me thy unworthy servant! It is for triall and

not for deniall that thou dost so exercise me with sundry calamities. As much of the crosse and tribulation as thou layest upon me, so much light and consolation dost thou conferre upon me: neither is my chastisement increased so much as my reward is. The sufferings of this life are not worthy of that heavenly consolation which thou sendest in this life,Rom. 8.18 and that heavenly glory which thou promisest in the life to come.Psal. 91.15 I know that thou art with me in trouble: Why therefore should I not rejoyce rather for the presence of thy grace, then be sorrowfull for the burden of the crosse that is laid upon me? Lead me which way thou wilt, thou best Master and Teacher, through thorns and bushes I will follow thee; onely do thou draw me, and make me able to follow thee. I submit my head to be crowned with thorns, being fully perswaded that thou wilt hereafter crown me with an everlasting crown of glory. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     PRAYER VII. He prayes for the gift and increase of gentlenesse and meeknesse.
                     O Most gracious Lord, that dost so lovingly and kindly invite us to repentance, and with such long patience dost wait for our conversion:Rom. 2.4. give unto me the riches of long-suffering and meeknesse. The fire of anger doth flame in my heart, as often as I receive the least detriment from my neighbour: Therefore I humbly pray thee, that by thy Spirit thou wouldest mortifie this sinfull affection of my flesh. What hard words, and harder blows, and most hard punishments did thy beloved Sonne endure for me! Who when he was reproched, reproched not again,
                        1. Pet. 2.23. but referred all to him that judgeth all things most righteously. What pride is this therefore, and stubbornnesse in me, that I miserable and mortall dust of the earth, and ashes,Gen 18.27 cannot endure a rough word, and overcome with meeknesse of heart the offence given me by my neighbour! Learn of me, O learn of me,
                        Matt. 11.29.
                        
                        for I am meek and humble in heart; thou cryest out, O Christ. Receive me, receive me, with sighs I humbly intreat thee, into that practick school of thy Spirit, that I may learn there true meeknesse. With what grievous and divers sinnes do I offend thee, most gracious Father, whose daily pardon I stand in need of! Why therefore do I being a man harbour anger against man,
                        Ecclus 28.
                              •
                           · and presume to ask pardon of thee, who art Lord of heaven and earth? Were it not absurd for me to take no pitie upon man that is like unto my self, and to ask of thee, Lord, remission of my sinnes?Matt. 8.35 
                        Vnlesse I shall remit unto my neighbour his offences, neither can I hope for remission of my sinnes. Therefore, most gracious Lord, that art of much mercie and long-suffering, give unto me the spirit of patience and meeknes, that I do not presently conceive anger when my neighbour offendeth me, but that I may shun it, as the enemie of my soul: or if it steal upon me unawares, that I may presently lay it aside. Let not the sunne go down upon my wrath,

lest it depart as a witnesse against me: Let not sleep seize upon me whilst I am angry, lest he deliver me in my anger to death his sister. If I desire to take revenge of mine enemie, why do not I set my self against mine anger, which is my greatest and most hurtfull enemie, seeing that it kills the

                        oul, and makes me subject to eternall death? Set a watch before my mouth, and give me prudence to govern the actions of my life, that I offend not my neighbour either in word or deed. Grant that I may be unto my neighbour by the fragrant smell of my vertues, a sweet senting rose; and not by offences and detractions a pricking thorn. Grant, good Jesu, that I may insist in the footsteps of thy meeknesse, and with a sincere heart love my neighbour. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER VIII. He prayes for the gift and increase of chastitie.
                     HOly God, thou which art a lover of modestie and chastitie, and a severe hater of filthinesse

and lust, for Christ his sake the most chaste Bridegroom of my soul, I intreat thee to work and increase in me true chastitie inward and outward, of the soul and of the body, of the spirit and of the flesh: and contrariwise to extinguish the fire of evil concupiscence that is in my heart. Let the holy fear of thee wound my flesh, that it rush not headlong into the fire of lust. Let the celestiall love carrie my soul up unto thee, that it cleave not through inordinate love unto the unsavourie things of the world. Showre down a upon me the streams of thy heavenly grace, that the flames of concupiscence may thereby be extinguished, as fiery darts are in the water. My soul was created after thy image, and repaired again by Christ: I should offer great injurie unto thee therefore my Creatour, and Redeemer, and unto my self also, if I should be-black the beautifull face of my soul with the smoke and stains of dishonest love. Christ dwelleth in my heart: The holy Ghost dwelleth in my heart:

                        rt the most pure light: As much therefore as thy beautifull vision is to be loved and desired, so detestable and odious let the decrease and losse of chastitie be unto me. The holy Spirit is made sorrowfull with the sparks of filthy speeches:Eph. 4.30. How much more then with the flaming fire of lust!
                           Bernard of conversion, chap. 2. The very appetite of lust is full of anxietie and folly: The act is full of abomination and ignominie: And the end is full of repentance and shame. The heat thereof ascendeth up into heaven, and the stink thereof descendeth even unto hell: Why therefore should I open the doore of my soul to this most filthy enemie, and receive him even into the inward chamber of my heart? Give unto me, thou God of holines and fortitude, thou Lord of hosts, give unto me the strength of the Spirit, that I may overcome that enemie, which within me fighteth against me: Grant unto me that I may not onely

abstain from unlawfull embracings, and outward acts of filthinesse, but also that I may be freed from the inward flames and desires thereof: seeing that thou dost not onely require a pure body, but also a pure heart, and dost behold with thy most pure eyes not onely the outwards, but the inwards also. Crucifie in me (O Christ thou which wast crucified for me) my flesh and the concupiscence thereof, I beseech thee.
                  
                  
                     PRAYER IX. He prayes for contempt of earthly things.
                     HOly God, heavenly Father, I call upon thee through thy beloved Sonne, that by thy holy Spirit thou wouldest withdraw my heart from earthly things, and lift it up unto the desire of heavenly things. As fire by nature doth tend upwards: So let the spirituall fire of love and devotion kindled in my heart, tend to heavenly things. What are these earthly things? They are more brittle then glasse, more moveable then Euripus, more changeable then the windes. I

were a fool therefore, if I should set my heart upon them, and seek rest for my soul in them. We must leave all earthly things when we die, though it be against our wills: Grant therefore that with a free and voluntary affection of the heart, I may first forsake them. Mortifie in me the love of the world, that the holy love of thee may increase in me. Preserve me by the aid of thy holy Spirit, that I settle not my love on this world, lest my heart become worldly.1. Cor. 7.31. 
                        The figure of this world passeth away, the momentany glorie thereof passeth away: the dissolution both of heaven and earth is at hand: Bend my heart therefore, that I may become a lover of the life that lasteth for ever, and not of this world which soon fleeth away. Whatsoever is in this world,
                        1. John 2.16. 
                        is concupiscence of the flesh, concupiscence of the eyes, and pride of life: But how vain a thing is it to love the concupiscence of the flesh! How dangerous a thing is it to satisfie the concupiscence of the eyes! How hurtfull a thing is it to make choice of the pride of life! He cannot truly

love Christ, which is the heavenly bread of life, that is full with the earthly husks of the swine. He can not freely flie up to God,Luk. 15.16. whose heart is held captive with the love of this world. The love of God cannot enter in there, where the heart is full with the love of this world. Quench in me therefore, O God my love, the desire of earthly things: Take from me this bond of the love of the world; scoure the vessel of my heart, that I may love thee with sincere love, and cleave unto thee with a perfect heart.
                        1. Joh. 2.25. Alas! Why should I love those things which are in the world, seeing that they cannot satisfie my soul which was created for eternitie, nor recompense me again love for love? Him shall my soul love, with whom she shall dwell for ever. Thither will I send before the desires of my heart, where eternall glory is prepared for me.Mat. 6.21. 
                        Where my treasure is, there shall my heart be also.
                        Psal. 55.6. Give unto me the wings of a dove, that I may flie on high unto thee, and hide my self in the holes of the rock: lest the hell-hunter

catch me in the snares of this worldly love, and draw my soul again to earthly things: Let all the world wax bitter unto me, that Christ alone may become sweet unto my soul. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER X. He prayes for deniall of himself.
                     O Jesu Christ, Sonne of the living God, which proclaimest in thy word, Whosoever will be my disciple,
                        Mat. 16, 24. 
                        let him denie himself, take up his crosse, and follow me: I intreat thee by thy most precious death and passion, to perfect in me that deniall of my self which thou requirest. I know it is easier to forsake all other creatures, then for a man to deny himself. That which I cannot therefore in my self perfect, perfect thou in me I beseech thee. Let the desires of mine own will keep silence, that I may hearken unto thy divine oracles. Let the rootie strings of the love of my self be rooted out of my heart, that the most sweet plants of divine love may grow in me. Let me die wholly unto my

self, and mine own concupiscences, that I may live wholly unto thee, and thy will. My will is changeable and moveable, wandring and unconstant: Grant therefore that I may submit my will to thy will, and cleave inseparably unto thee, who art alone the immutable and eternall good. Then do divine vertues grow in us, when naturall strength decayes in us us: Then at length are our works done in God, when our own will is mortified in us: Then are we truly in God, and live in him, when we are annihilated and made nothing in our selves. Therefore, O thou true life, mortifie in me mine own will, that I may begin truly to live unto thee. Whatsoever in us ought to be approved, and please God, must from him descend upon us: Therefore, to God alone must all good be ascribed, and to him must we leave that which is his own. Whatsoever doth shine and glitter in us, doth come from the eternall and immutable light, which lighteneth the naturall darknesse of our mindes. Let our light therefore so shine before men,
                        Mat. 5.16. not

that we our selves, but that God may thereby be glorified. O Christ, thou which art the true light, kindle this light of true knowledge in my minde. O Christ, thou which art the true glory of thy Father, work in my heart this abnegation of mine own honour. It is better for me in thee, then in my self: Where I am not, there am I most happy. My infirmity desires to be strengthened by thy vertue: my nothing looketh up unto thy being.Mat. 6▪10. Let thy holy will be done in the earth of my flesh, that thy heavenly kingdome may come into my soul. Mortifie in me the love of my self, and of mine own honour, that it may not hinder the coming of thy heavenly kingdome. If it be the totall good of mankinde to love God; then it must needs be the totall evil to love himself. If it be the nature and propertie of the true good to communicate it self: then surely mans love of himself must needs be a great evil; because he challengeth his own and others good unto himself. If all glory be due unto God alone, then is it sacriledge to challenge

honour; for he that challengeth it, challengeth that which is anothers. Extinguish in me this love of my self and mine honour, O Christ blessed for ever. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER XI. He prayeth for conquest over the world.
                     ALmightie, eternall, and mercifull God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, give unto me the grace of thy holy Spirit, that I may get the conquest over all the tentations of the world. The world sets upon me with hatred, flattery, and perverse examples: Teach me to contemn the hatred of the world, to decline her allurements, and to shun the imitation of evil examples. What can the world with her hatred do against me, if thy grace like a buckler protect me? What shall it hurt me though all men should persecute me with hatred, if thou my God dost embrace me with love? Again, what shall it profit me, though all men should love me, if the fury of thine anger shall pursue

me? The world passeth away, the hatred of the world passeth away: But the grace of God alone endureth for ever. Remove therefore, O God, out of my heart that inordinate fear, that I be not afraid of the hatred and persecution of the world: But ingraff in my soul a full confidence, and an ardent heat of the spirit, that I may learn to contemn all worldly things, because they are transitorie clouds.Mat. 10.2
                              •
                           
                         Why should I be afraid of them that kill the body, but cannot kill the soul? I will rather reverence and fear him that is able to cast not onely the body, but the soul also into the everlasting fire of hell.1. Joh. 5.4. 
                        Our faith is the victorie that overcometh the world: For by faith we have an eye unto the joyes to come, that so we may with patience endure these present sorrows. By faith we relie upon the divine goodnesse, that so we may abide humane hatred. Neither doth the world assault me on the left hand onely with her hatred, but on the right hand also she laboureth to ensnare me with her fawning allurements. She hath a

sting in her tail, but she hath a smooth face. Grant unto me therefore, O Christ, a taste of the sweetnesse of the heavenly joy, that I may lose the taste of earthly things. The taste of my soul is corrupt, and coveteth after earthly things; and the contempt of the worlds allurements doth seem bitter unto it: But thou, the true prizer of things, hast taught me to lothe the enticements of the world; and wouldest have my soul to soar aloft after heavenly things. Turn away therefore, O turn away my heart from the allurements of the world, that being turned unto thee, it may enjoy the true and spirituall delights. What have these things profited the lovers of the world after death, to wit, Vain glory, short pleasure, slender power? What hath the momentanie pleasure of the flesh, and store of false riches profited? Where are they now, that not many dayes ago were here with us? There remains nothing of them but ashes and worms. They did eat and drink being secure, they passed their life being

made drunk with carnall pleasure: But now their flesh is here given to the worms for meat, and their soul is there tormented in everlasting fire. All their glorie is fallen like the flower, and like grasse withered. Suffer me not, O God, to follow their steps, lest that I come to the same term of misery: But by the victory of the world lead me unto the crown of celestiall glory. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER XII. He prayes for consolation in adversitie, and for the true rest of the soul.

                         grant unto me in all adversities thy quickning consolation, and the true rest of the soul. I feel much straitnesse in my heart: But thy consolation shall make glad my soul.
                        Psal. 94.19. Vain and unprofitable is all the comfort of the world: in thee alone is the strength and support of my soul. The weight of divers calamities presseth me sore: But thy inward speaking unto me, and thy consolation maketh it light. No

creature can make me so sorrowfull, but thou canst make me much more glad by the spirit of gladnesse. No adversities can so straiten my heart, but thy grace can much more enlarge it. The fiery heat of sundry calamities doth torment me: But the taste of thy sweetnesse doth refresh me. Rivers of tears distill from mine eyes: But thy most bountifull hand doth wipe them all away.
                        Rev. 7.17. As thou didst shew thy loving countenance to Stephen the first Martyr,Acts 7.56. even in the very heat when his enemies stoned him: So vouchsafe to give unto me in all adversities the joy of thy comfort. As in the most grievous agonie of death, thou didst send an angel unto thy Sonne to comfort him:Luk. 22.43. So in this my wrestling send, I beseech thee, thy holy Spirit to uphold me. Without thy support I fall down under the burden of the crosse: Without thy help by the assault of sundry adversities I am cast down flat. Extinguish in me the love of the world, and of the creatures: so shall not the calamities of this world, nor the changeablenesse

of the creatures bring any bitternesse unto me. He that with all his heart doth cleave unto the world and to the creatures, can never be made partaker of the true and eternall rest; for all terrestriall things are subject to continuall alterations and changes: But whosoever doth not cleave unto the present goods of this life with an inordinate desire, he will not be grieved much for the losse of the same. Poure out, O God, poure out of my heart the love of the world, that the celestiall Elisha may poure into the widows pitcher, that is,2. Kings 4.2. into my soul devoid of earthly comfort, the oyl of celestiall joy. Let all earthly things be troubled, and changed, and turned upside down: Yet notwithstanding thou art the immoveable foundation and most firm rock of my heart.
                        Psal. 7
                              •
                           .26. Can a poore and weak creature disturb the quiet of my soul, which I possesse in thee my Creatour sure and immoveable? Can the waves of the world that most unquiet sea, cast down the rock of my heart, which is fixt in thee the chief and immutable good? No: For thy peace passeth all ununderstanding,
                        
and overcometh the invasion of all adversities. Which inward peace, most bountifull Father, I beg at thy hands with most humble sighs. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     PRAYER XIII. He prayes for victory in tentations, and deliverance from the devils treacheries, and invasions.
                     BE present unto me, thou God of Zebaoth, thou God of strength and mercy, that I yeeld not unto the tentations and invasions of Satan: but being safe by thy guard, and upholden by thy aid, I may become at length the conquerour. Within are fears,
                        2. Cor. 7.5 
                        without are fights: For within the devil doth wound my soul with venemous and fiery darts of tentations: Without he wearies me with sundrie adversities, and a thousand kindes of treacheries. He is a serpent for his subtiltie and fallacie, a lion for his violence and invasion, a dragon for his crueltie and oppression. He attempted to assault the very captain of the heavenly host: And will he spare

me a common souldier? He did not doubt to set himself in opposition against the very head: And what wonder then if he go about to overthrow a weak member of the mysticall bodie? There is no power in me to withstand him being strong and armed: There is no wisdome in me to escape the snares and gins of this enginer, that hath a thousand stratagemes. To thee therefore with humble sighs do I betake my self, whose power cannot be termed, and whose wisdome cannot be numbred. Be present with me, O Christ, thou which art the most strong Lion of the tribe of Judah,

                           .5. that in thee and through thee I may be able to get the conquest over that lion of hell. Thou hast fought and overcome for me: Fight likewise and overcome in me,2. Cor. 12 9. that thy strength may be perfected in my weaknesse. Enlighten the eyes of my minde, that I may discern the treacheries of Satan. Direct my feet, that I may escape his hidden snares. Let the victory in tentation be a testimonie unto my heart of my heavenly regeneration. Let

the presence of thy grace confirm unto me the promise of victorie. Furnish me and arm me with the strength of thy fortitude, that in this combat I may be able to stand, and hereafter judge him,1. Cor. 6.3 of whom I am now oppugned. The more in number, and the more dangerous the treacherous assaults of this enemy are, the more ardently do I flee unto the aid of thy mercy. One while he inspires into me the unsatiable desire of earthly things, that having bound me in the fetters of avarice, he may lead me out of the way of righteousnesse. Another while he inflames me with the fire of anger, that my heart may burn within me, till I have done my neighbour some mischief. Another while he solicits me to lust, and the love of pleasures. Another while he suggests into my minde envie and ambition. Before he precipitates and throws me headlong into sinne, he perswades me it is lighter then the aire, or a feather, or an autumn leaf; and this is to make me secure: And when he hath precipitated me into sin, then he tells me it is greater then

the universe of heaven and earth, and more weighty then the balance of Gods mercy; and this is to make me despair. These so many and so great and treacherous assaults and fallacies I cannot foresee: How much lesse then shall I be able of my self to escape them? Unto thee therefore do I flee, who art my strength, and the rock of my fortitude for ever. Amen.

                     O Jesu Christ, Sonne of the everliving God, thou that wast crucified and raised up again for us, thou that didst destroy our death by thy death, thou that hast merited by thy resurrection a blessed resurrection for us unto life everlasting: I worship thee, I pray unto thee with my whole heart, the onely true God, together with the Father and the holy Spirit, to grant unto me a happie egresse out of the miseries of this life, and a blessed ingresse in the resurrection,

and in the day of judgement unto life everlasting. I know that there is an appointed term of my life in thy divine determination,Heb. 9.27. and that after death follows judgement. Be present with me in the houre of death, thou that sufferedst death for me on the crosse: Protect me in the day of judgement, thou that wast for me unjustly condemned. When the tabernacle of this my earthly house shall be dissolved,
                        2. Cor. 5.1. lead my soul into an habitation in my heavenly countrey. When my eyes shall be darkened in the agony of death, kindle in my heart the light of saving faith. When my eares shall be stopped in the houre of death, speak unto me inwardly by thy Spirit, and comfort me. When a cold sweat doth come forth out of my dying members, make me to remember thy bloudy sweat,
                        Luke 22.44. which is a sufficient ransome for my sinnes, and a defensive remedie for me against death. In thy sweat there appeareth fervency, in thy bloud a price, and in the running down thereof sufficiency. When my speech shall begin to fail me in

that last agonie, grant that I may sigh unto thee by the grace of thy holy Spirit. When those extreme distresses seize upon my heart, be thou present with me by the consolation and help of thy quickning grace, and take me into thy charge and tuition when all other creatures denie me aid. Grant unto me that I may patiently endure all horrours and troubles: and bring my soul at length out of this prison. I beseech thee by thy most sacred wounds which thou enduredst in thy p

I beseech thee by those most bitter torments which thou sufferedst, that I may be able to endure and overcome all the violent invasions of the infernall powers. Let my last word in this life be the same with which thou didst consummate all upon the crosse: and receive my soul,Luke 23.46. which thou hast redeemed with so deare a price, when I shall commend it into thy hands. Let a blessed resurrection

follow a blessed death: In that great day of thy severe judgement, deliver me from that cruel sentence, thou which in my life didst with thy ready help protect me. Let my sinnes be covered with the shadow of thy grace,Psal. 32.1. Mic. 7.19. and overwhelmed in the bottom of the sea.
                        1. Sam. 25.29. Let my soul be bound up in the bundle of the living, that with all the elect I may come into the fellowship of everlasting joy. Amen.

                        ALmightie, eternall, and mercifull God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that by thy holy Spirit dost gather thy Church out of mankinde, and in it dost keep the heavenly doctrine committed unto it: In humilitie I adore and worship thee, and pray unto thee, that thou wouldest be pleased to continue unto us the saving doctrine of thy word inviolable, and every day propagate and inlarge the bounds of thy Church. Thou hast of thine infinite mercie lighted unto us that were in the darknesse of this world, the light of thy word: Suffer not therefore the clouds of humane traditions to extinguish it, or to obscure it. Thou hast given unto us thy word for the wholesome meat of our souls: Suffer it not therefore by the delusion of the devil and the corruption of men, to be turned into poyson. Mortifie

in us the sinfull lusts of the flesh, that thirsteth after earthly things; that so we may taste the spirituall delicates of thy word which is that heavenly Manna: No man can feel the sweetnesse thereof, but he that will taste: and no man can taste, whose palate is corrupted with abundance of worldly delights. Thy word is the word of spirit and life, of light and grace. Take away therefore the carnall affections, and the corrupt senses of our hearts; that it may shine to us within, and be a light to lead us unto the light of everlasting life. From the light of thy word let there arise in our hearts the light of saving faith, that in thy light we may see light, in the light of thy word,Psal. 36.9. the light of thy Sonne. As in the old time that heavenly Manna descended in the wildernesse with a wholesome dew: So likewise by the hearing of thy word let our hearts be filled with the fire of the Spirit, that our cold and lukewarm flesh may be excited, and may be tempered against the boilings of sinfull lusts. Let the seed of thy word take deep root in our

Protect, O Lord,Psal. 80.15 Isa. 5.2. the vineyard of thy Church, in which thy word is as seed scattered, and fruit is gathered unto everlasting life Set an hedge of angelicall guard round about it, that the wilde boars and the foxes break it not down: the wilde boars by violent persecutions, and the foxes by fraudulent delusions. Erect up in it an high tower of thy fatherly providence, that by thy custodie it may be free from all devastation. But if thou shalt at any time think good to presse the grapes of this vineyard in the presse of the crosse, and of calamities, let them be ripened first by the heat of thy grace; that they may yeeld the most delicious fruits of faith and patience. Whatsoever is put into the root of the vine, is converted in the grapes into the most sweet liquour of wine: Grant, I beseech thee, that whatsoever shall happen unto us in this life, whether scoffings, persecutions, praises, or

whatsoever else, our souls may turn it into the wine of faith, hope, and charitie, and into the fruit of patience and humilitie. Out of this militant Church translate us at length into the Church triumphant: And let this tabernacle of clay be changed into that most beautifull and everlasting temple of the heavenly Jerusalem.

Be present by thy grace with all Christian Kings and Governours: that the greater their dangers be in respect of the highnesse of their state, the greater they may finde the abundance of thy grace towards them. Kindle in their hearts the light of thy heavenly wisdome: that they may know and acknowledge themselves

to be subject unto thee the Lord of all, and to be thy vassals, and that they are bound to give unto thee hereafter an account of their government. Let them study for peace, seeing that they are thy servants, who art the God of peace: Let them study for justice, seeing that they are thy servants, who art the God of justice: Let them study for clemencie and mercie, seeing that they are thy servants, who art the God of mercie: Let them keep and observe both the tables of the commandments, and become nursing-fathers unto thy afflicted Church upon earth: Let them put on a fatherly affection toward their subjects: Let them alwayes administer right judgement: Draw their hearts away from the splendour and brightnes of their earthly dominion, that there creep not upon them a forgetfulnesse of true godlinesse, and of the heavenly kingdome.

Bend likewise the hearts of the children, that they may perform due obedience unto their parents: that they may become sweet-smelling plants of the heavenly paradise, and not unprofitable wood adjudged to the flames of hell-fire. Let them cast forth a most pleasant smell of pietie, obedience, reverence, and all kinde of vertue: that they fall not into that most filthy sink of sinne, and so consequently into the pit of hell. Let them remember the commandment of honouring their parents:

let them be carefull to recompense their parents after the manner of storks: let them remember to feed them as they have been fed by them, that they precipitate not themselves into the gulf of sundry evils. Let parents and children with joynt desires study in this life to worship thee the true God: that they may bear parts in consort, and together praise thee in the life to come.Eph. 6.5.

                     MOst holy and mercifull God, from whom large heaps of sundry benefits descend down upon us; who hast given unto me kinsfolk and benefactours to be helps unto me in this present life: I beseech thee to bestow upon them in the life to come everlasting rewards. Those whom thou hast joyned unto me in a speciall bond of nature and bloud, I do specially commend unto thy protection. Those unto whom I do ow speciall love and respect, with serious and fervent prayers I commend unto thy keeping. Grant that my kinsfolk may with joynt consent and unanimitie serve thee in the true faith, and with true pietie: that they may receive all of them hereafter a crown of eternal glory. Unto my parents whom thou hast made, next after thee, the authours of my life, and my informers in true pietie, I cannot by any means render deserved rewards: I humbly beseech thee therefore, who art the authour of all good, and the rewarder of all

benefits, to recompense their benefits here with temporall rewards, and hereafter with eternall. Let the example of Christ thy Sonne, who about the agonie of his death commended unto his disciple the care of his mother, let his example teach me even to the last breath to take care for my parents. Let nature it self, by the example of the stork, teach me that I ow perpetuall thanks and rewards unto them for their merits. Unto thee, mercifull Father, I commend the care and tuition of my brethren, sisters, and kinsfolk: Let them become the brethren and sisters of Christ, and so heirs of the kingdome of heaven. Let us all be joined together in the kingdome of grace, whom thou hast joined together in the life of nature: And let us all, together with those whom by death thou hast separated from us, and taken unto thy self, let us all at length be joined together in the kingdome of glory. Make us all citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem, as thou hast made us in this life members of the true Church. The same likewise I intreat of thee for all

my benefactours, whose health and welfare both of soul and body I am bound to desire and further even by the law of nature. Receive them into the everlasting tabernacles of the citie which is above, whom thou hast used as thy instruments to conferre upon me so many and so liberall benefits. My heart propoundeth unto thee the infallible promise of thy word; that thou wilt of thy meer free grace recompense even a cup of cold water:Mat. 10.42. How much more then wilt thou be liberall and bountifull to those that with full hand bestow benefits of all kindes upon those that want! Let not thy graces cease to run down upon them, that poure forth so plentifully upon others. Let the fountain of thy goodnsse alwayes spring unto them, from whom such plentifull rivers of liberality do flow.

Give unto me the grace of thy holy Spirit, that I may not onely forgive mine enemies from mine heart, but also pray for their health and salvation even from my soul. Whet not against them the sword of severe revenge, but anoint their heads with the oyl of thy mercie and compassion. Extinguish the sparks of hatred and anger that are in their hearts, that they

break not forth into the infernall flames of hell. Let them know and acknowledge that our life is but a vapour and a smoke that soon vanisheth away;Jam. 4.14. that our bodie is but ashes and dust that flyeth away: that they bear not immortall anger in their mortall bodies, nor entertain into this brittle tabernacle of clay their souls enemie. Let them know likewise, that inveterate hatred is their greatest enemie: because it kills the soul, and excludes them from the participation of heavenly life. Illuminate their mindes, that they beholding the glasse of thy divine mercie, may see the deformitie of anger and hatred. Govern their wills, that being moved by the example of thy divine forgivenesse, they may leave off and cease to be angry and to do harm.

                     PRAYER VII. He supplicates for those that are afflicted and in miserie.
                     ALmighty, eternall, and mercifull God,1. Tim 4.10. which art the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithfull, and by thy Apostle hast commanded us to make prayers for all men:
                        1. Tim. 2.1. I intreat thee for all those that are afflicted and in miserie, that thou wouldest support them by the consolation of thy grace, and succour them by the aid of thy power. Indue with power and strength from above those that labour and sweat in the most

grievous agonie of Satans tentations: Make them partakers of thy victory, O Christ, thou which didst most powerfully overcome Satan: Let the cooler of thy heavenly comfort raise up those, whose bones are become dry with the fire of grief and sorrow. Bear up all those that are ready to fall,
                        Psal. 145.14. 
                        and raise up those that are already fallen. Be mercifull unto those that are sick and diseased, and grant that the disease of the body may be unto them the medicine of the soul; and the adversities of the flesh, the remedies of the spirit. Let them know that diseases are the handmaids of sinne, and the forerunners of death. Give unto them the strength of faith and patience, O thou which art the most true Physician both of soul and body. Restore them again unto their former health, if it be for the everlasting salvation of their souls. Protect all those that are great with childe, and those that be in labour: Thou art he that dost deliver children out of the straits of their mothers wombe, and dost propagate mankinde by thy blessing: be

present with those that be in labour, O thou lover and giver of life: that they be not oppressed with an immoderate weight of sorrows. Nourish those that are orphans and destitute of all help and succour. Defend the widows that are subject to the reproches of all men, thou which hast called thy self the Father of the fatherlesse,
                        Psal. 68.5. 
                        and the judge and defender of the widows. Let the tears of the widows, which flow down from their cheeks, break through the clouds, and rest not untill they come before thy throne. Heare those that be in danger by sea, which cry to thee, and send up their sighs unto thee, seeing before their eyes their neighbours suffer shipwrack. Restore libertie unto those that are captive: that with a thankfull heart they may sing of thy bounty. Confirm those that suffer persecution for righteousnesse sake:
                        Mat. 5.10 that they may get the conquest over all their enemies, and purchase the everlasting crown of martyrdome. Be present with all those that be in danger and calamitie: and grant that they may

possesse their souls in true patience, and denying their own wills, take up their crosse.
                        Matt. 16.12. Let them follow him under the crosse, on whom they beleeve that he died for us upon the crosse. And especially I commend unto thee, most gracious Father, those which are about the gates of death, and are between time and eternitie, and wrestle with all their strength with that last enemie. Confirm them, O thou most potent Conquerour of death: Deliver them, O most glorious Captain and Authour of life: that they be not overwhelmed in the waves of tentations, but by thy conduct they may be brought unto the haven of everlasting rest. Have mercy upon all men, thou which art the Creatour of all: Have mercy upon all men, thou which art the Redeemer of all. To thee be praise and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

                     2 
                     In our childhood originall sinne brought forth actuall: and actuall sinnes have increased in us ever since, as our dayes have increased. Who can reckon up the sinnes of his youth? Who can tell how oft he offendeth? The just man sinneth seven times a day: But 3 
                     We have sinned seventy times seven times every day.

                     All thy holy laws and commandments we have broken in thought, word, and deed. 6 
                     We have been partakers of other mens sinnes.

satisfied; or else we cannot escape death. We have nothing of our own to give for the ransome of our souls: Therefore we offer unto thee, holy Father, that which is not ours, but thy Sonnes: 1

                     preserving us ever since we were born, for defending us this night past from all perils and dangers, for the quiet rest wherewith thou hast refreshed our bodies, for thy mercie renewed unto us this morning. Let thy mercy be continued unto us this day, let thy Spirit direct us in all our wayes, that we may walk before thee as children of the light, doing those things that are pleasing in thy sight. Let the dew of thy blessing descend upon our labours: for without thy blessing all our labour is but in vain. Prosper thou the works of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork: Grant that we may consci

things temporall, that finally we lose not the things which be eternall. We are unworthy, O Lord, we confesse, to obtain any thing at thy hands, either for our selves or any others, even for the sinfulnesse of these our prayers: But thou hast promised to heare all those that call upon thee in thy Sons name: Make good therefore, we beseech thee, thy promise unto us now calling upon thee in thy Sonnes name, and praying as he hath taught us in his holy Gospel,
                  OUr Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name: Thy kingdome come: Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven: Give us this day our daily bread: And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespasse against us: And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdome, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
               
               
                  
                  An Evening prayer for a familie, gathered here and there out of Gerards Meditations and Prayers.
                  
                     MOst glorious Lord God, whose dwelling is in the highest heavens, and yet beholdest the lowly and the humble upon earth, we blush and are ashamed to lift up our eyes unto heaven, because we have sinned against thee which dwellest in the heavens: But look down, we beseech thee, from heaven thy dwelling-place, and behold the humilitie of thy servants here on earth, which prostrate themselves at the foot-stool of thy mercie, confessing their own guiltinesse, and begging pardon for their sinnes.
                  We confesse, Almighty Creatour, that thou madest us at the first after thine own image, thou clothedst us with innocencie as with a garment,

thou seatedst us in paradise a place of all delight and pleasure: But we have defaced thine image, we have cast off our first covering, we have thrust our selves out of that pleasant place. We ran away from thee, and were not obedient unto thy voice: We were lost and condemned before we came into this world: Our first parents sinned against thee, and we sinned in them: They were corrupted, and we are inheriters of their corruption: They were the parents of disobedience, and we are by nature the children of wrath: Sinfull and unhappie children of sinfull and unhappie parents! Thou mightest in thy displeasure after their fall have plunged them into the bottomlesse pit, and made them the fewel of hell, and sent their posteritie after them: And neither they nor we could justly have complained. Righteous, O Lord, art thou in thy judgements: And our miserie is from our selves. But great was thy mercie unto us. We came into this world in a floud of uncleannesse, wallowing in our

mothers bloud; and thou didst set open a fountain for us to wash in: We were washed in the laver of Baptisme; and we have returned with the swine to our wallowing in the mire. We came from a place of darknesse into this world, we lived as children of darknesse, we sat in darknesse, and in the shadow of death: Thou gavest us thy word to be a lantern unto our feet, and a light unto our paths, that in thy light we might see light; that so walking in the way of truth, we might attain everlasting life: But we have loved darknesse more then light, and have not been obedient unto thy word. We came into this world crooked even from our mothers wombe; and thou gavest us thy law to be a glasse wherein we might see our deformitie, and a rule whereby to square all our actions, words, and thoughts: But we have shut our eyes that we might not see, and we have refused to be ruled by thy law: The law of sinne in our flesh doth daily captivate us. The root of originall sinne which lieth hidden in us, doth every day

put forth new branches: All the parts and faculties of our bodies and souls are as so many instruments of unrighteousnesse to fight against thy divine Majestie. Our hearts imagine wicked things, our mouthes utter them, and our hands put them in practise. Thy mercies every day are renewed unto us, and our sinnes are every day multiplied against thee: In the day of health and prosperitie we forget thee, and we never think upon the day of sicknesse and adversitie. Thy benefits heaped upon us do not allure us to obey thee: Neither do thy judgements inflicted upon others make us afraid to offend thee. What couldest thou, O Lord, have done more for us, or what could we have done more against thee? Thou didst send thy Sonne in the fulnesse of time to take our nature upon him, to fulfill thy law for us, and to be crucified for our sinnes: We have not followed the example of his holy life, but have every day afresh crucified him by our sinnes. And now O Lord, if we shall become our own judges,

we cannot but confesse that we have

                        •
                     ire. But there is mercie with thee, O Lord; therefore will we not despair. Our sinnes are many in number: But thy mercies are without number. The weight of our sinnes is great: But the weight of thy Sonnes crosse was greater. Our sinnes presse us down unto hell: But thy mercie in Christ Jesus raiseth us up. By Satan we are accused: But by Jesus Christ we are defended. By the law we are convicted: But by Jesus Christ we are justified. By our own conscience we are condemned: But by Jesus Christ we are absolved. In us there is nothing but sinne, death, and damnation: In him there is treasured up for us righteousnesse, life, and salvation. We are poore: He is our riches. We are naked: He is our covering. We are exposed to thy fury pursuing us: He is the buckler of our defence, and our refuge: He is the rock of our salvation, and in him do we trust: His wounds are the clefts of the rock: Give us, we beseech thee, the wings of a Dove, that by faith we

may hide our selves in the clefts of this rock, that thine anger wax not hot against us to consume us: Let not thy justice triumph in our confusion, but let thy mercie rejoyce in our salvation. Pardon the sinfull course of our life past, and guide us by thy holy Spirit for the time to come: Amend what is amisse, increase all gifts and graces which thou hast already given, and give unto us what thou best knowest to be wanting. Be gracious and favourable to thy whole church; especially to that part thereof which thou hast committed unto the protection of thy servant and our Sovereigne King Charles: Grant that he may see it flourishing in peace and prosperity, in the profession and practise of thy Gospel all the dayes of his life; and after this life ended, crown him, we beseech thee, with a crown of immortall glorie. Let not the sceptre of this kingdome depart from his house, neither let there be wanting a man of his race to sit upon his throne so long as the sunne and moon endureth. Of this thou hast given us a pledge alreadie,

in blessing the fruit of the Queens wombe. Let the Queen still be like a fruitfull vine: And let the Prince grow up like a plant in thine house. Let thy mercy be extended to the Ladie Elisabeth our Kings onely sister, and her princely issue. How long, Lord just and true, how long shall their enemies prevail, and say, There, there, so would we have it? It is time for thee to lay to thine hand: for they have laid waste their dwelling-place. Arise, O Lord, and let their enemies be scattered, and let them that hate them flee before them. Carrie them back again into their own countrey (if it may be for thy glorie and their good) make them glad with the joy of thy countenance, and let them rejoyce under their own vines. We return home again, and beseech thee to be gracious and mercifull to the Kings Counsel, the Nobilitie, the Magistracie, the Ministerie, the Gentry, and the Commonaltie. Give unto those whom thou hast used as instruments for our good, rewards temporall and eternall. Forgive those that

be our enemies, and turn their hearts. Forget not those that grone under the crosse. Clothe the naked, feed the hungrie, visit the sick, deliver the captives, defend the fatherlesse and widows, relieve the oppressed, confirm and strengthen those that suffer persecution for righteousnesse sake, cure those that are broken in heart, speak peace unto their consciences that are tormented with the sense of their sinnes, suffer them not to be swallowed up in despair. Stand by those that are ready to depart out of this life: When their eyes shall be darkned in the agony of death, kindle in their hearts the light of saving faith: when their 
                        •
                     ares shall be stopt, let thy Spirit speak unto them inwardly and comfort them: and when the house of their earthly tabernacle shall be dissolved, then Lord receive their souls. As we have made bold to make our prayers and supplications unto thee for our selves and others: So also we render unto thee all possible praise and thanksgiving for all thy benefits bestowed upon our selves and others. We

thank thee in speciall for our election, creation, redemption, vocation, justification, for all the blessed means of our sanctification, and for the assured hope of our future glorification: We thank thee for our health, maintenance, and libertie, for preserving us ever since we were born, for blessing us in all that we have put our hands unto this day. Let thy mercy still be continued unto us, we beseech thee. Let the eye of thy providence which never slumbreth nor sleepeth watch over us, and let the hand of thy power protect and defend us: Cover us this night under the shadow of thy wings, that no evil happen unto us. Grant that our bodies may be refreshed this night with such moderate rest, that we may be the fitter for the works of our vocation, and thy service, the n
