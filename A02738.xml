            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               Baleus prolocutor.
               
                  
                     IN ych commen welthe, most hygh prchemynence,
                  Is due vnto lawes for soch commodyte,
                  As is had by them, For as Cicero geueth sentence
                  Where as is no lawe, can no good order be,
                  In nature, in people, in howse nor yet in citie.
                  The bodyes aboue, are vnderneth a lawe,
                  Who coulde rule the worlde, were it not vndre awe?
                  Lyke as Chrysippus, full clarkely doth dyffyne,
                  Lawe is a teacher, of matters necessary,
                  A knowledge of thynges, both naturall and deuyne
                  Perswadynge all truth. dysswadynge all iniury.
                  A gyfte of the lorde, deuoyde of all obprobry,
                  An wholesom doctryne, of men dyscrete and wyse,
                  A grace from aboue and a very heauenly practyse.
                  Our heauenly maker, mannys lyuynge to dyrect,
                  The lawes of Nature, of Bondage, and of Grace,
                  Sent into thys worlde, with vycyousnesse infect,
                  In all ryghteousnesse, to walke before hys face.
                  But Infydelyte, so worketh in euery place,
                  That vnder the heauens, no thynge is pure &amp; cleane,
                  So moch the people, to hys peruerse wayes leane.
                  The lawe of Nature, hys fylthy dysposycyon.
                  
                     Corrupteth with ydolles, and stynkynge Sodometry.
                  The lawe of Moses, with Auaryce and Ambycyon.
                  He also poluteth. And euer contynually,
                  Christes lawe he defyleth. with cursed hypocresy,
                  And with false doctryne, as wyll apere in presence,
                  To the edyfyenge, of thys Christen audyence.
               
               
                  Of Infydelyte, God royll hymself reuenge.
                  With plages of water, of wylde fyre and of sworde.
                  And of hys people, due homage he wyll chalenge.
                  Euer to be knowne. for their God and good lorde,
                  After that he hath, those lawes agayne restorde,
                  To their first bewtye commyttynge them to fayth.
                  He is now in place, marke therfor what he sayth.

                  Our lawes are all one, though yow do thre apere
                  Lyke wyse as our wyll, is all one in effect.
                  But bycause that Man, in hymself is not clere

                        We two togyther beganne,
                     To sprynge and to growe in manne,
                     As Thomas of Aquyne scanne,
                     In the fort boke of hys sentence.
                  
                  
                     I dwelt amonge the Sodomytes,
                     The Beniamytes, and Madyanytes,
                     And now the popysh hypocrytes,
                     Embrace me euery where.
                     I am now become all spyrytuall,

                     Whan he hys dronken father scorned.
                     In the Gomorytes I also reigned,
                     Tyll the hand of God them brent.

                     For me hys bretherne Ioseph accused,
                     As Genesis doth tell.
                     Dauid ones warned all men of vs two,

                     Those are the wayes to hell.

                     The kyngedom of God shall neuer possesse,
                     And as the Apocalyps expresse,
                     Shall synke to the burnynge lake.

                  Soch a fole art thu, as seke thyne owne decaye.
                  If Iones meddle, to the it wyll be death.
                  Dedyst thu neuer hear that lawe sleath iÃÑ hys wreath
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  By the blessed lorde, than wyll I playe Robsons part.

                  Whye, what part wylt thu playe?
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  By cockes sowle geue ouer. so sone as I sele smart.

                  It wyll be to late, if I ones cupple with the.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  
                     Then lete me alone, and we shall sone agre,
                  And I shall be glad, to be acquaynted with ye.
               
               
                  Moseh lex.
                  Acquayntaunce good fellawe, thu mayst sone haue of me.
                  
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  The worst fault I haue, I am hastye now and thaÃÑ,
                  But it is sone gone, I toke it of a woman.
                  But what meane those tables, that ye haue in your hande?
               
               
                  Moseh lex.
                  Kepe sylence a whyle, and thu shalt vnderstande.
                  Thre thynges I declare, the first are the preceptes morall.
                  Next, the lawes iudycial, &amp; last the rytes ceremonyal
                  The morall preceptes, are Gods coÃÑmaundemeÃÑtes ten.
                  Whych ought euermore, to be obserued of all men.
                  The lawes of Nature, the morall preceptes declare,
                  And ye plesauÃÑt workes, to God they teache &amp; prepare
                  They sturre man to fayth, &amp; prouoke hym also to loue
                  To obeye, to sorne, and to worshypp God aboue.
                  In two stonye tables, God wrote them first of all,
                  That they shuld remayne, as thynges contynuall.
                  The first hath but thre, whych teÃÑde to Gods hygh honour,
                  GeueÃÑ hath the seconde, &amp; they concerne our neybour.
                  The first doth expounde, the first lawe naturall.
                  The next the other, makynge them very formall.
                  In sprete is the first, yt we shuld God honour &amp; loue.
                  To outward workynge, the seconde doth vs moue.
                  
                     Forbyddynge all wroÃÑges, preseruynge iust marryage,
                  Norryshynge true peace, and other godly vsage.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  What is the effect, of your lawes Iudycyall?
               
               
                  Moseh lex.
                  Soch thynges to coÃÑmaunde, as are cyuyle or teÃÑporall.
                  
                     From vyce to refrayne, and outwarde iniurye,
                     Quyet to conserue, and publyque honestie.
                     These are to support, the lawes of the seconde table.
                     Ceremonyall rytes are also commendable,
                     In holy dayes, garmeÃÑtes, temples &amp; consecracyons,
                     Sacryfyces &amp; vowes, with offerynges &amp; expiacyoÃÑs
                  
                  
                     Whych are vnto Christ, as fygurs, types &amp; shadowes
                     As Paule doth declare, in hys pystle to the Hebrues.
                     These are only fygures, &amp; outwarde testymonyes,
                     No man is perfyght, by soch darke ceremonyes.
                     Only perteyne they, vnto the thirde coÃÑmaundement,
                     Of the Sabboth daye, tyll Christ the lorde be present.
                  
                  In hys death endyng, the whole Iudaycal presthode.

                  Good dayes myght ye haue, ye speake it full wele by the rode.

                  Wylt thu not in dede, thaÃÑ wyll I fet hyther the poure

                  Soch knyghtes wyll I haue, as shall coÃÑfounde theÃÑ all
                  As Sadducees &amp; scrybes, with the sect pharysayeal

                  I wyll thu knowe it, I am a worshypfull Doctour.
                  A Scrybe in the lawe, and a profytable proctour.

                  And what wylt thu do, my fellawe Couetousnes?
               
               
                  Auaritia.
                  A vayle wyll I sprede, vpon the face of Moses,
                  That noÃÑ shal perceyue, the clerenes of hys coÃÑtenauÃÑce.
                  Whych is of the lawe, the meanyng &amp; true ordynauÃÑce.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  Why, what wyll ye saye, vnto ye ten coÃÑmaundemeÃÑtes?
               
               
                  Ambitio.
                  
                     We must poyson them, with wyll workes &amp; good intentes.
                     Where as God doth saye, No siraunge goddes thu shalt haue,
                     With Sayntes worshyppynge, that clause we wyll depraue.
                     And though he coÃÑmaunde, to make no carued ymage,
                     For a good intent yet wyll we haue pylgrymage.
                     Though he wyll vs not, to take hys name in vayne,
                     With tradycyons yet, therunto wyll we constrayne.
                  
                  
                     No Sabboth wyl we, with Gods worde sanctyfye,
                     But with lyppe labour, and ydle ceremonye.
                     To father and mother, we maye owe non obedyence,
                     Our relygyon is, of so great excellence.
                     Though we do not slee, yet maye we heretykes burne,
                     If they wyll not sone, from holy scripture turne.
                     What though it be sayd. Thu shalt do no fornycacyoÃÑ,
                  
                  
                     
                     Yet wyll we mayntene, moch greatter abhomynacyon
                     Though theft be forbyd, yet wyll we contynually,
                     Robbe the poore people, through prayer &amp; purgatorye
                     God hath inhybyted, to geue false testymonye,
                     Yet we wyll condempne, the Gospell for heresye.
                  
                  
                     We shuld not couete, our neybers howse nor wyfe,
                     Hys seruaunt nor beast, yet are we therin most ryfe.
                     Of meÃÑ make we swyne, by the draffe of our tradycyoÃÑs
                     And cause theÃÑ nothynge, to regard but superstycyoÃÑs.
                     As dogges vnresonable, on most vyle carren fede,
                     So wyll we cause them, seke ydolles in their nede.
                  
                  And alwayes their grouÃÑde, shall be, for a good inteÃÑt.
               
               
                  Infidelitas:
                  More myscheues I trowe, the deuyll coulde not inueÃÑt
                  Than your two can do by the Messe ye are alone,
                  Lyttle coulde I do, were ye ones from me gone,
                  To the corruptynge. of the lawe of Moyses,
                  Go forwarde therfor, in your deceytfulnes.
               
               
                  Auaritia.
                  
                     With superstycyons, the Iewes ceremonyall lawes,

                     The lawes Iudycyall. through cawtels and delayes.
                     I wyll also drowne, to all ryghteouse meÃÑnys decayes
                     To set thys forwarde, we must haue sophystrye,
                     Phylosophye and Logyck, as scyence necessarye.
                     The byshoppes must holde, their prestes in ignorauÃÑce
                     
                        With longe latyne houres, least knowledge to them chaunce.
                     Lete them haue loÃÑge mattens, loÃÑge eueÃÑ songes &amp; loÃÑge Masses.
                     And that wyll make them, as dull as euer were asses.
                     That they shall neuer, be able to prophecye,
                     Or yet preach the truth, to our great iniurye.
                  
                  
                     Lete the cloysterers, be brought vp euer in sylence,
                     Without the scriptures, in payne of dysobedyeÃÑce.
                     Se the laye people, praye neuer but in latyne,
                     Lete them haue their Crede, and seruyce all in latyne
                     That, a latyne beleue, maye make a latyne sowle,
                     Lete them nothynge knowe, of Christ nor yet of powle
                  
                  
                     If they haue Englysh, lete it be for aduauÃÑtage,
                     For pardons, for Syrges, for offerynges and pylgrymage.
                     I recken to make them, a newe Crede in a whyle,
                     And all in Englysh, their conscyeÃÑce to begyle.

                  Then in holy church. with sencer, crosse and cope.
                  In the Ceremonyes, and blessed SacrameÃÑtals.
                  
                     In purgatory then, in pardons and in trentals,
                  In praynge to sayntes, and in saynt FraÃÑces whoode,
                  In our lady of Grace, and in the blessed roode.
                  They shall beleue also, in rellyckes and relygyon,
                  In our ladyes psalter, in fre wyll and good wurkes.
                  In the ember dayes, and in the popes remyssyon,
                  In bedes and in belles, not vsed of the turkes.
                  In the golden Masses, agaynst soch spretes as lurkes
                  With charmes and blessynges. Thys crede wyll brynge in moneye.

                     Ded fall vpon me, and spoyle me of my syght.
                     One was Ambycyon, whych euer ought me hate,
                     And Couetousnesse, the other enemye hyght.
                     Now forsoth and God, in their most cruell spyght.
                     The one made me blynde, the other made me lame,

                  We neuer breake vowe, so longe as we do not marrye,
                  Though we in whoredome, be neuer so bolde &amp; busye.

                     Saynt FraÃÑces habyte, with the holy gyrdle &amp; whode,
                     Non can go to helle, that therin dye by the rode,

                     Els maye they fortune, to be of their purpose wyde.
                     For I reade of one, that shuld haue gone to the deuyll
                     But the spretes of helle, coulde do to hym non euyll.

                     And than I care not, for all the deuyls in hell,
                     That I haue tolde yow, is more true than the Gospel.

                  Yet is it to them a very plesaunt thynge,
                  Their abbot at home, to be called lorde and kynge.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  Naye, monke and chorle, for here is no kynge butone.
                  If he be a kynge. hys mace is a mary bone,
                  Any hys crowne a cow torde. Soch knaues as come from the carr,
                  Must be called kynges, for playenge a popysh part,
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  It become not the, the Romyshe pope so to lurche.
                  
                     Consyderynge he is, the hyghest of the churche.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  If he be the hyghest, than is he the wether cocke,
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  Ah, now I perceyue, thu art dysposed to mocke,
                  Of all holy churche, he is the pryncypall heade.
               
               
                  Infidelitas:
                  Marry that is true, he sendeth out bulles vndre lead
                  And he hath two keyes, the one to open hell,
                  The other speareth heauen, thus do newe heretykes tel
                  They report also, that dogges haue no deuocyoÃÑ,
                  To hys holy lawes, not to hys olde instruccyon.

                  Why shuld dogges hate hym? make that more euydent.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  They loue no pese porrege, nor yet reade hearynges in lent,
                  Stock fysh nor oysters, but curse hym body and bone,
                  And wolde hys reade sprottes, &amp; rotteÃÑfysh were gone

                  I heare the people, complayne very moch of the.

                  What is their pratlinge, I praye the hartely tell me.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  They saye, thu teachest, nothyng but lowsy tradycioÃÑs
                  
                     And lyes for lucre, with damnable superstycyons.
                  And thus they coÃÑclude, yt the draffe of popysh prystes
                  Is good ynough for swyne, by whom they meane the papystes.
                  Yea, and they saye also, the dyet of men is all.
                  To most vyle carren, the dogges wyll sonest fall.
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  Than do they compare, the papystes vnto dogges.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  Marry that they do, &amp; to soch swynysh hogges.
                  As in swyll &amp; soffe, are brought vp all their lyfe.
                  Soch are the papystes, they saye both man and wyfe.
                  They saye of the also, that thu art a noughty knaue,
                  By prowlynge and lyenge, ye fryers wolde all haue.
                  Thyne order they saye, is spronge euen out of hell,
                  And all thys knowledge, they haue now of the Gospell.

                  Why, where is he now, I besych the hartely tell,

                  I commoned with hym, and he ded vs despyse,
                  Agaynst hym therfor, sumwhat must we deuyse.
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  Marry that must we, or els it wyll be wronge,
                  He wyll sure destroye vs, if we do suffer hym longe.
                  Nedes must we serue hym, as we ones serued Christ.
               
               
                  Infidelitas.
                  Why mad brayned whoresoÃÑs, how ded ye haÃÑdle Christ?
               
               
                  
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  
                     As he preached here, we followed froÃÑ place to place,
                     To trappe hym in snare, and hys doctryne to deface.
                     Than founde we the meanes, to put hym so to death,
                     Least he agaynst vs, shuld open any more breath.
                     And we set foure knyghtes, to kepe hym downe in hys graue.
                     That he neuer more, our lyuynge shuld depraue.
                  
                  
                     And thus must we serue, the Gospell, no remedye,
                     Els wyll be destroye, our lyuynge perpetuallye.
                     Better one were loft, than we shuld perysh all,
                     As Cayphas ones sayd, in counsell pharysaycall.

                  By God &amp; wele sayd. WhaÃÑ ye haue hym thys graue,
                  StaÃÑpe hym downe tyll he shyte. &amp; serue hym lyke a knaue.
               
               
                  Hypocrysis.
                  We must so ordre hym, that he go no more at large.
               
               
                  Pseudodoctrina.
                  Foure knyghtes wyll we hyre, whoÃÑ we shall streyghtly charge,
                  To kepe hym downe harde. The first are ambycyouse prelates,
                  Then couetouse lawers, that Gods worde spyghtfully hates,
                  Lordes without lernynge, &amp; iustyces vnryghtfull,
                  These wyll kepe hym downe, and rappe hym on the scull.
                  
                     Ther someners &amp; ther scribes, I waraÃÑde ye shal stere
                  With balyues and catch polles, to holde hym downe euery where.
                  I trowe Rugge &amp; Corbet, At Norwych wyll do their part.
                  With wharton of Bongaye, and for my sake put hym to smart.
               
               
                  Hypocrysis.
                  And I wyll rayse vp, in the vnyuersytees,
                  The seuen slepers there, to aduauÃÑce the popes decrees
                  As Dorbel &amp; Duns, Durande &amp; Thomas of Aquyne

                  In hys hande thre crosses, &amp; iij, crownes on hys head here.
                  Hys power betokenynge, in heaueÃÑ, in earth, &amp; in hell
                  That he maye commaunde, all kynges to subdue the Gospell.

                     Hys selfe maye do that, he nede coÃÑmaunde noÃÑ other.
                     Is not he the head, of the holy church our mother?
                     Maye not he make sayntes, and deuyls at hys owne pleasure?
                     Whych hath in hys haÃÑdes, the keyes &amp; churches treasure?
                     So wele as he made, S. HermaÃÑ first a saynt,

                        First he sent hym to heauen, by hys canonyzacyon,
                     And from thens to helle, by an excommunycacyon,
                     We reade of Formosus, that after he was dead,
                     One pope hys fyngars, an other cut of hys head.
                     And threwe hys carkas, into the floude of Tyber,
                     With the head &amp; fyngars, as Platina doth remeÃÑber.
                  
                  
                     In token that he, is iudge ouer quyck and dead,
                     And maye daÃÑpne &amp; saue, by hys pardons vndre lead,

                     He offered also, hys stones to Sathan, they saye,
                     For prestes chastyte, and so went their marryage awaye.

                  What art thu called? thy name to me rehearce.

                  I am vindicta Dei, in poÃÑnyshment most fearce,
                  With water, with swerde, and with fyre I must the pearce.

                     For if worldly gyftes, my furye myght haue changed.
                     The vnyuersall worlde, had not bene drowned with water,
                     Nor Sodome and Gomor, with so fyery fearfull matter.
                     Nor yet the Israelytes, with terrour of the sworde,
                     With hungre and pestylence, in the anger of Gods worde.
                  
                  
                     Pharao in Egipte, the plages had neuer felte,
                     Myght I haue bene stopped, for syluer or for gelte.
                     Into Egipte I brought, ten terryble poÃÑnyshmentes

                     And all kyndes of flyes, sone after ded I in brynge
                     Vpon their cattel, I threwe the foule pestylence,
                     Both borche, byle &amp; blayne, they had for their offence.
                     Lyghtenynges and haylynges, destroyed their corne and frute,
                     A swarne of hungry locustes, their pastours destytute
                  
                  
                     The space of thre dayes, I gaue them palpable darkenesse,

                  What, thu wylt not so, thy braynes are not so lyght.

                  Anger me not to moch, for if thu do, I fyght.
               
               
                  Vindicta Dei.
                  All that wyll not helpe, thy wycked workynges now,
                  Whan the stronger come, the weaker must nedes bowe
                  The lawe of Nature, infected thu hast with a leprye?
               
               
                  Infidelitas,
                  Naye, it was not I, but that wytche Idolatrye,
                  And that polde shorne knaue, that men call Sodomye
               
               
                  Vindicta Dei.
                  Of whom spronge they first? but of Infydelyte?
                  Therfor thu shalt haue that plage of penalte,
                  Whych they first tasted, for their inyquyre.
                  For those two vyces, I drowned the worlde with water.
                  In token wherof, I plage the with the same matter.
               
               hic Infidelitatem lympha percutit.

                  Tush, I defye thy worst. Thys shall not dryue me heÃÑce
                  For after the floude, with Cham had I resydence.
                  And so contynued, tyll Moyses lawe came in.

                     And hym thu corruptedest, with Auaryce &amp; AmbycyoÃÑ,
                     And so dedyst leaue hym, in myserable coÃÑdycyoÃÑ,
                     Thu shalt haue therfor, that than to them was due,
                     Most terryble barrayle, the Israelytes vntrue,
                     That tyme ded suffer, for their infydelyte,

                     Yes, &amp; after that, was I with Simon Magus.
                     With Saunder Copper smyth, with Elimas and Demetrius.
                     And now I perseuer, amoÃÑge ye raÃÑke rable of papystes

                     Agaynst false doctryne, and cursed hypocresye.
